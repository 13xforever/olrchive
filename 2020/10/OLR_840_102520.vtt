00:00.000 --> 00:13.160
This week, Twitch gets bigger and legal pressure gets stronger.

00:13.160 --> 00:17.080
Long known to be a source of contention, copyrighted music on streams has become a large content

00:17.080 --> 00:21.600
liability with Twitch choosing to delete large amounts of archived content from streamers'

00:21.600 --> 00:23.600
channels where copyrighted music was present.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.600
This is a complicated subject that I can't properly express in 20 seconds alone, so I'm

00:27.600 --> 00:31.600
turning it over to your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to discuss this and

00:31.600 --> 00:35.560
all the night's news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:35.560 --> 00:45.600
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.600 --> 00:48.080
where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.080 --> 00:56.680
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 840 of our show.

00:56.680 --> 01:02.320
For this October the 25th of 2020, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always by

01:02.320 --> 01:03.480
my co-hosts.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.400
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
Hey.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Hey, Jamie.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
How you doing?

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
I'm all right.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
Yeah?

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
I'm in-

01:12.400 --> 01:16.040
Well, I'll be honest, headache, but I'm here.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.040
You're here.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.040
All right.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.040
Well, appreciate-

01:19.040 --> 01:21.160
There's no bright glowy circle halo like usual.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.160
That's okay.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.160
That's okay.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.160
It's all right.

01:24.160 --> 01:28.920
But anyway, so it's okay for things to be dark and a little bit moody tonight, I suppose.

01:28.920 --> 01:29.920
Moody?

01:29.920 --> 01:31.520
Well, yeah, that would be me.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.920
I'm trying to pick out everything on your shelf too, and I'm having a hard time.

01:34.920 --> 01:35.920
Okay.

01:35.920 --> 01:41.920
So I have my mini Impala from Supernatural.

01:41.920 --> 01:42.920
All right.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.800
I have my Sam Pop.

01:45.800 --> 01:51.800
I have P-P-Puddin, Parappa, there's a Magikarp back there, I have a weighted companion cube,

01:51.800 --> 01:54.480
and my pumpkin because it is Halloween-y.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.480
All right.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
Well, unfortunately-

01:56.480 --> 01:58.600
I'm enjoying my Supernatural love because the show is almost over.

01:58.600 --> 02:02.960
For those that are listening on our podcast feed, they can't see all that stuff on video,

02:02.960 --> 02:07.320
but it's just incentive to try to be here when we record live Sunday nights at six o'clock

02:07.320 --> 02:12.280
Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network, The Voice of Geeks network,

02:12.280 --> 02:14.340
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:14.340 --> 02:15.600
So we are live on Sunday nights.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.280
And if you're a subscriber here on our Twitch feed, which I think you can pay five bucks

02:20.280 --> 02:27.520
for, or you can use your free Amazon Prime subscription that will give you one free Twitch

02:27.520 --> 02:28.520
sub a month.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.720
You can use that, and that will allow you to access all the video on demand.

02:31.720 --> 02:36.320
So if you're listening at home on your podcast feed right now through Spotify or something,

02:36.320 --> 02:40.520
and you're like, I want to see Dark Sakura's recording space, you can hit up the Twitch

02:40.520 --> 02:42.860
channel and check that out.

02:42.860 --> 02:46.160
Also joining us, of course, as he is every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.160
Hello.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.160
Hey, Loki.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.160
How are you doing?

02:49.640 --> 02:50.640
I'm doing fine.

02:50.640 --> 02:55.160
And I see the listeners who are participating live tonight with us have recognized the game

02:55.160 --> 02:59.000
behind you as Carrion, that game that came out not that long ago.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.040
Is this something you've been playing lately or?

03:01.040 --> 03:07.280
No, I just I have to think of a Halloween game and I could have done the other one.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.920
I was kind of going with thought about Friday the 13th from the NES, but I was like, yeah,

03:12.920 --> 03:13.920
that's a good one.

03:13.920 --> 03:17.800
I'm sure we've done that before, but probably I haven't really played much.

03:17.840 --> 03:23.200
I haven't really played any of this game, but I know that that they have as part of

03:23.200 --> 03:29.120
that Devolver Digital E3 game thing that they did.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.120
Yeah.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.120
So, yeah.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.520
So and I love the Friday the 13th video game.

03:33.520 --> 03:38.200
I know it gets a lot of crap for being a terrible video game, but I don't hate it.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.960
I think the music was good, too.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.160
It was creepy, very creepy.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.040
And those those first person sequences in the house.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.280
I'm sorry, that was that was some scary shit.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
All right.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.720
So those of you that are watching us live can see we're on the four shot tonight, which

03:50.720 --> 03:53.160
means we have a guest joining us.

03:53.160 --> 03:57.080
And say hello, everyone joining us all familiar face here at Orange Laundry.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.080
Say hello to Shane.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.080
Hello.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.960
Hey, Shane, how are you doing?

04:01.960 --> 04:03.240
I've been better.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.760
I was going to say, you don't look so great.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.080
Do you do you care to share with listeners what's going on?

04:09.080 --> 04:16.560
No, because I've already talked about it before and posted on social media that I got COVID.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.240
So, like, legit, you tested positive for COVID.

04:20.240 --> 04:25.440
Yeah, it was this this is probably why I got it.

04:25.440 --> 04:30.720
I took a test so I would have to not go to school the next day because we only have one

04:30.720 --> 04:34.880
car and my husband needed it for something else.

04:34.880 --> 04:41.280
Like, well, if I take a test, then I won't have to have I can't go to school.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.640
And I was already like I had like a sore throat and a cough.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.960
I was like, it's a good enough reason to let me get tested and then you can just take

04:48.960 --> 04:49.960
the car.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.240
Well, I got tested and oops, it was positive.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.840
So it was that.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.120
There's a name for the show if I ever heard one.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.120
Oops, it was positive.

04:59.120 --> 05:04.880
Well, obviously, I'm I'm giggling about it now, but it's not, you know, it luckily we

05:04.880 --> 05:09.200
can make a little light of it because your symptoms, although they've been lingering,

05:09.200 --> 05:12.240
haven't been serious enough to send you to the hospital or anything like that.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.240
Right.

05:13.840 --> 05:21.000
So the sore throat and cough, the sore throat was the worst thing for me.

05:21.000 --> 05:30.240
Thankfully, I'm on day nine or ten now and my sore throat went away yesterday.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.480
So that's good.

05:32.480 --> 05:43.160
A cough, fatigue, general just breathing issues and crazy amounts of headache.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.800
I don't normally get headaches, so it's very frustrating.

05:47.800 --> 05:52.720
Now what is interesting about this scenario, too, is that, you know, I wasn't here on Orange

05:52.720 --> 05:56.120
on Radio a couple of weeks ago because I took a trip out to Idaho.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.540
I'm not sure how explicitly I said this, but I went to go visit Shane.

05:59.540 --> 06:01.760
Like Shane is, you know, one of my longest friends.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.760
And we thought, you know, you and your husband take this situation very seriously.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.380
Me and Alan take this very seriously.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.720
So we don't really get to see other people a lot.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.180
So we kind of figured that the risk was low.

06:12.220 --> 06:19.020
So something that you guys may not know, two hours before OLR last week is when Shane sent

06:19.020 --> 06:24.900
me a text that was like, boy, do I have some news for you type of thing.

06:24.900 --> 06:30.660
So I had to get a test Monday and mine was negative.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.380
So there's that.

06:32.380 --> 06:38.020
So it seems likely that you probably got COVID like a day or two after I left.

06:38.020 --> 06:40.020
The way the timing works out, right?

06:40.580 --> 06:47.860
Yeah, I think maybe one day, um, and it's, it's, I guess, I guess the term is funny.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.780
It's funny too, because Dustin didn't get it.

06:50.780 --> 06:52.300
He tested negative.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.980
We have two roommates.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.540
They tested negative.

06:55.540 --> 07:01.340
It's just me, the person who screams all the time about wearing their mask and will not

07:01.340 --> 07:04.860
take it off even in the car if I'm going to go get drive.

07:04.860 --> 07:07.900
So I probably picked it up at school somehow.

07:07.940 --> 07:12.740
Shane is joining us to talk about video games and not just COVID, but I have to say, just

07:12.740 --> 07:17.460
to kind of back up your story a little bit, like when I got there on Thursday and like

07:17.460 --> 07:20.940
got to your house, you and Dustin were wearing masks in the house and so was I.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.020
And I was like, well, I don't want to be rude and take mine off.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.100
They're going to keep theirs on.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.980
And there was a point where I was like, are we just going to have our masks on in the

07:26.980 --> 07:27.900
house all weekend?

07:27.900 --> 07:31.620
And I think Shane was like, yep, but we did.

07:31.620 --> 07:36.860
We ended up, obviously it just, it became too much and you know, but, uh, yeah.

07:36.900 --> 07:41.540
So, um, well, obviously, you know, the, our chat is lighting up over at twitch.tv slash

07:41.540 --> 07:42.220
VOG network.

07:42.460 --> 07:46.820
Uh, there's a lot of people wishing you well, and I'm hoping that, uh, you feel a lot

07:46.820 --> 07:47.900
better very soon.

07:48.180 --> 07:52.940
Uh, and the good news is you have been slowly, like it just seems like this whole

07:52.940 --> 07:55.900
process is just long is what's, what's annoying about it.

07:56.540 --> 07:57.100
Yeah.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.740
I mean, once I kicked the sore throat, everything else is manageable to me.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.980
I don't mind getting fatigued.

08:04.500 --> 08:09.580
I don't, headaches are stupid and I'm glad I normally don't get them because they are

08:10.340 --> 08:11.100
so annoying.

08:12.020 --> 08:17.980
Um, the cough is like, whatever, but man, it does suck.

08:17.980 --> 08:19.180
And it does take a while.

08:19.180 --> 08:24.620
And supposedly starting tomorrow, I'm okay to do stuff again.

08:25.180 --> 08:25.620
Excuse me.

08:25.620 --> 08:29.540
I'm okay to do stuff again, but like, no, you're not like, I'm sorry.

08:29.820 --> 08:33.900
Hey, hey, Shane, do you feel like you have an adult Maine Coon sitting

08:33.900 --> 08:35.180
on your chest the whole time?

08:35.820 --> 08:36.620
A what?

08:36.620 --> 08:39.020
A Maine Coon, giant cat, big cat.

08:39.020 --> 08:40.540
Oh, I hope not.

08:40.540 --> 08:41.940
No, I don't feel like that.

08:41.940 --> 08:42.900
It doesn't feel like that.

08:43.060 --> 08:48.980
See, when I had pneumonia quote fingers, I felt like that all the time, but I had

08:48.980 --> 08:51.860
the sore throat and I had the headache the whole time and I couldn't move.

08:52.420 --> 08:54.900
I felt like doing nothing but sitting in the chair.

08:54.900 --> 08:59.420
Thank goodness Animal Crossing had just come out, but still, yeah, I hope you feel

08:59.420 --> 08:59.660
better.

09:00.300 --> 09:00.660
Yeah.

09:00.740 --> 09:01.460
Oh, thank you.

09:02.100 --> 09:02.340
Yeah.

09:02.340 --> 09:07.380
The doctor told me that he's like, you're probably not going to feel better really

09:07.380 --> 09:11.180
for two weeks at least so, or like all the way better.

09:11.180 --> 09:14.660
So I'm just gonna find a, I'm still not going to school.

09:14.660 --> 09:19.340
I can't, I told them, yeah, I don't have a sore throat anymore, but the cough is

09:19.340 --> 09:21.820
probably not a good thing to go back to class with.

09:22.660 --> 09:26.900
So they listened and yeah, I'm still just going to take it easy.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.740
I don't really have anywhere I need to be.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.940
So let's just listen to your body first.

09:32.180 --> 09:36.580
Uh, it took me six months, not six months, six weeks to fully get over all my

09:36.580 --> 09:37.140
symptoms.

09:38.060 --> 09:40.020
So listen to yourself first.

09:40.020 --> 09:43.820
The doctors may tell you one, you know, blanket answer, but your body's going to

09:43.820 --> 09:44.500
be the best judge.

09:44.980 --> 09:45.260
Yeah.

09:45.940 --> 09:50.100
Um, no one special 77 in our chat says the fact that Shane has yet to say

09:50.100 --> 09:54.020
whatever during the call is a sure sign that he truly is sick.

09:54.060 --> 09:54.780
Get well, dude.

09:54.780 --> 09:58.820
Well, we haven't really talked about games yet, but I didn't bring you here

09:58.820 --> 10:01.980
just to grill you about COVID, but I think it is one of those things people

10:01.980 --> 10:05.060
are genuinely curious about, you know, cause it's, it's, it's everywhere.

10:05.060 --> 10:05.540
Obviously.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.540
Um, I mean, I'm laying in bed in the bedroom right now.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.900
It's not like a normal studio experience.

10:11.940 --> 10:14.740
I had to explain to the viewers why you look like shit.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.700
Like, let's just, let's just say it.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.380
What it is.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.420
I'm not, my hair looks okay.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.940
Your hair does not look like shit.

10:22.620 --> 10:25.180
Like he's in bed with not bed hair.

10:25.220 --> 10:29.500
I can tell Shane's like sick, like, but his, yes, your hair looks amazing.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.100
I'll give you that.

10:30.900 --> 10:31.180
All right.

10:31.220 --> 10:31.940
Always does.

10:31.940 --> 10:32.420
Thank you.

10:32.940 --> 10:33.380
Okay.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.020
Let's talk about games.

10:35.020 --> 10:39.220
So obviously this whole COVID situation is shitty as it is means you get to stay

10:39.220 --> 10:40.580
home and play a lot of video games.

10:40.580 --> 10:40.900
Right.

10:41.900 --> 10:46.460
So you've been playing a lot of the Pokemon DLC, right?

10:46.460 --> 10:47.660
The Pokemon content, right?

10:48.100 --> 10:48.780
Yes.

10:48.820 --> 10:49.300
Oh my God.

10:49.340 --> 10:55.180
I played it till like 6 AM the other night morning, something like that.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.460
And I would tell us about it.

10:57.460 --> 11:01.740
Cause I got to say, I don't, I mean, I know there is sword and shield DLC, but

11:01.740 --> 11:03.340
I haven't played the first one yet.

11:03.340 --> 11:06.460
So is this second one just like the first one, but with different

11:06.460 --> 11:07.660
Pokemon or how's it different?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.180
No, I feel like it's a step up.

11:10.220 --> 11:14.460
Whereas the first DLC also kind of felt like a step up from the game.

11:14.580 --> 11:18.420
Cause it was nothing but the wild area, but done a lot better.

11:19.020 --> 11:21.660
This one is even better than that.

11:21.660 --> 11:26.340
In terms of wild area, you know, there's some new legendaries, some new Galar

11:26.340 --> 11:30.660
forms, but the part that matters is the Dynamax adventure.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.780
The Dynamax adventures are what the max raid should have been.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.740
And I cannot quit playing them.

11:36.740 --> 11:37.700
There's so much fun.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.620
What, tell us a little bit about what those entails.

11:41.620 --> 11:45.020
So they're, they're, they're not quite like the raids, but there's some

11:45.020 --> 11:45.820
similarity, right?

11:46.460 --> 11:46.860
Correct.

11:46.900 --> 11:49.180
They're like, they're a different style, right?

11:49.180 --> 11:53.700
Because you still have four Pokemon against one, but in this one, you

11:53.700 --> 11:55.180
don't bring your own Pokemon.

11:55.180 --> 11:59.980
You are given a choice between like preset Pokemon, which is great because

12:00.780 --> 12:03.660
then you don't see a lot of the same ones over and over again.

12:03.660 --> 12:06.580
It's not like four legendaries against one thing that you're just

12:06.580 --> 12:07.740
going to overpower really.

12:08.380 --> 12:11.500
And nobody brings a fucking Magikarp that does nothing.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.500
No, no, nobody brings a Magikarp.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.460
I don't know.

12:15.460 --> 12:16.900
Maybe you could get one on the way.

12:16.900 --> 12:17.140
I don't know.

12:18.020 --> 12:21.940
But anyway, you start out with four and you have to go through these tunnels.

12:21.980 --> 12:26.980
And each at the end of each intersection is a Pokemon you fight just

12:26.980 --> 12:28.300
like a normal max raid battle.

12:28.300 --> 12:29.300
It has no shields.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.740
So it's just one life bar.

12:31.380 --> 12:35.540
And after you beat it, you and the other three people you're with get the

12:35.540 --> 12:40.380
option to take that Pokemon with you for the rest of the journey.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.140
And so you do that three times.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.900
And at the end, you fight a legendary.

12:45.340 --> 12:51.100
If you catch everything on the results screen, you get to take one of those

12:51.100 --> 12:56.100
four Pokemon you caught to take back with what's great about that for people

12:56.100 --> 13:00.780
like me is this is a fun way to shiny hunt while you're playing, none of the

13:00.780 --> 13:04.940
Pokemon show up shiny, but at the end, the results screen where you pick the

13:04.940 --> 13:10.860
Pokemon, if they're shiny and they have a one in 100% or one in 100 chance to be

13:10.860 --> 13:15.260
shiny, it'll just show up on screen as a shiny, and then you take it and you

13:15.260 --> 13:16.820
got yourself a brand new shiny.

13:17.540 --> 13:22.420
Um, in fact, right before the show, a little, maybe a couple of hours, I ended

13:22.420 --> 13:28.060
up getting a shiny, uh, legendary and I was super excited and it just made my

13:28.060 --> 13:28.180
night.

13:28.660 --> 13:29.660
Which legendary did you get?

13:30.580 --> 13:32.100
Reshiram from black and white.

13:32.180 --> 13:32.700
Oh, okay.

13:32.980 --> 13:33.460
Congrats.

13:34.420 --> 13:34.980
Thank you.

13:35.340 --> 13:40.300
So is this kind of, um, one of the big, excuse me, is this one of the big, like

13:40.780 --> 13:45.060
perks of this particular DLC is that you kind of get to do shiny legendary hunting,

13:45.060 --> 13:48.820
which I don't think is something that's very easy to do in the games otherwise.

13:48.820 --> 13:49.100
Right.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.100
Maybe Pokemon go, but that's a non-issue.

13:52.220 --> 13:58.660
Well, yes, I think the big draw for this content was supposed to just be

13:58.660 --> 14:04.300
legendaries in general, but once the shiny odds for everything, plus the

14:04.300 --> 14:11.740
legendaries that you, um, encounter in this new style of play, um, got figured

14:11.740 --> 14:14.540
out, I think a lot more people were more excited.

14:15.020 --> 14:20.060
Um, so yeah, the draw is legendaries, but for me it's yeah, shiny legendaries

14:20.380 --> 14:21.540
or just random shinies.

14:21.540 --> 14:26.780
Like, uh, maybe it was like my third or fourth time going through one of the

14:26.780 --> 14:31.180
dungeons or whatever caverns I got a regular Pokemon.

14:31.180 --> 14:32.580
I was like, whoa, I don't have this one yet.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.140
That's awesome.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.060
So it's neat.

14:35.100 --> 14:40.460
I feel like my time is not wasted where max, max raids, I constantly

14:40.460 --> 14:41.980
felt like my time was wasted.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.420
Do you, do you think that they're going to end up doing a third DLC?

14:46.420 --> 14:49.420
I know that that's been rumored for quite some time and, and could

14:49.420 --> 14:54.380
potentially fill in the final remaining gaps and, and maybe make the national

14:54.420 --> 14:57.100
Dexter's stop bitching, although I don't think they ever will.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.620
But what do you, what do you think the status is on a potential third

14:59.620 --> 15:03.260
DLC, just being a fan and follower of the series, as long as you have been.

15:04.260 --> 15:10.420
Well, since my favorite Pokemon is not in yet, still, I want a third DLC.

15:11.420 --> 15:16.020
If they didn't do a third DLC, I could see that still being okay.

15:16.380 --> 15:19.380
And then next year we just get another new proper game.

15:20.140 --> 15:25.540
Um, but if they were to do third DLC and not do a new proper game next year,

15:25.540 --> 15:29.780
it's gotta be more expensive than what we've been given for, I feel like.

15:30.060 --> 15:33.020
Do you think it's going to be a proper, um, game next year?

15:33.020 --> 15:36.020
Or do you think it's going to end up being like a remake of either gen four

15:36.020 --> 15:39.020
or like a let's go gen two type of thing?

15:39.020 --> 15:39.420
What do you think?

15:39.420 --> 15:41.500
I never want to let's go game after again.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.860
So not no to that.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.500
Well, I didn't say what you wanted.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.780
I said what you think will happen.

15:47.660 --> 15:48.820
Those are the same thing.

15:48.860 --> 15:54.140
So no, I don't want nor think the let's go game should happen.

15:54.980 --> 15:58.420
Um, I don't want a gen four remake either.

15:58.420 --> 16:00.460
I'd rather have something new personally.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.580
I'd rather have a third DLC over a gen four remake.

16:03.980 --> 16:04.260
Okay.

16:04.820 --> 16:08.540
Um, over at chat, uh, sg100 matt says, are the national deck

16:08.540 --> 16:09.820
sirs still complaining?

16:09.980 --> 16:10.860
Is water wet?

16:10.980 --> 16:13.420
Like look at the responses to any Pokemon tweet.

16:13.620 --> 16:14.260
Sorry, buddy.

16:14.580 --> 16:18.740
Uh, at depth and chat says, uh, I don't think we'll get a third DLC, but I do

16:18.740 --> 16:21.060
think we're getting Sinnoh remakes next.

16:21.060 --> 16:24.380
So kind of on that train of the gen four remakes potentially next.

16:25.900 --> 16:26.180
Yeah.

16:26.220 --> 16:31.380
If gen four does come next, at least that means we're one step closer to a gen

16:31.380 --> 16:32.980
five remade and that's all I realize.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.940
Um, so anything else you want to say about Pokemon?

16:37.900 --> 16:38.700
No, no.

16:38.740 --> 16:39.060
Okay.

16:39.780 --> 16:43.580
Let's talk about another game that, um, you've been playing a little bit and I've

16:43.580 --> 16:46.780
been playing a little bit, so I'm getting into my gaming week just a little bit, but

16:46.780 --> 16:48.380
with good reason cause Shane's still here.

16:48.740 --> 16:53.020
Um, so, and, and this is also one of the things where I've been sitting here for

16:53.260 --> 16:57.340
several months now saying, um, I'm probably not going to do this.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.300
I'm, I really don't have any interest in doing this.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.460
I'm not going to do this.

17:00.780 --> 17:05.220
And, uh, I went and did it and that is, uh, playing world of warcraft.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.020
And the reason why is because, uh, Shane, you've been playing it a little bit

17:09.020 --> 17:12.140
because of the, uh, well, actually what, what made you want to play that again?

17:12.140 --> 17:20.420
Actually, two things, uh, just curiosity to kind of see how the game has been.

17:20.420 --> 17:27.300
Cause even if, even if I don't love it or even like it as much as I used to, it's

17:27.300 --> 17:33.100
kind of like revisiting something, uh, like your hometown or something, you know,

17:33.100 --> 17:37.860
I spent a lot of time in that stupid game and it's just kind of neat to

17:38.020 --> 17:39.660
check out every once in a while.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.220
So that's one reason.

17:42.220 --> 17:46.740
And the second reason was they, um, decided to do a whole bunch of additional

17:46.740 --> 17:49.980
customization for the game, for the races.

17:50.020 --> 17:53.940
And I thought one of the problems that game has is every character

17:53.940 --> 17:55.620
looks very much the same.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.540
There's not a lot of diversity in what you can make.

17:59.180 --> 18:03.300
And they were really trying to step up the diversity.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.140
So I thought I would go check it.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.620
Yeah, I'll say that the character customization.

18:08.660 --> 18:10.460
I'm going to get, that's a big win.

18:10.500 --> 18:14.220
Like it's, and it's not, obviously the diversity stuff is a huge win,

18:14.220 --> 18:15.940
but like, it's even more than that.

18:15.940 --> 18:18.700
Like, it's just like the way you can customize like Torrens.

18:18.700 --> 18:22.260
I noticed, I was like, dang, you can make a Torren look really good.

18:22.260 --> 18:24.500
And it's, I was very impressed with that whole thing.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.180
I will say that.

18:25.620 --> 18:28.860
Um, but yeah, you know, I was, I was dragging my feet in the sand.

18:28.860 --> 18:29.620
I'm like, I'm not going to do this.

18:29.620 --> 18:30.300
I'm not going to do this.

18:30.580 --> 18:34.340
And we have this long running joke on Orange Launch Radio that Shane has these

18:34.340 --> 18:38.420
mysterious powers of persuasion where he can usually convince people to play

18:38.420 --> 18:40.900
whatever game he wants them to play or do whatever.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.700
But I was, I was standing firm on this one.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.020
I'm like, no, I'm not dropping that kind of money on wow.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.540
I'm not a huge Blizzard person these days.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.380
Anyway, I'm going to sit this one out.

18:50.740 --> 18:54.500
And then it's, you know, Rob, I got COVID and I'm bored.

18:56.340 --> 18:56.740
Okay.

18:57.180 --> 18:57.820
No, no.

18:57.820 --> 19:01.100
Well, there's a, there's other stuff we're not going to bring up on the show.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.100
You had a very bad week.

19:02.100 --> 19:02.420
Yeah.

19:03.060 --> 19:03.260
Yeah.

19:03.260 --> 19:04.260
I had a very bad week.

19:04.300 --> 19:11.380
Um, but also in my defense, I did not really ask you to play so

19:11.380 --> 19:14.380
much as you offered to play.

19:14.660 --> 19:20.260
I finally caved because you had a lot of stuff going on and I recognize that.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.180
And I'm like, okay, if I could do this thing to make Shane happy, I'll do it.

19:23.460 --> 19:26.740
And I was like, you know what, if nothing else, I'll have an educated

19:26.740 --> 19:27.940
opinion when I talk about it.

19:27.980 --> 19:31.660
And, um, my educated opinion is like, it's again, the character

19:31.660 --> 19:32.820
customization is cool.

19:33.140 --> 19:38.500
Um, the level squish is interesting, but I'm, I'm kinda, I don't know.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.740
Like I, anything is always more fun with friends.

19:42.260 --> 19:43.380
I like playing with you.

19:43.380 --> 19:46.140
And I like playing with the small friend group we have that still plays.

19:46.140 --> 19:46.420
Wow.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.580
Wow is interesting when that's happening.

19:48.940 --> 19:52.180
But like I was starting to do kind of like a little priest on my own and I

19:52.180 --> 19:55.300
was running it back through the Missa Pandaria areas and stuff and kind of

19:55.300 --> 19:56.420
like getting reunited with stuff.

19:56.420 --> 20:00.700
And I have to admit there kind of came a point where I was like, Hmm, this

20:00.740 --> 20:01.940
isn't really fun alone.

20:01.980 --> 20:04.260
And it's not something I really like.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.260
I was just like, I'm going to go back to Final Fantasy 14 and

20:06.260 --> 20:07.460
get my goals done in that game.

20:07.860 --> 20:13.340
So like, I dunno, I hope the expansion turns out well for that community.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.580
Cause there's a great, you know, community there, but I can't say there

20:16.580 --> 20:21.260
was like, as much as they talk about this, this, um, uh, Shadowlands pre-patch

20:21.260 --> 20:24.340
was huge changes and huge things going on with the levels, which is the

20:24.340 --> 20:28.660
biggest changes to the game since Cataclysm, like as much as I hear all

20:28.700 --> 20:31.900
that, and I can see that from the technical levels and everything, I

20:31.900 --> 20:35.540
just couldn't help but feel, eh, this game is the same old shit.

20:35.700 --> 20:39.020
Like this really hasn't changed that much in 15 years.

20:39.060 --> 20:44.540
Well, in the, since, since Blizzard started going down the, since Mike

20:44.540 --> 20:46.380
Morhaime left, it hasn't changed much.

20:47.260 --> 20:51.620
So I think both and 14 are fine games in their own rights.

20:52.140 --> 20:56.620
What's been good about Lout is that it's a game I can kind of

20:56.620 --> 20:58.300
turn my brain off playing.

20:58.420 --> 21:04.860
Whereas 14, even if we do the same two dungeons on an expert roulette over and

21:04.860 --> 21:09.700
over, and there's not much variance, I still somewhat feel like I have to think

21:09.700 --> 21:17.900
more and wow, like I got a character from, uh, zero to 40 in like two days.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.620
Cause I could just sit there and mindlessly play.

21:21.620 --> 21:27.660
So maybe it's cause it's all old content still, but I don't know.

21:28.300 --> 21:31.220
It's good for mana and stuff.

21:31.620 --> 21:35.740
It is really fascinating how Blizzard has just basically said, okay, so old

21:35.740 --> 21:39.700
world of Warcraft is going to go squish like, and you're going to get through it

21:39.700 --> 21:42.180
in the blink of an eye, and then we're just going to move right on to the latest

21:42.180 --> 21:42.700
expansion.

21:42.700 --> 21:47.780
So they really are hedging like the future of WoW basically, or maybe not on

21:47.780 --> 21:51.460
this new, I think WoW will still be, if EverQuest has like 20 expansions, WoW

21:51.460 --> 21:54.500
is still going to be around a long time, but, uh, they're hedging a lot of the

21:54.500 --> 21:56.420
future of WoW on this new expansion.

21:56.420 --> 21:59.020
So, yeah, and that they ended up delaying.

21:59.020 --> 21:59.620
So it'd be interesting.

21:59.940 --> 22:00.220
Okay.

22:00.220 --> 22:01.100
So we talked Pokemon.

22:01.100 --> 22:01.860
We talked, wow.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.980
Any other video games I've got to talk with you about Shane?

22:06.100 --> 22:06.540
Okay.

22:06.580 --> 22:07.540
We'll talk about that.

22:07.780 --> 22:12.100
Let's actually tie that into the other kickoff topic I had planned for tonight.

22:12.340 --> 22:16.140
Um, so Loki, if you don't mind me throwing the ball to you, uh, there was a huge

22:16.140 --> 22:17.180
historic event on Twitter.

22:17.180 --> 22:20.260
Everybody knows what this is going to be, uh, that involved that game

22:20.260 --> 22:21.380
among us this week, right?

22:21.620 --> 22:23.340
Uh, Loki, just so you know, you're muted and I can't hear you.

22:24.340 --> 22:24.740
Sorry.

22:24.740 --> 22:25.700
I thought I had unmuted.

22:25.740 --> 22:28.980
It's 2020.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.820
We're all used to asking when people unmute happens.

22:31.860 --> 22:32.300
Yes.

22:32.340 --> 22:39.260
So, um, uh, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, um, streamed on Twitch, which,

22:39.300 --> 22:40.780
uh, she had teased about doing.

22:41.180 --> 22:46.500
Uh, she is one of the representatives in the, I wouldn't say the house.

22:46.540 --> 22:53.740
And so, um, it's just kind of a really unique thing because normally, you know,

22:53.740 --> 22:57.460
you don't see a lot of these representatives and stuff, uh, connecting

22:57.460 --> 23:02.780
with their constituents in kind of a more modern way, for example.

23:02.780 --> 23:09.540
So, um, of course it was met with, you know, uh, a lot of viewers because

23:09.540 --> 23:12.820
everyone was really interested in this and it was overall pretty wholesome

23:12.820 --> 23:16.420
about it, but it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was,

23:16.900 --> 23:21.260
it drew in over, uh, four thousand, four hundred and thirty thousand viewers.

23:21.420 --> 23:24.300
I want to say that number's probably a little low because I think that's

23:24.300 --> 23:26.820
just her stream was the peak on that.

23:27.180 --> 23:30.340
But considering that all the other people that were playing along with

23:30.340 --> 23:34.060
her, um, lots of other streamers, there's probably folks watching

23:34.060 --> 23:35.060
through them as well.

23:35.060 --> 23:38.060
So I would, I think that number's probably a bit lower.

23:38.220 --> 23:40.780
And it was also, um, that was the concurrent viewers.

23:40.820 --> 23:44.540
If you go and you, so now, and Twitch didn't always do this, but now with

23:44.540 --> 23:48.420
the VODs or the video on demand, it actually shows a view count.

23:48.420 --> 23:52.460
So like most of the VODs on VOG Network were one, two, three, four, five

23:52.460 --> 23:55.940
views, you know, very few people going in the archive and looking at old shows.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.620
Um, but now what happens, it doesn't do that anymore.

23:58.620 --> 24:01.380
Well, it does for the highlights of the show, but like if you go back

24:01.380 --> 24:05.740
and you watch the live uncropped version, basically with all the, you

24:05.740 --> 24:09.140
know, standby, we'll be live soon and all that stuff, it actually shows

24:09.140 --> 24:12.820
the number of views that this episode got while we were live all together.

24:12.820 --> 24:16.020
So a lot of them have, you know, 120, 130, however many people

24:16.020 --> 24:17.260
dropped in and out during the show.

24:17.460 --> 24:23.020
My point is AOC's stream had, had 5 million less last I checked.

24:23.300 --> 24:26.380
Now, obviously this made, yeah, this, this made news.

24:26.380 --> 24:29.140
Maybe there were people going in and out several times during the thing.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.020
A lot of people checking it out after the fact, I'm sure as it was linked

24:32.020 --> 24:35.780
on all these news blogs and things like that, but that's, that's huge.

24:35.900 --> 24:36.980
That's a lot of people.

24:37.540 --> 24:41.300
It was, and it was really, it was really like a wholesome, the whole

24:41.300 --> 24:43.420
thing was like a very wholesome stream.

24:43.780 --> 24:47.100
Um, it was fun to see a lot of different content creators get

24:47.100 --> 24:50.020
together to kind of pull this off because originally the whole thing

24:50.020 --> 24:53.860
started off with, um, she was posting on Twitter, Hey, who'd be interested

24:53.860 --> 24:58.580
in an Among Us stream and everyone's like, yeah, me, me, me, instant exposure.

24:58.580 --> 24:58.900
Yeah.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.500
So you had, you know, like lots of online personalities.

25:01.540 --> 25:05.260
Uh, first off another representative Ilhan Omar was in there as well.

25:05.260 --> 25:05.980
So that was great.

25:06.420 --> 25:09.140
Um, yeah, she was vicious.

25:10.140 --> 25:16.660
So many people, uh, yeah, you had a Hassan piker, a pokey main, uh, Dr.

25:16.660 --> 25:22.740
Lupo disguised toast, uh, moist, critical myth, um, jacksepticeye.

25:22.740 --> 25:25.860
I know Gus buckets or Gus Johnson was in there as well.

25:25.940 --> 25:27.940
Um, uh, what was it?

25:28.020 --> 25:31.740
Corpse husband who that guy had a voice voice.

25:33.420 --> 25:37.740
Um, so yeah, it was just, it was a great, great event overall.

25:37.740 --> 25:43.980
Um, lots of just kind of promoting folks to go to the polls, vote, um, get

25:43.980 --> 25:48.340
registered to vote if you're not registered, um, I mean, it was just great.

25:48.340 --> 25:52.220
And it was just like, it was a nice change of pace with all the chaos going

25:52.220 --> 25:56.140
on, just to like, be able to connect with someone, you know, a politician in a way

25:56.140 --> 26:01.340
that's not like just wanting to drive you nuts, it was like someone relatable at

26:01.340 --> 26:04.300
least, and I think that's kind of what she was going for with that.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.980
So overall really great.

26:07.460 --> 26:08.020
For sure.

26:08.020 --> 26:12.540
And over in our chat, SSJ 100, Matt, let me give you a, for, uh, for, uh, for

26:12.540 --> 26:16.540
instance, game number one of the world series that happened that same night had

26:16.540 --> 26:19.420
about 15 K concurrent worldwide.

26:19.420 --> 26:23.380
And that's compared to the 400 plus K, uh, plus, plus when you count the

26:23.380 --> 26:27.780
other streamers, the AOC had now, look, I'm not bringing this story up on OLR.

26:27.780 --> 26:31.060
We're not bringing this story up on OLR necessarily for the political side of it.

26:31.060 --> 26:35.260
Like it's no secret that, you know, the host of the show tend to lean a little

26:35.300 --> 26:35.700
left.

26:35.700 --> 26:36.060
Okay.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.420
Like I know you've picked that up over the time.

26:38.700 --> 26:43.220
Um, I don't necessarily a hundred percent agree with AOC all the time.

26:43.260 --> 26:46.740
Like I don't necessarily agree with every of her ideas and things like that.

26:47.180 --> 26:49.940
Um, but, uh, I agree with a lot of them.

26:50.780 --> 26:54.780
And I was more taken by, as opposed to agree or disagree or any of that stuff,

26:54.780 --> 26:59.340
putting all of that aside, I would like to think that if I was someone who leaned

26:59.340 --> 27:03.860
right, I would still be somebody that would be pretty impressed with, and I

27:03.860 --> 27:10.180
think that keyword is relatable, how she really made politics and politicians

27:10.220 --> 27:15.580
feel relatable and it's, it's ironic that the whole game was called among us

27:15.740 --> 27:18.580
because I'm sure there'd be some people that are gonna make the joke, LOL, she's

27:18.580 --> 27:24.500
an imposter, but I kind of felt she was really among us, you know, and Ilhan Omar

27:24.500 --> 27:24.940
as well.

27:25.100 --> 27:29.980
And even, and if you want to talk about right-leaning versus left-leaning and all

27:30.020 --> 27:34.460
that stuff, uh, during the thing she was talking about, shout out, because I know

27:34.460 --> 27:36.180
other congressional representatives are listening.

27:36.180 --> 27:39.620
She's like, I'm getting text messages from Justin Amash right now, da, da, da, da,

27:39.620 --> 27:43.140
da, and she's like shouting him out and now he's talking about, and he's more

27:43.140 --> 27:47.700
right-leaning, right-leaning, sorry, I can't talk tonight.

27:48.140 --> 27:51.940
Um, but he's talking about setting up some type of Twitch feed.

27:52.140 --> 27:56.420
Now this isn't the first time we've seen politics on Twitch, right?

27:56.620 --> 27:58.540
We know Bernie had a channel.

27:58.620 --> 28:01.820
We know Donald Trump had a channel, had a channel.

28:01.980 --> 28:02.940
I think he might have it back.

28:02.940 --> 28:03.340
I don't know.

28:03.580 --> 28:08.460
But, but all that jokes aside, most of what you would see on both of those

28:08.460 --> 28:11.540
channels, and that's a very left and a very right channel, most of what you would

28:11.540 --> 28:16.780
see on both of those channels were just, eh, simulcasts of rallies, simulcasts of

28:16.780 --> 28:19.940
other events that the news is covering, so on and so on.

28:19.940 --> 28:24.180
What made AOC different and what I very much believe is newsworthy in the game

28:24.180 --> 28:27.660
industry, no matter where you lean politically, what made that stream

28:27.700 --> 28:33.740
interesting was that it was a political event bringing awareness to early voting

28:34.220 --> 28:38.740
that was, that really went into what Twitch is all about.

28:39.180 --> 28:42.780
It was a standing congressional representative, one that gets talked about

28:42.780 --> 28:48.620
an awful lot, uh, getting in there, playing video games, having fun, and

28:48.620 --> 28:50.540
again, that keyword relatable.

28:50.780 --> 28:56.100
And you know, I've said this ever since I dated my ex 10 plus years ago, who you

28:56.100 --> 29:00.020
all met at one point or another, and what, what was the message I took away from

29:00.020 --> 29:00.260
that?

29:00.460 --> 29:02.340
Any idiot can do politics.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.700
If that guy can do it, you can do it.

29:04.700 --> 29:08.940
And I think AOC, I think brought that same message in a much more positive way,

29:09.300 --> 29:13.420
uh, that like, Hey, I like to play video games on Twitch too, and this is

29:13.420 --> 29:16.660
something, you know, you could do if you wanted to get into politics.

29:16.660 --> 29:19.860
I just, I thought that was just rad.

29:19.860 --> 29:23.580
And like Loki said, I thought it was just like a wholesome, positive thing that

29:23.580 --> 29:27.620
didn't get, I mean, sure the chat comments would range from, you know,

29:27.620 --> 29:29.300
wholesome to dumpster fire.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.780
But I just, who's, who has time to reach out in general?

29:32.780 --> 29:37.380
I mean, on a stream who has time to reach out, it's scrolling by so fast.

29:37.500 --> 29:42.260
I'm more into the actual, like, I'm more into the way she's acting when she's like

29:42.260 --> 29:46.060
an imposter and she's like, I don't know if I can, I don't, you know, she's like

29:46.060 --> 29:48.500
super skittish about it and she kills somebody.

29:48.500 --> 29:51.660
She's like, I'm sorry, you know, and like all those things, it's just watching her

29:51.660 --> 29:53.500
go through that was, was really something.

29:53.940 --> 29:58.340
Uh, Jamie, I, I, I, did you catch this by chance or any of the highlight

29:58.340 --> 29:59.460
reels after the fact or anything?

30:00.220 --> 30:02.620
I couldn't because I was working on Project Nunway.

30:02.860 --> 30:03.860
Oh, right, right.

30:04.460 --> 30:09.860
So, um, I sadly had other priorities that needed to be taken care of.

30:09.900 --> 30:17.980
Like, you know, uh, fighting a Google Meet stream with many, many viewers on it.

30:18.700 --> 30:19.180
Fair enough.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.260
Been doing my lines, so sorry.

30:21.380 --> 30:21.980
That's okay.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.380
I read, I read a lot of the tweets about it though.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.940
And I was, she was just really, really cool.

30:26.940 --> 30:28.020
Just in her tweets about it.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.060
I thought it was really cool.

30:29.380 --> 30:29.700
Yeah.

30:30.180 --> 30:33.300
Um, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

30:33.500 --> 30:37.900
Um, as she says, AOC grew up in my hometown and I'm friends with folks

30:37.900 --> 30:39.260
who knew her back in high school.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.180
She was always a hardcore gamer.

30:41.180 --> 30:44.460
She was playing Smash Brothers Melee in the gaming club in high school.

30:44.460 --> 30:45.180
That's pretty cool.

30:45.620 --> 30:49.820
Um, you know, and I, and one of the big takeaways I took and, you know,

30:49.820 --> 30:56.420
I, the reality is, you know, you've got the president doing these big

30:56.420 --> 31:01.020
rallies and people aren't really wearing masks, people aren't really

31:01.020 --> 31:03.500
social distancing, we can all see that.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.900
It's not exactly taking the COVID guidelines seriously

31:07.260 --> 31:08.300
and all that's going on.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.940
And those big events, I mean, they are big and they draw several

31:11.940 --> 31:13.460
thousand people, we know that.

31:14.140 --> 31:18.460
But AOC, interestingly enough, found a way to do a big political

31:18.500 --> 31:24.420
event in a very COVID safe pandemic, safe way, that reached out to a

31:24.420 --> 31:28.260
generation that oftentimes doesn't get targeted with these types of

31:28.260 --> 31:31.460
things and needs to have sometimes that fire lit under their butt to

31:31.460 --> 31:32.620
go vote a little bit, right?

31:32.620 --> 31:37.740
The younger generation and drew in 400,000 plus people while doing it.

31:37.740 --> 31:42.460
So if you think about it, she just put on the biggest political rally

31:42.540 --> 31:44.740
of 2020 on Twitch.

31:45.740 --> 31:49.500
In a way, I realize I'm, I'm logically connecting some big dots there,

31:49.500 --> 31:52.460
but I, I can't help, but find it fascinating.

31:52.700 --> 31:56.300
And like Loki said, I was also kind of glued to the TV.

31:56.420 --> 32:00.340
It was, it was just a good stream because she's also not one of those

32:00.340 --> 32:03.300
streamers that completely gets sidelined with, you know, all the

32:03.300 --> 32:04.620
other stuff going on on Twitch.

32:04.620 --> 32:07.140
She was just in there playing the game, having a good time.

32:07.260 --> 32:12.980
Shane, I've been making you wait, but you love Among Us and I'm sorry,

32:13.340 --> 32:18.580
but what did you, what did you think of the stream?

32:19.940 --> 32:21.260
Oh, I thought it was great.

32:21.540 --> 32:24.940
Like, I don't really know what else to say beyond that.

32:24.940 --> 32:32.980
I thought it was really informative and entertaining and like for what

32:32.980 --> 32:37.460
you could kind of consider a political stream, I didn't feel it was preachy.

32:37.460 --> 32:44.420
And I obviously lean towards her too politically, but like everything

32:44.420 --> 32:50.940
was presented in a way that is not your typical old person politician.

32:51.100 --> 32:57.380
And so it felt like it felt a lot easier to digest and like, okay, yeah,

32:57.380 --> 32:59.620
this is just, this is great.

32:59.700 --> 33:00.340
I loved it.

33:00.660 --> 33:01.940
I watched pretty much all of it.

33:02.300 --> 33:03.500
It wasn't preachy.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.100
You're right.

33:04.100 --> 33:08.020
But definitely there were little things that were being dropped.

33:08.020 --> 33:11.940
Like when she talked to the guy from the UK about healthcare.

33:11.940 --> 33:14.260
And then I think Pokimane was from Canada as well.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.780
So she was kind of talking to them about their experiences with healthcare.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.180
And she was asking all those questions.

33:18.180 --> 33:19.780
She's like, so you can just walk into the doctor.

33:19.780 --> 33:20.220
Wow.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.260
You know, that whole thing.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.460
And she kind of gave her perspective on that.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.260
So, but you're right.

33:25.260 --> 33:29.740
It came off in a way that didn't sound at least to me, but maybe, and to be

33:29.740 --> 33:33.260
fair, maybe it's because yes, I agree with her more than I disagree with her.

33:33.580 --> 33:35.500
But it didn't come off as preachy to me.

33:35.620 --> 33:39.300
I thought it was just an interesting, she's just asking questions from people

33:39.300 --> 33:43.260
around the world, literally trying to get to know her people she's playing with

33:43.260 --> 33:44.460
and, you know, get to know the game.

33:46.260 --> 33:46.460
Yeah.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.940
So, um, uh, no one special is asking in chat.

33:50.300 --> 33:50.620
Okay.

33:50.620 --> 33:51.140
Question.

33:51.140 --> 33:53.980
Normally, if a viewer makes a comment that a streamer doesn't like, they can

33:53.980 --> 33:57.860
purge the comment or timeout ban the viewer, which is all fine and dandy.

33:58.020 --> 34:01.740
Now, since AOC is a politician and Twitch is now serving as an avenue to reach out

34:01.780 --> 34:05.620
to politicians about whatever issue, does purging comments, timeouts, bans, et

34:05.620 --> 34:07.420
cetera, get a little iffy legally?

34:07.660 --> 34:09.020
Um, yes it does actually.

34:09.020 --> 34:10.420
It does get a little iffy legally.

34:10.700 --> 34:15.420
Um, I believe the stream was moderated, but they didn't accept, like if somebody

34:15.420 --> 34:20.660
came in there and wrote a pro Trump thing, I don't think they like legally or would

34:20.660 --> 34:22.860
really have the time to remove it.

34:22.940 --> 34:27.340
I think they just let it sit because, um, and this was a big problem.

34:27.340 --> 34:28.180
You remember that story?

34:28.220 --> 34:32.860
It was about a month ago about the military streaming on Twitch and they

34:32.860 --> 34:36.460
started to ban people who had come in there and asked these questions about,

34:36.460 --> 34:40.020
you know, certain, you know, military thing and all these things asking the

34:40.020 --> 34:44.140
hard questions and the military started like banning people and people like suit

34:44.140 --> 34:45.100
them over that.

34:45.100 --> 34:50.540
So the military has a very like rigid policy on what they do and they don't

34:50.540 --> 34:54.020
allow, but essentially as long as you're not threatening or, you know, do this,

34:54.020 --> 34:57.780
you can go in there and ask about war crimes and stuff and they really can't ban

34:57.780 --> 35:01.700
you. And so I, I think, and I don't really have all the details on how this

35:01.700 --> 35:05.460
works, but I think the way AOC kind of approached her stream was similar.

35:05.460 --> 35:10.380
Like if somebody had said something threatening or extremely gross, I'm sure

35:10.380 --> 35:16.820
it got taken care of, but all the MAGA 2020 spam and all that stuff, it didn't,

35:16.820 --> 35:18.620
they just, you know, what are you going to do?

35:18.660 --> 35:21.860
You, you couldn't ban that stuff fast enough, right?

35:21.980 --> 35:25.940
Well, speak, speaking of spam as you would, please.

35:26.500 --> 35:34.180
Because of the popularity of this AOC driven event and among us, apparently a,

35:34.420 --> 35:43.100
um, a guy by the name of Eris Loris, he went in and hacked among us to spam a

35:43.100 --> 35:50.940
bunch of, uh, messages and cause like this, uh, black screen kind of, um, thing

35:50.940 --> 35:54.820
where the map basically disappears because of it using some bots that he

35:54.820 --> 35:59.140
created. So, you know, stuff, you know, saying like the whole hack your device

35:59.140 --> 36:02.860
or blow up your phone, if you don't subscribe to his channel and then also

36:02.860 --> 36:09.500
Trump 2020 at the end, apparently he, uh, he did cop to that.

36:09.500 --> 36:15.140
He did it and basically said that, you know, he doesn't care that it's a small

36:15.140 --> 36:19.780
company, you know, run by three people that they should have, you know, patch

36:19.780 --> 36:21.580
their game up better or something like that.

36:21.580 --> 36:26.980
And he did it for the, the lols and trolling people because that's what he

36:26.980 --> 36:33.980
does. And apparently, of course, you know, when asked about whether, you know, he

36:33.980 --> 36:37.380
was, you know, he of course added the bit in there because he is a Trump

36:37.380 --> 36:41.540
supporter, but just kind of shows you the con, you know, the contrast between

36:42.220 --> 36:45.540
how, you know, one side will try to get the word out.

36:45.540 --> 36:49.900
And then the other side is just like, Oh, let's, you know, let's spam some, you

36:49.900 --> 36:53.500
know, anger and hatred stuff because I don't like, I don't like something that

36:53.500 --> 36:54.220
you guys did.

36:54.380 --> 36:57.980
Yeah, that whole stunt kind of backfires for your team when you do that, I think.

36:57.980 --> 37:00.100
So, um, not, not great.

37:00.340 --> 37:03.660
And, you know, God, imagine you are the creators of Among Us.

37:03.700 --> 37:08.700
Like, seriously, they created this game two years ago and, you know, it, I'm

37:08.700 --> 37:11.980
sure it did well enough cause they were planning a sequel, but not nearly the

37:11.980 --> 37:13.020
fanfare we're talking about now.

37:13.220 --> 37:17.740
Two years after these three people put out this game, you have a congressional

37:17.740 --> 37:21.420
representative playing it on a Twitch stream to the third largest stream of all

37:21.420 --> 37:21.740
time.

37:22.580 --> 37:28.420
That's crazy in a good way, you know, like just, just how far that game has come.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.060
It's, it's, it's something else.

37:30.260 --> 37:30.860
It's something else.

37:30.900 --> 37:31.100
Yeah.

37:31.100 --> 37:34.100
I basically said, he's all, I was curious to see what would happen.

37:34.100 --> 37:35.540
And personally, I found it funny.

37:35.580 --> 37:38.620
The anger and hatred is part of what makes it funny.

37:39.140 --> 37:44.420
If you care about a game and are willing to go and spam dislikes, some, um, random

37:44.420 --> 37:47.380
dueling internet, because you can't play it for three minutes, it's stupid.

37:48.740 --> 37:53.540
So anyway, um, it's, it's sad that that is happening when Among Us probably doesn't

37:53.540 --> 37:57.900
have the staff to be able to handle that fast enough, but I'm, I'm sure they will

37:57.900 --> 38:03.700
get some help, but it's gonna be, it's gonna be bumpy as people choose to, uh, do

38:03.700 --> 38:06.420
these types of stunts to pick on them or whatever it is they're doing.

38:06.420 --> 38:07.260
It's, it's silly.

38:07.780 --> 38:12.220
Um, Shane, I, I know you've been playing just a crap ton of Among Us and you were

38:12.220 --> 38:13.060
really into this game.

38:13.060 --> 38:15.940
What is it about this game that you enjoy and, and tell us about kind of like what

38:15.940 --> 38:18.180
you've been doing because you've been playing on streams and stuff too, right?

38:19.060 --> 38:20.980
Yeah, I've been playing with some friends.

38:21.060 --> 38:27.740
Um, so I think my first way to describe it, which is like the best way I can, or

38:27.740 --> 38:32.780
like, uh, yeah, the best way I can describe it is it's as close to playing real life

38:32.780 --> 38:35.620
Danganronpa as I'm ever probably going to get.

38:36.820 --> 38:38.500
Um, that's pretty cool.

38:38.780 --> 38:41.260
I actually, that's a very apt description.

38:41.780 --> 38:42.180
Yeah.

38:42.940 --> 38:45.060
I, without pink blood.

38:45.620 --> 38:52.100
Yeah, no pink blood, but like you all gather around like a little table at, you

38:52.100 --> 38:54.780
know, after every, after somebody dies and you'd talk about it.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.580
But, um, I don't know.

38:56.620 --> 39:04.460
I like, I like being sneaky and murdering people while also convincing them I didn't

39:04.460 --> 39:08.500
do it and making other people argue.

39:08.660 --> 39:13.340
Like it's my game that it's just like what I want to do in real life.

39:13.340 --> 39:16.340
Basically, so I don't know.

39:16.340 --> 39:16.940
It's great.

39:16.940 --> 39:19.340
Like last night I had a few rounds.

39:19.340 --> 39:24.300
I had, I got to be imposter back to back and, Oh, I killed so many people

39:24.660 --> 39:26.660
and nobody ever suspected me.

39:26.820 --> 39:31.940
And I just, I kind of shut my mouth, let every, all the, the louder people talk.

39:32.780 --> 39:35.420
They kicked each other out the airlock and then I just went

39:35.420 --> 39:36.700
and I killed more people.

39:36.700 --> 39:37.580
It was great.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.580
It's just fun.

39:39.900 --> 39:44.100
And the best part is for me is I'm playing right now with a group of people

39:44.100 --> 39:45.580
that don't get mad about the game.

39:45.580 --> 39:50.940
Like we may get loud during the, like during the discussion times, but after

39:50.940 --> 39:55.860
like we either win or lose, like we're all just laughing and like congratulating

39:55.860 --> 39:58.620
each other and, and just, it's fun.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.700
Like you cannot play with randoms.

40:00.700 --> 40:02.100
Do not play with randoms.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.260
If you're playing the game, it will take all the fun out of it.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.300
Play with people, you know.

40:07.380 --> 40:07.820
All right.

40:07.860 --> 40:09.780
So, uh, let me get some comments from chat.

40:09.780 --> 40:14.340
So, um, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Shane is deep down a chaos monster.

40:14.580 --> 40:15.020
True.

40:15.100 --> 40:16.300
Oh, deep down.

40:16.300 --> 40:17.260
No, that's pretty outward.

40:19.900 --> 40:25.740
Uh, act Defton chat says, act Defton chat says to this day, I haven't played

40:25.740 --> 40:30.300
among us, not even once, but I've seen a lot of videos and streams of people

40:30.300 --> 40:34.580
playing it same, I'm almost afraid to play it at this point because I'm not

40:34.580 --> 40:35.540
going to know what I'm doing.

40:35.540 --> 40:37.420
And so many people have played this game.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.300
Like they're going to be like, where'd you find the body?

40:39.540 --> 40:40.620
I don't know.

40:40.660 --> 40:44.380
Like I was, so I'm still technically new at it.

40:44.420 --> 40:48.980
I forget the names of locations all the time, but you know, like, Oh, I'm

40:48.980 --> 40:52.140
in the upper left side of the map and like, yeah, I don't think, I don't

40:52.140 --> 40:53.860
think it matters about our engine.

40:53.860 --> 40:54.780
I'm like, sure.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.300
Yeah, that's exactly where I'm at.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.260
And I'm usually telling the truth about that.

40:58.260 --> 40:58.980
Cause I just don't.

41:01.500 --> 41:05.420
So I, and this is another game where Shane has been trying to use his power

41:05.420 --> 41:08.900
of persuasion on me and honestly, I'm not exactly resisting, like I'm

41:08.900 --> 41:10.300
not opposed to playing among us.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.700
I just, it has to be kind of like the right time in the right environment.

41:13.700 --> 41:17.900
But so Shane, some things he keeps asking me when we're going to play.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.420
Cause he wants to play with us.

41:19.460 --> 41:21.980
Cause he keeps asking me to play with him, but.

41:22.500 --> 41:24.900
Um, there's not a lot of people that want to play.

41:25.340 --> 41:25.860
All right.

41:25.860 --> 41:26.820
My niece plays it.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.580
She's yeah, she's like a little kid.

41:28.620 --> 41:29.300
They love it.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.460
I'm like, wow.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.300
So, so Shane pay attention.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.100
Cause some things are starting to come together here.

41:34.100 --> 41:34.540
Okay.

41:34.620 --> 41:35.300
Listen to this.

41:35.740 --> 41:39.780
Black and Pat and chat says, I haven't been able to get a group together to play

41:39.780 --> 41:41.980
or been invited to play on anyone's stream.

41:42.300 --> 41:42.700
Hmm.

41:43.220 --> 41:44.220
Uh, let's see.

41:44.300 --> 41:50.700
SSU 100 Matt says, so VOG game night among us when, um, pod culture says,

41:50.740 --> 41:53.900
have yet to play it, let's get a VOG group together.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.700
Hmm.

41:55.900 --> 41:56.780
Hmm.

41:57.020 --> 41:58.620
So maybe let's do it.

41:58.780 --> 41:59.300
Let's do it.

42:00.500 --> 42:04.740
As long as everybody's cool and not going to yell at each other for real and not

42:04.740 --> 42:07.700
hold grudges, it's totally a fun game to play.

42:08.060 --> 42:08.500
All right.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.780
So we'll have a VOG among us night in the coming days.

42:11.780 --> 42:16.900
So stay tuned, Black and Pat for your invite and a who a pod culture and so

42:16.900 --> 42:20.860
forth, uh, stay tuned cause we'll want to dev definitely, uh, all those folks.

42:20.860 --> 42:23.740
I just named, we want to get involved with that, uh, type of thing.

42:23.860 --> 42:27.260
And, uh, you know, rule number one, just fucking be cool about it.

42:30.020 --> 42:30.940
It's rule number one.

42:31.340 --> 42:31.700
All right.

42:31.860 --> 42:32.060
Yeah.

42:32.100 --> 42:36.260
Sometimes the games go like the, one of the last games we played last night,

42:36.940 --> 42:38.860
one person got seen venting.

42:38.860 --> 42:41.620
So we knew exactly that person was going to get kicked off.

42:42.140 --> 42:45.180
And then the other person was trying to vouch for them.

42:45.220 --> 42:48.260
They're like, no, you can't, we literally saw the event.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.660
So the game lasted like two minutes.

42:51.340 --> 42:52.580
So what are you going to do?

42:55.100 --> 42:58.660
And it happens, but the nice thing is you don't just play one round.

42:58.660 --> 43:00.740
Do you play like 10 rounds in a night?

43:00.740 --> 43:04.340
And so, you know, you'd, you'd, you'd be able to brush it off at some point.

43:05.180 --> 43:05.420
Yep.

43:05.940 --> 43:07.540
It's probably a great time.

43:07.820 --> 43:12.340
Well, if you want to get in on the action with among us, um, let's, uh, we'll set

43:12.340 --> 43:16.260
something up on our discord channels, uh, discord, so stay tuned, uh, over at

43:16.260 --> 43:21.820
vognetwork.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord, uh, stay tuned and we'll try to

43:21.820 --> 43:25.180
put something together for the coming weeks at some point here, I know with this

43:25.180 --> 43:27.100
week being Halloween, there's probably a lot of stuff going on.

43:27.340 --> 43:31.180
We'll try to get something Saturday.

43:31.220 --> 43:31.580
Yeah.

43:31.580 --> 43:34.740
But you know, people will be doing stuff throughout the week, uh, hopefully

43:34.740 --> 43:38.620
virtually, but I do know there's a lot of outdoor type of art events and drive

43:38.620 --> 43:40.180
through things and stuff going on.

43:40.180 --> 43:43.860
So, you know, people are making the 2020 thing work, so, uh, we'll make it work.

43:44.180 --> 43:44.500
Anyway.

43:44.700 --> 43:48.300
Um, Shane, you've been holding that iPad above your head for so long now.

43:48.300 --> 43:49.220
So thank you for doing that.

43:49.220 --> 43:50.620
I know you're fatigued and have COVID.

43:50.620 --> 43:51.220
I know you're sick.

43:51.620 --> 43:53.380
Uh, please feel better.

43:53.380 --> 43:58.260
And everybody in chat, as well as here in the, the, the chat here, uh, definitely

43:58.260 --> 44:00.900
wish you feel better and do better and all that.

44:00.900 --> 44:04.020
And the good news is you, you have been getting better as the days go on.

44:04.020 --> 44:04.940
It's just slow, right?

44:05.620 --> 44:05.940
Yeah.

44:06.100 --> 44:06.420
Yeah.

44:06.420 --> 44:06.660
Yeah.

44:06.660 --> 44:11.620
I'm kind of feeling like I'm plateauing now, but it's not as bad as it was to

44:11.620 --> 44:12.140
start.

44:12.260 --> 44:13.780
And so I can't complain.

44:14.180 --> 44:14.540
All right.

44:14.740 --> 44:17.460
Um, anything else on any games or anything you want to share with us

44:17.660 --> 44:18.780
tonight before we let you go?

44:19.780 --> 44:22.500
As always, everybody needs to play the game of the year.

44:22.500 --> 44:23.260
Hades.

44:23.780 --> 44:24.780
It's the best.

44:25.220 --> 44:26.260
I forgot to ask you about that.

44:26.780 --> 44:27.860
I haven't started it yet.

44:28.580 --> 44:30.140
Oh, it's so good.

44:30.220 --> 44:32.540
It's just so good.

44:32.580 --> 44:35.460
Quick, quick update on how Hades is going for you.

44:35.460 --> 44:37.900
Somebody in chat asks, like, why hasn't Shane brought Hades up?

44:37.900 --> 44:40.220
I forgot to get back to, we just had so much other stuff to talk about.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.980
I would never not bring Hades up.

44:41.980 --> 44:42.780
So it's okay.

44:43.100 --> 44:43.620
Don't worry.

44:44.340 --> 44:48.340
Um, I romance the character I wanted to.

44:48.580 --> 44:49.660
That was awesome.

44:49.740 --> 44:53.500
I've unlocked a few weapon aspects.

44:53.660 --> 45:00.540
I still have not got the prologue, but to be fair, the past week I've not really

45:00.540 --> 45:06.900
been playing, um, because of the fatigue, like holding a controller for a long

45:06.900 --> 45:08.980
period of time, just kind of wears on me.

45:09.300 --> 45:13.300
Like even Pokemon I've not like, even though I'm playing it a lot, it's easy

45:13.300 --> 45:17.060
because I can set a command, put down the controller for a minute, then pick it back

45:17.100 --> 45:21.580
up or even just rest the controller on my desk and do it.

45:21.620 --> 45:24.620
But, um, no, Hades has gone great.

45:25.140 --> 45:28.740
I'm technically almost done in quote marks, but that game is so good.

45:28.740 --> 45:29.900
I won't ever be done.

45:30.260 --> 45:30.700
All right.

45:31.460 --> 45:31.780
All right.

45:31.820 --> 45:35.020
Well, we're going to let you go and move on with the rest of our gaming weeks,

45:35.020 --> 45:36.100
but, um, have a good one.

45:36.100 --> 45:36.620
Feel better.

45:36.620 --> 45:39.660
Check in and chat in the next week or two and let us know how you're doing.

45:39.660 --> 45:39.980
Okay.

45:40.900 --> 45:41.300
Okay.

45:41.380 --> 45:41.660
All right.

45:41.660 --> 45:41.980
Bye.

45:42.260 --> 45:42.900
Kick me out.

45:43.900 --> 45:44.060
All right.

45:44.980 --> 45:46.020
Can someone click and dry?

45:46.020 --> 45:46.900
I can't do it because I'm on my phone.

45:46.900 --> 45:48.500
Can someone just drag him out of the channel somewhere else?

45:48.540 --> 45:48.820
All right.

45:49.500 --> 45:49.780
Bye.

45:50.060 --> 45:50.660
Uh, all right.

45:50.700 --> 45:53.740
Uh, so we're going to, uh, shift gears into the rest of our gaming

45:53.740 --> 45:55.220
weeks here and get into that.

45:55.220 --> 45:57.460
So, uh, dark soccer, why don't you start us off?

45:57.460 --> 45:58.540
How was your gaming week?

45:58.540 --> 45:59.580
What have you been playing this week?

46:00.220 --> 46:04.100
I've only had time for animal crossing to be perfectly honest, just because of

46:04.100 --> 46:06.820
project, uh, none way, which was a success.

46:07.140 --> 46:10.420
We're still taking donations and the videos are going to be up at

46:10.420 --> 46:12.020
capital city sisters.org.

46:12.340 --> 46:16.980
So you can see me walk the runway looking really thrifty.

46:17.620 --> 46:23.460
Um, but, uh, other than that, it's really just been time for animal crossing a

46:23.460 --> 46:27.500
little bit, um, doing lots of video editing, lots of audio editing.

46:28.140 --> 46:32.060
Um, and, uh, God was playing something else.

46:32.500 --> 46:36.740
I am back to word scapes just to try to keep my brain active, but I do have

46:36.740 --> 46:41.340
Hades and I am going to be playing it probably during the next week.

46:41.380 --> 46:44.580
Cause I don't really have many projects right now.

46:44.620 --> 46:47.380
Um, I'm taking November off of projects.

46:47.980 --> 46:53.140
Um, and I'm actually plan well, other than, other than my, my blog at, uh,

46:53.180 --> 47:00.420
Gen X geeks with an X, um, but I'm, uh, I'm going to be, uh, getting my streaming

47:00.460 --> 47:03.740
going starting in November and I still want to do that charity stream.

47:03.740 --> 47:08.540
So when I'm gaming, I'll let people know right now, real life has intruded.

47:08.900 --> 47:09.420
All right.

47:10.260 --> 47:11.420
Sounds good for now.

47:11.660 --> 47:13.860
I hope the event is, continues to be a big success.

47:13.860 --> 47:16.020
Cause you can like still do watch it online and stuff.

47:16.020 --> 47:16.340
Right.

47:16.980 --> 47:22.100
Um, well, uh, we had trouble with it because they decided to use Google

47:22.100 --> 47:26.380
meet for it, um, uh, instead of a streaming service, cause I put a lot of

47:26.380 --> 47:30.220
work into the video, the video is going to be up and if people want it, just

47:30.220 --> 47:31.700
ask me about it, I'll try to get it to you.

47:31.860 --> 47:38.020
Um, but, um, it should hopefully be up by, uh, in Monday evening, um, on

47:38.260 --> 47:40.060
capital city sisters.org.

47:40.780 --> 47:44.180
Um, but, uh, I, we actually did get something else.

47:44.180 --> 47:47.900
I don't know if I mentioned it before, but we got the new Jersey Jack

47:47.900 --> 47:49.380
pirates of the Caribbean pinball.

47:49.380 --> 47:51.060
And so I actually did play some of that.

47:51.540 --> 47:53.380
Very loud, very fun.

47:53.780 --> 47:55.540
Lots of, lots of modes.

47:55.540 --> 47:59.060
It's pretty nuts, but the Jersey Jack games are pretty, pretty tops.

47:59.620 --> 48:04.820
Um, Hindemith 1980, or excuse me, 1895 in chat says in response to, uh, what you

48:04.980 --> 48:08.420
were saying, dark soccer, no projects, November.

48:10.220 --> 48:14.740
Well, I might do, um, novel writing month, but it's more or less just a

48:14.740 --> 48:20.820
catalyst to actually get my ass in gear to put this world that I've built in on

48:20.820 --> 48:22.020
to quote paper.

48:22.500 --> 48:26.020
Um, I am working on an urban fantasy novel.

48:26.020 --> 48:27.100
Well, not really a novel.

48:27.100 --> 48:28.340
I'm going to do it as a serial.

48:28.820 --> 48:33.300
And it's, uh, when I get everything out and get everything ready to go, it's

48:33.300 --> 48:38.820
going to be available through, uh, the Apple bookstore and, uh, uh, for Kindle.

48:38.980 --> 48:43.540
Soon as I get all my, my ducks in a row, there'll be more about that, but I'm

48:43.540 --> 48:44.100
announcing it here.

48:44.100 --> 48:49.740
Now I'm writing a book, a serial serial series, not not Remo or whatever they call

48:49.740 --> 48:54.940
it, not no national novel writing month, but I'm, I'm only using that as a

48:54.940 --> 48:55.540
catalyst.

48:56.380 --> 48:58.340
Um, I'm not doing a full novel.

48:58.340 --> 49:00.260
I'm doing them as, as, as serial series.

49:00.620 --> 49:06.740
I've also heard of non no pod Mo, which is, uh, do a podcast every day for a month.

49:06.780 --> 49:09.620
Um, I know I've heard of that.

49:09.620 --> 49:13.740
I know I've thought about participating, but, um, that's a lot of podcasts and it

49:13.740 --> 49:14.860
would have to be a separate feed.

49:14.860 --> 49:17.340
Cause I like, it's not going to happen on a well or anything like that.

49:17.740 --> 49:20.980
Um, but like, just like a personal thing, but I don't know if I would have put it

49:20.980 --> 49:21.780
together that fast.

49:21.780 --> 49:22.140
We'll see.

49:23.020 --> 49:28.060
No, I, I don't think I could do anything like that with a lot of, you know, a lot

49:28.060 --> 49:29.100
of crap.

49:29.100 --> 49:32.460
And tiger call says that I'm going to be a superstar author and my books are going

49:32.460 --> 49:33.660
to get turned into movies.

49:34.220 --> 49:38.380
Um, you don't want to know the weird shit that goes in my head that I'm thinking

49:38.380 --> 49:39.660
about putting into a book.

49:40.300 --> 49:48.860
Um, but I, I, I will tell people that the, the apocalypse is not what you think it

49:48.860 --> 49:49.220
is.

49:49.820 --> 49:52.500
You can, we can be living through one right now.

49:52.580 --> 49:56.060
The it's not, it's not at all what people think it is.

49:56.420 --> 50:02.060
Post-apocalyptic is a genre for a different world.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.820
You know, it don't, don't take that.

50:06.380 --> 50:08.860
Why would I write a Garris Spock fanfic?

50:08.900 --> 50:11.220
That's not a novel.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.060
I do not write slash.

50:13.340 --> 50:13.700
Okay.

50:13.980 --> 50:18.860
I don't, um, I, I, I'm asexual.

50:18.860 --> 50:20.140
I don't like writing that stuff.

50:20.300 --> 50:25.900
Um, but anyway, um, but I'll have more about it as stuff comes out.

50:25.900 --> 50:27.260
There'll be, there'll be things.

50:27.260 --> 50:30.340
And of course I'll blog about it because I blog about every fucking thing now.

50:31.700 --> 50:32.820
All right, fair enough.

50:33.220 --> 50:34.220
Well, let's move on to Loki.

50:34.220 --> 50:35.260
Loki, how was your gaming week?

50:36.300 --> 50:38.060
Uh, well, let's see.

50:38.060 --> 50:44.780
My gaming week was not playing games and it was just, uh, working on my game.

50:45.180 --> 50:47.100
And that's pretty much what's going on.

50:47.100 --> 50:48.180
I'm still not working.

50:48.220 --> 50:49.340
It's still not working.

50:49.940 --> 50:51.980
It's just frustrating me so much.

50:52.140 --> 50:57.700
So I've been working on, um, a random spawning generator and I've run into

50:57.700 --> 51:05.020
issues still in a fight for the last five days, so that that's been my week.

51:05.060 --> 51:12.500
Um, I played Samorna as well, but, um, mostly just working on coding the entire

51:12.700 --> 51:17.700
time, fair enough fighting, uh, it should be simple, but it's not working.

51:18.060 --> 51:21.940
I look forward, um, to when we can finally play this game.

51:21.940 --> 51:22.740
So I'm excited.

51:22.740 --> 51:22.940
Yep.

51:23.180 --> 51:23.660
All right.

51:23.780 --> 51:25.660
Uh, good luck with all the bumps in the road.

51:26.060 --> 51:30.940
Um, so my gaming week, um, has been kind of, you know, a same Z as previous weeks.

51:30.940 --> 51:31.860
We already talked about, wow.

51:31.860 --> 51:34.060
I already mentioned that Final Fantasy 14 still going.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.260
This was the week.

51:35.260 --> 51:41.020
So a couple nights ago, I finally hit level 80 max level level cap on every

51:41.020 --> 51:43.220
single crafting and gathering class.

51:43.460 --> 51:47.820
So there's like eight crafting classes, alchemy, carpentry, and so on.

51:47.820 --> 51:48.420
Those types of things.

51:48.620 --> 51:51.420
And then three gathering classes, fishing, botany, mining.

51:51.700 --> 51:53.100
I hit 80 in all of them.

51:53.100 --> 51:55.180
So, and what do I get for that?

51:57.180 --> 51:58.020
I feel real good.

51:59.140 --> 51:59.980
Ooh, I hope so.

52:00.100 --> 52:03.380
Cause I actually like candy corn on your, on your doorstep.

52:03.420 --> 52:07.140
Someone posted turkey dinner, candy corn, and I was, I was alarmed.

52:07.300 --> 52:10.660
I don't know about that, but they, they do like the maple candy corn.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.420
They have like other flavors this time of year.

52:12.740 --> 52:15.580
I like, I like the candy everybody hates.

52:15.620 --> 52:18.580
I like black jelly beans cause I like licorice.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.580
I like, I like it.

52:21.580 --> 52:22.340
I'm sorry.

52:22.340 --> 52:22.980
Not sorry.

52:22.980 --> 52:26.620
You and Dan can have all of that, but maybe I'll make candy

52:26.620 --> 52:28.020
corn cookies again this year.

52:28.060 --> 52:32.500
They're, they're kind of hard to do because the candy, uh, crystallizes,

52:32.500 --> 52:35.500
you know, into sheet candy if it's exposed out of the dough.

52:36.180 --> 52:37.580
So we'll see what happens.

52:38.140 --> 52:40.740
You know, the other thing, I know you're going to hate this Jamie plug your ears.

52:40.740 --> 52:43.700
I'm sorry, but the other big, big candy that I love that everybody

52:43.700 --> 52:46.580
hates, circus peanuts, love them.

52:47.580 --> 52:48.260
They're great.

52:48.260 --> 52:49.980
You, you can have them.

52:50.020 --> 52:50.420
Okay.

52:50.420 --> 52:50.660
Yeah.

52:50.700 --> 52:53.620
Just don't eat them in front of me because I will vomit.

52:54.260 --> 52:56.700
I would honestly have those than like a Hershey's bar.

52:56.700 --> 52:57.060
Really?

52:57.060 --> 52:58.060
I, anyway.

52:58.100 --> 52:58.460
All right.

52:58.900 --> 53:00.220
That's so there you go.

53:00.220 --> 53:01.020
Happy Halloween.

53:01.020 --> 53:02.940
I will get you peeps and that's all you get.

53:04.460 --> 53:04.860
All right.

53:05.180 --> 53:06.420
Uh, let's see.

53:06.460 --> 53:10.340
Um, so also for my gaming week, uh, I've been playing.

53:10.380 --> 53:11.820
So there was a couple new things.

53:12.100 --> 53:16.220
Um, I played that demo, so I guess I'm going to talk about this.

53:16.220 --> 53:18.260
I don't think I actually put this item in our news, but I'll

53:18.260 --> 53:19.340
talk about it a little early.

53:19.620 --> 53:23.140
So Google Stadia had a big thing, and I know that's coming up later in the

53:23.140 --> 53:26.740
news, uh, an event where they were talking about some new things that are coming.

53:26.940 --> 53:30.780
And one of the things they talked about was a Pac-Man style battle

53:30.780 --> 53:34.540
Royale game that's coming out first on Stadia and there's a demo.

53:34.540 --> 53:38.340
You can actually play online right now and you can check it out.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.940
And so I was like, eh, why not?

53:39.940 --> 53:40.820
I'm going to go check it out.

53:40.820 --> 53:44.740
So I played it a little bit and it seems to be a pretty feature filled

53:44.740 --> 53:48.580
demo, meaning you can pretty much play a match start to finish.

53:48.740 --> 53:52.060
I don't know what, I'm assuming the full game will have more

53:52.060 --> 53:53.700
customizations and other things you do.

53:53.900 --> 53:55.660
And I know the demo is also time limited.

53:55.660 --> 53:57.620
Like you can do it until October 27th.

53:57.820 --> 54:02.460
So I feel like, cause I don't always love to talk about demos as a review,

54:02.460 --> 54:06.260
but I do feel like this demo is intentionally set up to be pretty full featured.

54:06.660 --> 54:10.260
Um, it's not good.

54:11.660 --> 54:12.300
It's not fun.

54:12.620 --> 54:16.100
Um, it's, it's Pac-Man.

54:16.140 --> 54:18.940
Um, it's, it's here's, here's the problem with it.

54:19.100 --> 54:20.540
Like Pac-Man is a good game.

54:20.700 --> 54:21.420
That's fine.

54:21.700 --> 54:25.860
But look at how Pac-Man's really evolved over the years.

54:25.900 --> 54:26.300
Right.

54:26.540 --> 54:29.740
And the last few releases in the Pac-Man universe have been things like

54:29.940 --> 54:34.580
Pac-Man championship, Pac-Man championship edition, uh, Pac-Man championship

54:34.620 --> 54:37.540
edition two, those games are pretty fun.

54:37.580 --> 54:38.820
Uh, the music's great.

54:38.980 --> 54:40.340
They're pretty fast paced.

54:40.500 --> 54:41.500
It's intense.

54:41.620 --> 54:42.620
They're fun to play.

54:42.900 --> 54:46.580
Um, this Pac-Man tunnel battle royale thing, whatever it's called.

54:46.580 --> 54:47.500
I don't even remember the name of it.

54:47.780 --> 54:49.420
It's you, you here's the thing.

54:49.460 --> 54:52.540
I'm not even sure I understand what the fuck's going on, which

54:52.540 --> 54:53.780
is one problem I have with it.

54:54.220 --> 54:57.500
Um, but basically you're playing Pac-Man.

54:58.140 --> 55:00.340
Um, it's cartoony.

55:00.340 --> 55:01.020
It's cute.

55:01.020 --> 55:02.620
You can customize a lot.

55:02.620 --> 55:03.740
I guess that's a plus.

55:04.340 --> 55:10.300
Um, but the whole catch is you can open up the gates and instead of doing a

55:10.300 --> 55:14.660
tunnel to the other side of your map, you do a tunnel into someone else's map.

55:15.700 --> 55:17.380
I don't know why.

55:17.420 --> 55:22.100
I mean, you, you, I guess technically can eat a power pellet and try to kill them.

55:22.460 --> 55:27.140
Um, you can also take points and, and ghosts and stuff away from them.

55:27.460 --> 55:31.420
Um, but it's just, it's not interesting at all.

55:31.860 --> 55:33.660
It's just, it's not.

55:33.940 --> 55:38.980
Um, they tried to put some more power ups in the game to, uh, mix it up a little bit,

55:38.980 --> 55:42.620
like something that will make ghosts repel from you and do you see it?

55:43.180 --> 55:46.660
It's re it's a step backwards for Pac-Man.

55:47.060 --> 55:50.340
And I'm going to tell you what I've come on this show and talked about.

55:50.660 --> 55:52.260
I like Pac-Man championship edition.

55:52.300 --> 55:57.100
I liked Pac-Man chip addition to a lot more than most reviewers did.

55:57.180 --> 56:01.420
As much as the random ghost train on rail thing kind of bugged me too.

56:01.820 --> 56:06.660
I, I felt the style and substance and the way it kind of changed the game and, and the,

56:06.660 --> 56:09.260
the, the kind of the, just the joy I get out of playing it.

56:09.380 --> 56:12.620
I kind of felt balanced out some of those things here.

56:13.060 --> 56:18.060
It was just not interesting at all.

56:19.580 --> 56:20.860
I don't know what else to say.

56:21.300 --> 56:27.060
Like, um, let's see, I'm looking in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

56:27.260 --> 56:31.220
And, uh, Bobby is talking about if you take just the technology of the streaming 4k

56:31.220 --> 56:34.580
with low latency and that wifi controller, Stadia is amazing and wonderful.

56:34.580 --> 56:37.460
The problem is the service that is Stadia negates all the great tech.

56:37.660 --> 56:43.580
I got to admit it played all right, but it didn't, it didn't play as well as when I

56:43.580 --> 56:45.380
was playing like destiny two and stuff.

56:45.580 --> 56:50.860
It, I, I was getting more, more artifacting on fucking Pac-Man than I was when I was

56:50.860 --> 56:51.820
playing like destiny.

56:51.980 --> 56:55.540
Maybe that's just the nature of my connection today or what have you.

56:55.540 --> 56:59.100
I don't know if Alan was streaming something at the same time or what, but it

56:59.100 --> 57:00.660
just, wow.

57:01.140 --> 57:05.740
Uh, Questbuster says, I spectated a few games of that on Stadia and it was more

57:05.740 --> 57:06.340
Pac-Man.

57:06.740 --> 57:08.700
I didn't really feel compelled to play it though.

57:08.860 --> 57:10.100
Exactly.

57:10.540 --> 57:14.020
Here's, here's, here's the thing, and here's why I'm so negative on it.

57:16.060 --> 57:22.020
Is that obviously when we heard about this, we saw, Oh, it's Pac-Man, but it's a

57:22.020 --> 57:23.020
battle royale.

57:25.620 --> 57:26.340
That's it.

57:27.580 --> 57:28.700
That's what they did.

57:29.100 --> 57:36.340
I got nothing like it's, it's, it's, it's the most basic ass fucking game.

57:36.460 --> 57:39.660
If pumpkin spice were a video game, it would be this.

57:40.540 --> 57:42.460
That is how basic it is.

57:42.580 --> 57:44.220
But you like pumpkin spice.

57:44.300 --> 57:44.740
That's right.

57:44.740 --> 57:51.700
I like, I usually will defend pumpkin spice, but I can't, it's just, it's really

57:51.700 --> 57:52.940
bad you guys.

57:53.620 --> 57:54.740
And this is a demo.

57:54.900 --> 57:57.980
This is what they're trying to put out to save Stadia.

57:59.100 --> 58:02.740
Should we start playing Taps already?

58:03.100 --> 58:04.660
Uh, wait till the next segment.

58:04.980 --> 58:10.940
Um, but, uh, yeah, so that was, that was the Pac-Man game.

58:10.940 --> 58:11.460
I'm sorry.

58:11.460 --> 58:14.340
I, I really want to love the game cause I loved Pac-Man.

58:14.340 --> 58:16.060
I just don't, it's not good.

58:16.540 --> 58:17.700
Um, okay.

58:17.740 --> 58:21.260
Uh, so let's see what else, uh, did I play this week?

58:21.260 --> 58:24.980
I felt like there was one other game, but I'm so, so bent on that out of shape on

58:24.980 --> 58:25.420
that game.

58:25.420 --> 58:26.580
I can't even remember what it was.

58:26.700 --> 58:27.980
I did play a little more Hades.

58:28.020 --> 58:29.100
Oh, I know the game.

58:29.740 --> 58:35.460
Um, I went into the Super Nintendo emulator on, uh, the official one on the

58:35.460 --> 58:39.460
Switch, Nintendo online, and I started playing Mario's P-Cross.

58:40.100 --> 58:44.300
Because P-Cross is very Zen and relaxing and kind of fun.

58:44.660 --> 58:46.660
Um, and I, I enjoy it.

58:46.660 --> 58:52.580
So, uh, I played, I played all of round one on the Mario side, a plot twist,

58:52.740 --> 58:53.860
minor spoiler alert.

58:54.100 --> 58:55.260
So I did all of that.

58:55.380 --> 58:57.460
So, uh, and that was more fun than Pac-Man.

58:57.940 --> 59:00.620
All right, let's get into some news.

59:00.620 --> 59:02.780
I don't think I have anything else to discuss.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.580
Uh, that's about it.

59:04.860 --> 59:09.060
So let's get into, uh, what else is going on in the gaming world in the news.

59:09.060 --> 59:11.140
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

59:11.820 --> 59:15.220
Yes, let's, let's talk about some more stadia stuff.

59:15.260 --> 59:22.620
So, um, there was an interesting tweet exchanges, uh, going on with the creative

59:22.620 --> 59:29.260
director at Typhoon studios, Alex Hutchinson, who has, um, of course their

59:29.260 --> 59:35.500
studio was bought by Google's, um, by Google last year and is actually making

59:35.500 --> 59:36.380
stadia games.

59:36.940 --> 59:41.540
He, um, brought the wonderful hot take that, you know, what talking about, you

59:41.540 --> 59:45.420
know, all these DMCA things that are going on with, uh, the music and stuff on

59:45.420 --> 59:45.900
Twitch.

59:46.340 --> 59:50.820
Um, he also brought up the thing saying, Hey, streamers worried about getting

59:51.060 --> 59:55.340
their content pulled because they use music and didn't pay for, uh, should be

59:55.340 --> 59:58.740
more worried by the fact that they're streaming games that didn't pay for as

59:58.740 --> 59:59.180
well.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.180
It's all gone.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.820
As soon as the publisher decides to enforce it, the real truth is streamers

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.460
should be paying the developers and publishers of the games they stream.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:12.260
They should be buying a license like any real business and pay for the content

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:12.780
they use.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.820
Well, of course that was received very well by everybody and no one had any

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.500
issues with it.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:24.540
Of course, um, everybody had issues with it and, uh, there's a lot of

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.780
interesting feedback.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:32.180
This is also the same guy that, uh, was complaining a while back about how he

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:37.700
felt that Japanese games get kind of a pass by media outlets when they're,

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.580
um, reviewing them versus, um, American games.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:45.540
Cause he was the creative director at, on Assassin's Creed three at one time.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:46.820
As well.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:51.900
Um, you know, comparing his games to, you know, basically like, um, super

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.260
Mario brothers or stuff like that.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.380
He's all, why did they get to make games in the same thing?

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.660
And people just kind of love those.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:03.740
It must be because there's some sort of, uh, subtle racism in the business

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.180
on the journalist side.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.540
So yeah, he's full of hot takes.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.780
Uh, of course, no, nobody liked it.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:15.340
Um, no, no, but you sound like a telltale game.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.300
It just popped up in the corner.

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:17.540
Nobody liked that.

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:18.860
Yeah.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.140
So Google, of course, you know, basically saying, Hey, uh, the recent

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.380
tweets by Alex Hutchinson, creative director at Montreal studio of

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.820
stadia games entertainment.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.180
Do not reflect those of stadia YouTube or Google.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.620
Yeah, but you know why he's, he's representing a company.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:38.980
He's one of your, and he kind of missed, I don't want, I don't know if

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.780
you'd say he misrepresented himself.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.180
I kind of think that's a accurate way to say it, but, um,

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:45.900
let's see.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:51.580
So it says, uh, creative director at S S G and E Montreal studio is what

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:55.180
it says now, but that's not what it said before it said creative

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.700
director at, uh, Google stadia.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.020
Is what it said before.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:02.540
Yeah.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.220
So, so he changed it there.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:05.660
Yeah.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:11.020
I mean, so the kind of pick it apart, obviously it's a weird take from

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:15.980
somebody that's making stadia games on a device that literally one of the

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:20.900
features that, Hey, you can stream your games on YouTube straight out of,

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.460
straight up using the service.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.420
It's like, what are you doing?

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:32.380
I mean, as it is, it's hard enough to sell stadia as like a device that

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:36.700
people want to use because of their service and just the way it's structured.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.620
It's not very good.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.020
Yeah.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:42.500
And now you have somebody that's like, you know, you should be

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.300
paying us because we're so good.

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.100
I'm sorry.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.580
No, no, that's not it.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:52.180
I understand the argument, but it's also, you know, it's a bad take.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:57.700
It's just like, there's a lot of companies right now, especially with

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:02.140
like, you know, the new X-Box and the new PlayStation systems coming out

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:07.180
that they're engaging with streamers to get the hype out about, you know,

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.660
those systems they're paying them.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.740
And, you know, obviously there's this kind of synergy between, you know,

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:18.100
content creators and these hardware platforms or even software platforms

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.580
to be able to promote their stuff.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.340
And I'm sorry that he doesn't get that.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:28.100
Um, yeah, even, even your cat, Stella has a hot take on what this guy had to say.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.540
She's just being irritating.

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.460
It's more, more treats.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.900
She's been receiving treats all day long and she knows I'm on a call.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.140
Obviously now's the time.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:38.660
Yeah.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:42.500
And I, I agree with Bobby in chat, who's basically saying he'll be fine.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.620
People will forget his comments soon and he'll still be

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.780
working in the game industry.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.740
I agree.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.220
Like people it's going to blow over.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:48.540
It is.

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:52.660
But I, this is one of those things where I, I don't think it's so much about

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.940
what he said, but it's how you say it.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.620
And I think he just came off as like, so smug and so, and I, I would like to

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:05.980
compliment myself because I felt my drags in response on Twitter were really good.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.540
I'd like to share them with you now.

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:13.300
So in response, I wrote, people can't stream Google Stadia effectively because

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.340
they need that bandwidth to play the games and how's that lack of community

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.300
for your product working out in sales.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.060
I thought that was a good drag.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.500
Now here's, yeah, there is like some digs that he made against like

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.140
giant bomb and stuff like that.

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.380
And it's like, you know, here's the thing.

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.620
And I'm going to elaborate on this tweet too.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:35.100
While I agree, and this is my tweet, while I agree something like a jukebox

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:39.780
license should exist for streamers and I'd be open to some sort of revenue

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:44.540
share with developers, these industries are too slow to come up with something

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:49.260
just like Google Stadia was too slow to release outside Chromecast before X cloud

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:53.740
and Luna, you work in tech for Christ's sake, evolve or die.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.380
And that is basically what it is for me.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:04.540
And I, I actually don't necessarily disagree that the clock is ticking in of

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:10.420
sorts for when are some video game companies going to start to say, maybe

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.100
we don't want you streaming our game.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.380
And to be fair, that has already happened to some extent on YouTube, right?

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:19.500
We've heard about companies leveraging that DMC 80 at certain videos taken down.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:23.540
Nintendo didn't have a great take on this in the beginning either.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.300
So yeah, they took that approach.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.260
Nintendo took that approach.

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:31.020
They thought that they, you were playing their games, you should pay

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.380
them for the right to do that online.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:35.260
And that's the approach that they took.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.780
And, and they did that and obviously they backed away from it.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:43.900
So it wasn't working out well for them, I would assume because it's either it.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:49.220
It shines poorly on them, like that they're not embracing their community

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.980
or that the money wasn't worth it.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:56.780
I don't know, wherever the case may be, they backed away from it for a reason.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:02.900
So just, you know, let's just say, for example, that this Stadia studio or

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.900
whatever wants to take that approach, which is really stupid on their

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.700
device that you has that built in.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.140
So let's just say they're stupid enough to do that.

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:16.180
There are tons of other companies out there that will

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.500
let you play their games for free.

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:22.460
I'm pretty sure that the developers behind Among Us probably don't care.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.740
So if, if you have these companies, that's fine.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:28.740
You know, these AAA studios can go ahead and take that stance and do that, but

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:32.740
there's always going to be independent developers or even AAA studios that

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:39.660
don't share that same opinion and I'm sorry, but eventually, you know, you'll

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:44.980
find that your games get less exposure because you're just, you put up roadblocks.

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:50.100
I, I actually, I actually kind of agree with you for the most part on this.

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:54.540
I think it's one of those, if, and that's why I'm kind of like, it would be nice if

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:59.380
they would come up with something, a fair system so that if a developer wants,

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.220
they can get a cut of profits.

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:05.180
Now, I believe before you all start dragging me, I believe

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.220
it should be at a threshold.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:11.620
I don't think somebody who's making, you know, the bare minimum to be an affiliate

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:16.740
on Twitch and bringing in simple dollars and cents every month on Twitch should be

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.980
somebody that should be subject to those type of guidelines, but I think once you

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:23.940
hit a certain threshold and you're at these, you know, I'm making a living off

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:28.740
of it type of things, I think there maybe is room for a conversation about what

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:32.940
should a developer be entitled to in those cases, but, and this is where I

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:37.380
agree with Loki, I think a developer should have the right to say, we're not,

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.660
we don't, we want you to be able to stream this for free.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.420
We're not interested in claiming that we want to encourage you to

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.860
stream our game by doing that.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:49.300
And I think if you do that, then I think the rest of what Loki says absolutely

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.940
comes true is that the streaming market starts to gravitate towards those games

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:57.820
and the market kind of work, it's works itself out, but I do think we need to

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:02.580
have a little more definitive guidance in a legal sense so that this isn't

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.300
such a gray area anymore.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:10.500
I, I, because, because unfortunately, even though the way he said it was kind

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.340
of crappy where he's, you know, especially as somebody who works in the game

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.980
industry, he did have a point.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:23.100
If these guys, if the game makers want to come in and start shutting things

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.420
down, they could, and I'll tell you, and with all that stuff, I just try.

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.380
Yeah, like seriously, like just let him try.

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:35.060
Well, Nintendo did, Nintendo did, and they, maybe not on Twitch, but they did

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.980
on YouTube, but I also think, so everything I just said, Loki, cause

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.140
here's the thing it's funny.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.660
Nintendo is always the rule breaker.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.300
And I think this would be no different.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.580
I think if rules were to be set, I think Nintendo would be like, oh yeah,

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.940
we're claiming max share.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:51.900
And I really think Nintendo fans, like, I'm sorry, but Nintendo fans wouldn't

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:54.700
care because Nintendo fans are willing to die on their sword for Nintendo.

01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:00.220
I just feel like that again, it would be an anomaly, but at least

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:01.460
we'd have an answer.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.700
And at least we wouldn't be sitting here saying it's a gray area.

01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.340
It would no longer be a gray area.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:11.060
But the problem is, sorry, Loki, the problem is, but, but I'm, it's a

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:14.140
callback because go back to what we were just talking about at the top of the

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:18.700
show with AOC and her live stream, no matter how you feel about AOC.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.220
And I think, Loki, it was you that said.

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:25.220
It felt a lot better than just an old, a bunch of old people standing

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:26.620
around talking about politics.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.820
That's not very interesting.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.660
And I think that's it.

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:30.580
That's the disconnect.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.900
We need people like AOC and fight, let's say Justin Amash too,

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.860
because he's on the right.

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:36.180
Fine.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.460
Let them come together.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:43.580
We need these younger folks that get it to come together and talk about trademark

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:49.820
laws and rule and, and, um, uh, copyright and modernizing these types of things

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.580
for what makes sense in the year 2020.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.820
The whole DMCA needs to be rewritten and whole copyright law

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.300
needs to be rewritten anyways.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.980
It's just well outdated.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.700
It's been driven by Disney too.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.980
It's just, I just say it's been, um, what's the right word here?

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:14.260
Uh, exploited, exploited by Disney, um, to an nth degree.

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.580
I mean, it's ridiculous.

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:21.300
And so there needs to, it needs to be modernized and, you know, put in place

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:26.420
to where fair use is actually something that is considered because I know it is

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:29.740
written in that they have to consider fair use, but they don't because there's

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.500
no, there's no sort of punishment.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:38.220
If a big company, like say, you know, Warner music doesn't, uh, follow fair

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.100
use because what are you going to do?

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.100
You little person, you know, individual person that has no money, you're

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.700
going to fight a huge corporation.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:49.060
Yeah, there's no sorts of, you know, repercussion for them.

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.940
So the laws need to be rewritten.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.340
Loki.

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.820
I do want to jump in because the, the live fact checking

01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.060
that happens in our chat room.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.300
This is worth saying, uh, like what company has done it.

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.140
And actually a couple of people act deft and Bobby both chiming in.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.420
Atlas did it with persona.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.820
If you went too far into persona, they DMC aid people.

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:11.420
It's it's only one example that we can really think of in recent memory, but it

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:15.100
has happened, so there is proof that companies will use it if they feel like

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.060
they need to, so, I don't know.

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:23.140
Uh, dark Sakura, what do you, what do you, what do you think the rules should be?

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:25.620
Or do you think where's your head out with all this?

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.780
Do you think game companies should be entitled to some money?

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:29.780
Do you think it's too far gone?

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.300
Do we need to have a conversation?

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.260
What's, what's your opinion?

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:38.860
I think if anything, that the places that offer the streaming service need

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:44.660
to have some sort of licensing deal with some of these companies, I

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:50.420
think on behalf of the users, I mean, users are getting a kick in for, you

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:57.380
know, like sort of direct payments, but, um, there's also the subscriber

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.260
fees and everything, the more subscribers, you know, if anything,

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:03.820
maybe bump up a subscription by a dollar, have that go into paying

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.980
licensing charges and keep it off of the people who are providing the content.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.300
Or how about let's not pay these companies any more money because

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.180
they're already making tons of money from all the microtransactions and

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.860
stuff that they're throwing in and pretending these multi-billion dollar

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.940
companies, not all of them.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.340
There are other companies that would benefit from having a deal like that.

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:26.780
I understand that, but the ones that are complaining about it, Google, or I

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.060
should say this developer of Google, it's owned by Google, whatever, I'm

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:34.420
going to lump them in, you know, complaining multi-billion dollar

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:37.980
companies that are complaining that they are not receiving enough money for

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:41.500
their games, that's why they're charging $70 for their brand new games with

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:46.380
season, multiple season passes and DLC on top of that and special editions

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:51.820
on top of that and cosmetics on top of all of that, I mean, like, I

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:55.580
can't feel bad for you when you're giving your CEO several hundred

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:59.980
millions of dollars it's, or tens of millions of dollars, you know, as a

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.580
bonus, sorry, don't feel bad for you.

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.260
So no, I don't think you need to make more money, especially, you

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.580
know, gatekeeping this stuff.

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.500
And if you really want to do that, I'm sorry, but there's plenty of

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.460
other companies out there that won't necessarily go that route and they

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:19.260
could go very well the same way as Twitch, where Twitch has like kind of

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:23.340
this white listed music selection that you can choose from, then you can

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.780
have a white listed game selection you can choose from.

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.340
Well, let's go back to the music scene.

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:32.860
I was still making a point before, saying that I still stand by what I

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:38.700
said, it's a way to get the big companies off of people's back and it's

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:43.220
a way to offer freedom for the streamers that want to do, I mean, the

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:45.780
big companies are going to do what they can to be richer and richer.

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:46.820
That's all there is to it.

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.860
My point is living in the real world.

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:55.220
We should have a way that they get, you know, their little, what, two

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:59.980
cents on every game that's, uh, that's played on a stream and stay

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:04.100
off of the players backs, realistically.

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.580
That's kind of where I, and I think there is an intersection here where

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:10.100
you guys actually really do agree because it's where I'm at too.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.660
And that is, we've got to get out of this gray area.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.820
That is that, that, and that is what it is.

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:18.980
We may not ultimately like the result, but it, and what you're saying, Jamie,

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:22.180
it's going to get us out of the gray area and that's the most important thing.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.740
And I totally agree with that.

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:28.500
Now, well, like with, with music streaming services, for example, right.

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:34.820
All these companies, they do pay licensing fees to, you know, whatever

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:38.100
the production company, et cetera, you know, who owns the rights to

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.540
the music, whatever publisher.

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.220
It's going to be this, I think it's going to be the same thing.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.500
You know, you have that one licensing charge that they have with major,

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.620
with major companies, you know, maybe have a coalition though, for the

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:54.220
smaller, for the independent ones have like some sort of deal with them.

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:59.700
That then say, well, I want to step in and get a little bit off, you know,

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.660
for my games that they signed into this, you know, agreement or

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.100
whatever they can afford to do.

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:09.060
But, you know, it's like active, just said in chat, the companies only

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.100
care about money, so give them something to shut them the fuck

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.420
up and let us have our games.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.700
Well, and it's, it's funny you bring that up as a solution because I, I

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.900
really think now going back to the music side of things, I think the

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:25.620
music industry, of course, as always is being slow to evolve and ridiculous

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:31.100
and really short-sighted and losing potential money by not, and not even

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:36.420
the cool kind of petty like Lori petty, but they are like being really

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:41.500
ridiculous in not offering something similar to a jukebox license.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:46.260
So that streamers can just have music in the backgrounds of their streams

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:47.580
and not have to worry about it.

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.380
Something similar to what, you know, like a small business or, you know,

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.020
like a small streamer license, you know, and it, maybe it's not going to be

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:58.060
the type of money that everybody's going to want to pay, but at least

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.900
again, you'd have something to get you out of that gray area anyway.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:05.380
Well, in a perfect world, these, these companies would actually be

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:10.220
held accountable for paying their taxes, saying the, you know, people

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:14.820
who make stupid amounts of money over 400,000, you know, a year, they would

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.580
get taxed.

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:20.540
So I'm just saying, you know, this goes into a bigger picture.

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.940
We may be looking at it.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:25.660
This, this being one symptom of a problem, but we've got a bigger picture

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.780
that will be solved by voting.

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.420
Just saying.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.460
Um, Loki, I'm going to do something a little weird here and go out of order

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:35.540
because it just makes no sense to not pair this with your next story.

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.020
Can we hop ahead to the other story about Twitch?

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:38.340
I'm sorry.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.100
It just makes sense to couple this here.

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.500
Just so unprepared.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.980
We're having this discussion already.

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.180
We got to bring this up.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:51.140
So bringing up the RIA, of course, there was this huge, massive, uh, DMCA

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.260
purge and it's by Twitch.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:57.740
The issue is it's kind of a compound issue.

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:03.580
So one, apparently Twitch was receiving, I think these DMCA take down

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:07.740
notices for a while now they've been backing up since the summer.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:13.300
And now they just sent out information to streamers, letting them know that

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:19.340
one of your pieces of content has, you know, a piece of music or whatever,

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.140
and it that's been hit by this and you need to delete it.

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.300
And if you don't know which one it is, well, just delete all of them.

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.300
Cause they're not going to tell you which one it is.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:31.140
Which people are doing, which is ridiculous and stupid.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:33.940
Like just incredibly stupid.

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.140
You have apparently, yeah, these claims have gone back since the

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:40.860
beginning of back in June, um, that they were happening and they finally

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:45.580
got around in, which I mean, clearly they're not following, you know,

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.300
Twitch is not following the law here.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:51.980
Um, could make them lose their safe harbor status being that they've waited

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.500
so long to respond to these claims.

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.700
Um, but yeah, it's just, it's a problem because they're going to have, people

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.420
are having to mass delete these videos.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:07.620
Um, all their VODs and everything are going to be gone because they don't know

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:12.820
which clip it is that they're claiming, which I also think is not necessarily

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:20.300
following the rule of the law for DMC on this stuff, so I don't know.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:25.020
Um, I haven't gotten a strike, so I'm aware.

01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:28.260
Just for the record, VOG network did not receive one of these and I didn't

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:32.140
get one on my personal channel either, but I, I've generally been pretty

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.140
aware about this type of thing.

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.180
And I've kind of, you know, I just kind of know like, okay, if I play

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:41.340
something like Forza Horizon, I'm going to play on the classical music station.

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:43.620
That's not going to get, you know, struck a strike.

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:47.700
I don't do the whole like Spotify, iTunes, whatever, playing

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.780
potpourri in the background.

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:49.540
I don't really do that.

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.500
Um, it's usually always the music in the game.

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.100
Um, and, uh, unfortunately, and I'm, I'm kind of with, uh, what, uh, see

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.420
Black and Pat had a comment earlier.

01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.100
I was going to read, Oh yeah.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:00.860
I've been looking forward to playing harmonics, new game fuser

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:01.940
when it comes out next month.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:02.300
Me too.

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.580
Uh, but I know I won't be able to play it on stream because I'll be

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.540
DMCA'd within an inch of our life.

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:10.100
Yeah, totally, uh, where I'm at as well.

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.820
Um, so yeah.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:14.860
And Bobby says technically they could still strike the classical music

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.060
station because it's the recording that's copywritten and the classical

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.820
music station does have music written in the 20th century.

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:24.180
So, um, fair point, but it's, it's, it's jet.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.500
I've generally, I've been okay.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.180
I found, I did not get hit with one of these knock on wood.

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.700
Um, but I would do that.

01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:33.220
I who's going to watch my Forza horizon four stream from like three years ago.

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:35.340
Like I would do the same thing other people are doing.

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.740
And if I started getting these notices, I'd probably just delete

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.820
everything, um, which sucks, but yeah.

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:47.420
So, um, orange rice says I didn't get the email either.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.020
Uh, and, uh, interesting.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.300
I wanted to read this from a quest buster.

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.740
Cause I thought this was very interesting that I wasn't even aware of this.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:59.460
As a side note, Facebook gaming already has licensing details with the likes

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:04.420
of universal Sony and BMG to allow their streamers to play music during their

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:09.380
streams, at least those that have partner status still at something that's better

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.740
than nothing, even though it's Facebook.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.540
Um, yeah, that's, uh, very well said.

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:18.060
Um, so, but it also does show that the platform, i.e.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:22.580
Twitch could negotiate something at that level if they wanted to, but Twitch seems

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:26.380
to be a little more on this whole, which isn't necessarily bad, like I'm not

01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:30.900
critical of this, but is on this more, we're doing this Twitch safe label with

01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:35.220
indie stuff and because that's what they want to push and we all know that that

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:36.460
type of thing is going to be cheaper.

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:40.460
But, uh, who am I to complain about them wanting to push indie music?

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:41.900
I don't think that's such a bad thing.

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:48.860
Um, this is interesting, but, uh, yeah, it, the fact that you can't counterclaim

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:53.500
some of these things and that you're not really told a lot of the reasons, that's

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:58.460
the part that's kind of dicey and bad, that's following that a lot of these

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:01.020
violations and that falls on Twitch, that falls on Twitch.

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:02.060
Yeah.

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:06.660
Well, not having the counterclaim process, I think it goes against DMCA as well.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:11.940
Um, I think a lot of what they've done could get themselves into a lot of

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:16.740
trouble with these music labels because they didn't follow the letter of the law.

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:23.300
I mean, in ignoring it for four months, not that, I mean, they could easily

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:24.860
be taking the court for that stuff.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:32.180
I think this is just trying to save face right now, but like, yeah, I don't know.

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:38.100
It's not, that's, I can't imagine that they didn't know this was a problem.

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.060
Um, Questbuster in chat says a number of big streamers have already said they've

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:44.100
decided to just wipe out thousands of VODs to be safe.

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:50.820
And to be, to be fair, VODs aren't exactly where it's at on Twitch.

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:57.620
Like Twitch has not done a very good job of competing with YouTube on the VOD level.

01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:01.460
And I know it's ironic cause I talk about the VODs here of the show and so forth.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:06.500
Yes, they are available, but they're not really that well utilized.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:10.980
Like there's a couple of people that will watch the VODs of this show and I see you.

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:11.220
Hi.

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.020
Thanks for being there.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:17.300
I appreciate it, but it's not nearly the number that watch live or that watch on

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.580
the podcast feed.

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.260
And I think for anything else, my personal channel, there might be one or two people

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.780
that were where it's completely open.

01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.300
I don't have subs or anything.

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:29.460
Um, I might have one or two people that watch a VOD, but I have way more that

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:30.580
watch it live.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:35.780
Like Twitch's area that they, they are do well in is live.

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:40.020
So maybe in a way that's what makes it easy, quote unquote, for a lot of streamers to

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:44.420
throw things away is because it's like, eh, VOD isn't really where it's at anyway.

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:49.700
It's all about getting those subscriptions and bits and so forth in a live environment.

01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:51.460
Cause that isn't coming in on the VODs.

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:56.420
So, uh, Bobby in chat says even the clips aren't safe.

01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:00.020
And if there's something we do on our shows, that's extremely heavy on the video.

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.460
We post it to YouTube.

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:02.100
Yeah.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:07.540
So, uh, and Phoenix 77 26 says this will lead to DMCA abuse.

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.180
I sadly, I see that coming too.

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:14.020
So there needs to be a way to kind of respond.

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:18.260
It took YouTube forever to get there, but at least they have something in place now.

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:20.500
So it's, um, yeah, the whole thing's a little bit scary.

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.220
But not much.

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:25.460
I mean, it, there's nothing that really sought people from making false DMCA claims.

01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:26.740
So Ray.

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:27.860
Yeah.

01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:28.740
Very, very for that.

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:29.860
All right.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:30.820
Well, let's move on.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:34.660
Uh, I'm going to talk about the next story here, which has to do with, this is pretty

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:39.540
exciting and something I really wish Nintendo would have embraced this stuff a lot sooner,

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:40.420
but fine.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.300
We're here.

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:42.100
Yay.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:48.660
The original NES fire emblem game is going to get a localization and come to the U S

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:50.260
for the very first time.

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:57.060
Sort of, there was a remake that happened on DS 3DS, but this is, this is the true original

01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:59.620
NES rom from 1990.

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:03.380
That's coming out, which is a fire emblem, shadow dragon, and the blade of light.

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:11.300
Interesting enough, this game is already part of the switch online program in Japan.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:17.860
So if you open up the Famicom library in Japan and which you can do, uh, even with an American

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:21.700
account, all you need is just a Japanese account temporarily to go to the eShop and download

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:22.900
the Famicom player.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.140
But once you do that, you're not breaking any laws doing it.

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.900
The switch is a region free system.

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:34.180
You can go in and play this game already with your switch online in Japanese, but they're

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:39.300
going to be localizing it for the U S and because of that, it's not just going into

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.740
the switch online library, which I think is going to make a lot of people frown.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:48.180
But they are going to sell it separately as a $6 game or $5.99.

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:54.420
It's another limited time release, meaning you will only be able to get it through March

01:24:54.420 --> 01:25:03.060
31st, 2021, which is a whole other, I don't understand this, outside of they are trying

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:08.980
to inflate their, um, because notice that March 31st is no coincidence.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.900
That's the end of the fiscal year.

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.900
They're trying to sandbag as much as they can to sell in the physicals.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:18.820
They don't really have a gigantic holiday release to buoy them.

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.900
Mario 3D All-Stars is it.

01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:25.140
And then otherwise they're relying on third parties, like, um, probably the Hyrule Warriors

01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:28.260
2 is kind of like the other big holiday release, which really isn't their game.

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.500
But it is their IP, obviously.

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:33.300
Anyway, that's a whole other discussion.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:40.100
But what is pretty cool is that, um, there's going to be a $50 physical version of this

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:47.780
with an NES style box, replica game cartridge, 200 page art book, and a download code.

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:49.940
Because obviously you can't just put a cartridge in your switch.

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.620
Well, I guess you can, but they're not going to bother just putting this tiny, like an

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:59.220
NES cartridge or like, it's an NES style box and replica game cartridge.

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.460
So you can't actually put it there rep.

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.780
So you can't actually put it in a Nintendo.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.500
It's a rep it's for looks only.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.500
So, okay.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.220
Yeah.

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:14.340
But anyway, uh, that is, and then it's a translated game manual that you get in a fold out world

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:19.780
map now for collectors, especially people that really love their eight bit NES libraries.

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:24.740
That part is pretty cool because that isn't even like something, oh, limited run games

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:28.020
who does these types of Nintendo's doing it.

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:29.220
So that's neat.

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:30.580
I'm going to give them credit for that.

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:34.660
But I just, I hate the whole limited time release thing for one.

01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:41.620
Um, I actually, I'm not as hateful on the $6 surcharge as others might be.

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:46.020
I get that localization isn't free and they're going to need to pay people to do that and

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:46.420
so forth.

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:53.140
So I'm not, I still think there would have been value for Nintendo to put that into switch

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:58.820
online because that library is really slowing down and it's not as amazing as it used to

01:26:58.820 --> 01:26:59.140
be.

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.900
But I just sat here and talked at the top of the show about playing Mario P cross.

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.180
So maybe I'm wrong.

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.940
Um, I don't know what low key dark soccer.

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:08.580
What do you guys think?

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.940
I'm not a fan of fire emblem.

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:19.700
So yeah, I'm probably gonna get it just to have it for reasons.

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.380
Dan likes fire emblem, so we'll see.

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:25.860
I'm also just not as big on fire emblem as a series, but I'm really happy for those people

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.900
that are like, I'm not, I'm not a hater either, but yeah, I'm definitely one of those people

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:32.420
that's like, so if this does well, does this mean mother three?

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:35.940
That's I'm definitely never going to get you what you want.

01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:43.380
No, for the record, Rob and release, I have the translated, uh, uh, cartridge for mother

01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:44.420
three if you will.

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:48.100
Yeah, they're, they're out there, but I would love to see Nintendo embrace it.

01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:50.260
You know, that's, that's the, that's the thing.

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:50.900
I'm just joking.

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.660
I've never played any of the earthbound series.

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:55.460
So, you know, Oh, you should, do I care about mother three?

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:59.460
Um, Bobby black over chat says, uh, I think the surcharges for the added features, they're

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:02.820
adding more in game options, like rewinding a turn.

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:05.140
So it's not just the straight ROM.

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:11.300
Um, you could like the, the online emulator, you can do a rewind.

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:14.980
I'm not sure it's this, like, even in the Japanese Famicom, you can do like a real one.

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.380
I'm not sure it's implemented the same way.

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:18.660
So I'll give you that.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:23.700
But, um, yeah, I mean, I, I, again, I'm actually not upset about the $6 surcharge.

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:24.260
Like I get it.

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:28.820
There's things that go into it, but I also think Nintendo could have weighed, would there

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:34.020
have been value in just putting it in the library anyway and not doing a surcharge,

01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.580
but that was their decision to make, I think.

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:39.060
So, um, interesting.

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:43.140
And Bobby says it's literally in the in-game menus.

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:46.180
So it's like a actual feature in the game.

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:52.260
Now that makes me wonder how far along was this game localized already?

01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:56.820
Cause you know, with those hacks and things that happened, I get it.

01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:01.940
It's a shady, shady slippery slope, but we know that there are things that Nintendo started

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.660
to localize that they pulled back on for whatever reason.

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:06.420
These things happen in the gaming industry all the time.

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:13.460
And Nintendo themselves embraced it years ago with the Earthbound Zero release on Wii U.

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:14.180
Remember that?

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.540
That was also pretty cool.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:18.420
And I don't know why the fuck that's not on Switch still, but okay.

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:24.020
Um, so Nintendo was not exactly a stranger to putting these things out.

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:26.500
So I'm, it's just interesting.

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.300
That's all.

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.060
So anyway.

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.260
All right.

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.900
Let's move on because this is also about the Switch, Dark Sakura.

01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:40.660
Well, um, some good news since, uh, you know, a lot of us have been dealing with Joy-Con

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:47.940
Drift, which I still need to call to get mine taken care of, um, is that Nintendo is dropping

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:55.700
the price of a single Joy-Con controller from, uh, where it was before for $49.99 and is

01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:57.460
now $39.99.

01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:04.420
So it's only a $10 drop, but it is something, um, it's going to be available starting on

01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.300
November 9th.

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:12.740
Um, and they are also, um, specifically discounting two, uh, uh, specific models.

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:16.900
So it's the right Joy-Con red and the left Joy-Con blue.

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:23.220
Um, so it's the, you know, the same ones that were included in the, the default, uh, with

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.380
one of the original releases of the Switch.

01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.620
Um, and they are still offering free repairs.

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:30.980
So I need to look into, you know, that as well.

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:37.620
Um, there is a, not a price change for the full set of controllers.

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:42.740
However, it looks like Amazon might be having a sale for $69.99 instead of $79.99.

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:44.500
So there is that.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.900
So there you go.

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:48.580
It is what it is.

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:54.580
Um, as SSG100Matt in chat, uh, over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, so the prices are

01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:55.380
drifting down.

01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.340
That is not funny.

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.940
You of the dad jokes.

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.580
No, sorry.

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:06.900
Did Drew go out to visit SSG100Matt?

01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.020
Like what's happening here?

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:08.340
All right.

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.220
Okay.

01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:14.180
So anyway, all right.

01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:18.740
So, uh, I'm here for prices coming down, especially on really expensive Nintendo hardware.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:19.700
Uh, so cool.

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:20.900
All right.

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:22.740
Let's move on to some PlayStation news.

01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:28.260
So let's talk about Travis Scott, um, who's been a lot of places lately.

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:34.020
And so I'm surprised and I'm not surprised to see that he is teaming up now with PlayStation.

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:37.460
So this is Travis Scott and his brand, which is Cactus Jack.

01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:41.860
If you didn't know that already, uh, who's also already worked with things like Tesla,

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:43.380
Fortnite, McDonald's.

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:48.260
Like I said, like he's, Travis Scott is not just a musician, but very much a businessman.

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:49.860
He's, he's in a lot of places.

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.380
So it was announced this week.

01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:58.260
Um, it went in a interesting PlayStation, uh, video, uh, that was, uh, owed to the Maxwell

01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.980
high fidelity tape and sound thing.

01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:02.660
You, you know, this you've seen this before.

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:07.300
It's the guy sitting in the chair and then the TV turns on and whoosh, like the sound

01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.180
and all that, everybody.

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.620
It's like an infamous commercial.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:15.220
And this was kind of a homage to that commercial, but of course it was Travis Scott.

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:21.700
And it also kind of puts together that, Oh, is this why Travis Scott posted a dual sense

01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.180
five controller on his Instagram last month?

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:26.020
Like, how did you get that?

01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:32.340
So, uh, and it's because he is going to be working with PlayStation.

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:38.340
Now I'm not sure exactly how they don't really say like, he's, I guess like a creative mind.

01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:43.300
Um, but in a post on the PlayStation blog, which apparently he authored, um, it said,

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:48.260
I'm really looking forward to being able to showcase everything that cactus Jack has worked

01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:50.740
on with Sony and the PlayStation team.

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:55.140
Most importantly, I'm excited to see how the PlayStation fans and family respond.

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:58.900
And I look forward to running some games with everybody very soon.

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:05.140
So we don't exactly know what that entails, but like, I could see that, you know, we know

01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:10.980
that a year after this PlayStation is out, there's going to be a re maybe not like a

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:13.300
full redesign, but like a recoloring of it.

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:13.780
Right.

01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:15.860
Or a re like a pattern version of it.

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:15.940
Right.

01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:19.700
Cause that's, that's what happens all the time with like, like Xbox, but now it's a gray

01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:22.740
Xbox or a see-through Xbox or a PlayStation.

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:24.900
It's a, it's a blue PlayStation or any of this stuff.

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:27.220
So I'm sure this is just a matter of time before something like that.

01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:32.180
And so maybe there'll be like a Travis Scott designed or a cactus Jack kind of PlayStation.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:37.460
Like, I don't know any thoughts from you guys on, on what this team up could involve for Travis.

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:40.980
Okay.

01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:41.460
Maybe not.

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:42.900
It's all right.

01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:43.700
Loki, you're muted.

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.180
That's, that's why I'm like, pause, awkward pause.

01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:48.420
I don't know what he would be necessarily doing.

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:50.580
It's just usually marketing stuff.

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:57.540
I know he does a lot of merchandise online, but I don't know.

01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:04.180
Hopefully it's better than that mortal combat re arcade one up cabinet that we had for Supreme.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.580
I don't think it'll be better than that.

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:07.540
I don't think I'll do that.

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.420
Jamie, you had a thought.

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:11.860
I'm more with Loki on this one.

01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:15.380
I think it's just, I don't really think it's very big.

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:20.340
Well, it's, you know, but he, it's interesting, you know, cause I know he's, he's most known

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:25.780
as a musician, but again, the business side of things like that McDonald's deal is a lot

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.940
bigger than I think most people realize.

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:31.940
And like, like, like, cause you know, he had his own meal, like he was actually on the

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.660
menu, he'd get the Travis Scott meal and it was all in a commercial.

01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:35.780
He was narrating everything.

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:39.620
And the whole catch was, I think the burger was customized and the French fries came with

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:43.540
barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, because that's how he does it.

01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:49.860
And McDonald's were running out of barbecue sauce because of that.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:54.500
So, I mean, his name and his endorsement obviously carries weight.

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:59.860
Or I I've always said long before Travis Scott, that barbecue sauce is the way to go with

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.620
fries, but that I digress.

01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:03.380
I disagree.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.220
That's fine.

01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:07.140
Some people do ranch, some do ketchup, some do nothing.

01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:12.260
Because mayonnaise is delicious and ketchup is the devil.

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.740
Oh no, that's the Nickelback meal.

01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:15.060
Bleh.

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:16.980
I'm just kidding.

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:17.220
All right.

01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:24.660
Uh, yeah, I'm not a mayo person, but I know that's what they do in other countries.

01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:25.380
Yes, you're right.

01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:29.060
Of course you go over to like Europe and other places mayo or mayo.

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.020
No, bleh.

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:30.420
What?

01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.660
Rob, do you like the In-N-Out sauce?

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:35.060
No, it's mayonnaise based.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:36.260
Okay.

01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:39.300
It was worth asking.

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.660
No, I don't like it at all.

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.300
No, and Thousand Island.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:43.940
No, no, no.

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:44.580
Aioli.

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:45.460
No, no, no.

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:46.740
I know all the tricks.

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:47.620
No mayo allowed.

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:48.660
That's what Pixel Baka says.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:49.300
No, I can't.

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.900
Despite my love of the other weird thing, that is my weird thing.

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:54.900
I hate mayonnaise.

01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:55.380
Hate it.

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:57.540
But you know what I also don't like?

01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.220
Our McDonald's hamburgers.

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:01.620
So I've never had a Travis Scott meal.

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:03.140
You know what?

01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:09.860
I think the last McDonald's hamburger I ever thought that I really liked was the Arch Deluxe.

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:11.940
Oh, okay.

01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:12.340
Okay.

01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:13.140
Remember the Arch Deluxe?

01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:13.620
Yeah, I do.

01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:13.860
I do.

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:19.140
Because my vegetables were not wilty pieces of shit by the time I got my burger.

01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.220
Bring it back.

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.860
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I love dipping fries in mayo.

01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:25.540
I also don't do that in front of Rob.

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:26.740
You have permission to dip.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:27.460
I don't care.

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.420
You can eat mayo.

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.260
Just don't do that stupid thing.

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.500
And I know you won't, Bobby, because this isn't your personality.

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.340
But people in my past have done this.

01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:37.620
They dip it in the mayonnaise and go, oh, you want it?

01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:38.500
You want it?

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:38.900
Eat it.

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:43.620
Well, if you do that to you, I just I'm like that, though, about ketchup.

01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:43.860
Yeah.

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:48.580
If you have to dip their fries in anything, then they haven't made their fries well enough

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:51.540
because their fries should be just good enough as it is.

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:58.100
The problem is, see, so the way I used to describe fast food fries with a lot of the

01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:03.780
stuff McDonald's, their their consistency, it varies a lot.

01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:07.540
It's just whether they could be really garbage or they can be really great.

01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.620
If they're fresh, they're great.

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:13.060
But there's other like not even necessarily fresh.

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.380
They have to have them cook the right amount of time, seasoned right.

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:15.880
All that stuff.

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:21.300
But like there's other fast food chains that their fries are more consistent, but they're

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.140
never going to be as good as the best in and out fries.

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:26.740
I'm sorry.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:30.740
Now that we have a Shake Shack here locally, nothing Shake Shack fries are great.

01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.500
Nothing can touch those fries.

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.420
Done by Rob.

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.220
Five guys has better fries.

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.940
I didn't it's the peanut oil.

01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:41.060
I didn't like the bag of grease.

01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:43.220
All right.

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:47.540
However, however, I have found an ultimate fry replacement.

01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:53.780
Even my delicious sweet potato fries have been bested by the habits.

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.780
Tempo green beans.

01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.060
Really good.

01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.140
Some of you on the East Coast will get a kick out of this.

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:06.100
We just got a Shake Shack here locally, like right when the pandemic started, I think is

01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:07.860
when they finally opened, unfortunately.

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.660
So, yeah, now that's here.

01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:12.180
And yeah, their fries are bomb.

01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:16.420
And the closest thing to it is Del Taco fries is the only other place I've seen do the crinkly

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:16.900
fries.

01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:22.420
But Del Taco fries, like as good as they are, they have a tendency to make them soggy, dry.

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:26.580
The one with my health makes them very dry and flavorless.

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:31.780
And for the record, SSA 100 Matt, yes, if you're going to have in and out fries, you

01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:34.020
have to have them animal style because it's pretty amazing.

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:34.520
Nope.

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:39.940
You know, though, they're the fries that I loved as a kid, though, were from Checkers

01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.620
or Rallies or whatever the fuck the companies.

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:42.180
Oh, yeah.

01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:42.820
Oh, yeah.

01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:46.020
With the with the kind of spicy little bits to it.

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.660
And Whataburger does not have the best fries.

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:49.700
I'm sorry.

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:51.460
Crystal's has crappy fries.

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.100
I'm sorry.

01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:59.940
Um, because again, that's where I grew up, you know, just saying, um, I'm trying to think

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:03.780
that we're had really good fries that Oh, you know, I miss Steak and Shake.

01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:06.580
Oh, not yet.

01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:07.700
It's in Reno.

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:08.340
It's in Reno.

01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:09.460
It's getting close.

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:12.740
Yeah, but we can't really compare curly fries because that's a whole different thing.

01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:14.260
I mean, that's kind of its own thing.

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:17.300
Okay, I just gonna say, though, it's interesting because in chat, they're talking about like,

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:17.940
wow, I didn't know.

01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.380
Shake Shack finally branched out there.

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:26.740
We're all of a sudden getting these things that like the rest of the nation has had.

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:32.500
Like, we just got our first Cracker Barrel, which I kind of think is overrated.

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.020
But people are into it.

01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:34.260
Cool.

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:34.500
Fine.

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.220
But it's the only place I can get good fried catfish.

01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:37.720
Fair enough.

01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:41.220
Uh, that just happened within the past two years.

01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:43.620
We just know we need Waffle House, Bobby.

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:45.300
We need fucking Waffle House.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.380
California will never have a Waffle House.

01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:48.180
That's already been.

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:48.980
I know why.

01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:50.740
Yeah, because the wage thing.

01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.020
Our minimum wage is higher.

01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:52.900
Exactly.

01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:56.420
We have some decent knockoffs, though, because since we don't have Waffle House.

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:57.620
Can we get a White Castle?

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:02.900
No, we do not have a decent Waffle House.

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:03.940
Knock off the end.

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:05.140
We do not.

01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:06.340
I don't know.

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.260
I think there's an okay place.

01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:09.540
No, we do not.

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:15.380
As someone who has grown up and has eaten at Waffle House, I've eaten at the child.

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:18.500
No, no, you've eaten at Waffle House a couple of times.

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:20.260
I have eaten at a Waffle House weekly.

01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:21.700
I'm allowed to have opinions.

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:25.060
I'm allowed to have opinions.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.300
You're allowed to have an opinion, but in this case, it's wrong.

01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:31.540
Waffle House does not have a West Coast equivalent.

01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:33.220
End of story.

01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:33.380
Yeah.

01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:36.180
Carlos, your fries are good, but you need to have ketchup for those.

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:40.420
But those are actually, so they read as in their fries and they're all right.

01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:41.540
But they're not as ever.

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.180
They're not going to ever be as good as me.

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:45.140
So our next story is about voting.

01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:47.620
Wait, one more fries, and then we can go to voting.

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:51.220
Sia Tabiri in chat says the worst are the new KFC fries.

01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:52.820
I totally disagree.

01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.980
I think those KFC fries are so freaking good.

01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:59.940
I can't make my brain know what KFC fries are like, so I can't comment on that one.

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:02.660
All right, but you can use your voice to vote.

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:07.940
So I will say that I agree with Black Compat.

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.820
Waffle House does have the best grits.

01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.420
And my mother, bless her.

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:17.060
I was gonna say, you cannot get those here, even at the knockoff places.

01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:26.340
So I will concede that Rob, you can get them at my house because you stole a bag or your

01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:27.620
mom got you a bag or something.

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.460
No, it's not because I stole them.

01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:34.740
If you ask behind the counter, they will sell you a bag of their quick rice grits for 99

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:35.060
cents.

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:37.860
And my mother freaking sent me two bags of them.

01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.060
And I love them.

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:42.500
And I will have really good butter in them.

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:46.100
Or I will, if I'm feeling extra trife, I'll make shrimp and grits.

01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:50.020
Isn't it amazing that we get this passionate about French fries?

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.620
But when it comes to, are y'all voting?

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:58.020
Okay, so now that we've gotten everyone's passions all built up.

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:00.820
Use that voice.

01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.020
We gotta eat now.

01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:04.740
And this is something I am ridiculously passionate about.

01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:08.020
I have been participating in SPN votes.

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.140
I've been working with vote.org.

01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:15.220
I've been trying to spread the word on my social media as much as I can.

01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:22.180
So I'm super happy to hear that more in the gaming industry is stepping up and offering

01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:24.420
up now a voting location.

01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:30.660
You know, we've got states like what the fuck were they thinking Texas with, you know, only

01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:34.260
allowing like one voting location per district or something like that.

01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:39.860
The lines I'm seeing on like from our listener is from our listeners.

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.940
And I'm seeing on their Twitters and things.

01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.140
It blows my mind.

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:44.900
Do you have this?

01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:45.860
Sorry.

01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:47.140
I just say sorry listeners.

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:51.620
You know that we just got mailed ballots, filled them out and dropped them off at the

01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:55.620
library at the grocery store where the or mail them in any type of.

01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:59.060
Now there was that whole scandal about the official drop box versus the not official

01:42:59.060 --> 01:42:59.300
ones.

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.180
We won't go there.

01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:02.820
But it is completely unrepentant.

01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:07.780
If you look in the with your ballot, it tells you where you can drop them off.

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:10.660
So I was like, okay, the library nearby.

01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.740
Okay, that's where I'm going to go because that is an official one.

01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:15.060
So that's what I did online.

01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:16.420
And my mind's already been accepted.

01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:20.180
So anyway, so the lines are blowing my mind anyway.

01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:20.580
Go ahead.

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:21.140
Yeah, they are.

01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:25.620
And by the way, I actually do have to give some kudos to a couple of rather famous people

01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:31.220
that I follow on social media who stood in line on purpose in solidarity.

01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:31.460
Good.

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:41.780
So but anyway, 100 Thieves has turned their home office in Los Angeles into a voting center.

01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:49.860
They, they basically were saying that their 100 Thieves cash app compound, which is a

01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:55.700
15,000 square foot building, opened earlier in the year is now serving as an LA County

01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:56.980
voting center.

01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:03.460
And it's open for early voters starting on October 30, through November 2, and on election

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.660
date November 3.

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:11.140
And they also partnered with a graffiti artist goes by slick to have a mural on the on the

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:12.660
building that says vote.

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:19.220
It's kind of in Mickey Mouse hands, you know, but then it's going to change to we voted

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:25.380
on November 2, they are going to follow all this safety guidelines, voters will have to

01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:34.260
be masked and gloved and social distancing for those in the area is 6050 Jefferson Boulevard,

01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.060
Los Angeles.

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:40.580
And so I really think that it's great, you know, they, they're known for their professional

01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:42.660
teams for League of Legends, Fortnite, Valorant.

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:50.100
You know, I think that this is really good that they are using their, their location

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:55.620
and their voices to encourage others to vote because we do have a lot of damage that needs

01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:56.900
to be corrected.

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:59.300
And it's awesome that they're doing that.

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.420
It is awesome that they're doing it.

01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:01.460
I don't want to lessen it.

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:07.940
My gut reaction, though, is like, dang, it's too bad that they're not in New York or Georgia

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:12.580
or one of these places that I'm seeing the crazy lines because California, again, we

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:16.740
all it's every county now, it does what this county has been doing for years with the mail

01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:17.460
in thing.

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:21.380
And so technically, I mean, technically, they don't really need it.

01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.820
But it's nice to have options.

01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:25.060
And anything that'll get more people to vote is a good thing.

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.340
I don't want to lessen that.

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:31.300
But that was I was like, dang, too bad it wasn't in Georgia or, you know, New York,

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:37.140
or why I think it's good they are doing this because they are setting a example.

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:38.260
OK, I'll give you that.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:39.300
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:46.820
If they can do this, why can't other places there's you know, we have companies all over,

01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:52.100
you know, the nation, not necessarily, you know, centralized in California.

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:55.940
And on top of that, you know, there are other major tech businesses that could stand to

01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:56.980
do the same thing.

01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:00.180
You know, you know, call center campuses.

01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:03.860
I think that they should be allowed to set up for the same thing for some of our major

01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:04.360
companies.

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:09.800
I we were blessed, we were very fortunate that we could do a mail in drop off.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:10.300
Yeah.

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:17.160
But a lot of and I'm just going to go out and say it a lot of red states are are actively

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:21.560
working on their voter suppression because they know that that it can switch.

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.360
They could at least, you know, hang out in the purple region for a little while.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:31.640
But they know that the tide is changing, that people's opinions are changing and have really

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.760
restricted voters.

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:39.960
So I think that we need more companies stepping up and adding this kind of of availability

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:40.460
for people.

01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:45.480
Now, Bobby Black Wolf does want to correct because he's I kept kept bringing up Georgia

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:46.840
because I was seeing videos from there.

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:50.040
But Bobby does say, Hi, Georgia resident lines are better now.

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.640
The reason you saw the long lines on day one was because it was Columbus or Indigenous

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.520
People's Day.

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.200
So people had the day off.

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.360
The lines are about 30 to 45 minutes now.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:02.040
See what's interesting, though, like, I got to be honest, I got to be completely honest.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:06.040
Even when I hear 30 to 45 minutes, I'm like, oh, that stinks.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:11.160
Like, I just filled mine out at home while I was watching Twitch and then just ran it

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:11.800
by the library.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:12.200
That's it.

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.240
That's all I did.

01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:16.200
So I, you know, I'm not trying to be like, yay me, boo you.

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:20.760
But I got to admit, like, I'm like, why can't every state just do it this way?

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:21.800
More people would vote.

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:24.760
But yeah, Jamie is right on.

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:30.360
It's unfortunately some people are afraid that if it goes that way, then the elections

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.240
will turn out differently.

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.160
And that's that's unfortunate.

01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:39.880
Well, and I think the big thing with Texas, too, is that there was and now I with the

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:47.320
caveat, do not rely on the polls for your decision because we saw it happen in 2016.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.800
But they are seeing that.

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:55.240
Well, and Hot Pockrey, by the way, Austin is like mini California.

01:47:55.240 --> 01:48:00.600
I'm just saying, you know, Austin is this little blue pocket in the middle of a sea

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.080
of red.

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:06.440
And so, you know, which honestly, if there was anywhere in the south that I would move

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.680
back to, it would be Austin in a heartbeat.

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.560
I would live in Austin.

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.680
I would never move back to Mobile.

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:13.160
I'm just saying.

01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:19.720
But back to what I was saying, you know, is that they know that the state is already starting

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.800
to shift to blue overall.

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.240
And they're afraid.

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:29.960
They're afraid that the you know, that their way it's like that with any kind of way of

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:37.560
life, we even see it in, you know, in evolution, you know, that the whatever the newer species

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:41.080
is, the newer way of thought is always going to be attacked on by the older.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:44.760
And so, you know, this is more important than ever.

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:50.040
I'm glad that we're seeing more turnout than ever before.

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.760
Texas's turnout was pretty insane already.

01:48:52.760 --> 01:49:00.200
I've been watching the numbers on on some of the the polls I've been watching for the state

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.800
just because I have friends that live there.

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.480
And so I think it's amazing.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:07.320
But yeah, we need more companies doing this and we need them to be allowed to do this.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.280
Why our vote is even more important.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.520
And I got to say, and one message, you know, as despite I'm sitting here going, I just

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.600
was able to drop off my ballot at the library.

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:21.480
I really salute those of you out there that are waiting in line.

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.640
And please, that's why I was been harping on last week's show and the week before and

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.800
before that make a voting plan.

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.920
That's why I say that, because, you know, when I say plant, you might have to plan to

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:34.680
wait two and a half hours to vote somewhere, whatever it is, even longer, depending on

01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:35.480
where you're at.

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:39.800
So I just I really salute those of you that are getting in line to do it.

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:44.600
And I just I'm tipping my hat to you like, Jamie, do you know of any like since I am

01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:49.640
in California and I'm spoiled with the mail in thing, can I like buy those people coffee

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:50.200
somehow?

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.040
Like, is there an organization that like, yeah, is that legal?

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:59.320
I don't know if it's legal, but I would think that if there's no harm and like, can I somehow

01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.360
cheer those people on?

01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:04.120
Yeah, there are companies that are doing it anyway.

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:13.960
However, it's illegal to do food giveaways in some places, but there are there's like

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:14.280
snack.

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:15.480
What's it called?

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.360
I think snack the vote pizza to the polls.

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:26.520
OK, there there's there there are places like that, but also look for some of the suggestions

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:27.160
coming from.

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:31.880
And it's a group that I'm involved with very recently is random acts dot org.

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:33.800
It's our random acts of kindness.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:43.960
And they've they they're a nonprofit that's dedicated to doing kindness in the world,

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.800
just making the world a better place.

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:51.960
And I know people on there have been working on gathering together, working with some of

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:57.320
the food banks, working with, you know, some of the covid support.

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:01.800
And I think that there's some people with random acts who might have been trying to

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:03.560
band together to do some things in their name.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:11.080
But on top of that, anyway, I just say, you know, if you see people in line, you know,

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:17.080
bring bring bring out a bunch of, you know, protein bars, bring water with you.

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:19.800
You know, if someone says, hey, you can't do that, go away.

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:24.280
Well, you've even if you've given out five bottles of water to somebody, you've done

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:27.560
a kindness and you've helped encourage them.

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.060
Yeah.

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:29.560
All right.

01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.880
Anyway, let's let's move on.

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:32.840
But please vote.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.240
That's the message.

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:36.680
All right.

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.280
Let's talk about this next story.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.560
And I think, Loki, we're back to you.

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:42.200
All right.

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.320
Oh, yeah.

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:43.800
Yeah, we are.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:44.840
Sorry, I'm backwards.

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:46.440
OK, cool.

01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:51.720
Anyways, let's talk a little bit about more streaming stuff.

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:57.640
So, you know, we talked a little bit about how Google Stadia has had support for some

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:03.000
of their streaming six, but not all of them, unfortunately.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.240
But what's kind of fun is seeing what may be coming for Xbox games pass.

01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:13.240
So, for example, one of the things that's being teased is that there may be a bundle

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:22.360
with a TV streaming stick to be able to stream game pass via like a basically like an HDMI

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:27.240
device that you would plug into your TV, you know, similar to Amazon Fire or Chromecast

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.160
using X cloud.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:33.320
So it's interesting.

01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:37.240
That might be something that's coming as far as the Xbox ecosystem.

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:42.360
But, you know, what they're talking about is kind of similar to, you know, like Stadia

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:47.080
where, you know, you'd have a controller, you know, the games pass subscription and

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:48.920
the stick itself.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.840
So I'd be interested in seeing that.

01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:56.280
I think that'd be really cool, especially if it seems to be that they're focusing a

01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:57.640
lot on X cloud.

01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:01.560
And that would be a big way to get people into that ecosystem.

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:02.840
Yeah, for sure.

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:08.520
So and it's also interesting because it competes a little more directly with Google

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.520
Stadia, perhaps on that level.

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:11.740
Yeah.

01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:15.960
So, yeah, Phil Spencer basically say, I think you're going to see lower price hardware

01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:20.360
as part of our ecosystem when you think about streaming sticks and other things that somebody

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:23.800
might want to just go and plug into their TV and go play X cloud.

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:28.280
So, yeah, that'd be pretty cool to see something like that in the future.

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.240
They'd be able to do that.

01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:34.600
And I would imagine that's probably, you know, very feasible considering Android devices

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:35.640
are able to support this.

01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:40.840
So if they can put a stick together that can handle something like that, I think it's

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:43.800
feasible within the next probably year or so we'll see that.

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:44.300
Yeah.

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:45.340
All right.

01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:50.120
And then, oh, yeah, I was going to say one last thing, though, of course, to go along

01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:56.920
with that, I was going to say the iPhone streaming stuff as well.

01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:04.680
There's, of course, you may remember this whole thing with the App Store and wanting

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:12.120
like separate, like practically separate programs for each one of the games that you would stream.

01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:19.640
So now they've, I think, worked out a way to actually use basically, yeah, so using

01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:22.840
the App Store, you can stream as well.

01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:27.160
I want to say through, it's kind of a convoluted way through the Xbox app.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.840
So you sign in with that with your Microsoft account and you click on the library and do

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.520
all that stuff instead of a console.

01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:37.960
It's interesting to see they're going to have like a workaround for that to be able

01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:44.680
to use it on the iPhone, but still not probably the best way to do that.

01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:48.220
Yeah.

01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:52.360
And I think I heard one of them got taken offline as well.

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:55.480
Like there was some type of like backdoor app or something, and they ended up taking

01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.200
that offline.

01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.880
So just wait, wait for, wait for all those companies to work it out.

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:04.120
If nothing else, it sounds like, you know, if they're not able to get an official app

01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:08.760
or something, it sounds like Microsoft may go the way that Luna's going and do like an

01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.120
integrated web app type of thing.

01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:11.960
Just they got to get the technology working first.

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:16.360
So it's only a matter of time before, you know, it comes to iPhone one way or another.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:17.400
Yeah.

01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:23.720
So with the workarounds right now in place, you know, you can try that, but I think if

01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:27.560
they're going to, yeah, go through like the web browser or something like that, then that

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.480
would be probably the best way to do it.

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.960
Unless they can get, you know, Apple to agree to allow them to put it on the store in its

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:34.600
current state.

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:36.440
All right.

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:41.720
Well, let's move on and talk a little bit about a game that we never shut up about,

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.880
even though it never came out.

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:47.960
It was just a demo of a game that came out, God, years and years ago.

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.440
What was it like five years ago, at least five years ago at this point, more than that.

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:58.120
It's a little game called P.T., which of course was the playable teaser for what would

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:04.360
eventually or supposed to be a Silent Hills game that of course didn't end up happening

01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:07.640
due to Hideo Kojima leaving Konami and so on and so on.

01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:13.480
So with all the games that, and I think this came up last week, we were talking about that

01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:18.920
there's only 10 games that are not going to be backwards compatible on PlayStation 5,

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:19.880
according to Sony.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.880
So this leaves people asking, oh, does this mean P.T. is backwards compatible?

01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:35.400
So a news outlet out there, GamesRadar, contacted Konami and actually asked, can we play P.T.

01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.080
on the PlayStation 5?

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.440
And the answer they got was, P.T. will not be available on the PlayStation store, so

01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:46.360
users won't be able to redownload the content through the backwards compatibility feature

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:47.640
to the PlayStation 5.

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:57.160
Which isn't really the answer they were looking for, because, well, OK, so I can't download

01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:58.200
it anymore.

01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:03.800
But technically, if I put it on a drive and then I can move that drive over to the PlayStation

01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:05.960
5, I should be able to play it.

01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:07.640
You're never going to be able to play.

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:13.240
Well, I don't know if it's so much and here's what I think is going on here.

01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.120
I don't know if it's so much as they don't want you to play it.

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:19.400
I mean, yes, Konami would probably like to forget that that is out there.

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:23.720
But the reality is the answer they gave is not wrong.

01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:31.480
They don't want to endorse the methods that people are using to still play P.T.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:36.200
They don't want to endorse that, oh, you can download it somewhere else and use a loophole

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.760
to get it on your drive and get it to work that way.

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:44.280
That's the problem and why Konami has to stick to this line that, no, P.T. is not playable

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:46.840
on the PlayStation 5 because there's no way to download it.

01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:50.600
In their mind and in their league, that is the answer.

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.800
So I also don't necessarily think like I know people want to jump all over Konami, like

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.240
stop blowing smoke up our ass.

01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:59.400
Tell us what the reality is.

01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:03.000
They're not going to, because if they were to say, oh, yeah, it works fine on PlayStation

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.760
5, bam, they just endorse these techniques people are using to play P.T. when the game

01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.680
was delisted five years ago.

01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:18.680
So I think looking at the list that there's 10 games, I think we could all safely bet

01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:21.160
it's probably going to work, but.

01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:23.720
Will it work right?

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:30.920
It may not, because even the PlayStation Pro, I thought, brought some nuances to that that

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.280
was kind of dicey.

01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:33.240
I don't remember.

01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:37.400
Of course, I have PlayStation Pro and was able to copy P.T. over because you can copy

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:38.440
kind of like everything over.

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:40.920
But I don't know.

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:41.960
I can't remember.

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:45.480
And I have to ask the expert if Flaco Jones was here, because he knows that game in and

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:46.840
out a lot better than I do.

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:54.760
But I could see that there could be some problems with PlayStation 5 and the emulation that

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.280
it may not work correctly.

01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:59.240
Not all the tricks you're used to using may actually work.

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:00.360
So we'll see.

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:04.200
Um, it's dark soccer back by chance.

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:06.520
She stepped away for a minute.

01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:09.080
OK, she's not back, so I can't get to the next segment.

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.280
So we need to buy some.

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:11.240
Oh, OK.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.520
No, I was eating cake.

01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:16.840
Oh, I was eating cake.

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.120
Sorry, I was doing my story.

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:19.080
OK, back to you.

01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:19.320
All right.

01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.200
Sorry, sorry.

01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:20.700
All right.

01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.240
Well, I hope the so the cake was not a lie.

01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.040
No, it was an apple streusel cake.

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:28.600
OK, because I was like an apple coffee cake.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:29.320
It was pretty good.

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:32.040
The question in chat everybody's going to want to know is what kind of cake?

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:36.120
OK, it was it was an apple coffee cake.

01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:37.320
It was delightful.

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:45.480
And it made me remember that I've only had a half a protein shake and a sausage and some

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.720
peanut butter pretzels today.

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:48.200
All right.

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:51.880
Well, I'm sorry to tear you away, but it is that time to finish it.

01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:52.440
OK, good.

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:55.560
Look, I don't see anything.

01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:57.720
My Ikea bowl.

01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:58.220
All right.

01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:00.520
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:05.000
Every week, our soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.040
hey, you brat should be checking this game out.

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:13.160
But actually, in a twist for twenty twenty once a month, she picks a pinball game.

02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:15.640
And it's actually been a little while since we had a pinball game, because I think we

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:18.200
did one like early September and now we're in late October.

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.000
So it's been a little bit.

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:22.520
But Dark Soccer has picked a pinball game for us tonight.

02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:27.320
So I think Dark Soccer, you want me to announce this by playing this actual commercial for

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.440
the table, right?

02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:29.720
Just the first part of it, yes.

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:30.600
OK, let's do that.

02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:32.280
And Jamie, you're not going to be able to hear it.

02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.400
So I'll tell you when it's over.

02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:39.560
OK, so here we go to introduce us to the classic pinball table of the month.

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.320
Hello, darlings.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:00.200
Yes, it's me, the titillating temptress in the flesh and not much else.

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.200
Elvira, mistress of the dark.

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:07.320
And tonight I have an especially terrifying tale from those monster hit makers of Bally.

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:10.360
It stars my favorite actress of all time, me.

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.760
And it's destined to become a true cult classic forever,

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:17.320
or at least until you croak, whichever comes first.

02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:20.600
But I can see you're ready for some action.

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:22.680
So get ready to get scared.

02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:26.280
All right, Jamie, you can go.

02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:28.120
There it is, Elvira.

02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:28.760
I love her.

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:30.040
I love her.

02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:31.880
She is what I love about Halloween anyway.

02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.020
Yeah.

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:39.800
So, yes, the classic pinball of the month is scared stiff, which I mean, how could I

02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:40.300
not?

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:41.800
It's perfect.

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:42.440
It's perfect.

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:44.120
And it's Elvira.

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.640
Look, here's the funny thing.

02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.640
Elvira invented dad jokes.

02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:50.120
I know, I know.

02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.120
Just I know it doesn't make sense when I say it.

02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:54.840
But really, like puns are her strength.

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:59.640
And think about that scared stiff and Elvira.

02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:01.720
It's I love it.

02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:02.440
Anyway, go ahead.

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:09.240
And by the way, I do have a little, little teensy correction.

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:12.760
The new pinball is not scared stiff.

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:15.320
It is Elvira's house of horrors, just saying.

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.360
So it is not scared stiff.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:25.720
Um, anyway, scared stiff, uh, came out in 1996, uh, was designed by Dennis Nordman and

02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:27.800
released by Midway as Bally.

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:34.680
And, um, of course it stars Elvira and it is the follow up to 1989 Elvira and the party

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:36.680
monsters that was also designed by Nordman.

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:41.800
Um, it uses Midway's, uh, WPC 95 system.

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.840
Um, and it has this B movie horror theme.

02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:46.280
Cause I mean, it's freaking Elvira.

02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:52.600
You have to go through the six tales of terror to level up this different meter and you have

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:58.120
eyes of the Bonnie beast terror from the crate stiff in the coffin, the monster's lab night

02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:00.200
of the leapers and return to the dead heads.

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:05.400
Um, and of course it does have this like interactive back box is really cool.

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:13.080
It had this, uh, spider in, um, you know, in different, uh, different, uh, neat modes.

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:18.200
And of course, uh, when they, uh, exhibited the game, they had Cassandra Peterson there

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:19.640
as Elvira to help with the promotion.

02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:24.440
Um, and it was supposed to have some other things in there.

02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:29.400
It was supposed to have a rubber boogeyman figure that would, uh, be mounted over slingshots.

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.840
They're supposed to move forward with the kicker when the ball was hit.

02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:38.200
Um, and the ROM actually still allows for them to dance to the music during boogeyman

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:38.840
boogie mode.

02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:44.440
Um, but it was removed because their arms were going to break off.

02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:48.520
Um, so, uh, but the code is still there.

02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:51.000
And so people have still done the mods on it.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:57.400
Um, scared stuff is also licensed for pinball arcade until, uh, June 30th, 2018.

02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:00.360
So a little bit more about that.

02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:05.400
Of course, you know, we had, uh, her doing voice acting for, for the, uh, for the game.

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:12.200
There are so many things going on with this table that it's, uh, it's pretty good.

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.040
It's, it's got a lot going on.

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:21.240
Um, and so, uh, there's also this skull pile in the upper right-hand corner of the play field.

02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:26.680
Um, that was supposed to have lighter buys, but the production versions did not do that.

02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:30.840
And so people have also added in, uh, after factory LEDs.

02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:34.840
Um, so there is a website out there though.

02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:39.720
That is like, and it, it looks like one of those old web pages that was designed in like

02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:48.920
19, you know, 95 using AOLs, you know, designer tools, like very, very rudimentary HTML,

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:54.440
geo cities, but, uh, maybe, but it's this guy's like domain and everything.

02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:59.960
So, um, but, uh, he's got some very cool stuff on here, like some different treasures and

02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:02.840
behind the scenes stuff for, uh, scared stuff.

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:07.640
It's just, uh, robertwinter.com slash pinball slash SS.

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:12.360
And I mean, just got, I mean, yeah, it's not a pretty site, but it's got some really neat

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.760
things to look at, like the back glass and the differences between the different machines.

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.560
And I don't normally bring up, you know, another website to talk about a game that,

02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:25.480
that I'm discussing, but in this case, while it's not the best site,

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:27.560
it's got some really neat stuff on it.

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:32.200
So I totally suggest people look at it and it's got the rulesheets up and, you know,

02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:35.720
we had, you know, we had a scared stiff in my house for a while, but due to COVID,

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:37.320
no one could come over and play it with us.

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:39.320
So there you go.

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:40.840
It's scared stiff.

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:43.960
All right.

02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:47.240
I didn't realize there were three Elvira games now.

02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:51.240
Yeah, the, the current one is a stern pinball.

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:58.600
And, um, if you watch Netflix channel, um, he's done, uh, some play on it already.

02:05:58.600 --> 02:05:59.080
I think.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:01.720
Um, so, uh, what's his name?

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:02.280
Jack danger.

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:08.200
Um, really, it looks really solid, but I mean, I've, I've hardly played any of the stern ones

02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:12.200
that I haven't enjoyed as a table, even if I haven't enjoyed the theming.

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:14.200
Um, so yeah, scared.

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:18.920
I mean, if I was going to do a modern pinball, I don't, I would actually have done Munsters.

02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:25.160
Um, like that Munsters, uh, black and white le, um, that has like a mini play field in

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:25.560
the middle.

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:27.400
That is really, really cool.

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:31.960
Um, but, uh, but I mean, we're going classics.

02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.080
This is a classic game.

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:34.840
And pinball is a classic.

02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:42.920
You know, 1996, I was playing this at a bar, um, at, gosh, it wasn't, it wasn't Solomon's

02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:43.560
that got it in.

02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:46.600
It was another place that had gotten to pinball in.

02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:48.840
And I played this probably not too long after it came out.

02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.360
Nice.

02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:51.640
And yes, Bobby, I agree.

02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:54.840
The Hot Wheels, uh, table is actually pretty decent.

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:57.400
Um, I have seen it in play on a live stream.

02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:58.360
I haven't been able to play it.

02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:03.480
I will say about this table, and you can actually see this as the, the person is playing here

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:07.240
on, on Twitch and you probably can hear it too in the audio, especially earlier in the

02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:10.680
sequence, but jackpots are really easy to get in this game.

02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:14.040
Like, because every mode that you activate has some way to get like a jackpot.

02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:17.880
And so as you, if you're decent enough at this game, you can just get jackpot, jackpot,

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:19.560
jackpot, jackpot, like over and over.

02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:20.920
It's pretty, pretty interesting.

02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:26.920
So yeah, but the thing is that the skill is to get your multipliers with it, but I do

02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:27.560
love this table.

02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:31.480
I do love this table because I love Elvira.

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:35.880
So yeah, honestly, I think this one's more fun than a party monsters.

02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:38.200
So yeah, your mileage may vary.

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:38.600
All right.

02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:39.160
There it is.

02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:40.760
Your classic pinball of the month.

02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:42.920
Elvira scared stiff.

02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:47.720
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk quickly about some other things.

02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:50.840
Happening around the industry or actually, Jimmy, are you staying with us or did you

02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:51.880
need to go part way?

02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:52.440
I can't remember.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.560
You know, I actually, um, my, my headache has come back with a vengeance.

02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:04.280
Um, so, and, and just to let everybody know, you know, I, I really wanted to stay and finish

02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:09.880
the show tonight, but, um, I either I have neck pain caused by migraine or migraine caused

02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:10.600
by neck pain.

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.200
So either way, I'm fucked.

02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:13.640
Oh dear.

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:14.440
We'll feel better.

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:15.080
It's okay.

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:15.960
Thank you so much.

02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:19.080
And you know, guys, I, I love all of you.

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:23.400
You're all amazing people and, um, a little, little teeny plug if I may.

02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:23.640
Yeah.

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:29.560
Um, don't forget that on Thursday I am going to be a guest on am I mental?

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:36.920
If you go to am I mental.net, um, I will be talking with, uh, E who was on the show last

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:42.040
weekend, um, about mental health and, you know, I'm, I'm probably going to be pretty

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:42.680
brutal on here.

02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:45.880
So you're going to see a side of me that I don't often, uh, talk about.

02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:51.000
Uh, I might talk a little bit about on the show, but I, uh, I don't go off into too much

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.000
detail about, so we're going to get dirty, whatever you're comfortable with.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.600
So enjoy the show.

02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:57.720
He was a great guest.

02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.000
That was a good talk last week.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.440
So he's a, he's a great person, a good friend, and I'm really happy we could have him and

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.360
I'm happy that I get to be on a show.

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:07.080
All right.

02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:07.320
All right.

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.600
Well, we'll talk to you next week.

02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:09.080
Feel better.

02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:10.200
All right.

02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:10.680
Love y'all.

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:11.080
Bye.

02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:11.320
Bye.

02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:12.280
All right.

02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:14.760
So meanwhile, just, uh, nevermind the visuals here.

02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:18.280
I got to get sorted around, uh, but perhaps we will get into some rapid fire news and

02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:22.120
I will have Loki start us off with rapid fire news here while I fix the visuals.

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:23.240
Yeah.

02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:28.520
So a game I was talking about a lot, uh, earlier this year was what the golf, and of course

02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:31.000
it being an Epic games exclusive at the time.

02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:36.280
Um, you could only purchase it there, but of course, after a certain amount of time,

02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:42.120
it does eventually appear on other storefronts and this time now appearing on steam.

02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:46.200
And with an added bonus that they've added a level editor for it.

02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:51.560
So it's a great time to go purchase it now on steam and you can go check it out, uh,

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:53.160
with the level editor.

02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:58.120
Um, and it's also on sale, so, um, definitely go check that out as well.

02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:03.480
Um, I'm not sure if the level editor is going to be coming to other platforms, but at the

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:04.680
very least it's on steam.

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.240
So I may have to purchase it again.

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:07.640
We'll see.

02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:15.400
And then, um, as we had talked about a while ago that you play is going to be phased out

02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:20.920
in place of, um, uh, let's see Ubisoft connect.

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:26.920
So they've got, um, one of the things with you play that actually kind of dug a little

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.680
bit is playing certain games.

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:32.840
Like, you know, like for example, I used to play South park a lot, um, would earn you

02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:36.440
points that you could then use to unlock.

02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:42.760
Not necessarily DLC, but like usually cosmetics in like things for different games.

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:43.880
I saw it in just dance.

02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.240
You could get some remixes that way and little things, little costumes and things.

02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:47.480
Yeah.

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:47.800
Yeah.

02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:53.000
So I used to do that for like different classes and stuff in, um, the South park games and

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:53.960
stuff like that.

02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:59.720
So, uh, with that though, because that service is going to going away, they've decided to

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:02.040
unlock all of the rewards.

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:06.680
So you can go check them out before it's finally phased out on October 29th.

02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:08.680
So you have the rest of this week to do that.

02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:11.400
So go download all those extras.

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:14.840
If you can time to get out all your old Ubisoft games.

02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:15.400
Exactly.

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.720
I think I've gotten most of my stuff already, you know, cause the points are pretty easy

02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:20.200
to get.

02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:26.280
Um, so, but I still have to revisit some of the Ubisoft games that I have to go download

02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:27.800
all that like bonus things for that.

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:30.680
So, um, just a reminder to go check that out.

02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:33.640
Um, so yeah, so that's pretty exciting.

02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:38.120
It was one of those things that, um, kind of made you play feel, feel a little better

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:42.520
than some of the other third party, uh, signup things is that they kind of had that whole

02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:47.400
like achievements make you, you actually get tangible things from achievements and that

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:47.960
was kind of neat.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:49.240
Yeah.

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:51.640
It was nice to have that little bonus in there.

02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:53.640
Um, so I do appreciate that.

02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:59.240
It wasn't such a bother on like console when I was playing most of, you know, these games,

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:04.440
but I know with a PC having the extra launcher kind of sucks, but you know, whatever.

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:05.320
Yeah.

02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:06.680
All right.

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:09.160
Well, moving on, let's talk about a new studio.

02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:12.440
Um, that's up and coming frost giant studios.

02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:16.600
And, uh, you probably wouldn't be surprised that when I tell you frost giant studios is

02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:19.880
formed by a lot of blizzard enter to get it frost giant blizzard.

02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:24.600
I it's hilarious, but, uh, the actual little mascot, it's not so obvious at first cause

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:28.200
a little mascot for frost giant is an actual little like frost giant.

02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:31.960
Um, but anyway, it's a former blizzard folks and look, I, I get it.

02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:34.840
Uh, you know, blizzard is in an awkward place.

02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:38.040
Uh, they're not quite the cool company they used to be.

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.440
Obviously we had all those, you know, issues with the, the banning of the starcraft player

02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:44.200
that was supporting free Hong Kong.

02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:49.160
Um, last year, uh, that was really awkward and their response was really awkward and

02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:52.360
like a lot of awkward things have been happening with blizzard lately.

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:58.840
But I suppose the good news is that, you know, blizzard will still continue to put out their

02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:06.040
products and you now have this frost giant studios who has raised $4.7 million to make

02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:10.360
their first game, which will be a real time strategy game, which.

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:15.000
Where did blizzard get, get their roots with Warcraft star?

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:15.800
And I don't mean world.

02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:21.320
I mean, Warcraft, uh, two and three and then star craft, you know, it was really that RTS

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:22.040
genre.

02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:27.720
Um, so, which is interesting because I'm not usually into those kinds of games, but I liked

02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:32.200
old Warcraft a lot and I liked, no, I don't, I didn't really play original starcraft.

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:36.120
I guess I just played Warcraft two and original Diablo, which isn't really an RTS.

02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.280
Um, but I'll try this.

02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:39.240
Uh, it'll be interesting.

02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:45.240
Anyway, Tim Morton and Tim Campbell from Starcraft and Warcraft, uh, said recently in an interview

02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:50.280
that the RTS genre hasn't gotten as much attention lately, uh, like battle royale shooters or

02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.080
console action games, but they think the RTS on the PC can still be a big, big part of

02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:55.880
gaming in the future.

02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:56.680
So good luck to them.

02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:58.840
I'm going to look forward to see what they have coming.

02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:00.440
Uh, cause that sounds pretty cool.

02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:01.160
All right.

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:06.840
Uh, let's talk about Pokemon go, which has added AR mapping to their tasks.

02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:11.640
I talked to similar to, uh, well, yeah, it's the same damn thing.

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:13.960
Um, but just the implementation is different.

02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:17.880
So you might remember it was about three months ago on this show, but I was talking about

02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:25.400
the cemetery creeping, which I did pull back on a lot between the heat and the smoke from

02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:26.440
all the fires.

02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:29.080
I wasn't really able to go out on the weekends as much.

02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:33.320
Um, and I just, since I got back, you know, from being gone a couple of weeks ago, I just

02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:36.120
haven't gotten out this weekend or last weekend, but I want to go out and do that more.

02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:37.240
Cause that's kind of fun.

02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:40.360
Um, so you might remember, I talked about that on the show, like where I was scanning

02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:40.840
portals.

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:41.560
Well, guess what?

02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:44.680
That is now just in Pokemon go.

02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:49.480
Um, but it's been in there for like a month, but there was no reason to scan.

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:51.720
There was no motivation or anything.

02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:55.720
So Pokemon go Niantic, they actually added some incentives.

02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:58.920
So there's some tasks that you can get called AR mapping.

02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:03.400
Uh, and then if you do the actual little scan of the portal, you might get a cool little

02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:06.040
reward, like 10 Pokeballs or whatever it is.

02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:09.560
Of course, when I was reading Reddit, some people are already kind of fucking with this.

02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:13.560
Like when they get a task, they'll just scan the ground or something, um, which is like

02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:18.920
not what you're supposed to do, but I guess if Niantic doesn't quality check, then I guess

02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:19.960
people are going to do that.

02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:25.240
Although I will say now, I don't know if this is in Pokemon go yet, but I will say in Ingress

02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:30.120
in the last patch for Ingress, probably about two, three weeks ago, they actually made it

02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.560
so that the scan will detect motion.

02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:39.160
And if you don't move, you can't, you, you won't be able to finish the scan and you have

02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:41.080
to have well lit conditions.

02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.200
So if it's too dark or dark, so dark, you can't see the portal, which happened to me

02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:46.760
the other night.

02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:49.560
I was at a park and sundown is just happening earlier and earlier.

02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:50.920
So we're getting later in the year.

02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:55.480
Um, so I could not actually scan anymore at the park because the game said it's too dark

02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:56.200
out.

02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:01.400
Um, so I don't know if those fail safes are in Pokemon go cause I haven't been scanning.

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:01.720
Okay.

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.800
S.J. and Hunter Matt says it is in Pogo.

02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:05.960
It won't accept the scan unless you move around.

02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:06.280
Thank you.

02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:09.800
Cause I haven't been doing it cause I'm already doing it in Ingress.

02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:13.880
I just wish my Ingress credits would come over to Pokemon go.

02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:19.560
But what's interesting is that you can see some stops and gyms have the tasks, but not

02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:20.360
all of them do.

02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:25.960
And I like, for instance, one right by my house doesn't have the task.

02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:27.880
Well, I'll tell you why it doesn't have the task.

02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:31.080
I scanned that fucking thing lots of times.

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:32.040
It doesn't need anymore.

02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:38.120
And, and not just me, but people that wanted to knock me off his scout controller, um,

02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:41.320
and other people on my team as well, who just were nearby.

02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:44.120
And cause sometimes we get together and exchange gear and stuff.

02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:46.840
And so they wanted to scan it as well.

02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:51.640
Uh, that is probably why it doesn't show up as a place that you can do scanning in, um,

02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:53.480
Pokemon go.

02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.680
I just thought that was interesting.

02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:59.080
So if some something by your house doesn't have a task available, somebody from Ingress

02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:02.840
probably already scanned it a ton already, but I'll tell you hardly anyone's doing it

02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:03.720
in Ingress either.

02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:05.720
Cause the rewards in Ingress are minimal.

02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:07.400
It's like a badge.

02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:09.000
You don't even get gear or nothing.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.600
So it's a little silly.

02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:11.100
All right.

02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:14.680
A hot pocketry in chat says, bring a flashlight.

02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:16.920
I tried to use the one on my phone, but it wouldn't work.

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:19.000
I didn't think to bring a separate one.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:19.880
I didn't think I'd need it.

02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:21.560
So, all right.

02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:22.680
Uh, let's move on.

02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:24.200
Uh, Jamie had some stories too.

02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:26.280
Are you able to do these Loki or you want me to do them?

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:26.680
I don't care.

02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:29.480
Um, yeah, I can, I can talk about them.

02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:29.980
Okay.

02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:31.800
Um, so apparently.

02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:33.640
Let's see.

02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:41.880
There's a new, I mean, as with all times of the year, Humble has some new, um, a Halloween

02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:43.880
sale kind of going on there.

02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:46.600
So of course, discounting lots of different Halloween games.

02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:51.720
I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of different store friends that are doing similar things.

02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:53.640
I know Epic had something marked down.

02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:58.680
I'm sure PlayStation Store did kind of everybody's discounting all the Halloween themed stuff.

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:05.080
So of course, Resident Evil 7, uh, Batman Arkham Knight, uh, game of Arkham City, all

02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:08.280
that stuff's like, you know, 75% off, 80% off.

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:10.440
So, uh, just go check all your storefronts.

02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:12.040
It's probably a good idea.

02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:23.160
And then, um, to go along with that, of course, also there was, uh, Zen Pinball had some,

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:27.320
uh, new titles that are being announced.

02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:30.360
I guess from Alpha Numeric Pinball.

02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:40.200
So they've got, let's see, Williams Pinball 6, and the tables include Fun House, Space

02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:43.320
Station, Dr. Dudes, and his excellent Ray.

02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:46.120
I am not familiar with any of these.

02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:48.280
I apparently don't play enough pinball.

02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:50.120
Fun House would be the most well known.

02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:53.640
Fun House had a very scary looking face on the table.

02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:53.960
Okay.

02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.080
I do remember Fun House.

02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:02.840
I'm not sure about, but, um, so yeah, so that's pretty cool.

02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:09.400
Um, you can check those out for, uh, Pinball FX 3 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:15.240
Switch, Windows 10, and Steam, as well as on the Williams Pinball app, iOS, and Google

02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:15.560
Play.

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:17.000
All right.

02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:21.080
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are

02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:23.960
coming out near you real soon.

02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:28.520
As we start to ramp up to the release of new systems, if you can believe it, we're what

02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.280
we're three weeks away from new systems.

02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:31.800
Two weeks.

02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:32.120
Wow.

02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:34.120
Not even three.

02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:37.320
Yeah, no, it's three because next week is Halloween.

02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:41.880
Then we get the November 7th, it's three weeks, but it's close.

02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:43.160
Yeah.

02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.320
So, uh, starting off with this week, we've got Cobra Kai.

02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:53.320
The Karate Kid Saga continues on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:58.440
Ghost Runner on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Pacer on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Shin Megami Tensei 3 Nocturne HD Remaster on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:26.920
And we've got Watchdog Legion on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia.

02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:32.920
Angry Video Game Nerd 1 and 2 Deluxe on PC and Nintendo Switch.

02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:39.240
The Dark Pictures Anthology Little Hope on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:44.520
Mad Rat Dead on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:47.160
Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Nintendo Switch.

02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:51.480
The Mahari Kawasi Fresh on PlayStation 4.

02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:57.080
Visage on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:57.560
That's it.

02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:01.960
Just a random question from chat, um, over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:05.320
Pod Culture asks, how many system launches is OLR covered?

02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:09.800
Um, so I mean, launches, we weren't on the air.

02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:12.040
So our first show was in 2002.

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:16.520
And even though we were pretty exclusively about music games in those early years, like,

02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:18.280
you know, it came up all the time.

02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:19.640
We would still get tangents.

02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:22.440
You know, Dark Soccer loved her classics and her Dreamcast and stuff.

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:25.880
So we would take tangents all the time outside the music and stuff.

02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:32.280
So I would say we were covering the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast and we were covering that era.

02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:35.720
But it was kind of like, we didn't cover the launch, obviously,

02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:38.840
because Dreamcast came out in 99, PS2 was what, 2001.

02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:40.920
So we weren't quite on the air yet.

02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:45.800
I remember one of the big things was I just got my Japanese PlayStation 2 before OLR started.

02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:47.320
So that was like a thing.

02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:51.400
Um, so when it comes to launches, then we did like PlayStation 3.

02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:54.200
And I think Xbox 360 was just before that.

02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:54.920
And then PS3.

02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.240
And I think Wii came out around the same time.

02:21:57.240 --> 02:22:01.080
So we covered all that because that was the big lines where we were handing out donuts and stuff.

02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:04.360
Uh, and then of course we did the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:06.440
And then now the PlayStation 5 and so forth.

02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:11.080
So, um, as Bobby said in chat, this will be the fourth generation of the, of the big three.

02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:11.720
And that's about right.

02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:19.160
3DS and Nintendo DS and Vita and PSP.

02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:22.120
And I think, uh, and Amico next year.

02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:31.160
Um, let's see the, um, let's see, uh, what was I going to say to, um, Xbox?

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:35.320
The original Xbox had also already been out, uh, when the show started.

02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:40.360
I, I bought my Xbox, I think a couple months into doing the show.

02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:43.960
Cause I finally bought one for Halo and, uh, to play DDR.

02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:45.960
So, uh, yeah.

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:46.120
Yeah.

02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:47.800
All three consoles are out by 2002.

02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:52.200
So it's, it's been a lot, but it's also interesting to think considering that we've been doing

02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:54.280
this Loki for 18 and a half years.

02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:59.080
Um, it is interesting to think it's actually not that many.

02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:03.560
When you think just how long we've been doing this show, it's not that many launches all

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:04.440
things considered.

02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:08.200
This is the first one that should have been, this was supposed to be a 10 year generation.

02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:09.560
Well, this is the first one.

02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:11.000
This is the first one in a pandemic.

02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:13.720
So it'll be interesting.

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:13.960
All right.

02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:14.680
Anyway, sorry.

02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:17.240
Uh, tangent question, but I thought it was a good one.

02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:21.000
Uh, going to, uh, Japan and checking out the releases there.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:27.080
We have coming out on the 29th, Mad Rat Dead, Shantae and the Seven Sirens on Nintendo Switch.

02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:29.240
Uh, Shimagami Tensei 3 Nocturne.

02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:30.920
It's an HD remaster of that.

02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:31.640
Cool.

02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:36.360
Uh, and then Common Rider Memory of Heroes, uh, is coming out as well in Japan.

02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:37.560
That's on the Switch.

02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:42.920
And also Taishu Cross Alice Heads and Tails is coming out as well.

02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:47.560
Uh, going over to the PlayStation 4, I imagine we're going to see some overlap.

02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:48.360
Uh, yeah.

02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:52.120
Watch Dogs Legion actually is also out, uh, this coming week in Japan.

02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:53.080
So that's pretty cool.

02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:54.840
As is the Mad Rat Dead.

02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:57.480
Uh, there is a Kemco RPG selection.

02:23:57.480 --> 02:24:03.400
It's volume five of some various RPGs from over the years by Kemco put together in that,

02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:08.520
including As Divine Menace, Wizards of Brandel, Sea Carts and Innocent Revengers.

02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:10.280
Those are all the games that are going to be in it.

02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:13.400
Uh, and then Shimagami Tensei remaster is out on PS4.

02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:17.240
Uh, Saints Row the Third remastered gets its Japanese release.

02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:19.320
So they must've done some things to localize it for Japan.

02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:20.520
Cause that came out here a while ago.

02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:24.120
Uh, it was on the Switch probably I'm guessing, right?

02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:25.320
This one's on the PlayStation 4.

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:27.160
Oh, PlayStation 4.

02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:27.720
Yeah.

02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:28.760
That's been a while.

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.440
Yeah, but they, they might've localized it.

02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:30.920
I don't know.

02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:32.920
That's why sometimes why it's a little delayed in Japan.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.080
Some of the releases that are a little more, uh, made for this audience, they take a while

02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:38.120
to localize.

02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:43.960
Uh, Common Rider Memory of Heroes also released on PlayStation 4 this week and, uh, a price

02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:48.680
reduction and game of the year edition for Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.

02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:50.520
How about the UK, Loki?

02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:57.720
Um, in the UK we've got Cobra Kai, the Karate Kid Saga continues on PlayStation 4 and Xbox

02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:03.480
One looks like Company of Heroes 2 All Out War Edition on PC.

02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:09.400
Who Wants to be a Millionaire on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:14.120
Watchdog Legion on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.400
Mortal Shell on Xbox One.

02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:24.440
We've got the Dark Pictures Anthology Volume One on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:27.640
Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Nintendo Switch.

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:31.160
Ninja Legends on PlayStation 4.

02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:38.040
The Dark Pictures Anthology Little Hope on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:45.560
And last but not least, Dead Cells Prisoners Edition on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:48.040
All right.

02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:51.560
So lots, you know, we're getting into November when all the games are going to come out.

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.640
So, uh, busy, busy, busy.

02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:54.120
All right.

02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:57.960
We are going to now, uh, get back into some other news.

02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:00.280
Um, I can't believe it's already 8 30.

02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:03.400
So we may cover this news a little quickly because we want to get some of your questions.

02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:04.680
There's no emails tonight though.

02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:07.240
So we, we only have time for questions at the end.

02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:09.320
Hopefully we'll get some, but we have a few stories first.

02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:09.820
Loki.

02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:11.000
Yeah.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:18.680
So, um, Mojang announced that they're going to be migrating everybody over to Microsoft

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:23.640
accounts, including folks that are, well, I should say only the Java edition players

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:28.520
of Minecraft because everybody already is on Minecraft or, um, Microsoft accounts.

02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:32.040
If you're playing Minecraft on consoles or the windows 10 edition.

02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:36.760
Um, so they are going to be migrating folks over to Microsoft accounts.

02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.360
You're going to have to create one for the Java edition soon.

02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:45.960
Um, which will allow you to have the two factor authentication and, you know, improve parental

02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:48.120
controls and all that wonderful stuff.

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:52.920
Nothing else really changed about the game aside from how you log into it, instead of

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:56.360
having to have a separate Mojang account or Minecraft.net account.

02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:02.440
Uh, you'll be able to log in using that to incentivize people to do so.

02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:06.280
Um, you will actually get a free Cape.

02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:09.880
So they're going to offer you a free Cape that you can use for your character as well.

02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:14.360
Um, and starting this fall, you'll have to create those Microsoft accounts.

02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:20.520
So they haven't really specified a specific date yet, but it'll be pretty easy to do that.

02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:24.920
I kind of liked that cause I don't use the Java version too often.

02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:30.120
So I tend to forget my Mojang, um, login credentials.

02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:34.440
So, um, it'll be nice to just have it all under one.

02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:39.320
But some people are trying to equate this to the Facebook Oculus thing and I'm like,

02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:42.600
no, not necessarily.

02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:44.360
It doesn't seem nearly as bad.

02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:50.280
No, they're the, I mean, you have to have a Microsoft account already for like the other

02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:53.160
versions of, um, Minecraft.

02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:57.240
And it's not necessarily like, this isn't tied to like social media or anything.

02:27:57.240 --> 02:27:59.320
They're not requesting your real name.

02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:00.520
They don't really care.

02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:05.240
It's just, it's just basically a centralized, um, login service.

02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:05.960
It makes sense.

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:10.040
I mean, why have it just for consistency across the board?

02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:15.560
Why would you have a separate login for the Java version versus everything else?

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:19.320
You just, it's much more simpler than maintain one system.

02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:21.400
Especially one that they're using across all their products.

02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.400
I don't see the point in having to create a separate login and maintain that.

02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:28.040
Um, it's much easier.

02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:30.600
And plus this way too, it makes it a lot easier.

02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:34.440
Cause, um, I know I'm not sure if they're still offering it, but they used to be, if

02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:38.840
you buy the Java version, you get the windows 10 version for free.

02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:44.920
And it's just easier to link that all together this way versus having to give you a key that

02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:50.920
you then go log into your windows 10 account and, you know, get the game that way.

02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:52.040
It doesn't make any sense.

02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:53.640
It's just, it's much easier.

02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:58.520
So, uh, and I, I'm, I also failed to see what the big deal is about this, honestly,

02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:00.840
but I want to, you know, let every gamer have a voice.

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:06.040
And I see in chat, Zen monkey 11 says, no, thank you Mojang and says, just make Java

02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:07.800
open source or leave it be.

02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:11.960
And I can kind of get that perspective is that, you know, Java is kind of like, wow,

02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:14.760
classic in a way, you know, it's, it's caters to

02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:16.360
a very specific audience.

02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:20.280
Um, and I can also understand where it's just kind of like, just, just let it, let it,

02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:23.000
let it live in its own little corner and stop bothering it.

02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:25.000
Do you see that perspective?

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:25.500
Loki?

02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:29.000
No, I mean, they're, they're still doing upgrades for it and everything.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.800
I don't see, I don't really see an issue with this.

02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:37.320
I don't equate this to be the same thing as, um, what Facebook's doing with Oculus.

02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:39.480
Well, and it is, it isn't, I'm saying some people.

02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:42.840
And I also agree cause Rama says that's a stretch and I agree.

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:45.960
And Bobby says the Facebook Oculus thing is because Facebook can decide you shouldn't

02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:47.320
have an account for whatever reason.

02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:49.480
And that means you can't use an Oculus device.

02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:53.640
For instance, if you don't use your exact legal name, boom, no Oculus.

02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:59.560
Um, which is one of many reasons why I'm going to say I will never buy an Oculus and I'm

02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:04.040
going to encourage all my friends, including Bobby Blackwolf, who is a VR guru.

02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:04.600
I understand.

02:30:04.600 --> 02:30:05.640
But I already have one.

02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:06.600
You know what?

02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:07.240
And that's fine.

02:30:07.240 --> 02:30:10.920
And I understand because Bobby might be like, I need one because I'm such an enthusiast.

02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:11.400
Fine.

02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:12.280
I'll let it go.

02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:14.120
But I'm going to be actively encouraging people.

02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:19.400
I know not to buy Oculus because then there was a whole thing this week about you can't

02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:21.400
like share things on the store.

02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:24.120
Or like if you delete your Facebook account, then you basically lose everything you've

02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:24.840
bought.

02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:26.920
It's it's bad.

02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:29.000
Like, no, thank you.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:36.200
I mean, I will say thank you Facebook for making the decision of which VR platform to

02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:41.720
go with on the PC a lot easier for me by taking yourselves out of the equation.

02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:44.360
Thank you.

02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:48.280
You can't have multiple quests, one quest per account, because they're afraid you're

02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:50.760
going to give a quest with your account to someone else.

02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:51.320
Yeah.

02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:51.960
But all right.

02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:54.280
Anyway, so I think I think we've made it very clear.

02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:57.080
It's not the same thing, even though some people are trying to say it is.

02:30:57.080 --> 02:31:02.120
But I also like this way, like like I think here's one of the things I think that they're

02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:02.440
trying to do.

02:31:02.440 --> 02:31:08.280
They're trying to get parity across Java and the bedrock conditions already.

02:31:08.280 --> 02:31:14.360
So what I think they're trying to shoot for here is with maybe 117 that they're going

02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:15.560
to try.

02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:20.440
Maybe they're going to have enabled some sort of cross play option for Java and bedrock

02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:24.840
to be able to do it that way, because I know right now it's still very different.

02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:27.560
And there's like features that are in one that aren't in the other one.

02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:31.720
But maybe the end goal is to have everybody be able to play together if they want to.

02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:37.800
And definitely, you know, the new log in doesn't affect anything like modding or using like

02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:39.240
bucket or any of that stuff.

02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:46.200
It's just strictly instead of using your Microsoft to count the log in, you'll use your or your

02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:47.400
Minecraft log in.

02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:49.400
You'll just use your Microsoft log in.

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:49.640
Okay.

02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.240
All right.

02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:55.480
Well, let's move on and talk about another hot Microsoft property, and that's Halo.

02:31:55.480 --> 02:32:02.920
And Halo, the Master Chief Collection, I believe was a launch title for Xbox One, if I am not

02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:03.560
mistaken.

02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:04.920
No, maybe not a launch title.

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:06.280
It was pretty close.

02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:08.440
It was pretty close, if not like a launch.

02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:13.160
But anyway, it had some rough spots when it first came out, but they've been working on

02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:16.280
it consistently really throughout the years to make it better.

02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:17.880
And it's in a really good place right now.

02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:23.160
And it's going to be further upgraded to essentially be a bit of a launch title for Xbox Series

02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:25.480
X as well as S as well.

02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:32.040
So November 17th, Halo, the Master Chief Collection is going to get some upgrades.

02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:38.840
And that means you will now be able to play the game at 120 frames a second on both X

02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:42.680
and S. On X, you can do this in 4K.

02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:43.880
That's pretty cool.

02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:46.520
So it's going to be a smooth game.

02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:48.760
Can I find a TV that can actually support that?

02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:49.400
Probably not.

02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:52.600
Oh, but as a quick aside, Loki, you might get a kick out of this.

02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:55.160
I bought my 4K TV yesterday.

02:32:55.160 --> 02:32:58.840
It's just I'm having it delivered so that they can take the box and all that crap out

02:32:58.840 --> 02:33:00.280
of here and that stuff.

02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:01.880
I did it all through Costco.

02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:03.400
It's only 20 bucks to do that through Costco.

02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:04.120
So I was like, whatever.

02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:07.080
And so I bought my TV.

02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:09.640
So and I'm sure you're all dying to know, what did I end up going with?

02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:12.040
Did I get the OLED I'd been talking about?

02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:13.880
No, I did not.

02:33:13.880 --> 02:33:18.200
I finally decided that was just a little too expensive for me.

02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:19.400
Not knocking the TV.

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:21.320
They're pretty devices.

02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:22.840
So I did not get that.

02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:30.120
I did get the Samsung QLED, which was kind of like the other kind of fancier

02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:30.840
LED.

02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:34.840
I'm aware it's not the same thing as OLED and the whole concept of the pure black and

02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:35.480
all that stuff.

02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:41.160
But I felt for the price I was willing to spend, it was pretty enough.

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:44.920
So that's my new TV.

02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:47.480
And that's getting here on this coming Friday.

02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:49.880
So I'll be able to talk more about that on the next OLR.

02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:53.800
But I will actually be able to enjoy my Xbox Series X.

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:57.160
That's another reason I had to be a little bit price conscious is like getting a TV and

02:33:57.160 --> 02:33:58.120
a new console.

02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:00.440
I could not do a TV and two new consoles.

02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:02.840
So PlayStation 5 has to wait for next year.

02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:08.520
But TV and one console, it's going to be nice that I'm going to be having that because it's

02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:11.560
almost like it's going to be just a new gaming experience.

02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:15.160
It's the first time I really will have been doing a lot of gaming in 4K.

02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:17.640
I've done this much on my PC.

02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:21.480
And it's things that will actually run on my current setup in 4K, which is stuff like

02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:22.600
Diablo 3.

02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:24.120
Wow, wow is 4K right now.

02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:25.800
So yeah.

02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:28.440
So I'm really excited to check something like this out.

02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:30.600
Like Halo, the Master Chief Collection.

02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:37.480
And I think it's pretty nice on Xbox how you have Game Pass is going to have all these

02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:38.120
games on it.

02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:44.200
It's like you're going to have quite a few games to check out right away or yeah.

02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:49.160
Only Sonic says you need HDMI 2.1 or something like that.

02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:50.360
This TV does have it.

02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:51.960
So it's a new enough model to have that.

02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:54.840
DJ Rama S says Rob, what size TV?

02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:57.640
65 inch, which is five inches more than I have now.

02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:02.760
No one special says can the human eye even see 120 frames per second?

02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:05.880
I don't know.

02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:10.840
I didn't think they could see 60 and yet I can see it for what it is.

02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:12.040
So anyway.

02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:15.160
All right, let's move on.

02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:17.800
Next story.

02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:18.920
You want to talk about this, Logie?

02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:20.520
It's our favorite.

02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:21.640
It's our favorite company.

02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:35.400
Yeah, so Konami has re-upped their trademarks for Goemon and apparently a spinoff of the

02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:37.080
Suikoden series.

02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:44.840
So they've upped their trademark for Gensou Sui Gaiden and Ganbare Goemon, an emotional

02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:45.560
voice system.

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:53.240
So that was the system that was implemented by the Tokimeki Memorial series.

02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:53.800
Oh, yeah.

02:35:57.480 --> 02:35:58.040
Cool.

02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:00.280
I wonder what they plan on doing with that.

02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:04.280
They probably don't necessarily plan on doing much with it aside from maybe re-releasing

02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:07.560
some of this stuff or doing collections or something.

02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:09.960
Maybe they'll do a Goemon collection.

02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:14.840
Going on collection would be awesome, especially with all these collections on the Switch where

02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:18.440
the Mana collection where they actually localize things.

02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:21.240
Like, I would give Konami a little credit.

02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:22.440
A little credit.

02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:24.360
I love The Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:26.280
Yeah, there's a ton of Goemon games.

02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:28.040
They should localize some more and put them out.

02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:28.760
I think that'd be cool.

02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:31.960
Not Nino Kuni collection.

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:32.520
Sorry.

02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:37.240
Kunio Kun collection that came out not that long ago with all the River City Ransom games

02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:42.120
and those guys and all those NES games, like the soccer game and stuff that had never

02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:45.720
come out on here locally.

02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:46.760
I think that would be really awesome.

02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:53.320
Orange Rite does point out they did just announce a new Tokimeki Memorial game for the Switch.

02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:56.600
It's a girl's side game, if I recall correctly.

02:36:56.600 --> 02:36:58.440
I hope they make another anniversary collection.

02:36:58.440 --> 02:36:59.400
Those were neat.

02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:02.360
And Pesto Pacas is laughing at my Nino Kuni collection.

02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:06.440
Well, with that news on level five last week, sadly, that's never going to happen.

02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:08.360
That's sad.

02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:11.800
So but yeah, I you know what?

02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:15.480
I didn't think it would necessarily be for a Goemon collection.

02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:20.440
I thought, oh, maybe they're working on a new game, but I somehow the idea of a Goemon

02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:23.080
collection as opposed to them doing a new game sounds better.

02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:26.520
Stick to what you stick to your history.

02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:29.800
All right.

02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:30.440
Yeah.

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:30.920
Yeah.

02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:31.160
All right.

02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:32.440
You have another one for us, Logie.

02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:38.200
Sorry, I've been like trying to fight with the new PlayStation.

02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:40.200
Store page, the website.

02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:43.640
Oh, no, I haven't looked at it and I heard it's garbage.

02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:44.600
It's garbage.

02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:51.880
So like I forgot to get my PlayStation Plus games for October and I have this button here

02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:53.160
says join PlayStation Plus.

02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:57.800
I'm like, well, that's weird because I'm on PlayStation Plus and I've already been paying

02:37:57.800 --> 02:37:58.360
for it.

02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:00.920
So why can't I download my games?

02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:02.520
And that's just in a big loop.

02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:03.960
Get the games, click the button.

02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:05.880
It takes me to a page where they want me to join.

02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.600
But I've already joined and I'm also logged in.

02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:11.240
So what the hell?

02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:13.000
It's garbage.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
Did they add titles of games yet?

02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:18.840
We mean titles of games.

02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:20.200
I guess I was like, I don't know.

02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:23.880
They said I was reading some website that was like, when you're in the store, you see

02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:26.600
the box art, but you don't even see what the whole name of the game.

02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:32.200
And you can't even see what is Minecraft, the game versus Minecraft DLC packs and all

02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:32.840
this other stuff.

02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:34.120
It's just so hard to tell the difference.

02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:34.680
I don't know.

02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:38.440
Right now, I'm on the PlayStation Plus page and it's all get the game.

02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:39.320
So I click the button.

02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:44.120
It takes me back to the PlayStation Plus page, which says join PlayStation Plus.

02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:46.280
I don't want to join it because I already have.

02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:46.840
I'm on it.

02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:47.480
It renews.

02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:48.440
In fact, a couple of days.

02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:53.160
So I guess I got to go through my system.

02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:57.240
What the hell, man?

02:38:57.240 --> 02:38:58.280
I don't get it.

02:38:58.280 --> 02:38:59.400
Anyways, sorry.

02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:00.760
No, it's fine.

02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:02.440
I want to know how that was greenlit too.

02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:08.840
Um, but anyways, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, actually funny enough, I forgot

02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:11.080
to mention this back when we were talking about Minecraft.

02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:16.920
So you may remember that Minecraft, uh, Steve was added to, uh, super smash brothers.

02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:22.200
Well, there's been a small tweak that they have done because apparently it wasn't that

02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:22.520
small.

02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:29.320
His winning pose had him holding a cooked piece of beef.

02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:34.200
And fortunately it looked like a pixelated penis, um, on the screen.

02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:37.000
How did that get by the Nintendo?

02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:38.920
I don't know.

02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:39.560
Whatever.

02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:40.360
It's pretty funny.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.160
So they said, Steve, you need to put your meat away.

02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:44.440
Yes.

02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:47.160
So you're excited you want, but you need to put your meat away.

02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:49.160
He's not holding his meat anymore.

02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:50.280
Um, so that's funny.

02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:51.800
Okay.

02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:57.480
So, um, if we still, you know, back to, you know, kind of a throwback to when we were

02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:04.600
talking about earlier, how, um, certain, certain people at certain game companies feel that,

02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:10.360
you know, gamers should pay to stream their games because they aren't making enough money.

02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:17.960
Well, I mean, as if it's any surprise with sports games, it's gotten ridiculous with

02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:22.680
the amount of like, um, stuff that they're throwing in people's faces.

02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:29.640
So UFC tried this a while back EA, um, putting, you know, little ad bumpers in there as well.

02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:32.600
Well, NBA 2k now has unskippable ads.

02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:38.520
That load before the, um, the game street fighter, street fighter five houses too.

02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:40.680
Cause it was a PlayStation plus game last month.

02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:44.600
And when you, before you get set up for a match, it's like present this match presented by,

02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:48.040
and like every single one I was getting was like the Capcom cup or whatever it was

02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:48.840
going on at the time.

02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:53.000
So it was a, it was a local ad, but it was, I kind of rolled my eyes.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:53.560
Yeah.

02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:59.400
So, so they have an unskippable ads for stuff like, you know, uh, converse snowfall,

02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:02.440
Oculus quest, um, all sorts of things.

02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:04.520
It's ridiculous.

02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:08.520
Also considering I'm kind of curious to see what's going to happen with this one.

02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:11.160
I mean, cause I, I get it.

02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:15.400
They're doing it while it's loading, but you know, these next gen systems are going to load

02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.600
much, much, much faster.

02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:20.760
Are they just going to artificially increase that load time in order to do these ads?

02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:23.720
It's it's garbage.

02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:29.640
Anyways, NBA 2k has basically put out a tweet, uh, seeing as many of you are aware in the

02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:33.960
recent years, ads have been integrated into 2k TV segments.

02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:39.560
Yesterday's 2k TV ad placement impacted our players experience in a way we didn't intend

02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:40.440
bullshit.

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:45.720
Um, as these ads are not meant to run as part of the pregame introduction, this will be

02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:47.400
fixed in future episodes.

02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:49.560
Thank you for your continued feedback.

02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:51.400
I don't buy that one bit.

02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:56.440
I think they just, they make the excuse, well, we didn't intend for this to happen, but.

02:41:57.640 --> 02:41:58.440
Well, it did.

02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:00.920
They're like, oops, we made a mistake.

02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:01.720
Whoopsie doops.

02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:04.200
You know, they're just waiting to see what the reaction is going to be.

02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:11.000
I'm telling you these guys that are trying to fleece everybody for, you know, microtransactions

02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:15.240
and season passes and all of this nonsense each year.

02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:21.480
Um, you know, not, well, I don't know so much about 2k, but like EA doesn't really even

02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:25.960
update their game very much year to year taking away features, selling those back to you or

02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:27.000
whatever the case may be.

02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:33.640
Um, and there's still demanding more money on top of all this, like, you know, endorsements

02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:40.120
with different, you know, food brands or, you know, with shoes or advertisements, you

02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:44.920
know, throwing stuff, they're making money, like tons of money off of this stuff.

02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:46.520
You can't tell me that.

02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:52.280
And then they're going to, you know, not them particularly, but I could easily see them

02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:53.160
jumping on board.

02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:58.200
If some AAA studio decided to start charging people to stream their games, get right on

02:42:58.200 --> 02:43:00.040
board with that because, Hey, that's money.

02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:01.640
Why not have all the money?

02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:03.880
Um, I could easily see them doing that.

02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:08.120
I mean, 2k and EA, I mean, it's just bad.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:11.800
All right.

02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:13.320
What, uh, there's another thing with EA, right?

02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:14.440
Yes.

02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:21.080
So EA talking about, um, you know, they're incredible, uh, loot box systems that they

02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:23.000
have with Madden and whatnot.

02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:30.120
Apparently they're the case that's pending in Canada, a class action lawsuit against

02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:37.000
EA, um, regarding their loot boxes that violates the country's criminal code, basically accusing

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.360
them of running unlicensed illegal gambling systems.

02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:47.160
And they're seeking damages for unjust enrichment arising from the defendant's operation of

02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:52.280
illegal gambling systems through the sale of so-called loot boxes in popular video games.

02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:56.200
Well, you know, this, this is serious shit when Canadians are not going to be polite

02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:57.000
about it anymore.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.480
This is the legal part of it.

02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:02.840
You don't know what will be in those loot boxes.

02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:06.120
And I'm not sure if they necessarily upfront with the odds on that stuff.

02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:12.600
They may be, but like, it's still, yeah, it's, it's still something that of course

02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:17.320
that several countries have brought up as far as saying that this type of stuff would

02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:18.520
fall under gambling laws.

02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:19.880
So I'm surprised that they haven't.

02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:25.960
In other words, the PlayStation five and Xbox series X launches may be a good time to get

02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:27.000
rid of this crap.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:33.640
Although we know they're not, we know, but, um, maybe Canada's not so subtly suggesting

02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:35.160
now is a good time to change their habits.

02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:36.600
Yeah.

02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:41.320
Um, so yeah, I don't know.

02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:42.440
I don't think they're going to change.

02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:45.960
Not until somebody steps in.

02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:46.280
Yeah.

02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:48.760
Until someone steps in to make them accountable.

02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:53.000
Here I am yet again this year sitting here saying Canada, save us all.

02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:54.120
All right.

02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:56.360
All right.

02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:57.800
Moving on.

02:44:57.800 --> 02:44:58.200
Let's talk.

02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:02.040
I seriously love Canada and all my Canadian friends hearts.

02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:02.840
All right.

02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:03.400
Moving on.

02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:05.400
Let's talk about.

02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:07.000
Oh, you know who else needs money?

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:07.560
Atari.

02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:11.320
Cause I don't think that computer is going to sell.

02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:13.880
Like I couldn't even tell you, is it the Atari VCS?

02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:14.760
Is that what they're calling it?

02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:18.040
I, this is a problem.

02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:19.960
Number one, this is a problem.

02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:24.600
I could tell you more about that Intellivision Amico, uh, than I could Atari system.

02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:26.120
And that's no shade against Intellivision.

02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:26.920
I'm not here to do that.

02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:27.960
It's so expensive.

02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:29.880
Their system is so expensive.

02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:35.000
I could tell you anything about that new Atari, except that $350 for the Atari thing.

02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:39.240
I think it's a real computer slash it plays Atari stuff slash.

02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:42.920
At one point I heard and stream was on it, but then I'm not hearing that anymore.

02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:45.320
Um, so it's a computer.

02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:45.880
Like it's.

02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:51.160
So anyway, let's talk about something besides that's not that.

02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:51.800
Okay.

02:45:51.800 --> 02:45:59.400
This, this, I understand, uh, Atari teaming up with Eunice, U N I S U N I S, uh, to release

02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:02.600
a Pong arcade machine for your home.

02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:07.080
This is a little different than the, uh, table sized ones that are a little more akin to

02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:09.400
like an arcade one, a one up bar top.

02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:11.400
This is a Pong mini.

02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:17.000
So it's a 7.9 inch LCD string screen and two dial controls that you can play.

02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:21.640
Pong with 10, excuse me, 10 different difficulty settings.

02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:25.160
Uh, there's no battery built in, so it runs on AA batteries.

02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:30.840
But, um, it's Pong, so I don't expect it's going to use a lot of power, uh, but you can

02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:33.640
also power it with a USB cable and adapters.

02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:36.120
So if you don't want to use batteries, you're trying to be eco-friendly, whatever, you do

02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:37.880
have that option as well.

02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:40.920
Uh, you can get it this holiday season.

02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:45.480
Uh, Arcade One Up will actually be distributing this here in North America because U N I S

02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:46.840
is a Chinese company.

02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:49.880
Uh, no pricing details yet or pre-order details yet.

02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:50.200
Yeah.

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:53.880
I noticed, by the way, I was at Target today and I didn't even realize this was a market

02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:59.000
Arcade One Up was getting into, but they are beyond just the, uh, replica arcade machines

02:46:59.000 --> 02:46:59.640
stuff now.

02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:04.440
Those little controllers that have games in them, Arcade One Up is doing those now.

02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:06.760
Yeah, they're garbage.

02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:07.240
Are they?

02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:11.960
I saw a Mega Man one, which I don't know why I'd get that because it exists on the switch

02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:17.160
and there was a Namco Pac-Man slash Mappy slash, uh, those games won.

02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:19.240
So here's the fun thing about those.

02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:23.960
So they, they are kind of garbage based on the reviews that I've watched for them.

02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:26.760
Um, it's mainly that the controller is kind of garbage.

02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:31.400
The games themselves emulate just fine, but you can actually, they're emulation boxes.

02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:37.080
You can load other games onto them, um, using an SD card, which is kind of cool.

02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:41.640
And then with that, you can also like hook up USB controllers to it and stuff.

02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:46.360
So it might be worth it for that, but like the, the included controller is not good.

02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:47.880
Okay.

02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:48.680
Okay.

02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:49.240
Interesting.

02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:50.120
All right.

02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:51.080
Well, I just thought it was interesting.

02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:52.760
They were getting into that line of business anyway.

02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:53.000
Sorry.

02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:56.120
The story was actually supposed to be about, um, Atari and the mini Pong,

02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:00.200
but it just shows to go arcade one up is really like, they're pre-

02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:03.960
I feel like two years ago, I didn't know a thing about these guys.

02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:07.640
And then as much as a year ago, it was like, oh, I'll never be able to afford that shit.

02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:09.480
Anyway, that's a company for rich people.

02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:12.440
And now I feel like they're showing up everywhere, you know?

02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:13.800
So this is very interesting.

02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:19.400
So, um, but you know, uh, you know, we're, we're, we're the 40 somethings now.

02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:21.880
I know you're not 40 yet, Loki, but we're, we're-

02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:22.440
I am.

02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:23.320
Oh no, that's right.

02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:24.760
You just hit that on September.

02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:25.480
Yes, that's right.

02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:26.840
So, so brand new.

02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:29.320
I wanted, I wanted to-

02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:29.560
Okay.

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:33.160
So I'm looking at the Atari VCS page.

02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:33.480
Okay.

02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:35.320
And I can't help but laugh.

02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:37.560
It's just ridiculous stuff that's on here.

02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:39.560
So I saw this thing at the very bottom.

02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:43.480
It said, uh, talking about like the features of their console, you know, it's like Ryzen

02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:47.560
processor, wifi, Bluetooth, Atari speaker hat compatible.

02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:49.640
I'm like, what the hell is that?

02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:53.640
So apparently they've released a hat that has speakers in it.

02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:59.080
You can listen to music or something.

02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:02.200
It's high fidelity microphones and stuff.

02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:05.400
They're in all sorts of businesses, that Atari.

02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:08.440
Hey, whatever happened to the hotels?

02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:09.400
I mean, pandemic.

02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:10.680
Those are still coming.

02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:11.240
Are they really?

02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:13.960
Cause that was the most interesting thing I'd heard.

02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:16.920
It like, as far as like using their brand in a crazy way.

02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:19.400
I thought those hotels sounded fascinating.

02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:26.920
So, um, I'm curious if it, I would, I would stay at one just to see, um, and see if it's,

02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:30.920
you know, what, or if it's kind of like, you know, garbage, but I'd be curious.

02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:32.120
I'd be super curious.

02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:32.600
Super curious.

02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:37.320
DJ Roma S says the speaker hat has been around for a couple of years.

02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:40.440
Bobby Blackwell says, I can't wait to go and stay at hotels again.

02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:45.080
Technically you can, but I, I understand the point you're trying to make and I get it.

02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:50.680
Uh, I can't, I can't wait to get on a plane again and I could if I wanted to, but now,

02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:55.160
now they're going to be, uh, selling the middle seats apparently on my favorite airlines.

02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:57.720
So, uh, I don't know how I feel about that.

02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:59.720
So I'm not in a rush to go anywhere anytime soon.

02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:06.040
Um, especially it's going to be, it's going to be a good several weeks after Thanksgiving

02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:09.080
and Christmas, because those holidays really worry me.

02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:14.760
Uh, I just don't think people are going to give a shit and, uh, we'll see.

02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:15.240
We'll see.

02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:19.400
Um, DJ Roma S says the speaker hat's been around for a while.

02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:20.040
Well, that's cool.

02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:21.480
All right.

02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:25.720
So this is the part where we would get to the listener round table and open up to our

02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:30.040
chat room for your questions, uh, or comments on anything we've talked about tonight or

02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:33.080
anything we haven't talked about yet that you hoped we would talk about.

02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:37.560
I would also typically do the mailbag at this time because you can send your emails every

02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:42.120
week to participate at orangelandradio.com and we read our favorite emails here on the

02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:42.360
air.

02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:44.600
But, um, there's an empty mailbag this week.

02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:45.560
We didn't get anything.

02:50:45.560 --> 02:50:51.160
We've had a, we've had a good run of, uh, mailbag weeks and dark soccer is not even

02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:52.920
here for me to talk about drag race with.

02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:53.720
So now what do I do?

02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:55.240
Loki watching drag race Holland?

02:50:56.280 --> 02:50:57.560
No, damn it.

02:50:57.560 --> 02:50:57.960
All right.

02:50:58.600 --> 02:50:59.080
Uh, okay.

02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:00.360
Good.

02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:00.680
Excellent.

02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:04.440
The chat room here with the save when in doubt, bring it back to food.

02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:05.800
SSU 100.

02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:07.960
Matt says rank your top three Halloween.

02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:10.920
Is it from a distance?

02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:16.360
I thought it said candles and I'm like, um, let's see bed bath and beyond.

02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:17.480
No, I know it's candies.

02:51:17.480 --> 02:51:17.880
All right.

02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:19.960
Rank your top three Halloween candies.

02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:24.280
I don't really eat a lot of candy.

02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:26.600
So like it's always tootsie rolls.

02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:32.280
Um, so that's what I, I've been just buying that stuff, you know, from the store and getting

02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:34.040
that, um, gummy bears.

02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:40.920
Um, and I don't know, I don't really like a lot of the chocolate stuff that they give

02:51:40.920 --> 02:51:41.320
out.

02:51:41.320 --> 02:51:46.360
Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.

02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:52.040
Um, I'm with hot pocketry peanut butter cups, probably very high on the list near the top.

02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:55.720
Um, I would say for Halloween candies, I'm trying to think of things that you usually

02:51:55.720 --> 02:51:57.960
see around Halloween that you don't see other times a year.

02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:02.680
I would actually, I would actually, you know, I never got those in trick or treat bags.

02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:04.440
Uh, and it's not actually my favorite.

02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:06.200
I like it, but it's not my favorite.

02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:11.480
Um, I would say, um, the Wonka candies, I see more this time of year than any other

02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:11.800
time.

02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:16.200
And so specifically like bottle caps, I've always really liked, you know, those, the,

02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:17.720
the soda flavored candy.

02:52:18.520 --> 02:52:21.560
I'm not as big on nerds, uh, and runts.

02:52:21.560 --> 02:52:23.320
I only like the banana ones.

02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:32.440
So, um, so I would say, uh, yeah, uh, uh, bottle caps, um, and, uh, vanilla tootsie

02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:35.720
rolls specifically, or any fruit flavored one.

02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:36.360
I like those as well.

02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:36.600
Yeah.

02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:38.280
I don't know if I like those.

02:52:38.280 --> 02:52:39.080
I don't know.

02:52:39.080 --> 02:52:40.200
We have a bunch.

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:40.760
I like that.

02:52:40.760 --> 02:52:43.720
I just buy like a five pound bag or a bite, like not five pound bag.

02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:45.400
It's like a $5 bag of that stuff.

02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:47.000
And it lasts for months.

02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:48.040
Yeah.

02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:50.840
And black and Pat says Kit Kats, Snickers and nerds.

02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:51.960
I would agree with Kit Kats.

02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:57.880
I always like, like if I'm just like at the convenience store and I'm like, I want candy.

02:52:57.880 --> 02:53:03.880
I usually will buy a Kit Kat bar or a Twix is the other one that I really like.

02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:07.480
Cause now all these companies are doing their crazy flavors.

02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:11.720
You know, ever since Oreo started doing it now, I feel like every sweets company is doing

02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:13.320
their crazy flavors.

02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:17.880
I guess that was the thing they had to do because of the dieting that everybody's doing.

02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:20.120
Made people start cutting that stuff out.

02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:22.520
So they tried to do crazy flavors to bring people back.

02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:25.960
But like Twix has like a peanut butter Twix.

02:53:25.960 --> 02:53:26.760
That's really good.

02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:27.880
And there's a cookies and cream one.

02:53:27.880 --> 02:53:28.920
That's pretty good too.

02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:36.760
So I'm liking the crazy flavor and Kit Kat is finally, finally doing some crazy flavors

02:53:36.760 --> 02:53:38.200
like they've had in Japan for forever.

02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:40.680
Like there were some apple pie Kit Kats I had not long ago.

02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:41.160
Really good.

02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:44.680
So those would be my answers.

02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:45.320
Good question.

02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:48.680
While we wait to see if any other candy or candies, sure.

02:53:48.680 --> 02:53:49.480
I'll take candy.

02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:53.000
If we wait to see if any other questions come in, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:53.500
stories?

02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:55.080
I don't.

02:53:55.080 --> 02:53:57.000
I was like, I feel like we hit everything.

02:53:58.520 --> 02:54:00.600
It wasn't really that big of a week.

02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:02.520
All things considered, there were just some big moments.

02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:07.960
I was gonna say Epic games has got the, uh, the, the, I know that they've got the, the

02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:09.640
Ghostbusters remaster.

02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:12.360
That's going to be free next week, which is pretty cool.

02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:13.640
I want to check that out.

02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:19.880
And then, um, there was also, what's the other one that they had for next week as well.

02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:23.880
Uh, Blair, which is going to be free next week as well.

02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:26.520
So check those out.

02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:31.240
Um, as Joe and Matt says, I used to like butter fingers, but as I got older, I'm not a fan

02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:31.880
of them.

02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:35.080
I still like them, but what I really liked, I don't think they sell them anymore.

02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:39.240
The butter fingers, BBs, the little, they were like tiny little, do you guys know what

02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:39.740
I'm talking about?

02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:45.580
They were like little, I think like a whopper, but it was filled with butter finger instead

02:54:45.580 --> 02:54:46.080
the malts.

02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:48.300
Yeah, I like those.

02:54:49.180 --> 02:54:54.060
Um, Bobby Black Wolf says favorite quote from my 1982 history book.

02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:55.020
Didn't read it.

02:54:55.020 --> 02:54:59.420
Uh, no one special 77 says favorite vog host.

02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:04.060
Oh, that's, that's a question that's asking for trouble.

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:11.740
Um, I'm going to say captain spike because I really want game buoy to come back regularly

02:55:11.740 --> 02:55:12.540
and slide kick.

02:55:12.540 --> 02:55:13.100
It's a tie.

02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:17.980
Um, let's see.

02:55:18.540 --> 02:55:19.100
That's it.

02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:20.460
I don't think we have any other questions.

02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:22.940
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says grandpa.

02:55:23.740 --> 02:55:25.660
Yeah, we want starboard power coupling back too.

02:55:26.300 --> 02:55:27.420
So, all right.

02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:28.620
Anyway, I guess that's it.

02:55:28.620 --> 02:55:30.300
We're not really getting a lot of other questions.

02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:32.060
We've run a pretty long show tonight.

02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:35.020
We've had a very busy show, lots of things to discuss, so I think we're good to start

02:55:35.020 --> 02:55:35.900
to wrap up.

02:55:35.900 --> 02:55:38.540
I want to thank you guys for coming out and supporting the show.

02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:42.860
Uh, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio and supporting us every week

02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:43.820
the way you always do.

02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:47.900
If you, uh, enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend

02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:49.340
or five about the show.

02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:50.860
Um, spread the word.

02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:54.860
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only put the voices that are here

02:55:54.860 --> 02:55:56.620
on the air if they're here.

02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:03.020
So, um, uh, tell a friend, uh, auto hosts on twitch go an awful long way, which by the

02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:06.300
way, um, if you didn't know, if you're not listening live, if you're listening on the

02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:11.580
podcast feed, uh, after we do the credits, we'll come back and acknowledge everybody

02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:13.900
who did the donations and the following.

02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:18.940
I have not been able to read hosts for the longest time because twitch got rid of that

02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:19.580
feature.

02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:20.300
Well, guess what?

02:56:20.300 --> 02:56:23.660
Y'all twitch brought it back, but guess what?

02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:32.300
What y'all you have to be logged in as the account and not one of the deputies essentially

02:56:32.300 --> 02:56:33.740
in order to see the list.

02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:37.820
So I'm logged in as Rob Roberts, my personal account, which is deputized to do whatever

02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:40.940
I need to do on bog network except see the damn hosting list.

02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:45.980
So I'm hoping we'll get that fixed unless, um, Bobby's going to copy paste for me.

02:56:45.980 --> 02:56:49.260
I don't know, but in future weeks I will be able to read the hosts again.

02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:53.660
So the hosting and even if it's an auto hosting, that stuff goes an awful long way.

02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:54.220
So thank you.

02:56:54.220 --> 02:56:54.620
Thank you.

02:56:54.620 --> 02:56:56.620
Bobby says there's 30 hosts.

02:56:57.260 --> 02:56:58.540
That's amazing.

02:56:58.540 --> 02:56:59.660
Thanks you guys.

02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:00.540
You guys rule.

02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:03.580
That's, that's way more than we had in December.

02:57:03.580 --> 02:57:05.500
It was like 11 when we first started.

02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:05.980
That's great.

02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:06.860
Thanks you guys.

02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:08.540
So auto hosts going off a long way.

02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:08.860
Thank you.

02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:09.500
Thank you.

02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:10.620
And then a five star review.

02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:14.940
If you use iTunes or any place that accepts reviews, we really appreciate those as well.

02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:16.300
Um, yeah.

02:57:16.300 --> 02:57:16.780
Word of mouth.

02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:17.740
That's what we got.

02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:22.220
So let's get to final thoughts, uh, and then wrap it all up.

02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:23.580
So I guess Loki will start with you.

02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:24.540
What's your final thought tonight?

02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:31.500
Final thought is I hope I get this, uh, code bit that I'm working on to actually work correctly.

02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:34.620
It's it really should be much simpler than what I'm doing.

02:57:34.620 --> 02:57:39.500
There should be no reason why it's not working, but of course it's not working for reasons.

02:57:40.780 --> 02:57:41.180
All right.

02:57:42.140 --> 02:57:47.420
And, uh, my final thought tonight is vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.

02:57:47.420 --> 02:57:48.860
And, um, I'm excited.

02:57:48.860 --> 02:57:52.620
I'm glad to hear there's many of you out there who have also been shy to play among us.

02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:55.740
So I'm looking forward to our first VOG among us night.

02:57:55.740 --> 02:57:56.780
I think there'll be a lot of fun.

02:57:56.780 --> 02:57:58.700
I don't know when it will be, but I'm I'm we'll work on that.

02:57:58.700 --> 02:57:59.260
So cool.

02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:01.100
Um, that's it.

02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:03.660
We're going to wrap up and, uh, roll the credits.

02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:06.460
Thanks you guys for being here and checking out the show with this week.

02:58:06.460 --> 02:58:07.900
Have a happy Halloween.

02:58:07.900 --> 02:58:09.660
Have a safe Halloween.

02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:11.500
Please remember COVID-19.

02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:13.420
We just like Shane was on at the beginning of the show.

02:58:13.420 --> 02:58:15.260
Thank you, Shane, for being here at the start of the show.

02:58:15.260 --> 02:58:20.940
Even though he has COVID he came here on the show virtually, of course, uh, tonight to talk to us.

02:58:20.940 --> 02:58:24.380
Um, and I hope that also kind of brings it home.

02:58:24.380 --> 02:58:26.140
Like COVID is real.

02:58:26.140 --> 02:58:32.220
It's out there and thank heavens, uh, Shane is, is relatively healthy through it.

02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:35.660
And, uh, not, uh, one of the more serious cases.

02:58:35.660 --> 02:58:41.020
Um, so I say that all because have a happy Halloween, but don't, don't be reckless.

02:58:41.660 --> 02:58:46.140
Science does not care about your opinions, uh, political or otherwise.

02:58:46.140 --> 02:58:49.180
So just because you wish COVID away isn't going to make it the case.

02:58:49.180 --> 02:58:51.500
Uh, so please keep that in mind.

02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:55.340
I'm not saying don't like leave your house, but just please take precautions.

02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:55.820
Okay.

02:58:55.820 --> 02:58:56.540
Take precautions.

02:58:56.540 --> 02:58:56.940
Thank you.

02:58:56.940 --> 02:58:57.420
Oh my God.

02:58:57.420 --> 02:58:59.500
Bobby miscounted and said it was 40 hosts.

02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:00.140
That's amazing.

02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:00.860
Thank you.

02:59:00.860 --> 02:59:01.260
All right.

02:59:01.260 --> 02:59:01.580
That's it.

02:59:01.580 --> 02:59:03.180
We really are going to roll credits now.

02:59:03.180 --> 02:59:03.500
Thank you.

02:59:03.500 --> 02:59:03.900
Thank you.

02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:05.020
Have a great week.

02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:05.820
