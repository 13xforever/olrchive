0	13160	This week, Twitch gets bigger and legal pressure gets stronger.
13160	17080	Long known to be a source of contention, copyrighted music on streams has become a large content
17080	21600	liability with Twitch choosing to delete large amounts of archived content from streamers'
21600	23600	channels where copyrighted music was present.
23600	27600	This is a complicated subject that I can't properly express in 20 seconds alone, so I'm
27600	31600	turning it over to your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to discuss this and
31600	35560	all the night's news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
35560	45600	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
45600	48080	where every gamer has a voice.
48080	56680	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 840 of our show.
56680	62320	For this October the 25th of 2020, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always by
62320	63480	my co-hosts.
63480	66400	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66400	67400	Hey.
67400	68400	Hey, Jamie.
68400	69400	How you doing?
69400	70400	I'm all right.
70400	71400	Yeah?
71400	72400	I'm in-
72400	76040	Well, I'll be honest, headache, but I'm here.
76040	77040	You're here.
77040	78040	All right.
78040	79040	Well, appreciate-
79040	81160	There's no bright glowy circle halo like usual.
81160	82160	That's okay.
82160	83160	That's okay.
83160	84160	It's all right.
84160	88920	But anyway, so it's okay for things to be dark and a little bit moody tonight, I suppose.
88920	89920	Moody?
89920	91520	Well, yeah, that would be me.
91520	94920	I'm trying to pick out everything on your shelf too, and I'm having a hard time.
94920	95920	Okay.
95920	101920	So I have my mini Impala from Supernatural.
101920	102920	All right.
102920	105800	I have my Sam Pop.
105800	111800	I have P-P-Puddin, Parappa, there's a Magikarp back there, I have a weighted companion cube,
111800	114480	and my pumpkin because it is Halloween-y.
114480	115480	All right.
115480	116480	Well, unfortunately-
116480	118600	I'm enjoying my Supernatural love because the show is almost over.
118600	122960	For those that are listening on our podcast feed, they can't see all that stuff on video,
122960	127320	but it's just incentive to try to be here when we record live Sunday nights at six o'clock
127320	132280	Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network, The Voice of Geeks network,
132280	134340	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
134340	135600	So we are live on Sunday nights.
135600	140280	And if you're a subscriber here on our Twitch feed, which I think you can pay five bucks
140280	147520	for, or you can use your free Amazon Prime subscription that will give you one free Twitch
147520	148520	sub a month.
148520	151720	You can use that, and that will allow you to access all the video on demand.
151720	156320	So if you're listening at home on your podcast feed right now through Spotify or something,
156320	160520	and you're like, I want to see Dark Sakura's recording space, you can hit up the Twitch
160520	162860	channel and check that out.
162860	166160	Also joining us, of course, as he is every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
166160	167160	Hello.
167160	168160	Hey, Loki.
168160	169160	How are you doing?
169640	170640	I'm doing fine.
170640	175160	And I see the listeners who are participating live tonight with us have recognized the game
175160	179000	behind you as Carrion, that game that came out not that long ago.
179000	181040	Is this something you've been playing lately or?
181040	187280	No, I just I have to think of a Halloween game and I could have done the other one.
187280	192920	I was kind of going with thought about Friday the 13th from the NES, but I was like, yeah,
192920	193920	that's a good one.
193920	197800	I'm sure we've done that before, but probably I haven't really played much.
197840	203200	I haven't really played any of this game, but I know that that they have as part of
203200	209120	that Devolver Digital E3 game thing that they did.
209120	210120	Yeah.
210120	211120	So, yeah.
211120	213520	So and I love the Friday the 13th video game.
213520	218200	I know it gets a lot of crap for being a terrible video game, but I don't hate it.
218200	219960	I think the music was good, too.
219960	221160	It was creepy, very creepy.
221160	224040	And those those first person sequences in the house.
224040	226280	I'm sorry, that was that was some scary shit.
226280	227280	All right.
227280	230720	So those of you that are watching us live can see we're on the four shot tonight, which
230720	233160	means we have a guest joining us.
233160	237080	And say hello, everyone joining us all familiar face here at Orange Laundry.
237080	238080	Say hello to Shane.
238080	239080	Hello.
239080	241960	Hey, Shane, how are you doing?
241960	243240	I've been better.
243240	246760	I was going to say, you don't look so great.
246760	249080	Do you do you care to share with listeners what's going on?
249080	256560	No, because I've already talked about it before and posted on social media that I got COVID.
256840	260240	So, like, legit, you tested positive for COVID.
260240	265440	Yeah, it was this this is probably why I got it.
265440	270720	I took a test so I would have to not go to school the next day because we only have one
270720	274880	car and my husband needed it for something else.
274880	281280	Like, well, if I take a test, then I won't have to have I can't go to school.
281280	284640	And I was already like I had like a sore throat and a cough.
284640	288960	I was like, it's a good enough reason to let me get tested and then you can just take
288960	289960	the car.
289960	293240	Well, I got tested and oops, it was positive.
293240	295840	So it was that.
295840	298120	There's a name for the show if I ever heard one.
298120	299120	Oops, it was positive.
299120	304880	Well, obviously, I'm I'm giggling about it now, but it's not, you know, it luckily we
304880	309200	can make a little light of it because your symptoms, although they've been lingering,
309200	312240	haven't been serious enough to send you to the hospital or anything like that.
312240	313240	Right.
313840	321000	So the sore throat and cough, the sore throat was the worst thing for me.
321000	330240	Thankfully, I'm on day nine or ten now and my sore throat went away yesterday.
330240	332480	So that's good.
332480	343160	A cough, fatigue, general just breathing issues and crazy amounts of headache.
344080	347800	I don't normally get headaches, so it's very frustrating.
347800	352720	Now what is interesting about this scenario, too, is that, you know, I wasn't here on Orange
352720	356120	on Radio a couple of weeks ago because I took a trip out to Idaho.
356120	359540	I'm not sure how explicitly I said this, but I went to go visit Shane.
359540	361760	Like Shane is, you know, one of my longest friends.
361760	365760	And we thought, you know, you and your husband take this situation very seriously.
365760	367380	Me and Alan take this very seriously.
367380	369720	So we don't really get to see other people a lot.
369720	372180	So we kind of figured that the risk was low.
372220	379020	So something that you guys may not know, two hours before OLR last week is when Shane sent
379020	384900	me a text that was like, boy, do I have some news for you type of thing.
384900	390660	So I had to get a test Monday and mine was negative.
390660	392380	So there's that.
392380	398020	So it seems likely that you probably got COVID like a day or two after I left.
398020	400020	The way the timing works out, right?
400580	407860	Yeah, I think maybe one day, um, and it's, it's, I guess, I guess the term is funny.
407860	410780	It's funny too, because Dustin didn't get it.
410780	412300	He tested negative.
412300	413980	We have two roommates.
413980	415540	They tested negative.
415540	421340	It's just me, the person who screams all the time about wearing their mask and will not
421340	424860	take it off even in the car if I'm going to go get drive.
424860	427900	So I probably picked it up at school somehow.
427940	432740	Shane is joining us to talk about video games and not just COVID, but I have to say, just
432740	437460	to kind of back up your story a little bit, like when I got there on Thursday and like
437460	440940	got to your house, you and Dustin were wearing masks in the house and so was I.
440940	443020	And I was like, well, I don't want to be rude and take mine off.
443020	444100	They're going to keep theirs on.
444100	446980	And there was a point where I was like, are we just going to have our masks on in the
446980	447900	house all weekend?
447900	451620	And I think Shane was like, yep, but we did.
451620	456860	We ended up, obviously it just, it became too much and you know, but, uh, yeah.
456900	461540	So, um, well, obviously, you know, the, our chat is lighting up over at twitch.tv slash
461540	462220	VOG network.
462460	466820	Uh, there's a lot of people wishing you well, and I'm hoping that, uh, you feel a lot
466820	467900	better very soon.
468180	472940	Uh, and the good news is you have been slowly, like it just seems like this whole
472940	475900	process is just long is what's, what's annoying about it.
476540	477100	Yeah.
477500	481740	I mean, once I kicked the sore throat, everything else is manageable to me.
482300	483980	I don't mind getting fatigued.
484500	489580	I don't, headaches are stupid and I'm glad I normally don't get them because they are
490340	491100	so annoying.
492020	497980	Um, the cough is like, whatever, but man, it does suck.
497980	499180	And it does take a while.
499180	504620	And supposedly starting tomorrow, I'm okay to do stuff again.
505180	505620	Excuse me.
505620	509540	I'm okay to do stuff again, but like, no, you're not like, I'm sorry.
509820	513900	Hey, hey, Shane, do you feel like you have an adult Maine Coon sitting
513900	515180	on your chest the whole time?
515820	516620	A what?
516620	519020	A Maine Coon, giant cat, big cat.
519020	520540	Oh, I hope not.
520540	521940	No, I don't feel like that.
521940	522900	It doesn't feel like that.
523060	528980	See, when I had pneumonia quote fingers, I felt like that all the time, but I had
528980	531860	the sore throat and I had the headache the whole time and I couldn't move.
532420	534900	I felt like doing nothing but sitting in the chair.
534900	539420	Thank goodness Animal Crossing had just come out, but still, yeah, I hope you feel
539420	539660	better.
540300	540660	Yeah.
540740	541460	Oh, thank you.
542100	542340	Yeah.
542340	547380	The doctor told me that he's like, you're probably not going to feel better really
547380	551180	for two weeks at least so, or like all the way better.
551180	554660	So I'm just gonna find a, I'm still not going to school.
554660	559340	I can't, I told them, yeah, I don't have a sore throat anymore, but the cough is
559340	561820	probably not a good thing to go back to class with.
562660	566900	So they listened and yeah, I'm still just going to take it easy.
566980	568740	I don't really have anywhere I need to be.
569140	571940	So let's just listen to your body first.
572180	576580	Uh, it took me six months, not six months, six weeks to fully get over all my
576580	577140	symptoms.
578060	580020	So listen to yourself first.
580020	583820	The doctors may tell you one, you know, blanket answer, but your body's going to
583820	584500	be the best judge.
584980	585260	Yeah.
585940	590100	Um, no one special 77 in our chat says the fact that Shane has yet to say
590100	594020	whatever during the call is a sure sign that he truly is sick.
594060	594780	Get well, dude.
594780	598820	Well, we haven't really talked about games yet, but I didn't bring you here
598820	601980	just to grill you about COVID, but I think it is one of those things people
601980	605060	are genuinely curious about, you know, cause it's, it's, it's everywhere.
605060	605540	Obviously.
605980	609540	Um, I mean, I'm laying in bed in the bedroom right now.
609540	611900	It's not like a normal studio experience.
611940	614740	I had to explain to the viewers why you look like shit.
614780	616700	Like, let's just, let's just say it.
616700	617380	What it is.
617380	619420	I'm not, my hair looks okay.
619420	621940	Your hair does not look like shit.
622620	625180	Like he's in bed with not bed hair.
625220	629500	I can tell Shane's like sick, like, but his, yes, your hair looks amazing.
629500	630100	I'll give you that.
630900	631180	All right.
631220	631940	Always does.
631940	632420	Thank you.
632940	633380	Okay.
634100	635020	Let's talk about games.
635020	639220	So obviously this whole COVID situation is shitty as it is means you get to stay
639220	640580	home and play a lot of video games.
640580	640900	Right.
641900	646460	So you've been playing a lot of the Pokemon DLC, right?
646460	647660	The Pokemon content, right?
648100	648780	Yes.
648820	649300	Oh my God.
649340	655180	I played it till like 6 AM the other night morning, something like that.
656100	657460	And I would tell us about it.
657460	661740	Cause I got to say, I don't, I mean, I know there is sword and shield DLC, but
661740	663340	I haven't played the first one yet.
663340	666460	So is this second one just like the first one, but with different
666460	667660	Pokemon or how's it different?
668460	670180	No, I feel like it's a step up.
670220	674460	Whereas the first DLC also kind of felt like a step up from the game.
674580	678420	Cause it was nothing but the wild area, but done a lot better.
679020	681660	This one is even better than that.
681660	686340	In terms of wild area, you know, there's some new legendaries, some new Galar
686340	690660	forms, but the part that matters is the Dynamax adventure.
691500	694780	The Dynamax adventures are what the max raid should have been.
694900	696740	And I cannot quit playing them.
696740	697700	There's so much fun.
699300	701620	What, tell us a little bit about what those entails.
701620	705020	So they're, they're, they're not quite like the raids, but there's some
705020	705820	similarity, right?
706460	706860	Correct.
706900	709180	They're like, they're a different style, right?
709180	713700	Because you still have four Pokemon against one, but in this one, you
713700	715180	don't bring your own Pokemon.
715180	719980	You are given a choice between like preset Pokemon, which is great because
720780	723660	then you don't see a lot of the same ones over and over again.
723660	726580	It's not like four legendaries against one thing that you're just
726580	727740	going to overpower really.
728380	731500	And nobody brings a fucking Magikarp that does nothing.
732620	734500	No, no, nobody brings a Magikarp.
734700	735460	I don't know.
735460	736900	Maybe you could get one on the way.
736900	737140	I don't know.
738020	741940	But anyway, you start out with four and you have to go through these tunnels.
741980	746980	And each at the end of each intersection is a Pokemon you fight just
746980	748300	like a normal max raid battle.
748300	749300	It has no shields.
749300	750740	So it's just one life bar.
751380	755540	And after you beat it, you and the other three people you're with get the
755540	760380	option to take that Pokemon with you for the rest of the journey.
761060	763140	And so you do that three times.
763140	764900	And at the end, you fight a legendary.
765340	771100	If you catch everything on the results screen, you get to take one of those
771100	776100	four Pokemon you caught to take back with what's great about that for people
776100	780780	like me is this is a fun way to shiny hunt while you're playing, none of the
780780	784940	Pokemon show up shiny, but at the end, the results screen where you pick the
784940	790860	Pokemon, if they're shiny and they have a one in 100% or one in 100 chance to be
790860	795260	shiny, it'll just show up on screen as a shiny, and then you take it and you
795260	796820	got yourself a brand new shiny.
797540	802420	Um, in fact, right before the show, a little, maybe a couple of hours, I ended
802420	808060	up getting a shiny, uh, legendary and I was super excited and it just made my
808060	808180	night.
808660	809660	Which legendary did you get?
810580	812100	Reshiram from black and white.
812180	812700	Oh, okay.
812980	813460	Congrats.
814420	814980	Thank you.
815340	820300	So is this kind of, um, one of the big, excuse me, is this one of the big, like
820780	825060	perks of this particular DLC is that you kind of get to do shiny legendary hunting,
825060	828820	which I don't think is something that's very easy to do in the games otherwise.
828820	829100	Right.
829100	831100	Maybe Pokemon go, but that's a non-issue.
832220	838660	Well, yes, I think the big draw for this content was supposed to just be
838660	844300	legendaries in general, but once the shiny odds for everything, plus the
844300	851740	legendaries that you, um, encounter in this new style of play, um, got figured
851740	854540	out, I think a lot more people were more excited.
855020	860060	Um, so yeah, the draw is legendaries, but for me it's yeah, shiny legendaries
860380	861540	or just random shinies.
861540	866780	Like, uh, maybe it was like my third or fourth time going through one of the
866780	871180	dungeons or whatever caverns I got a regular Pokemon.
871180	872580	I was like, whoa, I don't have this one yet.
872580	873140	That's awesome.
873660	875060	So it's neat.
875100	880460	I feel like my time is not wasted where max, max raids, I constantly
880460	881980	felt like my time was wasted.
883500	886420	Do you, do you think that they're going to end up doing a third DLC?
886420	889420	I know that that's been rumored for quite some time and, and could
889420	894380	potentially fill in the final remaining gaps and, and maybe make the national
894420	897100	Dexter's stop bitching, although I don't think they ever will.
897100	899620	But what do you, what do you think the status is on a potential third
899620	903260	DLC, just being a fan and follower of the series, as long as you have been.
904260	910420	Well, since my favorite Pokemon is not in yet, still, I want a third DLC.
911420	916020	If they didn't do a third DLC, I could see that still being okay.
916380	919380	And then next year we just get another new proper game.
920140	925540	Um, but if they were to do third DLC and not do a new proper game next year,
925540	929780	it's gotta be more expensive than what we've been given for, I feel like.
930060	933020	Do you think it's going to be a proper, um, game next year?
933020	936020	Or do you think it's going to end up being like a remake of either gen four
936020	939020	or like a let's go gen two type of thing?
939020	939420	What do you think?
939420	941500	I never want to let's go game after again.
941540	942860	So not no to that.
943100	944500	Well, I didn't say what you wanted.
944500	945780	I said what you think will happen.
947660	948820	Those are the same thing.
948860	954140	So no, I don't want nor think the let's go game should happen.
954980	958420	Um, I don't want a gen four remake either.
958420	960460	I'd rather have something new personally.
961100	963580	I'd rather have a third DLC over a gen four remake.
963980	964260	Okay.
964820	968540	Um, over at chat, uh, sg100 matt says, are the national deck
968540	969820	sirs still complaining?
969980	970860	Is water wet?
970980	973420	Like look at the responses to any Pokemon tweet.
973620	974260	Sorry, buddy.
974580	978740	Uh, at depth and chat says, uh, I don't think we'll get a third DLC, but I do
978740	981060	think we're getting Sinnoh remakes next.
981060	984380	So kind of on that train of the gen four remakes potentially next.
985900	986180	Yeah.
986220	991380	If gen four does come next, at least that means we're one step closer to a gen
991380	992980	five remade and that's all I realize.
994580	996940	Um, so anything else you want to say about Pokemon?
997900	998700	No, no.
998740	999060	Okay.
999780	1003580	Let's talk about another game that, um, you've been playing a little bit and I've
1003580	1006780	been playing a little bit, so I'm getting into my gaming week just a little bit, but
1006780	1008380	with good reason cause Shane's still here.
1008740	1013020	Um, so, and, and this is also one of the things where I've been sitting here for
1013260	1017340	several months now saying, um, I'm probably not going to do this.
1017380	1019300	I'm, I really don't have any interest in doing this.
1019500	1020460	I'm not going to do this.
1020780	1025220	And, uh, I went and did it and that is, uh, playing world of warcraft.
1025500	1029020	And the reason why is because, uh, Shane, you've been playing it a little bit
1029020	1032140	because of the, uh, well, actually what, what made you want to play that again?
1032140	1040420	Actually, two things, uh, just curiosity to kind of see how the game has been.
1040420	1047300	Cause even if, even if I don't love it or even like it as much as I used to, it's
1047300	1053100	kind of like revisiting something, uh, like your hometown or something, you know,
1053100	1057860	I spent a lot of time in that stupid game and it's just kind of neat to
1058020	1059660	check out every once in a while.
1060300	1062220	So that's one reason.
1062220	1066740	And the second reason was they, um, decided to do a whole bunch of additional
1066740	1069980	customization for the game, for the races.
1070020	1073940	And I thought one of the problems that game has is every character
1073940	1075620	looks very much the same.
1075660	1078540	There's not a lot of diversity in what you can make.
1079180	1083300	And they were really trying to step up the diversity.
1083580	1085140	So I thought I would go check it.
1086100	1088620	Yeah, I'll say that the character customization.
1088660	1090460	I'm going to get, that's a big win.
1090500	1094220	Like it's, and it's not, obviously the diversity stuff is a huge win,
1094220	1095940	but like, it's even more than that.
1095940	1098700	Like, it's just like the way you can customize like Torrens.
1098700	1102260	I noticed, I was like, dang, you can make a Torren look really good.
1102260	1104500	And it's, I was very impressed with that whole thing.
1104500	1105180	I will say that.
1105620	1108860	Um, but yeah, you know, I was, I was dragging my feet in the sand.
1108860	1109620	I'm like, I'm not going to do this.
1109620	1110300	I'm not going to do this.
1110580	1114340	And we have this long running joke on Orange Launch Radio that Shane has these
1114340	1118420	mysterious powers of persuasion where he can usually convince people to play
1118420	1120900	whatever game he wants them to play or do whatever.
1120900	1123700	But I was, I was standing firm on this one.
1123700	1126020	I'm like, no, I'm not dropping that kind of money on wow.
1126220	1128540	I'm not a huge Blizzard person these days.
1128540	1130380	Anyway, I'm going to sit this one out.
1130740	1134500	And then it's, you know, Rob, I got COVID and I'm bored.
1136340	1136740	Okay.
1137180	1137820	No, no.
1137820	1141100	Well, there's a, there's other stuff we're not going to bring up on the show.
1141100	1142100	You had a very bad week.
1142100	1142420	Yeah.
1143060	1143260	Yeah.
1143260	1144260	I had a very bad week.
1144300	1151380	Um, but also in my defense, I did not really ask you to play so
1151380	1154380	much as you offered to play.
1154660	1160260	I finally caved because you had a lot of stuff going on and I recognize that.
1160260	1163180	And I'm like, okay, if I could do this thing to make Shane happy, I'll do it.
1163460	1166740	And I was like, you know what, if nothing else, I'll have an educated
1166740	1167940	opinion when I talk about it.
1167980	1171660	And, um, my educated opinion is like, it's again, the character
1171660	1172820	customization is cool.
1173140	1178500	Um, the level squish is interesting, but I'm, I'm kinda, I don't know.
1178500	1181740	Like I, anything is always more fun with friends.
1182260	1183380	I like playing with you.
1183380	1186140	And I like playing with the small friend group we have that still plays.
1186140	1186420	Wow.
1186420	1188580	Wow is interesting when that's happening.
1188940	1192180	But like I was starting to do kind of like a little priest on my own and I
1192180	1195300	was running it back through the Missa Pandaria areas and stuff and kind of
1195300	1196420	like getting reunited with stuff.
1196420	1200700	And I have to admit there kind of came a point where I was like, Hmm, this
1200740	1201940	isn't really fun alone.
1201980	1204260	And it's not something I really like.
1204260	1206260	I was just like, I'm going to go back to Final Fantasy 14 and
1206260	1207460	get my goals done in that game.
1207860	1213340	So like, I dunno, I hope the expansion turns out well for that community.
1213340	1216580	Cause there's a great, you know, community there, but I can't say there
1216580	1221260	was like, as much as they talk about this, this, um, uh, Shadowlands pre-patch
1221260	1224340	was huge changes and huge things going on with the levels, which is the
1224340	1228660	biggest changes to the game since Cataclysm, like as much as I hear all
1228700	1231900	that, and I can see that from the technical levels and everything, I
1231900	1235540	just couldn't help but feel, eh, this game is the same old shit.
1235700	1239020	Like this really hasn't changed that much in 15 years.
1239060	1244540	Well, in the, since, since Blizzard started going down the, since Mike
1244540	1246380	Morhaime left, it hasn't changed much.
1247260	1251620	So I think both and 14 are fine games in their own rights.
1252140	1256620	What's been good about Lout is that it's a game I can kind of
1256620	1258300	turn my brain off playing.
1258420	1264860	Whereas 14, even if we do the same two dungeons on an expert roulette over and
1264860	1269700	over, and there's not much variance, I still somewhat feel like I have to think
1269700	1277900	more and wow, like I got a character from, uh, zero to 40 in like two days.
1277900	1281620	Cause I could just sit there and mindlessly play.
1281620	1287660	So maybe it's cause it's all old content still, but I don't know.
1288300	1291220	It's good for mana and stuff.
1291620	1295740	It is really fascinating how Blizzard has just basically said, okay, so old
1295740	1299700	world of Warcraft is going to go squish like, and you're going to get through it
1299700	1302180	in the blink of an eye, and then we're just going to move right on to the latest
1302180	1302700	expansion.
1302700	1307780	So they really are hedging like the future of WoW basically, or maybe not on
1307780	1311460	this new, I think WoW will still be, if EverQuest has like 20 expansions, WoW
1311460	1314500	is still going to be around a long time, but, uh, they're hedging a lot of the
1314500	1316420	future of WoW on this new expansion.
1316420	1319020	So, yeah, and that they ended up delaying.
1319020	1319620	So it'd be interesting.
1319940	1320220	Okay.
1320220	1321100	So we talked Pokemon.
1321100	1321860	We talked, wow.
1321860	1323980	Any other video games I've got to talk with you about Shane?
1326100	1326540	Okay.
1326580	1327540	We'll talk about that.
1327780	1332100	Let's actually tie that into the other kickoff topic I had planned for tonight.
1332340	1336140	Um, so Loki, if you don't mind me throwing the ball to you, uh, there was a huge
1336140	1337180	historic event on Twitter.
1337180	1340260	Everybody knows what this is going to be, uh, that involved that game
1340260	1341380	among us this week, right?
1341620	1343340	Uh, Loki, just so you know, you're muted and I can't hear you.
1344340	1344740	Sorry.
1344740	1345700	I thought I had unmuted.
1345740	1348980	It's 2020.
1348980	1351820	We're all used to asking when people unmute happens.
1351860	1352300	Yes.
1352340	1359260	So, um, uh, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, um, streamed on Twitch, which,
1359300	1360780	uh, she had teased about doing.
1361180	1366500	Uh, she is one of the representatives in the, I wouldn't say the house.
1366540	1373740	And so, um, it's just kind of a really unique thing because normally, you know,
1373740	1377460	you don't see a lot of these representatives and stuff, uh, connecting
1377460	1382780	with their constituents in kind of a more modern way, for example.
1382780	1389540	So, um, of course it was met with, you know, uh, a lot of viewers because
1389540	1392820	everyone was really interested in this and it was overall pretty wholesome
1392820	1396420	about it, but it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was,
1396900	1401260	it drew in over, uh, four thousand, four hundred and thirty thousand viewers.
1401420	1404300	I want to say that number's probably a little low because I think that's
1404300	1406820	just her stream was the peak on that.
1407180	1410340	But considering that all the other people that were playing along with
1410340	1414060	her, um, lots of other streamers, there's probably folks watching
1414060	1415060	through them as well.
1415060	1418060	So I would, I think that number's probably a bit lower.
1418220	1420780	And it was also, um, that was the concurrent viewers.
1420820	1424540	If you go and you, so now, and Twitch didn't always do this, but now with
1424540	1428420	the VODs or the video on demand, it actually shows a view count.
1428420	1432460	So like most of the VODs on VOG Network were one, two, three, four, five
1432460	1435940	views, you know, very few people going in the archive and looking at old shows.
1436300	1438620	Um, but now what happens, it doesn't do that anymore.
1438620	1441380	Well, it does for the highlights of the show, but like if you go back
1441380	1445740	and you watch the live uncropped version, basically with all the, you
1445740	1449140	know, standby, we'll be live soon and all that stuff, it actually shows
1449140	1452820	the number of views that this episode got while we were live all together.
1452820	1456020	So a lot of them have, you know, 120, 130, however many people
1456020	1457260	dropped in and out during the show.
1457460	1463020	My point is AOC's stream had, had 5 million less last I checked.
1463300	1466380	Now, obviously this made, yeah, this, this made news.
1466380	1469140	Maybe there were people going in and out several times during the thing.
1469300	1472020	A lot of people checking it out after the fact, I'm sure as it was linked
1472020	1475780	on all these news blogs and things like that, but that's, that's huge.
1475900	1476980	That's a lot of people.
1477540	1481300	It was, and it was really, it was really like a wholesome, the whole
1481300	1483420	thing was like a very wholesome stream.
1483780	1487100	Um, it was fun to see a lot of different content creators get
1487100	1490020	together to kind of pull this off because originally the whole thing
1490020	1493860	started off with, um, she was posting on Twitter, Hey, who'd be interested
1493860	1498580	in an Among Us stream and everyone's like, yeah, me, me, me, instant exposure.
1498580	1498900	Yeah.
1499140	1501500	So you had, you know, like lots of online personalities.
1501540	1505260	Uh, first off another representative Ilhan Omar was in there as well.
1505260	1505980	So that was great.
1506420	1509140	Um, yeah, she was vicious.
1510140	1516660	So many people, uh, yeah, you had a Hassan piker, a pokey main, uh, Dr.
1516660	1522740	Lupo disguised toast, uh, moist, critical myth, um, jacksepticeye.
1522740	1525860	I know Gus buckets or Gus Johnson was in there as well.
1525940	1527940	Um, uh, what was it?
1528020	1531740	Corpse husband who that guy had a voice voice.
1533420	1537740	Um, so yeah, it was just, it was a great, great event overall.
1537740	1543980	Um, lots of just kind of promoting folks to go to the polls, vote, um, get
1543980	1548340	registered to vote if you're not registered, um, I mean, it was just great.
1548340	1552220	And it was just like, it was a nice change of pace with all the chaos going
1552220	1556140	on, just to like, be able to connect with someone, you know, a politician in a way
1556140	1561340	that's not like just wanting to drive you nuts, it was like someone relatable at
1561340	1564300	least, and I think that's kind of what she was going for with that.
1564300	1566980	So overall really great.
1567460	1568020	For sure.
1568020	1572540	And over in our chat, SSJ 100, Matt, let me give you a, for, uh, for, uh, for
1572540	1576540	instance, game number one of the world series that happened that same night had
1576540	1579420	about 15 K concurrent worldwide.
1579420	1583380	And that's compared to the 400 plus K, uh, plus, plus when you count the
1583380	1587780	other streamers, the AOC had now, look, I'm not bringing this story up on OLR.
1587780	1591060	We're not bringing this story up on OLR necessarily for the political side of it.
1591060	1595260	Like it's no secret that, you know, the host of the show tend to lean a little
1595300	1595700	left.
1595700	1596060	Okay.
1596060	1598420	Like I know you've picked that up over the time.
1598700	1603220	Um, I don't necessarily a hundred percent agree with AOC all the time.
1603260	1606740	Like I don't necessarily agree with every of her ideas and things like that.
1607180	1609940	Um, but, uh, I agree with a lot of them.
1610780	1614780	And I was more taken by, as opposed to agree or disagree or any of that stuff,
1614780	1619340	putting all of that aside, I would like to think that if I was someone who leaned
1619340	1623860	right, I would still be somebody that would be pretty impressed with, and I
1623860	1630180	think that keyword is relatable, how she really made politics and politicians
1630220	1635580	feel relatable and it's, it's ironic that the whole game was called among us
1635740	1638580	because I'm sure there'd be some people that are gonna make the joke, LOL, she's
1638580	1644500	an imposter, but I kind of felt she was really among us, you know, and Ilhan Omar
1644500	1644940	as well.
1645100	1649980	And even, and if you want to talk about right-leaning versus left-leaning and all
1650020	1654460	that stuff, uh, during the thing she was talking about, shout out, because I know
1654460	1656180	other congressional representatives are listening.
1656180	1659620	She's like, I'm getting text messages from Justin Amash right now, da, da, da, da,
1659620	1663140	da, and she's like shouting him out and now he's talking about, and he's more
1663140	1667700	right-leaning, right-leaning, sorry, I can't talk tonight.
1668140	1671940	Um, but he's talking about setting up some type of Twitch feed.
1672140	1676420	Now this isn't the first time we've seen politics on Twitch, right?
1676620	1678540	We know Bernie had a channel.
1678620	1681820	We know Donald Trump had a channel, had a channel.
1681980	1682940	I think he might have it back.
1682940	1683340	I don't know.
1683580	1688460	But, but all that jokes aside, most of what you would see on both of those
1688460	1691540	channels, and that's a very left and a very right channel, most of what you would
1691540	1696780	see on both of those channels were just, eh, simulcasts of rallies, simulcasts of
1696780	1699940	other events that the news is covering, so on and so on.
1699940	1704180	What made AOC different and what I very much believe is newsworthy in the game
1704180	1707660	industry, no matter where you lean politically, what made that stream
1707700	1713740	interesting was that it was a political event bringing awareness to early voting
1714220	1718740	that was, that really went into what Twitch is all about.
1719180	1722780	It was a standing congressional representative, one that gets talked about
1722780	1728620	an awful lot, uh, getting in there, playing video games, having fun, and
1728620	1730540	again, that keyword relatable.
1730780	1736100	And you know, I've said this ever since I dated my ex 10 plus years ago, who you
1736100	1740020	all met at one point or another, and what, what was the message I took away from
1740020	1740260	that?
1740460	1742340	Any idiot can do politics.
1742340	1744700	If that guy can do it, you can do it.
1744700	1748940	And I think AOC, I think brought that same message in a much more positive way,
1749300	1753420	uh, that like, Hey, I like to play video games on Twitch too, and this is
1753420	1756660	something, you know, you could do if you wanted to get into politics.
1756660	1759860	I just, I thought that was just rad.
1759860	1763580	And like Loki said, I thought it was just like a wholesome, positive thing that
1763580	1767620	didn't get, I mean, sure the chat comments would range from, you know,
1767620	1769300	wholesome to dumpster fire.
1769300	1772780	But I just, who's, who has time to reach out in general?
1772780	1777380	I mean, on a stream who has time to reach out, it's scrolling by so fast.
1777500	1782260	I'm more into the actual, like, I'm more into the way she's acting when she's like
1782260	1786060	an imposter and she's like, I don't know if I can, I don't, you know, she's like
1786060	1788500	super skittish about it and she kills somebody.
1788500	1791660	She's like, I'm sorry, you know, and like all those things, it's just watching her
1791660	1793500	go through that was, was really something.
1793940	1798340	Uh, Jamie, I, I, I, did you catch this by chance or any of the highlight
1798340	1799460	reels after the fact or anything?
1800220	1802620	I couldn't because I was working on Project Nunway.
1802860	1803860	Oh, right, right.
1804460	1809860	So, um, I sadly had other priorities that needed to be taken care of.
1809900	1817980	Like, you know, uh, fighting a Google Meet stream with many, many viewers on it.
1818700	1819180	Fair enough.
1819180	1821260	Been doing my lines, so sorry.
1821380	1821980	That's okay.
1821980	1824380	I read, I read a lot of the tweets about it though.
1824380	1826940	And I was, she was just really, really cool.
1826940	1828020	Just in her tweets about it.
1828020	1829060	I thought it was really cool.
1829380	1829700	Yeah.
1830180	1833300	Um, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
1833500	1837900	Um, as she says, AOC grew up in my hometown and I'm friends with folks
1837900	1839260	who knew her back in high school.
1839420	1841180	She was always a hardcore gamer.
1841180	1844460	She was playing Smash Brothers Melee in the gaming club in high school.
1844460	1845180	That's pretty cool.
1845620	1849820	Um, you know, and I, and one of the big takeaways I took and, you know,
1849820	1856420	I, the reality is, you know, you've got the president doing these big
1856420	1861020	rallies and people aren't really wearing masks, people aren't really
1861020	1863500	social distancing, we can all see that.
1863500	1866900	It's not exactly taking the COVID guidelines seriously
1867260	1868300	and all that's going on.
1868300	1871940	And those big events, I mean, they are big and they draw several
1871940	1873460	thousand people, we know that.
1874140	1878460	But AOC, interestingly enough, found a way to do a big political
1878500	1884420	event in a very COVID safe pandemic, safe way, that reached out to a
1884420	1888260	generation that oftentimes doesn't get targeted with these types of
1888260	1891460	things and needs to have sometimes that fire lit under their butt to
1891460	1892620	go vote a little bit, right?
1892620	1897740	The younger generation and drew in 400,000 plus people while doing it.
1897740	1902460	So if you think about it, she just put on the biggest political rally
1902540	1904740	of 2020 on Twitch.
1905740	1909500	In a way, I realize I'm, I'm logically connecting some big dots there,
1909500	1912460	but I, I can't help, but find it fascinating.
1912700	1916300	And like Loki said, I was also kind of glued to the TV.
1916420	1920340	It was, it was just a good stream because she's also not one of those
1920340	1923300	streamers that completely gets sidelined with, you know, all the
1923300	1924620	other stuff going on on Twitch.
1924620	1927140	She was just in there playing the game, having a good time.
1927260	1932980	Shane, I've been making you wait, but you love Among Us and I'm sorry,
1933340	1938580	but what did you, what did you think of the stream?
1939940	1941260	Oh, I thought it was great.
1941540	1944940	Like, I don't really know what else to say beyond that.
1944940	1952980	I thought it was really informative and entertaining and like for what
1952980	1957460	you could kind of consider a political stream, I didn't feel it was preachy.
1957460	1964420	And I obviously lean towards her too politically, but like everything
1964420	1970940	was presented in a way that is not your typical old person politician.
1971100	1977380	And so it felt like it felt a lot easier to digest and like, okay, yeah,
1977380	1979620	this is just, this is great.
1979700	1980340	I loved it.
1980660	1981940	I watched pretty much all of it.
1982300	1983500	It wasn't preachy.
1983500	1984100	You're right.
1984100	1988020	But definitely there were little things that were being dropped.
1988020	1991940	Like when she talked to the guy from the UK about healthcare.
1991940	1994260	And then I think Pokimane was from Canada as well.
1994260	1996780	So she was kind of talking to them about their experiences with healthcare.
1997020	1998180	And she was asking all those questions.
1998180	1999780	She's like, so you can just walk into the doctor.
1999780	2000220	Wow.
2000220	2001260	You know, that whole thing.
2001620	2003460	And she kind of gave her perspective on that.
2003460	2005260	So, but you're right.
2005260	2009740	It came off in a way that didn't sound at least to me, but maybe, and to be
2009740	2013260	fair, maybe it's because yes, I agree with her more than I disagree with her.
2013580	2015500	But it didn't come off as preachy to me.
2015620	2019300	I thought it was just an interesting, she's just asking questions from people
2019300	2023260	around the world, literally trying to get to know her people she's playing with
2023260	2024460	and, you know, get to know the game.
2026260	2026460	Yeah.
2026980	2029940	So, um, uh, no one special is asking in chat.
2030300	2030620	Okay.
2030620	2031140	Question.
2031140	2033980	Normally, if a viewer makes a comment that a streamer doesn't like, they can
2033980	2037860	purge the comment or timeout ban the viewer, which is all fine and dandy.
2038020	2041740	Now, since AOC is a politician and Twitch is now serving as an avenue to reach out
2041780	2045620	to politicians about whatever issue, does purging comments, timeouts, bans, et
2045620	2047420	cetera, get a little iffy legally?
2047660	2049020	Um, yes it does actually.
2049020	2050420	It does get a little iffy legally.
2050700	2055420	Um, I believe the stream was moderated, but they didn't accept, like if somebody
2055420	2060660	came in there and wrote a pro Trump thing, I don't think they like legally or would
2060660	2062860	really have the time to remove it.
2062940	2067340	I think they just let it sit because, um, and this was a big problem.
2067340	2068180	You remember that story?
2068220	2072860	It was about a month ago about the military streaming on Twitch and they
2072860	2076460	started to ban people who had come in there and asked these questions about,
2076460	2080020	you know, certain, you know, military thing and all these things asking the
2080020	2084140	hard questions and the military started like banning people and people like suit
2084140	2085100	them over that.
2085100	2090540	So the military has a very like rigid policy on what they do and they don't
2090540	2094020	allow, but essentially as long as you're not threatening or, you know, do this,
2094020	2097780	you can go in there and ask about war crimes and stuff and they really can't ban
2097780	2101700	you. And so I, I think, and I don't really have all the details on how this
2101700	2105460	works, but I think the way AOC kind of approached her stream was similar.
2105460	2110380	Like if somebody had said something threatening or extremely gross, I'm sure
2110380	2116820	it got taken care of, but all the MAGA 2020 spam and all that stuff, it didn't,
2116820	2118620	they just, you know, what are you going to do?
2118660	2121860	You, you couldn't ban that stuff fast enough, right?
2121980	2125940	Well, speak, speaking of spam as you would, please.
2126500	2134180	Because of the popularity of this AOC driven event and among us, apparently a,
2134420	2143100	um, a guy by the name of Eris Loris, he went in and hacked among us to spam a
2143100	2150940	bunch of, uh, messages and cause like this, uh, black screen kind of, um, thing
2150940	2154820	where the map basically disappears because of it using some bots that he
2154820	2159140	created. So, you know, stuff, you know, saying like the whole hack your device
2159140	2162860	or blow up your phone, if you don't subscribe to his channel and then also
2162860	2169500	Trump 2020 at the end, apparently he, uh, he did cop to that.
2169500	2175140	He did it and basically said that, you know, he doesn't care that it's a small
2175140	2179780	company, you know, run by three people that they should have, you know, patch
2179780	2181580	their game up better or something like that.
2181580	2186980	And he did it for the, the lols and trolling people because that's what he
2186980	2193980	does. And apparently, of course, you know, when asked about whether, you know, he
2193980	2197380	was, you know, he of course added the bit in there because he is a Trump
2197380	2201540	supporter, but just kind of shows you the con, you know, the contrast between
2202220	2205540	how, you know, one side will try to get the word out.
2205540	2209900	And then the other side is just like, Oh, let's, you know, let's spam some, you
2209900	2213500	know, anger and hatred stuff because I don't like, I don't like something that
2213500	2214220	you guys did.
2214380	2217980	Yeah, that whole stunt kind of backfires for your team when you do that, I think.
2217980	2220100	So, um, not, not great.
2220340	2223660	And, you know, God, imagine you are the creators of Among Us.
2223700	2228700	Like, seriously, they created this game two years ago and, you know, it, I'm
2228700	2231980	sure it did well enough cause they were planning a sequel, but not nearly the
2231980	2233020	fanfare we're talking about now.
2233220	2237740	Two years after these three people put out this game, you have a congressional
2237740	2241420	representative playing it on a Twitch stream to the third largest stream of all
2241420	2241740	time.
2242580	2248420	That's crazy in a good way, you know, like just, just how far that game has come.
2248420	2250060	It's, it's, it's something else.
2250260	2250860	It's something else.
2250900	2251100	Yeah.
2251100	2254100	I basically said, he's all, I was curious to see what would happen.
2254100	2255540	And personally, I found it funny.
2255580	2258620	The anger and hatred is part of what makes it funny.
2259140	2264420	If you care about a game and are willing to go and spam dislikes, some, um, random
2264420	2267380	dueling internet, because you can't play it for three minutes, it's stupid.
2268740	2273540	So anyway, um, it's, it's sad that that is happening when Among Us probably doesn't
2273540	2277900	have the staff to be able to handle that fast enough, but I'm, I'm sure they will
2277900	2283700	get some help, but it's gonna be, it's gonna be bumpy as people choose to, uh, do
2283700	2286420	these types of stunts to pick on them or whatever it is they're doing.
2286420	2287260	It's, it's silly.
2287780	2292220	Um, Shane, I, I know you've been playing just a crap ton of Among Us and you were
2292220	2293060	really into this game.
2293060	2295940	What is it about this game that you enjoy and, and tell us about kind of like what
2295940	2298180	you've been doing because you've been playing on streams and stuff too, right?
2299060	2300980	Yeah, I've been playing with some friends.
2301060	2307740	Um, so I think my first way to describe it, which is like the best way I can, or
2307740	2312780	like, uh, yeah, the best way I can describe it is it's as close to playing real life
2312780	2315620	Danganronpa as I'm ever probably going to get.
2316820	2318500	Um, that's pretty cool.
2318780	2321260	I actually, that's a very apt description.
2321780	2322180	Yeah.
2322940	2325060	I, without pink blood.
2325620	2332100	Yeah, no pink blood, but like you all gather around like a little table at, you
2332100	2334780	know, after every, after somebody dies and you'd talk about it.
2334780	2336580	But, um, I don't know.
2336620	2344460	I like, I like being sneaky and murdering people while also convincing them I didn't
2344460	2348500	do it and making other people argue.
2348660	2353340	Like it's my game that it's just like what I want to do in real life.
2353340	2356340	Basically, so I don't know.
2356340	2356940	It's great.
2356940	2359340	Like last night I had a few rounds.
2359340	2364300	I had, I got to be imposter back to back and, Oh, I killed so many people
2364660	2366660	and nobody ever suspected me.
2366820	2371940	And I just, I kind of shut my mouth, let every, all the, the louder people talk.
2372780	2375420	They kicked each other out the airlock and then I just went
2375420	2376700	and I killed more people.
2376700	2377580	It was great.
2378500	2379580	It's just fun.
2379900	2384100	And the best part is for me is I'm playing right now with a group of people
2384100	2385580	that don't get mad about the game.
2385580	2390940	Like we may get loud during the, like during the discussion times, but after
2390940	2395860	like we either win or lose, like we're all just laughing and like congratulating
2395860	2398620	each other and, and just, it's fun.
2398660	2400700	Like you cannot play with randoms.
2400700	2402100	Do not play with randoms.
2402100	2405260	If you're playing the game, it will take all the fun out of it.
2405260	2406300	Play with people, you know.
2407380	2407820	All right.
2407860	2409780	So, uh, let me get some comments from chat.
2409780	2414340	So, um, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Shane is deep down a chaos monster.
2414580	2415020	True.
2415100	2416300	Oh, deep down.
2416300	2417260	No, that's pretty outward.
2419900	2425740	Uh, act Defton chat says, act Defton chat says to this day, I haven't played
2425740	2430300	among us, not even once, but I've seen a lot of videos and streams of people
2430300	2434580	playing it same, I'm almost afraid to play it at this point because I'm not
2434580	2435540	going to know what I'm doing.
2435540	2437420	And so many people have played this game.
2437420	2439300	Like they're going to be like, where'd you find the body?
2439540	2440620	I don't know.
2440660	2444380	Like I was, so I'm still technically new at it.
2444420	2448980	I forget the names of locations all the time, but you know, like, Oh, I'm
2448980	2452140	in the upper left side of the map and like, yeah, I don't think, I don't
2452140	2453860	think it matters about our engine.
2453860	2454780	I'm like, sure.
2454780	2456300	Yeah, that's exactly where I'm at.
2456620	2458260	And I'm usually telling the truth about that.
2458260	2458980	Cause I just don't.
2461500	2465420	So I, and this is another game where Shane has been trying to use his power
2465420	2468900	of persuasion on me and honestly, I'm not exactly resisting, like I'm
2468900	2470300	not opposed to playing among us.
2470300	2473700	I just, it has to be kind of like the right time in the right environment.
2473700	2477900	But so Shane, some things he keeps asking me when we're going to play.
2477900	2479420	Cause he wants to play with us.
2479460	2481980	Cause he keeps asking me to play with him, but.
2482500	2484900	Um, there's not a lot of people that want to play.
2485340	2485860	All right.
2485860	2486820	My niece plays it.
2486820	2488580	She's yeah, she's like a little kid.
2488620	2489300	They love it.
2489300	2490460	I'm like, wow.
2490500	2492300	So, so Shane pay attention.
2492300	2494100	Cause some things are starting to come together here.
2494100	2494540	Okay.
2494620	2495300	Listen to this.
2495740	2499780	Black and Pat and chat says, I haven't been able to get a group together to play
2499780	2501980	or been invited to play on anyone's stream.
2502300	2502700	Hmm.
2503220	2504220	Uh, let's see.
2504300	2510700	SSU 100 Matt says, so VOG game night among us when, um, pod culture says,
2510740	2513900	have yet to play it, let's get a VOG group together.
2514300	2515700	Hmm.
2515900	2516780	Hmm.
2517020	2518620	So maybe let's do it.
2518780	2519300	Let's do it.
2520500	2524740	As long as everybody's cool and not going to yell at each other for real and not
2524740	2527700	hold grudges, it's totally a fun game to play.
2528060	2528500	All right.
2528500	2531780	So we'll have a VOG among us night in the coming days.
2531780	2536900	So stay tuned, Black and Pat for your invite and a who a pod culture and so
2536900	2540860	forth, uh, stay tuned cause we'll want to dev definitely, uh, all those folks.
2540860	2543740	I just named, we want to get involved with that, uh, type of thing.
2543860	2547260	And, uh, you know, rule number one, just fucking be cool about it.
2550020	2550940	It's rule number one.
2551340	2551700	All right.
2551860	2552060	Yeah.
2552100	2556260	Sometimes the games go like the, one of the last games we played last night,
2556940	2558860	one person got seen venting.
2558860	2561620	So we knew exactly that person was going to get kicked off.
2562140	2565180	And then the other person was trying to vouch for them.
2565220	2568260	They're like, no, you can't, we literally saw the event.
2568300	2570660	So the game lasted like two minutes.
2571340	2572580	So what are you going to do?
2575100	2578660	And it happens, but the nice thing is you don't just play one round.
2578660	2580740	Do you play like 10 rounds in a night?
2580740	2584340	And so, you know, you'd, you'd, you'd be able to brush it off at some point.
2585180	2585420	Yep.
2585940	2587540	It's probably a great time.
2587820	2592340	Well, if you want to get in on the action with among us, um, let's, uh, we'll set
2592340	2596260	something up on our discord channels, uh, discord, so stay tuned, uh, over at
2596260	2601820	vognetwork.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord, uh, stay tuned and we'll try to
2601820	2605180	put something together for the coming weeks at some point here, I know with this
2605180	2607100	week being Halloween, there's probably a lot of stuff going on.
2607340	2611180	We'll try to get something Saturday.
2611220	2611580	Yeah.
2611580	2614740	But you know, people will be doing stuff throughout the week, uh, hopefully
2614740	2618620	virtually, but I do know there's a lot of outdoor type of art events and drive
2618620	2620180	through things and stuff going on.
2620180	2623860	So, you know, people are making the 2020 thing work, so, uh, we'll make it work.
2624180	2624500	Anyway.
2624700	2628300	Um, Shane, you've been holding that iPad above your head for so long now.
2628300	2629220	So thank you for doing that.
2629220	2630620	I know you're fatigued and have COVID.
2630620	2631220	I know you're sick.
2631620	2633380	Uh, please feel better.
2633380	2638260	And everybody in chat, as well as here in the, the, the chat here, uh, definitely
2638260	2640900	wish you feel better and do better and all that.
2640900	2644020	And the good news is you, you have been getting better as the days go on.
2644020	2644940	It's just slow, right?
2645620	2645940	Yeah.
2646100	2646420	Yeah.
2646420	2646660	Yeah.
2646660	2651620	I'm kind of feeling like I'm plateauing now, but it's not as bad as it was to
2651620	2652140	start.
2652260	2653780	And so I can't complain.
2654180	2654540	All right.
2654740	2657460	Um, anything else on any games or anything you want to share with us
2657660	2658780	tonight before we let you go?
2659780	2662500	As always, everybody needs to play the game of the year.
2662500	2663260	Hades.
2663780	2664780	It's the best.
2665220	2666260	I forgot to ask you about that.
2666780	2667860	I haven't started it yet.
2668580	2670140	Oh, it's so good.
2670220	2672540	It's just so good.
2672580	2675460	Quick, quick update on how Hades is going for you.
2675460	2677900	Somebody in chat asks, like, why hasn't Shane brought Hades up?
2677900	2680220	I forgot to get back to, we just had so much other stuff to talk about.
2680220	2681980	I would never not bring Hades up.
2681980	2682780	So it's okay.
2683100	2683620	Don't worry.
2684340	2688340	Um, I romance the character I wanted to.
2688580	2689660	That was awesome.
2689740	2693500	I've unlocked a few weapon aspects.
2693660	2700540	I still have not got the prologue, but to be fair, the past week I've not really
2700540	2706900	been playing, um, because of the fatigue, like holding a controller for a long
2706900	2708980	period of time, just kind of wears on me.
2709300	2713300	Like even Pokemon I've not like, even though I'm playing it a lot, it's easy
2713300	2717060	because I can set a command, put down the controller for a minute, then pick it back
2717100	2721580	up or even just rest the controller on my desk and do it.
2721620	2724620	But, um, no, Hades has gone great.
2725140	2728740	I'm technically almost done in quote marks, but that game is so good.
2728740	2729900	I won't ever be done.
2730260	2730700	All right.
2731460	2731780	All right.
2731820	2735020	Well, we're going to let you go and move on with the rest of our gaming weeks,
2735020	2736100	but, um, have a good one.
2736100	2736620	Feel better.
2736620	2739660	Check in and chat in the next week or two and let us know how you're doing.
2739660	2739980	Okay.
2740900	2741300	Okay.
2741380	2741660	All right.
2741660	2741980	Bye.
2742260	2742900	Kick me out.
2743900	2744060	All right.
2744980	2746020	Can someone click and dry?
2746020	2746900	I can't do it because I'm on my phone.
2746900	2748500	Can someone just drag him out of the channel somewhere else?
2748540	2748820	All right.
2749500	2749780	Bye.
2750060	2750660	Uh, all right.
2750700	2753740	Uh, so we're going to, uh, shift gears into the rest of our gaming
2753740	2755220	weeks here and get into that.
2755220	2757460	So, uh, dark soccer, why don't you start us off?
2757460	2758540	How was your gaming week?
2758540	2759580	What have you been playing this week?
2760220	2764100	I've only had time for animal crossing to be perfectly honest, just because of
2764100	2766820	project, uh, none way, which was a success.
2767140	2770420	We're still taking donations and the videos are going to be up at
2770420	2772020	capital city sisters.org.
2772340	2776980	So you can see me walk the runway looking really thrifty.
2777620	2783460	Um, but, uh, other than that, it's really just been time for animal crossing a
2783460	2787500	little bit, um, doing lots of video editing, lots of audio editing.
2788140	2792060	Um, and, uh, God was playing something else.
2792500	2796740	I am back to word scapes just to try to keep my brain active, but I do have
2796740	2801340	Hades and I am going to be playing it probably during the next week.
2801380	2804580	Cause I don't really have many projects right now.
2804620	2807380	Um, I'm taking November off of projects.
2807980	2813140	Um, and I'm actually plan well, other than, other than my, my blog at, uh,
2813180	2820420	Gen X geeks with an X, um, but I'm, uh, I'm going to be, uh, getting my streaming
2820460	2823740	going starting in November and I still want to do that charity stream.
2823740	2828540	So when I'm gaming, I'll let people know right now, real life has intruded.
2828900	2829420	All right.
2830260	2831420	Sounds good for now.
2831660	2833860	I hope the event is, continues to be a big success.
2833860	2836020	Cause you can like still do watch it online and stuff.
2836020	2836340	Right.
2836980	2842100	Um, well, uh, we had trouble with it because they decided to use Google
2842100	2846380	meet for it, um, uh, instead of a streaming service, cause I put a lot of
2846380	2850220	work into the video, the video is going to be up and if people want it, just
2850220	2851700	ask me about it, I'll try to get it to you.
2851860	2858020	Um, but, um, it should hopefully be up by, uh, in Monday evening, um, on
2858260	2860060	capital city sisters.org.
2860780	2864180	Um, but, uh, I, we actually did get something else.
2864180	2867900	I don't know if I mentioned it before, but we got the new Jersey Jack
2867900	2869380	pirates of the Caribbean pinball.
2869380	2871060	And so I actually did play some of that.
2871540	2873380	Very loud, very fun.
2873780	2875540	Lots of, lots of modes.
2875540	2879060	It's pretty nuts, but the Jersey Jack games are pretty, pretty tops.
2879620	2884820	Um, Hindemith 1980, or excuse me, 1895 in chat says in response to, uh, what you
2884980	2888420	were saying, dark soccer, no projects, November.
2890220	2894740	Well, I might do, um, novel writing month, but it's more or less just a
2894740	2900820	catalyst to actually get my ass in gear to put this world that I've built in on
2900820	2902020	to quote paper.
2902500	2906020	Um, I am working on an urban fantasy novel.
2906020	2907100	Well, not really a novel.
2907100	2908340	I'm going to do it as a serial.
2908820	2913300	And it's, uh, when I get everything out and get everything ready to go, it's
2913300	2918820	going to be available through, uh, the Apple bookstore and, uh, uh, for Kindle.
2918980	2923540	Soon as I get all my, my ducks in a row, there'll be more about that, but I'm
2923540	2924100	announcing it here.
2924100	2929740	Now I'm writing a book, a serial serial series, not not Remo or whatever they call
2929740	2934940	it, not no national novel writing month, but I'm, I'm only using that as a
2934940	2935540	catalyst.
2936380	2938340	Um, I'm not doing a full novel.
2938340	2940260	I'm doing them as, as, as serial series.
2940620	2946740	I've also heard of non no pod Mo, which is, uh, do a podcast every day for a month.
2946780	2949620	Um, I know I've heard of that.
2949620	2953740	I know I've thought about participating, but, um, that's a lot of podcasts and it
2953740	2954860	would have to be a separate feed.
2954860	2957340	Cause I like, it's not going to happen on a well or anything like that.
2957740	2960980	Um, but like, just like a personal thing, but I don't know if I would have put it
2960980	2961780	together that fast.
2961780	2962140	We'll see.
2963020	2968060	No, I, I don't think I could do anything like that with a lot of, you know, a lot
2968060	2969100	of crap.
2969100	2972460	And tiger call says that I'm going to be a superstar author and my books are going
2972460	2973660	to get turned into movies.
2974220	2978380	Um, you don't want to know the weird shit that goes in my head that I'm thinking
2978380	2979660	about putting into a book.
2980300	2988860	Um, but I, I, I will tell people that the, the apocalypse is not what you think it
2988860	2989220	is.
2989820	2992500	You can, we can be living through one right now.
2992580	2996060	The it's not, it's not at all what people think it is.
2996420	3002060	Post-apocalyptic is a genre for a different world.
3002500	3005820	You know, it don't, don't take that.
3006380	3008860	Why would I write a Garris Spock fanfic?
3008900	3011220	That's not a novel.
3011300	3013060	I do not write slash.
3013340	3013700	Okay.
3013980	3018860	I don't, um, I, I, I'm asexual.
3018860	3020140	I don't like writing that stuff.
3020300	3025900	Um, but anyway, um, but I'll have more about it as stuff comes out.
3025900	3027260	There'll be, there'll be things.
3027260	3030340	And of course I'll blog about it because I blog about every fucking thing now.
3031700	3032820	All right, fair enough.
3033220	3034220	Well, let's move on to Loki.
3034220	3035260	Loki, how was your gaming week?
3036300	3038060	Uh, well, let's see.
3038060	3044780	My gaming week was not playing games and it was just, uh, working on my game.
3045180	3047100	And that's pretty much what's going on.
3047100	3048180	I'm still not working.
3048220	3049340	It's still not working.
3049940	3051980	It's just frustrating me so much.
3052140	3057700	So I've been working on, um, a random spawning generator and I've run into
3057700	3065020	issues still in a fight for the last five days, so that that's been my week.
3065060	3072500	Um, I played Samorna as well, but, um, mostly just working on coding the entire
3072700	3077700	time, fair enough fighting, uh, it should be simple, but it's not working.
3078060	3081940	I look forward, um, to when we can finally play this game.
3081940	3082740	So I'm excited.
3082740	3082940	Yep.
3083180	3083660	All right.
3083780	3085660	Uh, good luck with all the bumps in the road.
3086060	3090940	Um, so my gaming week, um, has been kind of, you know, a same Z as previous weeks.
3090940	3091860	We already talked about, wow.
3091860	3094060	I already mentioned that Final Fantasy 14 still going.
3094300	3095260	This was the week.
3095260	3101020	So a couple nights ago, I finally hit level 80 max level level cap on every
3101020	3103220	single crafting and gathering class.
3103460	3107820	So there's like eight crafting classes, alchemy, carpentry, and so on.
3107820	3108420	Those types of things.
3108620	3111420	And then three gathering classes, fishing, botany, mining.
3111700	3113100	I hit 80 in all of them.
3113100	3115180	So, and what do I get for that?
3117180	3118020	I feel real good.
3119140	3119980	Ooh, I hope so.
3120100	3123380	Cause I actually like candy corn on your, on your doorstep.
3123420	3127140	Someone posted turkey dinner, candy corn, and I was, I was alarmed.
3127300	3130660	I don't know about that, but they, they do like the maple candy corn.
3130660	3132420	They have like other flavors this time of year.
3132740	3135580	I like, I like the candy everybody hates.
3135620	3138580	I like black jelly beans cause I like licorice.
3138900	3141580	I like, I like it.
3141580	3142340	I'm sorry.
3142340	3142980	Not sorry.
3142980	3146620	You and Dan can have all of that, but maybe I'll make candy
3146620	3148020	corn cookies again this year.
3148060	3152500	They're, they're kind of hard to do because the candy, uh, crystallizes,
3152500	3155500	you know, into sheet candy if it's exposed out of the dough.
3156180	3157580	So we'll see what happens.
3158140	3160740	You know, the other thing, I know you're going to hate this Jamie plug your ears.
3160740	3163700	I'm sorry, but the other big, big candy that I love that everybody
3163700	3166580	hates, circus peanuts, love them.
3167580	3168260	They're great.
3168260	3169980	You, you can have them.
3170020	3170420	Okay.
3170420	3170660	Yeah.
3170700	3173620	Just don't eat them in front of me because I will vomit.
3174260	3176700	I would honestly have those than like a Hershey's bar.
3176700	3177060	Really?
3177060	3178060	I, anyway.
3178100	3178460	All right.
3178900	3180220	That's so there you go.
3180220	3181020	Happy Halloween.
3181020	3182940	I will get you peeps and that's all you get.
3184460	3184860	All right.
3185180	3186420	Uh, let's see.
3186460	3190340	Um, so also for my gaming week, uh, I've been playing.
3190380	3191820	So there was a couple new things.
3192100	3196220	Um, I played that demo, so I guess I'm going to talk about this.
3196220	3198260	I don't think I actually put this item in our news, but I'll
3198260	3199340	talk about it a little early.
3199620	3203140	So Google Stadia had a big thing, and I know that's coming up later in the
3203140	3206740	news, uh, an event where they were talking about some new things that are coming.
3206940	3210780	And one of the things they talked about was a Pac-Man style battle
3210780	3214540	Royale game that's coming out first on Stadia and there's a demo.
3214540	3218340	You can actually play online right now and you can check it out.
3218340	3219940	And so I was like, eh, why not?
3219940	3220820	I'm going to go check it out.
3220820	3224740	So I played it a little bit and it seems to be a pretty feature filled
3224740	3228580	demo, meaning you can pretty much play a match start to finish.
3228740	3232060	I don't know what, I'm assuming the full game will have more
3232060	3233700	customizations and other things you do.
3233900	3235660	And I know the demo is also time limited.
3235660	3237620	Like you can do it until October 27th.
3237820	3242460	So I feel like, cause I don't always love to talk about demos as a review,
3242460	3246260	but I do feel like this demo is intentionally set up to be pretty full featured.
3246660	3250260	Um, it's not good.
3251660	3252300	It's not fun.
3252620	3256100	Um, it's, it's Pac-Man.
3256140	3258940	Um, it's, it's here's, here's the problem with it.
3259100	3260540	Like Pac-Man is a good game.
3260700	3261420	That's fine.
3261700	3265860	But look at how Pac-Man's really evolved over the years.
3265900	3266300	Right.
3266540	3269740	And the last few releases in the Pac-Man universe have been things like
3269940	3274580	Pac-Man championship, Pac-Man championship edition, uh, Pac-Man championship
3274620	3277540	edition two, those games are pretty fun.
3277580	3278820	Uh, the music's great.
3278980	3280340	They're pretty fast paced.
3280500	3281500	It's intense.
3281620	3282620	They're fun to play.
3282900	3286580	Um, this Pac-Man tunnel battle royale thing, whatever it's called.
3286580	3287500	I don't even remember the name of it.
3287780	3289420	It's you, you here's the thing.
3289460	3292540	I'm not even sure I understand what the fuck's going on, which
3292540	3293780	is one problem I have with it.
3294220	3297500	Um, but basically you're playing Pac-Man.
3298140	3300340	Um, it's cartoony.
3300340	3301020	It's cute.
3301020	3302620	You can customize a lot.
3302620	3303740	I guess that's a plus.
3304340	3310300	Um, but the whole catch is you can open up the gates and instead of doing a
3310300	3314660	tunnel to the other side of your map, you do a tunnel into someone else's map.
3315700	3317380	I don't know why.
3317420	3322100	I mean, you, you, I guess technically can eat a power pellet and try to kill them.
3322460	3327140	Um, you can also take points and, and ghosts and stuff away from them.
3327460	3331420	Um, but it's just, it's not interesting at all.
3331860	3333660	It's just, it's not.
3333940	3338980	Um, they tried to put some more power ups in the game to, uh, mix it up a little bit,
3338980	3342620	like something that will make ghosts repel from you and do you see it?
3343180	3346660	It's re it's a step backwards for Pac-Man.
3347060	3350340	And I'm going to tell you what I've come on this show and talked about.
3350660	3352260	I like Pac-Man championship edition.
3352300	3357100	I liked Pac-Man chip addition to a lot more than most reviewers did.
3357180	3361420	As much as the random ghost train on rail thing kind of bugged me too.
3361820	3366660	I, I felt the style and substance and the way it kind of changed the game and, and the,
3366660	3369260	the, the kind of the, just the joy I get out of playing it.
3369380	3372620	I kind of felt balanced out some of those things here.
3373060	3378060	It was just not interesting at all.
3379580	3380860	I don't know what else to say.
3381300	3387060	Like, um, let's see, I'm looking in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
3387260	3391220	And, uh, Bobby is talking about if you take just the technology of the streaming 4k
3391220	3394580	with low latency and that wifi controller, Stadia is amazing and wonderful.
3394580	3397460	The problem is the service that is Stadia negates all the great tech.
3397660	3403580	I got to admit it played all right, but it didn't, it didn't play as well as when I
3403580	3405380	was playing like destiny two and stuff.
3405580	3410860	It, I, I was getting more, more artifacting on fucking Pac-Man than I was when I was
3410860	3411820	playing like destiny.
3411980	3415540	Maybe that's just the nature of my connection today or what have you.
3415540	3419100	I don't know if Alan was streaming something at the same time or what, but it
3419100	3420660	just, wow.
3421140	3425740	Uh, Questbuster says, I spectated a few games of that on Stadia and it was more
3425740	3426340	Pac-Man.
3426740	3428700	I didn't really feel compelled to play it though.
3428860	3430100	Exactly.
3430540	3434020	Here's, here's, here's the thing, and here's why I'm so negative on it.
3436060	3442020	Is that obviously when we heard about this, we saw, Oh, it's Pac-Man, but it's a
3442020	3443020	battle royale.
3445620	3446340	That's it.
3447580	3448700	That's what they did.
3449100	3456340	I got nothing like it's, it's, it's, it's the most basic ass fucking game.
3456460	3459660	If pumpkin spice were a video game, it would be this.
3460540	3462460	That is how basic it is.
3462580	3464220	But you like pumpkin spice.
3464300	3464740	That's right.
3464740	3471700	I like, I usually will defend pumpkin spice, but I can't, it's just, it's really
3471700	3472940	bad you guys.
3473620	3474740	And this is a demo.
3474900	3477980	This is what they're trying to put out to save Stadia.
3479100	3482740	Should we start playing Taps already?
3483100	3484660	Uh, wait till the next segment.
3484980	3490940	Um, but, uh, yeah, so that was, that was the Pac-Man game.
3490940	3491460	I'm sorry.
3491460	3494340	I, I really want to love the game cause I loved Pac-Man.
3494340	3496060	I just don't, it's not good.
3496540	3497700	Um, okay.
3497740	3501260	Uh, so let's see what else, uh, did I play this week?
3501260	3504980	I felt like there was one other game, but I'm so, so bent on that out of shape on
3504980	3505420	that game.
3505420	3506580	I can't even remember what it was.
3506700	3507980	I did play a little more Hades.
3508020	3509100	Oh, I know the game.
3509740	3515460	Um, I went into the Super Nintendo emulator on, uh, the official one on the
3515460	3519460	Switch, Nintendo online, and I started playing Mario's P-Cross.
3520100	3524300	Because P-Cross is very Zen and relaxing and kind of fun.
3524660	3526660	Um, and I, I enjoy it.
3526660	3532580	So, uh, I played, I played all of round one on the Mario side, a plot twist,
3532740	3533860	minor spoiler alert.
3534100	3535260	So I did all of that.
3535380	3537460	So, uh, and that was more fun than Pac-Man.
3537940	3540620	All right, let's get into some news.
3540620	3542780	I don't think I have anything else to discuss.
3543140	3544580	Uh, that's about it.
3544860	3549060	So let's get into, uh, what else is going on in the gaming world in the news.
3549060	3551140	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
3551820	3555220	Yes, let's, let's talk about some more stadia stuff.
3555260	3562620	So, um, there was an interesting tweet exchanges, uh, going on with the creative
3562620	3569260	director at Typhoon studios, Alex Hutchinson, who has, um, of course their
3569260	3575500	studio was bought by Google's, um, by Google last year and is actually making
3575500	3576380	stadia games.
3576940	3581540	He, um, brought the wonderful hot take that, you know, what talking about, you
3581540	3585420	know, all these DMCA things that are going on with, uh, the music and stuff on
3585420	3585900	Twitch.
3586340	3590820	Um, he also brought up the thing saying, Hey, streamers worried about getting
3591060	3595340	their content pulled because they use music and didn't pay for, uh, should be
3595340	3598740	more worried by the fact that they're streaming games that didn't pay for as
3598740	3599180	well.
3599380	3600180	It's all gone.
3600180	3603820	As soon as the publisher decides to enforce it, the real truth is streamers
3603820	3607460	should be paying the developers and publishers of the games they stream.
3607460	3612260	They should be buying a license like any real business and pay for the content
3612260	3612780	they use.
3613700	3617820	Well, of course that was received very well by everybody and no one had any
3617820	3618500	issues with it.
3618500	3624540	Of course, um, everybody had issues with it and, uh, there's a lot of
3624580	3625780	interesting feedback.
3625940	3632180	This is also the same guy that, uh, was complaining a while back about how he
3632180	3637700	felt that Japanese games get kind of a pass by media outlets when they're,
3637740	3641580	um, reviewing them versus, um, American games.
3641580	3645540	Cause he was the creative director at, on Assassin's Creed three at one time.
3646100	3646820	As well.
3646860	3651900	Um, you know, comparing his games to, you know, basically like, um, super
3651900	3653260	Mario brothers or stuff like that.
3653260	3655380	He's all, why did they get to make games in the same thing?
3655460	3657660	And people just kind of love those.
3658220	3663740	It must be because there's some sort of, uh, subtle racism in the business
3663980	3665180	on the journalist side.
3666940	3668540	So yeah, he's full of hot takes.
3668580	3670780	Uh, of course, no, nobody liked it.
3670940	3675340	Um, no, no, but you sound like a telltale game.
3675340	3676300	It just popped up in the corner.
3676420	3677540	Nobody liked that.
3678620	3678860	Yeah.
3678860	3682140	So Google, of course, you know, basically saying, Hey, uh, the recent
3682140	3685380	tweets by Alex Hutchinson, creative director at Montreal studio of
3685380	3686820	stadia games entertainment.
3686980	3690180	Do not reflect those of stadia YouTube or Google.
3691540	3694620	Yeah, but you know why he's, he's representing a company.
3694660	3698980	He's one of your, and he kind of missed, I don't want, I don't know if
3698980	3700780	you'd say he misrepresented himself.
3700820	3705180	I kind of think that's a accurate way to say it, but, um,
3705460	3705900	let's see.
3705900	3711580	So it says, uh, creative director at S S G and E Montreal studio is what
3711580	3715180	it says now, but that's not what it said before it said creative
3715180	3718700	director at, uh, Google stadia.
3719980	3721020	Is what it said before.
3722140	3722540	Yeah.
3722580	3725220	So, so he changed it there.
3725260	3725660	Yeah.
3725700	3731020	I mean, so the kind of pick it apart, obviously it's a weird take from
3731100	3735980	somebody that's making stadia games on a device that literally one of the
3735980	3740900	features that, Hey, you can stream your games on YouTube straight out of,
3741420	3743460	straight up using the service.
3743780	3746420	It's like, what are you doing?
3746900	3752380	I mean, as it is, it's hard enough to sell stadia as like a device that
3752380	3756700	people want to use because of their service and just the way it's structured.
3756700	3758620	It's not very good.
3758700	3759020	Yeah.
3759060	3762500	And now you have somebody that's like, you know, you should be
3762500	3764300	paying us because we're so good.
3764340	3765100	I'm sorry.
3765420	3767580	No, no, that's not it.
3767820	3772180	I understand the argument, but it's also, you know, it's a bad take.
3772180	3777700	It's just like, there's a lot of companies right now, especially with
3777700	3782140	like, you know, the new X-Box and the new PlayStation systems coming out
3782140	3787180	that they're engaging with streamers to get the hype out about, you know,
3787220	3788660	those systems they're paying them.
3788660	3792740	And, you know, obviously there's this kind of synergy between, you know,
3792740	3798100	content creators and these hardware platforms or even software platforms
3798100	3799580	to be able to promote their stuff.
3800380	3802340	And I'm sorry that he doesn't get that.
3802620	3808100	Um, yeah, even, even your cat, Stella has a hot take on what this guy had to say.
3808100	3809540	She's just being irritating.
3810180	3811460	It's more, more treats.
3811460	3814900	She's been receiving treats all day long and she knows I'm on a call.
3815580	3817140	Obviously now's the time.
3818260	3818660	Yeah.
3818660	3822500	And I, I agree with Bobby in chat, who's basically saying he'll be fine.
3822500	3824620	People will forget his comments soon and he'll still be
3824620	3825780	working in the game industry.
3825780	3826740	I agree.
3826740	3828220	Like people it's going to blow over.
3828220	3828540	It is.
3828820	3832660	But I, this is one of those things where I, I don't think it's so much about
3832660	3834940	what he said, but it's how you say it.
3835300	3840620	And I think he just came off as like, so smug and so, and I, I would like to
3840620	3845980	compliment myself because I felt my drags in response on Twitter were really good.
3846140	3847540	I'd like to share them with you now.
3847860	3853300	So in response, I wrote, people can't stream Google Stadia effectively because
3853300	3857340	they need that bandwidth to play the games and how's that lack of community
3857340	3859300	for your product working out in sales.
3860060	3861060	I thought that was a good drag.
3861420	3864500	Now here's, yeah, there is like some digs that he made against like
3864500	3866140	giant bomb and stuff like that.
3866140	3868380	And it's like, you know, here's the thing.
3868420	3870620	And I'm going to elaborate on this tweet too.
3870940	3875100	While I agree, and this is my tweet, while I agree something like a jukebox
3875100	3879780	license should exist for streamers and I'd be open to some sort of revenue
3879780	3884540	share with developers, these industries are too slow to come up with something
3884740	3889260	just like Google Stadia was too slow to release outside Chromecast before X cloud
3889260	3893740	and Luna, you work in tech for Christ's sake, evolve or die.
3894020	3896380	And that is basically what it is for me.
3896660	3904540	And I, I actually don't necessarily disagree that the clock is ticking in of
3904540	3910420	sorts for when are some video game companies going to start to say, maybe
3910420	3912100	we don't want you streaming our game.
3912300	3915380	And to be fair, that has already happened to some extent on YouTube, right?
3915380	3919500	We've heard about companies leveraging that DMC 80 at certain videos taken down.
3919660	3923540	Nintendo didn't have a great take on this in the beginning either.
3924020	3926300	So yeah, they took that approach.
3926300	3927260	Nintendo took that approach.
3927260	3931020	They thought that they, you were playing their games, you should pay
3931020	3933380	them for the right to do that online.
3933420	3935260	And that's the approach that they took.
3935580	3938780	And, and they did that and obviously they backed away from it.
3938780	3943900	So it wasn't working out well for them, I would assume because it's either it.
3944500	3949220	It shines poorly on them, like that they're not embracing their community
3949220	3951980	or that the money wasn't worth it.
3952220	3956780	I don't know, wherever the case may be, they backed away from it for a reason.
3956940	3962900	So just, you know, let's just say, for example, that this Stadia studio or
3962900	3966900	whatever wants to take that approach, which is really stupid on their
3966900	3969700	device that you has that built in.
3969900	3972140	So let's just say they're stupid enough to do that.
3973620	3976180	There are tons of other companies out there that will
3976180	3977500	let you play their games for free.
3978180	3982460	I'm pretty sure that the developers behind Among Us probably don't care.
3982620	3984740	So if, if you have these companies, that's fine.
3984740	3988740	You know, these AAA studios can go ahead and take that stance and do that, but
3988740	3992740	there's always going to be independent developers or even AAA studios that
3992740	3999660	don't share that same opinion and I'm sorry, but eventually, you know, you'll
3999660	4004980	find that your games get less exposure because you're just, you put up roadblocks.
4005020	4010100	I, I actually, I actually kind of agree with you for the most part on this.
4010100	4014540	I think it's one of those, if, and that's why I'm kind of like, it would be nice if
4014580	4019380	they would come up with something, a fair system so that if a developer wants,
4019420	4021220	they can get a cut of profits.
4021220	4025180	Now, I believe before you all start dragging me, I believe
4025180	4027220	it should be at a threshold.
4027300	4031620	I don't think somebody who's making, you know, the bare minimum to be an affiliate
4031620	4036740	on Twitch and bringing in simple dollars and cents every month on Twitch should be
4036740	4039980	somebody that should be subject to those type of guidelines, but I think once you
4039980	4043940	hit a certain threshold and you're at these, you know, I'm making a living off
4043940	4048740	of it type of things, I think there maybe is room for a conversation about what
4048740	4052940	should a developer be entitled to in those cases, but, and this is where I
4052940	4057380	agree with Loki, I think a developer should have the right to say, we're not,
4057420	4059660	we don't, we want you to be able to stream this for free.
4059660	4062420	We're not interested in claiming that we want to encourage you to
4062420	4064860	stream our game by doing that.
4064860	4069300	And I think if you do that, then I think the rest of what Loki says absolutely
4069300	4072940	comes true is that the streaming market starts to gravitate towards those games
4072940	4077820	and the market kind of work, it's works itself out, but I do think we need to
4077820	4082580	have a little more definitive guidance in a legal sense so that this isn't
4082580	4084300	such a gray area anymore.
4084700	4090500	I, I, because, because unfortunately, even though the way he said it was kind
4090500	4094340	of crappy where he's, you know, especially as somebody who works in the game
4094340	4096980	industry, he did have a point.
4098140	4103100	If these guys, if the game makers want to come in and start shutting things
4103100	4108420	down, they could, and I'll tell you, and with all that stuff, I just try.
4108660	4110380	Yeah, like seriously, like just let him try.
4110380	4115060	Well, Nintendo did, Nintendo did, and they, maybe not on Twitch, but they did
4115060	4117980	on YouTube, but I also think, so everything I just said, Loki, cause
4117980	4119140	here's the thing it's funny.
4119140	4121660	Nintendo is always the rule breaker.
4121660	4123300	And I think this would be no different.
4123540	4126580	I think if rules were to be set, I think Nintendo would be like, oh yeah,
4126620	4127940	we're claiming max share.
4128180	4131900	And I really think Nintendo fans, like, I'm sorry, but Nintendo fans wouldn't
4131900	4134700	care because Nintendo fans are willing to die on their sword for Nintendo.
4135780	4140220	I just feel like that again, it would be an anomaly, but at least
4140380	4141460	we'd have an answer.
4141500	4144700	And at least we wouldn't be sitting here saying it's a gray area.
4144820	4146340	It would no longer be a gray area.
4146580	4151060	But the problem is, sorry, Loki, the problem is, but, but I'm, it's a
4151060	4154140	callback because go back to what we were just talking about at the top of the
4154140	4158700	show with AOC and her live stream, no matter how you feel about AOC.
4158700	4160220	And I think, Loki, it was you that said.
4160580	4165220	It felt a lot better than just an old, a bunch of old people standing
4165220	4166620	around talking about politics.
4166620	4167820	That's not very interesting.
4168580	4169660	And I think that's it.
4169700	4170580	That's the disconnect.
4170580	4174900	We need people like AOC and fight, let's say Justin Amash too,
4174900	4175860	because he's on the right.
4175860	4176180	Fine.
4176340	4177460	Let them come together.
4177540	4183580	We need these younger folks that get it to come together and talk about trademark
4183580	4189820	laws and rule and, and, um, uh, copyright and modernizing these types of things
4189980	4192580	for what makes sense in the year 2020.
4192620	4195820	The whole DMCA needs to be rewritten and whole copyright law
4195820	4197300	needs to be rewritten anyways.
4197540	4198980	It's just well outdated.
4198980	4201700	It's been driven by Disney too.
4202140	4206980	It's just, I just say it's been, um, what's the right word here?
4207060	4214260	Uh, exploited, exploited by Disney, um, to an nth degree.
4214260	4215580	I mean, it's ridiculous.
4215620	4221300	And so there needs to, it needs to be modernized and, you know, put in place
4221300	4226420	to where fair use is actually something that is considered because I know it is
4226420	4229740	written in that they have to consider fair use, but they don't because there's
4229740	4232500	no, there's no sort of punishment.
4232500	4238220	If a big company, like say, you know, Warner music doesn't, uh, follow fair
4238220	4240100	use because what are you going to do?
4240100	4243100	You little person, you know, individual person that has no money, you're
4243100	4244700	going to fight a huge corporation.
4244860	4249060	Yeah, there's no sorts of, you know, repercussion for them.
4249060	4250940	So the laws need to be rewritten.
4250980	4251340	Loki.
4251340	4253820	I do want to jump in because the, the live fact checking
4253820	4255060	that happens in our chat room.
4255060	4258300	This is worth saying, uh, like what company has done it.
4258300	4261140	And actually a couple of people act deft and Bobby both chiming in.
4261500	4263420	Atlas did it with persona.
4263420	4266820	If you went too far into persona, they DMC aid people.
4267260	4271420	It's it's only one example that we can really think of in recent memory, but it
4271420	4275100	has happened, so there is proof that companies will use it if they feel like
4275100	4279060	they need to, so, I don't know.
4279460	4283140	Uh, dark Sakura, what do you, what do you, what do you think the rules should be?
4283140	4285620	Or do you think where's your head out with all this?
4285620	4287780	Do you think game companies should be entitled to some money?
4287980	4289780	Do you think it's too far gone?
4289940	4291300	Do we need to have a conversation?
4291300	4292260	What's, what's your opinion?
4293620	4298860	I think if anything, that the places that offer the streaming service need
4298860	4304660	to have some sort of licensing deal with some of these companies, I
4304660	4310420	think on behalf of the users, I mean, users are getting a kick in for, you
4310420	4317380	know, like sort of direct payments, but, um, there's also the subscriber
4317380	4320260	fees and everything, the more subscribers, you know, if anything,
4320260	4323820	maybe bump up a subscription by a dollar, have that go into paying
4323820	4327980	licensing charges and keep it off of the people who are providing the content.
4328780	4331300	Or how about let's not pay these companies any more money because
4331300	4334180	they're already making tons of money from all the microtransactions and
4334180	4336860	stuff that they're throwing in and pretending these multi-billion dollar
4336860	4338940	companies, not all of them.
4339180	4342340	There are other companies that would benefit from having a deal like that.
4342700	4346780	I understand that, but the ones that are complaining about it, Google, or I
4346780	4351060	should say this developer of Google, it's owned by Google, whatever, I'm
4351060	4354420	going to lump them in, you know, complaining multi-billion dollar
4354420	4357980	companies that are complaining that they are not receiving enough money for
4357980	4361500	their games, that's why they're charging $70 for their brand new games with
4361500	4366380	season, multiple season passes and DLC on top of that and special editions
4366380	4371820	on top of that and cosmetics on top of all of that, I mean, like, I
4371820	4375580	can't feel bad for you when you're giving your CEO several hundred
4375580	4379980	millions of dollars it's, or tens of millions of dollars, you know, as a
4379980	4382580	bonus, sorry, don't feel bad for you.
4382580	4386260	So no, I don't think you need to make more money, especially, you
4386260	4387580	know, gatekeeping this stuff.
4387780	4390500	And if you really want to do that, I'm sorry, but there's plenty of
4390500	4395460	other companies out there that won't necessarily go that route and they
4395460	4399260	could go very well the same way as Twitch, where Twitch has like kind of
4399260	4403340	this white listed music selection that you can choose from, then you can
4403340	4405780	have a white listed game selection you can choose from.
4405780	4406340	Well, let's go back to the music scene.
4406340	4412860	I was still making a point before, saying that I still stand by what I
4412860	4418700	said, it's a way to get the big companies off of people's back and it's
4418700	4423220	a way to offer freedom for the streamers that want to do, I mean, the
4423260	4425780	big companies are going to do what they can to be richer and richer.
4425820	4426820	That's all there is to it.
4427460	4429860	My point is living in the real world.
4430700	4435220	We should have a way that they get, you know, their little, what, two
4435220	4439980	cents on every game that's, uh, that's played on a stream and stay
4440020	4444100	off of the players backs, realistically.
4444260	4447580	That's kind of where I, and I think there is an intersection here where
4447580	4450100	you guys actually really do agree because it's where I'm at too.
4450100	4452660	And that is, we've got to get out of this gray area.
4452820	4454820	That is that, that, and that is what it is.
4454940	4458980	We may not ultimately like the result, but it, and what you're saying, Jamie,
4459020	4462180	it's going to get us out of the gray area and that's the most important thing.
4462180	4463740	And I totally agree with that.
4463980	4468500	Now, well, like with, with music streaming services, for example, right.
4468620	4474820	All these companies, they do pay licensing fees to, you know, whatever
4474820	4478100	the production company, et cetera, you know, who owns the rights to
4478100	4479540	the music, whatever publisher.
4480180	4483220	It's going to be this, I think it's going to be the same thing.
4483300	4487500	You know, you have that one licensing charge that they have with major,
4487500	4490620	with major companies, you know, maybe have a coalition though, for the
4490620	4494220	smaller, for the independent ones have like some sort of deal with them.
4494220	4499700	That then say, well, I want to step in and get a little bit off, you know,
4499700	4503660	for my games that they signed into this, you know, agreement or
4503700	4505100	whatever they can afford to do.
4505620	4509060	But, you know, it's like active, just said in chat, the companies only
4509060	4513100	care about money, so give them something to shut them the fuck
4513100	4514420	up and let us have our games.
4514620	4517700	Well, and it's, it's funny you bring that up as a solution because I, I
4517700	4520900	really think now going back to the music side of things, I think the
4520900	4525620	music industry, of course, as always is being slow to evolve and ridiculous
4525660	4531100	and really short-sighted and losing potential money by not, and not even
4531100	4536420	the cool kind of petty like Lori petty, but they are like being really
4536460	4541500	ridiculous in not offering something similar to a jukebox license.
4541660	4546260	So that streamers can just have music in the backgrounds of their streams
4546260	4547580	and not have to worry about it.
4547580	4551380	Something similar to what, you know, like a small business or, you know,
4551420	4555020	like a small streamer license, you know, and it, maybe it's not going to be
4555020	4558060	the type of money that everybody's going to want to pay, but at least
4558060	4560900	again, you'd have something to get you out of that gray area anyway.
4561140	4565380	Well, in a perfect world, these, these companies would actually be
4565380	4570220	held accountable for paying their taxes, saying the, you know, people
4570220	4574820	who make stupid amounts of money over 400,000, you know, a year, they would
4574820	4575580	get taxed.
4576380	4580540	So I'm just saying, you know, this goes into a bigger picture.
4580540	4581940	We may be looking at it.
4581940	4585660	This, this being one symptom of a problem, but we've got a bigger picture
4585660	4586780	that will be solved by voting.
4586820	4587420	Just saying.
4588220	4591460	Um, Loki, I'm going to do something a little weird here and go out of order
4591460	4595540	because it just makes no sense to not pair this with your next story.
4595540	4598020	Can we hop ahead to the other story about Twitch?
4598020	4598340	I'm sorry.
4598340	4600100	It just makes sense to couple this here.
4600540	4601500	Just so unprepared.
4601860	4603980	We're having this discussion already.
4604020	4605180	We got to bring this up.
4605540	4611140	So bringing up the RIA, of course, there was this huge, massive, uh, DMCA
4611140	4613260	purge and it's by Twitch.
4614140	4617740	The issue is it's kind of a compound issue.
4617740	4623580	So one, apparently Twitch was receiving, I think these DMCA take down
4623580	4627740	notices for a while now they've been backing up since the summer.
4628060	4633300	And now they just sent out information to streamers, letting them know that
4633820	4639340	one of your pieces of content has, you know, a piece of music or whatever,
4639340	4642140	and it that's been hit by this and you need to delete it.
4642300	4645300	And if you don't know which one it is, well, just delete all of them.
4645740	4647300	Cause they're not going to tell you which one it is.
4647300	4651140	Which people are doing, which is ridiculous and stupid.
4651180	4653940	Like just incredibly stupid.
4653940	4656140	You have apparently, yeah, these claims have gone back since the
4656140	4660860	beginning of back in June, um, that they were happening and they finally
4660860	4665580	got around in, which I mean, clearly they're not following, you know,
4665580	4667300	Twitch is not following the law here.
4667340	4671980	Um, could make them lose their safe harbor status being that they've waited
4671980	4674500	so long to respond to these claims.
4675020	4678700	Um, but yeah, it's just, it's a problem because they're going to have, people
4678700	4681420	are having to mass delete these videos.
4681900	4687620	Um, all their VODs and everything are going to be gone because they don't know
4687780	4692820	which clip it is that they're claiming, which I also think is not necessarily
4693180	4700300	following the rule of the law for DMC on this stuff, so I don't know.
4700300	4705020	Um, I haven't gotten a strike, so I'm aware.
4705060	4708260	Just for the record, VOG network did not receive one of these and I didn't
4708260	4712140	get one on my personal channel either, but I, I've generally been pretty
4712140	4714140	aware about this type of thing.
4714140	4717180	And I've kind of, you know, I just kind of know like, okay, if I play
4717180	4721340	something like Forza Horizon, I'm going to play on the classical music station.
4721340	4723620	That's not going to get, you know, struck a strike.
4723860	4727700	I don't do the whole like Spotify, iTunes, whatever, playing
4727700	4728780	potpourri in the background.
4728780	4729540	I don't really do that.
4729860	4731500	Um, it's usually always the music in the game.
4731900	4736100	Um, and, uh, unfortunately, and I'm, I'm kind of with, uh, what, uh, see
4736100	4737420	Black and Pat had a comment earlier.
4737420	4738100	I was going to read, Oh yeah.
4738380	4740860	I've been looking forward to playing harmonics, new game fuser
4740860	4741940	when it comes out next month.
4741940	4742300	Me too.
4742580	4745580	Uh, but I know I won't be able to play it on stream because I'll be
4745580	4747540	DMCA'd within an inch of our life.
4747580	4750100	Yeah, totally, uh, where I'm at as well.
4750500	4751820	Um, so yeah.
4751820	4754860	And Bobby says technically they could still strike the classical music
4754860	4758060	station because it's the recording that's copywritten and the classical
4758300	4760820	music station does have music written in the 20th century.
4760820	4764180	So, um, fair point, but it's, it's, it's jet.
4764180	4765500	I've generally, I've been okay.
4765500	4768180	I found, I did not get hit with one of these knock on wood.
4768460	4769700	Um, but I would do that.
4769740	4773220	I who's going to watch my Forza horizon four stream from like three years ago.
4773220	4775340	Like I would do the same thing other people are doing.
4775540	4777740	And if I started getting these notices, I'd probably just delete
4777740	4781820	everything, um, which sucks, but yeah.
4783860	4787420	So, um, orange rice says I didn't get the email either.
4787460	4789020	Uh, and, uh, interesting.
4789020	4791300	I wanted to read this from a quest buster.
4791300	4793740	Cause I thought this was very interesting that I wasn't even aware of this.
4794180	4799460	As a side note, Facebook gaming already has licensing details with the likes
4799460	4804420	of universal Sony and BMG to allow their streamers to play music during their
4804420	4809380	streams, at least those that have partner status still at something that's better
4809380	4811740	than nothing, even though it's Facebook.
4812100	4814540	Um, yeah, that's, uh, very well said.
4814540	4818060	Um, so, but it also does show that the platform, i.e.
4818060	4822580	Twitch could negotiate something at that level if they wanted to, but Twitch seems
4822580	4826380	to be a little more on this whole, which isn't necessarily bad, like I'm not
4826380	4830900	critical of this, but is on this more, we're doing this Twitch safe label with
4830940	4835220	indie stuff and because that's what they want to push and we all know that that
4835220	4836460	type of thing is going to be cheaper.
4836460	4840460	But, uh, who am I to complain about them wanting to push indie music?
4840460	4841900	I don't think that's such a bad thing.
4841900	4848860	Um, this is interesting, but, uh, yeah, it, the fact that you can't counterclaim
4848860	4853500	some of these things and that you're not really told a lot of the reasons, that's
4853500	4858460	the part that's kind of dicey and bad, that's following that a lot of these
4858460	4861020	violations and that falls on Twitch, that falls on Twitch.
4861580	4862060	Yeah.
4862060	4866660	Well, not having the counterclaim process, I think it goes against DMCA as well.
4866660	4871940	Um, I think a lot of what they've done could get themselves into a lot of
4871940	4876740	trouble with these music labels because they didn't follow the letter of the law.
4876740	4883300	I mean, in ignoring it for four months, not that, I mean, they could easily
4883300	4884860	be taking the court for that stuff.
4886100	4892180	I think this is just trying to save face right now, but like, yeah, I don't know.
4893140	4898100	It's not, that's, I can't imagine that they didn't know this was a problem.
4898100	4901060	Um, Questbuster in chat says a number of big streamers have already said they've
4901060	4904100	decided to just wipe out thousands of VODs to be safe.
4904100	4910820	And to be, to be fair, VODs aren't exactly where it's at on Twitch.
4910820	4917620	Like Twitch has not done a very good job of competing with YouTube on the VOD level.
4917620	4921460	And I know it's ironic cause I talk about the VODs here of the show and so forth.
4921460	4926500	Yes, they are available, but they're not really that well utilized.
4927060	4930980	Like there's a couple of people that will watch the VODs of this show and I see you.
4930980	4931220	Hi.
4931220	4932020	Thanks for being there.
4932020	4937300	I appreciate it, but it's not nearly the number that watch live or that watch on
4937300	4938580	the podcast feed.
4938580	4942260	And I think for anything else, my personal channel, there might be one or two people
4942260	4943780	that were where it's completely open.
4943780	4945300	I don't have subs or anything.
4945300	4949460	Um, I might have one or two people that watch a VOD, but I have way more that
4949460	4950580	watch it live.
4950580	4955780	Like Twitch's area that they, they are do well in is live.
4955780	4960020	So maybe in a way that's what makes it easy, quote unquote, for a lot of streamers to
4960020	4964420	throw things away is because it's like, eh, VOD isn't really where it's at anyway.
4964420	4969700	It's all about getting those subscriptions and bits and so forth in a live environment.
4969700	4971460	Cause that isn't coming in on the VODs.
4972740	4976420	So, uh, Bobby in chat says even the clips aren't safe.
4976420	4980020	And if there's something we do on our shows, that's extremely heavy on the video.
4980020	4981460	We post it to YouTube.
4981460	4982100	Yeah.
4982100	4987540	So, uh, and Phoenix 77 26 says this will lead to DMCA abuse.
4987540	4990180	I sadly, I see that coming too.
4990180	4994020	So there needs to be a way to kind of respond.
4994020	4998260	It took YouTube forever to get there, but at least they have something in place now.
4998260	5000500	So it's, um, yeah, the whole thing's a little bit scary.
5000500	5001220	But not much.
5001220	5005460	I mean, it, there's nothing that really sought people from making false DMCA claims.
5005460	5006740	So Ray.
5007540	5007860	Yeah.
5007860	5008740	Very, very for that.
5009540	5009860	All right.
5009860	5010820	Well, let's move on.
5010820	5014660	Uh, I'm going to talk about the next story here, which has to do with, this is pretty
5014660	5019540	exciting and something I really wish Nintendo would have embraced this stuff a lot sooner,
5019540	5020420	but fine.
5020420	5021300	We're here.
5021300	5022100	Yay.
5022100	5028660	The original NES fire emblem game is going to get a localization and come to the U S
5028660	5030260	for the very first time.
5030260	5037060	Sort of, there was a remake that happened on DS 3DS, but this is, this is the true original
5037060	5039620	NES rom from 1990.
5039620	5043380	That's coming out, which is a fire emblem, shadow dragon, and the blade of light.
5044180	5051300	Interesting enough, this game is already part of the switch online program in Japan.
5051860	5057860	So if you open up the Famicom library in Japan and which you can do, uh, even with an American
5057860	5061700	account, all you need is just a Japanese account temporarily to go to the eShop and download
5061700	5062900	the Famicom player.
5062900	5065140	But once you do that, you're not breaking any laws doing it.
5065300	5066900	The switch is a region free system.
5067780	5074180	You can go in and play this game already with your switch online in Japanese, but they're
5074180	5079300	going to be localizing it for the U S and because of that, it's not just going into
5079300	5082740	the switch online library, which I think is going to make a lot of people frown.
5083540	5088180	But they are going to sell it separately as a $6 game or $5.99.
5089300	5094420	It's another limited time release, meaning you will only be able to get it through March
5094420	5103060	31st, 2021, which is a whole other, I don't understand this, outside of they are trying
5103060	5108980	to inflate their, um, because notice that March 31st is no coincidence.
5108980	5110900	That's the end of the fiscal year.
5110900	5114900	They're trying to sandbag as much as they can to sell in the physicals.
5114900	5118820	They don't really have a gigantic holiday release to buoy them.
5118820	5120900	Mario 3D All-Stars is it.
5120980	5125140	And then otherwise they're relying on third parties, like, um, probably the Hyrule Warriors
5125140	5128260	2 is kind of like the other big holiday release, which really isn't their game.
5128900	5130500	But it is their IP, obviously.
5131060	5133300	Anyway, that's a whole other discussion.
5133300	5140100	But what is pretty cool is that, um, there's going to be a $50 physical version of this
5140100	5147780	with an NES style box, replica game cartridge, 200 page art book, and a download code.
5147780	5149940	Because obviously you can't just put a cartridge in your switch.
5149940	5153620	Well, I guess you can, but they're not going to bother just putting this tiny, like an
5153620	5159220	NES cartridge or like, it's an NES style box and replica game cartridge.
5159220	5161460	So you can't actually put it there rep.
5161460	5163780	So you can't actually put it in a Nintendo.
5165060	5166500	It's a rep it's for looks only.
5167060	5168500	So, okay.
5168500	5169220	Yeah.
5169220	5174340	But anyway, uh, that is, and then it's a translated game manual that you get in a fold out world
5174340	5179780	map now for collectors, especially people that really love their eight bit NES libraries.
5179940	5184740	That part is pretty cool because that isn't even like something, oh, limited run games
5184740	5188020	who does these types of Nintendo's doing it.
5188020	5189220	So that's neat.
5189220	5190580	I'm going to give them credit for that.
5191300	5194660	But I just, I hate the whole limited time release thing for one.
5194660	5201620	Um, I actually, I'm not as hateful on the $6 surcharge as others might be.
5201620	5206020	I get that localization isn't free and they're going to need to pay people to do that and
5206020	5206420	so forth.
5206420	5213140	So I'm not, I still think there would have been value for Nintendo to put that into switch
5213140	5218820	online because that library is really slowing down and it's not as amazing as it used to
5218820	5219140	be.
5219140	5222900	But I just sat here and talked at the top of the show about playing Mario P cross.
5222900	5224180	So maybe I'm wrong.
5224900	5227940	Um, I don't know what low key dark soccer.
5227940	5228580	What do you guys think?
5230260	5231940	I'm not a fan of fire emblem.
5231940	5239700	So yeah, I'm probably gonna get it just to have it for reasons.
5239700	5241380	Dan likes fire emblem, so we'll see.
5242180	5245860	I'm also just not as big on fire emblem as a series, but I'm really happy for those people
5245860	5248900	that are like, I'm not, I'm not a hater either, but yeah, I'm definitely one of those people
5248900	5252420	that's like, so if this does well, does this mean mother three?
5252420	5255940	That's I'm definitely never going to get you what you want.
5256180	5263380	No, for the record, Rob and release, I have the translated, uh, uh, cartridge for mother
5263380	5264420	three if you will.
5264420	5268100	Yeah, they're, they're out there, but I would love to see Nintendo embrace it.
5268100	5270260	You know, that's, that's the, that's the thing.
5270260	5270900	I'm just joking.
5270900	5272660	I've never played any of the earthbound series.
5272660	5275460	So, you know, Oh, you should, do I care about mother three?
5275460	5279460	Um, Bobby black over chat says, uh, I think the surcharges for the added features, they're
5279460	5282820	adding more in game options, like rewinding a turn.
5282820	5285140	So it's not just the straight ROM.
5285140	5291300	Um, you could like the, the online emulator, you can do a rewind.
5291300	5294980	I'm not sure it's this, like, even in the Japanese Famicom, you can do like a real one.
5294980	5297380	I'm not sure it's implemented the same way.
5297380	5298660	So I'll give you that.
5298660	5303700	But, um, yeah, I mean, I, I, again, I'm actually not upset about the $6 surcharge.
5303700	5304260	Like I get it.
5304260	5308820	There's things that go into it, but I also think Nintendo could have weighed, would there
5308820	5314020	have been value in just putting it in the library anyway and not doing a surcharge,
5314020	5316580	but that was their decision to make, I think.
5316580	5319060	So, um, interesting.
5319780	5323140	And Bobby says it's literally in the in-game menus.
5323140	5326180	So it's like a actual feature in the game.
5326180	5332260	Now that makes me wonder how far along was this game localized already?
5332980	5336820	Cause you know, with those hacks and things that happened, I get it.
5336820	5341940	It's a shady, shady slippery slope, but we know that there are things that Nintendo started
5342020	5344660	to localize that they pulled back on for whatever reason.
5344660	5346420	These things happen in the gaming industry all the time.
5346980	5353460	And Nintendo themselves embraced it years ago with the Earthbound Zero release on Wii U.
5353460	5354180	Remember that?
5354180	5355540	That was also pretty cool.
5355540	5358420	And I don't know why the fuck that's not on Switch still, but okay.
5358420	5364020	Um, so Nintendo was not exactly a stranger to putting these things out.
5364020	5366500	So I'm, it's just interesting.
5366500	5367300	That's all.
5367300	5369060	So anyway.
5369620	5370260	All right.
5370260	5372900	Let's move on because this is also about the Switch, Dark Sakura.
5374980	5380660	Well, um, some good news since, uh, you know, a lot of us have been dealing with Joy-Con
5380660	5387940	Drift, which I still need to call to get mine taken care of, um, is that Nintendo is dropping
5387940	5395700	the price of a single Joy-Con controller from, uh, where it was before for $49.99 and is
5395700	5397460	now $39.99.
5397460	5404420	So it's only a $10 drop, but it is something, um, it's going to be available starting on
5404420	5405300	November 9th.
5405940	5412740	Um, and they are also, um, specifically discounting two, uh, uh, specific models.
5412740	5416900	So it's the right Joy-Con red and the left Joy-Con blue.
5417460	5423220	Um, so it's the, you know, the same ones that were included in the, the default, uh, with
5423220	5425380	one of the original releases of the Switch.
5425380	5427620	Um, and they are still offering free repairs.
5427620	5430980	So I need to look into, you know, that as well.
5431620	5437620	Um, there is a, not a price change for the full set of controllers.
5437620	5442740	However, it looks like Amazon might be having a sale for $69.99 instead of $79.99.
5443300	5444500	So there is that.
5445140	5446900	So there you go.
5447700	5448580	It is what it is.
5448580	5454580	Um, as SSG100Matt in chat, uh, over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, so the prices are
5454580	5455380	drifting down.
5456820	5458340	That is not funny.
5460500	5461940	You of the dad jokes.
5461940	5464580	No, sorry.
5464580	5466900	Did Drew go out to visit SSG100Matt?
5466900	5468020	Like what's happening here?
5468020	5468340	All right.
5470500	5471220	Okay.
5471220	5474180	So anyway, all right.
5474180	5478740	So, uh, I'm here for prices coming down, especially on really expensive Nintendo hardware.
5478740	5479700	Uh, so cool.
5480340	5480900	All right.
5480900	5482740	Let's move on to some PlayStation news.
5483140	5488260	So let's talk about Travis Scott, um, who's been a lot of places lately.
5488260	5494020	And so I'm surprised and I'm not surprised to see that he is teaming up now with PlayStation.
5494020	5497460	So this is Travis Scott and his brand, which is Cactus Jack.
5497460	5501860	If you didn't know that already, uh, who's also already worked with things like Tesla,
5501860	5503380	Fortnite, McDonald's.
5503380	5508260	Like I said, like he's, Travis Scott is not just a musician, but very much a businessman.
5508260	5509860	He's, he's in a lot of places.
5509940	5511380	So it was announced this week.
5511380	5518260	Um, it went in a interesting PlayStation, uh, video, uh, that was, uh, owed to the Maxwell
5518260	5520980	high fidelity tape and sound thing.
5520980	5522660	You, you know, this you've seen this before.
5522660	5527300	It's the guy sitting in the chair and then the TV turns on and whoosh, like the sound
5527300	5528180	and all that, everybody.
5528180	5529620	It's like an infamous commercial.
5529620	5535220	And this was kind of a homage to that commercial, but of course it was Travis Scott.
5535220	5541700	And it also kind of puts together that, Oh, is this why Travis Scott posted a dual sense
5541700	5544180	five controller on his Instagram last month?
5544180	5546020	Like, how did you get that?
5547780	5552340	So, uh, and it's because he is going to be working with PlayStation.
5552340	5558340	Now I'm not sure exactly how they don't really say like, he's, I guess like a creative mind.
5558340	5563300	Um, but in a post on the PlayStation blog, which apparently he authored, um, it said,
5564180	5568260	I'm really looking forward to being able to showcase everything that cactus Jack has worked
5568260	5570740	on with Sony and the PlayStation team.
5570740	5575140	Most importantly, I'm excited to see how the PlayStation fans and family respond.
5575140	5578900	And I look forward to running some games with everybody very soon.
5578900	5585140	So we don't exactly know what that entails, but like, I could see that, you know, we know
5585140	5590980	that a year after this PlayStation is out, there's going to be a re maybe not like a
5590980	5593300	full redesign, but like a recoloring of it.
5593300	5593780	Right.
5593780	5595860	Or a re like a pattern version of it.
5595860	5595940	Right.
5595940	5599700	Cause that's, that's what happens all the time with like, like Xbox, but now it's a gray
5599700	5602740	Xbox or a see-through Xbox or a PlayStation.
5602740	5604900	It's a, it's a blue PlayStation or any of this stuff.
5604900	5607220	So I'm sure this is just a matter of time before something like that.
5607220	5612180	And so maybe there'll be like a Travis Scott designed or a cactus Jack kind of PlayStation.
5612180	5617460	Like, I don't know any thoughts from you guys on, on what this team up could involve for Travis.
5617460	5620980	Okay.
5620980	5621460	Maybe not.
5622260	5622900	It's all right.
5622900	5623700	Loki, you're muted.
5623700	5626180	That's, that's why I'm like, pause, awkward pause.
5626180	5628420	I don't know what he would be necessarily doing.
5628420	5630580	It's just usually marketing stuff.
5630580	5637540	I know he does a lot of merchandise online, but I don't know.
5637540	5644180	Hopefully it's better than that mortal combat re arcade one up cabinet that we had for Supreme.
5644180	5646580	I don't think it'll be better than that.
5646580	5647540	I don't think I'll do that.
5647540	5648420	Jamie, you had a thought.
5649860	5651860	I'm more with Loki on this one.
5651860	5655380	I think it's just, I don't really think it's very big.
5656260	5660340	Well, it's, you know, but he, it's interesting, you know, cause I know he's, he's most known
5660340	5665780	as a musician, but again, the business side of things like that McDonald's deal is a lot
5665780	5667940	bigger than I think most people realize.
5667940	5671940	And like, like, like, cause you know, he had his own meal, like he was actually on the
5671940	5674660	menu, he'd get the Travis Scott meal and it was all in a commercial.
5674660	5675780	He was narrating everything.
5675780	5679620	And the whole catch was, I think the burger was customized and the French fries came with
5679620	5683540	barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, because that's how he does it.
5683540	5689860	And McDonald's were running out of barbecue sauce because of that.
5689860	5694500	So, I mean, his name and his endorsement obviously carries weight.
5694500	5699860	Or I I've always said long before Travis Scott, that barbecue sauce is the way to go with
5699860	5701620	fries, but that I digress.
5702260	5703380	I disagree.
5704500	5705220	That's fine.
5705220	5707140	Some people do ranch, some do ketchup, some do nothing.
5707140	5712260	Because mayonnaise is delicious and ketchup is the devil.
5712260	5714740	Oh no, that's the Nickelback meal.
5714740	5715060	Bleh.
5716020	5716980	I'm just kidding.
5716980	5717220	All right.
5719940	5724660	Uh, yeah, I'm not a mayo person, but I know that's what they do in other countries.
5724660	5725380	Yes, you're right.
5725380	5729060	Of course you go over to like Europe and other places mayo or mayo.
5729060	5730020	No, bleh.
5730020	5730420	What?
5730420	5732660	Rob, do you like the In-N-Out sauce?
5733860	5735060	No, it's mayonnaise based.
5735940	5736260	Okay.
5738020	5739300	It was worth asking.
5739300	5740660	No, I don't like it at all.
5742260	5743300	No, and Thousand Island.
5743300	5743940	No, no, no.
5743940	5744580	Aioli.
5744580	5745460	No, no, no.
5745460	5746740	I know all the tricks.
5746740	5747620	No mayo allowed.
5747620	5748660	That's what Pixel Baka says.
5748660	5749300	No, I can't.
5749300	5752900	Despite my love of the other weird thing, that is my weird thing.
5752900	5754900	I hate mayonnaise.
5754900	5755380	Hate it.
5755380	5757540	But you know what I also don't like?
5757540	5759220	Our McDonald's hamburgers.
5759220	5761620	So I've never had a Travis Scott meal.
5762500	5763140	You know what?
5763140	5769860	I think the last McDonald's hamburger I ever thought that I really liked was the Arch Deluxe.
5770980	5771940	Oh, okay.
5771940	5772340	Okay.
5772340	5773140	Remember the Arch Deluxe?
5773140	5773620	Yeah, I do.
5773620	5773860	I do.
5774660	5779140	Because my vegetables were not wilty pieces of shit by the time I got my burger.
5780340	5781220	Bring it back.
5781220	5783860	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I love dipping fries in mayo.
5783860	5785540	I also don't do that in front of Rob.
5785540	5786740	You have permission to dip.
5786740	5787460	I don't care.
5787460	5788420	You can eat mayo.
5788420	5790260	Just don't do that stupid thing.
5790260	5792500	And I know you won't, Bobby, because this isn't your personality.
5792500	5794340	But people in my past have done this.
5794340	5797620	They dip it in the mayonnaise and go, oh, you want it?
5797620	5798500	You want it?
5798500	5798900	Eat it.
5798900	5803620	Well, if you do that to you, I just I'm like that, though, about ketchup.
5803620	5803860	Yeah.
5803860	5808580	If you have to dip their fries in anything, then they haven't made their fries well enough
5808580	5811540	because their fries should be just good enough as it is.
5811540	5818100	The problem is, see, so the way I used to describe fast food fries with a lot of the
5818100	5823780	stuff McDonald's, their their consistency, it varies a lot.
5823780	5827540	It's just whether they could be really garbage or they can be really great.
5828100	5829620	If they're fresh, they're great.
5829620	5833060	But there's other like not even necessarily fresh.
5833060	5835380	They have to have them cook the right amount of time, seasoned right.
5835380	5835880	All that stuff.
5836660	5841300	But like there's other fast food chains that their fries are more consistent, but they're
5841300	5845140	never going to be as good as the best in and out fries.
5846260	5846740	I'm sorry.
5846740	5850740	Now that we have a Shake Shack here locally, nothing Shake Shack fries are great.
5850740	5852500	Nothing can touch those fries.
5852500	5854420	Done by Rob.
5855860	5857220	Five guys has better fries.
5857940	5859940	I didn't it's the peanut oil.
5859940	5861060	I didn't like the bag of grease.
5862580	5863220	All right.
5863220	5867540	However, however, I have found an ultimate fry replacement.
5867540	5873780	Even my delicious sweet potato fries have been bested by the habits.
5874740	5875780	Tempo green beans.
5877860	5879060	Really good.
5879060	5881140	Some of you on the East Coast will get a kick out of this.
5881140	5886100	We just got a Shake Shack here locally, like right when the pandemic started, I think is
5886100	5887860	when they finally opened, unfortunately.
5888820	5890660	So, yeah, now that's here.
5890660	5892180	And yeah, their fries are bomb.
5892180	5896420	And the closest thing to it is Del Taco fries is the only other place I've seen do the crinkly
5896420	5896900	fries.
5896900	5902420	But Del Taco fries, like as good as they are, they have a tendency to make them soggy, dry.
5903060	5906580	The one with my health makes them very dry and flavorless.
5907300	5911780	And for the record, SSA 100 Matt, yes, if you're going to have in and out fries, you
5911780	5914020	have to have them animal style because it's pretty amazing.
5914020	5914520	Nope.
5916100	5919940	You know, though, they're the fries that I loved as a kid, though, were from Checkers
5919940	5921620	or Rallies or whatever the fuck the companies.
5921620	5922180	Oh, yeah.
5922180	5922820	Oh, yeah.
5922820	5926020	With the with the kind of spicy little bits to it.
5926020	5928660	And Whataburger does not have the best fries.
5928660	5929700	I'm sorry.
5929700	5931460	Crystal's has crappy fries.
5931460	5932100	I'm sorry.
5932820	5939940	Um, because again, that's where I grew up, you know, just saying, um, I'm trying to think
5939940	5943780	that we're had really good fries that Oh, you know, I miss Steak and Shake.
5944660	5946580	Oh, not yet.
5946580	5947700	It's in Reno.
5947700	5948340	It's in Reno.
5948340	5949460	It's getting close.
5949460	5952740	Yeah, but we can't really compare curly fries because that's a whole different thing.
5952740	5954260	I mean, that's kind of its own thing.
5954260	5957300	Okay, I just gonna say, though, it's interesting because in chat, they're talking about like,
5957300	5957940	wow, I didn't know.
5959380	5961380	Shake Shack finally branched out there.
5961620	5966740	We're all of a sudden getting these things that like the rest of the nation has had.
5966740	5972500	Like, we just got our first Cracker Barrel, which I kind of think is overrated.
5972500	5974020	But people are into it.
5974020	5974260	Cool.
5974260	5974500	Fine.
5974500	5977220	But it's the only place I can get good fried catfish.
5977220	5977720	Fair enough.
5978180	5981220	Uh, that just happened within the past two years.
5981220	5983620	We just know we need Waffle House, Bobby.
5983620	5985300	We need fucking Waffle House.
5985300	5987380	California will never have a Waffle House.
5987380	5988180	That's already been.
5988180	5988980	I know why.
5988980	5990740	Yeah, because the wage thing.
5990740	5992020	Our minimum wage is higher.
5992020	5992900	Exactly.
5992900	5996420	We have some decent knockoffs, though, because since we don't have Waffle House.
5996420	5997620	Can we get a White Castle?
5998740	6002900	No, we do not have a decent Waffle House.
6002900	6003940	Knock off the end.
6004500	6005140	We do not.
6005780	6006340	I don't know.
6006340	6008260	I think there's an okay place.
6008260	6009540	No, we do not.
6010260	6015380	As someone who has grown up and has eaten at Waffle House, I've eaten at the child.
6015380	6018500	No, no, you've eaten at Waffle House a couple of times.
6018500	6020260	I have eaten at a Waffle House weekly.
6020340	6021700	I'm allowed to have opinions.
6023140	6025060	I'm allowed to have opinions.
6025060	6027300	You're allowed to have an opinion, but in this case, it's wrong.
6027860	6031540	Waffle House does not have a West Coast equivalent.
6032340	6033220	End of story.
6033220	6033380	Yeah.
6033380	6036180	Carlos, your fries are good, but you need to have ketchup for those.
6036180	6040420	But those are actually, so they read as in their fries and they're all right.
6040420	6041540	But they're not as ever.
6041540	6042180	They're not going to ever be as good as me.
6042180	6045140	So our next story is about voting.
6045140	6047620	Wait, one more fries, and then we can go to voting.
6047620	6051220	Sia Tabiri in chat says the worst are the new KFC fries.
6051220	6052820	I totally disagree.
6052820	6054980	I think those KFC fries are so freaking good.
6054980	6059940	I can't make my brain know what KFC fries are like, so I can't comment on that one.
6059940	6062660	All right, but you can use your voice to vote.
6064100	6067940	So I will say that I agree with Black Compat.
6068580	6070820	Waffle House does have the best grits.
6070820	6072420	And my mother, bless her.
6074100	6077060	I was gonna say, you cannot get those here, even at the knockoff places.
6077060	6086340	So I will concede that Rob, you can get them at my house because you stole a bag or your
6086340	6087620	mom got you a bag or something.
6087620	6089460	No, it's not because I stole them.
6089460	6094740	If you ask behind the counter, they will sell you a bag of their quick rice grits for 99
6094740	6095060	cents.
6095060	6097860	And my mother freaking sent me two bags of them.
6097860	6099060	And I love them.
6099060	6102500	And I will have really good butter in them.
6102500	6106100	Or I will, if I'm feeling extra trife, I'll make shrimp and grits.
6106340	6110020	Isn't it amazing that we get this passionate about French fries?
6110020	6111620	But when it comes to, are y'all voting?
6113380	6118020	Okay, so now that we've gotten everyone's passions all built up.
6118820	6120820	Use that voice.
6120820	6122020	We gotta eat now.
6122020	6124740	And this is something I am ridiculously passionate about.
6124740	6128020	I have been participating in SPN votes.
6128020	6131140	I've been working with vote.org.
6131140	6135220	I've been trying to spread the word on my social media as much as I can.
6136100	6142180	So I'm super happy to hear that more in the gaming industry is stepping up and offering
6142180	6144420	up now a voting location.
6144420	6150660	You know, we've got states like what the fuck were they thinking Texas with, you know, only
6150660	6154260	allowing like one voting location per district or something like that.
6154260	6159860	The lines I'm seeing on like from our listener is from our listeners.
6159860	6161940	And I'm seeing on their Twitters and things.
6161940	6163140	It blows my mind.
6164100	6164900	Do you have this?
6165620	6165860	Sorry.
6165860	6167140	I just say sorry listeners.
6167140	6171620	You know that we just got mailed ballots, filled them out and dropped them off at the
6171620	6175620	library at the grocery store where the or mail them in any type of.
6175620	6179060	Now there was that whole scandal about the official drop box versus the not official
6179060	6179300	ones.
6179300	6180180	We won't go there.
6180180	6182820	But it is completely unrepentant.
6182820	6187780	If you look in the with your ballot, it tells you where you can drop them off.
6187780	6190660	So I was like, okay, the library nearby.
6190660	6192740	Okay, that's where I'm going to go because that is an official one.
6193380	6195060	So that's what I did online.
6195060	6196420	And my mind's already been accepted.
6196420	6200180	So anyway, so the lines are blowing my mind anyway.
6200180	6200580	Go ahead.
6200580	6201140	Yeah, they are.
6201140	6205620	And by the way, I actually do have to give some kudos to a couple of rather famous people
6205620	6211220	that I follow on social media who stood in line on purpose in solidarity.
6211220	6211460	Good.
6211460	6221780	So but anyway, 100 Thieves has turned their home office in Los Angeles into a voting center.
6223540	6229860	They, they basically were saying that their 100 Thieves cash app compound, which is a
6229860	6235700	15,000 square foot building, opened earlier in the year is now serving as an LA County
6235700	6236980	voting center.
6236980	6243460	And it's open for early voters starting on October 30, through November 2, and on election
6243460	6244660	date November 3.
6245220	6251140	And they also partnered with a graffiti artist goes by slick to have a mural on the on the
6251140	6252660	building that says vote.
6253460	6259220	It's kind of in Mickey Mouse hands, you know, but then it's going to change to we voted
6259220	6265380	on November 2, they are going to follow all this safety guidelines, voters will have to
6265380	6274260	be masked and gloved and social distancing for those in the area is 6050 Jefferson Boulevard,
6274260	6275060	Los Angeles.
6276500	6280580	And so I really think that it's great, you know, they, they're known for their professional
6280580	6282660	teams for League of Legends, Fortnite, Valorant.
6284180	6290100	You know, I think that this is really good that they are using their, their location
6290100	6295620	and their voices to encourage others to vote because we do have a lot of damage that needs
6295620	6296900	to be corrected.
6296900	6299300	And it's awesome that they're doing that.
6299300	6300420	It is awesome that they're doing it.
6300420	6301460	I don't want to lessen it.
6301460	6307940	My gut reaction, though, is like, dang, it's too bad that they're not in New York or Georgia
6307940	6312580	or one of these places that I'm seeing the crazy lines because California, again, we
6312580	6316740	all it's every county now, it does what this county has been doing for years with the mail
6316740	6317460	in thing.
6317460	6321380	And so technically, I mean, technically, they don't really need it.
6321380	6322820	But it's nice to have options.
6322820	6325060	And anything that'll get more people to vote is a good thing.
6325060	6326340	I don't want to lessen that.
6326340	6331300	But that was I was like, dang, too bad it wasn't in Georgia or, you know, New York,
6331300	6337140	or why I think it's good they are doing this because they are setting a example.
6337140	6338260	OK, I'll give you that.
6338260	6339300	Yeah, yeah.
6339300	6346820	If they can do this, why can't other places there's you know, we have companies all over,
6346820	6352100	you know, the nation, not necessarily, you know, centralized in California.
6352100	6355940	And on top of that, you know, there are other major tech businesses that could stand to
6355940	6356980	do the same thing.
6356980	6360180	You know, you know, call center campuses.
6360180	6363860	I think that they should be allowed to set up for the same thing for some of our major
6363860	6364360	companies.
6365240	6369800	I we were blessed, we were very fortunate that we could do a mail in drop off.
6369800	6370300	Yeah.
6370300	6377160	But a lot of and I'm just going to go out and say it a lot of red states are are actively
6377160	6381560	working on their voter suppression because they know that that it can switch.
6381560	6384360	They could at least, you know, hang out in the purple region for a little while.
6385720	6391640	But they know that the tide is changing, that people's opinions are changing and have really
6391640	6392760	restricted voters.
6393400	6399960	So I think that we need more companies stepping up and adding this kind of of availability
6399960	6400460	for people.
6401080	6405480	Now, Bobby Black Wolf does want to correct because he's I kept kept bringing up Georgia
6405480	6406840	because I was seeing videos from there.
6406840	6410040	But Bobby does say, Hi, Georgia resident lines are better now.
6410040	6413640	The reason you saw the long lines on day one was because it was Columbus or Indigenous
6413640	6414520	People's Day.
6414520	6416200	So people had the day off.
6416200	6418360	The lines are about 30 to 45 minutes now.
6418360	6422040	See what's interesting, though, like, I got to be honest, I got to be completely honest.
6422040	6426040	Even when I hear 30 to 45 minutes, I'm like, oh, that stinks.
6426040	6431160	Like, I just filled mine out at home while I was watching Twitch and then just ran it
6431160	6431800	by the library.
6431800	6432200	That's it.
6432200	6433240	That's all I did.
6433240	6436200	So I, you know, I'm not trying to be like, yay me, boo you.
6436200	6440760	But I got to admit, like, I'm like, why can't every state just do it this way?
6440760	6441800	More people would vote.
6441800	6444760	But yeah, Jamie is right on.
6444760	6450360	It's unfortunately some people are afraid that if it goes that way, then the elections
6450360	6451240	will turn out differently.
6451240	6453160	And that's that's unfortunate.
6453160	6459880	Well, and I think the big thing with Texas, too, is that there was and now I with the
6459880	6467320	caveat, do not rely on the polls for your decision because we saw it happen in 2016.
6467320	6469800	But they are seeing that.
6469800	6475240	Well, and Hot Pockrey, by the way, Austin is like mini California.
6475240	6480600	I'm just saying, you know, Austin is this little blue pocket in the middle of a sea
6480600	6481080	of red.
6481720	6486440	And so, you know, which honestly, if there was anywhere in the south that I would move
6486440	6488680	back to, it would be Austin in a heartbeat.
6488680	6489560	I would live in Austin.
6490920	6492680	I would never move back to Mobile.
6492680	6493160	I'm just saying.
6493960	6499720	But back to what I was saying, you know, is that they know that the state is already starting
6499720	6501800	to shift to blue overall.
6502360	6503240	And they're afraid.
6503240	6509960	They're afraid that the you know, that their way it's like that with any kind of way of
6509960	6517560	life, we even see it in, you know, in evolution, you know, that the whatever the newer species
6517560	6521080	is, the newer way of thought is always going to be attacked on by the older.
6521640	6524760	And so, you know, this is more important than ever.
6524760	6530040	I'm glad that we're seeing more turnout than ever before.
6530040	6532760	Texas's turnout was pretty insane already.
6532760	6540200	I've been watching the numbers on on some of the the polls I've been watching for the state
6540200	6541800	just because I have friends that live there.
6541800	6543480	And so I think it's amazing.
6543480	6547320	But yeah, we need more companies doing this and we need them to be allowed to do this.
6548280	6550280	Why our vote is even more important.
6550280	6554520	And I got to say, and one message, you know, as despite I'm sitting here going, I just
6554520	6556600	was able to drop off my ballot at the library.
6556600	6561480	I really salute those of you out there that are waiting in line.
6561480	6565640	And please, that's why I was been harping on last week's show and the week before and
6565640	6567800	before that make a voting plan.
6567800	6570920	That's why I say that, because, you know, when I say plant, you might have to plan to
6570920	6574680	wait two and a half hours to vote somewhere, whatever it is, even longer, depending on
6574680	6575480	where you're at.
6575480	6579800	So I just I really salute those of you that are getting in line to do it.
6579800	6584600	And I just I'm tipping my hat to you like, Jamie, do you know of any like since I am
6584600	6589640	in California and I'm spoiled with the mail in thing, can I like buy those people coffee
6589640	6590200	somehow?
6590200	6594040	Like, is there an organization that like, yeah, is that legal?
6594040	6599320	I don't know if it's legal, but I would think that if there's no harm and like, can I somehow
6599320	6600360	cheer those people on?
6601640	6604120	Yeah, there are companies that are doing it anyway.
6604920	6613960	However, it's illegal to do food giveaways in some places, but there are there's like
6613960	6614280	snack.
6614840	6615480	What's it called?
6615480	6618360	I think snack the vote pizza to the polls.
6619720	6626520	OK, there there's there there are places like that, but also look for some of the suggestions
6626520	6627160	coming from.
6627160	6631880	And it's a group that I'm involved with very recently is random acts dot org.
6631880	6633800	It's our random acts of kindness.
6635960	6643960	And they've they they're a nonprofit that's dedicated to doing kindness in the world,
6643960	6645800	just making the world a better place.
6646280	6651960	And I know people on there have been working on gathering together, working with some of
6651960	6657320	the food banks, working with, you know, some of the covid support.
6657320	6661800	And I think that there's some people with random acts who might have been trying to
6661800	6663560	band together to do some things in their name.
6665560	6671080	But on top of that, anyway, I just say, you know, if you see people in line, you know,
6671640	6677080	bring bring bring out a bunch of, you know, protein bars, bring water with you.
6677080	6679800	You know, if someone says, hey, you can't do that, go away.
6679800	6684280	Well, you've even if you've given out five bottles of water to somebody, you've done
6684280	6687560	a kindness and you've helped encourage them.
6687560	6688060	Yeah.
6688760	6689560	All right.
6689560	6691880	Anyway, let's let's move on.
6691880	6692840	But please vote.
6694440	6695240	That's the message.
6695880	6696680	All right.
6696680	6698280	Let's talk about this next story.
6698280	6699560	And I think, Loki, we're back to you.
6701640	6702200	All right.
6702200	6703320	Oh, yeah.
6703320	6703800	Yeah, we are.
6703800	6704840	Sorry, I'm backwards.
6705800	6706440	OK, cool.
6707240	6711720	Anyways, let's talk a little bit about more streaming stuff.
6711720	6717640	So, you know, we talked a little bit about how Google Stadia has had support for some
6717640	6723000	of their streaming six, but not all of them, unfortunately.
6723000	6727240	But what's kind of fun is seeing what may be coming for Xbox games pass.
6727240	6733240	So, for example, one of the things that's being teased is that there may be a bundle
6733240	6742360	with a TV streaming stick to be able to stream game pass via like a basically like an HDMI
6742360	6747240	device that you would plug into your TV, you know, similar to Amazon Fire or Chromecast
6749560	6751160	using X cloud.
6751160	6753320	So it's interesting.
6753320	6757240	That might be something that's coming as far as the Xbox ecosystem.
6757240	6762360	But, you know, what they're talking about is kind of similar to, you know, like Stadia
6762360	6767080	where, you know, you'd have a controller, you know, the games pass subscription and
6767960	6768920	the stick itself.
6769560	6772840	So I'd be interested in seeing that.
6772840	6776280	I think that'd be really cool, especially if it seems to be that they're focusing a
6776280	6777640	lot on X cloud.
6777640	6781560	And that would be a big way to get people into that ecosystem.
6781560	6782840	Yeah, for sure.
6782840	6788520	So and it's also interesting because it competes a little more directly with Google
6788520	6790520	Stadia, perhaps on that level.
6791240	6791740	Yeah.
6792040	6795960	So, yeah, Phil Spencer basically say, I think you're going to see lower price hardware
6795960	6800360	as part of our ecosystem when you think about streaming sticks and other things that somebody
6800360	6803800	might want to just go and plug into their TV and go play X cloud.
6805160	6808280	So, yeah, that'd be pretty cool to see something like that in the future.
6808280	6809240	They'd be able to do that.
6809240	6814600	And I would imagine that's probably, you know, very feasible considering Android devices
6814600	6815640	are able to support this.
6815640	6820840	So if they can put a stick together that can handle something like that, I think it's
6820840	6823800	feasible within the next probably year or so we'll see that.
6823800	6824300	Yeah.
6824840	6825340	All right.
6825400	6830120	And then, oh, yeah, I was going to say one last thing, though, of course, to go along
6830120	6836920	with that, I was going to say the iPhone streaming stuff as well.
6837560	6844680	There's, of course, you may remember this whole thing with the App Store and wanting
6844680	6852120	like separate, like practically separate programs for each one of the games that you would stream.
6852120	6859640	So now they've, I think, worked out a way to actually use basically, yeah, so using
6859640	6862840	the App Store, you can stream as well.
6862840	6867160	I want to say through, it's kind of a convoluted way through the Xbox app.
6867160	6870840	So you sign in with that with your Microsoft account and you click on the library and do
6870840	6872520	all that stuff instead of a console.
6875240	6877960	It's interesting to see they're going to have like a workaround for that to be able
6877960	6884680	to use it on the iPhone, but still not probably the best way to do that.
6887720	6888220	Yeah.
6888280	6892360	And I think I heard one of them got taken offline as well.
6892440	6895480	Like there was some type of like backdoor app or something, and they ended up taking
6895480	6896200	that offline.
6896200	6899880	So just wait, wait for, wait for all those companies to work it out.
6899880	6904120	If nothing else, it sounds like, you know, if they're not able to get an official app
6904120	6908760	or something, it sounds like Microsoft may go the way that Luna's going and do like an
6908760	6910120	integrated web app type of thing.
6910120	6911960	Just they got to get the technology working first.
6911960	6916360	So it's only a matter of time before, you know, it comes to iPhone one way or another.
6917000	6917400	Yeah.
6917400	6923720	So with the workarounds right now in place, you know, you can try that, but I think if
6923720	6927560	they're going to, yeah, go through like the web browser or something like that, then that
6927560	6929480	would be probably the best way to do it.
6929480	6933960	Unless they can get, you know, Apple to agree to allow them to put it on the store in its
6933960	6934600	current state.
6935640	6936440	All right.
6936440	6941720	Well, let's move on and talk a little bit about a game that we never shut up about,
6941720	6943880	even though it never came out.
6943880	6947960	It was just a demo of a game that came out, God, years and years ago.
6947960	6952440	What was it like five years ago, at least five years ago at this point, more than that.
6953240	6958120	It's a little game called P.T., which of course was the playable teaser for what would
6958840	6964360	eventually or supposed to be a Silent Hills game that of course didn't end up happening
6964360	6967640	due to Hideo Kojima leaving Konami and so on and so on.
6968680	6973480	So with all the games that, and I think this came up last week, we were talking about that
6973480	6978920	there's only 10 games that are not going to be backwards compatible on PlayStation 5,
6978920	6979880	according to Sony.
6980440	6985880	So this leaves people asking, oh, does this mean P.T. is backwards compatible?
6986440	6995400	So a news outlet out there, GamesRadar, contacted Konami and actually asked, can we play P.T.
6995400	6997080	on the PlayStation 5?
6997080	7002440	And the answer they got was, P.T. will not be available on the PlayStation store, so
7002440	7006360	users won't be able to redownload the content through the backwards compatibility feature
7006360	7007640	to the PlayStation 5.
7008920	7017160	Which isn't really the answer they were looking for, because, well, OK, so I can't download
7017160	7018200	it anymore.
7018200	7023800	But technically, if I put it on a drive and then I can move that drive over to the PlayStation
7023800	7025960	5, I should be able to play it.
7025960	7027640	You're never going to be able to play.
7027640	7033240	Well, I don't know if it's so much and here's what I think is going on here.
7033240	7036120	I don't know if it's so much as they don't want you to play it.
7036120	7039400	I mean, yes, Konami would probably like to forget that that is out there.
7039400	7043720	But the reality is the answer they gave is not wrong.
7044600	7051480	They don't want to endorse the methods that people are using to still play P.T.
7051480	7056200	They don't want to endorse that, oh, you can download it somewhere else and use a loophole
7056200	7058760	to get it on your drive and get it to work that way.
7058760	7064280	That's the problem and why Konami has to stick to this line that, no, P.T. is not playable
7064280	7066840	on the PlayStation 5 because there's no way to download it.
7067880	7070600	In their mind and in their league, that is the answer.
7071240	7075800	So I also don't necessarily think like I know people want to jump all over Konami, like
7075800	7077240	stop blowing smoke up our ass.
7077240	7079400	Tell us what the reality is.
7079400	7083000	They're not going to, because if they were to say, oh, yeah, it works fine on PlayStation
7083000	7088760	5, bam, they just endorse these techniques people are using to play P.T. when the game
7088760	7090680	was delisted five years ago.
7092120	7098680	So I think looking at the list that there's 10 games, I think we could all safely bet
7098680	7101160	it's probably going to work, but.
7102440	7103720	Will it work right?
7103720	7110920	It may not, because even the PlayStation Pro, I thought, brought some nuances to that that
7110920	7112280	was kind of dicey.
7112280	7113240	I don't remember.
7113240	7117400	Of course, I have PlayStation Pro and was able to copy P.T. over because you can copy
7117400	7118440	kind of like everything over.
7118440	7120920	But I don't know.
7120920	7121960	I can't remember.
7121960	7125480	And I have to ask the expert if Flaco Jones was here, because he knows that game in and
7125480	7126840	out a lot better than I do.
7126840	7134760	But I could see that there could be some problems with PlayStation 5 and the emulation that
7134760	7136280	it may not work correctly.
7136280	7139240	Not all the tricks you're used to using may actually work.
7139800	7140360	So we'll see.
7142680	7144200	Um, it's dark soccer back by chance.
7145400	7146520	She stepped away for a minute.
7146520	7149080	OK, she's not back, so I can't get to the next segment.
7149080	7150280	So we need to buy some.
7150280	7151240	Oh, OK.
7153000	7154520	No, I was eating cake.
7154520	7156840	Oh, I was eating cake.
7156840	7158120	Sorry, I was doing my story.
7158120	7159080	OK, back to you.
7159080	7159320	All right.
7159320	7160200	Sorry, sorry.
7160200	7160700	All right.
7161400	7163240	Well, I hope the so the cake was not a lie.
7164360	7166040	No, it was an apple streusel cake.
7166040	7168600	OK, because I was like an apple coffee cake.
7168600	7169320	It was pretty good.
7169320	7172040	The question in chat everybody's going to want to know is what kind of cake?
7172840	7176120	OK, it was it was an apple coffee cake.
7176120	7177320	It was delightful.
7177320	7185480	And it made me remember that I've only had a half a protein shake and a sausage and some
7185480	7187720	peanut butter pretzels today.
7187720	7188200	All right.
7188200	7191880	Well, I'm sorry to tear you away, but it is that time to finish it.
7191880	7192440	OK, good.
7192440	7195560	Look, I don't see anything.
7196360	7197720	My Ikea bowl.
7197720	7198220	All right.
7198840	7200520	Let's get to the classic game of the week.
7201160	7205000	Every week, our soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,
7205000	7208040	hey, you brat should be checking this game out.
7208040	7213160	But actually, in a twist for twenty twenty once a month, she picks a pinball game.
7213160	7215640	And it's actually been a little while since we had a pinball game, because I think we
7215640	7218200	did one like early September and now we're in late October.
7218200	7219000	So it's been a little bit.
7219560	7222520	But Dark Soccer has picked a pinball game for us tonight.
7222520	7227320	So I think Dark Soccer, you want me to announce this by playing this actual commercial for
7227320	7228440	the table, right?
7228440	7229720	Just the first part of it, yes.
7229720	7230600	OK, let's do that.
7230600	7232280	And Jamie, you're not going to be able to hear it.
7232280	7233400	So I'll tell you when it's over.
7233400	7239560	OK, so here we go to introduce us to the classic pinball table of the month.
7254280	7255320	Hello, darlings.
7255400	7260200	Yes, it's me, the titillating temptress in the flesh and not much else.
7260200	7262200	Elvira, mistress of the dark.
7262200	7267320	And tonight I have an especially terrifying tale from those monster hit makers of Bally.
7267320	7270360	It stars my favorite actress of all time, me.
7271080	7274760	And it's destined to become a true cult classic forever,
7275400	7277320	or at least until you croak, whichever comes first.
7278280	7280600	But I can see you're ready for some action.
7280600	7282680	So get ready to get scared.
7283240	7286280	All right, Jamie, you can go.
7287080	7288120	There it is, Elvira.
7288120	7288760	I love her.
7288760	7290040	I love her.
7290040	7291880	She is what I love about Halloween anyway.
7292520	7293020	Yeah.
7293960	7299800	So, yes, the classic pinball of the month is scared stiff, which I mean, how could I
7299800	7300300	not?
7301160	7301800	It's perfect.
7301800	7302440	It's perfect.
7302440	7304120	And it's Elvira.
7304120	7305640	Look, here's the funny thing.
7305640	7307640	Elvira invented dad jokes.
7309240	7310120	I know, I know.
7310120	7312120	Just I know it doesn't make sense when I say it.
7312360	7314840	But really, like puns are her strength.
7314840	7319640	And think about that scared stiff and Elvira.
7319640	7321720	It's I love it.
7321720	7322440	Anyway, go ahead.
7323560	7329240	And by the way, I do have a little, little teensy correction.
7329240	7332760	The new pinball is not scared stiff.
7332760	7335320	It is Elvira's house of horrors, just saying.
7336520	7338360	So it is not scared stiff.
7339000	7345720	Um, anyway, scared stiff, uh, came out in 1996, uh, was designed by Dennis Nordman and
7345720	7347800	released by Midway as Bally.
7348600	7354680	And, um, of course it stars Elvira and it is the follow up to 1989 Elvira and the party
7354680	7356680	monsters that was also designed by Nordman.
7357320	7361800	Um, it uses Midway's, uh, WPC 95 system.
7362440	7364840	Um, and it has this B movie horror theme.
7364840	7366280	Cause I mean, it's freaking Elvira.
7366840	7372600	You have to go through the six tales of terror to level up this different meter and you have
7372600	7378120	eyes of the Bonnie beast terror from the crate stiff in the coffin, the monster's lab night
7378120	7380200	of the leapers and return to the dead heads.
7380840	7385400	Um, and of course it does have this like interactive back box is really cool.
7385400	7393080	It had this, uh, spider in, um, you know, in different, uh, different, uh, neat modes.
7393080	7398200	And of course, uh, when they, uh, exhibited the game, they had Cassandra Peterson there
7398200	7399640	as Elvira to help with the promotion.
7400360	7404440	Um, and it was supposed to have some other things in there.
7404440	7409400	It was supposed to have a rubber boogeyman figure that would, uh, be mounted over slingshots.
7409400	7412840	They're supposed to move forward with the kicker when the ball was hit.
7413400	7418200	Um, and the ROM actually still allows for them to dance to the music during boogeyman
7418200	7418840	boogie mode.
7419400	7424440	Um, but it was removed because their arms were going to break off.
7425160	7428520	Um, so, uh, but the code is still there.
7428520	7431000	And so people have still done the mods on it.
7431000	7437400	Um, scared stuff is also licensed for pinball arcade until, uh, June 30th, 2018.
7438200	7440360	So a little bit more about that.
7440360	7445400	Of course, you know, we had, uh, her doing voice acting for, for the, uh, for the game.
7446040	7452200	There are so many things going on with this table that it's, uh, it's pretty good.
7452200	7454040	It's, it's got a lot going on.
7454680	7461240	Um, and so, uh, there's also this skull pile in the upper right-hand corner of the play field.
7461240	7466680	Um, that was supposed to have lighter buys, but the production versions did not do that.
7466680	7470840	And so people have also added in, uh, after factory LEDs.
7471320	7474840	Um, so there is a website out there though.
7474840	7479720	That is like, and it, it looks like one of those old web pages that was designed in like
7480760	7488920	19, you know, 95 using AOLs, you know, designer tools, like very, very rudimentary HTML,
7488920	7494440	geo cities, but, uh, maybe, but it's this guy's like domain and everything.
7494440	7499960	So, um, but, uh, he's got some very cool stuff on here, like some different treasures and
7499960	7502840	behind the scenes stuff for, uh, scared stuff.
7502840	7507640	It's just, uh, robertwinter.com slash pinball slash SS.
7508280	7512360	And I mean, just got, I mean, yeah, it's not a pretty site, but it's got some really neat
7512360	7516760	things to look at, like the back glass and the differences between the different machines.
7516760	7521560	And I don't normally bring up, you know, another website to talk about a game that,
7521560	7525480	that I'm discussing, but in this case, while it's not the best site,
7525480	7527560	it's got some really neat stuff on it.
7527560	7532200	So I totally suggest people look at it and it's got the rulesheets up and, you know,
7532200	7535720	we had, you know, we had a scared stiff in my house for a while, but due to COVID,
7535720	7537320	no one could come over and play it with us.
7537320	7539320	So there you go.
7540040	7540840	It's scared stiff.
7543560	7543960	All right.
7544680	7547240	I didn't realize there were three Elvira games now.
7548280	7551240	Yeah, the, the current one is a stern pinball.
7551320	7558600	And, um, if you watch Netflix channel, um, he's done, uh, some play on it already.
7558600	7559080	I think.
7559080	7561720	Um, so, uh, what's his name?
7561720	7562280	Jack danger.
7562840	7568200	Um, really, it looks really solid, but I mean, I've, I've hardly played any of the stern ones
7568200	7572200	that I haven't enjoyed as a table, even if I haven't enjoyed the theming.
7572200	7574200	Um, so yeah, scared.
7574200	7578920	I mean, if I was going to do a modern pinball, I don't, I would actually have done Munsters.
7579880	7585160	Um, like that Munsters, uh, black and white le, um, that has like a mini play field in
7585160	7585560	the middle.
7585560	7587400	That is really, really cool.
7588040	7591960	Um, but, uh, but I mean, we're going classics.
7591960	7593080	This is a classic game.
7593080	7594840	And pinball is a classic.
7594840	7602920	You know, 1996, I was playing this at a bar, um, at, gosh, it wasn't, it wasn't Solomon's
7602920	7603560	that got it in.
7603560	7606600	It was another place that had gotten to pinball in.
7606600	7608840	And I played this probably not too long after it came out.
7609800	7610360	Nice.
7610360	7611640	And yes, Bobby, I agree.
7611640	7614840	The Hot Wheels, uh, table is actually pretty decent.
7614840	7617400	Um, I have seen it in play on a live stream.
7617400	7618360	I haven't been able to play it.
7619400	7623480	I will say about this table, and you can actually see this as the, the person is playing here
7623480	7627240	on, on Twitch and you probably can hear it too in the audio, especially earlier in the
7627240	7630680	sequence, but jackpots are really easy to get in this game.
7630680	7634040	Like, because every mode that you activate has some way to get like a jackpot.
7634040	7637880	And so as you, if you're decent enough at this game, you can just get jackpot, jackpot,
7637880	7639560	jackpot, jackpot, like over and over.
7639560	7640920	It's pretty, pretty interesting.
7641480	7646920	So yeah, but the thing is that the skill is to get your multipliers with it, but I do
7646920	7647560	love this table.
7649160	7651480	I do love this table because I love Elvira.
7651480	7655880	So yeah, honestly, I think this one's more fun than a party monsters.
7655880	7658200	So yeah, your mileage may vary.
7658200	7658600	All right.
7658600	7659160	There it is.
7659160	7660760	Your classic pinball of the month.
7660760	7662920	Elvira scared stiff.
7662920	7667720	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk quickly about some other things.
7667720	7670840	Happening around the industry or actually, Jimmy, are you staying with us or did you
7670840	7671880	need to go part way?
7671880	7672440	I can't remember.
7673000	7677560	You know, I actually, um, my, my headache has come back with a vengeance.
7677560	7684280	Um, so, and, and just to let everybody know, you know, I, I really wanted to stay and finish
7684280	7689880	the show tonight, but, um, I either I have neck pain caused by migraine or migraine caused
7689880	7690600	by neck pain.
7690600	7692200	So either way, I'm fucked.
7692920	7693640	Oh dear.
7693640	7694440	We'll feel better.
7694440	7695080	It's okay.
7695080	7695960	Thank you so much.
7695960	7699080	And you know, guys, I, I love all of you.
7699080	7703400	You're all amazing people and, um, a little, little teeny plug if I may.
7703400	7703640	Yeah.
7704200	7709560	Um, don't forget that on Thursday I am going to be a guest on am I mental?
7709560	7716920	If you go to am I mental.net, um, I will be talking with, uh, E who was on the show last
7716920	7722040	weekend, um, about mental health and, you know, I'm, I'm probably going to be pretty
7722040	7722680	brutal on here.
7722680	7725880	So you're going to see a side of me that I don't often, uh, talk about.
7726440	7731000	Uh, I might talk a little bit about on the show, but I, uh, I don't go off into too much
7731000	7735000	detail about, so we're going to get dirty, whatever you're comfortable with.
7735000	7736600	So enjoy the show.
7736600	7737720	He was a great guest.
7737720	7739000	That was a good talk last week.
7739000	7744440	So he's a, he's a great person, a good friend, and I'm really happy we could have him and
7744440	7746360	I'm happy that I get to be on a show.
7746360	7747080	All right.
7747080	7747320	All right.
7747320	7748600	Well, we'll talk to you next week.
7748600	7749080	Feel better.
7749800	7750200	All right.
7750200	7750680	Love y'all.
7750680	7751080	Bye.
7751080	7751320	Bye.
7751880	7752280	All right.
7752280	7754760	So meanwhile, just, uh, nevermind the visuals here.
7754760	7758280	I got to get sorted around, uh, but perhaps we will get into some rapid fire news and
7758280	7762120	I will have Loki start us off with rapid fire news here while I fix the visuals.
7762920	7763240	Yeah.
7763240	7768520	So a game I was talking about a lot, uh, earlier this year was what the golf, and of course
7768520	7771000	it being an Epic games exclusive at the time.
7771560	7776280	Um, you could only purchase it there, but of course, after a certain amount of time,
7776280	7782120	it does eventually appear on other storefronts and this time now appearing on steam.
7782120	7786200	And with an added bonus that they've added a level editor for it.
7786200	7791560	So it's a great time to go purchase it now on steam and you can go check it out, uh,
7791560	7793160	with the level editor.
7793800	7798120	Um, and it's also on sale, so, um, definitely go check that out as well.
7798760	7803480	Um, I'm not sure if the level editor is going to be coming to other platforms, but at the
7803480	7804680	very least it's on steam.
7804680	7807240	So I may have to purchase it again.
7807240	7807640	We'll see.
7808520	7815400	And then, um, as we had talked about a while ago that you play is going to be phased out
7815400	7820920	in place of, um, uh, let's see Ubisoft connect.
7820920	7826920	So they've got, um, one of the things with you play that actually kind of dug a little
7826920	7828680	bit is playing certain games.
7828680	7832840	Like, you know, like for example, I used to play South park a lot, um, would earn you
7833480	7836440	points that you could then use to unlock.
7837560	7842760	Not necessarily DLC, but like usually cosmetics in like things for different games.
7842760	7843880	I saw it in just dance.
7843880	7847240	You could get some remixes that way and little things, little costumes and things.
7847240	7847480	Yeah.
7847480	7847800	Yeah.
7847800	7853000	So I used to do that for like different classes and stuff in, um, the South park games and
7853000	7853960	stuff like that.
7853960	7859720	So, uh, with that though, because that service is going to going away, they've decided to
7859720	7862040	unlock all of the rewards.
7862040	7866680	So you can go check them out before it's finally phased out on October 29th.
7866680	7868680	So you have the rest of this week to do that.
7868680	7871400	So go download all those extras.
7871400	7874840	If you can time to get out all your old Ubisoft games.
7874840	7875400	Exactly.
7875400	7879720	I think I've gotten most of my stuff already, you know, cause the points are pretty easy
7879720	7880200	to get.
7880840	7886280	Um, so, but I still have to revisit some of the Ubisoft games that I have to go download
7886280	7887800	all that like bonus things for that.
7887800	7890680	So, um, just a reminder to go check that out.
7890680	7893640	Um, so yeah, so that's pretty exciting.
7893640	7898120	It was one of those things that, um, kind of made you play feel, feel a little better
7898120	7902520	than some of the other third party, uh, signup things is that they kind of had that whole
7902520	7907400	like achievements make you, you actually get tangible things from achievements and that
7907400	7907960	was kind of neat.
7909000	7909240	Yeah.
7909240	7911640	It was nice to have that little bonus in there.
7911640	7913640	Um, so I do appreciate that.
7913640	7919240	It wasn't such a bother on like console when I was playing most of, you know, these games,
7919240	7924440	but I know with a PC having the extra launcher kind of sucks, but you know, whatever.
7925080	7925320	Yeah.
7925960	7926680	All right.
7926680	7929160	Well, moving on, let's talk about a new studio.
7929160	7932440	Um, that's up and coming frost giant studios.
7932440	7936600	And, uh, you probably wouldn't be surprised that when I tell you frost giant studios is
7936600	7939880	formed by a lot of blizzard enter to get it frost giant blizzard.
7939880	7944600	I it's hilarious, but, uh, the actual little mascot, it's not so obvious at first cause
7944600	7948200	a little mascot for frost giant is an actual little like frost giant.
7948200	7951960	Um, but anyway, it's a former blizzard folks and look, I, I get it.
7951960	7954840	Uh, you know, blizzard is in an awkward place.
7954840	7958040	Uh, they're not quite the cool company they used to be.
7958040	7962440	Obviously we had all those, you know, issues with the, the banning of the starcraft player
7962440	7964200	that was supporting free Hong Kong.
7964200	7969160	Um, last year, uh, that was really awkward and their response was really awkward and
7969160	7972360	like a lot of awkward things have been happening with blizzard lately.
7973320	7978840	But I suppose the good news is that, you know, blizzard will still continue to put out their
7978840	7986040	products and you now have this frost giant studios who has raised $4.7 million to make
7986040	7990360	their first game, which will be a real time strategy game, which.
7991080	7995000	Where did blizzard get, get their roots with Warcraft star?
7995000	7995800	And I don't mean world.
7995800	8001320	I mean, Warcraft, uh, two and three and then star craft, you know, it was really that RTS
8001320	8002040	genre.
8002040	8007720	Um, so, which is interesting because I'm not usually into those kinds of games, but I liked
8007720	8012200	old Warcraft a lot and I liked, no, I don't, I didn't really play original starcraft.
8012200	8016120	I guess I just played Warcraft two and original Diablo, which isn't really an RTS.
8016120	8018280	Um, but I'll try this.
8018280	8019240	Uh, it'll be interesting.
8020040	8025240	Anyway, Tim Morton and Tim Campbell from Starcraft and Warcraft, uh, said recently in an interview
8025240	8030280	that the RTS genre hasn't gotten as much attention lately, uh, like battle royale shooters or
8030280	8035080	console action games, but they think the RTS on the PC can still be a big, big part of
8035080	8035880	gaming in the future.
8035880	8036680	So good luck to them.
8036680	8038840	I'm going to look forward to see what they have coming.
8038840	8040440	Uh, cause that sounds pretty cool.
8040440	8041160	All right.
8041160	8046840	Uh, let's talk about Pokemon go, which has added AR mapping to their tasks.
8046840	8051640	I talked to similar to, uh, well, yeah, it's the same damn thing.
8051640	8053960	Um, but just the implementation is different.
8053960	8057880	So you might remember it was about three months ago on this show, but I was talking about
8057880	8065400	the cemetery creeping, which I did pull back on a lot between the heat and the smoke from
8065400	8066440	all the fires.
8066440	8069080	I wasn't really able to go out on the weekends as much.
8069080	8073320	Um, and I just, since I got back, you know, from being gone a couple of weeks ago, I just
8073320	8076120	haven't gotten out this weekend or last weekend, but I want to go out and do that more.
8076120	8077240	Cause that's kind of fun.
8077240	8080360	Um, so you might remember, I talked about that on the show, like where I was scanning
8080360	8080840	portals.
8080840	8081560	Well, guess what?
8081560	8084680	That is now just in Pokemon go.
8084680	8089480	Um, but it's been in there for like a month, but there was no reason to scan.
8089480	8091720	There was no motivation or anything.
8091720	8095720	So Pokemon go Niantic, they actually added some incentives.
8095720	8098920	So there's some tasks that you can get called AR mapping.
8098920	8103400	Uh, and then if you do the actual little scan of the portal, you might get a cool little
8103400	8106040	reward, like 10 Pokeballs or whatever it is.
8106040	8109560	Of course, when I was reading Reddit, some people are already kind of fucking with this.
8109560	8113560	Like when they get a task, they'll just scan the ground or something, um, which is like
8113560	8118920	not what you're supposed to do, but I guess if Niantic doesn't quality check, then I guess
8118920	8119960	people are going to do that.
8119960	8125240	Although I will say now, I don't know if this is in Pokemon go yet, but I will say in Ingress
8125240	8130120	in the last patch for Ingress, probably about two, three weeks ago, they actually made it
8130120	8133560	so that the scan will detect motion.
8133560	8139160	And if you don't move, you can't, you, you won't be able to finish the scan and you have
8139160	8141080	to have well lit conditions.
8141080	8146200	So if it's too dark or dark, so dark, you can't see the portal, which happened to me
8146200	8146760	the other night.
8146760	8149560	I was at a park and sundown is just happening earlier and earlier.
8149560	8150920	So we're getting later in the year.
8150920	8155480	Um, so I could not actually scan anymore at the park because the game said it's too dark
8155480	8156200	out.
8156200	8161400	Um, so I don't know if those fail safes are in Pokemon go cause I haven't been scanning.
8161400	8161720	Okay.
8161720	8163800	S.J. and Hunter Matt says it is in Pogo.
8163800	8165960	It won't accept the scan unless you move around.
8165960	8166280	Thank you.
8166280	8169800	Cause I haven't been doing it cause I'm already doing it in Ingress.
8169800	8173880	I just wish my Ingress credits would come over to Pokemon go.
8173880	8179560	But what's interesting is that you can see some stops and gyms have the tasks, but not
8179560	8180360	all of them do.
8181400	8185960	And I like, for instance, one right by my house doesn't have the task.
8185960	8187880	Well, I'll tell you why it doesn't have the task.
8188440	8191080	I scanned that fucking thing lots of times.
8191080	8192040	It doesn't need anymore.
8193240	8198120	And, and not just me, but people that wanted to knock me off his scout controller, um,
8198120	8201320	and other people on my team as well, who just were nearby.
8201320	8204120	And cause sometimes we get together and exchange gear and stuff.
8204120	8206840	And so they wanted to scan it as well.
8206840	8211640	Uh, that is probably why it doesn't show up as a place that you can do scanning in, um,
8212760	8213480	Pokemon go.
8213480	8214680	I just thought that was interesting.
8214680	8219080	So if some something by your house doesn't have a task available, somebody from Ingress
8219080	8222840	probably already scanned it a ton already, but I'll tell you hardly anyone's doing it
8222840	8223720	in Ingress either.
8223720	8225720	Cause the rewards in Ingress are minimal.
8226440	8227400	It's like a badge.
8227400	8229000	You don't even get gear or nothing.
8229000	8230600	So it's a little silly.
8230600	8231100	All right.
8231880	8234680	A hot pocketry in chat says, bring a flashlight.
8234680	8236920	I tried to use the one on my phone, but it wouldn't work.
8237480	8239000	I didn't think to bring a separate one.
8239000	8239880	I didn't think I'd need it.
8240600	8241560	So, all right.
8241560	8242680	Uh, let's move on.
8242680	8244200	Uh, Jamie had some stories too.
8244200	8246280	Are you able to do these Loki or you want me to do them?
8246280	8246680	I don't care.
8247480	8249480	Um, yeah, I can, I can talk about them.
8249480	8249980	Okay.
8250040	8251800	Um, so apparently.
8252920	8253640	Let's see.
8253720	8261880	There's a new, I mean, as with all times of the year, Humble has some new, um, a Halloween
8261880	8263880	sale kind of going on there.
8263880	8266600	So of course, discounting lots of different Halloween games.
8266600	8271720	I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of different store friends that are doing similar things.
8271720	8273640	I know Epic had something marked down.
8273640	8278680	I'm sure PlayStation Store did kind of everybody's discounting all the Halloween themed stuff.
8278680	8285080	So of course, Resident Evil 7, uh, Batman Arkham Knight, uh, game of Arkham City, all
8285080	8288280	that stuff's like, you know, 75% off, 80% off.
8288280	8290440	So, uh, just go check all your storefronts.
8291080	8292040	It's probably a good idea.
8293560	8303160	And then, um, to go along with that, of course, also there was, uh, Zen Pinball had some,
8304120	8307320	uh, new titles that are being announced.
8307320	8310360	I guess from Alpha Numeric Pinball.
8311080	8320200	So they've got, let's see, Williams Pinball 6, and the tables include Fun House, Space
8320200	8323320	Station, Dr. Dudes, and his excellent Ray.
8324120	8326120	I am not familiar with any of these.
8326120	8328280	I apparently don't play enough pinball.
8328280	8330120	Fun House would be the most well known.
8330120	8333640	Fun House had a very scary looking face on the table.
8333640	8333960	Okay.
8333960	8335080	I do remember Fun House.
8335880	8342840	I'm not sure about, but, um, so yeah, so that's pretty cool.
8342840	8349400	Um, you can check those out for, uh, Pinball FX 3 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo
8349400	8355240	Switch, Windows 10, and Steam, as well as on the Williams Pinball app, iOS, and Google
8355240	8355560	Play.
8356520	8357000	All right.
8357560	8361080	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are
8361080	8363960	coming out near you real soon.
8364040	8368520	As we start to ramp up to the release of new systems, if you can believe it, we're what
8368520	8370280	we're three weeks away from new systems.
8370840	8371800	Two weeks.
8371800	8372120	Wow.
8373160	8374120	Not even three.
8374120	8377320	Yeah, no, it's three because next week is Halloween.
8377320	8381880	Then we get the November 7th, it's three weeks, but it's close.
8382920	8383160	Yeah.
8383720	8387320	So, uh, starting off with this week, we've got Cobra Kai.
8387320	8393320	The Karate Kid Saga continues on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
8393400	8398440	Ghost Runner on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
8399160	8403880	The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel 4 on PlayStation 4.
8404680	8407640	Oddworld New and Tasty on Nintendo Switch.
8408680	8412680	Pacer on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
8413320	8419800	Shin Megami Tensei 3 Nocturne HD Remaster on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
8420440	8426920	And we've got Watchdog Legion on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia.
8428040	8432920	Angry Video Game Nerd 1 and 2 Deluxe on PC and Nintendo Switch.
8433960	8439240	The Dark Pictures Anthology Little Hope on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
8440280	8444520	Mad Rat Dead on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
8444520	8447160	Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Nintendo Switch.
8447880	8451480	The Mahari Kawasi Fresh on PlayStation 4.
8452360	8457080	Visage on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
8457080	8457560	That's it.
8458120	8461960	Just a random question from chat, um, over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
8461960	8465320	Pod Culture asks, how many system launches is OLR covered?
8465320	8469800	Um, so I mean, launches, we weren't on the air.
8469800	8472040	So our first show was in 2002.
8472760	8476520	And even though we were pretty exclusively about music games in those early years, like,
8476600	8478280	you know, it came up all the time.
8478280	8479640	We would still get tangents.
8479640	8482440	You know, Dark Soccer loved her classics and her Dreamcast and stuff.
8482440	8485880	So we would take tangents all the time outside the music and stuff.
8485880	8492280	So I would say we were covering the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast and we were covering that era.
8492280	8495720	But it was kind of like, we didn't cover the launch, obviously,
8495720	8498840	because Dreamcast came out in 99, PS2 was what, 2001.
8498840	8500920	So we weren't quite on the air yet.
8500920	8505800	I remember one of the big things was I just got my Japanese PlayStation 2 before OLR started.
8505800	8507320	So that was like a thing.
8507320	8511400	Um, so when it comes to launches, then we did like PlayStation 3.
8511400	8514200	And I think Xbox 360 was just before that.
8514200	8514920	And then PS3.
8514920	8517240	And I think Wii came out around the same time.
8517240	8521080	So we covered all that because that was the big lines where we were handing out donuts and stuff.
8521080	8524360	Uh, and then of course we did the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8524360	8526440	And then now the PlayStation 5 and so forth.
8526440	8531080	So, um, as Bobby said in chat, this will be the fourth generation of the, of the big three.
8531080	8531720	And that's about right.
8531720	8539160	3DS and Nintendo DS and Vita and PSP.
8539160	8542120	And I think, uh, and Amico next year.
8542120	8551160	Um, let's see the, um, let's see, uh, what was I going to say to, um, Xbox?
8551160	8555320	The original Xbox had also already been out, uh, when the show started.
8555320	8560360	I, I bought my Xbox, I think a couple months into doing the show.
8560360	8563960	Cause I finally bought one for Halo and, uh, to play DDR.
8564600	8565960	So, uh, yeah.
8565960	8566120	Yeah.
8566120	8567800	All three consoles are out by 2002.
8567800	8572200	So it's, it's been a lot, but it's also interesting to think considering that we've been doing
8572200	8574280	this Loki for 18 and a half years.
8575720	8579080	Um, it is interesting to think it's actually not that many.
8579720	8583560	When you think just how long we've been doing this show, it's not that many launches all
8583560	8584440	things considered.
8584440	8588200	This is the first one that should have been, this was supposed to be a 10 year generation.
8588200	8589560	Well, this is the first one.
8589560	8591000	This is the first one in a pandemic.
8592040	8593720	So it'll be interesting.
8593720	8593960	All right.
8593960	8594680	Anyway, sorry.
8594680	8597240	Uh, tangent question, but I thought it was a good one.
8597240	8601000	Uh, going to, uh, Japan and checking out the releases there.
8601000	8607080	We have coming out on the 29th, Mad Rat Dead, Shantae and the Seven Sirens on Nintendo Switch.
8607080	8609240	Uh, Shimagami Tensei 3 Nocturne.
8609240	8610920	It's an HD remaster of that.
8610920	8611640	Cool.
8611640	8616360	Uh, and then Common Rider Memory of Heroes, uh, is coming out as well in Japan.
8616360	8617560	That's on the Switch.
8617560	8622920	And also Taishu Cross Alice Heads and Tails is coming out as well.
8623480	8627560	Uh, going over to the PlayStation 4, I imagine we're going to see some overlap.
8627560	8628360	Uh, yeah.
8628360	8632120	Watch Dogs Legion actually is also out, uh, this coming week in Japan.
8632120	8633080	So that's pretty cool.
8633080	8634840	As is the Mad Rat Dead.
8634840	8637480	Uh, there is a Kemco RPG selection.
8637480	8643400	It's volume five of some various RPGs from over the years by Kemco put together in that,
8643400	8648520	including As Divine Menace, Wizards of Brandel, Sea Carts and Innocent Revengers.
8648520	8650280	Those are all the games that are going to be in it.
8650280	8653400	Uh, and then Shimagami Tensei remaster is out on PS4.
8653400	8657240	Uh, Saints Row the Third remastered gets its Japanese release.
8657240	8659320	So they must've done some things to localize it for Japan.
8659320	8660520	Cause that came out here a while ago.
8661080	8664120	Uh, it was on the Switch probably I'm guessing, right?
8664120	8665320	This one's on the PlayStation 4.
8665880	8667160	Oh, PlayStation 4.
8667160	8667720	Yeah.
8667720	8668760	That's been a while.
8668760	8670440	Yeah, but they, they might've localized it.
8670440	8670920	I don't know.
8670920	8672920	That's why sometimes why it's a little delayed in Japan.
8673000	8677080	Some of the releases that are a little more, uh, made for this audience, they take a while
8677080	8678120	to localize.
8678120	8683960	Uh, Common Rider Memory of Heroes also released on PlayStation 4 this week and, uh, a price
8683960	8688680	reduction and game of the year edition for Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.
8689320	8690520	How about the UK, Loki?
8691880	8697720	Um, in the UK we've got Cobra Kai, the Karate Kid Saga continues on PlayStation 4 and Xbox
8697720	8703480	One looks like Company of Heroes 2 All Out War Edition on PC.
8704600	8709400	Who Wants to be a Millionaire on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.
8709960	8714120	Watchdog Legion on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8714760	8717400	Mortal Shell on Xbox One.
8718360	8724440	We've got the Dark Pictures Anthology Volume One on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8725320	8727640	Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Nintendo Switch.
8728920	8731160	Ninja Legends on PlayStation 4.
8731800	8738040	The Dark Pictures Anthology Little Hope on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8738920	8745560	And last but not least, Dead Cells Prisoners Edition on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
8747400	8748040	All right.
8748040	8751560	So lots, you know, we're getting into November when all the games are going to come out.
8751560	8753640	So, uh, busy, busy, busy.
8753640	8754120	All right.
8754440	8757960	We are going to now, uh, get back into some other news.
8757960	8760280	Um, I can't believe it's already 8 30.
8760280	8763400	So we may cover this news a little quickly because we want to get some of your questions.
8763400	8764680	There's no emails tonight though.
8764680	8767240	So we, we only have time for questions at the end.
8767240	8769320	Hopefully we'll get some, but we have a few stories first.
8769320	8769820	Loki.
8770680	8771000	Yeah.
8771000	8778680	So, um, Mojang announced that they're going to be migrating everybody over to Microsoft
8778680	8783640	accounts, including folks that are, well, I should say only the Java edition players
8783720	8788520	of Minecraft because everybody already is on Minecraft or, um, Microsoft accounts.
8788520	8792040	If you're playing Minecraft on consoles or the windows 10 edition.
8792680	8796760	Um, so they are going to be migrating folks over to Microsoft accounts.
8796760	8800360	You're going to have to create one for the Java edition soon.
8800360	8805960	Um, which will allow you to have the two factor authentication and, you know, improve parental
8805960	8808120	controls and all that wonderful stuff.
8808120	8812920	Nothing else really changed about the game aside from how you log into it, instead of
8812920	8816360	having to have a separate Mojang account or Minecraft.net account.
8816920	8822440	Uh, you'll be able to log in using that to incentivize people to do so.
8822440	8826280	Um, you will actually get a free Cape.
8826280	8829880	So they're going to offer you a free Cape that you can use for your character as well.
8830440	8834360	Um, and starting this fall, you'll have to create those Microsoft accounts.
8834360	8840520	So they haven't really specified a specific date yet, but it'll be pretty easy to do that.
8840680	8844920	I kind of liked that cause I don't use the Java version too often.
8844920	8850120	So I tend to forget my Mojang, um, login credentials.
8850760	8854440	So, um, it'll be nice to just have it all under one.
8855080	8859320	But some people are trying to equate this to the Facebook Oculus thing and I'm like,
8860840	8862600	no, not necessarily.
8862600	8864360	It doesn't seem nearly as bad.
8865080	8870280	No, they're the, I mean, you have to have a Microsoft account already for like the other
8870360	8873160	versions of, um, Minecraft.
8873160	8877240	And it's not necessarily like, this isn't tied to like social media or anything.
8877240	8879320	They're not requesting your real name.
8879320	8880520	They don't really care.
8880520	8885240	It's just, it's just basically a centralized, um, login service.
8885240	8885960	It makes sense.
8885960	8890040	I mean, why have it just for consistency across the board?
8890040	8895560	Why would you have a separate login for the Java version versus everything else?
8895560	8899320	You just, it's much more simpler than maintain one system.
8899320	8901400	Especially one that they're using across all their products.
8901400	8905400	I don't see the point in having to create a separate login and maintain that.
8905400	8908040	Um, it's much easier.
8908040	8910600	And plus this way too, it makes it a lot easier.
8910600	8914440	Cause, um, I know I'm not sure if they're still offering it, but they used to be, if
8914440	8918840	you buy the Java version, you get the windows 10 version for free.
8918840	8924920	And it's just easier to link that all together this way versus having to give you a key that
8924920	8930920	you then go log into your windows 10 account and, you know, get the game that way.
8930920	8932040	It doesn't make any sense.
8932040	8933640	It's just, it's much easier.
8933640	8938520	So, uh, and I, I'm, I also failed to see what the big deal is about this, honestly,
8938520	8940840	but I want to, you know, let every gamer have a voice.
8940840	8946040	And I see in chat, Zen monkey 11 says, no, thank you Mojang and says, just make Java
8946040	8947800	open source or leave it be.
8947800	8951960	And I can kind of get that perspective is that, you know, Java is kind of like, wow,
8951960	8954760	classic in a way, you know, it's, it's caters to
8954760	8956360	a very specific audience.
8956360	8960280	Um, and I can also understand where it's just kind of like, just, just let it, let it,
8960280	8963000	let it live in its own little corner and stop bothering it.
8964040	8965000	Do you see that perspective?
8965000	8965500	Loki?
8966360	8969000	No, I mean, they're, they're still doing upgrades for it and everything.
8969000	8971800	I don't see, I don't really see an issue with this.
8971800	8977320	I don't equate this to be the same thing as, um, what Facebook's doing with Oculus.
8977320	8979480	Well, and it is, it isn't, I'm saying some people.
8979480	8982840	And I also agree cause Rama says that's a stretch and I agree.
8982840	8985960	And Bobby says the Facebook Oculus thing is because Facebook can decide you shouldn't
8985960	8987320	have an account for whatever reason.
8987320	8989480	And that means you can't use an Oculus device.
8989480	8993640	For instance, if you don't use your exact legal name, boom, no Oculus.
8993640	8999560	Um, which is one of many reasons why I'm going to say I will never buy an Oculus and I'm
8999560	9004040	going to encourage all my friends, including Bobby Blackwolf, who is a VR guru.
9004040	9004600	I understand.
9004600	9005640	But I already have one.
9006200	9006600	You know what?
9006600	9007240	And that's fine.
9007240	9010920	And I understand because Bobby might be like, I need one because I'm such an enthusiast.
9010920	9011400	Fine.
9011400	9012280	I'll let it go.
9012280	9014120	But I'm going to be actively encouraging people.
9014120	9019400	I know not to buy Oculus because then there was a whole thing this week about you can't
9019400	9021400	like share things on the store.
9021400	9024120	Or like if you delete your Facebook account, then you basically lose everything you've
9024120	9024840	bought.
9024840	9026920	It's it's bad.
9026920	9029000	Like, no, thank you.
9029000	9036200	I mean, I will say thank you Facebook for making the decision of which VR platform to
9036200	9041720	go with on the PC a lot easier for me by taking yourselves out of the equation.
9042280	9044360	Thank you.
9044360	9048280	You can't have multiple quests, one quest per account, because they're afraid you're
9048280	9050760	going to give a quest with your account to someone else.
9050760	9051320	Yeah.
9051320	9051960	But all right.
9051960	9054280	Anyway, so I think I think we've made it very clear.
9054280	9057080	It's not the same thing, even though some people are trying to say it is.
9057080	9062120	But I also like this way, like like I think here's one of the things I think that they're
9062120	9062440	trying to do.
9062440	9068280	They're trying to get parity across Java and the bedrock conditions already.
9068280	9074360	So what I think they're trying to shoot for here is with maybe 117 that they're going
9074360	9075560	to try.
9075560	9080440	Maybe they're going to have enabled some sort of cross play option for Java and bedrock
9081080	9084840	to be able to do it that way, because I know right now it's still very different.
9084840	9087560	And there's like features that are in one that aren't in the other one.
9087560	9091720	But maybe the end goal is to have everybody be able to play together if they want to.
9092440	9097800	And definitely, you know, the new log in doesn't affect anything like modding or using like
9097880	9099240	bucket or any of that stuff.
9099800	9106200	It's just strictly instead of using your Microsoft to count the log in, you'll use your or your
9106200	9107400	Minecraft log in.
9107400	9109400	You'll just use your Microsoft log in.
9109400	9109640	Okay.
9110600	9111240	All right.
9111240	9115480	Well, let's move on and talk about another hot Microsoft property, and that's Halo.
9115480	9122920	And Halo, the Master Chief Collection, I believe was a launch title for Xbox One, if I am not
9122920	9123560	mistaken.
9123560	9124920	No, maybe not a launch title.
9124920	9126280	It was pretty close.
9126280	9128440	It was pretty close, if not like a launch.
9128440	9133160	But anyway, it had some rough spots when it first came out, but they've been working on
9133160	9136280	it consistently really throughout the years to make it better.
9136280	9137880	And it's in a really good place right now.
9137880	9143160	And it's going to be further upgraded to essentially be a bit of a launch title for Xbox Series
9143160	9145480	X as well as S as well.
9147080	9152040	So November 17th, Halo, the Master Chief Collection is going to get some upgrades.
9152040	9158840	And that means you will now be able to play the game at 120 frames a second on both X
9158840	9162680	and S. On X, you can do this in 4K.
9162680	9163880	That's pretty cool.
9163880	9166520	So it's going to be a smooth game.
9166520	9168760	Can I find a TV that can actually support that?
9168760	9169400	Probably not.
9170200	9172600	Oh, but as a quick aside, Loki, you might get a kick out of this.
9172600	9175160	I bought my 4K TV yesterday.
9175160	9178840	It's just I'm having it delivered so that they can take the box and all that crap out
9178840	9180280	of here and that stuff.
9180840	9181880	I did it all through Costco.
9181880	9183400	It's only 20 bucks to do that through Costco.
9183400	9184120	So I was like, whatever.
9185240	9187080	And so I bought my TV.
9187080	9189640	So and I'm sure you're all dying to know, what did I end up going with?
9189640	9192040	Did I get the OLED I'd been talking about?
9192840	9193880	No, I did not.
9193880	9198200	I finally decided that was just a little too expensive for me.
9198200	9199400	Not knocking the TV.
9199400	9201320	They're pretty devices.
9201320	9202840	So I did not get that.
9202840	9210120	I did get the Samsung QLED, which was kind of like the other kind of fancier
9210120	9210840	LED.
9210840	9214840	I'm aware it's not the same thing as OLED and the whole concept of the pure black and
9214840	9215480	all that stuff.
9215480	9221160	But I felt for the price I was willing to spend, it was pretty enough.
9222600	9224920	So that's my new TV.
9224920	9227480	And that's getting here on this coming Friday.
9227480	9229880	So I'll be able to talk more about that on the next OLR.
9229880	9233800	But I will actually be able to enjoy my Xbox Series X.
9233800	9237160	That's another reason I had to be a little bit price conscious is like getting a TV and
9237160	9238120	a new console.
9238360	9240440	I could not do a TV and two new consoles.
9240440	9242840	So PlayStation 5 has to wait for next year.
9242840	9248520	But TV and one console, it's going to be nice that I'm going to be having that because it's
9248520	9251560	almost like it's going to be just a new gaming experience.
9251560	9255160	It's the first time I really will have been doing a lot of gaming in 4K.
9255160	9257640	I've done this much on my PC.
9257640	9261480	And it's things that will actually run on my current setup in 4K, which is stuff like
9261480	9262600	Diablo 3.
9262600	9264120	Wow, wow is 4K right now.
9265320	9265800	So yeah.
9265800	9268440	So I'm really excited to check something like this out.
9268440	9270600	Like Halo, the Master Chief Collection.
9270600	9277480	And I think it's pretty nice on Xbox how you have Game Pass is going to have all these
9277480	9278120	games on it.
9278120	9284200	It's like you're going to have quite a few games to check out right away or yeah.
9285320	9289160	Only Sonic says you need HDMI 2.1 or something like that.
9289160	9290360	This TV does have it.
9290360	9291960	So it's a new enough model to have that.
9292760	9294840	DJ Rama S says Rob, what size TV?
9294840	9297640	65 inch, which is five inches more than I have now.
9299080	9302760	No one special says can the human eye even see 120 frames per second?
9305400	9305880	I don't know.
9305880	9310840	I didn't think they could see 60 and yet I can see it for what it is.
9310840	9312040	So anyway.
9313720	9315160	All right, let's move on.
9317320	9317800	Next story.
9317800	9318920	You want to talk about this, Logie?
9319800	9320520	It's our favorite.
9320520	9321640	It's our favorite company.
9321960	9335400	Yeah, so Konami has re-upped their trademarks for Goemon and apparently a spinoff of the
9335400	9337080	Suikoden series.
9337080	9344840	So they've upped their trademark for Gensou Sui Gaiden and Ganbare Goemon, an emotional
9344840	9345560	voice system.
9345560	9353240	So that was the system that was implemented by the Tokimeki Memorial series.
9353240	9353800	Oh, yeah.
9357480	9358040	Cool.
9358040	9360280	I wonder what they plan on doing with that.
9360280	9364280	They probably don't necessarily plan on doing much with it aside from maybe re-releasing
9364280	9367560	some of this stuff or doing collections or something.
9367560	9369960	Maybe they'll do a Goemon collection.
9370920	9374840	Going on collection would be awesome, especially with all these collections on the Switch where
9375720	9378440	the Mana collection where they actually localize things.
9378440	9381240	Like, I would give Konami a little credit.
9381240	9382440	A little credit.
9382440	9384360	I love The Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
9384360	9386280	Yeah, there's a ton of Goemon games.
9386280	9388040	They should localize some more and put them out.
9388040	9388760	I think that'd be cool.
9390360	9391960	Not Nino Kuni collection.
9391960	9392520	Sorry.
9392520	9397240	Kunio Kun collection that came out not that long ago with all the River City Ransom games
9397960	9402120	and those guys and all those NES games, like the soccer game and stuff that had never
9402120	9405720	come out on here locally.
9405720	9406760	I think that would be really awesome.
9407640	9413320	Orange Rite does point out they did just announce a new Tokimeki Memorial game for the Switch.
9413320	9416600	It's a girl's side game, if I recall correctly.
9416600	9418440	I hope they make another anniversary collection.
9418440	9419400	Those were neat.
9419400	9422360	And Pesto Pacas is laughing at my Nino Kuni collection.
9422360	9426440	Well, with that news on level five last week, sadly, that's never going to happen.
9426440	9428360	That's sad.
9428360	9431800	So but yeah, I you know what?
9431800	9435480	I didn't think it would necessarily be for a Goemon collection.
9435480	9440440	I thought, oh, maybe they're working on a new game, but I somehow the idea of a Goemon
9440440	9443080	collection as opposed to them doing a new game sounds better.
9444360	9446520	Stick to what you stick to your history.
9449080	9449800	All right.
9449800	9450440	Yeah.
9450440	9450920	Yeah.
9450920	9451160	All right.
9451160	9452440	You have another one for us, Logie.
9454120	9458200	Sorry, I've been like trying to fight with the new PlayStation.
9458200	9460200	Store page, the website.
9460200	9463640	Oh, no, I haven't looked at it and I heard it's garbage.
9463640	9464600	It's garbage.
9464600	9471880	So like I forgot to get my PlayStation Plus games for October and I have this button here
9471880	9473160	says join PlayStation Plus.
9473160	9477800	I'm like, well, that's weird because I'm on PlayStation Plus and I've already been paying
9477800	9478360	for it.
9478360	9480920	So why can't I download my games?
9480920	9482520	And that's just in a big loop.
9482520	9483960	Get the games, click the button.
9483960	9485880	It takes me to a page where they want me to join.
9486280	9488600	But I've already joined and I'm also logged in.
9488600	9491240	So what the hell?
9492120	9493000	It's garbage.
9493000	9495000	Did they add titles of games yet?
9497560	9498840	We mean titles of games.
9498840	9500200	I guess I was like, I don't know.
9500200	9503880	They said I was reading some website that was like, when you're in the store, you see
9503880	9506600	the box art, but you don't even see what the whole name of the game.
9506600	9512200	And you can't even see what is Minecraft, the game versus Minecraft DLC packs and all
9512200	9512840	this other stuff.
9512840	9514120	It's just so hard to tell the difference.
9514120	9514680	I don't know.
9514680	9518440	Right now, I'm on the PlayStation Plus page and it's all get the game.
9518440	9519320	So I click the button.
9519320	9524120	It takes me back to the PlayStation Plus page, which says join PlayStation Plus.
9524120	9526280	I don't want to join it because I already have.
9526280	9526840	I'm on it.
9526840	9527480	It renews.
9527480	9528440	In fact, a couple of days.
9531640	9533160	So I guess I got to go through my system.
9536120	9537240	What the hell, man?
9537240	9538280	I don't get it.
9538280	9539400	Anyways, sorry.
9539400	9540760	No, it's fine.
9540760	9542440	I want to know how that was greenlit too.
9542440	9548840	Um, but anyways, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, actually funny enough, I forgot
9548840	9551080	to mention this back when we were talking about Minecraft.
9551080	9556920	So you may remember that Minecraft, uh, Steve was added to, uh, super smash brothers.
9556920	9562200	Well, there's been a small tweak that they have done because apparently it wasn't that
9562200	9562520	small.
9564600	9569320	His winning pose had him holding a cooked piece of beef.
9569320	9574200	And fortunately it looked like a pixelated penis, um, on the screen.
9575320	9577000	How did that get by the Nintendo?
9578440	9578920	I don't know.
9578920	9579560	Whatever.
9579560	9580360	It's pretty funny.
9581000	9583160	So they said, Steve, you need to put your meat away.
9584040	9584440	Yes.
9584440	9587160	So you're excited you want, but you need to put your meat away.
9587160	9589160	He's not holding his meat anymore.
9589160	9590280	Um, so that's funny.
9591080	9591800	Okay.
9591800	9597480	So, um, if we still, you know, back to, you know, kind of a throwback to when we were
9597480	9604600	talking about earlier, how, um, certain, certain people at certain game companies feel that,
9604600	9610360	you know, gamers should pay to stream their games because they aren't making enough money.
9610920	9617960	Well, I mean, as if it's any surprise with sports games, it's gotten ridiculous with
9617960	9622680	the amount of like, um, stuff that they're throwing in people's faces.
9622680	9629640	So UFC tried this a while back EA, um, putting, you know, little ad bumpers in there as well.
9629640	9632600	Well, NBA 2k now has unskippable ads.
9633160	9638520	That load before the, um, the game street fighter, street fighter five houses too.
9638520	9640680	Cause it was a PlayStation plus game last month.
9640680	9644600	And when you, before you get set up for a match, it's like present this match presented by,
9644600	9648040	and like every single one I was getting was like the Capcom cup or whatever it was
9648040	9648840	going on at the time.
9648920	9653000	So it was a, it was a local ad, but it was, I kind of rolled my eyes.
9653000	9653560	Yeah.
9653560	9659400	So, so they have an unskippable ads for stuff like, you know, uh, converse snowfall,
9659400	9662440	Oculus quest, um, all sorts of things.
9663160	9664520	It's ridiculous.
9664520	9668520	Also considering I'm kind of curious to see what's going to happen with this one.
9670120	9671160	I mean, cause I, I get it.
9671160	9675400	They're doing it while it's loading, but you know, these next gen systems are going to load
9675400	9676600	much, much, much faster.
9677160	9680760	Are they just going to artificially increase that load time in order to do these ads?
9682440	9683720	It's it's garbage.
9683720	9689640	Anyways, NBA 2k has basically put out a tweet, uh, seeing as many of you are aware in the
9689640	9693960	recent years, ads have been integrated into 2k TV segments.
9693960	9699560	Yesterday's 2k TV ad placement impacted our players experience in a way we didn't intend
9699560	9700440	bullshit.
9700440	9705720	Um, as these ads are not meant to run as part of the pregame introduction, this will be
9705720	9707400	fixed in future episodes.
9707400	9709560	Thank you for your continued feedback.
9709560	9711400	I don't buy that one bit.
9711400	9716440	I think they just, they make the excuse, well, we didn't intend for this to happen, but.
9717640	9718440	Well, it did.
9719400	9720920	They're like, oops, we made a mistake.
9720920	9721720	Whoopsie doops.
9721720	9724200	You know, they're just waiting to see what the reaction is going to be.
9725240	9731000	I'm telling you these guys that are trying to fleece everybody for, you know, microtransactions
9731080	9735240	and season passes and all of this nonsense each year.
9735240	9741480	Um, you know, not, well, I don't know so much about 2k, but like EA doesn't really even
9741480	9745960	update their game very much year to year taking away features, selling those back to you or
9745960	9747000	whatever the case may be.
9747640	9753640	Um, and there's still demanding more money on top of all this, like, you know, endorsements
9753640	9760120	with different, you know, food brands or, you know, with shoes or advertisements, you
9760120	9764920	know, throwing stuff, they're making money, like tons of money off of this stuff.
9764920	9766520	You can't tell me that.
9766520	9772280	And then they're going to, you know, not them particularly, but I could easily see them
9772280	9773160	jumping on board.
9773160	9778200	If some AAA studio decided to start charging people to stream their games, get right on
9778200	9780040	board with that because, Hey, that's money.
9780040	9781640	Why not have all the money?
9781640	9783880	Um, I could easily see them doing that.
9783880	9788120	I mean, 2k and EA, I mean, it's just bad.
9791000	9791800	All right.
9791800	9793320	What, uh, there's another thing with EA, right?
9794040	9794440	Yes.
9794440	9801080	So EA talking about, um, you know, they're incredible, uh, loot box systems that they
9801080	9803000	have with Madden and whatnot.
9803800	9810120	Apparently they're the case that's pending in Canada, a class action lawsuit against
9810120	9817000	EA, um, regarding their loot boxes that violates the country's criminal code, basically accusing
9817000	9820360	them of running unlicensed illegal gambling systems.
9821160	9827160	And they're seeking damages for unjust enrichment arising from the defendant's operation of
9827160	9832280	illegal gambling systems through the sale of so-called loot boxes in popular video games.
9832280	9836200	Well, you know, this, this is serious shit when Canadians are not going to be polite
9836200	9837000	about it anymore.
9837000	9839480	This is the legal part of it.
9840520	9842840	You don't know what will be in those loot boxes.
9842840	9846120	And I'm not sure if they necessarily upfront with the odds on that stuff.
9846120	9852600	They may be, but like, it's still, yeah, it's, it's still something that of course
9852600	9857320	that several countries have brought up as far as saying that this type of stuff would
9857320	9858520	fall under gambling laws.
9858520	9859880	So I'm surprised that they haven't.
9859880	9865960	In other words, the PlayStation five and Xbox series X launches may be a good time to get
9865960	9867000	rid of this crap.
9867000	9873640	Although we know they're not, we know, but, um, maybe Canada's not so subtly suggesting
9873640	9875160	now is a good time to change their habits.
9876200	9876600	Yeah.
9876600	9881320	Um, so yeah, I don't know.
9881320	9882440	I don't think they're going to change.
9883960	9885960	Not until somebody steps in.
9885960	9886280	Yeah.
9886280	9888760	Until someone steps in to make them accountable.
9888760	9893000	Here I am yet again this year sitting here saying Canada, save us all.
9893720	9894120	All right.
9895960	9896360	All right.
9896920	9897800	Moving on.
9897800	9898200	Let's talk.
9898200	9902040	I seriously love Canada and all my Canadian friends hearts.
9902040	9902840	All right.
9902840	9903400	Moving on.
9904200	9905400	Let's talk about.
9905400	9907000	Oh, you know who else needs money?
9907000	9907560	Atari.
9908680	9911320	Cause I don't think that computer is going to sell.
9911320	9913880	Like I couldn't even tell you, is it the Atari VCS?
9913880	9914760	Is that what they're calling it?
9915960	9918040	I, this is a problem.
9918600	9919960	Number one, this is a problem.
9919960	9924600	I could tell you more about that Intellivision Amico, uh, than I could Atari system.
9924600	9926120	And that's no shade against Intellivision.
9926120	9926920	I'm not here to do that.
9926920	9927960	It's so expensive.
9927960	9929880	Their system is so expensive.
9929880	9935000	I could tell you anything about that new Atari, except that $350 for the Atari thing.
9935160	9939240	I think it's a real computer slash it plays Atari stuff slash.
9939240	9942920	At one point I heard and stream was on it, but then I'm not hearing that anymore.
9942920	9945320	Um, so it's a computer.
9945320	9945880	Like it's.
9947960	9951160	So anyway, let's talk about something besides that's not that.
9951160	9951800	Okay.
9951800	9959400	This, this, I understand, uh, Atari teaming up with Eunice, U N I S U N I S, uh, to release
9959400	9962600	a Pong arcade machine for your home.
9962920	9967080	This is a little different than the, uh, table sized ones that are a little more akin to
9967080	9969400	like an arcade one, a one up bar top.
9969400	9971400	This is a Pong mini.
9971400	9977000	So it's a 7.9 inch LCD string screen and two dial controls that you can play.
9977640	9981640	Pong with 10, excuse me, 10 different difficulty settings.
9981640	9985160	Uh, there's no battery built in, so it runs on AA batteries.
9985880	9990840	But, um, it's Pong, so I don't expect it's going to use a lot of power, uh, but you can
9990840	9993640	also power it with a USB cable and adapters.
9993640	9996120	So if you don't want to use batteries, you're trying to be eco-friendly, whatever, you do
9996120	9997880	have that option as well.
9997880	10000920	Uh, you can get it this holiday season.
10000920	10005480	Uh, Arcade One Up will actually be distributing this here in North America because U N I S
10005480	10006840	is a Chinese company.
10006840	10009880	Uh, no pricing details yet or pre-order details yet.
10009880	10010200	Yeah.
10010200	10013880	I noticed, by the way, I was at Target today and I didn't even realize this was a market
10013880	10019000	Arcade One Up was getting into, but they are beyond just the, uh, replica arcade machines
10019000	10019640	stuff now.
10019640	10024440	Those little controllers that have games in them, Arcade One Up is doing those now.
10025080	10026760	Yeah, they're garbage.
10026760	10027240	Are they?
10027240	10031960	I saw a Mega Man one, which I don't know why I'd get that because it exists on the switch
10031960	10037160	and there was a Namco Pac-Man slash Mappy slash, uh, those games won.
10037800	10039240	So here's the fun thing about those.
10039240	10043960	So they, they are kind of garbage based on the reviews that I've watched for them.
10043960	10046760	Um, it's mainly that the controller is kind of garbage.
10046760	10051400	The games themselves emulate just fine, but you can actually, they're emulation boxes.
10051400	10057080	You can load other games onto them, um, using an SD card, which is kind of cool.
10057080	10061640	And then with that, you can also like hook up USB controllers to it and stuff.
10061640	10066360	So it might be worth it for that, but like the, the included controller is not good.
10067400	10067880	Okay.
10067880	10068680	Okay.
10068680	10069240	Interesting.
10069880	10070120	All right.
10070120	10071080	Well, I just thought it was interesting.
10071080	10072760	They were getting into that line of business anyway.
10072760	10073000	Sorry.
10073080	10076120	The story was actually supposed to be about, um, Atari and the mini Pong,
10076120	10080200	but it just shows to go arcade one up is really like, they're pre-
10080200	10083960	I feel like two years ago, I didn't know a thing about these guys.
10083960	10087640	And then as much as a year ago, it was like, oh, I'll never be able to afford that shit.
10087640	10089480	Anyway, that's a company for rich people.
10089480	10092440	And now I feel like they're showing up everywhere, you know?
10092440	10093800	So this is very interesting.
10094440	10099400	So, um, but you know, uh, you know, we're, we're, we're the 40 somethings now.
10099400	10101880	I know you're not 40 yet, Loki, but we're, we're-
10101880	10102440	I am.
10102440	10103320	Oh no, that's right.
10103320	10104760	You just hit that on September.
10104760	10105480	Yes, that's right.
10105480	10106840	So, so brand new.
10106840	10109320	I wanted, I wanted to-
10109320	10109560	Okay.
10110600	10113160	So I'm looking at the Atari VCS page.
10113160	10113480	Okay.
10113480	10115320	And I can't help but laugh.
10115320	10117560	It's just ridiculous stuff that's on here.
10117560	10119560	So I saw this thing at the very bottom.
10119560	10123480	It said, uh, talking about like the features of their console, you know, it's like Ryzen
10123480	10127560	processor, wifi, Bluetooth, Atari speaker hat compatible.
10127560	10129640	I'm like, what the hell is that?
10130280	10133640	So apparently they've released a hat that has speakers in it.
10134440	10139080	You can listen to music or something.
10139080	10142200	It's high fidelity microphones and stuff.
10142840	10145400	They're in all sorts of businesses, that Atari.
10146760	10148440	Hey, whatever happened to the hotels?
10148440	10149400	I mean, pandemic.
10149400	10150680	Those are still coming.
10150680	10151240	Are they really?
10151240	10153960	Cause that was the most interesting thing I'd heard.
10153960	10156920	It like, as far as like using their brand in a crazy way.
10156920	10159400	I thought those hotels sounded fascinating.
10159560	10166920	So, um, I'm curious if it, I would, I would stay at one just to see, um, and see if it's,
10166920	10170920	you know, what, or if it's kind of like, you know, garbage, but I'd be curious.
10170920	10172120	I'd be super curious.
10172120	10172600	Super curious.
10173320	10177320	DJ Roma S says the speaker hat has been around for a couple of years.
10177320	10180440	Bobby Blackwell says, I can't wait to go and stay at hotels again.
10180440	10185080	Technically you can, but I, I understand the point you're trying to make and I get it.
10185560	10190680	Uh, I can't, I can't wait to get on a plane again and I could if I wanted to, but now,
10191240	10195160	now they're going to be, uh, selling the middle seats apparently on my favorite airlines.
10195160	10197720	So, uh, I don't know how I feel about that.
10197720	10199720	So I'm not in a rush to go anywhere anytime soon.
10200120	10206040	Um, especially it's going to be, it's going to be a good several weeks after Thanksgiving
10206040	10209080	and Christmas, because those holidays really worry me.
10209720	10214760	Uh, I just don't think people are going to give a shit and, uh, we'll see.
10214840	10215240	We'll see.
10215800	10219400	Um, DJ Roma S says the speaker hat's been around for a while.
10219400	10220040	Well, that's cool.
10221160	10221480	All right.
10222040	10225720	So this is the part where we would get to the listener round table and open up to our
10225720	10230040	chat room for your questions, uh, or comments on anything we've talked about tonight or
10230040	10233080	anything we haven't talked about yet that you hoped we would talk about.
10233640	10237560	I would also typically do the mailbag at this time because you can send your emails every
10237560	10242120	week to participate at orangelandradio.com and we read our favorite emails here on the
10242120	10242360	air.
10242360	10244600	But, um, there's an empty mailbag this week.
10244600	10245560	We didn't get anything.
10245560	10251160	We've had a, we've had a good run of, uh, mailbag weeks and dark soccer is not even
10251160	10252920	here for me to talk about drag race with.
10252920	10253720	So now what do I do?
10253720	10255240	Loki watching drag race Holland?
10256280	10257560	No, damn it.
10257560	10257960	All right.
10258600	10259080	Uh, okay.
10260040	10260360	Good.
10260360	10260680	Excellent.
10261240	10264440	The chat room here with the save when in doubt, bring it back to food.
10265080	10265800	SSU 100.
10265800	10267960	Matt says rank your top three Halloween.
10267960	10270920	Is it from a distance?
10270920	10276360	I thought it said candles and I'm like, um, let's see bed bath and beyond.
10276360	10277480	No, I know it's candies.
10277480	10277880	All right.
10277880	10279960	Rank your top three Halloween candies.
10281800	10284280	I don't really eat a lot of candy.
10284280	10286600	So like it's always tootsie rolls.
10286600	10292280	Um, so that's what I, I've been just buying that stuff, you know, from the store and getting
10292280	10294040	that, um, gummy bears.
10294600	10300920	Um, and I don't know, I don't really like a lot of the chocolate stuff that they give
10300920	10301320	out.
10301320	10306360	Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.
10307160	10312040	Um, I'm with hot pocketry peanut butter cups, probably very high on the list near the top.
10312040	10315720	Um, I would say for Halloween candies, I'm trying to think of things that you usually
10315720	10317960	see around Halloween that you don't see other times a year.
10317960	10322680	I would actually, I would actually, you know, I never got those in trick or treat bags.
10322680	10324440	Uh, and it's not actually my favorite.
10324440	10326200	I like it, but it's not my favorite.
10326200	10331480	Um, I would say, um, the Wonka candies, I see more this time of year than any other
10331480	10331800	time.
10331800	10336200	And so specifically like bottle caps, I've always really liked, you know, those, the,
10336200	10337720	the soda flavored candy.
10338520	10341560	I'm not as big on nerds, uh, and runts.
10341560	10343320	I only like the banana ones.
10343320	10352440	So, um, so I would say, uh, yeah, uh, uh, bottle caps, um, and, uh, vanilla tootsie
10352440	10355720	rolls specifically, or any fruit flavored one.
10355720	10356360	I like those as well.
10356360	10356600	Yeah.
10356600	10358280	I don't know if I like those.
10358280	10359080	I don't know.
10359080	10360200	We have a bunch.
10360200	10360760	I like that.
10360760	10363720	I just buy like a five pound bag or a bite, like not five pound bag.
10363720	10365400	It's like a $5 bag of that stuff.
10365400	10367000	And it lasts for months.
10367800	10368040	Yeah.
10368040	10370840	And black and Pat says Kit Kats, Snickers and nerds.
10370840	10371960	I would agree with Kit Kats.
10372200	10377880	I always like, like if I'm just like at the convenience store and I'm like, I want candy.
10377880	10383880	I usually will buy a Kit Kat bar or a Twix is the other one that I really like.
10383880	10387480	Cause now all these companies are doing their crazy flavors.
10387480	10391720	You know, ever since Oreo started doing it now, I feel like every sweets company is doing
10391720	10393320	their crazy flavors.
10393320	10397880	I guess that was the thing they had to do because of the dieting that everybody's doing.
10398600	10400120	Made people start cutting that stuff out.
10400120	10402520	So they tried to do crazy flavors to bring people back.
10403080	10405960	But like Twix has like a peanut butter Twix.
10405960	10406760	That's really good.
10406760	10407880	And there's a cookies and cream one.
10407880	10408920	That's pretty good too.
10408920	10416760	So I'm liking the crazy flavor and Kit Kat is finally, finally doing some crazy flavors
10416760	10418200	like they've had in Japan for forever.
10418200	10420680	Like there were some apple pie Kit Kats I had not long ago.
10420680	10421160	Really good.
10422600	10424680	So those would be my answers.
10424680	10425320	Good question.
10426040	10428680	While we wait to see if any other candy or candies, sure.
10428680	10429480	I'll take candy.
10429480	10433000	If we wait to see if any other questions come in, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute
10433000	10433500	stories?
10434280	10435080	I don't.
10435080	10437000	I was like, I feel like we hit everything.
10438520	10440600	It wasn't really that big of a week.
10440600	10442520	All things considered, there were just some big moments.
10443320	10447960	I was gonna say Epic games has got the, uh, the, the, I know that they've got the, the
10447960	10449640	Ghostbusters remaster.
10449640	10452360	That's going to be free next week, which is pretty cool.
10452360	10453640	I want to check that out.
10453720	10459880	And then, um, there was also, what's the other one that they had for next week as well.
10460520	10463880	Uh, Blair, which is going to be free next week as well.
10465160	10466520	So check those out.
10467320	10471240	Um, as Joe and Matt says, I used to like butter fingers, but as I got older, I'm not a fan
10471240	10471880	of them.
10471880	10475080	I still like them, but what I really liked, I don't think they sell them anymore.
10475080	10479240	The butter fingers, BBs, the little, they were like tiny little, do you guys know what
10479240	10479740	I'm talking about?
10480700	10485580	They were like little, I think like a whopper, but it was filled with butter finger instead
10485580	10486080	the malts.
10486780	10488300	Yeah, I like those.
10489180	10494060	Um, Bobby Black Wolf says favorite quote from my 1982 history book.
10494060	10495020	Didn't read it.
10495020	10499420	Uh, no one special 77 says favorite vog host.
10500620	10504060	Oh, that's, that's a question that's asking for trouble.
10504060	10511740	Um, I'm going to say captain spike because I really want game buoy to come back regularly
10511740	10512540	and slide kick.
10512540	10513100	It's a tie.
10515580	10517980	Um, let's see.
10518540	10519100	That's it.
10519100	10520460	I don't think we have any other questions.
10521260	10522940	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says grandpa.
10523740	10525660	Yeah, we want starboard power coupling back too.
10526300	10527420	So, all right.
10527420	10528620	Anyway, I guess that's it.
10528620	10530300	We're not really getting a lot of other questions.
10530300	10532060	We've run a pretty long show tonight.
10532060	10535020	We've had a very busy show, lots of things to discuss, so I think we're good to start
10535020	10535900	to wrap up.
10535900	10538540	I want to thank you guys for coming out and supporting the show.
10538540	10542860	Uh, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio and supporting us every week
10542860	10543820	the way you always do.
10544460	10547900	If you, uh, enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend
10547900	10549340	or five about the show.
10549340	10550860	Um, spread the word.
10550860	10554860	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only put the voices that are here
10554860	10556620	on the air if they're here.
10556620	10563020	So, um, uh, tell a friend, uh, auto hosts on twitch go an awful long way, which by the
10563020	10566300	way, um, if you didn't know, if you're not listening live, if you're listening on the
10566300	10571580	podcast feed, uh, after we do the credits, we'll come back and acknowledge everybody
10571580	10573900	who did the donations and the following.
10573900	10578940	I have not been able to read hosts for the longest time because twitch got rid of that
10578940	10579580	feature.
10579580	10580300	Well, guess what?
10580300	10583660	Y'all twitch brought it back, but guess what?
10583660	10592300	What y'all you have to be logged in as the account and not one of the deputies essentially
10592300	10593740	in order to see the list.
10593740	10597820	So I'm logged in as Rob Roberts, my personal account, which is deputized to do whatever
10597820	10600940	I need to do on bog network except see the damn hosting list.
10600940	10605980	So I'm hoping we'll get that fixed unless, um, Bobby's going to copy paste for me.
10605980	10609260	I don't know, but in future weeks I will be able to read the hosts again.
10609260	10613660	So the hosting and even if it's an auto hosting, that stuff goes an awful long way.
10613660	10614220	So thank you.
10614220	10614620	Thank you.
10614620	10616620	Bobby says there's 30 hosts.
10617260	10618540	That's amazing.
10618540	10619660	Thanks you guys.
10619660	10620540	You guys rule.
10621180	10623580	That's, that's way more than we had in December.
10623580	10625500	It was like 11 when we first started.
10625500	10625980	That's great.
10625980	10626860	Thanks you guys.
10626860	10628540	So auto hosts going off a long way.
10628540	10628860	Thank you.
10628860	10629500	Thank you.
10629500	10630620	And then a five star review.
10630620	10634940	If you use iTunes or any place that accepts reviews, we really appreciate those as well.
10635500	10636300	Um, yeah.
10636300	10636780	Word of mouth.
10636780	10637740	That's what we got.
10637740	10642220	So let's get to final thoughts, uh, and then wrap it all up.
10642220	10643580	So I guess Loki will start with you.
10643580	10644540	What's your final thought tonight?
10645580	10651500	Final thought is I hope I get this, uh, code bit that I'm working on to actually work correctly.
10651500	10654620	It's it really should be much simpler than what I'm doing.
10654620	10659500	There should be no reason why it's not working, but of course it's not working for reasons.
10660780	10661180	All right.
10662140	10667420	And, uh, my final thought tonight is vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.
10667420	10668860	And, um, I'm excited.
10668860	10672620	I'm glad to hear there's many of you out there who have also been shy to play among us.
10672620	10675740	So I'm looking forward to our first VOG among us night.
10675740	10676780	I think there'll be a lot of fun.
10676780	10678700	I don't know when it will be, but I'm I'm we'll work on that.
10678700	10679260	So cool.
10679820	10681100	Um, that's it.
10681100	10683660	We're going to wrap up and, uh, roll the credits.
10683660	10686460	Thanks you guys for being here and checking out the show with this week.
10686460	10687900	Have a happy Halloween.
10687900	10689660	Have a safe Halloween.
10689660	10691500	Please remember COVID-19.
10691500	10693420	We just like Shane was on at the beginning of the show.
10693420	10695260	Thank you, Shane, for being here at the start of the show.
10695260	10700940	Even though he has COVID he came here on the show virtually, of course, uh, tonight to talk to us.
10700940	10704380	Um, and I hope that also kind of brings it home.
10704380	10706140	Like COVID is real.
10706140	10712220	It's out there and thank heavens, uh, Shane is, is relatively healthy through it.
10712220	10715660	And, uh, not, uh, one of the more serious cases.
10715660	10721020	Um, so I say that all because have a happy Halloween, but don't, don't be reckless.
10721660	10726140	Science does not care about your opinions, uh, political or otherwise.
10726140	10729180	So just because you wish COVID away isn't going to make it the case.
10729180	10731500	Uh, so please keep that in mind.
10731500	10735340	I'm not saying don't like leave your house, but just please take precautions.
10735340	10735820	Okay.
10735820	10736540	Take precautions.
10736540	10736940	Thank you.
10736940	10737420	Oh my God.
10737420	10739500	Bobby miscounted and said it was 40 hosts.
10739500	10740140	That's amazing.
10740140	10740860	Thank you.
10740860	10741260	All right.
10741260	10741580	That's it.
10741580	10743180	We really are going to roll credits now.
10743180	10743500	Thank you.
10743500	10743900	Thank you.
