27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,120
with there not being a show were you able to get a little extra time in to work on your game?

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,080
Um yeah I think I did work a little bit on it um so I did some coding I actually have time off

29
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,320
later this week to work on it more as well. I was uh working with the um person that's doing my

30
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,240
music and audio so they're done finally um with getting me everything that I needed for that

31
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,680
and then I've been going through and adjusting some of the sound effects to make things how I

32
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,800
like. I actually had two different people working on music and sound so I'm just taking the best

33
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,680
parts of both of them and tweaking my own stuff to do that. All right well I look forward to seeing

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,240

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,560
little bit so if you're hearing some artifacting or something sorry about that it's just things

42

52
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,360
and you know the fact that we are staying a lot more at home we're not getting out in a lot of

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,080
social settings as much as we used to the fact of the matter is that is starting to take its toll

54
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,760
on some of our mental health right that's no secret I'm sure a lot of us are dealing with

55
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,360
that sort of situation well now you E you kind of are interesting because you you kind of have

56
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,840
some real estate in this intersection between mental health awareness and video games right

57
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,560
so tell us a little bit about some of your projects that you work with okay so right now

58
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,720
my main thing that I'm working on is I have my own podcast called am I mental uh we are a live

59
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,120
podcast um that goes every Thursday at six um and we go through Sprecher so we actually have a chat

60
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,080
room so we can actually interact with our listeners right then in there nice and we do you know and

61
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,720
it's a it's a weekly podcast where people talk about their issues dealing with mental health

62
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,400
and each week's a different story from a different person as a matter of fact

63
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,400
your very own Jamie here is going to be a guest on my podcast uh not this Thursday but the Thursday

64
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,480
after okay uh great and I and as far as gaming goes I mean I've been a gamer since the old Atari

65
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:18,520
2600 so yeah yeah and definitely um I'm in a lot of different little groups right now um the big

66
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,720
thing right now that we've been playing is a lot of among us um it's highly social very fun at

67
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,920
brain exercises and we actually I have a group chat that I put together uh I didn't put together

68
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,160
myself but I've been adding to it a lot but we have a group chat where it's just for among us

69
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,920
we don't talk politics we don't talk pandemics we just share memes and play among us and other

70
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:49,560
games and it's been really helpful you know especially I mean me myself right now I'm a

71
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,560
stay-at-home dad you know I've been unemployed for over a year now and my podcast has been going

72
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,560
since March so we're coming up on our one year anniversary you know in a few more months um

73
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,880
but that's all I really have going on that you know taking care of the kids making sure my

74
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,560
daughter gets her schoolwork done on time and all that jazz and also being in California with all

75
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,240
the smoke that's been in the air you know it just it really weighs down on someone well now being a

76
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,840
full-time parent is no short career so especially in this day and age where all the kids are going

77
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,680
to school virtually and stuff so I I'm sure you keep very busy between that and your different

78
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,240
projects as well um I think I remember you mentioning that you also had like a Facebook

79
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,680
group that was kind of at this intersection of mental health and video games yeah there's a group

80
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,960
that I got brought into by another by one of our listeners actually it's uh called Just Pause

81
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:52,520
um and it's just for gamers with mental health issues and discussing you know challenges and

82
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,400
helping each other brainstorm solutions like hey you know it sounds like maybe you have seasonal

83
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,200
affective disorder like like I do you know maybe when the sun comes out go take a walk you know and

84
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,040
even if you don't want to it will help you know things like that you know we're all trying to help

85
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,680
each other out and we're also sharing game reviews about what's coming up and all that too

86
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,920
um let me ask you some questions kind of diving into this topic about like

87
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,040
like video games and mental health well first like generally you know obviously this pandemic

88
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,040
was something that you know in the beginning I think some of us thought oh it'll be a couple

89
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,440
weeks and then they'll they'll you know figure out how to get it out of the U.S. and it'll be gone

90
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,920
it'll be a done deal and here we are going on month number I lost count I think we're on like

91
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,400
month seven of this whole thing going on and it still doesn't yeah now it's just kind of one of

92
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,520
those well we're just hedging our bets hoping a vaccine will be here real soon so I mean this is

93
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,120
continuing to go on and on and on so what are some ways let's talk like generally speaking that that

94
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,360
like people listening to this show what are some ways that people can like help their mental health

95
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,000
and make sure that they're not like spiraling I guess for lack of a better word because of

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,560
everything that's going on in the world well one of the biggest things then it's a it's a

97
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,120
reoccurring theme on the show like every week it pops up almost almost every week is that you know

98
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,520
you are not alone that even if you feel that you're going to inconvenience someone by reaching out

99
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,600
reach out you're not inconveniencing anyone the real problem with depression is that it gives you

100
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:33,000
a lesser self-image and it causes you to basically maximize and minimize things it maximizes

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,040
you maximize and build mountains out of other people's everything and you minimize and flatten

102
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,920
out everything that is you a great example is like you're in group therapy if you ever have to

103
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,840
go to group therapy or if you've ever gone you're going to sit around and if you're depressed you're

104
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,480
going to hear all these people telling their stories and you're going to think wow every

105
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,040
single person has it worse than me and you're going to feel like an imposter then when it's

106
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,000
your turn to share and you share you're going to look around and see everybody's looking at you

107
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,800
going wow that person has it really bad I'm an imposter so it's really important to just reach

108
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,320
out you know people care even if you think they don't they do as a matter of fact two episodes

109
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,560
ago was really really heavily about that we actually had someone who did a ted talk who

110
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,800
they had a student commit suicide when they were their first year teaching

111
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,680
two years later they had another one attempt suicide she found out about it wrote a letter

112
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,320
to that student that student started crying going i didn't know anybody cared so she she sat down

113
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,240
for two months and wrote 130 handwritten letters took a picture of it put it up on facebook sharing

114
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,920
this is what i'm doing she didn't think it was anything special it's just this is what i have to

115
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,840
do two days later she's getting calls from bbc she's getting calls from good morning america

116
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,280
washington post new york times usa today everybody wants her on the show or wants an interview for

117
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:00,200
their news articles wow and it all boils down to the same thing you always feel like you're

118
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,480
less than you actually are just reach out it's interesting you kind of bring up that feeling

119
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,720
of being an imposter because lord knows i have felt that imposter syndrome right it's kind of

120
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,160
like another way of framing it i have felt that i can't tell you how many times doing some of these

121
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,560
things i've been able to do because of the success i guess of this podcast things like being a guest

122
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,800
on dragon con panels and getting to sometimes moderate these celebrity panels i have absolutely

123
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:35,080
had those moments of oh my god at some point these folks are gonna find out i am not ninja i am not

124
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,400
you know one of these youtubers that have like a million views they're gonna be like what the hell

125
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,760
is this guy doing on stage get him off of there like that that imposter syndrome stuff that can

126
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,960
really mess with your head it really can oh absolutely and i bet you when you were done

127
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,400
people came up to compliment you afterwards on this job you did yes yeah not i i try to be humble

128
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,680
but yes and that that kind of helped with um you know some of those other things that i was feeling

129
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,480
is i was like oh thank gosh for that validation maybe i'll be able to sneak through and do this

130
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,920
again another year right and that's another thing that we it's really big and with our even our chat

131
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:17,400
group our tech group absolutely amazing some of the most fanatically loyal fans i've ever seen

132
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,600
and i mean i've done professional performances where i was performing 400 crowds of 10 000 people

133
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,960
and i've never seen this um where it comes down to it doesn't matter what your story is your story

134
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,880
is yours your struggle is yours it is valid just because you feel someone else has it worse than

135
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,560
you doesn't mean that others aren't going to look and think that you have it worse than them and

136
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:46,120
even that doesn't matter it's your struggle um and the validation it helps a lot to get through that

137
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,000
yeah absolutely absolutely and i think uh knowing that like your concerns in your situation is valid

138
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,160
is is huge no matter what the scope or size of it is like you know like you you mentioned before

139
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,200
when it comes to this pandemic situation everything we are all going through this

140
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,200
thing together you know so there's there's a lot of feelings that we're all feeling

141
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,720
right and as politicized as it has become let's face it a virus is not a politician a virus is a

142
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,600
virus right and it's hitting all of us right some harder than others but still in the end

143
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,840
we're all going through it absolutely jamie you were trying to add something yeah i was i was

144
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,200
saying that um earlier in the year when i was still sick with pneumonia and playing a lot of

145
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:37,560
animal crossing um after after the fact because i mean my my dad died um my mother-in-law died um

146
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,280
you know a lot of people were grieving and couldn't go more than their family members we

147
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,840
were talking about how people are using video games as their coping mechanism i have an entire

148
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,800
cemetery in my cute little animal crossing village and each grave there represents somebody or

149
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,840
something close to me and and my friend built like a memorial garden to her mother who died a year ago

150
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,640
in animal crossing and you know there were funerals in final fantasy 14 you know they

151
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,920
had that whole procession walk um you know and i think that i i think well and also the creators

152
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,040
in wow are really good about putting up memorials to very notable people that have been lost you

153
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,360
know and so i think that there's a major juxtaposition with those of us who work or

154
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,560
work or live in gaming culture with our different ways of dealing with our own mental health

155
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:36,600
that aren't necessarily something that your average psychologist say would look into although

156
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,720
there are some studies about it i'm seeing more studies on it and especially for me being um

157
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,280
neurodivergent you know my way of coping with something is going to be completely different

158
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,280
than how someone else copes with it you know i feel like an imposter every day because

159
00:14:51,080 --> 00:15:00,200
i have to mask my different neurobiology from all humans of the earth there is a site that

160
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,880
summed up what being autistic is like for me it's called anotherplanet.org

161
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:12,040
because i feel like i'm from another planet sometimes and all of all of these human people are

162
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,640
are weird now i have a place to go to learn more i have to see if it's still running it's been a

163
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,280
while all right but um but yeah but all of the you know all of these aspects of how we deal with

164
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,720
everything the hobbies that we do the things that we enjoy all of that wraps into our personal

165
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,040
coping mechanisms but yeah yeah definitely um now e you can appreciate this since you were talking

166
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,240
about the among us memes earlier because of course we do tape live every sunday night on twitch so oh

167
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,320
we do have our chat room going at twitch.tv slash vog network and i am going to be a little bit

168
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,600
piggy choosy in the comments i read tonight because some people are being very transparent

169
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,080
with their mental health and i don't want to necessarily read people that are like i'm dealing

170
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,600
with this i'm dealing with that because i don't know if you really want that on the podcast um so

171
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,840
i am going to kind of refrain a little bit from reading every comment um but i think you can

172
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:06,520
appreciate these comments e um some people saying uh act deaf says i'm not an imposter you're all

173
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,760
sus to me dg says i think act deaf is acting hella sus bobby black hole says why did you just come

174
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:21,960
climb out of the vent love it i absolutely love it um yeah and act deaf reminded me that that's a

175
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:30,600
a tumblr account so it probably still is up nice yeah um yeah i'm not that's chatted off um when i

176
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,160
when i'm running my podcast i have the co-host doing most of the reading of the chat room and

177
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,080
moderating but i'll still read it because i mean we don't have a ton of people in there it's easy

178
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,160
enough to keep up with but it's i have to pay more attention to the guest and try to pay less

179
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,080
attention to the chat yeah we we've gotten crazy multitasking skills over the 18 years doing this

180
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,040
show so that has been an integral part of the show since we started if i take a weird angle it's

181
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,200
probably because i'm looking over at the chat room because i'm i'm situated weird for the four shot

182
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:07,080
tonight that's all right and i'm usually doing the in-person typing chat so yeah nice yeah it's

183
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,080
like when we do our show um we do video between each other but only for each other it's only audio

184
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,120
otherwise um and like the guests and the co-host will see me all of a sudden just like get this

185
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,600
grin and thank goodness for my 26 years of uh phone support and it experienced where i don't

186
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,440
just burst out laughing i've come close with some of the comments in chat like someone's talking

187
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,560
about you know i lost my mom i've had this big drinking problem and then something funny pops

188
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:43,480
up in chat i'm like trying so hard not to laugh i bet i bet because that's part of it is the live

189
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,760
aspect of it so it's been kind of fun oh yeah i love the live aspect of it getting back to the

190
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,240
mental health and using video games to kind of deal with that you know um dark sakura brought

191
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,240
up uh that she had the memorials um that she had in her animal crossing game and uh interestingly

192
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,520
enough that is also something i ended up doing you know i lost my mom in 2017 and that you know

193
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,360
that's not something you really ever get over and when there was the mom character in animal

194
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,720
crossing that started sending all the gifts i kind of felt like i needed a place to put those gifts

195
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,600
so i set up a memorial kind of as well so i'm kind of like animal crossing is a very interesting

196
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,040
sort of game and i'm not sure how well versed you are in animal crossing but you know it's it's

197
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,520
interesting because of the fact that it came out right when this pandemic happened that you have

198
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,760
so many people that have been using this game to kind of deal with what's going on i i i don't know

199
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,760
e i saw kind of shaking your head maybe it's not a game you're really playing but have you heard

200
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,400
much about how people are using this to cope or oh yeah i've heard a lot about how people are using

201
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,640
it to cope um i don't have a switch i i just have my phone and i have a mac so i sure and the mobile

202
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:01,240
version of animal crossing no not the same no i gave up on that yeah it's like it's not that i

203
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,600
don't want to i just don't have the means right now to to play it um but i've seen the uh of

204
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,760
course i watched some video play of it and all that it looks like a great game but yeah uh the

205
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,240
ability to go ahead and do that a little bit of free world crafting and being able to do those

206
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,800
memorials i've seen a lot of people talking about how for them that's what helped them with the

207
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:29,160
whole grieving process and um grieving comes up a lot on our show and do you mind if i plug a book

208
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,240
it's not mine no go ahead but it's a great one it's called the grief recovery handbook

209
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,280
that one has helped me we talk a lot of we talk about we plug a lot of video games that aren't

210
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:45,320
ours so a book is okay too no fair enough but yeah the grief recovery handbook it changed my life

211
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,200
it helped me find methods and avenues of grieving that were much more healthy

212
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,200
than just sitting and dwelling and hoping it goes away it doesn't you you have to do something

213
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,640
and that's where like the angle crossing stuff really helps if i may also throw this in there's

214
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:09,720
a good ted talk and i think it's by brené brown about uh um closure and how it's truly not a

215
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,880
healthy concept that there's never closure you can never separate yourself from your grief or

216
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,720
your death because you also separate yourself from the good memories that come with it as well

217
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,040
you know there's there's no moving on there's an american culture in general has separated itself

218
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,600
from death and grieving that you know we used to host you know the bodies in our homes

219
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,720
families would wash them prior to you know that we've separated ourselves so much from that

220
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,280
process that i think that that's part of why we have trouble grieving anyway but and so

221
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,920
for us to be able to bring that aspect back into our lives even in a virtual environment you know

222
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,160
in animal crossing we have a grave in the town that is supposed to be our virtual home you know

223
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,520
and it's there and you can visit it and you can see it it's not removed out in another town that

224
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,920
you have to drive to go oh i gotta go to the you know cemetery me i used to have picnics in

225
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,760
cemeteries when i lived in alabama um i used to go i used to take my cousins out snipe hunting

226
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,520
but but anyway it's i feel like our video games like this and this like this new grieving

227
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,840
process that's sort of reincorporating something that we've lost as a culture

228
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,760
back into our our daily lives we may not have a corpse in our house i mean

229
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:44,360
but we have like that memento mori exactly our own reminder of our own mortality as we remember

230
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,320
those who have left us and it's it's it's interesting you do to kind of talk about

231
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,640
like the grieving process and how video games might be kind of one way to deal with that

232
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,200
and i don't think necessarily grieving has to necessarily be just about over the loss of life

233
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,600
you know everything has really changed because of this pandemic some people are grieving

234
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,000
the loss of a job that people are grieving you know the loss of a routine the loss of maybe you

235
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,440
used to go to a rave every saturday night and say what you will about raves but you know that that's

236
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,360
church for some people it is a huge social thing and people are very likely grieving the loss of

237
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,720
that as well so i i've kind of always said since the beginning of this i said this whole situation

238
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,640
is crap this covid thing is crap the pandemic is crap but the art that's going to come from

239
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,280
the after this year is going to be amazing and i think video you know and if we subscribe to the

240
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,560
thought process that video games are art which i do um that's just one big part of it but the

241
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,560
grieving for some people can be making a podcast making a twitch stream or a youtube which i've

242
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,760
always been a big proponent proponent about trying to get people to do that but i started a new

243
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,840
project which i'll plug later yeah and you know and there's all sorts of those types of projects

244
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,520
but it could also be like i'm taking up a cross stitch thing i've always wanted to do and i never

245
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,440
got around to doing or making masks can be a thing for people too like we were you know doing that

246
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,320
round table a couple weeks ago with the cosplayers talking about that how you know there's no

247
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,040
conventions right now but you can still kind of get your arts and crafts in from doing masks

248
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,000
so i was doing project one way for me was it was kind of like bringing my cosplay back

249
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,880
right right um and bobby is saying i used to go to a bar trivia every other thursday night with

250
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,360
my friends since i worked from home before all this that would sometimes be literally the only

251
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,640
time i left the house right so say what you will about zoom trivia and the the replacements which

252
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,120
is great it's nice that we have those things but you know it's not the same it's really not yeah

253
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:58,600
yeah and it's just you don't get that someone accidentally bump into you sorry sorry or you

254
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,080
know meet some random person and strike up a conversation and wind up with a good friend you

255
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,480
just just doesn't happen as often when it's virtual i mean i'm not saying it doesn't happen

256
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:13,320
it just doesn't happen as often well and with me being one of the sisters our entire aspects of

257
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,320
ministry have changed i think i was a much better adapted to online ministry than some of the older

258
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,640
sisters i am the youngest one in our group you know we have some you know we used to have a

259
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:34,840
retiree in that was our abbess um and so um for a group that's so social that would go out to do

260
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,280
bar ministry and have in-person events i've had to sort of be the reminding factor y'all need to

261
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,680
wear your masks when we're out in public i i had to distance myself i'm like you can do all of

262
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:53,160
this online our meetings are online everything is and i think that that though i'm hoping that

263
00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:02,200
that's bringing older generations into a more modern concept so that maybe these techniques

264
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,880
that we are developing those of us who are gen x and younger are able to teach them these same

265
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:17,960
concepts teach them that there is a new way to express what they're feeling or to live to be

266
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,440
social that you don't have to sit at a table across from someone drinking with them to still

267
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,520
enjoy someone's company exactly and for a lot of people who are just really big extroverts

268
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,360
i think this is a powerful lesson in people learning how to be alone

269
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,760
yeah yeah that's learn how to enjoy your own company i'm a big extrovert you know it's no

270
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,840
secret i was hosting shows hosting you know this right now i i i should have hosted a rocky horror

271
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,640
last night you know like that with 500 people over at the colonial it was great when it all began

272
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,200
yeah but uh that's cute uh but you know that's not happening and so it's it's it's it's been hard

273
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,920
i'm not gonna lie you know like yeah i am that extrovert that a lot of the introverts are talking

274
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:12,440
about and it's it's it's been tricky in its own way so yeah um let me ask this not not to be in

275
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,320
a negative place but i would be remiss not to ask are there ways that video games in this whole

276
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,800
situation could be bad for your mental health what are some things as gamers we should avoid

277
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,560
absolutely sometimes the escapism or whatever if that's what you want to call it i'm not

278
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,080
sure what the exact term is but you can definitely overdo it to the point where you're neglecting

279
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,320
your physical health you're neglecting your hygiene you're neglecting your diet

280
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,080
if you have family you're neglecting your family you're neglecting your pets

281
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,720
absolutely trash your sleep cycle sleep hygiene is very important for mental function

282
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,640
you know getting the right amount of sleep during the right times for whatever your sleep cycle

283
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:06,280
happens to be uh is really critical um i've been known to go ahead and just binge on a game when

284
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:12,120
i'm unsupervised even now i'm 43 years old the wife takes the kids out i will get on and i'll

285
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,880
play a game start at in the morning and go until sunrise the next day you know and it it trashes my

286
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,080
mental health you know i feel like i'm having a good time i feel like i'm having fun but it's a

287
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,960
short-term game long-term loss for me you know because i i could have gone outside taking a walk

288
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,920
which would have been much more beneficial you know for me i have to really moderate how much

289
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:43,000
i play and what i play because there are some games that i have associated with very bad periods

290
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,080
of my life that i just need to avoid as good as the games are i just i can't play them for my own

291
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:56,680
mental health i hope that answers no for sure for sure and you know i've seen my mass effect binges

292
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:05,400
i i've you know i i think because i i i'm very lucky in that i really enjoy my job and i like

293
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,240
what i do and i do have the ability throughout all this to be able to work from home and i recognize

294
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,480
i'm very lucky in all those aspects so but i think that helps keep my sleep schedule on track because

295
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,800
if i didn't have my job to worry about i think i would probably very easily fall into this pattern

296
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,840
of you know i can stay up till 3 a.m doing mining and crafting and final fantasy because nobody's

297
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,800
going to bother me it'd be very easy to fall into that even before the pandemic we would hear those

298
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:39,560
stories about oh the guy at the cyber cafe in korea that spent 24 hours straight playing league

299
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:45,640
of legends that just collapsed you know or um you know the the person that played wow all weekend

300
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,520
long and ended up you know having a severe medical issue because this is how these are the

301
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,120
types of things that can lead to issues like strokes and things that if you don't get up and

302
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:00,280
move around that's very serious you have to that's one reason you know i like my watch not to give

303
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,440
these guys a free ad and to do to be fair all the please give them a free ad all the modern to be

304
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,880
fair all the modern fitness watches do it so i'm gonna leave it at that but they they will poke you

305
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,200
every hour and go hey hey fatty get up get up get up off your ass and so when people go why

306
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,320
did you spend all that money on a watch i kind of go you know what like even though it like sounds

307
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,160
small those things are a huge deal later on and you know and for our listeners out there because

308
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,920
i'm sure we have several listeners that are like i i don't have a fancy fitness watch and that's

309
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,320
not happening for me that's so you don't need one you can set a timer on your computer or a timer on

310
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,800
your casio old school calculator watch that goes off every 59 minutes that does the same type of

311
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,880
thing you know that reminds you to get up and move around you can get these little cheapo things on

312
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,520
wish for three bucks now and they do the same thing exactly so there's there's plenty of other

313
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,200
solutions besides the fancy fruit stuff and you know all that so and you just always say to your

314
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:09,000
phone hey phone set timer four yes yes so yeah very very important stuff um so um yeah and i'm

315
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,320
looking in chat and again i want to be careful what i read tonight because i think people are

316
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,400
saying some very vulnerable things i don't necessarily want to put that out there um but

317
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,240
i see some people talking about their sleep schedules are not in a great place right now

318
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,000
uh one listener is talking about going to bed at 1am and then waking up at 8am now it's 10pm and

319
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,360
waking up at 4am which seems seems to be a little more you know but yeah i mean that that sleep

320
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,640
schedule is is crazy the other thing with my work and i think this is very important is that

321
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,480
i have found and i need to be better about this i need to do because this was this was something

322
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,800
when i thought it was just going to be a two-week solution my workplace and my pc gaming place are

323
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:57,080
the exact same place and i think that's that's very bad it is no it's very bad and that's why

324
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,320
like and you know it's interesting because i've also been asked why why why are you buying new

325
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,760
consoles when you have a pc and in my opinion this is just exacerbating like this is why i

326
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,560
need to have a different space to play games sometimes that isn't in front of the bc which is

327
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,120
what i'm doing all day for work you know and even when it is going back to the office sometimes

328
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,080
instead of sitting in my ergonomically sound chair i want to be a potato on the couch and

329
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,600
play some no man's sky and just changing up those types of factors is really healthy because again

330
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,920
i'm admitting and you're all agreeing what i'm doing right now is bad like pc gaming and working

331
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,640
in the same place is bad but unfortunately it's kind of my only choice right now until we do some

332
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:44,760
major rearranging i have two separate computers though side by side i've got my my uh my work max

333
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,920
and then i have my pc which is gonna be going away soon but i have another mac over there

334
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,680
that's my other workstation for doing my own creative work one thing i did when i was in

335
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:02,600
that situation where i had my gaming pc and my work pc side by side is i made sure my gaming pc

336
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,920
was off while i was working and i had a specific work chair when i was done with work i turned off

337
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,840
the work computer switched chairs something whether it's a physical change of location

338
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,480
or some psychological change really helps to help keep it separated um because one of the dangers of

339
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,760
working from home is to fall into the routine of oh well i have five minutes i could go move the

340
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,320
laundry you really shouldn't you really should try to keep guilty effort for your life i know

341
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,720
so am i but you should really try to keep those aspects separated for your own health now see for

342
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:48,680
me i need those moments because of um my chronic fatigue if i am doing nothing but focusing on my

343
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:55,240
work computer and i work a 10-hour day with an hour lunch so i can get three days off in a row

344
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,480
um but anyway for me i need those moments i actually have a medical reason that i get three

345
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,960
extra breaks in my shift and i get up and leave i used to have a bad habit of staying at my desk

346
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:15,880
and doing like my email or stuff during my lunch i need those separate moments where i am not in

347
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,960
work mode i am real life mode and for me being home to do that instead of going like say to the

348
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,600
cafe to get you know a snack or a coffee or something i'm still in the building and still

349
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:36,360
seeing for lack of a better description the work propaganda yeah whereas if i leave this room i get

350
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,920
me out by my cat and she's a lot nicer yeah and what i'm saying though is it's more the general

351
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:49,240
rule not the hard yeah everybody right um i mean when i have my switch next to me everybody's

352
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,920
going to be different everybody's going to be different yeah yeah like for me because i mean

353
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,200
i used to work the same company that jamie did um and she remembers i was a wanderer on my breaks

354
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,960
at lunchtime yes i went around and i made i visited as many people as i could it's just part

355
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,440
of who i am um and i was always trying to help people out give little tips of advice to try to

356
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,880
pick up some of my own but you don't do what frank does he puts on that wireless headset

357
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:21,000
and walks down the aisle while he's doing his thing yeah um and by the way rob drew works with

358
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,240
us too no i know i know yeah so but when i got to move from home or got to move to home i actually

359
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,520
have a detached office which right now my son's living in but he's moving out on this coming up

360
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:40,120
friday and i get to have that back as my sound studio hardwired internet to it um what i would

361
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:47,240
do is between calls is i have my door open and i play fetch with my dog i like that i like that

362
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,360
idea too of just changing something like your chair like if it isn't it possible for you to

363
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,960
change the entire environment just change you know your chair change maybe something that is

364
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,040
surrounding maybe you have a a digital picture frame and the pictures show different when you're

365
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,200
working versus when you're not i mean it sounds silly but or maybe the curtain is closed when

366
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,400
you're working but then it's open when you're not you know just like those little changes to your

367
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,720
environment can be huge even like a little dummy light switch that you drill into your desk well

368
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,440
and i'm sure you guys can see that i have this like roller cart behind me loaded with toys

369
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,000
yeah it is actually a barrier between now i have it at an angle i can still kind of see across

370
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,440
but it's still technically my barrier for where my work situation is so and i have completely

371
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,480
different toys facing the other direction so i kind of like can build my own cubicle wall for

372
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,920
and this whole room is going to get redone so i'm actually going to be picking myself up a uh

373
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:54,040
a green screen and a blue screen so that i can have that as an actual for real physical divider

374
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:00,920
neat okay yeah um and if you guys in chat have any questions for um e please go ahead and uh

375
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,600
let them uh out in our chat room over twitch.tv slash avog network uh and again e is the host of

376
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:15,560
the podcast am i mental that is a very hard name to forget yes i'm kidding well i i bet for a lot

377
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:20,280
of people it might be i mean again we're not a doctor and if you think you you maybe you

378
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,160
probably should always get assessed by a doctor but we're one gestalt doctor i bet i bet the

379
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,640
answer to am i mental is uh maybe a little bit but probably not as bad as you think

380
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:37,000
for a lot of people i i like to quote the mad hatter here we're all mad here i'm mad you're mad

381
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,880
my whole thing was is that when you start to wrestle with the fact that you might have uh

382
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,480
some kind of mental illness or mental health issue uh a question usually does pop up along the lines

383
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:55,800
of am i crazy is it me is there something wrong with me am i mental and i figured that was kind

384
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,200
of a catchy name and it stuck and it really has a lot of meaning because i those questions um and

385
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,520
we actually do have an official website am i mental dot net dot com was taken by somebody

386
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:14,120
else i had to take net but um yeah and um no we're actually at the process right now we're going

387
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,600
through our third season uh we only do two episodes ten episode seasons we're trying to

388
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,440
match the seasons of the year so each season is a different actual season like we're in the fall

389
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,680
season right now then the next one will be the winter season um but we're already booking up

390
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,360
for season four already and we are only three episodes in on season three so it feels really

391
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:42,280
good like um just gotta give you an idea of how it's growing my first season unfortunately i

392
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,560
started on march 19th first day of spring which it just happened to land that way i didn't even

393
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,640
know was the first day of spring it's like three days before the episode and then went yeah let's

394
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,920
just follow the seasons that's kind of how it came through but it took me two months to get it all

395
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,400
booked out and then covet hit and essential workers wound up working you know like six

396
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,800
12-hour shifts and i had the entire season it was just rescheduling rescheduling rescheduling

397
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,760
season two took a month to get scheduled season three it was done in under 12 hours

398
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:20,520
what do you get in your system plans to to take the time off to be on for was it the 29th

399
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:28,920
yeah yes you have the basically the halloween episode and no one is surprised yeah and i was

400
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,960
like i laughed about it too because like i did the music for your 666 episode and you're coming

401
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,720
over for my first halloween episode yeah kismet perfect well you know what with you having done

402
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:45,400
our music for that episode funny thing is that i made our podcast theme for this one

403
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:53,960
oh for our new podcast name i did it myself very cool yeah with a little help yeah i mean

404
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,960
that part of where you work it starts coming naturally after a little while you just kind

405
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,800
of poking around and playing with things well and you know who it is jamal helped me

406
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,800
oh yeah jamal's awesome yeah let me let me get y'all talking about people that our listeners

407
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,280
don't know so let me get back to this question in chat no no it's fine it's fine um some good

408
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,080
you know tips and and lessons learned from some of our chatters here uh shmaketastic in chat over

409
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,440
twitch.tv slash vlog network says i've made the mistake of having my work desk next to my gaming

410
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,600
desk and using the same chair i feel as if i'm associating the work stress with gaming

411
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:37,640
and stressfully gaming sometimes like being unable to let gaming relax me sometimes and that's that's

412
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,320
big that's really talking about like you know the the the being able to have like the separate

413
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:50,040
spaces you can separate those things in your mind mentally yeah um one of the coolest little stories

414
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,560
i ever heard this was back i was in seventh grade my english teacher was talking about how this guy

415
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,120
every day after work he'd get home and he would touch one specific branch on the tree as he came

416
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,280
to onto his property and went into the house and then every day on his way to work he touched that

417
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,480
same branch and leave and he did this for over a year his wife finally asked what are you doing

418
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,560
and he says when i get home from work i'm hanging up all of my work stresses on that tree

419
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,120
and then when i leave to go back to work i'm picking them up again and noticing they're a

420
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,320
lot lighter than they were when i put them there i like that it's a good story i thought that was

421
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:33,400
a cool little story i like that um ssj100 mat and chat says i've been making sure to go outside

422
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,840
mostly late at night or early morning when there's fewer folks to get my outside time because that is

423
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,520
also important being in a two-room studio for now feels claustrophobic thankfully i'm moving in a

424
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,320
week you know that importance of getting outside and moving around is so important and luckily

425
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,520
you know a lot of that is gamified uh you know obviously pokemon go is the huge behemoth that

426
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,600
a lot of people talking about for motivation to go outside but there's other games as well you know

427
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:05,400
loki has talked a lot about orna the you know kind of rpg inspired one that is when you can uh play

428
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,680
out while you walk as well minecraft earth uh there's a jurassic world one the list goes on

429
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,560
and on chances are one of those games is something that could incentivize you going outdoors if you

430
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:23,480
need it absolutely and i mean um what's kind of funny is that i'm seeing a lot of especially now

431
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,040
with the mobile gaming community the way that it is a little bit of a tangent here is that the

432
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:35,640
aims range is spectacular on the people that you interact with but nobody's judging on age at all

433
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,280
you know because we're all just trying to get away trying to have a little bit of fun

434
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,680
yeah um as it should be yeah and it's like i'm 43 years old and i run a guild and a game called

435
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,040
shop titans uh basically it's like you're the instead of being the you know you go to the shop

436
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,000
in a role-playing game to sell all your junk and buy new stuff you're the shopkeeper and the

437
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,440
players the npcs are the adventurers i play there's like a shop girl game yeah i played a game like

438
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,840
that on steam but it wasn't like an mo it was like a racketeer something was the name of that

439
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:12,520
game i somebody in chattel here right is that it somebody in chattel no yeah there was a game like

440
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,400
that i was playing on steam yeah at this one um one of our most active members is a retiree

441
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,720
you know and um in my group on among us they keep calling me og because i've been playing

442
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,000
since the atara 2600 you know and some of these people are like i never even heard of that system

443
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,280
before they had to look it up oh wow oh wow yeah yeah doesn't that make you feel old yeah a little

444
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,520
bit that's interesting because among us and you you keep coming back to that game and obviously

445
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:44,760
that is the a huge uh a game right now it's it's in the top all the time on twitch and so forth

446
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,240
but i also think that game that game is some i don't know if i want to say mental warfare

447
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,840
but it can be some serious like mental gymnastics because you essentially are having to lie to

448
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:01,320
people sometimes and that's really uncomfortable so how does that work with the mental health

449
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,720
a lot of people in my group when they're the imposter they just help themselves right away

450
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,840
because they can't do it they don't want to do it but they really enjoy the mind play of trying to

451
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:17,080
figure out who the imposter is i like being the imposter i love being the imposter um i my

452
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,280
favorite is when there's two imposters if i'm the first one to die the other imposter never has to

453
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,000
worry about sabotage again so they can keep moving constantly and no one goes i saw them

454
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,920
stop just before this yeah nope they didn't stop because i'm helping them but yeah no it takes

455
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,880
some teamwork makes the dream work yep but it does it takes a mentality to be able to be the

456
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,840
the imposter and be able to fly but i mean for me i'm not lying to them for the because i'm trying

457
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:50,440
to get away with actual murder or actual crimes sure it's just all fun and games it's role playing

458
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,200
for me and i play dungeons and dragons and i played star wars i play a lot of role-playing

459
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,840
games so it's just role play for me sure it's like the old werewolf game we used to play on

460
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:07,720
ddr forums yeah and uh and uh the werewolf is a the game that is infamous at dragon con you know

461
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:13,800
and those those types of things so yeah it's to me among us is just an evolution of that mafia slash

462
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,760
who's the werewolf type of game it's it's just somebody thought how to put that in a digital

463
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,400
format in a platforming type of way and they did an amazing job with it and it's interesting

464
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,440
because it it sat for two years before it got discovered which really makes that game really

465
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,120
fascinating and how it works so yeah i mean it's just like that whole town of salem whatever

466
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,680
except that instead of it being you have your discussion cycle okay now it's the night cycle

467
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,160
do your thing you're actually running around physically doing things on the game and if you're

468
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,000
the imposter you're trying to fake doing these things without getting caught faking you're

469
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,120
trying to find opportunities that you can off someone and you're trying to set up sabotages

470
00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:00,200
and clever ways to help get people separated from the herd you know and it's and there's also a lot

471
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,800
of the mental play too where as the imposter you don't want the finger pointed at you obviously

472
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,920
and you want to try to make sure that you get the finger pointed elsewhere if someone starts to

473
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,720
suspect you well and you know you know what's also interesting and i think that works with among us

474
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,480
is that it also works i think because the games are so short and you can play like 15 games of

475
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,000
it a night because i'll tell you uh i i am into those types of psychological games like survivor

476
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,560
on tv and um uh like big brother and stuff like that well before it got super racist but the game

477
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:37,720
itself i find very fascinating um but survivor i've played versions of survivor online that are

478
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,360
very intense they go on for a month and you're sitting at home but you're still on skype a lot

479
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,960
of the time or discord or whatever it is with you know your tribe mates and the people you're

480
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,760
working with like to the point where you know i i won i was i was lucky enough to win one last

481
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:56,360
summer but like i remember i had to vote out my closest ally at final four because if he didn't

482
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,120
get voted out he was going to win and if i want to win he's got to go but i cried i because i was

483
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:07,480
just so invested and like you know i definitely learned like oh my gosh to play a game like this

484
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:13,000
i have got to have the mental energy to do it and i don't i haven't played one since i've been

485
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,080
asked to play like four or five different games and i i just i also kind of recognize like i need

486
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:25,080
a mental reserve battery i don't have right now and i thought the pandemic was going to give me

487
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:30,440
the time but i don't think it's given me that mental reserve battery by any means and that's

488
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:35,800
why i've passed up so many opportunities to play during what i think is a really great time to play

489
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,480
right yeah it's like i mean um even with my podcast like i have a daughter she's an adult now

490
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:51,160
uh going to uh she's going to a jc at this moment um she wanted to do psychology major she's changed

491
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,520
it now but even she has said because of the pandemic she can't listen to most of the episodes

492
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:03,480
of my podcast because she just doesn't have that reserve you know the pandemic is draining it you

493
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,600
know because she used to go out on every saturday it was go out to a restaurant have something to

494
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,040
eat with your group of friends and then go play board games that's just gone yeah you know for

495
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,120
real and that recharged her batteries to allow her to be able to enjoy you know my podcast she's only

496
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,680
listened to a couple episodes and you know she feels so bad about it you know she's like i'm so

497
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,040
sorry i'm so sorry i'm like honey it's fine i get it this is not a podcast for everybody in all

498
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,920
situations some of my closest friends will hear the topic of an episode and they're like i'm gone

499
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,840
can't deal with this one no yeah yeah and that's yeah i get that and i haven't hit an episode yet

500
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:44,440
as a host where i'm going no but if it happens it happens and i'm gonna either have to power through

501
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,240
it i'm gonna have to ask the co-host hey this one's too personal can you take it yeah you know

502
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:55,080
and i get it yeah and i don't require my friends to listen to this show i really it's it's a lie

503
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,640
and it's not video games like the the deep discussion we do on some of this stuff is not

the old valley star trek that we sold a few others um so uh it's it's pretty crazy it's one of those

563
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,400
ones that's got the big screen with the full video on it rob one of this that's what the jersey jack

564
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:53,240
ones are like like uh the wizard of oz so um so yeah it's it's pretty crazy i haven't really

565
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:59,080
i played it in the past at other people's houses so this is uh a little bit you know of a thing

566
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:09,320
um and i have other gaming ish things going on but i won't talk about that yet i'll wait until

567
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:14,920
gaming week is over if you don't mind okay sure you got it yeah uh doctor who

568
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:21,800
accord uh climb pod culture loki you're still here it's so quiet i am hope you're all right

569
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,560
no you're fine you're fine i know sometimes you want to let the guests talk it's fine

570
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,680
exactly and all i can really contribute to that is yeah i'm angry all the time because i have to do

571
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:41,320
i have to work and with people that they're people um so anyways um so this week i didn't play a

572
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:47,960
whole ton of things but i did play some new stuff so i tried out the new mario kart uh home circuit

573
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:54,360
live so i got to play that a little bit so that was cool how was that i was watching bobby play

574
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:01,160
it on stream it looked it looked neat yeah it's pretty neat um so not a lot of like space i was

575
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,800
hoping that it would be able to work through multiple rooms but as you probably saw in his

576
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:14,040
stream it does not handle that very well you can only go like not too far away especially if you

577
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:19,240
have a wall in between you yeah you have to line a site the switch basically which if you're willing

578
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,720
to play in handheld mode he brought this up on the call the bobby when we were talking at the end of

579
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:29,240
his show if you're willing to take the switch off the dock and walk behind the car you can make a

580
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:36,600
bigger course but that would involve you getting up and moving yeah um yeah so we didn't do that

581
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,600
but um i was able to set it up in a few rooms in the house so we tried it out there and it's

582
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:47,160
pretty cool um i like that you can go online and print replacements for some of the stuff so i

583
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,120
printed out more of those barriers um so now they're all like shiny and stuff so that's kind

584
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:59,240
of fun how crazy is it by the way that when microsoft was kind of the first to put their

585
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:05,480
paw into ar gaming with the hololens and obviously we never really saw anything fully realized with

586
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,360
that i mean we had the there there was a a sleuthing game that was pretty good on there

587
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,600
but i mean obviously it never got to the level where they put out a consumer device for that

588
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,800
and they were talking about like a minecraft ar game but we never did get that although i kind

589
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,520
of think micro minecraft earth is probably bits of what we would have seen in a minecraft

590
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:30,040
hololens game but um isn't it interesting that microsoft was kind of doing that and then nintendo

591
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:35,400
just out of nowhere who we usually tease for being behind in technology when it comes to

592
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:42,040
online gaming or their vr is really you know kind of half-assed with labo compared to competitors

593
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,160
or they're you know just they're never the power of the of the other systems on the market

594
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,920
the that nintendo comes in and really puts out like hey here's our idea for an ar game and it's

595
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:02,200
really good like i don't know if it has longevity that's my concern with it but i mean just as a

596
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,640
cool shit for my kids to play with that'll entertain them for a while i think it's a big

597
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:14,280
win for nintendo well i'll tell you what's better than uh where it exceeds with what they did with

598
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:21,960
labo is um you can fold that all the uh checkpoints down back into a box when you're done

599
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:28,440
playing with them fair enough so that that already is like you know loads ahead of everything else

600
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:35,240
that they've done um other than that yeah it's it's fun for a while i think um i'm sure that

601
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:41,400
they'll release more stuff for it like updates and everything they could just easily put out like new

602
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,680
things for the scanning that does different stuff i mean and that wouldn't be that hard for them to

603
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:54,040
do um kind of disappointing that you can only do one player per system which is annoying um i get

604
00:57:54,040 --> 00:58:00,280
it but like flip screen should probably be able to be a thing um so that's kind of a little

605
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,760
disappointing because my kids want to like kind of play together but like we don't have two systems

606
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,520
well i mean think of it think of it as you're paying a hundred dollars for the car you're not

607
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:13,000
paying a hundred dollars because the game is free the game you can go on shop right now and

608
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,280
download the game it's just not going to do shit without the car but you're really paying for the

609
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,640
car not the game so if you kind of frame it that way i think maybe the two-player thing might sit

610
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,720
a little better i don't know yeah that's the other thing too is like i pre-ordered that like a while

611
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:37,720
ago and um come release day walmart didn't ship it so i just went down to the store and they had

612
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,920
them there i'm like and they were ten dollars cheaper so i was like um this doesn't make any

613
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:49,400
sense but okay we'll do it this way kind of has me concerned because that's where my xbox series x

614
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:56,520
is too so we'll see um hopefully they're a little bit better about that but um so aside from the

615
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:07,960
mario kart live stuff i did play a bit of orna um i did try out pac-man uh was it pac-man geo

616
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:17,720
it's not good oh that's the one where they just made the google earth pac-man thing a game right

617
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:24,440
yeah it's it is basically that i mean they didn't there's no frills to it at all but

618
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,080
it's just like you can like pick different parts of the map to actually make

619
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:38,120
a level out of but you have to zoom way in to get to the streets and like i'm in a pretty small

620
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:44,920
neighborhood myself i couldn't get it to work in my neighborhood because it couldn't create a level

621
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:51,640
out of that there wasn't enough like small even smaller streets which is weird and then even when

622
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:56,280
and then even when you do have that because i was able to get it like over in fair oaks

623
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,920
where it's like twisty it doesn't make any sense over there i was able to get it to play on that

624
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:07,480
but the controls are awful it's all touch controls to like moving you have to swipe in the direction

625
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,880
that you want to go and when you have streets that are kind of they're not perpendicular to

626
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,520
each other and they're kind of all over the place because i mean not all streets are perpendicular

627
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,440
it doesn't control well at all and it just wasn't fun i played it for about five minutes

628
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,800
i tried a few different areas i tried one because they start you off in like a tutorial on um

629
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:35,880
oh in new york so you play there with with the statue of liberty um so i played that and then

630
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,880
i tried someplace closer to my house and it just was super boring and it was already starting like

631
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:49,160
hey you can buy stuff i'm like okay bye no thanks so um being that there's no it's not like an

632
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,800
augmented reality game where you can walk places and you know collect things and stuff like that

633
01:00:53,800 --> 01:01:00,760
like pokemon go ingress orna you know all the other ones out there um it's just kind of

634
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,800
pointless it's basically the google little thing that they did for april fool's day and then just

635
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:11,960
worse so you can try it out it's free but like i mean i i installed that pretty quick oh and

636
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,400
by the way um so you have to create an account uh you can link it to social media so facebook or

637
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:25,480
twitter um to track your progress that's broken right now so you have to just not link it to

638
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:31,160
anything and so i think deleting my game on there actually lost all my pro what little progress i

639
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:40,120
had oh no um so it's just not pretty good okay um and then aside from that just been working on

640
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:48,680
game stuff and yeah pretty much it all right uh my gaming week you know we had a long intro tonight

641
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,760
so i can i can keep this short because i haven't really played a lot of new stuff still still

642
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:59,240
trucking along on final fantasy 14 i got my first crafter to 80 today so i think by this time next

643
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,960
week they'll all be to 80 my my carpenter is 80 now so i've been working on that but i did get

644
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,680
all my gatherers to 80 and fall nancy 14 so that's what kind of what i'm looking at and then they put

645
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:14,440
out the uh the bojjan front in this they did a mini patch this week and they did the bojjan front

646
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,640
um which is which is interesting uh it's they're talking a lot online about the red chocobo fight

647
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:24,600
because there is there is a a group fight that you end up doing that is a it's red comet is the

648
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:30,200
name of the chocobo and it is a red chocobo i gasped when i did the fight because i was not

649
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,680
prepared it does these aoes right when it draws on the ground this is the attack that it's going

650
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:40,360
to do it was nuts i had not seen anything like it in the game and i was like where the f am i

651
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,600
supposed to go stand that's safe i can't in this like one tiny little space that you really have

652
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,800
to hunt for so that that red chocobo fight was was nuts so i've been checking that out too

653
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:57,320
and then still playing hades i finally made my way to the third boss flare uh i don't want to give a

654
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:02,040
spoiler there's something different with the third boss so i i got there uh but i wasn't able to beat

655
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,880
it yet so i'm gonna keep working on it uh and that's it i haven't really played a lot of new

656
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:12,120
stuff the one kind of new thing i played i'm gonna have a bobby blackwolf moment here and you're

657
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:16,200
gonna understand why i said that in a minute because the only new thing i played was a demo

658
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,480
and i've completely judged this game based off the demo and i know like much like bobby

659
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:27,320
blackwolf and nino cooney this game can kiss my ass based off the demo guess what game that is

660
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:32,360
because this is going to surprise you is really going to surprise you kingdom hearts melody of

661
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:38,120
memories or is it memory of melodies i don't know mom kingdom hearts mom surprised it sucks

662
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:43,320
interesting it sucks i'm sorry and there's going to be people that are into it and like it and

663
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,120
they're going to be like rob what's your problem you're such an asshole but i just i'm sorry it

664
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:54,520
was not like i i was really irritated that they took a formula that really worked the theater

665
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:59,560
them formula and they made it this weird platforming thing and what i really hate

666
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:06,520
is that for whatever reason like some monsters you have to hit multiple times uh just for you

667
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,440
know because we just didn't want to note them with single monsters doing double monsters said

668
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,960
sometimes the monsters will be flying but these aren't the ones that you jump to hit you only

669
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,760
jump to hit when you see the marker that says jump and then a monster that you hit like it just

670
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:28,440
i didn't like playing it it wasn't fun and the music is okay but it's not at the same level

671
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,920
as theater them to me and the final fantasy series maybe it'll be more interesting when

672
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,560
they have let it go i don't know but the songs that they have in there now were not

673
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:44,360
that great to me so that's it and bobby blackwolf in chat says yep i knew it i also wasn't very

674
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:52,600
happy with the demo i wanted theater them um let's see uh i'm trying to see if there's other

675
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:59,400
comments there uh phoenix 77 26 says not gonna lie i'm kind of tired of kingdom hearts deviating

676
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,600
as much as they do and akuma jp oh welcome back i haven't seen you in a while akuma jp in chat

677
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:11,160
says rob let it go um i will i'm gonna let it go straight to the recycle bin and you can kiss my

678
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:18,760
big butt if you think i'm gonna spend 60 50 on that game maybe 10 bucks on a dumpster sale

679
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,680
later on like in two years time because it is a square enix game after all but i just i'm not

680
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:30,440
gonna pay that much more than it um shad star six in chat right now and says i liked the demo for

681
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,640
kingdom hearts it's just different and it worked for me well i'm glad it worked for somebody and

682
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:42,200
you know what bobby hated nino cooney and i ended up really liking that game so you can take my

683
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,240
opinion and throw it away if you want but that is my opinion and i'm sticking to it the demo

684
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,960
was supposed to impress me and make me think they've made some good changes to theater them

685
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:58,680
and oh maybe i want to see theater them released released like this no i don't no i don't like it

686
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:06,280
no no the end all right let's move on uh we're gonna get into some gaming news oh

687
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,160
actually i think we do have a few housekeeping things to get into because jamie you wanted to

688
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:16,680
bring something up right yes so um i'm working on expanding a few things because our blogging stuff

689
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:23,160
has kind of you know fallen by the wayside you know um and i love writing writing is you know

690
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:31,800
kind of you know my big thing so um i have created a blog there will be some video content on its way

691
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:41,000
there will be a related podcast on its way but it's called genexgeeks.com that's g-e-e-x so g-e-n-x

692
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:49,800
g-e-x.com i have twitter for it which is also genexgeeks um and i'm looking i mean basically

693
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:55,880
since it's you know gen x it's you know our our generation of stuff although definitely going into

694
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:59,960
you know the other stuff that we're into because i don't think that interest should be generational

695
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,560
but there certainly is perspective that we have that maybe other people don't

696
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:09,640
um and it's it's not just you know like i got a lot of stuff for video games i have some nerdy

697
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:15,400
stuff for you know movies and anime and also some self-care stuff on there like irl stuff you know

698
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:21,800
like what are what are we doing in the world around us what types of things can we do to help

699
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:27,800
other people um you know kind of community oriented um and there will i've kept i keep

700
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:32,600
forgetting to add the pinball thing on there too but so um i'd appreciate it if people would check

701
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:41,080
it out and leave me some feedback it just started um but i think that um it'd be a little way to

702
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:48,760
expand i guess my voice as a gamer and as a geeky person you know yeah so let me ask you this

703
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,200
because i already know the answer there's going to be other people out there that probably don't so

704
01:07:52,200 --> 01:08:00,680
just to let you kind of state this how is this different than vog it is a very different

705
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:08,840
perspective because you know vog is basically going to be specifically you know really well

706
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,360
it's kind of hard for me to describe it how did i describe it to you before because

707
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:21,080
it's it's part i think part but expanded i think um also it's more one person's perspective whereas

708
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,920
the voice of geeks network is really about all of the voices and putting that together

709
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:29,880
and i think the comparison you and i were talking about was um when we had electric sisterhood that

710
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,280
was a part of the voice of geeks network um electric sisterhood was also a site that had

711
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,880
all their own types of blog posts and all their own types of news and did their own types of

712
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,920
reviews and things that were kind of unique to their perspective and obviously they've moved on

713
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,240
to their new project black compat shout out to that because i'm always going to when i bring

714
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,560
them up um but i think that was kind of like i was saying when you were talking to me about this i

715
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,160
was like oh it kind of sounds like you know like when esh had their own sort of site and the same

716
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:00,280
thing with a critical myth an anime jam session uh is still around and kind of does their own

717
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:05,880
anime focused content and articles and things on that site so yeah and i was also thinking that i

718
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:16,680
mean a network isn't necessarily you know an audio or visual thing right right you know and if what i

719
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:23,480
have to say on there resonates with people who maybe you know and not to say anything about you

720
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:29,560
guys i love you guys but maybe they want to hear somebody who is not a cisgender man and has you

721
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:36,040
know a different perspective well you know i to be fair we're really trying to not have that always

722
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:43,720
be the case you know we try to mix that up i know but i just threw it out there as an example or say

723
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:50,040
that you know if someone's looking for a little bit more of a lifestyle thing like hey what what

724
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:57,480
is self-care for someone of our generation what is this you know can you teach me how to adult the

725
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:05,240
answer is no um you know so i'm really looking on kind of expanding what geekery in the real world

726
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:10,440
is about does that make sense i think so i think uh you have to go check it out and it'll make more

727
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:18,920
sense i like what ej ron meh said um uh vog is all ages genics geek real shit yeah this is kind of

728
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:24,120
like how i'm taking it like you know i've already written a couple of articles about um supernatural

729
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:29,720
ending i've done um i've actually got two cosplay articles coming and they're just really short

730
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:34,360
because i mean that's the thing i want it to be quick and easy and digestible so i have two

731
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:39,320
articles coming up from some prominent cosplayers and actually one of them is my friend annie who

732
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:49,000
um does uh saver podcast and uh stuff mom never told you and um i also have uh another one from a

733
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,960
really good cosplayer from rkd cosplay um i asked for like one question and got a big write-up so

734
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:03,480
said i'll just do this all you then um um and i'm looking for you know people if if they want to uh

735
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:08,040
you know if they have something to say i'll give them i'll give them a spot um i'm actually working

736
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:15,000
out something with my friend hillary who runs a 28-year salon here in the sacramento area

737
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
um about uh you know things like hair care and stuff like that but you know because there's this

738
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,200
whole big trend now for you know hair colors and stuff that you see you know in video games

739
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:31,960
and anime and stuff um so we'll be talking about stuff like that you know it's it's really geek

740
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:39,480
lifestyle you know but for those of us who have maybe a little bit more money than you know the

741
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,920
the younger ones um you know maybe people who have a lot more like real life stuff going on

742
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:52,680
people maybe who have uh physical limitations you know due to you know like i'm 44 and i have

743
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:59,000
arthritis in my hips so i can't go out and play all the ddr in the universe like i used to so i

744
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,240
would be talking about well what are ways that you can protect yourself when you're going out to play

745
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:09,880
a high impact video game you something like that so that's kind of you know kind of my thing for

746
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:15,400
those of us who remembers when mtv played videos for example all right so everybody check that out

747
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:22,120
it's gen x geeks with an x.com right yeah i get that right okay thank you um and i will say on

748
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:27,480
the vog front we have some exciting stuff coming soon we just need to cry i can't say much more

749
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:33,320
than that just we got across the t's and dot some i's but a very some very good conversations were

750
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,880
had behind the scenes and uh i'm hoping we got more to say in a couple weeks that's all i can

751
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:43,960
really say for now so um i've probably already said too much so let's move on uh let's get into

752
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:51,960
some news so loki we're gonna start with you tonight with some gaming news yeah so the ps4

753
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:59,000
just received the 8.0 update making some tweaks to the party and messaging functionality

754
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:05,640
some of this stuff is also going to be tied into the playstation 5 as well so what they did was

755
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:11,720
they kind of streamlined everything changing the ui with that they also have this nice mute all

756
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:20,520
option as well some new avatars that you can choose from and simpler parental controls

757
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:27,400
one of the other things though that they did mention with this though is basically there's a

758
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,640
a little warning message that pops up says following this update users are seeing a

759
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:37,560
notification about party safety and that voice chats and parties may be recorded voice chat

760
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:42,600
recording for moderation is a feature that'll be available on the playstation 5 when it launches

761
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:48,200
and will enable users to record their voice chats on ps5 and submit them for moderation

762
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:54,120
review i'm assuming not your own voice chats but like other people obviously on the voice chat you

763
01:13:54,120 --> 01:14:01,080
know so they can ban those rude people or whatever um but basically it's just letting you know that

764
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:06,600
if you're playing with somebody on a playstation 5 that your voice chat may be recorded as part of

765
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:14,200
their functionality um of course people are kind of concerned that sony listening to my voice chats

766
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:20,120
no that's not what they're doing apparently they don't have time to do that stuff but do you think

767
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:25,720
okay let's well let's be honest there's going to be people that have those series and and they

768
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:32,280
could be right or wrong could they be listening for phrases like you know and i'm going to use

769
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:36,840
this as an example in case i set something off on twitch okay just for the purpose of discussion

770
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:42,040
but let's say someone says a phrase like i'm going to blow up a federal building you know or whatever

771
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,960
it is or they're talking they're making those sorts of plans and i don't know why you would

772
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:50,760
use playstation to do it but we've heard about those types of groups congregating in in places

773
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:56,680
you wouldn't necessarily think of because they're less monitored so could sony system listen for

774
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:02,520
those types of phrases i mean i guess it's within the realm of possibility since everything listens

775
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:11,800
to you nowadays but um my thing though is and i i think someone brought the um idea up is let's say

776
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:17,960
that you do get i'm assuming not let's say that let's let's just assume that the only

777
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:24,920
that the submission by users isn't the only way that they're monitoring everything let's just say

778
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:31,400
that they are listening for key phrases like that well if that's the case that's done by an

779
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:37,800
algorithm and we know that algorithms are not necessarily the most accurate or best thing to do

780
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,000
i mean but obviously with the kind of volume that they're going to have that's the only way they can

781
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:49,880
do it but it's not 100 accurate and we have seen in the case of like youtube and twitch and stuff

782
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,840
that there can be false bans from some of that stuff and with not a lot of moderation that could

783
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:00,280
get out of hand pretty quick my understanding though is i think if you do get banned

784
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:07,160
um with that kind of uh based on something like that that you actually lose access to your

785
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:14,280
playstation library that you have as well um because you'd be locked out from your account

786
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:19,480
i'm not sure if that's necessarily 100 accurate that's just the concerns i've heard but i think

787
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:25,880
maybe taking a little bit too far i am glad that they at least have an option to submit a chat if

788
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:31,160
there is and i don't even know if they'd necessarily be a party chat per se because

789
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:36,040
i doubt you'd be having people in your own party that are being ridiculous that yeah you're being

790
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:40,760
absolutely rude i would think it's more of just regular in-game audio where you have somebody that

791
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:48,760
you know is is being toxic one of those little a-holes that's saying you know f-word f-word

792
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:53,480
n-word n-word right and so i would assume that you know as part of that you could report them

793
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:58,280
and then it would be record but to be able to do that though it would have to be recording your

794
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:04,440
audio at all times so well you know yeah here's the other thing too and and it's interesting

795
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,360
because in chat um uh they're saying uh what was the comment here uh try dean and chat says rob

796
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,200
shouldn't have said that look i went out of my way to make sure i was saying is for the purposes

797
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:18,920
of news and discussion only uh and there's a fifth dream in chat says that's exactly what

798
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,840
i'll tell the secret service when they arrive at my door tomorrow fifth dream in chat says they're

799
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:28,120
already reviewing the policies after reading reading feedback from users well i mean and to

800
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,160
be fair to look at both sides of this so i give you that side but then the other side i'm going

801
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:36,440
to give you is isn't the playstation 4 already recording things it's recording your gameplay for

802
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:42,360
15 minutes it's taking screenshots whenever it wants because when the game when something crashes

803
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:46,280
on your playstation 4 and i know this because it happened in no man's sky not that long ago like

804
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:52,360
just less than two weeks ago i was playing no man's sky and and i had a random crash and it said do

805
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:59,480
you want to attach a video and all this of your gameplay so your ps4 is already watching you no

806
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,640
of course it is because they have the share functionality and that's why when you push the

807
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:08,680
button to record a short video it's of footage that you've already played so it is recording

808
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:15,880
a short bit of your gameplay already um but it's just it's not really doing anything with it i i

809
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:21,320
don't really necessarily have a huge problem with it um i don't either because i kind of think it's

810
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:25,800
already happening exactly you have to be completely naive if you don't believe that everything's not

811
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:31,720
being monitored i mean there's if you're using a service obviously it's gonna have their caveats

812
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:41,000
and it's you know just privacy concerns aside you know if it'll make the online um environment

813
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:49,160
better like we're gonna see less toxic people because of it then that's cool um what i want

814
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:53,800
to know because i haven't used playstation 4 why i haven't played my playstation 4 in a long time

815
01:18:53,800 --> 01:19:00,520
um i'm curious if the playstation 4 chat functionality is like as easy it was like on the

816
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,760
xbox 360 is kind of what i remember where you can actually kind of do a chat people can be playing

817
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,560
different games you know and that type of thing it's easy to invite people in and that type of

818
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:17,640
stuff i don't know if that's ever been that easy on playstation 4 i don't know well hopefully this

819
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:25,640
is better um um act f says yeah you can um ssh100 matt and it has a really good comment here um

820
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:32,680
that i want to read says the main thing um is sony and others have to do something to fix

821
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:38,520
online harassment if it has to be done this way i totally get it one of my issues with it is that

822
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:44,280
sony is handling it who has a history of data security kind of wish a different firm was

823
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:50,680
handling it so maybe bringing in a third party to take care of that or something hmm um at def

824
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:55,720
points out uh with that scenario you were bringing up loki we do that for our overwatch sessions

825
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:03,240
since some of our players play stuff like fall guys and genshin impact so all right well um

826
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:08,120
yeah i know my firmware update already uh came through for the playstation 4 so uh there's that

827
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:13,560
was there um anything else we want to talk about here with the playstation updates um yeah so i did

828
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:18,440
want to mention that they're also revamping the playstation store um i believe this is mainly

829
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:25,560
referring to their web and mobile store so they're removing playstation 3 playstation vita and

830
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:31,800
playstation portable um games and add-ons along with apps themes and avatars for those platforms

831
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,560
as well so apparently the web and mobile versions of the store um should be done removing those by

832
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:43,480
october 28th and then apparently if you need access to those after the fact you're gonna have

833
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:49,160
to access those through those devices so like the playstation 3 or whatnot um

834
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:56,440
i kind of wish it wasn't going that way because that kind of i mean you know with the whole

835
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:01,400
backwards compatibility stuff i guess they're just not going to support that stuff anymore

836
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:07,640
um i don't know i wonder how long until they just pull the plug all together on the psp store

837
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:14,280
and then the ps3 psp yeah i can understand a lot of that stuff um it's pretty old but

838
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:25,480
yeah it is unfortunate uh fifth dream in chat says rip psp yeah i i have a feeling that's coming uh

839
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,760
sooner than you might think that they're just going to pull the store all together on that

840
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,760
and decide not to run that anymore because it's probably just not worth it to them they're

841
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,000
probably not selling a lot although i would think the psp second hand market is still pretty big

842
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,600
i mean do those machines have a good lifespan i don't know like i mean

843
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:45,640
not with the batteries man all those batteries i think we talked about like oh yeah all the

844
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:54,280
i had to throw mine away well actually it's funny i had like um i had like four psp i had my psp

845
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:02,840
um 1.0 and then i had 2.0 and then my co-worker gave me two of his um psp's as well because they

846
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:09,160
were kind of defective or whatever use and i did just the disk drives on them didn't work but you

847
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:15,000
could still use them for like other games um but all of them all of the batteries i had are all

848
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,760
just complete trash now i'm like it's not worth it i don't care anymore i have i have i still have

849
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:28,120
my somewhere i i was looking for it earlier this week but um i still have my um my playstation tv

850
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:35,000
so um i mean i could play all that stuff on there i'm just have to find it i found my steam

851
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:41,160
or steam link but then not my playstation tv all right well let's move on and talk a little bit

852
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:45,720
about it's funny because i was talking about nino cooney and i kind of name check and bobby

853
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:50,200
blackwolf earlier in the show so maybe he's celebrating over this news i don't know but

854
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:55,800
i think this is kind of sad actually and that is that level five is uh pretty much done in

855
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:01,240
north america it sounds like um level five international america which was of course

856
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:07,800
uh the company that brought us nino cooney as well as yokai watch uh here in the north america

857
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,600
uh they're pretty much done and this is according to a report from gameindustry.biz

858
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,480
uh talking to multiple sources familiar with the matter uh they're saying that level five

859
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:24,280
international america and level five abby began winding down in mid-2019 which included laying off

860
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:34,760
the staff um so that they were let go uh and uh yeah apparently uh the coo yukari hayakawa who's

861
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:40,360
the coo of level five abby departed the company in early 2020 even though her linkedin has apparently

862
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:45,000
not been updated yet but i know a lot of people who have out-of-date linkedin so um what's what's

863
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:51,640
a ceo of a co of a company um so yeah apparently this is just saying that basically uh this could

864
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:56,360
be the end of level five releases in north america now i want to point out level five is still around

865
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:01,640
in japan this is again level five closing down their business in north america which could be

866
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:08,120
a sign that things like yokai watch and you know cooney were not maybe catching on as much as it

867
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:13,640
was hoped they would and i know especially in the case of yokai watch like they really pushed that

868
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:19,320
stuff hard and i didn't think that game was bad by any means uh but i was kind of surprised at

869
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:24,360
how much they were pushing you know the anime the toys and the game really hadn't proved itself yet

870
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,760
and i'm not sure it ever did at least here in america now i know in japan it was craziness

871
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,400
but even the craziness of that franchise in japan has died down a lot from what i understand so

872
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:39,400
i just don't think it was able to sustain itself in america anymore um so yeah any uh any releases

873
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:44,920
in north america apparently not happening because level five had said yokai watch 4 was going to

874
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:50,920
happen back in july 2019 but nothing has been said then since then there was also supposed to be a

875
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:59,320
version over here of inazuma 11 uh the hero's great road but again nothing here the last release from

876
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:06,040
level 5 in north america snack world the dungeon crawl gold which i never heard of but i know level

877
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:09,880
five did a lot of random dungeon crawlers like didn't they do an adventure time related one at

878
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:16,200
some point i think they did so i don't know um let's see and bobby blackwolf like to point out

879
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:22,600
i never celebrate closures so fair enough but you didn't help no i'm just i'm just i'm being a brat

880
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:31,640
akuma jp says oh eek they blow up on yokai watch yokai watch is not selling anymore here so yeah

881
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:35,800
so i thought i had heard that that it really kind of fizzled in japan it used to be a huge huge thing

882
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:41,240
and it kind of uh sj100 matt says this is surprising act dev says isn't level five behind

883
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:46,440
the latent series 2 oh i think you are right um but we haven't seen one of those games in a while

884
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:51,720
too and perhaps the end of the 3ds yes they could make those for switch but maybe they're just not

885
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,960
going to for whatever reason yeah this kind of came out of left field for me too i i thought

886
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:01,080
level five had some good stuff um i you know usually when i saw their name on a title i would

887
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:05,880
kind of give it a second look because i enjoyed their stuff you know despite the banter we have

888
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:11,480
going on i enjoyed nino kuni although i didn't ever pick up the sequel so maybe i'm part to blame

889
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:18,040
for that i tried yokai watch i didn't get into it as much but i never really beat a pokemon game

890
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:23,240
until finally pokemon shield finally uh broke that for me where i actually played that start

891
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:31,080
to finish and the end game so i don't know so anyhow uh yeah too bad to hear about that you

892
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:36,120
know again and like bobby said on a serious note note uh closures are nothing to celebrate about

893
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:41,240
this is sad news and you know especially for those of us that like to see a lot of the you know games

894
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:48,520
in japan released here as well um it's it's some sad news that's for sure so um is dark sakura

895
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:55,320
back by chance i don't know if she's just off i am okay hi hi sorry no i was uh i was eating a food

896
01:26:55,320 --> 01:27:00,280
oh you're fine i just wasn't sure if i needed to buy time or not but we can go to your story if

897
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:07,960
you're ready no i um my story is actually going to be probably the first one of this company's

898
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:15,480
products that i am going to buy oh please tell us more so there is um i'm sure we're all familiar

899
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:22,040
with analog analog is responsible for giving us their own a super famicon and super gen super

900
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:29,640
super genesis mega drive you know sega genesis etc um versions of it you know they've had 1080p

901
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:35,880
output and all of this beautiful stuff um they are now as i'm sure no one is surprised by this

902
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:44,840
i'm going to be doing a turbo duo um for the turbo graphics 16 slash pc engine with the you

903
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:51,720
know built-in duo add-on um it will come in a a white one like the japanese or a black one like

904
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:58,840
the us and it's gonna be 200 bucks which is actually pretty low priced for one of analog's

905
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:06,920
uh you know uh systems the other good thing about this one is that it is going to be able to play

906
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:15,160
um uh both uh regions a few cards it does not use software emulation um and instead uses field

907
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:22,520
programmable gate array chip um so it's basically simulating the game system by hardware um it will

908
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:30,120
be um arcade card ready it will run all turbo graphics 16 pc engine super graphics which of

909
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:36,200
course there were like what eight games that were released um uh pc engine cd rom 2 are

910
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:44,280
super arcade cd rom games so like i said arcade card games um and basically um it's also going

911
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:49,560
to have a wireless controller but it does have the nec port on it to allow you to use original

912
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:55,960
duo controllers and multitaps so um it also like i said it's going to support other bluetooth and

913
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:04,440
usb controllers um it uses hdmi so it will allow you it will output to 1080p um and given what

914
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:09,160
i've seen from the other outputs on other systems it's going to be pretty pretty awesome um it was

915
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:14,120
always nice and clear didn't they do that game boy that came out not that long ago that was

916
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:19,480
it was all over the internet yeah okay and of course it's going to have an add-on for that

917
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:27,400
thing for the analog pocket um it's going to have an adapter that lets you play um the other hue

918
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:34,600
cards the turbo graphics 16 super graphics and pc engine hue cards um and i mean that'll be that'll

919
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:40,120
be pretty nice i mean i have a turbo express and it's kind of difficult to play on i'll be

920
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:47,080
perfectly honest just don't play your shooter games on it um so it's i think it's really nice

921
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:56,520
and it's about time and i'll be honest you know i've been pricing a duo rx so that i um wouldn't

922
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:02,520
you know i have i basically have arcade card games that i can't play like i have a fatal

923
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:09,560
fury special i have strider and i can't play any of them um so this right here i was going to be

924
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:15,160
paying about 250 for my duo rx you know for one in a really good shape boxing you know everything

925
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:22,600
um the hue card converter that i want is almost always sold out and runs about 100 bucks by itself

926
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:32,040
i have a core graphics but i can't you know again play um duo games on it you know that i would need

927
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:38,040
the core graphics in the duo and then the arcade card and i can't use those cards on my us duo

928
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:45,960
because the pin set was different so um this right here is going to eliminate a couple of

929
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:50,520
other products that i would have been spending money on i mean i was seriously looking to spend

930
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:56,600
like roughly 300 350 to get to do rx and get myself the us u card converter so we just had

931
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:03,640
the one system um so this right here is i think it'd be a fantastic deal i can plug it in um on

932
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:11,080
my hd uh you know my nice fantabulous 4k tv and um not have any input lag which is one of the

933
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:17,320
biggest problems with playing retro systems on modern televisions right so you know could the

934
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:22,040
limited availability of this be an issue because bobby is speaking up on this a lot in chat saying

935
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:26,120
this was cool until they said limited quantities which means nobody will actually be able to get

936
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:30,520
one i really question their business practices if they can't actually meet the demand at the price

937
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:35,080
they quote this sounds great for the boders that will buy and flip it on ebay just like the last

938
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:41,160
analog plot product i learned to never hype for them well i mean it works for nintendo all t l

939
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:51,400
shade um i might be reaching out to a potential contact um to bring up uh i'm hoping because i

940
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:58,600
want to do like a full review of it um so i'm i'm gonna be trying to do some some reaching out and

941
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:04,120
seeing who i can talk to and well you know to to be fair yay for you if that works out but

942
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:09,800
the point still stands that you know it's it's way too limited and why is it so damn limited

943
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,560
if the demand is a bit higher you know and i think there's going to be another release

944
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,840
if well let's hold out let's hope but i guess maybe the track record hasn't really spoke

945
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,920
kindly for that because that would be really unfortunate if it just becomes a thing that

946
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:28,200
scalpers on ebay kind of get it would be nice to see the company maybe do some sort of you can sign

947
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,680
up to pre-order one or something like that you know kind of trying to figure out that system

948
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:39,160
because the popularity and the fact that you know the these products have been all around the news

949
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:43,960
sphere when it comes to video games they've been all over social media and everybody is saying

950
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,440
these look really cool it's a compliment to the company and everything but surely the company's

951
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:51,720
got to kind of realize that it puts a certain demand out there and if they can't meet that

952
01:32:51,720 --> 01:33:00,840
demand it could it could backfire if that that's that's a good point but but i you know

953
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:07,720
i want to see if maybe we can reach out and see if maybe we can talk to the people there and see

954
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:12,200
if they're going to be doing anything to combat that you know the the big scalper resale because

955
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:18,440
i mean it's it's certainly a possibility um and i know that it'd be a big problem in the end they

956
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:24,760
make their money so it is what it is yeah but it's up to us to not buy from scalpers but

957
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,280
we all know like we can sit here and say that till we're blue in the face but there's going

958
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:34,360
to be somebody that sits on top of their mansion and you know beverly hills that has the screaming

959
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:39,160
child mommy mommy mommy i saw this on the internet i want one buy it buy it and so they just go on

960
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:43,640
ebay and get it you know and it's okay veruca yeah well i mean and that's that's the problem

961
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:47,000
is that we can sit here and say we're gonna we're not gonna support it right it's trash

962
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,440
but the veruca's of the world are gonna and the enabling parents are gonna ruin it

963
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:57,960
yeah so it stinks we'll see but i i do think to be fair i think this is a problem bigger than

964
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:03,800
just this company this is a problem we're seeing all over the place you know in this industry and

965
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:08,760
fifth dream says cough ps5 cough you know we had all the issues with the pre-orders there as well

966
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:16,600
and so on so i i i kind of get it so all right um let's move on though for now um just for time's

967
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,960
sake i can't spend too much time on one topic because we had such a great um kickoff topic

968
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:24,040
that went on for a while but let's move on to our next topic because this is this is i mean

969
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:29,720
this is huge this this in a normal week could have been a whole three hour show to itself right well

970
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:38,520
i think it's huge it says it's so this right here by itself is not much so basically what the deal

971
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:44,520
is is game stop and microsoft had entered into a multi-year strategic partnership um that's going

972
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:49,400
to basically outfit their stores with surface tablets and it's also going to revamp their whole

973
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:56,120
pos system as well um allowing them to use like microsoft 365 and teams and stuff like that

974
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:02,520
also with that though they're also doing some sort of it's not really in great detail yet but

975
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:09,320
they're doing some sort of partnership where it'll allow them to sell digital products that are on

976
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:15,080
the microsoft store and actually get a cut or i'm sorry no what's going to happen is i hear is

977
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:21,160
that they're going to be getting a cut of any of the digital sales from consoles that they sell

978
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:27,480
so for example if they sell some xbox series x those consoles that they sell any users that buy

979
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:34,520
those and make purchases they get like a percentage of that which is interesting here's what i think

980
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:40,680
is happening from what i was hearing so if they think about it though like you know they're giving

981
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:47,000
them all this access to these things how far away do you think we are from microsoft buying out game

982
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,600
stuff because they're they're struggling money-wise right now they're really struggling to to stay

983
01:35:54,600 --> 01:36:01,480
afloat and so i'm wondering if we're not far enough or not that far away from an acquisition

984
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:05,720
well and you know the other interesting thing that i haven't seen in any of the stories talking

985
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:14,600
about this what just happened like four months ago microsoft stores started scaling back significantly

986
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:23,960
yeah so this has been in the works for a little bit why why would they you know i think that was

987
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,480
the first thing because we kind of at the time we're like well this seems kind of i mean i guess

988
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:31,720
it must be related to the pandemic and that's sad and all this stuff but now it's kind of like oh

989
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:36,040
shit they scaled back the microsoft stores because they knew they were going to be getting into the

990
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:42,360
game stops basically everywhere with this whole thing um now again uh you know it's not like

991
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:46,680
you're suddenly it's going to be microsoft exclusive at those places that's not the case

992
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:52,040
you can still buy a playstation 5 you can still buy a switch but it is definitely going to put

993
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:59,080
a little pressure on the folks that work there the management which will trickle down to the workers

994
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:06,120
that hey if we make continued money off of microsoft's uh sales on an xbox series s now

995
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:10,840
we know why game stop would fucking bother to carry them because now they're going to be getting

996
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:18,360
a revenue based off of the the digital sales and on the playstation 5 discless ones there is no

997
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:23,880
reason for game stop to have any of those they probably will have one or two per store but

998
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:30,680
there's really no reason for them to carry them or or maybe you know it i would i would think that

999
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:34,840
there might be an acquisition being that they're they've been closing stores left and right and

1000
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:39,720
they've been in trouble for a while and the pandemic hasn't really helped them out um but

1001
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:47,160
the very least maybe it's just microsoft recognizing this company um needs some

1002
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:52,440
infrastructure upgrades and they're just doing a partnership with them in that sense and on top of

1003
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:57,800
that they're also going to try to push their consoles and um i don't know i don't know if

1004
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:03,880
they're necessarily going to buy them out i mean we'll see it'll be interesting to see what happens

1005
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:09,320
with this but i know that financially i don't think they're doing very well um with the pandemic

1006
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:13,800
and everything i find this comment from questposter really fascinating um because i really agree with

1007
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:19,880
it uh saying game stop stock is up 120 plus percent for the year but not because of this news

1008
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:26,200
some analysts don't think that this is that huge since the winner is mainly microsoft

1009
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:32,840
seemingly taking advantage of a weak game stop to push people into their ecosystem hell yeah they

1010
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:38,280
are and it's it's it's a brilliant move by my it's straight up genius by microsoft i'm sorry like

1011
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:45,160
that's it that's that's what it is because now when it comes to the holidays and the lost parents

1012
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:51,000
that are like what do i get my kid my kid's been talking about xbox and playstation i don't know

1013
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:59,000
the difference although again i think the parents of today grew up on the same stuff i mean we're

1014
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,520
old enough to be the parents now loki is a parent many of you out there listening are so i'm not

1015
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:08,840
sure this is always going to be the case but i think still in some parts of the country in some

1016
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,960
areas you're going to have people to walk into the game stop going i i know my kid wants this

1017
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:19,080
but i don't know what i need to get like the default answer is going to be pushing towards

1018
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:25,800
microsoft products now and that is a brilliant move on microsoft's part uh right yeah so they'll

1019
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:31,080
have two different friends because i think also when you like there's a definite value propositions

1020
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:39,560
be made with you know the xbox platforms um i'm just curious to see what sony's going to answer

1021
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:43,720
back with as far as like what they're offering i just don't think playstation now is going to be

1022
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:49,240
enough to cut it and i'm sorry like cool that you're giving away a few games with playstation

1023
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:56,600
plus but that's not the same as the entire library that's in games pass i mean it's just not the same

1024
01:39:56,600 --> 01:40:04,360
well you know and i i don't want to base the reality based off of what i see on social media

1025
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:09,480
but it doesn't seem like sony's exactly struggling like it seems like plenty of people are still

1026
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:14,280
pre-ordering a playstation 5 and there's plenty of games on there that people want to play and

1027
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:18,520
i think that is sony's biggest strength still is that they do have this very strong first party

1028
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:24,120
titles still and they're gonna have that you know for some time but you know as i've been saying

1029
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:28,520
until i'm blue in the face on the show for a long time now don't count off microsoft this time

1030
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:34,520
around and akuma jp in chat is saying i wonder if japan will be able to play bethesda games now

1031
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:40,600
um akuma the reality is and i realize you're gonna laugh at this and microsoft still thinks

1032
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:46,840
they can succeed in japan um but they're playing the long game it's not something that's necessarily

1033
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:53,080
going to happen tomorrow and part of succeeding in japan is really starting to turn the heads here

1034
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:58,520
in the states and then i think they're gonna hope that that carries out but i the quickest way to do

1035
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:03,560
it and you know we've been saying this forever is is still shocked that microsoft didn't just

1036
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:09,560
fucking outright buy sega or um konami or somebody that is feels a little bit vulnerable in the

1037
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:15,080
japanese market and i kind of think that's the big that's the big grand finale that's the big

1038
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:21,880
symbol clash that ends 2020 is that microsoft's gonna buy a japanese company i think but we'll see

1039
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:30,760
yeah still time dj rama s in chat says microsoft will not succeed in japan

1040
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:35,880
because they don't have any japanese game studios under their belt yet

1041
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,760
they don't have any under their belt yet

1042
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:49,000
and i think i laugh laugh in my face if you want but let's revisit this in a year and see what

1043
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:56,600
happens we shall see we shall see all right for now though let's move on and talk about some

1044
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:04,200
upgrades uh for the xbox 360 that's right the the older system the xbox 360 cloud saves are now

1045
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:08,920
going to be free so you can actually just get your saves in the cloud for free this was something that

1046
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:14,600
you had to have xbox gold for before oh look at that another xbox gold feature just getting

1047
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:23,800
absorbed into something else huh huh huh anyway it's gonna be free now on the xbox 360 because

1048
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,760
they want people to have their savings in the clouds to feel a little more like they can get

1049
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:34,840
an xbox series s or a series x because you know some people just skip the xbox one outright in

1050
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:40,760
fact a lot of people did that may have owned the 360 but maybe now the series s or x is going to

1051
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:46,600
look at bringing them back so how can they transfer their maybe they have a file in oblivion

1052
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:52,520
that they've spent 200 hours on so they want to be able to move that over to the xbox series x

1053
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:59,640
because we know that series x and s are going to be backwards compatible uh pretty richly uh if

1054
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:04,520
it's uh something you can play on the xbox one today you'll be able to play it on the xbox series

1055
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:10,680
x now if it has enhancements or not we'll get into that a little later um but it it will be

1056
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:16,200
nice that you know and it's not all the systems do this so it will be nice that hey even if you

1057
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:22,120
are skipping a generation so you're on xbox 360 now you skip the one and you go your games are

1058
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:27,080
still going to be backwards compatible mostly there are some 360 games that don't work as we

1059
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:32,520
all know but the big ones they they figured out and the ones that you probably have a 200 hour

1060
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:37,400
save file on probably uh figure that one out how to make it backwards compatible so that's kind of

1061
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:44,280
neat um but i also think it's kind of funny that uh they figured out a way to just completely um

1062
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:52,120
absorb yet another xbox live gold feature into something else so anyway uh now let's talk a

1063
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:57,080
little bit more back about those backwards compatibility games because it came out this week

1064
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:06,920
that there's going to be 31 series x or s optimized games on day one so obviously because

1065
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:13,000
halo isn't making the release day a lot of the strength that microsoft's trying to push for

1066
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:20,680
their launch day windows is upgrades of older games so um let me read you some of the highlights

1067
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:27,640
i'm not going to read them all assassin's greed vahala borderlands 3 dead by daylight dirt 5

1068
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:36,360
uh the falconeer forza horizon 4 gears 5 gears tactics grounded manifold garden or in the will

1069
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:43,880
of the wisp planet coaster sea of thieves tetris effect connected the tourist uh watchdogs legion

1070
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:49,640
yakuza like a dragon uh and so on again that's just a selection of the 31 games there that are

1071
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:56,120
going to be available on day one so this is kind of microsoft's strategy is not just the new new

1072
01:44:56,120 --> 01:45:00,920
stuff like vahala is a new game so not just that but then also like here are the older games and

1073
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:06,280
even i kind of went oh shit i can't wait to play forza horizon 4 on the xbox series x that's going

1074
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:10,120
to be awesome and now hearing that they've bumped it up a little bit you know i don't know exactly

1075
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:15,000
what that looks like but i imagine that's going to be some higher res texture and probably some

1076
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,480
yeah it's going to be a real smooth frame rate i'm sure so i that game's going to be pretty badass

1077
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:27,880
i think so excited for that so we'll see uh we're getting to less than a month away now if you can

1078
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:33,640
believe it before the new consoles both xbox series x and s and the new playstation fives are

1079
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:38,520
out pretty much in the same week and it's what the 10th and the 12th right did i get those dates

1080
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:44,600
right the 10th is the xbox the 12th in the playstation i know the 10th is the xbox i can't

1081
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:48,920
remember the place i think it's the 12th so they're right they're right on top of

1082
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:53,160
each other practically and we're less than a month away so uh yeah pretty exciting times

1083
01:45:53,160 --> 01:46:00,520
that's for sure all right how about dark sakura what's next well i've made no secret one of my

1084
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:07,880
favorite games ever is fantasy zone and there is a game being released that is an homage to fantasy

1085
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:17,240
zone called endless zone um it actually has come out uh a couple of days ago it's on pc via steam

1086
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:23,000
and it's part of sega's 60th anniversary um and it's only going to be available until the 19th

1087
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:33,560
until tomorrow so um basically it is you know pretty much just like fantasy zone but you play

1088
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:40,040
instead of as the opa opa you have op bot um who was a field surgeon and organ recovery specialist

1089
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:48,840
and then one day he was on the run and he has to flee and exist so go check it out because

1090
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:54,680
i i noticed it didn't look very cartoony either i had a very different kind of gritty look to it

1091
01:46:54,680 --> 01:47:01,400
it was like fantasy zone rated r kind of look to it it's still you know i mean part of what i liked

1092
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:05,800
about fantasy zone was the the cuteness and the happy music and it's fucking hard as balls

1093
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:11,640
but um but i mean still it's snowmaj remember how the super mario brothers movie was supposed

1094
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:16,360
to be kind of gritty and industrial that's what i kind of got looking at endless zone

1095
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:19,480
well i don't know about the terrible part i didn't play endless zone i'm sure it's fine

1096
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:28,040
it reminds me of like those like um oh what was it like the the xbox 360 arcade games that they

1097
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:33,000
were making like of the classic arcade games and oh they're kind of like kind of redone or like if

1098
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,120
we want to talk a little bit more crystal quest was like gritty whenever you talk a little bit

1099
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:45,240
more like recent um you know kind of similar to the stuff that we see now on uh the amico

1100
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:53,240
where like these classic games are kind of getting that uh you know higher res i don't know they still

1101
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:58,600
look like xbox arcade games um you know where it's like they don't know what to do with the

1102
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:02,360
sprites so they just kind of make them a little bit more realistic and they come off looking like

1103
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:09,720
not really a flash game but just i don't know different but yeah this looks kind of like that

1104
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:17,160
okay yeah excited that was uh the week we missed was that whole uh in television stuff that came

1105
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:23,960
out um that was uh the week that i was out um but uh i don't know like i i could see the thing is

1106
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:29,320
though we we say all that but i also kind of go i liked a lot of those early xbox arcade games i

1107
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:35,320
actually played them a lot you know they kind of throw me back to a period of the atari 2600 when

1108
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:40,200
you know i just that that repetition and that same z type of game was a lot of fun to play

1109
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:44,280
it was something very zen about it so like i kind of look at the stuff for the intellivision i'm

1110
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:51,560
like looks like it could be interesting so maybe yeah all right well let's move on and talk about

1111
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:56,600
um loki what you have for us next i'm sorry you just picked up stella too and she's looking all

1112
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:02,920
adorable on your shoulder being ready to start screaming at me again oh uh so as we know with

1113
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:08,360
games getting bigger and bigger um you know especially with call of duty there's been a lot

1114
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:15,800
of different stories about how uh call of duty is too large like their updates are like 150

1115
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:21,400
gigabytes it's just ridiculous so now they're saying that there's going to be um some sort of

1116
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:27,240
updates done to the pc version that's actually going to let you uninstall portions of the game

1117
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:34,680
so apparently you can uninstall 100 gigabytes of stuff the game right now call duty modern warfare

1118
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:45,480
on pc it takes up 232 gigabytes of space i mean that's that's ridiculous yeah uh but apparently

1119
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:49,480
though is i know one of the things that people have been requesting especially for like even

1120
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:54,520
the console versions or um you know talking about what these new consoles coming out even though

1121
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:59,320
they have large hard drives i mean like that's like a 20% of your hard drive right there it's

1122
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:04,120
ridiculous so they're going to split it up so you can actually uninstall like the campaign

1123
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:10,360
multiplayer spec ops that type of stuff so campaign's 35 gigabytes multiplayer is 42

1124
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,920
spec ops is going to be 38 so you can pretty much like pick your installation size

1125
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:25,000
um based on what you want in there which they have to do when the game is that large it's ridiculous

1126
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,800
yeah that's and especially you know we're looking at we're getting into the new

1127
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:35,480
era of gaming with playstation 5 and xbox series x and so on and the drives really didn't get that

1128
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:40,200
much bigger like you know i know the xbox is shipping with a one terabyte drive well big

1129
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:45,160
fucking deal that's what my xbox one has in it now so and considering we're looking at 4k games

1130
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:51,960
so i mean when you talk about a game that's eaten up 250 gigs of that that's that's too much right

1131
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:59,960
and well at the very least like with these drives um you can uninstall stuff and also there's the

1132
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:05,720
external stuff that you can get for it as well yeah the two terabyte drives that they sell aren't

1133
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:09,880
overpriced which is good it is pretty much on par with which you'd pay for

1134
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:16,280
that type of storage but they're still expensive yes but you're right they're on par but they're

1135
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:26,360
not cheap right so it's just unfortunately it's gonna be you know i i would hope that with this

1136
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:33,000
because i know some of these games are a little bit blown up in size because of these slow read

1137
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:39,800
speeds or read rate speeds of these um storage devices that they have that they're not able to

1138
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:45,160
they have to kind of have redundant information in order to be able to read it quickly and maybe

1139
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:50,680
with these drive speeds speeding up to the point where accessing data from any location on the

1140
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:56,280
drive is going to be super quick that they can cut down on the redundancies and maybe even compress

1141
01:51:56,280 --> 01:52:03,080
even more and have you know the dedicated processors to uncompress that as quickly as

1142
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:08,920
possible um maybe with that and advancements with their the storage and everything you'll cut down

1143
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:12,440
but then you're going to also get higher fidelity graphics which will then offset it back to where

1144
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:19,320
we are you know so i don't know i just i hope that they do end up taking options like this

1145
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:24,600
when it is unavoidable that the game is going to be this large that at least chunk it up so that

1146
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:31,400
if for example i'm not interested in playing special ops i don't have to install that 38

1147
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:38,600
gigabyte portion of the file right all right well let's move on and talk about uh some unfortunate

1148
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:44,920
news for blizzard is that they recently i think in the week we were off or i can't time is blending

1149
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:49,720
together now but they within the past couple weeks uh recently closed their office in france

1150
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:56,280
so there was an office in versailles um i say that right thank you versailles uh blizzard

1151
01:52:56,280 --> 01:53:00,600
recently had to shut their office in versailles down and that means that was 100 of jobs that

1152
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:08,520
were lost in the middle of a pandemic nonetheless so in comes some unions to try to uh try to

1153
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:17,480
stop this i guess uh so uh some different unions cgt specus unsa and cfe cgc remember we're

1154
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:21,640
talking about france so some of those acronyms are actually french uh they're actually saying

1155
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:27,800
that blizzard denied they had plans to close the office and they act they say that no blizzard's in

1156
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:33,000
fact planning this for a long time and they lied about it uh this comes as a shock for employees

1157
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,800
who are not expecting this announcement in 15 years many of us left their homes from across

1158
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:42,920
europe and beyond to join the company people truly invested their whole lives into blizzard's

1159
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:51,080
success so with this uh loss uh 285 jobs are going to be lost with this apparently blizzard

1160
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:57,400
had tried to cut 133 jobs in france when they cut the jobs in america because blizzard laid off

1161
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:03,160
hundreds in america this last i think it was in 2019 some of y'all might have forgot but the

1162
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:08,360
court stopped them so and then they weren't able to do it in march either so maybe because they

1163
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:11,640
were stopped to do it i don't know maybe they just said you know what then we're just going

1164
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:18,040
to close the office all together uh don't know but unions are demanding blizzard stop the closure

1165
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:25,800
develop the europe office and uh invest in prevention of psychosocial risks so um not a lot

1166
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:33,800
of good news on that front but it is interesting that um they tried to do some layoffs and were

1167
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:38,360
stopped and so now they're just like well fuck it we'll close the whole office that part's kind of

1168
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:44,600
interesting um but you know it doesn't seem like blizzard is exactly struggling either they're

1169
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:49,000
getting ready to release a big world of warcraft expansion i know that pre-patch went out and it's

1170
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,920
a pretty big deal it's probably the biggest changes the game has seen since the cataclysm

1171
01:54:52,920 --> 01:55:00,200
expansion um you know but uh i guess maybe they don't have a new game out yet like nothing on the

1172
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:06,360
level of diablo 4 overwatch 2 to really rake things in but i would think during a pandemic

1173
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:10,520
this is a time when a lot of game companies are flourishing depending on how they're playing their

1174
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:17,960
cards so hmm so we'll see if the unions are able to make anything of this but um i don't know i

1175
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:22,280
have a feeling blizzard might have because of what happened previously might have just said you know

1176
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:27,080
what it's more cost effective for us to just shut down the whole office um but still my heart goes

1177
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:31,960
out to those folks that are affected and uh it's never easy to hear about that especially for that

1178
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:38,440
many people so all right well let's move back to a simpler time shall we we're gonna take a step

1179
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:44,040
down memory lane and talk a little bit about some classic games so every week dark soccer steps into

1180
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:50,520
the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you brats should check this game out it's the

1181
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:59,160
classic game of the week so dark sakura what did you find for us this week um i found some dew

1182
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:08,520
oh really do mr dew yet again so thank him for that but again a game that i cannot believe we

1183
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:13,480
have never featured because i remember playing the shit out of this game at the local yogurt shop

1184
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:17,880
because they had to play the dew out of it yes i did they had a cocktail cabinet of this and i

1185
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:23,000
used to play it a lot ice plays on the clico all the time yeah my favorite games that was actually

1186
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,920
something we brought up that there had been the clique of vision version which i i've got too

1187
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:37,240
um so yeah mr dew it is a maze arcade game it was uh developed and published by universal in 1982

1188
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:44,200
it is the first of the mr dew series and um it would sorry it was also one of the first arcade

1189
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:50,200
games to have been released as a conversion kit by taito and it went on to sell 30 000 units in

1190
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:59,720
the us um the object well as dan actually was saying earlier it's dig dug on crack um the object

1191
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:04,680
is to score as many points by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries

1192
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:10,920
mr dew now in the japanese version he was originally a snowman in the us he is a clown

1193
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:16,680
which is probably why i am not the biggest fan of of mr dew because i think clowns are scary

1194
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:25,000
as crap um but anyway um he is chased by these red monsters called creeps and you lose a life

1195
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,600
if mr dew gets uh gets caught so the game is over when you've lost your last life easy peasy

1196
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:37,800
the cherries are all over um the level in groups of eight um you get 500 points if you collect

1197
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:42,760
eight cherries in a row without stopping um the level is complete when you've either collected

1198
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:51,080
all the cherries destroyed all the creeps spell extra or you find a diamond um he can defeat the

1199
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:57,960
creeps by bouncing a power ball on them and um but he is defenseless while he while the wall is in

1200
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:04,840
play you know kind of like when diggy duggy puts out his you know puffy blow thingy that sounded

1201
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:11,960
bad anyway um he can also push uh an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel to crush a creep

1202
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:18,840
kind of like in dig dug how you do the you know the the rock um and then the creeps can transform

1203
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:25,960
into powerful multi-colored monsters that can travel through the ground and if it digs through

1204
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:30,200
a cherry then it leaves fewer cherries and therefore fewer points for mr dew to collect

1205
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:37,880
and if it digs under an apple it will and it's suicide or it can uh drop that apple on mr dew

1206
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:44,920
and mr dew is apparently allergic to apples and will die um you if you pass the score threshold

1207
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:51,240
um uh typically 5000 points a letter for extra will appear on the screen as an apple monster

1208
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:57,080
you have to defeat the monster and then you can uh gather uh your letter and um

1209
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:02,920
if you collect all five letters and you get a cut scene that plays the the theme to astro boy

1210
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:09,400
and you get an extra life um they will eat any apples that they encounter so it makes them

1211
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:15,480
very difficult to crush um the creeps will spawn at the center of the screen and after they have

1212
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:21,320
all appeared then their generator will turn into a food item so you can get bonus points and freeze

1213
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:29,800
the creeps and call up the apple monster and do other stuff um and sometimes dropping an apple

1214
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:34,680
will get you a diamond so if you collect it within 15 seconds it lets you skip past the

1215
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:42,280
level and you get 8 000 points so you also will then get a free game um it was uh developed by

1216
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:49,080
ueda um kazutoshi i don't really know too much about him so there were a bunch of courts of

1217
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:56,520
course there was the atari 2600 atari 8-bit uh computer family uh kalika vision as we mentioned

1218
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:09,320
before um apple 2 msx neo geo uh tomy tutor and the commodore 64 um there also was a handheld lcd

1219
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:17,160
version that was also released by tomy in 1983 now with the kalika version there were some some

1220
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:21,000
changes made to it so if you play that one and then go and play the arcade version you're going

1221
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,880
to notice a little bit difference the alpha monsters and sidekicks are unable to eat apples

1222
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:32,040
so they are easier to crush the blue monsters will eat your shrubbery and cherries um also

1223
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:38,600
if an alpha monster is over a letter that has already been acquired then the dinosaur monsters

1224
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:49,720
will just freeze um so uh in japan um for this uh for sorry the june 15th 1983 issue of game machine

1225
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:58,200
mr du was listed as uh the 21st most successful table arcade unit of the year um famicon sushin

1226
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:06,680
awarded the super famicon version of this uh 25 out of 40 um and lots of folks for egm thought

1227
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:11,320
it was was really great um so yeah as far as those other versions i don't know if i mentioned

1228
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:18,360
but yeah there was the uh super famicom snus version um there were other sequels there was

1229
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:28,520
mr du's castle in 1983 mr du's wild ride and do run run haha in 1984 there's expanded 99 level

1230
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:33,800
version of mr du that was released in arcades by electric coin in 1989 there is a new version

1231
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:41,640
called neo mr du uh developed by visco and it was licensed by uh universal for snk neo geo

1232
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:48,280
1997 i believe i have played that one um was mr du also edgy like those old xbox arcade games

1233
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:56,040
nah it's colorful and bright and pretty um mr du was adapted to the gameboy and super famicon

1234
02:01:56,040 --> 02:02:01,080
also had different um gameplay features there's a rebranded adaption of the game that came for

1235
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:06,040
gameboy color it was called quest fantasy challenge holy magic century in europe

1236
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:11,880
developed by imagineer published by sunsoft and uh in for north america and virgin interactive in

1237
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:17,240
europe and it's in the quest series of games instead of mr du there the arcade version was

1238
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:26,200
on we virtual console in japan and april 27th uh uh 2010 so there you go mr du also a game that

1239
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:32,680
had the same name in the u.s in japan how was the sequel not called number two mr duty

1240
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:40,360
because some people are grown-ups rob oh okay uh let's see bobby blackwolf in chat says a port is

1241
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:44,840
a port of course of course unless that port is all borked of course we call it mr du

1242
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:52,200
wamp i remember the commodore 64 version of this because of course i do um and it was uh it was

1243
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:56,920
a lot of fun it played a lot like the arcade it's really it's it's harder than dig dug in

1244
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:03,000
my opinion like um i'm i'm not bad at dig dug like i can get like more than 10 boards

1245
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,880
in and dig dug mr du i don't know if i can do that in this game it's it's pretty challenging

1246
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:14,760
check out that awesome cut scene they have though right here where uh the extra life is awarded and

1247
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:18,760
the little i guess that's a creep a dinosaur i don't know i don't even recognize what that

1248
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:24,360
monster is uh waves the red or the white flag i was like why is he trying to attack the uh

1249
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:31,720
the dinosaurs from bubble bobble i don't know but it is uh dig dug on crack so did you ever notice

1250
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:35,640
as you're collecting the cherries it plays this little sequence if you cool i don't think the guy

1251
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:39,880
in the demo we're watching here is doing it fast enough but if you collect the eight cherries it

1252
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:45,160
goes do do do do do do do like it does a do re mi all the way and then if you get it all the way

1253
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:49,640
the end you actually get like a bonus i always thought that kind of interest that little musical

1254
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:54,760
cue was really cute and interesting and something that again i know a lot of people really equate

1255
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:59,720
this to dig dug because it is a digging game but they're very different they are very very

1256
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:05,480
different in the way they play yeah but there's enough similarity that the the comparison makes

1257
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:13,880
sense i like that fifth dream do re mi mr do forget it what if we don't know it makes sense

1258
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:17,080
what if we were calling it wrong the whole time and it was mr do

1259
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:25,640
it's mr do it's when you read the the kana for it it's do so i guess i believe you all right

1260
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:32,120
there it is your classic game of the week mr do uh which i guess was given to us by proxy via dan

1261
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:40,120
um but thanks too well and you brought me up you like you've played this before though at least

1262
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:49,160
jamie right a couple of times at least on multiple variouses so yeah all right well let's

1263
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:53,320
get into some rapid fire news that was a good choice again it was one of those games i'm like

1264
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:59,400
how are we 800 plus episodes in and we've never done mr do because i know i i played as shit i'm

1265
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:02,600
surprised in one of the weeks you weren't here i didn't pick it but i guess i just never thought

1266
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:08,520
of it there you go probably thought it was already chosen before i probably did all right that's

1267
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:14,520
that's the joy i did a search for mr do on the page for the classic game i didn't find it i

1268
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:19,160
remember having done it i searched for do and there was like 800 results i was like okay i

1269
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:23,640
searched for mr and there was one result you picked a mr something else way back when but

1270
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:30,600
it wasn't mr do it was something else some other mr mr driller uh maybe probably yeah no i don't

1271
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:34,440
even think it was that now i have to go look all right well anyway uh let's move on though we got

1272
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:39,480
some rapid fire news coming your way so loki start us off please yeah so this is kind of

1273
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:45,640
interesting so uh sorry mr important update mr mosquito was the game thank you no one special

1274
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:54,520
yeah yeah now i remember yeah um sega has decided to release a prototype version of a cancelled

1275
02:05:54,520 --> 02:06:03,800
golden axe game um for their sega 60th anniversary um calling it golden axe a cancelled prototype

1276
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:10,600
um apparently it was a game that's being developed by sega studios australia back in 2013

1277
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:21,800
and it's a 2.5d remake of the classic series the it's kind of being met with mixed uh reception

1278
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:28,760
because the game itself while it was cancelled apparently while it was in development was under

1279
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:36,040
a lot of crunch and so it's bringing up uh bad memories from that but it is interesting to be

1280
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:41,320
able to check out something that it was um in development at one time if you want to check it

1281
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:47,640
out for free you can find it on steam um and it actually got released today for a limited time

1282
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:53,560
so go check it out while you can neat um i wish they maybe were a little more respectful in how

1283
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:58,120
they went about doing it but i think it's cool that like companies are willing to put out these

1284
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:02,120
you know demos and products that didn't really see the light of day i think it's pretty cool

1285
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:08,920
yeah um and then of course i've been looking forward to a minecraft movie but unfortunately

1286
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:13,480
that's not going to be coming out anytime soon release has been pushed back for the foreseeable

1287
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:20,840
future so originally it's supposed to be coming out in 2022 however the latest release from

1288
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:27,640
warner brothers their production schedule does not now list it on um their production schedule as a

1289
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:32,440
movie that will be coming out in the near future here um of course you know they have other movies

1290
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:39,160
that are coming out as well a fourth matrix movie the new suicide squad the batman dune black adam

1291
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:45,800
so there's a lot on their plate and unfortunately minecraft is not part of that as of right now

1292
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:50,360
why not god you think there's a pandemic going on or you would think you would think you'd be

1293
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:57,240
a good idea but i don't know hopefully it's still popular in a few years movies are a little harder

1294
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:03,960
to make right now i guess especially when they're well too so oh that'd be a little less i would

1295
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:08,360
think but i don't know i hope it's not live action that would be terrible no i think it's an anime

1296
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:14,840
movie actually having followed a couple of behind the scenes just for current tv production um they

1297
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:19,880
have some crazy rules that they have to follow to maintain safe uh safety on set and quarantine so

1298
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:25,720
that would make sense for any kind of movie filming especially anything that's uh that's uh

1299
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:29,640
studio based you know what i mean instead of a location and i don't think i talked about an

1300
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:34,600
olr but i did an indie movie actually it's it's it's like a um it's like a film festival it's

1301
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:39,880
gonna be online but i did uh a thing so i had to do a movie set basically uh it was that you know

1302
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:44,840
small indie type of thing but still so uh and that was during all this that was just uh about

1303
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:49,960
a month ago that i did that so because i think that's coming out next week and honestly it could

1304
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:55,320
be that i don't know like what you know just because it's not listed now doesn't mean maybe

1305
02:08:55,480 --> 02:09:00,920
they just don't know where it's gonna go yet um the furthest date out that they have right now

1306
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:08,840
is shazam fury of the gods which is uh moving from november 4 2022 to june 2nd 2023 um

1307
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:17,160
so i mean it still could be somewhere they just don't have a date for it yet i mean i don't know

1308
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:23,000
we'll we'll see i mean it's still a long ways out anyways even if it wasn't being delayed all right

1309
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,640
well moving on to talk about xbox game pass and some pretty interesting additions coming to that

1310
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:32,840
uh lucasfilm uh or excuse me not lucasfilm lucasarts which you know is part of that i guess

1311
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:40,200
but lucas art remastered classics uh are coming to xbox game pass so sadly not the actual classics

1312
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:46,200
that would have been rad on pc game pass uh but we get the remasters which are cool in their own

1313
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:52,520
own right so we're getting full throttle grim fandango and day of the tentacle um so you can

1314
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:58,680
play these remasters on xbox pc or android with cloud syncing and all that cool stuff um so yeah

1315
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:03,640
these games of course all originally came out in the 1990s but then they were redone later on when

1316
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:07,800
double fine entertainment bought the rights to those titles and went on to remaster them

1317
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:13,640
uh microsoft of course remember bought double fine remember that so this is those rewards

1318
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:19,080
coming back now so uh yeah there you go these games are going to be hitting game pass on october 29th

1319
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:23,640
i'll i'll be checking them out for sure because i think i played i think i played the day of

1320
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:27,320
the tentacle but that was the only one i checked out so i want to check out the other ones uh for

1321
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:34,920
sure and uh in a bit of a developer shuffle around uh changing news uh crackdown 2 the developers

1322
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:42,280
behind that game ruffian games is now operating as rockstar dun d because they are joining

1323
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:47,560
uh all the other rockstar studios i don't know what they're working on but you can imagine that

1324
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:55,320
crackdown 2 was some would say the last decent crackdown game oh so right loki i mean it was

1325
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:02,840
unfortunately that that is a true statement yeah so uh who knows what they're doing uh this studio

1326
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:07,720
though they had ported and remastered the old halo games so maybe they're making sure that

1327
02:11:07,720 --> 02:11:12,760
grand theft auto 5 is running on new consoles or maybe red dead redemption um who knows or maybe

1328
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:16,280
they are going to be working on something we've been working on the agent game that we've been

1329
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:22,840
promised for decades oh god right uh and and who knows maybe they're working on something new

1330
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:26,840
that's kind of inspired by crackdown series a little bit like you know they could kind of do

1331
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:32,520
something a little different so who knows finally get the sequel to rockstar's table tennis it's

1332
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:39,560
coming hey that game was awesome all right dar sagra what do you have i have a mute button

1333
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:45,800
apparently um but also um a little bit more news about um rock band 4 it's going to be

1334
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:56,520
a completely compatible with ps5 and xbox series x um it is uh basically you know they're wanting

1335
02:11:56,520 --> 02:12:01,320
to keep it up to date so that they can keep playing it with the newer ones and then of course

1336
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:07,080
there is uh all of those licenses that people are dealing with though from having their earlier

1337
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:13,880
versions um and they're saying that of course all of their uh their controllers that came out

1338
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:19,400
apparently all of it is supposed to work on the new stuff as well um and then they are working

1339
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:26,760
on cleaner transfer for the dlc um information um so that it's supposed to be a lot easier than

1340
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:33,480
it was um and then uh the license for rock bands three songs going to rock band four expires on

1341
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:39,800
december 1st so you have one last chance to get that but you need the rock band three disc and

1342
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:47,720

02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:46,920
they have something else to go watch but yes that is that did start tonight you know what i finally

1390
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:52,760
watched too um while i was on my little trip number one i finally finished all four seasons

1391
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:59,000
of the good place finally which was finally well worth it it was such a good show i highly

1392
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:04,440
recommend it um and then i also finally saw the pressure luck revival i hadn't seen it this whole

1393
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:08,280
time i just you know i'm always playing games or whatever um so i finally sat down watch that

1394
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:13,320
because i i watched an episode some guy almost won the whole thing like won a million bucks or

1395
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:18,680
something is there another one um yeah they relaunched pressure luck uh last year i think

1396
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:24,120
and it's um what's her name effy trinket in hunger games she hosts it elizabeth banks

1397
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:31,080
before right oh yeah like in the 2000 era the whammy no no that was terrible this one the

1398
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:36,440
nice thing about this one this brings back like it's the it does what a lot of the abc shows do

1399
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:41,560
and it brings back the same set and the whammies and little cartoon animations in the 80s but they

1400
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:46,840
made them new things but they're still that same style so they kept everything that works and

1401
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:51,240
obviously they had to change the host because peter tamarkin you know died um so they changed

1402
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:57,080
the host but elizabeth banks she works she did a good job so cool okay yeah reda repulsa also was

1403
02:18:57,080 --> 02:19:04,680
her big role so um yeah that was good i saw that and uh yeah the supermarket sweep is leslie jones

1404
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:11,560
which love her i can't see how that's bad uh card sharks joel mchale was on tonight too oh lord

1405
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:16,440
yeah so they've been reviving a lot of the old game shows it's pretty interesting and then um

1406
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:23,560
also saw the weakest link came back on nbc but it's not um ann robinson and she was so good there

1407
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:31,320
they have um what's her name the the chick from glee uh jay linch is the host now yeah she's cool

1408
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:37,800
like i like her but it's it's it's her her um i think ann robinson really worked on the weakest

1409
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:42,840
link because she was a bit of an unknown especially here in america but jane lynch

1410
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:48,920
there's something about her demeanor where it feels like she's playing a character and she's

1411
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:53,880
good she plays a good character but it just kind of feels like she's playing that mean teacher on

1412
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:59,640
glee as a game show host and so it's kind of weird i don't know but anyway yeah and that's my that's

1413
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:09,480
my opinion on game shows all right let's move on uh more uh more topics logi all right um so not

1414
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:15,800
surprising because it hasn't been doing too well but apparently the next-gen versions of marvel's

1415
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:22,200
avengers have been delayed uh because apparently crystal dynamics is working on issues with the

1416
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:29,000
game you may not know they're only they were down to a thousand players concurrent recently on the

1417
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:36,120
pc version of that game oh wow so it's just it hasn't really been delivering the promise that

1418
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:41,720
they were making of the game so because of that of course um they are now going back to retool

1419
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:46,200
some of that stuff they said they want to deliver an extra experience showcasing all that this game

1420
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:52,600
is meant to be and uh apparently along with that they're going to be throwing in some

1421
02:20:53,480 --> 02:21:00,280
bonuses for players that already have the game as well um fifth dream in our chat says yeah

1422
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:05,080
it's a buggy mess and not fun that's too bad because crystal dynamics really knocked it out

1423
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:09,640
of the park with um the tomb raider games so i don't know was it was this just rushed like

1424
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:14,280
they just didn't have enough time to really put the polish on it you know needed i think it's

1425
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:19,880
just because they're trying to shoehorn it into a um live service game whereas it looks like this

1426
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:25,720
would play more as a single player story driven game which is kind of what they're used to is a

1427
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:33,000
lot of those um single player story driven games um but now they're making them it's anthem all

1428
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:38,920
over again i mean look you've got the you've got a studio that's been um experienced has experience

1429
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:45,080
in making a certain type of game and now you're forcing them to make a game that's a live service

1430
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:51,880
game because money and how did that turn out it turned out well for anthem and it didn't turn out

1431
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:57,880
well for this so it's just i think i saw hopefully we'll be like i think i saw anthem like seven

1432
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:03,320
bucks on the shelf at target the other day and i was like it's still too much it hopefully will

1433
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:12,280
yeah it'll hopefully um get better with time but like sometimes they just give up so yeah it

1434
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:19,320
depends like with anthem yeah you can rescue a game we've seen many cases now there's been several

1435
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:25,480
where a game has completely turned around and fixed what was a problem launch diablo 3 final

1436
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:30,680
fantasy 14 no man's sky you know there's there and there's more that you can probably add to

1437
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:36,200
this list you know so the avengers isn't like completely fucked like it can still turn around

1438
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:40,920
but you're right the developer and the publisher have to kind of commit to turning it around

1439
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:45,960
and you know what we saw like hello games doing with no man's sky that shit is unprecedented

1440
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:51,320
like the amount of shit that that game got and the amount that the developers have stuck to it to

1441
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:57,240
really turn it around and i mean really turn it around is really unprecedented so i mean it's not

1442
02:22:57,240 --> 02:23:04,520
it's they could do it it's just will crystal and square and all that be able to have the resources

1443
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:12,600
to do it the good news is square enix final fantasy 14 probably the biggest example of a

1444
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:17,560
turnaround and not just a turnaround but a turnaround that resulted in profit big profit

1445
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:22,680
that game is making square a lot of money so that's the good news we're not talking about

1446
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:27,960
ea now with anthem we're talking about square enix and they've turned around the game before

1447
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:33,640
so it's possible so not all this news necessarily has to be bad well i understand that but like

1448
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:38,600
an mmo and a live service game like this are kind of a little bit different in the sense i think with

1449
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:45,720
an mmo mmo you have a lot more content to consume whereas this game it's kind of grinding the same

1450
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:50,200
missions over and over and over again for experience not only that though with an mmo

1451
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:55,320
i mean you have your monthly fee that you're paying to this they don't have that kind of

1452
02:23:55,320 --> 02:24:01,800
laid out here so instead they have all these different like passes that you can purchase to

1453
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:08,440
bought upgrade each individual character is a separate pass it's just it's monetized the hell

1454
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:15,240
and so it it's just it's greedy they see it working with like fortnite and stuff like that

1455
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:20,200
but they have to realize that that's a free to play game like it's different you can't charge

1456
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:25,160
people up for it 60 fee and then like oh but by the way we want more of your money a ton more of

1457
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:33,880
your money um it's just i don't know when they're gonna learn that this is not a a smart way to go

1458
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:42,200
akuma jp in chat says final fantasy is squares bread but avengers is not no true and you know

1459
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:48,920
final fantasy really stuck to we are going to charge a monthly fee for this mmo excuse me

1460
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:55,080
sorry hiccups um and they're only they're one of two companies still in the business

1461
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:59,160
or that do that that are still in the business of that them and blizzard with wow are the only

1462
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:03,000
ones that are still charging a monthly fee to play their game everybody else went free to play

1463
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,920
and there was a lot of pressure for for final fantasy 14 i think to go free to play and well

1464
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:11,800
actually they have a really robust free to play experience now essentially uh squares take on it

1465
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:17,480
the first two expansions so the base realm reborn and heavensward are now just free

1466
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:22,440
you could just go play those if you want uh if you want to play the newer stuff like uh storm

1467
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:26,920
blood and shadow bringers then you have to start paying but they're they're offering a lot for free

1468
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:33,160
now it's pretty interesting so yeah uh questbuster says loki hit on another thing that irked me

1469
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:38,840
every tune had to be leveled up separately uh at least in ultimate alliance i could expect my tunes

1470
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:43,800
to somewhat keep with me regardless of whether i had them in my party or not but no let's not

1471
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:50,360
respect the player's time uh she hulk 10 says they should just make a great hulk game now

1472
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:52,920
why would she hulk won a great hulk game

1473
02:25:55,320 --> 02:26:02,680
but no i think the hulk is it's a secret to everybody there you go there you go that would

1474
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:07,880
be that's right i'm sorry disney doesn't make games anymore you need to aim higher aim higher

1475
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:13,160
go for the she-hole game all right okay and the follow-up comment or she hulk game

1476
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:20,280
all right i'll take it all right uh let's move on let's talk about the playstation 5 interface

1477
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:25,160
because sony actually showed off the playstation 5 interface this week so we got to see a little

1478
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:29,080
more about it um i'm gonna be honest it was like a 20-minute video and i didn't watch the whole

1479
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:36,200
thing i don't know if you guys did uh loki or what have you um no but basically okay it has

1480
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:40,280
some similarities to what we've seen before although of course now it runs in 4k but you

1481
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:46,440
also have quick access to things like help um you also have the game milestones and how close you

1482
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:52,280
are to certain achievements uh and trophies or whatever are embedded within the game you can see

1483
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:57,960
the progress on the various levels and quests but you can also see guides and hints if you have a

1484
02:26:57,960 --> 02:27:03,080
playstation plus membership so you can kind of get an idea of where is this or how do i do this that's

1485
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:07,320
kind of interesting how they're embedding that in there instead of uh and really cutting into

1486
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:12,280
the youtube market for that kind of stuff except yeah i was gonna say except you you do realize

1487
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:17,640
you have a console with youtube and probably a web browser in there and everybody has a phone

1488
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:23,560
and the internet what don't you all have phones no i'm still i but just like yes the console has

1489
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:26,920
youtube but you have to go out of what you're playing to go look at youtube but you're right

1490
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:30,760
the phones are the way a lot of people and like i don't understand like it's gonna be much i

1491
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:36,600
um whatever you know what because do whatever whatever you want to say to like the answer

1492
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:41,640
is simple the answer is simple why would sony want you to go out to youtube to watch a video

1493
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:46,680
when that you could watch their video which someday will have an ad just like youtube

1494
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:52,280
no it's because it's not even that at all it's because they just want to bring some more value

1495
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:59,640
to their playstation plus service that is severely lacking new value is what they're trying to do

1496
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:08,040
all right it's fine no one's gonna use it like no one uses probably the uh whatever they call

1497
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:12,120
it where they you know posting screenshots and stuff internally within playstation

1498
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:17,800
i don't think i ever look at that stuff but it's there now some things that are also worth pointing

1499
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:22,600
out and i think these are really cool you can now do voice dictation for chat so if you don't

1500
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:26,280
so you have to sit there trying to type a message you can just say it into the controller's

1501
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:31,800
microphone and it will hopefully uh dictate the message about as well as your smartphone does

1502
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:35,960
so that's you know it'll dictate it incorrectly which will then get picked up by the other

1503
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:41,880
algorithm that says that you're a terrorist and then you need lost access to all your uh content

1504
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:46,920
so uh you can also send messages with spoiler warnings so if you're gonna send an image that's

1505
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:50,920
late in the game you can have it with a spoiler warning so that way it doesn't ruin it for somebody

1506
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:56,440
that's um a good thought and a good way of planning that out um there's always an explore

1507
02:28:56,440 --> 02:29:01,320
section that has kind of a mix of things from playstation games the community i kind of thought

1508
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:05,400
playstation 4 kind of already has that but it's kind of clunky and i don't know if that's just

1509
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:09,560
because the the age of the playstation 4 system or whatever but it's getting a little clunky

1510
02:29:09,560 --> 02:29:14,600
uh and the playstation 5 is is definitely moving a little bit faster so that's um it's kind of

1511
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:19,560
interesting so it's not really a complete reinvention of the wheel but you know and i

1512
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:25,160
noticed in chat act f says the thing that caught my eye the most is how fast the interface runs

1513
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:29,640
and i think it is that that nice kind of like quick access stuff you know especially moving to

1514
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:34,600
the solid state drive that's a big chunk of what microsoft has going for it too so i think that'll

1515
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:40,360
be well received no all right let's move on just a few more stories for you guys then we're going

1516
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:44,120
to get to listener roundtable i know we at least have a couple emails tonight so let's get through

1517
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:50,440
these last few stories dark sakura well the writer of silent hill shattered memories is

1518
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:59,880
pitching a sequel um uh sam barlow who was the one behind that in 2009 um really wants to do

1519
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:08,200
something else with silent hill um right now it's just uh pitched as project a um and i'm sorry

1520
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:12,680
it's not project a which is something he's developing with half mermaid studios it's

1521
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:18,840
something completely different um and it doesn't um necessarily mean that it's gonna be picked up

1522
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:25,560
but he's really pushing for it and it could have some subtraction so we'll see um i didn't remember

1523
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:32,120
that as being the greatest in the line of silent hill games but anything that gets us more silent

1524
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:42,120
hill makes me pretty happy so we'll see cool yeah hopefully they don't screw it up yeah

1525
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:50,600
don't fuck it up i just want some silent hill i know it's time for that series to come back

1526
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:56,600
already right right it'll never be as good as you want it to be pixel pakas also points out

1527
02:30:56,600 --> 02:31:00,920
sam barlow is the one that worked on her story and telling lies and telling lies was that game

1528
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:06,200
i talked about a few weeks ago um that i thought was really cool what's that yeah her story was

1529
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:12,840
pretty okay too did you play telling lies no oh you should it's it's cool like it's it's

1530
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:17,160
it's like her story it's it's the whole you're looking through video to find things it's great

1531
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:26,840
so yeah all right um let's move on loki so this is to be expected but apparently nintendo has gone

1532
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:37,640
after um a tick tock um user by the name of poke princess um who had 1.9 million followers

1533
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:45,800
now you may be asking well why would they do that well a few reasons number one um she calls herself

1534
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:55,480
poke princess poke of course referring to pokemon um she sells merchandise featuring mu and poke

1535
02:31:55,480 --> 02:32:03,160
balls which don't believe that she has the express permission to do and also um being that she is

1536
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:09,560
representing herself with poke in her name probably her only fans page is not something

1537
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:16,040
that they would like to have associated with their nintendo brand so they have filed a suit

1538
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:22,200
against her and gotten her to change her name now to digital princess maybe she just likes fish

1539
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:28,600
okay is delicious yeah but she she's she's got like merchandise that has mu on it i mean it's

1540
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:33,880
like i'm joking really yeah no yeah and that that is the real problem you know i think there's a

1541
02:32:33,880 --> 02:32:38,680
narrative out there about nintendo doesn't appreciate that she does adult content and all

1542
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:45,800
this stuff i don't think that is the issue the issue is the merchandise at the end of the day

1543
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:51,480
that's what they have a problem with it's probably the merchandise scott garnered the attention

1544
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:59,560
and the rest was just not you know they can't even if she was like family-friendly wholesome

1545
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:05,160
and stuff like that you can't sell merch with their branding themselves yeah that's

1546
02:33:05,960 --> 02:33:12,600
and obviously the adult element of it it does and i again i don't want to slut shame sex industry

1547
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:17,240
worker shame any of that stuff on here like you know uh there's lots of people out there

1548
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:21,160
especially in these pandemic times that are looking to things like only fans to kind of

1549
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:25,720
you know carry it and i it's fine you know you got to make a living where you can make a living

1550
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:31,560
uh in the world's you know in a profession that works for a lot of people um well in

1551
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:39,160
i was gonna say the i just think nintendo doesn't want to even remember they shut down

1552
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:46,120
picto chat because it was possible to send a dick pic to somebody they shut it down for everybody

1553
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:52,680
like they don't even want to have it inferred that pokemon is mixed with adult entertainment

1554
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:57,240
they don't even want to take that risk but the merchandise at the end of the day is the biggest

1555
02:33:57,240 --> 02:34:02,840
problem yeah and she's she's basically saying you know nintendo doesn't want people to think i'm in

1556
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:06,840
any way shape or form affiliated with them or that i have a partnership with them it all comes down

1557
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:12,040
to me being an adult entertainer it says nintendo's a family-friendly company so they don't want to

1558
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:17,160
ruin their reputation or anything if people think that me and them are affiliated obviously

1559
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:20,760
really sucks from a business standpoint i have to understand it and accept it because i fucked up

1560
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:27,960
so um i still love nintendo and will forever support them well that's a at least that's a nice

1561
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:35,400
thing to make sure the lawyers get off her back but it's nice it is it is nice yeah so all right

1562
02:34:35,400 --> 02:34:39,640
well best of luck to digi princess and you know what it's you can rebrand yourself and still be

1563
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:43,320
successful and especially with the number of followers she has i feel like she's gonna be

1564
02:34:43,320 --> 02:34:47,400
she's gonna be okay she just needs to come up with new new new merch but it'll be all right

1565
02:34:48,680 --> 02:34:55,640
all right let's move on one more story tonight that has to do with starcraft 2 or lack thereof

1566
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:59,720
i don't mean to be dumping on blizzard tonight sorry i just had two articles about them but

1567
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:04,680
uh blizzard is pretty much done with starcraft 2 this is of course right on the heels of the game's

1568
02:35:05,240 --> 02:35:10,600
10th anniversary blizzard has announced they're going to be moving away from making new content

1569
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:18,280
for starcraft 2 and focusing on what's next without saying starcraft 3 but i mean hello

1570
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:25,160
we're not saying we're not saying starcraft 3 but starcraft 3 anyway uh no more uh for purchase in

1571
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:30,840
game content no more expansions for starcraft 2 they will still do season roles they'll do

1572
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:35,960
balance fixes for the fans and the competitive players uh and you know they're saying esports

1573
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:40,200
is still going strong i mean well shit the original starcraft esports is still going strong

1574
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:46,040
so uh yeah i wouldn't expect that that's gonna go away um but that's that's it and if you missed it

1575
02:35:46,040 --> 02:35:50,280
starcraft 2 did get a big update for the 10th anniversary so it did go out with a bang

1576
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:56,840
so in july there were new achievements prestige talents and gameplay improvements um with that so

1577
02:35:56,840 --> 02:36:01,400
um it's not that you know the game's been supported a lot longer than most games get

1578
02:36:01,400 --> 02:36:08,920
supported so there is that ssj100 matt in chat says or more likely starcraft the mobile spin-off

1579
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:15,800
game you shut your mouth and you don't speak that into existence where every gamer has a voice

1580
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:23,080
except you with that comment i'm just kidding all right let's get into speaking of which let's get

1591
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:22,680
religiously since 2005 but i'm a bit shy to join the live shows preferring to enjoy the show bit

1592
02:37:22,680 --> 02:37:27,800
by bit throughout my work week don't judge me please no not judging you no totally not judging

you but at the same time we don't bite like so you know i do well here's the thing let me let

1594
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:38,520

1595
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:43,880
telling you we're too busy multitasking i have no idea who's watching i can see right now live on

1596
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:49,160
twitch there's 34 watching and maybe 10 active in chat so i know there's people that just have this

1597
02:37:49,160 --> 02:37:54,920
on and you're doing other things and that's a-okay like i i'm not that and that's the only time and

1598
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:59,160
as far as i'm going to go to call out lurkers because i know i like to watch certain twitch

1599
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:03,560
channels and i just sit there and don't say anything i just have it on in the background

1600
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:07,880
because it's it's kind of like my background thing going on right now so i do want to just say

1601
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:13,320
don't be don't be scared if you want to come live sunday night but at the same time totally don't i

1602
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:18,280
mean that's why we do a podcast so that you can listen throughout the week so if that's how you

1603
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:26,680
want to do it that is totally fine so um uh i just wanted to bring all of the listeners attention to

1604
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:31,720
a wonderful hidden gem i just discovered on the nintendo e shop called hunt down the only way i

1605
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:37,560
can describe it as a final fight neon samurai and narc had a baby and it was raised by quentin

1606
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:43,480
tarantino in a dingy arcade it's hilarious and rocklessly fun trust me the trailer alone will

1607
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:47,880
sell you on it there's a link to it but i think everyone can find it um this got me thinking when

1608
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:51,320
was the last time you discovered a game that you had never heard of and enjoyed so much that you

1609
02:38:51,320 --> 02:38:56,840
can't believe it never gained mass popularity hunt down definitely fits the bill to me and i'd love

1610
02:38:56,840 --> 02:39:01,800
to know your thoughts on this topic back to lurking for me thank you all for all you do and the voices

1611
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:07,560
you bring to the community i appreciate you signed tonic vision i appreciate that email

1612
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:16,040
very much thank you you remember well me talking about um patterned i really like patterned um and

1613
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:24,520
there was that other game that i used to play that was like hex based puzzles and gosh why can't i

1614
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:31,160
think of it for anymore because i really loved it um but lately it was it's patterned for me

1615
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:36,120
i really like patterned um i think in the modern type of games you know i'm kind of stealing

1616
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:41,400
something that maybe loki would say but orna just because you know considering it's like a

1617
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:47,560
old school rpg mixed with pokemon go it there are the real world elements of that kind of surprised

1618
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:52,200
more people aren't talking about that game um but i also like being able to control as many

1619
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:57,400
territories as i do so maybe i'm okay with that being a little more underground i go back like

1620
02:39:57,400 --> 02:40:02,680
way back to classics actually when i first kind of read that question my brain went to um like

1621
02:40:02,680 --> 02:40:07,400
probably the biggest oversight of all time and dark soccer i know you're gonna agree with me

1622
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:14,760
on this the guardian legend that was a game that like deserves way more recognition and um

1623
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:20,280
support than i think it got especially at the time i think it's one of those things now that

1624
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:24,680
there's definitely a cult audience for it and words gotten out i think with time but i think

1625
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:29,080
that would be one and then maybe i'm just in a retro mood or something but i also think of a

1626
02:40:29,080 --> 02:40:36,760
game like uh crystalis i don't think was super huge at the time but it was so so good for like

1627
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:43,560
a zelda ish type of game on the nes um that was a game i remember enjoying the shit out of when i

1628
02:40:43,560 --> 02:40:48,840
was a kid not a lot of people were super into that so um some comments coming in from our chat room

1629
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:55,240
including uh shane is back saying uh roundabout is that game that's the one with the limo that

1630
02:40:55,240 --> 02:41:02,200
just spins over and over and the cutscenes are so bad but like i know and flaco love that game too

1631
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:05,400
they both were talking about how much they love roundabout and i'm like or as i call it

1632
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:13,480
runeboot and i i don't think it's i don't think it's that funny but okay whatever it's okay but

1633
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:22,360
it ends up getting old pretty fast okay um yeah this is folks in chat some some are saying

1634
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:27,480
roundabout is amazing uh some are saying round about the game not the song from yes all right

1635
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:34,200
anyway uh great question and great email thanks so much for that then our other one uh comes uh

1636
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:40,840
well you'll be able to tell the moment that i start the email so hello lr oh yeah i'm all

1637
02:41:40,840 --> 02:41:47,080
caught up on past episodes thanks for taking a week off that helped so i'm now able to actually

1638
02:41:47,080 --> 02:41:52,120
comment on something mentioned during the last episode regarding sony's decision to universally

1639
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:58,360
make x the confirm button and o the cancel button across all regions including japan at least one of

1640
02:41:58,360 --> 02:42:03,560
you pointed out the accessibility feature that allows you to remap buttons however you want

1641
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:09,720
unfortunately this is not a good solution because this changes literally all functions of the button

1642
02:42:09,720 --> 02:42:14,840
not just functions pertaining to menu selections for example if the game uses x as a jump button

1643
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:21,080
as other games often do the jump button would now be on oh and while many games have their own

1644
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:25,960
button config functions you'll also be dealing with many games having their own but you'll also

1645
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:31,480
be dealing with incorrect on-screen prompts and the headache of having to remap buttons in literally

1646
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:36,200
every game you play the correct way of handling this would be to give users the option of which

1647
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:41,960
button they want to confirm or cancel heck this option could be rolled out worldwide i suppose

1648
02:42:41,960 --> 02:42:46,840
time will tell but i really don't see why this shouldn't be a thing thanks as usual for this

1649
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:53,000
show and have a great week erin yyr um great solution to the problem and i i really have

1650
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:58,360
nothing else to add thank you for the email it's great uh yeah should be just baked into the os but

1651
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:01,640
you're right you brought up a good point it's going to change other things those buttons use

1652
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:06,600
too that maybe is unintended so yeah good good way of framing that all right uh now before i

1653
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:12,520
get bobby really wants to hear this email so i'm going to do chat questions first all right uh just

1654
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:17,880
a quick a couple quick ones from chat sg100 matt says uh today is the 35th anniversary of the nes

tetris um and i had uh i've done the game before sky shark which was like my probably one of my

1665
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:30,280
earliest shooters that i played and i absolutely loved it um and later on i was given some games

1666
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:35,400
by my mom's friend ashley who you know rest in peace she's no longer with with us for years um

1667
02:44:35,960 --> 02:44:40,680
this is the same lady who told no one she was pregnant didn't change any of her clothes for

1668
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:44,840
her entire pregnancy and her own mother found out when she was giving birth in the bathroom

1669
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:51,800
just leave that there wow so she gave me all of her games after she had her baby um and among them

1670
02:44:51,800 --> 02:45:01,000
was the guardian legend nice nice so yep uh dj rama s in chat says non-gaming question are you

1671
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:05,080
ready for supermarket sweep tonight you must have left the room because we had a game show tangent

1672
02:45:05,080 --> 02:45:10,600
not that long ago but um short answer yes but will i actually getting around to watching it

1673
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:16,280
like on hulu or whatever uh to be determined if i can pull myself away from my games long enough

1674
02:45:16,280 --> 02:45:20,600
because i only just that just this last week finally watched the pressure lock reboot

1675
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:27,320
so i'm a little slow sometimes leave me alone all right uh let's see other questions here um

1676
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:34,200
no one special says uh okay it's basically halloween season that being said is there a game

1677
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:39,240
that has a horror vibe be it an old resident evil or silent hill game nightmare creatures or

1678
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:43,160
whatever that would be a good fit for the halloween season that you've always liked

1679
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:48,200
playing right around halloween as a sort of tradition of sorts personally i've always

1680
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:54,040
enjoyed playing the first three resident evil games and or nightmare creatures anyone want to

1681
02:45:54,040 --> 02:46:00,200
take that i mean aside from the game in my background but that hasn't really been too recent

1682
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:09,080
so yeah i will probably oh go ahead um i i've just i like final home i've played that a couple

1683
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:15,960
times it out um you know don't not really i will probably be exposed to plenty of debt by daylight

1684
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:20,760
thanks to my husband um i'm not huge on the scary games you guys know that i mean i do like silent

1685
02:46:20,760 --> 02:46:25,400
hill and stuff but i probably won't do a full replay um i like to use the halloween season

1686
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:32,200
to celebrate campy horror movies um so i will probably watch the adams family uh elvira mistress

1687
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:38,520
of the dark is a must this time of year uh showgirls is uh one that uh i wish jamie and i could

1688
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:44,440
get together and watch uh but uh you know things are what they are but i like i like to use this

1689
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:51,320
time of year to do uh scary uh horror movies not not scary but like campy i love the campy sleep

1690
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:58,840
sleepaway camp um i'm trying to get other stuff that's like super camp that's yeah anyway uh

1691
02:46:58,840 --> 02:47:05,400
let's see other comments in chats um act f says what is a game that you've played where you've

1692
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:13,480
liked most if not every single main or secondary character in it what is a game where you liked

1693
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:27,400
every single character in it um um um mass effect i mean that's kind of where my head goes um

1694
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:34,760
keep in mind i hated cadent first just saying yeah but he said you could most he said most was

1695
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:40,360
okay are we referring so we're referring to main characters um i actually really do enjoy a lot of

1696
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:47,800
the resident evil characters um i enjoy uh i mean certainly most of the final fantasy characters i

1697
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:53,800
really enjoyed them i would say fantasy 13 and even with hope and venille you grow to really

1698
02:47:53,800 --> 02:48:01,160
like them towards the end um and especially in uh 13 2 i think hope is uh really cool so um i think

1699
02:48:01,160 --> 02:48:06,120
that's a good one too in my opinion and uh yeah i was thinking of this one too shane in chat gives

1700
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:10,680
the answer i'm not as surprised to hear at all saying hades and yeah as far as like recent stuff

1701
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:15,320
goes um all the characters in hades are so dreamy there's something about that game

1702
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:23,480
there's something about that game so good uh loki anything for you where you enjoyed all

1703
02:48:23,480 --> 02:48:32,920
um say like final fantasy 6 or that's a good one um maybe like one of the grand theft auto

1704
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:40,680
games i can't see four because roman was a pain in the ass um maybe five

1705
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:49,560
um you know on twitter when people say um i'm h word on maine they mean hades all right uh

1706
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:56,040
let's see moving on to one more question here that is um oh i thought we had another one nope i think

1707
02:48:56,040 --> 02:49:01,480
i got everything if you if we didn't get your question just repost it okay uh because i missed

1708
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:06,120

1709
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:09,480
not giving them a free ad because that would just encourage them to spam me again so here we go
