0	29000	4 days ago, DidYouKnowGaming released a video on Smash Ultimate rumors. One of the most notable ones to me was the possible inclusion of Steve from Minecraft that was so far, quote, debunked. 3 days ago, Steve from Minecraft was announced for Smash Ultimate. Rumors aren't debunked, they're either confirmed or just don't come to pass, and this is also why you shouldn't pre-order games multiple months out.
29000	36000	This is just one headline of the night. Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	59000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio back again live tonight with episode number 838 for this October the 4th of 2020.
59000	67000	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co-hosts. Say hello, welcome back to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
67000	69000	Greetings and salutations.
69000	77000	Welcome back, I hope you, I know it's not like a happy holiday, but I hope you had a restful and good holiday.
77000	94000	Well, I didn't fast, so there's that. It's supposed to be a holy day where you afflict yourself. I figured this year we were already afflicted. I wasn't going to do more. Sorry, not about that.
94000	103000	I understand. We've all been challenged enough as it is regardless of your religion this year. It's been a heck of a year, all the 2020 jokes, that's for sure.
103000	105000	Quite so, quite so.
105000	121000	We acknowledge our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network over at twitch.tv slash vog network VOG network and you can see more information about all that at vognetwork.com we go live Sunday nights at six Pacific nine Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
121000	137000	There's some folks in chat that are going, what is going on? It's Bizarro OLR, it's Mirror Universe OLR, because all we changed tonight was that I reordered the cameras a little bit so I'm on the left side of the screen and DarkSakura and Techmaster Loki are on the right side of the screen.
137000	151000	Because obviously we've been doing this distance taping for months now. OLR historically for 17 and a half years was all in the same place. But because of some of those things Jamie and I just spoke about, we're distance recording right now.
151000	161000	So here's the deal. It's as simple as this. I have a tendency since this space we're in which we've called Studio N7 where I'm based in Sacramento, California, aka my spare room.
161000	171000	This was really designed to be a radio studio and one you weren't supposed to see. So we kind of made it work for Twitch and then we've had to make it work again for this remote thing.
171000	183000	So long story short, I have a bad habit I've noticed of looking at this TV that's over here so I can see DarkSakura and Loki during the show. Well, when I was on the right side of the screen, it looks like I'm looking at nothing.
183000	198000	But by reordering it now, it's just a little trick. Now it just looks like I'm looking at Jamie or I'm looking at Loki if I look down a little bit. So that's all it is. It's just trying to make it look like I'm paying attention every time I look at the TV as opposed to drifting and where are my eyes.
198000	206000	Anyway, so there you go. A little peek behind the curtain. One of the folks that is in the camera is on the right there. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
206000	207000	Hello.
207000	208000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
208000	209000	I'm fine.
209000	221000	And I noticed some folks in chat are commenting on the game that you're playing, or not playing, but the game running behind you as we are on Twitch right now. I thought at first it was Blaster Master, but I wouldn't have been far off.
221000	222000	That's pretty close.
222000	227000	I wouldn't have been far off. No, it's Fester's Quest, right? That's going on?
227000	229000	It's practically the same universe.
229000	234000	Well, I'm pretty sure it's the same engine anyway, at least the part that powers the overhead stuff.
234000	235000	Absolutely the same engine.
235000	238000	Yeah, so why Fester's Quest tonight?
238000	241000	Because it's October, so it's like a Halloween game.
241000	244000	Okay, so it's going to be spooky month here at OLR.
244000	245000	Sure, why not?
245000	258000	Sounds good. Let's see, DJ Rama S in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, Rob, I try to do that too when I stream, except that Slobs flips my webcam.
258000	263000	So I was thinking about doing a mirror image, and that would have fixed the problem too.
263000	268000	But then all my logo T-shirts would have been backwards and you guys would have complained about that.
268000	270000	So you get this, you'll get used to it.
270000	274000	It's just it's just a reordering. I'm just in a different part of the window on the Zoom call.
274000	281000	You'll all get over it. All right. Anyway, Dark Sakura, love your wig.
281000	286000	I neglected to point that out earlier in the show.
286000	289000	Sorry, I was on mute again. That's all right.
289000	295000	Because it is October and spooky season and now the Spirit Halloween stores are popping up everywhere.
295000	298000	Are you going to expand your wig collection this month?
298000	302000	Girl, no, not even. Look at this.
302000	306000	I can't really see. Oh, is that a gray wig? It's hard to see.
306000	313000	It's kind of like a purple silver, but it's for Project Nunway,
313000	319000	which is something the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are doing. We're having a fashion show.
319000	325000	I will be finishing up my costume. My well, my look is supposed to be themed with chastity.
325000	332000	So it's going to be you're going to see me in white. There will be chains on it and protesting.
332000	337000	But I will I'll put some stuff out there for when that's going to go down,
337000	341000	because it's going to be we're recording in a couple of weeks. It'll be the week after that.
341000	347000	So I'll definitely let everyone in the loop.
347000	351000	Yeah, but yeah, I post on your Twitter or your Insta or something. Oh, yeah.
351000	356000	Oh, and there's there's going to be more in the works very publicly this month.
357000	366000	All right. All right. Well, let's get into games as we do like to play some video games as the real world continues its crazy path this year.
366000	374000	But video games sure are a great escape. And one video game kind of dominating the news in multiple places this week, sort of. Right, Logie?
374000	380000	Yeah. So it makes sense that they had time the announcements close to each other because this week we had,
380000	384000	of course, a couple of announcements regarding Minecraft.
384000	394000	So the first announcement was by Nintendo announcing that the next DLC fighter for Smash Brothers is going to be Steve from Minecraft.
394000	400000	Or should I say Steve Alex, the zombie and an enderman from Minecraft.
400000	404000	All of those being the shadow fighters as well. So it's kind of interesting.
404000	410000	He's got a lot of unique abilities, including being able to place blocks on the map.
410000	418000	You know, you can have a lot of different abilities based on the different mobs and stuff that are in Minecraft as well.
418000	428000	It just looks like a pretty fun character. So they announced that this week right before, of course, the Minecraft live event that they did.
428000	434000	Wait, before you get into the Minecon replacement for this year, talking about Minecraft, Steve and Switch.
434000	440000	Boy were hoes mad on Twitter. There were a lot of mad hoes online this week about Steve and Minecraft.
440000	443000	I'm kind of curious what you guys think about that character addition.
443000	448000	I think it's interesting, mostly because it's been rumored for so long.
448000	451000	I think it's more interesting that that rumor actually came true.
451000	458000	And you don't know if it's the rumor was true or if it's they heard so many people on the Internet imagining it.
458000	462000	They made it real. Like it's almost hard to figure out how this came to be.
462000	470000	I'm curious, what are your guys reactions to and I open this up to chat to your reaction to Steve in Smash Brothers.
470000	479000	I mean, it's pretty cool. Yeah, it's not I'll be honest, I really don't get surprised by some of these announcements these days.
479000	485000	I mean, just being perfectly honest, I expect anybody to make it into Smash.
485000	489000	It's not not exclusive. Right. Does that make sense?
489000	494000	No, it does, because I do feel like, you know, they there are so many flipping characters in the game.
494000	502000	And I feel like the DLC has really been a place for them to experiment outside of just the Nintendo stuff.
502000	505000	And I know. Yes, I know. We already had, you know, like Solid Snake.
505000	509000	You know, we we had them characters that weren't necessarily Nintendo already in the game.
509000	511000	Simon Belmont, Pac-Man, et cetera, et cetera.
511000	515000	But it does seem like the DLC has been the place to really experiment.
515000	519000	And I'm talking about like Joker from Persona. Who would have ever saw that one coming?
519000	523000	I'm sorry, but that that would have never been on my radar.
523000	526000	And like I'm not saying persona is bad. That is not what I'm saying at all.
526000	530000	But I just associate persona with PlayStation. I would have never associate.
530000	534000	And yes, I realize it does exist in different games on Nintendo.
534000	539000	But you guys, it's not something you kind of like. I remember playing Castlevania on NES.
539000	544000	I remember playing Pac-Man on NES, Solid Snake, maybe Metal Gear.
544000	547000	If we go back to the original Metal Gear, maybe on NES.
547000	551000	Yes, I realize it existed on the GameCube. Don't nickel and dime my argument here.
551000	556000	But my point is, Joker and Persona, I don't really think of that with the Switch.
556000	560000	So we started getting really experimental with this DLC. Now, Minecraft.
560000	566000	I wouldn't say we started with this one. I mean, look at we had Cloud from Final Fantasy 7 not too long ago as well.
567000	570000	There's nothing to be surprised about anymore.
570000	573000	I think it's more of a video game pool at this point.
573000	578000	And to be honest, again, look at the top selling games on the Nintendo Switch on the eShop.
578000	582000	Minecraft has always been in the top five since the day it came out.
582000	586000	Minecraft is a huge game. Minecraft is something that's going to appeal to younger kids.
586000	590000	Something that Bobby was saying during his show, and I saw him repeating it in chat,
590000	595000	was that there's going to be younger kids like eight years old that are going to be excited for Smash now
595000	599000	because a character that they have associations with.
599000	604000	You know, us here at Orange Challenge Radio, us gamers that have been around since the olden days,
604000	610000	we remember Mario, Luigi, Link, and all this stuff. But kids really associate with Minecraft Steve in a similar way.
610000	615000	Loki, I don't know if you have a reference here because you have kids in that target age.
615000	617000	Did they see this? What do they think?
617000	621000	They think it's pretty cool. They want to get it.
622000	627000	I'm a little disappointed. I was hoping for Jason Voorhees, but it's fine.
627000	631000	No, seriously though, it was pretty cool. I thought it was interesting.
631000	636000	It's got me interested in Smash Brothers, so I just have to pick it up for my kids now.
636000	639000	All right. Let me ask one more question.
639000	644000	It's the question all your podcasts and all the social media is going to be asking, but I'm going to do it too.
644000	648000	Since clearly nothing is off limits at this point in Smash,
648000	653000	if you get to do one character, the last character for Smash for DLC,
653000	656000	yes, I know there's four more, but in my scenario, you're doing the last one,
656000	659000	what's the character you're going to add?
659000	661000	And you can do anything, anything you want.
663000	670000	Right now, given that I am in fandom denial with my favorite show ending,
670000	676000	I am going to say that I am going to have character swaps for the Winchesters.
677000	678000	Okay.
678000	683000	I'm going to go supernatural on this one because right now I'm just still super depressed the show is ending.
683000	686000	You're going to cross over into TV fandom, really?
686000	688000	Cross over into TV fandom.
688000	690000	Okay. All right. I like that.
690000	692000	Then you know what? Why not?
692000	698000	I'm also going to go that route, sort of, and I'm just going to straight up pick Batman.
698000	700000	I want Batman. Why not?
700000	702000	Batman had some great NES games.
702000	706000	It was the one that was based on the 89 movie, and there's always those tie-ins.
706000	709000	Yeah, I'd go with Batman, and then you could do all the costume changes.
709000	711000	It would just be like Batman and all the different movies,
711000	713000	and I would only ever play the Adam West one.
713000	715000	And it's not just because of my shirt.
715000	717000	I'm picking Batman.
717000	719000	Spoiler alert.
719000	720000	Right.
720000	722000	Loki, what about you?
722000	725000	I don't know. There's so many to pick from.
725000	727000	I could pick something stupid, I guess.
728000	730000	I don't know.
730000	733000	Pod culture suggests Tingle for you?
733000	736000	No. Tingle's already an Assist Trophy, so I'm sorry.
736000	738000	That's just off limits now.
738000	740000	How about...
740000	742000	Okay, this is kind of stupid.
742000	744000	I don't even remember if this character is any good.
744000	746000	We're like Captain N.
746000	747000	Let's just do that.
747000	748000	Okay, why not?
748000	749000	No.
749000	751000	No, it's a terrible choice, but I love it.
751000	753000	It is a terrible choice.
753000	755000	That was good.
756000	762000	It was either that or something from the Super Mario Brothers live action movie.
762000	765000	Okay, I like that.
765000	767000	Alright, here's some comments from chat.
767000	769000	I like Bobby's suggestion. This is a good one.
769000	771000	The prince of all cosmos.
771000	773000	That's a really good suggestion. I like that.
773000	777000	I know. Let's get the kid from Wizard.
777000	779000	I'm not necessarily talking about the main character,
779000	781000	because I'm talking about what's his name.
781000	783000	California.
783000	785000	Yeah, the one that...
785000	787000	Let's get the kid from the Power Glove.
787000	789000	Oh, that guy.
789000	791000	Yeah, I think he's in jail now.
791000	795000	Fifth Dream says Ishtola for Smash from XIV.
795000	798000	Phoenix7726 suggests Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
798000	800000	Why not?
800000	803000	And then John Cena shows up there from Bobby Black Wolf.
803000	805000	Let's see, other questions.
805000	806000	Sorry, other comments.
806000	809000	Brakeman says the dog from Legacy of the Wizard.
810000	812000	And Act F says Kelowna.
812000	814000	That one was rumored some time ago,
814000	816000	but I think that might have been more wishful thinking.
816000	818000	But as we know, nothing's off limits.
818000	820000	So there you go. Alright.
820000	821000	Minecraft Steven Smash.
821000	822000	So sorry, Loki.
822000	825000	You were going to get into the not Minecon, but...
825000	828000	Yeah, so Minecraft Live is what they're calling it now.
828000	831000	It's their live event that they do in place of Minecon
831000	833000	because obviously there's no Minecon this year
833000	835000	because of COVID and everything.
835000	837000	So of course, the big announcement was
837000	839000	what's going to be in the 1.17 update,
839000	841000	and they've announced that it's going to be
841000	843000	the Minecraft Caves and Cliffs update.
843000	846000	So it's going to completely redo the cave generation
846000	849000	that's in Minecraft, as well as generating
849000	853000	elevation-specific biomes for mountains and whatnot.
853000	855000	So lots of cool stuff.
855000	857000	They showed off some new cave types,
857000	861000	including lush caves, which are full of different plant life
861000	863000	and all kinds of cool stuff.
863000	866000	They're full of different plant life
866000	869000	and also dripstone caves.
869000	871000	They have stalagmites and stalactites.
871000	874000	Giant underwater caves.
874000	876000	Lots of cool stuff.
876000	879000	So some of the new mobs being added to the game.
879000	882000	They have a new biome that's also at the very bottom
882000	884000	of the map called the Deep Dark.
884000	888000	And they have a new mob that's basically blind
888000	890000	and it detects you by vibration.
890000	893000	And it's called the Warden, which is apparently
893000	896000	like this big OP mob that's in the game now.
896000	898000	So that's pretty cool.
898000	900000	Other animals that are in the game.
900000	902000	They added a mountain goat, which is kind of cool.
902000	907000	And the oxalotl is the new kind of pet creature
907000	910000	that you can get that'll follow you through the water.
910000	912000	New ores, so like copper.
912000	915000	They have these geode things that you can get as well.
915000	917000	You can craft satchels now.
917000	919000	It's available to carry additional items with you.
919000	921000	They have a whole archeology thing
921000	923000	that they've worked into the game now.
923000	925000	So lots of exciting stuff.
925000	928000	That's, of course, all coming next summer
928000	930000	is when that's going to be coming out.
930000	932000	Aside from just the proper Minecraft as well.
932000	933000	That's a long way out.
933000	935000	Yeah, it is.
935000	938000	So outside of that, they talked about some more stuff
938000	940000	for Minecraft Dungeons.
940000	942000	So it's going to be getting cross-play support pretty soon
942000	944000	in November.
944000	947000	So it'll be able to play on all the other systems that it's on.
947000	948000	That's kind of cool.
948000	950000	New DLC coming out as well.
950000	952000	They're going to be adding a new difficulty,
952000	954000	Apocalypse Plus, to that.
954000	956000	And yeah, so Education Edition
956000	958000	is getting some more updates as well.
958000	960000	They're having a brand new map called Good Trouble
960000	962000	social justice movements around the world.
962000	964000	So they're not only talking about science and stuff,
964000	968000	but also social justice stuff they're talking about as well.
968000	970000	They have this global build...
970000	972000	That's a neat tribute. I like that.
972000	974000	Sorry, I like that they're calling it Good Trouble.
974000	976000	That's neat.
976000	979000	Yeah, and then they also have, of course,
979000	981000	this global build championship
981000	984000	that's also tied with the Minecraft Education Edition,
984000	986000	which is kind of cool.
986000	988000	They covered a little bit more, of course,
988000	991000	on the Minecraft Steve coming to Smash stuff.
991000	992000	They talked a little bit about that.
992000	994000	More creator tools coming now
994000	996000	for people looking to make stuff
996000	998000	for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
998000	1002000	So lots of new mods will be created with that.
1002000	1004000	So I'm kind of excited about that.
1004000	1006000	They did a mob vote,
1006000	1009000	which the three mobs that were being voted on.
1009000	1011000	There was two from Minecraft Earth,
1011000	1016000	which was the Moobloom and the Glow Squid.
1016000	1019000	And then they had Isolager, which was from Dungeons.
1019000	1021000	And unfortunately, the Glow Squid one,
1021000	1023000	which it's just basically a retextured squid.
1023000	1025000	It doesn't even really glow.
1025000	1028000	It just has a texture that looks like it's glowing.
1028000	1031000	That's kind of lame, but whatever.
1031000	1032000	And then, of course,
1032000	1033000	Minecraft Earth is getting some more updates as well.
1033000	1035000	They have pistons and sticky pistons,
1035000	1037000	as well as some new water-based mobs
1037000	1038000	that are becoming as well.
1038000	1041000	Did you say sticky pistons?
1041000	1043000	Yes, sticky pistons.
1043000	1044000	Sticky pistons.
1044000	1046000	Okay, I just wanted to make sure I caught that.
1046000	1047000	Yes, Rob.
1047000	1049000	Geez, don't you know that's an actual thing, right?
1049000	1051000	Yes, I know. Of course I do.
1051000	1054000	Just don't always expect to hear about sticky pistons here on OLR.
1054000	1056000	It has slime on it.
1056000	1057000	Okay, yeah.
1057000	1059000	So the blocks stick to it.
1059000	1062000	Yeah, I got you.
1062000	1064000	I haven't played Minecraft Earth since the day it came out,
1064000	1066000	but sure, got you.
1066000	1068000	Yeah, so lots of exciting stuff.
1068000	1070000	I can't wait to actually play all this stuff
1070000	1071000	when it finally does come out.
1071000	1075000	No talk about the RTX stuff,
1075000	1076000	which I'm kind of surprised as well.
1076000	1079000	I would have thought, especially with the Xbox Series X
1079000	1080000	right around the corner,
1080000	1083000	we'd be talking a little bit about RTX support,
1083000	1085000	maybe ray tracing in that version of the game,
1085000	1086000	but no mention of any of that,
1086000	1089000	so maybe that's not coming anytime soon.
1089000	1090000	Interesting.
1090000	1091000	Yeah, I would have thought that would have been
1091000	1093000	in an update that's ready to go relatively soon
1093000	1096000	once the Xbox Series X is out,
1096000	1100000	since a lot of the focus in the early previews of Xbox Series X,
1100000	1103000	because the consoles are starting to show up out in the wild,
1103000	1107000	at least in the hands of influencers and journalists.
1107000	1108000	Influencers, yeah.
1108000	1109000	Yeah, and that whole thing,
1109000	1111000	which we're not on either of those lists,
1111000	1114000	but a lot of focus is on the backwards compatibility,
1114000	1117000	and folks are talking about how much faster
1117000	1119000	the old games load up and so forth,
1119000	1122000	and you know what is running at like 60 frames a second,
1122000	1123000	et cetera, et cetera.
1123000	1126000	So it's a little surprising that they don't have
1126000	1130000	some of that show-offy stuff in Minecraft kind of ready to go,
1130000	1135000	since part of the big focus on Xbox Series X's launch
1135000	1139000	is going to be the old games all becoming new again, in a way.
1139000	1142000	Yeah, I can only imagine that the fast loading
1142000	1145000	is definitely going to have a huge benefit
1145000	1147000	in a game that's procedurally generated like that.
1147000	1148000	It's constantly loading assets.
1148000	1150000	For sure, and same thing.
1150000	1154000	Probably the first game I will play on Xbox Series X
1154000	1156000	is No Man's Sky, just to see.
1156000	1157000	Of course, yeah.
1157000	1158000	Of course, you know,
1158000	1160000	and I'll talk about that I'm still playing that game a lot,
1160000	1162000	but I will check it out,
1162000	1164000	just because that is one that I definitely expect
1164000	1167000	to look a lot better on Xbox Series X
1167000	1170000	versus old-school Xbox One that I have now,
1170000	1172000	where it probably looks the worst
1172000	1174000	compared to PC and PlayStation 4 Pro.
1174000	1177000	So, yeah, very excited to see that.
1177000	1181000	All right, I guess that's it with the Minecraft news.
1181000	1183000	Minecraft Dungeons is a lot of fun.
1183000	1185000	I need to go back and play that some more,
1185000	1187000	so the cross-play stuff is pretty cool,
1187000	1189000	because I've been playing on PC,
1189000	1192000	but I know one of my friends has been playing on Xbox One,
1192000	1194000	so that'll be nice, so we can bridge that gap.
1194000	1195000	So, cool.
1195000	1196000	Yeah, and same thing, too.
1196000	1198000	I wanted to play with my kids
1198000	1200000	or even just play with other people,
1200000	1203000	and I have it on PC right now,
1203000	1206000	so they don't have other consoles to play.
1206000	1208000	I have it getting on PC for my one son
1208000	1210000	and Switch for the other one, so...
1210000	1212000	All right, I'll wait.
1212000	1214000	Well, let's move on and talk about some of the games
1214000	1216000	that we've been playing this week.
1216000	1218000	Maybe Minecraft, maybe not.
1218000	1219000	How was your gaming week?
1219000	1222000	We'll start with Dark Sakura, as we usually do.
1222000	1226000	I, of course, have played lots of Animal Crossing.
1226000	1227000	Of course.
1227000	1228000	You?
1228000	1230000	No.
1230000	1233000	But I also got a Puyo Puyo Championship.
1233000	1235000	It was on sale, and I was like,
1235000	1238000	I like Puyo Puyo, so I got it,
1238000	1242000	and it was better once I changed the voices to Japanese,
1242000	1245000	because it kind of felt a little bit more like the old-school Puyo Puyo.
1245000	1247000	I don't know how I feel about it,
1247000	1249000	but it's nice if I just want to do, like,
1249000	1253000	a little bit of puzzle play, and it was pretty fun.
1253000	1257000	I also have been playing...
1257000	1260000	You know, I'm redoing the puzzles on Pattern
1260000	1263000	now that I have my iPad Pro,
1263000	1266000	and I'm thinking of...
1266000	1267000	I don't know.
1267000	1269000	I kind of want to try, like, a different RPG,
1269000	1274000	but even though I am paying for Final Fantasy XIV now,
1274000	1279000	I haven't started, so I'm going to see about transferring...
1279000	1280000	Well, I might just play my character
1280000	1283000	as is for a little before I decide to transfer her over
1283000	1285000	permanently to another place,
1285000	1288000	because I don't think that she's in a free company right now,
1288000	1290000	and I kind of want her to be, so...
1290000	1291000	So, same old one.
1291000	1295000	I got her to end game on whatever the second expansion was.
1295000	1297000	Heaven's Word.
1297000	1298000	Yeah.
1298000	1302000	Or Stormblood, depending on what you view as an expansion.
1302000	1305000	Well, I mean, it was the...
1305000	1308000	Whatever Heaven's Word I played?
1308000	1310000	If it was dragons, it was Heaven's Word.
1310000	1314000	If it was Doma and the Far East type stuff,
1314000	1316000	it was Stormblood.
1316000	1318000	I didn't do that one, I know for sure,
1318000	1320000	but when I bought the last expansion,
1320000	1322000	it came with Stormblood.
1322000	1323000	Oh, nice.
1323000	1325000	Yeah, when I bought it, I paid for one expansion,
1325000	1328000	but it gave me two, so that was cool.
1328000	1330000	Yeah, suck that, World of Warcraft.
1330000	1333000	You should be that nice.
1333000	1334000	You know.
1334000	1339000	But anyway, I've just been, you know,
1339000	1341000	looking into just some things like that,
1341000	1344000	and playing, you know, some Outrun,
1344000	1350000	and we had Mario 35, which I don't like.
1350000	1351000	Oh, why is that?
1351000	1353000	That kind of shit annoys me.
1353000	1356000	I also don't like Tetris 99 for the same reason.
1356000	1358000	But Dan sure is into it,
1358000	1360000	and I watched him hit, like, first place,
1360000	1362000	like, four games in a row.
1362000	1363000	Dang.
1363000	1366000	So, he's just all kinds of on top of it,
1366000	1368000	and really good at it, so...
1368000	1371000	I don't actually think that I have seen him
1371000	1374000	finish less than 10th place at all.
1374000	1377000	Oh, you should have seen me finish 34th the other day.
1377000	1379000	That was a hoot and a holler.
1379000	1382000	Well, I honestly think that they should keep it up.
1382000	1384000	Dan seems to really enjoy it.
1384000	1388000	It makes him happy, and I'm, you know,
1388000	1390000	sometimes, like, watching him play,
1390000	1392000	but it's just way too frustrating for me.
1392000	1394000	I'm just totally not into it that much,
1394000	1397000	so, you know, if I'm going to play,
1397000	1401000	I actually don't like competitive play that much,
1401000	1405000	you know, so, for me, it's just, you know,
1405000	1407000	I want to play something that's a little fun.
1407000	1408000	I want to play with my friends.
1408000	1412000	I liked, you know, multiplayer for Mass Effect 3.
1412000	1414000	I think that was one of the last things.
1414000	1415000	No, I take that back.
1415000	1416000	I played Heroes of the Storm.
1416000	1417000	Oh, yeah.
1417000	1419000	Remember, because I was playing that with y'all,
1419000	1421000	and then I said I wasn't going to play,
1421000	1423000	do anything more with Blizzard.
1424000	1428000	So, but, yeah, I'm getting myself back into it,
1428000	1434000	and I'm also working on something
1434000	1436000	that will be linking back to VoG.
1436000	1437000	I've brought it up in the past,
1437000	1441000	and now it's actually happening,
1441000	1443000	and there will be games spoken of on it,
1443000	1446000	but that is all thou shalt know.
1446000	1447000	Okay.
1447000	1448000	Publicly. Publicly.
1448000	1449000	Even I don't think I know what it is.
1449000	1450000	All right.
1450000	1451000	You kind of know what it is.
1451000	1452000	I brought it up to you in the past,
1452000	1453000	but it's actually happening.
1453000	1454000	Yeah.
1454000	1455000	Okay.
1455000	1456000	We'll have to see what it is.
1456000	1457000	All right.
1457000	1458000	Let's see.
1458000	1459000	Loki, how about you?
1459000	1460000	How was your gaming week?
1460000	1464000	I played a little bit of Mario 35 as well,
1464000	1465000	so that was fun.
1465000	1467000	I only got a few games in before my kids
1467000	1469000	wanted to switch back.
1469000	1472000	I played a bit of Minecraft Bedrock again.
1472000	1475000	I just was going in and working on,
1475000	1478000	we're building a giant amusement park next to the house,
1478000	1480000	so I was working on mapping out
1480000	1485000	an extremely elaborate roller coaster for that,
1485000	1487000	so I've been working on that,
1487000	1490000	and then what else?
1490000	1494000	I pretty much did a little bit of Orna.
1494000	1495000	Yeah.
1495000	1496000	That was about it.
1496000	1497000	All right.
1497000	1499000	As far as my gaming week goes,
1499000	1501000	a lot of the same stuff I've been talking about,
1501000	1503000	still working on Final Fantasy XIV,
1503000	1507000	my mission to level all my crafters and gatherers.
1507000	1509000	I've been kind of stuck having to go back
1509000	1513000	and do all of the quests for the various crafting classes,
1513000	1516000	but I've made a lot of progress with that the past couple days,
1516000	1519000	so that was good, so I've made progress on that.
1519000	1522000	I've been spending a lot of time still with No Man's Sky.
1522000	1523000	That's still going.
1523000	1526000	I'm past 20 hours on my save file at this point,
1526000	1528000	and I've definitely seen things.
1528000	1532000	I didn't even know there was Red Star solar systems
1532000	1534000	and this whole type of thing that was in the game
1534000	1535000	that I'm just learning about.
1535000	1538000	Apparently, there's Green and Blue Star solar systems too.
1538000	1539000	That Red Star solar system,
1539000	1541000	for those of you that have played No Man's Sky
1541000	1544000	and know what I'm talking about with these different star solar systems,
1544000	1547000	the planets in my Red Star system
1547000	1550000	were some of the scariest shit I have ever seen.
1550000	1555000	That was an October surprise, let me tell you.
1555000	1558000	There was that one planet that was just covered in clouds,
1558000	1560000	and the minute I get through the clouds,
1560000	1562000	I feel like I'm going to run into the ground,
1562000	1564000	and it's like a volcanic planet where it's like,
1564000	1567000	warning, there is a lava storm coming your way.
1567000	1569000	I'm like, lava storm?
1569000	1573000	I just want to grab some copper and get the fuck out of here.
1573000	1574000	So yeah, that was scary.
1574000	1576000	Red is like the first level,
1576000	1579000	so apparently there is green and then there's blue.
1579000	1582000	So I just can't wait to see what nightmares await in those areas.
1582000	1583000	Maybe I just got really lucky.
1583000	1584000	I don't know.
1584000	1589000	I've been naming all of my universes after musicians and celebrities.
1589000	1593000	So I have a system when I play No Man's Sky
1593000	1595000	to remember what systems is what.
1595000	1598000	I start my first system with A.
1598000	1600000	So ABBA was my first system.
1600000	1602000	Then B, Britney.
1602000	1605000	So my Red Star system is Gaga,
1605000	1607000	because of course it is.
1607000	1611000	And I think I just got last night to Adina,
1611000	1614000	so I'm on I.
1614000	1617000	So we're working our way there.
1617000	1618000	There you go.
1618000	1619000	I don't know what my J.
1619000	1621000	Oh no, J is going to be Janet.
1621000	1622000	That's what it's going to be.
1622000	1623000	Janet Jackson.
1623000	1625000	So I'm making my way through those.
1625000	1628000	Other games I've been playing this week as far as new games.
1628000	1630000	I have been playing Super Mario 35,
1630000	1632000	would be the new game I've played this week.
1632000	1634000	I'm not quite as good as Dan apparently,
1634000	1637000	but I've made my way to level 17 or 18.
1637000	1639000	It's neat.
1639000	1642000	I think there's an interesting strategy to it as to,
1642000	1646000	you don't really want to just warp back and forth necessarily
1646000	1648000	between 1-1 and 1-2,
1648000	1650000	even though those levels are easy,
1650000	1653000	because the way you really screw up other people,
1653000	1655000	you have to be able to send over Bowser's.
1655000	1658000	Because if you haven't played Super Mario 35 yet basically,
1658000	1663000	the enemies you kill in your game get sent over to someone else's game.
1663000	1666000	But they are literally the enemies you are killing.
1666000	1668000	So if you're killing Goombas and Turtles, then no big deal.
1668000	1670000	You're sending Goombas and Turtles to other people's games.
1670000	1674000	But when you start killing things like Bloopers in the underwater level,
1674000	1677000	Cheep Cheeps in the bridge levels, and literally Bowser,
1677000	1681000	and you can drop those mobs in people's 1-1 and 1-2 games,
1681000	1683000	that's when you start murdering people.
1683000	1688000	So the game is an interesting balance between racking up enough time,
1688000	1690000	because you also have a clock that's pretty aggressive,
1690000	1693000	and the way you add time to the clock is killing enemies,
1693000	1697000	and you get a lot more time killing enemies not with a fireball
1697000	1700000	than you do, you get one second if you kill them with a fireball.
1700000	1702000	The best thing you can do,
1702000	1706000	turtle shell, kick the turtle shell and knock over as many enemies as you can,
1706000	1708000	and don't get hit by the ricochet.
1708000	1710000	If you can do that kind of as you're getting the game started
1710000	1712000	and rack up some time on the clock,
1712000	1714000	that's what I found to be the best strategy,
1714000	1719000	although I can't get further than fifth place was the best I did.
1719000	1722000	Or if you collect more fire flowers after you have a fire flower,
1722000	1724000	that's 15 seconds each time.
1724000	1725000	That is also very good.
1725000	1730000	And I have found that I sit on the fire flower,
1730000	1732000	and I really try to hold that as long as I can,
1732000	1735000	and if I lose it, that's when I spin the roulette wheel.
1735000	1739000	I save all my coins to try to get fire power back as fast as possible
1739000	1741000	if I lose it, because that's the only-
1741000	1743000	Sam is always spinning the roulette.
1743000	1745000	He just uses it like it's going out of style.
1745000	1747000	Really? See, I wait until I need it,
1747000	1749000	because that way I can get fire back,
1749000	1753000	because that's the only way you can get rid of Bowser bloopers
1753000	1755000	and those types of things that you can't-
1755000	1757000	You also get more points for hitting-
1757000	1762000	You also get more for hitting the axe instead of shooting Bowser,
1762000	1763000	getting rid of him a different way.
1763000	1764000	Oh, interesting.
1764000	1766000	I actually didn't know that. Okay. Good to know.
1766000	1767000	You get a lot more coins for that.
1767000	1770000	And the flagpole gives you more time the higher you get up on it.
1770000	1771000	So it's interesting.
1771000	1773000	It is an interesting dynamic they have set up,
1773000	1776000	but on one hand, I don't know if it's going to have
1776000	1779000	that kind of longevity to get past March.
1779000	1783000	So I sort of see why there's an end date on it,
1783000	1785000	although part of me kind of wishes,
1785000	1788000	well, couldn't they maybe innovate on the game
1788000	1792000	by doing some lost levels in it or some Mario 3 levels
1792000	1796000	or kind of mixing it up like that to make the game last a little longer.
1796000	1799000	But I'm making it sound like it's easy to make a game
1799000	1801000	and it's not always easy to make a game.
1801000	1805000	And I don't know how much Super Mario Brothers existing
1805000	1807000	as a game already necessarily helped them.
1807000	1808000	What I mean is for all-
1808000	1810000	They need to rebuild it from the ground up.
1810000	1814000	They probably had to rebuild it from the ground up to make this work.
1814000	1817000	So it may not be as easy as we all assume it is.
1817000	1821000	So I'm trying to be mindful of that.
1821000	1825000	But I would hope that there will still be some way to revisit this
1825000	1827000	even after they shut down the online servers.
1827000	1829000	I wish they'd just do an AI mode or something
1829000	1832000	just for history and preservation
1832000	1836000	because this is an interesting little twist on Mario, if nothing else.
1836000	1839000	So, all right.
1839000	1841000	Well, that's it for my gaming week.
1841000	1843000	So I think that's everybody's week.
1843000	1844000	Let me do some quick housekeeping real quick,
1844000	1847000	and then we'll get into the rest of the news.
1847000	1851000	So first off, there's not going to be a show next week.
1851000	1854000	No live show next week. No tape show either, actually.
1854000	1856000	I am going on a trip.
1856000	1858000	Yes, I'm aware there's a pandemic.
1858000	1862000	Don't worry, everything is precaution and all that good stuff.
1862000	1863000	So don't worry about that.
1863000	1866000	I am not going to an event on the White House lawn,
1866000	1869000	so I should be pretty safe, all things considered.
1869000	1872000	Yeah, that's all I'm going to say about that.
1872000	1874000	There's no rose gardens for you.
1874000	1875000	No.
1875000	1878000	Well, there might be a rose garden, but just not that one.
1878000	1881000	So anyway, I will be gone.
1881000	1883000	However, I believe Dark Sakura,
1883000	1885000	you said you're going to be doing something here
1885000	1888000	for at least our Twitch crowd on Sunday.
1888000	1890000	Yeah, I think I'll stream for a little bit.
1890000	1893000	Probably just something, whatever's on my computer.
1893000	1895000	I'm just going to do like a random stream.
1895000	1896000	We'll see what it is.
1896000	1899000	I mean, maybe it'll be me getting back into Final Fantasy XIV.
1899000	1903000	Maybe it'll be stuff. Who knows?
1904000	1906000	Yeah, we'll see what happens.
1906000	1909000	I'll try to get it going around the same time.
1909000	1912000	I don't have my camera set up done
1912000	1917000	because honestly, I'm going to be probably retiring my PC soon.
1917000	1918000	So we'll see.
1918000	1919000	All right.
1919000	1922000	So Bobby Black Wolf and Dark Sakura next week.
1922000	1924000	So yes, Bobby will still be here next week.
1924000	1926000	So the live crowd has something to watch.
1926000	1928000	Unfortunately, for the podcast crowd,
1928000	1930000	it'll just have to be a week to catch up
1930000	1932000	on some other great indie podcasts next week.
1932000	1935000	Loki, maybe you'll get some time to work on your game.
1935000	1937000	I've been doing that all week.
1937000	1939000	You should have Dark Sakura play your game.
1939000	1941000	I like that idea.
1941000	1944000	But he's trying to keep it a surprise.
1944000	1946000	All right. I tried. I tried. It was close.
1946000	1947000	All right.
1947000	1950000	I got your back, Loki.
1950000	1954000	And you're going to get the pizza when he finally finishes.
1954000	1956000	This has to be a big event.
1956000	1960000	You know what? I'll go a step further.
1960000	1963000	I will make you a pizza.
1965000	1969000	Dark Sakura doesn't often say she's going to get in the kitchen
1969000	1970000	and make someone a meal.
1970000	1973000	So this is this is a big thing.
1973000	1976000	I make a pretty good homemade pizza dough.
1976000	1978000	I make homemade sauce.
1978000	1982000	I do the whole thing and we we bake it in a cast iron skillet.
1982000	1984000	OK. All right. I'm excited.
1984000	1985000	All right.
1985000	1987000	If you've never had pizza out of the cast iron skillet,
1987000	1989000	you are totally missing out.
1989000	1990000	All right. So look forward to that.
1990000	1994000	Do you think by the end of the year, Loki, is this going to be a 20 20?
1994000	1997000	Maybe it'll it'll make the pain and the suffering worth it.
1997000	1999000	Loki, the way I get to play a Loki game at the end of the year.
1999000	2001000	I'm hoping to have it done this month.
2001000	2004000	So, oh, OK. I'm excited.
2004000	2006000	Yeah. All right. Make you a spooky pizza.
2006000	2009000	All right. Well, good luck. Hope you don't get me in it.
2009000	2012000	I also want to give a quick shout out for the VOG network roundtables.
2012000	2014000	That side project is still going.
2014000	2019000	This week, I sat down with act deaf to SSJ 100, Matt and Chad Starzik to talk about.
2019000	2021000	And with that group, you know, we were talking about Pokemon.
2021000	2024000	So we talked about and we'll get into it here later on.
2024000	2025000	So we'll still cover it.
2025000	2031000	But we kind of had a side conversation with a different group on the Pokemon go updates and some of that,
2031000	2034000	as well as the Pokemon direct from earlier this week.
2034000	2037000	So check that out over at VOG network dot com.
2037000	2041000	Probably won't be around table next week just because of my trip and everything.
2041000	2042000	It's going to kind of get in the way.
2042000	2049000	If something really big happens on Monday or Tuesday, then I'll try to throw something together, but probably not.
2049000	2051000	So we'll get back to that in a couple of weeks.
2051000	2055000	All right. Anyhow, let's move on and get into some gaming news.
2055000	2057000	Loki, we'll start with you.
2057000	2061000	Yeah. So let's talk about delays, more delays.
2061000	2068000	So World of Warcraft Shadowlands was supposed to be coming out pretty soon.
2068000	2072000	And unfortunately, they announced that it has been delayed.
2072000	2080000	So they're going to be doing a pre patch updates expected in the next week or so on October 13th.
2080000	2088000	But of course, you know, they're still going to be working on the expansion for the coming future.
2088000	2093000	Because they yeah, they basically said, you know, we believe it will be something special.
2093000	2096000	And we've heard from many of you who feel the same.
2096000	2100000	We need this extra time to ensure Shadowlands lives up to its full potential.
2100000	2107000	So, yeah, it needs to be good because wow, I mean, there's still a lot of very, very loyal fans of World of Warcraft.
2107000	2113000	I still have a lot on my Twitter feed because of the time that I did that show Horde House, which kind of a spin off of this one.
2113000	2118000	When I did that a few years ago, we, you know, pretty much exclusively talked about wow for a period on that show.
2118000	2120000	And I made a lot of friends in the community that way.
2120000	2125000	And I have a lot of them that are still really jazzed about what's going on with wow and the changes and everything.
2125000	2131000	But, you know, a lot of people have fallen out of wow, too, and I'm more in that crowd.
2131000	2140000	So this next expansion really kind of kind of needs to be good, not just to impress the current base that's there, but to try to woo people back.
2141000	2150000	And a lot of problems with this last expansion, the Battle for Azeroth, had to do with like the Azerite grinding and some of what was going on in the endgame.
2150000	2157000	And it's interesting to hear about the reason apparently behind the delay for this one, Shadowlands, has to do with the endgame.
2157000	2163000	So they're really trying to make sure they get it right and not have that screwed up when it launches, and that's important.
2163000	2171000	But I don't think this is going to get delayed a terribly long time because if they're doing the pre-patch, they hadn't announced the date for the pre-patch yet.
2171000	2175000	So when they announced the delay, they said, but at least you're getting the pre-patch next week.
2175000	2181000	And that is a pretty big deal because a lot of the systems in Shadowlands will be in place, a lot of the class balancing.
2181000	2191000	I believe the level squish because they're doing the great level squish where characters are going to be down now to level 50 and the expansion will take you through 60.
2191000	2198000	And that's big because it was up to like 110, 120, I don't know, it was unreal. So the big squish is coming.
2198000	2208000	I have friends that are really excited about it and like Shane and stuff, they've really been trying to get me to come back to WoW, but I just, I'm not feeling it.
2209000	2211000	I'm way done with it.
2211000	2220000	The reviews for this expansion would have to be stunning. And even then, I'm kind of like, I got enough going on between No Man's Sky and anything else.
2220000	2229000	I don't want to pay for two MMOs. I won't play anything else. So I don't know, maybe if the reviews were like stunning for this, but I'm not exactly going to hold my breath.
2229000	2237000	But I do hope for great things for the folks that are still loving WoW and all my friends that I did make that are still playing that game over there. So we'll see.
2237000	2248000	Miltonius Games in our chat says, I had PTO put aside for it, and I probably won't be able to get that time off later in the year, but I'm still glad they won't release it if they don't think it is ready to go.
2248000	2254000	You know, there were some people on Twitter, though, that were throwing a fit about, I took the day off for this and...
2254000	2263000	And my honest to God reaction was, if you had the ability to take the day off for a video game, you're having a better 2020 than a lot of people.
2263000	2270000	And I'm not reading you with that comment, but the folks on Twitter that were responding so crappily.
2270000	2277000	So you cancel your time off and do something else. I swear to God, people complain about this. People complain about Smash announcements.
2277000	2278000	Start a hobby.
2278000	2283000	It's just like so many, complaining cannot be a hobby of yours.
2283000	2285000	Write a blog post for us so we can put it on the website.
2285000	2289000	Yes, do a round table so we can post on the website, I guess.
2289000	2296000	Or at least if you're going to complain about it, make YouTube videos complaining about it, because at least then you might be able to make something out of that.
2296000	2301000	But just complaining about everything is just not a way to go through life.
2301000	2308000	I get the disappointment. Especially because the Warcraft folks have been waiting a while.
2308000	2311000	Battle for Azeroth has been the live expansion for quite some time.
2311000	2315000	It's 2020! You're not used to disappointment yet? I mean, come on.
2319000	2323000	I guess that's really all that needs to be said, isn't it? All right.
2323000	2329000	Let's move on. Let's talk about, I think this is another thing that's going to have people complaining.
2329000	2334000	And this has to do with the switching of the buttons on the PlayStation 5.
2334000	2342000	And not necessarily everybody listening is going to understand this and how this is a big deal, but let me tell you, this is a big deal.
2342000	2347000	And Dark Soccer, I don't know if you've heard about this yet, but you're going to have a reaction to this too, I'm sure.
2347000	2358000	So in Japan, for the longest time, what happens with the circle and the X button is switched from what we know in the U.S., right?
2358000	2365000	So usually X confirms here in the U.S., and in Japan, circle confirms, right? So it's a little bit backwards.
2365000	2369000	Which makes fucking sense. It's stupid over here.
2369000	2370000	Well, guess what?
2370000	2371000	You're getting the stupid way.
2371000	2373000	Guess what? Japan's getting the stupid way.
2373000	2379000	So it has been confirmed because of some PlayStation 5 previews going on.
2379000	2387000	The PR confirmed to Japanese media, the X button will now be used to confirm universally around the globe.
2387000	2393000	So this means for the last, what, PlayStation's been around, what, 25 years, and they've been used to it the other way around.
2393000	2398000	So, I mean, again, for those of us that are kind of used to it this way in the States or Europe, no change.
2398000	2403000	This isn't news that affects us. But for people in Japan, this is big.
2403000	2408000	And, you know, if you don't understand it, try going and play a Japanese game.
2408000	2415000	Now, I say that I knew Dark Sakura was going to have a reaction to this because I was like, oh, that is going to be tricky.
2415000	2418000	Because we used to import shit all the time and still do, I think.
2418000	2425000	For like PlayStation 2, you know, especially with the Bimani games, everything was reversed, right?
2425000	2428000	So we kind of got used to that. And it is a different way of thinking.
2428000	2433000	And, you know, you do have to kind of put on the different hat. But this is going to be big.
2433000	2436000	It's going to be annoying.
2436000	2443000	Well, they have the accessibility options, I'm assuming, that's going to carry over from PlayStation 4 where you can remap your buttons.
2443000	2447000	I don't understand what's the deal. If you don't like it, then just switch it back.
2447000	2453000	And I actually, for the most part, I agree, but there is a key phrase that you said there, Loki, and that is, I'm assuming.
2453000	2462000	We don't have confirmation about the PlayStation 4's interface because the interface was hidden from this preview that folks got to see of the PlayStation 5.
2462000	2465000	So we still don't know what the PlayStation interface looks like.
2465000	2472000	The hope is, just from an accessibility perspective, that yes, you'll be able to flip the buttons around.
2472000	2475000	And yeah, I think that will be the easy solution.
2476000	2483000	And a lot of people kind of pointed this out as well online is, why don't they just bake it into the firmware that you have a toggle?
2483000	2490000	Like, you can pick. Most games now in this day and age let you pick. Do you want X to confirm or circle to confirm? And it's in the options.
2490000	2495000	So it is kind of interesting that Sony is forcing this.
2495000	2503000	I'm not sure why they want to make it the same everywhere and not just let you have an option. That's weird.
2503000	2508000	Because that's the Sony way. No options, only forcing.
2508000	2515000	I guess so. But you can imagine there's a lot of Japanese audience that is going to have their world right.
2515000	2520000	I don't know if AkumaJP is still able to join us live. I haven't seen him on a Sunday in a while.
2520000	2527000	I see him on Twitter once in a while, but I'd be very curious what his thoughts are on this or anybody that is used to the Japanese way.
2527000	2533000	After all, they do believe that force feedback is not important. That's why they don't care about what you want.
2533000	2536000	They're just going to force you to do it.
2536000	2541000	ActDeft in chat says, all I can say is finally. I love the stupid way. I'm stupid.
2541000	2545000	ActDeft, you're not stupid. You've just been conditioned a certain way.
2545000	2553000	DarkTosuya says, I hadn't thought about it much until I got my Japanese PS2 this year. So interesting to see them change it over there.
2554000	2560000	Let's see. ActDeft says, I always make the mistake of pressing X in some Japanese games and it's frustrating.
2560000	2568000	Bobby Blackwool says, I still have to remember I'm playing a Switch or an Xbox PS game because on the Switch, the confirm button is the right button and not the bottom button.
2568000	2573000	And Questbuster brings up a game that's been getting a lot of attention on Twitch lately.
2573000	2578000	And I know I've seen a lot of people playing this. Genshin Impact. Have you guys seen this game?
2578000	2587000	It looks like Xenoblade, but kind of like anime to me. And it's doing crazy business on Twitch. It's very interesting.
2587000	2588000	But anyway, Questbuster...
2588000	2590000	I'm looking at the website.
2590000	2591000	Yeah. Questbuster...
2591000	2594000	I was unaware Xenoblade was not anime.
2594000	2597000	Well, look at this game and then tell me I'm wrong.
2597000	2598000	So it's more anime?
2598000	2600000	Yeah, it's more anime.
2600000	2601000	Okay.
2601000	2605000	Questbuster says, Genshin Impact is like this. The O position is to confirm and the X position is to exit.
2605000	2611000	Always mixes me up when I play it, at least on PC. And VG Realness confirms it's super anime.
2611000	2613000	Act Def calls it Breath of the Anime.
2613000	2617000	Yeah, I got a Breath of the Wild vibe from it just looking at it.
2617000	2620000	Yeah, maybe there's something for you to stream next week. There's a lot of people playing this right now.
2620000	2625000	And I haven't caught it yet, but it's one I'm curious about. I will say that.
2625000	2626000	I'll look into it.
2626000	2627000	Yeah, so.
2627000	2631000	Alright, so there you go. Big changes for the PlayStation 5 in Japan.
2631000	2632000	Let's move on.
2632000	2637000	Dark Sakura, a game that I don't think I've checked in on on a week and a half.
2637000	2638000	I'm a bad person.
2638000	2639000	Girl.
2639000	2640000	Poor ketchup.
2640000	2641000	Pumpkins.
2641000	2642000	Ketchup probably doesn't sound like a lover anymore.
2642000	2643000	Scoopy stuff.
2643000	2644000	But space.
2644000	2645000	I'm in space.
2645000	2648000	Space.
2648000	2651000	I think I can do a pretty good fake digital voice there.
2651000	2652000	That's me playing No Man's Sky.
2652000	2653000	Anyway.
2653000	2656000	Oh, okay.
2656000	2658000	I've been watching your Twitter.
2659000	2666000	But at any rate, yeah, we did have the new fall update for Animal Crossing New Horizons.
2666000	2671000	One point five came out that gives us the Halloween event and more autumn themed content.
2671000	2677000	You know, we can I know we're still shaking those trees for our pine cones and acorns,
2677000	2686000	which some of those items play into the new crafting that involves pumpkins, which is also funny because some of the items that you can get recipes for.
2687000	2689000	Also, you can buy as a single buy item.
2689000	2695000	It looks and it's only one person who lives on your island can buy it.
2695000	2697000	But yeah, you're growing pumpkins.
2697000	2706000	So the kind of farming thing that had been hinted at before seems to be fully incorporated, at least in terms of raising your pumpkins.
2706000	2714000	So at any rate, it looks like there is going to be another update in November.
2714000	2732000	The of course, the images that were were posted along with it were Franklin the Turkey and Jingle the Reindeer, who, you know, Franklin had the Thanksgiving Harvest Festival thing and Toy Day was for Jingle.
2732000	2736000	Jingle's fucking freaky, almost as freaky as Zipper.
2736000	2745000	But we don't know exactly if they're going to work the same way as before, but hopefully we'll we'll get a lot more good stuff.
2745000	2760000	You know, one of the other things with this current update is that you can revisit dream so you can visit dream islands that you visited before are going to show up on a list so that you don't have to re enter the code.
2760000	2770000	And then there's also going to be Animal Crossing amiibo card reissues series one through series for six bucks pack.
2770000	2776000	Now, I still have all of the NPCs.
2776000	2780000	So I'm probably going to those still buy them and get a new binder to put them in.
2780000	2792000	But the Animal Crossing edition switch console is also going to be returning to the stores which basically means that I might. I hope the pro controller does as well because that's what I want to get.
2792000	2799000	I am having stupid drift on my favorite joy cons right now, my, my, my black ones.
2799000	2814000	So freaking annoying. The drift is bad like, okay, I'll put this in there. You know, when I went into the museum to go, you know, try to get my fossils appraised right.
2814000	2826000	And I had to get up to do something with the cat and when I came back, my character was sitting in the butterfly room with it doing that little wobble thing when you keep trying to get up in the wrong direction.
2826000	2838000	Yeah, yeah. So, you know, I was like, I don't think it made the show world tonight but Nintendo has been having to kind of defend that in court a little bit, and the lawyers were kind of given this line about, oh, it's not a problem it's not a widespread
2838000	2852000	problem, or, you know, they're kind of, but it also and there was a good discussion of this on our discord over at vog network.com slash discord, and I kind of agree that like well, the lawyers can exactly admit, yes, there's a problem, because they're there
2852000	2867000	to defend Nintendo, whether we like it or not. So, yeah, if the lawyers were to go yeah there's a problem, then Nintendo is going to lose on the spot so I, but that headline is kind of everywhere about Nintendo says there's no problem with joy cons well in court
2867000	2876000	they kind of have to but I think we all know, you know, if it hasn't already been ordered that they fix those things for free which I think Nintendo has been doing.
2877000	2885000	But there might there might be some cash thing as a, but it'll be like $5. So we'll see.
2885000	2900000	Well, the big thing is, is that, you know, I actually what I might do is that if I go to send mine in, I might document the process for people you know kind of bloggy style bloggy style.
2900000	2921000	But I knew it was bad when I was even watching a video of Oscar the WWE Raw Champion women's Raw Champion, who's absolutely freaking adorable kind of on TV on on YouTube, where she sat and fixed her own joy con.
2921000	2928000	I was like what the hell does she have to do with the joy con. Okay, she has a video. Well, she also build a one up cabinet and all kinds of stuff.
2928000	2934000	Hey, so did I be side step. The Kirby side step is so adorable.
2934000	2945000	Anyway, but yeah, you know when I sit in watching like her fix one of them, I was like, Yeah, I'm gonna have Nintendo do that for me. Thank you very much.
2945000	2959000	But you know, but it's bad when you've got, you know, pretty much celebrities going to see yeah my mind is doing the same thing, same thing. So I'll document the process when I said, I just have to get another joy con to replace it in the interim.
2959000	2974000	I'm looking in chat, let's see Bobby Blackwell points out the Oscar is a former DS game developer, as the show 100 Matt says Oscar was a game tester before wrestling look, I'm 42 years old and the only Oscar, I remember, came on this show after she was on a show called
2974000	2979000	the tester, and was like, I don't know second or third voted off the island. Do you remember that.
2980000	2988000	That's the only Oscar I remember and then she turned, she was on another reality show she's on the nerd, nerd show years later.
2988000	2994000	And I'm sorry I'm doing just like the thing is, yeah, you're telling me stuff I already know.
2994000	3005000	People don't know that I already know more than I seem to let on. So, well I don't. So there. I didn't know any of that. So, you know, you can just buy replacement.
3005000	3011000	parts to replace the analog stick on those joy cons I've done that already for four of them.
3011000	3024000	Three of the four work fine this last one's being a little bit fiddly but the rest of them were just fine. So I just have to figure out what's wrong there I think it's, they have the ribbon cables, they have to like shove in to their connectors
3024000	3040000	and they don't they didn't design it very well and so it's, I don't think it's getting pushed in all the way, and so it's causing problems but yeah it's like 10 bucks in parts there, fix it and then like you get through I fix it like the tools are like another five.
3040000	3052000	It's really cheap. What the fuck is happening on Festers quest on your screen they're all like, I don't know, strange awkward fist motion is that the end of the game, it must be probably, they're all cheering for the Adams family.
3052000	3056000	That's definitely the old back to sorry story. Sorry, Jamie.
3056000	3066000	And also going on right now is that you can buy Halloween costumes at the evil sisters, which I've just been buying and giving to people so that I have them in my catalog.
3066000	3071000	So, so yeah, you know, pretty, pretty cool stuff.
3071000	3082000	If you are playing and don't have me on your friends list. Shoot me a message on my Twitter at dark Sakura and maybe we'll play some animal crossing together.
3082000	3086000	And maybe I'll get back into it I have to get catch up in a costume or something.
3086000	3089000	You need I still need to give you your ketchup.
3089000	3104000	Oh, that's right. Yeah, I'm excited about that. I got Robin ketchup plushie. So my time, my time with Animal Crossing maybe temporary but my love of ketchup is eternal, just to make that very clear welcome to both versions of ketchup.
3104000	3106000	All right.
3106000	3108000	Let's move on Loki.
3108000	3120000	All right, so this is another kind of head scratcher but apparently Google had announced a bunch of new products coming out including a brand new Chromecast.
3120000	3138000	And you would think that being a Chromecast and, you know, working with your TV and stuff that would probably support. I don't know, the stadia service that they have well apparently no it does not support stadia at all yet.
3138000	3141000	That's coming sometime next year.
3141000	3149000	Why that doesn't make any sense. But that's apparently what they're doing. So, fantastic.
3149000	3160000	Glad to see Google supporting their own services. Google is fuck this thing so hard and they have nobody but themselves to blame and I'm sorry to any stadia fans out there because I do know people that use the service and enjoy it, and I'm not trying to
3160000	3176000	knock it. I'm actually kind of angry for you that Google isn't doing a better job trying to prop this service up because I, I'm reasonable and I understand 2020 has been a shit year still March should have been about the timeframe that we were seeing stadia available
3176000	3191000	to people in just their web browser, wherever it was supposed to be on more in more places and like none of that is happening at all. And I'm not so sure the pandemic is to really blame for that at this point, especially if Google is continuing to put out these
3191000	3195000	new devices and not even support their own shit on it like here's depressing.
3195000	3209000	The other way is so mad at those. So not only are they not supporting it with their brand new device but that brand new devices replacing their Chromecast ultra which did actually play stadia games, and if that's being discontinued.
3209000	3222000	So, the problem is, this was Google's opportunity to get the jump on everyone else wanting to get in there. We just talked last week about Amazon and the Luna service because so now that's going to show up.
3222000	3235000	X cloud, you know, we're going to see more and more of that as Xbox Series X launches and obviously game pass is already a big deal. And when that gets coupled with x cloud that's going to be a huge deal so it's it's just really frustrating to watch Google
3235000	3239000	kind of piss this away, and that's my point.
3239000	3244000	Yeah, I'm just, I don't, I don't get it. Yeah.
3245000	3254000	It's not great. Looking in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network Miltonians games says, Google is real good and not supporting their services.
3254000	3267000	Act F says don't want to say we said so about stadia but we totally said so I just feel bad for people that are adopting it and trying to make it their thing and then it's like, you know, to watch them just kind of let it go is there's
3267000	3281000	here's the ironic part about it though is so the new Chromecast that they have. While it's not officially supported you can sideload the x cloud service on to that, and actually run x cloud on that brand new.
3281000	3290000	Oh, that's interesting gas, but you can't use stadia yikes fun time, big yikes. All right, let's talk a little bit about some Pokemon news.
3290000	3305000	So there was a Pokemon DLC direct of sorts this week that talked a little bit about the crown tundra DLC the second set of DLC for Pokemon sword and shield, and it revealed some new things about the expansion, including some new Pokemon, like
3305000	3312000	Galarian version of slow king that's going to be kind of like a psychic type of slow king kind of cool.
3312000	3323000	There's a gigantic Max Mel metal, that's going to be coming into the game that I believe is only available through a connection with Pokemon go somehow I don't remember all the details on that but seeing as Mel metal kind of comes in through Pokemon
3323000	3336000	go that makes sense. So there will be that dynamax adventures where you're going to be teaming up with other trainers to go through a Pokemon den, so it's kind of like you're going to use a temporary team to do it so it's kind of like a dungeon a special
3336000	3349000	dungeon of sorts, and then more legendary Pokemon Of course we knew they were going to be making a comeback so a lot of old legendaries coming back, and a special event with Pikachu, which means you can go back into sword or shield and you can get
3349000	3362000	Pikachu and I guess, eight different caps, just like in Pokemon go they love to give away the Pokemon with the different caps. And then they also talked briefly in the presentation about the connection between Pokemon go and Pokemon home, and that is going to be
3362000	3378000	implemented by the end of the year. So you'll be able to send Pokemon that you got in Pokemon go over to Pokemon home. How often and how frequent and how free that is yet to be determined this feature was getting a lot of shit initially, because it looked
3378000	3393000	like I guess the data miners found that there are coins involved in Pokemon go to be able to transfer Pokemon over, but it does appear, and I think Pokemon, excuse me Niantic clarified after the fact, you'll be able to do some for free, and then like there'll be a
3393000	3399000	cool down and then if you want to go around the cool down you have to pay coins. So that's stupid.
3399000	3409000	But wasn't it Pokemon home that they had like the arbitrary like limits to the number of Pokemon that they stored or something like that.
3409000	3423000	Was that that same service I don't remember I don't remember if it was that or if it was the one before it, that was on the 3ds, so I don't totally remember but anyway, there's, there's that and then of course there's a lot of discussion on Pokemon go this week.
3423000	3438000	Pokemon go sunset quite a few of the COVID-19 precautions, because from their perspective, I don't think they're trying to say the pandemic is over, but they are saying that people are going outside and exercising so the things that they were
3438000	3451000	kind of cutting back that you have to go outside and walk around to do they don't really see the need to do that anymore, because even in spite of the pandemic people are still trying to be active and walk around and do those sorts of things.
3451000	3454000	So, shouldn't be encouraging people.
3454000	3461000	Yeah, it's um, you know, I think it's a little soon to be doing that and it's interesting because Niantic has done this across the board.
3461000	3467000	Ingress also sunset some of the changes they had for the pandemic.
3467000	3476000	I'm assuming the Harry Potter game did as well, although I haven't been following that I just have too many games to play and I kind of let that one fall apart.
3476000	3480000	But I my assumption is they've probably made a similar change in that game as well.
3480000	3494000	So, meanwhile though Orna the other game, Loki and I always talk about Orna is still keeping their changes intact. And that's like the reduced cooldowns on gauntlet and stuff like that so it's kind of cool.
3494000	3509000	Even still even if it didn't have it intact I mean it's like, you can play that game from home pretty easily which is nice, you can be added some things to like actual like walking around and stuff like that for different quests but like, you can still play that
3509000	3511000	at home for the most part.
3511000	3534000	Now Akdeft is pointing out in chat the changes to the incubators though weren't as bad as we thought. The spawns from incense now are about every one minute and 30 seconds to two minutes in between so it's, it's not quite, and he says incense on incubators, but the changes aren't quite as drastic as we were assuming, but Niantic could have kind of done some damage control earlier on and pointed that out.
3534000	3549000	So there is that whole element to consider. So anyway, there was that whole roundtable we did on this, but I'm curious you guys any further thoughts, so Jamie you're, you're kind of like they shouldn't really be rolling anything back on this it doesn't really make sense.
3549000	3566000	Yeah, you know, because, I mean, even if the numbers are telling them that yeah people are going outside. The fact remains is that people really shouldn't, and by them changing this it's indirectly encouraging more of this dangerous activity.
3566000	3585000	I mean, we, I, America is stupid. Okay, just saying it will very very stupid people, while other countries have been doing things right and have, you know, reduce spread, certainly in the US.
3585000	3605000	It's not a wise idea to do this. And if they're doing these across the board, then with as big of a user base there is here and I'm not saying, Oh, they have to do everything just because the US and so America, whatever, you know, but I'm saying that if they're going to do it across the board they need to take stuff like this into account.
3606000	3620000	And yeah, we haven't exactly been led well through this whole situation and I'll just kind of point at what's going on in the world in the direction of Walter Reed Hospital y'all y'all got y'all got news on various devices.
3620000	3632000	I don't have to say shit. You know it. You know what's going on and so it's you know. Anyway, sorry I won't dive into that too much it's it's hard not to, it's fucking hard not to.
3632000	3651000	It is today is March 234 of 2020 and it is kind of hard not to bring up. This shouldn't be like this. It is so frustrating. We should not be in little boxes on our fucking discord call anymore we should be able to do this show in studio, but we can't.
3651000	3665000	So it's a little bit frustrating. Anyhow, and now it's like, now it just seems like every dumb fuck thing that happens is just this sentence gets gets extended, and it's not even things that we're doing.
3666000	3667000	Argh.
3667000	3688000	Anyway, now, Bobby Blackwell says ironically the CDC says that going outside by yourself is safe, as long as you're not near other people but I mean nobody believes the CDC anymore. Well, do you see how many people I see hanging out at the park or crowding around tables, even with outdoor dining.
3688000	3703000	I do understand, I understand where you're going with this because yes, you can go by yourself outside and walk and that's not an issue, but the problem and I get it, the problem is is that when you start to open the door to well this is okay.
3703000	3716000	Then that leads to well this is okay too, I can meet up with my friends at the park, and we're outside so we can take our masks off and gossip and dah dah dah dah and all this stuff and that's, that's kind of the mindset that tit leads to tap.
3716000	3729000	If that makes well they opened up playgrounds again in California, so that'll be fun. Hmm. Well, it's gonna go out there with Lysol and spray everybody down.
3729000	3737000	Well don't touch the playground that's my point. All right, anyway, let's move on. We got other stuff to get to and I think the next story is from dark soccer.
3737000	3739000	That it is.
3739000	3746000	So, and we've talked about Ubisoft shenanigans before for lack of a better description for it.
3746000	3768000	But they, there is a survey, published by Eve's limo. They're a CEO, who said that the employee survey stated that the company has had about 25% of the employees have experienced or witnessed workplace misconduct.
3768000	3786000	They surveyed about 14,000 people anonymously, and one in four said that they've experienced it or seen it, and that they didn't feel one in five said that they didn't feel fully respected or safe in the work environment.
3786000	3798000	And women and non binary employees were more likely to experience or witness harassment than men.
3798000	3809000	Because, and you know, I'm gonna go on a little, a little tirade thing, maybe in half a moment. I'm sorry I am stuck. Okay, there we go.
3809000	3830000	But, but yeah we do because, you know, we're treated as as second rate citizens because for the most part, you know, if you are not white cisgender male, then you're not the default white cisgender male is default, you know, for, for people so of course,
3830000	3833000	you know this is this is our experience.
3833000	3842000	But also, with that survey, it was also done through a third party which is actually awesome that they didn't do it internally.
3842000	3848000	And that they started this shortly after those initial allegations came out.
3848000	3858000	So, they, of course, you know, and a good number of their executives and leaders have been fired.
3858000	3861000	Quite a few of them actually.
3861000	3864000	And
3864000	3868000	he, going back to the original letter of women.
3868000	3874000	When did that letter to explain how the company is hoping that they can deal with all of this to make the workplace safer.
3874000	3892000	They're implementing new mechanisms to anonymous anonymously report harassment accusations so they can be investigated, and they're updating so revising their company code of contact and doing compulsory anti sexism and anti harassment training across the company.
3892000	3909000	So, you know, one of the other things too is that they're also working on diversifying the company, so that they can move their levels of female employees from 22% to 24% by 2023.
3909000	3917000	It should be higher than that sorry women are 50% of the gamers we should be 50% of the development, just saying.
3917000	3921000	But at any rate, it looks like they are taking it seriously.
3921000	3931000	I'm hoping that this isn't just, you know, what's the word I'm thinking of
3932000	3952000	No action. Exactly. That's what I'm thinking of, but I want to say that with a reaction like this with having called in a research firm, and so many people just being out of, you know, for their, their terrible behavior that I, I'm thinking it's valid,
3952000	3962000	I'm thinking that it's real and it's good to see happening I think that they could still do a lot better than this, but
3962000	3975000	I'm glad to see it happening, you know, I keep thinking back to this one thing that was going around Facebook for a while where this lady had been, you said she doesn't get anything done and has a hard time working.
3975000	3993000	When she and her boss switched computers and he was using her email he saw it happening. And it's absolutely disgusting that the, the things that women experience and I'll go in further and say non binary as well, isn't believed until a man experiences
3993000	4009000	It is disgusting, and that it took so many people to suffer before anything was done about this. It's, it's absolutely disgusting. And so I'm, I'm at least glad to see something's happening lip service was the word I was thinking of, by the way.
4009000	4020000	There you go. You know, yeah, it's nice to see like the tangible action items, it's nice to see that path to, okay, not just we're recognizing the problem but here's how we're going to fix it.
4020000	4030000	It's kind of like when you had a lot of companies responding to the social justice movement that was happening over the summer and continues to happen obviously with Black Lives Matter.
4030000	4046000	And you saw some companies that, you know, had a nice graphic for a day. And you saw some companies that really outlined steps to how they're going to help diversify the industry and I would point act with as much crap as we've given them over the years
4046000	4058000	Niantic had one of the really superior responses in the whole Black Lives Matter issue with, you know, here's how we're going to diversify our industry and where we're putting money and the commitments we're making and so forth.
4058000	4071000	So it's nice to see Ubisoft making like those you know it's it's it's one thing to have a graphic or put out a statement or say so it's another to actually see the steps.
4071000	4088000	But now and as Dark Soccer just pointed out, it's about making sure the steps are followed and not just lip service. But for me, it's really obviously shocking to hear about the 25% number 25% had experienced harassment at Ubisoft was that what the figure was
4088000	4108000	25% something around those lines. So that is way too high, as I'm sure we all recognized it should be zero. So 25 is is way too high. My concern is Ubisoft spin the one in the spotlight for the last few months and rightfully so based on all these things we're hearing.
4109000	4122000	But my concern is what's happening at all the other companies is this third party going to be evaluating other companies within this within the industry as well because they should now I fully realize how these outside surveys work.
4123000	4143000	paid this vendor to come in and do something from a third party perspective. But I feel like a lot of our big companies need to look at running a survey running a study like this and making sure that they have numbers that are close to very close to or at zero when it comes to these types of things.
4143000	4155000	And if not, what are the steps that they're going to take to fix it? Because I kind of think Ubisoft is probably not the only company. It's the only one we know about, but it's probably not the only one that, you know, needs it.
4155000	4179000	You think at this point, like that the ESA would step in and advocate for something, but that would require the ESA to be competent. I'm sorry. I have said this before, and I know I'm being a bitch. But the reality is, they're not. And until they take steps to show that they are, I'm going to keep being bitchy when it comes to the ESA.
4180000	4203000	I more tend to look at what actdeft is saying in chat. And I think one word unionize for fuck sakes. And I think people people kind of think, oh, isn't the ESA their union? Well, clearly not. Clearly not the companies themselves for the executives, maybe. But the what the ESA is as tone deaf as all those executives.
4204000	4223000	So, you know, and we what we had that story, what six weeks ago, about that tweet that ESA put up and it was really tone deaf. And anyway, I don't want to I don't want to retread old territory because it just makes me upset. But I think that the short story is the ESA is still not fixed. So they're not going to fix this problem either. They're useless.
4224000	4236000	So, yes, I and I clearly heard support from dark soccer there, too, that games industry needs some type of union to stick up for the workers because no one else is. And that's that's that.
4237000	4250000	And really in this by unionizing, they're taking steps to protect themselves. They're putting the power in their own hands to do this on behalf of everyone who's added their voice to it.
4250000	4265000	Yeah. Bobby Black Wolf saying the ESA is not a union. It's a lobbying group for the companies. Yep. Phoenix 7726 says the ESA is a consumer right rights org in the same way the NRA is. They're both corporate shills masking is giving a fuck.
4266000	4278000	Bobby Black Wolf clarifies the ECA is the consumer rights group. Is that still I thought they had their own set of issues a few years back. Are they still around? I could be wrong. I just haven't heard much out of them in a while.
4279000	4297000	Black Compat in chat says I have nothing nice to say about the ESA co-signed my friend. All right. Anyhow, so let's hope other companies take Ubisoft's lead in this regard and have a third party evaluation done. I think that would be very meaningful.
4298000	4304000	And in the meantime, I hope our game workers out there able to unionize in the future. So. All right.
4304000	4321000	I just will think that I've been very, very blessed with the company that I work for that they've always been on top of it. And it this way with how easy that they make it where I work that other companies aren't doing the same thing. You know, it's just really irritating.
4322000	4335000	Yeah. And yeah, I think my company is great, too. But I also don't work in the games industry. So it's very different. So. All right. Moving on. Let's get to another story. Loki.
4336000	4349000	Yes. So let's talk about other terrible things in Fallout 76. So Fallout 76 has. Had a lot of problems, one of those being their extreme monetization of the game itself.
4350000	4360000	They treat it like a free to play game, but it is not a free to play game, but they surely want to monetize it. So the brand new thing that you can now buy is basically your own vault.
4361000	4380000	So they offer it in three different sizes. So this will be like an instance lobby that you can actually decorate and do stuff in. So the utility room, which is something that apparently you can get by doing some questing in the game, the lobby and then the atrium, which is like a vault size thing.
4380000	4398000	So the vault lobby is apparently going to be one of the free monthly items for Fallout first members. And of course, that, if you don't remember, is their $13 a month subscription or $100 a year because, you know, this trash game needs a $100 a year subscription.
4399000	4411000	Um, or of course you can purchase all this stuff separately in the Adam's shop. Of course, they haven't said how much it's going to cost, but considering that a skin, a blue skin for your power armor is $20.
4412000	4425000	I mean, you can imagine what this might cost. It's going to be ridiculous. Um, need, I guess, if you're enjoying this game, but I just, I can't at this point, at least it'll be coming to game pass someday. But.
4426000	4435000	Isn't it on game pass now or am I, Oh no, I thought it was already on game pass. This was outside the Bethesda thing from last week.
4436000	4443000	They were literally, you know, handing, giving it away for free at one point, um, with the purchase of game systems.
4444000	4446000	Multiple people confirming it is on game pass.
4447000	4452000	Okay. Well still not worth a hundred dollars a month or a hundred dollars a year. So I don't know.
4452000	4462000	Um, but several, several people in chat referencing PlayStation home, uh, as Joe and her mat says PlayStation vault home, uh, as Joe and her mat says PlayStation home was ahead of its time.
4463000	4474000	You know, I kind of agree. I don't know if I would say ahead of its time, but PlayStation home is one of those things I oddly miss with as much shit as we gave it back in the day.
4474000	4477000	Isn't, and this is not how it always goes. You give something shit, but I think it was.
4478000	4482000	And so that you don't also accuse us of, well, maybe you shouldn't have given it shit then maybe we'd still be here.
4483000	4488000	I think there was potential in PlayStation home that was never quite fully realized.
4489000	4491000	And I remember when it got more towards the end, you started to see more of that.
4492000	4497000	And I remember we had a listener that was like super into PlayStation home and built these elaborate spaces and it was really cool.
4498000	4501000	And then we did something to piss him off and he hasn't been around since, but, um.
4501000	4507000	So a little bit later, we will get to something that, um, does touch on that.
4508000	4511000	Oh, really? Okay. Then I'll shut up. Then we'll come back later. Okay.
4512000	4520000	Uh, let's see. Uh, bonds, double six says I miss PlayStation home, had a cliffside Villa, really swanky view to the ocean, saw the waves and hear crashes against the rocks.
4521000	4525000	As Joe and her mat says, I miss it. PlayStation home would have been great for this pandemic.
4525000	4532000	Uh, and Bobby Black Wolf says, uh, on a Bethesda and Microsoft related note, Doom Eternal did come to console game pass.
4533000	4538000	That's the new one from this week. So, all right, uh, let's move on. We've got some more stories.
4539000	4546000	I will do this next one that is about speaking of Sony, let's talk about Peter Parker getting changed in Marvel's Spider-Man.
4547000	4551000	So Marvel's Spider-Man is going to be getting its remastered edition, of course, on PlayStation five.
4551000	4555000	And what's interesting about it is that they're going to be changing Peter Parker's look for this.
4556000	4560000	Uh, and this is a big thing that's been all over the internet because Peter Parker basically got a new face.
4561000	4567000	Uh, there's a new model for it. And many people commenting, gosh, the new face model looks a lot like Tom Holland.
4568000	4574000	It's not Tom Holland, but it's like, you know, the Tom Holland you ordered on Wish. Okay. That's who they got to do the PlayStation.
4575000	4580000	Yeah. Hamtolland is the new face. No, I don't know who this guy is. I'm sure he's.
4581000	4582000	The face model looks good.
4583000	4587000	Yeah. Uh, Ben Jordan is actually the name of the actor. No, and I think he, he does look good.
4588000	4591000	I'm just, I'm being very tongue in cheek when I say he's a, he's a fine looking lad.
4592000	4597000	I have nothing, nothing at all wrong with his looks, but it is a lot more in the realm of Tom Holland.
4597000	4612000	Don't you think? A little bit. Anyway. Um, so anyway, they, um, talked about, oh, we loved working with John Bubenack, who I guess was the original on the original game, but now we've cast Ben Jordan to be the face model on the PlayStation five.
4613000	4626000	They didn't really say much more about this. They just said, as we discussed the franchise's future and moving to the PlayStation five, it quickly became apparent that an even more believable looking character made finding a better facial match, uh, for, uh,
4627000	4639000	for Yuri Lowenthal, who we all love as Peter, a necessity. So interesting. I guess that is the voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal. So, um, yeah, there you go.
4640000	4649000	A new actor, uh, coming into Spider-Man and there's a whole YouTube that shows the new look and all that good stuff. Um, I mean, actors get recast.
4649000	4666000	Obviously Tom Holland is the third actor to play Spider-Man in modern times. And that's not even, you know, counting going way back, but in modern time, shall we say after, um, Tobey Maguire and, uh, Andrew Garfield is the, so it's, it's not common.
4666000	4678000	The rumors was going to say to get in the rumors. We may actually see them again as Spider-Man considering that the next movie is rumored to be us surrounding the multiverse considering an electro is supposed to come back.
4679000	4691000	Yeah. So that'll be interesting. Yeah, that is interesting. So, um, let's see other comments in chat. Miltonius game says this is probably something they were looking to do for a sequel anyway.
4691000	4701000	Hmm. Bobby Black Wolf says they were all supposed to be in the animated Spider-Man. Well, there's still opportunity for the second one. Yeah. Right around the corner. Anyway, it's an interesting change.
4702000	4715000	Um, so yeah, we'll see, uh, we'll see how this game sells. I know a lot of people are going to be looking forward to the, um, uh, sorry that Mr. Smoosh is throwing a fit in the other room. What is he doing?
4715000	4727000	You find a toy or something? Anyway, I know a lot of people are going to be looking forward to the Miles Morales version on PlayStation five, uh, and PlayStation four as the case may be. So, um, this holiday season.
4728000	4738000	All right. Well, let's travel back to a classic time. Let's go back to a time when you didn't recast actors because you got one chance. You got it. And it was on the cartridge.
4738000	4759000	Actors? What's that? Exactly. Or in this case on the disc. And once it was there, it was stuck there. Uh, it's the classic game of the week. Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she, uh, thinks, Hey, you brats should be checking this game out. Enough of your modern newfangled stuff. Uh, check out this classic. It's over 10 years old. How dare you?
4760000	4784000	Dark soccer. What is the classic game of the week? I picked a resident evil guns, uh, gun survivor too. And I'm saying gun survivor, biohazard gun survivor, uh, instead of what we, what we got in the U S and I'm very specific on that one because, um, honestly, I really, really, really enjoyed the, the arcade version very, very much.
4785000	4807000	Um, so what this game is, is a light gun shooter that was developed by Capcom in the resident evil series. Um, it was actually developed in conjunction with Namco for arcade. It ran on the Sega Naomi, uh, Ford, um, and it did get a PS two, uh, release, um, in 2001 in Japan and in Europe in 2002.
4807000	4818000	Um, and it is the second in the gun survivor series. Um, and as a re it's a sequel to biohazard gun survivor, and this one is adapted from resident evil code Veronica.
4819000	4834000	Um, and so, uh, and actually some of the enemies in the game, uh, came from resident evil three as well. Um, so basically you play as Claire looking for her brother after, you know, the garbage in raccoon city.
4834000	4849000	And so you have two modes that you play in this one, you can either control Claire or you can control Steve. I mean, Leonardo DiCaprio, I mean, Steve. So, um, you have the light gun support, um, on the, uh, the PlayStation two version.
4849000	4861000	You can actually use the gun con two from, uh, Namco, or you can also use a dual shot controller to play. Um, so basically you, you have several stages as you go through there.
4861000	4874000	Um, you, uh, you know, you can move the gun around, you can shoot stuff, but for me, the arcade version really is the big thing. Like, that's actually the big thing for me on this one.
4874000	4885000	Because as you're going through it and it's it. When I first saw it, it seemed a little, I don't know, kind of counterproductive if that makes sense.
4885000	4905000	Um, where you're actually using the gun to do the, the, the controlling. So you are pushing that gun to move forward. You're, I gosh, I wish that people on the podcast could see this, but like you have the gun as you're going and you'll move forward to move it.
4906000	4923000	And, you know, you can sort of strafe with it. And I thought that that controller system was just so much fun. Um, you had that and it was, you know, a big assault rifle, the one that I played. Um, and you know, but as you go through, um, you do have, uh, different modes.
4924000	4943000	Um, you, uh, you know, so like, for example, if you play as Claire, then you stay, save Steve and vice versa. Um, you also have a timer that times out. Um, and so if your time runs out and the nemesis is going to start chasing you and kill you if you don't get to an exit.
4943000	4952000	So I guess that's the, the tie in there. But, um, you know, again, you have to defeat, uh, bosses.
4952000	4964000	You have to defeat zombies. You get a better score as you go along. Um, and you get, uh, a multi, a combo multiplier for how quickly and how smoothly you defeat, you know, the enemies.
4964000	4975000	Um, but it was first announced as biohazard fire zone, um, in February, 2001, because, you know, Capron said they were going to be working with Namco, uh, to make the other game.
4975000	4988000	Um, and then they, they did it. It was out on the Naomi systems and it was going to, uh, uh, they were going to merge it with resident evil code Veronica.
4988000	5007000	Um, you know, basically since now me and Dreamcast were designed the same hardware. Um, but they had footage available for ALU expo in February, 2001 that had no voice acting any of the cut scenes, just subtitles for conversations.
5007000	5016000	Um, and so, you know, when we finally got it, we actually never got the arcade version in the U S I played it in Las Vegas.
5016000	5032000	Um, so, Oh, thank you. She make plastic. Thank you for the, the biddies. So, um, but anyway, um, uh, we did get the only U S release it got was on PS two, um, as gun survivor.
5032000	5049000	Well, the Japanese one was gun survivor to biohazard code Veronica in the U S of course we got it as resident evil survivor code Veronica. Cause he don't want to use gun in the name me, even though he had plenty of other games that had gun in, in the name.
5049000	5061000	So, but anyway, um, how's this, I, sorry, just quickly houses. Cause I got confused by this at first too. How is this different from the other code Veronica game? Cause there's another game that's called code Veronica.
5061000	5076000	Well, because it's not, this is a gun game. This is built on code Veronica as a straight up gun game. Now, Dan and I had this conversation going and this was back late, you know, we had this conversation going and this was back late.
5076000	5092000	You know, when the dream cast first came out, cause you know, um, on the gun for the dream cast, you have a D pad, right? Right. We always thought that this game should have come out on the dream cast where you use, you know, like if you're, if you're holding the gun, then you use the D pad.
5092000	5101000	Um, you know, with what would have been like your, not your trigger, but to, to pull the, uh, to cock the gun.
5101000	5104000	Oh, come on. You still would have played it with a fishing rod.
5104000	5115000	I would have tried. I mean, of course I would have tried, but that you would basically use, you know, the D pad and then shoot. I got, I wish y'all could see what I had on the screen.
5115000	5127000	Like, like this, you know, so you're pulling trigger and you're moving with the D pad that way. And I think that that would have been, um, been pretty fun. It was actually a shame that it didn't come out on, on dream cast.
5127000	5141000	Um, but at the same time, um, it sucked that we didn't get the arcade version either. It was a lot of fun to play. I think that when we went to that arcade, you know, after I got my Bimani in, I spent a lot of time playing this game.
5141000	5158000	I thought it was so much fun. Um, damn shame it never came up. It's such a, such a unique take on the shooting genre with having your gun be your controller and moving around and actually exploring instead of just having, you know, the, a real experience.
5158000	5170000	All right. So, yeah. So yeah, that's, that's, uh, my game of the week is, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
5171000	5180000	Uh, gun survivor to biohazard code Veronica. Okay. That's bio biohazard gun survivor to code Veronica, except I think I got some of those words.
5180000	5194000	Survivor to biohazard code Veronica. Good. And it's still not the longest of games that I own. Cause I mean, I've got like all the super street fighter to turbo for matching service, ex plus, you know?
5195000	5208000	So I Capcom likes those titles. All right. Well, good, good pick. Cause I, I honestly, that was when I was not super familiar with, but it makes sense why, uh, it was a little bit more of a niche arcade game, especially here in the States.
5208000	5217000	So, and for anyone who asks why I haven't done a, um, a pinball yet for this month, wait. Okay.
5218000	5231000	I'm doing something appropriate and that's all I'm going to say currently on hold. All right. Uh, let's move on. We got more show to come here. Let's get into some, and this, this show has got to be good enough to last for two weeks, uh, with no show next week.
5231000	5239000	So, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and Loki is going to start us off with quickly some other stuff going around in the gaming universe.
5240000	5256000	Yep. So here's, it's a new month. So new free games, uh, with your subscriptions, of course. So the X-Box games with gold, uh, for, uh, the month of October, we're getting sleigh away camp, butchers cut and made of skirt.
5257000	5266000	And then of course on the X-Box three 60 side, we have Sphinx and the curse mummy and costume quests. So pretty cool.
5267000	5268000	Are they scared?
5269000	5278000	You know, it's funny. It's like, has it looks like it's a horror game. So made, made of skirt is kind of funny as like a name, but, um, I don't know.
5279000	5294000	I kind of feel like we're getting cheaper games this month, but that's okay. They're, they're thematic with, you know, spoopy season and, and I would expect maybe they're holding onto some big ones for the release of X-Box series X, you know, like these games are even better on series X.
5294000	5296000	Like they're going to have some big ones in November. We'll see.
5297000	5300000	And also the, you have to think that they've given out as so many games so far.
5301000	5305000	I'm not complaining. I promise. This just, this just isn't an, Oh my God kind of month.
5306000	5317000	This is true. Yeah. So, um, and then of course, uh, jump rose, uh, challenge, which was supposed to be leaving the eShop is actually not going to be leaving the eShop now.
5317000	5328000	Um, so originally it was supposed to be removed on September 30th, but now because of, I guess the interest in it, they are no longer going to be removing it at this time.
5329000	5344000	So interesting precedent though, being set with them, not getting rid of jump rope challenge, which was supposed to be a limited time thing. Um, could that be a fake out when it comes to these other things like 3d all stars and super Mario 35?
5345000	5354000	Maybe under promise over delivers what they're trying to do. I don't know. Maybe so they can, they can get their scarcity, uh, sales and eat it too. I guess.
5355000	5356000	I guess. Yeah.
5357000	5365000	We'll see. I don't, don't set the expectation level there, but I worry that might be what they did by keeping the jump rope challenge up. We'll see. I don't know.
5365000	5375000	So, uh, Bobby Blackwell saying that, well, Mario 35 needs online servers though, and that's going to get shut down on March, March 31st. Jump rope challenge needs no online servers.
5376000	5386000	Well, what if they don't shut down those online servers? I mean, that's still an option. They could just not shut it down now. Anyway, they could wait a little while, but we'll see.
5386000	5399000	I mean, I also understand that super Mario 35 is it's different. It kind of fits in a different place than Tetris 99. So we'll see. Anyway, uh, since it is spooky season, we are revisiting lots of spooky games.
5400000	5410000	And one spooky game you can revisit now is silent Hill for the room. Um, this is now available through good old games on PC for nine 99.
5410000	5419000	This is interesting because we were asked, I remember if it was last week or the week before, but I remember we got a question towards the end of the show, like what would make you like look at GOG?
5420000	5433000	And I was kind of like, well, when they actually go back to being old games and we've kind of seen that a little bit, at least with Konami in the past couple of weeks, because we had the whole, uh, metal gear, MSX version is now available and now this.
5433000	5445000	Um, so that's kind of neat. Uh, so anyway, silent Hill for the room of course was originally released in 2004. It did come out for the PC then, but most of you probably played it on PlayStation two or the original Xbox.
5446000	5453000	I believe that game would, did not start as a silent Hill game. It started as something else and then kind of just became a silent Hill game somewhere along the way.
5453000	5463000	I will always find, I will always fondly remember this from our very first E3 and perhaps dark soccer and look, you remember this too, because this was the big game at Konami's booth.
5464000	5472000	Which, you know, back in 2004, we were still all about DDR beat mania and all that stuff. And they had a huge elaborate setup for silent Hill for the room at E3 that year. I remember that.
5473000	5477000	So I have so many pictures from that and you know me, I was practically living there. I was so happy.
5478000	5485000	Wasn't that like the first place you came into contact with Igarashi and just like bumped into him? Like, is that the one that you just always would bump into him? Like literally?
5486000	5489000	No, no, no. Igarashi was not the one I would bump into. I bumped into Kojima.
5490000	5492000	That's it, Kojima. Okay. I knew it was somebody Konami related.
5493000	5496000	Yeah, but I did meet, that is where I met Igarashi.
5497000	5498000	Got it.
5498000	5504000	And then, you know, just chatted with him for a little bit. He's a pretty cool dude. We know with his hat.
5505000	5513000	And then also, gosh, that was also when we met Yamaoka.
5514000	5519000	I remember that too. I remember I have a picture with him somewhere, but I think it's like an actual picture.
5520000	5521000	Yeah.
5522000	5524000	We hadn't quite all gone to phones yet. All right.
5524000	5534000	Anyhow, other rapid-fire news here. Microsoft Flight Simulator, which, you know, that's a pretty awesome, it's weird to call it a game, but an awesome experience, we'll say.
5535000	5540000	I've tried it a couple times. I'm really bad at it. I have to have a lot of assists on, but it's really pretty.
5541000	5545000	And it's going to be interesting to see what happens when it goes to VR, because that is something that's coming.
5545000	5554000	You will initially need to do this beta, a Windows Mixed Reality headset, something like HP's Reverb G2.
5555000	5563000	And you'll also need to have a system that meets the minimum specs and a Flight Simulator Insider membership, and that is all with the early beta.
5564000	5573000	There will be a second phase that will include additional devices. Don't know which devices those are, but that is going to be in late October or early November.
5573000	5583000	So VR is making its way to Flight Simulator, and that's certainly a game I would want to try it with, because Flight Simulator is just gorgeous.
5584000	5590000	I can see where it's very much a zen thing. I was watching a guy that did a livestream, and he liked to do a whole roleplay thing.
5590000	5597000	He would actually pretend he was flying the plane from this little island here to another place.
5598000	5604000	And he would say, okay, we're going to take the bridge to the gate, or we're going to undock the thing, and we're going to say something to the passengers.
5605000	5610000	And he'll actually go, good morning, and welcome to such-and-such Airlines flight 103, nonstop service.
5611000	5617000	He's actually roleplayed the whole thing. I thought it was really cool. So yeah, Flight Sim's a fun game. So VR, that'll be neat.
5617000	5620000	Dark Soccer, how about you, Rapid Fire?
5621000	5630000	I've got some stuff. So basically, Hamster has announced a dozen of the arcade archives games for Switch.
5630000	5658000	They actually did streams during Tokyo Game Show 2020, and so a good number that were announced were Versus Tennis, Thunder Dragon, Swimmer, Soccer, Rodland, Rabio Lepus, Pet on Pew, Nova 2001, Liquid Kids, Kurikintan, Guzzler, Green Beret, which we got as Russian Attack, Gradius 3, The Fairyland Story, Cosmo Police,

5667000	5677000	In other news as well, Steam is doing a digital tabletop festival kicking off this month.
5677000	5688000	And so it's a joint project between Valve and ARAQ Digital so that you can, I mean, play some fun stuff.
5689000	5702000	But there's the panel that's going on about it. They are talking about different games, including Mars Horizon, talking about the Cthulhu Mythos, but this begins on October 21st at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern.
5702000	5709000	It'll run until October 26th. So live broadcast panels, lots of feature games being shown, so that'll be rad.
5710000	5718000	All right. Sounds like fun. All right. Well, since that's it for rapid fire news, let's travel around the world and check out some releases. What's coming out?
5719000	5721000	I propose we do two weeks worth of announcements.
5722000	5727000	Oh, good call. So over the next two weeks, what's coming out in the world? Loki, we'll start with you.
5727000	5734000	All right. So let's talk a little bit about a game called I Am Dead. So I Am Dead is coming out on.

5834000	5835000	It's in two weeks.
5836000	5837000	Enjoy your green Mario.
5837000	5840000	Alright, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases there for two weeks.

5889000	5892000	FIFA 21 also comes out for the PlayStation 4 in Japan on October 9th.
5893000	5897000	And looking ahead to the week after, I don't think there's a lot of releases.
5898000	5905000	Greed Fall comes out in Japan as well as that same Yomi wo Sakuhana also comes out in Japan next week while we're gone.
5906000	5908000	So that's it for Japan. How about the UK Dark Sakura?

5989000	5996000	Alright, so a double segment of World Release States to hold you over for a couple weeks, lots of stuff coming out, a lot of stuff.
5997000	6001000	I bet there will be a lot of people picking up that Mario Kart Live, that looks like a lot of fun.
6002000	6004000	Probably not me, but I can't wait to see the YouTubes and people playing them.
6005000	6007000	I've got mine pre-ordered already.
6008000	6010000	I'm excited, did you get green Mario? Or did you get Mario?
6011000	6012000	I got red Mario, red Luigi.
6012000	6022000	Alright. Let's try to cover some other news going on and then of course we have a couple emails I believe later on in the show and your questions as well.
6023000	6024000	We just got them.
6025000	6027000	Just for the show. Last minute chances.
6028000	6032000	Anyway, we still got a few stories before we get to that, so let's get to our next story. Loki.
6033000	6038000	So as I was alluding to earlier, this pretty awesome fan project.
6039000	6050000	So there's a service called PS1, PlayStation Online Emulated, and the team has gotten the Warhawk servers back up and running.
6051000	6058000	So you can actually now play Warhawk on the PlayStation 3 online as if it was running on the official PlayStation servers.
6059000	6064000	Now the other thing they've also gotten working as well is the Twisted Metal Black Online servers.
6065000	6074000	Now what they're working on right now, what's going to be coming out later, SOCOM Confrontation, Wipeout, and PlayStation Home.
6075000	6079000	Oh, okay. There's where that's coming back.
6079000	6094000	Yes. Very interesting. But if you're looking to see how to actually do it, it involves basically just changing the DNS server information on your console, which is pretty simple to redirect to theirs.
6095000	6096000	And then it just functions.
6097000	6098000	Interesting.
6099000	6105000	Yeah. PS, it's PSONE.online and go check it out.
6105000	6116000	Okay. All right. I'm curious to see what people end up building in PlayStation Home in these days. Can they update their own stuff or no? It's really just the server stuff.
6117000	6118000	I don't know how that's going to work.
6119000	6120000	All right. We'll see.
6121000	6122000	It'll be interesting to see how that functions.
6122000	6129000	Sure. All right. Let's move on and talk about some Twitch license music for your streams.
6130000	6134000	So Twitch has increased some of the legal music, if you will, that you can play on your streams.
6135000	6148000	I don't know if you guys remember, but a couple months ago, some of the record companies really started doing like a mass takedown, cease and desist type of thing on people that were playing games over just their Spotify, random music, and then clips would get saved and all this stuff.
6148000	6153000	You know, basically the record companies found out what people are playing music and this is a thing we can make money off of.
6154000	6155000	Yeah. So they kind of start to shut all that down.
6156000	6163000	But now some, you know, record labels are finding that this is a pretty good way to get the news out about your different music.
6164000	6173000	So soundtrack by Twitch is something that is in beta, but there are over a million licensed tracks for use in streams.
6173000	6184000	But what's interesting is that some of it, so there's a lot of, there's a lot of, you know, the types of stuff you would expect to be in public domain, like a lot of, you know, simple loop type of things.
6185000	6198000	But there are some, you know, mid-sized labels, I guess, that are coming up, indie labels, including things like Monstercat, SoundCloud, Empire, and one that caught my attention and was also pointed out on Discord when this was posted.
6198000	6206000	Anjunabeats, I don't know if I say that right, sorry, I've always only read it. So Anjunabeats, which is above and beyond label.
6207000	6220000	So it's kind of neat that they have that as well. So we don't know exactly everything that's going to be there yet, but I think you can go in the beta and kind of look at some of it and there's a pretty good diversity of stuff in there.
6220000	6229000	So it's nice to see that that is available as a way to have music in your streams and for people that want to listen to music while they play games and not worry about a cease and desist.
6230000	6239000	You just are not going to be able to play things like, you know, Britney and Madonna and things like that because that is still music that the labels are not wanting you to play.
6240000	6250000	So, you know, it's not listed there. There's an artist I like listening to all the time. Of course, now I can't remember their names, but they did actually.
6251000	6260000	I had it on my last stream they did with the Lego building stuff. They had put out a video talking about all of the all their music is now stream safe as well.
6260000	6269000	Gunship was the artist that did that. So it's like a lot of the retro wave stuff. Nice. You're interested in that person as synthwave and that type of stuff.
6270000	6277000	The only stuff you need to be very careful of are the games that have soundtracks in them. A lot of like racing games and sports games.
6278000	6287000	That's why back in the day when I was streaming things like Forza 3 and Forza 4, I would always be on the classic music channel because I wouldn't want to get my and plus it's fun to race to classic music.
6287000	6299000	But yeah, you wouldn't want to get your stream shut down because you just accidentally played music. That's also why, yes, you do see DDR streams and beatmania streams, but not always something you can watch on demand.
6300000	6309000	Yeah, there's only certain songs you can play on those. Like I found that they like to monetize synchronized love. So you can play that. Be careful.
6309000	6313000	All right. A few more stories for you guys. Dark Sakura.
6314000	6324000	So. Oh, I do, don't I? I thought that I had. That's right. We're doing email later. I was in email mode. Sorry.
6325000	6334000	So there were two members of a console hacking and piracy organization that were arrested and charged with fraud. They're called Team Executor.
6334000	6347000	X-E-C-U-T-E-R. And one of them is named Gary Bowser. And also the other one is Max Lowarn. They were arrested in the Dominican Republic.
6348000	6363000	And they made a line of tools for cracking lockdown gaming hardware. They were bested for their Nintendo hacks, including a USB item called the SX Pro that allows the Nintendo Switch to run pirated games.
6364000	6380000	They are for profit. They were working in the emulation communities. Now, while emulation communities are open source and don't want to sell anything, they're like, oh, yeah, fuck it. We're making some money on this shit.
6380000	6396000	And so they have been arrested, their charges filed, and they face prison time if convicted, including 20 years for each charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, actual wire fraud.
6397000	6405000	Conspiracy to commit money laundering with up to five years for some of the lesser charges. There's no trial date yet.
6406000	6410000	But of course, the story is everywhere because the guy is named Bowser.
6411000	6427000	Yeah, just like I'm just familiar with them. I've been a purveyor of Team Executor products in the past with the Xbox 360. They used to have well, actually, no, I don't know if I've gotten their kit for the 360. I know on the Wii, I had a mod chip by them.
6427000	6440000	Maybe on the 360, too. I can't remember. But yeah, so. But I think back then they were selling mainly just like tools and hardware to do like the hacks yourself and then everything else you kind of do.
6441000	6456000	But now these newer systems are charging for like firmwares and stuff. So it's a little bit different rather than you might be able to say, oh, well, it's you know, you don't have to necessarily use this for piracy.
6457000	6469000	Granted, it wouldn't it doesn't stop you from using it for piracy. But there's been like other methods to crack the switch that have blocked piracy. But these obviously were different.
6470000	6473000	Yeah. All right. There you go.
6474000	6479000	OK, let's move on. Just a couple more stories, then we'll get to those emails. Loki.
6480000	6493000	Yes. So, man, it seems like it's been so long since we've talked about Farmville, but I guess it has been a while since the game did launch almost 11 years ago.
6494000	6509000	And now we don't really talk about it as often, but it is going to be closing soon. So Facebook apparently or they're going to be closing the servers for good on December 31st, 2020.
6510000	6519000	So interesting that it's been this long since Zynga has been running this game, but I guess it's just not what it used to be anymore.
6520000	6532000	Yeah. And don't worry, for those of you that missed the soundtrack, my ex has it burned to a CD somewhere. So that's how I know this game is old. I've been with Alan for 10 years, but my ex was the one that played this back when it was like big.
6533000	6535000	So that would've been like 12 years ago. So.
6536000	6540000	But just because we're talking about Farmville here.
6541000	6543000	You can't forget Farmville 2.
6544000	6551000	They're going to be releasing Farmville 3 soon. So that's why Farmville 1 is going away, because they want you to play Farmville 3 deep.
6554000	6555000	So it's just.
6557000	6558000	Yeah.
6559000	6568000	All right. So confession time. Who played Farmville? I played a little bit of it just because my ex kind of got me hooked on it.
6569000	6572000	I would say I played a little bit. Your mom played Farmville?
6573000	6574000	Yeah. Oh, wow.
6575000	6576000	A lot of it.
6577000	6586000	Orange in chat reminds us very first thing I had to do when I got my Facebook account is that I had to block Farmville requests. Remember the day of game requests on Facebook when that. Oh, my God.
6587000	6588000	Oh, yeah. I remember blocking all this.
6589000	6591000	I'm still blocking those meme sites.
6592000	6601000	I'm Facebook free for three months now. But I remember Google Plus. That was a big thing when it debuted was that it was putting all the game requests in a separate feed.
6601000	6607000	Again, Google had everything in position, ready to take on the world. And then they just shat the bed. It was unfortunate.
6608000	6613000	I don't tend to use Facebook too much nowadays, aside from there's a few like special interest groups that I'm.
6614000	6622000	I can't even I can't even imagine with what's going on in the world, what Facebook is like right now. No, ma'am.
6623000	6626000	But I miss I miss my survivor fate games that were on Facebook.
6626000	6634000	I think I'm thinking like I'm just in a bunch of groups like there's Shawn agains, which is the local like DDR kind of scene over here.
6635000	6642000	There's the DDR Bimani machine owners saying there's a candy cab stuff.
6643000	6653000	You know, I have a local like town thing talking about stuff going on around here. That's about it. I don't actually look at anything else because it's just it's it's a mess.
6653000	6664000	All right. Well, let's move on and talk about one more story, which is about the Commodore 64, an amazing thing that's near and dear to my heart.
6665000	6672000	Well, it's a it's a game that's been kind of rereleased and ported several times now getting a Commodore 64 port. It's another world.
6672000	6680000	You know, you know that game, right? It kind of was the one that. Yeah. It has like kind of like like shadowy. But it was very lifelike when it kind of came out.
6681000	6694000	Comic book kind of outlook. So it was what they call that. It's rotoscoped. Yeah. Yeah. And it was originally on the Amiga, which was in some ways the successor to the Commodore 64.
6694000	6706000	I know some of you out there. What about the Commodore 128? OK, but the Commodore 128 was like a 64 plus. Right. So the Amiga in many ways was the successor of the C64.
6707000	6718000	So it's not like a huge leap of faith to see that this is something that has been demade for the Commodore 64. It's been scaled down to fit the eight bit processor that the Commodore 64 provides.
6718000	6735000	And you can see there's a nice little YouTube out there if you want to see some of this and so forth. And what is also notable about this is that the unofficial port caught the attention of the creator of another world, Eric Chahi, who then went to Twitter to say, hey, this is pretty impressive.
6736000	6743000	So instead of legal cease and desist, shut it down, it's kind of nice to see the creator going, oh, you did a good job.
6744000	6763000	So anyway, if you want to check out another world, you could get you could get the legal versions on PC, Amiga, Atari ST, Sega Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, Panasonic 3DO, Jaguar, Sega Mega CD, iOS, PS3, PS4, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Mac, PlayStation Vita, Windows Mobile, Apple IGS and Symbian compatible devices.
6764000	6769000	Like we said, this game was everywhere else anyway. So pretty cool.
6770000	6776000	That's pretty insane. I mean, that's almost like that where they're porting Dragon's Lair to the Commodore 64.
6777000	6784000	Well, OK, so if you're going to bring that up and let's transition into the listener roundtable here, we'll get to the mailbag in a moment.
6784000	6790000	But since you're going to bring up Commodore 64 and Dragon's Lair, there was a Dragon's Lair game on Commodore 64.
6791000	6795000	There was the first part was Dragon's Lair and the second part was Escape from Singe's Castle.
6796000	6803000	And I remember these games because I owned them and they were the music in them is some of my favorite Commodore 64 music they ever made.
6804000	6811000	Like the level, there's a level in the game with these balls that roll back and forth. I wish I could find it for you guys.
6811000	6812000	I know what you mean.
6813000	6819000	But oh, man, if I could find it somewhere, I think the ball level was in Escape from Singe's Castle, but it's some of the best Commodore 64 music out there.
6820000	6826000	But it is not like the arcade version. It did not play like that. It was very, very hard.
6827000	6832000	It was more of a platforming game with scenes inspired by those scenes on the laser disk game.
6833000	6835000	But it was not a direct translation of the laser disk game.
6835000	6840000	The thing the project you are referring to is probably a direct translation of the laser disk game.
6841000	6842000	Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of.
6843000	6849000	But I'll have to link it on Twitter later or something, just because I love that music.
6850000	6853000	Like the Dragon's Lair has some of the best music I ever heard on Commodore 64.
6854000	6856000	OK, we'll get to the email bag, but we already have roundtable questions coming in and chat.
6857000	6858000	So let me get this first one.
6858000	6862000	No One Special 77 says, roundtable question.
6863000	6869000	I'm reasonably sure that we've all bought a game or two from the used bin at some store at some point over the years.
6870000	6875000	If only because we wanted a new game to play and we might not have had the money for a new release.
6876000	6877000	So I ask this.
6878000	6882000	Has there been a used game that you bought that you ended up regretting and why?
6883000	6885000	Oh, yes, I already know my answer, but I'll check in with my co-host.
6885000	6888000	Was there a used game you ever bought that you ended up regretting?
6889000	6893000	Usually when I'm buying used games, I'm buying very old used games.
6894000	6895000	So no.
6897000	6900000	Like my old imports are used games.
6901000	6907000	I have bought them at video game stores and public stores and different things.
6908000	6910000	So no.
6910000	6915000	No, I would say Fusion Frenzy 2 on the Xbox 360.
6916000	6917000	That was a piece of garbage.
6918000	6920000	And I regret that purchase with every fiber of my being.
6921000	6923000	I regret renting WCW Thunder.
6924000	6925000	That was so bad we gave it back.
6926000	6927000	There you go.
6928000	6929000	Logie?
6930000	6933000	I don't have any that I remember off the top of my head that I regret purchasing.
6934000	6939000	I just don't think I would buy something unless it was something that I would want.
6940000	6941000	I don't know.
6942000	6943000	I may guess the closest thing.
6944000	6946000	I mean, that was a new that was a new game, though.
6947000	6949000	I was just there was some which game that was on the.
6950000	6952000	I think it was Bullet Witch.
6953000	6955000	Yeah, it's Bullet Witch, but on Xbox 360.
6956000	6957000	But that was new.
6958000	6959000	Unfortunately, that was OK.
6960000	6965000	That wasn't it was like kind of I remember what I think it's supposed to be sort of like.
6966000	6968000	It was like Bayonetta, but it was terrible.
6968000	6969000	All right.
6970000	6971000	There you go. There's some answers.
6972000	6973000	All right. Let's take a peek in our mailbag.
6974000	6975000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
6976000	6982000	If you want to send us an email here on the show, Dark Soccer is going to check out the mailbag and find some emails to read here on air.
6983000	6984000	It's sticky.
6985000	6987000	Is it a sticky piston?
6988000	6992000	No, I just always think of Eddie as going, oh, it's so sticky.
6993000	6994000	Anyway.
6995000	6996000	Good evening, all our crew.
6996000	7003000	Is it weird to anyone else that we have Doug Bowser and Phil Spencer leading their respective gaming divisions of Nintendo and Microsoft?
7004000	7006000	But Sony's public figurehead remains a mystery.
7007000	7011000	We haven't really been able to put a face on the PlayStation branch for a couple of years now.
7012000	7015000	There's nothing wrong with that, but it's just odd.
7016000	7017000	Thanks for reading Garth.
7018000	7024000	P.S. Rob, since you mentioned getting emails about it in a whisper near automata.
7024000	7025000	But yes.
7026000	7030000	It's not too late to bring back Kevin Butler. I'm just saying.
7031000	7032000	It's not.
7033000	7034000	Honestly, it would be fantastic.
7035000	7036000	I want Hirai.
7037000	7048000	There are some faces you see repeatedly on the PlayStation streams that when they announce, you know, but you're right.
7048000	7054000	There's nobody that is quite as recognizable as the other two, and there's certainly nobody like Reggie Fils-Aime.
7055000	7056000	I mean, if you think about it.
7057000	7061000	Have we had a proper Nintendo Direct since Doug Bowser took over?
7062000	7063000	I think maybe one.
7064000	7066000	I think there was one where they were kind of passing the torch.
7067000	7068000	I vaguely recall that.
7069000	7073000	But I don't think I mean, it's been so long since we've had a proper Nintendo Direct, really.
7074000	7075000	Yeah.
7076000	7077000	All right.
7078000	7079000	There's not one thing left in that one.
7080000	7082000	But yes, I'm extremely excited for the remaster of Nier Replicant.
7083000	7084000	That soundtrack is absolute fire.
7085000	7086000	I'm excited.
7087000	7092000	The soundtrack to those games is great, so I wouldn't see why the other one would be any different replicant.
7093000	7099000	Before you get to the next email, I have another question from Chad or comment, I suppose, from Makine.
7100000	7101000	It's not machine.
7101000	7105000	It's Makine in chat who says, hey, y'all, I just stepped in.
7106000	7109000	Have to run, but I got to share something that may or may not have already been said tonight.
7110000	7113000	Amazon has Turbografx-16 Mini back in stock.
7114000	7119000	I can't afford a next gen system and new games, so this is my new system, and I absolutely love it.
7120000	7121000	Yeah, cosign.
7122000	7124000	The Turbografx-16 Mini is a great compilation mini.
7125000	7130000	I like that it incorporates not just the cartridge or card-based games, but also the CD stuff.
7131000	7134000	There's a lot of stuff that straight up we never got in the US.
7135000	7139000	Now it's all in Japanese, they didn't go back and translate it, but it's still cool that it's there.
7140000	7141000	I think it's a really neat little selection.
7142000	7146000	I agree, the Turbografx-16 is a great little thing to pick up, and you make a good point.
7147000	7150000	New machines, like 500 bucks for a console, that's expensive.
7151000	7154000	300 bucks for a Series S, that's still not in everybody's budget.
7154000	7161000	So, you know, we here at OLR, we firmly believe you don't have to get the current stuff and the expensive stuff.
7162000	7166000	You still get to be a gamer, even if you're lagging a gen behind.
7167000	7168000	Even if you're lagging two gens behind.
7169000	7172000	Do you still play games? Yes. Then you're a gamer. Congrats.
7173000	7175000	Games are for everyone, not just the rich.
7178000	7179000	Alright.
7180000	7182000	I do have another email, but for some reason I can't get it to load.
7182000	7186000	That's weird. Do you need me to... I've tried it in two different browsers, so yeah.
7187000	7188000	Do you want me to grab it on my phone?
7189000	7194000	Yeah, go for it. I just can't get YYR's email to load, like, at all, so I apparently was not meant to read it.
7195000	7196000	That's weird, because he doesn't have attachments or anything.
7197000	7199000	Alright, here we go. I got it, I got it on my phone. That's why I'm holding my phone up.
7200000	7201000	Delete it when you're done.
7202000	7207000	Well, I'm... every... okay, do you remember the days when the mailbag was acting really bad, and it was long story...
7208000	7210000	So they still forward to my personal email, so I'm reading it out of my personal email.
7210000	7211000	Okay.
7212000	7213000	I just never turn that off. It's kind of nice.
7214000	7215000	Okay.
7216000	7220000	Alright, anyhow, here we go. YYR starts off, the subject is, yay, best game. Alright.
7221000	7228000	Hello, LR. I'm still a week or two behind on my OLR listening, but I just had to ride in after Cannon Spike was selected as a Classic Game of the Week.
7229000	7233000	It's one of my all-time favorite games. I've owned it since it launched as a late North American Dreamcast title.
7234000	7238000	I grabbed it at the EB Games by my school on day one for $30.
7238000	7241000	It's worth a lot more now, but there's no chance I'll ever sell it.
7242000	7246000	It's one of the most exciting, action-packed games I've ever played, and it's never the same game twice.
7247000	7249000	No, really, it's actually never the same twice.
7250000	7254000	The first four stages out of nine are played in a random order, and the order of stages five to seven is randomized as well.
7255000	7261000	The difficulty of any stage is determined by where in the order you play it, so a particular stage might be much more challenging during one play than the next.
7262000	7263000	But that's not all.
7263000	7268000	Enemy placement is randomized too, based on your current position in the stage when they spawn, as well as the difficulty level.
7269000	7273000	So the game becomes much more about reaction time and strategy than about memorization.
7274000	7277000	Speaking of strategy, every character has four different attacks.
7278000	7282000	The first is your standard, guard-variety, rapid-fire shot, and every character can use it.
7283000	7288000	But you also have a heavy shot that is typically slower and more powerful, as well as light and strong melee attacks.
7289000	7292000	All three of these are unique to each of the characters, and all have their pros, cons, and ideal situations.
7293000	7298000	Every moment you're playing Cannon Spike, you're needing to strategize about what attack to use and when.
7299000	7303000	And of course, every character has a limited-use invincible special attack, but those are unique and situational as well.
7304000	7308000	It would be tough to find another game of this type that requires a similar level of strategy.
7309000	7311000	Boy, he really loves this game. It just goes on.
7312000	7315000	Another great thing about Cannon Spike is its wide range of difficulty levels.
7316000	7319000	You can play on baby, child, very easy, easy, normal, hard, or very hard.
7319000	7327000	And if you play the game for a while, you'll notice distinct differences among those levels, not just with enemy hitpoints and bullet speed, but also enemy behavior and aggression.
7328000	7334000	You can steamroll the game on baby with little effort, which is great for stress relief, but succeeding on the higher levels is truly a challenge.
7335000	7342000	And if you manage to complete the game on a single credit, while playing on easy or higher, you will proceed to a second loop, where the challenge ramps up even further.
7343000	7344000	So, Cannon Spike the second quest, I suppose.
7344000	7348000	And some folks in chat remembering, oh yeah, Cannon Spike did look really interesting.
7349000	7352000	Yeah, remember this one where it kind of came up and we were all like, how did we never know about this game?
7353000	7355000	Dark Sakura picks some obscure stuff that's really cool sometimes.
7356000	7359000	And I was like, how did you not know about this game?
7360000	7364000	Because for me, it had just been kind of languishing in my vault.
7365000	7367000	It happens. The YYR is on your team. Everybody should know about this.
7368000	7371000	And finally, I must mention this.
7371000	7375000	Cannon Spike has the best boss names ever. Seriously.
7376000	7388000	Crazy Machine Jet Tiger, Bio Gorilla Bloody, Attacker Antonio, UFO Robo Vader, Snowboard Robo Rusher, Insect Robo Overlord, Sticky Piston.
7389000	7390000	Okay, I added that one.
7391000	7394000	And let's not forget Cat Lady Beauty. And that's not even all of them.
7395000	7397000	Truly, this is one of the best games ever.
7398000	7400000	I'll end by chiming in on something Rob seemed a bit worried about.
7401000	7406000	Now that the Nintendo 3DS family has ended production, how long will the 3DS eShop last, he wondered.
7407000	7414000	Well, the DSi was continued on September 30th, 2014, and the DSi shop stayed open until March 31st, 2017.
7415000	7418000	So if we go by that, it should be around at least two and a half years.
7419000	7423000	But if you recall, everything on the DSi shop moved forward to the 3DS eShop and is still purchasable.
7424000	7427000	So it's not really the same thing. It may stay open even longer.
7427000	7432000	Thanks again for the show and enjoy your week. Stay healthy, Aaron or YYR.
7433000	7437000	And SSG100Matt in our chat is saying he does love this game.
7438000	7442000	Full disclosure, YYR had Cannon Spike in his Dreamcast station at his home for years.
7443000	7447000	Alright, some follow up there to a great Classic Game of the Week pick.
7448000	7449000	Thank you YYR for sharing your thoughts.
7450000	7453000	If you would like to share your thoughts on the Classic Game of the Week or anything we've talked about on OLR,
7453000	7457000	maybe something we missed, you can send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.
7458000	7462000	I'm sorry, that's the old email address that we stopped using like three years ago.
7463000	7466000	How about participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
7467000	7470000	Alright, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7471000	7475000	It's also written in the description of every episode, so even if I fuck up and say it wrong on air,
7476000	7478000	you can go to the description and it's written right there.
7478000	7483000	Alright, speaking of things we might have missed, are there any last minute stories?
7484000	7488000	And this is the last call for you chat folks if you have any questions or comments you want us to read.
7489000	7490000	Loki, do we have any last minute stories?
7491000	7500000	Yeah, just one. Apparently the Roblox Corporation is looking to go public, so that's a thing.
7501000	7505000	Apparently they're looking to make quite a bit of money off of that.
7505000	7508000	And that's going to be something that they do next year.
7511000	7518000	Interesting. I don't play a lot of Roblox, but I know there's a ton of customizations and things that people do with that.
7519000	7523000	Well, they should be glad that they're not, I mean, they're pretty big as it is, but like,
7524000	7529000	you know how like YouTube smacks down any sort of things that they consider IP theft?
7530000	7533000	Oh yeah, there's tons of that. There's tons of that on Roblox.
7533000	7541000	That is Roblox. It's just ripping off all of the things. There's no protections whatsoever, but so yeah.
7542000	7545000	Darsakha, I heard you go, ooh, is that a last minute story or what's up?
7546000	7550000	Well, just I happened to take a quick glance at my Twitter because sometimes I see different things on there.
7551000	7554000	And for some reason, Dr. Luke is trending because I think he's dead.
7555000	7557000	Oh, interesting. Alright.
7557000	7564000	I get fucked over ketchup and everybody, but I didn't see anything on the news, so I'm not going to stand it.
7565000	7569000	We'll double check Snopes on that one because sometimes people on Twitter are weird.
7570000	7576000	Well, there's no news on it right now, so I'm just, yeah, I don't see anything about it, but I just happened to see that.
7577000	7578000	So I was fact checking it.
7579000	7582000	Oh, sjo100matt says it's a TMZ thing. That's why we're all taking it with a grain of salt.
7582000	7587000	Oh, nothing on, sorry, nothing on TMZ. Sorry, sjo100matt says nothing on TMZ.
7588000	7593000	Don't look on TMZ ever. Do not give them traffic. They are garbage.
7594000	7598000	But, but you see where my brain was like, oh, maybe they started the rumor.
7599000	7607000	Yeah. I just happened to notice and I was like, let me look. That's just why I went, oh, and because I was going to say good, but no.
7607000	7617000	All right. Any other comments, thoughts, things to address tonight before we wrap up? I guess not.
7618000	7631000	All right. Well, that is it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, whether it was live or on our podcast feed, because we are available on many different podcatchers, including Apple, iTunes, Spotify.
7631000	7642000	I don't know most of the big ones. If we're not there yet and we should be, let me know. I'll try to get us there unless it's Stitcher because we actually are not on Stitcher by choice.
7643000	7655000	They stopped updating episodes of our show and did not really seem to give a shit when I would email him or just make it seem like it's my problem, even though plenty of other catchers had no problem staying up with the show.
7655000	7665000	And I did not like that it was making us look lazy to our fans who were expecting new episodes. So I said, all right, if you can't get it right, then we're not going to have you list our show anymore.
7666000	7675000	So I pulled this off of Stitcher. So that's the story of the quick story on why we're not on Stitcher. I've tried to get us on Amazon's thing.
7676000	7678000	It's fake, by the way. Just saying.
7679000	7694000	Well, a lot of things on Twitter happen to be. I was going to say with Amazon, I think the fact we use a custom URL thing throws in for a loop, but Bobby's on there. So I don't know why they're not listing us. So whatever. Anyway.
7694000	7711000	DGRMS says, I found a way to fix it on Stitcher. Well, unless I start hearing from a ton of listeners that want to see us back on Stitcher, I don't see the point in getting us listed on Stitcher. So I would rather support other podcast platforms.
7712000	7728000	All right. I think that's it. I think that's going to wrap it up for another episode of Words on Twitter. Thank you for watching the show. Thank you for listening to the show. If you enjoyed it, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then what are we doing?
7729000	7742000	So yeah, auto hosts on Twitch. Those go a long way as well. We really appreciate all of those. Thank you to everybody who followed VOG Network. We got quite a few bits tonight. Thank you. Subscriptions. You guys have been extremely generous with the subscriptions.
7743000	7755000	You guys might have missed it. Well, you weren't here, DarkSakura and Loki. It was after we hung up on you, but we had like a sub train going after the show last week. It was insane. There's a lot of you that subbed to the show. So thank you so, so, so much.
7755000	7766000	Thank you everybody. Yeah, it's really appreciated. You don't have to do that, but you do. And so we're trying to make more content. That's why I've been really motivated to do things like the round table. And I have some other stuff that I'm working on too.
7767000	7775000	And DarkSakura's got an idea. She was floating earlier and Loki will finish his game and then we'll get to stream that. So we'll have lots and lots of content coming soon.
7776000	7783000	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for two weeks. So Loki, why don't you give us your final thought for the night?
7784000	7786000	I guess I'll be working on my game some more.
7787000	7791000	Yes, you will. Yes, you will. You get an extra weekend to do it. So make the best of it.
7792000	7803000	All right. My final thought is I'm going to get my crafters and gatherers to 80. It's going to happen in two weeks when we come back, hopefully. I don't know, but I am going out of town as well.
7803000	7813000	Which I'm really, really looking forward to just like the mental break and taking a long road trip to see a friend of mine who has been following the rules and I've been following the rules.
7814000	7824000	And, you know, we're making a choice to mix, but I'm sure it will be fine. And it will be nice after this crazy year to get a break. Sure will.
7825000	7826000	DarkSakura, your final thought?
7827000	7842000	I am back into weightlifting at home. And if anyone else is doing any kind of strength training at home, I would love to see what you're doing and see what techniques you're using because I don't think I'm ever going to step foot back in a gym.
7843000	7855000	And less like I need like really heavy things. So the number one thing is that we all have to do what we can to take care of ourselves in whatever capacity that we can. So please make sure that you're taking good care of yourself.
7856000	7866000	Yes, please. All right. That's going to go. Oh, my God. Yeah. Because the register, the deadline, the deadline to register in many states is tomorrow, Monday. Right.
7867000	7880000	Yes. So and so please, what is it? Is it just vote dot org? I know it scrolls across the bottom at some point. I'm sure it's just vote dot org. So please, please check on that because for many states, tomorrow is the last chance.
7880000	7889000	So get on it. You have a response. You have a responsibility because, yeah, we want to get past all this covid stuff.
7890000	7900000	And I'm not going to tell you how to vote, but I really only think there's one way past it. But anyway, you decide and vote. So all right. That's it. We're done. We're out of here.
7901000	7905000	Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you in two weeks. Happy gaming. Good night.
