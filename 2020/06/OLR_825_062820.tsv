0	15240	This week, Orange Lounge Radio has turned 18, new media, works in progress, same great
15240	16240	hosts.
16240	19440	It's been a contentious week in gaming news, but we have a little bit of everything to
19440	20440	discuss.
20440	24240	The march to the next generation of gaming consoles, sequels, sequels of series past,
24240	29560	even more remasters of truly underrated titles, time travel, the multiverse, and plenty more.
29560	30920	Don't take my word for it.
30920	36400	Here are your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki on the show where every gamer has
36400	37400	a voice.
37400	45460	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
45460	47640	where every gamer has a voice.
47640	56800	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 825 of our show for this June
56800	58880	the 28th of 2020.
58880	63120	Do not be alarmed, do not adjust your televisions, do not adjust your radios, yes, there's been
63120	64120	a few changes.
64120	70640	A little fresh coat of paint to celebrate 18 years of doing Orange Lounge Radio.
70640	74800	So we had a brand new, and the Twitch viewers, because we do tape live every Sunday night
74800	79320	at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the
79320	80800	Bobby Black Wolf show.
80800	85000	The Twitch viewers are seeing some videos, so we used to have some static images and
85000	87080	now we've kind of replaced those with videos.
87080	90520	And most notably, which you're going to hear on the podcast feed and you're going to hear
90520	94440	on Twitch is you're going to hear that brand new intro.
94440	100040	So the old intro, we're very thankful to Midi Head who did some stuff for DDR and Beat Media
100040	101120	back in the day.
101120	102120	Thank you so much.
102120	105440	We've been using that intro for a very long time, but you know, it's been like 14, 15
105440	106440	years.
106440	107800	So it was time for a fresh coat of paint.
107800	112460	And this intro is very special because wait until I tell you who did the new intro.
112460	115640	The new intro was done by my co-loser.
115640	119320	My co-host Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers, accomplished musician.
119320	120320	Hi, Jamie.
120320	121320	How are you?
121320	122320	I'm okay.
122320	128560	I just played around and oops, I pooped an intro.
128560	129880	No, it sounds great.
129880	134200	And when I first heard it, you've had many different iterations of that.
134200	138960	When I first heard it, I was like, okay, this isn't like, this isn't like quite as like,
138960	143720	you know how like the old intro is very like, it's time to begin the show, you know?
143720	144720	And that's a compliment.
144800	149160	And this one's very light and airy and fantasy and I was kind of like, it kind of reminds
149160	154840	me of like a Five Key Beat Mania song, which is a nice little like throwback, which I thought
154840	155840	was really cool.
155840	156840	Yeah.
156840	159160	Well, and thank you for the compliments guys.
159160	167520	I just, I've been learning Logic Pro X and I'm really enjoying it.
167520	170760	It's just, and I just started playing around with like a few things, you know, cause I'm
170760	173480	still kind of a beginner at it.
173480	176600	But as I got through it, I was like, okay.
176600	180840	And then I just picked out some like weird stuff on there.
180840	188360	Like some of that really synthy stuff was actually organ music that I changed instruments
188360	190200	on in the MIDI.
190200	192960	And I really just liked how it turned out.
192960	195440	So I'm like, hey, listen to this.
195440	197080	Hey, listen.
197080	201960	I'm surrounded by accomplished musicians because Dark Sakura of course did that theme and joining
201960	203120	me of course every week.
203120	204120	By the way, my name is Rob Roberts.
204120	205920	I don't know if I said that, but hi.
205920	208320	But joining me every week of course is tech master, Loki.
208320	209320	Hi Loki.
209320	210880	I haven't done anything in a long time.
210880	214880	I know, but you used to, now this is a throwback and a lot of our like more recent listeners
214880	219520	probably have no idea about this, but you used to do remixes like mashups.
219520	223080	Like what do they, what do they, what do they call that club?
223080	225880	Is it booty or whatever it's called in San Francisco where they do the mashups?
225880	229880	Like you used to do a lot of that type of stuff on OLR and you just haven't done one
229880	230880	in a while.
230880	231880	Yeah.
231880	233840	A friend of mine is a DJ there.
233840	234840	Yeah.
234840	238840	And meanwhile, me, I played the clarinet in high school, but like that's about as far
238840	244080	as that's, but that's as far as my music goes, like I've tried, I, uh, I got this application
244080	245760	on steam in a recent sale.
245760	249000	It's called rhythmic and it's a good, it's a good, like it's a good sequencer.
249000	251160	Like there's nothing, nothing negative against this application.
251160	255200	I think, you know, if I, if I was able to construct anything, it would be in this application,
255200	258200	but I'm just such a boob when it comes to that stuff.
258200	260520	I don't know what I'm doing.
260520	262920	Like, so I need, I guess I need to start somewhere.
262920	264560	I don't know.
264560	265840	Everyone has to start somewhere.
265840	268400	There's always a learning curve when you're trying something new.
268400	269400	True.
269400	273280	Now, if you want to see me do complete and utter failure, watch me try to figure stuff
273280	276440	out and in final cut, I can't move.
276440	283120	I'm I've made my first actual movie thing in final cut and it's of Midna being stupid.
283120	284120	Lovely.
284120	287440	Two are new theme song by the way.
287440	289540	Well, I didn't use final cut.
289580	293420	I didn't use, I got to say, I didn't use an Apple product for any of the movies tonight.
293420	294420	Except there is one exception.
294420	295660	No, there is one exception.
295660	299900	I used a free software called light works to do a lot of the video editing, which has
299900	301780	worked very well.
301780	307860	But the smush intro that only the Twitch people see, if you've never watched us live on Twitch,
307860	311580	right after Bobby ends and we pick up, we usually have about a minute or two because
311580	313980	we're trying to get everything together and make sure our recording starting.
313980	316160	So it takes a minute or two for things to transition.
316160	320760	And we have a, it used to be a static image of Mr. Smush that would say, don't go anywhere.
320760	321760	We're coming right up.
321760	330320	Now, I built a montage in iMovie from pictures from my phone and exported that into light
330320	334720	works to put on the stuff I know how to do, like use my fonts and my image.
334720	336320	So I did, I did do that.
336320	338040	I did do one thing in iMovie.
338040	340640	So this is, this is truly a buy.
340640	343460	We love all computer products.
343460	348980	We embrace them all because it's like trying to hold, it's like trying to hold something
348980	349980	together before it breaks.
349980	351380	You put a little duct tape there.
351380	353620	You put a little string here.
353620	357180	One of these days, I'm going to sit you down and teach you motion.
357180	358180	Okay.
358180	359180	Sounds good.
359180	363660	That, that splash thing that I did with the interesting animations on it before, like
363660	366460	the teaser I made, that was all made in motion.
366460	367460	Oh, nice.
367460	368460	Oh yeah.
368460	371680	It's if you've used flash before motion is easy.
371680	375960	I was going to say also speaking of art, we are debuting brand new album art this week
375960	377180	that everybody's going to see.
377180	381440	And that is also you, you actually, to be fair, you did that like five months ago.
381440	387000	It was, it was supposed to be for episode 800 and for reasons and things didn't happen.
387000	392120	And then COVID happened and it was like, well, and so the thought was, well, we'll sit on
392120	397240	all of this until we're all back under the same roof and it'll be like our big, like
397240	398240	up soft relaunch.
398240	399300	Here we go.
399300	402940	But now, unfortunately, you know, obviously the COVID thing's just getting worse in many
402940	407000	places and it seems more and more likely, you know, we're just going to have to stay
407000	412300	in separate locations, probably at least for the rest of the year, who knows, you know,
412300	416560	until it's safe and we will be listening to scientists on when it is safe.
416560	418700	And that's, that's, that's that on that.
418700	423060	And we just had an announcement here, at least in California, that six major counties are
423060	426820	having to close bars again, um, with us included.
426820	433100	And one of the bars that I think you and I have frequented quite a bit, um, I'm actually
433100	438820	friends with one of the general managers there and, um, they had an incident where someone
438820	444580	came in and they had no symptoms when they came in three days later, they were symptomatic
444580	449680	and thankfully called to tell them so, you know, which means that they were sick well
449680	452020	before they actually went into the club.
452020	453020	Yeah.
453420	458060	I haven't been to a bar since, um, before I went on that cruise was probably the last
458060	459660	time I was at a bar in Miami.
459660	464680	So, um, and I have no, like, that's, if we can't get together in the same house, I have
464680	468120	no interest in going to a bar because a bar is where you go so you don't have to meet
468120	469120	up at somebody's house.
469120	475420	So that I know I've done, I've done the restaurant thing and sometimes I felt very safe the most
475420	479560	recent time you missed it on last week's episode, I kind of went off, I did not feel great and
479560	482200	I will not go back to that restaurant even after this is over.
482200	486720	Um, but, uh, yeah, so, uh, but I have no interest in going to bars.
486720	490040	I actually don't think we're on the mandatory list, but we are in a recommended list.
490040	494520	There's like six mandatory, eight recommended, but regardless, we're on the mandatory.
494520	495520	Are we?
495520	498600	Well, I thought we were double check, but yeah, I said at least six of them, Sacramento
498600	503240	County included, regardless, none of us are going to a bar anytime soon.
503240	504240	I just don't see that.
504240	508560	I, I fussed at some of my fellow sisters quietly.
508560	509560	Yeah.
509560	510560	Because they did.
510560	511560	No, I know.
511560	513000	I know the one bar that's not downtown.
513000	516520	I've heard has been hopping and I'm like, you, I, you couldn't pay me to go there right
516520	517520	now.
517520	518520	You could.
518520	519520	Yeah.
519520	520520	Yeah.
520520	521520	The, uh, if I'm right, the leather place.
521520	522520	Okay.
522520	523520	Yeah.
523520	524520	No, that, that's where they went.
524520	528680	I'm still like, that place is so confined, but anyway, not to derail.
528680	529680	Yes.
529680	530680	It is a video game show.
530680	532160	The place that has pinball machines.
532160	533160	Let's get back to games.
533160	534160	Actually.
535160	540000	Before we get back to games, I do want to acknowledge it has been 18 years of orange
540000	541000	launch radio.
541000	543960	We started this show on June 23rd, 2002.
543960	549640	So this past Tuesday we crossed having done this on a regular basis for 18 years on a
549640	551000	pretty much a weekly basis.
551000	552000	Sure.
552000	555160	We've missed a show here and there, but for the most part, you know, we're putting out
555160	558080	40, 45 new shows a year, probably more.
558080	561860	Um, and, uh, that's more than most television shows.
561860	564140	That's more than most television shows put out.
564140	570980	Um, so, uh, you know, we've, this is a huge accomplishment for us and, um, I don't really
570980	574420	see any, you know, now that we have like a fresh coat of paint and all this other new
574420	577620	stuff, I don't see any signs of a slowing down anytime soon.
577620	582500	Um, I, I've just been very grateful for these on Sunday nights, especially in light of this
582500	584140	whole like COVID thing.
584140	589040	Um, you know, as much as it stinks that we can't all be in the same room, at least this
589040	591680	experience gives me something to kind of like look forward to.
591680	594160	And it's like, I have a reason to get out of bed today.
594160	598480	Like I know it's as dreary and as depressing as that sounds, it is still like a motivation
598480	603120	to like do something normal, if that makes sense in a non-normal world.
603120	604120	Yeah.
604120	605120	Yeah.
605120	606120	Anyway.
606120	607120	Well, and normal is relative.
607120	608120	Yes.
608120	609120	So this is normal now.
609120	614240	Um, on a, on a much more lighthearted note, let me ask this, you know, for everybody,
614240	619540	what's kind of been like a great reward from having done this for 18 years?
619540	622440	Like what, what has been that motivation to keep going?
622440	627560	Cause that's, that's a question I get a lot is how do you keep motivated for 18 years
627560	628560	to do this?
628560	631520	And I'm, there's a part of me that's like, I wouldn't know what to do with my Sunday
631520	634280	nights without it.
634280	639560	It's like, it's like that, uh, waning Garth line where Garth goes, eventually it becomes
639560	640720	a part of you.
640720	645560	That's kind of like where OLR is in some ways.
645560	648320	But uh, what about for you guys, uh, Darcyra?
648320	649320	Spite.
649320	650320	Spite?
650320	655480	Well, seriously, that first few weeks of doing the show and there is like, you need to get
655480	657600	back in geeking.
657600	662040	Well guess what?
662040	667080	That was more when we went to a podcast and suddenly we had a much larger audience.
667080	668080	I never, well, I don't know.
668240	670800	Yeah, it was in the first few weeks of doing a podcast.
670800	671800	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
671800	672800	Yeah.
672800	676920	And that was, yeah, that was, uh, guess who's here and still podcasting and guess who's
676920	679920	probably still living in mama's basement.
679920	685400	Uh, Loki, I will read a basement bitch.
685400	686400	Okay.
686400	692320	And guess who went back to the kitchen cause I'm in the kitchen.
692320	694480	Loki did get, get back in the kitchen where you belong.
694480	695480	Loki, Loki.
695480	697200	What, what, uh, what about you?
697200	699960	What's been the reward to do this for 18 years for you?
699960	700960	I don't know.
700960	706040	Just all the responses from people, um, you know, inspiring others to do their own shows
706040	710080	and just, I don't know, routine.
710080	711080	Yeah.
711080	713280	Cause I get to talk about games cause no one else wants to hear about that except for my
713280	714280	kids.
714280	719360	And then, uh, but, uh, they talk about a lot about one game.
719360	726960	So I would like to say that this gives us an amazing platform for advocacy for gamers
726960	728400	who can't advocate for themselves.
728400	729400	True.
729400	735280	You know, we just a few weeks ago we spoke out on black lives matter.
735280	742120	We've spoken for, um, you know, the whole quilt bag spectrum as, as you call it, you
742120	746480	know, and for some of the lesser accepted sexualities.
746480	754060	So I mean, hello, I'm ace, hi, um, we've, um, we've all gone through some major changes
754060	761580	and the fact that we are basically quote, normal people living normal lives and do this
761580	762580	for others really.
762580	766580	And you know, for ourselves, cause hello, I am a little selfish.
766580	773780	We, I still see no reason to stop by as long as people love us, I will thrive on that.
773780	777340	Like a goddess living on her tributes.
777340	781080	And to be fair, we're not going to stop talking on any of those things anytime soon, no matter
781080	782740	what tweets we're getting.
782740	785020	So do, do look out for that.
785020	789300	Um, I get weird stuff once in a great while.
789300	793340	It's not, I, I let the positive outweigh the negative and the positive is far, far, far
793340	794340	more.
794340	795340	Um, let's see.
795340	798380	So SG 100 mountain chat says, yeah, I don't know what I used to do on Sunday nights before
798380	799380	this show.
799380	802780	And dark to see you says, yeah, I don't even remember my Sundays before OLR.
802780	803780	It's been so long.
803780	806660	Both of those comments from our Twitch chat at VOG network.
806660	811540	Um, yeah, like it's, it's, I think back to what was I doing on Sunday nights before?
811540	816580	Uh, I, we used to go to a club a lot that doesn't exist anymore.
816580	819300	It's like, yeah, it's a cold now.
819300	828220	No, I think, I think where the club was is the PetSmart actually, but it's, it's just,
828220	829580	it's a fricking strip mall now.
829580	835580	Do you remember we had my bachelorette party there and you, you came to my bachelorette
835580	837380	party, which was awesome.
837380	844140	And we had a bajillion jello shots that Jessica made and I made everybody watch Xanadu and
844140	848100	we started watching Barbarella and then we're like, Hey, let's go to the club.
848100	849980	So we went off to the rage.
849980	853220	I think I think I separated from the girls at that point.
853220	854980	Cause like something else is going on or something.
854980	856700	I think it would be funny though.
856700	862740	If, if Cole still did that Sunday night, I'll meet you down at housewares.
862740	864740	It's called be a party.
864740	871780	It's definitely, to answer my own question, it's definitely part of the routine thing
871780	872780	for me.
872780	875540	It's a great way to make sure I'm talking to Jamie and Matt at least once a week, if
875540	877500	not more often.
877500	882700	And you know, I think part of why I've really loved doing this is just meeting all of you
882700	888140	guys that are listeners and part of the show's family and interacting with you guys.
888140	891420	And it's really funny because, you know, as I've traveled to different cities, you know,
891420	894820	I used to have a job where I did a little more travel throughout the U S and I would
894820	898060	end up in all these different cities or I would go on vacation to different cities.
898060	901880	And I remember somebody close to me commenting once like Rob, it doesn't seem to matter where
901880	903520	you go in the country.
903520	907460	You always seem to know people in this city because you're always meeting up with somebody
907460	909500	for dinner or whatever it is.
909500	913380	And I'm kind of like, well, I mean, yeah, when you live on the internet, like I'm fortunate
913380	919220	through OLR and granted some other things I've done online, but mostly OLR, I have met
919220	923300	a network of awesome people online that, you know, I'm happy to call my friends and
923300	925000	hang out with IRL.
925000	928540	And I've done that when I've gone to places like New York, Chicago, you name it, I've
928540	931700	probably met somebody through OLR there.
931700	935060	Not that I'm going to meet just anybody in a deep dark corner.
935060	938620	These are people I've interacted with for a very long time and feel safe with.
938620	941140	I don't want people to get the wrong idea.
941140	946340	But like, I remember like New York, it was probably like 2006, there was a nice big chunk
946340	948220	of OLR listeners, probably like five or six.
948220	951700	And we all went to like a Dave and Buster's, it was like a little mini OLR con.
951700	952940	It was a lot of fun.
952940	957140	So and when I went back just recently, I was able to meet a couple people like YYR and
957140	958140	Matt and Rama.
958140	961380	And, you know, it's still good to keep in touch with all my pals out there.
961380	962380	So it's great.
962380	968020	And I remember when I came out for a con.
968020	970020	Yeah, we did something.
970020	973420	And then I drifted my Lancer going, yeah, it was anime.
973460	978580	I drifted my Lancer going on to Treasure Island because I was like, hey, let's go here.
978580	981020	That was pretty cool.
981020	982020	Yeah.
982020	983020	And frightening and very frightening.
983020	984020	So.
984020	988580	Uh, so yeah, I'm just, I'm thankful to everybody that's met and taken part in this and I really
988580	989580	do appreciate you guys.
989580	991460	And some of you guys just lurk and that's fine too.
991460	994300	You just, you're listening to the podcast feed and then we'll get an email out of the
994300	999020	blue like, oh yeah, I've been listening since like 2006 and I'll be like, who are you?
999020	1001060	You never send an email or call or anything.
1001060	1002060	But I'm like, you know what?
1002100	1003980	I still appreciate this person for being a part of it.
1003980	1007100	So if you want to lurk, hey, that's fine too.
1007100	1012100	Like I'm glad you've enjoyed what we've been putting out and that you all continue to listen
1012100	1013100	regularly.
1013100	1014100	So, all right.
1014100	1017540	Well, we are going to move on with the show and talk about what's going on in the video
1017540	1023300	game world and all the things we discuss every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1023300	1029140	So let's get to our kickoff topic tonight, which I wish we had a quote unquote happier
1029140	1030220	thing to discuss.
1030220	1031460	But this is one of those.
1031460	1032900	We need to discuss it.
1032900	1035500	This is something the gaming industry is going through.
1035500	1040380	And like Jamie alluded to earlier, sometimes we have to address the difficult stuff too.
1040380	1043460	Let me turn it over to Jamie actually, I think is going to bring us up to speed on what's
1043460	1044460	going on.
1044460	1045460	Yeah.
1045460	1050580	And when they talk about an elephant in the room, this would be an elephant the size of
1050580	1052540	a kaiju, just saying.
1052540	1056340	It's pretty big and people have just been trying to ignore it forever.
1056340	1059980	But it's really come to a head.
1060020	1066540	Obviously, there are allegations against quite a number of, I'd say, prominent men in the
1066540	1069100	video game industry.
1069100	1075180	And it now looks like we have another instance added on top of it for sexual misconduct against
1075180	1082180	I'm going to mispronounce this guy's name, but Chris Avaloni, four women rose to accuse
1082180	1084420	him of sexual misconduct.
1084420	1091380	He's a acclaimed video game writer and a leading and actually one of the developers is working
1091380	1099980	with basically prompt what he departed ways with him, even though there was another game
1099980	1101860	in the work works.
1101860	1110940	And then there was another lady that accused Omid Daryani, who is the CEO of Online Performers
1110940	1116300	Group, which is a talent agency that works with streamers of making unwelcome sexual
1116300	1117860	advances.
1117860	1122220	And so Daryani resigned from his position on Sunday.
1122220	1126860	And then there's a lot of streamers who were planning on doing, I don't know if this was
1126860	1129380	this upcoming Wednesday, I'd have to double check.
1129380	1138860	I want to do a blackout for women on Twitch, which would basically the whole point of it
1138860	1149340	is to make them see that this is really, really just a prime platform for all kinds of harassment
1149340	1151420	to women streamers.
1151420	1158780	And you know, not just, you know, it's women of all backgrounds, a lot, they just haven't
1158780	1168420	really been doing a whole lot to help women who are gamers on Twitch, who are paying for
1168420	1171940	their platform to exist.
1171940	1177500	And you know, and looking just in the past, I mean, we had the, the whole gamer gate thing
1177500	1186260	before we had the, the harassment of Anita Sarkeesian, you know, and it was real harassment.
1186260	1191620	Several other, you know, people that I know, a couple of other podcasters to have been
1191620	1197220	harassed in any type of online game and a lot of a lot of us have been turning to online
1197220	1204860	gaming because we don't have really any other social circle right now to go out and participate
1204860	1206900	in.
1206900	1216420	One of the, one of the other women said that he went and told, you know, that, that Avaloni
1216420	1226460	went and told her that he never meant any harm, but you know, he was quoted saying if
1226500	1229900	I can't do anything to apologize for it, I understand that there's nothing more to be
1229900	1230900	done.
1230900	1231900	Bullshit.
1231900	1238860	And the one who talked about her name is apparently Carissa, she's not giving her last name, was
1238860	1243380	really on top of this, has just been bringing it to attention and spoke with Bloomberg about
1243380	1244380	it too.
1244380	1250380	So she said that it happened when she met Avaloni at a convention in 2012 and then another
1250380	1256500	one in 2013 and then another third one who now works at a large company posted on Twitter
1256500	1261740	a screenshot of an explicit message that she received from him in 2013 when she was looking
1261740	1263140	to break into the industry.
1263140	1269420	And another fourth said that he groped her repeatedly at a nightclub in 2014 and he's
1269420	1271900	not saying anything about it.
1271900	1279820	And also Obsidian CEO who was working with him also didn't comment about it as well.
1279820	1285660	And then another thing that Carissa said is that he got her blackout drunk and tried to
1285660	1286940	rape her.
1286940	1288020	Drunk rape.
1288020	1293100	Which if you can't consent, it's rape, just saying.
1293100	1296420	And it's just absolutely disgusting.
1296420	1304700	You know, another game designer, Kristy Dana, also said that she went out on a drink and
1304700	1312380	he kept buying drinks for the group and then, you know, she passed out and woke up naked
1312380	1313660	next to him.
1313660	1315820	Again, that's rape.
1315820	1320060	If you can't consent, it is rape.
1320060	1321060	It's just really disgusting.
1321060	1324180	You know, it's absolutely disgusting.
1324180	1329420	And we've got more and more and more coming out because, you know, I think that we're
1329420	1332580	not post-Me Too.
1332580	1338780	We are constantly going to see it because it is time to not be quiet about this.
1338780	1350500	You know, I had advancements one year at E3, very, I'm not going to get into it, but it's
1350500	1358780	really not, it's like these guys here in this industry think that, oh, you know, you're
1358780	1362100	not going to make it very far without something I have to give you.
1362100	1366540	And it's kind of a casting couch situation, you know, oh, you want to get in it?
1366540	1372060	Well, you got to do something for me, some quid pro quo there, and no, that is not right.
1372060	1379140	You know, this, these garbage people need to be held accountable and have their balls
1379140	1384220	nailed to the wall, first of all, which I would pay to see done, just saying.
1384220	1387820	But they need to be held accountable.
1387860	1391660	This is unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable.
1391660	1395420	And I'm finally glad to see that there are more and more people speaking out against
1395420	1402500	it and naming names, put the proof out there, keep your receipts and post them.
1402500	1409560	It definitely feels like on Twitter, like there's just been a avalanche of these sorts
1409560	1414140	of reports and it's, it's, it's not surprising, but it's still depressing.
1414140	1415700	You know, it's kind of that situation.
1415700	1421300	It's kind of like, unfortunately, some people in power use that power for very crappy things.
1421300	1424940	And I think, you know, we're seeing that that has been some somewhat of a recurring theme
1424940	1430020	in 2020, just over and over again, people in power are using power for crappy things,
1430020	1433180	and the rest of us are not going to take it anymore.
1433180	1438580	And it's, it's, it's gross, obviously, you know, like Jamie, I'm, I'm glad that people
1438580	1445600	are being called out and we're setting a precedent and a rule that you should not be using your
1445600	1448340	power for this shitty behavior.
1448340	1451020	And I'm seeing, I'm seeing it everywhere on Twitter.
1451020	1456160	And it's, it's, it's, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's sad.
1456160	1457160	You know what I mean, Jamie?
1457160	1458160	Right?
1458160	1460980	Like it's, it's one of those, like, I'm sad, but I'm not surprised.
1460980	1465760	I'm glad to see people are, you know, having to answer for these sorts of things, but at
1465760	1472240	the same time, gross, you know, you thought better of certain people and it's, it's, it's
1472240	1473240	a time.
1473880	1480080	Well, and there's another one, um, a PR person for Riot Games also shared an explicit text.
1480080	1485800	Um, and at the time she was trying to break in, so she forgave it, you know, but still
1485800	1493520	it's, it has to go public that this behavior is not right, no matter who does this to you.
1493520	1500600	Um, I, I'm glad to see this garbage now being held accountable for it and having difficulty
1500600	1503400	finding work and being pushed out of work.
1503400	1506900	And we need to do this with more people, you know, we need to do this with racists.
1506900	1508680	We need to do this with white supremacists.
1508680	1514640	We definitely need to do it with, um, definitely these sexual predators who are just pure garbage.
1514640	1522280	Um, you know, they, all of these garbage humans need to be held accountable.
1522280	1523940	End of story.
1523940	1525220	Call them out.
1525220	1526480	What can we do?
1526480	1527480	Well, not we.
1527480	1532080	I mean, I don't think we sitting here can do much to change Twitch, but what can Twitch
1532080	1537500	do to change Twitch in these, you talked about the blackout, which I actually think was this
1537500	1538500	past week.
1538500	1541760	I know there was a Twitch blackout that happened on, I think it was Wednesday.
1541760	1546840	Um, but I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a future protest forthcoming and so forth.
1546840	1552040	But what can, cause you know, Twitch, Twitch is in this interesting position because it
1552040	1555720	is a platform, but they don't, I mean, and I don't think it's realistic that they have
1555720	1560160	the platform to be the detective, to be the local, you know, and so forth.
1560160	1566440	But what can Twitch do to help make their platform safer?
1566440	1570440	There are two words and it's not just for Twitch.
1570440	1573400	It's for all, all really forums.
1573400	1575840	It's for the medical industry.
1575840	1577960	It's for mental health.
1577960	1580000	Believe women.
1580000	1584320	Don't just start writing it off and say, well, you had to have done something to have provoked
1584320	1585320	this.
1585320	1587280	Start it with an objective eye.
1587280	1588280	Look at the proof.
1588280	1589280	Oops.
1589280	1595920	I just hit my meatless and say, yeah, look, look at, look at the proof submitted.
1595920	1597000	Look at those chat logs.
1597000	1603120	Look at screenshots that are provided and believe when we say this is happening.
1603120	1610320	You know, I keep thinking back to, uh, you know, it was a few years ago where apparently
1610320	1615520	like some guy had used, uh, the lady's email about something or both in the same industry
1615520	1616520	did the same thing.
1616520	1621560	And he started finding that people weren't responding to, uh, the request that was made
1621560	1625440	that they were being condescending where she was starting to get her stuff done again.
1625440	1630000	You know, she had found herself in a slump and found it difficult to, to get things from
1630000	1632200	people to finish her work.
1632200	1641160	And it's ridiculous that it took a man experiencing sexism to believe her because he said he hadn't
1641160	1642760	believed her before that.
1642760	1650480	Um, and then, you know, on top of that, just when we provide you the proof, don't start
1650480	1652760	asking, Oh, well, why didn't you do this?
1652760	1654240	Why didn't you do that?
1654240	1655720	Fuck that.
1655720	1659920	Why didn't you believe when we brought this to your attention and how many times do we
1659920	1661460	have to do it?
1661500	1662500	Let me get an important.
1662500	1663500	Oh, sorry.
1663500	1664500	Don't want to cut you off.
1664500	1668780	Uh, the one other thing I was saying, you know how I mentioned the medical industry.
1668780	1675460	Do you know that it takes us sometimes up to seven years longer for heart conditions
1675460	1677900	to be diagnosed?
1677900	1682420	And I'm pretty sure that's what happened with Dan's mom, that she would be alive if they
1682420	1689700	believed her, that she was worried about her heart that we did get the notice that it was
1689700	1690700	a heart condition.
1690940	1693740	And that's a big issue in the medical industry for sure.
1693740	1699180	Is that doctors, you know, kind of, um, a lot of times we'll put a stamp on a certain
1699180	1702020	set of conditions and they don't necessarily listen to the patient.
1702020	1703780	I know that's a huge, huge issue.
1703780	1709500	Um, I do want, sorry if, if I just one little thing, just people, if you want to really
1709500	1714780	look up how bad women have it, look up endometriosis diagnoses and that's it.
1714780	1718100	Let me get this comment in our chat from quest buster, because I think this is very important
1718100	1724340	when we talk about how can twitch do a better job and I say twitch, uh, and like Jamie said,
1724340	1729540	meaning all forums and stuff, but quest buster says there's a twitch executive that has also
1729540	1734900	had allegations leveled against him and that person is in charge of partnerships, which
1734900	1740780	for some isn't surprising considering their past behavior when it comes to selective bands.
1740780	1744880	And obviously that's a huge issue if you know, the call is coming from inside the house,
1744880	1748360	so to speak, that's a huge issue that twitch has to deal with.
1748360	1749840	And there's also a part of the trash.
1749840	1750840	Yeah.
1750840	1755520	And, but there's also a part of me that's like, how does one person within twitch carry
1755520	1762480	so much power over partnerships that if this guy didn't have that kind of power, he wouldn't
1762480	1767320	be able to leverage it against people with these alleged, you know, issues that are going
1767320	1768320	on.
1768320	1773240	Um, so I kind of think that's also an issue is that there shouldn't one person should
1773240	1777400	not be left to dictate and maybe it, maybe, maybe it doesn't really work that way, but
1777400	1782560	it definitely seems like this individual again, if these allegations are true, cause legally
1782560	1789400	I have to say that, um, and so forth, where, where did this person get all that power?
1789400	1791560	Why are all this a, why are all those eggs in this basket?
1791560	1796560	And I think that's something twitch needs to look at is the division of power within
1796560	1803720	the organization and making sure that there is a decent amount of women in power, minorities
1803720	1804720	in power.
1804720	1811280	And to be fair, I believe, um, the, uh, person, uh, getting the complaints is, is, um, is
1811280	1813960	a minority, but it doesn't, it doesn't like matter.
1813960	1814960	You know what I mean?
1814960	1819240	They still need to have representation across the board in different positions of power,
1819240	1820240	if that makes sense.
1820240	1825000	Well, and to, to bring attention to what Bobby just said in chat, um, he said, and the sad
1825000	1828840	part is that it could be any man before you, not all men this.
1828840	1834200	And that is really the thing that actually is going to go back to, I think even with
1834200	1838680	the police thing too, you know, the, the, the all cops are bastards thing.
1838680	1841920	The problem is, is that there are enough.
1841920	1848400	That means we can't trust any until, you know, we know them and the proof has been laid bare
1848400	1850680	and we know that this is a trustworthy person.
1850680	1857360	And even then there are people out there who are complete predators who will lean in,
1857360	1859600	you know, try to be the gentleman.
1859600	1860600	And then they turn around.
1860600	1861600	Well, I'm a nice guy.
1861600	1862600	You owe me.
1862600	1870880	So even, even then, you know, so before anyone says like the not all men thing, it's enough.
1870880	1873640	It is enough to make us trust none of you.
1873640	1880200	Um, Bobby in chat says, well, actually let me, let me follow that up in just a minute.
1880720	1883000	Bobby says, well, it's great that I know I'm not a creep.
1883000	1884320	I give off the creep vibe.
1884320	1887760	If someone just looks at me at a gaming event, I don't expect any woman to trust me at a
1887760	1888760	gaming event.
1888760	1892240	I mean, I have long hair, goatee, heavyset, I fit the profile.
1892240	1895600	Bobby's a great guy for what it's worth, but I understand what he's saying.
1895600	1899280	And like you say, dark soccer, you trust me, but, um, here's the thing.
1899280	1903120	So like, you know, I love to go out and play like Pokemon go and ingress and Orna and all
1903120	1904760	these location based games of the park.
1904760	1905760	Right?
1905760	1909200	Well, just recently I was at a park and I was walking around farming and ingress and
1909200	1912160	you know, that involves, I'm staring at my phone, I'm doing this thing.
1912160	1915800	This woman at the park thought I was taking pictures of her and she's like, can you not
1915800	1917800	point that at me?
1917800	1922240	And while there was a part of me that wanted to clap back and be like, don't flatter yourself.
1922240	1926640	There is also that part of me that's like, let it go.
1926640	1930600	She's obviously got something going on that you don't know about.
1930600	1936040	So I just kind of like turned so my back was to her and kind of, you know, kept doing my
1936040	1937840	thing a different direction.
1937840	1943320	So and unfortunately, you know, playing the location based games I got in even just yesterday,
1943320	1947140	just yesterday, somebody was, it wasn't quite the same situation, but somebody was like,
1947140	1949200	are you taking pictures of that car?
1949200	1950280	What is, is that your car?
1950280	1955200	And I was like, no, I'm playing a game and she was like, Oh, okay.
1955200	1959360	You know, I kind of like tilted my phone enough so that you could see the ingress screen and
1959360	1961520	I don't expect that to make sense to anybody.
1961520	1967100	But you know, so my point is, and I am kind of like tying this to games in a way is that,
1967100	1974480	you know, I have to remember that not everybody is going to think I have the best intentions.
1974480	1978100	I have to kind of earn that, if that makes sense.
1978100	1985900	And the other thing too, is that, gosh, I just lost my train of thought on that one.
1985900	1994940	It's that we, that women, you know, and anybody who is in, I'm going to go ahead and say a
1994940	2001580	marginalized group has to do extra to watch our asses.
2001580	2007600	You know, if I'm going out to say, check the mail, I have my keys in my hand.
2007600	2009560	Like I'm going to stab a bitch.
2009560	2015380	You know, if I'm walking out to my car when I am, you know, in midtown, even in sister
2015380	2021400	face, you know, going out and doing ministry, I still have one of my sisters with me to
2021400	2026480	walk to the car, even though not many people, you know, have had pretty good responses.
2026480	2034120	Everyone's like, oh, hey sister, hey, I still do not go alone.
2034120	2038660	I think conventions need to have, and to be fair, like a lot of them do have a policy,
2038660	2040880	although it's not always well known.
2040880	2044740	And so it needs to be something that's like easily accessible and easily understandable.
2044740	2048520	There should definitely be policies at conventions for people to do not feel safe, like how they
2048520	2052200	can report that they feel like they're in an unsafe position and somebody with con
2052200	2055680	security or something can either like escort them to a car or to a hotel or whatever it
2055680	2058920	is that they need, you know, and sometimes that kind of stuff is like an afterthought
2058920	2062280	like that, that number or that procedure should be like on the back of the badge.
2062280	2067200	And again, some cons do have that, like, you know, one of the ones I was working with had
2067200	2069240	it actually built into policies now.
2069240	2070240	Cool.
2070240	2071240	But that should be the standard.
2071240	2072240	Right?
2072240	2073240	Yeah, it should be.
2073240	2075520	And E3 didn't have that.
2075520	2078640	And it's at least in the years we went and maybe they've changed it since then.
2078640	2079840	I haven't been in many years.
2079840	2083160	And that is something that, you know, industry shows and industry actors need to have as
2083160	2084160	well, you know?
2084160	2091280	Well, and the thing is, and, you know, back when we were doing E3, you know, you know
2091280	2100320	me, I go into pure con mode and I wander off by myself, but I also have this kind of weave
2100320	2103320	that I do in crowds, you know?
2103320	2107960	And like, if I am, you know, a lot of times when I was out doing cosplay, I would have
2107960	2115080	a very large prop with me because it's damn hard to miss a fan that's as big as I am.
2115080	2120000	And it's damn hard to miss big black wings walking around through, you know, a crowded
2120000	2127880	hall or are wearing like six inch platform heels that I could, you know, kick somebody
2127880	2130120	to death with if I chose to.
2130120	2136040	You know, I, when I do, even in choosing like my cosplay for going to conventions, I try
2136040	2142400	to pick something that I can use as a weapon or I can use to defend myself because I like
2142400	2143720	to go by myself.
2143720	2144720	Yeah.
2144720	2146720	I didn't need somebody to protect me.
2146720	2151400	SSG100 Matt in chat says, my girlfriend gets harassed in public, including in gaming.
2151400	2155940	Men often feel the need to test her gaming knowledge or flex their superiority to her.
2155940	2160100	She handles it well, but it's frustrating that happens to her and many others.
2160100	2161100	You know what?
2161100	2162100	You bring up an excellent point, Matt.
2162100	2167780	And that is that we like it is, it is the year 2020 and we all need to make an agreement.
2167780	2170880	I think it's going to be a very easy thing for the, for our hosts and our listeners to
2170880	2171880	all agree to.
2171880	2175580	Um, I think this will be very easy and I'm not sure we're the ones that necessarily need
2175580	2179440	to change our mindset, but can we, can we kind of start a wave here and get the people
2179440	2180440	we know to do this?
2180440	2186340	And this is simply, can we just accept that everyone plays video games and everyone can
2186340	2192480	play video games and video games are fun for everyone and everyone should be able to enjoy
2192480	2198360	video games and everyone is going to like video games at different levels of enthusiasm,
2198360	2202320	meaning not everybody's going to know the name of every single monster in the legend
2202320	2203320	of Zelda.
2203320	2204320	And that's fine.
2204320	2205320	That doesn't mean they're not a gamer.
2205320	2208160	And some people do know the names of every monster in the legend of Zelda.
2208160	2209160	And that's fine too.
2209160	2211100	They're not a nerd or a basement dweller.
2211100	2216080	They just like games the way that another person might be able to name the baseball
2216080	2219080	roster for the New York Yankees in the year 2004.
2219080	2220080	Right?
2220080	2221080	Yeah.
2221080	2226360	Everybody has their different passions and enthusiasms and so forth and we need to respect
2226360	2227360	fandoms.
2227360	2228360	Yeah.
2228360	2236320	And I, I even, you know, I'll, I'll even cause I do get the, Oh, prove it thing, you know,
2236320	2237320	whatever.
2237320	2242400	I mean, thankfully I've got the podcaster, I'm like, um, look me up on this.
2242400	2243400	That's all I have to say.
2243400	2244400	Google me, bitch.
2244400	2245400	Google me, bitch.
2245400	2246400	Right.
2246400	2252120	But you know, the other, the other thing is that, you know, I've just flat out saying,
2252120	2253840	I don't have shit to prove to you.
2253840	2254840	I know myself.
2254840	2255840	Fuck you.
2255840	2256840	That's all I say.
2256840	2261840	Or, you know, if I really feel like proving it, I'm like, name a video game system.
2261840	2264240	I'll tell you if I have it.
2264240	2267640	And you know, and I used to, you know, funny enough to kind of bring this full circle with
2267640	2271840	the, the 18 years of OLR thing, I used to complain about this a lot in the earlier days
2271840	2277360	of OLR was the judgment I would get as a gay dude because I played video games and it was
2277360	2278360	like, Oh, what?
2278360	2283520	You don't follow fashion or listen to Madonna or, you know, and I, I, I am absolutely stereotyping
2283520	2286860	here, but these types of things like what happened is that it was like, Oh, you play
2286860	2287860	video games.
2287860	2291880	Isn't that like what, like, you know, basement boys do type of thing.
2291880	2298440	And so, you know, that now, luckily in the years that we've been doing this show, I kind
2298440	2305200	of feel like gay nerds and gamers like that has really like, there's a lot of gay guys
2305200	2307720	that play video games and that's very much accepted now.
2307720	2311600	Like I don't feel the same way now in 2020 that I probably did in the earlier days of
2311600	2312600	this show.
2312600	2316840	But you know, what age of the gamer, well, you know, what helped a lot with that was
2316840	2321840	having a place like where we had gamer X and the, like, if I could point out, when did
2321840	2324360	things feel like they started to turn around?
2324360	2328480	Oh, when there was a convention for people like me, that was a big one.
2328480	2329480	Yeah.
2329480	2330480	Yeah.
2330480	2331480	Matt Khan, you hear us bring it back.
2331480	2335720	Well, he's, there was, I don't think he'll be bringing it back yet.
2335720	2339960	But the organization, yes.
2339960	2345120	And obviously not in the age of COVID either, but at some point, you know, hopefully we
2345120	2346960	do see a convention like that.
2346960	2349160	Well, there is that flame con that happens in New York.
2349160	2353560	I think that's a little more, it's more like a gay nerd con than just game gay games, but
2353560	2355960	I would love to go to that at some point.
2355960	2359960	And you know, the, the bar that people were going to, that we were just poo pooing earlier
2359960	2361480	about people going there.
2361480	2369680	Um, I actually am doing a flyers and advertisement for their classic game, uh, Friday one month,
2369680	2370680	which I love.
2370680	2374680	Cause the one time I went, Jamie, it was really sad, but I'm, I'm glad to hear they're stepping
2374680	2375680	their game up.
2376200	2379720	Yeah, no, they, they, they're really trained to, to make it better.
2379720	2383520	And, you know, I said that, you know, I can't, of course can't do it now, but I was like,
2383520	2384520	I'll bring the turbo graphics.
2384520	2385520	We'll bring a TV.
2385520	2386520	It'll be cool.
2386520	2387520	Yeah.
2387520	2391680	You know, and, but I've been doing the, the flyers and everything for that once it comes
2391680	2392680	out.
2392680	2397160	Um, of course that all really got put to the sidelines, but I'm, I'm really good friends
2397160	2398520	with the person that runs that.
2398520	2399520	Cool.
2399520	2400520	Well, I hope to see that improve.
2400520	2401520	Anyway.
2401520	2404720	Um, I know this is a big topic and we probably need to spend more time on it, but I think
2404760	2405760	you still have a seven 30 cutoff.
2405760	2406760	Right.
2406760	2407760	Jamie.
2407760	2408760	So I probably need to keep it.
2408760	2409760	But I can budget a little bit.
2409760	2410760	Okay.
2410760	2414000	Well, let's, let's go ahead and move forward with the show, um, as we have other things
2414000	2419760	to discuss, but I'm sure this topic that was just under discussion, uh, will unfortunately
2419760	2425780	come up again, but it's one of those things where I hope we can learn, you know, as a
2425780	2430700	group to do better through these things, you know, like dark Sakura said, believe women,
2430700	2436380	like I said, respect fandoms and you know, the, everybody plays video games and so forth.
2436380	2442460	And I think once these types of attitudes start to really become, they spread and they
2442460	2447660	become out there, I think those will be the first steps into creating a better environment
2447660	2448660	for games.
2448660	2449660	That makes sense.
2449660	2450660	So agreed.
2450660	2451660	All right.
2451660	2455460	Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks since we are gamers, what were the types
2455460	2457580	of video games that we were playing this week?
2457580	2459620	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
2459660	2463940	I have been playing, of course, a lot of animal crossing because it's easy.
2463940	2471300	Um, and I've also been, I finally, I actually beat every new puzzle on patterned again.
2471300	2475700	Um, which I love that game is so relaxing is so chill.
2475700	2480700	Um, so that's really been the big two.
2480700	2486420	Um, and I actually, I started playing words with friends too, which I blame, uh, Samantha
2486420	2490180	of, um, stuff mom never told you podcast.
2490180	2495340	Um, I, I know I just, I have been a, the message and say, Hey, I haven't played words with
2495340	2496340	friends in a while.
2496340	2497340	So I play with me.
2497340	2498340	I'm like, okay, I will.
2498340	2499340	She's cool.
2499340	2503860	Um, so I, I'm now playing words with friends too again, so it's pretty fun, uh, make my
2503860	2507100	brain work and that's about it.
2507100	2508100	That's about it.
2508100	2510260	Um, you know, I like my stuff.
2510260	2515100	I made an alt and animal crossing Dan and I both did so that we can make, pay off all
2515100	2520340	of those houses and make like shopping centers in a house.
2520340	2521340	Nice.
2521340	2522340	All right.
2522340	2523340	My audio got out of sync a little bit.
2523340	2524340	Sorry.
2524340	2535340	Uh, because he didn't name his character, his name, no, but yeah, that's it.
2535340	2540460	All right, let me go to Loki and there might be a quick, I'm actually gonna just try to
2540460	2543900	fix my discord issues, but Loki, if you wouldn't mind talking about your gaming week here while
2543900	2545660	I try to fix some stuff on my end.
2545660	2546660	Sure.
2546660	2549700	So I, it was pretty much all Minecraft this week.
2549700	2554700	So there was the brand new, um, another update that came out.
2554700	2560460	Uh, so it was, uh, that was out on Tuesday.
2560460	2565420	So I've been, uh, you know, checking out that and working on our realm and doing that kind
2565420	2566940	of stuff.
2566940	2575660	And then, um, outside of that, I was also playing some, um, uh, Orna of course.
2575660	2577860	And then that's pretty much it.
2577860	2580820	Watch my kids been playing, um, animal crossing.
2580820	2581820	They've been really good.
2581820	2589340	Well, my son's been really getting into that, but it's been mainly just, um, just Minecraft
2589340	2590340	for the most part.
2590340	2591340	All right.
2591340	2596540	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, which I only heard half of, sorry, but I think I
2596540	2598020	fixed my issues.
2598020	2600780	Um, I will talk about my gaming week.
2600780	2601780	All right.
2601780	2602780	Yeah.
2602780	2603780	I've got issues.
2603780	2604780	I has them.
2604780	2606780	Uh, my gaming week, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff I usually do.
2606780	2610140	My location games that I love my ingress, my Pokemon go, my Orna.
2610140	2613780	I've been playing all those games, uh, but I've been playing stuff on a console and PC
2613780	2617140	as well, including continued adventures and final fantasy 14.
2617140	2623740	I almost have completed the fate grind, which means the, uh, a fate is a world quest event
2623740	2625780	basically that happens in a zone.
2625780	2628300	And in the latest expansion, you can get a reward.
2628300	2632740	If you do like, I think it's like 70 fates in every zone and we're working on the last
2632740	2633740	zone right now.
2633740	2634740	So that's very exciting.
2634740	2635740	I'm making progress on that.
2635740	2639580	Um, so a lot of the same old games, but I did play a new game this week.
2639580	2642220	Uh, it just hit game pass not that long ago.
2642220	2648420	Uh, so on Xbox one, I've been playing the messenger, which is a, uh, it's definitely
2648420	2651820	inspired by Ninja Gaiden, uh, from back in the day.
2651820	2653540	It's very heavily inspired.
2653540	2658020	And what I like about it is that it kind of winks and nods to the game that inspired
2658020	2660540	it, uh, quite constantly.
2660540	2661780	And I think that's really cool.
2661780	2666140	Uh, it has that kind of retro look to it, but the game is it's, you know, obviously
2666140	2670060	wide screen, uh, and the, the graphics do feel like a little bit amped up, even though
2670060	2673540	it has that retro look, I love that it's very tongue in cheek.
2673540	2681340	Um, it doesn't have quite the same cinematic story, uh, that Ninja Gaiden had, but I think,
2681340	2687860	uh, this story instead kind of like is a little more tongue in cheek and a little more silly
2687860	2691500	and a little more self referencing, but I think that's kind of cool.
2691500	2692820	And the gameplay is really fun.
2692820	2696780	Like it really kind of feels like you're playing, you know, the old Ninja Gaiden game.
2696780	2702260	So, you know, right in the beginning you can do like a double jump if you hit like a lantern
2702260	2703260	that's in the air.
2703260	2705340	So you jump, hit the lantern, you can jump again.
2705340	2708420	And so that leads to kind of some interesting mechanics and there's, there's things that
2708420	2710380	weren't in the game that inspired it.
2710420	2715540	There's things like swimming and there's this whole like death mechanic that you get your,
2715540	2720420	uh, life back, but the little demon will take souls from you and things like that.
2720420	2721660	So it's, it's fun.
2721660	2722660	It's cute.
2722660	2725580	And, uh, the nice thing with game pass, it didn't cost me anything extra.
2725580	2726940	So I've been able to check that out.
2726940	2729180	So if you have game pass, I would recommend that for sure.
2729180	2732340	Cause I think that has been a fun game.
2732340	2734500	So that's been between that.
2734500	2735500	Yeah.
2735500	2736500	That's pretty much my gaming week.
2736500	2739820	So, all right, well, let's move on and get into some things that have been happening
2740260	2744380	in the news and this is, this is a whopper starting us off tonight.
2744380	2745380	Loki.
2745380	2746380	Yeah.
2746380	2750300	It's, uh, it's something.
2750300	2757180	So there was a surprise announcement that, um, Microsoft made, I think on Twitter even,
2757180	2763900	and it was that, Hey, uh, mixer is shutting down as of July 22nd and they are partnering
2763900	2766260	with Facebook gaming moving forward.
2766260	2772460	So if you happen to be a partner status in mixer, that'll transfer over to Facebook gaming,
2772460	2774300	assuming that you sign up over there.
2774300	2779140	Um, they're basically matching all existing partner agreements as closely as possible.
2779140	2787900	Uh, Ew, for one, um, triple Ew.
2787900	2789140	I need a new graph.
2789140	2792340	You know, while we've got new graphic and sound effects, I need one for that triple
2792340	2796060	Ew.
2796060	2801780	So yeah, so that, that sucks for everybody that jumped in on a mixer and stuff.
2801780	2804140	I mean, I know they're pimping the hell out of that.
2804140	2810180	Even like, uh, when we used to go to GameStop months ago, uh, they would have on their games
2810180	2816140	or their little Microsoft kiosk, whatever, just be pimping out mixer all the time.
2816140	2818140	And now that's just, it's, it's gone.
2818140	2824660	So I'm unfortunate for a lot of folks that were dedicating themselves to that platform.
2824660	2828620	Not sure if anyone's really getting jumped ship to Facebook gaming.
2828620	2830940	Um, like, I don't know.
2830940	2832260	It's that's, that's tough.
2832260	2837020	And I want to say like, I, there's a few streamers that I watch on like YouTube and stuff like
2837020	2841180	one, one in particular, Ali 43, but I think tried the Facebook gaming stuff.
2841180	2847140	And I want to say that the issue there was either it was hard to monetize the streams
2847140	2852300	or it was hard to discoverability was a problem, uh, just the way it's set up.
2852340	2857500	I don't know what their issues are over there, but you not going to know.
2857500	2864260	Um, so I'm thinking a lot of folks will go back to Twitch probably, or YouTube, um, streaming.
2864260	2867540	Like, but yeah, they had a lot of features that sounded really cool.
2867540	2872340	Um, I'm curious now, like I know they had mixer integration for like Minecraft and stuff.
2872340	2874340	So now that's going to be broken.
2874340	2876140	So I don't know.
2876140	2880620	I'm going to be very candid on something here and just say, um, what I think many of us
2880620	2883420	are thinking, and that is that Facebook gaming fucking sucks.
2883420	2889140	And um, there's, it, it really does feel like, like a one, two punch in the face for mixer
2889140	2893380	to be folding into Facebook gaming because Facebook gaming is so fucking terrible.
2893380	2899300	Um, and I, again, I am here to support all broadcasters and all indie people.
2899300	2902540	And if you are a person that streams on Facebook gaming, I'm sorry.
2902540	2906860	If what I'm saying right now feels offensive, my issues are not to the streamers there.
2906860	2908820	My issues are with the platform.
2908820	2914100	Facebook as a platform has no business getting into this gaming arena.
2914100	2919760	And one of the biggest sticking points I have with Facebook gaming, despite, in addition
2919760	2925180	to the fact that the layout sucks for it, the discoverability sucks for it, the monetization
2925180	2926180	sucks for it.
2926180	2930660	The way that you try to find things and stuff you want to watch on it sucks for it.
2930660	2934880	All those things aside, the thing that really ticks me off about Facebook gaming is Facebook's
2934880	2937060	real name policy.
2937140	2940900	What did we just fucking talk about?
2940900	2946880	What was the topic that was just under discussion on this program?
2946880	2953000	And Facebook wants to mandate that everybody should use their real names.
2953000	2955460	I don't fucking think so.
2955460	2961460	Like it just goes to show that Facebook has no fucking idea what they're getting into.
2961460	2964780	And I understand Facebook has a lot of viewers.
2964780	2969820	They had more viewers than Mixer because Facebook is a monopoly.
2969820	2975500	There should be antitrust movements against Facebook because they have their hands in
2975500	2977820	so many cookie jars.
2977820	2983580	It's so easy for them to insert and inject the Facebook gaming stuff into your feed when
2983580	2985420	I don't want it.
2985420	2986420	Sorry.
2986420	2989540	I just, I know I'm ranty, but I agree.
2989540	2993900	I really don't like Facebook getting into this space.
2993900	2999160	And I agree, like I, there's like no, nothing I would watch on there.
2999160	3003580	Like I would not go there ever for any sort of content whatsoever.
3003580	3009000	Even if I would not stream it on a train, I would not stream it on a plane.
3009000	3013460	I would not watch it on the bus.
3013460	3015980	I would not watch any of us.
3015980	3020180	Like that's, it's not, I'm not getting on Facebook gaming and you can clip fine, clip
3020180	3021460	it, save it as a receipt.
3021460	3025460	I will quit broadcasting before I stream on Facebook gaming trust.
3025460	3028900	I know you're not supposed to burn your bridges in this industry.
3028900	3030580	I have no problem setting that one on fire.
3030580	3031580	Sorry.
3031580	3037340	So, so, so far of the big names that were on, um, Mixer, some of the big names, uh,
3037340	3039500	Ninja and shroud are moving back to Twitch.
3039500	3045980	Uh, there is one though, um, King, uh, Gothio, the Goth lion or something.
3045980	3053060	Um, he is going to be moving to Facebook, but I don't know.
3053060	3056900	And to be clear, and since I've been kind of a bitch, my heart really does go out to
3056900	3059900	the folks on Mixer that were impacted by this.
3059900	3064500	And like, you know what, not everybody necessarily knows this, but I'll be very transparent.
3064500	3071280	Uh, when we were looking to relocate VOG network off of shout cast and move to a video platform,
3071280	3074080	Mixer was under heavy consideration.
3074080	3078560	And one of the reasons why Mixer at the time was appealing was because it was like, Oh,
3078560	3082320	in twit on Twitch, there's like a lot of, lot of noise.
3082320	3086620	And on Mixer, what used to be beam pro at the time, there is the potential to maybe
3086620	3091000	do something that is, uh, able to get found out a little easier through that noise, because
3091000	3095480	there weren't a lot of podcasters, there was a few, but there weren't a lot of podcasters
3095480	3099760	and folks that were doing their thing on Mixer at the time that that topic was under discussion.
3099760	3104400	And I really liked the concept of the, um, what were they called over there?
3104400	3109040	The, the sparks or something like, as you watch to feed you, which Twitch ended up integrating,
3109040	3112660	uh, a system that's very similar, but at the time it was exclusive to Mixer.
3112660	3113660	And I really liked that.
3113660	3118520	And I kind of thought that went with the theme of participation and so forth, but what really
3118520	3124600	ended up swaying the deal the other way was that it was too hard to become a Mixer partner.
3124600	3129460	And at the end of the day, I think that was Mixer's biggest weakness versus Twitch.
3129460	3135120	And I appreciate Mixer existing to give Twitch some real competition because I'm sorry, Facebook
3135120	3136860	gaming is not real competition.
3136860	3142860	Um, Steam, like literally it's, did you know, Steam has a whole broadcasting thing and like
3142860	3149260	all it really was this flute, we, we just, we threw it out there and now we're just letting
3149260	3153980	the vultures eat it because we're like, Steam literally is doing nothing to curate or grow
3153980	3154980	that platform.
3154980	3159540	And it's like, we made this and now let's do, let's not make Half-Life 3.
3159540	3164120	And I don't think you can monetize anything on there either, but, um, so Mixer, they had
3164120	3169540	an article in the Mixer blog, they basically talked about why they kind of went this route.
3169540	3173400	So they said, ultimately the success of our partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent
3173400	3178020	on our ability to scale the platform for them quickly and as broadly as possible, it became
3178020	3182500	clear that the time needed to grow our own live streaming community to scale was out
3182500	3186740	of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox wants to deliver to
3186740	3187740	gamers now.
3187740	3192620	So we decided to close operations, um, we didn't want to do it anymore.
3192620	3193620	Yes.
3193620	3195300	So, but here's, here's the writing on the wall here.
3195300	3199620	So it says, you know, we're teaming up with Facebook to enable Mixer community transition
3199620	3200620	to Facebook gaming.
3200620	3205760	This is a key part of our broader effort that Xbox and Facebook gaming are embarking on.
3205760	3210940	So this leads me to believe that all these integrations that we have with Mixer and stuff
3210940	3214140	are going to now be integrations with Facebook gaming.
3214140	3217380	But I mean, that sucks, I guess.
3217380	3221200	But at the same time, if it's not popular, they're not going to support it.
3221200	3225080	So we'll see, just don't use the platform and it'll go away.
3225080	3228180	Facebook gaming can kiss my fat fucking ass.
3228180	3233220	And if the Xbox series X is going to rely on Facebook integration and it's going to,
3233220	3237700	it is seriously going to potentially impact my decision to get an Xbox series X, that
3237700	3242140	is how much I want to separate myself from Facebook and especially not get into this
3242140	3243140	gaming space.
3243140	3248060	I think it'll be optional, just like the integrations with like, um, Mixer and stuff.
3248060	3252780	And I think what will happen is, is if it isn't taking off like they thought it would,
3252780	3255900	and I'm sure there's some money changing hands, partnerships and whatnot.
3255900	3257720	So there's going to be some of the integration.
3257720	3261500	I'm sure that it's up to the developers on what they want to integrate with.
3261500	3264100	A lot of them are going to be doing stuff with Twitch.
3264760	3271300	I'm sure that just because maybe Microsoft studio games will decide to have some special
3271300	3275940	integrations with Facebook gaming, that that's not necessarily going to close the door and
3275940	3282360	other titles to integrate with, I say, Twitch or something else, or, you know, it's just,
3282360	3283700	it's not a huge deal.
3283700	3289720	Like, I don't know, you may see like a Facebook gaming app on the new Microsoft console, not
3289720	3290720	the same.
3290720	3291720	You won't see a Twitch app on there.
3291720	3297560	Um, I don't know, I just, I don't see it being very popular.
3297560	3300080	Let me get a couple of chat comments I think are worth responding to, because I think these
3300080	3301720	are a couple of big, big points.
3301720	3306640	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Ninja and shroud brought a lot of streamers to Mixer, but not
3306640	3307640	a lot of viewers.
3307640	3309920	And I agree that was mistake number one.
3309920	3314340	And I'm not like throwing shade at these big streamers who I know work very hard to get
3314340	3315960	the audiences that they have.
3315960	3321800	But the reality is they are not a magic ticket to making the platform larger.
3321800	3326540	It would have been smarter for Mixer to address the question, why aren't more people streaming
3326540	3327960	here in the first place?
3327960	3332520	And I done just told you the answer is that it was too much harder to monetize on Mixer
3332520	3334480	than it was versus, versus Twitter.
3334480	3339000	You could have had us Mixer, like lots of streaming failures that they're already having.
3339000	3343340	So like, but there were, again, there were a lot of great things that Mixer kind of had,
3343340	3349820	but I, if they had made it easier to get to that level of monetization and work, be really
3349820	3353540	feeling like you're a part of the community, I don't think they would have needed to throw
3353540	3357880	Ninja or shroud millions of dollars because they would have attracted smaller and mid-level
3357880	3358880	streamers.
3358880	3361880	And that would have been huge because then you get all that promotion on Twitter and
3361880	3362880	all that other stuff.
3362880	3368220	Now, Pele Hanumea in chat bringing up another excellent point is Kindle, Roku, and my Samsung
3368220	3370220	TV don't have Mixer app.
3370220	3371220	Bingo.
3371320	3375220	Another big problem with it is that Twitch is available pretty much everywhere at this
3375220	3376220	point.
3376220	3380900	Uh, Mixer was available on PC and on Xbox, which is, you know, cool if you're streaming,
3380900	3382660	you know, Xbox related content and stuff.
3382660	3388500	And it was really well integrated into Windows 10, but beyond that, it's a lot harder to
3388500	3389500	get on the Mixer.
3389500	3394240	And I think Mixer really, not that Mixer necessarily needed to be on PlayStation, but it needed
3394240	3395240	to be more places.
3395240	3398100	The, the Switch was a huge untapped thing, sorry.
3398100	3404780	And here's a kick in the balls for, um, for Mixer anyway, is that, um, the Twitch, uh,
3404780	3410820	streaming app now, um, has a beta out for Mac.
3410820	3420100	So yeah, they're, they're definitely embracing, um, many more non-Microsoft, uh, areas.
3420100	3424100	I mean, while they were growing in numbers like Facebook gaming.
3424100	3427340	So I was looking at some numbers from 2019.
3427340	3432860	So at December, 2019, Facebook gaming had 8.5% of the market share.
3432860	3439040	Whereas Twitch is 61%, uh, YouTube gaming, 27.9 and Mixer was 2.6.
3439040	3445120	Whereas the previous year, 2018 Mixer was 2% and Facebook gaming was only 3.1.
3445120	3450700	So it definitely, you know, they definitely are growing.
3450700	3452060	Is that sustainable?
3452060	3454900	Eh, I don't know.
3454900	3460120	Um, but I don't see them like dominating the marketplace.
3460120	3465660	I see them as sticking around for a while until it's not making them money enough.
3465660	3467380	I see them as leeching it.
3467380	3470760	I, I, I will miss Mixer for the competition.
3470760	3474980	It was giving Twitch the healthy competition and I think it was forcing each other to innovate.
3474980	3480760	Um, Facebook is innovating nothing, so I don't see, um, Twitch having to, uh, really respond
3480760	3481760	in that regard.
3481760	3483060	Um, so it will be interesting to see.
3483060	3486700	I mean, I guess YouTube is now kind of the big competitor in that space with Twitch.
3486700	3491500	It'll be interesting to see if maybe a Phoenix rises from the ashes and we get kind of like
3491500	3496360	a beam pro 2.0 type of thing, uh, to, to compete.
3496360	3497360	We'll see.
3497360	3498360	I don't know.
3498360	3502140	But my, again, my heart goes out to those that invested so much on the Mixer just to
3502140	3503860	have the rug pulled out from under them.
3503860	3507900	And it, it, I think it should make, I mean, between that and I don't think it's on the
3507900	3513020	show role tonight, but we have the news about like the Microsoft stores are going away basically.
3513020	3518500	And that's all changing to like, I can understand why people are kind of cautious of Microsoft
3518500	3519500	in the moment.
3519500	3525460	Um, and that's a real bummer because there's so much enthusiasm for what Microsoft's about
3525460	3529940	to bring to the table through their cloud gaming and through the series X and through
3529940	3532560	the studios that they've purchased and so forth.
3532560	3535940	So maybe Microsoft sitting on a poker hand that they say, you know what, people are going
3535940	3539000	to forget about these crappy things because this poker hand we're holding of all these
3539000	3543080	things we're yet to announce is so good that we're cleaning things up before we kind of
3543080	3546720	put our cards on the table, so to speak, but they think it is, or they think, yeah, they
3546720	3547720	think it is.
3547720	3555640	Um, I just, but my, I mean, real people were affected by this and it just, it really stinks.
3555640	3560600	And I, I just feel businesses really care that real people are, of course, of course
3560600	3567080	they don't, of course they don't know, but I think that's a wake up call to every streamer
3567080	3574320	and no matter where you're broadcasting, that's it, end of sentence, that's the tweet, it
3574320	3576360	should be a wake up call for everybody.
3576360	3583520	Uh, the platform at the end of the day will sell you to Facebook if that's what they feel
3583520	3588360	like they need to do to make the most money for their investors or the people that make
3588360	3589360	the money off it.
3589360	3593360	And isn't what now doing like a welcome back kind of thing?
3593360	3594360	Yeah.
3594360	3598040	I mean, Twitch is seeing the opportunity in it and they have to be snickering in some
3598040	3603600	type of way that even though Mixer is like, you can do all of this and seamlessly integrate
3603600	3604920	to Facebook gaming.
3604920	3610360	There are so many people that are like, you know what, I'd rather just go back to Twitch
3610360	3613260	even though I maybe burned my bridges over there.
3613260	3618320	I'd still rather do that than Facebook gaming, which I obviously I'm thriving on that.
3618320	3619480	It gives me such energy.
3619480	3623480	Um, but yeah, so anyway.
3623480	3627320	Well, good deal for like the folks that did take the money for Mixer because now they're
3627320	3631200	out of their contracts and they still get paid and then they still get to go back to
3631200	3634240	these platforms where they probably still have a lot of followers and stuff.
3634240	3637520	Well and what a stupid decision then that all ended up being, wasn't it?
3637520	3640040	I hope some people are answering for that right now.
3640040	3644160	Um, so for all the credit I've given Phil Spencer over the years, and I think he has
3644160	3648460	driven Microsoft in a much better or Xbox specifically, obviously in a better direction.
3648460	3652680	So for this is quite the blemish.
3652680	3654720	So that's all I have to say on that.
3654720	3655720	All right.
3655720	3656720	Just wait.
3656720	3660240	We're only like months away from hearing Google announced that they're getting rid of Stadia
3660240	3661240	too.
3661240	3662240	All right.
3662240	3663240	Moving on.
3663240	3665440	Do we really think that's going to happen though?
3665440	3666440	Oh yeah.
3666440	3667440	It will definitely happen.
3667440	3673120	That'll be one of those things we put in the time capsule for 2021.
3673120	3674760	Did we even do a time capsule?
3674760	3675760	I don't think we did.
3675760	3676760	Did we?
3676760	3677760	I thought we didn't.
3677760	3678760	Anyway.
3678760	3679760	I don't think I did.
3679760	3680760	Oh well.
3680760	3681760	I have no predictions.
3681840	3685000	Honestly, could anyone have predicted the way this year would go?
3685000	3686000	Maybe it's for the best.
3686000	3687000	We don't have anything.
3687000	3688000	Yeah.
3688000	3689000	What happened to the murder hornets?
3689000	3690000	You know, now we have meth alligators.
3690000	3691600	What happened to the murder hornets?
3691600	3692600	They're on hold.
3692600	3695680	I like how SSJ 100 math says, Oh, don't joke Loki.
3695680	3696680	It's 2020.
3696680	3697680	Yeah.
3697680	3701280	Speaking of it's 2020, I saw a trailer today for a new movie called Greenland talking about
3701280	3703160	like an asteroid hitting earth.
3703160	3706080	I'm like, now's not the time for those types of movies.
3706080	3710000	Really like now's not the time to an earth disaster movie.
3712000	3713000	Sorry.
3713000	3717880	I got sidetracked with something IRL.
3717880	3718880	What were you saying?
3718880	3722120	Oh, I was just saying that, uh, there's this movie Greenland coming out.
3722120	3727040	That's like your typical, uh, Roland Emmert disaster flick or whatever, no asteroids hitting
3727040	3728680	the earth and destroying everything.
3728680	3731880	I was like, no, no, no.
3731880	3736680	You want to know what is crazy is that I've been watching a lot more horror flicks lately.
3737600	3741200	The psychological ones is like, I've watched the witch.
3741200	3744080	I watched, uh, hereditary.
3744080	3746840	I watched Midsommar, which I fucking love that movie.
3746840	3752160	I've I watched, uh, a girl walks alone at night, which is a really good movie too.
3752160	3757120	Just like I even re-watched like the house where evil dwells, which I actually liked
3757120	3758120	that movie too.
3758120	3763960	It's just like the, the scary stuff is preferable to reality.
3763960	3771440	I would rather deal with, uh, you know, Japanese murder ghosts than this bullshit we're living
3771440	3772440	in right now.
3772440	3778720	Um, Phoenix 77 26 in chat says, uh, the murder horn hornets saw the current situation and
3778720	3780200	felt pity on us.
3780200	3784200	L L a S U and her mat says, yeah, we don't need a disaster movie right now.
3784200	3788480	Hype mayhem says my July, 2020 prediction, oblivion gates open up everywhere.
3788480	3793440	Um, yeah, so it's, it's, it's been a year living in a disaster movie.
3793440	3794440	It's been a year.
3794440	3798480	I mean, you know, it's bad when the rest of the world is quarantining against us.
3798480	3802920	Or if Halloween gets canceled, y'all.
3802920	3809280	If Halloween gets canceled, I know, I know, don't, don't buy candy at the store.
3809280	3812360	Let me sit on this one tiny little glimmer.
3812360	3818960	However, however, hopeless of hope that I have that maybe there can be a Halloween anyhow.
3818960	3820880	All right, moving on.
3820880	3822600	Oh, let's talk about crash bandicoot.
3822600	3823640	I guess that's exciting.
3823640	3829960	At least, at least 2020 will give us that finally, a new Chris, no, this looks really
3829960	3830960	cool actually.
3830960	3834080	Now we already talked about this a little bit on last week's show because it spilled
3834080	3838680	early, but we got more details on crash bandicoot for it's about time.
3838680	3843720	Uh, it was confirmed earlier this week by Activision being developed by toys for Bob.
3843720	3850160	Um, it is sporting a new kind of, or kind of like the more HD remake crash style there.
3850800	3855480	But otherwise the classic, uh, behind the back kind of over the shoulder platforming
3855480	3860160	that is going to be in the game, crashes in it, Coco cortex, all that stuff.
3860160	3864420	Cortex has been banished to the past and he's now planning crashes doom.
3864420	3868160	So I like that they're doing this tongue in cheek thing there with this whole it's about
3868160	3871520	time when it's taken so long for there to be a new crash game.
3871520	3874360	It's kind of like they're doing a play on words and it's super cute.
3874360	3882160	Um, so anyhow, uh, they also in the trailer say they've only beaten cortex three times,
3882160	3884360	although they could swear that they were more.
3884360	3887800	And so, um, they just kind of ignored all the other crash games that happened outside
3887800	3888940	the first three.
3888940	3891720	So this is a true crash for games.
3891720	3896080	So now, um, no games made by like traveler's tale or radical entertainment, that stuff
3896080	3897520	I'll count anymore.
3897520	3903520	Anyhow crash four will be coming out October 2nd for PlayStation four and X-Box one, nothing
3903520	3905840	on the switch as of yet.
3905840	3908760	Although I'm pretty sure Activision was asked about that.
3908760	3913240	And they said something like, you know, if the, if the people want it or if the demand
3913240	3917800	is there, probably your typical non-answer answer, meaning it's not being made now, but
3917800	3919480	maybe later type of thing.
3919480	3924200	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly that
3924200	3925200	dark soccer.
3925200	3926200	What's next?
3926200	3931160	Well, um, I'm not super surprised by this at all because I kind of felt it was going
3931160	3935000	to happen the moment Nintendo said they were going to do some mobile games.
3935000	3939040	Um, and yes, uh, pocket camp was fun for a hot minute.
3939040	3944600	Um, but Nintendo is moving away from mobile gaming.
3944600	3953560	Um, they had a really, really disappointing result, um, and they basically just ended it
3953560	3954560	all together.
3954560	3959440	A president, um, Flutakada Shuntada was, um, you know, he was all down for it.
3959440	3963760	He's like, it's going to be a big business, it's going to have growth and now, uh, no.
3963760	3969120	So he basically said we are, and this is a quote, we are not necessarily looking to continue
3969120	3973040	releasing many new applications for the mobile market.
3973040	3982640	And I mean, look at it right now though, um, it's, they've made so much with animal crossing.
3982640	3986160	Um, they have so many other really good games.
3986160	3994240	Um, you know, they have like super Mario run just like shot down the shitter, you know,
3994240	3999600	and on top of that, um, now after he said that statement, Nintendo share did fall about
3999600	4004600	4%, but the writing was on the wall.
4004600	4006600	This is going to happen.
4006600	4013480	Um, and actually as for right now, um, the only things that I see for Nintendo that's
4013480	4017840	making money is still animal crossing pocket camp.
4017840	4022280	Um, Dragalia lost that's way gone down.
4022280	4023680	Super Mario run has gone down.
4023680	4029920	Fire Emblem heroes has gone way down and yeah, animal crossing is still doing pretty good.
4029920	4033020	It's kind of, those rankings are kind of sad cause I actually feel like Dragalia lost,
4033020	4037280	you know, when Nintendo kind of does something new as opposed to animal crossing is a little
4037280	4038280	bit different.
4038280	4042080	I think animal crossing kind of works as the type of game it is, but like it wasn't working
4042080	4046600	when they were trying to turn platformers like super Mario brothers, like dr Mario.
4046600	4050480	Yes, more of a puzzle game, but still kind of action oriented like Mario cart when they
4050480	4053080	try to turn those games to mobile, they just don't work.
4053080	4057520	But the other types of games and the new stuff, like I actually think Dragalia lost is probably
4057520	4059600	one of the stronger titles they put out.
4059600	4062280	And the nice thing about it is it's not tied to any other Nintendo product.
4062280	4065880	And I kind of think that's the direction Nintendo should have thought about staying in.
4065880	4073880	But you know, the only thing that's really, I think, helped with the pocket camp to be
4073880	4080080	honest is people who have forgot to cancel their subscriptions to like the, the leaf
4080080	4082360	ticket service and all of that.
4082360	4087640	I mean, I almost forgot to do it, but you know, once I got my, my goodies from pocket
4087640	4090240	camp, I was like, okay, I'm kind of done with this.
4090240	4092000	It's not really that fun.
4092000	4096560	You know, you can't really, you don't have the same customization.
4096560	4104480	And then you know, on top of that, I think that they've got really big competition in
4104480	4106880	the form of Fortnite.
4106880	4115400	Honor of Kings is way making money in comparison to what the, you know, Nintendo titles are
4115400	4119840	doing as far as the mobile competition.
4120840	4125680	They are, honestly, I think it's, it's wise.
4125680	4128600	I think it's a good thing for them that they're not really pulling a hole out of it.
4128600	4131600	They should keep, you know, support for what they have on there now.
4131600	4135960	You know what I think that would make the money is if they did a specifically mobile
4135960	4139440	ACE attorney game, that would be fun.
4139440	4141040	That would bring them the moolah.
4141040	4145160	Um, but you know, I, I also feel like I was just gonna say, I feel like Nintendo is almost
4145160	4149160	strongest when other people are allowed to develop their IPs on mobile.
4149160	4151400	And obviously what's coming to my mind is Pokemon go.
4151400	4155320	And I realized little different cause Pokemon is the Pokemon company, but it's still kind
4155320	4157880	of all, it's still kind of all wraps up to Nintendo.
4157880	4160560	And I still kind of feel like that's the strongest title.
4160560	4164200	And that was like somebody else's new idea type of thing.
4164200	4167600	And I think that's like by far the strongest title that's out there that involves a Nintendo
4167600	4168640	product.
4168640	4173720	But granted, I know Pokemon is like not really Nintendo, but it is, you know, I mean, I never
4173720	4178640	played that, that, um, uh, Fire Emblem heroes.
4178640	4182520	But what if they did like a Fire Emblem thing kind of like Orna?
4182520	4185000	Oh, uh, cool.
4185000	4186000	Yeah.
4186000	4189640	I mean, I, who knows what else Niantic is working on for the future.
4189640	4191920	There might be other Nintendo related stuff in development.
4191920	4192920	Who knows?
4192920	4196320	Uh, we know content harvest their partnerships.
4196320	4197320	Yeah.
4197320	4203280	Well, anyway, um, we'll see what, uh, doesn't develop from Nintendo on the mobile front,
4203280	4206720	or maybe if they do end up kind of letting go and letting some other people develop for
4206720	4207720	that.
4207720	4208720	Or if they're just like, eh, maybe not.
4208720	4212400	Uh, I would take an old school Final Fantasy style Ornae game.
4212400	4213400	Yeah.
4213400	4214400	Heck yeah.
4214400	4219360	Uh, there is a square game that's out for Apple arcade.
4219360	4222160	So, um, it's not very good.
4222160	4226240	I don't think it is, but I'm just saying, you know, it wouldn't be too hard, but it
4226240	4232040	seems that, that, uh, some of those, uh, other companies are looking more to partner with,
4232040	4234440	uh, you know, the arcade service.
4234440	4235840	All right.
4235840	4240840	Well, uh, Loki, you have a pretty logical followup for this, right?
4240840	4241840	Yeah.
4241840	4248320	So there was a little trailer for a brand new, uh, summer update coming to animal crossing
4248320	4250080	new horizons.
4250080	4255240	And so with this, there's going to be some cool stuff, including, um, diving into the
4255240	4256760	sea and swimming.
4256760	4262160	So now, uh, you can actually go in there and look for treasure and furniture and also new
4262160	4268640	fish in aquatic wildlife that you can then donate to your museum or sell.
4268640	4273880	And then along with that, the return of Pascal and Gulliver, um,
4273880	4278040	Gulliver's already back, but I think we're getting pirate Gulliver.
4278040	4279040	Yes.
4279040	4280040	Pirate Gulliver.
4280040	4283560	And you're able to trade it for a mermaid furniture.
4283560	4290200	Well, hey, I'm excited about Pascal because I ordered a Pascal card and then I actually
4290200	4292760	can use him in the photo thing.
4292760	4293760	Yeah.
4293760	4294760	I'm excited.
4294760	4297000	Pascal is who you trade for the furniture.
4297000	4298000	Yeah.
4298000	4300640	I'm excited to get more content for animal crossing.
4300640	4304160	Cause I feel a little like, okay, I'm a little worn out on what's there.
4304160	4307520	Although, uh, I forgot to mention during my gaming week, the, the bug off happened on
4307520	4308520	Saturday.
4308520	4309520	That was cute.
4309520	4310560	Like that wasn't just a nice little diversion.
4310560	4311560	My birthday happened.
4311560	4312560	Did you get your gold?
4312560	4314400	Uh, no, I didn't play enough.
4314400	4316560	I didn't even get the bronze.
4316560	4317560	What is that?
4317560	4318560	Oh, your town?
4318560	4325200	She's showing, she's showing it on a stream for those are on the podcast, but, uh, but,
4325200	4328440	um, well, one thing I was going to say with, uh, animal crossing.
4328440	4331400	So, um, you may or may not know I had a birthday this past week as well.
4331400	4333640	Cause my birthday's only a few days after OLR.
4333640	4334640	So I happy.
4334640	4335640	Thank you.
4335640	4336880	I got to do my birthday and animal crossing.
4336880	4338320	And that was really cute.
4338320	4343640	Cause it's a whole little like sequence where it's kind of like, like right when you start
4343640	4347320	and you like appear outside your house, your best friend in the town who I assume cause
4347320	4349320	ketchup showed up for me and I love her.
4349320	4352800	So she showed up and she's like, come with me, don't ask questions.
4352800	4354700	And then suddenly I'm in ketchup's house.
4354700	4359080	And then who I believe are my next two best friends on the Island poncho and rocket, because
4359080	4360560	they were my two starters.
4360560	4361560	So I've talked to them every day.
4361560	4364920	So I'm pretty sure they're my closest friends next to ketchup, who I've also been showering
4364920	4365920	and gifts.
4365920	4368680	Um, they all showed up for my party and it was really cute.
4368680	4372680	And then they gave me cupcakes and you go give everybody on the Island a cupcake and
4372680	4374760	they give you something party themed in return.
4374760	4378640	So you get like a party floor and a party wall and all this other stuff.
4378640	4379640	It's cute.
4379640	4382600	That's why I didn't get any of that stuff because I kept my cupcakes.
4382600	4386400	Oh, you're supposed to trade them to the villagers and they give you stuff.
4386400	4391480	If I do it afterwards, it's like, here's a cupcake.
4391480	4394280	Here's a moldy cupcake.
4394280	4395280	I don't want this.
4395280	4396280	This is super old.
4396280	4402320	You know, what's funny is that I got kidnapped by Agnes who I didn't realize she was my bestie,
4402400	4405640	but she kind of is like the kind of person I would hang out with.
4405640	4409360	She's one of the uchi characters, the big sister kind.
4409360	4412840	And so like, okay, Agnes, you're cool.
4412840	4416480	But I guess, you know, I had my whole birthday party on animal crossing with everybody.
4416480	4417480	Yeah.
4417480	4419960	Well, you, you, you were right when the game came out too.
4419960	4423320	So it was kind of, you were one of the first to get a birthday in animal crossing.
4423320	4424640	So a few weeks after.
4424640	4425640	Yeah.
4425640	4426640	Yeah.
4426640	4427640	Yeah.
4427640	4428640	So, um, yeah.
4428640	4430440	Uh, also my least favorite villager left this week.
4430440	4431440	So that was exciting.
4431440	4434400	And now I have, Oh, I can't remember Nana.
4434400	4435680	She's gone.
4435680	4441760	And uh, I can't remember the name of who I got us a replacement, but he, he's a smug
4441760	4442760	type.
4442760	4445640	He's a large bear that is like a Greek God type.
4445640	4448160	Oh, I know who that is.
4448160	4449160	Yeah.
4449160	4450640	I can't remember his name in the moment.
4450640	4451640	Klaus.
4451640	4452640	That's it's Klaus.
4452640	4455560	I know what I called the German bear.
4455560	4456560	Yeah.
4456560	4459360	So I got Roman German bear when I went to the nook Island.
4459480	4463000	And so I was, I knew I was hunting for a smug villager cause it was the one type I didn't
4463000	4464000	have.
4464000	4467320	So when I went nook, I saw like this, this bear is gigantic.
4467320	4471520	I could see him from like when I started the Island, I was like, dang, this bear is big.
4471520	4473920	So yeah, that's why, that's why I took into the town.
4473920	4474920	And then I laughed.
4474920	4477400	Cause he has like a whole like Greek God theme going with him.
4477400	4483680	Do you want me to drop off my binder of animal crossing cards next time you need any villager?
4483680	4484680	Oh yeah.
4484680	4485680	Actually.
4485680	4486680	Yes.
4486680	4489400	Cause uh, I am going to let Alan really wants Gigi.
4489400	4491800	I have the Gigi card.
4491800	4492800	Okay.
4492800	4494160	Well then maybe we can just do it that way.
4494160	4495880	Cause, but, but I love Gigi.
4495880	4499680	I have Gigi and Naomi who are the same type and I kind of prefer Naomi.
4499680	4501600	So I think I have Naomi too.
4501600	4502600	All right.
4502600	4504160	It's turning into an animal crossing podcast.
4504160	4505160	I'm sorry.
4505160	4506760	We can do one anyway.
4506760	4507760	It doesn't matter.
4507760	4508760	I know.
4508760	4509760	We've got it.
4509760	4510760	We've got to get to your classic game though.
4510760	4511760	Cause I know you've got to go soon.
4512760	4518440	I will say, um, uh, animal crossing, even though I'm getting, even though I keep talking
4518440	4522720	about it, I do, I do appreciate that there's new stuff coming to kind of motivate me to
4522720	4524040	keep going with it.
4524040	4526280	And this is coming at a very good time, I think.
4526280	4530560	So, all right, moving on, let's talk quickly about the smash brothers direct that happened
4530560	4531560	this week.
4531560	4534280	So we knew that we were going to be getting a character from arms.
4534280	4539200	Uh, and so we did get announced, uh, the character from arms will be Min Min will be coming over
4539200	4540600	from arms.
4540600	4545680	And uh, so, so unfortunately a lot of people were hoping for twin tell who I guess Shane
4545680	4550720	messaged me and said, I called twin tell twin Tanya, which is a final fantasy 14 boss on
4550720	4554680	the last show and nobody bothered to correct me.
4554680	4559360	I've been playing too much of 14 anyway, twin tell was, it seemed to be a popular choice
4559360	4560360	on Twitter.
4560360	4564300	Uh, but it did end up being Min Min who I think a lot of people, I think people are
4564300	4568040	kind of like, okay, it's kind of like the reaction I'm kind of feeling out there.
4568040	4569040	It's Min Min.
4569040	4570040	Okay.
4570480	4575640	So anyway, um, that is the new character that's coming to smash and they, you know, detailed
4575640	4579720	how it's all going to work and kind of the Springs and all that type of stuff.
4579720	4583240	Now what else was announced during, I mean, we knew we were getting an arms character,
4583240	4585640	but what about some of the stuff we didn't know about?
4585640	4590300	So there were actually some new me fighter costumes that were unveiled and one of them
4590300	4594700	is the fallout boy or not, not like the band fallout boy, but like the little pit boy from
4594700	4600000	fallout is, which is weird because I'm like, is there even a fallout game on switch?
4600040	4602200	Maybe shell, maybe fallout shelters on switch.
4602200	4603480	That's all I can think of.
4603480	4605040	So, um, there's that.
4605040	4606480	I think that's kind of interesting.
4606480	4609400	And then you can get some of the, uh, splatoon characters as well, which I think is really
4609400	4610400	cute.
4610400	4611400	And there's some other stuff too.
4611400	4614680	Uh, 75 cents each for the, those are me fighter costumes.
4614680	4618440	So it's not like an actual character, but you can make your me fighter and look like
4618440	4619440	one.
4619440	4624640	And there's more amiibo coming, including persona fives, joker, and that amiibo looks
4624640	4625640	awesome.
4625640	4627420	Actually, that's coming this fall.
4627420	4630820	And they're also going to be doing the hero from the dragon quest series, who's also added
4630820	4633960	the game previously, uh, both those figures coming out this fall.
4633960	4637940	So yes, amiibo is still a thing if you are wondering.
4637940	4639340	So that was a fun direct.
4639340	4641020	I must admit I didn't watch it live.
4641020	4646140	I just checked out the cliff notes after the fact, cause I don't play smash quite as frequently
4646140	4650520	as I think other people I know, but, um, yeah, I'm excited to, to, I think some of the me
4650520	4652580	characters they're doing are really cute.
4652580	4657700	And uh, I love that this game is still going all this time after it released, uh, poor
4657700	4662220	Sakurai probably needs a fucking nap, but good for him working so hard on this game
4662220	4663220	and everything.
4663220	4664220	So cool.
4664220	4665220	Cool.
4665220	4666220	All right.
4666220	4667220	Moving on.
4667220	4668220	Uh, Dark Sakura.
4668220	4670420	Dark Sakura, you're muted.
4670420	4671420	I think.
4671420	4672420	I'm still muted.
4672420	4673420	Yeah.
4673420	4674420	Sorry.
4674420	4675420	Sorry about it.
4675420	4679140	Um, so to move on to Canada, we don't give Canada enough love.
4679140	4680140	Do we?
4680140	4681140	Love you Canada.
4681140	4682860	You have a right to close your borders.
4682860	4687060	Um, there is the entertainment software association of Canada.
4687060	4688060	Sorry.
4688060	4689060	Quick aside.
4689060	4691660	Just fact though, I was supposed to be in Toronto this weekend.
4691660	4692980	There wasn't even supposed to be a show today.
4692980	4695260	I was supposed to be in Toronto for pride this year.
4695260	4696520	That was the original plan.
4696520	4697520	So frown.
4697520	4698520	Anyway.
4698520	4699520	Sorry Jamie.
4699520	4700520	But that was important.
4700520	4701520	Girl.
4701520	4702520	Okay.
4702520	4703520	Anyway.
4703520	4707180	Um, they, what they do is they, uh, support the growth of Canada's video game industry.
4707180	4713300	So they do research advocacy, um, and promote awareness of issues that affect video gaming
4713300	4715060	and the development thereof.
4715060	4719220	And they also work in talent development and technology skills.
4719220	4724860	Um, and so what they've done, they are hosting the Canadian student video game competition.
4724860	4729300	So they're inviting post-secondary students from across the country to participate, to
4729300	4735460	show their skills and show excellence in three categories, originality slash creativity,
4735460	4739140	artistic expression and technical proficiency.
4739140	4742860	So, um, they are doing it in the form of video games.
4742860	4748740	They want to really promote and cultivate, uh, new, new blood in the industry.
4748740	4756500	So their winning team, um, will, uh, has a cash award of $6,000 Canadian to be put toward
4756500	4760240	new equipment to continue in their education and training.
4760240	4765220	So, uh, it's now in their sixth year, they've received 20 submissions this year.
4765220	4773100	And, uh, like last year, um, we, the looks like the first unit, like, you know, I'm trying
4773100	4778740	to say winner and I'm looking at university was, um, uh, from the school of digital, uh,
4778740	4782100	arts animation and design at the university of Quebec.
4782100	4787340	Um, and then, uh, another one from, it looks like their mathematic I'm translating to the
4787340	4790100	university of Quebec, mathematic information team.
4790100	4792860	And they build a game called cold sun.
4792900	4794420	I'm sure we've seen this around.
4794420	4798300	Haven't you, um, I've been seeing ads for cold sun.
4798300	4802220	And then the second place was a game called wormwood from Sheridan college.
4802220	4808580	And third place was the last frame from, uh, uh, I think it's also university of
4808580	4811620	Quebec, uh, uh, she, she called Timmy.
4811620	4815660	I think is how it's pronounced, but yeah, cold sun is, is this third party stealth
4815660	4822180	game, um, kind of, you know, post POCA, post post-apocalyptic that basically you have
4822180	4824820	to scavenge her resources by using garbage.
4824820	4830900	Um, and then wormwood is a hack and slash and last frame is a cooperative puzzle game.
4830900	4833500	So I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes out of it this year.
4833500	4834500	That'd be really cool.
4834500	4835500	Yeah.
4835500	4837740	Hooray for the future of game developers.
4837740	4838740	Yay, Canada.
4838740	4839740	All right.
4839740	4840740	Yay, Canada.
4840740	4841740	All right.
4841740	4846260	To which, uh, we actually have a chatter in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog
4846260	4851220	network named I am Canadian 47 who just responded with clap emojis.
4851260	4852260	So there you go.
4852260	4853260	Shout out to Canada.
4853260	4856580	Uh, I am Canadian 47 also says pride up here was virtual.
4856580	4857580	So it was quieter.
4857580	4858580	Yeah.
4858580	4859580	They've been doing it.
4859580	4860580	They did like a big virtual pride on Amazon.
4860580	4862860	I think there's like, it's not, it's not quite the same.
4862860	4863860	I don't know.
4863860	4864860	It's just, yeah.
4864860	4869140	I mean, I don't like to go to the one in San Francisco anymore because San Francisco is
4869140	4874920	so packed in like something weird started happening in my thirties and now my forties
4874920	4880140	were like, I suddenly have claustrophobia in certain situations and San Francisco pride
4880140	4883060	like gets that going.
4883060	4887100	Whereas when I was in Chicago, it was fine, but that's because there's, it's so like the
4887100	4889940	route is gigantic and there's so much space.
4889940	4893620	I didn't feel like it's packed in when I was there and I was looking forward to Toronto
4893620	4896820	this year, but we'll just have to make it happen in a future year.
4896820	4898580	For me, San Francisco pride.
4898580	4902860	Um, I much prefer it to the garbage that was Sacramento pride.
4902860	4904620	Um, cause it was garbage.
4904620	4905780	It was really bad.
4905780	4908980	Super hot, overcrowded, not enough water, not enough emergency.
4909020	4913780	Um, I've been to a festival where San Francisco has been run pretty, pretty well.
4913780	4916860	Um, as long as at least I've gone to it.
4916860	4919940	And of course I also have the advantage of marching in it with the sisters.
4919940	4924500	I remember the rainbow festival here, which is labor day weekend beat.
4924500	4929540	Now granted, I haven't been, I haven't been in like eight years because of dragon con.
4929540	4933720	Um, but with the rainbow festival, I always say that was something the bars downtown just
4933720	4935220	kind of did on their own.
4935220	4936220	That's a better time of year.
4936220	4938140	It's not as hot labor day weekend.
4938180	4941580	And honestly though, this past one, I don't know.
4941580	4942580	It seemed pretty tame.
4942580	4948940	The most exciting place that, that I went to was probably what was supposed to be there.
4948940	4953740	You know, their answer to Dory alley, you know, the, the leather place.
4953740	4959620	Um, and I had a good time, um, but it was, it was pretty quiet.
4959620	4963380	I think I went in face come to think of it, or maybe I didn't anyway.
4963380	4964380	All right.
4964380	4965380	It was still fun.
4965380	4966380	Let's move on for time.
4966540	4968580	So Loki, what do you have next for us?
4968580	4970100	All right.
4970100	4973180	So let's talk about more Pokemon announcements.
4973180	4978980	So we've got this brand new game announced by the Pokemon company called Pokemon unite.
4978980	4987020	It's a team-based mobile battle arena game that's created with the company Tencent and
4987020	4991540	it's free to play on the switch and as well as mobile.
4991540	4995420	And I guess it's five on five, um, base or team-based MOBA.
4995460	5001780	So no word on what it's supposed to be coming out, but it looks interesting.
5001780	5004940	I'm not really one to play MOBAs.
5004940	5008140	So it's not something that appeals to me, but I know there are a lot of people that
5008140	5010140	like that kind of stuff.
5010140	5011140	Yeah.
5011140	5014500	I, I, I, I've enjoyed some of the MOBAs I've played.
5014500	5017140	Like I just, there's a lot of toxic people that play them.
5017140	5019420	And so it usually scares me off from them.
5019420	5023220	Probably my best experience was in heroes of the storm, because when you play versus
5023220	5028260	AI, it's a lot less toxic there because all the edge Lords are playing more of the PVP
5028260	5029260	stuff.
5029260	5031740	So that was probably my best experience was playing heroes of the storm.
5031740	5035500	So I know a lot of people were upset about this Pokemon news because I think some people
5035500	5037660	set the bar way too high.
5037660	5042780	Like they were expecting Pokemon let's go for the Sinnoh regions, which, you know, when
5042780	5046780	they've got DLC still happening for the main game is not going to happen anyway.
5046780	5050740	Um, or they were expecting, I don't know, like gen four remix or something, but it's
5050740	5053060	like, you just got new Pokemon snap announced.
5053060	5054940	Like it's not going to exceed that.
5054940	5059540	Um, so some people are disappointed, but I, I, I welcome it.
5059540	5061780	I don't think it's the worst thing they could have announced.
5061780	5064500	Um, I think it could be interesting.
5064500	5065500	Yeah.
5065500	5067340	It's different to be willing to see what it's like.
5067340	5073180	Um, you know, there was the other Pokemon game that they had that was all kind of cubish.
5073180	5075180	Um, that was okay.
5075180	5077580	Um, I don't know.
5077580	5079740	It's nice that they're experimenting with the franchise.
5080180	5085460	Um, I forgot to say during my gaming week, I played that Pokemon cafe came out, um, and
5085460	5086860	I played a little bit of that.
5086860	5087860	It's super cute.
5087860	5089380	Like the art style's great.
5089380	5092420	And, uh, it's, it's kind of a cute way to look at Pokemon.
5092420	5096500	And at first I was kind of, Oh, it is kind of Tsum Tsum, but it's kind of like a puzzler.
5096500	5100700	Like you only have so many swipes to clear the board and it starts to turn into freemium
5100700	5102140	trash real quick.
5102140	5103140	Sorry.
5103140	5108000	But, um, there's, there's a really cute art style there that maybe could be developed
5108000	5112880	into other games or I just wish there was a nonstop mode like Tsum Tsum has, like, I
5112880	5115400	don't know why it needed to be a strictly a puzzler.
5115400	5119420	Um, probably that's how they plan to make money, but maybe when this game kind of fizzles
5119420	5124560	out because it's not very good, um, they'll look at different ways to, um, innovate it
5124560	5129000	and maybe I'll get the, I like how you say that because it's not very good.
5129000	5131360	Well, I'm just, I'm in a mood tonight.
5131360	5134200	I'm just, I'm not making friends tonight.
5134200	5140280	Sadly, I'm a little bit of a cactus tonight.
5140280	5141280	Happy pride.
5141280	5142280	All right.
5142280	5143280	All right.
5143280	5147360	Uh, let's move on and, uh, Oh, I think this one's my story and this is about some anime
5147360	5148360	that's going to be happening.
5148360	5151920	So there was a cyberpunk reveal that happened this week as well.
5151920	5154320	So they were explaining more about that game.
5154320	5161280	And as part of it, there's going to be a collaboration between studio trigger and CD project red
5161280	5168320	and for Netflix in 2022, a new anime series called cyberpunk edge runners will be coming
5168320	5169320	out.
5169320	5173720	And if that didn't have your attention, what if I told you that Akira Yamaoka is doing
5173720	5175400	the music for it?
5175400	5176400	That's pretty cool.
5176400	5177400	Yeah.
5177400	5178400	Right.
5178400	5179400	So I think that's pretty cool.
5179400	5184440	Uh, so the screenplay is being handled by Yoshiki Ussa and Masahiko Otsuka.
5184440	5190160	Uh, and so I think this is a good kind of expand the world of cyberpunk and these anime
5190160	5193720	series on Netflix based on video games have done pretty well.
5193720	5197920	I guess some people could kind of give or take the ingress one, but I guess the Castlevania
5197920	5198920	was pretty good.
5198920	5201360	Uh, and is there one of the ingress one in there?
5201360	5202360	Yeah.
5202360	5205760	Like, well, there's plenty of them, but if the ingress one is, it's kind of plagued
5205760	5211200	by the same problem that ingress has, which is the storylines really convoluted and confusing
5211200	5213920	and the anime plays that game for the story.
5213920	5214920	Give me a break.
5214920	5215920	Exactly.
5215920	5217760	But it's just like anime was really good.
5217760	5218760	Ooh, yeah.
5218760	5225200	And I'm sorry if they should have released this in the US, but the animal crossing anime
5225200	5228400	was really cute and really sweet.
5228400	5230200	Maybe they will.
5230200	5234740	Also announced for anime adaptation in the worlds of video games.
5234740	5235740	This is pretty cool.
5235740	5240080	The world ends with you is going to be getting an anime adaptation.
5240080	5241080	Remember that game?
5241080	5243880	It was just a recently re-released on switch, not that long ago.
5243880	5245360	Anime expo light.
5245360	5247560	We'll be getting more details on that.
5247560	5250720	Basically the real anime expo not happening because of COVID.
5250720	5252280	So they're doing the online deal.
5252280	5256800	So just think this, you would have got to see this in person maybe if COVID hadn't happened,
5256800	5257800	but it did.
5257800	5263400	So anime expo light on Friday, July 3rd, 6 PM Pacific, and then Saturday, July 4th,
5263400	5264400	10 AM.
5264400	5265400	Oh, I'm sorry.
5265400	5266960	That's time zone conversion for Japan.
5266960	5275840	So more information you can check out their website is, Ooh, it's subarashiki-anime.jp.
5275920	5280640	And that's the world ends with you anime, and I'm sure our pals over at anime jam session
5280640	5283240	Tuesday nights hosted here at VOG network.
5283240	5285880	I'm sure they will have plenty more to say on these stories.
5285880	5287720	So check them out Tuesday night.
5287720	5288720	All right.
5288720	5293240	Meanwhile, it's time to get to the classic game of the week and dark soccer.
5293240	5294240	Are you ready for this?
5294240	5295760	I have something very special.
5295760	5301960	So it's time for the classic game of the week and the return of the cute little music that
5301960	5305760	plays in the background, which we haven't had for a long time.
5305760	5309360	And a little, little video flourish for our pals over on Twitch.
5309360	5313160	So every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and she's trying to find a game
5313160	5317360	that, Hey, you brats should check out this game, respect this game.
5317360	5321000	But once a month, dark soccer says, you know what, I'm going to mix it up and pick a pinball
5321000	5322000	game.
5322000	5323560	Uh, and, uh, we're finally getting to June's.
5323560	5326440	There was a lot of other stuff that needed attention this month.
5326440	5330840	So we're, we're, we're getting to June's pinball pick at the end of the month, but that's okay.
5330840	5334560	So dark soccer, what did you pick for the classic pinball of the month?
5334560	5339960	I picked the shadow, terrible movie, really cool game.
5339960	5345200	Um, so, um, it was designed by Brian Eddie.
5345200	5349600	The software was done by Mike Boone, um, artwork by Doug Watson.
5349600	5355080	Um, it's, it's really an interesting, an interesting table.
5355080	5357360	So, um, hold on just a second.
5357360	5360600	Cause I'm trying to actually get the layout of the shadow so I can describe a little bit
5360600	5361600	more.
5361600	5363760	Um, we do see some video footage of it.
5363760	5366440	Sadly, I wasn't able to get around to get any of the music.
5366440	5371600	I couldn't find a clean copy, but we do have the video playing, uh, for our Twitch friends.
5371600	5378440	So one of the very interesting things about it to me is that, um, if you're looking at
5378440	5386160	that there is on the upper left hand side, a, um, like a mini little play field that
5386160	5391680	has, uh, this kind of paddly game on it is just really cool.
5391680	5397600	And that's one of, I think for me, I'd kind of call it the gimmick of the game, but overall
5397600	5399160	it's a really fun one to play.
5399160	5400160	I'm no good at it.
5400160	5401160	I'm just going to tell you this right now.
5401160	5402680	I don't play it that often.
5402680	5408480	Um, and I think we loaned ours out right now, but yeah, it's called the battlefield is that
5408480	5414080	whole section up there and it's got some fun ramp action, you know, and even the theming
5414080	5419600	of it, um, you know, if it wasn't the shadow, just having that whole art deco look to it
5419600	5422080	just really is quite attractive.
5422080	5425520	So it's a really, really pretty, pretty looking one.
5425520	5430600	Um, and yeah, uh, Questbuster also points out that the soundtrack by Goldsmith was great
5430600	5431600	and actually, yeah, it was.
5431600	5432600	I saw this in the theater.
5432600	5437320	Um, but as far as, uh, other things about it, you've got all these different scenes.
5437320	5441880	You have punish the guilty Farley Claymore, duel of wills, which is a video mode, um,
5441880	5447060	brilliant sphere, escape from underwater, escape underwater, doom, and discover hotel
5447060	5448060	monolith.
5448060	5452240	You have, um, the bat, the battlefield, like I was just mentioning, you have shadow multi-ball
5452240	5453240	and con multi-ball.
5453240	5464440	Um, and it actually had Tim Curry in it, Rob, some of the actors, um, recorded new speech
5464440	5465440	for the game.
5465440	5470000	So you had Penelope and Miller, uh, John loan and Tim Curry.
5470000	5475400	So, uh, and then, um, there, though, the, the, the character for the shadow was actually
5475400	5481640	voiced by one of the Williams, uh, midway voice actors, uh, Tim, uh, kids row.
5481640	5486960	Um, and then it was kind of funny because like that whole battlefield thing is kinda,
5486960	5490280	you know, Arkanoid breakout E sorta sorta thing.
5490280	5497880	Um, but at any rate they produced 4,247 units, it was released November, 1994.
5497880	5505840	So right after I graduated high school, um, and, uh, you know, it had the usual, uh, you
5505840	5511040	know, cheeseball catchphrases for marketing, like when the shadow falls, earnings rise
5511040	5513120	and no one can resist the power of the shadow.
5513120	5517480	And then the shadow has the power to cloud men's minds, but the shadow pinball has the
5517480	5521520	power to seize players' imaginations, whatever.
5521560	5525560	Um, you can, uh, get ROMs of it for pen maim.
5525560	5532640	Um, there's of course, you know, you can still kind of get some of the stuff for it.
5532640	5534600	It's really, really fun.
5534600	5536480	There's something, I think a couple of mods for it.
5536480	5539920	I'm not really familiar cause we haven't, I don't think we've really done anything like
5539920	5540920	that.
5540920	5548720	Um, there, uh, I'm trying to see like what the last one, I don't remember what we, what
5548720	5554240	we paid for ours, but they, it's one of the, from what I understand, I don't think you
5554240	5557560	have to pay too much for it, like two grand maybe for a really good one.
5557560	5559880	Um, but yeah, it's a fun one.
5559880	5563800	Um, you know, like I said, terrible movie, excellent machine.
5563800	5564800	I recommend it.
5564800	5566800	We have one ourselves.
5566800	5568480	Like I said, we loaned it out.
5568480	5573640	Um, one of Dan's buddies was streaming it not too long ago and that was our table.
5573680	5579960	You know, sometimes, um, bad movies become okay games or even better pinball tables,
5579960	5581760	you know, it can happen sometimes.
5581760	5583760	So it's pretty cool.
5583760	5590800	But you know, it's, I think my favorite thing about it is just that whole, you know, pseudo
5590800	5591800	art deco style.
5591800	5593560	I just think it's really, really cool looking.
5593560	5594560	All right.
5594560	5598800	I know they definitely had good style, even if poor execution.
5598800	5601880	There it is your classic pinball table of the month, the shadow.
5601880	5602880	Good pick.
5603120	5604120	Yep.
5604120	5605120	All right.
5605120	5610240	Happy to happy to be of service and yeah, now I'm like way, not way past where I need
5610240	5611240	to be.
5611240	5612240	All right.
5612240	5613800	So sadly, blah, blah, blah.
5613800	5614800	Yep.
5614800	5616440	Sadly, I think we have to say goodnight to dark Sakura.
5616440	5619160	Uh, but any, uh, thanks for being here as always.
5619160	5620160	Happy 18th.
5620160	5622760	Um, and any parting words for us tonight?
5622760	5623760	Right.
5623760	5624760	Yeah.
5624760	5628760	And go to adult jail.
5629640	5636640	Well, I don't know, but I, I'm, I'm really flattered that everyone liked, um, like the
5636640	5641720	theme and likes the artwork and, uh, there'll be other versions of the artwork, Rob, like
5641720	5642720	we've discussed.
5642720	5647120	So you'll see, you'll see more come of it and you know, I kind of gave everyone, we
5647120	5656600	gave them a bit of a preview cause our little icons on, uh, on discord, uh, for a video
5656600	5660360	that's, uh, that's part of it and the ferrets in there.
5660360	5665160	So you didn't have, you know, when I showed Alan, you know, speaking of like all the little
5665160	5668920	in jokes, which I hope you guys have fun looking at the different in jokes, but when I showed
5668920	5670800	Alan, do you know what he said?
5670800	5674400	What he said, where's president cat?
5674400	5676960	I didn't think of that.
5676960	5678640	Yeah, no, it's, and it's fine.
5678640	5679640	It's fine.
5679640	5683440	I don't, I don't want to like when you do such great art, I don't want to be like, but
5683440	5685040	what about this one thing you forgot?
5685040	5689760	No, it's, it's still great, but yeah, it was just funny specifically for Loki.
5689760	5691520	Did you notice what it was?
5691520	5696440	I don't know if Loki seemed like the final final version really briefly when I was on
5696440	5700080	the screen, but I wasn't paying to tingle holding broccoli.
5700080	5701080	Yeah.
5701080	5702500	There's tingles holding broccoli.
5702500	5703500	It's cute.
5703500	5708080	So we have the reference to the broccoli farm and there's like plugs for two yyr games in
5708080	5709080	there.
5709080	5712080	So I'll tell you what.
5712120	5719360	If someone would message me the two yyr plugs, which should be fairly fucking easy.
5719360	5720360	Yeah.
5720360	5723960	Um, maybe I will give you your own special version of the artwork.
5723960	5724960	Oh, fun.
5724960	5725960	All right.
5725960	5726960	Yeah.
5726960	5727960	All right.
5727960	5728960	Well thank you.
5728960	5729960	Dark Sakura.
5729960	5731640	We'll see you next time here on OLR.
5731640	5734520	And by the way, everyone look up at my camera.
5734520	5735520	Okay.
5735520	5739280	But the, the folks on podcast going to announce it.
5739280	5740280	Okay.
5740280	5741280	Wear your mask.
5741280	5742280	Hold on.
5742280	5743280	Happy pride.
5743280	5744280	Yeah.
5744280	5745280	And happy pride.
5745280	5746280	Oh, I don't know.
5746280	5747280	I don't.
5747280	5755160	I'm going to be muffled now cause I'm wearing a mask and I don't know if Jamie can see it,
5755160	5760280	but as that as that gave me these wonderful rainbow glitter masks.
5760280	5762280	I see it.
5762280	5763520	Yes.
5763520	5768680	So I'm, I'm Katana and Molina's gay brother right now.
5768680	5776120	I just have plain black ones, but I ordered, um, was it, uh, they were, they were doing
5776120	5781760	some promotion on Twitter and I think a gearbox was for Borderlands where they were offering
5781760	5784280	a psycho face mask.
5784280	5785880	So I got a set of those.
5785880	5786880	Nice.
5786880	5790280	I did get two masks when my friend Nikki came back from Thailand.
5790280	5795040	Um, one of them is red with cats all over it and then another one is a Doraemon one,
5795040	5796040	but it's upside down.
5796040	5797040	So, yeah.
5797040	5801760	But one of my sister friends is making me masks on the fabric that I have had forever.
5801760	5803360	So I'll show you those when I get them.
5803360	5806680	I think we have two of the rainbow masks and I think Alan just went to the store.
5806680	5809920	I know he went to the store cause that was what was the side conversation that distracted
5809920	5810920	me earlier.
5810920	5813600	Um, and I think he wore his rainbow mask out.
5813600	5819700	So I think he's just daring one of our bitch neighbors to say something on pride weekend
5819700	5821840	about his rainbow glitter mask.
5821840	5828480	I'm still tempted to put, to put out a pride flag for the fourth or a black lives matter
5828480	5829480	flag.
5829480	5834400	I'd have to get it past the hubby or get the, get the modern pride flag with the, uh, with
5834400	5835400	the, um, Chevron.
5835400	5839800	They call that a little, I want to, but, um, other than that, I don't want to put a flag
5839800	5840800	out.
5840800	5841800	So just saying.
5841800	5842800	All right.
5842800	5843800	Uh, we're gonna move on with the show.
5843800	5844800	Bye dark soccer.
5844800	5845800	Thanks for being here.
5845800	5846800	Okay.
5846800	5847800	Bye.
5847800	5849920	Let's talk about some rapid fire news.
5849920	5853640	We're going to go to Loki for some rapid fire news.
5853640	5857840	You know, I, I'm very disappointed with my social media following that I was not made
5857840	5861300	aware of this until several days after the official announcement.
5861300	5866720	So just to let everybody else know, that's not in the know, uh, earth defense for six
5866720	5868880	was announced, uh, coming in 2021.
5868880	5873880	Now that was just a teaser bit that was at the end of the actual announcement trailer
5873880	5879080	for a different game, which is a little odd, but it was called earth defense force.
5879080	5889360	Uh, world brothers, and it is a kind of a voxel Lee looking, uh, earth defense force
5889360	5890360	game.
5890360	5894120	That's going to be out on the switch and on PlayStation four.
5894120	5899280	It looks like a mashup between, you know, like, uh, Minecraft and earth defense force.
5899280	5903600	So I'm not sure what you do as far as like being able to build anything in the game,
5903600	5905520	but neat.
5905520	5910980	And I will definitely play it because it is, uh, something that appeals to, uh, both games
5910980	5912280	that I love dearly.
5912280	5917020	Um, so yeah, so those will be coming soon.
5917020	5924360	And then, uh, for July's Xbox, uh, live games of gold, we're gonna be getting, uh, WRC eight
5924360	5928760	FIA world rally championship and dunk Lords.
5928760	5930760	Those are both on Xbox one.
5930760	5931760	Then your Xbox.
5931760	5932760	I'm sorry.
5932760	5935160	Is that a game called dunk Lords?
5935160	5936160	Dunk Lords.
5936160	5937160	Yeah.
5937160	5938160	Is that like Dunkaroos?
5938160	5939160	What, what is, is that back?
5939160	5940160	What's that basketball?
5940160	5941160	Like dunk.
5941160	5942160	It's like a basketball type.
5942160	5943160	Okay.
5943160	5944160	Okay.
5944160	5945160	It's basketball.
5945160	5946160	Okay.
5946160	5947160	Yeah.
5947160	5948160	So it is a pretty cool.
5948160	5949160	And then you don't just dunk.
5949160	5950160	You dunk Lords.
5950160	5951160	Forget it.
5951160	5952160	Doesn't deserve it.
5952160	5953160	Of course.
5953160	5957720	One of my favorite Xbox three 60 games, saints row two, uh, and then also a game called juju.
5957720	5960080	That's going to be out later in the month.
5960080	5962440	Oh, juju B should totally win all stars five.
5962440	5963440	What?
5963440	5964440	Okay.
5964440	5965440	All right.
5965440	5966440	Moving on.
5966440	5967440	All right.
5967440	5969440	I have some rapid fire news as well.
5969440	5973960	Uh, let's talk about a sequel for blood stained curse of the moon.
5973960	5974960	Please note.
5974960	5977200	This is not the main blood stained game.
5977200	5980680	I mean, I would think that game's probably going to get a sequel at some point, but they
5980680	5982160	haven't confirmed anything with that.
5982160	5986780	However, that eight bit retro kind of thing that proceeded pretty good.
5986780	5987780	That was pretty good.
5987780	5988780	It was curse of the moon.
5988780	5991040	There is going to be a curse of the moon too.
5991040	5992400	Um, so that's pretty cool.
5992400	5997120	So you will play as Zangetsu, who is the swordsman who I believe you meet in the story
5997120	5998120	of the original.
5998120	6003840	So, um, if you've played the actual bloodstain game, you've already seen Zangetsu, um, but
6003840	6007100	there's a whole new cast of characters in the game that are end up in the playable roster
6007100	6008100	and so forth.
6008100	6014480	Um, no date yet on that, but we do know it's steam, Xbox one, PlayStation four and switch.
6014480	6015480	So pretty much everywhere.
6015480	6016960	Uh, so check that out.
6016960	6021800	That is the sequel to curse of the moon and which I think this is really funny.
6021840	6027400	There's a new game coming out called shakedown Hawaii, which is kind of a 16 bit retro action
6027400	6028400	game.
6028400	6031760	And this game is so retro, how retro is it?
6031760	6037320	It's coming out for the Wii and the Wii U that's, that's, that's not a typo or miss.
6037320	6039480	It's coming out for the Wii and the Wii U.
6039480	6040760	It's a port there.
6040760	6044520	So they, it's, it's out on like all the other platforms right now.
6044520	6049420	And the guy that made this one before he did, uh, try to think of the other one was called,
6049420	6054260	he did, he's done several like grand theft audit, like retro grand theft auto type games.
6054260	6056500	The first one I did was kind of an NES based one.
6056500	6057900	This one's SNES.
6057900	6062660	Um, great game actually, but it's cool to see that he's supporting those other systems
6062660	6064500	because he'd actually done that before too.
6064500	6069140	I think with like even in the PSP last time he put out a game as well.
6069140	6071180	So um, cool.
6071180	6073780	There's not a lot, well actually I wouldn't say there's not a lot of games coming out
6073780	6077620	on the Wii, but we had an announcement of another Wii game like not too long ago either.
6077620	6083180	So what the reality is, there's still millions of those machines out there and they still
6083180	6084180	work.
6084180	6085620	So why not?
6085620	6088700	Now this is very much a collector's thing and I think they even said it's only going
6088700	6092000	to be, it's going to be limited to 3000 copies for this Wii version.
6092000	6094440	So it's not something he's looking to mass produce.
6094440	6099180	This is very much a niche collectors type of thing that he's doing.
6099180	6101620	Um, and that's, you know, that's what it's for.
6101620	6105500	It's going to be 30 bucks too, which is more of a collector's price for a game like that.
6105500	6107660	But I'm sure there will be people that will be all about it.
6107660	6108660	So why not?
6108660	6109660	I think it's neat.
6109660	6110660	I think it's neat.
6110660	6111660	It's a good game.
6111660	6115100	I have it on Epic Game Store and it's pretty awesome.
6115100	6116100	Awesome.
6116100	6117100	All right.
6117100	6121420	Well, let's move on and let's get into some world release dates and check out some other
6121420	6123580	games that are coming out this week.
6123580	6125260	Maybe on the more modern systems.
6125260	6126260	Loki.
6126260	6127260	Yes.
6127260	6133020	So we've got a game called Brigadine, the Legend of Runeseria and that's coming out
6133020	6134780	on Nintendo Switch.
6134780	6136820	Color Cross Malice.
6136820	6138740	That's on Nintendo Switch.
6138740	6142940	We have a Death Come True, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android.
6142940	6148660	Mr. Driller Drill Land on PC and Nintendo Switch.
6148660	6154300	Blaster Master Zero and Blaster Master Zero 2 both coming to PlayStation 4.
6154300	6159300	The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel 3 on Nintendo Switch.
6159300	6162920	Little Town Hero on PC.
6162920	6167960	Track Mania on PC, which I'm assuming is the brand new version, not the older Track
6167960	6169520	Mania game.
6169520	6175080	And last but not least, coming to PlayStation VR, Marvel's Iron Man VR.
6175080	6178320	My son will be overly joyed with that.
6178320	6180440	All right.
6180440	6183700	Well traveling to Japan and checking out the release dates over there.
6183700	6187720	We have a few things on the Nintendo Switch this week, including Catherine Full Body for
6187720	6190440	Nintendo Switch is out this week on the second.
6190440	6195420	And probably one of the best titles, game title names you'll ever have on the Switch.
6195420	6202800	We have Wolf Meow Animal Hospital, an important, an important job to help pets.
6202800	6205280	It is an important job to help pets.
6205280	6206280	But I just love that name.
6206280	6207960	It's Wolf Meow Animal Hospital.
6207960	6210240	The songs that they make.
6210240	6214240	What do we, what do we, what do we call, what do we call the animal hospital in our game?
6214240	6215240	Quick.
6215240	6216240	Somebody give us a name to call this.
6216240	6217240	Oh, Wolf Meow.
6217240	6218240	Thank you.
6218240	6219240	Yes.
6219240	6220240	Yes, Mr. Smoosh.
6221040	6222040	Now Wolf.
6222040	6225240	Anyway, actually the cover looks really cute.
6225240	6226240	I got to say this.
6226240	6228560	The game looks adorable.
6228560	6233400	Like I doubt it's getting a regional release here in the US, but like in Japan, if you
6233400	6237000	had like kids that wanted to be like a veterinarian when they grow up or something, this would
6237000	6238300	be like the perfect game for them.
6238300	6239960	It looks really cute.
6239960	6245600	Like you're actually like checking the temperature on the dog and giving a little bit of medicine
6245600	6248800	and inspecting the cat's eyes and doing all sorts of things.
6248800	6249800	It looks really cute.
6250360	6256480	So with as much like kind of crap I'm giving the game, I think it actually looks cute.
6256480	6260640	On the PlayStation 4, a little quieter this week, I guess nobody wanted to compete with
6260640	6266480	Wolf Meow, but you do have Marvel's Iron Man VR is also out in Japan.
6266480	6269120	I think that's like a worldwide release when that game hits.
6269120	6271920	How about the UK, Loki?
6271920	6278000	The UK, we've got Down the Rabbit Hole on PlayStation 4, Gun Club VR on PlayStation
6278000	6280280	4, I'm assuming PlayStation VR.
6280280	6284680	Big Pharma special edition on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
6284680	6288200	No, fuck Big Pharma.
6288200	6289200	Evil bastards.
6289200	6290200	All right.
6290200	6298040	The Wonderful 101 remastered on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, Iron Man VR as well
6298040	6304500	on PlayStation VR, Azure Striker Gunvolt Striker Pack on PlayStation 4.
6304500	6305500	And that's it.
6306020	6310860	Sorry, just the whole Big Pharma, like, you know how we do those little parody intros
6310860	6313700	on Twitch that inspired from you can't do that on television.
6313700	6319300	I think we had one like a year ago that was Wizards Unite against Big Pharma.
6319300	6323140	And it was a picture of that guy, that fucking asshole guy that bought the company and then
6323140	6324620	jacked up the meds.
6324620	6326980	That's all I can think of when you say Big Pharma.
6326980	6331100	It's funny that you say that because here's the summary of the title.
6331100	6334580	What if you have the power to rid the world of disease, to improve the lives of millions
6334660	6338860	to ease suffering and cure the sick, and earn a tidy profit?
6338860	6339860	Wow.
6339860	6343860	That's what you do.
6343860	6346460	I don't know how I feel about this game.
6346460	6347460	Wow.
6347460	6349460	All right.
6349460	6350460	Anyway.
6350460	6351460	Wow.
6351460	6356860	So combine that with Woof Meow Animal Hospital and you've got some worldwide drug treatment
6356860	6357860	this week.
6357860	6358860	All right.
6358860	6361660	Anyway, let's move on and we're going to get to the mailbag every week.
6361740	6367460	You guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of our favorite emails here
6367460	6369140	on the show.
6369140	6371660	And we actually have a few of them to get through here.
6371660	6374580	So let me make sure I get to them all.
6374580	6379660	And we're going to start tonight with our first email from YYR, who said, hello, LR.
6379660	6383180	Rob, I was thrilled that you mentioned Rocky's Boots last week.
6383180	6384420	Well, I was thrilled to bring it up.
6384420	6385420	I love that game.
6385420	6388620	I didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted with that game when I was little because I
6388620	6389620	never owned it myself.
6390140	6393180	But I remember how much fun I had with it in the short time that I played it.
6393180	6397460	I wonder if it'd be worth finding again for when my daughter is old enough to try it.
6397460	6398820	You probably wouldn't have to look that hard.
6398820	6403180	I'm almost positive it's on that archive website, you know, the library archive that has all
6403180	6404180	the old games.
6404180	6405540	I'm almost positive it's there.
6405540	6408460	Although I did hear, we didn't get into it on tonight's show, but I did hear there's
6408460	6412900	some type of lawsuit coming up against that archive and it might threaten its existence
6412900	6416220	because I don't think it's specifically the video game part of it, but I think there's
6416220	6419980	other stuff that they're archiving that copyright holders are taking issue with.
6419980	6425220	I think it's the books or something because it's bypassing some sort of like loaning.
6425220	6429460	I don't remember what the issue is, but it's book publishers that are having some problems
6429460	6430460	with it.
6430460	6431460	Yeah, you're right.
6431460	6435220	It is the book publishers, but that could trickle down and have an effect on the game
6435220	6436220	part of it.
6436220	6440620	Regardless, it's the internet, and if you really wanted to find a Commodore 64 and Apple
6440620	6445340	2 ROM, it's not that hard to do, so just putting that out there.
6445460	6447860	Anyway, YYRContinues in the email.
6447860	6452100	I did want to mention that it wasn't actually published by MECC.
6452100	6457060	It was actually a product of The Learning Company, but MECC had so much great output
6457060	6461580	as well, including Odell Lake, Number Munchers, and of course, The Oregon Trail.
6461580	6462580	You know what?
6462580	6466500	And I always got The Learning Company and MECC confused, so I'm not particularly...
6466500	6467500	And you know what?
6467500	6471180	A lot of those Apple 2 games were hard to distinguish from one another, so I think if
6471180	6475580	it was an edutainment game that existed, I kind of just defaulted it to MECC, but I
6475580	6476580	appreciate the clarification.
6476580	6477580	You're absolutely right.
6477580	6480100	Let's give credit where credit is due.
6480100	6482580	Never mind that, though, says YYR.
6482580	6485220	The most important part of this email is what I attached.
6485220	6490100	When I was in high school, I knew a guy who was part of a punk ska band called Fix.
6490100	6493540	The band wasn't around for very long, but one of its songs was dedicated to Rocky's
6493540	6494860	Boots the Game.
6494860	6497260	It is awesome, and I hope you can play it on air.
6497260	6500080	I'm very sorry, YYR.
6500120	6504120	You picked the worst night to send me an audio clip 30 minutes before the show, because I
6504120	6505620	was literally...
6505620	6512040	Like the smush clip that y'all saw on Twitch was done like minutes before we were on air,
6512040	6513640	so it was just a bad night for that.
6513640	6514640	I'm sorry, buddy.
6514640	6517740	But I think he says he'll put it in Discord, and that's great.
6517740	6520640	I did listen to it, and it did rock.
6520640	6523160	Anyway, it is awesome, and I hope you can play it on air.
6523160	6525720	I scoured the internet, and I couldn't find any trace of it.
6525720	6529920	Shazam had no clue what it was, and the band broke up over 20 years ago.
6529920	6531800	So I'm pretty sure you're in the clear.
6531800	6534800	But if you can't play it after all, I'll stick it in the VoG Discord.
6534800	6537540	Anyway, thanks for the show, and have a great week.
6537540	6540160	Stay healthy, happy, and sane, Aaron, or YYR.
6540160	6543880	Oh, I didn't even think about the fact that technically I'm not supposed to play copyright
6543880	6547400	music, but it was just a little clip, and I'm sure, like you said, it would have been
6547400	6548400	fine.
6548400	6550440	But sadly, it was like the worst night to send me a clip.
6550440	6551440	I'm sorry.
6551440	6552680	But put it in Discord, because it's funny.
6552680	6557600	And I love songs based off games.
6557600	6558600	So yeah.
6559280	6560480	All right.
6560480	6562760	Let's get to some more emails.
6562760	6564280	FrodoSwagons is next.
6564280	6569560	Hey all, I already brought this up in chat, but was wondering if you had any thoughts.
6569560	6571960	Not sure if you know who this is.
6571960	6580760	Doctor Disrespect is an insanely popular streamer, got permanently banned off of Twitch, and
6580760	6582640	just sort of disappeared.
6582640	6584840	Everyone is super confused as to what happened.
6584840	6587040	Twitch won't say why, and neither will the doctor.
6587080	6592720	Apparently, he brought up conspiracy theorist David Icky on stream shortly after he read
6592720	6595600	something on his phone and got emotional, and his stream ended.
6595600	6598960	I just find it odd that no one knows anything or won't speak up.
6598960	6604760	No idea what David would do with violation Twitch policies, but that's what some people
6604760	6605760	think.
6605760	6607120	No worries if you haven't heard of it.
6607120	6611160	Yes, I've heard of it, because I'm going to be honest, and I'm sorry if you're a fan.
6611160	6614400	I'm not directing anger at you, but I don't get why this guy is famous.
6614400	6616600	I don't get it.
6616600	6619920	And I kind of thought he would have got banned after he took the camera into the bathroom
6619920	6623080	at E3, because that wasn't funny.
6623080	6630880	I kind of feel like this whole Disrespect, Edgelord, I kind of think that stuff was the
6630880	6633320	attitude we're trying to get away from in games.
6633320	6639320	And look, I'm not going to shit on those of you that enjoy it, because I still laugh at
6639320	6640800	South Park once in a while.
6640800	6641800	I get it.
6641800	6648160	There's a time and a place for bathroom humor, but I don't get this guy, and I don't get
6648160	6649800	why he had all this fame.
6649800	6655100	So yes, I did hear about that it happened, and I don't know the reason why either.
6655100	6659360	We here at OLR do not have any extra information, I'm sorry to say.
6659360	6663120	And if he's not saying anything and Twitch isn't saying anything, the reality is we're
6663120	6665340	probably never going to know what happened.
6665340	6667000	He might write a tell-all book.
6667000	6669680	I imagine that's where something like this goes.
6669680	6672160	So maybe you'll find out at that point.
6672160	6678860	But nobody really owes anybody an explanation, so that part's kind of difficult as well.
6678860	6682360	So yeah, I don't know what else to add to that.
6682360	6683700	I don't know.
6683700	6687960	My coworker is a big fan of his, and I tried watching some of his stuff.
6687960	6692240	And I get the appeal because the character was kind of funny, but then there was a lot
6692240	6698360	of stuff recently that he's done that's just weird, and just spreading conspiracy theories
6698360	6699360	and stuff like that.
6699360	6703520	And I don't understand where there's a place for that.
6703520	6706920	And then, of course, there's the personal drama they went through, and then the drama
6706920	6707920	at E3.
6707920	6712240	And I think what Twitch is trying to do right now is get away from all the drama, and there's
6712240	6719320	been a lot of bans with folks that have been accused of different misconduct stuff.
6719320	6723720	So I don't know if it's just because of all the other things.
6723720	6726540	Who knows what the specific thing is this time.
6726540	6729660	And there's also, on the flip side of that, there's a lot of people that probably should
6729660	6733340	have been banned, and haven't been banned.
6733340	6741100	I don't really care about the drama because I'm here for the games, so it's unfortunate
6741100	6746580	if you're a fan of his, and he's off the air, and you'll just have to wait for him to say
6746580	6752020	what the reason is behind it, and hey, I hear that Facebook Gaming's looking for some brand
6752020	6754780	new faces for their platform, so you know.
6754780	6755780	Perfect.
6756020	6759660	But he couldn't go by, he'd have to use his real name on Facebook Gaming.
6759660	6760660	Perfect.
6760660	6762180	Put that over there.
6762180	6763180	Perfect.
6763180	6766180	There's so much drama out there, and I get it that we're all bored at home and stuff
6766180	6774980	like that, but I just, you know, the character's fine, and it's just all the other drama that's
6774980	6778620	around with it that I just don't really care for it.
6778620	6785400	I've got a limited amount of time in my day, and I'd rather watch someone that's more entertaining.
6785400	6792880	There are hundreds of other streamers, thousands of other streamers that can fill time, and
6792880	6800440	I'm sure you will enjoy watching as much as you enjoyed this guy, but I was not a fan,
6800440	6804560	so I just, okay, he's gone.
6804560	6805560	Cool.
6805560	6806560	All right.
6806560	6807560	Anyway, sorry.
6807560	6808560	I'm such a dick tonight.
6808560	6809560	I'm sorry, guys.
6809560	6810920	Like, it's supposed to be a happy night.
6810920	6813480	We're turning 18, but oh well.
6813480	6814480	All right.
6814560	6817040	Anyway, let's get to our next email, which is from Brad.
6817040	6822320	I appreciate the question that you asked us, and again, I'm not trying to be a jerk to
6822320	6823320	you.
6823320	6825040	Everybody likes what they like, whatever.
6825040	6829040	I just never understood why this guy was popular, but maybe I'm just old.
6829040	6832480	Maybe one of those people's like, I don't understand why the kids today listen to this
6832480	6833480	rock music.
6833480	6835720	It's just, maybe I'm hitting that point in my life.
6835720	6836720	I don't know.
6836720	6840800	Anyway, moving on to our next email, last email from Brad.
6840840	6846160	I believe this is our buddy Brad from PodCulture, who says, congrats on hitting 18, y'all.
6846160	6847560	This is one hell of a milestone.
6847560	6850440	You guys have been a part of my Sunday nights for so many years now.
6850440	6854560	I can't count the number of games and hours of fun that I've had because of something
6854560	6856240	I've heard about on your show.
6856240	6860360	You guys were the key inspiration for doing my own show with friends, and it was a huge
6860360	6863840	honor to have been asked for that same show to be a part of VOG.
6863840	6867940	Had it not been for the family that has grown around your show and Bobby's, certain dark
6867940	6871160	times in my life would have been a lot darker and probably would have not have turned out
6871160	6873960	as positive as they did, and I'm still humbled by that.
6873960	6874960	Thank you.
6874960	6878200	It is great having y'all around as part of my Sunday night routine.
6878200	6881540	Here is looking forward to another 18 or more.
6881540	6882540	Peace Brad.
6882540	6889840	Well, if we go for 18 more years, I'll be 60 years old, so that'll be something.
6889840	6891780	But thank you for those kind words.
6891780	6892780	I'm glad we could help.
6892780	6898220	I'm glad you're part of the family, and I welcome everybody that is here to treat others
6898220	6904220	with respect and just have fun, kind of like what Loki said, honestly.
6904220	6908160	Just have fun playing games and leave the drama.
6908160	6912940	I'm not into, and Bobby said it in chat too, and I remember a day at a time when fighting
6912940	6918840	with other streamers and other broadcasters and stuff was funny, and it's not funny.
6918840	6921020	We need to be lifting each other up because you know what?
6921220	6925760	Do you know how often podcasters are the butt of jokes in this day and age and all that stuff?
6925760	6930520	It's like, we need to be working together to get past some of that crap and not bringing
6930520	6931520	each other down.
6931520	6932840	So that's that.
6932840	6933840	All right.
6933840	6936920	Anyway, moving on.
6936920	6938080	That's it for emails.
6938080	6940480	We encourage more emails in future weeks.
6940480	6943400	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.
6943400	6946200	Again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
6946200	6949200	Meanwhile, we have a few more stories for you.
6949200	6950200	Loki.
6950740	6952140	All right.
6952140	6957300	So speaking of, we were talking a little bit about Facebook gaming earlier, well, another
6957300	6963620	portion of Facebook is dedicated to Oculus, and Oculus has decided that they're going
6963620	6973740	to be discontinuing the Oculus Go, which was their first foray to the wireless self-contained
6973740	6974740	VR platforms.
6974740	6979140	Of course, now you may remember they have the Oculus Quest, which is just better all
6979140	6980320	around.
6980320	6985280	And so unfortunately, they said they will, it'll still receive security packages and
6985280	6990540	bug fixes through 2022, but they're not shipping any new features starting now.
6990540	6994440	And they will update the storefront after December 18th of this year.
6994440	6999400	Isn't this kind of just like a logical thing like, oh, we're not selling Windows 7 anymore
6999400	7003520	because now there's Windows 10 and we'll support Windows 7 for a little bit, but it's someday
7003520	7005400	we're going to pull the plug on that.
7005400	7006400	It's just that kind of thing.
7006860	7012580	There's now this unit that does essentially the same thing.
7012580	7015660	So go get that one.
7015660	7016660	Pretty much.
7016660	7017660	Yeah.
7017660	7018660	And I mean, it makes sense.
7018660	7022940	There's more, there's better hardware, more features that are in the Oculus Quest.
7022940	7026980	It's just harder to probably support this older system when they're trying to push people
7026980	7029220	to a better platform.
7029220	7034640	So I mean, that's tech for you.
7034660	7038000	You know what Facebook should do with Oculus though?
7038000	7041060	They should sell it to somebody else and not have it anymore.
7041060	7044220	And this is not me being one of those, why did Facebook buy Oculus?
7044220	7046460	I completely understand why Facebook bought Oculus.
7046460	7050340	I just say, again, Facebook, Facebook needs less, not more.
7050340	7055100	And I don't, if certain things are to, you know, that maybe they are going to look at
7055100	7058860	antitrust stuff on Facebook, I bet Facebook will be under pressure to unload.
7058860	7061980	I don't know if Oculus would be one of the things, but I bet Instagram, because remember
7061980	7064180	when they bought Instagram, that was a huge deal too.
7064240	7067320	I bet they would be under a lot of pressure to unload Instagram.
7067320	7069240	So we'll see how that goes.
7069240	7070240	Anyway, sorry.
7070240	7072760	That's me being an old bitchy man again.
7072760	7076180	But and no shade on Oculus.
7076180	7077840	I'm glad it exists and so forth.
7077840	7079440	I just don't like their owners.
7079440	7081320	All right.
7081320	7082320	Let's move on.
7082320	7083840	Hey, this is some good news.
7083840	7085560	I have no complaints about this.
7085560	7086960	This is a great story.
7086960	7093160	It's a Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for one was a underrated gem on the GameCube because
7093420	7097660	so few people actually bothered to hook up the Game Boy advances and play it all that
7097660	7098660	way.
7098660	7101560	But those that did do it have fond memories of doing so.
7101560	7104980	So it's pretty exciting that it's going to get a second life on the Switch.
7104980	7110960	And what I think is awesome, it was just announced that when the game launches on August 27th,
7110960	7115640	there will be a free demo available for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
7115640	7118820	It will have three free dungeons as a part of the demo.
7118820	7120660	So you can just try that out.
7120660	7128600	But if you team up with somebody that has the full game, you can actually go to 13 dungeons
7128600	7130660	without having to buy anything extra.
7130660	7134760	So it opens up a lot more to explore in the demo version.
7134760	7139700	So it's an interesting kind of compromise between having everything and having just
7139700	7140700	a little bit.
7140700	7143720	It's like, oh, you get a little more if a friend has the game.
7143720	7150400	And that definitely like throws back to like the DS era, which again, I know this is more
7150400	7154140	like a GameCube Game Boy Advance thing, but the DS wasn't far behind.
7154140	7158500	And remember when we could like beam demos of games or like one person has the DS game
7158500	7161920	and they could beam it to others and everybody could kind of connect that way.
7161920	7167740	So it kind of like had the window for the Wii and the DS Crystal Chronicles.
7167740	7169860	Yeah.
7169860	7170860	Did they?
7170860	7173600	I thought they like announced it, but it never went anywhere.
7173600	7174600	I'm sorry.
7174600	7175600	It was chock chock.
7175600	7176600	Well, mystery dungeon.
7176600	7177600	Yeah.
7177600	7178600	Same concept where they had it.
7178600	7179600	Yes, that's right.
7179900	7181900	So, uh, yeah.
7181900	7186180	And, uh, Orange Right says it's too bad download play isn't built into the Switch, but isn't
7186180	7188900	it interesting how we're seeing games kind of use it anyway?
7188900	7191820	Because Clubhouse Games is another one that's doing this.
7191820	7196180	And then, uh, Pac-Man Versus, I think had that player or like it was a Namco collection
7196180	7198580	that had Pac-Man Versus in it and you could get the player.
7198580	7202200	It was really early on in the Switch's life because I think I remember grabbing it for
7202200	7203500	Dragon Con or something.
7203500	7204500	Yeah.
7204500	7208300	I think for the reason why download play isn't really a thing on the Switch is because the
7208300	7214240	ROM sizes are much larger and like a portable system, like the DS and the 3DS versus the
7214240	7220560	stuff that's in the Switch, whereas the Switch, it's not, it's not huge, but to beam all that
7220560	7225800	stuff over there, it's just not feasible to do it super quick.
7225800	7226800	Yeah.
7226800	7230100	It would be pretty heavy on network traffic, but it is kind of neat that you can still
7230100	7233360	like, you know, you download the local copy and then you're able to do this stuff.
7233360	7235360	I think that's going to be great for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
7235360	7236700	I look forward to playing it.
7236700	7237880	So yeah.
7238300	7241420	I remember playing it a little bit, but I never got very far because how many people
7241420	7242420	had that whole setup?
7242420	7246180	I had an X that had the Game Boy Advance, that whole thing, so I could play with him,
7246180	7248380	but like we only ever played like two or three times.
7248380	7249380	So anyway.
7249380	7250380	All right.
7250380	7251380	Moving on.
7251380	7252380	A few more stories for you.
7252380	7253380	Loki.
7253380	7254380	All right.
7254380	7260940	And so we know about the Xbox Series X and what to kind of expect there.
7260940	7267960	What we don't know about is some of these leaks and information coming out about some
7267960	7273080	sort of system called a code name Lockhart, which the thought is it's going to be a
7273080	7276680	lower powered version of the Xbox Series X.
7276680	7280640	Some are thinking that it's going to be like an Xbox Series S, whereas, you know, we have
7280640	7287200	the Xbox One S as well, that could be maybe an only digital system or a system that may
7287200	7292500	be dedicated to just current gen Xbox One games.
7292500	7296820	No words on exactly what that's going to be, but we know that there's some information
7296820	7304060	based on the X2K and GDK release notes for June 2020 that reference the Lockhart profiling
7304060	7305060	and stuff.
7305060	7309360	And it lists these different dev kit.
7309360	7311380	It kind of refers back to that.
7311380	7318500	So I guess we'll find out later on what that means.
7318500	7320740	I don't know.
7320740	7322480	Very interesting.
7322480	7324960	I guess we'll find out in July because that's where we're supposed to get everything on
7324960	7326720	the table about Xbox Series X.
7326720	7328980	So some of these rumors will be addressed then.
7328980	7333420	And I think now most people are kind of anticipating Microsoft will end up being the cheaper console
7333420	7335080	one way or another.
7335080	7341200	The question is just how cheap does it end up and what do the features kind of look like
7341200	7342200	versus the other?
7342200	7345460	Because we know PlayStation five, there's disc and there's no disc.
7345460	7348700	Like you can, you know, otherwise they're probably going to be the same thing.
7348700	7350260	Microsoft, who knows?
7350260	7353460	Could one rely more on cloud gaming or so these other things that you're talking about
7353460	7357300	it maybe, you know, won't be there and it'll be, it'll be interesting.
7357300	7361520	Plus something else to consider your Xbox One is still going to play a lot of stuff.
7361520	7364340	So maybe it takes some of the pressure off of upgrading pretty fast.
7364340	7365340	I don't know.
7365340	7367820	It's, it's, it's interesting, but I do feel like we're going to get all the answers pretty
7367820	7368820	soon.
7368820	7369820	Yeah.
7369820	7370820	We'll see.
7371440	7372440	I'm waiting for more announcements.
7372440	7374880	We've got, was it that event coming in July?
7374880	7377680	So pretty soon, next couple of weeks.
7377680	7381160	She Hulk 10 and chat says they should be giving out these consoles for free.
7381160	7387960	Well, let's not forget Microsoft did toy with the whole like cell phone style Xbox at one
7387960	7388960	point.
7388960	7392800	And what I mean by that, only through those Microsoft retail centers, which don't exist
7392800	7393800	anymore.
7393800	7394800	Don't exist anymore.
7394800	7395800	But you never know.
7395800	7396800	They might partner with Facebook or something.
7396800	7397800	No.
7397800	7398800	They'll partner with somebody.
7398800	7399800	Yikes.
7400300	7403940	They'll partner with somebody maybe to offer the whole like subsidized.
7403940	7407420	If you get a certain year subscription to gold path.
7407420	7415100	I don't, I I'm being a little silly, but I we've seen the consoles try to take what works
7415100	7417980	for cell phones and make it work for them.
7417980	7421380	That part doesn't really seem to be stopping.
7421380	7422380	So it'd be interesting.
7422380	7423380	Right?
7423380	7424380	Yeah.
7424380	7425380	It'll be interesting to see what they announce.
7425380	7427980	I mean, we'll know hopefully soon enough.
7427980	7428980	Absolutely.
7429160	7430160	All right.
7430160	7432560	One more story here before we get to the last minute stuff and listen to round table.
7432560	7436800	If you guys have any questions or comments for us in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog
7436800	7439960	network, by all means, uh, say hello, ask your question.
7439960	7442520	And this one is, is kind of a, is this really news?
7442520	7445520	We knew this was going to happen, but it is official.
7445520	7451360	The super Nintendo world theme park opening at universal studios in Japan will be delayed.
7451360	7452760	You want to guess why?
7452760	7453760	Yep.
7453760	7455220	It's COVID-19.
7455240	7461640	So super Nintendo world will not be opening, even though universal studios in Japan opened
7461640	7466120	to visitors once again on June 8th, cause you know, in other places, believe it or not,
7466120	7471480	in a lot of other countries, they got COVID a little more under control than they do here.
7471480	7475880	So there's that, um, not to say it's completely under control, but they have a little more
7475880	7476880	under control.
7476880	7481160	So Japan opened up theme parks again with precautions on June 8th.
7481160	7486300	But super Nintendo world is not going to be opening, uh, as a result, uh, right away.
7486300	7491960	Uh, and so they've delayed the Nintendo area opening until later.
7491960	7494900	And no, uh, it was, it was going to be late July.
7494900	7496420	We don't know the new date now.
7496420	7501740	Um, and it's because of course, when they open this new land, they're anticipating,
7501740	7504840	they're going to get more visitors that are wanting to check out the new land.
7504840	7508660	And right now they don't want a flood of visitors because social distancing is still supposed
7508660	7509660	to be a thing.
7509660	7513000	They actually want to keep attendance down at a manageable levels.
7513000	7517400	In fact, right now, only people can visit the theme park if you live in the surrounding
7517400	7518760	Kansai region.
7518760	7522520	Uh, and so it's really cut the number of visitors way, way down.
7522520	7526260	Um, otherwise super Nintendo world is pretty much finished.
7526260	7532480	So once COVID is taken care of, we have vaccine, effective treatment, herd immunity, whatever
7532480	7535920	it is that takes care of this thing at the end of the day, uh, super Nintendo world will
7535920	7537640	be like ready to open.
7537640	7542100	Uh, and, uh, that means when air travel can resume again, so you can go to Japan and all
7542100	7543100	that stuff.
7543100	7545220	I'm just waiting for them to open up in Hollywood.
7545220	7548860	Um, cause they know they're working on it over there too, or at least they're supposed
7548860	7554580	to be at some point, 2022 super Nintendo land was really supposed to open in tandem with
7554580	7558460	the Tokyo Olympics and it was supposed to be like, well, not in tandem, but you know
7558460	7559460	what I mean?
7559460	7560460	Like still will.
7560460	7561460	Yeah.
7561460	7562460	Well, yeah.
7562460	7564180	Now with the Olympics being postponed to next year, maybe it still will.
7564180	7565180	So there is that.
7565720	7570600	Uh, and yeah, as Joe 100, Matt points out in chat, Disneyland delayed their opening.
7570600	7573280	Can't imagine Disney world will open on time either.
7573280	7574280	Yep.
7574280	7577880	Um, you know, I know a lot of people are, are crapping on the theme park opening stuff
7577880	7584120	and you know, precautions are very important and uh, you just have to wear the damn mask,
7584120	7585240	wear the damn mask.
7585240	7589040	If people, and that, that's why this country is having a problem where, where, where are
7589040	7594700	all these crazy people at trader Joe's and uh, whole foods that are screaming at the
7594700	7598540	camera and screaming at people about how masks are a president stuff in other countries.
7598540	7603660	It's not happening in other countries because other countries, they just wear the masks
7603660	7604660	here.
7604660	7605660	They don't do it.
7605660	7607060	And that's why we're not going anywhere.
7607060	7612900	I would argue it has very little to do with certain reopenings.
7612900	7616260	They've already proved the protest to not have the impact because people at protests
7616260	7618000	wear their, wore their goddamn masks.
7618000	7621320	And there were people at protests who were dedicated to handing out masks to those that
7621320	7622320	didn't have them.
7622320	7624320	And you didn't have those crazy people at the protest.
7624320	7626160	They didn't belong.
7626160	7627320	It's that's, that's it.
7627320	7628800	You want to know why COVID is still around.
7628800	7630800	Look at the people in those videos.
7630800	7635080	Anyway, I've gone on too many rents tonight.
7635080	7636080	Sorry.
7636080	7637960	We're, we're up for our listener round table.
7637960	7641360	If you'd like to participate with our show, if you have any questions or anything for
7641360	7643440	us in chat, go for it.
7643440	7647300	Otherwise, I will look to my cohost, Loki, to see if there's any last minute stories.
7647300	7650180	I thought there were a few things we didn't get to yet.
7650180	7653020	There's a couple of things that also weren't on the show roll.
7653020	7658980	So there's one thing that someone has developed a brand new exploit for the PlayStation 2
7658980	7664700	that allows you to play homebrew discs on the system without any mods needing to be
7664700	7666180	done to the system.
7666180	7667660	No USB keys, nothing.
7667660	7675560	It is just a way to burn a disc that'll actually play it on the system without any problems.
7675560	7676560	Pretty amazing.
7676560	7684040	It's a free DVD boot and it exploits, I guess, the DVD playing portion of the PlayStation
7684040	7689060	2, which sadly rules out my PlayStation 2 because the DVD drive, I think, is broken
7689060	7690780	on it.
7690780	7696360	But apparently it causes the, it triggers a corruption in video playback and then runs
7696360	7700260	the game through that security hole.
7700260	7706420	Pretty crazy that we're developing this stuff already, but yeah.
7706420	7707540	So there's that.
7707540	7711480	And then one other thing I was going to mention is there's some possible leaks about what
7711480	7714720	the announcements are going to be at Evo this year.
7714720	7719220	So some of the announcements, including a Marvel versus Capcom Invitational, they're
7719220	7723820	going to announce a collection that includes X-Men, Children of the Atom, all the way
7723820	7726600	through Marvel versus Capcom 2.
7726600	7729920	I guess kind of similar to what we had with the Arcade 1-Up cabinets, but just like in
7729920	7730920	the collection.
7730920	7738100	They were saying that they're going to announce Fei Long, Alina, and some new character who's
7738100	7741840	a Grilla member of the Neo-Chadaloo.
7741840	7749360	And some additional announcements, Tekken 7, Christy Montanaro, Dr. I can't pronounce
7749360	7754060	the name, Vakskonovich, and a guest character, Kamen Rider 01.
7754060	7755060	Neat.
7755060	7762260	Before we get to another story, since you brought up Arcade 1-Up, guess what email I
7762260	7763940	just got a couple hours ago?
7763940	7768060	I got an email from UPS saying I have a package coming tomorrow and somebody needs to be here
7768060	7769500	to sign for it.
7769500	7770500	It's very heavy.
7770500	7771500	Oh boy.
7771500	7772500	Coming from Los Angeles.
7772500	7777420	So I have to decide if I want to do like a stream of putting that together or not.
7777420	7778420	I don't know.
7778480	7780480	Because it's like IKEA.
7780480	7784100	Well I feel like the only time Alan and I really, really, truly fight is when we're
7784100	7785760	trying to put together furniture.
7785760	7788740	So that might be the type of thing we don't want to broadcast.
7788740	7789960	So we'll see.
7789960	7790960	I don't know.
7790960	7791960	I have to see how hard it is first.
7791960	7795560	I need to go back and watch Bobby's video when he got a Star Wars cabinet and see how
7795560	7797720	difficult of an undertaking it's going to be.
7797720	7799440	But I'm really excited that that's showing up.
7799440	7803680	And again, if you don't know, I bought myself a birthday present because my birthday was
7803680	7807480	this last week and they just, like the timing of the shipment just worked out.
7807540	7813220	I got one of the limited edition, I think there's only like 3000 or 3000 and change,
7813220	7815500	Burger Time arcade 1UP machines.
7815500	7817100	So I get to find out what number I am too.
7817100	7818100	That'll be fun too.
7818100	7819100	Ooh.
7819100	7820100	Yeah.
7820100	7821100	Ooh.
7821100	7822100	Very fun.
7822100	7823100	Cool.
7823100	7824100	Ooh, wow.
7824100	7825940	Bobby said it took four hours to put that thing together.
7825940	7826940	My gosh.
7826940	7827940	All right.
7827940	7828940	I like fun.
7828940	7829940	Let me get some other questions from chat.
7829940	7830940	Okay.
7830940	7831940	Bobby says don't stream it.
7831940	7832940	It takes too long.
7832940	7833940	Okay.
7833940	7834940	Fair enough.
7834940	7835940	Let's see.
7836400	7841040	Who says there are so many great games on the market and so little time, how do you
7841040	7844840	guys choose what game to play and finish?
7844840	7845840	Good question.
7845840	7849880	You know, a lot of times a game just kind of has to hold my attention long enough for
7849880	7853320	another game to not come in and eclipse it.
7853320	7858160	And then has to hope that the social games that I play, like the MMOs online also don't
7858160	7861080	knock it out of me paying attention to it either.
7861080	7863520	And it's one of those easier said than done sort of things.
7863520	7868940	Like I have really bad attention span issues when it comes to video games.
7868940	7872780	So when I do take the time to sit down and really finish a video game, play it start
7872780	7876900	to finish, something like the Final Fantasy 7 Remake is probably the most recent one.
7876900	7879200	I think that really is a compliment to the game.
7879200	7883260	And usually it's like I have to know what happens in the story or I just, I need to
7883260	7889500	see what, how this turns out or it's a franchise that I've been a fan of for a long time or
7889500	7890500	what have you.
7890500	7891500	I don't know.
7891500	7893500	Loki, how do you pick and choose?
7893500	7900760	It's just whatever holds my interest and a lot of times it's just, I've got so many
7900760	7901840	to play.
7901840	7907320	So yeah, it could be whatever holds my interest or what people are playing at that given time,
7907320	7910680	if I want to get in on that stuff.
7910680	7911680	I don't know.
7911680	7917720	I know I have a huge library of things I haven't gotten around to playing and we're in Steam
7917720	7922320	Summer Sale time and I'm still getting things.
7922320	7928060	So you know, yeah, I looked at the Steam Summer Sale as well and like, thankfully I resisted
7928060	7929060	so far.
7929060	7933900	I'm kind of like, all right, I've, I've got plenty of games, plenty of games.
7933900	7937760	I can never sit here and go, I have nothing to play because I still, there's that itch
7937760	7938760	IO bundle.
7938760	7941180	I'll never run out of things to play.
7941180	7945220	So it's just a matter of just what grabs my attention.
7945220	7947100	What in the moment says, Oh, this is shiny.
7947520	7948520	I want to check this out.
7948520	7950040	And that's, that's really what it is.
7950040	7954480	So yeah, there's a lot of games, like a lot of VR games I've been looking at.
7954480	7955880	I'm like, Ooh, I want to get that.
7955880	7957880	And then I'm like, when am I really going to play that?
7957880	7963200	Or, you know, just things that, Oh yeah, you know, that's on my wishlist.
7963200	7966280	Maybe actually, and no, I'm not going to play it.
7966280	7968920	I'm still going to get it, but I'm not going to play it.
7968920	7971920	SSJ100Matt says, did we talk about Rogue Legacy 2?
7971920	7974160	I forgot that announcement trailer came out this week.
7974160	7975160	No, we didn't yet.
7975160	7976960	I'm, I'm, I'll check that out.
7976980	7978300	I think it's interesting too.
7978300	7980440	I saw it kind of like the discussion in discord about that.
7980440	7984700	It's using the whole, like, it costs less money if you buy it early.
7985060	7988220	Uh, and then it'll cost more money by the time it actually comes out.
7988220	7991140	Cause it's kind of like they're, they're taking some of the money out.
7991140	7993460	Cause you're kind of effectively beta testing it in a way.
7993740	7994420	Uh, and so that's it.
7994420	7997900	I mean, heck Minecraft was the same way when it, wasn't it cheap when it was first
7997900	8001560	out and then when they like finally were like, okay, Minecraft's a real game.
8001560	8004320	Now they kind of bumped up the price, another $10, I think.
8004320	8006500	So maybe that was just cause Microsoft bought it.
8006500	8008280	I don't know, but, uh, yeah.
8008280	8009840	And, and some other comments and chat.
8009840	8011660	Attica was cheaper on early access.
8011660	8012160	Yeah.
8012160	8014380	So, uh, Rogue Legacy 2 is doing that.
8014380	8015800	I thought the first one was great.
8015800	8016620	I really enjoyed it.
8016620	8020960	I'm kind of surprised it took this long for them to announce a second one, but
8020960	8024840	maybe it's, you know, games don't, games don't show up overnight.
8024840	8027800	It's probably just taken a while to develop and now it's ready to be shown.
8027800	8028720	So that's exciting.
8029400	8031520	I was really one of the first like rogue likes.
8031520	8034720	I remember really playing when that genre really started to take off.
8034780	8037240	I think it was an early PlayStation plus game or something.
8038920	8039420	Yeah.
8040080	8040380	All right.
8040380	8040880	Anything else?
8041880	8043000	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
8043040	8047580	As far as, uh, news I had, um, I, well, I'm probably gonna end up doing it.
8047580	8051260	At some point is going through, I like to sort by least expensive and
8051260	8052540	see what they have offering there.
8052800	8056260	I did that on the eShop the other week and I got a, I got a game for a penny.
8056440	8056940	Oh yeah.
8058060	8060900	You were mentioning buying games for like 9 cents a penny.
8060900	8061520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8061560	8062060	That's fun.
8062820	8063100	Yeah.
8063100	8064240	I have some of my kids to play.
8065220	8065720	All right.
8066520	8069640	Well, I guess with that, we're going to move to wrap up the show.
8069680	8072720	Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show this week,

8098360	8099760	So we need to get more voices here.
8099960	8102840	So help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show.
8103040	8107360	Um, the, that word of mouth goes an awfully long, an awfully long way.

8120960	8122320	are taping for the podcast feed.
8122320	8124520	And I appreciate those of you listening on the podcast as well.

8131640	8134160	So if you want to send us tweets, we do read those as well.
8134520	8137120	Um, with that, I think we are to final thoughts.
8137440	8138720	Loki, your final thought tonight.
8140200	8145040	Uh, my final thought is I need to play something other than Minecraft,
8145080	8146560	but probably not going to happen.
8147080	8150600	Maybe I'll play one of these games that are on the, uh, on my Steam library.
8151960	8152440	All right.
8152440	8156960	Uh, my final thought is happy pride, black lives still matter.
8157200	8161280	I really like that new, uh, redesign of the pride flag with the Chevron,
8161280	8164760	with the other colors in it to represent trans and, uh, people of color.
8164960	8165760	I think that's great.
8166040	8170040	Um, and, um, as far as video games are concerned, I'm looking forward
8170040	8172400	to getting into more, probably actually putting in some hours on
8172400	8174480	Xenoblade this week, cause I didn't put in a lot last week.
8174800	8179800	Um, and I'm looking forward to, um, playing more this, uh, next week.
8179840	8180560	Try to diversify.
8180560	8182560	I want to play a little more of the messenger cause that game was fun too.
8183000	8187880	So we'll be back in seven days to, um, to talk about what we've been doing
8187880	8192160	in the week and recap the gaming news as we get closer and closer to more
8192160	8195760	console reveals and all that fun stuff for what we can expect in the holiday.
8196040	8197080	So be safe, everybody.
8197080	8198920	We'll see you in seven days.
8199080	8199880	Have a wonderful night.
8199920	8200240	Good night.
