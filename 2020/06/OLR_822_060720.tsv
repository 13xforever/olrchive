0	28000	This week Sega announces a system to leverage arcades for regional multiplayer and I'm excited for it. More opportunities to have a larger player base of still local competition sounds great to me. This is just one story about playing together apart. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	56000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 822 for this June the 7th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined virtually in this pandemic era by my awesome co-hosts via Discord. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	74000	Hello. Remember, not every, not just every gamer has a voice but especially our black gamers. Especially that and we'll talk about that here right at the top of the show in just a moment. I also want to say hello as well of course to Techmaster Loki.
74000	82000	Hello. Hi and Techmaster Loki is using what you got like a green screen thing going on, huh, we were up in the effects tonight at OLR.
82000	92000	It's because my wife didn't want the camera on like last time so this way it hides the background so you can't see anything. I don't actually have a green screen. It's just software.
92000	106000	Okay, well it works pretty good. It looks really good. So I like this. We have the different collections going on. We have Loki's green screen, we have DarkSakura's Kirby and doll collection going on back there. And then of course, good old Studio N7 like you're used to seeing here behind me.
107000	132000	Well, let's get to it. It's, it's been, it's been a week. So they say we didn't do a show last week, and we didn't do a show last week because it just would have felt tone deaf, I think, with everything else that's going on in the world to, you know, I know this show oftentimes is an escape from what's going on in the real world.
132000	146000	We've had a lot of tragedy. This year we've all been impacted by COVID-19 and everything that that's done to us personally. And so I know that in a lot of those times this show is really an escape from a lot of those things.
146000	161000	But last week, in particular, I think it felt that an escape would have been wrong. That would have been the wrong thing, because we all needed to stop and listen, and we need to continue to do so just because we're back tonight doesn't mean hey stop listening.
162000	179000	But last week especially felt like it would not have been appropriate for us to be here and talk on top of the conversation about a bunch of things that we're going to get canceled or delayed anyway because the world right now is having a more important conversation.
180000	201000	A big part of the inspiration for coming back tonight, there's this content creator that I follow that I met at Dragon Con. His name's Roberto Blake. He does a lot of YouTube type creation and a lot of how to promote yourself and how to be seen on YouTube. It's a lot of great stuff. I highly recommend his channel.
201000	227000	But there was a video in particular that really like got me and it was like, you know, what do you what do you do as a content creator during these times. And there are some people a lot of people that kind of need the mental health break that a show like this can provide, or the sense of community I think more importantly, that a show like this can provide.
228000	246000	So the message I kind of took away from his video was continue to produce, but you don't need to promote right now. And so you'll notice I didn't really promote a lot tonight my co host didn't either. We have the bots that kind of do their automated thing and you know we let them continue to do the automated thing but otherwise we haven't really been promoting because there's other things that need to be promoted right now.
246000	275000	And that is obviously the voices of our black family as they and I do say family because this show was rooted Orange Lawn's radio started of course as myself, Dark Sakura, Loki, the folks you see here all sitting around the dinner table after playing DDR with our friends and sitting around talking a little bit smack about video games and I hope over the 18 years that we've done this show I really hope that you found that we especially welcome those voices.
276000	286000	from the marginalized communities, including you know LGBTQIA plus since this is Pride Month after all, and our black friends and family.
287000	293000	Obviously none of us are black, that are the three that are kind of the names behind the show.
294000	313000	I'm very lucky, fortunate, thankful that so many of you do come to the chat room, come to the Skype calls that we used to do the discord calls we were doing before COVID-19 happened, and are here with us and are a part of our family.
313000	316000	And I do consider you all part of the family.
317000	326000	And that's why I stand with you guys and everybody who is sick of this shit going on in the world.
327000	331000	And enough is enough and shit is going to change.
331000	341000	And thankfully, thanks to the protest, thanks to things that are happening, we're starting to see, we're starting to see little baby steps, little baby steps of change.
342000	347000	But these are baby steps that wouldn't have happened if we didn't raise our voices loud and and so on.
348000	360000	Jamie, I don't know if you have continued thoughts on this but you are always able to express very eloquently these, these difficult political, I guess, struggles in your positions.
361000	387000	Y'all heard that I'm eloquent. Well, for me, it's been very much being caught in between two worlds because I'm from Alabama. I have a lot of families still there I followed some, some people who I thought had matured after high school, and one of them, namely one of my exes.
388000	394000	Just turned out to be a real racist piece of shit so I was like, you can take your opinion and shove it up your urethra.
395000	411000	And we all know where that is on the dudes. So, yeah, I blocked him I blocked a few other people. My mother and I got into a really big fight, and, you know, and finally just had to call truce that we were just weren't going to discuss some of these things.
411000	424000	So, what I've been super proud of is that once. And I'm going to say it like this for a reason. Once people got the selfish looting out of their system.
424000	440000	And they have set have you proven that they are not among the protesters that we have seen what peaceful protesting can accomplish, we've seen ugliness come out and have people turn it around to be something very beautiful.
441000	446000	And I'm talking about that stupid, you know, child protection wall at the White House.
447000	462000	I mean, you've seen what people have done they put signs on it, you know, look, do you see the crowd on the Golden Gate Bridge, or the Manhattan Bridge, or, you know, people who have just come out in force and people have tried, like, not just police have tried to do this,
462000	485000	but everyday people we had a guy run a tanker truck through a crowd of protesters. We've had cops run over people. And right now, we are looking at a gigantic toddler temper tantrum with people who have access to more things to throw.
485000	495000	We're looking at the, the death throes of the world as it was, we are watching it die and we are a part of history.
496000	507000	And that being said, I am proud of every one of our listeners that I have seen on Twitter on Facebook on any of the social media is the people that I have today.
507000	526000	And I'm really proud of people for even if you can't go out, or even you know if just trying to think of another way to phrase this, even if say you are like me I'm I'm immunocompromised since I had, you know, pneumonia and I have an autoimmune disorder.
527000	538000	I have friends who are HIV positive and living with AIDS, who some of them have risked illness to go participate in the protests.
538000	554000	There's a lot of misinformation going about people you know coming down with COVID at the protests. And I think logically we are going to see another increase in a couple of weeks, but the numbers that you're seeing right now are from this idiot protesters with their guns
554000	564000	wanting their haircuts and massages. And, you know, and not wearing masks I've seen a bunch of protesters out there wearing their PPE and social distancing.
564000	577000	But we also get it from you know the dumb asses who went to the beach the moment that they opened and places that were completely unintelligent we're starting to see a rise here in California now with the restaurants reopening in a lot of places, we're starting
578000	590000	to see a rise in in cases again. Like I told y'all that who listens to me or history, I'm just saying. But we, and speaking of the history, we saw this happen.
590000	599000	You know what people when they bring up Dr. King, you know, they bring up, oh, he would have been against this it was a peaceful protest they show that picture of him walking.
599000	611000	What they don't show is the five minutes later, with him being attacked by people with the cops attacking with it turning into a full riot. And don't forget, he was assassinated.
611000	626000	So, every last one of you taking a stand, who is out there protesting who's coordinating protests, every last one of you who is doing something that isn't just performative, you know, online art.
626000	639000	I commend you. I am very proud of our listeners. I am very proud of a lot of folks in this industry, and keep it up keep the pressure up we cannot back down.
639000	648000	No, it was great. The one thing, the one thing I do want to say with because because you talked about coven and restaurants and I've you and I've talked about this I went to a restaurant.
648000	665000	a week ago, and it's not the same as it was before. I think the key word is precautions and and my viewpoint of probably why the cases are going up in this whole situation is that you have people out there that do not want to follow precautions right and
665000	673000	we've all heard about the Karen's right and the chads that don't want to wear a mask and feel that it's oppression and all that stuff and if you're not willing.
673000	684000	If you're not willing to follow the precautions. That's, I think the truly dangerous thing, and why you know because it goes back to all those people that were crowding the beach and all that stuff.
684000	697000	Luckily, and to bring it back to the real important topic. Luckily with the protests and things we are seeing a lot of, you know, the masks the social distancing, the fact that it is outdoors and you know it's a lot harder to transmit outdoors and it isn't
697000	699000	in an enclosed space.
699000	716000	So I think, you know, I'm hoping I'm praying that we don't see a spike because of the protest, I, the only times I wince is usually because there's a conflict that the cops started that caused the crowd to now move and and you know because they're being tear
716000	726000	gassed or something's going on. And now, social distancing rules are being broken. Did you see that they were pulling the masks off of protesters that's terrible and attacking medics and reporters.
726000	741000	The one that really, like really got under my skin and there's a lot, I mean but the one where I was like, what is the fucking point is the one where the cops are just driving down the highway, spraying pepper spray on people they're protesting at the side of the road.
741000	745000	Like what the fuck point is that.
745000	751000	That is, that is waving your dick, and it's, it's ridiculous.
751000	757000	And there was the one older gentleman who went out extending his hand in peace.
757000	760000	And they knocked him down.
760000	773000	And like, like hype mayhem just said, shoving a 75 year old man to the ground injuring him and then lying about it. When there's fucking video, and yes, they were finally arrested as well they should be.
773000	782000	And thank you for acknowledging our chat room because of course we do you know tape live and we want to hear your comments as we do tape live Sunday nights at twitch.tv slash vogue network.
782000	795000	I want to come because I think this is very important point to bring up Marissa, our dear friend and pal and voiceover lady, Marissa says in chat not allowing racism and prejudice people to hide in your life anymore is a protest.
795000	812000	And I think when it, when it comes back to the question of what can I do, what can we do, you know, well, one thing we can do because one thing that I am hearing from my friends who are black are like, we're tired of having to educate people.
812000	828000	We're tired of being the ones that people want to go to. Well how do I do this better there's resources out there use them right. So I feel like that's one thing we can do is that we can educate our friends who don't get it.
828000	840000	Better educate ourselves. Well yeah of course we got to educate ourselves before we can educate other people but I also feel like that's a place that we have to, we have to work on that is educating other white people.
840000	841000	Is what it is.
841000	844000	I also do have to know when to cut them out.
844000	852000	Yes, but I think it's a delicate line dark soccer and I don't, I don't know if you and I see completely I here I think we do I think there's a middle ground.
852000	858000	I do think there are a lot of people out there that are capable of changing.
858000	860000	I know that because I've changed.
860000	868000	I had a shitty stance on trans rights at one point. Now it wasn't as shitty as JK Rowling it'll never be that shitty.
868000	878000	But I had an opinion remember when that whole RuPaul's Drag Race and the, you've got male, that whole thing happened.
878000	881000	Yeah, I was on the wrong side of that argument.
881000	895000	In the beginning, I remember that, but I educated myself and I was wrong. And I'm sorry, you know, but I learned, and I learned about where I'm starting to understand now better where the other side is coming from.
895000	905000	I'm understanding why trans people hate that word and so forth, you know, and so forth and I educated myself and now I know to do better and I can teach other people that.
905000	910000	Or why some of us are sick of them using the word fish.
911000	919000	Yeah, and there's always going to be consistently things that we have to change within ourselves and learn from our mistakes.
919000	926000	So I do think there are a lot of people out there, you know, I really don't like the whole cancel culture thing.
926000	933000	You know, there's some element of it I get, but there's another element of it where it's like if there's a tweet from 10 years ago.
933000	940000	You need to ask yourself, has that person changed has that person learned from that has that person done better.
940000	959000	Here's another example though. Sure, there is a, and I use this very loosely gentleman who has a battery business, and I, some people might have seen me on social media posting about it, who has doubled down on his vicious racism and calling for people to be
959000	972000	shot, who has a criminal record has had several restraining orders against him by the community, and has been doing this for 10 years and you're not going to get people like that to change.
972000	975000	The only thing that you can do is make them suffer for it.
976000	997000	And I asked you, have you ever heard of a Sikh person that's nasty. Have you ever in your life. Never like practice peace and they came out during the fires and you took people into their own homes and into their temples to take care of them.
997000	1010000	Yeah, I mean like what with that one, you know business and like a person should not provide a business that believes that because he could harm his customers he could harm the community.
1010000	1014000	And so we have to hold them accountable.
1014000	1028000	But I think if you're one of those people out there that you know when you hear the phrase black lives matter your instinct is to go well all lives should matter, because you know you you you we all heard it right you've all heard that response before.
1028000	1042000	And I want to truly believe that there is a good clump of those people that can realize that what they're saying is hurtful, that when you say all lives matter in response to somebody saying black lives matter.
1042000	1047000	You're essentially saying to somebody who is crying out in pain.
1047000	1059000	I am sick of seeing people like me murdered on the nightly news by the police. You are saying that when you when you respond to somebody saying black lives matter say well all lives matter, you're saying that that person in pain.
1059000	1062000	Shut the fuck up.
1062000	1067000	Why would you say other people have it bad too. Why would you say that to somebody in pain.
1067000	1081000	Well I even counted one of my mother's arguments last night, because she she like I said she was digging in. I actually use something out of the Bible that she believes in to illustrate why black lives matter.
1081000	1093000	And it was Jesus talking about, you know, if, if he has a flock, and one of his flock is missing he will leave the rest of the flock to find the missing sheep because that is the one that's in danger.
1093000	1096000	The other flock is safe at home.
1096000	1107000	And that right there if my mom is rebuking the Bible that she claims to believe in and the teachings of whatever, you know, deity creature that she claims to believe in.
1107000	1115000	We have so many other people doing that and they don't understand that they are violating their own faith.
1115000	1119000	There's a very simple hypocrisy.
1119000	1121000	Absolutely, I'm with you.
1121000	1137000	And there's a very simple word. You can add to black lives matter, if you're one of these all Matt all lives matter people. There's a very simple word you can add to black lives matter to help it make sense, potentially, and that word is to black lives
1137000	1139000	matter to.
1139000	1146000	That is what it is, because all lives can't matter until black lives matter.
1146000	1158000	Okay, you're gonna put out the house that's on fire. On that note, black lives can't matter until black queer lives matter, black trans lives matter.
1158000	1169000	And so, you know, it is Pride Month after all and you obviously that is, you know, a particular family that's very near and dear to my heart because you know I'm part of the LGBTQIA family.
1169000	1182000	Your activism has to be intersectional. Yes, absolutely. You can't say, you know, you can't you can't say all lives matter, and then continue to watch as black people get hurt.
1182000	1196000	That's what we talked about activism can't be, it's just point this out to other Jewish people who are white passing Jews, and the reason why it's phrased that way is because they can hide that they're Jewish.
1196000	1204000	They're still a relative, a victim of their own special type of hatred, and it's a racial hatred.
1204000	1212000	But the thing is that, you know, I flat out told them, what would you have said during World War Two.
1212000	1231000	What would you have said if you were being harvested and taken off to a concentration camp, or in the ghettos being beaten or being brought out in the street and shot simply because you were Jewish, and there are black Jews, Ethiopian Jews, we come in all shapes
1231000	1234000	and sizes but we were all Jewish.
1234000	1250000	And the whole, the whole thing is that people are only looking through it, one lens, if you put it in a lens that they'll understand, then hopefully they'll, they'll get it but some people just dig in, they just dig in and they don't want to change because they
1250000	1256000	think they're right and what's important to them is being right, not being compassionate.
1256000	1259000	I want to address. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry.
1259000	1263000	They listen to the, the turd in chief.
1263000	1277000	I wanted to address a comment in chat earlier, you mirror muse and chat says I'm saving up to donate and researching where, and there's a lot of great choices out there worthy of your consideration and you'll notice we've updated the ticker bar along the
1277000	1285000	bottom tonight to not just showcase video gaming news, but spotlight some of these websites and resources that you can you know check out if you if you are so inclined.
1285000	1288000	My advice because this is what I did.
1288000	1299000	I saw that lots and lots of people were donating to that Minnesota bail fund which is great that's a great worthy use of money. I was also hearing though that they almost had so much money that they were distributed to other places.
1299000	1312000	So, I wanted to keep my money, local was with some of the things like in some local efforts, um, again, but again, you need to do what you need to do with your money that you, you know, do a little research and so forth and I'm not going to tell you
1312000	1314000	oh I did it better you're just.
1314000	1325000	This is a suggestion, starting your home community, because, because guess what, if you research some of these different charities, you're going to educate yourself along the way which is that's that's the silver lining about this whole thing.
1325000	1340000	The first place I donated because I just thought, you know, you know, you know what speaks to my heart. Do you know what speaks to me personally you know a language that I love to speak with somebody about is independent media and homegrown media and getting
1340000	1347000	your voice out there and getting heard. So this might be a little local but Jamie I know you know these folks the folks over at Black Zebra productions.
1347000	1349000	I get. Yeah, I get.
1349000	1363000	Because they're out there tirelessly covering what's going on here in Sacramento, in the way that no other news network or news organization is willing to do like they are in the trenches, showing it to everybody on Facebook and holding.
1364000	1381000	It's great they're they're a great organization. I had a, I had a friend online, who was who happens to be in Minneapolis, who was organizing an effort to get some hot food together to give to black communities in need during all of these issues going on.
1381000	1392000	And you know this is somebody that is, I can't consider like a great friend but like an online acquaintance we survivor LARP together that's that's how we know each other, but I was like, I want to help you specifically because what you're doing is
1392000	1405000	so I gave money there too. So, those are the kinds of thing that it's that's not all but those are just some things I wanted to name because there's a lot out there if you kind of look around, there's a lot of great causes that I think you're, you're
1405000	1415000	going to find that that speak to you, and maybe you're going to find something like I did where I was like, Oh, this, this speaks to me, and I want to help this for sure.
1416000	1424000	I don't know if you have any follow up advice on that Jamie on how to like research organizations that are worthy of your time and or money.
1424000	1438000	I know that if you're also looking for ones that are associated with like LGBT facilities that are associated with black charities. You can also check out your local LGBT center.
1438000	1442000	And that is.
1442000	1444000	Oh, by Felicia.
1444000	1446000	I'll address that.
1446000	1447000	Okay.
1447000	1467000	Anyway, you can look to your local LGBT communities, and your community centers, and you can take the, you know, ask them, hey do you work with any black charities Do you have any resources for black trans people are black queer people, you know, offer, offer
1467000	1484000	to work with them in relation to certain things like for example, I don't know of an LGBT center that doesn't have some sort of communication with like a separate trans center, or a separate black charity, we have here in Sacramento, a wonderful woman,
1484000	1499000	Ebony, who works with. I don't know she still works with the gender health center, but she's very active and of course both the trans community, and in Black Lives Matter, and absolutely, absolutely just a delightful person, and I'm even going to see if I can
1499000	1505000	get more resources from her in particular, they'll be happy to share on my Twitter with everybody.
1505000	1517000	I want to address this comment in chat and y'all know what what I'm going to hear swung tongue and chat says, Okay, I'm done with this podcast right now. I'm sick of all the virtual signaling, and yes, I'm also not white so please don't assume.
1517000	1521000	I'm sorry to hear that, but I ain't apologizing for shit.
1521000	1530000	And I that history is going to show that you are on the wrong side of this.
1530000	1538000	I've said earlier in the show, if you will open your ears and open your heart and open your mind, you can change your mind.
1538000	1542000	But if you're willfully going to put up a wall and shut it off.
1542000	1545000	Bye bitch.
1545000	1554000	And don't confuse heartfelt words and real anger for fucking virtue signaling. That's bullshit.
1554000	1561000	We have done this show for a much smaller crowd. We have done this show for a much larger crowd.
1561000	1581000	I'm not here to please anybody. I'm here to be me. She's here to be her. He's here to be quiet. No, I'm just kidding. He's here to be him too. Okay, but I'm not going to apologize for this passion.
1582000	1594000	You're so lucky that you're in a position where you can turn this off, where you can walk away.
1594000	1603000	So if you want to use your position of privilege, whatever it may be, to walk away, bye.
1603000	1614000	But you know what? You're not going to escape this forever because history's a changin'.
1614000	1623000	That's all I got. History is changing. And you're either on the right side or you're on the wrong side and doing nothing puts you on the wrong side.
1623000	1627000	You think it's just us, bro?
1627000	1637000	Actually, I want to thank for the perfect segue. Because if you're going to walk away from this, you're going to be walking away from a lot this week.
1637000	1644000	Let's talk about some of the ways that the industry has been responding. What a great segue. Dark Sakura?
1644000	1660000	Let's do it. I've got a good number of examples. There are a good number of companies who have come right out and made a statement and have even canceled some major unveilings because of what's going on in the country.
1660000	1671000	Like, for example, EA, I know we like to take a big, big internet dump on EA from time to time, but their quote is that we stand with our African American black community of friends, players, colleagues and partners.
1671000	1679000	Our immediate attention is on actions we can take to drive change against the unjust treatment and systematic bias that is plaguing the nation and our world.
1679000	1690000	It said it would find another time to talk football with you. So it postponed their meeting, the EA Play Live event on June 18th and to June 18th.
1690000	1699000	They planned on doing it June 11th. Moving forward, Naughty Dog. They have pushed back the release of Last of Us Part 2.
1699000	1709000	And they published the tweet with Black Lives Matter. They said many of us at Naughty Dog are donating to national and local organizations. Please consider donating yourself.
1709000	1722000	Riot Games also came out speaking about it, saying hearts are heavy as hope seems lost and trust has been broken, but they stand in solidarity with the black community against all acts of injustice, racist, prejudice and hatred.
1722000	1731000	Marvel came out and said we stand against racism. We stand for inclusion. We stand with our fellow black employees, storytellers, creators and the entire black community. We must unite and speak out.
1731000	1736000	Granted, they said the same thing for all Disney properties, but the same.
1736000	1746000	And even, you know, we've got other major companies. Tim Cook came out and said a nice big long letter about what's going on in the world.
1746000	1756000	And I mean, he's from my hometown. I'm super proud. Just proof that Southerners can, you know, can escape the stereotype of their location.
1756000	1767000	Now, right now, itch.io has a bundle of 742 games that they're selling for five bucks.
1768000	1782000	A lot of these, I don't know if it's all of them or most of them, but these are games that are either from black owned companies have a story that involves equality and justice.
1782000	1793000	And it is pay what you want. Your minimum is $5 and all proceeds go to NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Community Bill Fund split 50-50.
1793000	1801000	I think there's some black creators in that there's over there's over 700 games in that. So I think it's just everybody who wants to help in just a few.
1801000	1809000	First of all, babysitter, bloodbath, just saying the night fishermen, oxen free desktop goose.
1809000	1818000	He just is a goose that hangs out on your desk. There's Tricha, which we think covered a little while, Daddy, a little far back.
1818000	1823000	I'm sorry, I was looking at Plant Daddy when I said that.
1823000	1834000	Just looking at a few other I saw one that had a big ado crimes. It's called Kissing Comrades. It's a 200 word LARP of anti-fascist making out.
1834000	1843000	And by the way, it is Gay Pride Month amongst all this, but I think in this particular year, like you're really looking at gay wrath month happening.
1843000	1848000	The little outburst you heard from me earlier, it's not going to end there.
1848000	1855000	We are all tired. Every single like a COVID-19 was enough. We are all tired.
1855000	1859000	I want to play this one. It's called Three Lesbians in a Barrow.
1860000	1871000	I was going to say that we may remember a while back we had Sega on the show to talk about a game called Dominique Pamplemousse.
1871000	1874000	I remember that. Oh, cool. Good call out. Thanks.
1874000	1878000	There's a game called Order of Pizza and Super Hexagon.
1878000	1883000	I think the other extension for Dominique Pamplemousse.
1883000	1887000	So there's there's quite the destined and there's that's also on there.
1887000	1895000	So I'm it's a it's a really, really good bundle. And I actually I mean, I'm kind of on the broke side right now, but I donated 10 bucks.
1895000	1900000	At least I was going to double the minimum, but it's absolutely worth it.
1900000	1905000	And I can do this for folks in the chat is I am just going to paste it in the chat.
1905000	1910000	But I just it's called the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality.
1910000	1913000	Just look it up. It's worth your time, worth your money.
1913000	1918000	If you go to the itch.io main site, because I couldn't fit the whole link in the banner across the bottom either.
1918000	1923000	If you just go to the itch.io main page, it's right there. You'll see a banner right in the middle of the page.
1923000	1928000	So we do have some other ways that the industry is stepping up.
1928000	1937000	The Pokemon company is donating or has donated two hundred thousand dollars to Black Lives Matter and NAACP.
1937000	1941000	They gave a hundred grand, a hundred grand each.
1941000	1953000	And Niantic also pledged that all of its proceeds from the upcoming Pokemon Go Fest with a minimum pledge of five million will be donated to black game creators and nonprofit organizations.
1953000	1961000	Niantic's move here was big. Like I was I I was so proud to be like I'm usually one of the biggest critics of Niantic games.
1961000	1971000	That's because I love them so damn much. But like I was so proud when I saw like what they were doing, because that was a great example of like not just open your purse, but like do something.
1971000	1977000	It was great. I also like what the Pokemon company had to say about it.
1977000	1982000	Here at the Pokemon Company International, we believe in friendship, inclusivity and equity.
1982000	1987000	These are the values that anchor the Pokemon brand. There is no place for oppression within our community.
1987000	1996000	We stand in solidarity with our black employees, fans and families who continue to be impacted by systematic racism and senseless violence.
1996000	2001000	So to another tweet out there, there's smite.
2001000	2009000	They came right out and said, today we've completed a full chat log review and have suspended over 5000 accounts for racism.
2009000	2014000	We've also implemented new tech for our team to find and punish racist actions more easily.
2014000	2019000	We still have work to do and are committed to ensuring smite is a hate free environment.
2019000	2030000	And then I saw further down and it just looking through a post that there was someone who.
2030000	2036000	I'm trying to find it. They found someone who had been really bad about it.
2036000	2046000	And they actually banned him and instead now they have it to where he's donating like his entire paycheck toward Black Lives Matter.
2046000	2051000	One of the charities. But I thought that was really good that they did that.
2051000	2057000	And then another one. And this one, of course, is a bit nearer and dear to my heart.
2057000	2071000	There's protests in Animal Crossing. And now you know how the there was the big Hong Kong resistance protests that have been on enough to make China want to ban poke and not Pokemon, but Animal Crossing.
2071000	2079000	Well, now we have a big slew of Black Lives Matter protests of people getting together, you know, putting video, putting content up.
2079000	2083000	I even in my Animal Crossing community, it is a private one.
2083000	2091000	So let me know if you're interested. But I do have a big thread on here of people just posting things related to Black Lives Matter and things.
2091000	2099000	Also, I have another one for LGBT items, but I'm happy for there to be crossover in those two things.
2099000	2106000	And I like that one of the people running Twitter, it's the Animal Crossing struggles.
2106000	2118000	Black Lives Matter Twitter said the lives of real people, metal matters so much more than just an account gimmick.
2118000	2121000	So there you go.
2121000	2128000	I've been posting what I can. I'm picking different things that interest me and adding the message to it.
2128000	2132000	You know, we can we can do a little bit to raise awareness.
2132000	2141000	We can do a lot more to to be a force for change. And our video games can be part of that.
2141000	2146000	We can hold the companies that we buy from. We can hold their asses to the fire and say do something.
2146000	2151000	And at least they see which way the wind is blowing and are acting accordingly.
2151000	2161000	And I think it's it's like when we talk about like actually making the tangible change, like for how long have we all complained about going on to Xbox Live?
2161000	2165000	And Xbox Live is just my baseline, any voice chat, any game anywhere.
2165000	2167000	But how long have we complained about going on to Xbox Live?
2167000	2175000	And all you hear is racial slur, racial slur, slur for gay people, slur for gay people, racial slur.
2175000	2181000	And now, like finally, after all these years, I mean, you hear a little bit here and there.
2182000	2192000	But now, like to have these big games come in and say enough and really start to swing, like the Smite example and all that.
2192000	2197000	We're going to put in technology that finds this stuff and weeds it out.
2197000	2205000	Like, thank you. Finally, we're moving in the right direction. And that's going to make gaming better for everyone.
2205000	2209000	See, you want to all lives matter, this stuff.
2209000	2215000	Guess what? By addressing some of the inequalities over here, we can all benefit.
2215000	2219000	How about that? Am I right?
2219000	2228000	Yeah, it's just I'm so I'm so so heartbroken and disgusted.
2228000	2234000	Just I let me let me go. I know. I know.
2234000	2238000	Let me go ahead and move on to Loki, because you have some other industry companies.
2238000	2240000	You want to talk about what they're doing.
2240000	2249000	So Activision, Infinity Ward actually are making some changes to Call of Duty Modern Warfare to address some of these.
2249000	2255000	As you mentioned, you know, racist, homophobic comments that are in chat and that type of stuff.
2255000	2262000	So they put out a tweet on the third saying that there's no place for racist content in our game.
2262000	2266000	This is an effort we begin to launch and we need to do a better job.
2266000	2274000	We're issuing thousands of daily bans of racist and hate oriented names, but we know that we have to do more.
2274000	2280000	And we are. And so in addition to that, they're adding additional resources to modern ID racist content,
2280000	2289000	adding additional in-game reporting systems to increase the number of bans by hour, adding filters, greater restrictions on name changes,
2289000	2298000	evaluating in-game improvements to make it easier to report offenses and increasing permanent bans to root out repeat offenders.
2298000	2304000	Along with that, they also had added some Black Lives Matter content to the game as well.
2304000	2311000	So they have like kind of a little bit of a splash screen and that kind of a part of the way you sign in and talks about,
2311000	2318000	you know, how, you know, this is an important movement and that this kind of behavior is not going to be tolerated.
2318000	2324000	And then on another company, we've got 2K games.
2324000	2333000	So in NBA 2K20, they're giving players I Can't Breathe, Black Lives Matter shirts and Say Their Names shirts all available for free.
2333000	2338000	So you can, you know, of course, dress up your player to kind of commemorate that.
2338000	2343000	And then they're also putting up a banner about in memorum for George Floyd.
2343000	2347000	They're going to be suspending gameplay. They did it for two hours.
2347000	2352000	I know there's other services of the same thing, like Grand Theft Auto Online did that as well and Red Dead Online.
2352000	2356000	And it looks like they even had, you know, of course, with these different shirts and whatnot.
2356000	2359000	There's people doing like protests within the games as well.
2359000	2363000	So that's kind of cool that they're doing that.
2363000	2369000	What else? So we have other charities, of course, getting large sums of money from different companies.
2369000	2379000	So one of those being Niantic, they're donating five million dollars minimum to support Black Lives Matter as well.
2379000	2387000	I'm not sure with the exact charity that they're giving to or if it's going to be kind of split up months that.
2387000	2394000	It looks like that they had also mentioned they'd be donating one hundred thousand dollars to the Marsha P. Johnson Institute as well.
2394000	2401000	That helps. It's dedicated to protecting and defending the rights of black trans people.
2401000	2405000	And then what else? So.
2405000	2408000	That's it. Yeah.
2408000	2411000	So go ahead, Jamie.
2411000	2425000	I was also just noticing I can actually go into it later, but just I just saw a new stream of information come by with other people who you wouldn't expect to support the movement supporting it.
2425000	2429000	Yeah, no, I saw that earlier as well. You talk about Mitt Romney, right?
2429000	2432000	Yeah, but also GoFundMe suspended Candace Owens.
2432000	2436000	Oh, right there. Yeah. So. So anyway, yeah.
2436000	2448000	You know, and I think that just goes to show, like, you don't have to be left leaning or right leaning to understand what is, you know, what the nation is talking about right now.
2448000	2453000	Like it isn't it's not a political issue. People want to make it a political issue, but it's not.
2453000	2456000	So anyway.
2456000	2464000	But again, and as I responded to our person that had to loudly announce that they were uncomfortable, so they were leaving.
2464000	2471000	The industry is is listening to these protests. The industry is making small changes.
2471000	2479000	You know, it's not just in video gaming either. Like, we're seeing other industries across the board respond to this.
2479000	2485000	This is the one. This one, I think, is kind of powerful because it is Pride Month. Dark Soccer.
2485000	2492000	You know about those apps that gay guys and the like like Grinder.
2492000	2495000	And do you know what the big change they made this week?
2495000	2500000	Oh, yeah, they're removing. Aren't they removing like the ethnicity filter?
2500000	2505000	They are removing the ethnicity filter so you can no longer search for people by ethnicity.
2505000	2511000	And of course, a lot of people are responding to that with, well, why was that even there in the first place, which is a great question.
2511000	2516000	However, I do think you should still, you know, applaud this. This is tangible change.
2516000	2520000	This is great change in the right direction. We should be asking that question.
2520000	2528000	Why was that even a thing in the first place? Because that just plays into the whole, you know, oh, it's just a preference, you know, in that whole.
2528000	2535000	I have heard at the clubs saying, well, I met up with this dude, but he was Asian.
2535000	2541000	Oh, or I met up with this dude. But this girl, I've heard a lot.
2541000	2547000	I know. I know, you know, but and that's why I'm saying this is a great baby step.
2547000	2553000	I mean, again, it's not like we can say, hooray, war is over, but it's a great baby step in the right direction.
2553000	2557000	And these are the types of things that should be acknowledged in like, yay, we want to see more of that.
2557000	2562000	Right. So and the gaming company is doing a lot of like good stuff.
2562000	2568000	And, you know, I know this was the episode we should have been talking about PlayStation 4 and heading into Earth.
2568000	2575000	Excuse me. We still talk PlayStation 4. Should've been talking about PlayStation 5 and a lot of the stuff heading into E3 and all that stuff.
2575000	2579000	But you know what? Well, that's that stuff will still be there in a few weeks.
2579000	2590000	It'll still be there, you know, because right now these conversations can't wait anymore because lives are at stake.
2590000	2594000	So anyway. Absolutely that. Absolutely.
2594000	2600000	The lives of other humans are going to matter more than what you feel about a game.
2600000	2604000	Right. Sorry. That's not sorry. That's that was true about COVID as well.
2604000	2609000	And it's that that hasn't changed. That part hasn't changed.
2609000	2614000	For some reason, some people's feelings change, but that's a whole nother.
2614000	2619000	You know, those people can bite my ass anyway.
2619000	2625000	Those those people, those people I'm going to.
2625000	2631000	I'm going to I don't know what else to send, but thoughts and prayers that they're going to change what that does.
2631000	2636000	I know. I know. But what else can I send those folks that they might listen to?
2636000	2642000	Diarrhea. All right. Anyway, Marissa.
2642000	2648000	Oh my gosh. I smell nothing but poo. Maybe if I stopped being shitty, people would stop sending me shit.
2648000	2655000	Marissa. I'm smart. Marissa in chat says, inspired by Rob. I'm going to yell, yay, now more at brands.
2656000	2661000	I don't think I invented that. But sure, if that's it. Thank you. I'm flattered. All right.
2661000	2668000	Anyhow, let's move on because I know we've spent a lot of the show and we needed to.
2668000	2679000	We needed to. But I also know there are a lot of folks that are still looking for video game chat and who need a moment to decompress and talk about games.
2679000	2682000	So let's talk about games and what else is going on in our gaming world.
2682000	2686000	So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2686000	2692000	And I suppose the last two weeks, if you want dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Animal Crossing.
2692000	2697000	And we got of course, we had got AC DC pinball, which I finally took some time to play.
2697000	2700000	And we still have that scared stiff over here.
2700000	2709000	But Dan bought one of the old Star Trek tables and he brought him something else.
2709000	2715000	But I don't remember. I think it was just the Star Trek one. It's a little toasty in this room.
2715000	2723000	So really, that's about it. I haven't really been doing much because honestly, Animal Crossing has been my happy place.
2723000	2726000	It's been my comfort. And there you go. Yeah.
2726000	2730000	And I hate to say this because I know it is hot in there, but be careful with a fan too close to the mic because we can hear the.
2730000	2734000	Normally I have this thing muted. OK. Oh, yeah. That's all right. Sorry.
2734000	2738000	Although we do love a fan as an accessory, but you just got to be careful with the mic.
2738000	2742000	OK, let's see. Loki, how is your gaming week?
2742000	2754000	It's all Minecraft. So I played lots of Minecraft on our realm and I started to play Minecraft Dungeons,
2754000	2759000	but then I stopped because it wasn't recognizing my controller for some reason.
2759000	2768000	And it could be because when I plug in my controller to my USB hub or whatever, it starts to kind of freak out a little bit sometimes.
2768000	2773000	And so it'll think it's like a second player controller. And some games don't like that necessarily.
2773000	2780000	And I just didn't want to bother with it. I didn't want to play keyboard and mouse, even though that game probably could be played keyboard mouse pretty easily.
2780000	2786000	But I watched the intro of it. But then I went back to playing regular Minecraft and that's what I've been doing an awful lot.
2786000	2792000	So in our realm, since we've been doing all survival, we have this giant mansion I've built.
2792000	2798000	We now have a well, I was trying to make a villager spawning farm that didn't work out.
2798000	2804000	So I had to do a plan B and we just now there's too many villagers. And then today was making food farms.
2804000	2812000	So we did melons, pumpkins, and I made a sugar cane farm that makes way too much sugar cane.
2812000	2819000	So now I know when I go back and I have three chests full of sugar cane. And my kids love it.
2819000	2827000	Awesome. I've been enjoying Minecraft Dungeons as well. I was playing it more like the last week as opposed to this recent week.
2827000	2836000	But it's fun. It's very like old school Diablo. It doesn't have a lot of the conveniences and the features that a newer Diablo game has.
2836000	2841000	It's very parsed down, but I've enjoyed it. I've probably played more of that than actual Minecraft.
2841000	2849000	Well, yeah. And I do want to go in and play it eventually. I know it's really short. I heard it's like about three hours long and stuff.
2849000	2854000	So I'll probably end up playing that at some point maybe this week if I can get the controller stuff working correctly.
2854000	2859000	Whoever's saying it's three hours long is just going straight from point A to B and is not exploring every nook and cranny.
2859000	2865000	And that's not the way I play Diablo. So because I've already spent at least three hours in that game and I'm probably only like four maps in.
2865000	2870000	OK, well, it depends on how you play games. It really does.
2870000	2878000	Yeah. So I had to play that at some point. And of course, I play lots of Orna. So I've been doing dungeons each day.
2878000	2887000	So usually about two at least two dungeons a day because I have one that's near my house and in one day, of course, you always have.
2887000	2898000	And then I've been hitting the raid boss that just sits there just eating, you know, HP.
2898000	2903000	And so I've been doing that a lot, just trying to level up stuff and level up gear. So I have a bunch of ornate stuff.
2903000	2910000	You need a zet to go give it a whooping because that's how I finally got my raid boss down as she came over and she just put up like a million damage on it.
2910000	2917000	It's not. Yeah, it's not that like I can't defeat it. It's just it takes a long time. I don't want to spend time doing this.
2917000	2920000	What the hell is going on, Jamie?
2920000	2925000	I think she's having a conversation with she's having a conversation with chat showing off her different toys or something like that.
2925000	2930000	Yeah, I'm trying to be visually appealing, but the only thing appealing thing I have are my toys.
2930000	2943000	So and finally, I got my set up. So like, even though you can't really see it right now because of the green screen software, it's X split V cam because I don't have a green screen.
2943000	2949000	I thought about getting one, but let's know those are kind of expensive and hard to find right now. And it does the job.
2949000	2953000	OK, it's kind of like, you know, Zoom or something like that.
2953000	2961000	But let's see if I can actually get it. But I also have my snowball right here on a boom arm now.
2961000	2969000	So super fancy. And I've got an actual stream deck as well. So super fancy. I need to do some more streaming.
2969000	2975000	That's great. Nice. All right. My gaming week. I've been playing.
2975000	2985000	Sorry, sorry, sorry. One last thing I wanted to interrupt with. Go for it. And it's important is I wanted to congratulate Extifer and Matt on their brand new baby.
2985000	2992000	Thank you. That is very important to say. So our pal Extifer and his his hubby, Matt, they had a baby.
2992000	2999000	And is it allowed? Maybe I shouldn't say the name. That might be private, but I'll ask him if I can say it on next week's show.
2999000	3004000	But I I don't know how to pronounce it because there's two ways you can pronounce the name. So he's got to tell me later.
3004000	3010000	Don't say it on air. Well, and also, I just want to say, even though it was a paid service,
3010000	3016000	I do want to say good job to their surrogate for going through the pain that goes into making a person.
3016000	3021000	Yeah. Even sure there's money involved, but it is still a very selfless thing to do.
3021000	3027000	Like I am I am going to go through this pain and trauma to help gay guys have a baby like that's.
3027000	3032000	And there's also a it's also important to note that there's a donor as well. So it's actually two women involved.
3032000	3038000	But yes. So kudos to everybody making a baby's hard work.
3038000	3042000	A lot of a lot of people involved. All right. Anyway. Excuse me. How does that look like?
3042000	3046000	Jigglypuff. That is that's a Kirby, not a jigglypuff. Kirby. All right.
3046000	3052000	Anyway, my game is Jigglypuff. I've been playing a little bit of Animal Crossing, but dark soccer.
3052000	3056000	Don't be disappointed in me. I think some of the thrill might be winding down in Animal Crossing.
3056000	3064000	Like I feel like I think because I beat the turnip game and I'm I'm not a very good remodeler when it comes to.
3064000	3068000	What do I do with the town? I feel like I'm running out of things to do. I don't know.
3068000	3072000	I don't know if I'm finding that motivation for me for Animal Crossing every day.
3072000	3076000	Again, I understand. I know other people are still having a great time with it.
3076000	3080000	And I ain't here to poop on that parade. But I'm just I may have hit that point.
3080000	3086000	At that point, dark soccer and where I'm like, what am I? Maybe when there's a game over until you have 10 million bills.
3086000	3093000	Maybe. Well, I'm up to at least six or seven million. Thanks to stonks. So there's that.
3093000	3099000	Well, if you're done, just give me your bells. Shit. No, because I think it'll be the seasonal events that bring me back.
3099000	3104000	Honestly, I think it'll be those that make me want to pop open the game and see what's going on.
3104000	3108000	And you and I both know there's going to be DLC at some point.
3108000	3113000	There will absolutely be DLC that are that's going to add to the game and add more to it at some point. Right.
3113000	3119000	Well, that's what they're doing the holidays. And I mean, and we just got with an update, we got leaf.
3119000	3128000	And we got red. And, you know, they're going to be doing Brewster at the.
3128000	3135000	Word, the museum. Yeah, you have to remember people's coffee orders, and that was kind of annoying.
3135000	3139000	Yeah, so there's going to be there's going to be a lot more that gets added to it and so forth.
3139000	3145000	So that'll have songs left to go. Oh, wow. That's great.
3145000	3151000	All right. But I have been distracted by other games and all on the switch as well.
3151000	3158000	I've been playing clubhouse games, which just came out like two days ago, which is the fifty one board game mini game collection.
3158000	3164000	But it's great. It reminds me of like old PC games that used to put all this stuff together into one collection.
3164000	3167000	And I used to love those games. And so clubhouse games is cool.
3167000	3174000	I love the fact that they put out a client that you can download on a friend's switch or in this case, you know, the other switch in my household.
3174000	3180000	And that way he can play the games with me if he wants. So that's great. I love that. That's a great feature.
3180000	3187000	And so I'm liking that so far. And then I've been spending a lot of time with Xenoblade Chronicles that the remaster of that came out last Friday.
3187000	3195000	And I've been spending quite a bit of time with Xenoblade Chronicles. And it's a it's a good RPG.
3195000	3200000	So many side quests. It almost gets overwhelming everything there is to keep track of.
3200000	3204000	And there's like I feel like every time I'm like, OK, I got past this tutorial and I understand this part.
3204000	3209000	It's like, oh, but wait, there's another layer to this game or there's another mechanic we're going to throw into it.
3209000	3214000	So I'm almost getting overwhelmed in that sense. But the good news is there is a Bobby Black Wolf mode.
3214000	3220000	So they did put in the remaster like a filthy casual mode, essentially. And I'm not afraid to use it.
3220000	3226000	So far, I haven't had to. Although the game has suggested to me maybe I ought to start.
3226000	3229000	I died too many times in one spot. But I was like, no, I'm going to do this one more time.
3229000	3233000	I'm going to go level up over here and then try it again. That worked. I was able to get past it.
3233000	3236000	But there is a mode to make it easier, which I think is a great thing.
3236000	3242000	And there's there's a lot, a lot of great things to do. So many side quests and things.
3242000	3246000	And yeah, you guys in chat Quest Buster says Xenoblade Chronicles is great.
3246000	3249000	Meesh in chat says, I swear that's my favorite game.
3249000	3255000	I don't know if that's in regards to Xenoblade or if it's in regards to Animal Crossing, which Nifty had brought up before.
3255000	3262000	But yeah, Xenoblade is a very, very deep RPG and not the type of thing I think you usually would expect to see on the switch.
3262000	3266000	And I want to say when I when I briefly looked at the Wii version years ago,
3266000	3271000	I think I said something like it's the best PlayStation 2 RPG on the Wii.
3271000	3276000	And in a way that kind of still holds true. Like it's the type of thing you would expect to see on like a PlayStation.
3276000	3282000	But it's it's a great Switch title for sure. So, yeah.
3282000	3285000	Been loving Xenoblade Chronicles. So that has been my gaming week.
3285000	3293000	So in my personal week, though, I do have to state I had like dental surgery on Thursday and they took a tooth out.
3293000	3296000	It's way in the back. You can't see. I still have a great smile.
3296000	3302000	But one of my teeth was just beyond messed up in the back. So that's why you've been saying I'm older.
3302000	3308000	That's why you've been seeing me scarf down food on stream and why I'm going to step away right now to go get a pain pill,
3308000	3313000	because I'm actually kind of hurting right now. So if my co-host would mind taking over for just a minute, that would be great.
3313000	3318000	So we can start tonight's news. Loki.
3318000	3322000	OK, so let's talk a little bit about Sony again.
3322000	3333000	So Sony, unfortunately, has been fined two point four million by the Australian court for apparently misleading PlayStation players about their game refund policy.
3333000	3346000	So it says consumer guarantee rights do not expire after ad digital product has been downloaded and certainly do not disappear after 14 days or any arbitrary date claimed by the game store developer.
3346000	3355000	This is what Sony told these consumers was false and does not reflect the consumer guarantee rights afforded to Australian consumers.
3355000	3363000	So because in Australia, I think they can refund. There's some laws regarding digital purchases, if I remember correctly.
3363000	3372000	But apparently, Sony Europe was it doesn't seem like there's that many folks that were involved in that originally says made.
3372000	3381000	It says four players in Australia think that they only had 14 days to return a digital game, even though they could only get a refund if it is authorized by the game developer who made it.
3381000	3392000	And a fifth person, meanwhile, had to was apparently told by Sony Europe that their refund had to be in a currency of PlayStation Store rather than getting their money back outright.
3392000	3395000	So, yeah, a little bit of misinformation.
3395000	3401000	Unfortunately, that cost them, you know, two point four million dollars, which.
3401000	3409000	That's not really good. And of course, that's three point five million in Australian dollars.
3409000	3413000	Two point four is kind of the conversion rate. I mean.
3413000	3424000	I guess cost of doing business, but, you know, they got to be in alignment with all these other countries because, of course, everybody has different laws in different territories and Germany and even Australia.
3424000	3432000	One point was pretty restrictive about what kind of adult content was in there, including violence.
3432000	3440000	So there's some really crazy consumer law laws down in that part of the world, too.
3440000	3448000	So. Yeah, so it's kind of kind of surprising, but at the same time, you know, not really.
3448000	3455000	I don't know, they've I'm surprised at Sony. I kind of expect something like this from like, you know, an EA or two K or something like that.
3455000	3462000	But. But, yeah, so that's unfortunate.
3462000	3465000	I don't know. So.
3465000	3468000	See.
3468000	3470000	I'm back. Sorry, I missed.
3470000	3472000	Did I miss anything?
3472000	3475000	I know you missed us hallucinating.
3476000	3481000	I just realized I can see you guys. You can't see my cam because the way everything's set up so you don't know that I just sat back down.
3481000	3485000	I do because I have. Oh, you have Twitch up. OK, well, that's good.
3485000	3489000	And then what's happening over here now because of the Webcams running and everything that's going.
3489000	3493000	I don't know about you guys. My audio and video is completely out of sync on the monitor here.
3493000	3500000	So hopefully, hopefully it's not working that way on Twitch. But, oh, we're still we're still having a lot as we haven't made it on Twitch.
3500000	3503000	So otherwise, I would hear echoes all over the place. Oh, no.
3503000	3509000	Bobby says it is out of sync. Oh, shucks. This is we're starting to learn some of the downsides of using the Twitch thing.
3509000	3514000	I wonder if I bet if I were to go to something like.
3514000	3518000	Sorry, guys. See, I'm just learning this as we're going tonight, too, that some things are out of sync.
3518000	3523000	I bet if I were to go to something like I'm trying to bring up a new.
3523000	3527000	Well, whatever. I'll just also spoiler alert for something that's coming up later.
3527000	3532000	If I were to go out video for an exchange, change the scene there and change it back.
3532000	3536000	Oh, no, it's still out of sync. Oh, gross. Sorry, guys.
3536000	3539000	I don't know what's I don't know what's causing that. All right.
3539000	3542000	Yeah. Sorry. It's out of sync. And I'm not sure what to do about it right now.
3542000	3547000	So we'll just we'll have to put up with it for a little while longer. I wonder if I go back.
3547000	3551000	I wonder if I go back to the shot that doesn't have the video in it.
3551000	3555000	If maybe that'll help put it back together. Maybe it'll catch up. So we'll see.
3555000	3561000	I'm going to just hang on the shot for just a minute and I'll go back to my co-host and see if that helps some of the syncing problem,
3561000	3565000	which I think what you need to do is you just need to do what they do in the film industry,
3565000	3572000	which is you get a clapper, you smack it, and that way you just sync up your audio and your visuals when you go and post.
3572000	3578000	Well, I think it was fine. I think time to start learning Final Cut.
3578000	3581000	I think it was fine in the beginning of the show.
3581000	3586000	And I think it's something where the taxing of all the stuff that's.
3586000	3590000	Yeah. Because I think. Yeah. Now as I look at the TV, it's back in sync.
3590000	3596000	So I think it's something about like having to pull down all the visuals. OBS is choking a little bit.
3596000	3599000	Yeah. See, that's all it was. I just had to go back. So what I'm going to have to do,
3599000	3601000	I'm just have to be a little bit more intermittent with the video.
3601000	3606000	So I'll have to show you guys for a little bit. And then when I notice it's out of sync, go back to just me.
3606000	3612000	So, yeah, boy, showing up toys. No, we're learning. We're learning as we go here.
3612000	3616000	So it's part of the fun of exploring new and fun toys here on Twitch.
3616000	3621000	OK, in the meantime, let's move on to the next story, which I think is mine,
3621000	3625000	which has to do with more EA things that are popping up on Steam.
3625000	3635000	So EA is starting to debut more and more things on Steam, including Burnout Paradise Remastered and Mirrors Edge Catalyst.
3635000	3642000	All those games are showing up on Steam on some discounted launch prices that can be up to about 75 percent off.
3642000	3649000	So, for example, Burnout Paradise Remastered is only going to set you back $4.99. Mirrors Edge Catalyst will cost you $9.99.
3649000	3655000	Also, EA is talking about the EA Access, which is the video game service that is subscription based,
3655000	3658000	is going to be available on Steam later this summer.
3658000	3663000	And that's I kind of think that's a pretty big deal because EA has their own thing.
3663000	3668000	EA has Origin, and yet EA is going to be partnering up with Steam in this sense.
3668000	3675000	Is this EA saying that, oh, Origin is done with, Origin is over, or what is happening here with this?
3675000	3680000	Any thoughts on why EA might be expanding to Steam and letting this go from Origin?
3680000	3688000	Maybe their platform they found that people don't necessarily flock to the platform for titles
3688000	3691000	other than the ones that they have to buy from that platform.
3692000	3694000	You know, only with playing The Sims there.
3695000	3699000	Yeah, I think, well, some of these, I mean, a lot of these titles are all older things,
3699000	3702000	so it's probably just stuff that they've stopped making a lot of money.
3702000	3707000	No one's really going to Origin to buy this stuff, and so now they're just putting it on other platforms
3707000	3710000	to see what additional money they can make, and that's pretty much it.
3710000	3714000	I mean, they're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart.
3714000	3717000	They're doing it out of the, I want more money in my wallet.
3718000	3721000	They're doing it out of the tightness of their purse.
3722000	3727000	Alright, let's move on and talk about some SEGA stories, Star Sakura.
3727000	3732000	Oh, SEGA. Oh, I want to love them like I used to.
3732000	3740000	SEGA is doing, they are doing a mini, if you will, or in this case, a micro.
3740000	3749000	So for their 60th anniversary, SEGA has taken the Game Gear and has done a Game Gear Micro,
3749000	3756000	and this shit is tiny. It is much smaller than a Game Boy Micro.
3756000	3760000	I have a Game Boy Micro. You have seen me try to play a Game Boy Micro.
3760000	3766000	This is smaller. The screen is like maybe two-thirds the size, something like that,
3766000	3770000	and it's not wide because, you know, it was fucking Game Gear.
3770000	3779000	And it is 80 millimeters wide with a 1.15 inch screen.
3779000	3782000	Think about that. It is a postage stamp.
3783000	3789000	But you will get a replica of the Game Gear's big window magnifying accessory.
3789000	3792000	Oh, because you fucking need it.
3792000	3798000	So each of the colors comes with four games installed on it.
3798000	3803000	There's a black one that comes with Sonic, Outrun, Royal Stone, Pio Pio Tzu.
3803000	3808000	The blue has Sonic and Tails, Gunstar Heroes, Sylvan and Tails, and Baku Baku Animal.
3808000	3812000	See, now Dan and I are going to have a fight because I want Pio Pio and he'll want Gunstar Heroes.
3812000	3817000	Red has Game Gear, Shinobi, Columns, and two Megami Tensei Gaiden games.
3817000	3823000	And yellow has Shining Force, Shining Force 2, Shining Force Final Conflict, and Nazo Pio Arunaru.
3823000	3828000	So I don't know, maybe you'll have to get all of them because, I mean, Shining Force,
3828000	3834000	although I think that we have them all anyway, but we have like the Genesis ones.
3834000	3837000	Actually, we do have a Game Gear that works.
3837000	3839000	I'm surprised they didn't make that a little bit bigger.
3839000	3844000	I mean, maybe just to keep the cost down, but like those are really small.
3844000	3851000	Like, I would think just maybe make it a little bit smaller than the Game Gear was and, you know, I don't know.
3851000	3861000	So, you know what's funny though about that Pio Pio game is that it is a, the front cover on it,
3861000	3867000	I mean, to do a little translation on it, it's Arl's Rue because Arl's the main character of it.
3867000	3872000	This game is freaking weird and it's a little bit of an adventure game.
3872000	3875000	So, which the cover makes absolutely no fucking sense for it.
3875000	3876000	But there you go.
3876000	3879000	Some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
3879000	3886000	Dartut Suya says, I'm not a fan of only having four specific games of each one, especially at that price.
3886000	3889000	Yeah, they are a little bit pricey and it's not like you're getting a whole,
3889000	3893000	I mean, especially when you compare it to like the NES mini or the SNES mini,
3893000	3897000	like, I'm not sure there's a great value in there, but I don't know.
3897000	3901000	But Tiger Claw says, these are more for collectors.
3901000	3906000	I doubt someone is going to spend hours upon hours playing these games on a tiny screen.
3906000	3912000	And I kind of think that I think there is some accuracy to that comment just because like I collect those,
3912000	3916000	you know, those little mini arcade machines, you know, those machines very well, Dark Soccer,
3916000	3918000	that I collect those mini arcade machines.
3919000	3921000	And I don't play them that much.
3921000	3923000	It's just kind of like have them to collect them.
3923000	3924000	Right.
3924000	3925000	Like a bunch of them.
3925000	3926000	Yeah.
3926000	3927000	And I like to collect them.
3927000	3930000	So we also got that crappy Mortal Kombat ones.
3930000	3932000	Genesis Mortal Kombat with no blood code.
3932000	3935000	It is Genesis Mortal Kombat with no blood code, but it's it's a collectible.
3935000	3936000	Right.
3936000	3938000	So, yeah, I don't know.
3938000	3941000	I mean, I think I mean, they're 50 bucks.
3941000	3944000	I mean, I think I mean, they're 50 bucks.
3944000	3948000	Well, technically forty nine, 80 yen.
3948000	3952000	So roughly forty five bucks US.
3952000	3958000	But the thing is, is that.
3958000	3961000	I mean, there's not really anything on the red one that I would want to play.
3961000	3966000	I mean, yeah, you get Megami Tensei Gaiden and you know, you have the Shining Force games,
3966000	3969000	although honestly, I didn't really care for them on Game Gear.
3969000	3976000	I think I would just want the black one and the red one so I could get Outrun, you know, and Pupil.
3976000	3979000	And I could get Gunstar Heroes.
3979000	3988000	Which we have an inbox sealed Gunstar Heroes for Game Gear.
3988000	3991000	So fancy was the point.
3991000	3992000	All right.
3992000	3997000	At a California extreme, which officially is not happening this year.
3997000	3998000	Exactly.
3998000	4000000	I don't know if you've heard this.
4000000	4004000	For the record, the Golden State Pinball Expo, of course, was canceled.
4004000	4006000	I think it would have already happened.
4006000	4010000	And a good number of others were waiting for some of the other big ones to cancel.
4010000	4011000	Yeah.
4011000	4012000	All right.
4012000	4016000	Well, there's some other Sega news and I think this one's pretty it's pretty interesting and exciting.
4016000	4019000	So we have one looking back and now another looking forward.
4019000	4020000	Right, Loki?
4020000	4021000	Yeah.
4021000	4031000	So this is a brand new streaming platform that's looking to turn some Sega arcades to data centers.
4031000	4034000	So they're calling it Fog Gaming.
4034000	4045000	And the concept is basically using these arcade centers as like a kind of more locally centralized data centers.
4045000	4054000	It'll allow users to be able to connect to these services with lower latency because they're connecting to newer locations.
4054000	4064000	And so not necessarily sure what they're going to be streaming amongst the service, whether it's actually arcade games or what.
4064000	4076000	But it is something kind of neat that they're going to be utilizing these arcades to basically propel entertainment a little bit forward as well.
4076000	4078000	It's a neat idea.
4078000	4083000	We don't have that many arcades here in the States, but in Japan, they definitely have quite a few.
4083000	4087000	So I can see how this is going to work out well over there.
4087000	4095000	Well, you never know if they end up partnering with somebody like Round One or something like Konami did to put Bomani out here officially in the US in some way.
4095000	4098000	You know, there's always those types of partnerships that could be explored.
4098000	4104000	Of course, obviously, with covid and everything, we're not really looking at arcades right now.
4104000	4107000	Although ironically, you know, Bobby had a great show tonight.
4108000	4118000	And one thing he did, he actually he went to an arcade in his town and brought some video back about how things are different and what they're doing in response to covid and all that.
4118000	4126000	And showed like the station right up front where you have to wear put on a mask and wash your hands and how the pinball machines are spaced out more than they would be.
4126000	4131000	So anyway, I won't steal too much of his thunder, but it is interesting to see how the arcade industry.
4131000	4137000	Well, I don't know if I should say industry because this was like a very small kind of independent owner in his neck of the woods that's had to make some changes.
4137000	4143000	But, you know, we were all excited pre covid about Round One coming to Sacramento.
4143000	4147000	And I have. Yeah. So waiting for that whenever that's going to happen.
4147000	4154000	Well, I was supposed to be this year. Loki is the reality is it might not like what the hell's covid going to do this whole situation?
4154000	4163000	We don't know. And I'm not expecting it. I mean, yes, the governor is talking about a wider reopening starting next week.
4163000	4171000	But when we talk about wise, well, I you know, again, when it comes to the governor, he's made a lot of great calls.
4171000	4181000	He was ahead of the curve with some things. I'm surprised. But, you know, and what I was going to say with the reopenings, all these reopenings have been with with modifications.
4181000	4185000	So it's like, sure, they're opening restaurants back up, but they're not like they used to be.
4185000	4188000	And so I'm sure they're going to open up arcades, but they're not like they used to be.
4188000	4194000	So Bob, Bobby showed some of that on his show tonight, but it's going to be interesting to see, OK, does Round One even open a new site at this point?
4194000	4198000	Is it going to be completely modified? What the hell is it going to look like? Right.
4198000	4203000	Yeah, they're probably going to have limited capacity. Like I went and got a haircut last weekend.
4203000	4207000	So, you know, that was an experience that they don't let you wait in the lobby.
4207000	4211000	You have to have a mask on. There's only so many people that are allowed in at a time.
4211000	4217000	You have to schedule an appointment ahead of time to be able to do that.
4217000	4223000	So there's lots of modifications for the dentist because I had this whole thing to aim for the dentist.
4223000	4227000	Like they took my temperature, my blood pressure, which I would expect in my doctor's office, but not my dentist.
4227000	4236000	You know, it's just but obviously I don't care. Like I understand it's for a reason, but it's it's just weird.
4236000	4246000	Yeah. Now, by the way, Dark Soccer in a related tangent, since Bobby did that little trip this week, he actually says in chat,
4246000	4253000	this was my first time playing World Cup Soccer 94 after hearing Jamie talk a lot about it and really paying attention to it.
4253000	4259000	It really is a fun game. Yes, it is. Ours is out being shopped right now, so.
4259000	4265000	We're having the side art repainted. Well, hopefully that means it comes back bigger and better than before, right?
4265000	4272000	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. But finally, people appreciate it. You know, it's and I love basically the Papa Duke games.
4272000	4275000	They're they're really fun. All right.
4275000	4282000	Well, speaking of things that are hopefully going to come back better and stronger later on, let's talk a little bit about Summer Games Done Quick.
4282000	4290000	Now, Summer Games Done Quick hasn't been canceled per se, but the live event has been canceled, which I mean, again, who's shocked?
4290000	4293000	Who's surprised? But I'm sure we're all a little sad.
4293000	4301000	I know Bobby was hoping to do some big things there. And, you know, I think a lot of people were were really looking forward to Summer Games Done Quick in person.
4301000	4308000	But they are going to move it to a completely virtual event, which will happen still on the same dates, August 16th through the 23rd.
4308000	4314000	It's just the onsite portion that was scheduled to be in Bloomington, Minnesota, will not be happening.
4314000	4320000	And I'm I'm sure no one is really surprised at this whole thing, because, of course, the virus does still pose a risk to the public.
4320000	4323000	And there probably isn't an easy way to modify something large like this.
4323000	4331000	So the usual charity will still be spotlighted. Summer Games Done Quick 2020 will be raising money for Doctors Without Borders.
4331000	4335000	Last summer was the first time that the event broke three million.
4335000	4342000	So we'll see if the virtual change, if, you know, that's going to allow them to still make a lot of money or if that's you know,
4342000	4346000	maybe that's going to take a little bit of a hit because it won't have that same in person.
4346000	4350000	But I know they get a lot of support online and from all that. So we'll see.
4350000	4355000	Yeah, I mean, it's not their first virtual event. They did one not too long ago for the whole COVID-19 thing.
4355000	4361000	So, I mean, that was fine. And I mean, it I'm fine with watching that again.
4361000	4365000	So I look forward to this. Oh, interesting.
4365000	4370000	So Bobby says that he is still in the mix for Summer Games Done Quick.
4370000	4375000	They're pulling hosts from the volunteer pool of people who volunteered for August. They're just going to do it over Discord instead.
4375000	4378000	Well, I suppose that makes sense. Everything still has to be done virtually.
4378000	4384000	And like Loki said, they did do that COVID event. So at least they've done a dry run of sorts. Right.
4384000	4388000	So we know it's it's they know what they're doing and they're going to be able to pull it off.
4388000	4391000	It's just going to it's just going to be a little different maybe than what it was before.
4391000	4394000	But I still think it'll be a good event. I still think a ton of people are going to watch.
4394000	4397000	It's just going to be a little different. That's all. All right.
4397000	4400000	All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane.
4400000	4409000	And every week here on the show, dark soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats,
4409000	4413000	you should be checking this game out in a segment that we call the classic game of the week.
4413000	4420000	But I think in response to a lot that's going on right now, you're going to change it up because it's your segment.
4420000	4424000	You can do what you want. Right, Jamie? Yep. So what are we doing?
4424000	4432000	Well, for this one, I want to take the narrative away from the classic games and go to a classic game designer.
4432000	4439000	And in light of everything going on, I wanted to bring attention to a man who is,
4439000	4444000	I would probably say, the person responsible for how we play our games today.
4444000	4456000	And I'm talking about Jerry Lawson. He was a African-American engineer in an industry that wasn't super welcoming of black engineers.
4456000	4465000	And he is really best known in the video game industry as being the designer for the Fairchild Channel.
4465000	4473000	He he's Brooklyn born 1940. His father had some interest in science, but he was just a hard worker.
4473000	4480000	And his mother worked for the city and he just started tinkering with stuff.
4480000	4484000	You know, he liked the little models that he was given.
4484000	4492000	And then he started tinkering with ham radios and he made and sold wonky talkies.
4492000	4496000	And he was all self-taught with just through experimentation with technology.
4496000	4504000	And then he eventually left to go to Silicon Valley, as you do when you want to be in the tech industry.
4504000	4511000	And he started working for Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.
4511000	4516000	He actually found a video game.
4516000	4524000	One of the first video games called Computer Space came out in 1971 and inspired him to make a game called Demolition Derby.
4524000	4531000	It was a coin out game. He built it in his garage and he did it in 1975 with Fairchild's F8 microprocessors.
4531000	4535000	And he tested it in a pizza parlor, you know, like you do.
4535000	4541000	And also it was one of the first microprocessor driven games.
4541000	4551000	So basically his bosses heard of it and they offered him a position as their head of the video division, video products division.
4551000	4555000	And they were set to create the channel F.
4555000	4563000	And the big innovation here, and this is what really sets him apart from, you know, the designers at the time,
4563000	4568000	is that he essentially created removable game cartridges.
4568000	4572000	Because back then, and I even have one of the dedicated pong tables.
4572000	4577000	I should have grabbed it and brought it up to show people, you know, what stuff looked like before they were born.
4577000	4585000	But he decided that cartridges that you could change out would be the future of the video game industry.
4585000	4594000	And it was. He actually, if I recall correctly, I think that he had to petition the FCC.
4594000	4610000	Yeah, he had, it was so novel at the time that he had to approve every cartridge that he produced by the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission.
4610000	4613000	And it had all kinds of different controls.
4613000	4617000	It had a pause button, which, who the fuck had a pause button on their game?
4617000	4619000	This was new.
4619000	4622000	Had just all kinds of neat stuff.
4622000	4634000	I mean, the channel F wasn't really that commercially successful, but the innovation with that is what gave us the Atari 2600 only a couple of years later.
4634000	4645000	And he was one of, he was actually the sole black member of the Homebrew Computer Club that contained Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak.
4645000	4651000	And in fact, Lawson interviewed Wozniak for a position at Fairchild, but didn't hire him.
4651000	4659000	And then he left Fairchild in 1980 and founded a company called VideoSoft that made software for the Atari 2600.
4659000	4664000	Because the 2600 had said channel F what and beaten it.
4664000	4670000	And so they closed in 85 and he started to be a consultant.
4670000	4682000	He worked with Stevie Wonder and created what was called the Wonder Clock that would wake a child with the sound of their parents' voice, but it ever actually made it to production.
4682000	4688000	And he worked in the Stanford Mentor Program and he was starting to write a book about his life.
4688000	4698000	And then he was honored in March 2011 as a pioneer for his work on the video game cartridge by the Video Game Developers Association, the IGDA.
4698000	4707000	And he was honored for his achievement, even posthumously for his development of the cartridge-based console model.
4707000	4715000	In 2003, so before all of this happened, of course, he started having complications from diabetes.
4715000	4719000	He lost the use of one leg and the sight from one of his eyes.
4719000	4726000	And actually, I take that back, this happened a month after his 2011 award.
4726000	4734000	But he died of complications from diabetes and so he is survived by his wife, his two children and his brother.
4734000	4748000	And there was also a documentary about him, just a short one that was developed by Bear Mac called Profiles of African-American Success Video Series.
4748000	4762000	And then also what happened after his death is that his wife donated something like 20 plus pieces of his own personal collection.
4762000	4775000	So it has the documents and preliminary design for video soft games and a complete, gosh, what else was it, the blueprint of the Fairchild Channel F.
4775000	4787000	It was a prototype cartridge called Math Quiz that was the first video game, it was a tie-in for the first video game themed television show called TV Powell.
4787000	4798000	His other blueprints for like a copy of the circuit boards, so three generations of the Channel F circuit boards.
4799000	4809000	Various old cartridges that he had including a few, again, pre-releases like we had Flying Saucer which was later renamed as Desert Fox and Torpedo Alley.
4809000	4820000	I mean, this is some pretty amazing stuff and the fact that she donated it really, really contributes to us knowing more about the history of our games.
4820000	4826000	So, of course it was wood grain, it was the 70s, I mean, geez.
4826000	4836000	But at any rate, there is now the Jerry Lawson collection at the Museum of Play.
4836000	4847000	And so I would be more than happy to post this in chat, but if you just look up the Museum of Play collections and look up Jerry Lawson,
4847000	4851000	you'll find a good write-up about him.
4851000	4858000	And it's absolutely just amazing what this man accomplished and how much we owe him.
4858000	4860000	So, well done.
4860000	4874000	Yeah, this whole thing does sound a little deja vu and not in a bad way at all because you've highlighted the System F as a system before when you were doing the system every so often, every month or whatever.
4874000	4877000	And I remember you talking about Jerry Lawson at that time.
4877000	4889000	So, yeah, he was one of those people that, and Bobby, who again had an excellent show tonight, made a really good, he spotlighted several black people and what they've contributed to video gaming.
4889000	4891000	And obviously Jerry Lawson was one of them.
4891000	4897000	And he brought receipts because he had a book sitting there about video game history and he's like, there's no mention of Jerry Lawson in here.
4897000	4903000	And it wasn't until later on that he really got recognized for what it was that he did.
4903000	4909000	So, you know, because that's what happened right now in history.
4909000	4914000	The first two things that get erased are the contribution of black people and the contributions of women.
4914000	4917000	Yeah, I that's so funny because I was just about to say quick.
4917000	4922000	Can you name an Atari twenty six hundred game named by a made by a woman?
4922000	4925000	Not off the top of my head, River Raid.
4925000	4932000	Yeah, but that's there was one and I forgot what I probably wouldn't know that unless,
4932000	4938000	unless like I, you know, again, it was like his I think it's because we've spotlighted that game is what maybe I don't know.
4938000	4945000	But I just I knew that. But again, it's one of those things that, you know, we don't I think it's very in the moment.
4945000	4952000	I can't remember her name. I can go look it up very easy, but I could tell you I can remember her name.
4952000	4956000	Whereas who made yours revenge? Howard Scott Warshaw.
4956000	4963000	I remember that. Who made Pitfall? David Crane. I remember that because they put his name in the title of the cartridge.
4963000	4971000	To be fair, that was a whole other issue between Activision and Atari at the time that we I'm deviating from what's important right now.
4971000	4976000	But my how our industry has come a long way, at least Carol Shaw.
4976000	4984000	Take that. I should I should know that. But anyway, I have a relative with the exact same name.
4984000	4991000	All right. Thank you. Bobby did Google it to try to save us there. So appreciate it.
4991000	4995000	All right.
4995000	5001000	At any rate, you know, we owe this man a lot. Oh, yeah.
5001000	5009000	His name definitely needs to be uplifted in the annals of a video game lore.
5009000	5016000	Absolutely. Do you think you might end up spotlighting more people from now?
5016000	5022000	Are you are you going to mix it up with people once in a while to is supposed to just games and pinball or what have you?
5022000	5027000	Or is this a one time thing or what? Not to put you on the spot that I just I kind of I kind of like.
5027000	5031000	I kind of like the idea of I know David Crane. I know Howard Scott Warshaw.
5031000	5035000	I know. But I maybe don't know about some other people that I need to know about.
5035000	5041000	Well, it's like the little, you know, girl in the meme. Why can't we do both? Yeah, why not?
5041000	5048000	So, yeah, I'll figure it out. I'll make it happen. So I think from here on out dark soccer, it should just be the classic like spotlight of the week.
5048000	5053000	And you might do a game. You might do a person. You might do a pinball table. You might do a.
5053000	5057000	I don't know, you might you might do a tiger electronics.
5057000	5061000	You might do a sewing machine if that's something to do with gaming. Why not? I've done a sewing machine before.
5061000	5064000	How would the chat feel about that?
5064000	5069000	Quest Buster says Bobby Blackwell says, just do a classic gaming podcast.
5069000	5073000	You know, that is not the first time it's been suggested.
5073000	5079000	I've had a few people message me about doing a classic gaming podcast.
5079000	5084000	And you and me and Dan had to talk about it once. You know, once a blue moon ago.
5084000	5088000	Yeah. But, you know, I had to learn the hard lesson that I need to take on less, not more.
5088000	5093000	So I, I will I will happily help you to the ends of the earth.
5093000	5097000	But yeah, I got to watch how much I allow myself to be a part of it.
5097000	5102000	Yeah, for sure. Well, at any rate, it is on there.
5102000	5105000	And I know Marissa and I have talked about some things, but fun.
5105000	5111000	I, I, I think I can do like a little 30 minute spot and go through some of these things.
5111000	5120000	And now that I have more experience with logic and Final Cut Pro, I can probably put it up on the tubes.
5120000	5124000	Awesome. I love that idea. All right. And by the way, I want to thank the listeners.
5124000	5128000	The listeners had a suggestion on how to fix the sinking problem, and I think it worked.
5128000	5134000	And that was to just reduce if I reduce your guys's pictures a little bit, it would take less.
5134000	5139000	And I think it worked. So I, I made you guys just a little bit smaller, but not too small.
5139000	5143000	But I kind of cropped the pictures a little differently. I think it actually looks better, too.
5143000	5149000	So and that seems to fix the sink problem. So this is why I love having a live chat room.
5149000	5153000	So.
5153000	5157000	Go ahead. I mean, it's not the first time someone made the suggestion to me, so.
5157000	5162000	All right. Well, look forward to the future. All right. Anyhow, we're going to move on.
5162000	5165000	Dark soccer. I don't know if you're taking an early leave tonight or if you're hanging out.
5165000	5173000	All right. I understand. Yeah, I understand. Anything you want to leave us with before you head out for the night?
5173000	5180000	Again, if you can do anything, do something. Lift up the voices of those around you.
5180000	5192000	Donate if you can. There's that I.O. charity. You know, just do something that uplifts the cause and doesn't bring it down.
5192000	5198000	Black lives matter. All right. Well said. Thank you. Dark soccer. Appreciate you. Have a great night.
5198000	5202000	And thanks for being here. All right. All right.
5202000	5209000	As she drops discord, I'm going to rearrange the it's going to look a little funky here because it's going to change the layout on discord.
5209000	5214000	So I'm going to rearrange things while Loki gets into rapid fire news.
5214000	5219000	So look, you want to start us off with some rapid fire news. Yes. Let's talk about a fan game.
5219000	5224000	So this is Sonic 3D blast, but in 2D.
5224000	5234000	So Sonic 3D in 2D is basically a fan game that reimagines Sonic 3D blast, the plot of the game, but in your traditional Sonic format.
5234000	5238000	So they have 15 acts, eight zones, and it's free to play.
5238000	5245000	So if you want to check it out, it's that soda nuc dot itch dot IO slash Sonic 3D 2D.
5245000	5251000	And it looks pretty cool. They have a little trailer for it and stuff, but like I said, free. That's the important part.
5251000	5259000	And go play it. And then also we've got some other fun stuff.
5259000	5265000	So Kingdoms of Amalur reckoning is now being remastered.
5266000	5271000	So it's, you may remember that game a while back.
5271000	5276000	Didn't, it wasn't all that popular, but it was still pretty decent game.
5276000	5281000	It was supposed to be getting sequels, but then there's a whole bunch of mismanagement of money.
5281000	5285000	And so, well, we didn't end up getting it.
5285000	5290000	So now at least it gives a little bit of new life with this remaster.
5290000	5299000	And who knows, maybe with the remaster, it might garner some more interest and then maybe they can finance a sequel or something like that.
5299000	5301000	So you never know.
5301000	5305000	And in chat, Quest Buster says Kingdoms of Amalur was not a bad action RPG.
5305000	5308000	And I've heard, I heard a lot of pretty decent things about that game as well.
5308000	5311000	So this will be a good opportunity to maybe check it out.
5311000	5317000	It's set to come out on August 18th and the screenshots look pretty nice for it.
5317000	5320000	It's also supposed to have all of its original DLC as well.
5320000	5327000	So yeah, pretty interesting. I don't think Curt Schilling is attached to this one.
5327000	5332000	No, no, he's, he's way, way, he's, he's old news and yeah, bye.
5332000	5341000	All right. Let me, I'm going to go back to the take crop you out just for a minute Loki to allow the cameras to catch up there while we're working with the sync issues.
5341000	5343000	But I'm going to do some rapid fire news here real quick.
5343000	5346000	I kind of referenced this one already earlier in the show.
5346000	5349000	But there is a Clubhouse Games Pocket Edition.
5349000	5354000	So it's kind of like the demo edition, if you will, of Clubhouse Games where there are four games in it.
5354000	5357000	Dominos, Connect Four, although I don't think they call it Connect Four.
5357000	5358000	It's a different version of it.
5358000	5361000	Die Fugo and Slot Cars.
5361000	5363000	So that's kind of cool that there's like a free version.
5363000	5368000	So even if you have no interest in Clubhouse Games, you can still get those four games in particular for free.
5368000	5374000	And then if you have this, you can play localized multiplayer with somebody that has the full game.
5374000	5375000	So that's pretty cool.
5375000	5382000	So it's like a client that allows you to do kind of like that old school 3DS beaming gameplay, I guess, sort of.
5382000	5384000	I don't know. That's kind of what it reminded me of.
5384000	5391000	And then we have a quick story on Mortal Kombat Aftermath, which of course is the latest DLC for Mortal Kombat 11.
5391000	5401000	Some rumors due to database scraping and the like that the characters included will be made available to individually purchase later in the month.
5401000	5408000	So if you didn't already know, the characters of Shiva, Robocop, and Fujin were added to Mortal Kombat through the Aftermath expansion.
5408000	5411000	And right now you have to buy that expansion to get those characters.
5411000	5413000	But maybe not everybody wants the expansion.
5413000	5415000	Maybe for whatever reason you don't care about story.
5415000	5418000	Well, they'll sell it to you some way or the other.
5418000	5421000	So yeah, you can check that out.
5421000	5426000	According to a Steam update, those characters are supposed to be available June 16th.
5426000	5429000	Although there's been no official word as of yet.
5429000	5431000	You can take it with a grain of salt as of now.
5431000	5437000	But it wouldn't surprise me if they were looking to do that to sell those characters separately.
5437000	5442000	Because again, if there's a way to take your money, the gaming companies are going to figure out how to do that.
5442000	5446000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5446000	5449000	Loki, what do we have coming out in the US this week, if anything?
5449000	5451000	Not too much.
5451000	5456000	So we've got a game called Project Warlock that's coming out on PS4.
5456000	5463000	Ys Memories of Celceta, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 as well.
5463000	5467000	Also Project Warlock coming out later that week on the Nintendo Switch.
5467000	5471000	And we have on PC Samurai Showdown.
5471000	5475000	And also Samurai Showdown Neo Geo Collection.
5475000	5482000	And then finally at the end of the week, Project Warlock once again coming out on Xbox One.
5482000	5484000	And that's it.
5484000	5487000	Alright, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases over there.
5487000	5490000	I don't see anything on the Switch until June 18th.
5490000	5494000	And then when I look at the PlayStation 4, I'm not sure I see anything right now either.
5494000	5500000	Oh, the Wonderful 101 Remastered is kind of like your lone release in Japan on the PlayStation 4.
5500000	5503000	That comes out on the 11th on the PlayStation 4.
5503000	5506000	And I believe that already came out here in the US.
5506000	5508000	So it's just a small delay there for Japan.
5508000	5513000	But yeah, I know fans of that on the Wii U are looking forward to playing that all over again.
5513000	5516000	So cool. How about Europe, Loki?
5516000	5522000	Europe, we've got Stellaris Console Edition coming out on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
5522000	5528000	Dungeons of the Endless on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
5528000	5534000	Looks like Spirit of the North on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
5534000	5540000	1971 Project Helios on PlayStation 4 and Switch.
5540000	5544000	Descenders, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Switch.
5544000	5545000	And that's it.
5545000	5546000	Alright.
5546000	5548000	Let's go to our mailbag.
5548000	5551000	Every week you guys send us emails and we like to read our favorites here on the show.
5551000	5555000	Participate at Orangeloundtrader.com is the place to send your emails.
5555000	5558000	And we will read them here on air.
5558000	5564000	Let's go to our first email tonight from YYR who actually sent this for last week's show.
5564000	5566000	As we discussed earlier, we didn't do one.
5566000	5569000	So this should have been on last week's show if we had had one.
5569000	5571000	So YYR starts,
5571000	5578000	Hello LR. As you may remember, I have an IT day job so I felt a need to chime in on something mentioned during last week's show.
5578000	5581000	All modern browsers offer a private browsing mode.
5581000	5587000	Whether it's called incognito mode, a private window, or in-private browsing, its function is the same.
5587000	5590000	But from what was said last week, it sounds like it's not what you think it is.
5590000	5597000	The primary purpose of these private browsing modes is to prevent other folks who can physically access your computer from knowing where you've been.
5597000	5605000	Pages that you visit using private browsing modes are not added to your history and information entered in these pages will not be saved either.
5605000	5609000	Cookies from these websites will also be deleted at the end of your session.
5609000	5610000	And that's it.
5610000	5612000	Everything else is the same.
5612000	5615000	The websites you visit can still see and track everything you're doing.
5615000	5619000	If you're browsing at work, your employer can still see all of your activity.
5619000	5623000	And your internet service provider can see all of your traffic as well.
5623000	5624000	So there you have it.
5624000	5628000	Private browsing only actually gives you privacy from the other people in your living space.
5628000	5633000	That is a pretty good call out about the fact that, and I'm deviating from the email,
5633000	5639000	that's a really good call out about the fact that private browsing is not going to shut down the network chat.
5639000	5649000	And that's how your IT department can see it or it's going to count towards your bandwidth on your cable bill or what have you.
5649000	5653000	Using incognito mode does not shut that off.
5653000	5655000	That's important.
5655000	5662000	If you actually want to not be tracked, then never log in anything and set your browser to delete all of your cookies at the end of every session.
5662000	5665000	But that's super inconvenient so most people don't bother.
5665000	5671000	There's always a tradeoff. Convenience versus security, convenience versus privacy, etc. Enjoy.
5671000	5673000	And one other thing from YYR.
5673000	5676000	I actually do use Bing from time to time.
5676000	5679000	It is good for a second opinion when Google isn't giving you what you want.
5679000	5685000	Also the reward points add up and as a bonus, Microsoft isn't as interested in tracking your behavior as Google is.
5685000	5688000	But we all have choices. Vote in November.
5688000	5691000	Thanks again for putting the show together and have a great week.
5691000	5693000	Hugs from YYR.
5693000	5695000	Thank you for that.
5695000	5699000	I've heard of people using Bing as an alternative and I will give you that.
5699000	5701000	The Microsoft reward thing does add up.
5701000	5706000	I was adding up the Game Pass stuff and I went into the app and did other things.
5706000	5711000	I ended up getting $5 off at Chipotle with the Microsoft rewards.
5711000	5714000	So I got $5 off at Chipotle, Loki.
5714000	5718000	With that kind of deals, man, you can almost get the diarrhea for free.
5719000	5721000	Ain't that the truth.
5721000	5724000	Well, the funny thing, I wanted it to be kind of like redundant.
5724000	5731000	Where I'm actually paying for Xbox Live Gold or whatever through reward points.
5731000	5733000	Because that is something you can do.
5733000	5736000	You can actually wish for more wishes on Microsoft rewards.
5736000	5738000	That's how it works.
5738000	5741000	I don't know how it really bothered to like.
5741000	5745000	That seems to be how it works with GameStop.
5745000	5748000	I'd go there occasionally and buy stuff for my kids.
5748000	5751000	Usually around the holidays or whatever.
5751000	5757000	And then they're like, oh, you got enough points to get GameStop rewards or whatever thing.
5757000	5759000	I'm like, oh, you're fine.
5759000	5762000	I throw the magazine away every time it comes in my mail.
5762000	5766000	But I feel if I don't get the magazine, that's like a waste of money.
5766000	5769000	Even though I don't really pay for it.
5769000	5773000	All right. Let's move on and get to our second and last email tonight.
5773000	5776000	And this email comes to us from Meech.
5776000	5778000	So Meech writes this.
5778000	5782000	Dear OLR, firstly, I'd like to say please excuse my grammar mistakes.
5782000	5785000	As I was never really good at writing letters and spelling and all that.
5785000	5789000	Well, the good news is it's me and not talk soccer tonight.
5789000	5791000	I am a little more forgiving.
5791000	5793000	We'll keep that between us.
5793000	5795000	Because I'm terrible with that stuff, too.
5795000	5798000	Now down to the squishy parts. LOL.
5798000	5801000	Anyway, you guys have been the biggest part of my life.
5801000	5803000	Our lives, I should say.
5803000	5809000	Anyway, I just want to say a huge thank you for the kind words you've expressed to me over what's been going on.
5809000	5812000	You've always made me feel a part of a family.
5812000	5817000	And I found a platform in which I have a voice to say what I need to say without regret.
5817000	5822000	Anyway, I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone at OLR through this hard time.
5822000	5825000	We are all facing, and I look forward to every show.
5825000	5827000	Sincerely, Meech.
5829000	5833000	That email means more than you could know.
5833000	5835000	Thank you.
5835000	5838000	It's very rare that I can't think of anything to say.
5838000	5840000	But this is one of those moments.
5840000	5844000	Sometimes you just wonder in these tricky positions.
5844000	5846000	And the timing of the world and everything.
5846000	5851000	And when I do have this platform, even if it's a smaller platform, it is a platform.
5851000	5854000	I always have that wonder in the back of my head.
5854000	5857000	Like, shit, am I using this appropriately?
5857000	5859000	Am I being a good ally?
5859000	5861000	Am I doing the right thing?
5861000	5867000	And so to get an email like that, that lets us know that at least in this case,
5867000	5869000	like, yes, we're helping.
5869000	5871000	Thank you.
5871000	5876000	And hey, I see that as the least we can do.
5876000	5880000	Try to bring a smile to your all's face.
5880000	5885000	Try to make sure people are educated and informed, too, and awake and that stuff.
5885000	5887000	That's important, too.
5887000	5890000	But if we can have a few laughs over Chipotle while we're at it,
5890000	5892000	cool.
5892000	5894000	So thank you so much for that.
5894000	5896000	I really appreciate that.
5896000	5900000	And, yeah, it's emails like that that are going to keep this going for another 18 years.
5900000	5902000	Let me tell you.
5902000	5904000	Thank you.
5904000	5906000	Thank you for the heart reaction chat, too.
5906000	5908000	That sums it up.
5908000	5910000	All right.
5910000	5912000	Let's move on.
5912000	5914000	We have some more show to get to.
5914000	5916000	Some more news.
5916000	5918000	Loki, why don't you start us off?
5918000	5920000	So, yeah.
5920000	5925000	So if you happen to have purchased Half-Life Alyx, you know, it being a Source 2 game,
5925000	5929000	I was unaware that it had Steam Workshop support, but apparently it does.
5929000	5932000	And people are getting pretty creative with the different levels they can make in it.
5932000	5938000	So someone has went ahead and recreated PT in Half-Life Alyx.
5938000	5943000	So, yes, now you can play PT fully immersed in VR.
5943000	5945000	That should be pleasant.
5945000	5947000	How about no?
5947000	5949000	How about no?
5949000	5951000	Are you sure?
5951000	5953000	Pretty sure.
5953000	5955000	Along with that, there's some other highlights.
5955000	5960000	There's some folks converting maps from Portal 2 over to Half-Life Alyx as well.
5960000	5965000	It doesn't quite have the portal functionality yet, so it's just kind of walking through that stuff.
5965000	5968000	And then there's one that I saw pointed out called Overcharge,
5968000	5971000	which looks like a traditional Half-Life type of map.
5971000	5973000	So pretty cool.
5973000	5975000	I have to go check this stuff out.
5975000	5977000	It's been a while since I looked at all this.
5977000	5981000	But, yeah, lots of different mods in there, especially was it last week.
5981000	5987000	They also added that the liquid sloshing in the different wine bottles and stuff,
5987000	5991000	now they have liquid physics in there, and it's pretty amazing.
5991000	5993000	I like this comment from chat.
5994000	5997000	Look, I'm here for you guys to a point.
5997000	5999000	And you've found it.
5999000	6001000	It's not finished yet.
6001000	6003000	They don't have any jumpscares in it, I think.
6003000	6005000	Oh, well that's a little better.
6005000	6007000	It seems very creepy, yeah.
6007000	6010000	S2100mat says Flaco needs to speedrun PT and Half-Life Alyx.
6010000	6012000	Hey, I don't know how to do that.
6012000	6014000	I don't know how to do that.
6014000	6016000	I don't know how to do that.
6016000	6018000	I don't know how to do that.
6018000	6020000	I don't know how to do that.
6020000	6023000	Flaco needs to speedrun PT and Half-Life Alyx.
6023000	6025000	Hey, I'm all about that.
6025000	6028000	Of course, I can't speak for Flaco, so that's up to Flaco.
6028000	6030000	Phoenix7726 asks in chat,
6030000	6033000	Is there a Five Nights at Freddy VR yet?
6033000	6035000	I believe there is.
6035000	6039000	They did do a Five Nights VR game, but it's like a spinoff.
6039000	6041000	It's like a spinoff, right?
6041000	6043000	It's not like the first game in VR.
6043000	6046000	It's like a specifically VR title, right?
6046000	6050000	Yeah, it's like Help Wanted, I think is what the subtitle is on that.
6050000	6053000	I thought about getting it for my kids, but they're not really bugging me.
6053000	6056000	What a loving father you are.
6056000	6058000	It was their request.
6058000	6061000	It would just be like, they'd be bothering me.
6061000	6064000	No, hook up the VR. I want to play VR.
6064000	6066000	It's just an asshole.
6066000	6068000	But they do have it out there.
6068000	6070000	You can play a Five Nights at Freddy game.
6070000	6072000	Alright, love it.
6072000	6074000	I will not be playing.
6074000	6076000	I will play this, though.
6076000	6078000	I may not play the PT in Half-Life Alyx,
6078000	6080000	but I will totally play this next one.
6080000	6084000	And that is a Pac-Man Championship Edition demake.
6084000	6086000	But it's official.
6086000	6088000	A lot of times when we talk about these demakes,
6088000	6090000	we're talking about somebody made a ROM hack,
6090000	6092000	like a Halo 2600 or something,
6092000	6094000	or I shouldn't say ROM hack,
6094000	6096000	but maybe programmed a homebrew or something,
6096000	6098000	did something from the ground up with that.
6098000	6102000	But this is actually official from Namco,
6102000	6104000	which is the demake of Pac-Man Championship Edition.
6104000	6106000	So this is pretty cool.
6106000	6111000	If you pick up all ten launch titles in the Namcot collection,
6111000	6113000	it's not a typo or a mispronunciation.
6113000	6116000	Namcot is what Namco was being called for a short time
6116000	6119000	when they were putting these games out on the NES.
6119000	6122000	If you buy all ten launch titles,
6122000	6124000	you get a special retro demake
6124000	6127000	of Pac-Man Championship Edition from 2007.
6127000	6129000	I think that's really cool.
6129000	6132000	Now, Namcot collection was actually announced before.
6132000	6134000	This was the new news this week.
6134000	6137000	You can actually see a trailer online for the Namcot collection,
6137000	6141000	and you can just buy the whole thing as a collection,
6141000	6144000	or you can piecemeal the games one at a time on the eShop.
6144000	6150000	I want to say that recent River City Ransom Kunio-kun collection
6150000	6152000	is really similar to this.
6152000	6154000	You can get a physical edition with everything,
6154000	6157000	or they've got a lot of those games piecemeal available.
6157000	6159000	If you just want River City Ransom, you can get that.
6159000	6161000	I think I'll like PlayStation 4 or whatever.
6161000	6164000	So anyway, in the Namcot collection,
6164000	6168000	Wagyan Land, Pac-Man, Galaga, Tower of Draga, Battle City,
6168000	6172000	Star Luster, Family Jockey, Yokai, Dochuki, Dragon Spirit,
6172000	6175000	Mendel Palace, and Splatterhouse.
6175000	6177000	So that's really cool.
6177000	6179000	But that's a Japanese collection,
6179000	6181000	so are we going to get to play that in the US?
6181000	6184000	And what we found out this week is yes,
6184000	6186000	they are going to put out a version of this in the US,
6186000	6188000	except they're not going to call it the Namcot collection.
6188000	6192000	They're going to call it Namco Museum Archives Volume 1
6192000	6194000	and Namco Museum Archives Volume 2.
6194000	6197000	They are both coming out on June 18th,
6197000	6202000	and so the titles that will be in Volume 1 are Dig Dug,
6202000	6206000	Dragon Buster, Dragon Spirit, Galaxian Mappy, Pac-Man,
6206000	6209000	the 8-Bit Demaster of Pac-Man Championship Edition,
6209000	6213000	Splatterhouse, Sky Kid, Tower of Draga, and Xevious.
6213000	6218000	In Volume 2, Battle City, Dig Dug 2, Dragon Buster 2,
6218000	6222000	Galaga, Gal Plus, Legacy of the Wizard.
6222000	6225000	What? Fuck yes!
6225000	6228000	Finally, after all these years, I'm so about that.
6228000	6230000	Do you remember that game on the NES?
6230000	6232000	That game was hard as balls.
6232000	6234000	That game is hard, but it's so good.
6234000	6237000	I don't remember it offhand.
6237000	6239000	I probably would if I saw it.
6239000	6242000	Oh my god, it's such a good game.
6242000	6248000	Mappy Land, Mendel Palace, Pac-Land, Rolling Thunder, and Super Xevious.
6248000	6251000	Some of these games were never localized and released in the West.
6251000	6256000	I thought the Namco collection sounded good,
6256000	6260000	and then we had to go and up it into this Namco Museum thing going on.
6260000	6262000	I think that is awesome.
6262000	6265000	Yeah, I'm really excited to look like that.
6265000	6267000	No, I don't think I've ever played this game.
6267000	6269000	Oh, did you look it up on YouTube?
6269000	6274000	Yeah, Box Art Sword looks familiar, but I don't think I've ever played it.
6274000	6280000	It was a game where you could pick one of four adventures
6280000	6284000	that was part of a family, and you went through.
6284000	6287000	It was probably called something else in Japan,
6287000	6289000	and I don't remember the exact name,
6289000	6295000	because I want to say it was a multi-part series in Japan.
6295000	6299000	I'm trying to actually bring up some footage here,
6299000	6303000	but I'm having to multitask to do it here, but somebody's got it,
6303000	6306000	so let me see if I can actually bring up a little bit.
6306000	6308000	Oh, now I'm looking at ads.
6308000	6312000	Tiger Claw, though, in our chat room did link some pictures from the demake,
6312000	6314000	so if you want to check that out for those listening on the podcast feed,
6314000	6319000	you could always, I'm sure, look that up and just Google it
6319000	6322000	like Tiger Claw did and find that.
6322000	6324000	Now we're actually looking at some footage there from Legacy of the Wizard.
6324000	6326000	That's what it looked like on the NES.
6326000	6330000	It was kind of like an old-school RPG with shops and inns and things like that,
6330000	6333000	so it looks like right now they're playing as the dad in the family,
6333000	6336000	and you play one of four characters.
6336000	6338000	Thank you, Dark Tetsuya. It's Dragon Slayer.
6338000	6340000	That's it. It was called Dragon Slayer,
6340000	6342000	and this was Dragon Slayer III or IV or something,
6342000	6345000	and then they localized it, so it was a cool game.
6345000	6348000	I can't believe this is in that upcoming Namco bundle.
6348000	6350000	That's the best news of the week.
6350000	6353000	You know what, though, Loki? This is important to talk about.
6353000	6358000	You know what is that if we get this,
6358000	6362000	because this was published by Broderbund in the U.S.,
6362000	6367000	if Legacy of the Wizard has finally made its way to a modern system
6367000	6372000	after all these years, maybe there's hope for another Broderbund published game.
6372000	6374000	Maybe. Maybe there's a small bit of hope
6374000	6377000	that another 8-bit Broderbund published game will make its way out.
6377000	6379000	You know what game I'm talking about?
6379000	6381000	No. What game are you talking about?
6381000	6385000	A Guardian Legend, because I'm always talking about the Guardian Legend,
6385000	6389000	because that game needs its due.
6389000	6391000	Just have the Guardian Legend collection.
6391000	6393000	It's just Guardian Legend.
6393000	6395000	I know they have Guardic, but...
6395000	6398000	Why not? Guardic and Guardian Legend. I'm here about that.
6398000	6402000	So, Namco Museum 3, you out there?
6402000	6404000	Y'all out there? Work on that.
6404000	6406000	I don't know. If you got Legacy of the Wizard,
6406000	6408000	then maybe you own the rights to that one, too.
6408000	6410000	I don't know, but get on it.
6410000	6413000	I'll shut up now. Let's move on. Loki.
6414000	6425000	Alright. So, apparently there's a leaked copy of a build of Dead Island 2 from 2015
6425000	6428000	that has been out there on the internets now.
6428000	6433000	It looked kind of cool. It's still definitely a work in progress.
6433000	6436000	Lots of placeholder assets in the game,
6436000	6439000	but it kind of gave you an idea of what the gameplay looked like,
6439000	6442000	which is very different from the original Dead Island,
6442000	6444000	from what I remember.
6444000	6447000	Definitely way over the top with the different weapons,
6447000	6449000	like saw blade launchers and stuff like that.
6449000	6457000	Almost kind of like that Far Cry 5 game that they just put out recently.
6458000	6462000	Interesting. I don't know how I can play said a thing,
6462000	6465000	because this has obviously been leaked out there,
6465000	6468000	and I don't know where you can download it.
6468000	6473000	But it is interesting to see how there's even some developers that worked on it
6473000	6476000	talking about some of the stuff that was in there.
6476000	6481000	Neat. But I don't know, will I ever see the full Dead Island 2 game?
6481000	6483000	Or did they even cancel it? I can't remember.
6483000	6486000	I don't even know if they ever officially canceled it.
6486000	6489000	I remember seeing this at the last E3 I went to.
6489000	6490000	It was like in 2014.
6490000	6494000	It was a long time ago, and I sort of remember the trailer for it,
6494000	6498000	but man, it's like, I don't know.
6498000	6501000	Oh yeah, leaked on 4chan. Of course. Why not?
6501000	6503000	That's where all the other leaks have been coming from.
6503000	6504000	Whatever.
6504000	6509000	So I thought though there was a rumor that somebody else had taken it over
6509000	6511000	and that they had kind of restarted development,
6511000	6513000	so I'm not sure the game is truly dead,
6513000	6517000	but we might be looking at a Duke Nukem Forever kind of situation.
6517000	6519000	For better or for worse.
6519000	6521000	It looks cool though. I mean, I don't know.
6521000	6522000	I don't know.
6522000	6523000	I'd be down.
6523000	6525000	There was like, even earlier this week,
6525000	6530000	there was another video that was out there of an old Marvel Avengers game
6530000	6531000	that they were supposed to use.
6531000	6534000	I don't remember who was working on that, but it was a wild guy.
6534000	6536000	Oh yeah, I saw that too. I saw that too.
6536000	6537000	Yeah, it was THQ.
6537000	6538000	It looked okay.
6538000	6539000	It was THQ.
6539000	6540000	But it looked okay.
6540000	6545000	I would have played that, but obviously there's the new Avengers game now,
6545000	6547000	which I don't know.
6547000	6548000	We'll see.
6548000	6551000	But it's neat to see these games that kind of get cancelled.
6551000	6554000	I don't know if this is ever coming out.
6554000	6557000	Obviously, if it does come out, it's going to look nothing like this,
6557000	6559000	but it's still neat.
6559000	6561000	I wanted to ask you about this actually, Loki,
6561000	6563000	because speaking of like, you know,
6563000	6565000	Oh, I guess it is cancelled from what it says here.
6565000	6569000	It says the Jaeger team, it says that your boss, Timo Ullman,
6569000	6573000	said when it was revealed that Dead Island 2 was cancelled.
6573000	6574000	Oh, bummer.
6575000	6579000	I wanted to ask you about this because I didn't talk about it during my gaming week,
6579000	6583000	but I finally bought a game from the Epic Game Store because of the sale,
6583000	6586000	and somebody pointing out to me that I don't have to give them my credit card
6586000	6588000	because I can use PayPal as an intermediary.
6588000	6593000	So I double dipped on Tetris Effect, and I bought it for like 17 bucks.
6593000	6597000	First off, worth it because Tetris Effect in 4K,
6597000	6600000	I mean, Tetris Effect in VR is great, but Tetris Effect in 4K, also great.
6600000	6603000	So now it's like I can choose which way to play.
6603000	6604000	So it's great.
6604000	6606000	But when I was on the Epic Game Store, I also noticed,
6606000	6609000	oh yes, they're pushing this Saints Row 3 remaster thing,
6609000	6613000	and I was like, oh, I should ask Loki if he has jumped on board with that yet,
6613000	6614000	or you're waiting, or what.
6614000	6617000	I was going to, but it was 40 dollars.
6617000	6621000	And it's like, I probably, well, let me guess.
6621000	6622000	Wait for Black Friday.
6622000	6624000	30. It'd be technically 30 dollars.
6624000	6628000	So they gave me 10 bucks for downloading a free copy of Grand Theft Auto.
6628000	6633000	So, I mean, I could do it.
6633000	6634000	It looked interesting.
6634000	6638000	I'm going to wait for a sale because I haven't played Saints Row 3 in a while.
6638000	6643000	And I just got the 4 remaster not too long ago.
6643000	6647000	So I don't really need to do this right away.
6647000	6649000	All right. Fair enough.
6649000	6650000	All right.
6650000	6654000	Well, moving on to one more story we have on the list tonight about Pokemon Go
6654000	6656000	and a new feature that's coming out for Pokemon Go.
6656000	6659000	I don't know how many of you out there are still playing Pokemon Go.
6659000	6663000	I am. I did enough of those quests.
6663000	6667000	Like, I did the quest every week where I unlocked the special quest for free,
6667000	6671000	where I'm stuck on doing 15 raids right now.
6671000	6673000	Well, I was going to say, speaking of Pokemon Go,
6673000	6676000	I know that you accidentally chatted in the wrong chat room,
6676000	6681000	but I found out from you that Ingress has that new drone feature or whatever.
6681000	6683000	That's kind of cool.
6683000	6687000	Yeah. Actually, let me come back to that because the Ingress drone thing is actually
6687000	6689000	the best thing to happen in a game in a long time.
6689000	6690000	Let me come back to that, though.
6690000	6691000	First, Pokemon Go.
6691000	6692000	Let's talk about the game everybody knows.
6692000	6694000	Then we'll talk about the game no one knows.
6694000	6696000	So first, Pokemon Go.
6696000	6698000	They are going to be doing some new updates they announced.
6698000	6702000	They're going to be allowing you to do stickers on gifts.
6702000	6706000	So when you send gifts to friends, you can put a little sticker on it.
6706000	6708000	Okay. Cute, I guess.
6708000	6711000	But it adds to the collectability factor, and some people will be into it.
6711000	6714000	Maybe kids. Maybe adults, too. I don't know.
6714000	6716000	But that's a cute little feature.
6716000	6718000	But then the other one that has a lot of people talking is about
6718000	6721000	inviting friends to remote raid battles,
6721000	6725000	and that isn't necessarily one where you have to necessarily be there.
6725000	6727000	So what will happen when the feature goes live,
6727000	6729000	a plus button will appear in a raid lobby,
6729000	6732000	and you can invite up to five friends to join you,
6732000	6735000	and they will get a pop-up on their screen,
6735000	6738000	and then that will allow your friends to all enter the raid lobby
6738000	6741000	so they don't have to be right there in range.
6741000	6743000	That's going to be a game changer.
6743000	6744000	That's pretty cool, yeah.
6744000	6746000	Because I could be like,
6746000	6748000	Shane, there's an Oshawott nearby.
6748000	6750000	Do you want to raid it with me?
6750000	6752000	And I could invite him even though he lives in another state,
6752000	6754000	and we could raid it.
6754000	6757000	So as an example, that is really cool,
6757000	6759000	and I'm really excited about that.
6759000	6762000	So I'm curious to see what changes that brings,
6762000	6764000	because now maybe our Discord chat that we have,
6764000	6767000	because of course we do have a Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord,
6767000	6770000	and we have a Pokemon Go channel,
6770000	6773000	because there's enough people that are into Pokemon Go to talk about it.
6773000	6775000	I wonder if pretty soon it's not going to turn into,
6775000	6778000	hey, like Act Deft will say,
6778000	6781000	hey, there's a small group of us in Mexico that want to raid,
6781000	6782000	but we need a few more.
6782000	6783000	Can I invite some of you?
6783000	6785000	And you could actually do that.
6785000	6786000	I think that sounds really cool.
6786000	6789000	So I can't wait to see the implementation of this.
6789000	6793000	We'll see what comes of that.
6793000	6796000	Now let's talk about the game that nobody plays.
6796000	6800000	So Ingress implemented what's called the drone this week,
6800000	6804000	and so what it is is at first face value,
6804000	6807000	it looks like that it just allows you to hack portals
6807000	6809000	anywhere in your scanner's range,
6809000	6811000	kind of like how Pokemon allows you to raid,
6811000	6814000	but it actually put in this whole new metagame.
6814000	6817000	Have you played with a metagame at all, Loki?
6817000	6818000	No.
6818000	6820000	So, okay, so what happens,
6820000	6822000	let's say I take my drone,
6822000	6823000	and I'm going to start,
6823000	6825000	and let's say I start it from my house,
6825000	6829000	and I have to deploy it at a portal within my scanner range.
6829000	6832000	So I'm going to go deploy it at the park that's near here.
6832000	6834000	So I deploy it there at the park.
6834000	6836000	You can hack one portal,
6836000	6838000	and then there will be an hour-long cooldown
6838000	6841000	while your drone is there at that portal.
6841000	6846000	If the enemy faction comes by and destroys that portal,
6846000	6849000	or the portal's polarity changes in any fashion,
6849000	6852000	the drone is basically destroyed and returned to you.
6852000	6855000	But no big deal, right, because I just send it out again.
6855000	6857000	But here's the twist.
6857000	6860000	When you move the drone after an hour,
6860000	6862000	you're not moving it from your location,
6862000	6865000	you're moving it from the drone's location.
6865000	6868000	So now you pick a new portal to move to
6868000	6872000	somewhere in the drone's scanner range.
6872000	6874000	So you're portal hopping.
6874000	6878000	So right now, I'm not hacking the portals near my house.
6878000	6883000	I am about three miles down the main thoroughfare I live near,
6883000	6886000	hopping from portal to portal down the entire street right now.
6886000	6890000	So my drone is three miles from here in another city right now.
6890000	6892000	Can you link from those as well?
6892000	6894000	No, you can only hack.
6894000	6896000	So you can't play the whole game,
6896000	6899000	but I like the whole fact that the drone destroying thing,
6899000	6902000	and you don't know, I hope they put it in at some point,
6902000	6904000	that you'll know if you killed somebody's drone,
6904000	6906000	because right now you can't see if somebody's drone is on a portal
6906000	6907000	or anything like that.
6907000	6909000	If it gets back to you, it gets back to you.
6909000	6913000	But they put in some new badges for unique portals hacked by your drone
6913000	6916000	and furthest drone flight you've obtained.
6916000	6919000	So I'm up to like four kilometers on my drone flight right now.
6919000	6921000	And as soon as the show's over,
6921000	6924000	I'm going to keep hopping down the thoroughfare and see how far I get.
6924000	6927000	So it's an interesting new meta.
6927000	6929000	It doesn't change the existing game,
6929000	6931000	but I like the whole fact that it's like,
6931000	6933000	ooh, I'm going to sneak this drone around
6933000	6936000	and try to rack up these statistics and some gear.
6936000	6939000	And maybe if you don't want to do a travel thing,
6939000	6941000	you could leave your drone at a farm
6941000	6944000	and just keep circling the portals at the farm once an hour
6944000	6946000	and get gear that way.
6946000	6947000	That's cool, yeah.
6947000	6950000	It's an interesting little twist on the game,
6950000	6952000	so I applaud Niantic for it.
6952000	6954000	Niantic's done a lot of good shit this week.
6954000	6956000	They really, really have.
6956000	6959000	You've got to give credit where that's due, that's for sure.
6959000	6960000	All right.
6960000	6963000	Well, this brings us into the listener roundtable with our chat room.
6963000	6965000	So if you guys have anything you'd like to discuss
6965000	6968000	or bring up on the show, please feel free.
6968000	6970000	Sadly, during this remote recording time,
6970000	6972000	we're not really inviting the calls on Discord
6972000	6975000	just because it screws up all the images and things like that,
6975000	6977000	but we are definitely curious to hear your thoughts.
6977000	6979000	If you have anything you want to say, you can put that in the chat room.
6979000	6982000	If you're feeling too shy tonight or you're listening on the podcast feed,
6982000	6985000	of course, you can always tweet us, at OLR.
6985000	6988000	You can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6988000	6990000	Excuse me, that was the wrong email address.
6990000	6992000	I don't know why I gave the seven-year-old email address.
6992000	6997000	The correct email address is participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6997000	7002000	We haven't used that email address in like seven years.
7002000	7004000	Anyway, participate at orangeloungeradio.com
7004000	7007000	is the place to send emails, and we will read them on the air.
7007000	7010000	I will blame the surgery, the anesthesia, and the pain pills
7010000	7013000	for my inability to recall things right now.
7013000	7017000	Loki, while we wait to see if anybody in our chat has something to say,
7017000	7019000	do you have any last-minute stories for us?
7020000	7022000	Can I ask this? What's your background?
7022000	7025000	I didn't ask it earlier in the show.
7025000	7028000	So, my background is because this VCam software,
7028000	7037000	you can use just like a picture, or you can use a YouTube video.
7037000	7041000	So, I just have a YouTube video with just stuff looping.
7041000	7043000	So, it's looping the same two-minute video.
7043000	7046000	So, what's kind of funny, though, is like I wanted to show you
7046000	7050000	I have this video, it's like a video game study lounge radio,
7050000	7053000	or something like that, and I used that on when I was doing
7053000	7057000	the game development streams and stuff as background music,
7057000	7060000	but it has a lot of text in it, and it reverses it,
7060000	7062000	and there's no way to tell it not to do that.
7062000	7065000	And so, I didn't like the way it looked,
7065000	7069000	so I put this because there's not much text in there.
7069000	7072000	Oh, actually, no, wait. No, it doesn't reverse it.
7072000	7073000	Dang it.
7073000	7075000	Oh, actually, no, wait. No, it doesn't reverse it.
7075000	7076000	Dang it.
7076000	7079000	Okay, so reverse, I hate that with like all these Zoom and stuff
7079000	7081000	where it reverses it when you look at your screen,
7081000	7084000	but it's not actually reversed in the video, so.
7084000	7086000	I seriously thought, looking at your background,
7086000	7089000	I was looking at like a Sierra On-Line adventure game.
7089000	7091000	I was like, is that a Leisure Suit Larry game?
7091000	7092000	What is that?
7092000	7093000	Because that would be a very you thing to do.
7093000	7095000	No, no, no. It's like a shop or something.
7095000	7096000	All right.
7096000	7099000	So, a question from Garth the Wolf in chat.
7099000	7102000	Just joined, so I apologize if you mentioned this already,
7102000	7105000	but Rob, have you picked up Nier Automata again?
7105000	7107000	I haven't. I'm sorry.
7107000	7109000	I need to get back to it. It's on my list.
7109000	7114000	But in my defense, I picked up a RPG that people are equally obsessed with,
7114000	7118000	Xenoblade Chronicles, and I'm making my way through that on Switch right now,
7118000	7121000	and I'm kind of loving it, so please forgive me.
7121000	7126000	I've put one RPG on the back burner for another.
7128000	7129000	Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says,
7129000	7132000	My wife went to rest, but thanks so much for all the kind words.
7132000	7133000	See, Rob did it too.
7133000	7135000	You're welcome. Anytime.
7135000	7139000	Nothing but love here at OLR for all of you guys.
7139000	7140000	Act Def says,
7140000	7145000	So what do you guys expect on the eventual PlayStation 5 event?
7146000	7148000	Well, we don't know when it's going to happen now at this point.
7148000	7152000	Obviously, they're kind of waiting for, I mean, it's a weird line to walk
7152000	7159000	because I don't think the calls to address racial equality
7159000	7161000	and things that we need to address in this country,
7161000	7164000	I don't think those things are going to die down anytime soon.
7164000	7169000	They shouldn't. Until we have change, this has to be a momentum we keep going.
7169000	7175000	So I'm not sure when Sony will find the appropriate time again,
7175000	7178000	but I think we'll try to find that kind of balance between
7178000	7184000	we're going to have these discussions and we can continue to talk about video games.
7185000	7188000	So I would imagine Sony does that later this month,
7190000	7194000	but they probably have to play it by ears by what goes on in the national news.
7198000	7202000	Trump could do something stupid and this whole thing goes on longer,
7202000	7203000	like, loudly longer.
7203000	7205000	Trump could do something smart and resign
7205000	7209000	and that could take over the conversation for a little while, too.
7209000	7211000	I know it won't, but I'm just saying you never know.
7211000	7213000	A broken clock's wrong twice a day, right?
7213000	7215000	So we'll see.
7218000	7220000	Garth the Wolf does say, I forgive you.
7220000	7222000	Persona 5 Royal has been taking my time.
7222000	7226000	All right, well, let's say the PlayStation 5 event happens next week,
7226000	7227000	even though I doubt it does.
7227000	7230000	What are you going to expect to see from that event, Loki?
7232000	7234000	I don't know. Not gameplay.
7234000	7240000	I mean, gameplay will receive that, but it won't be actual gameplay.
7242000	7244000	Hopefully something exciting.
7244000	7245000	Like, I don't know.
7246000	7251000	I don't really know what to expect because like there's obviously Last of Us 2 is going to be coming up,
7251000	7254000	but that's not necessarily PlayStation 5.
7254000	7257000	I mean, I guess it could have like an enhanced version of that stuff,
7257000	7259000	but I'm hoping to see new things.
7259000	7263000	I mean, it's all going to be new franchises or new entries in franchises, I would hope.
7264000	7266000	And I don't know.
7266000	7269000	I don't know what to expect from it, and I guess that's good,
7269000	7273000	but like I don't really have like a huge stake in the game for either console.
7273000	7275000	I just want to see some like good games out of it.
7275000	7281000	And so far, like, I don't know that it's been very like, I don't know what these are.
7282000	7286000	Yeah, there's some gameplay footage or gameplay footage, you know,
7287000	7289000	but I don't know what half of it is.
7289000	7293000	Really, it's whoever has Ridge Racers who I'm going to be most excited about.
7293000	7298000	I think like any typical E3 press conference we're used to,
7298000	7301000	which is essentially what this is going to be of sorts,
7301000	7305000	I think there will be a mix of pre-rendered trailers that just show off ooh, prettiness.
7305000	7309000	And I think you'll see like Gran Turismo 7 featuring in-game footage.
7309000	7311000	I think you are going to see like some of that.
7311000	7316000	I think we will see one or two games that get a deep dive and they do actually show gameplay
7316000	7319000	because even at E3 on the main stage, they usually do that.
7319000	7322000	There'll be one game, one or two games, they take a deep dive.
7322000	7329000	And my gut tells me Horizon Zero Dawn Part 2 or whatever's coming next in the A-list story.
7329000	7332000	I think that is going to be your show-offy game.
7333000	7335000	I think we all know that's coming.
7335000	7337000	I think there's a big call for it.
7337000	7340000	I think it's something that's going to look really good on the PlayStation 5.
7340000	7342000	I think it's something a lot of people are going to get behind.
7342000	7347000	And that's the one that my gut tells me they're going to really show off a Horizon Zero Dawn Part 2.
7348000	7352000	I agree with what Tigerclaw is saying in chat with...
7352000	7356000	Hopefully they demonstrate the power of having this new SSD built into the system
7356000	7358000	and what it does for in-game load times.
7358000	7365000	I think you will see PlayStation 4 games on PlayStation 5
7365000	7370000	and they're going to use that SSD to kind of show you the difference
7370000	7372000	and show you what games look like.
7372000	7375000	And they're going to use it as an opportunity to remind you of things like
7375000	7382000	Last of Us Part 2, Ghost of Tsushima, and the things that they've been hyping up lately.
7382000	7385000	Final Fantasy 7 Remaster or Remake or whatever will be in there as well.
7385000	7390000	And they're going to kind of show you how these games are better with PlayStation 5.
7390000	7395000	And then I think we are going to get a rich amount of backwards compatibility
7395000	7398000	fucking finally in Sony's universe, right?
7398000	7404000	Because we haven't had it since the OG PlayStation 3s, which were so limited.
7404000	7407000	We haven't seen backwards compatibility truly since then.
7407000	7410000	So I think we're going to get to really see some backwards compatibility
7410000	7415000	in how PlayStation 2 games act, how PlayStation 3 games act, and so on.
7415000	7423000	And I'm going to be so fucking happy if my PlayStation 2 discs just work in a PlayStation 5.
7423000	7426000	And after all these years just sitting on those games,
7426000	7430000	I'm going to reap the benefits of holding on to those games and they're going to work on the PlayStation 5.
7430000	7436000	I will be so fucking happy if that digital library that I've built up on PlayStation 3 over the years
7436000	7439000	is just going to be there on PlayStation 5 the first day.
7439000	7442000	Just imagine, it's probably going to be an expensive system,
7442000	7447000	and I think they're setting the bar that they may be more expensive than Microsoft,
7447000	7449000	but I think they're really going to try to show,
7449000	7457000	hey, day one, you have 100 games available to you because of the library you've built up on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.
7457000	7459000	And I'm fine with that nowadays.
7459000	7462000	I mean, with everybody dropping the kind of money that they do on phones and everything,
7462000	7467000	I wouldn't be surprised if it's that expensive.
7467000	7468000	I just would like that information.
7468000	7471000	I know we're not going to get that information anytime soon.
7471000	7473000	It's probably not until the fall at least.
7473000	7476000	We will know prices and dates and that kind of thing.
7477000	7483000	I just would like to see what they're going to offer me as far as, yeah, I know the tech specs and stuff,
7483000	7486000	but that doesn't mean anything to me until I see what the gameplay is going to be like.
7486000	7491000	I'd like to know more about their controller that they showed off because it just looks like the last controller,
7491000	7497000	but I know that they've done other things to it that make it unique, so show me that.
7497000	7502000	I want to address some comments in chat here because a lot of people are lighting up about the backwards compatibility.
7502000	7506000	SDG100Matt says, that may be a system seller for me in regards to the backwards compatibility.
7506000	7511000	Tigerclass says, it would be great if a PlayStation 3 disc works on the PlayStation 5 as well. Absolutely.
7511000	7516000	ActDef says, if they actually do backwards compatibility like that, buying day one.
7516000	7519000	And PixelPaka says, PlayStation 2 would be my dream.
7519000	7522000	And why stop there? Let's go all the way back to the original PlayStation.
7522000	7523000	I would be so thrilled.
7523000	7529000	And I feel like Sony may be hearing that message, and if they really can put it out there like that,
7529000	7534000	where it's like, bam, it all works, that is going to be huge, I think.
7534000	7538000	And there could even be a message beyond that.
7538000	7544000	We have worked for 20 years to get to this point, and you've worked for 20 years to get to this point,
7544000	7547000	and now it's all available to you on PlayStation 5.
7547000	7550000	And you're going to have to work another 20 years to pay this console off.
7550000	7555000	Now SheHulk10 in chat says, if they don't, it is the end of PlayStation.
7555000	7564000	I agree. However, we do know that Sony is doing at least PlayStation 4 backwards compatibility.
7564000	7570000	That is a fact. They're showing off the PlayStation 5 using PS4 Spider-Man to show some of the SSD.
7570000	7573000	They've already openly talked about PlayStation 4 backwards compatibility.
7573000	7577000	So the good news is, there is some backwards compatibility.
7577000	7583000	We just don't know, is it only a little bit, or is it like Rob's dream scenario he just explained
7583000	7585000	that a lot of you seem to be excited about, too?
7585000	7588000	Like, on what scale is Sony going to land on with that?
7588000	7590000	And I'm crossing my fingers.
7590000	7592000	All right, let's get one more comment here.
7592000	7598000	Garth the Wolf in chat says, Rob, I'm finally getting Shadowbringers, but need to play through Stormblood as well.
7598000	7600000	What server do you play on for Final Fantasy XIV now?
7600000	7603000	No promises I can migrate to it, but I'm curious.
7603000	7608000	I play on Cactuar, and I don't see myself leaving anytime soon because I have a house there.
7608000	7611000	And trying to get a house in the game is impossible.
7611000	7612000	So that's the server I play on.
7612000	7613000	That's the Aether data.
7613000	7617000	Really, the data center is most important because you can play with anybody on the data center.
7617000	7621000	It says Aether, so it's the same cluster as Gilgamesh, McGarsummer, Faerie.
7621000	7623000	There's a lot of big servers in that cluster.
7623000	7627000	So, Dark Tetsuya talking about the backwards compatibility.
7627000	7629000	Isn't Microsoft already kind of doing that?
7629000	7632000	Hopefully, Sony will try to follow suit.
7632000	7634000	Dark Tetsuya, yes they are.
7634000	7639000	So I think that's why it is important for Sony to be able to beat or exceed that.
7639000	7648000	Because as cool as it is that Microsoft's doing it, PlayStation goes back even further than Microsoft with the PlayStation 1.
7648000	7655000	And in some regards, I mean PlayStation 2 and Xbox are kind of from the same generation, but I think the libraries on those consoles are very different.
7655000	7664000	So I think if Sony can say we've included PlayStation and PlayStation 2, they'll have the bragging rights to an even richer library than Xbox does.
7664000	7668000	But not to knock what Xbox is doing, because I'm very excited about what Xbox is doing.
7668000	7672000	And I love their approach, and I can't wait to see what they have to say about cloud gaming.
7672000	7677000	So it's an exciting time to be a gamer. It really is.
7677000	7681000	And in the coming weeks, we're going to get to see more and more about what's going to be happening.
7681000	7686000	All right, I guess with that, if you have no other last minute stories, Loki?
7687000	7690000	I was going to say just reminders because of all these different dates.
7690000	7694000	So we have all these digital events that are happening relatively soon.
7694000	7697000	Maybe a little bit later because of the events going on in the world.
7697000	7704000	But the next one that's supposed to be happening, though, is June 8th, which is the IGN Expo.
7704000	7710000	So they're supposed to be showing off some games tomorrow to actually see.
7710000	7713000	I don't know what they're going to be showing.
7713000	7717000	I'm sorry, is that still scheduled for tomorrow? Because I thought I heard they bumped some of that back.
7717000	7721000	Or was that stuff that was already scheduled this weekend that got bumped back?
7721000	7723000	It was stuff that was scheduled this weekend that got bumped back.
7723000	7728000	So it was supposed to be on the 5th, I think, and then it got bumped to the 8th.
7728000	7732000	They're also supposed to be having something happen on June 9th as well.
7732000	7737000	So it's supposed to be three days of digital stuff.
7737000	7739000	But I guess it's going to be starting on June 8th.
7739000	7741000	So we'll at least have some stuff that will be showing off this week.
7741000	7746000	One of the games, apparently, that they've talked about already that they're going to be showing is Samurai Jack Battle through time.
7746000	7753000	And then apparently they've got some announcements from Funcom and Merge Games and new trailers and whatnot.
7753000	7756000	So I guess we'll have to wait and see what that is.
7756000	7768000	And then, let's see, the next thing after that is probably not going to be until the following week with the PC Gamer Show and Guerrilla Collective on the 13th.
7769000	7771000	And, yeah, both on the 13th.
7771000	7775000	Yeah, I mean, this week would have been E3 week.
7775000	7778000	So it's going to be really interesting to see what it looks like now.
7778000	7783000	I mean, obviously, everything we talked about at the beginning of the show tonight is huge.
7783000	7786000	Like, you know, what's appropriate, what's not appropriate right now.
7786000	7790000	But even before that, COVID-19 and the effect that that was going to have,
7790000	7797000	I mean, this is just, it's going to be a very interesting year for the news cycle and how we get teased with the fall announcements and all of that.
7797000	7799000	So buckle up, everybody.
7801000	7802000	All right.
7802000	7804000	Well, with all of that, I think it's time to end the show.
7804000	7813000	I know we're done a little early tonight, but this obviously with all the announcements getting pushed back and a lot of things were getting targeted for this next week anyway.
7813000	7814000	There just wasn't as much news.
7814000	7817000	We had some other bigger issues we need to spend a good chunk of the show talking about.
7817000	7819000	I'm sure you all understand.
7819000	7821000	But I really appreciate you guys being here.
7821000	7823000	Really appreciate all the kind words.
7823000	7828000	I've seen some, I will acknowledge the bit donations and the follows and all that good stuff after the show.
7828000	7830000	I just want to say I see you.
7830000	7831000	I acknowledge you.
7831000	7839000	And even the people that we don't see on Sunday nights who listen on the podcast feed just know how much we all appreciate you being there and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
7839000	7840000	It means the lot.
7840000	7841000	It means a lot.
7841000	7848000	And let's just, you know, if I could, I guess, I guess snowballing this into my final thought a little bit, I'll say the line I always say,
7848000	7851000	if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
7851000	7853000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7853000	7855000	We want to bring those voices to the table.
7855000	7864000	And I guess like along with that, I would say, you know, that sense of the support that you show to us.
7864000	7872000	Let's make sure we're showing that support to each other and our black friends and family in this time.
7872000	7873000	Show that support to each other.
7873000	7875000	It's so important and so necessary.
7875000	7883000	And this is just me sending you guys a big, big hug and all of our black family that's out there listening.
7883000	7887000	And I'm going to do my very best to support you the best I can and be a good ally for you.
7887000	7889000	And I hope my actions will show that.
7889000	7891000	So that's my final thought.
7891000	7893000	Loki, your final thought?
7893000	7904000	My final thought is going to be me playing more games this week, especially since I bought that bundle of 700 some games and I don't even know what's in that.
7904000	7910000	I know there's game assets in there too and board games and books and comics and a bunch of other stuff.
7910000	7911000	So check it out.
7911000	7913000	It's been scrolling along the bottom throughout tonight's show.
7913000	7914000	It's the itch.io.
7914000	7916000	So I hope you all have checked that out for sure.
7916000	7917000	For sure.
7917000	7918000	So yeah.
7918000	7923000	Five dollars at the very least for 700 games, you know, and other things.
7923000	7924000	But it's a great cause.
7924000	7927000	So if you can bump it up to 10, 15, 20, 25.
7927000	7928000	Absolutely.
7928000	7929000	Bump it up a little. Bump it up a little.
7929000	7930000	All right.
7930000	7932000	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lodge Radio.
7932000	7934000	Thank you guys for being here.
7934000	7935000	Appreciate you all.
7935000	7937000	We will see you next week.
7937000	7938000	That's it.
7938000	7941000	We'll see you in seven days and we'll see what video game news there is to discuss.
7941000	7943000	Thank you, Loki, for staying here with me throughout the whole show.
7943000	7945000	And thanks, of course, to Dark Soccer, even though she had to leave early.
7945000	7947000	And thanks to you all.
7947000	7948000	Each and every one of you all.
7948000	7952000	Happy gaming this week.
7952000	7953000	And yeah.
7953000	7954000	I don't know.
7954000	7955000	I don't know what else to say.
7955000	7958000	Just big, big hugs for everybody and thinking all you guys this week.
7958000	7959000	Take care.
