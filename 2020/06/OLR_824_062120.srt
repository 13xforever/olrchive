00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You know, I had a good last week. A new X-Week and Pokemon Snap release were announced, and that excites me. It's a long wait for them to get here, but Introvert's E3 week was great to me. These are just two games in a week of exciting news. Stay tuned for the rest, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 824 of our show for this June the 21st of 2020.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Happy Father's Day to everybody out there who's celebrating today. Happy Father's Day to all my favorite daddies out there, including a father right here on Orange Lounge Radio. Say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki, joining me thanks to the magic of Discord.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hello, how's it going?

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good, how are you, Loki?

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm fine.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Good.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm tangling myself from chords.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's understandable. It's like sometimes the tech stuff ends up like a box of Christmas lights. Not joining us tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. She is taking the night off to take care of some other things, but she will be joining us next week.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Next week after all is episode number 825, and it happens to be our birthday show, which this is this is the 2020s just been a strange year and obviously these are these are interesting times that we're in right now and it feels a little weird to be celebrating and all of that but 18 years is a very long time.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:02:07,000
825 which will be next week's episode is a very roundish number. So yeah, we'll be kind of celebrating a little bit of that stuff next week we've been we've been working on some stuff under the hood that I was hoping would be more of a we're going to return to the studio and we're going to kind of have a soft relaunch while we're all here together again and studio again but then now all these COVID things are back on the rise where we live in California and and in many other places too.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I have a feeling these discord magic episodes are probably going to continue for quite some time. So there it is. But anyway, what the heck are you playing behind you this week Loki What is that running? I mean, I realized those in the podcast can't see video but those on Twitch can. What is that that you're running behind yourself there's Oh, is that Kirby?

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're muted, buddy. Don't forget to unmute. Sorry, it's still the same thing as last week. It's a I would say it's a video game study radio by game chops radio. So it's like this like kind of lo fi like video game remix stream thing that I put on but they always have these like looping random video game animated gifs so I just thought I did see if I dodge out of the way here.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, all right. Props to them. Props to them. Okay. And I see many people in chatter recognizing like Kirby 64. Again, a shout out for our chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and several folks act FC very recognizing Kirby 64 there, SSG100 Matt saying the show can legally vote now, which by the way, vote.

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, sadly, I can't register the show to vote. We all know that would be a bad thing. But myself, Loki and dark soccer certainly are registered to vote. And I hope all of you guys are as well. In fact, I think on our ticker bar at the bottom live on Twitch, it even reminds you like how to register, which is vote.gov. It's very, very easy to get that process started. So if you are a legal age, 18 to vote in the US, and in fact, I think if you're going to be 18 by the end of the year, you're going to be 18 by the end of the year.

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So if you are a legal age, 18 to vote in the US, and in fact, I think if you're going to be 18 by the next election, in some states, you can register now all the rules and all that good stuff is over at vote.gov.

20
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So anyway, uh, it is Father's Day. Of course, as I was saying at the top of the show, have you have you been able to do anything kind of special today, Loki and with the holiday or

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I you muted again. I don't know why.

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's okay. Because I have kids yelling in the background. So I, I went out and cleaned gutters.

23
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And then I got pizza from Roundtable.

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, well, that's okay. Like, wow. What a riveting day. You got to go out and clean the gutters.

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, but Roundtable.

26
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And then aside from that, you know, I've been playing Minecraft, like most of the weekend. Okay, that's good, too. That's a good reward. That's nice.

27
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right. So let's get into some video game news. And this week is kind of the continuing of E3 that didn't really happen this year.

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So we get all these other kind of random things that are popping up over the next few months instead.

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So one of the big groups or one of the big companies that would always have a big press event during E3 week would be EA.

30
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So we got their event last week or this last week. Right, Loki?

31
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's correct. So they were showing off some pretty cool stuff, one of which we've already were teased because it leaked out anyways.

32
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And so that was the brand new Star Wars game, which looks pretty awesome.

33
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So Star Wars Squadrons, it's going to be a five on five flight sim game, basically.

34
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And so they showed off some actual gameplay of that and it looks pretty amazing.

35
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And it's supposed to be coming out later this October.

36
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, it's one thing to know the title and hear that it got leaked, but it's another one to really see it in motion and all the things they have planned for it.

37
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It looks pretty cool.

38
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, so it does look pretty awesome.

39
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And so it's going to be coming out, like I said, around October so far, unless it gets delayed.

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then they announced some additional things, including Apex Legends is coming to Switch and Steam this fall.

41
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And there's supposed to be some sort of cross play with that as well.

42
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And then they're doing a new event, Lost Treasures, which is starting this week.

43
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So that's pretty cool.

44
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A lot of Switch fans going to be very happy about that one.

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Although I imagine like Overwatch, it's not going to look quite as crisp as the PlayStation 4 version or the Xbox One version.

46
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But it's going to be portable, at least within your own home, because that game kind of requires an internet connection.

47
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But still, that portability of sorts of the game is going to be a huge asset.

48
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And remember when portability meant you were playing like the Game Boy port of Mortal Kombat, which I think was just straight up missing characters?

49
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah. So like, you know, a tiny little loss in graphics is probably not going to be a big deal for a lot of Nintendo fans to be able to play Apex Legends, which is free anyway.

50
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So what do you got to lose, right?

51
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Right. And so it did like, I mean, I haven't really played Apex, but it's cool to see it come to other consoles and stuff.

52
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So that's neat. I mean, everybody's been kind of porting different things over to the Switch, so it's about time they got more stuff.

53
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, and the fact that this is EA as well is, you know, and this is a title like Apex Legends, which has performed incredibly well for them.

54
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think the fact that this is coming over to the Switch when EA, just this last round when Nintendo with the Wii U kind of left Nintendo at the altar, really.

55
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I mean, you know, EA promised all these big things. They delivered a few of them when the console first came out the gate.

56
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But because these, you know, year old, two year old ports didn't perform well out the gate, when I think a big reason why is that they were ports of year and two year old games everybody had already played.

57
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah. Anyway, I don't mean to rehash drama for 10 years ago.

58
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No, no, no, I completely agree. Yeah, you're right. You know, the strategy of porting over old games to the Switch is just not a good one, which is why they're going to do it some more.

59
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And so they've got, of course, Burnout Paradise Remastered, which is coming out as well, or already came out.

60
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And then they have seven more games coming over to the Switch from EA ports, and that's going to be over the next 12 months.

61
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So they haven't learned a thing.

62
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, these are not going to perform at the levels EA is hoping for.

63
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Apex is different because it's free.

64
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Apex will do fine. So I hope there's something, I'll probably download Apex on the Switch, but I hope there's something in there that EA can kind of see, you know.

65
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well then, and then so they did show off another multiplayer game as well.

66
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a game called Rocket Arena, which doesn't look all that original.

67
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's basically, it's like an FPS, almost like an Overwatch type looking game, but it's, you know, it's from EA.

68
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And so they're going to have that coming out now with cross play on July 14th.

69
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And that's coming to all different platforms.

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I honestly couldn't get excited about that trailer at all.

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Although EA embracing the cross play kind of initiative that, you know, we've really come a long way with that in the last two years.

72
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And the fact that EA seems to really be embracing that and putting that in more of their games, that a nice, a polite golf clap for that.

73
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, yeah, I'm glad that that happens because I know like, was it today?

74
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Even I was trying to get my because, you know, with Minecraft, it's all the bedrock edition.

75
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's supposed to be cross play across all platforms.

76
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
PlayStation 4, I swear to God, it just doesn't want to work.

77
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It does not want to work with any of them.

78
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You can't see any of your friends online.

79
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can't play with other people.

80
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can't access the realms that are in there.

81
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm surprised with it being this announcement was almost it was over six months ago that they had added that bedrock addition to PlayStation 4.

82
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And they still haven't resolved all that stuff yet.

83
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's just ridiculous.

84
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I hope that's not the same with other games across EA and stuff.

85
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I hope they're not running the same problems.

86
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But I would think a company like Microsoft or Mojang should be able to be able to handle that.

87
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And I have a feeling that Sony is the one that's kind of dragging their feet.

88
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, admittedly, I haven't tried a lot of games with cross play.

89
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I mean, the only one that I play on an extremely regular basis is Final Fantasy 14, which is really seamless with PlayStation 4 and PC.

90
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But I think that's because it's all just running through Square Enix's servers at the end of the day.

91
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And Microsoft still is not invited to the party for some reason with Final Fantasy 14.

92
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I would have thought for sure that would have been remedied by now.

93
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Maybe it's something we'll hear about in July whenever Microsoft does their big event.

94
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But other than that, there's not a lot.

95
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I guess I've played Rocket League a little bit here and there.

96
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But I don't know if I was playing against people on other consoles.

97
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Right.

98
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And I guess really the only other game was No Man's Sky I was playing last week.

99
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And it was because, you know, it's on Xbox Game Pass now and that is now a multi platform.

100
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But because it's No Man's Sky and it's literally the universe, you don't exactly run across people unless you're like looking for it, especially when you're first starting the game.

101
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, true.

102
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Some other stuff.

103
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So they did show off a lot of like indie games as well on there.

104
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So they had a game called A Way Out.

105
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I'm sorry, not A Way Out.

106
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's called It Takes Two.

107
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's from Hazellight or Hazellight who did A Way Out.

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And so It Takes Two is a co-op adventure platformer.

109
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They did another one called Lost in Random, which was a game from Zoinks or Zoink Games.

110
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Those both look kind of cool, especially the latter, the Lost in Random.

111
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
One thing I wanted to mention about Star Wars Squadrons that was pretty awesome, though, is the campaign apparently is fully playable in VR, which is awesome.

112
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So I'm definitely going to have to check that out.

113
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And that's both on PlayStation and in PC.

114
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So what else?

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Have we seen EA really embrace VR yet?

116
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm trying to think of like other big VR titles EA might have been behind and I'm drawing a blank in the moment.

117
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't think, I can't think of any.

118
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So this is kind of a step for them, unless somebody in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

119
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
OK, see, I knew if anybody would pop in on VR to be Bobby.

120
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Bobby Blackwell says that they did a PSVR mission for a previous Call of Duty.

121
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
OK, so that was like dipping the toe in the water.

122
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Now this is like wading in the pool.

123
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Call of Duty is not EA, Call of Duty is Activision.

124
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So that's not the same.

125
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There is, there is that too.

126
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes, good call.

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And now I know what you're talking about.

128
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, there is.

129
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They did like a VR like it was their futuristic jet thing from Dancewar Fighter or it was a while ago.

130
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Bobby's correcting Battlefront 2.

131
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh, Battlefront 2.

132
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
OK.

133
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah.

134
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

135
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Then they kind of showed off.

136
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They teased a few things from like Criterion, BioWare, DICE and EA Motive and just showed some like in development stuff.

137
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Do you know what they hold up, Loki?

138
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're not just going to go right through that because you know what they didn't tease from BioWare?

139
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You know what wasn't shown from BioWare?

140
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You know what we had no news about from BioWare?

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
A new Dragon Age?

142
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We got, OK, we got like four screenshots of and I don't even think they said it was Dragon Age.

143
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
They were just like this game that we're working on that looks a lot like Dragon Age.

144
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's like we have four screenshots from that and nothing on Mass Effect.

145
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
When it's like the trilogy remaster is the worst kept secret in the industry right now.

146
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm not sure why they unless, heaven forbid, they canceled it, which I swear to God, if they canceled it.

147
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm not going to say anything.

148
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The silence is because I'm making gestures because I'm not going to say anything that's going to get me in trouble on Twitch.

149
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But if they canceled it.

150
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm going to be so mad, so mad.

151
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes. Silent Rage says act out. Perfect. Yes.

152
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They're going to get a game called Silent Rage. That's what they're going to get. That's for sure.

153
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Quest Busters pointing out we still have no idea what Anthem 2.0 is either.

154
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, they've there's still little updates on Anthem here and there, but I don't think they put anything really in the EA Play presentation there.

155
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Quest Buster says there were screenshots of something that could be Dragon Age 4 when they were talking about EA working on new worlds.

156
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Tiger Claw says the question is, do you want a new Mass Effect after what happened with Andromeda?

157
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes. Does that answer surprise you?

158
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Number one, Andromeda wasn't that bad and I wouldn't even say it was bad. Andromeda was undercooked.

159
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So my answer to that is really, yes, I would. I'm I would.

160
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
First, a Mass Effect remaster is going to be very hard to go wrong with because the original trilogy was fucking great.

161
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But if we're talking about a new Mass Effect game, yeah, I'd love to see that happen even after Andromeda.

162
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But please don't release it until it's done.

163
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's all I'm asking. That's the big yes. Make it. I would love a new Mass Effect. Please.

164
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
May I have a new Mass Effect? But just make sure it's done. Make sure it's done. That's all.

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And don't release it on one of those frickin pay a subscription fee to play at 48 hours early thing.

166
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It was a horrible idea. Well, they're going to do that because it's EA.

167
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, it's like they're it's the I don't it's how do I shoot myself in the foot over and over and over again?

168
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
See that system. I don't it boggles my mind why they're they are so stubborn on that.

169
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But the extra money I could possibly make, I need to make all of the money.

170
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Anyway, what else did they I'm over my Bioware moment. What else do they announce?

171
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That was pretty much it. Really? Oh, no, no, it was rather hurt. We're just going to ignore sports.

172
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Just get it. Just ignore the sport. OK, OK, so so so they they've he's skate four.

173
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So that was a big thing. They don't show anything. I realized we don't this isn't the Madden show.

174
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
OK, I realize there's some video games in there to show Madden.

175
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So like, is that really a new thing or was that? No, that was NBA. I don't know.

176
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's also one of those things where it's like, are you really surprised to do that?

177
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's kind of like that are our next gen sports games are being going to be more next gen.

178
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Whoo. Without actually going into details on what it is. So like, I don't know, like.

179
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't find it worth talking about because even doing the details about it.

180
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
S.S. Joe and her mat says way to ignore sports with a crying emoji. Way to go. Way to go, Matt.

181
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You made Matt cry. Way to go. But active playing those games doesn't make you cry enough.

182
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Act after chat says they didn't even mention NHL, though, which I mean now.

183
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
OK, now now that's a good retort because, you know, hockey is the only sport that matters.

184
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That statement will make Matt cry. The only matter if you make them money.

185
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And unfortunately, you know, that doesn't make them a lot of money.

186
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
All right. All right. I'm sure it'll look great.

187
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But like, I don't know, it's it's I can't really get excited about it just because they don't innovate with that.

188
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, they innovate in all the wrong areas. Like, I don't need more grass physics.

189
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I need. But Loki, didn't you not see on the PlayStation five how much sweat we're going to get.

190
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Sweat. OK, more sweat, more real.

191
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So, OK, some folks in chatter piping up on skate, though, because that was a pretty good pretty big announcement.

192
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I mean, yeah, it's exciting that they are in make another skate, obviously, because they see Tony Hawk popular.

193
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's follow up in all these other like independent games getting made that are basically like skate.

194
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And everybody's jumping for joy for that stuff. So they're like, OK, there's some money to be made here.

195
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But honestly, like in and I get it. Maybe if people are just as excited about like the Metro,

196
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Metro Prime 4 announcement where all it was is practically a logo.

197
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I mean, that's basically all we got is like, yep, it's in development. What's it coming out?

198
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No idea. Any details? Nope. Have none of those for you. So I don't know.

199
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I can't get excited about it because one, I didn't play skate and then to no details.

200
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So. All right. Our Twitch chat is lighting up a little bit.

201
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
First off, regarding sweat, some folks are talking about the sweat thing is that Bobby Bickel says they've been zooming in on beads of sweat for two console generations.

202
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The PlayStation three was powerful enough to show sweaty athletes, but Bobby ray traced sweat.

203
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes. You're going to see so much ray traced sweat from your camera. That's about 20 feet back up in the air.

204
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're not going to see any of that detail. It's going to glisten a matter. It's going to glisten on the replays.

205
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Who cares? OK. S2 and her mat with a realistic take here saying in their defense,

206
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
this new partnership with steam is monumental because this opens the door for EA Sports games to come to PC.

207
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Finally, fair point. You know, as much as we might poke fun at things like Madden and so forth, they sell shit tons of copies.

208
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
They're extremely popular games. FIFA is probably the biggest game in the entire world.

209
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
When you look at that perspective, coming out there on PC already.

210
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Is Madden on Steam?

211
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They're on Origin.

212
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
OK. OK. Well, does that really does that really count?

213
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think they've given up. I think that they they looked at their numbers.

214
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They're like, yeah, our experiment to put our own platform didn't work.

215
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Everyone's not flocking to us for, you know, games.

216
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Hold up. I got I got a realistic question because this might actually be something worth worth considering.

217
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Is Origin available in every country? Because Steam is available in a lot of countries.

218
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Origin is not. So maybe there is something where it's going to open it up to new countries.

219
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And especially when we talk about things like FIFA, that could be a pretty big deal.

220
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Actives saying FIFA is the only sports game on PC.

221
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But it seems that Madden is coming back to PC, too.

222
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They've had Madden on PC. I'm not sure why they would have not brought it each year.

223
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Maybe just it doesn't sell enough. But I don't know.

224
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I mean. Here here's what I think it is it comes down to now.

225
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So before the prospect was, well, we don't make enough on those or we're losing like a little bit of a percentage.

226
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So say we sell on Origin, we're not making that additional 30 percent off of selling that title up front.

227
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But then something happened over the last few years, and that's something is we make billions of dollars off of microtransactions.

228
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And so that losing the initial 30 percent or like, say, I don't know, like six dollars, eight dollars off of that title.

229
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Initially isn't such a big deal anymore because they're making so much more back on just getting people to, you know, have that game.

230
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's why you see a lot of times NBA 2K, for example, recently giving it away for free market down to like under ten dollars.

231
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think it was even down to under a dollar at one point because they get people in there and they know they're going to spend more than that on microtransactions.

232
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And that's where they're making all their money back.

233
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Really, they should just go to free to play with this stuff in the first place since they're monetizing it like free to play.

234
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But they're still greedy and they want to sell it for sixty dollars, but whatever.

235
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So they're going to make some additional profit that way.

236
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But that's why I think you're seeing less resistance to putting out more platforms now because they're realizing that they can make more of that on the back end with these games versus not putting it everywhere.

237
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I kind of get that. I think I think there's some truth into what you're saying there, for sure.

238
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So. All right. Anything. So we get everything on the EA play event then we're good there.

239
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah. Now that now that we've acknowledged sports and skate and all that good stuff.

240
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
All right. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we've been playing this week.

241
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Sports games or otherwise. Loki, how was your gaming week?

242
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It was mainly well, it was enough for a little bit and then it was mainly Minecraft.

243
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So I have my Minecraft realm that I'm I'm actually sort of playing right now.

244
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's on its auto plane, I guess it's doing AFK fishing for.

245
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So we did a lot of stuff there.

246
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We've built like out different portals to different biomes that aren't near our our main house.

247
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I've expanded the house a few times. And then this week I was putting together a giant map wall.

248
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So it's like, I think, 12 blocks high and like 18 blocks wide.

249
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's just enormous. So I've been putting it up together and just getting prepared for the new update,

250
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
which will be I think we'll probably be talking about a little bit later.

251
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But new updates can be coming out soon at another update and lots of stuff coming with that.

252
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So I just been playing out with the kids. Nice. Anything else besides Minecraft or in Orna?

253
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That that's pretty much it. I've gotten a lot. I was purchasing some stuff.

254
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So, like, I noticed that there was like some RPGs and stuff down dirt cheap, some indie stuff on the Switch, on the Nintendo eShop.

255
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
They were down to like 10 cents or like even less than that.

256
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So I was going on the eShop, I sorted by price and I picked up a few games.

257
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Like there was a bunch of games for like a penny or like nine cents for stuff.

258
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And so I didn't even know that. Wow. I was just grabbing them because it's like, well, this sucks.

259
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Who cares? It's a penny. And plus, I have Nintendo points, so it doesn't cost me anything.

260
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So I picked up a few games and actually my kids are been enjoying those.

261
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They had a few games. They're really good that were down to like a buck fifty.

262
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So I was like, whatever, let's just have some more stuff to that.

263
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I fixed my Switch this week because the SD card reader was bad. So I had to replace that.

264
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And then what else? Yeah, that's pretty much it.

265
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I mean, so I wanted to play some of the stuff in the Steam.

266
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
They have that indie fest thing going on and to play a bunch of the demos for things.

267
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Like Tank and Rock was one I wanted to try out. And there is a SkateBurb, which is pretty awesome.

268
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And then I don't know, plus diving into the 1700 games or whatever they got in the itch.io bundle.

269
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So I got to go play some of that stuff eventually. I saw my kids the other day.

270
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm like, well, I probably will play most of the stuff now.

271
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But when I retire someday, I'll just have lots of stuff to play.

272
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But we know that's not going to happen. I'll just end up buying more games.

273
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The eternal backlog. Yes.

274
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
All right. My gaming week. So I've still been continuing in Xenoblade.

275
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm in Chapter 6 or 7 now. And yeah, I'm really enjoying that game.

276
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I don't know what else to say. It's a fun little RPG and I've been playing it in kind of short bursts.

277
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But the sheer amount of side quests there are to do in that game kind of lends itself pretty well to being able to play the game in short bursts.

278
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's nice. I've still been playing a little bit of Animal Crossing, but I've scaled way back on Animal Crossing.

279
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I stopped with the turnip thing. My extent in Animal Crossing is more like helping Alan.

280
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Because he got to Animal Crossing about six weeks later than everybody else.

281
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And so he's still building up his island and it looks better than mine, but he's still a little bit behind.

282
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So pretty much the only reason I play that game is to help him out at this point.

283
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Otherwise, I'm kind of waiting for some more seasonal events or something to kind of get me interested in that game again.

284
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Because I'm a little bit like, OK, I've kind of run out of things to do in Animal Crossing.

285
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I've actually been playing a little bit, just a little bit, of Pokemon Shield.

286
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Because you know that DLC came out, the Isle of Armor DLC came out, and that's a pretty big deal in the Pokemon world.

287
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I didn't get it yet. I haven't been in a rush to get it, really.

288
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Because in my brain I was like, I still have content in Pokemon Shield I need to finish.

289
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Now I did beat the game. Remember, this is a big deal because of all the mainline Pokemon games.

290
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Pokemon Shield is the first one that I beat. I got all the badges, beat the equivalent of the Final Four and all that.

291
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But I did not finish that post-game content where you actually get the legendary Pokemon.

292
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So I've started to work on that a little bit because, you know, of course,

293
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Shane, our resident Pokemon fanatic, was kind of asking me, well, when are you going to get the DLC?

294
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And I was like, well, I kind of need to finish the content I have before I can really justify buying new content.

295
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So I made a little bit of progress on beating some of that extra content.

296
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Also, I've remembered to start using my little Pokeball Plus when I go out and play Pokemon Go again.

297
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because you get so much of the rare candy, which is great for getting instant levels on your Pokemon and those sorts of rewards.

298
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Because I did Pokemon Community Day was yesterday, right? They had a Weedle, had Pokemon Community Day.

299
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I was out, I played, like, I was doing Ingress with my Pokemon Ball Plus on the side.

300
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And I was doing a mission downtown that took me some time to finish.

301
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
When all was said and done, I was probably casually playing for like three hours.

302
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And I got 12 of those shiny Weedles through Bluetooth.

303
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So I was very happy with the way that went.

304
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So that was kind of my Pokemon adventures for the week.

305
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Still been playing Orna a little bit myself.

306
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm trying to upgrade some more of my weapons and armor and the blacksmiths so I can really take on some of the stronger stuff.

307
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Because I feel weak right now.

308
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I just upgraded into a new star level, whichever 25 levels.

309
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You kind of go to a new star level, which generates all the enemies in the world and things like that.

310
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And I'm really weak right now, so I need some better gear to take that on.

311
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So I've been working on that.

312
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And then I've been working a little bit with classics.

313
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Because, you know, I have some minis sitting around the house.

314
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And all of a sudden it was just like, I'm going to play all my mini machines this week.

315
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So the Turbo Graphics mini that I picked up a couple weeks ago.

316
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I finally spent some, like, real time playing some games on that.

317
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And that was fun.

318
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And I was playing Salamander quite a bit.

319
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And Alan was watching me die a lot and laughing at me.

320
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So that was a thing that happened.

321
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And remember the Commodore 64 mini you got me?

322
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah, I was playing with that.

324
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And I played a little bit. I played around a little bit with that already.

325
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But this week I decided I want to play these random ROMs because you can load.

326
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Remember they did a version update where you can load your own games onto it now, basically.

327
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah.

328
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So I was having a ball with playing old Commodore 64 games on my TV.

329
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I think it started as, like, I want to hear the theme to such and such game on my TV.

330
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And then that just turned into Commodore 64 Night.

331
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So that was fun. I enjoyed reliving that.

332
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So, yeah.

333
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I need to figure out if I want to get one of the C64 biggies.

334
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Although I don't see...

335
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Oh, when does that come out? Or did they already come out?

336
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I think it was supposed to come out late last year, but I'm not sure if...

337
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Well, I mean, COVID wouldn't have been a thing last year.

338
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I don't know if they ever actually came out.

339
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And now I'm sure if it was scheduled for early this year,

340
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm sure the COVID thing has probably screwed that whole situation up.

341
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So, anyway.

342
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Fifth Dream in Chat says,

343
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I just beat Armor Isle DLC like five minutes ago.

344
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I heard there isn't a lot of story in it,

345
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
but obviously the new Pokemon and, well, when I say new Pokemon,

346
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
a lot of the returning Pokemon and such,

347
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
like, it kind of opens up like a new type of wild area.

348
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And so there's just a lot of stuff to see and do there.

349
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's kind of what I'm hearing about it.

350
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So it's that the story is, it's there,

351
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
but it's more about the experience in the new wild area.

352
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So, okay.

353
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So Bobby says the C64, not the mini,

354
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
but the C64 came out December 2019 in Europe.

355
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
North America is listed as ASAP 2020.

356
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So I'm going to bet COVID screwed that up.

357
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But I'm not really in a rush to get what they didn't change any of the games in it.

358
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Right. It's just, you know, actual size now.

359
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah. And, you know, speaking of changing the games in it,

360
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
did you know they added a game in a recent,

361
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
like an official game to the C64?

362
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They added it in a recent firmware update.

363
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Do you know what it is they added?

364
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
What?

365
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Farming simulator.

366
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So somehow, someone did a port of farming simulator for the C64

367
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
in like 2018 or something.

368
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And it is now like, so if you have,

369
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
if you have one of those Commodore 64 minis,

370
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and you haven't updated the firmware in a while,

371
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
update it because now you can get farming simulator for the C64.

372
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's pretty funny.

373
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's the game that just keeps on giving, that's for sure.

374
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
All right. So, no, go ahead.

375
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Sorry, I was going to mention.

376
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So one other thing that happened this week is my,

377
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
my young son has been trying to get me to play Animal Crossing.

378
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I still haven't because I've been too busy with other things,

379
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
but got my wife to play Animal Crossing.

380
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Now she's playing Animal Crossing.

381
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So that eventually happens.

382
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And now, now she'll be playing it more hardcore, I think.

383
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I was going to say,

384
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
didn't she get into some of the prior Animal Crossing games?

385
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Like that's what I thought.

386
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
She didn't, she didn't start this one day one?

387
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No.

388
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh, interesting. All right.

389
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Well, sometimes people arrive late to the party and that's okay.

390
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That was like me with Mass Effect.

391
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I arrived very late to that party, but I'm here now.

392
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
All right.

393
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I think that's about it for our gaming weeks.

394
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So we will move on and get into some other news that happened from

395
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
throughout the week.

396
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Let's get into some other news. Loki.

397
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yes. Let's talk about Legos.

398
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So we talked a little bit about the Super Mario Lego,

399
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
which is going to be launching later this year in the US.

400
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So at least North America is going to be coming out August 1st.

401
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
However,

402
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Nintendo announced that they're going to be launching first in Japan a

403
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
month earlier on July 10th.

404
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So they'll be offering the starter course and I guess the Piranha Plant

405
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Power Slide and Desert Oki expansion.

406
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I still don't know exactly how this is all going to work,

407
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
but I do know because it's Lego,

408
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
it is going to be rather expensive with the entire range of sets running

409
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
upwards to $590, which I might say,

410
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
sounds like a lot of money when you think until you think about Lego.

411
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And that's actually pretty reasonable considering all the other lines

412
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
that they have and how much some of their things cost.

413
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I think it's about in line with everything.

414
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Plus, you know,

415
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
this has got a digital element with the Mario and having the whole LCD

416
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
screen in there and stuff. So that's kind of cool.

417
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Definitely want to pick it up when it comes out,

418
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
but they showed some more sets,

419
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
including they have a Toad character as well and Yoshi and Bullet Bills

420
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
all looks pretty cool.

421
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I just want a Lego Mario game now.

422
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Interesting. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

423
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Notch actually went to Lego with the early Minecraft concept and offered

424
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
them to make it their game and they stupidly said no.

425
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So, yeah, that could have been a big thing for Lego.

426
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
But would it have caught on the same way if it was Lego? I don't know.

427
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
They tried. Remember, they had Lego worlds and it wasn't.

428
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It was OK.

429
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah, but it was it was a Minecraft clone.

430
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That was the problem. It wasn't Minecraft.

431
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, they really missed out.

432
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Anyway, sorry.

433
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They kind of have the sets, though, so that's OK.

434
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But, yeah, they really missed out.

435
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So you're interested in the Super Mario set, though, right?

436
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Even though it's going to cost you some money?

437
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Oh, yeah, of course.

438
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah, it looks it looks interesting to me as well.

439
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I want to pick some of it up.

440
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But then again, I've already spoiled myself this month because I spent

441
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
way too much money on that.

442
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And I think I mentioned I was going to do it on O.L.R.,

443
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
but I'm just confirming I bought that arcade one up burger time machine.

444
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So that's going to be coming whenever they shut up.

445
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
No, they haven't shipped yet.

446
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
They're still because of covid and everything has been delayed.

447
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So I don't think they ship till the end of this month,

448
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
even though they announced it back in February.

449
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I think they've just been having some problems due to everything going on in the world.

450
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So I don't think they ship till later this month.

451
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So nobody has theirs yet.

452
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So I'll get mine when everybody else does,

453
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
even though I was late to the party.

454
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So that part's kind of cool.

455
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But yeah, because I spent money on that,

456
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
it's going to be very hard to justify Legos.

457
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like, I might get something small like because Legos,

458
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
you know, there might be there's going to be a large Mario thing

459
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that's going to be like hundreds of dollars or one hundred dollars, I'm sure.

460
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And then there'll be tiny, tiny Lego things, right?

461
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh, yeah.

462
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
My bags.

463
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Sounds exciting.

464
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah, I mean, some of it's you can get like the stars.

465
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I think something like it's not too expensive,

466
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
but yeah, there's different size things that are going to be available.

467
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah, I may get a set, but that'll probably be the extent of it.

468
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah.

469
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
All right. Cool.

470
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about some of the Pokemon news that came out this week,

471
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
because there was a Pokemon Direct that happened a few days ago

472
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
where, you know, it was most people suspected,

473
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
oh, it's just going to kind of detail the Isle of Armor DLC.

474
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And it did a little bit of that.

475
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But there were also some surprise announcements.

476
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And if you want to talk about surprise, how about this?

477
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This came out of nowhere, but it was also one of those things where it was,

478
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
it's about time a brand new Pokemon Snap game was announced.

479
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That's right.

480
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
They're going back and they're making a new Pokemon Snap game.

481
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
This isn't everything old is new again.

482
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That's right. This isn't a remake of the old game.

483
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's just the concept as a new game, because now it has the very first game

484
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
was when it was in 1999 when there was only the base set of Pokemon, the base 151 Pokemon.

485
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This new one's going to have them all.

486
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So right there, it's going to be a huge change.

487
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Is it going to have them all or is it going to have the, we're going to have,

488
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
what is that, Pokedex Gate 2 or whatever?

489
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Actually, that's a very good question and call out.

490
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And maybe I want to choose my words carefully,

491
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
because we don't have confirmation that it has all the Pokemon.

492
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So maybe it won't.

493
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
However, we know that it's going to use Pokemon from every generation.

494
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Maybe we'll put it that way. That's current.

495
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So we know it at least is going to have that.

496
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's hard to say.

497
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
We don't know if it's going to include every single Pokemon or not.

498
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This is a different type of game, so I would think maybe they could do it.

499
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Maybe there still will be DLC.

500
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't know.

501
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's too early to say any of that, because all we know is that it's happening

502
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and this is a game that is happening.

503
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
What's also kind of curious about this a little bit,

504
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
it is not being made by the Pokemon company.

505
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This game is actually being made, or HAL Laboratory, I should say,

506
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
but those are kind of adjacent.

507
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But anyway, Bandai Namco is making Pokemon Snap, the new one for Switch,

508
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
which is kind of like, whoa, that's a little different.

509
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But I mean, it's not that Namco hasn't worked together with Nintendo before

510
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
on other things.

511
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
They were part of the Triforce that created the F-Zero.

512
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Never say never.

513
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It wasn't confirmed.

514
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It wasn't talked about.

515
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
There's another Pokemon Direct next week that maybe they'll bring that up,

516
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
but I don't, yeah.

517
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Right now, that's just a pipe dream, I suppose.

518
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So some other, a little more minor Pokemon games were announced,

519
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
but there's still new Pokemon games, and some people are going to be into this.

520
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
A free-to-start puzzle game called Pokemon Snap,

521
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
which is going to be released next week.

522
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's going to be released next week.

523
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
New Pokemon games, and some people are going to be into this.

524
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
A free-to-start puzzle game called Pokemon Cafe that comes out on our birthday,

525
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
OLR's birthday, June 23rd.

526
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Pokemon Cafe is going to be coming out.

527
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's a match puzzle game.

528
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
If I'm not mistaken, and maybe somebody in chat can correct me,

529
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
isn't it just Tsum Tsum?

530
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Has anyone played Tsum Tsum, the Konami Disney game

531
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
where you, like, trace the paths?

532
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm almost positive Pokemon Cafe is just Tsum Tsum.

533
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But maybe I missed a difference somewhere in there.

534
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But anyway, in this game, you are ordering a restaurant.

535
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You're running a restaurant.

536
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You're completing orders by connecting Pokemon monsters together.

537
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah, it's Pokemon and it's lattes, whatever.

538
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I don't know how those things go together, but they do in Pokemon Cafe.

539
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Another game that came out now is called Pokemon Smile.

540
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It is a toothbrushing game, so it uses, like, the camera

541
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
so that basically you encourage kids and a lot of adults

542
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
to brush their teeth and the camera kind of sees that

543
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and you are catching Pokemon as a result.

544
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's basically trying to make toothbrushing fun for kids

545
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and it's no secret that's the audience this is aimed at.

546
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And, okay, that's cute, right?

547
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
We do have to admit sometimes Pokemon is supposed to kind of be for kids.

548
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It's just a lot of adults happen to enjoy it too.

549
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So I think cute little things like Pokemon Smile,

550
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I certainly don't have a problem with that stuff existing.

551
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Cute, I guess.

552
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Are they going to make themed toothbrushes to go along with it?

553
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Loki, there's already going to be Pokemon toothbrushes out there.

554
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You've got to be kidding me.

555
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
All right, I'm catching up on some comments from chat

556
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

557
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
ActDeftInChat says Bandai Namco is doing it, but it's not Bamco's first project.

558
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
They also made Pokken Tournament.

559
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Thank you for that call out.

560
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
That's a very good call out is that Pokken, which is like Tekken, right?

561
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Wink, nod.

562
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Was an Amkai Bando thing, or Bandai Namco thing.

563
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And an arcade game.

564
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
What am I missing in the moment?

565
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It was an arcade game.

566
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Oh, Pokken was an arcade game.

567
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yes, it was.

568
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, I see you're going back on that tangent

569
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
where you want Pokemon Snap in the arcades, right?

570
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yes.

571
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay, gotcha.

572
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yes.

573
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
All right.

574
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Let's see.

575
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I am Canadian 47 in chat.

576
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This isn't really related to the story, but I had to read this.

577
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
After listening to the podcast since the early 2000s,

578
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Rob and Loki don't look at all like what I imagined.

579
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Well, and Dark Sakura is actually,

580
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
she's been participating with the show on camera,

581
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
but she just happens to not be here tonight.

582
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
If you happen to be a subscriber to vog network,

583
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
wink, wink, nudge, nudge,

584
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
over at Twitch TV,

585
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
using your Twitch Prime subscription or what have you,

586
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
you can go back and look at the archives of older episodes.

587
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But anyhow, the reason why I read that comment

588
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is because it begs the question,

589
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
what did you think we look like?

590
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's okay, we're much older now.

591
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That's true too.

592
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We're much older.

593
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Maybe I did look like what you thought I was.

594
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
What I look like back in the early 2000s.

595
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But now that's not the early 2000s.

596
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I used to be skinny.

597
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's just not, things have changed in COVID-19.

598
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And so, you know.

599
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, the quarantine 19, that's for sure.

600
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
All right.

601
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Let's see.

602
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I wanted to find,

603
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
so I didn't have it on the show roll,

604
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
but there was like a recent data mining

605
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
that happened in Pokemon Go.

606
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And I think they found some more stuff.

607
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What was that site?

608
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It always has the new Pokemon Go stuff.

609
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And they found some new stuff in Pokemon Go

610
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
that it looks like they're-

611
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
The Silph Road?

612
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
What's that?

613
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The Silph Road?

614
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Maybe it was that, I don't know.

615
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
There's also Feve Games or Feve Games.

616
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
There's a lot of the Ingress teardowns.

617
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I thought they did Pokemon Ones too as well.

618
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But anyway, my point was,

619
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and what I wanted to get to with that is that

620
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
it seems interesting that Niantic seems to be building

621
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
some type of like social network or in-game network

622
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
because you're gonna soon be able to see

623
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
what games your friends are playing.

624
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But Niantic only has three games as far as I know.

625
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Pokemon Go, Ingress, and Harry Potter Wizards Unite,

626
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
although that really isn't their game.

627
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That's Port Keith's game with Niantic's back end.

628
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Now, of course, Niantic has that Catan game

629
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
coming at some point,

630
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
but that's gonna be very interesting.

631
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Oh yeah.

632
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah, remember that?

633
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That's gonna be interesting to see how they implement that

634
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and how that friends list works.

635
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So I'm very curious to see how that all works.

636
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So, all right.

637
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I Am Canadian says,

638
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Loki smiles a lot and doesn't rant as much.

639
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Well, he's in a good mood tonight.

640
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You missed the EA stuff earlier, actually.

641
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Maybe there's that.

642
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And Rob seems skinny enough.

643
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I'll take it.

644
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Well, I'm also in a house with other people and children.

645
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So, you know, you have to dial it back a bit.

646
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
If you listen carefully,

647
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
you'll see that Loki's children

648
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
have gotten the loud rantiness gene from Loki.

649
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Because you can hear him in the background.

650
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
All right.

651
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

652
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We got more stories for you guys.

653
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Loki.

654
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
All right.

655
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So, you know,

656
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm always fascinated with different games that come out

657
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
that try to teach you different things.

658
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
There's been several before.

659
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
In fact, I know my son used to play one

660
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
when he would go to his coding class

661
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
to learn to code JavaScript,

662
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
but this one looked a little bit more elaborate.

663
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So, it's a game called TwiloQuest, or TwilioQuest.

664
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And what it's supposed to teach you

665
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
is actually the Twilio's communication APIs.

666
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And so, it's this, like, pixel, you know, retro-style RPG,

667
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and it actually has coding in it.

668
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And you can actually download and play it as well.

669
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I think it's mostly for free.

670
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But they also have, like, different things

671
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
that link back to their GitHub repositories

672
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
and talk about Twilio as well.

673
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So, neat that you could actually play some games

674
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and actually have them being engaged enough

675
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
to learn how to code.

676
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I have no idea what Twilio is,

677
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
so I don't know if that would be useful for me

678
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
to learn the API calls for that.

679
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But I guess I could figure it out.

680
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But I still want to play the game.

681
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
This makes me think,

682
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
OK, this whole story made me think of an old, old, old game.

683
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
OK, so the Oregon Trail,

684
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
that's not the game it made me think of,

685
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
but everybody knows that game, right?

686
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
That was made by a company called,

687
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I think it was like MECC,

688
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I think was the name of the company.

689
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It was something like Minnesota Educational,

690
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
somebody in chattel fill in the gaps there,

691
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm sure, on what I'm lacking in the moment there.

692
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But that company made another game,

693
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and it was called Rocky's Boots.

694
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And if you've never played this game,

695
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
it is worth a look,

696
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
because it really kind of turns the concept of logic,

697
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and I think programming logic

698
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
is really what this game is teaching.

699
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's teaching kind of like how to think through logic,

700
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
meaning like if, then, and, or,

701
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
those types of statements that come in a lot with programming.

702
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Rocky's Boots attempts to kind of teach you this

703
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
through different puzzles,

704
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and you build these big, try to open gates

705
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
by putting these simple programming puzzles together

706
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
within the game's interface.

707
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And it's really fascinating,

708
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and it's one of those games, really,

709
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
if I haven't already spotlight,

710
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
spotlit that as a classic game of the week previously,

711
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I really need to in a future week,

712
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
because that was a game that I remember playing

713
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
when I was younger that taught me about programming.

714
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah, and Bobby was saying that,

715
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
was it the part of Twilio I worked on

716
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
was an API that allowed you to send text messages.

717
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And yeah, that's basically what Twilio is.

718
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's an API to use, it's for different companies

719
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
to send messages via SMS or Facebook Messenger,

720
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
WhatsApp, all these different apps all together.

721
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So it is like an enterprise software or API,

722
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
but they also have this game

723
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
that kind of teach you how to use it

724
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
instead of like a boring ass course

725
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
that you can take online.

726
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So it's kind of a unique thing.

727
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
If you want to check it out though, twilio.com slash quest,

728
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and you can download it for free.

729
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The other programming game I remember from when I was young,

730
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
because now I'm in reminiscing mode, was Logo.

731
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Not to be confused with the TV network that plays Drag Race,

732
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
but Logo was, and it's a game,

733
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Logo was really a programming language of its own,

734
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
but they taught it in a way that felt like a game

735
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
because it was like, oh, you have this turtle,

736
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and you're going to teach the turtle to draw these shapes

737
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
by doing things like pen down, forward 90, right 90,

738
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
go to, you know, and it's like,

739
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I've been teaching this how to build simple patterns

740
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and things like that.

741
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So I remember Logo was a big thing when I was a kid, so.

742
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah, I remember Logo.

743
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah, dark to see us shouting Logo.

744
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Questbuster in chat says,

745
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
there was also an old game from the 80s from Spinnaker

746
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
that had you program robots to escape a city

747
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
by linking up things like AND, OR gates, circuits, and et cetera.

748
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Ooh, I don't, I remember Spinnaker.

749
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I had a math game by them,

750
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
but I don't know the game you're talking about, sadly.

751
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
See, you know, nowadays they have that kind of stuff

752
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
if you want to get into like even the basic stuff.

753
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You know, Minecraft even has a lot of that.

754
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
They have the different education versions and stuff

755
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that they even, I was noticing with the different objects

756
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
that they could teach chemistry in there.

757
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
They can teach programming.

758
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I know they have block-based programming,

759
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
no pun intended, in there as well.

760
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Plus, even just in vanilla Minecraft,

761
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
they have the redstone circuits you can create AND, OR gates,

762
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
you know, all sorts of stuff with that.

763
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And I mean, you've seen people make some pretty complicated things with that.

764
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The whole computers, emulators, you know, all sorts of things.

765
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So it's, there's a lot of stuff out there

766
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
that's accessible in game form

767
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
to help even teach at a very young age.

768
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

769
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Human Resource Machine is a great game

770
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
that teaches assembler programming.

771
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's by the same people who made Little Inferno.

772
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
They also made 7 Billion Humans,

773
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
which teaches even more assembler programming.

774
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I will have to try that because I've wanted to dabble

775
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
in assembler programming at some point.

776
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah, there's all sorts of like cool little games,

777
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
teaching games out there for that type of stuff.

778
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm glad we could take a moment to spotlight this one as well

779
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and reminisce on some of the others that are out there

780
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
from the way way past and some more contemporary stuff as well.

781
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Fifth Dream says, Someone should build a game in Unity

782
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
to teach how to build in Unity.

783
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Meta, that has to exist.

784
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That has to exist.

785
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I know you joke about that, but they already have those actually.

786
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So there's these projects that you can start up now

787
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
that actually have tutorials on how to build the projects

788
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
or build out the projects.

789
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Unity now has this launcher program that you use.

790
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You can download different versions.

791
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You can build new projects.

792
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
They have templates you can start off with.

793
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You can actually start with these different things.

794
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
They have a kart racing game.

795
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
There's an RPG.

796
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I think a platformer.

797
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You can start with those and they teach you the different basics

798
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
within the game.

799
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
They have an FPS as well that's pretty awesome.

800
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
They teach you building add-ons or how to modify the code

801
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to do different things that you learn by doing.

802
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I understand that's a joke, but they actually do have that.

803
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Honestly, when it comes to teaching people how to do things,

804
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
games is a very common way to do that.

805
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I am a teacher.

806
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
A lot of you guys don't know that, but my day job...

807
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I don't teach kids in a school.

808
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I teach in a corporate environment, which is very different,

809
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
but I still do corporate training as my job.

810
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Believe it or not, y'all, I'm a game designer

811
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
because I've designed games that we play in the classroom.

812
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Games are huge for reinforcements.

813
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm sure many of you, either in your jobs or whatever,

814
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
you go and you learn something.

815
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It's always more fun when the class isn't just like

816
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
wah-wah, wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.

817
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
There's things that you participate in and little games

818
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
that get you a little more engaged and make the learning more fun.

819
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Using games to teach people how to do things is not a new trick.

820
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's just interesting when what is being taught is

821
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
how to, in turn, make more games.

822
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's just interesting.

823
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Anyhow, Phoenix7726 says,

824
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But Rob, have you ever sent a student to the shadow realm?

825
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Not yet, but maybe I'll try that in a future game.

826
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Never say never.

827
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Let's move on.

828
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Let's talk about interfaces.

829
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Interfaces of the systems we play games on.

830
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Some new details coming out about the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X

831
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and what the interfaces might look like.

832
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
The PlayStation 5 interface is going to be completely redone.

833
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
They're saying a 100% overhaul of the PlayStation 4 UI.

834
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
We got a little hint of that during that PlayStation 5 preview.

835
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You remember that?

836
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It was like the push the PlayStation button to begin.

837
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That was all we kind of saw? That whole thing, right?

838
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I wasn't sure if that was legit or if that was just kind of like,

839
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
we're making some UI for example purposes.

840
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I kind of feel like it was legit, but you're right. Maybe it wasn't.

841
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Apparently, there was a LinkedIn thread out there that got deleted.

842
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's how you know it was an issue because it ended up getting deleted.

843
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
The vice president of UX design at Sony, Matt McLaren,

844
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
confirmed that the PlayStation 5 will have a redesigned user interface

845
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
and said it was a 100% overhaul of the PlayStation 4 UI

846
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and some very different concepts.

847
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Also, in a continued chat on that thread saying the new operating system

848
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
was more subtle than flashy, but no pixel is untouched.

849
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Hard to know what that really means,

850
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
but it sounds like essentially they're building it from the ground up.

851
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
They're building a brand new interface for the PlayStation 5, right?

852
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Meanwhile, on the Microsoft side, there's an update that came from

853
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
some tweets that were made by a senior editor at The Verge,

854
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and then there was a report on some next gen console interfaces saying

855
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
there will be some additional things to account for some of the Xbox Series X new features,

856
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,000
but the UI and the dash will be the same outside of the things you would expect to be enhanced,

857
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
such as maybe some of the picture fidelity and some of the speed and things like that.

858
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
But Microsoft doesn't seem to really be reinventing the wheel when it comes to the Xbox Series X.

859
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Two very different schools of thought there. What do you think?

860
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I mean, they've been kind of developing all of the interface on the Xbox One,

861
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I think, to be cross-platform with Windows 10.

862
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It's just kind of this Xbox platform, so I wouldn't see them making some major design changes

863
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
when the whole point is that this would be parity across these different platforms.

864
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Right.

865
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I mean, I guess that's why they would be doing it.

866
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That makes a lot of sense.

867
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I don't know.

868
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Now, Bobby brings up a good point, and this is something I wanted to address as well.

869
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Bobby says, to be fair, the PlayStation 4's interface never changed since launch.

870
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The Xbox One's interface is completely different today than it was at launch.

871
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That is true. We don't usually see PlayStation change.

872
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
In fact, I don't think they've ever completely changed their interface midway through a console's lifespan,

873
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
whereas they definitely did it with the Xbox One.

874
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
They did it a couple times because they took out Kinect at one point, right?

875
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
There was that whole thing.

876
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
But I remember the Xbox 360 went through some huge changes during its launch.

877
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I mean, huge.

878
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You remember the Blade's layout that the 360 originally started with?

879
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Oh, I love the Blade's.

880
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I loved it too, but it might be hard to fit everything we're used to seeing today in the Blade's layout.

881
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So, the 360 changed its layout partway through its life.

882
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So, Microsoft has shown that even though it might seem to have this parity now,

883
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
they might end up re-changing it two years into its lifespan.

884
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Microsoft's shown a willingness to do that.

885
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Sony doesn't really do that.

886
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I guess, yeah.

887
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I mean, I don't know.

888
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It doesn't matter if it's changed or not.

889
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Does it need to be changed unless it's kind of broken?

890
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I would just make sure that if it's doing everything we want it to do,

891
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
then who cares if it's different or not.

892
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Yeah.

893
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
At the end of the day, people are not going to say,

894
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
oh, I love this system more because I love the UI more.

895
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Now, if the UI is an issue, people will speak up on it,

896
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
such as folks in our chat right now are saying,

897
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Fifth Dream says the fucking new PS4 dashboard or whatever they call it

898
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
better be more responsive on PS5.

899
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Because, you know, right now some of these consoles,

900
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
actually both of them for me have some issues with lag input

901
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and things like input lag and things like that.

902
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I get that once in a while on both,

903
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, and it gets really annoying.

904
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So, hopefully these are things that get fixed.

905
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah.

906
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And Fifth Dream is asking, is that smush or not smush?

907
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It is smush.

908
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
That's smush.

909
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah, it was smush.

910
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Because he just, this is TMI, but I don't care.

911
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
His litter box is right over here.

912
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's right off cam on the other side of a little divider wall.

913
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So, his litter box is there, and for whatever reason,

914
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Mr. Smush loves to announce when he's just used the litter box.

915
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And that's what you just heard.

916
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Is that you'll hear scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch,

917
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
scratch, scratch, scratch, pause.

918
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Meow.

919
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Meow.

920
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah.

921
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah, my cat's asleep right now in the garage.

922
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
She likes sleeping out there in the hot summer.

923
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Wow.

924
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It's hot in the garage.

925
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It is super hot, but apparently because she's older,

926
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
it feels really good on her bones, I guess, or something.

927
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So, she'll just lay right...

928
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Well, I set up some blankets out there for her,

929
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
but she'll just lay on the concrete sometimes.

930
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Sometimes she'll lay on a blanket.

931
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
She was on a plastic bag earlier when I went out there.

932
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
She keeps moving around.

933
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
But yeah, so I don't know.

934
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
But even today, it was even worse out there

935
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
because we have somebody power washing the house.

936
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And so, it smells like wet dirt or wet cat out there.

937
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And so, it's hot and it's smelly and humid.

938
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Lovely.

939
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I don't know.

940
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But she loves it.

941
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
She's just like, I'm going to nap out here all day.

942
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, we have a total heat wave going on here in Northern California

943
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
where our show is based right now.

944
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Actually, today is just the start of it.

945
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's supposed to be over 100 every day this week.

946
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Yikes.

947
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
No, thank you.

948
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Send it back.

949
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
All right.

950
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Anyway, let's move on.

951
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
We have some more stories.

952
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Low key.

953
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
This is exciting.

954
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I'm excited about this game.

955
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Yeah, so out of left field here.

956
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I guess it's not out of left field because we've had rhythm games before.

957
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But we have Kingdom Hearts getting a rhythm game spinoff

958
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
called Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory.

959
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And it looks almost like if the Kingdom Hearts character

960
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
is running down the note rail for like a guitar hero

961
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
or something like that.

962
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That's kind of what the game looks like.

963
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
But I don't really know how it necessarily plays.

964
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I guess you just would hit different buttons to coincide

965
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
with attacking different enemies on each of the rails.

966
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Be my assumption.

967
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Well, I heard about it on Twitter before I saw some of the pictures

968
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
and short videos and things like that of the game in motion.

969
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And my first reaction was, well, a lot of people were like,

970
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
OMG, Kingdom Hearts on Switch.

971
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And then it was a music game.

972
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But still, it's, you know, something.

973
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And I love music games.

974
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So cool.

975
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Yeah.

976
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
But my first instinct was like, well, this is nice.

977
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
When can we have theater them get ported to the switch finally?

978
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But it was.

979
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

980
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Well, here's the thing.

981
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It was pointed out to me in Discord.

982
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This is basically theater them in 3D.

983
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
If you kind of look at it and the way that they're running

984
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and what the note patterns are, it's kind of a theater them in 3D.

985
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And I was like, oh, huh.

986
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
OK, well, I mean, I would have been into it anyway because you said

987
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Kingdom Hearts music game.

988
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And that means you're going to have all those Disney songs potentially

989
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
that are going to be in this.

990
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But yeah, I'm excited to see how this turns out.

991
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I still wouldn't mind a proper theater them ports.

992
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
That has been on the back of my mind, especially, you know,

993
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
even if they feel the touch screen isn't good enough.

994
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
There's the arcade style controls using the two sticks

995
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
that you could do very easy.

996
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So I would still love to see that someday.

997
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But this looks cool and is certainly welcome at the at the table.

998
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So.

999
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah, it looks OK.

1000
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It's not something I'm going to be playing, though.

1001
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I don't know.

1002
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It also depends how much it costs.

1003
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I hope they don't try to charge like 40, 50 bucks for this,

1004
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
but they might.

1005
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
They might charge.

1006
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I want to say three theater them probably cost like 40 bucks

1007
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
when it came out.

1008
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I feel like so.

1009
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I don't know. We'll see.

1010
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
We'll see.

1011
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
All right.

1012
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Moving on.

1013
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Let's take a trip down memory lane and visit a classic game of the week.

1014
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Every week here at Orange Launch Radio,

1015
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
we like dark soccer to step into the gaming vault and find a game

1016
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
that she thinks, hey,

1017
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
you guys should check out this game this week and play this a little bit.

1018
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Well, dark soccer is not here.

1019
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So I decided to take over the segment tonight because sorry, Loki.

1020
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But when I was going through all these minis, I was like, oh,

1021
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I want to talk about this.

1022
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So the classic game of the week that I picked for tonight is a game

1023
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
called Monty on the Run.

1024
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And it was a game for the Commodore 64.

1025
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It was also on the ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum, if you will.

1026
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It was ported to some other systems as well.

1027
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
The Amstrad CPC, the Commodore 16.

1028
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Technically it exists on the Famicom disk system, actually.

1029
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Jellico made a port of this game on the Famicom.

1030
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I think they called it Monty's Great Heart-Pounding Escape.

1031
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But like the game is very different.

1032
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So I have a hard time.

1033
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
All it does is it has like the same music and some similar platforming

1034
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
mechanics, but like you're not even playing as Monty the Mole.

1035
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
They turned Monty into a person or something like that.

1036
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I don't know. Anyway, as this video is playing on Twitch,

1037
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
you're probably hearing the music in the background.

1038
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And honestly, that is the reason for this game.

1039
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Monty on the Run has a fucking phenomenal soundtrack.

1040
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
When you consider this is a game from July of 1985 on the Commodore 64,

1041
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
which means 64 kilobytes of RAM.

1042
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Now, obviously the Commodore 64 had that SID chip, which, you know,

1043
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
kind of lends itself to a lot of the chip to noise that we hear today.

1044
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But I hope you guys can kind of hear some of that soundtrack in the background

1045
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
because this game was known for its soundtrack.

1046
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Otherwise, it's kind of a base platformer that's really hard,

1047
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
as a lot of these games in the 80s were very hard.

1048
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The particular person that we're watching play on Twitch

1049
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
knows what they're doing, so they make it look very easy.

1050
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
But basically, you know, the Commodore 64 joystick had a joystick

1051
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and one fire button. So that's all you could do.

1052
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
You run and you jump. And you had to time those jumps perfectly

1053
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
because Monty does, like, a little flip every time you jump

1054
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and you will get right in the way of certain things

1055
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
and all the enemies that are around and things like that.

1056
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
The game is kind of weird. You have all of these strange levels everywhere.

1057
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Like, he escapes a house in the beginning and then he's, like,

1058
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
going through a sewer system. And all of these monsters,

1059
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
like, I can't explain this. Like, there's an angry shoe,

1060
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
a beer can, and a tea kettle that are chasing him right now.

1061
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Somebody was just like, let's draw random sprites

1062
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
and those will be the monsters.

1063
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Now, one thing I think we also have to remember is that

1064
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
a lot of the game developers in the 80s were on drugs.

1065
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Now, I'm not saying this game was made on drugs.

1066
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm not going to make a claim like that that I don't have the facts back up.

1067
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
But I'm just going to say a lot of games in the 80s

1068
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
were made under the influence.

1069
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And sometimes you see that come through.

1070
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
It could be just that, you know, they ran out of ideas.

1071
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I'm not saying what I'm saying.

1072
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Because I've seen a lot of games, like, I remember playing

1073
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
one of the Barbie games or whatever on the NES

1074
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
and they had some weird enemies in that.

1075
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So, I mean, this is kind of on par with some of those things.

1076
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
You broke up for me even though I think you came out over the feed.

1077
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So I didn't hear all of that. Sorry.

1078
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So, yeah, I was talking about how, like, some games out there

1079
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
have really weird enemies as well.

1080
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Like, I've seen, like, a Barbie game

1081
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
or they have, like, the Back to the Future 2 and 3.

1082
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Games have some really weird enemies and stuff like that along the lines of this.

1083
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Sometimes you just have to come up and be creative with what they have.

1084
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You just accept it because it's a game.

1085
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Yeah, exactly.

1086
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Now, okay, a lot of folks in chat are suddenly bringing up VVVVV,

1087
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
which was a very big game from an indie title from...

1088
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Actually, that game is probably from 2013 or 2012.

1089
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
It's almost old enough to be a classic game of the week itself at this point.

1090
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
VVVVV was heavily inspired by classic Commodore 64 games

1091
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and I would argue Monty on the Run was absolutely one of those games.

1092
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Not only for the fact that VVVV has a fucking fantastic soundtrack all of its own,

1093
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
but you're right, as you move from room to room,

1094
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
every room kind of has its own little name,

1095
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
which is something you see here in Monty on the Run as well.

1096
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So, I would say, yeah, VVVVV was heavily inspired by Monty on the Run, absolutely.

1097
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Anyway, some other details about Monty on the Run.

1098
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Monty on the Run is actually the third game in the series,

1099
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
but it's probably the one that's talked about the most

1100
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
because of, again, the great soundtrack.

1101
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Technically, the first game was Wanted, Monty Mole,

1102
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
and then there was Monty is Innocent was the second game.

1103
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Here we have Monty on the Run.

1104
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
And then there was Auf Wiedersehen Monty,

1105
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,000
and then Mole Christmas and Impossible was the last game in the series that they made.

1106
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Impossible, I think, actually had a port on the TurboGrafx-16, actually.

1107
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,000
But anyway, we'll save that for another day because today is about Monty on the Run.

1108
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
The plot of the game is that he is on the run from authorities

1109
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
after the intervention in the miners' strike.

1110
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So, he escapes from his house and has to head for the English Channel

1111
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
and for freedom in Europe.

1112
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I'm not making this up.

1113
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And the last screen in this game,

1114
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
he gets on a ship that has a big Union Jack on it and sails away,

1115
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
and it's game over. It's free.

1116
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Anyway, and that apparently was the start for the next game.

1117
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Go figure.

1118
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
The Commodore 64 version was produced by Micro Projects Limited.

1119
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
There was some graphical input by Mark Rogers.

1120
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
The classic soundtrack by Rob Hubbard.

1121
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
The music for this version is regarded as one of the best computer game scores

1122
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
for the Commodore 64.

1123
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Totally agree with that.

1124
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Rob Hubbard said it was inspired by Devil's Gallop,

1125
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
and that was the tune to the radio serial Dick Barton.

1126
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
This theme song has been highly rated as far as Commodore 64 classics have gone

1127
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
in all sorts of different places.

1128
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Again, there was a Famicom Disk System remake,

1129
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
but it was really nothing.

1130
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I have a hard time calling it a remake.

1131
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
All it took was the title and this song for its title.

1132
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
This song isn't even in the fucking game on the FDS.

1133
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's just on the title screen, so it's weird.

1134
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't know.

1135
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Anyway, there's an unofficial port for Atari 8-bit systems,

1136
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
but that didn't happen until 2019.

1137
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Otherwise, it was rated pretty well.

1138
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Apparently, it was a bestseller on the Spectrum.

1139
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Crash Magazine gave the Spectrum version a 94 out of 100.

1140
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Now, if you want to actually play this game today,

1141
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
there are a couple legitimate ways you can do it.

1142
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Number one, it's on the C64 Mini.

1143
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
That's what made me think about this game out of nowhere,

1144
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
is that it's actually on the C64 Mini.

1145
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So if you have that, it's one of the games.

1146
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And you don't have to sideload it or anything.

1147
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It's one of the quote-unquote legit games that's on the C64 Mini.

1148
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So you can check it out there.

1149
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Also, if you have Antstream, which I backed on Kickstarter.

1150
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I think that's a year old now.

1151
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I backed that on Kickstarter a year ago,

1152
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and Antstream's out in the UK.

1153
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I don't know if they ever officially launched in the US.

1154
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I think COVID things might have set them back,

1155
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
or they're in beta or something.

1156
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But if you have access to Antstream,

1157
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
both the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum versions are on Antstream.

1158
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
That is how I played the Spectrum version, finally,

1159
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
after all these years.

1160
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And I'm sorry, the Spectrum version is garbage compared to the Commodore 64 version.

1161
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Some people from their childhood memories

1162
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
are going to strongly disagree with me on that comment.

1163
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I don't give a fuck.

1164
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I stand by it because the Spectrum could not replicate this music

1165
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
and was just not capable of the same type of platforming

1166
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
that the Commodore 64 was.

1167
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
But I'm sure some of you overseas who grew up on the ZX

1168
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
are going to want to fight me on that comment,

1169
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
and that's fine.

1170
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
We'll fight.

1171
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
But please at least try the Commodore 64 version as well.

1172
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And hey, I would still say play the ZX Spectrum version

1173
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
because it was so popular,

1174
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and it's interesting to see all the differences.

1175
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
You know, in this day and age, it's always about

1176
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Nintendo versus Microsoft versus Sony.

1177
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony.

1178
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony.

1179
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And we don't really talk about other companies.

1180
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Once in a great while, we might talk about Google

1181
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
or one of these other newer players, you know, in televisions,

1182
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
they've got a thing.

1183
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
But the reality is, in 85, when this game was made,

1184
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
you had Atari.

1185
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You had Commodore.

1186
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
You had Texas Instruments.

1187
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
You had ZX Spectrum.

1188
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You had MSX.

1189
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I mean, there was so...

1190
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You had Coleco.

1191
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Everybody had a fucking system,

1192
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
and games had to be ported everywhere.

1193
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
So...

1194
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Oh, man.

1195
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
One of these days, we need to bring up one of those old...

1196
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You guys have to look it up.

1197
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Maybe somebody can link it in chat.

1198
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Go find, like, an old 80s gaming magazine ad

1199
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
for a popular game of the time,

1200
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and notice how there's, like, 12 screenshots

1201
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
showing you what the game looks like on 12 different systems.

1202
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That is something that used to be a big part of gaming in the 80s

1203
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
that, I mean, as much as it might feel,

1204
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
oh, Nintendo versus Sony versus Microsoft,

1205
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
it was nothing compared to what we dealt with back then.

1206
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Back in my day...

1207
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
We had to go through all of these different screenshots.

1208
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Anyway, there it is.

1209
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Monty on the Run, your classic game of the week,

1210
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
as chosen by me.

1211
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Some comments from chat.

1212
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Let's see.

1213
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
SHO 100 Matt says,

1214
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Rob is like, don't at me, fight me.

1215
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Pretty much, sorry.

1216
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Fifth Dream says,

1217
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Yeah, most of these aren't ports

1218
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
so much as game with the same name,

1219
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and beyond that, they're not recognizable.

1220
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Yeah, that happens sometimes.

1221
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Let's see.

1222
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Pixelpaca says,

1223
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
These game names when talking about the Monty and Mole series.

1224
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Yeah, that's a little crazy.

1225
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Bobby Blackwolf also says,

1226
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And the best part of this is that all these games

1227
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
came out in the span of one year.

1228
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Just kidding.

1229
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
You know what, though?

1230
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Like, five games probably came out

1231
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
in the scope of, like, five years, though,

1232
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
so maybe a little more,

1233
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
because one of them was on the TurboGrafx,

1234
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
so that would have been till later,

1235
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
but games didn't take us.

1236
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Games could be developed by, like, a team of three.

1237
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Relatively quickly.

1238
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So, anyway.

1239
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I like Monty on the Run.

1240
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Did you guys like the soundtrack?

1241
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Those of you that could hear it,

1242
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
was it coming through okay?

1243
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Hopefully it was.

1244
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Have you ever,

1245
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
you've probably never played this game,

1246
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
have you, Loki?

1247
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And you probably have no idea

1248
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
of the soundtrack either.

1249
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Well, you need to fix that

1250
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
because it's a great soundtrack.

1251
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Well, I heard the soundtrack in the video,

1252
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
but, like, I haven't,

1253
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
no, I have not played the game.

1254
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I didn't have a,

1255
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
my friend down the street had a Commodore 64

1256
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and all we used to play on that

1257
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
was a game called Kickstart.

1258
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I think it's Kickstart.

1259
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And it was, like, a little,

1260
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
what was it, like, a dirt bike game

1261
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
you could set up your own tracks

1262
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
and stuff like that.

1263
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Okay.

1264
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I think that's what it was called.

1265
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And then, yeah,

1266
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I think that's all we ever played on that

1267
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
because I think that Commodore 64

1268
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
was actually his brother's computer

1269
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
and so he didn't get to use it very often,

1270
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
but sometimes he did.

1271
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And his brother owned the TurboGrafx-16 too.

1272
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, technically the Commodore 64 was my dad's,

1273
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
but, like, that was my system.

1274
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I mean, we had an Atari 2600,

1275
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
but I played nothing but that Commodore 64

1276
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
probably until the Nintendo Entertainment System was out.

1277
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And that was when the Commodore 64

1278
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
finally started to sunset a bit.

1279
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It was, like, 88, 89.

1280
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Although, honestly, really, Commodore 64,

1281
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
well, there's still homebrew out there today

1282
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
for the 64, but reality is

1283
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
the enthusiasm was probably still going into the early 90s

1284
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
because I wanted to say, like, 88 was probably

1285
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
when, like, Geos started to really take over

1286
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
on the Commodore 64,

1287
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
which was the graphic operating system.

1288
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
But I want to say that finally Commodore 64,

1289
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
we started to see a lot less of that

1290
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
when we got into the early 90s.

1291
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
But it was a great machine.

1292
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I learned a lot from that little machine.

1293
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So, yeah.

1294
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Anyway.

1295
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah, Kickstarter was like the trials of the Commodore 64.

1296
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So, you know, it's a side-scrolling motorcycle racing game.

1297
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
That's cool.

1298
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I like that, though.

1299
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Cool, cool.

1300
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
All right, let's move on.

1301
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
We got some more gaming news,

1302
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
including some rapid-fire news.

1303
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
So, quickly, a few headlines from the week.

1304
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Loki.

1305
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yes, so this is pretty exciting.

1306
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So, Dead by Daylight,

1307
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
and I think we may have talked about this

1308
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
when they announced it originally,

1309
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
but it's actually out now.

1310
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So, Dead by Daylight is getting a Silent Hill expansion as well.

1311
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
They've been doing a bunch of different expansions

1312
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
with all different horror genres or franchises.

1313
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So, now you have the Dead by Daylight Silent Hill season.

1314
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It's going to cost you $7.

1315
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And I'm trying to see what it gives you as far as...

1316
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Usually, it's like a creature.

1317
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
So, in this case, it's a germanet.

1318
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And we did talk a little bit about this last week before it released,

1319
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
but obviously, the release is out,

1320
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
and now we know a few more things about it.

1321
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So, yeah.

1322
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Yeah, so Pyramid Head is going to be the monster chasing you down,

1323
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
or you can play as that monster.

1324
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm not sure who the protagonists are that they're going to have in this.

1325
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
It was Heather, wasn't it?

1326
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It looks like it based on the screenshots.

1327
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So, I don't know.

1328
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Looks cool.

1329
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I don't...

1330
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And then, of course, Silent Hill being the actual level

1331
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
that you can play in as well.

1332
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
So, that's pretty sweet.

1333
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Yeah, neat.

1334
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I don't know.

1335
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I really should check this game out.

1336
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I mean, they have a lot of different things.

1337
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
They have Stranger Things, Crossover, Saw, Nightmare on Elm Street,

1338
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Left 4 Dead.

1339
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So, lots of cool stuff.

1340
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm amazed to see this game having so many crossovers

1341
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
of different franchises that are owned by different people.

1342
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
So, pretty cool.

1343
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I am Canadian47 in chat says,

1344
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Dead by Daylight, on what operating systems?

1345
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It would be for all of them, right?

1346
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I mean, obviously, PlayStation gets a lot of coverage.

1347
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
But Dead by Daylight's on Steam.

1348
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I'm almost positive it's on Xbox as well.

1349
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Is it on Switch?

1350
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I don't know if it's on Switch.

1351
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I don't know.

1352
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
No, it is on Switch.

1353
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So, yeah, PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

1354
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So, it's pretty much everywhere.

1355
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Yeah, so it's like if...

1356
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I don't think it's the 4v1.

1357
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I think it's 2v1, maybe.

1358
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Or at least I've seen...

1359
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It could be maybe 4v1.

1360
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
It reminds me a lot of the Nightmare Island 3.

1361
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Friday the 13th game, but with different genres

1362
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
or different franchises.

1363
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
So, pretty cool.

1364
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And then this is kind of neat to go along with

1365
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
all these games coming back with unexpected sequels.

1366
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
So, apparently there was a leak

1367
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
talking about a brand new Crash Bandicoot game

1368
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
called Crash Bandicoot 4, It's About Time.

1369
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
And they had some box art leak

1370
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version.

1371
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It looks like it's being developed by Toys for Bob.

1372
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And apparently, though, there was an announcement

1373
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
via Twitter from...

1374
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Was it Jeff Keighley saying that they're gonna be talking about...

1375
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
They're doing the full reveal on Monday,

1376
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
showing off what this game's about.

1377
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So, that's pretty cool.

1378
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
New Crash Bandicoot game.

1379
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I guess it makes sense since the remasters are very popular.

1380
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So, might as well make a new one.

1381
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Yeah, it just goes to show if you kind of support the old stuff,

1382
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
it usually will generate the interest in the new stuff.

1383
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
So, that's pretty cool.

1384
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
So, I'm looking forward to seeing

1385
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
whatever they come up with for this game.

1386
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Now that they've pretty much confirmed these leaks

1387
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
and basically said,

1388
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
yeah, okay, we're showing it tomorrow.

1389
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Yeah, I saw that Jeff Keighley tweet

1390
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
right before we went live tonight.

1391
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So, yeah.

1392
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
It's a cute stuff secret now.

1393
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It is, it is.

1394
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Well, this is no secret anymore.

1395
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Cyberpunk 2077 had its release date delayed again.

1396
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And that made the rounds around the internet this week

1397
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
is that Cyberpunk 2077 has been delayed

1398
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
now until 19 November,

1399
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
which is a throwback to an old Bomani classic.

1400
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
But yeah, it's been delayed.

1401
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
They posted a letter

1402
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
and basically saying that the situation about...

1403
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
They're ironing out bugs

1404
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and making sure all parts of the game

1405
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
are balanced and working properly.

1406
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And this has caused things to basically get pushed back.

1407
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And it's, I think, in one sense,

1408
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
people are kind of going,

1409
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
ugh, because it's not the first time it's been pushed back.

1410
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
But on the other hand,

1411
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
hey, would you want the game to come out and be buggy

1412
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
and just end up shooting itself in the foot as a result?

1413
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
You know what?

1414
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
With COVID and everything that's going on

1415
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
and folks now working from home and things like that,

1416
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
it's for the best.

1417
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Delays are never fun.

1418
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
But at the same time, when the game comes out

1419
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
and if it's as wonderful as everybody hopes it's going to be,

1420
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
nobody will remember the delay.

1421
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Insert Miyamoto quote here, et cetera, et cetera.

1422
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Witcher 3 got delayed, I think it was about 74 times

1423
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
before it finally came out.

1424
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And then Witcher 3 was great, right?

1425
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And now it even has a Netflix series and all that stuff.

1426
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
So, right?

1427
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Was Witcher 3 delayed about 74 times?

1428
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I think that's about right.

1429
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yeah.

1430
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Give or take.

1431
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I don't remember.

1432
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
See, but that's the point.

1433
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
No one remembers how many times the game was delayed.

1434
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Exactly.

1435
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
All right.

1436
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
S2100matt says, I'm fine with this.

1437
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I'm going to be playing this game a ton

1438
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and I would really like it to be a non-buggy mess.

1439
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
It also makes me want to wait on getting it on one of the new consoles.

1440
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
BobbyBlackWolf says, Animal Crossing was delayed.

1441
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Nobody cares now.

1442
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Questbuster says, not surprised it was delayed.

1443
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Would rather they take their time on it than rush things.

1444
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Yes.

1445
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
So, that part.

1446
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I think everybody here understands it's going to get delayed

1447
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
and that's just fine.

1448
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
We want to do another follow-up here to the itch.io bundle

1449
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
we've been talking about for a couple weeks on the show.

1450
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It was the itch.io bundle for racial justice and equality.

1451
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I think last week on the show before we signed off,

1452
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
we were saying, hooray, it passed $7 million.

1453
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
We'll get this before they actually close the doors on it.

1454
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
$8.1 million raised.

1455
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
That is awesome.

1456
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Great.

1457
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Yeah.

1458
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It was over 814,000 donations.

1459
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
That means most people were actually paying more of like an average of $10 for it

1460
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
when only five was being asked for.

1461
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
So, that's kind of rad as well.

1462
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Now, granted, I'm sure there were some people that put down like $100, $250,

1463
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and there were some people that probably could only afford five.

1464
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And I'm not judging, shaming, or any of that stuff.

1465
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I'm just saying that's neat that the average was about double what they were asking for.

1466
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
That's pretty rad.

1467
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
So, yeah, congrats to everybody involved with that.

1468
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I do want to point out, and I think it's been scrolling along the ticker bar at the bottom,

1469
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
but I think it's worth pointing out the itch.io efforts

1470
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
and the gaming community's efforts to raise money

1471
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
because, again, just because the media is talking about it less and all this stuff,

1472
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
it doesn't mean this fight and this struggle is still not going on.

1473
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Let us not forget the police who killed Breonna Taylor

1474
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
are still not in jail themselves or on trial or any of that stuff.

1475
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
One's been fired? Wow.

1476
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
That is the tip of the iceberg.

1477
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So, there's plenty more discussion to be had on these topics throughout our society

1478
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
and there are going to be plenty more fundraisers to come.

1479
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Not as many people talking about this one because itch.io rolled right into a new bundle,

1480
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
and I think this is worth pointing out.

1481
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Now, it might not be 1,700 games, but it's still quite a few.

1482
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It's regularly about $100 worth of stuff, 23 items in it right now.

1483
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It's Chicago New Media Artists for Racial Justice, and the goal is $10,000,

1484
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and they're sitting on about $2,800 right now.

1485
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Now, this bundle, they're asking for $20,

1486
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
but you've got quite a few games in this as well that are worth it right there.

1487
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Octodad, Octodad Deadliest Catch, so if you're like a Bugsnax person right now,

1488
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
you can check that out in this bundle.

1489
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Biorhythm, Plant Daddy, Antbassador, so on and so on.

1490
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
There's lots and lots of stuff there, so check that out.

1491
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,000
itch.io has a brand new bundle for Chicago New Media Artists for Racial Justice.

1492
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And there's going to be lots more charity events, I'm sure, in the coming months,

1493
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
and so forth, so stay tuned.

1494
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates

1495
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
for what is coming out real soon in a country near you.

1496
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Loki, how about the US?

1497
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Well, we've got Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 coming out on PC,

1498
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Kingdom Hearts Dark Road on Android and iOS,

1499
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,000
we've got Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary World Tour on Nintendo Switch,

1500
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Little Town Hero on PlayStation 4,

1501
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
SpongeBob SquarePants Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated on PC,

1502
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One,

1503
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Star Wars Episode 1 Racer on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4,

1504
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,000
and also we've got Pokemon Cafe Mix on Nintendo Switch, Android, and iOS,

1505
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
and last, oh, I'm sorry, there's actually a few more,

1506
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Ninjala on Nintendo Switch,

1507
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Brigadain the Legend of Runeseria, that's on Nintendo Switch,

1508
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Collar Cross Malice on Nintendo Switch,

1509
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
and Death Come True, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android,

1510
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:25,000
and last but not least, Mr. Driller Land on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1511
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
All right. Heading over to Japan, there's actually quite a big overlap,

1512
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
a lot of those games I just heard Loki mention,

1513
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
also coming out in Japan this week on the Switch,

1514
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,000
that Brigadain the Legend of Runersia,

1515
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
it's a tactical RPG it looks like, that is coming out in Japan as well on the Switch.

1516
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:49,000
We also have Shujo Jigoku no Doku Musume is coming out as well.

1517
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
This game is Made in Hell,

1518
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
a hell where girls captured by strong emotions, desires,

1519
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
and obstructive thoughts fall regardless of life or death.

1520
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
This sounds interesting to say the least,

1521
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and I have no idea what kind of game it is,

1522
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
but I'm sure somebody out there is into it.

1523
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Also, we have Mr. Driller Encore is what they're calling it in Japan,

1524
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
and that is coming out for the Switch,

1525
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and I heard that in the U.S. releases as well,

1526
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
but it's called Mr. Driller Encore overseas.

1527
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Human Fall Flat is also out on the Switch in Japan this week,

1528
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
so those are the Switch releases.

1529
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
PlayStation 4 I imagine is some very similar stuff.

1530
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
We have a game called Death Match Love Comedy.

1531
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Wow, it's all my favorite things rolled into one title.

1532
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Death Match Love Comedy is coming out.

1533
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It is another visual novel,

1534
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
but basically in this story,

1535
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,000
if a girl falls in love with you, it means your death.

1536
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
In this game, the player is a guy who just got transferred to a new school,

1537
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and if a girl confesses her love to him, he explodes and dies.

1538
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And I think he's pretty safe.

1539
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Wow, this game sounds rad.

1540
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I'm going to live forever.

1541
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
She's a jerk to everybody.

1542
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Anyhow, also coming out in Japan,

1543
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
that same Shujo Jiko no Duko Musume,

1544
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Journey to the Savage Planet,

1545
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
and then FIFA 20 gets a price reduction

1546
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
as it moves into the best hits collection over in Japan.

1547
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
So those are the Japanese releases.

1548
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
How about the UK releases, Loki?

1549
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
So we've got, let's see,

1550
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Seto Corsa Competizone on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1551
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated on Xbox One,

1552
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch and PC,

1553
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
a game called Rush VR on the PlayStation 4,

1554
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Indivisible on the Nintendo Switch,

1555
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
we've got Farmer's Dynasty on Nintendo Switch,

1556
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Journey to the Savage Planet on Nintendo Switch,

1557
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Dungeons 3 Complete Collection on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1558
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
and that's it.

1559
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
All right, let's travel to the mailbag.

1560
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Every week you guys send us emails,

1561
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
participate at orangelaungeradio.com,

1562
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
and we read some of our favorites here on the air.

1563
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
We do have an email this week that's in our mailbag

1564
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
at participate at orangelaungeradio.com,

1565
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
and we hope we'll get even more next week.

1566
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But this week's email comes to us from Ziba.

1567
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Always good to hear from Ziba.

1568
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So the email goes like this,

1569
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Hey all, I haven't really been able to watch live lately

1570
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
due to my work schedule.

1571
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
That's okay. That's why we have a podcast as well.

1572
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
So I'm glad you're still with us.

1573
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Anyway, I wanted to talk about a game

1574
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I started playing again after many years.

1575
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I needed a game to play while I take a short break

1576
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
from Final Fantasy XIV.

1577
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
There is a content lull in Final Fantasy XIV right now,

1578
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
so I understand. I still play.

1579
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I even have a new free company,

1580
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
and I've met some new people in there,

1581
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
but it's just like, the content's a little dry,

1582
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
and it's understandable.

1583
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Things have been delayed due to COVID,

1584
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
so I've also been cheating with other games.

1585
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So anyway, sorry, Ziba. I keep getting derailed.

1586
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Let's see, while I take a short break from Final Fantasy XIV.

1587
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Of all the games I have in my backlog,

1588
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I decided to go back to Guild Wars 2.

1589
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
This game came out in 2012,

1590
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and let me tell you, it's still very beautiful and fun.

1591
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
The combat still feels very fresh and easy to learn.

1592
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
The main story is pretty good,

1593
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
and there are a lot of events that people still participate in.

1594
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
There's even some PvP and World vs. World

1595
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
that is separate from the PvE content that I heard is fun.

1596
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
However, the game feels kind of slow at first

1597
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
because you don't get any mounts until the second expansion at level 80.

1598
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
But the best thing about Guild Wars 2 is that the base game is free.

1599
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I almost forgot that the game was free now until my brother-in-law looked it up.

1600
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
There are microtransactions in the game,

1601
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
but as far as I know, they don't really sell any pay-to-win items.

1602
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Anyway, I highly recommend downloading it

1603
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
if you need to take a break from another game, like me,

1604
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
or if you are looking for a good free online game.

1605
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I'm having tons of fun,

1606
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
and I'm having trouble going back to Final Fantasy XIV.

1607
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Happy Father's Day to all the dads and fur dads out there.

1608
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Ziba, thank you so much for the email,

1609
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and thanks for the reminder about Guild Wars 2.

1610
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I played that game when it was first out,

1611
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
and I think at the time it was more like an alternative to World of Warcraft for me

1612
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
because in 2012, I don't think Final Fantasy XIV was quite out yet.

1613
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
So I was playing it in the beginning, and it was very nice.

1614
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I would like to go back and visit it again

1615
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
now that I have a better computer

1616
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
that will probably make the game look even better

1617
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
than it did in 2012, 2013 when I first played it.

1618
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I couldn't, for the life of me, remember my old login,

1619
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
but now that you tell me that the base game is free,

1620
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
maybe I don't have to worry about that anymore.

1621
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I wonder if, because I bought the game at one point in time,

1622
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I'll get some sort of kickback if I can remember my login.

1623
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I imagine it's got to be one of two emails, maybe three,

1624
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
that the game is tied to.

1625
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
So if I did a password reset on those emails,

1626
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I ought to be able to figure it out and get my way back in there at some point.

1627
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
But that's really cool that the base game is at least free,

1628
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
even if I'd bought it all that time ago.

1629
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
So that's, yeah, that's really cool.

1630
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So, the whole chat, oh, I didn't even see that during that email, Loki,

1631
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
you brought Stella, and Stella's taking a nap on your shoulder right now.

1632
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Well, she was standing there screaming at me, so I had to pick her up.

1633
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Okay, so a lot of folks in chat are noticing that.

1634
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I had my face deep in that email there, so I didn't even notice that.

1635
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Aw, pretty kitty.

1636
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Okay, well, thank you, Zeba, for the email, and keep having fun in Guild Wars 2.

1637
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I might check that out as well, because, yeah, I'm also,

1638
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I'm in a little bit of a contract drought in Final Fantasy XIV.

1639
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Like, I still have fun. Like, Shane and I will get on and do Fates,

1640
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
and we kind of find things to entertain ourselves,

1641
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
but it'll last for an hour or two, and then it's like,

1642
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
all right, I'm ready to play something else, you know, so that's cool.

1643
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I'll check out Guild Wars 2 again. That's a good tip.

1644
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Thank you for the email.

1645
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
All right, that's it for our emails.

1646
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
So if you want to send us an email for a future week,

1647
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
participate at orangesondrader.com is the place to do it.

1648
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Meanwhile, we're going to get to our next story,

1649
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
and for those watching live on Twitch, don't be alarmed.

1650
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I'm just going to step away, because I really badly need some water,

1651
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
so I'll be back while Loki takes care of this next story. Loki.

1652
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
All right, so let's talk a little bit about Fortnite again,

1653
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
and apparently they're breaking Twitch records with a brand new event

1654
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
that they live-streamed with 2.3 million live viewers

1655
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
across multiple channels on Twitch,

1656
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
which is apparently surpassing the previous record,

1657
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
which was just over 1.7 million viewers

1658
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
during last year's World Championship of League of Legends.

1659
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:46,000
This also surpassed their last really big event,

1660
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
which is the Black Hole event that started the game's second chapter.

1661
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Well, this one now, I don't remember if it's a brand new chapter to the game or not,

1662
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
but basically they had some sort of device that was fighting back the storm

1663
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
that now flooded or sunk the whole map into water,

1664
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
and they have a new event now that actually has Aquaman in there and stuff.

1665
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
So I actually watched kind of a replay of it, and it looked neat.

1666
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I mean, they do a lot of these big cinematic events

1667
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
that the change of a different chapter or season or something like that.

1668
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So I don't know, it's kind of neat,

1669
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
and they change up the map a little bit doing that sort of thing.

1670
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I still haven't really been playing this game,

1671
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
but I know a lot of people really like it.

1672
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
It's probably going to be one of these days.

1673
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
It'll be like Minecraft where I just get into it way late in the game and find out.

1674
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
There's always these random events and things

1675
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
that make me want to check out Fortnite just out of the blue,

1676
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:53,000
but I still can't process the strategy of building things as you play Fortnite.

1677
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I've always struggled during that game.

1678
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I don't think it matters because my son, who's six,

1679
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
he's gotten second place in those matches before.

1680
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So I don't know if it necessarily is a really high-skill-based game.

1681
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I mean, aside from there's real competitive play,

1682
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
but just running into the normal games,

1683
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I don't think that you have to be an expert at games to be able to do it.

1684
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And I think you would kind of pick up the whole building mechanic later on,

1685
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
but you can probably still have fun with it.

1686
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Phoenix7726 in chat says,

1687
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
But will there be another Travis Scott concert?

1688
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That was a trip how they did that.

1689
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Honestly, probably.

1690
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Depends how long this COVID pandemic keeps going.

1691
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I mean, who's to say?

1692
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I don't know.

1693
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Without getting too far off base,

1694
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
the reality is we know a lot of places are spiking right now.

1695
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
They're just going up and not showing any signs of slowing down.

1696
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I suppose one of the few positives about that situation,

1697
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
although I kind of feel like the people that will die and stuff

1698
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
is it's not a positive situation at all,

1699
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
but that's how you're going to get herd immunity.

1700
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
So I don't know.

1701
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I don't know.

1702
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,000
But my point is if this COVID thing kind of keeps going on,

1703
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
like think about it.

1704
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
The entire live entertainment industry right now

1705
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
is pretty fucked.

1706
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Like when was the last concert that happened?

1707
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
A while ago, yeah.

1708
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I mean, I remember when Gaga did the concert at home fundraiser thing,

1709
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
but we all know those are special and few and far between.

1710
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And I'm sure those of you that follow like drag queens like I do,

1711
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
you've probably seen a lot of the drag queen virtual shows.

1712
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And that's really cool that they're bridging the gap

1713
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
and coming up with these clever ideas on how to do it.

1714
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And I'm not going to knock those things.

1715
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I understand they've got to make money and pay their rent

1716
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
and eat their food too.

1717
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
But the reality is like that's it.

1718
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
People are having to come up with new ideas

1719
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
because we can't gather right now.

1720
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And we're not going to be able to gather for some time if this keeps going.

1721
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So as far as when is the next Travis Scott concert happen in Fortnite,

1722
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I think the realistic answer is that depends.

1723
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
When does COVID go away?

1724
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Because if COVID goes away soon,

1725
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
then probably probably won't see those types of events very often again.

1726
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Well, if COVID is here to stay for a little while,

1727
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
you'll probably probably the beginning of many.

1728
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Right.

1729
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Yes. Okay.

1730
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
So that's why I'm walking the keyboard.

1731
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
So the cat was ready to go now.

1732
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
She's like, I want to get up on here and walk on some keyboard.

1733
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
So I don't know.

1734
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
The problem is too, even though you have them locking stuff down.

1735
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
So for those who may not live in California,

1736
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,000
recently the governor mandated that now masks have to be worn out

1737
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
when you go to indoor locations.

1738
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
But nobody's enforcing it, which is...

1739
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Right, exactly.

1740
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So you have, like I was at the grocery store the other day,

1741
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
getting groceries as usual and having a mask on.

1742
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
And there's the people that this is intended to protect,

1743
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,000
the high-risk groups, like the elderly,

1744
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
those really young children like babies and stuff.

1745
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
These people just don't care.

1746
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
They're just out there.

1747
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I'm sorry, it just bothers me so much,

1748
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
the people that refuse to wear a mask.

1749
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
It's just so ridiculous.

1750
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
And I get there are a couple legitimate reasons

1751
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
why someone might not wear a mask.

1752
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
There are a few medical conditions.

1753
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Somebody that speaks ASL and needs to be able to do that.

1754
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And just a few.

1755
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
But let's be real, Loki.

1756
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Those exceptions, they are exceptions.

1757
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
They are few and far between.

1758
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And we're seeing way more people not wearing a mask

1759
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
than it makes logical sense to be exceptions.

1760
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Or just not wearing them at all correctly,

1761
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
like where their nose is sticking out,

1762
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
or I saw someone that had it around their neck.

1763
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Or there's a dude that was in there,

1764
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
he had one on and took it off to go look at something.

1765
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
He was on his phone and took it off

1766
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
and just was doing his phone.

1767
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
When somebody doesn't wear a mask,

1768
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
you know what that says to me?

1769
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
It says to me, I don't care if you live or die.

1770
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I don't care.

1771
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I don't care if you live or die.

1772
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
That's what it says when you don't,

1773
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
because you're wearing a mask to help protect other people.

1774
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
And you can have this disease without actually feeling sick.

1775
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
When you're not wearing a mask, you say, I don't care.

1776
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I don't care if you die.

1777
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
That's what you're saying.

1778
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And that blows my mind that you have so many people

1779
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
willing to look at you in the eye

1780
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
and say, basically, I don't care if you die.

1781
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And that, like, I just want to slap them.

1782
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
And I'm not a violent person,

1783
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and I don't condone that type of stuff at all,

1784
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
but I just want to slap them,

1785
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
because that person doesn't care.

1786
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It's so... Now, I don't, because, you know,

1787
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
maybe it's one of those, you know,

1788
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
maybe it is one of those, like, 1% of people

1789
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
that have a valid exception that I talked about before,

1790
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:15,000
but it's just so infuriating, so infuriating.

1791
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Why do I wear pants in public?

1792
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
You know what?

1793
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I'm going to just not wear pants to the store.

1794
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Why should I?

1795
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I don't like pants.

1796
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
They're uncomfortable.

1797
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
They're not going to say anything.

1798
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
They make me itch.

1799
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
It's uncomfortable.

1800
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I'm not going to wear pants anymore.

1801
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Why should I?

1802
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I don't... It shouldn't be that hard.

1803
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
You know, everybody is accepted for a long time.

1804
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
There are signs at businesses that say,

1805
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
no shirt, no shoes, no service.

1806
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Why is that not a problem for people,

1807
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
but now we just say, no shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service,

1808
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
and now suddenly it's a giant...

1809
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I'm being oppressed!

1810
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
The government!

1811
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Recall Gavin Newsom!

1812
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Fuck you!

1813
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I just wish that natural selection

1814
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
would happen a little faster, please.

1815
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I mean, I get that there's certain groups of individuals

1816
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
that decide that they don't want to follow

1817
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
any of these procedures for their own safety,

1818
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
and I take that as that they accept the consequences of that,

1819
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
but I would just like those consequences

1820
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
to add a little faster, please, so we can get over with all this.

1821
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Anyway, all right. I'm sorry.

1822
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Sorry, I allowed tangent training to happen,

1823
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,000
but number one, it was a chat comment that started it.

1824
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
You started it.

1825
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
All right, anyway.

1826
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
But it's been bugging me.

1827
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
It's really been bugging me.

1828
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Yeah, well, technically I was saying,

1829
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
so I wear a face guard,

1830
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and that's a good alternative.

1831
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
That's fine.

1832
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
If you find that mask is hard to breathe in,

1833
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
then that's a perfect alternative.

1834
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Look, you don't have to justify to me because you're trying.

1835
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I think if it's not very clear,

1836
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
it's very clear there are an abundance of people out there

1837
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
that do not give a fuck,

1838
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
and that's the people I'm mad at.

1839
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
So, yeah, if you have to do a mask or a guard or whatever,

1840
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
okay, cool.

1841
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
You're taking precautions,

1842
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
and that's more we can say for a lot of people.

1843
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
So, yikes.

1844
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Anyway, let's see.

1845
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
BooBlue2 in chat says,

1846
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I've seen people take the mask off to talk to someone.

1847
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Like, bitch, that's when you want it the most.

1848
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
So horrible.

1849
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Anyway, so here's the thing.

1850
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I'm going to be honest about something.

1851
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
So, like, Alan and I have kind of tried the whole,

1852
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
like, let's go to restaurants again thing,

1853
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
and you might find that it's weird that I just went on that whole rant,

1854
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
yet I'm willing to go out and go to restaurants,

1855
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
but the thing is restaurants are taking precautions.

1856
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
The restaurants that we've been to thus far,

1857
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
you have, you know, people are seating at every other table.

1858
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
You're not really sharing menus.

1859
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
It's not the same that it was before.

1860
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
There are precautions all over the place in a restaurant.

1861
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
However, yesterday we went out to eat,

1862
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
and I swear five minutes into the meal I wanted to get up and go.

1863
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
You know why?

1864
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
The wait staff wasn't wearing masks.

1865
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
People were coming in with no mask.

1866
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I'm going to tell you, if I get COVID, I got it from that restaurant,

1867
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
and there's a part of me that's, like, kind of mad at myself

1868
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
for putting myself in that situation,

1869
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and, like, maybe, okay, maybe I guess I shouldn't have gone out,

1870
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
but I'm also kind of mad as hell that they're not following the,

1871
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
like, I'm not going to go back there,

1872
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
and after the pandemic is over,

1873
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I probably will not go back there.

1874
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Yeah, I mean, that's ridiculous because especially those, I mean,

1875
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
patrons coming into those locations,

1876
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I would see as necessarily, like,

1877
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
you're not going to be able to necessarily enforce that

1878
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
unless the actual location's enforcing or somehow they get caught.

1879
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
But if, you know, employees are not doing that,

1880
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I mean, that could shut your whole place down.

1881
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
That's ridiculous to even risk that.

1882
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
But I know there's some folks that are just, like,

1883
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
well, we're just not going to enforce it,

1884
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
and they can't catch everybody.

1885
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
You know, they're not going to be checking up on it,

1886
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and there's even departments, like, hold, like, I want to say Modesto say,

1887
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
well, we're not enforcing this.

1888
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
We're not going to arrest you because you don't have a mask on.

1889
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So, I mean, that's just basically saying, though, okay,

1890
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
go out and do whatever you want.

1891
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I mean, originally, like, when they were talking about not arresting folks

1892
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
for doing stuff, it was like, you know, if we see you out walking,

1893
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
you know, for exercise, we're not going to say, well, where are you going?

1894
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Are you going to the grocery store?

1895
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Are you doing this for exercise?

1896
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Are you going to a person's house?

1897
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
They're not going to stop you for that because they can't.

1898
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
But, I mean, I think when there's a regulation,

1899
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
and it's not like you don't know that this is a thing.

1900
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,000
They had, like, giant, giant, like, signs out there saying,

1901
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
look, this is a brand new regulation.

1902
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
You know, it's in bright neon.

1903
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
You can't miss it.

1904
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
It's like, how do you not know that this is a thing?

1905
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
You read it when you walked in.

1906
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
You just don't care.

1907
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Anyway, if I miss the next show, like, you know, I'm not,

1908
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I'm not really into, like, shaming people and dragging through the mud

1909
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
or whatever, but I'm going to say as Loki,

1910
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
that Indian restaurant down the street, like,

1911
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
if I'm not here in the next episode, shut them down.

1912
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
That's all I have to say, okay?

1913
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Alan knows the one. All right.

1914
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Anyway, and that is, I'm not,

1915
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
it is just my particular experience, a particular place,

1916
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
and just, I'm just saying that much on the air.

1917
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I don't want you to think I am painting a broad stroke.

1918
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
All my other experiences have been fine thus far

1919
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
with plenty of precautions,

1920
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
but I was really, really uncomfortable with this particular one

1921
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
that just happened yesterday.

1922
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
In fact, I'm still kind of in like a,

1923
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
how the hell did I let that happen type of thing.

1924
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
All right, anyway.

1925
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Let's see, moving on.

1926
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Let's move on to a different subject before I get depressed.

1927
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Moving on, let's talk about, well,

1928
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
this is actually kind of sad as well.

1929
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
PAX West and Australia not going to be happening this year.

1930
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I mean, I don't know, I kind of,

1931
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I stopped going to those conventions a couple of years ago

1932
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
just because they're kind of large and out of control.

1933
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I don't know, I always kind of think, like,

1934
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
maybe I wouldn't mind going again, like, one more time in the future.

1935
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
But it won't be this year, that's for sure,

1936
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
because PAX West and PAX Australia were canceled.

1937
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
They were replaced by PAX Online.

1938
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
PAX Online is going to be a series of livestream shows,

1939
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
panel discussions, video game demos,

1940
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
going to happen from September 12th through the 20th.

1941
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
That's like a nine-day event that they're going to be doing.

1942
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
So it's kind of like,

1943
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
basically they're taking the panel portion of it

1944
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
and taking it online, adding some game demos into that,

1945
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
so that'll be kind of neat.

1946
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
It's like yet another game announcement event,

1947
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
so it's like they won't end with the summer,

1948
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
but that's still pretty cool.

1949
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
You know, it's a bummer about what happened,

1950
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
but is anyone really surprised?

1951
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Nope.

1952
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Nope.

1953
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
No, I mean, everything else has been, like, canceled

1954
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
or delayed or converted to a digital, you know, event instead.

1955
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Not surprised.

1956
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Literally the only thing that I know that is still scheduled to happen right now

1957
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
is Dragon Con,

1958
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and I think a lot of that has to do with the politics of the state

1959
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
that it's in right now

1960
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
and trying to navigate a lot of those waters.

1961
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
We're still not quite 60 days out.

1962
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
We will be in a couple weeks.

1963
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
All I know is that I see some interesting chess pieces

1964
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
with the hotels moving.

1965
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Even more hotels are starting to say,

1966
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
if you want to move your reso to 2021,

1967
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
they haven't all done it yet,

1968
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
but more and more of them are starting to do it,

1969
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
so I kind of feel like I just don't...

1970
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Even if they have a Dragon Con this year,

1971
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
it's going to be weird,

1972
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
like, because I bet none of the celebrities

1973
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
are going to end up there.

1974
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
There's not going to be a parade.

1975
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
There's still going to be a lot of panels and stuff,

1976
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
and that's where I'm struggling,

1977
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
because actually right now I'm still supposed to go to Dragon Con,

1978
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
but I made a promise.

1979
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I said I'm not making any calls

1980
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
until July,

1981
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
because that's 60 days out,

1982
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
and we're going to know more in July,

1983
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
and I still stand by that.

1984
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Right now, my gut just kind of says,

1985
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I don't see, even in the state,

1986
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
like, how it's going to happen,

1987
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
but we'll see.

1988
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I mean, they might...

1989
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
It just seems like they would stand to almost lose more money

1990
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
putting on an event that is just, like,

1991
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
not at the level they usually do,

1992
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
but, I mean, we'll see.

1993
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
There's still a lot can change in the next few weeks.

1994
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
We'll see what happens.

1995
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
All right, after all,

1996
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
our world changed in the scope of about three weeks, right?

1997
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
So, who knows?

1998
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
And that's why I've been very big on it.

1999
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I'm not going to commit one way or the other.

2000
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
It might sound like I'm being very negative on things,

2001
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
but our world changed in three weeks.

2002
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Who's to say it's not going to change again?

2003
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So that's where my mind is at,

2004
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
is I don't want to make any rash decisions

2005
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
as fast as possible.

2006
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
All right, let's move on, however, for now

2007
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
and talk about maybe now some good news,

2008
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
some games doing some good stuff, right?

2009
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I mean, I don't know if it's necessarily good news,

2010
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
but it's interesting.

2011
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
So it's a new treatment for ADHD

2012
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
that is a video game that requires a prescription.

2013
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
So it's apparently targeted for kids with ADHD symptoms

2014
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
between the age of 8 and 12,

2015
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
and it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

2016
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
The game, called EndeavorRx,

2017
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
uses a combination of sensory and motor challenges

2018
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:01,000
to help the player improve cognitive functioning.

2019
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Interesting, though, that it also notes

2020
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
that the game is based on study by doctors

2021
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
who were on the developer's payroll.

2022
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
And let's be honest, I looked at, I mean,

2023
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I don't know the intricacies of this game,

2024
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
but based on the short 30-second trailer that they had,

2025
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
it doesn't look any different than any other, like,

2026
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
it doesn't look like it's something that's extremely unique.

2027
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
So I'm surprised that this would be a,

2028
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
something that would be offered as a prescription.

2029
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Because I can only imagine how expensive that would be.

2030
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
I don't know. It just, it seems a little ridiculous.

2031
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
But it's something that I think we've seen

2032
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
that there have been studies that show that gaming

2033
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
can help with some of these symptoms,

2034
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
but I don't necessarily think it's only this game

2035
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
can help with the symptoms.

2036
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I think it's just, in general,

2037
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,000
and this happens to be something that seems to be taking on,

2038
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I don't know, it sounds like there might be some manipulation

2039
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
going on here in order to get past that FDA approval.

2040
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And I think it's also worth noting, though,

2041
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
that just a prescription doesn't necessarily,

2042
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
isn't necessarily going to make it more expensive.

2043
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Like, I don't know, but there's a lot of cheap stuff

2044
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
you have to get prescription for.

2045
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Like, penicillin is dirt cheap,

2046
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
and a lot of those antibiotics are dirt cheap.

2047
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And like, when I had my dental surgery recently,

2048
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
they gave me prescription ibuprofen, which is cheap,

2049
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
and some mouthwash that's also cheap.

2050
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
So not everything that requires a prescription

2051
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
is necessarily expensive.

2052
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Although, I would imagine this is priced like a normal game,

2053
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
is probably priced, but it is interesting about the whole,

2054
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,000
huh, some of the doctors are also, it's interesting.

2055
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Like, they give you an idea of like, you know,

2056
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
some of the things, the gameplay of this.

2057
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,000
So the gameplay is designed very much like a mobile runner game,

2058
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
where basically you have free pass and you have to dodge

2059
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
or collect things along those paths.

2060
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
And that's all it is.

2061
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Like, you can't tell me that this is a unique idea.

2062
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It's literally hundreds, if not thousands of games out there

2063
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
are like this.

2064
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

2065
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I just, I would worry that like,

2066
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
because it is something that requires a prescription,

2067
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
leads me to believe that, you know,

2068
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
even stuff that has to do with like,

2069
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
other therapies that are out there can be expensive,

2070
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
especially when you're going through like, you know,

2071
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
insurance or through anything that has to do with the medical

2072
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
professions, because, you know, they're going to say, oh, well,

2073
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
there's development costs and stuff like that.

2074
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And I could just see a higher price tag than what actually this

2075
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
should be applied to this. And I'm worried that, you know,

2076
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
with folks wondering for like,

2077
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
trying to find good treatments for something like this,

2078
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
which I am not even sure if like ADHD gets diagnosed like way too

2079
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
much anyways, but.

2080
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I do. I do want to quickly jump in Loki,

2081
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
because I think it's still 100.

2082
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Matt has a very important comment about, you know,

2083
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
what this game really does and the intent as to 100.

2084
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Matt in our chat says to emphasize the point of the game,

2085
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
isn't to buy, play it and expected to just treat ADHD.

2086
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
He's not going to, it's not going to be like a cure or, you know,

2087
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
is it not by itself going to do anything?

2088
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
The point is to play the game in the presence of a clinician,

2089
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
therapist, doctor, so forth.

2090
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
So you can work with that person to process with them different

2091
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
strategies to work through.

2092
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Now that makes a lot of sense because if you think about it,

2093
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
think about all those types of things that like,

2094
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
if you're treating certain types of, you know,

2095
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
mental or even certain type of physical conditions,

2096
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
there are all sorts of different tests, right? Like, you know, every,

2097
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
everybody knows like the ink blot test. Okay.

2098
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
And I'm obviously like oversimplifying something, but like, you know,

2099
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
you got to buy those cards, those paintings of the ink blot somewhere.

2100
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Right. Or the eye tests you do at the doctor.

2101
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
That book, the eye test, they got to come from somewhere. Right.

2102
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,000
So even something like a game being used in treatment still has to come

2103
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
from somewhere. Does that make sense?

2104
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
That makes sense. Yes.

2105
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
So I think that is like, this isn't just, Oh,

2106
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
you're going to have to buy this on steam, but pick up your, you know,

2107
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
file your prescription before you buy it. No,

2108
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
it's not going to be like that at all.

2109
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I think it's going to be the type of thing where it is.

2110
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
And I think as Joe and Hunter Matt kind of puts that really great into

2111
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
perspective, it's another tool, like a book, like a test,

2112
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:34,000
like a game that's used in a clinician's office when meeting with the

2113
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
patient. So as Joe and her mat says,

2114
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
someone can play this game and many may help them focus better,

2115
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
but that person has no idea why it's helping them focus.

2116
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Working with that clinician will help that person process what they're

2117
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
experiencing. So.

2118
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
All right, let's move on. Oh, are you muted again?

2119
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Logie or did I just lose you for a second? That was weird.

2120
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
No, I, I'm sorry. There's people walking in out here.

2121
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
So it was okay. I understand you got a lot of busy stuff going on at home.

2122
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Okay, let's move on. And I'm going to talk a little bit about Duke Nukem 3d.

2123
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
That's right. We're still going with the Duke Nukem news.

2124
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I feel like every month coming out of here on the switch, we've had something.

2125
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

2126
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,000
That's it. That's it. Uh, the 20th anniversary world tour is coming out on switch.

2127
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Uh, I believe the 20th anniversary world tour already exists on like PlayStation,

2128
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Xbox platforms, but it's coming out on the switch as well.

2129
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
It's going to have eight new levels, uh, which is our,

2130
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
these are already in the prior versions,

2131
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
but if you weren't familiar with the 20th anniversary world tour,

2132
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
there's an all new episode five in the game. Uh,

2133
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,000
this is a company by new music from the composer, from the original game,

2134
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
new voice lines from John St. John. So, I mean, it's,

2135
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
it's just literally like more Duke Nukem 3d stuff. Uh,

2136
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
the switch port will have optional gyro aiming if you're into that HD rumble

2137
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,000
motion controls and local wireless multiplayer. So it's kind of cool because again,

2138
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
the switch is the closest thing we have to like land gaming on a console in a

2139
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
way. So it's kind of neat. Uh, and there's also going to be a remaster toggle.

2140
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
So you can play the game with the original visuals or the enhanced ones.

2141
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
That's pretty cool too. Like it sounds like what we saw, like in the wonderboy,

2142
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
uh, uh, dragon's trap and all that stuff. So that's pretty rad. Now, uh,

2143
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
the game will be available for nine 99, uh,

2144
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
but five bucks for a limited time. If you want to grab that a little bit early,

2145
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
that's pretty cool. Uh, now what box? Yeah.

2146
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
What's interesting about this, uh,

2147
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
there's a whole other lawsuit going on now,

2148
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
uh, because of the 20th anniversary world tour. Uh,

2149
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
apparently gearbox was supposed to have Duke Nukem free and clear of copyright

2150
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
infringement when it originally acquired the franchise from Apogee software

2151
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:55,000
in 2010. But apparently the original composer, uh,

2152
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
sued and there's still some unresolved liabilities from this whole thing. Um,

2153
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:03,000
so it's, it's still going on. Have you been following any of this at all? Loki?

2154
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
No, I haven't. Unfortunately. Um, you know, it's,

2155
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
it's, it's Duke Nukem. And unfortunately, you know,

2156
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
after Duke Nukem forever came out, it's like kinda, eh, I, I, I lost,

2157
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
lost interest in that franchise. I mean,

2158
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
unless we get like a brand new Duke Nukem game or something,

2159
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
that's completely, you know,

2160
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
it has that same punch as like Duke Nukem 3d did. Um,

2161
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I can't really be too excited about it, but now like, you know,

2162
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
so we're talking about gearbox and I just, you know, brandy pitch for it.

2163
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I can't, I can't anymore.

2164
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
That is the truth. I'm also at an, I can't situation with him as well.

2165
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
All right. Sorry. I was typing in a quick comment in our chat room.

2166
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Sometimes I multitask. Let's move on.

2167
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
We have just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up, uh,

2168
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
for further chat comments in our listener round table,

2169
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
as well as maybe some last minute stories if we have any. But first,

2170
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
we have a couple other scheduled things. Loki.

2171
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Yes. In a page of, I it's 2020.

2172
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
So of course this is going to happen. Uh,

2173
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Guinness has recently announced that as of June 10th,

2174
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:16,000
it has decided to reinstate Billy Mitchell's previously removed high scores

2175
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
and achievements for donkey calling and pac-man. Um,

2176
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,000
and they did this really produced video starring, um,

2177
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Billy Mitchell as well. Um,

2178
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:30,000
talking about how they had some eye witnesses and some additional analysis

2179
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:35,000
done don't really seem to mention what exactly that was that they did or

2180
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
who or what,

2181
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,000
but apparently they felt that that was merited that they should reinstate

2182
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
those high scores. And then it's, it's, uh, you know,

2183
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
a good half of it of Billy Mitchell just talking up himself and how he's the,

2184
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
he's the original e-sports, you know, contender and stuff. Um,

2185
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,000
good for him, I guess. I, this is just weird. I don't know.

2186
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
It doesn't really change anything with the twin galaxy stuff. So, yeah.

2187
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,000
And then Guinness is kind of as it is. So I,

2188
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
I know some people are really upset with this news,

2189
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,000
but at the same time this is news that can now power your anti Billy Mitchell

2190
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,000
YouTube channel for like the next three years because there are entire YouTube

2191
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
channels dedicated to this stuff. And

2192
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I'm like, I don't want to sound shady or mean like people are into whatever

2193
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
they're into and that's cool. But I'm also like, it's,

2194
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
it's a fucking video game and this is coming from the,

2195
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
this is coming from the guy who's been doing a podcast for 18 years. Okay.

2196
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Like I, like, I just don't like, I don't care either way.

2197
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Like I don't want, this is not like a, a thing I'm gonna pick sides on.

2198
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
It's just, it's like, I just don't care. Like, okay, cool.

2199
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
You know, maybe it was me, maybe it wasn't me. He plays,

2200
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
he plays a great game of donkey calling and Pac-Man. I'm not going to contend

2201
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
that, you know, con or contest that. Like, who cares?

2202
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I just don't care. I really don't. And

2203
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
it's fine. You know, good for him. I mean,

2204
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
hopefully he's a nice guy. He actually thinks about, he is a nice guy.

2205
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I've, I've met him completely,

2206
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
completely out of the context of any of this stuff,

2207
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
completely out of the context of any of this stuff I've, I've met. He's just,

2208
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
he's, he's a normal fucking person when there's no camera. So like,

2209
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,000
I don't know. Like, I really don't care. I'm glad that he's got some resolution here.

2210
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
So at the very least, he's got his Guinness world records. And honestly,

2211
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
if you're asking, you know, Joe Schmo on the street,

2212
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
they're going to know what Guinness is versus twin galaxies any day of the week.

2213
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
So that's probably,

2214
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
maybe that's a little bit more important to him than say twin galaxies,

2215
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
but good for him, I guess. I mean,

2216
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
he fought the hard fight and he's back in there.

2217
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
So I don't know. I'll let the drama be drama.

2218
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I don't need to deal with it. Very good point. Um,

2219
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Questbuster in chat says a comment on an article by Ars Technica covering this

2220
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
suggested that the threshold for persuasive proof was much higher on Guinness's

2221
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
side. So they needed more to remove his records than it was for twin galaxies.

2222
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
And yeah, I, I've been hearing that take on it as well. And, um,

2223
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
it makes sense. But at the same time, like, I'm just kind of like, I,

2224
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
there's so many other things going on in our industry.

2225
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Why are we still fighting about this Billy Mitchell thing? Like it's,

2226
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
it's exhausting everyone. I'm exhausted. I'm tired.

2227
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I need a nap. Anyhow. All right.

2228
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Let's move on to news. Now, this is a blast from the past that I welcome.

2229
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
This is, I think, I think I do.

2230
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Cause I have many fond memories when I see this title involved and that is that

2231
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
micro pros is back. Micro pros.

2232
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Now the reason why I remember micro pros is because that was the company logo on

2233
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
the loading screen of the all time. Great Sid Myers civilization.

2234
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Uh, I'm talking about the very first one on the PC years and years ago and pretty

2235
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
much all the Sid Meyer games, uh, covert action, railroad tycoon, all that stuff.

2236
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Those are all micro pros games back in the day. Uh,

2237
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
micro pros put out a lot of awesome games back in the day. Uh,

2238
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:28,000
and then in 2019 the micro pros brand was bought by, uh,

2239
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
a ex Bohemia interactive developer, David Ligeti, uh,

2240
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
and was revived in Australia.

2241
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Now the new micro pros has signed a publishing deal with Drakeling Labs,

2242
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
uh, for their games. Uh, there's two games that they're working on.

2243
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:48,000
One is called Operation Harsh Doorstop and the other is Warfare 1944.

2244
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Operation Harsh Doorstop is a competitive multiplayer game, um,

2245
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
that does not have any microtransactions paid DLC or loot box mechanic.

2246
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Well, that's worth celebrating. Uh,

2247
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
it is a game that's set in East Afghanistan and revolves around a fictional

2248
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
conflict between Soviet and NATO forces in the summer of 1991.

2249
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Warfare 1944 on the other hand is a World War II tactical shooter,

2250
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
as you can imagine by the name. Uh,

2251
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
and that is going to be going into steam early access on July 7th. So, uh,

2252
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
sadly it doesn't seem like micro pros is still in the business of Sid Meyer

2253
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
games, but that makes sense. I mean,

2254
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
like 2K has been putting out the Sid games for quite some time. Uh,

2255
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
and so yeah, they're not going to be putting out those types of games anymore,

2256
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
but they are working on a new strategy game, uh, Task Force Admiral, uh,

2257
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
another tactics game called Second Front. So, uh, who knows,

2258
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
perhaps the days of the tactical games, uh,

2259
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,000
and strategy games for micro pros are not quite in the past, but for now,

2260
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
we're going to see that name attached a little more towards, uh,

2261
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,000
first person shooters a little bit there. Uh, looking in chat, uh,

2262
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Quest Buster says, wow, micro pros,

2263
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,000
one of the war game gods back in the day along with SSI. Yeah. Uh,

2264
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I am Canadian says micro pros was fantastic and had super

2265
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
detailed manuals. Heck yeah. And, uh, um, the, uh,

2266
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
manuals oftentimes with the copy protection as well.

2267
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I remember that being a thing in covert action,

2268
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
which was a very underrated Sid Meyer game, just FYI.

2269
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
No, I've said that before, but I'm going to say it again. All right.

2270
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I think that is it for the news that we had scheduled tonight,

2271
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,000
but we are going to welcome your questions in our chat room over at twitch TV

2272
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
slash vog network.

2273
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
If you have any extra questions for us here before we wrap up tonight, um,

2274
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
while I'm waiting to see if we get any questions in chat or if there's

2275
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
something you want us to talk about, or you have an opinion,

2276
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
you want to get out there, shout that out in our chat room.

2277
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
We'll get that out here. I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

2278
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
If Loki wants to get into those.

2279
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I was just going to mention, let's see,

2280
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I was going to say that there is a Nintendo direct tomorrow for, uh,

2281
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
smash brothers. We're supposed to learn which arms characters smash brothers.

2282
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Yeah. It's specifically the arms one, right? Yes.

2283
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
So that's going to take place tomorrow. So look forward to that.

2284
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Uh, apparently there's a sequel for desert golfing,

2285
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,000
which is one of the early, uh, earliest mobile games.

2286
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:13,000
It's called golf on Mars. So that's coming to mobile. Huh?

2287
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Uh, pretty neat. And, uh, yeah, that's all I got.

2288
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
All right. That's all you got, huh?

2289
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Any thoughts on who the arms character might be that they end up adding?

2290
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I don't even know who any of the arms characters are. Like I don't know.

2291
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Twintania is the one I see a lot on Twitter. So, but I, uh,

2292
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
also Twintania, if I remember right, does not fight with arms.

2293
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,000
So that might not work out. So I don't know. Um, okay.

2294
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
So we've got some questions. Okay.

2295
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Actually I'm really glad this question came up.

2296
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Phoenix 77 26 says any thoughts on the last of us too,

2297
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
because we didn't get into that game tonight.

2298
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,000
And I know that was a huge release for this week. Um, and I,

2299
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I apologize because I talked about it with Bobby at the end of his show.

2300
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I kind of like in my mind, I was like, Oh, I've already talked about that. Um,

2301
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I didn't pick up the last of us too, and I'm very likely not going to.

2302
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,000
And here's the thing. It's nothing like I hear the game is great. Um,

2303
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
and the accessibility stuff sounds phenomenal and is worth acknowledging and

2304
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
recognizing that being said,

2305
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I think there's a level of violence in the game that I'm just,

2306
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I'm kind of exhausted on. I'm kind of over it and I'm not yet.

2307
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I know it's weird to hear me probably say like the game is just too violent,

2308
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
but that's, that's the real, real thing.

2309
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Like I'm just not into the gore violence and,

2310
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:34,000
and animal stuff and all that stuff. And I realize it's,

2311
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
it's kind of one of the points of the game and it's something about the

2312
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
narrative and so forth. But I also kind of recognize, like, I just,

2313
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
there are thousands of games, literally thousands of games out there.

2314
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
And that's just one narrative I'm just not interested in right now. Um,

2315
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
and I was talking about this on Bobby a little bit is that, you know,

2316
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
it's kind of like horror movies.

2317
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Like I think those saw movies are the dumbest,

2318
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:03,000
most heinous thing I can possibly think of. Uh, when it comes to movies,

2319
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I have no interest in those films, but I know other people love them. Uh,

2320
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
other people, I, I,

2321
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I volunteer a lot with the SAC horror film Fest here locally,

2322
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
which is the most ironic fucking thing,

2323
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,000
but horror and cult really intersect a lot. And I get that.

2324
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,000
But that being said, the gore side of stuff just really isn't for me.

2325
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I don't like it. I don't like those saw movies.

2326
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
And so it's kind of like that same sort of thing. I,

2327
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,000
but there is a big difference between what I'm saying and that saw

2328
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,000
movies shouldn't exist. The last of us two shouldn't exist.

2329
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I'm not saying that at all.

2330
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I think those of y'all that like that and enjoy that have fun.

2331
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Meanwhile, I've got a hundred hours still left on Xenoblade. I'm good.

2332
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I'm taken care of. What about you? Loki? What are,

2333
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
where are you at with the last of us too?

2334
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Is that something that's up your alley or what I never played the first one?

2335
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,000
So the second one doesn't really make a difference to me.

2336
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I've watched some reviews regarding it. Um, you know,

2337
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
aside from just the folks kind of, um,

2338
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:11,000
getting angry over the fact that there's a strong female protagonist or that

2339
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:16,000
there's, you know, um, LGBTQ,

2340
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
like elements to the game. Um,

2341
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:24,000
there's like writing issues that folks are having issues with and being

2342
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
fans of the original game. Um, I don't know.

2343
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
All that seems like drama to me. Like I, I just,

2344
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I never played the first one. So I, I hear it's a good game.

2345
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Um, I don't know what the second one got good reviews,

2346
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
um, in the press,

2347
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
but a lot of the user reviews are kind of negative,

2348
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
but that seems to be the case a lot of times.

2349
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I will wait usually and see what some of the trusted like YouTube reviewers that

2350
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I watch, you know,

2351
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,000
that share the same opinions with like me on games is to like see what they say.

2352
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
But even after I see that I probably still won't play because I didn't play the

2353
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
first one. And there's a lot of series that I don't play.

2354
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
I haven't played any of the charted games.

2355
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
I haven't played any of the last of us that I haven't played, uh,

2356
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
until dawn except for rush of blood.

2357
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:12,000
There's a lot of like big series games that have come out that I just haven't

2358
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
gotten into.

2359
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Yeah.

2360
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
There's a lot of those like user negative reviews stuff.

2361
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,000
I think a lot of that is motivated because people are like,

2362
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Ew,

2363
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:26,000
it's LGBT content and it's an agenda and it's being shoved in my face and blah,

2364
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
blah, like fuck off.

2365
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Like the heterosexuality of agenda has been shoved in my face for many,

2366
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,000
many years and I don't complain. So just, it's not, it's,

2367
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
it's so dumb. So I, and again, like I,

2368
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I think it's great that there are the LGBT et cetera themes in the game and so

2369
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
forth. And I think that's cool. And I can, I, you know,

2370
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
there's one hand and I can say, I love that that exists.

2371
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I think that's great that that's a thing. These accessibility options,

2372
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,000
that's fucking amazing. That being said, not for me.

2373
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Not for me. So I,

2374
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,000
I will have to try that all somewhere else because the hope is that those,

2375
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,000
those themes and the, the, the, um, the, the accessibility option,

2376
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,000
that stuff is, is, is well received by the masses.

2377
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Cause we all know the bullshit on, uh,

2378
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,000
user reviews and stuff is just angry basement dwellers. And there,

2379
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
it's not reflective of what people really think because most people that play

2380
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
these games aren't on video game websites. That's the reality of it. So, um,

2381
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
you know, it's, it w I imagine the stuff will be strong enough that we'll see,

2382
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
uh,

2383
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,000
more games that aren't necessarily about like zombies and violence and things

2384
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
like that. And I think that'll be cool. Um, dark Tetsuya says,

2385
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I'm inclined to agree on the violence. I mean,

2386
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
it was one thing when it was Mortal Kombat two or Grand Theft Auto,

2387
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
but there's more recent stuff is definitely on another level.

2388
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
It's almost just too much at times. Uh, bonds, double six says, LOL.

2389
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Each final destination film game, everyone a reason to be Leary, the TV,

2390
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
the fridge, the stove piece. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2391
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I saw that first final destination film and it was wow. Uh,

2392
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,000
and then all I heard about the second one is that it will never make you want

2393
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
to drive on the freeway ever again. And that was enough for me. And, but,

2394
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
but see, here's the thing. I married a guy who loves those things.

2395
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
He watches death scene compilations on YouTube and that stuff.

2396
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
And he loves that stuff. That's fine.

2397
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
And I love that he watches it on YouTube because it's on his phone where I

2398
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,000
don't have to look at it. So that's fine. Um,

2399
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:30,000
and I understand those movies are for a certain crowd and that's cool.

2400
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:35,000
It's just not me. Have fun. All right.

2401
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Yeah. I am Canadian and chat says all that matters is if the story moves you,

2402
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
then it's worth trying. But if you find it too emotionally draining,

2403
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,000
then maybe not since it brings you down too much. Yeah. So I don't know.

2404
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Like I don't want to speak negatively of the last of us too. Uh,

2405
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,000
it's just, I can look at it and go, not for me. Uh, let's see.

2406
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
There were a couple other questions.

2407
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
So that was a great conversation in chat though. Um,

2408
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
I am Canadian asked,

2409
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:06,000
has anyone played Sid Meyer pirates or micro pros game called airborne ranger?

2410
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I did play Sid Meyer's pirates. I think they reinvented that game.

2411
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I think they had to drop his name because he wasn't involved,

2412
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,000
but I think they redid it as a game called pirates about 10 years ago,

2413
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
maybe longer. My memories. So I want to say it was a game.

2414
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I saw it like one of the first E threes I went to.

2415
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,000
That would have been about 15 years ago. Uh,

2416
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,000
and I did play a little bit of that. Uh, and I did play,

2417
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I do remember playing the original a little bit,

2418
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
but not as much as I played railroad tycoon and especially civilization,

2419
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:39,000
but I loved railroad tycoon. That game was great. So, uh,

2420
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Phoenix 77 26 says pirates was one of my faves when I was a lot younger.

2421
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Yeah. So there's that. Do you, have you,

2422
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
do you remember any of these, uh,

2423
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:52,000
strategical classic games for micro pros Loki or no, not, not ringing about.

2424
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I never really played that stuff. I mean, um,

2425
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I don't know. Like the,

2426
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:02,000
the most I would get into any sort of strategy would be just like the classic

2427
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
SIM city. I,

2428
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I really never got into a lot of the S the strategy or management Sims and

2429
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,000
stuff like that. I'm aware of them and just never played them.

2430
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Phoenix 77 26 and chat says, Rob,

2431
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
did you ever show your dad railroad tycoon and what did he think? Yeah.

2432
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I don't know if you're remembering that my dad actually worked on the railroad

2433
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,000
for many years. He retired from that industry. So I don't know. Um, he,

2434
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I remember him saying, yes, I do remember showing it to him.

2435
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I remember showing him an old ass Commodore 64 game.

2436
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I want to say the original a train was on the Commodore 64 and I remember

2437
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,000
showing that to him. Uh, and it was one of those things where he goes, huh,

2438
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
that's neat. Or like, Oh, that's pretty cool. And then it was like, okay,

2439
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,000
turn around and leave. But my dad, my dad never really got into game.

2440
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
My dad was never a gamer at all. And it's, it's,

2441
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I don't even think today my dad really plays games that just for whatever

2442
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:58,000
reason, isn't it ironic that here I am. But, um,

2443
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:03,000
he was, I will say what my dad was into that will make you giggle.

2444
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
He might not have been in a games.

2445
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,000
He was always really into like radio and, uh,

2446
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
ham radio, trucker radio, shortwave.

2447
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,000
He had one of those like radio things that was like am F way FM

2448
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
shortwave with a blue, a green, a yellow, and like all these things.

2449
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I don't even know.

2450
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:26,000
And like I remember he could tune into a radio station that was in like fucking

2451
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Russia or something like on the other side of the globe and was able to hear

2452
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
stuff on it. And that was the type of stuff he thought was interesting.

2453
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,000
So, um, I also think he used to listen to a lot of Art Bell.

2454
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
I don't think he really talked about it,

2455
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
but I think he did just based on like what stations the radios are often tuned

2456
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
to. So I think he might be into that type of like, I don't know.

2457
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
He's probably, probably knows where all the aliens are at.

2458
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Um, but I've never really bothered to ask.

2459
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Uh, Phoenix 77 26 says, I guess he has a big antenna bolted to the house.

2460
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Um, not that I can think of. I am Canadian says shortwave,

2461
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,000
ham and CB radio is big up here. And that makes a lot of sense because, uh,

2462
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,000
assuming your name is not a lie and you are in fact Canadian and perhaps you are

2463
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,000
a Canadian who lives out a little, you know,

2464
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:15,000
further north where stuff is so spread out and there's just so,

2465
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:20,000
but like that's the type of radio that gets from city to city or that covers

2466
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
such a large, large area. Uh,

2467
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:26,000
sometimes we forget just how big Canada is.

2468
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I know that seems like such a silly thing to say, but it's so true.

2469
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Like, like Canada's pretty fucking huge. Uh, and so, you know,

2470
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
it makes sense that a lot of that shortwave and stuff is how you get,

2471
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,000
and a lot of that applies in Alaska as well. A lot of that same type of logic.

2472
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,000
So my dad was always kind of into that stuff. Yeah. Um,

2473
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,000
uh, ask him if he ever talked to a particular call sign on his ham.

2474
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I don't think he had a license to operate it.

2475
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,000
So I don't think he ever talked to people, but I think he listened.

2476
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I don't know. So here's the thing. His other big thing is genealogy.

2477
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:15,000
My dad is like huge into genealogy and I probably shouldn't give away too much,

2478
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:19,000
but he like is part of like genealogy groups.

2479
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
So his big, this is what always interested to him.

2480
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:27,000
He loved ways he could scan pictures into the computer, uh,

2481
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
scan documents, add records,

2482
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:34,000
family tree maker and those types of programs when they would get new updates

2483
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
and those types of things,

2484
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,000
how to search for things online at the library and using things like Lexis

2485
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Nexus. That's the type of stuff that would make him perk up.

2486
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,000
He's super into genealogy and that type of stuff.

2487
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:51,000
So, um, those are, those are the things that I would associate more than, uh,

2488
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
uh, gaming. So, uh, Phoenix 7726 says,

2489
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Rob is secretly related to some Dutch nobles or something. Well, I'm actually,

2490
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,000
my heritage is a large part Dutch. So it's,

2491
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,000
it's Dutch and it's Scottish, which you could probably see in the beard a little

2492
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
bit. So there you go. Uh, Phoenix says, so he's a huge data nerd then. Cool.

2493
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Yeah. I think that's a good way to put it. He's,

2494
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:17,000
he's definitely a bit of a data nerd. So, all right.

2495
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Anyway, I don't mind talking about my dad though. It's father's day.

2496
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Was your dad a gamer, Logie? Um, he's would say no.

2497
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
But then again, he's the one that had all the,

2498
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:31,000
the Coleco vision in like 60 games.

2499
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
So I don't know if it's just because they got that cheap during the video game

2500
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
crash or what, but they were all his games. So I don't know.

2501
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Yeah. Technically the Commodore 64 was my dad's machine,

2502
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
but I guarantee you I use that machine at the age of like five or six.

2503
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:48,000
There's a picture of me out there somewhere and I've got to find it and I'll,

2504
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,000
I'll show it on the show sometime. I'm like five years old and I'm, I'm,

2505
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I'm five years old and I'm sitting in front of the 64 and I'm typing at it and

2506
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
I'm looking at a magazine typing in the thing I see in the magazine.

2507
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:05,000
So that's like an early picture of me that exists out there somewhere.

2508
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
So yeah, I always use that thing way more than he,

2509
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
and then he wouldn't need me to show him how to use like the word processor or

2510
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:16,000
something like that. So I tried typing out stuff that was in a book as well one

2511
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
time. So like I had the, um,

2512
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,000
I had the TI 85 and then, um, I had like the,

2513
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
the tape deck that came with it. And because I was, you know,

2514
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
a kid and my parents weren't necessarily familiar with how like technology

2515
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
works, you know,

2516
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
all I was familiar with the tape deck was like I listen to music on this,

2517
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
like, but somehow this hooks up to the computer.

2518
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:43,000
And then so we ended up doing accidentally is hitting the record button and

2519
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,000
erasing part of the tape. But the tape was of course storage for the programs,

2520
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,000
you're supposed to hit play. Then the computer receives, you know, the,

2521
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,000
the analog signal and it converts it into actual coding language.

2522
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:58,000
But I didn't know how any of that worked because like it's a tape deck,

2523
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,000
like it's music. So I had the book that came with it though,

2524
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
with all the coding.

2525
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
And one of the things I was really interested in was the mini golf game that

2526
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
was in there. It was a basic. And then,

2527
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:12,000
so I didn't really bother typing it into a TI basic for

2528
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
a while, but I still have that book. And then later on,

2529
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
when we got a brand new, you know,

2530
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:23,000
what was that a three 86 20 computer,

2531
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I had Q basic in DOS. And so I was like, well, this is about this.

2532
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
It's basic. It's the same. So I typed it all in.

2533
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,000
It didn't work because no, not all basic is the same,

2534
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
even though it has the word basic and it is not the same programming language.

2535
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
So, so yeah,

2536
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:44,000
uh, I wish I had more of those magazines around that time.

2537
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
And I wish I understood how that stuff worked because I really wanted to play

2538
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,000
that, that, uh, mini golf game.

2539
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
One of these days, one of these days. All right.

2540
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Those are, those are some good questions and a fun trip down memory lane.

2541
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Thanks you guys in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

2542
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:02,000
But if Loki is out of last minute stories, I am too.

2543
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
And I think that means it's time. One last one, one last one, please.

2544
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Another, another, uh, lead to what we may be getting in game announcements,

2545
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
but apparently this last week,

2546
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:17,000
the URL suicide squad game.com has been registered.

2547
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So I guess we should expect a suicide squad game to be announced at some

2548
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:26,000
point. So we'll have to wait and see pretty interesting.

2549
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,000
They tend to be surprised when they announce it. All right.

2550
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Coming soon, maybe. All right.

2551
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,000
All right. Uh, Phoenix 77 26 says, did that Avengers game get axed? No,

2552
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
it didn't. They just, they, they did push it back. Yeah.

2553
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
They delayed it back. And I think again,

2554
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,000
COVID and all that stuff came into play with that as well. So, all right.

2555
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
All right. Well,

2556
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,000
that is going to wrap it up for another night here at orange launch radio and

2557
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
another week on the podcast feed.

2558
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or watching us live.

2559
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
However you participated with the show. We appreciate you guys.

2560
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio,

2561
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,000
help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show. Uh,

2562
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,000
we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here,

2563
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,000
we can't, we can't air all the different thoughts. So, uh,

2564
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is,

2565
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:14,000
you found this show, those going off a long way, uh, hosting on Twitch.

2566
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Even if you don't do a lot of streaming yourself,

2567
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
host is huge for discoverability.

2568
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
So we super appreciate those of you that host fog network. Unfortunately,

2569
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Twitch took away my ability to see who hosts us at this very moment.

2570
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
So I can't shout you all out individually, but please know,

2571
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
I do know people do do it cause I see in the stats that, Oh,

2572
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
so-and-so found your channel through this. So I,

2573
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I definitely appreciate you guys that do participate. Thank you. Thank you.

2574
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Thank you. Uh, with all that and that helped us spread the word. Um,

2575
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:45,000
with that, it's about time to get everybody's final thoughts. Um,

2576
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
I don't know what else to say. So Loki,

2577
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
we'll get your final thought and then we'll wrap up.

2578
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Uh, my final thought is I probably should work on my game.

2579
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Um, but I'll probably end up playing Minecraft instead.

2580
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
But I really should work on my game. Um,

2581
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:05,000
my final thought is, um, happy pride. Uh, this upcoming weekend,

2582
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,000
I really should have been going to some pride festival somewhere or

2583
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
something. Actually this coming weekend,

2584
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I think was when I had planned to go to Toronto for pride,

2585
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
but COVID kind of put a stop to all that.

2586
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
So that unfortunately didn't happen this year.

2587
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I've never been to Toronto. I would love to do that.

2588
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
So I hope everybody has a happy pride, however, you're celebrating. Um,

2589
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
and I know a lot of people are celebrating,

2590
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
probably participating in a lot of the protests that are going on.

2591
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
And I think that's great. Uh, obviously black lives matter.

2592
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
We got to keep reminding people of that.

2593
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Even when the media is kind of moved on to some other topics, uh,

2594
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
this is not something that needs to just go away.

2595
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
We're going to continue to have these conversations. Um, however, again,

2596
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
COVID is also still out there.

2597
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:46,000
So do make sure you're wearing your mask and practicing social distancing,

2598
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
but everything I've seen from those protests,

2599
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
they're very well organized with that type of stuff.

2600
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:54,000
So kudos and a plus and all that stuff, um, with that. So anyway, uh,

2601
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
that's my thought on that. Uh,

2602
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
thank you guys very much for participating with the show.

2603
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
You guys are awesome. We'll be back here in seven days to do it all again.

2604
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Next week is the 18th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.

2605
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
We're going to have some new things.

2606
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
You've seen some things for the very last time tonight.

2607
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
So, uh, we're going to,

2608
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
we're going to freshen up some things under the hood next week,

2609
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
and we'll see you next week to do that. That's it.

2610
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Have a good night, everybody. We'll see you next time.

2611
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:23,000
