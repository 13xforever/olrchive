This week Sega announces a system to leverage arcades for regional multiplayer and I'm excited for it. More opportunities to have a larger player base of still local competition sounds great to me. This is just one story about playing together apart. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 822 for this June the 7th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined virtually in this pandemic era by my awesome co-hosts via Discord. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello. Remember, not every, not just every gamer has a voice but especially our black gamers. Especially that and we'll talk about that here right at the top of the show in just a moment. I also want to say hello as well of course to Techmaster Loki.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello. Hi and Techmaster Loki is using what you got like a green screen thing going on, huh, we were up in the effects tonight at OLR.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's because my wife didn't want the camera on like last time so this way it hides the background so you can't see anything. I don't actually have a green screen. It's just software.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, well it works pretty good. It looks really good. So I like this. We have the different collections going on. We have Loki's green screen, we have DarkSakura's Kirby and doll collection going on back there. And then of course, good old Studio N7 like you're used to seeing here behind me.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, let's get to it. It's, it's been, it's been a week. So they say we didn't do a show last week, and we didn't do a show last week because it just would have felt tone deaf, I think, with everything else that's going on in the world to, you know, I know this show oftentimes is an escape from what's going on in the real world.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We've had a lot of tragedy. This year we've all been impacted by COVID-19 and everything that that's done to us personally. And so I know that in a lot of those times this show is really an escape from a lot of those things.

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But last week, in particular, I think it felt that an escape would have been wrong. That would have been the wrong thing, because we all needed to stop and listen, and we need to continue to do so just because we're back tonight doesn't mean hey stop listening.

11
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But last week especially felt like it would not have been appropriate for us to be here and talk on top of the conversation about a bunch of things that we're going to get canceled or delayed anyway because the world right now is having a more important conversation.

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A big part of the inspiration for coming back tonight, there's this content creator that I follow that I met at Dragon Con. His name's Roberto Blake. He does a lot of YouTube type creation and a lot of how to promote yourself and how to be seen on YouTube. It's a lot of great stuff. I highly recommend his channel.

13
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But there was a video in particular that really like got me and it was like, you know, what do you what do you do as a content creator during these times. And there are some people a lot of people that kind of need the mental health break that a show like this can provide, or the sense of community I think more importantly, that a show like this can provide.

14
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So the message I kind of took away from his video was continue to produce, but you don't need to promote right now. And so you'll notice I didn't really promote a lot tonight my co host didn't either. We have the bots that kind of do their automated thing and you know we let them continue to do the automated thing but otherwise we haven't really been promoting because there's other things that need to be promoted right now.

15
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And that is obviously the voices of our black family as they and I do say family because this show was rooted Orange Lawn's radio started of course as myself, Dark Sakura, Loki, the folks you see here all sitting around the dinner table after playing DDR with our friends and sitting around talking a little bit smack about video games and I hope over the 18 years that we've done this show I really hope that you found that we especially welcome those voices.

16
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
from the marginalized communities, including you know LGBTQIA plus since this is Pride Month after all, and our black friends and family.

17
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Obviously none of us are black, that are the three that are kind of the names behind the show.

18
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm very lucky, fortunate, thankful that so many of you do come to the chat room, come to the Skype calls that we used to do the discord calls we were doing before COVID-19 happened, and are here with us and are a part of our family.

19
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I do consider you all part of the family.

20
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And that's why I stand with you guys and everybody who is sick of this shit going on in the world.

21
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And enough is enough and shit is going to change.

22
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And thankfully, thanks to the protest, thanks to things that are happening, we're starting to see, we're starting to see little baby steps, little baby steps of change.

23
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But these are baby steps that wouldn't have happened if we didn't raise our voices loud and and so on.

24
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Jamie, I don't know if you have continued thoughts on this but you are always able to express very eloquently these, these difficult political, I guess, struggles in your positions.

25
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Y'all heard that I'm eloquent. Well, for me, it's been very much being caught in between two worlds because I'm from Alabama. I have a lot of families still there I followed some, some people who I thought had matured after high school, and one of them, namely one of my exes.

26
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Just turned out to be a real racist piece of shit so I was like, you can take your opinion and shove it up your urethra.

27
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And we all know where that is on the dudes. So, yeah, I blocked him I blocked a few other people. My mother and I got into a really big fight, and, you know, and finally just had to call truce that we were just weren't going to discuss some of these things.

28
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So, what I've been super proud of is that once. And I'm going to say it like this for a reason. Once people got the selfish looting out of their system.

29
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And they have set have you proven that they are not among the protesters that we have seen what peaceful protesting can accomplish, we've seen ugliness come out and have people turn it around to be something very beautiful.

30
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I'm talking about that stupid, you know, child protection wall at the White House.

31
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I mean, you've seen what people have done they put signs on it, you know, look, do you see the crowd on the Golden Gate Bridge, or the Manhattan Bridge, or, you know, people who have just come out in force and people have tried, like, not just police have tried to do this,

32
00:07:42,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but everyday people we had a guy run a tanker truck through a crowd of protesters. We've had cops run over people. And right now, we are looking at a gigantic toddler temper tantrum with people who have access to more things to throw.

33
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We're looking at the, the death throes of the world as it was, we are watching it die and we are a part of history.

34
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And that being said, I am proud of every one of our listeners that I have seen on Twitter on Facebook on any of the social media is the people that I have today.

35
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And I'm really proud of people for even if you can't go out, or even you know if just trying to think of another way to phrase this, even if say you are like me I'm I'm immunocompromised since I had, you know, pneumonia and I have an autoimmune disorder.

36
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have friends who are HIV positive and living with AIDS, who some of them have risked illness to go participate in the protests.

37
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There's a lot of misinformation going about people you know coming down with COVID at the protests. And I think logically we are going to see another increase in a couple of weeks, but the numbers that you're seeing right now are from this idiot protesters with their guns

38
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:24,000
wanting their haircuts and massages. And, you know, and not wearing masks I've seen a bunch of protesters out there wearing their PPE and social distancing.

39
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But we also get it from you know the dumb asses who went to the beach the moment that they opened and places that were completely unintelligent we're starting to see a rise here in California now with the restaurants reopening in a lot of places, we're starting

40
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:50,000
to see a rise in in cases again. Like I told y'all that who listens to me or history, I'm just saying. But we, and speaking of the history, we saw this happen.

41
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You know what people when they bring up Dr. King, you know, they bring up, oh, he would have been against this it was a peaceful protest they show that picture of him walking.

42
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What they don't show is the five minutes later, with him being attacked by people with the cops attacking with it turning into a full riot. And don't forget, he was assassinated.

43
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So, every last one of you taking a stand, who is out there protesting who's coordinating protests, every last one of you who is doing something that isn't just performative, you know, online art.

44
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I commend you. I am very proud of our listeners. I am very proud of a lot of folks in this industry, and keep it up keep the pressure up we cannot back down.

45
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, it was great. The one thing, the one thing I do want to say with because because you talked about coven and restaurants and I've you and I've talked about this I went to a restaurant.

46
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:05,000
a week ago, and it's not the same as it was before. I think the key word is precautions and and my viewpoint of probably why the cases are going up in this whole situation is that you have people out there that do not want to follow precautions right and

47
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
we've all heard about the Karen's right and the chads that don't want to wear a mask and feel that it's oppression and all that stuff and if you're not willing.

48
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If you're not willing to follow the precautions. That's, I think the truly dangerous thing, and why you know because it goes back to all those people that were crowding the beach and all that stuff.

49
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Luckily, and to bring it back to the real important topic. Luckily with the protests and things we are seeing a lot of, you know, the masks the social distancing, the fact that it is outdoors and you know it's a lot harder to transmit outdoors and it isn't

50
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
in an enclosed space.

51
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So I think, you know, I'm hoping I'm praying that we don't see a spike because of the protest, I, the only times I wince is usually because there's a conflict that the cops started that caused the crowd to now move and and you know because they're being tear

52
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
gassed or something's going on. And now, social distancing rules are being broken. Did you see that they were pulling the masks off of protesters that's terrible and attacking medics and reporters.

53
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The one that really, like really got under my skin and there's a lot, I mean but the one where I was like, what is the fucking point is the one where the cops are just driving down the highway, spraying pepper spray on people they're protesting at the side of the road.

54
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Like what the fuck point is that.

55
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That is, that is waving your dick, and it's, it's ridiculous.

56
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And there was the one older gentleman who went out extending his hand in peace.

57
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And they knocked him down.

58
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And like, like hype mayhem just said, shoving a 75 year old man to the ground injuring him and then lying about it. When there's fucking video, and yes, they were finally arrested as well they should be.

59
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And thank you for acknowledging our chat room because of course we do you know tape live and we want to hear your comments as we do tape live Sunday nights at twitch.tv slash vogue network.

60
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to come because I think this is very important point to bring up Marissa, our dear friend and pal and voiceover lady, Marissa says in chat not allowing racism and prejudice people to hide in your life anymore is a protest.

61
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And I think when it, when it comes back to the question of what can I do, what can we do, you know, well, one thing we can do because one thing that I am hearing from my friends who are black are like, we're tired of having to educate people.

62
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We're tired of being the ones that people want to go to. Well how do I do this better there's resources out there use them right. So I feel like that's one thing we can do is that we can educate our friends who don't get it.

63
00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Better educate ourselves. Well yeah of course we got to educate ourselves before we can educate other people but I also feel like that's a place that we have to, we have to work on that is educating other white people.

64
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is what it is.

65
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I also do have to know when to cut them out.

66
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes, but I think it's a delicate line dark soccer and I don't, I don't know if you and I see completely I here I think we do I think there's a middle ground.

67
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I do think there are a lot of people out there that are capable of changing.

68
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I know that because I've changed.

69
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I had a shitty stance on trans rights at one point. Now it wasn't as shitty as JK Rowling it'll never be that shitty.

70
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But I had an opinion remember when that whole RuPaul's Drag Race and the, you've got male, that whole thing happened.

71
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, I was on the wrong side of that argument.

72
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:55,000
In the beginning, I remember that, but I educated myself and I was wrong. And I'm sorry, you know, but I learned, and I learned about where I'm starting to understand now better where the other side is coming from.

73
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm understanding why trans people hate that word and so forth, you know, and so forth and I educated myself and now I know to do better and I can teach other people that.

74
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Or why some of us are sick of them using the word fish.

75
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, and there's always going to be consistently things that we have to change within ourselves and learn from our mistakes.

76
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So I do think there are a lot of people out there, you know, I really don't like the whole cancel culture thing.

77
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know, there's some element of it I get, but there's another element of it where it's like if there's a tweet from 10 years ago.

78
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You need to ask yourself, has that person changed has that person learned from that has that person done better.

79
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Here's another example though. Sure, there is a, and I use this very loosely gentleman who has a battery business, and I, some people might have seen me on social media posting about it, who has doubled down on his vicious racism and calling for people to be

80
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:12,000
shot, who has a criminal record has had several restraining orders against him by the community, and has been doing this for 10 years and you're not going to get people like that to change.

81
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The only thing that you can do is make them suffer for it.

82
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And I asked you, have you ever heard of a Sikh person that's nasty. Have you ever in your life. Never like practice peace and they came out during the fires and you took people into their own homes and into their temples to take care of them.

83
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, I mean like what with that one, you know business and like a person should not provide a business that believes that because he could harm his customers he could harm the community.

84
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And so we have to hold them accountable.

85
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But I think if you're one of those people out there that you know when you hear the phrase black lives matter your instinct is to go well all lives should matter, because you know you you you we all heard it right you've all heard that response before.

86
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I want to truly believe that there is a good clump of those people that can realize that what they're saying is hurtful, that when you say all lives matter in response to somebody saying black lives matter.

87
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're essentially saying to somebody who is crying out in pain.

88
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I am sick of seeing people like me murdered on the nightly news by the police. You are saying that when you when you respond to somebody saying black lives matter say well all lives matter, you're saying that that person in pain.

89
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Shut the fuck up.

90
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Why would you say other people have it bad too. Why would you say that to somebody in pain.

91
00:17:47,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Well I even counted one of my mother's arguments last night, because she she like I said she was digging in. I actually use something out of the Bible that she believes in to illustrate why black lives matter.

92
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And it was Jesus talking about, you know, if, if he has a flock, and one of his flock is missing he will leave the rest of the flock to find the missing sheep because that is the one that's in danger.

93
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The other flock is safe at home.

94
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And that right there if my mom is rebuking the Bible that she claims to believe in and the teachings of whatever, you know, deity creature that she claims to believe in.

95
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We have so many other people doing that and they don't understand that they are violating their own faith.

96
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's a very simple hypocrisy.

97
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Absolutely, I'm with you.

98
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And there's a very simple word. You can add to black lives matter, if you're one of these all Matt all lives matter people. There's a very simple word you can add to black lives matter to help it make sense, potentially, and that word is to black lives

99
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
matter to.

100
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That is what it is, because all lives can't matter until black lives matter.

101
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay, you're gonna put out the house that's on fire. On that note, black lives can't matter until black queer lives matter, black trans lives matter.

102
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And so, you know, it is Pride Month after all and you obviously that is, you know, a particular family that's very near and dear to my heart because you know I'm part of the LGBTQIA family.

103
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Your activism has to be intersectional. Yes, absolutely. You can't say, you know, you can't you can't say all lives matter, and then continue to watch as black people get hurt.

104
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's what we talked about activism can't be, it's just point this out to other Jewish people who are white passing Jews, and the reason why it's phrased that way is because they can hide that they're Jewish.

105
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
They're still a relative, a victim of their own special type of hatred, and it's a racial hatred.

106
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But the thing is that, you know, I flat out told them, what would you have said during World War Two.

107
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What would you have said if you were being harvested and taken off to a concentration camp, or in the ghettos being beaten or being brought out in the street and shot simply because you were Jewish, and there are black Jews, Ethiopian Jews, we come in all shapes

108
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and sizes but we were all Jewish.

109
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And the whole, the whole thing is that people are only looking through it, one lens, if you put it in a lens that they'll understand, then hopefully they'll, they'll get it but some people just dig in, they just dig in and they don't want to change because they

110
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
think they're right and what's important to them is being right, not being compassionate.

111
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I want to address. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry.

112
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They listen to the, the turd in chief.

113
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I wanted to address a comment in chat earlier, you mirror muse and chat says I'm saving up to donate and researching where, and there's a lot of great choices out there worthy of your consideration and you'll notice we've updated the ticker bar along the

114
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
bottom tonight to not just showcase video gaming news, but spotlight some of these websites and resources that you can you know check out if you if you are so inclined.

115
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
My advice because this is what I did.

116
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I saw that lots and lots of people were donating to that Minnesota bail fund which is great that's a great worthy use of money. I was also hearing though that they almost had so much money that they were distributed to other places.

117
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So, I wanted to keep my money, local was with some of the things like in some local efforts, um, again, but again, you need to do what you need to do with your money that you, you know, do a little research and so forth and I'm not going to tell you

118
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
oh I did it better you're just.

119
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This is a suggestion, starting your home community, because, because guess what, if you research some of these different charities, you're going to educate yourself along the way which is that's that's the silver lining about this whole thing.

120
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The first place I donated because I just thought, you know, you know, you know what speaks to my heart. Do you know what speaks to me personally you know a language that I love to speak with somebody about is independent media and homegrown media and getting

121
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
your voice out there and getting heard. So this might be a little local but Jamie I know you know these folks the folks over at Black Zebra productions.

122
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I get. Yeah, I get.

123
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Because they're out there tirelessly covering what's going on here in Sacramento, in the way that no other news network or news organization is willing to do like they are in the trenches, showing it to everybody on Facebook and holding.

124
00:22:44,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's great they're they're a great organization. I had a, I had a friend online, who was who happens to be in Minneapolis, who was organizing an effort to get some hot food together to give to black communities in need during all of these issues going on.

125
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And you know this is somebody that is, I can't consider like a great friend but like an online acquaintance we survivor LARP together that's that's how we know each other, but I was like, I want to help you specifically because what you're doing is

126
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:25,000
so I gave money there too. So, those are the kinds of thing that it's that's not all but those are just some things I wanted to name because there's a lot out there if you kind of look around, there's a lot of great causes that I think you're, you're

127
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:35,000
going to find that that speak to you, and maybe you're going to find something like I did where I was like, Oh, this, this speaks to me, and I want to help this for sure.

128
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't know if you have any follow up advice on that Jamie on how to like research organizations that are worthy of your time and or money.

129
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I know that if you're also looking for ones that are associated with like LGBT facilities that are associated with black charities. You can also check out your local LGBT center.

130
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And that is.

131
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh, by Felicia.

132
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'll address that.

133
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay.

134
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Anyway, you can look to your local LGBT communities, and your community centers, and you can take the, you know, ask them, hey do you work with any black charities Do you have any resources for black trans people are black queer people, you know, offer, offer

135
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:44,000
to work with them in relation to certain things like for example, I don't know of an LGBT center that doesn't have some sort of communication with like a separate trans center, or a separate black charity, we have here in Sacramento, a wonderful woman,

136
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Ebony, who works with. I don't know she still works with the gender health center, but she's very active and of course both the trans community, and in Black Lives Matter, and absolutely, absolutely just a delightful person, and I'm even going to see if I can

137
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
get more resources from her in particular, they'll be happy to share on my Twitter with everybody.

138
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I want to address this comment in chat and y'all know what what I'm going to hear swung tongue and chat says, Okay, I'm done with this podcast right now. I'm sick of all the virtual signaling, and yes, I'm also not white so please don't assume.

139
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm sorry to hear that, but I ain't apologizing for shit.

140
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And I that history is going to show that you are on the wrong side of this.

141
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I've said earlier in the show, if you will open your ears and open your heart and open your mind, you can change your mind.

142
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But if you're willfully going to put up a wall and shut it off.

143
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Bye bitch.

144
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And don't confuse heartfelt words and real anger for fucking virtue signaling. That's bullshit.

145
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We have done this show for a much smaller crowd. We have done this show for a much larger crowd.

146
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm not here to please anybody. I'm here to be me. She's here to be her. He's here to be quiet. No, I'm just kidding. He's here to be him too. Okay, but I'm not going to apologize for this passion.

147
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You're so lucky that you're in a position where you can turn this off, where you can walk away.

148
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So if you want to use your position of privilege, whatever it may be, to walk away, bye.

149
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But you know what? You're not going to escape this forever because history's a changin'.

150
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That's all I got. History is changing. And you're either on the right side or you're on the wrong side and doing nothing puts you on the wrong side.

151
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You think it's just us, bro?

152
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Actually, I want to thank for the perfect segue. Because if you're going to walk away from this, you're going to be walking away from a lot this week.

153
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Let's talk about some of the ways that the industry has been responding. What a great segue. Dark Sakura?

154
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Let's do it. I've got a good number of examples. There are a good number of companies who have come right out and made a statement and have even canceled some major unveilings because of what's going on in the country.

155
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Like, for example, EA, I know we like to take a big, big internet dump on EA from time to time, but their quote is that we stand with our African American black community of friends, players, colleagues and partners.

156
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Our immediate attention is on actions we can take to drive change against the unjust treatment and systematic bias that is plaguing the nation and our world.

157
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It said it would find another time to talk football with you. So it postponed their meeting, the EA Play Live event on June 18th and to June 18th.

158
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
They planned on doing it June 11th. Moving forward, Naughty Dog. They have pushed back the release of Last of Us Part 2.

159
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And they published the tweet with Black Lives Matter. They said many of us at Naughty Dog are donating to national and local organizations. Please consider donating yourself.

160
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Riot Games also came out speaking about it, saying hearts are heavy as hope seems lost and trust has been broken, but they stand in solidarity with the black community against all acts of injustice, racist, prejudice and hatred.

161
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Marvel came out and said we stand against racism. We stand for inclusion. We stand with our fellow black employees, storytellers, creators and the entire black community. We must unite and speak out.

162
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Granted, they said the same thing for all Disney properties, but the same.

163
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And even, you know, we've got other major companies. Tim Cook came out and said a nice big long letter about what's going on in the world.

164
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And I mean, he's from my hometown. I'm super proud. Just proof that Southerners can, you know, can escape the stereotype of their location.

165
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Now, right now, itch.io has a bundle of 742 games that they're selling for five bucks.

166
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:42,000
A lot of these, I don't know if it's all of them or most of them, but these are games that are either from black owned companies have a story that involves equality and justice.

167
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And it is pay what you want. Your minimum is $5 and all proceeds go to NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Community Bill Fund split 50-50.

168
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I think there's some black creators in that there's over there's over 700 games in that. So I think it's just everybody who wants to help in just a few.

169
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
First of all, babysitter, bloodbath, just saying the night fishermen, oxen free desktop goose.

170
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He just is a goose that hangs out on your desk. There's Tricha, which we think covered a little while, Daddy, a little far back.

171
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm sorry, I was looking at Plant Daddy when I said that.

172
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Just looking at a few other I saw one that had a big ado crimes. It's called Kissing Comrades. It's a 200 word LARP of anti-fascist making out.

173
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And by the way, it is Gay Pride Month amongst all this, but I think in this particular year, like you're really looking at gay wrath month happening.

174
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The little outburst you heard from me earlier, it's not going to end there.

175
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We are all tired. Every single like a COVID-19 was enough. We are all tired.

176
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I want to play this one. It's called Three Lesbians in a Barrow.

177
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I was going to say that we may remember a while back we had Sega on the show to talk about a game called Dominique Pamplemousse.

178
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I remember that. Oh, cool. Good call out. Thanks.

179
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
There's a game called Order of Pizza and Super Hexagon.

180
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I think the other extension for Dominique Pamplemousse.

181
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So there's there's quite the destined and there's that's also on there.

182
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So I'm it's a it's a really, really good bundle. And I actually I mean, I'm kind of on the broke side right now, but I donated 10 bucks.

183
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
At least I was going to double the minimum, but it's absolutely worth it.

184
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I can do this for folks in the chat is I am just going to paste it in the chat.

185
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But I just it's called the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality.

186
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Just look it up. It's worth your time, worth your money.

187
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
If you go to the itch.io main site, because I couldn't fit the whole link in the banner across the bottom either.

188
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
If you just go to the itch.io main page, it's right there. You'll see a banner right in the middle of the page.

189
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So we do have some other ways that the industry is stepping up.

190
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:17,000
The Pokemon company is donating or has donated two hundred thousand dollars to Black Lives Matter and NAACP.

191
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They gave a hundred grand, a hundred grand each.

192
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And Niantic also pledged that all of its proceeds from the upcoming Pokemon Go Fest with a minimum pledge of five million will be donated to black game creators and nonprofit organizations.

193
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Niantic's move here was big. Like I was I I was so proud to be like I'm usually one of the biggest critics of Niantic games.

194
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:51,000
That's because I love them so damn much. But like I was so proud when I saw like what they were doing, because that was a great example of like not just open your purse, but like do something.

195
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It was great. I also like what the Pokemon company had to say about it.

196
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Here at the Pokemon Company International, we believe in friendship, inclusivity and equity.

197
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
These are the values that anchor the Pokemon brand. There is no place for oppression within our community.

198
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We stand in solidarity with our black employees, fans and families who continue to be impacted by systematic racism and senseless violence.

199
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So to another tweet out there, there's smite.

200
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
They came right out and said, today we've completed a full chat log review and have suspended over 5000 accounts for racism.

201
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We've also implemented new tech for our team to find and punish racist actions more easily.

202
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
We still have work to do and are committed to ensuring smite is a hate free environment.

203
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And then I saw further down and it just looking through a post that there was someone who.

204
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm trying to find it. They found someone who had been really bad about it.

205
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And they actually banned him and instead now they have it to where he's donating like his entire paycheck toward Black Lives Matter.

206
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
One of the charities. But I thought that was really good that they did that.

207
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And then another one. And this one, of course, is a bit nearer and dear to my heart.

208
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:31,000
There's protests in Animal Crossing. And now you know how the there was the big Hong Kong resistance protests that have been on enough to make China want to ban poke and not Pokemon, but Animal Crossing.

209
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, now we have a big slew of Black Lives Matter protests of people getting together, you know, putting video, putting content up.

210
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I even in my Animal Crossing community, it is a private one.

211
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So let me know if you're interested. But I do have a big thread on here of people just posting things related to Black Lives Matter and things.

212
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Also, I have another one for LGBT items, but I'm happy for there to be crossover in those two things.

213
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And I like that one of the people running Twitter, it's the Animal Crossing struggles.

214
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Black Lives Matter Twitter said the lives of real people, metal matters so much more than just an account gimmick.

215
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So there you go.

216
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I've been posting what I can. I'm picking different things that interest me and adding the message to it.

217
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You know, we can we can do a little bit to raise awareness.

218
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We can do a lot more to to be a force for change. And our video games can be part of that.

219
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We can hold the companies that we buy from. We can hold their asses to the fire and say do something.

220
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And at least they see which way the wind is blowing and are acting accordingly.

221
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And I think it's it's like when we talk about like actually making the tangible change, like for how long have we all complained about going on to Xbox Live?

222
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And Xbox Live is just my baseline, any voice chat, any game anywhere.

223
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But how long have we complained about going on to Xbox Live?

224
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And all you hear is racial slur, racial slur, slur for gay people, slur for gay people, racial slur.

225
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And now, like finally, after all these years, I mean, you hear a little bit here and there.

226
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But now, like to have these big games come in and say enough and really start to swing, like the Smite example and all that.

227
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
We're going to put in technology that finds this stuff and weeds it out.

228
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Like, thank you. Finally, we're moving in the right direction. And that's going to make gaming better for everyone.

229
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
See, you want to all lives matter, this stuff.

230
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Guess what? By addressing some of the inequalities over here, we can all benefit.

231
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
How about that? Am I right?

232
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, it's just I'm so I'm so so heartbroken and disgusted.

233
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Just I let me let me go. I know. I know.

234
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Let me go ahead and move on to Loki, because you have some other industry companies.

235
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You want to talk about what they're doing.

236
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So Activision, Infinity Ward actually are making some changes to Call of Duty Modern Warfare to address some of these.

237
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
As you mentioned, you know, racist, homophobic comments that are in chat and that type of stuff.

238
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So they put out a tweet on the third saying that there's no place for racist content in our game.

239
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
This is an effort we begin to launch and we need to do a better job.

240
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We're issuing thousands of daily bans of racist and hate oriented names, but we know that we have to do more.

241
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And we are. And so in addition to that, they're adding additional resources to modern ID racist content,

242
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,000
adding additional in-game reporting systems to increase the number of bans by hour, adding filters, greater restrictions on name changes,

243
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:18,000
evaluating in-game improvements to make it easier to report offenses and increasing permanent bans to root out repeat offenders.

244
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Along with that, they also had added some Black Lives Matter content to the game as well.

245
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So they have like kind of a little bit of a splash screen and that kind of a part of the way you sign in and talks about,

246
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
you know, how, you know, this is an important movement and that this kind of behavior is not going to be tolerated.

247
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And then on another company, we've got 2K games.

248
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So in NBA 2K20, they're giving players I Can't Breathe, Black Lives Matter shirts and Say Their Names shirts all available for free.

249
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So you can, you know, of course, dress up your player to kind of commemorate that.

250
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And then they're also putting up a banner about in memorum for George Floyd.

251
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
They're going to be suspending gameplay. They did it for two hours.

252
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I know there's other services of the same thing, like Grand Theft Auto Online did that as well and Red Dead Online.

253
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And it looks like they even had, you know, of course, with these different shirts and whatnot.

254
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
There's people doing like protests within the games as well.

255
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So that's kind of cool that they're doing that.

256
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
What else? So we have other charities, of course, getting large sums of money from different companies.

257
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So one of those being Niantic, they're donating five million dollars minimum to support Black Lives Matter as well.

258
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm not sure with the exact charity that they're giving to or if it's going to be kind of split up months that.

259
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It looks like that they had also mentioned they'd be donating one hundred thousand dollars to the Marsha P. Johnson Institute as well.

260
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That helps. It's dedicated to protecting and defending the rights of black trans people.

261
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And then what else? So.

262
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That's it. Yeah.

263
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So go ahead, Jamie.

264
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I was also just noticing I can actually go into it later, but just I just saw a new stream of information come by with other people who you wouldn't expect to support the movement supporting it.

265
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah, no, I saw that earlier as well. You talk about Mitt Romney, right?

266
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah, but also GoFundMe suspended Candace Owens.

267
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Oh, right there. Yeah. So. So anyway, yeah.

268
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You know, and I think that just goes to show, like, you don't have to be left leaning or right leaning to understand what is, you know, what the nation is talking about right now.

269
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Like it isn't it's not a political issue. People want to make it a political issue, but it's not.

270
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So anyway.

271
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But again, and as I responded to our person that had to loudly announce that they were uncomfortable, so they were leaving.

272
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The industry is is listening to these protests. The industry is making small changes.

273
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You know, it's not just in video gaming either. Like, we're seeing other industries across the board respond to this.

274
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This is the one. This one, I think, is kind of powerful because it is Pride Month. Dark Soccer.

275
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You know about those apps that gay guys and the like like Grinder.

276
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And do you know what the big change they made this week?

277
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Oh, yeah, they're removing. Aren't they removing like the ethnicity filter?

278
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
They are removing the ethnicity filter so you can no longer search for people by ethnicity.

279
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And of course, a lot of people are responding to that with, well, why was that even there in the first place, which is a great question.

280
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
However, I do think you should still, you know, applaud this. This is tangible change.

281
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
This is great change in the right direction. We should be asking that question.

282
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Why was that even a thing in the first place? Because that just plays into the whole, you know, oh, it's just a preference, you know, in that whole.

283
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I have heard at the clubs saying, well, I met up with this dude, but he was Asian.

284
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh, or I met up with this dude. But this girl, I've heard a lot.

285
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I know. I know, you know, but and that's why I'm saying this is a great baby step.

286
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I mean, again, it's not like we can say, hooray, war is over, but it's a great baby step in the right direction.

287
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And these are the types of things that should be acknowledged in like, yay, we want to see more of that.

288
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Right. So and the gaming company is doing a lot of like good stuff.

289
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And, you know, I know this was the episode we should have been talking about PlayStation 4 and heading into Earth.

290
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Excuse me. We still talk PlayStation 4. Should've been talking about PlayStation 5 and a lot of the stuff heading into E3 and all that stuff.

291
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But you know what? Well, that's that stuff will still be there in a few weeks.

292
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It'll still be there, you know, because right now these conversations can't wait anymore because lives are at stake.

293
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So anyway. Absolutely that. Absolutely.

294
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The lives of other humans are going to matter more than what you feel about a game.

295
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Right. Sorry. That's not sorry. That's that was true about COVID as well.

296
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And it's that that hasn't changed. That part hasn't changed.

297
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
For some reason, some people's feelings change, but that's a whole nother.

298
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You know, those people can bite my ass anyway.

299
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Those those people, those people I'm going to.

300
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm going to I don't know what else to send, but thoughts and prayers that they're going to change what that does.

301
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I know. I know. But what else can I send those folks that they might listen to?

302
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Diarrhea. All right. Anyway, Marissa.

303
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Oh my gosh. I smell nothing but poo. Maybe if I stopped being shitty, people would stop sending me shit.

304
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Marissa. I'm smart. Marissa in chat says, inspired by Rob. I'm going to yell, yay, now more at brands.

305
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I don't think I invented that. But sure, if that's it. Thank you. I'm flattered. All right.

306
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Anyhow, let's move on because I know we've spent a lot of the show and we needed to.

307
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:39,000
We needed to. But I also know there are a lot of folks that are still looking for video game chat and who need a moment to decompress and talk about games.

308
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So let's talk about games and what else is going on in our gaming world.

309
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

310
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And I suppose the last two weeks, if you want dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Animal Crossing.

311
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And we got of course, we had got AC DC pinball, which I finally took some time to play.

312
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And we still have that scared stiff over here.

313
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But Dan bought one of the old Star Trek tables and he brought him something else.

314
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
But I don't remember. I think it was just the Star Trek one. It's a little toasty in this room.

315
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So really, that's about it. I haven't really been doing much because honestly, Animal Crossing has been my happy place.

316
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's been my comfort. And there you go. Yeah.

317
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And I hate to say this because I know it is hot in there, but be careful with a fan too close to the mic because we can hear the.

318
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Normally I have this thing muted. OK. Oh, yeah. That's all right. Sorry.

319
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Although we do love a fan as an accessory, but you just got to be careful with the mic.

320
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
OK, let's see. Loki, how is your gaming week?

321
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It's all Minecraft. So I played lots of Minecraft on our realm and I started to play Minecraft Dungeons,

322
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
but then I stopped because it wasn't recognizing my controller for some reason.

323
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And it could be because when I plug in my controller to my USB hub or whatever, it starts to kind of freak out a little bit sometimes.

324
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And so it'll think it's like a second player controller. And some games don't like that necessarily.

325
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And I just didn't want to bother with it. I didn't want to play keyboard and mouse, even though that game probably could be played keyboard mouse pretty easily.

326
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But I watched the intro of it. But then I went back to playing regular Minecraft and that's what I've been doing an awful lot.

327
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So in our realm, since we've been doing all survival, we have this giant mansion I've built.

328
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
We now have a well, I was trying to make a villager spawning farm that didn't work out.

329
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So I had to do a plan B and we just now there's too many villagers. And then today was making food farms.

330
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So we did melons, pumpkins, and I made a sugar cane farm that makes way too much sugar cane.

331
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So now I know when I go back and I have three chests full of sugar cane. And my kids love it.

332
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Awesome. I've been enjoying Minecraft Dungeons as well. I was playing it more like the last week as opposed to this recent week.

333
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But it's fun. It's very like old school Diablo. It doesn't have a lot of the conveniences and the features that a newer Diablo game has.

334
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's very parsed down, but I've enjoyed it. I've probably played more of that than actual Minecraft.

335
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Well, yeah. And I do want to go in and play it eventually. I know it's really short. I heard it's like about three hours long and stuff.

336
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So I'll probably end up playing that at some point maybe this week if I can get the controller stuff working correctly.

337
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Whoever's saying it's three hours long is just going straight from point A to B and is not exploring every nook and cranny.

338
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And that's not the way I play Diablo. So because I've already spent at least three hours in that game and I'm probably only like four maps in.

339
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
OK, well, it depends on how you play games. It really does.

340
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah. So I had to play that at some point. And of course, I play lots of Orna. So I've been doing dungeons each day.

341
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So usually about two at least two dungeons a day because I have one that's near my house and in one day, of course, you always have.

342
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And then I've been hitting the raid boss that just sits there just eating, you know, HP.

343
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And so I've been doing that a lot, just trying to level up stuff and level up gear. So I have a bunch of ornate stuff.

344
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
You need a zet to go give it a whooping because that's how I finally got my raid boss down as she came over and she just put up like a million damage on it.

345
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's not. Yeah, it's not that like I can't defeat it. It's just it takes a long time. I don't want to spend time doing this.

346
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
What the hell is going on, Jamie?

347
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I think she's having a conversation with she's having a conversation with chat showing off her different toys or something like that.

348
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, I'm trying to be visually appealing, but the only thing appealing thing I have are my toys.

349
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So and finally, I got my set up. So like, even though you can't really see it right now because of the green screen software, it's X split V cam because I don't have a green screen.

350
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I thought about getting one, but let's know those are kind of expensive and hard to find right now. And it does the job.

351
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
OK, it's kind of like, you know, Zoom or something like that.

352
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But let's see if I can actually get it. But I also have my snowball right here on a boom arm now.

353
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So super fancy. And I've got an actual stream deck as well. So super fancy. I need to do some more streaming.

354
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
That's great. Nice. All right. My gaming week. I've been playing.

355
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry. One last thing I wanted to interrupt with. Go for it. And it's important is I wanted to congratulate Extifer and Matt on their brand new baby.

356
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Thank you. That is very important to say. So our pal Extifer and his his hubby, Matt, they had a baby.

357
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And is it allowed? Maybe I shouldn't say the name. That might be private, but I'll ask him if I can say it on next week's show.

358
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But I I don't know how to pronounce it because there's two ways you can pronounce the name. So he's got to tell me later.

359
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Don't say it on air. Well, and also, I just want to say, even though it was a paid service,

360
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I do want to say good job to their surrogate for going through the pain that goes into making a person.

361
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah. Even sure there's money involved, but it is still a very selfless thing to do.

362
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Like I am I am going to go through this pain and trauma to help gay guys have a baby like that's.

363
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And there's also a it's also important to note that there's a donor as well. So it's actually two women involved.

364
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But yes. So kudos to everybody making a baby's hard work.

365
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
A lot of a lot of people involved. All right. Anyway. Excuse me. How does that look like?

366
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Jigglypuff. That is that's a Kirby, not a jigglypuff. Kirby. All right.

367
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Anyway, my game is Jigglypuff. I've been playing a little bit of Animal Crossing, but dark soccer.

368
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Don't be disappointed in me. I think some of the thrill might be winding down in Animal Crossing.

369
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Like I feel like I think because I beat the turnip game and I'm I'm not a very good remodeler when it comes to.

370
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
What do I do with the town? I feel like I'm running out of things to do. I don't know.

371
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I don't know if I'm finding that motivation for me for Animal Crossing every day.

372
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Again, I understand. I know other people are still having a great time with it.

373
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And I ain't here to poop on that parade. But I'm just I may have hit that point.

374
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
At that point, dark soccer and where I'm like, what am I? Maybe when there's a game over until you have 10 million bills.

375
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Maybe. Well, I'm up to at least six or seven million. Thanks to stonks. So there's that.

376
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Well, if you're done, just give me your bells. Shit. No, because I think it'll be the seasonal events that bring me back.

377
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Honestly, I think it'll be those that make me want to pop open the game and see what's going on.

378
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And you and I both know there's going to be DLC at some point.

379
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
There will absolutely be DLC that are that's going to add to the game and add more to it at some point. Right.

380
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Well, that's what they're doing the holidays. And I mean, and we just got with an update, we got leaf.

381
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And we got red. And, you know, they're going to be doing Brewster at the.

382
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Word, the museum. Yeah, you have to remember people's coffee orders, and that was kind of annoying.

383
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah, so there's going to be there's going to be a lot more that gets added to it and so forth.

384
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So that'll have songs left to go. Oh, wow. That's great.

385
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
All right. But I have been distracted by other games and all on the switch as well.

386
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I've been playing clubhouse games, which just came out like two days ago, which is the fifty one board game mini game collection.

387
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But it's great. It reminds me of like old PC games that used to put all this stuff together into one collection.

388
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And I used to love those games. And so clubhouse games is cool.

389
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I love the fact that they put out a client that you can download on a friend's switch or in this case, you know, the other switch in my household.

390
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And that way he can play the games with me if he wants. So that's great. I love that. That's a great feature.

391
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And so I'm liking that so far. And then I've been spending a lot of time with Xenoblade Chronicles that the remaster of that came out last Friday.

392
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And I've been spending quite a bit of time with Xenoblade Chronicles. And it's a it's a good RPG.

393
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So many side quests. It almost gets overwhelming everything there is to keep track of.

394
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And there's like I feel like every time I'm like, OK, I got past this tutorial and I understand this part.

395
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's like, oh, but wait, there's another layer to this game or there's another mechanic we're going to throw into it.

396
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So I'm almost getting overwhelmed in that sense. But the good news is there is a Bobby Black Wolf mode.

397
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So they did put in the remaster like a filthy casual mode, essentially. And I'm not afraid to use it.

398
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So far, I haven't had to. Although the game has suggested to me maybe I ought to start.

399
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I died too many times in one spot. But I was like, no, I'm going to do this one more time.

400
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm going to go level up over here and then try it again. That worked. I was able to get past it.

401
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But there is a mode to make it easier, which I think is a great thing.

402
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And there's there's a lot, a lot of great things to do. So many side quests and things.

403
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And yeah, you guys in chat Quest Buster says Xenoblade Chronicles is great.

404
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Meesh in chat says, I swear that's my favorite game.

405
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't know if that's in regards to Xenoblade or if it's in regards to Animal Crossing, which Nifty had brought up before.

406
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But yeah, Xenoblade is a very, very deep RPG and not the type of thing I think you usually would expect to see on the switch.

407
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And I want to say when I when I briefly looked at the Wii version years ago,

408
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I think I said something like it's the best PlayStation 2 RPG on the Wii.

409
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And in a way that kind of still holds true. Like it's the type of thing you would expect to see on like a PlayStation.

410
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
But it's it's a great Switch title for sure. So, yeah.

411
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Been loving Xenoblade Chronicles. So that has been my gaming week.

412
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So in my personal week, though, I do have to state I had like dental surgery on Thursday and they took a tooth out.

413
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's way in the back. You can't see. I still have a great smile.

414
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But one of my teeth was just beyond messed up in the back. So that's why you've been saying I'm older.

415
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
That's why you've been seeing me scarf down food on stream and why I'm going to step away right now to go get a pain pill,

416
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
because I'm actually kind of hurting right now. So if my co-host would mind taking over for just a minute, that would be great.

417
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So we can start tonight's news. Loki.

418
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
OK, so let's talk a little bit about Sony again.

419
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:33,000
So Sony, unfortunately, has been fined two point four million by the Australian court for apparently misleading PlayStation players about their game refund policy.

420
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So it says consumer guarantee rights do not expire after ad digital product has been downloaded and certainly do not disappear after 14 days or any arbitrary date claimed by the game store developer.

421
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:55,000
This is what Sony told these consumers was false and does not reflect the consumer guarantee rights afforded to Australian consumers.

422
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So because in Australia, I think they can refund. There's some laws regarding digital purchases, if I remember correctly.

423
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:12,000
But apparently, Sony Europe was it doesn't seem like there's that many folks that were involved in that originally says made.

424
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:21,000
It says four players in Australia think that they only had 14 days to return a digital game, even though they could only get a refund if it is authorized by the game developer who made it.

425
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And a fifth person, meanwhile, had to was apparently told by Sony Europe that their refund had to be in a currency of PlayStation Store rather than getting their money back outright.

426
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So, yeah, a little bit of misinformation.

427
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Unfortunately, that cost them, you know, two point four million dollars, which.

428
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That's not really good. And of course, that's three point five million in Australian dollars.

429
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Two point four is kind of the conversion rate. I mean.

430
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I guess cost of doing business, but, you know, they got to be in alignment with all these other countries because, of course, everybody has different laws in different territories and Germany and even Australia.

431
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,000
One point was pretty restrictive about what kind of adult content was in there, including violence.

432
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So there's some really crazy consumer law laws down in that part of the world, too.

433
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So. Yeah, so it's kind of kind of surprising, but at the same time, you know, not really.

434
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I don't know, they've I'm surprised at Sony. I kind of expect something like this from like, you know, an EA or two K or something like that.

435
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:42,000
But. But, yeah, so that's unfortunate.

436
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I don't know. So.

437
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
See.

438
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I'm back. Sorry, I missed.

439
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Did I miss anything?

440
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I know you missed us hallucinating.

441
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I just realized I can see you guys. You can't see my cam because the way everything's set up so you don't know that I just sat back down.

442
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I do because I have. Oh, you have Twitch up. OK, well, that's good.

443
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And then what's happening over here now because of the Webcams running and everything that's going.

444
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I don't know about you guys. My audio and video is completely out of sync on the monitor here.

445
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So hopefully, hopefully it's not working that way on Twitch. But, oh, we're still we're still having a lot as we haven't made it on Twitch.

446
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So otherwise, I would hear echoes all over the place. Oh, no.

447
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Bobby says it is out of sync. Oh, shucks. This is we're starting to learn some of the downsides of using the Twitch thing.

448
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I wonder if I bet if I were to go to something like.

449
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Sorry, guys. See, I'm just learning this as we're going tonight, too, that some things are out of sync.

450
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I bet if I were to go to something like I'm trying to bring up a new.

451
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Well, whatever. I'll just also spoiler alert for something that's coming up later.

452
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
If I were to go out video for an exchange, change the scene there and change it back.

453
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Oh, no, it's still out of sync. Oh, gross. Sorry, guys.

454
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I don't know what's I don't know what's causing that. All right.

455
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Yeah. Sorry. It's out of sync. And I'm not sure what to do about it right now.

456
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
So we'll just we'll have to put up with it for a little while longer. I wonder if I go back.

457
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I wonder if I go back to the shot that doesn't have the video in it.

458
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
If maybe that'll help put it back together. Maybe it'll catch up. So we'll see.

459
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm going to just hang on the shot for just a minute and I'll go back to my co-host and see if that helps some of the syncing problem,

460
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
which I think what you need to do is you just need to do what they do in the film industry,

461
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:32,000
which is you get a clapper, you smack it, and that way you just sync up your audio and your visuals when you go and post.

462
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Well, I think it was fine. I think time to start learning Final Cut.

463
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I think it was fine in the beginning of the show.

464
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And I think it's something where the taxing of all the stuff that's.

465
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah. Because I think. Yeah. Now as I look at the TV, it's back in sync.

466
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So I think it's something about like having to pull down all the visuals. OBS is choking a little bit.

467
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yeah. See, that's all it was. I just had to go back. So what I'm going to have to do,

468
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I'm just have to be a little bit more intermittent with the video.

469
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So I'll have to show you guys for a little bit. And then when I notice it's out of sync, go back to just me.

470
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So, yeah, boy, showing up toys. No, we're learning. We're learning as we go here.

471
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So it's part of the fun of exploring new and fun toys here on Twitch.

472
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
OK, in the meantime, let's move on to the next story, which I think is mine,

473
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
which has to do with more EA things that are popping up on Steam.

474
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So EA is starting to debut more and more things on Steam, including Burnout Paradise Remastered and Mirrors Edge Catalyst.

475
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
All those games are showing up on Steam on some discounted launch prices that can be up to about 75 percent off.

476
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So, for example, Burnout Paradise Remastered is only going to set you back $4.99. Mirrors Edge Catalyst will cost you $9.99.

477
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Also, EA is talking about the EA Access, which is the video game service that is subscription based,

478
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
is going to be available on Steam later this summer.

479
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And that's I kind of think that's a pretty big deal because EA has their own thing.

480
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
EA has Origin, and yet EA is going to be partnering up with Steam in this sense.

481
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Is this EA saying that, oh, Origin is done with, Origin is over, or what is happening here with this?

482
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Any thoughts on why EA might be expanding to Steam and letting this go from Origin?

483
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Maybe their platform they found that people don't necessarily flock to the platform for titles

484
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
other than the ones that they have to buy from that platform.

485
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
You know, only with playing The Sims there.

486
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah, I think, well, some of these, I mean, a lot of these titles are all older things,

487
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
so it's probably just stuff that they've stopped making a lot of money.

488
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
No one's really going to Origin to buy this stuff, and so now they're just putting it on other platforms

489
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
to see what additional money they can make, and that's pretty much it.

490
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I mean, they're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart.

491
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
They're doing it out of the, I want more money in my wallet.

492
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
They're doing it out of the tightness of their purse.

493
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Alright, let's move on and talk about some SEGA stories, Star Sakura.

494
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Oh, SEGA. Oh, I want to love them like I used to.

495
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:20,000
SEGA is doing, they are doing a mini, if you will, or in this case, a micro.

496
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:29,000
So for their 60th anniversary, SEGA has taken the Game Gear and has done a Game Gear Micro,

497
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
and this shit is tiny. It is much smaller than a Game Boy Micro.

498
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I have a Game Boy Micro. You have seen me try to play a Game Boy Micro.

499
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
This is smaller. The screen is like maybe two-thirds the size, something like that,

500
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and it's not wide because, you know, it was fucking Game Gear.

501
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And it is 80 millimeters wide with a 1.15 inch screen.

502
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Think about that. It is a postage stamp.

503
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
But you will get a replica of the Game Gear's big window magnifying accessory.

504
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Oh, because you fucking need it.

505
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So each of the colors comes with four games installed on it.

506
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
There's a black one that comes with Sonic, Outrun, Royal Stone, Pio Pio Tzu.

507
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The blue has Sonic and Tails, Gunstar Heroes, Sylvan and Tails, and Baku Baku Animal.

508
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
See, now Dan and I are going to have a fight because I want Pio Pio and he'll want Gunstar Heroes.

509
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Red has Game Gear, Shinobi, Columns, and two Megami Tensei Gaiden games.

510
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And yellow has Shining Force, Shining Force 2, Shining Force Final Conflict, and Nazo Pio Arunaru.

511
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So I don't know, maybe you'll have to get all of them because, I mean, Shining Force,

512
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
although I think that we have them all anyway, but we have like the Genesis ones.

513
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Actually, we do have a Game Gear that works.

514
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I'm surprised they didn't make that a little bit bigger.

515
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I mean, maybe just to keep the cost down, but like those are really small.

516
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Like, I would think just maybe make it a little bit smaller than the Game Gear was and, you know, I don't know.

517
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:21,000
So, you know what's funny though about that Pio Pio game is that it is a, the front cover on it,

518
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I mean, to do a little translation on it, it's Arl's Rue because Arl's the main character of it.

519
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
This game is freaking weird and it's a little bit of an adventure game.

520
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So, which the cover makes absolutely no fucking sense for it.

521
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
But there you go.

522
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

523
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Dartut Suya says, I'm not a fan of only having four specific games of each one, especially at that price.

524
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Yeah, they are a little bit pricey and it's not like you're getting a whole,

525
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I mean, especially when you compare it to like the NES mini or the SNES mini,

526
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
like, I'm not sure there's a great value in there, but I don't know.

527
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
But Tiger Claw says, these are more for collectors.

528
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I doubt someone is going to spend hours upon hours playing these games on a tiny screen.

529
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And I kind of think that I think there is some accuracy to that comment just because like I collect those,

530
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
you know, those little mini arcade machines, you know, those machines very well, Dark Soccer,

531
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
that I collect those mini arcade machines.

532
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And I don't play them that much.

533
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It's just kind of like have them to collect them.

534
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Right.

535
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Like a bunch of them.

536
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Yeah.

537
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And I like to collect them.

538
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
So we also got that crappy Mortal Kombat ones.

539
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Genesis Mortal Kombat with no blood code.

540
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It is Genesis Mortal Kombat with no blood code, but it's it's a collectible.

541
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Right.

542
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So, yeah, I don't know.

543
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I mean, I think I mean, they're 50 bucks.

544
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I mean, I think I mean, they're 50 bucks.

545
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Well, technically forty nine, 80 yen.

546
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So roughly forty five bucks US.

547
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
But the thing is, is that.

548
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I mean, there's not really anything on the red one that I would want to play.

549
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I mean, yeah, you get Megami Tensei Gaiden and you know, you have the Shining Force games,

550
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
although honestly, I didn't really care for them on Game Gear.

551
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I think I would just want the black one and the red one so I could get Outrun, you know, and Pupil.

552
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And I could get Gunstar Heroes.

553
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Which we have an inbox sealed Gunstar Heroes for Game Gear.

554
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So fancy was the point.

555
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
All right.

556
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
At a California extreme, which officially is not happening this year.

557
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Exactly.

558
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I don't know if you've heard this.

559
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
For the record, the Golden State Pinball Expo, of course, was canceled.

560
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I think it would have already happened.

561
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
And a good number of others were waiting for some of the other big ones to cancel.

562
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah.

563
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
All right.

564
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Well, there's some other Sega news and I think this one's pretty it's pretty interesting and exciting.

565
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
So we have one looking back and now another looking forward.

566
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Right, Loki?

567
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Yeah.

568
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So this is a brand new streaming platform that's looking to turn some Sega arcades to data centers.

569
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So they're calling it Fog Gaming.

570
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And the concept is basically using these arcade centers as like a kind of more locally centralized data centers.

571
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It'll allow users to be able to connect to these services with lower latency because they're connecting to newer locations.

572
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And so not necessarily sure what they're going to be streaming amongst the service, whether it's actually arcade games or what.

573
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:56,000
But it is something kind of neat that they're going to be utilizing these arcades to basically propel entertainment a little bit forward as well.

574
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's a neat idea.

575
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
We don't have that many arcades here in the States, but in Japan, they definitely have quite a few.

576
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So I can see how this is going to work out well over there.

577
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Well, you never know if they end up partnering with somebody like Round One or something like Konami did to put Bomani out here officially in the US in some way.

578
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You know, there's always those types of partnerships that could be explored.

579
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Of course, obviously, with covid and everything, we're not really looking at arcades right now.

580
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Although ironically, you know, Bobby had a great show tonight.

581
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And one thing he did, he actually he went to an arcade in his town and brought some video back about how things are different and what they're doing in response to covid and all that.

582
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And showed like the station right up front where you have to wear put on a mask and wash your hands and how the pinball machines are spaced out more than they would be.

583
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,000
So anyway, I won't steal too much of his thunder, but it is interesting to see how the arcade industry.

584
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Well, I don't know if I should say industry because this was like a very small kind of independent owner in his neck of the woods that's had to make some changes.

585
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But, you know, we were all excited pre covid about Round One coming to Sacramento.

586
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And I have. Yeah. So waiting for that whenever that's going to happen.

587
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Well, I was supposed to be this year. Loki is the reality is it might not like what the hell's covid going to do this whole situation?

588
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:23,000
We don't know. And I'm not expecting it. I mean, yes, the governor is talking about a wider reopening starting next week.

589
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,000
But when we talk about wise, well, I you know, again, when it comes to the governor, he's made a lot of great calls.

590
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:41,000
He was ahead of the curve with some things. I'm surprised. But, you know, and what I was going to say with the reopenings, all these reopenings have been with with modifications.

591
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So it's like, sure, they're opening restaurants back up, but they're not like they used to be.

592
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And so I'm sure they're going to open up arcades, but they're not like they used to be.

593
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So Bob, Bobby showed some of that on his show tonight, but it's going to be interesting to see, OK, does Round One even open a new site at this point?

594
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Is it going to be completely modified? What the hell is it going to look like? Right.

595
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yeah, they're probably going to have limited capacity. Like I went and got a haircut last weekend.

596
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So, you know, that was an experience that they don't let you wait in the lobby.

597
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
You have to have a mask on. There's only so many people that are allowed in at a time.

598
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,000
You have to schedule an appointment ahead of time to be able to do that.

599
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So there's lots of modifications for the dentist because I had this whole thing to aim for the dentist.

600
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Like they took my temperature, my blood pressure, which I would expect in my doctor's office, but not my dentist.

601
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You know, it's just but obviously I don't care. Like I understand it's for a reason, but it's it's just weird.

602
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Yeah. Now, by the way, Dark Soccer in a related tangent, since Bobby did that little trip this week, he actually says in chat,

603
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:53,000
this was my first time playing World Cup Soccer 94 after hearing Jamie talk a lot about it and really paying attention to it.

604
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
It really is a fun game. Yes, it is. Ours is out being shopped right now, so.

605
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:05,000
We're having the side art repainted. Well, hopefully that means it comes back bigger and better than before, right?

606
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. But finally, people appreciate it. You know, it's and I love basically the Papa Duke games.

607
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
They're they're really fun. All right.

608
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Well, speaking of things that are hopefully going to come back better and stronger later on, let's talk a little bit about Summer Games Done Quick.

609
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Now, Summer Games Done Quick hasn't been canceled per se, but the live event has been canceled, which I mean, again, who's shocked?

610
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Who's surprised? But I'm sure we're all a little sad.

611
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I know Bobby was hoping to do some big things there. And, you know, I think a lot of people were were really looking forward to Summer Games Done Quick in person.

612
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:48,000
But they are going to move it to a completely virtual event, which will happen still on the same dates, August 16th through the 23rd.

613
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:54,000
It's just the onsite portion that was scheduled to be in Bloomington, Minnesota, will not be happening.

614
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And I'm I'm sure no one is really surprised at this whole thing, because, of course, the virus does still pose a risk to the public.

615
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And there probably isn't an easy way to modify something large like this.

616
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So the usual charity will still be spotlighted. Summer Games Done Quick 2020 will be raising money for Doctors Without Borders.

617
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Last summer was the first time that the event broke three million.

618
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So we'll see if the virtual change, if, you know, that's going to allow them to still make a lot of money or if that's you know,

619
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
maybe that's going to take a little bit of a hit because it won't have that same in person.

620
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But I know they get a lot of support online and from all that. So we'll see.

621
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Yeah, I mean, it's not their first virtual event. They did one not too long ago for the whole COVID-19 thing.

622
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,000
So, I mean, that was fine. And I mean, it I'm fine with watching that again.

623
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
So I look forward to this. Oh, interesting.

624
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
So Bobby says that he is still in the mix for Summer Games Done Quick.

625
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
They're pulling hosts from the volunteer pool of people who volunteered for August. They're just going to do it over Discord instead.

626
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Well, I suppose that makes sense. Everything still has to be done virtually.

627
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And like Loki said, they did do that COVID event. So at least they've done a dry run of sorts. Right.

628
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
So we know it's it's they know what they're doing and they're going to be able to pull it off.

629
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It's just going to it's just going to be a little different maybe than what it was before.

630
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
But I still think it'll be a good event. I still think a ton of people are going to watch.

631
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It's just going to be a little different. That's all. All right.

632
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane.

633
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And every week here on the show, dark soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats,

634
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
you should be checking this game out in a segment that we call the classic game of the week.

635
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:40,000
But I think in response to a lot that's going on right now, you're going to change it up because it's your segment.

636
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
You can do what you want. Right, Jamie? Yep. So what are we doing?

637
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Well, for this one, I want to take the narrative away from the classic games and go to a classic game designer.

638
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And in light of everything going on, I wanted to bring attention to a man who is,

639
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I would probably say, the person responsible for how we play our games today.

640
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And I'm talking about Jerry Lawson. He was a African-American engineer in an industry that wasn't super welcoming of black engineers.

641
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And he is really best known in the video game industry as being the designer for the Fairchild Channel.

642
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:33,000
He he's Brooklyn born 1940. His father had some interest in science, but he was just a hard worker.

643
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And his mother worked for the city and he just started tinkering with stuff.

644
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You know, he liked the little models that he was given.

645
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And then he started tinkering with ham radios and he made and sold wonky talkies.

646
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And he was all self-taught with just through experimentation with technology.

647
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And then he eventually left to go to Silicon Valley, as you do when you want to be in the tech industry.

648
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And he started working for Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.

649
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
He actually found a video game.

650
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:24,000
One of the first video games called Computer Space came out in 1971 and inspired him to make a game called Demolition Derby.

651
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It was a coin out game. He built it in his garage and he did it in 1975 with Fairchild's F8 microprocessors.

652
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And he tested it in a pizza parlor, you know, like you do.

653
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And also it was one of the first microprocessor driven games.

654
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:51,000
So basically his bosses heard of it and they offered him a position as their head of the video division, video products division.

655
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And they were set to create the channel F.

656
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And the big innovation here, and this is what really sets him apart from, you know, the designers at the time,

657
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
is that he essentially created removable game cartridges.

658
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Because back then, and I even have one of the dedicated pong tables.

659
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I should have grabbed it and brought it up to show people, you know, what stuff looked like before they were born.

660
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:25,000
But he decided that cartridges that you could change out would be the future of the video game industry.

661
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And it was. He actually, if I recall correctly, I think that he had to petition the FCC.

662
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah, he had, it was so novel at the time that he had to approve every cartridge that he produced by the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission.

663
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And it had all kinds of different controls.

664
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It had a pause button, which, who the fuck had a pause button on their game?

665
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
This was new.

666
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Had just all kinds of neat stuff.

667
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I mean, the channel F wasn't really that commercially successful, but the innovation with that is what gave us the Atari 2600 only a couple of years later.

668
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And he was one of, he was actually the sole black member of the Homebrew Computer Club that contained Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak.

669
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And in fact, Lawson interviewed Wozniak for a position at Fairchild, but didn't hire him.

670
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And then he left Fairchild in 1980 and founded a company called VideoSoft that made software for the Atari 2600.

671
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Because the 2600 had said channel F what and beaten it.

672
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And so they closed in 85 and he started to be a consultant.

673
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:02,000
He worked with Stevie Wonder and created what was called the Wonder Clock that would wake a child with the sound of their parents' voice, but it ever actually made it to production.

674
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:08,000
And he worked in the Stanford Mentor Program and he was starting to write a book about his life.

675
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And then he was honored in March 2011 as a pioneer for his work on the video game cartridge by the Video Game Developers Association, the IGDA.

676
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And he was honored for his achievement, even posthumously for his development of the cartridge-based console model.

677
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:35,000
In 2003, so before all of this happened, of course, he started having complications from diabetes.

678
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
He lost the use of one leg and the sight from one of his eyes.

679
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And actually, I take that back, this happened a month after his 2011 award.

680
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But he died of complications from diabetes and so he is survived by his wife, his two children and his brother.

681
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And there was also a documentary about him, just a short one that was developed by Bear Mac called Profiles of African-American Success Video Series.

682
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And then also what happened after his death is that his wife donated something like 20 plus pieces of his own personal collection.

683
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:35,000
So it has the documents and preliminary design for video soft games and a complete, gosh, what else was it, the blueprint of the Fairchild Channel F.

684
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:47,000
It was a prototype cartridge called Math Quiz that was the first video game, it was a tie-in for the first video game themed television show called TV Powell.

685
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:58,000
His other blueprints for like a copy of the circuit boards, so three generations of the Channel F circuit boards.

686
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Various old cartridges that he had including a few, again, pre-releases like we had Flying Saucer which was later renamed as Desert Fox and Torpedo Alley.

687
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I mean, this is some pretty amazing stuff and the fact that she donated it really, really contributes to us knowing more about the history of our games.

688
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So, of course it was wood grain, it was the 70s, I mean, geez.

689
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:36,000
But at any rate, there is now the Jerry Lawson collection at the Museum of Play.

690
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And so I would be more than happy to post this in chat, but if you just look up the Museum of Play collections and look up Jerry Lawson,

691
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
you'll find a good write-up about him.

692
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And it's absolutely just amazing what this man accomplished and how much we owe him.

693
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
So, well done.

694
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Yeah, this whole thing does sound a little deja vu and not in a bad way at all because you've highlighted the System F as a system before when you were doing the system every so often, every month or whatever.

695
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And I remember you talking about Jerry Lawson at that time.

696
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So, yeah, he was one of those people that, and Bobby, who again had an excellent show tonight, made a really good, he spotlighted several black people and what they've contributed to video gaming.

697
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And obviously Jerry Lawson was one of them.

698
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And he brought receipts because he had a book sitting there about video game history and he's like, there's no mention of Jerry Lawson in here.

699
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And it wasn't until later on that he really got recognized for what it was that he did.

700
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So, you know, because that's what happened right now in history.

701
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,000
The first two things that get erased are the contribution of black people and the contributions of women.

702
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Yeah, I that's so funny because I was just about to say quick.

703
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Can you name an Atari twenty six hundred game named by a made by a woman?

704
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Not off the top of my head, River Raid.

705
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Yeah, but that's there was one and I forgot what I probably wouldn't know that unless,

706
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:18,000
unless like I, you know, again, it was like his I think it's because we've spotlighted that game is what maybe I don't know.

707
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,000
But I just I knew that. But again, it's one of those things that, you know, we don't I think it's very in the moment.

708
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I can't remember her name. I can go look it up very easy, but I could tell you I can remember her name.

709
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Whereas who made yours revenge? Howard Scott Warshaw.

710
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I remember that. Who made Pitfall? David Crane. I remember that because they put his name in the title of the cartridge.

711
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:51,000
To be fair, that was a whole other issue between Activision and Atari at the time that we I'm deviating from what's important right now.

712
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
But my how our industry has come a long way, at least Carol Shaw.

713
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Take that. I should I should know that. But anyway, I have a relative with the exact same name.

714
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:11,000
All right. Thank you. Bobby did Google it to try to save us there. So appreciate it.

715
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
All right.

716
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,000
At any rate, you know, we owe this man a lot. Oh, yeah.

717
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:29,000
His name definitely needs to be uplifted in the annals of a video game lore.

718
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Absolutely. Do you think you might end up spotlighting more people from now?

719
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Are you are you going to mix it up with people once in a while to is supposed to just games and pinball or what have you?

720
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Or is this a one time thing or what? Not to put you on the spot that I just I kind of I kind of like.

721
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I kind of like the idea of I know David Crane. I know Howard Scott Warshaw.

722
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I know. But I maybe don't know about some other people that I need to know about.

723
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Well, it's like the little, you know, girl in the meme. Why can't we do both? Yeah, why not?

724
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So, yeah, I'll figure it out. I'll make it happen. So I think from here on out dark soccer, it should just be the classic like spotlight of the week.

725
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And you might do a game. You might do a person. You might do a pinball table. You might do a.

726
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I don't know, you might you might do a tiger electronics.

727
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
You might do a sewing machine if that's something to do with gaming. Why not? I've done a sewing machine before.

728
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
How would the chat feel about that?

729
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Quest Buster says Bobby Blackwell says, just do a classic gaming podcast.

730
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
You know, that is not the first time it's been suggested.

731
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I've had a few people message me about doing a classic gaming podcast.

732
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And you and me and Dan had to talk about it once. You know, once a blue moon ago.

733
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah. But, you know, I had to learn the hard lesson that I need to take on less, not more.

734
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So I, I will I will happily help you to the ends of the earth.

735
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
But yeah, I got to watch how much I allow myself to be a part of it.

736
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Yeah, for sure. Well, at any rate, it is on there.

737
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And I know Marissa and I have talked about some things, but fun.

738
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I, I, I think I can do like a little 30 minute spot and go through some of these things.

739
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And now that I have more experience with logic and Final Cut Pro, I can probably put it up on the tubes.

740
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Awesome. I love that idea. All right. And by the way, I want to thank the listeners.

741
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
The listeners had a suggestion on how to fix the sinking problem, and I think it worked.

742
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,000
And that was to just reduce if I reduce your guys's pictures a little bit, it would take less.

743
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And I think it worked. So I, I made you guys just a little bit smaller, but not too small.

744
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
But I kind of cropped the pictures a little differently. I think it actually looks better, too.

745
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,000
So and that seems to fix the sink problem. So this is why I love having a live chat room.

746
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So.

747
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Go ahead. I mean, it's not the first time someone made the suggestion to me, so.

748
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
All right. Well, look forward to the future. All right. Anyhow, we're going to move on.

749
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Dark soccer. I don't know if you're taking an early leave tonight or if you're hanging out.

750
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:13,000
All right. I understand. Yeah, I understand. Anything you want to leave us with before you head out for the night?

751
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Again, if you can do anything, do something. Lift up the voices of those around you.

752
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Donate if you can. There's that I.O. charity. You know, just do something that uplifts the cause and doesn't bring it down.

753
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Black lives matter. All right. Well said. Thank you. Dark soccer. Appreciate you. Have a great night.

754
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And thanks for being here. All right. All right.

755
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:49,000
As she drops discord, I'm going to rearrange the it's going to look a little funky here because it's going to change the layout on discord.

756
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,000
So I'm going to rearrange things while Loki gets into rapid fire news.

757
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
So look, you want to start us off with some rapid fire news. Yes. Let's talk about a fan game.

758
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,000
So this is Sonic 3D blast, but in 2D.

759
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:14,000
So Sonic 3D in 2D is basically a fan game that reimagines Sonic 3D blast, the plot of the game, but in your traditional Sonic format.

760
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
So they have 15 acts, eight zones, and it's free to play.

761
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:25,000
So if you want to check it out, it's that soda nuc dot itch dot IO slash Sonic 3D 2D.

762
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,000
And it looks pretty cool. They have a little trailer for it and stuff, but like I said, free. That's the important part.

763
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And go play it. And then also we've got some other fun stuff.

764
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,000
So Kingdoms of Amalur reckoning is now being remastered.

765
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
So it's, you may remember that game a while back.

766
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Didn't, it wasn't all that popular, but it was still pretty decent game.

767
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
It was supposed to be getting sequels, but then there's a whole bunch of mismanagement of money.

768
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And so, well, we didn't end up getting it.

769
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So now at least it gives a little bit of new life with this remaster.

770
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And who knows, maybe with the remaster, it might garner some more interest and then maybe they can finance a sequel or something like that.

771
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
So you never know.

772
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
And in chat, Quest Buster says Kingdoms of Amalur was not a bad action RPG.

773
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And I've heard, I heard a lot of pretty decent things about that game as well.

774
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
So this will be a good opportunity to maybe check it out.

775
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It's set to come out on August 18th and the screenshots look pretty nice for it.

776
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It's also supposed to have all of its original DLC as well.

777
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:47,000
So yeah, pretty interesting. I don't think Curt Schilling is attached to this one.

778
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
No, no, he's, he's way, way, he's, he's old news and yeah, bye.

779
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:01,000
All right. Let me, I'm going to go back to the take crop you out just for a minute Loki to allow the cameras to catch up there while we're working with the sync issues.

780
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
But I'm going to do some rapid fire news here real quick.

781
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I kind of referenced this one already earlier in the show.

782
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
But there is a Clubhouse Games Pocket Edition.

783
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,000
So it's kind of like the demo edition, if you will, of Clubhouse Games where there are four games in it.

784
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Dominos, Connect Four, although I don't think they call it Connect Four.

785
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It's a different version of it.

786
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Die Fugo and Slot Cars.

787
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So that's kind of cool that there's like a free version.

788
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
So even if you have no interest in Clubhouse Games, you can still get those four games in particular for free.

789
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:34,000
And then if you have this, you can play localized multiplayer with somebody that has the full game.

790
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
So that's pretty cool.

791
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:42,000
So it's like a client that allows you to do kind of like that old school 3DS beaming gameplay, I guess, sort of.

792
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I don't know. That's kind of what it reminded me of.

793
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And then we have a quick story on Mortal Kombat Aftermath, which of course is the latest DLC for Mortal Kombat 11.

794
01:29:51,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Some rumors due to database scraping and the like that the characters included will be made available to individually purchase later in the month.

795
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So if you didn't already know, the characters of Shiva, Robocop, and Fujin were added to Mortal Kombat through the Aftermath expansion.

796
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
And right now you have to buy that expansion to get those characters.

797
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
But maybe not everybody wants the expansion.

798
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Maybe for whatever reason you don't care about story.

799
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Well, they'll sell it to you some way or the other.

800
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
So yeah, you can check that out.

801
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
According to a Steam update, those characters are supposed to be available June 16th.

802
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Although there's been no official word as of yet.

803
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
You can take it with a grain of salt as of now.

804
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:37,000
But it wouldn't surprise me if they were looking to do that to sell those characters separately.

805
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Because again, if there's a way to take your money, the gaming companies are going to figure out how to do that.

806
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

807
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Loki, what do we have coming out in the US this week, if anything?

808
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Not too much.

809
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
So we've got a game called Project Warlock that's coming out on PS4.

810
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Ys Memories of Celceta, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 as well.

811
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Also Project Warlock coming out later that week on the Nintendo Switch.

812
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And we have on PC Samurai Showdown.

813
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And also Samurai Showdown Neo Geo Collection.

814
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And then finally at the end of the week, Project Warlock once again coming out on Xbox One.

815
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And that's it.

816
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Alright, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases over there.

817
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I don't see anything on the Switch until June 18th.

818
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And then when I look at the PlayStation 4, I'm not sure I see anything right now either.

819
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Oh, the Wonderful 101 Remastered is kind of like your lone release in Japan on the PlayStation 4.

820
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
That comes out on the 11th on the PlayStation 4.

821
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
And I believe that already came out here in the US.

822
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
So it's just a small delay there for Japan.

823
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,000
But yeah, I know fans of that on the Wii U are looking forward to playing that all over again.

824
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
So cool. How about Europe, Loki?

825
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Europe, we've got Stellaris Console Edition coming out on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

826
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Dungeons of the Endless on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

827
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Looks like Spirit of the North on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

828
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,000
1971 Project Helios on PlayStation 4 and Switch.

829
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Descenders, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Switch.

830
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And that's it.

831
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Alright.

832
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Let's go to our mailbag.

833
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Every week you guys send us emails and we like to read our favorites here on the show.

834
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Participate at Orangeloundtrader.com is the place to send your emails.

835
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And we will read them here on air.

836
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Let's go to our first email tonight from YYR who actually sent this for last week's show.

837
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
As we discussed earlier, we didn't do one.

838
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So this should have been on last week's show if we had had one.

839
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
So YYR starts,

840
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Hello LR. As you may remember, I have an IT day job so I felt a need to chime in on something mentioned during last week's show.

841
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
All modern browsers offer a private browsing mode.

842
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Whether it's called incognito mode, a private window, or in-private browsing, its function is the same.

843
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
But from what was said last week, it sounds like it's not what you think it is.

844
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:17,000
The primary purpose of these private browsing modes is to prevent other folks who can physically access your computer from knowing where you've been.

845
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Pages that you visit using private browsing modes are not added to your history and information entered in these pages will not be saved either.

846
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Cookies from these websites will also be deleted at the end of your session.

847
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And that's it.

848
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Everything else is the same.

849
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
The websites you visit can still see and track everything you're doing.

850
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
If you're browsing at work, your employer can still see all of your activity.

851
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And your internet service provider can see all of your traffic as well.

852
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
So there you have it.

853
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Private browsing only actually gives you privacy from the other people in your living space.

854
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
That is a pretty good call out about the fact that, and I'm deviating from the email,

855
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:59,000
that's a really good call out about the fact that private browsing is not going to shut down the network chat.

856
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And that's how your IT department can see it or it's going to count towards your bandwidth on your cable bill or what have you.

857
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Using incognito mode does not shut that off.

858
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
That's important.

859
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:22,000
If you actually want to not be tracked, then never log in anything and set your browser to delete all of your cookies at the end of every session.

860
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
But that's super inconvenient so most people don't bother.

861
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:31,000
There's always a tradeoff. Convenience versus security, convenience versus privacy, etc. Enjoy.

862
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And one other thing from YYR.

863
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I actually do use Bing from time to time.

864
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
It is good for a second opinion when Google isn't giving you what you want.

865
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Also the reward points add up and as a bonus, Microsoft isn't as interested in tracking your behavior as Google is.

866
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
But we all have choices. Vote in November.

867
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Thanks again for putting the show together and have a great week.

868
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Hugs from YYR.

869
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Thank you for that.

870
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I've heard of people using Bing as an alternative and I will give you that.

871
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
The Microsoft reward thing does add up.

872
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I was adding up the Game Pass stuff and I went into the app and did other things.

873
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I ended up getting $5 off at Chipotle with the Microsoft rewards.

874
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
So I got $5 off at Chipotle, Loki.

875
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
With that kind of deals, man, you can almost get the diarrhea for free.

876
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Ain't that the truth.

877
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Well, the funny thing, I wanted it to be kind of like redundant.

878
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Where I'm actually paying for Xbox Live Gold or whatever through reward points.

879
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Because that is something you can do.

880
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
You can actually wish for more wishes on Microsoft rewards.

881
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
That's how it works.

882
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I don't know how it really bothered to like.

883
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
That seems to be how it works with GameStop.

884
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I'd go there occasionally and buy stuff for my kids.

885
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Usually around the holidays or whatever.

886
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And then they're like, oh, you got enough points to get GameStop rewards or whatever thing.

887
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I'm like, oh, you're fine.

888
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I throw the magazine away every time it comes in my mail.

889
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
But I feel if I don't get the magazine, that's like a waste of money.

890
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Even though I don't really pay for it.

891
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
All right. Let's move on and get to our second and last email tonight.

892
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
And this email comes to us from Meech.

893
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
So Meech writes this.

894
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Dear OLR, firstly, I'd like to say please excuse my grammar mistakes.

895
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
As I was never really good at writing letters and spelling and all that.

896
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Well, the good news is it's me and not talk soccer tonight.

897
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I am a little more forgiving.

898
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
We'll keep that between us.

899
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Because I'm terrible with that stuff, too.

900
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Now down to the squishy parts. LOL.

901
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Anyway, you guys have been the biggest part of my life.

902
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Our lives, I should say.

903
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Anyway, I just want to say a huge thank you for the kind words you've expressed to me over what's been going on.

904
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
You've always made me feel a part of a family.

905
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And I found a platform in which I have a voice to say what I need to say without regret.

906
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Anyway, I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone at OLR through this hard time.

907
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
We are all facing, and I look forward to every show.

908
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Sincerely, Meech.

909
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
That email means more than you could know.

910
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Thank you.

911
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
It's very rare that I can't think of anything to say.

912
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
But this is one of those moments.

913
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Sometimes you just wonder in these tricky positions.

914
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And the timing of the world and everything.

915
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
And when I do have this platform, even if it's a smaller platform, it is a platform.

916
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I always have that wonder in the back of my head.

917
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Like, shit, am I using this appropriately?

918
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Am I being a good ally?

919
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Am I doing the right thing?

920
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:47,000
And so to get an email like that, that lets us know that at least in this case,

921
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
like, yes, we're helping.

922
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Thank you.

923
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:56,000
And hey, I see that as the least we can do.

924
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Try to bring a smile to your all's face.

925
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Try to make sure people are educated and informed, too, and awake and that stuff.

926
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
That's important, too.

927
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
But if we can have a few laughs over Chipotle while we're at it,

928
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
cool.

929
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
So thank you so much for that.

930
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I really appreciate that.

931
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And, yeah, it's emails like that that are going to keep this going for another 18 years.

932
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Let me tell you.

933
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Thank you.

934
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Thank you for the heart reaction chat, too.

935
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
That sums it up.

936
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
All right.

937
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Let's move on.

938
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
We have some more show to get to.

939
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Some more news.

940
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Loki, why don't you start us off?

941
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
So, yeah.

942
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
So if you happen to have purchased Half-Life Alyx, you know, it being a Source 2 game,

943
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I was unaware that it had Steam Workshop support, but apparently it does.

944
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And people are getting pretty creative with the different levels they can make in it.

945
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So someone has went ahead and recreated PT in Half-Life Alyx.

946
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
So, yes, now you can play PT fully immersed in VR.

947
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
That should be pleasant.

948
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
How about no?

949
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
How about no?

950
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Are you sure?

951
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Pretty sure.

952
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Along with that, there's some other highlights.

953
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,000
There's some folks converting maps from Portal 2 over to Half-Life Alyx as well.

954
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,000
It doesn't quite have the portal functionality yet, so it's just kind of walking through that stuff.

955
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And then there's one that I saw pointed out called Overcharge,

956
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
which looks like a traditional Half-Life type of map.

957
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
So pretty cool.

958
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I have to go check this stuff out.

959
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
It's been a while since I looked at all this.

960
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But, yeah, lots of different mods in there, especially was it last week.

961
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:47,000
They also added that the liquid sloshing in the different wine bottles and stuff,

962
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
now they have liquid physics in there, and it's pretty amazing.

963
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I like this comment from chat.

964
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Look, I'm here for you guys to a point.

965
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And you've found it.

966
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
It's not finished yet.

967
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
They don't have any jumpscares in it, I think.

968
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Oh, well that's a little better.

969
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
It seems very creepy, yeah.

970
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
S2100mat says Flaco needs to speedrun PT and Half-Life Alyx.

971
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Hey, I don't know how to do that.

972
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I don't know how to do that.

973
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I don't know how to do that.

974
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I don't know how to do that.

975
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I don't know how to do that.

976
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Flaco needs to speedrun PT and Half-Life Alyx.

977
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Hey, I'm all about that.

978
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Of course, I can't speak for Flaco, so that's up to Flaco.

979
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Phoenix7726 asks in chat,

980
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Is there a Five Nights at Freddy VR yet?

981
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I believe there is.

982
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
They did do a Five Nights VR game, but it's like a spinoff.

983
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It's like a spinoff, right?

984
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
It's not like the first game in VR.

985
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It's like a specifically VR title, right?

986
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Yeah, it's like Help Wanted, I think is what the subtitle is on that.

987
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I thought about getting it for my kids, but they're not really bugging me.

988
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
What a loving father you are.

989
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It was their request.

990
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
It would just be like, they'd be bothering me.

991
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
No, hook up the VR. I want to play VR.

992
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
It's just an asshole.

993
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
But they do have it out there.

994
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
You can play a Five Nights at Freddy game.

995
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Alright, love it.

996
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I will not be playing.

997
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I will play this, though.

998
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I may not play the PT in Half-Life Alyx,

999
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
but I will totally play this next one.

1000
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And that is a Pac-Man Championship Edition demake.

1001
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
But it's official.

1002
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
A lot of times when we talk about these demakes,

1003
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
we're talking about somebody made a ROM hack,

1004
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
like a Halo 2600 or something,

1005
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
or I shouldn't say ROM hack,

1006
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
but maybe programmed a homebrew or something,

1007
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
did something from the ground up with that.

1008
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
But this is actually official from Namco,

1009
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
which is the demake of Pac-Man Championship Edition.

1010
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
So this is pretty cool.

1011
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,000
If you pick up all ten launch titles in the Namcot collection,

1012
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
it's not a typo or a mispronunciation.

1013
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Namcot is what Namco was being called for a short time

1014
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
when they were putting these games out on the NES.

1015
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
If you buy all ten launch titles,

1016
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
you get a special retro demake

1017
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
of Pac-Man Championship Edition from 2007.

1018
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I think that's really cool.

1019
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Now, Namcot collection was actually announced before.

1020
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
This was the new news this week.

1021
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
You can actually see a trailer online for the Namcot collection,

1022
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
and you can just buy the whole thing as a collection,

1023
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
or you can piecemeal the games one at a time on the eShop.

1024
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I want to say that recent River City Ransom Kunio-kun collection

1025
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
is really similar to this.

1026
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
You can get a physical edition with everything,

1027
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
or they've got a lot of those games piecemeal available.

1028
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
If you just want River City Ransom, you can get that.

1029
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I think I'll like PlayStation 4 or whatever.

1030
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So anyway, in the Namcot collection,

1031
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Wagyan Land, Pac-Man, Galaga, Tower of Draga, Battle City,

1032
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Star Luster, Family Jockey, Yokai, Dochuki, Dragon Spirit,

1033
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Mendel Palace, and Splatterhouse.

1034
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
So that's really cool.

1035
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
But that's a Japanese collection,

1036
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
so are we going to get to play that in the US?

1037
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And what we found out this week is yes,

1038
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
they are going to put out a version of this in the US,

1039
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
except they're not going to call it the Namcot collection.

1040
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
They're going to call it Namco Museum Archives Volume 1

1041
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
and Namco Museum Archives Volume 2.

1042
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
They are both coming out on June 18th,

1043
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
and so the titles that will be in Volume 1 are Dig Dug,

1044
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Dragon Buster, Dragon Spirit, Galaxian Mappy, Pac-Man,

1045
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
the 8-Bit Demaster of Pac-Man Championship Edition,

1046
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Splatterhouse, Sky Kid, Tower of Draga, and Xevious.

1047
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,000
In Volume 2, Battle City, Dig Dug 2, Dragon Buster 2,

1048
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Galaga, Gal Plus, Legacy of the Wizard.

1049
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
What? Fuck yes!

1050
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Finally, after all these years, I'm so about that.

1051
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Do you remember that game on the NES?

1052
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
That game was hard as balls.

1053
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
That game is hard, but it's so good.

1054
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I don't remember it offhand.

1055
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I probably would if I saw it.

1056
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Oh my god, it's such a good game.

1057
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Mappy Land, Mendel Palace, Pac-Land, Rolling Thunder, and Super Xevious.

1058
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Some of these games were never localized and released in the West.

1059
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I thought the Namco collection sounded good,

1060
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
and then we had to go and up it into this Namco Museum thing going on.

1061
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I think that is awesome.

1062
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Yeah, I'm really excited to look like that.

1063
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
No, I don't think I've ever played this game.

1064
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Oh, did you look it up on YouTube?

1065
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Yeah, Box Art Sword looks familiar, but I don't think I've ever played it.

1066
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It was a game where you could pick one of four adventures

1067
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
that was part of a family, and you went through.

1068
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
It was probably called something else in Japan,

1069
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
and I don't remember the exact name,

1070
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:55,000
because I want to say it was a multi-part series in Japan.

1071
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
I'm trying to actually bring up some footage here,

1072
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,000
but I'm having to multitask to do it here, but somebody's got it,

1073
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
so let me see if I can actually bring up a little bit.

1074
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Oh, now I'm looking at ads.

1075
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Tiger Claw, though, in our chat room did link some pictures from the demake,

1076
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
so if you want to check that out for those listening on the podcast feed,

1077
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,000
you could always, I'm sure, look that up and just Google it

1078
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
like Tiger Claw did and find that.

1079
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Now we're actually looking at some footage there from Legacy of the Wizard.

1080
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
That's what it looked like on the NES.

1081
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
It was kind of like an old-school RPG with shops and inns and things like that,

1082
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
so it looks like right now they're playing as the dad in the family,

1083
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
and you play one of four characters.

1084
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya. It's Dragon Slayer.

1085
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
That's it. It was called Dragon Slayer,

1086
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
and this was Dragon Slayer III or IV or something,

1087
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
and then they localized it, so it was a cool game.

1088
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I can't believe this is in that upcoming Namco bundle.

1089
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
That's the best news of the week.

1090
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
You know what, though, Loki? This is important to talk about.

1091
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,000
You know what is that if we get this,

1092
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
because this was published by Broderbund in the U.S.,

1093
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,000
if Legacy of the Wizard has finally made its way to a modern system

1094
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,000
after all these years, maybe there's hope for another Broderbund published game.

1095
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Maybe. Maybe there's a small bit of hope

1096
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
that another 8-bit Broderbund published game will make its way out.

1097
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
You know what game I'm talking about?

1098
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
No. What game are you talking about?

1099
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
A Guardian Legend, because I'm always talking about the Guardian Legend,

1100
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
because that game needs its due.

1101
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Just have the Guardian Legend collection.

1102
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It's just Guardian Legend.

1103
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I know they have Guardic, but...

1104
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Why not? Guardic and Guardian Legend. I'm here about that.

1105
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
So, Namco Museum 3, you out there?

1106
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Y'all out there? Work on that.

1107
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I don't know. If you got Legacy of the Wizard,

1108
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
then maybe you own the rights to that one, too.

1109
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
I don't know, but get on it.

1110
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I'll shut up now. Let's move on. Loki.

1111
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Alright. So, apparently there's a leaked copy of a build of Dead Island 2 from 2015

1112
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
that has been out there on the internets now.

1113
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It looked kind of cool. It's still definitely a work in progress.

1114
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Lots of placeholder assets in the game,

1115
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
but it kind of gave you an idea of what the gameplay looked like,

1116
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
which is very different from the original Dead Island,

1117
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
from what I remember.

1118
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Definitely way over the top with the different weapons,

1119
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
like saw blade launchers and stuff like that.

1120
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Almost kind of like that Far Cry 5 game that they just put out recently.

1121
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Interesting. I don't know how I can play said a thing,

1122
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
because this has obviously been leaked out there,

1123
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
and I don't know where you can download it.

1124
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
But it is interesting to see how there's even some developers that worked on it

1125
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
talking about some of the stuff that was in there.

1126
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Neat. But I don't know, will I ever see the full Dead Island 2 game?

1127
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Or did they even cancel it? I can't remember.

1128
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
I don't even know if they ever officially canceled it.

1129
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I remember seeing this at the last E3 I went to.

1130
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
It was like in 2014.

1131
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,000
It was a long time ago, and I sort of remember the trailer for it,

1132
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
but man, it's like, I don't know.

1133
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Oh yeah, leaked on 4chan. Of course. Why not?

1134
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
That's where all the other leaks have been coming from.

1135
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Whatever.

1136
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,000
So I thought though there was a rumor that somebody else had taken it over

1137
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
and that they had kind of restarted development,

1138
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
so I'm not sure the game is truly dead,

1139
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
but we might be looking at a Duke Nukem Forever kind of situation.

1140
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
For better or for worse.

1141
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
It looks cool though. I mean, I don't know.

1142
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I don't know.

1143
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I'd be down.

1144
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
There was like, even earlier this week,

1145
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,000
there was another video that was out there of an old Marvel Avengers game

1146
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
that they were supposed to use.

1147
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I don't remember who was working on that, but it was a wild guy.

1148
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Oh yeah, I saw that too. I saw that too.

1149
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Yeah, it was THQ.

1150
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
It looked okay.

1151
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
It was THQ.

1152
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
But it looked okay.

1153
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I would have played that, but obviously there's the new Avengers game now,

1154
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
which I don't know.

1155
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
We'll see.

1156
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
But it's neat to see these games that kind of get cancelled.

1157
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I don't know if this is ever coming out.

1158
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Obviously, if it does come out, it's going to look nothing like this,

1159
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
but it's still neat.

1160
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I wanted to ask you about this actually, Loki,

1161
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
because speaking of like, you know,

1162
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Oh, I guess it is cancelled from what it says here.

1163
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
It says the Jaeger team, it says that your boss, Timo Ullman,

1164
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
said when it was revealed that Dead Island 2 was cancelled.

1165
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Oh, bummer.

1166
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I wanted to ask you about this because I didn't talk about it during my gaming week,

1167
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
but I finally bought a game from the Epic Game Store because of the sale,

1168
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
and somebody pointing out to me that I don't have to give them my credit card

1169
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
because I can use PayPal as an intermediary.

1170
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:53,000
So I double dipped on Tetris Effect, and I bought it for like 17 bucks.

1171
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
First off, worth it because Tetris Effect in 4K,

1172
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I mean, Tetris Effect in VR is great, but Tetris Effect in 4K, also great.

1173
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
So now it's like I can choose which way to play.

1174
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
So it's great.

1175
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
But when I was on the Epic Game Store, I also noticed,

1176
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
oh yes, they're pushing this Saints Row 3 remaster thing,

1177
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
and I was like, oh, I should ask Loki if he has jumped on board with that yet,

1178
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
or you're waiting, or what.

1179
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I was going to, but it was 40 dollars.

1180
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
And it's like, I probably, well, let me guess.

1181
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Wait for Black Friday.

1182
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
30. It'd be technically 30 dollars.

1183
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
So they gave me 10 bucks for downloading a free copy of Grand Theft Auto.

1184
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
So, I mean, I could do it.

1185
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
It looked interesting.

1186
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I'm going to wait for a sale because I haven't played Saints Row 3 in a while.

1187
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
And I just got the 4 remaster not too long ago.

1188
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,000
So I don't really need to do this right away.

1189
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
All right. Fair enough.

1190
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
All right.

1191
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Well, moving on to one more story we have on the list tonight about Pokemon Go

1192
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
and a new feature that's coming out for Pokemon Go.

1193
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I don't know how many of you out there are still playing Pokemon Go.

1194
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I am. I did enough of those quests.

1195
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Like, I did the quest every week where I unlocked the special quest for free,

1196
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,000
where I'm stuck on doing 15 raids right now.

1197
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Well, I was going to say, speaking of Pokemon Go,

1198
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I know that you accidentally chatted in the wrong chat room,

1199
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,000
but I found out from you that Ingress has that new drone feature or whatever.

1200
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
That's kind of cool.

1201
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Yeah. Actually, let me come back to that because the Ingress drone thing is actually

1202
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
the best thing to happen in a game in a long time.

1203
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Let me come back to that, though.

1204
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
First, Pokemon Go.

1205
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Let's talk about the game everybody knows.

1206
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Then we'll talk about the game no one knows.

1207
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
So first, Pokemon Go.

1208
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
They are going to be doing some new updates they announced.

1209
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,000
They're going to be allowing you to do stickers on gifts.

1210
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,000
So when you send gifts to friends, you can put a little sticker on it.

1211
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Okay. Cute, I guess.

1212
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
But it adds to the collectability factor, and some people will be into it.

1213
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Maybe kids. Maybe adults, too. I don't know.

1214
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
But that's a cute little feature.

1215
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
But then the other one that has a lot of people talking is about

1216
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
inviting friends to remote raid battles,

1217
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
and that isn't necessarily one where you have to necessarily be there.

1218
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
So what will happen when the feature goes live,

1219
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
a plus button will appear in a raid lobby,

1220
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
and you can invite up to five friends to join you,

1221
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
and they will get a pop-up on their screen,

1222
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
and then that will allow your friends to all enter the raid lobby

1223
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
so they don't have to be right there in range.

1224
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
That's going to be a game changer.

1225
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
That's pretty cool, yeah.

1226
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Because I could be like,

1227
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Shane, there's an Oshawott nearby.

1228
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Do you want to raid it with me?

1229
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
And I could invite him even though he lives in another state,

1230
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
and we could raid it.

1231
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
So as an example, that is really cool,

1232
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
and I'm really excited about that.

1233
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
So I'm curious to see what changes that brings,

1234
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
because now maybe our Discord chat that we have,

1235
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
because of course we do have a Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord,

1236
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
and we have a Pokemon Go channel,

1237
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
because there's enough people that are into Pokemon Go to talk about it.

1238
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I wonder if pretty soon it's not going to turn into,

1239
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
hey, like Act Deft will say,

1240
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
hey, there's a small group of us in Mexico that want to raid,

1241
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
but we need a few more.

1242
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Can I invite some of you?

1243
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
And you could actually do that.

1244
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I think that sounds really cool.

1245
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
So I can't wait to see the implementation of this.

1246
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,000
We'll see what comes of that.

1247
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Now let's talk about the game that nobody plays.

1248
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
So Ingress implemented what's called the drone this week,

1249
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
and so what it is is at first face value,

1250
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
it looks like that it just allows you to hack portals

1251
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
anywhere in your scanner's range,

1252
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
kind of like how Pokemon allows you to raid,

1253
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
but it actually put in this whole new metagame.

1254
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Have you played with a metagame at all, Loki?

1255
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
No.

1256
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
So, okay, so what happens,

1257
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
let's say I take my drone,

1258
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
and I'm going to start,

1259
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
and let's say I start it from my house,

1260
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
and I have to deploy it at a portal within my scanner range.

1261
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
So I'm going to go deploy it at the park that's near here.

1262
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
So I deploy it there at the park.

1263
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
You can hack one portal,

1264
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
and then there will be an hour-long cooldown

1265
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
while your drone is there at that portal.

1266
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
If the enemy faction comes by and destroys that portal,

1267
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
or the portal's polarity changes in any fashion,

1268
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
the drone is basically destroyed and returned to you.

1269
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
But no big deal, right, because I just send it out again.

1270
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
But here's the twist.

1271
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
When you move the drone after an hour,

1272
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
you're not moving it from your location,

1273
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
you're moving it from the drone's location.

1274
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
So now you pick a new portal to move to

1275
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
somewhere in the drone's scanner range.

1276
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
So you're portal hopping.

1277
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
So right now, I'm not hacking the portals near my house.

1278
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I am about three miles down the main thoroughfare I live near,

1279
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
hopping from portal to portal down the entire street right now.

1280
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
So my drone is three miles from here in another city right now.

1281
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Can you link from those as well?

1282
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
No, you can only hack.

1283
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
So you can't play the whole game,

1284
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
but I like the whole fact that the drone destroying thing,

1285
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
and you don't know, I hope they put it in at some point,

1286
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
that you'll know if you killed somebody's drone,

1287
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
because right now you can't see if somebody's drone is on a portal

1288
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
or anything like that.

1289
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
If it gets back to you, it gets back to you.

1290
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
But they put in some new badges for unique portals hacked by your drone

1291
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
and furthest drone flight you've obtained.

1292
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
So I'm up to like four kilometers on my drone flight right now.

1293
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
And as soon as the show's over,

1294
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I'm going to keep hopping down the thoroughfare and see how far I get.

1295
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
So it's an interesting new meta.

1296
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
It doesn't change the existing game,

1297
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
but I like the whole fact that it's like,

1298
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
ooh, I'm going to sneak this drone around

1299
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
and try to rack up these statistics and some gear.

1300
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And maybe if you don't want to do a travel thing,

1301
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
you could leave your drone at a farm

1302
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
and just keep circling the portals at the farm once an hour

1303
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
and get gear that way.

1304
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
That's cool, yeah.

1305
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
It's an interesting little twist on the game,

1306
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
so I applaud Niantic for it.

1307
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Niantic's done a lot of good shit this week.

1308
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
They really, really have.

1309
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
You've got to give credit where that's due, that's for sure.

1310
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
All right.

1311
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Well, this brings us into the listener roundtable with our chat room.

1312
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
So if you guys have anything you'd like to discuss

1313
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
or bring up on the show, please feel free.

1314
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Sadly, during this remote recording time,

1315
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
we're not really inviting the calls on Discord

1316
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
just because it screws up all the images and things like that,

1317
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
but we are definitely curious to hear your thoughts.

1318
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
If you have anything you want to say, you can put that in the chat room.

1319
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
If you're feeling too shy tonight or you're listening on the podcast feed,

1320
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
of course, you can always tweet us, at OLR.

1321
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
You can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1322
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Excuse me, that was the wrong email address.

1323
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I don't know why I gave the seven-year-old email address.

1324
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,000
The correct email address is participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1325
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:42,000
We haven't used that email address in like seven years.

1326
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Anyway, participate at orangeloungeradio.com

1327
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
is the place to send emails, and we will read them on the air.

1328
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I will blame the surgery, the anesthesia, and the pain pills

1329
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
for my inability to recall things right now.

1330
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Loki, while we wait to see if anybody in our chat has something to say,

1331
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
do you have any last-minute stories for us?

1332
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Can I ask this? What's your background?

1333
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I didn't ask it earlier in the show.

1334
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
So, my background is because this VCam software,

1335
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:17,000
you can use just like a picture, or you can use a YouTube video.

1336
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So, I just have a YouTube video with just stuff looping.

1337
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
So, it's looping the same two-minute video.

1338
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
So, what's kind of funny, though, is like I wanted to show you

1339
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I have this video, it's like a video game study lounge radio,

1340
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
or something like that, and I used that on when I was doing

1341
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,000
the game development streams and stuff as background music,

1342
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
but it has a lot of text in it, and it reverses it,

1343
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
and there's no way to tell it not to do that.

1344
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
And so, I didn't like the way it looked,

1345
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
so I put this because there's not much text in there.

1346
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Oh, actually, no, wait. No, it doesn't reverse it.

1347
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Dang it.

1348
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Oh, actually, no, wait. No, it doesn't reverse it.

1349
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Dang it.

1350
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Okay, so reverse, I hate that with like all these Zoom and stuff

1351
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
where it reverses it when you look at your screen,

1352
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
but it's not actually reversed in the video, so.

1353
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I seriously thought, looking at your background,

1354
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I was looking at like a Sierra On-Line adventure game.

1355
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I was like, is that a Leisure Suit Larry game?

1356
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
What is that?

1357
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Because that would be a very you thing to do.

1358
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
No, no, no. It's like a shop or something.

1359
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
All right.

1360
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
So, a question from Garth the Wolf in chat.

1361
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Just joined, so I apologize if you mentioned this already,

1362
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
but Rob, have you picked up Nier Automata again?

1363
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I haven't. I'm sorry.

1364
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I need to get back to it. It's on my list.

1365
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:34,000
But in my defense, I picked up a RPG that people are equally obsessed with,

1366
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Xenoblade Chronicles, and I'm making my way through that on Switch right now,

1367
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,000
and I'm kind of loving it, so please forgive me.

1368
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I've put one RPG on the back burner for another.

1369
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says,

1370
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
My wife went to rest, but thanks so much for all the kind words.

1371
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
See, Rob did it too.

1372
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
You're welcome. Anytime.

1373
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Nothing but love here at OLR for all of you guys.

1374
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Act Def says,

1375
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
So what do you guys expect on the eventual PlayStation 5 event?

1376
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Well, we don't know when it's going to happen now at this point.

1377
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Obviously, they're kind of waiting for, I mean, it's a weird line to walk

1378
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:19,000
because I don't think the calls to address racial equality

1379
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
and things that we need to address in this country,

1380
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I don't think those things are going to die down anytime soon.

1381
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
They shouldn't. Until we have change, this has to be a momentum we keep going.

1382
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:35,000
So I'm not sure when Sony will find the appropriate time again,

1383
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
but I think we'll try to find that kind of balance between

1384
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:44,000
we're going to have these discussions and we can continue to talk about video games.

1385
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
So I would imagine Sony does that later this month,

1386
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
but they probably have to play it by ears by what goes on in the national news.

1387
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Trump could do something stupid and this whole thing goes on longer,

1388
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
like, loudly longer.

1389
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Trump could do something smart and resign

1390
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
and that could take over the conversation for a little while, too.

1391
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I know it won't, but I'm just saying you never know.

1392
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
A broken clock's wrong twice a day, right?

1393
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
So we'll see.

1394
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Garth the Wolf does say, I forgive you.

1395
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Persona 5 Royal has been taking my time.

1396
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,000
All right, well, let's say the PlayStation 5 event happens next week,

1397
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
even though I doubt it does.

1398
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,000
What are you going to expect to see from that event, Loki?

1399
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I don't know. Not gameplay.

1400
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I mean, gameplay will receive that, but it won't be actual gameplay.

1401
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Hopefully something exciting.

1402
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Like, I don't know.

1403
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I don't really know what to expect because like there's obviously Last of Us 2 is going to be coming up,

1404
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
but that's not necessarily PlayStation 5.

1405
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I mean, I guess it could have like an enhanced version of that stuff,

1406
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
but I'm hoping to see new things.

1407
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,000
I mean, it's all going to be new franchises or new entries in franchises, I would hope.

1408
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
And I don't know.

1409
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I don't know what to expect from it, and I guess that's good,

1410
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,000
but like I don't really have like a huge stake in the game for either console.

1411
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I just want to see some like good games out of it.

1412
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:21,000
And so far, like, I don't know that it's been very like, I don't know what these are.

1413
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Yeah, there's some gameplay footage or gameplay footage, you know,

1414
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
but I don't know what half of it is.

1415
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Really, it's whoever has Ridge Racers who I'm going to be most excited about.

1416
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I think like any typical E3 press conference we're used to,

1417
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
which is essentially what this is going to be of sorts,

1418
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I think there will be a mix of pre-rendered trailers that just show off ooh, prettiness.

1419
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
And I think you'll see like Gran Turismo 7 featuring in-game footage.

1420
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I think you are going to see like some of that.

1421
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I think we will see one or two games that get a deep dive and they do actually show gameplay

1422
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
because even at E3 on the main stage, they usually do that.

1423
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
There'll be one game, one or two games, they take a deep dive.

1424
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:09,000
And my gut tells me Horizon Zero Dawn Part 2 or whatever's coming next in the A-list story.

1425
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I think that is going to be your show-offy game.

1426
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I think we all know that's coming.

1427
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I think there's a big call for it.

1428
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I think it's something that's going to look really good on the PlayStation 5.

1429
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I think it's something a lot of people are going to get behind.

1430
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:27,000
And that's the one that my gut tells me they're going to really show off a Horizon Zero Dawn Part 2.

1431
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I agree with what Tigerclaw is saying in chat with...

1432
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Hopefully they demonstrate the power of having this new SSD built into the system

1433
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
and what it does for in-game load times.

1434
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I think you will see PlayStation 4 games on PlayStation 5

1435
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:50,000
and they're going to use that SSD to kind of show you the difference

1436
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
and show you what games look like.

1437
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
And they're going to use it as an opportunity to remind you of things like

1438
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Last of Us Part 2, Ghost of Tsushima, and the things that they've been hyping up lately.

1439
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Final Fantasy 7 Remaster or Remake or whatever will be in there as well.

1440
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And they're going to kind of show you how these games are better with PlayStation 5.

1441
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,000
And then I think we are going to get a rich amount of backwards compatibility

1442
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,000
fucking finally in Sony's universe, right?

1443
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Because we haven't had it since the OG PlayStation 3s, which were so limited.

1444
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
We haven't seen backwards compatibility truly since then.

1445
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
So I think we're going to get to really see some backwards compatibility

1446
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:35,000
in how PlayStation 2 games act, how PlayStation 3 games act, and so on.

1447
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:43,000
And I'm going to be so fucking happy if my PlayStation 2 discs just work in a PlayStation 5.

1448
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
And after all these years just sitting on those games,

1449
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I'm going to reap the benefits of holding on to those games and they're going to work on the PlayStation 5.

1450
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I will be so fucking happy if that digital library that I've built up on PlayStation 3 over the years

1451
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
is just going to be there on PlayStation 5 the first day.

1452
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Just imagine, it's probably going to be an expensive system,

1453
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:07,000
and I think they're setting the bar that they may be more expensive than Microsoft,

1454
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
but I think they're really going to try to show,

1455
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:17,000
hey, day one, you have 100 games available to you because of the library you've built up on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.

1456
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And I'm fine with that nowadays.

1457
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I mean, with everybody dropping the kind of money that they do on phones and everything,

1458
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I wouldn't be surprised if it's that expensive.

1459
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
I just would like that information.

1460
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I know we're not going to get that information anytime soon.

1461
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
It's probably not until the fall at least.

1462
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
We will know prices and dates and that kind of thing.

1463
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I just would like to see what they're going to offer me as far as, yeah, I know the tech specs and stuff,

1464
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
but that doesn't mean anything to me until I see what the gameplay is going to be like.

1465
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:51,000
I'd like to know more about their controller that they showed off because it just looks like the last controller,

1466
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:57,000
but I know that they've done other things to it that make it unique, so show me that.

1467
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I want to address some comments in chat here because a lot of people are lighting up about the backwards compatibility.

1468
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,000
SDG100Matt says, that may be a system seller for me in regards to the backwards compatibility.

1469
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Tigerclass says, it would be great if a PlayStation 3 disc works on the PlayStation 5 as well. Absolutely.

1470
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:16,000
ActDef says, if they actually do backwards compatibility like that, buying day one.

1471
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
And PixelPaka says, PlayStation 2 would be my dream.

1472
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
And why stop there? Let's go all the way back to the original PlayStation.

1473
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
I would be so thrilled.

1474
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:29,000
And I feel like Sony may be hearing that message, and if they really can put it out there like that,

1475
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
where it's like, bam, it all works, that is going to be huge, I think.

1476
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
And there could even be a message beyond that.

1477
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,000
We have worked for 20 years to get to this point, and you've worked for 20 years to get to this point,

1478
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
and now it's all available to you on PlayStation 5.

1479
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
And you're going to have to work another 20 years to pay this console off.

1480
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Now SheHulk10 in chat says, if they don't, it is the end of PlayStation.

1481
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I agree. However, we do know that Sony is doing at least PlayStation 4 backwards compatibility.

1482
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:10,000
That is a fact. They're showing off the PlayStation 5 using PS4 Spider-Man to show some of the SSD.

1483
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,000
They've already openly talked about PlayStation 4 backwards compatibility.

1484
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,000
So the good news is, there is some backwards compatibility.

1485
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:23,000
We just don't know, is it only a little bit, or is it like Rob's dream scenario he just explained

1486
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
that a lot of you seem to be excited about, too?

1487
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Like, on what scale is Sony going to land on with that?

1488
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
And I'm crossing my fingers.

1489
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
All right, let's get one more comment here.

1490
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Garth the Wolf in chat says, Rob, I'm finally getting Shadowbringers, but need to play through Stormblood as well.

1491
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
What server do you play on for Final Fantasy XIV now?

1492
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,000
No promises I can migrate to it, but I'm curious.

1493
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I play on Cactuar, and I don't see myself leaving anytime soon because I have a house there.

1494
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
And trying to get a house in the game is impossible.

1495
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
So that's the server I play on.

1496
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
That's the Aether data.

1497
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Really, the data center is most important because you can play with anybody on the data center.

1498
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
It says Aether, so it's the same cluster as Gilgamesh, McGarsummer, Faerie.

1499
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
There's a lot of big servers in that cluster.

1500
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:07,000
So, Dark Tetsuya talking about the backwards compatibility.

1501
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Isn't Microsoft already kind of doing that?

1502
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Hopefully, Sony will try to follow suit.

1503
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Dark Tetsuya, yes they are.

1504
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:19,000
So I think that's why it is important for Sony to be able to beat or exceed that.

1505
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Because as cool as it is that Microsoft's doing it, PlayStation goes back even further than Microsoft with the PlayStation 1.

1506
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:35,000
And in some regards, I mean PlayStation 2 and Xbox are kind of from the same generation, but I think the libraries on those consoles are very different.

1507
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:44,000
So I think if Sony can say we've included PlayStation and PlayStation 2, they'll have the bragging rights to an even richer library than Xbox does.

1508
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,000
But not to knock what Xbox is doing, because I'm very excited about what Xbox is doing.

1509
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,000
And I love their approach, and I can't wait to see what they have to say about cloud gaming.

1510
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,000
So it's an exciting time to be a gamer. It really is.

1511
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:01,000
And in the coming weeks, we're going to get to see more and more about what's going to be happening.

1512
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:06,000
All right, I guess with that, if you have no other last minute stories, Loki?

1513
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I was going to say just reminders because of all these different dates.

1514
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,000
So we have all these digital events that are happening relatively soon.

1515
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Maybe a little bit later because of the events going on in the world.

1516
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:24,000
But the next one that's supposed to be happening, though, is June 8th, which is the IGN Expo.

1517
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:30,000
So they're supposed to be showing off some games tomorrow to actually see.

1518
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I don't know what they're going to be showing.

1519
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,000
I'm sorry, is that still scheduled for tomorrow? Because I thought I heard they bumped some of that back.

1520
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Or was that stuff that was already scheduled this weekend that got bumped back?

1521
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
It was stuff that was scheduled this weekend that got bumped back.

1522
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:48,000
So it was supposed to be on the 5th, I think, and then it got bumped to the 8th.

1523
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
They're also supposed to be having something happen on June 9th as well.

1524
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:57,000
So it's supposed to be three days of digital stuff.

1525
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
But I guess it's going to be starting on June 8th.

1526
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
So we'll at least have some stuff that will be showing off this week.

1527
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:06,000
One of the games, apparently, that they've talked about already that they're going to be showing is Samurai Jack Battle through time.

1528
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:13,000
And then apparently they've got some announcements from Funcom and Merge Games and new trailers and whatnot.

1529
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
So I guess we'll have to wait and see what that is.

1530
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:28,000
And then, let's see, the next thing after that is probably not going to be until the following week with the PC Gamer Show and Guerrilla Collective on the 13th.

1531
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
And, yeah, both on the 13th.

1532
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Yeah, I mean, this week would have been E3 week.

1533
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
So it's going to be really interesting to see what it looks like now.

1534
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:43,000
I mean, obviously, everything we talked about at the beginning of the show tonight is huge.

1535
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Like, you know, what's appropriate, what's not appropriate right now.

1536
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,000
But even before that, COVID-19 and the effect that that was going to have,

1537
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:57,000
I mean, this is just, it's going to be a very interesting year for the news cycle and how we get teased with the fall announcements and all of that.

1538
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
So buckle up, everybody.

1539
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
All right.

1540
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Well, with all of that, I think it's time to end the show.

1541
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I know we're done a little early tonight, but this obviously with all the announcements getting pushed back and a lot of things were getting targeted for this next week anyway.

1542
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
There just wasn't as much news.

1543
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
We had some other bigger issues we need to spend a good chunk of the show talking about.

1544
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I'm sure you all understand.

1545
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
But I really appreciate you guys being here.

1546
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Really appreciate all the kind words.

1547
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I've seen some, I will acknowledge the bit donations and the follows and all that good stuff after the show.

1548
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I just want to say I see you.

1549
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I acknowledge you.

1550
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:39,000
And even the people that we don't see on Sunday nights who listen on the podcast feed just know how much we all appreciate you being there and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

1551
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
It means the lot.

1552
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
It means a lot.

1553
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:48,000
And let's just, you know, if I could, I guess, I guess snowballing this into my final thought a little bit, I'll say the line I always say,

1554
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

1555
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1556
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
We want to bring those voices to the table.

1557
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:04,000
And I guess like along with that, I would say, you know, that sense of the support that you show to us.

1558
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Let's make sure we're showing that support to each other and our black friends and family in this time.

1559
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Show that support to each other.

1560
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
It's so important and so necessary.

1561
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:23,000
And this is just me sending you guys a big, big hug and all of our black family that's out there listening.

1562
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
And I'm going to do my very best to support you the best I can and be a good ally for you.

1563
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
And I hope my actions will show that.

1564
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
So that's my final thought.

1565
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Loki, your final thought?

1566
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:44,000
My final thought is going to be me playing more games this week, especially since I bought that bundle of 700 some games and I don't even know what's in that.

1567
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I know there's game assets in there too and board games and books and comics and a bunch of other stuff.

1568
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
So check it out.

1569
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
It's been scrolling along the bottom throughout tonight's show.

1570
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
It's the itch.io.

1571
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
So I hope you all have checked that out for sure.

1572
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
For sure.

1573
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
So yeah.

1574
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Five dollars at the very least for 700 games, you know, and other things.

1575
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
But it's a great cause.

1576
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
So if you can bump it up to 10, 15, 20, 25.

1577
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Absolutely.

1578
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Bump it up a little. Bump it up a little.

1579
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
All right.

1580
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lodge Radio.

1581
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Thank you guys for being here.

1582
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Appreciate you all.

1583
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
We will see you next week.

1584
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
That's it.

1585
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,000
We'll see you in seven days and we'll see what video game news there is to discuss.

1586
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Thank you, Loki, for staying here with me throughout the whole show.

1587
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
And thanks, of course, to Dark Soccer, even though she had to leave early.

1588
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
And thanks to you all.

1589
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Each and every one of you all.

1590
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,000
