00:00.000 --> 00:15.240
This week, Orange Lounge Radio has turned 18, new media, works in progress, same great

00:15.240 --> 00:16.240
hosts.

00:16.240 --> 00:19.440
It's been a contentious week in gaming news, but we have a little bit of everything to

00:19.440 --> 00:20.440
discuss.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.240
The march to the next generation of gaming consoles, sequels, sequels of series past,

00:24.240 --> 00:29.560
even more remasters of truly underrated titles, time travel, the multiverse, and plenty more.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.920
Don't take my word for it.

00:30.920 --> 00:36.400
Here are your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki on the show where every gamer has

00:36.400 --> 00:37.400
a voice.

00:37.400 --> 00:45.460
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.460 --> 00:47.640
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.640 --> 00:56.800
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 825 of our show for this June

00:56.800 --> 00:58.880
the 28th of 2020.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.120
Do not be alarmed, do not adjust your televisions, do not adjust your radios, yes, there's been

01:03.120 --> 01:04.120
a few changes.

01:04.120 --> 01:10.640
A little fresh coat of paint to celebrate 18 years of doing Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10.640 --> 01:14.800
So we had a brand new, and the Twitch viewers, because we do tape live every Sunday night

01:14.800 --> 01:19.320
at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

01:19.320 --> 01:20.800
Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.000
The Twitch viewers are seeing some videos, so we used to have some static images and

01:25.000 --> 01:27.080
now we've kind of replaced those with videos.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.520
And most notably, which you're going to hear on the podcast feed and you're going to hear

01:30.520 --> 01:34.440
on Twitch is you're going to hear that brand new intro.

01:34.440 --> 01:40.040
So the old intro, we're very thankful to Midi Head who did some stuff for DDR and Beat Media

01:40.040 --> 01:41.120
back in the day.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.120
Thank you so much.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.440
We've been using that intro for a very long time, but you know, it's been like 14, 15

01:45.440 --> 01:46.440
years.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.800
So it was time for a fresh coat of paint.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.460
And this intro is very special because wait until I tell you who did the new intro.

01:52.460 --> 01:55.640
The new intro was done by my co-loser.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.320
My co-host Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers, accomplished musician.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.320
Hi, Jamie.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.320
How are you?

02:01.320 --> 02:02.320
I'm okay.

02:02.320 --> 02:08.560
I just played around and oops, I pooped an intro.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.880
No, it sounds great.

02:09.880 --> 02:14.200
And when I first heard it, you've had many different iterations of that.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.960
When I first heard it, I was like, okay, this isn't like, this isn't like quite as like,

02:18.960 --> 02:23.720
you know how like the old intro is very like, it's time to begin the show, you know?

02:23.720 --> 02:24.720
And that's a compliment.

02:24.800 --> 02:29.160
And this one's very light and airy and fantasy and I was kind of like, it kind of reminds

02:29.160 --> 02:34.840
me of like a Five Key Beat Mania song, which is a nice little like throwback, which I thought

02:34.840 --> 02:35.840
was really cool.

02:35.840 --> 02:36.840
Yeah.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.160
Well, and thank you for the compliments guys.

02:39.160 --> 02:47.520
I just, I've been learning Logic Pro X and I'm really enjoying it.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.760
It's just, and I just started playing around with like a few things, you know, cause I'm

02:50.760 --> 02:53.480
still kind of a beginner at it.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.600
But as I got through it, I was like, okay.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.840
And then I just picked out some like weird stuff on there.

03:00.840 --> 03:08.360
Like some of that really synthy stuff was actually organ music that I changed instruments

03:08.360 --> 03:10.200
on in the MIDI.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.960
And I really just liked how it turned out.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.440
So I'm like, hey, listen to this.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.080
Hey, listen.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.960
I'm surrounded by accomplished musicians because Dark Sakura of course did that theme and joining

03:21.960 --> 03:23.120
me of course every week.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.120
By the way, my name is Rob Roberts.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.920
I don't know if I said that, but hi.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.320
But joining me every week of course is tech master, Loki.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.320
Hi Loki.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.880
I haven't done anything in a long time.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.880
I know, but you used to, now this is a throwback and a lot of our like more recent listeners

03:34.880 --> 03:39.520
probably have no idea about this, but you used to do remixes like mashups.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.080
Like what do they, what do they, what do they call that club?

03:43.080 --> 03:45.880
Is it booty or whatever it's called in San Francisco where they do the mashups?

03:45.880 --> 03:49.880
Like you used to do a lot of that type of stuff on OLR and you just haven't done one

03:49.880 --> 03:50.880
in a while.

03:50.880 --> 03:51.880
Yeah.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.840
A friend of mine is a DJ there.

03:53.840 --> 03:54.840
Yeah.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.840
And meanwhile, me, I played the clarinet in high school, but like that's about as far

03:58.840 --> 04:04.080
as that's, but that's as far as my music goes, like I've tried, I, uh, I got this application

04:04.080 --> 04:05.760
on steam in a recent sale.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.000
It's called rhythmic and it's a good, it's a good, like it's a good sequencer.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.160
Like there's nothing, nothing negative against this application.

04:11.160 --> 04:15.200
I think, you know, if I, if I was able to construct anything, it would be in this application,

04:15.200 --> 04:18.200
but I'm just such a boob when it comes to that stuff.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.520
I don't know what I'm doing.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.920
Like, so I need, I guess I need to start somewhere.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.560
I don't know.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.840
Everyone has to start somewhere.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.400
There's always a learning curve when you're trying something new.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.400
True.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.280
Now, if you want to see me do complete and utter failure, watch me try to figure stuff

04:33.280 --> 04:36.440
out and in final cut, I can't move.

04:36.440 --> 04:43.120
I'm I've made my first actual movie thing in final cut and it's of Midna being stupid.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.120
Lovely.

04:44.120 --> 04:47.440
Two are new theme song by the way.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.540
Well, I didn't use final cut.

04:49.580 --> 04:53.420
I didn't use, I got to say, I didn't use an Apple product for any of the movies tonight.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.420
Except there is one exception.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.660
No, there is one exception.

04:55.660 --> 04:59.900
I used a free software called light works to do a lot of the video editing, which has

04:59.900 --> 05:01.780
worked very well.

05:01.780 --> 05:07.860
But the smush intro that only the Twitch people see, if you've never watched us live on Twitch,

05:07.860 --> 05:11.580
right after Bobby ends and we pick up, we usually have about a minute or two because

05:11.580 --> 05:13.980
we're trying to get everything together and make sure our recording starting.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.160
So it takes a minute or two for things to transition.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.760
And we have a, it used to be a static image of Mr. Smush that would say, don't go anywhere.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.760
We're coming right up.

05:21.760 --> 05:30.320
Now, I built a montage in iMovie from pictures from my phone and exported that into light

05:30.320 --> 05:34.720
works to put on the stuff I know how to do, like use my fonts and my image.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.320
So I did, I did do that.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.040
I did do one thing in iMovie.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.640
So this is, this is truly a buy.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.460
We love all computer products.

05:43.460 --> 05:48.980
We embrace them all because it's like trying to hold, it's like trying to hold something

05:48.980 --> 05:49.980
together before it breaks.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.380
You put a little duct tape there.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.620
You put a little string here.

05:53.620 --> 05:57.180
One of these days, I'm going to sit you down and teach you motion.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.180
Okay.

05:58.180 --> 05:59.180
Sounds good.

05:59.180 --> 06:03.660
That, that splash thing that I did with the interesting animations on it before, like

06:03.660 --> 06:06.460
the teaser I made, that was all made in motion.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.460
Oh, nice.

06:07.460 --> 06:08.460
Oh yeah.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.680
It's if you've used flash before motion is easy.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.960
I was going to say also speaking of art, we are debuting brand new album art this week

06:15.960 --> 06:17.180
that everybody's going to see.

06:17.180 --> 06:21.440
And that is also you, you actually, to be fair, you did that like five months ago.

06:21.440 --> 06:27.000
It was, it was supposed to be for episode 800 and for reasons and things didn't happen.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.120
And then COVID happened and it was like, well, and so the thought was, well, we'll sit on

06:32.120 --> 06:37.240
all of this until we're all back under the same roof and it'll be like our big, like

06:37.240 --> 06:38.240
up soft relaunch.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.300
Here we go.

06:39.300 --> 06:42.940
But now, unfortunately, you know, obviously the COVID thing's just getting worse in many

06:42.940 --> 06:47.000
places and it seems more and more likely, you know, we're just going to have to stay

06:47.000 --> 06:52.300
in separate locations, probably at least for the rest of the year, who knows, you know,

06:52.300 --> 06:56.560
until it's safe and we will be listening to scientists on when it is safe.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.700
And that's, that's, that's that on that.

06:58.700 --> 07:03.060
And we just had an announcement here, at least in California, that six major counties are

07:03.060 --> 07:06.820
having to close bars again, um, with us included.

07:06.820 --> 07:13.100
And one of the bars that I think you and I have frequented quite a bit, um, I'm actually

07:13.100 --> 07:18.820
friends with one of the general managers there and, um, they had an incident where someone

07:18.820 --> 07:24.580
came in and they had no symptoms when they came in three days later, they were symptomatic

07:24.580 --> 07:29.680
and thankfully called to tell them so, you know, which means that they were sick well

07:29.680 --> 07:32.020
before they actually went into the club.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.020
Yeah.

07:33.420 --> 07:38.060
I haven't been to a bar since, um, before I went on that cruise was probably the last

07:38.060 --> 07:39.660
time I was at a bar in Miami.

07:39.660 --> 07:44.680
So, um, and I have no, like, that's, if we can't get together in the same house, I have

07:44.680 --> 07:48.120
no interest in going to a bar because a bar is where you go so you don't have to meet

07:48.120 --> 07:49.120
up at somebody's house.

07:49.120 --> 07:55.420
So that I know I've done, I've done the restaurant thing and sometimes I felt very safe the most

07:55.420 --> 07:59.560
recent time you missed it on last week's episode, I kind of went off, I did not feel great and

07:59.560 --> 08:02.200
I will not go back to that restaurant even after this is over.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.720
Um, but, uh, yeah, so, uh, but I have no interest in going to bars.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.040
I actually don't think we're on the mandatory list, but we are in a recommended list.

08:10.040 --> 08:14.520
There's like six mandatory, eight recommended, but regardless, we're on the mandatory.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.520
Are we?

08:15.520 --> 08:18.600
Well, I thought we were double check, but yeah, I said at least six of them, Sacramento

08:18.600 --> 08:23.240
County included, regardless, none of us are going to a bar anytime soon.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.240
I just don't see that.

08:24.240 --> 08:28.560
I, I fussed at some of my fellow sisters quietly.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.560
Yeah.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.560
Because they did.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.560
No, I know.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.000
I know the one bar that's not downtown.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.520
I've heard has been hopping and I'm like, you, I, you couldn't pay me to go there right

08:36.520 --> 08:37.520
now.

08:37.520 --> 08:38.520
You could.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.520
Yeah.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.520
Yeah.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.520
The, uh, if I'm right, the leather place.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
Okay.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
Yeah.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.520
No, that, that's where they went.

08:44.520 --> 08:48.680
I'm still like, that place is so confined, but anyway, not to derail.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
Yes.

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
It is a video game show.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.160
The place that has pinball machines.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.160
Let's get back to games.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.160
Actually.

08:55.160 --> 09:00.000
Before we get back to games, I do want to acknowledge it has been 18 years of orange

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
launch radio.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.960
We started this show on June 23rd, 2002.

09:03.960 --> 09:09.640
So this past Tuesday we crossed having done this on a regular basis for 18 years on a

09:09.640 --> 09:11.000
pretty much a weekly basis.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Sure.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.160
We've missed a show here and there, but for the most part, you know, we're putting out

09:15.160 --> 09:18.080
40, 45 new shows a year, probably more.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.860
Um, and, uh, that's more than most television shows.

09:21.860 --> 09:24.140
That's more than most television shows put out.

09:24.140 --> 09:30.980
Um, so, uh, you know, we've, this is a huge accomplishment for us and, um, I don't really

09:30.980 --> 09:34.420
see any, you know, now that we have like a fresh coat of paint and all this other new

09:34.420 --> 09:37.620
stuff, I don't see any signs of a slowing down anytime soon.

09:37.620 --> 09:42.500
Um, I, I've just been very grateful for these on Sunday nights, especially in light of this

09:42.500 --> 09:44.140
whole like COVID thing.

09:44.140 --> 09:49.040
Um, you know, as much as it stinks that we can't all be in the same room, at least this

09:49.040 --> 09:51.680
experience gives me something to kind of like look forward to.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.160
And it's like, I have a reason to get out of bed today.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.480
Like I know it's as dreary and as depressing as that sounds, it is still like a motivation

09:58.480 --> 10:03.120
to like do something normal, if that makes sense in a non-normal world.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
Yeah.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.120
Yeah.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
Anyway.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.120
Well, and normal is relative.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.120
Yes.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
So this is normal now.

10:09.120 --> 10:14.240
Um, on a, on a much more lighthearted note, let me ask this, you know, for everybody,

10:14.240 --> 10:19.540
what's kind of been like a great reward from having done this for 18 years?

10:19.540 --> 10:22.440
Like what, what has been that motivation to keep going?

10:22.440 --> 10:27.560
Cause that's, that's a question I get a lot is how do you keep motivated for 18 years

10:27.560 --> 10:28.560
to do this?

10:28.560 --> 10:31.520
And I'm, there's a part of me that's like, I wouldn't know what to do with my Sunday

10:31.520 --> 10:34.280
nights without it.

10:34.280 --> 10:39.560
It's like, it's like that, uh, waning Garth line where Garth goes, eventually it becomes

10:39.560 --> 10:40.720
a part of you.

10:40.720 --> 10:45.560
That's kind of like where OLR is in some ways.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.320
But uh, what about for you guys, uh, Darcyra?

10:48.320 --> 10:49.320
Spite.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.320
Spite?

10:50.320 --> 10:55.480
Well, seriously, that first few weeks of doing the show and there is like, you need to get

10:55.480 --> 10:57.600
back in geeking.

10:57.600 --> 11:02.040
Well guess what?

11:02.040 --> 11:07.080
That was more when we went to a podcast and suddenly we had a much larger audience.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.080
I never, well, I don't know.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.800
Yeah, it was in the first few weeks of doing a podcast.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
Yeah.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.920
And that was, yeah, that was, uh, guess who's here and still podcasting and guess who's

11:16.920 --> 11:19.920
probably still living in mama's basement.

11:19.920 --> 11:25.400
Uh, Loki, I will read a basement bitch.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
Okay.

11:26.400 --> 11:32.320
And guess who went back to the kitchen cause I'm in the kitchen.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.480
Loki did get, get back in the kitchen where you belong.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.480
Loki, Loki.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.200
What, what, uh, what about you?

11:37.200 --> 11:39.960
What's been the reward to do this for 18 years for you?

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
I don't know.

11:40.960 --> 11:46.040
Just all the responses from people, um, you know, inspiring others to do their own shows

11:46.040 --> 11:50.080
and just, I don't know, routine.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.080
Yeah.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.280
Cause I get to talk about games cause no one else wants to hear about that except for my

11:53.280 --> 11:54.280
kids.

11:54.280 --> 11:59.360
And then, uh, but, uh, they talk about a lot about one game.

11:59.360 --> 12:06.960
So I would like to say that this gives us an amazing platform for advocacy for gamers

12:06.960 --> 12:08.400
who can't advocate for themselves.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
True.

12:09.400 --> 12:15.280
You know, we just a few weeks ago we spoke out on black lives matter.

12:15.280 --> 12:22.120
We've spoken for, um, you know, the whole quilt bag spectrum as, as you call it, you

12:22.120 --> 12:26.480
know, and for some of the lesser accepted sexualities.

12:26.480 --> 12:34.060
So I mean, hello, I'm ace, hi, um, we've, um, we've all gone through some major changes

12:34.060 --> 12:41.580
and the fact that we are basically quote, normal people living normal lives and do this

12:41.580 --> 12:42.580
for others really.

12:42.580 --> 12:46.580
And you know, for ourselves, cause hello, I am a little selfish.

12:46.580 --> 12:53.780
We, I still see no reason to stop by as long as people love us, I will thrive on that.

12:53.780 --> 12:57.340
Like a goddess living on her tributes.

12:57.340 --> 13:01.080
And to be fair, we're not going to stop talking on any of those things anytime soon, no matter

13:01.080 --> 13:02.740
what tweets we're getting.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.020
So do, do look out for that.

13:05.020 --> 13:09.300
Um, I get weird stuff once in a great while.

13:09.300 --> 13:13.340
It's not, I, I let the positive outweigh the negative and the positive is far, far, far

13:13.340 --> 13:14.340
more.

13:14.340 --> 13:15.340
Um, let's see.

13:15.340 --> 13:18.380
So SG 100 mountain chat says, yeah, I don't know what I used to do on Sunday nights before

13:18.380 --> 13:19.380
this show.

13:19.380 --> 13:22.780
And dark to see you says, yeah, I don't even remember my Sundays before OLR.

13:22.780 --> 13:23.780
It's been so long.

13:23.780 --> 13:26.660
Both of those comments from our Twitch chat at VOG network.

13:26.660 --> 13:31.540
Um, yeah, like it's, it's, I think back to what was I doing on Sunday nights before?

13:31.540 --> 13:36.580
Uh, I, we used to go to a club a lot that doesn't exist anymore.

13:36.580 --> 13:39.300
It's like, yeah, it's a cold now.

13:39.300 --> 13:48.220
No, I think, I think where the club was is the PetSmart actually, but it's, it's just,

13:48.220 --> 13:49.580
it's a fricking strip mall now.

13:49.580 --> 13:55.580
Do you remember we had my bachelorette party there and you, you came to my bachelorette

13:55.580 --> 13:57.380
party, which was awesome.

13:57.380 --> 14:04.140
And we had a bajillion jello shots that Jessica made and I made everybody watch Xanadu and

14:04.140 --> 14:08.100
we started watching Barbarella and then we're like, Hey, let's go to the club.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.980
So we went off to the rage.

14:09.980 --> 14:13.220
I think I think I separated from the girls at that point.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.980
Cause like something else is going on or something.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.700
I think it would be funny though.

14:16.700 --> 14:22.740
If, if Cole still did that Sunday night, I'll meet you down at housewares.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.740
It's called be a party.

14:24.740 --> 14:31.780
It's definitely, to answer my own question, it's definitely part of the routine thing

14:31.780 --> 14:32.780
for me.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.540
It's a great way to make sure I'm talking to Jamie and Matt at least once a week, if

14:35.540 --> 14:37.500
not more often.

14:37.500 --> 14:42.700
And you know, I think part of why I've really loved doing this is just meeting all of you

14:42.700 --> 14:48.140
guys that are listeners and part of the show's family and interacting with you guys.

14:48.140 --> 14:51.420
And it's really funny because, you know, as I've traveled to different cities, you know,

14:51.420 --> 14:54.820
I used to have a job where I did a little more travel throughout the U S and I would

14:54.820 --> 14:58.060
end up in all these different cities or I would go on vacation to different cities.

14:58.060 --> 15:01.880
And I remember somebody close to me commenting once like Rob, it doesn't seem to matter where

15:01.880 --> 15:03.520
you go in the country.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.460
You always seem to know people in this city because you're always meeting up with somebody

15:07.460 --> 15:09.500
for dinner or whatever it is.

15:09.500 --> 15:13.380
And I'm kind of like, well, I mean, yeah, when you live on the internet, like I'm fortunate

15:13.380 --> 15:19.220
through OLR and granted some other things I've done online, but mostly OLR, I have met

15:19.220 --> 15:23.300
a network of awesome people online that, you know, I'm happy to call my friends and

15:23.300 --> 15:25.000
hang out with IRL.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.540
And I've done that when I've gone to places like New York, Chicago, you name it, I've

15:28.540 --> 15:31.700
probably met somebody through OLR there.

15:31.700 --> 15:35.060
Not that I'm going to meet just anybody in a deep dark corner.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.620
These are people I've interacted with for a very long time and feel safe with.

15:38.620 --> 15:41.140
I don't want people to get the wrong idea.

15:41.140 --> 15:46.340
But like, I remember like New York, it was probably like 2006, there was a nice big chunk

15:46.340 --> 15:48.220
of OLR listeners, probably like five or six.

15:48.220 --> 15:51.700
And we all went to like a Dave and Buster's, it was like a little mini OLR con.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.940
It was a lot of fun.

15:52.940 --> 15:57.140
So and when I went back just recently, I was able to meet a couple people like YYR and

15:57.140 --> 15:58.140
Matt and Rama.

15:58.140 --> 16:01.380
And, you know, it's still good to keep in touch with all my pals out there.

16:01.380 --> 16:02.380
So it's great.

16:02.380 --> 16:08.020
And I remember when I came out for a con.

16:08.020 --> 16:10.020
Yeah, we did something.

16:10.020 --> 16:13.420
And then I drifted my Lancer going, yeah, it was anime.

16:13.460 --> 16:18.580
I drifted my Lancer going on to Treasure Island because I was like, hey, let's go here.

16:18.580 --> 16:21.020
That was pretty cool.

16:21.020 --> 16:22.020
Yeah.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.020
And frightening and very frightening.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.020
So.

16:24.020 --> 16:28.580
Uh, so yeah, I'm just, I'm thankful to everybody that's met and taken part in this and I really

16:28.580 --> 16:29.580
do appreciate you guys.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.460
And some of you guys just lurk and that's fine too.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.300
You just, you're listening to the podcast feed and then we'll get an email out of the

16:34.300 --> 16:39.020
blue like, oh yeah, I've been listening since like 2006 and I'll be like, who are you?

16:39.020 --> 16:41.060
You never send an email or call or anything.

16:41.060 --> 16:42.060
But I'm like, you know what?

16:42.100 --> 16:43.980
I still appreciate this person for being a part of it.

16:43.980 --> 16:47.100
So if you want to lurk, hey, that's fine too.

16:47.100 --> 16:52.100
Like I'm glad you've enjoyed what we've been putting out and that you all continue to listen

16:52.100 --> 16:53.100
regularly.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.100
So, all right.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.540
Well, we are going to move on with the show and talk about what's going on in the video

16:57.540 --> 17:03.300
game world and all the things we discuss every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

17:03.300 --> 17:09.140
So let's get to our kickoff topic tonight, which I wish we had a quote unquote happier

17:09.140 --> 17:10.220
thing to discuss.

17:10.220 --> 17:11.460
But this is one of those.

17:11.460 --> 17:12.900
We need to discuss it.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.500
This is something the gaming industry is going through.

17:15.500 --> 17:20.380
And like Jamie alluded to earlier, sometimes we have to address the difficult stuff too.

17:20.380 --> 17:23.460
Let me turn it over to Jamie actually, I think is going to bring us up to speed on what's

17:23.460 --> 17:24.460
going on.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.460
Yeah.

17:25.460 --> 17:30.580
And when they talk about an elephant in the room, this would be an elephant the size of

17:30.580 --> 17:32.540
a kaiju, just saying.

17:32.540 --> 17:36.340
It's pretty big and people have just been trying to ignore it forever.

17:36.340 --> 17:39.980
But it's really come to a head.

17:40.020 --> 17:46.540
Obviously, there are allegations against quite a number of, I'd say, prominent men in the

17:46.540 --> 17:49.100
video game industry.

17:49.100 --> 17:55.180
And it now looks like we have another instance added on top of it for sexual misconduct against

17:55.180 --> 18:02.180
I'm going to mispronounce this guy's name, but Chris Avaloni, four women rose to accuse

18:02.180 --> 18:04.420
him of sexual misconduct.

18:04.420 --> 18:11.380
He's a acclaimed video game writer and a leading and actually one of the developers is working

18:11.380 --> 18:19.980
with basically prompt what he departed ways with him, even though there was another game

18:19.980 --> 18:21.860
in the work works.

18:21.860 --> 18:30.940
And then there was another lady that accused Omid Daryani, who is the CEO of Online Performers

18:30.940 --> 18:36.300
Group, which is a talent agency that works with streamers of making unwelcome sexual

18:36.300 --> 18:37.860
advances.

18:37.860 --> 18:42.220
And so Daryani resigned from his position on Sunday.

18:42.220 --> 18:46.860
And then there's a lot of streamers who were planning on doing, I don't know if this was

18:46.860 --> 18:49.380
this upcoming Wednesday, I'd have to double check.

18:49.380 --> 18:58.860
I want to do a blackout for women on Twitch, which would basically the whole point of it

18:58.860 --> 19:09.340
is to make them see that this is really, really just a prime platform for all kinds of harassment

19:09.340 --> 19:11.420
to women streamers.

19:11.420 --> 19:18.780
And you know, not just, you know, it's women of all backgrounds, a lot, they just haven't

19:18.780 --> 19:28.420
really been doing a whole lot to help women who are gamers on Twitch, who are paying for

19:28.420 --> 19:31.940
their platform to exist.

19:31.940 --> 19:37.500
And you know, and looking just in the past, I mean, we had the, the whole gamer gate thing

19:37.500 --> 19:46.260
before we had the, the harassment of Anita Sarkeesian, you know, and it was real harassment.

19:46.260 --> 19:51.620
Several other, you know, people that I know, a couple of other podcasters to have been

19:51.620 --> 19:57.220
harassed in any type of online game and a lot of a lot of us have been turning to online

19:57.220 --> 20:04.860
gaming because we don't have really any other social circle right now to go out and participate

20:04.860 --> 20:06.900
in.

20:06.900 --> 20:16.420
One of the, one of the other women said that he went and told, you know, that, that Avaloni

20:16.420 --> 20:26.460
went and told her that he never meant any harm, but you know, he was quoted saying if

20:26.500 --> 20:29.900
I can't do anything to apologize for it, I understand that there's nothing more to be

20:29.900 --> 20:30.900
done.

20:30.900 --> 20:31.900
Bullshit.

20:31.900 --> 20:38.860
And the one who talked about her name is apparently Carissa, she's not giving her last name, was

20:38.860 --> 20:43.380
really on top of this, has just been bringing it to attention and spoke with Bloomberg about

20:43.380 --> 20:44.380
it too.

20:44.380 --> 20:50.380
So she said that it happened when she met Avaloni at a convention in 2012 and then another

20:50.380 --> 20:56.500
one in 2013 and then another third one who now works at a large company posted on Twitter

20:56.500 --> 21:01.740
a screenshot of an explicit message that she received from him in 2013 when she was looking

21:01.740 --> 21:03.140
to break into the industry.

21:03.140 --> 21:09.420
And another fourth said that he groped her repeatedly at a nightclub in 2014 and he's

21:09.420 --> 21:11.900
not saying anything about it.

21:11.900 --> 21:19.820
And also Obsidian CEO who was working with him also didn't comment about it as well.

21:19.820 --> 21:25.660
And then another thing that Carissa said is that he got her blackout drunk and tried to

21:25.660 --> 21:26.940
rape her.

21:26.940 --> 21:28.020
Drunk rape.

21:28.020 --> 21:33.100
Which if you can't consent, it's rape, just saying.

21:33.100 --> 21:36.420
And it's just absolutely disgusting.

21:36.420 --> 21:44.700
You know, another game designer, Kristy Dana, also said that she went out on a drink and

21:44.700 --> 21:52.380
he kept buying drinks for the group and then, you know, she passed out and woke up naked

21:52.380 --> 21:53.660
next to him.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.820
Again, that's rape.

21:55.820 --> 22:00.060
If you can't consent, it is rape.

22:00.060 --> 22:01.060
It's just really disgusting.

22:01.060 --> 22:04.180
You know, it's absolutely disgusting.

22:04.180 --> 22:09.420
And we've got more and more and more coming out because, you know, I think that we're

22:09.420 --> 22:12.580
not post-Me Too.

22:12.580 --> 22:18.780
We are constantly going to see it because it is time to not be quiet about this.

22:18.780 --> 22:30.500
You know, I had advancements one year at E3, very, I'm not going to get into it, but it's

22:30.500 --> 22:38.780
really not, it's like these guys here in this industry think that, oh, you know, you're

22:38.780 --> 22:42.100
not going to make it very far without something I have to give you.

22:42.100 --> 22:46.540
And it's kind of a casting couch situation, you know, oh, you want to get in it?

22:46.540 --> 22:52.060
Well, you got to do something for me, some quid pro quo there, and no, that is not right.

22:52.060 --> 22:59.140
You know, this, these garbage people need to be held accountable and have their balls

22:59.140 --> 23:04.220
nailed to the wall, first of all, which I would pay to see done, just saying.

23:04.220 --> 23:07.820
But they need to be held accountable.

23:07.860 --> 23:11.660
This is unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable.

23:11.660 --> 23:15.420
And I'm finally glad to see that there are more and more people speaking out against

23:15.420 --> 23:22.500
it and naming names, put the proof out there, keep your receipts and post them.

23:22.500 --> 23:29.560
It definitely feels like on Twitter, like there's just been a avalanche of these sorts

23:29.560 --> 23:34.140
of reports and it's, it's, it's not surprising, but it's still depressing.

23:34.140 --> 23:35.700
You know, it's kind of that situation.

23:35.700 --> 23:41.300
It's kind of like, unfortunately, some people in power use that power for very crappy things.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.940
And I think, you know, we're seeing that that has been some somewhat of a recurring theme

23:44.940 --> 23:50.020
in 2020, just over and over again, people in power are using power for crappy things,

23:50.020 --> 23:53.180
and the rest of us are not going to take it anymore.

23:53.180 --> 23:58.580
And it's, it's, it's gross, obviously, you know, like Jamie, I'm, I'm glad that people

23:58.580 --> 24:05.600
are being called out and we're setting a precedent and a rule that you should not be using your

24:05.600 --> 24:08.340
power for this shitty behavior.

24:08.340 --> 24:11.020
And I'm seeing, I'm seeing it everywhere on Twitter.

24:11.020 --> 24:16.160
And it's, it's, it's, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's sad.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.160
You know what I mean, Jamie?

24:17.160 --> 24:18.160
Right?

24:18.160 --> 24:20.980
Like it's, it's one of those, like, I'm sad, but I'm not surprised.

24:20.980 --> 24:25.760
I'm glad to see people are, you know, having to answer for these sorts of things, but at

24:25.760 --> 24:32.240
the same time, gross, you know, you thought better of certain people and it's, it's, it's

24:32.240 --> 24:33.240
a time.

24:33.880 --> 24:40.080
Well, and there's another one, um, a PR person for Riot Games also shared an explicit text.

24:40.080 --> 24:45.800
Um, and at the time she was trying to break in, so she forgave it, you know, but still

24:45.800 --> 24:53.520
it's, it has to go public that this behavior is not right, no matter who does this to you.

24:53.520 --> 25:00.600
Um, I, I'm glad to see this garbage now being held accountable for it and having difficulty

25:00.600 --> 25:03.400
finding work and being pushed out of work.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.900
And we need to do this with more people, you know, we need to do this with racists.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.680
We need to do this with white supremacists.

25:08.680 --> 25:14.640
We definitely need to do it with, um, definitely these sexual predators who are just pure garbage.

25:14.640 --> 25:22.280
Um, you know, they, all of these garbage humans need to be held accountable.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.940
End of story.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.220
Call them out.

25:25.220 --> 25:26.480
What can we do?

25:26.480 --> 25:27.480
Well, not we.

25:27.480 --> 25:32.080
I mean, I don't think we sitting here can do much to change Twitch, but what can Twitch

25:32.080 --> 25:37.500
do to change Twitch in these, you talked about the blackout, which I actually think was this

25:37.500 --> 25:38.500
past week.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.760
I know there was a Twitch blackout that happened on, I think it was Wednesday.

25:41.760 --> 25:46.840
Um, but I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a future protest forthcoming and so forth.

25:46.840 --> 25:52.040
But what can, cause you know, Twitch, Twitch is in this interesting position because it

25:52.040 --> 25:55.720
is a platform, but they don't, I mean, and I don't think it's realistic that they have

25:55.720 --> 26:00.160
the platform to be the detective, to be the local, you know, and so forth.

26:00.160 --> 26:06.440
But what can Twitch do to help make their platform safer?

26:06.440 --> 26:10.440
There are two words and it's not just for Twitch.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.400
It's for all, all really forums.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.840
It's for the medical industry.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.960
It's for mental health.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.000
Believe women.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.320
Don't just start writing it off and say, well, you had to have done something to have provoked

26:24.320 --> 26:25.320
this.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.280
Start it with an objective eye.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.280
Look at the proof.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.280
Oops.

26:29.280 --> 26:35.920
I just hit my meatless and say, yeah, look, look at, look at the proof submitted.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.000
Look at those chat logs.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.120
Look at screenshots that are provided and believe when we say this is happening.

26:43.120 --> 26:50.320
You know, I keep thinking back to, uh, you know, it was a few years ago where apparently

26:50.320 --> 26:55.520
like some guy had used, uh, the lady's email about something or both in the same industry

26:55.520 --> 26:56.520
did the same thing.

26:56.520 --> 27:01.560
And he started finding that people weren't responding to, uh, the request that was made

27:01.560 --> 27:05.440
that they were being condescending where she was starting to get her stuff done again.

27:05.440 --> 27:10.000
You know, she had found herself in a slump and found it difficult to, to get things from

27:10.000 --> 27:12.200
people to finish her work.

27:12.200 --> 27:21.160
And it's ridiculous that it took a man experiencing sexism to believe her because he said he hadn't

27:21.160 --> 27:22.760
believed her before that.

27:22.760 --> 27:30.480
Um, and then, you know, on top of that, just when we provide you the proof, don't start

27:30.480 --> 27:32.760
asking, Oh, well, why didn't you do this?

27:32.760 --> 27:34.240
Why didn't you do that?

27:34.240 --> 27:35.720
Fuck that.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.920
Why didn't you believe when we brought this to your attention and how many times do we

27:39.920 --> 27:41.460
have to do it?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
Let me get an important.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.500
Oh, sorry.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.500
Don't want to cut you off.

27:44.500 --> 27:48.780
Uh, the one other thing I was saying, you know how I mentioned the medical industry.

27:48.780 --> 27:55.460
Do you know that it takes us sometimes up to seven years longer for heart conditions

27:55.460 --> 27:57.900
to be diagnosed?

27:57.900 --> 28:02.420
And I'm pretty sure that's what happened with Dan's mom, that she would be alive if they

28:02.420 --> 28:09.700
believed her, that she was worried about her heart that we did get the notice that it was

28:09.700 --> 28:10.700
a heart condition.

28:10.940 --> 28:13.740
And that's a big issue in the medical industry for sure.

28:13.740 --> 28:19.180
Is that doctors, you know, kind of, um, a lot of times we'll put a stamp on a certain

28:19.180 --> 28:22.020
set of conditions and they don't necessarily listen to the patient.

28:22.020 --> 28:23.780
I know that's a huge, huge issue.

28:23.780 --> 28:29.500
Um, I do want, sorry if, if I just one little thing, just people, if you want to really

28:29.500 --> 28:34.780
look up how bad women have it, look up endometriosis diagnoses and that's it.

28:34.780 --> 28:38.100
Let me get this comment in our chat from quest buster, because I think this is very important

28:38.100 --> 28:44.340
when we talk about how can twitch do a better job and I say twitch, uh, and like Jamie said,

28:44.340 --> 28:49.540
meaning all forums and stuff, but quest buster says there's a twitch executive that has also

28:49.540 --> 28:54.900
had allegations leveled against him and that person is in charge of partnerships, which

28:54.900 --> 29:00.780
for some isn't surprising considering their past behavior when it comes to selective bands.

29:00.780 --> 29:04.880
And obviously that's a huge issue if you know, the call is coming from inside the house,

29:04.880 --> 29:08.360
so to speak, that's a huge issue that twitch has to deal with.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.840
And there's also a part of the trash.

29:09.840 --> 29:10.840
Yeah.

29:10.840 --> 29:15.520
And, but there's also a part of me that's like, how does one person within twitch carry

29:15.520 --> 29:22.480
so much power over partnerships that if this guy didn't have that kind of power, he wouldn't

29:22.480 --> 29:27.320
be able to leverage it against people with these alleged, you know, issues that are going

29:27.320 --> 29:28.320
on.

29:28.320 --> 29:33.240
Um, so I kind of think that's also an issue is that there shouldn't one person should

29:33.240 --> 29:37.400
not be left to dictate and maybe it, maybe, maybe it doesn't really work that way, but

29:37.400 --> 29:42.560
it definitely seems like this individual again, if these allegations are true, cause legally

29:42.560 --> 29:49.400
I have to say that, um, and so forth, where, where did this person get all that power?

29:49.400 --> 29:51.560
Why are all this a, why are all those eggs in this basket?

29:51.560 --> 29:56.560
And I think that's something twitch needs to look at is the division of power within

29:56.560 --> 30:03.720
the organization and making sure that there is a decent amount of women in power, minorities

30:03.720 --> 30:04.720
in power.

30:04.720 --> 30:11.280
And to be fair, I believe, um, the, uh, person, uh, getting the complaints is, is, um, is

30:11.280 --> 30:13.960
a minority, but it doesn't, it doesn't like matter.

30:13.960 --> 30:14.960
You know what I mean?

30:14.960 --> 30:19.240
They still need to have representation across the board in different positions of power,

30:19.240 --> 30:20.240
if that makes sense.

30:20.240 --> 30:25.000
Well, and to, to bring attention to what Bobby just said in chat, um, he said, and the sad

30:25.000 --> 30:28.840
part is that it could be any man before you, not all men this.

30:28.840 --> 30:34.200
And that is really the thing that actually is going to go back to, I think even with

30:34.200 --> 30:38.680
the police thing too, you know, the, the, the all cops are bastards thing.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.920
The problem is, is that there are enough.

30:41.920 --> 30:48.400
That means we can't trust any until, you know, we know them and the proof has been laid bare

30:48.400 --> 30:50.680
and we know that this is a trustworthy person.

30:50.680 --> 30:57.360
And even then there are people out there who are complete predators who will lean in,

30:57.360 --> 30:59.600
you know, try to be the gentleman.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
And then they turn around.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Well, I'm a nice guy.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
You owe me.

31:02.600 --> 31:10.880
So even, even then, you know, so before anyone says like the not all men thing, it's enough.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.640
It is enough to make us trust none of you.

31:13.640 --> 31:20.200
Um, Bobby in chat says, well, actually let me, let me follow that up in just a minute.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.000
Bobby says, well, it's great that I know I'm not a creep.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.320
I give off the creep vibe.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.760
If someone just looks at me at a gaming event, I don't expect any woman to trust me at a

31:27.760 --> 31:28.760
gaming event.

31:28.760 --> 31:32.240
I mean, I have long hair, goatee, heavyset, I fit the profile.

31:32.240 --> 31:35.600
Bobby's a great guy for what it's worth, but I understand what he's saying.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.280
And like you say, dark soccer, you trust me, but, um, here's the thing.

31:39.280 --> 31:43.120
So like, you know, I love to go out and play like Pokemon go and ingress and Orna and all

31:43.120 --> 31:44.760
these location based games of the park.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.760
Right?

31:45.760 --> 31:49.200
Well, just recently I was at a park and I was walking around farming and ingress and

31:49.200 --> 31:52.160
you know, that involves, I'm staring at my phone, I'm doing this thing.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.800
This woman at the park thought I was taking pictures of her and she's like, can you not

31:55.800 --> 31:57.800
point that at me?

31:57.800 --> 32:02.240
And while there was a part of me that wanted to clap back and be like, don't flatter yourself.

32:02.240 --> 32:06.640
There is also that part of me that's like, let it go.

32:06.640 --> 32:10.600
She's obviously got something going on that you don't know about.

32:10.600 --> 32:16.040
So I just kind of like turned so my back was to her and kind of, you know, kept doing my

32:16.040 --> 32:17.840
thing a different direction.

32:17.840 --> 32:23.320
So and unfortunately, you know, playing the location based games I got in even just yesterday,

32:23.320 --> 32:27.140
just yesterday, somebody was, it wasn't quite the same situation, but somebody was like,

32:27.140 --> 32:29.200
are you taking pictures of that car?

32:29.200 --> 32:30.280
What is, is that your car?

32:30.280 --> 32:35.200
And I was like, no, I'm playing a game and she was like, Oh, okay.

32:35.200 --> 32:39.360
You know, I kind of like tilted my phone enough so that you could see the ingress screen and

32:39.360 --> 32:41.520
I don't expect that to make sense to anybody.

32:41.520 --> 32:47.100
But you know, so my point is, and I am kind of like tying this to games in a way is that,

32:47.100 --> 32:54.480
you know, I have to remember that not everybody is going to think I have the best intentions.

32:54.480 --> 32:58.100
I have to kind of earn that, if that makes sense.

32:58.100 --> 33:05.900
And the other thing too, is that, gosh, I just lost my train of thought on that one.

33:05.900 --> 33:14.940
It's that we, that women, you know, and anybody who is in, I'm going to go ahead and say a

33:14.940 --> 33:21.580
marginalized group has to do extra to watch our asses.

33:21.580 --> 33:27.600
You know, if I'm going out to say, check the mail, I have my keys in my hand.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.560
Like I'm going to stab a bitch.

33:29.560 --> 33:35.380
You know, if I'm walking out to my car when I am, you know, in midtown, even in sister

33:35.380 --> 33:41.400
face, you know, going out and doing ministry, I still have one of my sisters with me to

33:41.400 --> 33:46.480
walk to the car, even though not many people, you know, have had pretty good responses.

33:46.480 --> 33:54.120
Everyone's like, oh, hey sister, hey, I still do not go alone.

33:54.120 --> 33:58.660
I think conventions need to have, and to be fair, like a lot of them do have a policy,

33:58.660 --> 34:00.880
although it's not always well known.

34:00.880 --> 34:04.740
And so it needs to be something that's like easily accessible and easily understandable.

34:04.740 --> 34:08.520
There should definitely be policies at conventions for people to do not feel safe, like how they

34:08.520 --> 34:12.200
can report that they feel like they're in an unsafe position and somebody with con

34:12.200 --> 34:15.680
security or something can either like escort them to a car or to a hotel or whatever it

34:15.680 --> 34:18.920
is that they need, you know, and sometimes that kind of stuff is like an afterthought

34:18.920 --> 34:22.280
like that, that number or that procedure should be like on the back of the badge.

34:22.280 --> 34:27.200
And again, some cons do have that, like, you know, one of the ones I was working with had

34:27.200 --> 34:29.240
it actually built into policies now.

34:29.240 --> 34:30.240
Cool.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.240
But that should be the standard.

34:31.240 --> 34:32.240
Right?

34:32.240 --> 34:33.240
Yeah, it should be.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.520
And E3 didn't have that.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.640
And it's at least in the years we went and maybe they've changed it since then.

34:38.640 --> 34:39.840
I haven't been in many years.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.160
And that is something that, you know, industry shows and industry actors need to have as

34:43.160 --> 34:44.160
well, you know?

34:44.160 --> 34:51.280
Well, and the thing is, and, you know, back when we were doing E3, you know, you know

34:51.280 --> 35:00.320
me, I go into pure con mode and I wander off by myself, but I also have this kind of weave

35:00.320 --> 35:03.320
that I do in crowds, you know?

35:03.320 --> 35:07.960
And like, if I am, you know, a lot of times when I was out doing cosplay, I would have

35:07.960 --> 35:15.080
a very large prop with me because it's damn hard to miss a fan that's as big as I am.

35:15.080 --> 35:20.000
And it's damn hard to miss big black wings walking around through, you know, a crowded

35:20.000 --> 35:27.880
hall or are wearing like six inch platform heels that I could, you know, kick somebody

35:27.880 --> 35:30.120
to death with if I chose to.

35:30.120 --> 35:36.040
You know, I, when I do, even in choosing like my cosplay for going to conventions, I try

35:36.040 --> 35:42.400
to pick something that I can use as a weapon or I can use to defend myself because I like

35:42.400 --> 35:43.720
to go by myself.

35:43.720 --> 35:44.720
Yeah.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.720
I didn't need somebody to protect me.

35:46.720 --> 35:51.400
SSG100 Matt in chat says, my girlfriend gets harassed in public, including in gaming.

35:51.400 --> 35:55.940
Men often feel the need to test her gaming knowledge or flex their superiority to her.

35:55.940 --> 36:00.100
She handles it well, but it's frustrating that happens to her and many others.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.100
You know what?

36:01.100 --> 36:02.100
You bring up an excellent point, Matt.

36:02.100 --> 36:07.780
And that is that we like it is, it is the year 2020 and we all need to make an agreement.

36:07.780 --> 36:10.880
I think it's going to be a very easy thing for the, for our hosts and our listeners to

36:10.880 --> 36:11.880
all agree to.

36:11.880 --> 36:15.580
Um, I think this will be very easy and I'm not sure we're the ones that necessarily need

36:15.580 --> 36:19.440
to change our mindset, but can we, can we kind of start a wave here and get the people

36:19.440 --> 36:20.440
we know to do this?

36:20.440 --> 36:26.340
And this is simply, can we just accept that everyone plays video games and everyone can

36:26.340 --> 36:32.480
play video games and video games are fun for everyone and everyone should be able to enjoy

36:32.480 --> 36:38.360
video games and everyone is going to like video games at different levels of enthusiasm,

36:38.360 --> 36:42.320
meaning not everybody's going to know the name of every single monster in the legend

36:42.320 --> 36:43.320
of Zelda.

36:43.320 --> 36:44.320
And that's fine.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.320
That doesn't mean they're not a gamer.

36:45.320 --> 36:48.160
And some people do know the names of every monster in the legend of Zelda.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.160
And that's fine too.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.100
They're not a nerd or a basement dweller.

36:51.100 --> 36:56.080
They just like games the way that another person might be able to name the baseball

36:56.080 --> 36:59.080
roster for the New York Yankees in the year 2004.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.080
Right?

37:00.080 --> 37:01.080
Yeah.

37:01.080 --> 37:06.360
Everybody has their different passions and enthusiasms and so forth and we need to respect

37:06.360 --> 37:07.360
fandoms.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.360
Yeah.

37:08.360 --> 37:16.320
And I, I even, you know, I'll, I'll even cause I do get the, Oh, prove it thing, you know,

37:16.320 --> 37:17.320
whatever.

37:17.320 --> 37:22.400
I mean, thankfully I've got the podcaster, I'm like, um, look me up on this.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
That's all I have to say.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.400
Google me, bitch.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.400
Google me, bitch.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.400
Right.

37:26.400 --> 37:32.120
But you know, the other, the other thing is that, you know, I've just flat out saying,

37:32.120 --> 37:33.840
I don't have shit to prove to you.

37:33.840 --> 37:34.840
I know myself.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.840
Fuck you.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
That's all I say.

37:36.840 --> 37:41.840
Or, you know, if I really feel like proving it, I'm like, name a video game system.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.240
I'll tell you if I have it.

37:44.240 --> 37:47.640
And you know, and I used to, you know, funny enough to kind of bring this full circle with

37:47.640 --> 37:51.840
the, the 18 years of OLR thing, I used to complain about this a lot in the earlier days

37:51.840 --> 37:57.360
of OLR was the judgment I would get as a gay dude because I played video games and it was

37:57.360 --> 37:58.360
like, Oh, what?

37:58.360 --> 38:03.520
You don't follow fashion or listen to Madonna or, you know, and I, I, I am absolutely stereotyping

38:03.520 --> 38:06.860
here, but these types of things like what happened is that it was like, Oh, you play

38:06.860 --> 38:07.860
video games.

38:07.860 --> 38:11.880
Isn't that like what, like, you know, basement boys do type of thing.

38:11.880 --> 38:18.440
And so, you know, that now, luckily in the years that we've been doing this show, I kind

38:18.440 --> 38:25.200
of feel like gay nerds and gamers like that has really like, there's a lot of gay guys

38:25.200 --> 38:27.720
that play video games and that's very much accepted now.

38:27.720 --> 38:31.600
Like I don't feel the same way now in 2020 that I probably did in the earlier days of

38:31.600 --> 38:32.600
this show.

38:32.600 --> 38:36.840
But you know, what age of the gamer, well, you know, what helped a lot with that was

38:36.840 --> 38:41.840
having a place like where we had gamer X and the, like, if I could point out, when did

38:41.840 --> 38:44.360
things feel like they started to turn around?

38:44.360 --> 38:48.480
Oh, when there was a convention for people like me, that was a big one.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.480
Yeah.

38:49.480 --> 38:50.480
Yeah.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.480
Matt Khan, you hear us bring it back.

38:51.480 --> 38:55.720
Well, he's, there was, I don't think he'll be bringing it back yet.

38:55.720 --> 38:59.960
But the organization, yes.

38:59.960 --> 39:05.120
And obviously not in the age of COVID either, but at some point, you know, hopefully we

39:05.120 --> 39:06.960
do see a convention like that.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.160
Well, there is that flame con that happens in New York.

39:09.160 --> 39:13.560
I think that's a little more, it's more like a gay nerd con than just game gay games, but

39:13.560 --> 39:15.960
I would love to go to that at some point.

39:15.960 --> 39:19.960
And you know, the, the bar that people were going to, that we were just poo pooing earlier

39:19.960 --> 39:21.480
about people going there.

39:21.480 --> 39:29.680
Um, I actually am doing a flyers and advertisement for their classic game, uh, Friday one month,

39:29.680 --> 39:30.680
which I love.

39:30.680 --> 39:34.680
Cause the one time I went, Jamie, it was really sad, but I'm, I'm glad to hear they're stepping

39:34.680 --> 39:35.680
their game up.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.720
Yeah, no, they, they, they're really trained to, to make it better.

39:39.720 --> 39:43.520
And, you know, I said that, you know, I can't, of course can't do it now, but I was like,

39:43.520 --> 39:44.520
I'll bring the turbo graphics.

39:44.520 --> 39:45.520
We'll bring a TV.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
It'll be cool.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.520
Yeah.

39:47.520 --> 39:51.680
You know, and, but I've been doing the, the flyers and everything for that once it comes

39:51.680 --> 39:52.680
out.

39:52.680 --> 39:57.160
Um, of course that all really got put to the sidelines, but I'm, I'm really good friends

39:57.160 --> 39:58.520
with the person that runs that.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.520
Cool.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.520
Well, I hope to see that improve.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.520
Anyway.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.720
Um, I know this is a big topic and we probably need to spend more time on it, but I think

40:04.760 --> 40:05.760
you still have a seven 30 cutoff.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.760
Right.

40:06.760 --> 40:07.760
Jamie.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.760
So I probably need to keep it.

40:08.760 --> 40:09.760
But I can budget a little bit.

40:09.760 --> 40:10.760
Okay.

40:10.760 --> 40:14.000
Well, let's, let's go ahead and move forward with the show, um, as we have other things

40:14.000 --> 40:19.760
to discuss, but I'm sure this topic that was just under discussion, uh, will unfortunately

40:19.760 --> 40:25.780
come up again, but it's one of those things where I hope we can learn, you know, as a

40:25.780 --> 40:30.700
group to do better through these things, you know, like dark Sakura said, believe women,

40:30.700 --> 40:36.380
like I said, respect fandoms and you know, the, everybody plays video games and so forth.

40:36.380 --> 40:42.460
And I think once these types of attitudes start to really become, they spread and they

40:42.460 --> 40:47.660
become out there, I think those will be the first steps into creating a better environment

40:47.660 --> 40:48.660
for games.

40:48.660 --> 40:49.660
That makes sense.

40:49.660 --> 40:50.660
So agreed.

40:50.660 --> 40:51.660
All right.

40:51.660 --> 40:55.460
Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks since we are gamers, what were the types

40:55.460 --> 40:57.580
of video games that we were playing this week?

40:57.580 --> 40:59.620
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

40:59.660 --> 41:03.940
I have been playing, of course, a lot of animal crossing because it's easy.

41:03.940 --> 41:11.300
Um, and I've also been, I finally, I actually beat every new puzzle on patterned again.

41:11.300 --> 41:15.700
Um, which I love that game is so relaxing is so chill.

41:15.700 --> 41:20.700
Um, so that's really been the big two.

41:20.700 --> 41:26.420
Um, and I actually, I started playing words with friends too, which I blame, uh, Samantha

41:26.420 --> 41:30.180
of, um, stuff mom never told you podcast.

41:30.180 --> 41:35.340
Um, I, I know I just, I have been a, the message and say, Hey, I haven't played words with

41:35.340 --> 41:36.340
friends in a while.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.340
So I play with me.

41:37.340 --> 41:38.340
I'm like, okay, I will.

41:38.340 --> 41:39.340
She's cool.

41:39.340 --> 41:43.860
Um, so I, I'm now playing words with friends too again, so it's pretty fun, uh, make my

41:43.860 --> 41:47.100
brain work and that's about it.

41:47.100 --> 41:48.100
That's about it.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.260
Um, you know, I like my stuff.

41:50.260 --> 41:55.100
I made an alt and animal crossing Dan and I both did so that we can make, pay off all

41:55.100 --> 42:00.340
of those houses and make like shopping centers in a house.

42:00.340 --> 42:01.340
Nice.

42:01.340 --> 42:02.340
All right.

42:02.340 --> 42:03.340
My audio got out of sync a little bit.

42:03.340 --> 42:04.340
Sorry.

42:04.340 --> 42:15.340
Uh, because he didn't name his character, his name, no, but yeah, that's it.

42:15.340 --> 42:20.460
All right, let me go to Loki and there might be a quick, I'm actually gonna just try to

42:20.460 --> 42:23.900
fix my discord issues, but Loki, if you wouldn't mind talking about your gaming week here while

42:23.900 --> 42:25.660
I try to fix some stuff on my end.

42:25.660 --> 42:26.660
Sure.

42:26.660 --> 42:29.700
So I, it was pretty much all Minecraft this week.

42:29.700 --> 42:34.700
So there was the brand new, um, another update that came out.

42:34.700 --> 42:40.460
Uh, so it was, uh, that was out on Tuesday.

42:40.460 --> 42:45.420
So I've been, uh, you know, checking out that and working on our realm and doing that kind

42:45.420 --> 42:46.940
of stuff.

42:46.940 --> 42:55.660
And then, um, outside of that, I was also playing some, um, uh, Orna of course.

42:55.660 --> 42:57.860
And then that's pretty much it.

42:57.860 --> 43:00.820
Watch my kids been playing, um, animal crossing.

43:00.820 --> 43:01.820
They've been really good.

43:01.820 --> 43:09.340
Well, my son's been really getting into that, but it's been mainly just, um, just Minecraft

43:09.340 --> 43:10.340
for the most part.

43:10.340 --> 43:11.340
All right.

43:11.340 --> 43:16.540
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, which I only heard half of, sorry, but I think I

43:16.540 --> 43:18.020
fixed my issues.

43:18.020 --> 43:20.780
Um, I will talk about my gaming week.

43:20.780 --> 43:21.780
All right.

43:21.780 --> 43:22.780
Yeah.

43:22.780 --> 43:23.780
I've got issues.

43:23.780 --> 43:24.780
I has them.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.780
Uh, my gaming week, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff I usually do.

43:26.780 --> 43:30.140
My location games that I love my ingress, my Pokemon go, my Orna.

43:30.140 --> 43:33.780
I've been playing all those games, uh, but I've been playing stuff on a console and PC

43:33.780 --> 43:37.140
as well, including continued adventures and final fantasy 14.

43:37.140 --> 43:43.740
I almost have completed the fate grind, which means the, uh, a fate is a world quest event

43:43.740 --> 43:45.780
basically that happens in a zone.

43:45.780 --> 43:48.300
And in the latest expansion, you can get a reward.

43:48.300 --> 43:52.740
If you do like, I think it's like 70 fates in every zone and we're working on the last

43:52.740 --> 43:53.740
zone right now.

43:53.740 --> 43:54.740
So that's very exciting.

43:54.740 --> 43:55.740
I'm making progress on that.

43:55.740 --> 43:59.580
Um, so a lot of the same old games, but I did play a new game this week.

43:59.580 --> 44:02.220
Uh, it just hit game pass not that long ago.

44:02.220 --> 44:08.420
Uh, so on Xbox one, I've been playing the messenger, which is a, uh, it's definitely

44:08.420 --> 44:11.820
inspired by Ninja Gaiden, uh, from back in the day.

44:11.820 --> 44:13.540
It's very heavily inspired.

44:13.540 --> 44:18.020
And what I like about it is that it kind of winks and nods to the game that inspired

44:18.020 --> 44:20.540
it, uh, quite constantly.

44:20.540 --> 44:21.780
And I think that's really cool.

44:21.780 --> 44:26.140
Uh, it has that kind of retro look to it, but the game is it's, you know, obviously

44:26.140 --> 44:30.060
wide screen, uh, and the, the graphics do feel like a little bit amped up, even though

44:30.060 --> 44:33.540
it has that retro look, I love that it's very tongue in cheek.

44:33.540 --> 44:41.340
Um, it doesn't have quite the same cinematic story, uh, that Ninja Gaiden had, but I think,

44:41.340 --> 44:47.860
uh, this story instead kind of like is a little more tongue in cheek and a little more silly

44:47.860 --> 44:51.500
and a little more self referencing, but I think that's kind of cool.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.820
And the gameplay is really fun.

44:52.820 --> 44:56.780
Like it really kind of feels like you're playing, you know, the old Ninja Gaiden game.

44:56.780 --> 45:02.260
So, you know, right in the beginning you can do like a double jump if you hit like a lantern

45:02.260 --> 45:03.260
that's in the air.

45:03.260 --> 45:05.340
So you jump, hit the lantern, you can jump again.

45:05.340 --> 45:08.420
And so that leads to kind of some interesting mechanics and there's, there's things that

45:08.420 --> 45:10.380
weren't in the game that inspired it.

45:10.420 --> 45:15.540
There's things like swimming and there's this whole like death mechanic that you get your,

45:15.540 --> 45:20.420
uh, life back, but the little demon will take souls from you and things like that.

45:20.420 --> 45:21.660
So it's, it's fun.

45:21.660 --> 45:22.660
It's cute.

45:22.660 --> 45:25.580
And, uh, the nice thing with game pass, it didn't cost me anything extra.

45:25.580 --> 45:26.940
So I've been able to check that out.

45:26.940 --> 45:29.180
So if you have game pass, I would recommend that for sure.

45:29.180 --> 45:32.340
Cause I think that has been a fun game.

45:32.340 --> 45:34.500
So that's been between that.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.500
Yeah.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.500
That's pretty much my gaming week.

45:36.500 --> 45:39.820
So, all right, well, let's move on and get into some things that have been happening

45:40.260 --> 45:44.380
in the news and this is, this is a whopper starting us off tonight.

45:44.380 --> 45:45.380
Loki.

45:45.380 --> 45:46.380
Yeah.

45:46.380 --> 45:50.300
It's, uh, it's something.

45:50.300 --> 45:57.180
So there was a surprise announcement that, um, Microsoft made, I think on Twitter even,

45:57.180 --> 46:03.900
and it was that, Hey, uh, mixer is shutting down as of July 22nd and they are partnering

46:03.900 --> 46:06.260
with Facebook gaming moving forward.

46:06.260 --> 46:12.460
So if you happen to be a partner status in mixer, that'll transfer over to Facebook gaming,

46:12.460 --> 46:14.300
assuming that you sign up over there.

46:14.300 --> 46:19.140
Um, they're basically matching all existing partner agreements as closely as possible.

46:19.140 --> 46:27.900
Uh, Ew, for one, um, triple Ew.

46:27.900 --> 46:29.140
I need a new graph.

46:29.140 --> 46:32.340
You know, while we've got new graphic and sound effects, I need one for that triple

46:32.340 --> 46:36.060
Ew.

46:36.060 --> 46:41.780
So yeah, so that, that sucks for everybody that jumped in on a mixer and stuff.

46:41.780 --> 46:44.140
I mean, I know they're pimping the hell out of that.

46:44.140 --> 46:50.180
Even like, uh, when we used to go to GameStop months ago, uh, they would have on their games

46:50.180 --> 46:56.140
or their little Microsoft kiosk, whatever, just be pimping out mixer all the time.

46:56.140 --> 46:58.140
And now that's just, it's, it's gone.

46:58.140 --> 47:04.660
So I'm unfortunate for a lot of folks that were dedicating themselves to that platform.

47:04.660 --> 47:08.620
Not sure if anyone's really getting jumped ship to Facebook gaming.

47:08.620 --> 47:10.940
Um, like, I don't know.

47:10.940 --> 47:12.260
It's that's, that's tough.

47:12.260 --> 47:17.020
And I want to say like, I, there's a few streamers that I watch on like YouTube and stuff like

47:17.020 --> 47:21.180
one, one in particular, Ali 43, but I think tried the Facebook gaming stuff.

47:21.180 --> 47:27.140
And I want to say that the issue there was either it was hard to monetize the streams

47:27.140 --> 47:32.300
or it was hard to discoverability was a problem, uh, just the way it's set up.

47:32.340 --> 47:37.500
I don't know what their issues are over there, but you not going to know.

47:37.500 --> 47:44.260
Um, so I'm thinking a lot of folks will go back to Twitch probably, or YouTube, um, streaming.

47:44.260 --> 47:47.540
Like, but yeah, they had a lot of features that sounded really cool.

47:47.540 --> 47:52.340
Um, I'm curious now, like I know they had mixer integration for like Minecraft and stuff.

47:52.340 --> 47:54.340
So now that's going to be broken.

47:54.340 --> 47:56.140
So I don't know.

47:56.140 --> 48:00.620
I'm going to be very candid on something here and just say, um, what I think many of us

48:00.620 --> 48:03.420
are thinking, and that is that Facebook gaming fucking sucks.

48:03.420 --> 48:09.140
And um, there's, it, it really does feel like, like a one, two punch in the face for mixer

48:09.140 --> 48:13.380
to be folding into Facebook gaming because Facebook gaming is so fucking terrible.

48:13.380 --> 48:19.300
Um, and I, again, I am here to support all broadcasters and all indie people.

48:19.300 --> 48:22.540
And if you are a person that streams on Facebook gaming, I'm sorry.

48:22.540 --> 48:26.860
If what I'm saying right now feels offensive, my issues are not to the streamers there.

48:26.860 --> 48:28.820
My issues are with the platform.

48:28.820 --> 48:34.100
Facebook as a platform has no business getting into this gaming arena.

48:34.100 --> 48:39.760
And one of the biggest sticking points I have with Facebook gaming, despite, in addition

48:39.760 --> 48:45.180
to the fact that the layout sucks for it, the discoverability sucks for it, the monetization

48:45.180 --> 48:46.180
sucks for it.

48:46.180 --> 48:50.660
The way that you try to find things and stuff you want to watch on it sucks for it.

48:50.660 --> 48:54.880
All those things aside, the thing that really ticks me off about Facebook gaming is Facebook's

48:54.880 --> 48:57.060
real name policy.

48:57.140 --> 49:00.900
What did we just fucking talk about?

49:00.900 --> 49:06.880
What was the topic that was just under discussion on this program?

49:06.880 --> 49:13.000
And Facebook wants to mandate that everybody should use their real names.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.460
I don't fucking think so.

49:15.460 --> 49:21.460
Like it just goes to show that Facebook has no fucking idea what they're getting into.

49:21.460 --> 49:24.780
And I understand Facebook has a lot of viewers.

49:24.780 --> 49:29.820
They had more viewers than Mixer because Facebook is a monopoly.

49:29.820 --> 49:35.500
There should be antitrust movements against Facebook because they have their hands in

49:35.500 --> 49:37.820
so many cookie jars.

49:37.820 --> 49:43.580
It's so easy for them to insert and inject the Facebook gaming stuff into your feed when

49:43.580 --> 49:45.420
I don't want it.

49:45.420 --> 49:46.420
Sorry.

49:46.420 --> 49:49.540
I just, I know I'm ranty, but I agree.

49:49.540 --> 49:53.900
I really don't like Facebook getting into this space.

49:53.900 --> 49:59.160
And I agree, like I, there's like no, nothing I would watch on there.

49:59.160 --> 50:03.580
Like I would not go there ever for any sort of content whatsoever.

50:03.580 --> 50:09.000
Even if I would not stream it on a train, I would not stream it on a plane.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.460
I would not watch it on the bus.

50:13.460 --> 50:15.980
I would not watch any of us.

50:15.980 --> 50:20.180
Like that's, it's not, I'm not getting on Facebook gaming and you can clip fine, clip

50:20.180 --> 50:21.460
it, save it as a receipt.

50:21.460 --> 50:25.460
I will quit broadcasting before I stream on Facebook gaming trust.

50:25.460 --> 50:28.900
I know you're not supposed to burn your bridges in this industry.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.580
I have no problem setting that one on fire.

50:30.580 --> 50:31.580
Sorry.

50:31.580 --> 50:37.340
So, so, so far of the big names that were on, um, Mixer, some of the big names, uh,

50:37.340 --> 50:39.500
Ninja and shroud are moving back to Twitch.

50:39.500 --> 50:45.980
Uh, there is one though, um, King, uh, Gothio, the Goth lion or something.

50:45.980 --> 50:53.060
Um, he is going to be moving to Facebook, but I don't know.

50:53.060 --> 50:56.900
And to be clear, and since I've been kind of a bitch, my heart really does go out to

50:56.900 --> 50:59.900
the folks on Mixer that were impacted by this.

50:59.900 --> 51:04.500
And like, you know what, not everybody necessarily knows this, but I'll be very transparent.

51:04.500 --> 51:11.280
Uh, when we were looking to relocate VOG network off of shout cast and move to a video platform,

51:11.280 --> 51:14.080
Mixer was under heavy consideration.

51:14.080 --> 51:18.560
And one of the reasons why Mixer at the time was appealing was because it was like, Oh,

51:18.560 --> 51:22.320
in twit on Twitch, there's like a lot of, lot of noise.

51:22.320 --> 51:26.620
And on Mixer, what used to be beam pro at the time, there is the potential to maybe

51:26.620 --> 51:31.000
do something that is, uh, able to get found out a little easier through that noise, because

51:31.000 --> 51:35.480
there weren't a lot of podcasters, there was a few, but there weren't a lot of podcasters

51:35.480 --> 51:39.760
and folks that were doing their thing on Mixer at the time that that topic was under discussion.

51:39.760 --> 51:44.400
And I really liked the concept of the, um, what were they called over there?

51:44.400 --> 51:49.040
The, the sparks or something like, as you watch to feed you, which Twitch ended up integrating,

51:49.040 --> 51:52.660
uh, a system that's very similar, but at the time it was exclusive to Mixer.

51:52.660 --> 51:53.660
And I really liked that.

51:53.660 --> 51:58.520
And I kind of thought that went with the theme of participation and so forth, but what really

51:58.520 --> 52:04.600
ended up swaying the deal the other way was that it was too hard to become a Mixer partner.

52:04.600 --> 52:09.460
And at the end of the day, I think that was Mixer's biggest weakness versus Twitch.

52:09.460 --> 52:15.120
And I appreciate Mixer existing to give Twitch some real competition because I'm sorry, Facebook

52:15.120 --> 52:16.860
gaming is not real competition.

52:16.860 --> 52:22.860
Um, Steam, like literally it's, did you know, Steam has a whole broadcasting thing and like

52:22.860 --> 52:29.260
all it really was this flute, we, we just, we threw it out there and now we're just letting

52:29.260 --> 52:33.980
the vultures eat it because we're like, Steam literally is doing nothing to curate or grow

52:33.980 --> 52:34.980
that platform.

52:34.980 --> 52:39.540
And it's like, we made this and now let's do, let's not make Half-Life 3.

52:39.540 --> 52:44.120
And I don't think you can monetize anything on there either, but, um, so Mixer, they had

52:44.120 --> 52:49.540
an article in the Mixer blog, they basically talked about why they kind of went this route.

52:49.540 --> 52:53.400
So they said, ultimately the success of our partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent

52:53.400 --> 52:58.020
on our ability to scale the platform for them quickly and as broadly as possible, it became

52:58.020 --> 53:02.500
clear that the time needed to grow our own live streaming community to scale was out

53:02.500 --> 53:06.740
of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox wants to deliver to

53:06.740 --> 53:07.740
gamers now.

53:07.740 --> 53:12.620
So we decided to close operations, um, we didn't want to do it anymore.

53:12.620 --> 53:13.620
Yes.

53:13.620 --> 53:15.300
So, but here's, here's the writing on the wall here.

53:15.300 --> 53:19.620
So it says, you know, we're teaming up with Facebook to enable Mixer community transition

53:19.620 --> 53:20.620
to Facebook gaming.

53:20.620 --> 53:25.760
This is a key part of our broader effort that Xbox and Facebook gaming are embarking on.

53:25.760 --> 53:30.940
So this leads me to believe that all these integrations that we have with Mixer and stuff

53:30.940 --> 53:34.140
are going to now be integrations with Facebook gaming.

53:34.140 --> 53:37.380
But I mean, that sucks, I guess.

53:37.380 --> 53:41.200
But at the same time, if it's not popular, they're not going to support it.

53:41.200 --> 53:45.080
So we'll see, just don't use the platform and it'll go away.

53:45.080 --> 53:48.180
Facebook gaming can kiss my fat fucking ass.

53:48.180 --> 53:53.220
And if the Xbox series X is going to rely on Facebook integration and it's going to,

53:53.220 --> 53:57.700
it is seriously going to potentially impact my decision to get an Xbox series X, that

53:57.700 --> 54:02.140
is how much I want to separate myself from Facebook and especially not get into this

54:02.140 --> 54:03.140
gaming space.

54:03.140 --> 54:08.060
I think it'll be optional, just like the integrations with like, um, Mixer and stuff.

54:08.060 --> 54:12.780
And I think what will happen is, is if it isn't taking off like they thought it would,

54:12.780 --> 54:15.900
and I'm sure there's some money changing hands, partnerships and whatnot.

54:15.900 --> 54:17.720
So there's going to be some of the integration.

54:17.720 --> 54:21.500
I'm sure that it's up to the developers on what they want to integrate with.

54:21.500 --> 54:24.100
A lot of them are going to be doing stuff with Twitch.

54:24.760 --> 54:31.300
I'm sure that just because maybe Microsoft studio games will decide to have some special

54:31.300 --> 54:35.940
integrations with Facebook gaming, that that's not necessarily going to close the door and

54:35.940 --> 54:42.360
other titles to integrate with, I say, Twitch or something else, or, you know, it's just,

54:42.360 --> 54:43.700
it's not a huge deal.

54:43.700 --> 54:49.720
Like, I don't know, you may see like a Facebook gaming app on the new Microsoft console, not

54:49.720 --> 54:50.720
the same.

54:50.720 --> 54:51.720
You won't see a Twitch app on there.

54:51.720 --> 54:57.560
Um, I don't know, I just, I don't see it being very popular.

54:57.560 --> 55:00.080
Let me get a couple of chat comments I think are worth responding to, because I think these

55:00.080 --> 55:01.720
are a couple of big, big points.

55:01.720 --> 55:06.640
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Ninja and shroud brought a lot of streamers to Mixer, but not

55:06.640 --> 55:07.640
a lot of viewers.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.920
And I agree that was mistake number one.

55:09.920 --> 55:14.340
And I'm not like throwing shade at these big streamers who I know work very hard to get

55:14.340 --> 55:15.960
the audiences that they have.

55:15.960 --> 55:21.800
But the reality is they are not a magic ticket to making the platform larger.

55:21.800 --> 55:26.540
It would have been smarter for Mixer to address the question, why aren't more people streaming

55:26.540 --> 55:27.960
here in the first place?

55:27.960 --> 55:32.520
And I done just told you the answer is that it was too much harder to monetize on Mixer

55:32.520 --> 55:34.480
than it was versus, versus Twitter.

55:34.480 --> 55:39.000
You could have had us Mixer, like lots of streaming failures that they're already having.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.340
So like, but there were, again, there were a lot of great things that Mixer kind of had,

55:43.340 --> 55:49.820
but I, if they had made it easier to get to that level of monetization and work, be really

55:49.820 --> 55:53.540
feeling like you're a part of the community, I don't think they would have needed to throw

55:53.540 --> 55:57.880
Ninja or shroud millions of dollars because they would have attracted smaller and mid-level

55:57.880 --> 55:58.880
streamers.

55:58.880 --> 56:01.880
And that would have been huge because then you get all that promotion on Twitter and

56:01.880 --> 56:02.880
all that other stuff.

56:02.880 --> 56:08.220
Now, Pele Hanumea in chat bringing up another excellent point is Kindle, Roku, and my Samsung

56:08.220 --> 56:10.220
TV don't have Mixer app.

56:10.220 --> 56:11.220
Bingo.

56:11.320 --> 56:15.220
Another big problem with it is that Twitch is available pretty much everywhere at this

56:15.220 --> 56:16.220
point.

56:16.220 --> 56:20.900
Uh, Mixer was available on PC and on Xbox, which is, you know, cool if you're streaming,

56:20.900 --> 56:22.660
you know, Xbox related content and stuff.

56:22.660 --> 56:28.500
And it was really well integrated into Windows 10, but beyond that, it's a lot harder to

56:28.500 --> 56:29.500
get on the Mixer.

56:29.500 --> 56:34.240
And I think Mixer really, not that Mixer necessarily needed to be on PlayStation, but it needed

56:34.240 --> 56:35.240
to be more places.

56:35.240 --> 56:38.100
The, the Switch was a huge untapped thing, sorry.

56:38.100 --> 56:44.780
And here's a kick in the balls for, um, for Mixer anyway, is that, um, the Twitch, uh,

56:44.780 --> 56:50.820
streaming app now, um, has a beta out for Mac.

56:50.820 --> 57:00.100
So yeah, they're, they're definitely embracing, um, many more non-Microsoft, uh, areas.

57:00.100 --> 57:04.100
I mean, while they were growing in numbers like Facebook gaming.

57:04.100 --> 57:07.340
So I was looking at some numbers from 2019.

57:07.340 --> 57:12.860
So at December, 2019, Facebook gaming had 8.5% of the market share.

57:12.860 --> 57:19.040
Whereas Twitch is 61%, uh, YouTube gaming, 27.9 and Mixer was 2.6.

57:19.040 --> 57:25.120
Whereas the previous year, 2018 Mixer was 2% and Facebook gaming was only 3.1.

57:25.120 --> 57:30.700
So it definitely, you know, they definitely are growing.

57:30.700 --> 57:32.060
Is that sustainable?

57:32.060 --> 57:34.900
Eh, I don't know.

57:34.900 --> 57:40.120
Um, but I don't see them like dominating the marketplace.

57:40.120 --> 57:45.660
I see them as sticking around for a while until it's not making them money enough.

57:45.660 --> 57:47.380
I see them as leeching it.

57:47.380 --> 57:50.760
I, I, I will miss Mixer for the competition.

57:50.760 --> 57:54.980
It was giving Twitch the healthy competition and I think it was forcing each other to innovate.

57:54.980 --> 58:00.760
Um, Facebook is innovating nothing, so I don't see, um, Twitch having to, uh, really respond

58:00.760 --> 58:01.760
in that regard.

58:01.760 --> 58:03.060
Um, so it will be interesting to see.

58:03.060 --> 58:06.700
I mean, I guess YouTube is now kind of the big competitor in that space with Twitch.

58:06.700 --> 58:11.500
It'll be interesting to see if maybe a Phoenix rises from the ashes and we get kind of like

58:11.500 --> 58:16.360
a beam pro 2.0 type of thing, uh, to, to compete.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.360
We'll see.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.360
I don't know.

58:18.360 --> 58:22.140
But my, again, my heart goes out to those that invested so much on the Mixer just to

58:22.140 --> 58:23.860
have the rug pulled out from under them.

58:23.860 --> 58:27.900
And it, it, I think it should make, I mean, between that and I don't think it's on the

58:27.900 --> 58:33.020
show role tonight, but we have the news about like the Microsoft stores are going away basically.

58:33.020 --> 58:38.500
And that's all changing to like, I can understand why people are kind of cautious of Microsoft

58:38.500 --> 58:39.500
in the moment.

58:39.500 --> 58:45.460
Um, and that's a real bummer because there's so much enthusiasm for what Microsoft's about

58:45.460 --> 58:49.940
to bring to the table through their cloud gaming and through the series X and through

58:49.940 --> 58:52.560
the studios that they've purchased and so forth.

58:52.560 --> 58:55.940
So maybe Microsoft sitting on a poker hand that they say, you know what, people are going

58:55.940 --> 58:59.000
to forget about these crappy things because this poker hand we're holding of all these

58:59.000 --> 59:03.080
things we're yet to announce is so good that we're cleaning things up before we kind of

59:03.080 --> 59:06.720
put our cards on the table, so to speak, but they think it is, or they think, yeah, they

59:06.720 --> 59:07.720
think it is.

59:07.720 --> 59:15.640
Um, I just, but my, I mean, real people were affected by this and it just, it really stinks.

59:15.640 --> 59:20.600
And I, I just feel businesses really care that real people are, of course, of course

59:20.600 --> 59:27.080
they don't, of course they don't know, but I think that's a wake up call to every streamer

59:27.080 --> 59:34.320
and no matter where you're broadcasting, that's it, end of sentence, that's the tweet, it

59:34.320 --> 59:36.360
should be a wake up call for everybody.

59:36.360 --> 59:43.520
Uh, the platform at the end of the day will sell you to Facebook if that's what they feel

59:43.520 --> 59:48.360
like they need to do to make the most money for their investors or the people that make

59:48.360 --> 59:49.360
the money off it.

59:49.360 --> 59:53.360
And isn't what now doing like a welcome back kind of thing?

59:53.360 --> 59:54.360
Yeah.

59:54.360 --> 59:58.040
I mean, Twitch is seeing the opportunity in it and they have to be snickering in some

59:58.040 --> 01:00:03.600
type of way that even though Mixer is like, you can do all of this and seamlessly integrate

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.920
to Facebook gaming.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:10.360
There are so many people that are like, you know what, I'd rather just go back to Twitch

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.260
even though I maybe burned my bridges over there.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:18.320
I'd still rather do that than Facebook gaming, which I obviously I'm thriving on that.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.480
It gives me such energy.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.480
Um, but yeah, so anyway.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.320
Well, good deal for like the folks that did take the money for Mixer because now they're

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.200
out of their contracts and they still get paid and then they still get to go back to

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.240
these platforms where they probably still have a lot of followers and stuff.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.520
Well and what a stupid decision then that all ended up being, wasn't it?

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.040
I hope some people are answering for that right now.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.160
Um, so for all the credit I've given Phil Spencer over the years, and I think he has

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.460
driven Microsoft in a much better or Xbox specifically, obviously in a better direction.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:52.680
So for this is quite the blemish.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.720
So that's all I have to say on that.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720
All right.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720
Just wait.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.240
We're only like months away from hearing Google announced that they're getting rid of Stadia

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240
too.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.240
All right.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240
Moving on.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.440
Do we really think that's going to happen though?

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.440
Oh yeah.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.440
It will definitely happen.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.120
That'll be one of those things we put in the time capsule for 2021.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.760
Did we even do a time capsule?

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.760
I don't think we did.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760
Did we?

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760
I thought we didn't.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760
Anyway.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760
I don't think I did.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760
Oh well.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760
I have no predictions.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.000
Honestly, could anyone have predicted the way this year would go?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Maybe it's for the best.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
We don't have anything.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Yeah.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
What happened to the murder hornets?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You know, now we have meth alligators.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.600
What happened to the murder hornets?

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600
They're on hold.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.680
I like how SSJ 100 math says, Oh, don't joke Loki.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.680
It's 2020.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.680
Yeah.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.280
Speaking of it's 2020, I saw a trailer today for a new movie called Greenland talking about

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.160
like an asteroid hitting earth.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.080
I'm like, now's not the time for those types of movies.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.000
Really like now's not the time to an earth disaster movie.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Sorry.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.880
I got sidetracked with something IRL.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.880
What were you saying?

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.120
Oh, I was just saying that, uh, there's this movie Greenland coming out.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.040
That's like your typical, uh, Roland Emmert disaster flick or whatever, no asteroids hitting

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.680
the earth and destroying everything.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.880
I was like, no, no, no.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.680
You want to know what is crazy is that I've been watching a lot more horror flicks lately.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.200
The psychological ones is like, I've watched the witch.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.080
I watched, uh, hereditary.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.840
I watched Midsommar, which I fucking love that movie.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.160
I've I watched, uh, a girl walks alone at night, which is a really good movie too.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.120
Just like I even re-watched like the house where evil dwells, which I actually liked

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120
that movie too.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:43.960
It's just like the, the scary stuff is preferable to reality.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:51.440
I would rather deal with, uh, you know, Japanese murder ghosts than this bullshit we're living

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.440
in right now.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:58.720
Um, Phoenix 77 26 in chat says, uh, the murder horn hornets saw the current situation and

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.200
felt pity on us.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.200
L L a S U and her mat says, yeah, we don't need a disaster movie right now.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.480
Hype mayhem says my July, 2020 prediction, oblivion gates open up everywhere.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.440
Um, yeah, so it's, it's, it's been a year living in a disaster movie.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.440
It's been a year.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.480
I mean, you know, it's bad when the rest of the world is quarantining against us.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.920
Or if Halloween gets canceled, y'all.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:29.280
If Halloween gets canceled, I know, I know, don't, don't buy candy at the store.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.360
Let me sit on this one tiny little glimmer.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:38.960
However, however, hopeless of hope that I have that maybe there can be a Halloween anyhow.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.880
All right, moving on.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.600
Oh, let's talk about crash bandicoot.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.640
I guess that's exciting.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:49.960
At least, at least 2020 will give us that finally, a new Chris, no, this looks really

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.960
cool actually.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.080
Now we already talked about this a little bit on last week's show because it spilled

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.680
early, but we got more details on crash bandicoot for it's about time.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.720
Uh, it was confirmed earlier this week by Activision being developed by toys for Bob.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:10.160
Um, it is sporting a new kind of, or kind of like the more HD remake crash style there.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.480
But otherwise the classic, uh, behind the back kind of over the shoulder platforming

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.160
that is going to be in the game, crashes in it, Coco cortex, all that stuff.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.420
Cortex has been banished to the past and he's now planning crashes doom.

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.160
So I like that they're doing this tongue in cheek thing there with this whole it's about

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.520
time when it's taken so long for there to be a new crash game.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.360
It's kind of like they're doing a play on words and it's super cute.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:42.160
Um, so anyhow, uh, they also in the trailer say they've only beaten cortex three times,

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.360
although they could swear that they were more.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.800
And so, um, they just kind of ignored all the other crash games that happened outside

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.940
the first three.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.720
So this is a true crash for games.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.080
So now, um, no games made by like traveler's tale or radical entertainment, that stuff

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.520
I'll count anymore.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:03.520
Anyhow crash four will be coming out October 2nd for PlayStation four and X-Box one, nothing

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.840
on the switch as of yet.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.760
Although I'm pretty sure Activision was asked about that.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.240
And they said something like, you know, if the, if the people want it or if the demand

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:17.800
is there, probably your typical non-answer answer, meaning it's not being made now, but

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.480
maybe later type of thing.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:24.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly that

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.200
dark soccer.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.200
What's next?

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.160
Well, um, I'm not super surprised by this at all because I kind of felt it was going

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.000
to happen the moment Nintendo said they were going to do some mobile games.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.040
Um, and yes, uh, pocket camp was fun for a hot minute.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:44.600
Um, but Nintendo is moving away from mobile gaming.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:53.560
Um, they had a really, really disappointing result, um, and they basically just ended it

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.560
all together.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.440
A president, um, Flutakada Shuntada was, um, you know, he was all down for it.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.760
He's like, it's going to be a big business, it's going to have growth and now, uh, no.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:09.120
So he basically said we are, and this is a quote, we are not necessarily looking to continue

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.040
releasing many new applications for the mobile market.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:22.640
And I mean, look at it right now though, um, it's, they've made so much with animal crossing.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.160
Um, they have so many other really good games.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:34.240
Um, you know, they have like super Mario run just like shot down the shitter, you know,

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.600
and on top of that, um, now after he said that statement, Nintendo share did fall about

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.600
4%, but the writing was on the wall.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.600
This is going to happen.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:53.480
Um, and actually as for right now, um, the only things that I see for Nintendo that's

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.840
making money is still animal crossing pocket camp.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.280
Um, Dragalia lost that's way gone down.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.680
Super Mario run has gone down.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:09.920
Fire Emblem heroes has gone way down and yeah, animal crossing is still doing pretty good.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.020
It's kind of, those rankings are kind of sad cause I actually feel like Dragalia lost,

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:17.280
you know, when Nintendo kind of does something new as opposed to animal crossing is a little

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.280
bit different.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.080
I think animal crossing kind of works as the type of game it is, but like it wasn't working

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.600
when they were trying to turn platformers like super Mario brothers, like dr Mario.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.480
Yes, more of a puzzle game, but still kind of action oriented like Mario cart when they

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.080
try to turn those games to mobile, they just don't work.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.520
But the other types of games and the new stuff, like I actually think Dragalia lost is probably

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.600
one of the stronger titles they put out.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.280
And the nice thing about it is it's not tied to any other Nintendo product.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.880
And I kind of think that's the direction Nintendo should have thought about staying in.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:53.880
But you know, the only thing that's really, I think, helped with the pocket camp to be

01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:00.080
honest is people who have forgot to cancel their subscriptions to like the, the leaf

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.360
ticket service and all of that.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:07.640
I mean, I almost forgot to do it, but you know, once I got my, my goodies from pocket

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.240
camp, I was like, okay, I'm kind of done with this.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.000
It's not really that fun.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.560
You know, you can't really, you don't have the same customization.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:24.480
And then you know, on top of that, I think that they've got really big competition in

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.880
the form of Fortnite.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:35.400
Honor of Kings is way making money in comparison to what the, you know, Nintendo titles are

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:39.840
doing as far as the mobile competition.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:45.680
They are, honestly, I think it's, it's wise.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.600
I think it's a good thing for them that they're not really pulling a hole out of it.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.600
They should keep, you know, support for what they have on there now.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.960
You know what I think that would make the money is if they did a specifically mobile

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.440
ACE attorney game, that would be fun.

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.040
That would bring them the moolah.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.160
Um, but you know, I, I also feel like I was just gonna say, I feel like Nintendo is almost

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.160
strongest when other people are allowed to develop their IPs on mobile.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.400
And obviously what's coming to my mind is Pokemon go.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.320
And I realized little different cause Pokemon is the Pokemon company, but it's still kind

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.880
of all, it's still kind of all wraps up to Nintendo.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.560
And I still kind of feel like that's the strongest title.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.200
And that was like somebody else's new idea type of thing.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.600
And I think that's like by far the strongest title that's out there that involves a Nintendo

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.640
product.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.720
But granted, I know Pokemon is like not really Nintendo, but it is, you know, I mean, I never

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:38.640
played that, that, um, uh, Fire Emblem heroes.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.520
But what if they did like a Fire Emblem thing kind of like Orna?

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.000
Oh, uh, cool.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yeah.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.640
I mean, I, who knows what else Niantic is working on for the future.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.920
There might be other Nintendo related stuff in development.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.920
Who knows?

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.320
Uh, we know content harvest their partnerships.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.320
Yeah.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:03.280
Well, anyway, um, we'll see what, uh, doesn't develop from Nintendo on the mobile front,

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.720
or maybe if they do end up kind of letting go and letting some other people develop for

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.720
that.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.720
Or if they're just like, eh, maybe not.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.400
Uh, I would take an old school Final Fantasy style Ornae game.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400
Yeah.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.400
Heck yeah.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.360
Uh, there is a square game that's out for Apple arcade.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.160
So, um, it's not very good.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.240
I don't think it is, but I'm just saying, you know, it wouldn't be too hard, but it

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:32.040
seems that, that, uh, some of those, uh, other companies are looking more to partner with,

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.440
uh, you know, the arcade service.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.840
All right.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:40.840
Well, uh, Loki, you have a pretty logical followup for this, right?

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:41.840
Yeah.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:48.320
So there was a little trailer for a brand new, uh, summer update coming to animal crossing

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.080
new horizons.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.240
And so with this, there's going to be some cool stuff, including, um, diving into the

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.760
sea and swimming.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:02.160
So now, uh, you can actually go in there and look for treasure and furniture and also new

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:08.640
fish in aquatic wildlife that you can then donate to your museum or sell.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.880
And then along with that, the return of Pascal and Gulliver, um,

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:18.040
Gulliver's already back, but I think we're getting pirate Gulliver.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040
Yes.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.040
Pirate Gulliver.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.560
And you're able to trade it for a mermaid furniture.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:30.200
Well, hey, I'm excited about Pascal because I ordered a Pascal card and then I actually

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.760
can use him in the photo thing.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.760
Yeah.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760
I'm excited.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.000
Pascal is who you trade for the furniture.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Yeah.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.640
I'm excited to get more content for animal crossing.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.160
Cause I feel a little like, okay, I'm a little worn out on what's there.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.520
Although, uh, I forgot to mention during my gaming week, the, the bug off happened on

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520
Saturday.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520
That was cute.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.560
Like that wasn't just a nice little diversion.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560
My birthday happened.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.560
Did you get your gold?

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.400
Uh, no, I didn't play enough.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.560
I didn't even get the bronze.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560
What is that?

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.560
Oh, your town?

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:05.200
She's showing, she's showing it on a stream for those are on the podcast, but, uh, but,

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.440
um, well, one thing I was going to say with, uh, animal crossing.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.400
So, um, you may or may not know I had a birthday this past week as well.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.640
Cause my birthday's only a few days after OLR.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.640
So I happy.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.640
Thank you.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.880
I got to do my birthday and animal crossing.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.320
And that was really cute.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.640
Cause it's a whole little like sequence where it's kind of like, like right when you start

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.320
and you like appear outside your house, your best friend in the town who I assume cause

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320
ketchup showed up for me and I love her.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.800
So she showed up and she's like, come with me, don't ask questions.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.700
And then suddenly I'm in ketchup's house.

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:39.080
And then who I believe are my next two best friends on the Island poncho and rocket, because

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.560
they were my two starters.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.560
So I've talked to them every day.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.920
So I'm pretty sure they're my closest friends next to ketchup, who I've also been showering

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920
and gifts.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.680
Um, they all showed up for my party and it was really cute.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.680
And then they gave me cupcakes and you go give everybody on the Island a cupcake and

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.760
they give you something party themed in return.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.640
So you get like a party floor and a party wall and all this other stuff.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.640
It's cute.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.600
That's why I didn't get any of that stuff because I kept my cupcakes.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.400
Oh, you're supposed to trade them to the villagers and they give you stuff.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.480
If I do it afterwards, it's like, here's a cupcake.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.280
Here's a moldy cupcake.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.280
I don't want this.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.280
This is super old.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:22.320
You know, what's funny is that I got kidnapped by Agnes who I didn't realize she was my bestie,

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.640
but she kind of is like the kind of person I would hang out with.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.360
She's one of the uchi characters, the big sister kind.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.840
And so like, okay, Agnes, you're cool.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.480
But I guess, you know, I had my whole birthday party on animal crossing with everybody.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480
Yeah.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.960
Well, you, you, you were right when the game came out too.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.320
So it was kind of, you were one of the first to get a birthday in animal crossing.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.640
So a few weeks after.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.640
Yeah.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.640
Yeah.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640
Yeah.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.640
So, um, yeah.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.440
Uh, also my least favorite villager left this week.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.440
So that was exciting.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.400
And now I have, Oh, I can't remember Nana.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.680
She's gone.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.760
And uh, I can't remember the name of who I got us a replacement, but he, he's a smug

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.760
type.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.640
He's a large bear that is like a Greek God type.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.160
Oh, I know who that is.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.160
Yeah.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.640
I can't remember his name in the moment.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.640
Klaus.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.640
That's it's Klaus.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.560
I know what I called the German bear.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.560
Yeah.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.360
So I got Roman German bear when I went to the nook Island.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.000
And so I was, I knew I was hunting for a smug villager cause it was the one type I didn't

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
have.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.320
So when I went nook, I saw like this, this bear is gigantic.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.520
I could see him from like when I started the Island, I was like, dang, this bear is big.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.920
So yeah, that's why, that's why I took into the town.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:34.920
And then I laughed.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.400
Cause he has like a whole like Greek God theme going with him.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:43.680
Do you want me to drop off my binder of animal crossing cards next time you need any villager?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.680
Oh yeah.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.680
Actually.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.680
Yes.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.400
Cause uh, I am going to let Alan really wants Gigi.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.800
I have the Gigi card.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.800
Okay.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.160
Well then maybe we can just do it that way.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.880
Cause, but, but I love Gigi.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:59.680
I have Gigi and Naomi who are the same type and I kind of prefer Naomi.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.600
So I think I have Naomi too.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.600
All right.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.160
It's turning into an animal crossing podcast.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.160
I'm sorry.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.760
We can do one anyway.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.760
It doesn't matter.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.760
I know.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.760
We've got it.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.760
We've got to get to your classic game though.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.760
Cause I know you've got to go soon.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:18.440
I will say, um, uh, animal crossing, even though I'm getting, even though I keep talking

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.720
about it, I do, I do appreciate that there's new stuff coming to kind of motivate me to

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.040
keep going with it.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.280
And this is coming at a very good time, I think.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.560
So, all right, moving on, let's talk quickly about the smash brothers direct that happened

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560
this week.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.280
So we knew that we were going to be getting a character from arms.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.200
Uh, and so we did get announced, uh, the character from arms will be Min Min will be coming over

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.600
from arms.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.680
And uh, so, so unfortunately a lot of people were hoping for twin tell who I guess Shane

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:50.720
messaged me and said, I called twin tell twin Tanya, which is a final fantasy 14 boss on

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.680
the last show and nobody bothered to correct me.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.360
I've been playing too much of 14 anyway, twin tell was, it seemed to be a popular choice

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.360
on Twitter.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.300
Uh, but it did end up being Min Min who I think a lot of people, I think people are

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:08.040
kind of like, okay, it's kind of like the reaction I'm kind of feeling out there.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040
It's Min Min.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040
Okay.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.640
So anyway, um, that is the new character that's coming to smash and they, you know, detailed

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.720
how it's all going to work and kind of the Springs and all that type of stuff.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.240
Now what else was announced during, I mean, we knew we were getting an arms character,

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.640
but what about some of the stuff we didn't know about?

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.300
So there were actually some new me fighter costumes that were unveiled and one of them

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:34.700
is the fallout boy or not, not like the band fallout boy, but like the little pit boy from

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:40.000
fallout is, which is weird because I'm like, is there even a fallout game on switch?

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.200
Maybe shell, maybe fallout shelters on switch.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.480
That's all I can think of.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.040
So, um, there's that.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.480
I think that's kind of interesting.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.400
And then you can get some of the, uh, splatoon characters as well, which I think is really

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.400
cute.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400
And there's some other stuff too.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.680
Uh, 75 cents each for the, those are me fighter costumes.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.440
So it's not like an actual character, but you can make your me fighter and look like

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.440
one.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.640
And there's more amiibo coming, including persona fives, joker, and that amiibo looks

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.640
awesome.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.420
Actually, that's coming this fall.

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.820
And they're also going to be doing the hero from the dragon quest series, who's also added

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.960
the game previously, uh, both those figures coming out this fall.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:17.940
So yes, amiibo is still a thing if you are wondering.

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.340
So that was a fun direct.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.020
I must admit I didn't watch it live.

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:26.140
I just checked out the cliff notes after the fact, cause I don't play smash quite as frequently

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:30.520
as I think other people I know, but, um, yeah, I'm excited to, to, I think some of the me

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.580
characters they're doing are really cute.

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:37.700
And uh, I love that this game is still going all this time after it released, uh, poor

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:42.220
Sakurai probably needs a fucking nap, but good for him working so hard on this game

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.220
and everything.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:44.220
So cool.

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.220
Cool.

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.220
All right.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.220
Moving on.

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.220
Uh, Dark Sakura.

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.420
Dark Sakura, you're muted.

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:51.420
I think.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.420
I'm still muted.

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:53.420
Yeah.

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.420
Sorry.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.420
Sorry about it.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:59.140
Um, so to move on to Canada, we don't give Canada enough love.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.140
Do we?

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.140
Love you Canada.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.860
You have a right to close your borders.

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:07.060
Um, there is the entertainment software association of Canada.

01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.060
Sorry.

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.060
Quick aside.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.660
Just fact though, I was supposed to be in Toronto this weekend.

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.980
There wasn't even supposed to be a show today.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.260
I was supposed to be in Toronto for pride this year.

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.520
That was the original plan.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.520
So frown.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520
Anyway.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.520
Sorry Jamie.

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.520
But that was important.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520
Girl.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.520
Okay.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.520
Anyway.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.180
Um, they, what they do is they, uh, support the growth of Canada's video game industry.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:33.300
So they do research advocacy, um, and promote awareness of issues that affect video gaming

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.060
and the development thereof.

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:39.220
And they also work in talent development and technology skills.

01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:44.860
Um, and so what they've done, they are hosting the Canadian student video game competition.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:49.300
So they're inviting post-secondary students from across the country to participate, to

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:55.460
show their skills and show excellence in three categories, originality slash creativity,

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:59.140
artistic expression and technical proficiency.

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:02.860
So, um, they are doing it in the form of video games.

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:08.740
They want to really promote and cultivate, uh, new, new blood in the industry.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:16.500
So their winning team, um, will, uh, has a cash award of $6,000 Canadian to be put toward

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:20.240
new equipment to continue in their education and training.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.220
So, uh, it's now in their sixth year, they've received 20 submissions this year.

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:33.100
And, uh, like last year, um, we, the looks like the first unit, like, you know, I'm trying

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:38.740
to say winner and I'm looking at university was, um, uh, from the school of digital, uh,

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:42.100
arts animation and design at the university of Quebec.

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:47.340
Um, and then, uh, another one from, it looks like their mathematic I'm translating to the

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.100
university of Quebec, mathematic information team.

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.860
And they build a game called cold sun.

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.420
I'm sure we've seen this around.

01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:58.300
Haven't you, um, I've been seeing ads for cold sun.

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:02.220
And then the second place was a game called wormwood from Sheridan college.

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:08.580
And third place was the last frame from, uh, uh, I think it's also university of

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:11.620
Quebec, uh, uh, she, she called Timmy.

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:15.660
I think is how it's pronounced, but yeah, cold sun is, is this third party stealth

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:22.180
game, um, kind of, you know, post POCA, post post-apocalyptic that basically you have

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:24.820
to scavenge her resources by using garbage.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:30.900
Um, and then wormwood is a hack and slash and last frame is a cooperative puzzle game.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:33.500
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes out of it this year.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.500
That'd be really cool.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.500
Yeah.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.740
Hooray for the future of game developers.

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:38.740
Yay, Canada.

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:39.740
All right.

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:40.740
Yay, Canada.

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:41.740
All right.

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:46.260
To which, uh, we actually have a chatter in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:51.220
network named I am Canadian 47 who just responded with clap emojis.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:52.260
So there you go.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.260
Shout out to Canada.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.580
Uh, I am Canadian 47 also says pride up here was virtual.

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:57.580
So it was quieter.

01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:58.580
Yeah.

01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.580
They've been doing it.

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:00.580
They did like a big virtual pride on Amazon.

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:02.860
I think there's like, it's not, it's not quite the same.

01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:03.860
I don't know.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:04.860
It's just, yeah.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.140
I mean, I don't like to go to the one in San Francisco anymore because San Francisco is

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:14.920
so packed in like something weird started happening in my thirties and now my forties

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:20.140
were like, I suddenly have claustrophobia in certain situations and San Francisco pride

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:23.060
like gets that going.

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:27.100
Whereas when I was in Chicago, it was fine, but that's because there's, it's so like the

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:29.940
route is gigantic and there's so much space.

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:33.620
I didn't feel like it's packed in when I was there and I was looking forward to Toronto

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.820
this year, but we'll just have to make it happen in a future year.

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.580
For me, San Francisco pride.

01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:42.860
Um, I much prefer it to the garbage that was Sacramento pride.

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.620
Um, cause it was garbage.

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.780
It was really bad.

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:48.980
Super hot, overcrowded, not enough water, not enough emergency.

01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:53.780
Um, I've been to a festival where San Francisco has been run pretty, pretty well.

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:56.860
Um, as long as at least I've gone to it.

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.940
And of course I also have the advantage of marching in it with the sisters.

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:04.500
I remember the rainbow festival here, which is labor day weekend beat.

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:09.540
Now granted, I haven't been, I haven't been in like eight years because of dragon con.

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:13.720
Um, but with the rainbow festival, I always say that was something the bars downtown just

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.220
kind of did on their own.

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:16.220
That's a better time of year.

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.140
It's not as hot labor day weekend.

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:21.580
And honestly though, this past one, I don't know.

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:22.580
It seemed pretty tame.

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:28.940
The most exciting place that, that I went to was probably what was supposed to be there.

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:33.740
You know, their answer to Dory alley, you know, the, the leather place.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:39.620
Um, and I had a good time, um, but it was, it was pretty quiet.

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:43.380
I think I went in face come to think of it, or maybe I didn't anyway.

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.380
All right.

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:45.380
It was still fun.

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.380
Let's move on for time.

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.580
So Loki, what do you have next for us?

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.100
All right.

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:53.180
So let's talk about more Pokemon announcements.

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:58.980
So we've got this brand new game announced by the Pokemon company called Pokemon unite.

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:07.020
It's a team-based mobile battle arena game that's created with the company Tencent and

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:11.540
it's free to play on the switch and as well as mobile.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:15.420
And I guess it's five on five, um, base or team-based MOBA.

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:21.780
So no word on what it's supposed to be coming out, but it looks interesting.

01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.940
I'm not really one to play MOBAs.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.140
So it's not something that appeals to me, but I know there are a lot of people that

01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.140
like that kind of stuff.

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.140
Yeah.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:34.500
I, I, I, I've enjoyed some of the MOBAs I've played.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.140
Like I just, there's a lot of toxic people that play them.

01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:39.420
And so it usually scares me off from them.

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.220
Probably my best experience was in heroes of the storm, because when you play versus

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:48.260
AI, it's a lot less toxic there because all the edge Lords are playing more of the PVP

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:49.260
stuff.

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.740
So that was probably my best experience was playing heroes of the storm.

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:55.500
So I know a lot of people were upset about this Pokemon news because I think some people

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.660
set the bar way too high.

01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:02.780
Like they were expecting Pokemon let's go for the Sinnoh regions, which, you know, when

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:06.780
they've got DLC still happening for the main game is not going to happen anyway.

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:10.740
Um, or they were expecting, I don't know, like gen four remix or something, but it's

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.060
like, you just got new Pokemon snap announced.

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.940
Like it's not going to exceed that.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:19.540
Um, so some people are disappointed, but I, I, I welcome it.

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.780
I don't think it's the worst thing they could have announced.

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.500
Um, I think it could be interesting.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.500
Yeah.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.340
It's different to be willing to see what it's like.

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:33.180
Um, you know, there was the other Pokemon game that they had that was all kind of cubish.

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.180
Um, that was okay.

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.580
Um, I don't know.

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.740
It's nice that they're experimenting with the franchise.

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:45.460
Um, I forgot to say during my gaming week, I played that Pokemon cafe came out, um, and

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.860
I played a little bit of that.

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.860
It's super cute.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.380
Like the art style's great.

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.420
And, uh, it's, it's kind of a cute way to look at Pokemon.

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:56.500
And at first I was kind of, Oh, it is kind of Tsum Tsum, but it's kind of like a puzzler.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.700
Like you only have so many swipes to clear the board and it starts to turn into freemium

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:02.140
trash real quick.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.140
Sorry.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:08.000
But, um, there's, there's a really cute art style there that maybe could be developed

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.880
into other games or I just wish there was a nonstop mode like Tsum Tsum has, like, I

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.400
don't know why it needed to be a strictly a puzzler.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.420
Um, probably that's how they plan to make money, but maybe when this game kind of fizzles

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:24.560
out because it's not very good, um, they'll look at different ways to, um, innovate it

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.000
and maybe I'll get the, I like how you say that because it's not very good.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.360
Well, I'm just, I'm in a mood tonight.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.200
I'm just, I'm not making friends tonight.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:40.280
Sadly, I'm a little bit of a cactus tonight.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280
Happy pride.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.280
All right.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280
All right.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:47.360
Uh, let's move on and, uh, Oh, I think this one's my story and this is about some anime

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.360
that's going to be happening.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.920
So there was a cyberpunk reveal that happened this week as well.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.320
So they were explaining more about that game.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:01.280
And as part of it, there's going to be a collaboration between studio trigger and CD project red

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:08.320
and for Netflix in 2022, a new anime series called cyberpunk edge runners will be coming

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.320
out.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.720
And if that didn't have your attention, what if I told you that Akira Yamaoka is doing

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.400
the music for it?

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.400
That's pretty cool.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.400
Yeah.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.400
Right.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.400
So I think that's pretty cool.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.440
Uh, so the screenplay is being handled by Yoshiki Ussa and Masahiko Otsuka.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:30.160
Uh, and so I think this is a good kind of expand the world of cyberpunk and these anime

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.720
series on Netflix based on video games have done pretty well.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.920
I guess some people could kind of give or take the ingress one, but I guess the Castlevania

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:38.920
was pretty good.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.360
Uh, and is there one of the ingress one in there?

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360
Yeah.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.760
Like, well, there's plenty of them, but if the ingress one is, it's kind of plagued

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.200
by the same problem that ingress has, which is the storylines really convoluted and confusing

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.920
and the anime plays that game for the story.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:54.920
Give me a break.

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:55.920
Exactly.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.760
But it's just like anime was really good.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.760
Ooh, yeah.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:05.200
And I'm sorry if they should have released this in the US, but the animal crossing anime

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.400
was really cute and really sweet.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.200
Maybe they will.

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.740
Also announced for anime adaptation in the worlds of video games.

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:15.740
This is pretty cool.

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:20.080
The world ends with you is going to be getting an anime adaptation.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.080
Remember that game?

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.880
It was just a recently re-released on switch, not that long ago.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.360
Anime expo light.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.560
We'll be getting more details on that.

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.720
Basically the real anime expo not happening because of COVID.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.280
So they're doing the online deal.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.800
So just think this, you would have got to see this in person maybe if COVID hadn't happened,

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800
but it did.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:43.400
So anime expo light on Friday, July 3rd, 6 PM Pacific, and then Saturday, July 4th,

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.400
10 AM.

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:46.960
That's time zone conversion for Japan.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:55.840
So more information you can check out their website is, Ooh, it's subarashiki-anime.jp.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.640
And that's the world ends with you anime, and I'm sure our pals over at anime jam session

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.240
Tuesday nights hosted here at VOG network.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.880
I'm sure they will have plenty more to say on these stories.

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.720
So check them out Tuesday night.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:08.720
All right.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.240
Meanwhile, it's time to get to the classic game of the week and dark soccer.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.240
Are you ready for this?

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.760
I have something very special.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:21.960
So it's time for the classic game of the week and the return of the cute little music that

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.760
plays in the background, which we haven't had for a long time.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.360
And a little, little video flourish for our pals over on Twitch.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.160
So every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and she's trying to find a game

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:37.360
that, Hey, you brats should check out this game, respect this game.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.000
But once a month, dark soccer says, you know what, I'm going to mix it up and pick a pinball

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
game.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.560
Uh, and, uh, we're finally getting to June's.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.440
There was a lot of other stuff that needed attention this month.

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:50.840
So we're, we're, we're getting to June's pinball pick at the end of the month, but that's okay.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:54.560
So dark soccer, what did you pick for the classic pinball of the month?

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:59.960
I picked the shadow, terrible movie, really cool game.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:05.200
Um, so, um, it was designed by Brian Eddie.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.600
The software was done by Mike Boone, um, artwork by Doug Watson.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.080
Um, it's, it's really an interesting, an interesting table.

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.360
So, um, hold on just a second.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.600
Cause I'm trying to actually get the layout of the shadow so I can describe a little bit

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.600
more.

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.760
Um, we do see some video footage of it.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.440
Sadly, I wasn't able to get around to get any of the music.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:31.600
I couldn't find a clean copy, but we do have the video playing, uh, for our Twitch friends.

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:38.440
So one of the very interesting things about it to me is that, um, if you're looking at

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:46.160
that there is on the upper left hand side, a, um, like a mini little play field that

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.680
has, uh, this kind of paddly game on it is just really cool.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:57.600
And that's one of, I think for me, I'd kind of call it the gimmick of the game, but overall

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.160
it's a really fun one to play.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.160
I'm no good at it.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.160
I'm just going to tell you this right now.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.680
I don't play it that often.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:08.480
Um, and I think we loaned ours out right now, but yeah, it's called the battlefield is that

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.080
whole section up there and it's got some fun ramp action, you know, and even the theming

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:19.600
of it, um, you know, if it wasn't the shadow, just having that whole art deco look to it

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.080
just really is quite attractive.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.520
So it's a really, really pretty, pretty looking one.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:30.600
Um, and yeah, uh, Questbuster also points out that the soundtrack by Goldsmith was great

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:31.600
and actually, yeah, it was.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.600
I saw this in the theater.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:37.320
Um, but as far as, uh, other things about it, you've got all these different scenes.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.880
You have punish the guilty Farley Claymore, duel of wills, which is a video mode, um,

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:47.060
brilliant sphere, escape from underwater, escape underwater, doom, and discover hotel

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:48.060
monolith.

01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:52.240
You have, um, the bat, the battlefield, like I was just mentioning, you have shadow multi-ball

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.240
and con multi-ball.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:31:04.440
Um, and it actually had Tim Curry in it, Rob, some of the actors, um, recorded new speech

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.440
for the game.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:10.000
So you had Penelope and Miller, uh, John loan and Tim Curry.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:15.400
So, uh, and then, um, there, though, the, the, the character for the shadow was actually

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:21.640
voiced by one of the Williams, uh, midway voice actors, uh, Tim, uh, kids row.

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:26.960
Um, and then it was kind of funny because like that whole battlefield thing is kinda,

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:30.280
you know, Arkanoid breakout E sorta sorta thing.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:37.880
Um, but at any rate they produced 4,247 units, it was released November, 1994.

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:45.840
So right after I graduated high school, um, and, uh, you know, it had the usual, uh, you

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:51.040
know, cheeseball catchphrases for marketing, like when the shadow falls, earnings rise

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.120
and no one can resist the power of the shadow.

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:57.480
And then the shadow has the power to cloud men's minds, but the shadow pinball has the

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:01.520
power to seize players' imaginations, whatever.

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:05.560
Um, you can, uh, get ROMs of it for pen maim.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:12.640
Um, there's of course, you know, you can still kind of get some of the stuff for it.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.600
It's really, really fun.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.480
There's something, I think a couple of mods for it.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.920
I'm not really familiar cause we haven't, I don't think we've really done anything like

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:20.920
that.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:28.720
Um, there, uh, I'm trying to see like what the last one, I don't remember what we, what

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:34.240
we paid for ours, but they, it's one of the, from what I understand, I don't think you

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:37.560
have to pay too much for it, like two grand maybe for a really good one.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.880
Um, but yeah, it's a fun one.

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.800
Um, you know, like I said, terrible movie, excellent machine.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:44.800
I recommend it.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.800
We have one ourselves.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.480
Like I said, we loaned it out.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:53.640
Um, one of Dan's buddies was streaming it not too long ago and that was our table.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:59.960
You know, sometimes, um, bad movies become okay games or even better pinball tables,

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.760
you know, it can happen sometimes.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.760
So it's pretty cool.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:10.800
But you know, it's, I think my favorite thing about it is just that whole, you know, pseudo

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.800
art deco style.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.560
I just think it's really, really cool looking.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.560
All right.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.800
I know they definitely had good style, even if poor execution.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.880
There it is your classic pinball table of the month, the shadow.

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:22.880
Good pick.

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.120
Yep.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.120
All right.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:30.240
Happy to happy to be of service and yeah, now I'm like way, not way past where I need

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240
to be.

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.240
All right.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.800
So sadly, blah, blah, blah.

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:34.800
Yep.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.440
Sadly, I think we have to say goodnight to dark Sakura.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.160
Uh, but any, uh, thanks for being here as always.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.160
Happy 18th.

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.760
Um, and any parting words for us tonight?

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760
Right.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.760
Yeah.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:48.760
And go to adult jail.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:56.640
Well, I don't know, but I, I'm, I'm really flattered that everyone liked, um, like the

01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.720
theme and likes the artwork and, uh, there'll be other versions of the artwork, Rob, like

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:02.720
we've discussed.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.120
So you'll see, you'll see more come of it and you know, I kind of gave everyone, we

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:16.600
gave them a bit of a preview cause our little icons on, uh, on discord, uh, for a video

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:20.360
that's, uh, that's part of it and the ferrets in there.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:25.160
So you didn't have, you know, when I showed Alan, you know, speaking of like all the little

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:28.920
in jokes, which I hope you guys have fun looking at the different in jokes, but when I showed

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.800
Alan, do you know what he said?

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:34.400
What he said, where's president cat?

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.960
I didn't think of that.

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.640
Yeah, no, it's, and it's fine.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.640
It's fine.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.440
I don't, I don't want to like when you do such great art, I don't want to be like, but

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.040
what about this one thing you forgot?

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:49.760
No, it's, it's still great, but yeah, it was just funny specifically for Loki.

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:51.520
Did you notice what it was?

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.440
I don't know if Loki seemed like the final final version really briefly when I was on

01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.080
the screen, but I wasn't paying to tingle holding broccoli.

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.080
Yeah.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.500
There's tingles holding broccoli.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:03.500
It's cute.

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:08.080
So we have the reference to the broccoli farm and there's like plugs for two yyr games in

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.080
there.

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.080
So I'll tell you what.

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:19.360
If someone would message me the two yyr plugs, which should be fairly fucking easy.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360
Yeah.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.960
Um, maybe I will give you your own special version of the artwork.

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:24.960
Oh, fun.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:25.960
All right.

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:26.960
Yeah.

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:27.960
All right.

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:28.960
Well thank you.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:29.960
Dark Sakura.

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:31.640
We'll see you next time here on OLR.

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.520
And by the way, everyone look up at my camera.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:35.520
Okay.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:39.280
But the, the folks on podcast going to announce it.

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.280
Okay.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.280
Wear your mask.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.280
Hold on.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.280
Happy pride.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280
Yeah.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.280
And happy pride.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.280
Oh, I don't know.

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.280
I don't.

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:55.160
I'm going to be muffled now cause I'm wearing a mask and I don't know if Jamie can see it,

01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:00.280
but as that as that gave me these wonderful rainbow glitter masks.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:02.280
I see it.

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.520
Yes.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.680
So I'm, I'm Katana and Molina's gay brother right now.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:16.120
I just have plain black ones, but I ordered, um, was it, uh, they were, they were doing

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:21.760
some promotion on Twitter and I think a gearbox was for Borderlands where they were offering

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.280
a psycho face mask.

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.880
So I got a set of those.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:26.880
Nice.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.280
I did get two masks when my friend Nikki came back from Thailand.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.040
Um, one of them is red with cats all over it and then another one is a Doraemon one,

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.040
but it's upside down.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.040
So, yeah.

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:41.760
But one of my sister friends is making me masks on the fabric that I have had forever.

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.360
So I'll show you those when I get them.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.680
I think we have two of the rainbow masks and I think Alan just went to the store.

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:49.920
I know he went to the store cause that was what was the side conversation that distracted

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:50.920
me earlier.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.600
Um, and I think he wore his rainbow mask out.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:59.700
So I think he's just daring one of our bitch neighbors to say something on pride weekend

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.840
about his rainbow glitter mask.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:08.480
I'm still tempted to put, to put out a pride flag for the fourth or a black lives matter

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:09.480
flag.

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:14.400
I'd have to get it past the hubby or get the, get the modern pride flag with the, uh, with

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.400
the, um, Chevron.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:19.800
They call that a little, I want to, but, um, other than that, I don't want to put a flag

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:20.800
out.

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.800
So just saying.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.800
All right.

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.800
Uh, we're gonna move on with the show.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.800
Bye dark soccer.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800
Thanks for being here.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.800
Okay.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.800
Bye.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.920
Let's talk about some rapid fire news.

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:33.640
We're going to go to Loki for some rapid fire news.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:37.840
You know, I, I'm very disappointed with my social media following that I was not made

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:41.300
aware of this until several days after the official announcement.

01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:46.720
So just to let everybody else know, that's not in the know, uh, earth defense for six

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.880
was announced, uh, coming in 2021.

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.880
Now that was just a teaser bit that was at the end of the actual announcement trailer

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:59.080
for a different game, which is a little odd, but it was called earth defense force.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:09.360
Uh, world brothers, and it is a kind of a voxel Lee looking, uh, earth defense force

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360
game.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.120
That's going to be out on the switch and on PlayStation four.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:19.280
It looks like a mashup between, you know, like, uh, Minecraft and earth defense force.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.600
So I'm not sure what you do as far as like being able to build anything in the game,

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.520
but neat.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:30.980
And I will definitely play it because it is, uh, something that appeals to, uh, both games

01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:32.280
that I love dearly.

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:37.020
Um, so yeah, so those will be coming soon.

01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:44.360
And then, uh, for July's Xbox, uh, live games of gold, we're gonna be getting, uh, WRC eight

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.760
FIA world rally championship and dunk Lords.

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.760
Those are both on Xbox one.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.760
Then your Xbox.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.760
I'm sorry.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.160
Is that a game called dunk Lords?

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:56.160
Dunk Lords.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.160
Yeah.

01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.160
Is that like Dunkaroos?

01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.160
What, what is, is that back?

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.160
What's that basketball?

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.160
Like dunk.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.160
It's like a basketball type.

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.160
Okay.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:04.160
Okay.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.160
It's basketball.

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.160
Okay.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.160
Yeah.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.160
So it is a pretty cool.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.160
And then you don't just dunk.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.160
You dunk Lords.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.160
Forget it.

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.160
Doesn't deserve it.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.160
Of course.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.720
One of my favorite Xbox three 60 games, saints row two, uh, and then also a game called juju.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.080
That's going to be out later in the month.

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.440
Oh, juju B should totally win all stars five.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440
What?

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440
Okay.

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.440
All right.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.440
Moving on.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440
All right.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.440
I have some rapid fire news as well.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.960
Uh, let's talk about a sequel for blood stained curse of the moon.

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:34.960
Please note.

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:37.200
This is not the main blood stained game.

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.680
I mean, I would think that game's probably going to get a sequel at some point, but they

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.160
haven't confirmed anything with that.

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.780
However, that eight bit retro kind of thing that proceeded pretty good.

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:47.780
That was pretty good.

01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:48.780
It was curse of the moon.

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:51.040
There is going to be a curse of the moon too.

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.400
Um, so that's pretty cool.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:57.120
So you will play as Zangetsu, who is the swordsman who I believe you meet in the story

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.120
of the original.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:03.840
So, um, if you've played the actual bloodstain game, you've already seen Zangetsu, um, but

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.100
there's a whole new cast of characters in the game that are end up in the playable roster

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:08.100
and so forth.

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:14.480
Um, no date yet on that, but we do know it's steam, Xbox one, PlayStation four and switch.

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:15.480
So pretty much everywhere.

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.960
Uh, so check that out.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:21.800
That is the sequel to curse of the moon and which I think this is really funny.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.400
There's a new game coming out called shakedown Hawaii, which is kind of a 16 bit retro action

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.400
game.

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.760
And this game is so retro, how retro is it?

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:37.320
It's coming out for the Wii and the Wii U that's, that's, that's not a typo or miss.

01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:39.480
It's coming out for the Wii and the Wii U.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.760
It's a port there.

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.520
So they, it's, it's out on like all the other platforms right now.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:49.420
And the guy that made this one before he did, uh, try to think of the other one was called,

01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:54.260
he did, he's done several like grand theft audit, like retro grand theft auto type games.

01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:56.500
The first one I did was kind of an NES based one.

01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:57.900
This one's SNES.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:02.660
Um, great game actually, but it's cool to see that he's supporting those other systems

01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:04.500
because he'd actually done that before too.

01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:09.140
I think with like even in the PSP last time he put out a game as well.

01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:11.180
So um, cool.

01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:13.780
There's not a lot, well actually I wouldn't say there's not a lot of games coming out

01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:17.620
on the Wii, but we had an announcement of another Wii game like not too long ago either.

01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:23.180
So what the reality is, there's still millions of those machines out there and they still

01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:24.180
work.

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.620
So why not?

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.700
Now this is very much a collector's thing and I think they even said it's only going

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:32.000
to be, it's going to be limited to 3000 copies for this Wii version.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.440
So it's not something he's looking to mass produce.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:39.180
This is very much a niche collectors type of thing that he's doing.

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:41.620
Um, and that's, you know, that's what it's for.

01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:45.500
It's going to be 30 bucks too, which is more of a collector's price for a game like that.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.660
But I'm sure there will be people that will be all about it.

01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:48.660
So why not?

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:49.660
I think it's neat.

01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:50.660
I think it's neat.

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:51.660
It's a good game.

01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:55.100
I have it on Epic Game Store and it's pretty awesome.

01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:56.100
Awesome.

01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.100
All right.

01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:01.420
Well, let's move on and let's get into some world release dates and check out some other

01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:03.580
games that are coming out this week.

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.260
Maybe on the more modern systems.

01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:06.260
Loki.

01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:07.260
Yes.

01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:13.020
So we've got a game called Brigadine, the Legend of Runeseria and that's coming out

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:14.780
on Nintendo Switch.

01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:16.820
Color Cross Malice.

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:18.740
That's on Nintendo Switch.

01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:22.940
We have a Death Come True, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android.

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:28.660
Mr. Driller Drill Land on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:34.300
Blaster Master Zero and Blaster Master Zero 2 both coming to PlayStation 4.

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:39.300
The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel 3 on Nintendo Switch.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.920
Little Town Hero on PC.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:47.960
Track Mania on PC, which I'm assuming is the brand new version, not the older Track

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.520
Mania game.

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:55.080
And last but not least, coming to PlayStation VR, Marvel's Iron Man VR.

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:58.320
My son will be overly joyed with that.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.440
All right.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.700
Well traveling to Japan and checking out the release dates over there.

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:07.720
We have a few things on the Nintendo Switch this week, including Catherine Full Body for

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.440
Nintendo Switch is out this week on the second.

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.420
And probably one of the best titles, game title names you'll ever have on the Switch.

01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:22.800
We have Wolf Meow Animal Hospital, an important, an important job to help pets.

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.280
It is an important job to help pets.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.280
But I just love that name.

01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:27.960
It's Wolf Meow Animal Hospital.

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:30.240
The songs that they make.

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:34.240
What do we, what do we, what do we call, what do we call the animal hospital in our game?

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.240
Quick.

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:36.240
Somebody give us a name to call this.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.240
Oh, Wolf Meow.

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.240
Thank you.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.240
Yes.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.240
Yes, Mr. Smoosh.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.040
Now Wolf.

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:45.240
Anyway, actually the cover looks really cute.

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.240
I got to say this.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.560
The game looks adorable.

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:53.400
Like I doubt it's getting a regional release here in the US, but like in Japan, if you

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:57.000
had like kids that wanted to be like a veterinarian when they grow up or something, this would

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.300
be like the perfect game for them.

01:43:58.300 --> 01:43:59.960
It looks really cute.

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:05.600
Like you're actually like checking the temperature on the dog and giving a little bit of medicine

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.800
and inspecting the cat's eyes and doing all sorts of things.

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.800
It looks really cute.

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:16.480
So with as much like kind of crap I'm giving the game, I think it actually looks cute.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.640
On the PlayStation 4, a little quieter this week, I guess nobody wanted to compete with

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.480
Wolf Meow, but you do have Marvel's Iron Man VR is also out in Japan.

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.120
I think that's like a worldwide release when that game hits.

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.920
How about the UK, Loki?

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:38.000
The UK, we've got Down the Rabbit Hole on PlayStation 4, Gun Club VR on PlayStation

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.280
4, I'm assuming PlayStation VR.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.680
Big Pharma special edition on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:48.200
No, fuck Big Pharma.

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.200
Evil bastards.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.200
All right.

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:58.040
The Wonderful 101 remastered on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, Iron Man VR as well

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:04.500
on PlayStation VR, Azure Striker Gunvolt Striker Pack on PlayStation 4.

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.500
And that's it.

01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:10.860
Sorry, just the whole Big Pharma, like, you know how we do those little parody intros

01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:13.700
on Twitch that inspired from you can't do that on television.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:19.300
I think we had one like a year ago that was Wizards Unite against Big Pharma.

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:23.140
And it was a picture of that guy, that fucking asshole guy that bought the company and then

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.620
jacked up the meds.

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:26.980
That's all I can think of when you say Big Pharma.

01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:31.100
It's funny that you say that because here's the summary of the title.

01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:34.580
What if you have the power to rid the world of disease, to improve the lives of millions

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:38.860
to ease suffering and cure the sick, and earn a tidy profit?

01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:39.860
Wow.

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:43.860
That's what you do.

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:46.460
I don't know how I feel about this game.

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:47.460
Wow.

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:49.460
All right.

01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.460
Anyway.

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:51.460
Wow.

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:56.860
So combine that with Woof Meow Animal Hospital and you've got some worldwide drug treatment

01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:57.860
this week.

01:45:57.860 --> 01:45:58.860
All right.

01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.660
Anyway, let's move on and we're going to get to the mailbag every week.

01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:07.460
You guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of our favorite emails here

01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.140
on the show.

01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:11.660
And we actually have a few of them to get through here.

01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.580
So let me make sure I get to them all.

01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:19.660
And we're going to start tonight with our first email from YYR, who said, hello, LR.

01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:23.180
Rob, I was thrilled that you mentioned Rocky's Boots last week.

01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:24.420
Well, I was thrilled to bring it up.

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:25.420
I love that game.

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:28.620
I didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted with that game when I was little because I

01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:29.620
never owned it myself.

01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:33.180
But I remember how much fun I had with it in the short time that I played it.

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:37.460
I wonder if it'd be worth finding again for when my daughter is old enough to try it.

01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:38.820
You probably wouldn't have to look that hard.

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:43.180
I'm almost positive it's on that archive website, you know, the library archive that has all

01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.180
the old games.

01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:45.540
I'm almost positive it's there.

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:48.460
Although I did hear, we didn't get into it on tonight's show, but I did hear there's

01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:52.900
some type of lawsuit coming up against that archive and it might threaten its existence

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:56.220
because I don't think it's specifically the video game part of it, but I think there's

01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:59.980
other stuff that they're archiving that copyright holders are taking issue with.

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:05.220
I think it's the books or something because it's bypassing some sort of like loaning.

01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:09.460
I don't remember what the issue is, but it's book publishers that are having some problems

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:10.460
with it.

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.460
Yeah, you're right.

01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:15.220
It is the book publishers, but that could trickle down and have an effect on the game

01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.220
part of it.

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:20.620
Regardless, it's the internet, and if you really wanted to find a Commodore 64 and Apple

01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:25.340
2 ROM, it's not that hard to do, so just putting that out there.

01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.860
Anyway, YYRContinues in the email.

01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:32.100
I did want to mention that it wasn't actually published by MECC.

01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:37.060
It was actually a product of The Learning Company, but MECC had so much great output

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:41.580
as well, including Odell Lake, Number Munchers, and of course, The Oregon Trail.

01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.580
You know what?

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:46.500
And I always got The Learning Company and MECC confused, so I'm not particularly...

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:47.500
And you know what?

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.180
A lot of those Apple 2 games were hard to distinguish from one another, so I think if

01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:55.580
it was an edutainment game that existed, I kind of just defaulted it to MECC, but I

01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:56.580
appreciate the clarification.

01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:57.580
You're absolutely right.

01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:00.100
Let's give credit where credit is due.

01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:02.580
Never mind that, though, says YYR.

01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:05.220
The most important part of this email is what I attached.

01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:10.100
When I was in high school, I knew a guy who was part of a punk ska band called Fix.

01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:13.540
The band wasn't around for very long, but one of its songs was dedicated to Rocky's

01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:14.860
Boots the Game.

01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:17.260
It is awesome, and I hope you can play it on air.

01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:20.080
I'm very sorry, YYR.

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:24.120
You picked the worst night to send me an audio clip 30 minutes before the show, because I

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.620
was literally...

01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:32.040
Like the smush clip that y'all saw on Twitch was done like minutes before we were on air,

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.640
so it was just a bad night for that.

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.640
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.740
But I think he says he'll put it in Discord, and that's great.

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:40.640
I did listen to it, and it did rock.

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:43.160
Anyway, it is awesome, and I hope you can play it on air.

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.720
I scoured the internet, and I couldn't find any trace of it.

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.920
Shazam had no clue what it was, and the band broke up over 20 years ago.

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.800
So I'm pretty sure you're in the clear.

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.800
But if you can't play it after all, I'll stick it in the VoG Discord.

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.540
Anyway, thanks for the show, and have a great week.

01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:00.160
Stay healthy, happy, and sane, Aaron, or YYR.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.880
Oh, I didn't even think about the fact that technically I'm not supposed to play copyright

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:07.400
music, but it was just a little clip, and I'm sure, like you said, it would have been

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.400
fine.

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.440
But sadly, it was like the worst night to send me a clip.

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440
I'm sorry.

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:12.680
But put it in Discord, because it's funny.

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:17.600
And I love songs based off games.

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:18.600
So yeah.

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:20.480
All right.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.760
Let's get to some more emails.

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:24.280
FrodoSwagons is next.

01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:29.560
Hey all, I already brought this up in chat, but was wondering if you had any thoughts.

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.960
Not sure if you know who this is.

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:40.760
Doctor Disrespect is an insanely popular streamer, got permanently banned off of Twitch, and

01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.640
just sort of disappeared.

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.840
Everyone is super confused as to what happened.

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:47.040
Twitch won't say why, and neither will the doctor.

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:52.720
Apparently, he brought up conspiracy theorist David Icky on stream shortly after he read

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.600
something on his phone and got emotional, and his stream ended.

01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:58.960
I just find it odd that no one knows anything or won't speak up.

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:04.760
No idea what David would do with violation Twitch policies, but that's what some people

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.760
think.

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:07.120
No worries if you haven't heard of it.

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:11.160
Yes, I've heard of it, because I'm going to be honest, and I'm sorry if you're a fan.

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:14.400
I'm not directing anger at you, but I don't get why this guy is famous.

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.600
I don't get it.

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:19.920
And I kind of thought he would have got banned after he took the camera into the bathroom

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:23.080
at E3, because that wasn't funny.

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:30.880
I kind of feel like this whole Disrespect, Edgelord, I kind of think that stuff was the

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:33.320
attitude we're trying to get away from in games.

01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:39.320
And look, I'm not going to shit on those of you that enjoy it, because I still laugh at

01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:40.800
South Park once in a while.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.800
I get it.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:48.160
There's a time and a place for bathroom humor, but I don't get this guy, and I don't get

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.800
why he had all this fame.

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:55.100
So yes, I did hear about that it happened, and I don't know the reason why either.

01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:59.360
We here at OLR do not have any extra information, I'm sorry to say.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:03.120
And if he's not saying anything and Twitch isn't saying anything, the reality is we're

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.340
probably never going to know what happened.

01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:07.000
He might write a tell-all book.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.680
I imagine that's where something like this goes.

01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:12.160
So maybe you'll find out at that point.

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:18.860
But nobody really owes anybody an explanation, so that part's kind of difficult as well.

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:22.360
So yeah, I don't know what else to add to that.

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:23.700
I don't know.

01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:27.960
My coworker is a big fan of his, and I tried watching some of his stuff.

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:32.240
And I get the appeal because the character was kind of funny, but then there was a lot

01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:38.360
of stuff recently that he's done that's just weird, and just spreading conspiracy theories

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.360
and stuff like that.

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:43.520
And I don't understand where there's a place for that.

01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:46.920
And then, of course, there's the personal drama they went through, and then the drama

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:47.920
at E3.

01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:52.240
And I think what Twitch is trying to do right now is get away from all the drama, and there's

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:59.320
been a lot of bans with folks that have been accused of different misconduct stuff.

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:03.720
So I don't know if it's just because of all the other things.

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:06.540
Who knows what the specific thing is this time.

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:09.660
And there's also, on the flip side of that, there's a lot of people that probably should

01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:13.340
have been banned, and haven't been banned.

01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:21.100
I don't really care about the drama because I'm here for the games, so it's unfortunate

01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:26.580
if you're a fan of his, and he's off the air, and you'll just have to wait for him to say

01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:32.020
what the reason is behind it, and hey, I hear that Facebook Gaming's looking for some brand

01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:34.780
new faces for their platform, so you know.

01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:35.780
Perfect.

01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:39.660
But he couldn't go by, he'd have to use his real name on Facebook Gaming.

01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:40.660
Perfect.

01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:42.180
Put that over there.

01:52:42.180 --> 01:52:43.180
Perfect.

01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:46.180
There's so much drama out there, and I get it that we're all bored at home and stuff

01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:54.980
like that, but I just, you know, the character's fine, and it's just all the other drama that's

01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.620
around with it that I just don't really care for it.

01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:05.400
I've got a limited amount of time in my day, and I'd rather watch someone that's more entertaining.

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:12.880
There are hundreds of other streamers, thousands of other streamers that can fill time, and

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:20.440
I'm sure you will enjoy watching as much as you enjoyed this guy, but I was not a fan,

01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:24.560
so I just, okay, he's gone.

01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:25.560
Cool.

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:26.560
All right.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:27.560
Anyway, sorry.

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.560
I'm such a dick tonight.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.560
I'm sorry, guys.

01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:30.920
Like, it's supposed to be a happy night.

01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:33.480
We're turning 18, but oh well.

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:34.480
All right.

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:37.040
Anyway, let's get to our next email, which is from Brad.

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:42.320
I appreciate the question that you asked us, and again, I'm not trying to be a jerk to

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:43.320
you.

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:45.040
Everybody likes what they like, whatever.

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:49.040
I just never understood why this guy was popular, but maybe I'm just old.

01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:52.480
Maybe one of those people's like, I don't understand why the kids today listen to this

01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.480
rock music.

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.720
It's just, maybe I'm hitting that point in my life.

01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:56.720
I don't know.

01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:00.800
Anyway, moving on to our next email, last email from Brad.

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:06.160
I believe this is our buddy Brad from PodCulture, who says, congrats on hitting 18, y'all.

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:07.560
This is one hell of a milestone.

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.440
You guys have been a part of my Sunday nights for so many years now.

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:14.560
I can't count the number of games and hours of fun that I've had because of something

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.240
I've heard about on your show.

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:20.360
You guys were the key inspiration for doing my own show with friends, and it was a huge

01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:23.840
honor to have been asked for that same show to be a part of VOG.

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:27.940
Had it not been for the family that has grown around your show and Bobby's, certain dark

01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:31.160
times in my life would have been a lot darker and probably would have not have turned out

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:33.960
as positive as they did, and I'm still humbled by that.

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:34.960
Thank you.

01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:38.200
It is great having y'all around as part of my Sunday night routine.

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:41.540
Here is looking forward to another 18 or more.

01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:42.540
Peace Brad.

01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:49.840
Well, if we go for 18 more years, I'll be 60 years old, so that'll be something.

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.780
But thank you for those kind words.

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:52.780
I'm glad we could help.

01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:58.220
I'm glad you're part of the family, and I welcome everybody that is here to treat others

01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:04.220
with respect and just have fun, kind of like what Loki said, honestly.

01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:08.160
Just have fun playing games and leave the drama.

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:12.940
I'm not into, and Bobby said it in chat too, and I remember a day at a time when fighting

01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:18.840
with other streamers and other broadcasters and stuff was funny, and it's not funny.

01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:21.020
We need to be lifting each other up because you know what?

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:25.760
Do you know how often podcasters are the butt of jokes in this day and age and all that stuff?

01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.520
It's like, we need to be working together to get past some of that crap and not bringing

01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:31.520
each other down.

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.840
So that's that.

01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:33.840
All right.

01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:36.920
Anyway, moving on.

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.080
That's it for emails.

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.480
We encourage more emails in future weeks.

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.400
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:46.200
Again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:49.200
Meanwhile, we have a few more stories for you.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:50.200
Loki.

01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.140
All right.

01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:57.300
So speaking of, we were talking a little bit about Facebook gaming earlier, well, another

01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:03.620
portion of Facebook is dedicated to Oculus, and Oculus has decided that they're going

01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:13.740
to be discontinuing the Oculus Go, which was their first foray to the wireless self-contained

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:14.740
VR platforms.

01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:19.140
Of course, now you may remember they have the Oculus Quest, which is just better all

01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:20.320
around.

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:25.280
And so unfortunately, they said they will, it'll still receive security packages and

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:30.540
bug fixes through 2022, but they're not shipping any new features starting now.

01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:34.440
And they will update the storefront after December 18th of this year.

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.400
Isn't this kind of just like a logical thing like, oh, we're not selling Windows 7 anymore

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:43.520
because now there's Windows 10 and we'll support Windows 7 for a little bit, but it's someday

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:45.400
we're going to pull the plug on that.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.400
It's just that kind of thing.

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:52.580
There's now this unit that does essentially the same thing.

01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:55.660
So go get that one.

01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:56.660
Pretty much.

01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:57.660
Yeah.

01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:58.660
And I mean, it makes sense.

01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:02.940
There's more, there's better hardware, more features that are in the Oculus Quest.

01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:06.980
It's just harder to probably support this older system when they're trying to push people

01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:09.220
to a better platform.

01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:14.640
So I mean, that's tech for you.

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:18.000
You know what Facebook should do with Oculus though?

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.060
They should sell it to somebody else and not have it anymore.

01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:24.220
And this is not me being one of those, why did Facebook buy Oculus?

01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:26.460
I completely understand why Facebook bought Oculus.

01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:30.340
I just say, again, Facebook, Facebook needs less, not more.

01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:35.100
And I don't, if certain things are to, you know, that maybe they are going to look at

01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:38.860
antitrust stuff on Facebook, I bet Facebook will be under pressure to unload.

01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.980
I don't know if Oculus would be one of the things, but I bet Instagram, because remember

01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:44.180
when they bought Instagram, that was a huge deal too.

01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:47.320
I bet they would be under a lot of pressure to unload Instagram.

01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:49.240
So we'll see how that goes.

01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:50.240
Anyway, sorry.

01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:52.760
That's me being an old bitchy man again.

01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:56.180
But and no shade on Oculus.

01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:57.840
I'm glad it exists and so forth.

01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.440
I just don't like their owners.

01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:01.320
All right.

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:02.320
Let's move on.

01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:03.840
Hey, this is some good news.

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.560
I have no complaints about this.

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:06.960
This is a great story.

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:13.160
It's a Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for one was a underrated gem on the GameCube because

01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:17.660
so few people actually bothered to hook up the Game Boy advances and play it all that

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:18.660
way.

01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:21.560
But those that did do it have fond memories of doing so.

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:24.980
So it's pretty exciting that it's going to get a second life on the Switch.

01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:30.960
And what I think is awesome, it was just announced that when the game launches on August 27th,

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:35.640
there will be a free demo available for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:38.820
It will have three free dungeons as a part of the demo.

01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:40.660
So you can just try that out.

01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:48.600
But if you team up with somebody that has the full game, you can actually go to 13 dungeons

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:50.660
without having to buy anything extra.

01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:54.760
So it opens up a lot more to explore in the demo version.

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:59.700
So it's an interesting kind of compromise between having everything and having just

01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:00.700
a little bit.

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:03.720
It's like, oh, you get a little more if a friend has the game.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:10.400
And that definitely like throws back to like the DS era, which again, I know this is more

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.140
like a GameCube Game Boy Advance thing, but the DS wasn't far behind.

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:18.500
And remember when we could like beam demos of games or like one person has the DS game

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:21.920
and they could beam it to others and everybody could kind of connect that way.

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:27.740
So it kind of like had the window for the Wii and the DS Crystal Chronicles.

01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:29.860
Yeah.

01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:30.860
Did they?

01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:33.600
I thought they like announced it, but it never went anywhere.

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:34.600
I'm sorry.

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:35.600
It was chock chock.

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:36.600
Well, mystery dungeon.

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:37.600
Yeah.

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:38.600
Same concept where they had it.

01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:39.600
Yes, that's right.

01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:41.900
So, uh, yeah.

01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:46.180
And, uh, Orange Right says it's too bad download play isn't built into the Switch, but isn't

01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:48.900
it interesting how we're seeing games kind of use it anyway?

01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.820
Because Clubhouse Games is another one that's doing this.

01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:56.180
And then, uh, Pac-Man Versus, I think had that player or like it was a Namco collection

01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:58.580
that had Pac-Man Versus in it and you could get the player.

01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:02.200
It was really early on in the Switch's life because I think I remember grabbing it for

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.500
Dragon Con or something.

02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:04.500
Yeah.

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:08.300
I think for the reason why download play isn't really a thing on the Switch is because the

02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:14.240
ROM sizes are much larger and like a portable system, like the DS and the 3DS versus the

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:20.560
stuff that's in the Switch, whereas the Switch, it's not, it's not huge, but to beam all that

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:25.800
stuff over there, it's just not feasible to do it super quick.

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:26.800
Yeah.

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:30.100
It would be pretty heavy on network traffic, but it is kind of neat that you can still

02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:33.360
like, you know, you download the local copy and then you're able to do this stuff.

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:35.360
I think that's going to be great for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.700
I look forward to playing it.

02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.880
So yeah.

02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:41.420
I remember playing it a little bit, but I never got very far because how many people

02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:42.420
had that whole setup?

02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:46.180
I had an X that had the Game Boy Advance, that whole thing, so I could play with him,

02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:48.380
but like we only ever played like two or three times.

02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:49.380
So anyway.

02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:50.380
All right.

02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:51.380
Moving on.

02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:52.380
A few more stories for you.

02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:53.380
Loki.

02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:54.380
All right.

02:00:54.380 --> 02:01:00.940
And so we know about the Xbox Series X and what to kind of expect there.

02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:07.960
What we don't know about is some of these leaks and information coming out about some

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:13.080
sort of system called a code name Lockhart, which the thought is it's going to be a

02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:16.680
lower powered version of the Xbox Series X.

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:20.640
Some are thinking that it's going to be like an Xbox Series S, whereas, you know, we have

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:27.200
the Xbox One S as well, that could be maybe an only digital system or a system that may

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:32.500
be dedicated to just current gen Xbox One games.

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:36.820
No words on exactly what that's going to be, but we know that there's some information

02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:44.060
based on the X2K and GDK release notes for June 2020 that reference the Lockhart profiling

02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:45.060
and stuff.

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:49.360
And it lists these different dev kit.

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:51.380
It kind of refers back to that.

02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:58.500
So I guess we'll find out later on what that means.

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.740
I don't know.

02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.480
Very interesting.

02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:04.960
I guess we'll find out in July because that's where we're supposed to get everything on

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.720
the table about Xbox Series X.

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:08.980
So some of these rumors will be addressed then.

02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:13.420
And I think now most people are kind of anticipating Microsoft will end up being the cheaper console

02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:15.080
one way or another.

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:21.200
The question is just how cheap does it end up and what do the features kind of look like

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.200
versus the other?

02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:25.460
Because we know PlayStation five, there's disc and there's no disc.

02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:28.700
Like you can, you know, otherwise they're probably going to be the same thing.

02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:30.260
Microsoft, who knows?

02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:33.460
Could one rely more on cloud gaming or so these other things that you're talking about

02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:37.300
it maybe, you know, won't be there and it'll be, it'll be interesting.

02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:41.520
Plus something else to consider your Xbox One is still going to play a lot of stuff.

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.340
So maybe it takes some of the pressure off of upgrading pretty fast.

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:45.340
I don't know.

02:02:45.340 --> 02:02:47.820
It's, it's, it's interesting, but I do feel like we're going to get all the answers pretty

02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:48.820
soon.

02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:49.820
Yeah.

02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:50.820
We'll see.

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.440
I'm waiting for more announcements.

02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.880
We've got, was it that event coming in July?

02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:57.680
So pretty soon, next couple of weeks.

02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:01.160
She Hulk 10 and chat says they should be giving out these consoles for free.

02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:07.960
Well, let's not forget Microsoft did toy with the whole like cell phone style Xbox at one

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:08.960
point.

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:12.800
And what I mean by that, only through those Microsoft retail centers, which don't exist

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:13.800
anymore.

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:14.800
Don't exist anymore.

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:15.800
But you never know.

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.800
They might partner with Facebook or something.

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:17.800
No.

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:18.800
They'll partner with somebody.

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:19.800
Yikes.

02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:23.940
They'll partner with somebody maybe to offer the whole like subsidized.

02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:27.420
If you get a certain year subscription to gold path.

02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:35.100
I don't, I I'm being a little silly, but I we've seen the consoles try to take what works

02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:37.980
for cell phones and make it work for them.

02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:41.380
That part doesn't really seem to be stopping.

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:42.380
So it'd be interesting.

02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:43.380
Right?

02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:44.380
Yeah.

02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:45.380
It'll be interesting to see what they announce.

02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:47.980
I mean, we'll know hopefully soon enough.

02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:48.980
Absolutely.

02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:50.160
All right.

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:52.560
One more story here before we get to the last minute stuff and listen to round table.

02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:56.800
If you guys have any questions or comments for us in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog

02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.960
network, by all means, uh, say hello, ask your question.

02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:02.520
And this one is, is kind of a, is this really news?

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:05.520
We knew this was going to happen, but it is official.

02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:11.360
The super Nintendo world theme park opening at universal studios in Japan will be delayed.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.760
You want to guess why?

02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:13.760
Yep.

02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:15.220
It's COVID-19.

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:21.640
So super Nintendo world will not be opening, even though universal studios in Japan opened

02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:26.120
to visitors once again on June 8th, cause you know, in other places, believe it or not,

02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:31.480
in a lot of other countries, they got COVID a little more under control than they do here.

02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:35.880
So there's that, um, not to say it's completely under control, but they have a little more

02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:36.880
under control.

02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:41.160
So Japan opened up theme parks again with precautions on June 8th.

02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:46.300
But super Nintendo world is not going to be opening, uh, as a result, uh, right away.

02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:51.960
Uh, and so they've delayed the Nintendo area opening until later.

02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:54.900
And no, uh, it was, it was going to be late July.

02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:56.420
We don't know the new date now.

02:04:56.420 --> 02:05:01.740
Um, and it's because of course, when they open this new land, they're anticipating,

02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:04.840
they're going to get more visitors that are wanting to check out the new land.

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:08.660
And right now they don't want a flood of visitors because social distancing is still supposed

02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:09.660
to be a thing.

02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:13.000
They actually want to keep attendance down at a manageable levels.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.400
In fact, right now, only people can visit the theme park if you live in the surrounding

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:18.760
Kansai region.

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:22.520
Uh, and so it's really cut the number of visitors way, way down.

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:26.260
Um, otherwise super Nintendo world is pretty much finished.

02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:32.480
So once COVID is taken care of, we have vaccine, effective treatment, herd immunity, whatever

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.920
it is that takes care of this thing at the end of the day, uh, super Nintendo world will

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.640
be like ready to open.

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:42.100
Uh, and, uh, that means when air travel can resume again, so you can go to Japan and all

02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:43.100
that stuff.

02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:45.220
I'm just waiting for them to open up in Hollywood.

02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:48.860
Um, cause they know they're working on it over there too, or at least they're supposed

02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:54.580
to be at some point, 2022 super Nintendo land was really supposed to open in tandem with

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:58.460
the Tokyo Olympics and it was supposed to be like, well, not in tandem, but you know

02:05:58.460 --> 02:05:59.460
what I mean?

02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:00.460
Like still will.

02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:01.460
Yeah.

02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:02.460
Well, yeah.

02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:04.180
Now with the Olympics being postponed to next year, maybe it still will.

02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:05.180
So there is that.

02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:10.600
Uh, and yeah, as Joe 100, Matt points out in chat, Disneyland delayed their opening.

02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:13.280
Can't imagine Disney world will open on time either.

02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:14.280
Yep.

02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:17.880
Um, you know, I know a lot of people are, are crapping on the theme park opening stuff

02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:24.120
and you know, precautions are very important and uh, you just have to wear the damn mask,

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:25.240
wear the damn mask.

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:29.040
If people, and that, that's why this country is having a problem where, where, where are

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:34.700
all these crazy people at trader Joe's and uh, whole foods that are screaming at the

02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:38.540
camera and screaming at people about how masks are a president stuff in other countries.

02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:43.660
It's not happening in other countries because other countries, they just wear the masks

02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:44.660
here.

02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:45.660
They don't do it.

02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:47.060
And that's why we're not going anywhere.

02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:52.900
I would argue it has very little to do with certain reopenings.

02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:56.260
They've already proved the protest to not have the impact because people at protests

02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.000
wear their, wore their goddamn masks.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.320
And there were people at protests who were dedicated to handing out masks to those that

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.320
didn't have them.

02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:04.320
And you didn't have those crazy people at the protest.

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.160
They didn't belong.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:07.320
It's that's, that's it.

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:08.800
You want to know why COVID is still around.

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.800
Look at the people in those videos.

02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:15.080
Anyway, I've gone on too many rents tonight.

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:16.080
Sorry.

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:17.960
We're, we're up for our listener round table.

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:21.360
If you'd like to participate with our show, if you have any questions or anything for

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.440
us in chat, go for it.

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:27.300
Otherwise, I will look to my cohost, Loki, to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:30.180
I thought there were a few things we didn't get to yet.

02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:33.020
There's a couple of things that also weren't on the show roll.

02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:38.980
So there's one thing that someone has developed a brand new exploit for the PlayStation 2

02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:44.700
that allows you to play homebrew discs on the system without any mods needing to be

02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:46.180
done to the system.

02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:47.660
No USB keys, nothing.

02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:55.560
It is just a way to burn a disc that'll actually play it on the system without any problems.

02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:56.560
Pretty amazing.

02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:04.040
It's a free DVD boot and it exploits, I guess, the DVD playing portion of the PlayStation

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:09.060
2, which sadly rules out my PlayStation 2 because the DVD drive, I think, is broken

02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:10.780
on it.

02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:16.360
But apparently it causes the, it triggers a corruption in video playback and then runs

02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:20.260
the game through that security hole.

02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:26.420
Pretty crazy that we're developing this stuff already, but yeah.

02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:27.540
So there's that.

02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:31.480
And then one other thing I was going to mention is there's some possible leaks about what

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:34.720
the announcements are going to be at Evo this year.

02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:39.220
So some of the announcements, including a Marvel versus Capcom Invitational, they're

02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:43.820
going to announce a collection that includes X-Men, Children of the Atom, all the way

02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:46.600
through Marvel versus Capcom 2.

02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:49.920
I guess kind of similar to what we had with the Arcade 1-Up cabinets, but just like in

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:50.920
the collection.

02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:58.100
They were saying that they're going to announce Fei Long, Alina, and some new character who's

02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:01.840
a Grilla member of the Neo-Chadaloo.

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:09.360
And some additional announcements, Tekken 7, Christy Montanaro, Dr. I can't pronounce

02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:14.060
the name, Vakskonovich, and a guest character, Kamen Rider 01.

02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:15.060
Neat.

02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:22.260
Before we get to another story, since you brought up Arcade 1-Up, guess what email I

02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:23.940
just got a couple hours ago?

02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:28.060
I got an email from UPS saying I have a package coming tomorrow and somebody needs to be here

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.500
to sign for it.

02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:30.500
It's very heavy.

02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:31.500
Oh boy.

02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:32.500
Coming from Los Angeles.

02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:37.420
So I have to decide if I want to do like a stream of putting that together or not.

02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:38.420
I don't know.

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:40.480
Because it's like IKEA.

02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:44.100
Well I feel like the only time Alan and I really, really, truly fight is when we're

02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:45.760
trying to put together furniture.

02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:48.740
So that might be the type of thing we don't want to broadcast.

02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:49.960
So we'll see.

02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:50.960
I don't know.

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:51.960
I have to see how hard it is first.

02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:55.560
I need to go back and watch Bobby's video when he got a Star Wars cabinet and see how

02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:57.720
difficult of an undertaking it's going to be.

02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:59.440
But I'm really excited that that's showing up.

02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:03.680
And again, if you don't know, I bought myself a birthday present because my birthday was

02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:07.480
this last week and they just, like the timing of the shipment just worked out.

02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:13.220
I got one of the limited edition, I think there's only like 3000 or 3000 and change,

02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:15.500
Burger Time arcade 1UP machines.

02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:17.100
So I get to find out what number I am too.

02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:18.100
That'll be fun too.

02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:19.100
Ooh.

02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:20.100
Yeah.

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:21.100
Ooh.

02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:22.100
Very fun.

02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:23.100
Cool.

02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:24.100
Ooh, wow.

02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:25.940
Bobby said it took four hours to put that thing together.

02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:26.940
My gosh.

02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:27.940
All right.

02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:28.940
I like fun.

02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:29.940
Let me get some other questions from chat.

02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:30.940
Okay.

02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:31.940
Bobby says don't stream it.

02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:32.940
It takes too long.

02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:33.940
Okay.

02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:34.940
Fair enough.

02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:35.940
Let's see.

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:41.040
Who says there are so many great games on the market and so little time, how do you

02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:44.840
guys choose what game to play and finish?

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:45.840
Good question.

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:49.880
You know, a lot of times a game just kind of has to hold my attention long enough for

02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:53.320
another game to not come in and eclipse it.

02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:58.160
And then has to hope that the social games that I play, like the MMOs online also don't

02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:01.080
knock it out of me paying attention to it either.

02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:03.520
And it's one of those easier said than done sort of things.

02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:08.940
Like I have really bad attention span issues when it comes to video games.

02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:12.780
So when I do take the time to sit down and really finish a video game, play it start

02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:16.900
to finish, something like the Final Fantasy 7 Remake is probably the most recent one.

02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:19.200
I think that really is a compliment to the game.

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:23.260
And usually it's like I have to know what happens in the story or I just, I need to

02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:29.500
see what, how this turns out or it's a franchise that I've been a fan of for a long time or

02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:30.500
what have you.

02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:31.500
I don't know.

02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:33.500
Loki, how do you pick and choose?

02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:40.760
It's just whatever holds my interest and a lot of times it's just, I've got so many

02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:41.840
to play.

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:47.320
So yeah, it could be whatever holds my interest or what people are playing at that given time,

02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:50.680
if I want to get in on that stuff.

02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:51.680
I don't know.

02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:57.720
I know I have a huge library of things I haven't gotten around to playing and we're in Steam

02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.320
Summer Sale time and I'm still getting things.

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:08.060
So you know, yeah, I looked at the Steam Summer Sale as well and like, thankfully I resisted

02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:09.060
so far.

02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:13.900
I'm kind of like, all right, I've, I've got plenty of games, plenty of games.

02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:17.760
I can never sit here and go, I have nothing to play because I still, there's that itch

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:18.760
IO bundle.

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.180
I'll never run out of things to play.

02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:25.220
So it's just a matter of just what grabs my attention.

02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:27.100
What in the moment says, Oh, this is shiny.

02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:28.520
I want to check this out.

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:30.040
And that's, that's really what it is.

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:34.480
So yeah, there's a lot of games, like a lot of VR games I've been looking at.

02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:35.880
I'm like, Ooh, I want to get that.

02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:37.880
And then I'm like, when am I really going to play that?

02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:43.200
Or, you know, just things that, Oh yeah, you know, that's on my wishlist.

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:46.280
Maybe actually, and no, I'm not going to play it.

02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.920
I'm still going to get it, but I'm not going to play it.

02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:51.920
SSJ100Matt says, did we talk about Rogue Legacy 2?

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:54.160
I forgot that announcement trailer came out this week.

02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.160
No, we didn't yet.

02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:56.960
I'm, I'm, I'll check that out.

02:12:56.980 --> 02:12:58.300
I think it's interesting too.

02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:00.440
I saw it kind of like the discussion in discord about that.

02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.700
It's using the whole, like, it costs less money if you buy it early.

02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:08.220
Uh, and then it'll cost more money by the time it actually comes out.

02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:11.140
Cause it's kind of like they're, they're taking some of the money out.

02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:13.460
Cause you're kind of effectively beta testing it in a way.

02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:14.420
Uh, and so that's it.

02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:17.900
I mean, heck Minecraft was the same way when it, wasn't it cheap when it was first

02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:21.560
out and then when they like finally were like, okay, Minecraft's a real game.

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.320
Now they kind of bumped up the price, another $10, I think.

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:26.500
So maybe that was just cause Microsoft bought it.

02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:28.280
I don't know, but, uh, yeah.

02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:29.840
And, and some other comments and chat.

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:31.660
Attica was cheaper on early access.

02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:32.160
Yeah.

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.380
So, uh, Rogue Legacy 2 is doing that.

02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:35.800
I thought the first one was great.

02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:36.620
I really enjoyed it.

02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:40.960
I'm kind of surprised it took this long for them to announce a second one, but

02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:44.840
maybe it's, you know, games don't, games don't show up overnight.

02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:47.800
It's probably just taken a while to develop and now it's ready to be shown.

02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:48.720
So that's exciting.

02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:51.520
I was really one of the first like rogue likes.

02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:54.720
I remember really playing when that genre really started to take off.

02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:57.240
I think it was an early PlayStation plus game or something.

02:13:58.920 --> 02:13:59.420
Yeah.

02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:00.380
All right.

02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:00.880
Anything else?

02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:03.000
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:07.580
As far as, uh, news I had, um, I, well, I'm probably gonna end up doing it.

02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:11.260
At some point is going through, I like to sort by least expensive and

02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:12.540
see what they have offering there.

02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:16.260
I did that on the eShop the other week and I got a, I got a game for a penny.

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:16.940
Oh yeah.

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:20.900
You were mentioning buying games for like 9 cents a penny.

02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:21.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:22.060
That's fun.

02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:23.100
Yeah.

02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:24.240
I have some of my kids to play.

02:14:25.220 --> 02:14:25.720
All right.

02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.640
Well, I guess with that, we're going to move to wrap up the show.

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:32.720
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show this week,

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:34.600
or maybe you were listening live on Twitch.

02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:37.360
Thank you guys for your support over 18 years.

02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:40.140
Um, and you know, we're gonna, we're gonna keep on going.

02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:43.480
I hope you guys liked some of the little, little flourishes we added to the show

02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:45.200
tonight, just to keep things fun.

02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:48.680
Uh, not just on Twitch, but on the podcast feed as well.

02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:50.880
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Islands Radio,

02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:52.080
please help us spread the word.

02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:55.640
Uh, we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to

02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:58.360
put out on the air, then we're missing something.

02:14:58.360 --> 02:14:59.760
So we need to get more voices here.

02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:02.840
So help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:07.360
Um, the, that word of mouth goes an awfully long, an awfully long way.

02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:10.360
Auto hosts on Twitch are also amazing.

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:12.760
And we really appreciate those when you can set those up.

02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:13.680
Uh, so thank you.

02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:15.400
Thank you to everybody who hosts us on Twitch.

02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:18.240
Uh, thank you to all the new followers and the bit donations and all that.

02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:20.960
I'll read those after the show, after the credits, um, since we

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.320
are taping for the podcast feed.

02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.520
And I appreciate those of you listening on the podcast as well.

02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:25.840
Drop us an email sometime.

02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:28.920
Say hi, uh, participate at orangelandsradio.com.

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.640
We also welcome the tweets at OLR.

02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:34.160
So if you want to send us tweets, we do read those as well.

02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:37.120
Um, with that, I think we are to final thoughts.

02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:38.720
Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:45.040
Uh, my final thought is I need to play something other than Minecraft,

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.560
but probably not going to happen.

02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:50.600
Maybe I'll play one of these games that are on the, uh, on my Steam library.

02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:52.440
All right.

02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.960
Uh, my final thought is happy pride, black lives still matter.

02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:01.280
I really like that new, uh, redesign of the pride flag with the Chevron,

02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:04.760
with the other colors in it to represent trans and, uh, people of color.

02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:05.760
I think that's great.

02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:10.040
Um, and, um, as far as video games are concerned, I'm looking forward

02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:12.400
to getting into more, probably actually putting in some hours on

02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:14.480
Xenoblade this week, cause I didn't put in a lot last week.

02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:19.800
Um, and I'm looking forward to, um, playing more this, uh, next week.

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:20.560
Try to diversify.

02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:22.560
I want to play a little more of the messenger cause that game was fun too.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.880
So we'll be back in seven days to, um, to talk about what we've been doing

02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:32.160
in the week and recap the gaming news as we get closer and closer to more

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:35.760
console reveals and all that fun stuff for what we can expect in the holiday.

02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:37.080
So be safe, everybody.

02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:38.920
We'll see you in seven days.

02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:39.880
Have a wonderful night.

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:40.240
Good night.

02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:43.840
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:48.160
