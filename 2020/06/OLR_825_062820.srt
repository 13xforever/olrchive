00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,240
This week, Orange Lounge Radio has turned 18, new media, works in progress, same great

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,240
hosts.

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,440
It's been a contentious week in gaming news, but we have a little bit of everything to

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
discuss.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,240
The march to the next generation of gaming consoles, sequels, sequels of series past,

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,560
even more remasters of truly underrated titles, time travel, the multiverse, and plenty more.

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,920
Don't take my word for it.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,400
Here are your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki on the show where every gamer has

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
a voice.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,460
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,640
where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:56,800
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 825 of our show for this June

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,880
the 28th of 2020.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,120
Do not be alarmed, do not adjust your televisions, do not adjust your radios, yes, there's been

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
a few changes.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,640
A little fresh coat of paint to celebrate 18 years of doing Orange Lounge Radio.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,800
So we had a brand new, and the Twitch viewers, because we do tape live every Sunday night

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,320
at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,800
Bobby Black Wolf show.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,000
The Twitch viewers are seeing some videos, so we used to have some static images and

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,080
now we've kind of replaced those with videos.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,520
And most notably, which you're going to hear on the podcast feed and you're going to hear

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,440
on Twitch is you're going to hear that brand new intro.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,040
So the old intro, we're very thankful to Midi Head who did some stuff for DDR and Beat Media

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,120
back in the day.

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Thank you so much.

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,440
We've been using that intro for a very long time, but you know, it's been like 14, 15

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
years.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
So it was time for a fresh coat of paint.

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,460
And this intro is very special because wait until I tell you who did the new intro.

31
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,640
The new intro was done by my co-loser.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,320
My co-host Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers, accomplished musician.

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Hi, Jamie.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
How are you?

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
I'm okay.

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,560
I just played around and oops, I pooped an intro.

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,880
No, it sounds great.

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,200
And when I first heard it, you've had many different iterations of that.

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,960
When I first heard it, I was like, okay, this isn't like, this isn't like quite as like,

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,720
you know how like the old intro is very like, it's time to begin the show, you know?

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
And that's a compliment.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,160
And this one's very light and airy and fantasy and I was kind of like, it kind of reminds

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,840
me of like a Five Key Beat Mania song, which is a nice little like throwback, which I thought

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
was really cool.

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Yeah.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,160
Well, and thank you for the compliments guys.

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:47,520
I just, I've been learning Logic Pro X and I'm really enjoying it.

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,760
It's just, and I just started playing around with like a few things, you know, cause I'm

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,480
still kind of a beginner at it.

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,600
But as I got through it, I was like, okay.

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,840
And then I just picked out some like weird stuff on there.

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,360
Like some of that really synthy stuff was actually organ music that I changed instruments

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
on in the MIDI.

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,960
And I really just liked how it turned out.

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,440
So I'm like, hey, listen to this.

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,080
Hey, listen.

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm surrounded by accomplished musicians because Dark Sakura of course did that theme and joining

58
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,120
me of course every week.

59
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
By the way, my name is Rob Roberts.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,920
I don't know if I said that, but hi.

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,320
But joining me every week of course is tech master, Loki.

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Hi Loki.

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,880
I haven't done anything in a long time.

64
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,880
I know, but you used to, now this is a throwback and a lot of our like more recent listeners

65
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,520
probably have no idea about this, but you used to do remixes like mashups.

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,080
Like what do they, what do they, what do they call that club?

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,880
Is it booty or whatever it's called in San Francisco where they do the mashups?

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Like you used to do a lot of that type of stuff on OLR and you just haven't done one

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
in a while.

70
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Yeah.

71
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,840
A friend of mine is a DJ there.

72
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Yeah.

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,840
And meanwhile, me, I played the clarinet in high school, but like that's about as far

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,080
as that's, but that's as far as my music goes, like I've tried, I, uh, I got this application

75
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
on steam in a recent sale.

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,000
It's called rhythmic and it's a good, it's a good, like it's a good sequencer.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,160
Like there's nothing, nothing negative against this application.

78
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,200
I think, you know, if I, if I was able to construct anything, it would be in this application,

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
but I'm just such a boob when it comes to that stuff.

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,520
I don't know what I'm doing.

81
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,920
Like, so I need, I guess I need to start somewhere.

82
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,560
I don't know.

83
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
Everyone has to start somewhere.

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
There's always a learning curve when you're trying something new.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
True.

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,280
Now, if you want to see me do complete and utter failure, watch me try to figure stuff

87
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,440
out and in final cut, I can't move.

88
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm I've made my first actual movie thing in final cut and it's of Midna being stupid.

89
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Lovely.

90
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,440
Two are new theme song by the way.

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,540
Well, I didn't use final cut.

92
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,420
I didn't use, I got to say, I didn't use an Apple product for any of the movies tonight.

93
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Except there is one exception.

94
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,660
No, there is one exception.

95
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,900
I used a free software called light works to do a lot of the video editing, which has

96
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,780
worked very well.

97
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,860
But the smush intro that only the Twitch people see, if you've never watched us live on Twitch,

98
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,580
right after Bobby ends and we pick up, we usually have about a minute or two because

99
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,980
we're trying to get everything together and make sure our recording starting.

100
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,160
So it takes a minute or two for things to transition.

101
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,760
And we have a, it used to be a static image of Mr. Smush that would say, don't go anywhere.

102
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
We're coming right up.

103
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:30,320
Now, I built a montage in iMovie from pictures from my phone and exported that into light

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,720
works to put on the stuff I know how to do, like use my fonts and my image.

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,320
So I did, I did do that.

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,040
I did do one thing in iMovie.

107
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,640
So this is, this is truly a buy.

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,460
We love all computer products.

109
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,980
We embrace them all because it's like trying to hold, it's like trying to hold something

110
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
together before it breaks.

111
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,380
You put a little duct tape there.

112
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,620
You put a little string here.

113
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,180
One of these days, I'm going to sit you down and teach you motion.

114
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,180
Okay.

115
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,180
Sounds good.

116
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,660
That, that splash thing that I did with the interesting animations on it before, like

117
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,460
the teaser I made, that was all made in motion.

118
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,460
Oh, nice.

119
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,460
Oh yeah.

120
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,680
It's if you've used flash before motion is easy.

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,960
I was going to say also speaking of art, we are debuting brand new album art this week

122
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,180
that everybody's going to see.

123
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,440
And that is also you, you actually, to be fair, you did that like five months ago.

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,000
It was, it was supposed to be for episode 800 and for reasons and things didn't happen.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,120
And then COVID happened and it was like, well, and so the thought was, well, we'll sit on

126
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,240
all of this until we're all back under the same roof and it'll be like our big, like

127
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
up soft relaunch.

128
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,300
Here we go.

129
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,940
But now, unfortunately, you know, obviously the COVID thing's just getting worse in many

130
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,000
places and it seems more and more likely, you know, we're just going to have to stay

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,300
in separate locations, probably at least for the rest of the year, who knows, you know,

132
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,560
until it's safe and we will be listening to scientists on when it is safe.

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,700
And that's, that's, that's that on that.

134
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,060
And we just had an announcement here, at least in California, that six major counties are

135
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,820
having to close bars again, um, with us included.

136
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,100
And one of the bars that I think you and I have frequented quite a bit, um, I'm actually

137
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,820
friends with one of the general managers there and, um, they had an incident where someone

138
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,580
came in and they had no symptoms when they came in three days later, they were symptomatic

139
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,680
and thankfully called to tell them so, you know, which means that they were sick well

140
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,020
before they actually went into the club.

141
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
Yeah.

142
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,060
I haven't been to a bar since, um, before I went on that cruise was probably the last

143
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,660
time I was at a bar in Miami.

144
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,680
So, um, and I have no, like, that's, if we can't get together in the same house, I have

145
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,120
no interest in going to a bar because a bar is where you go so you don't have to meet

146
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
up at somebody's house.

147
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,420
So that I know I've done, I've done the restaurant thing and sometimes I felt very safe the most

148
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,560
recent time you missed it on last week's episode, I kind of went off, I did not feel great and

149
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,200
I will not go back to that restaurant even after this is over.

150
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,720
Um, but, uh, yeah, so, uh, but I have no interest in going to bars.

151
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,040
I actually don't think we're on the mandatory list, but we are in a recommended list.

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,520
There's like six mandatory, eight recommended, but regardless, we're on the mandatory.

153
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Are we?

154
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,600
Well, I thought we were double check, but yeah, I said at least six of them, Sacramento

155
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,240
County included, regardless, none of us are going to a bar anytime soon.

156
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I just don't see that.

157
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,560
I, I fussed at some of my fellow sisters quietly.

158
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Yeah.

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Because they did.

160
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
No, I know.

161
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
I know the one bar that's not downtown.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,520
I've heard has been hopping and I'm like, you, I, you couldn't pay me to go there right

163
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
now.

164
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
You could.

165
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Yeah.

166
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Yeah.

167
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
The, uh, if I'm right, the leather place.

168
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Okay.

169
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Yeah.

170
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
No, that, that's where they went.

171
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm still like, that place is so confined, but anyway, not to derail.

172
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Yes.

173
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
It is a video game show.

174
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,160
The place that has pinball machines.

175
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Let's get back to games.

176
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Actually.

177
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,000
Before we get back to games, I do want to acknowledge it has been 18 years of orange

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
launch radio.

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,960
We started this show on June 23rd, 2002.

180
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,640
So this past Tuesday we crossed having done this on a regular basis for 18 years on a

181
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,000
pretty much a weekly basis.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Sure.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,160
We've missed a show here and there, but for the most part, you know, we're putting out

184
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,080
40, 45 new shows a year, probably more.

185
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,860
Um, and, uh, that's more than most television shows.

186
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,140
That's more than most television shows put out.

187
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:30,980
Um, so, uh, you know, we've, this is a huge accomplishment for us and, um, I don't really

188
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,420
see any, you know, now that we have like a fresh coat of paint and all this other new

189
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,620
stuff, I don't see any signs of a slowing down anytime soon.

190
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,500
Um, I, I've just been very grateful for these on Sunday nights, especially in light of this

191
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,140
whole like COVID thing.

192
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,040
Um, you know, as much as it stinks that we can't all be in the same room, at least this

193
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
experience gives me something to kind of like look forward to.

194
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,160
And it's like, I have a reason to get out of bed today.

195
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,480
Like I know it's as dreary and as depressing as that sounds, it is still like a motivation

196
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
to like do something normal, if that makes sense in a non-normal world.

197
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Yeah.

198
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Yeah.

199
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Anyway.

200
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Well, and normal is relative.

201
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Yes.

202
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
So this is normal now.

203
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,240
Um, on a, on a much more lighthearted note, let me ask this, you know, for everybody,

204
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,540
what's kind of been like a great reward from having done this for 18 years?

205
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,440
Like what, what has been that motivation to keep going?

206
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,560
Cause that's, that's a question I get a lot is how do you keep motivated for 18 years

207
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
to do this?

208
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,520
And I'm, there's a part of me that's like, I wouldn't know what to do with my Sunday

209
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,280
nights without it.

210
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,560
It's like, it's like that, uh, waning Garth line where Garth goes, eventually it becomes

211
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,720
a part of you.

212
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,560
That's kind of like where OLR is in some ways.

213
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,320
But uh, what about for you guys, uh, Darcyra?

214
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Spite.

215
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Spite?

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,480
Well, seriously, that first few weeks of doing the show and there is like, you need to get

217
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,600
back in geeking.

218
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,040
Well guess what?

219
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,080
That was more when we went to a podcast and suddenly we had a much larger audience.

220
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
I never, well, I don't know.

221
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,800
Yeah, it was in the first few weeks of doing a podcast.

222
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah.

224
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,920
And that was, yeah, that was, uh, guess who's here and still podcasting and guess who's

225
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
probably still living in mama's basement.

226
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,400
Uh, Loki, I will read a basement bitch.

227
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Okay.

228
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,320
And guess who went back to the kitchen cause I'm in the kitchen.

229
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,480
Loki did get, get back in the kitchen where you belong.

230
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Loki, Loki.

231
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,200
What, what, uh, what about you?

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,960
What's been the reward to do this for 18 years for you?

233
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I don't know.

234
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,040
Just all the responses from people, um, you know, inspiring others to do their own shows

235
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,080
and just, I don't know, routine.

236
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Yeah.

237
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,280
Cause I get to talk about games cause no one else wants to hear about that except for my

238
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
kids.

239
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,360
And then, uh, but, uh, they talk about a lot about one game.

240
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,960
So I would like to say that this gives us an amazing platform for advocacy for gamers

241
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,400
who can't advocate for themselves.

242
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
True.

243
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,280
You know, we just a few weeks ago we spoke out on black lives matter.

244
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,120
We've spoken for, um, you know, the whole quilt bag spectrum as, as you call it, you

245
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,480
know, and for some of the lesser accepted sexualities.

246
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,060
So I mean, hello, I'm ace, hi, um, we've, um, we've all gone through some major changes

247
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:41,580
and the fact that we are basically quote, normal people living normal lives and do this

248
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
for others really.

249
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,580
And you know, for ourselves, cause hello, I am a little selfish.

250
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:53,780
We, I still see no reason to stop by as long as people love us, I will thrive on that.

251
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,340
Like a goddess living on her tributes.

252
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,080
And to be fair, we're not going to stop talking on any of those things anytime soon, no matter

253
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,740
what tweets we're getting.

254
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,020
So do, do look out for that.

255
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,300
Um, I get weird stuff once in a great while.

256
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,340
It's not, I, I let the positive outweigh the negative and the positive is far, far, far

257
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,340
more.

258
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
Um, let's see.

259
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,380
So SG 100 mountain chat says, yeah, I don't know what I used to do on Sunday nights before

260
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,380
this show.

261
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,780
And dark to see you says, yeah, I don't even remember my Sundays before OLR.

262
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
It's been so long.

263
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,660
Both of those comments from our Twitch chat at VOG network.

264
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,540
Um, yeah, like it's, it's, I think back to what was I doing on Sunday nights before?

265
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,580
Uh, I, we used to go to a club a lot that doesn't exist anymore.

266
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,300
It's like, yeah, it's a cold now.

267
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:48,220
No, I think, I think where the club was is the PetSmart actually, but it's, it's just,

268
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,580
it's a fricking strip mall now.

269
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,580
Do you remember we had my bachelorette party there and you, you came to my bachelorette

270
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,380
party, which was awesome.

271
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:04,140
And we had a bajillion jello shots that Jessica made and I made everybody watch Xanadu and

272
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,100
we started watching Barbarella and then we're like, Hey, let's go to the club.

273
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,980
So we went off to the rage.

274
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,220
I think I think I separated from the girls at that point.

275
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,980
Cause like something else is going on or something.

276
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,700
I think it would be funny though.

277
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,740
If, if Cole still did that Sunday night, I'll meet you down at housewares.

278
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
It's called be a party.

279
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:31,780
It's definitely, to answer my own question, it's definitely part of the routine thing

280
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,780
for me.

281
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,540
It's a great way to make sure I'm talking to Jamie and Matt at least once a week, if

282
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,500
not more often.

283
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,700
And you know, I think part of why I've really loved doing this is just meeting all of you

284
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,140
guys that are listeners and part of the show's family and interacting with you guys.

285
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,420
And it's really funny because, you know, as I've traveled to different cities, you know,

286
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,820
I used to have a job where I did a little more travel throughout the U S and I would

287
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,060
end up in all these different cities or I would go on vacation to different cities.

288
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,880
And I remember somebody close to me commenting once like Rob, it doesn't seem to matter where

289
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,520
you go in the country.

290
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,460
You always seem to know people in this city because you're always meeting up with somebody

291
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,500
for dinner or whatever it is.

292
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,380
And I'm kind of like, well, I mean, yeah, when you live on the internet, like I'm fortunate

293
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,220
through OLR and granted some other things I've done online, but mostly OLR, I have met

294
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,300
a network of awesome people online that, you know, I'm happy to call my friends and

295
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,000
hang out with IRL.

296
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,540
And I've done that when I've gone to places like New York, Chicago, you name it, I've

297
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,700
probably met somebody through OLR there.

298
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,060
Not that I'm going to meet just anybody in a deep dark corner.

299
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,620
These are people I've interacted with for a very long time and feel safe with.

300
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,140
I don't want people to get the wrong idea.

301
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,340
But like, I remember like New York, it was probably like 2006, there was a nice big chunk

302
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,220
of OLR listeners, probably like five or six.

303
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,700
And we all went to like a Dave and Buster's, it was like a little mini OLR con.

304
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,940
It was a lot of fun.

305
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,140
So and when I went back just recently, I was able to meet a couple people like YYR and

306
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Matt and Rama.

307
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,380
And, you know, it's still good to keep in touch with all my pals out there.

308
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,380
So it's great.

309
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,020
And I remember when I came out for a con.

310
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Yeah, we did something.

311
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,420
And then I drifted my Lancer going, yeah, it was anime.

312
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,580
I drifted my Lancer going on to Treasure Island because I was like, hey, let's go here.

313
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,020
That was pretty cool.

314
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
Yeah.

315
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
And frightening and very frightening.

316
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
So.

317
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,580
Uh, so yeah, I'm just, I'm thankful to everybody that's met and taken part in this and I really

318
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
do appreciate you guys.

319
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,460
And some of you guys just lurk and that's fine too.

320
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,300
You just, you're listening to the podcast feed and then we'll get an email out of the

321
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,020
blue like, oh yeah, I've been listening since like 2006 and I'll be like, who are you?

322
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,060
You never send an email or call or anything.

323
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
But I'm like, you know what?

324
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,980
I still appreciate this person for being a part of it.

325
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,100
So if you want to lurk, hey, that's fine too.

326
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Like I'm glad you've enjoyed what we've been putting out and that you all continue to listen

327
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
regularly.

328
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
So, all right.

329
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,540
Well, we are going to move on with the show and talk about what's going on in the video

330
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,300
game world and all the things we discuss every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

331
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,140
So let's get to our kickoff topic tonight, which I wish we had a quote unquote happier

332
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,220
thing to discuss.

333
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,460
But this is one of those.

334
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,900
We need to discuss it.

335
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,500
This is something the gaming industry is going through.

336
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,380
And like Jamie alluded to earlier, sometimes we have to address the difficult stuff too.

337
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,460
Let me turn it over to Jamie actually, I think is going to bring us up to speed on what's

338
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
going on.

339
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
Yeah.

340
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,580
And when they talk about an elephant in the room, this would be an elephant the size of

341
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,540
a kaiju, just saying.

342
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,340
It's pretty big and people have just been trying to ignore it forever.

343
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,980
But it's really come to a head.

344
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:46,540
Obviously, there are allegations against quite a number of, I'd say, prominent men in the

345
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,100
video game industry.

346
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,180
And it now looks like we have another instance added on top of it for sexual misconduct against

347
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:02,180
I'm going to mispronounce this guy's name, but Chris Avaloni, four women rose to accuse

348
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,420
him of sexual misconduct.

349
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:11,380
He's a acclaimed video game writer and a leading and actually one of the developers is working

350
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:19,980
with basically prompt what he departed ways with him, even though there was another game

351
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,860
in the work works.

352
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:30,940
And then there was another lady that accused Omid Daryani, who is the CEO of Online Performers

353
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,300
Group, which is a talent agency that works with streamers of making unwelcome sexual

354
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,860
advances.

355
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,220
And so Daryani resigned from his position on Sunday.

356
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,860
And then there's a lot of streamers who were planning on doing, I don't know if this was

357
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,380
this upcoming Wednesday, I'd have to double check.

358
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:58,860
I want to do a blackout for women on Twitch, which would basically the whole point of it

359
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:09,340
is to make them see that this is really, really just a prime platform for all kinds of harassment

360
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,420
to women streamers.

361
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:18,780
And you know, not just, you know, it's women of all backgrounds, a lot, they just haven't

362
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:28,420
really been doing a whole lot to help women who are gamers on Twitch, who are paying for

363
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,940
their platform to exist.

364
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,500
And you know, and looking just in the past, I mean, we had the, the whole gamer gate thing

365
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:46,260
before we had the, the harassment of Anita Sarkeesian, you know, and it was real harassment.

366
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,620
Several other, you know, people that I know, a couple of other podcasters to have been

367
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,220
harassed in any type of online game and a lot of a lot of us have been turning to online

368
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:04,860
gaming because we don't have really any other social circle right now to go out and participate

369
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,900
in.

370
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:16,420
One of the, one of the other women said that he went and told, you know, that, that Avaloni

371
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:26,460
went and told her that he never meant any harm, but you know, he was quoted saying if

372
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,900
I can't do anything to apologize for it, I understand that there's nothing more to be

373
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
done.

374
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Bullshit.

375
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,860
And the one who talked about her name is apparently Carissa, she's not giving her last name, was

376
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,380
really on top of this, has just been bringing it to attention and spoke with Bloomberg about

377
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,380
it too.

378
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:50,380
So she said that it happened when she met Avaloni at a convention in 2012 and then another

379
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,500
one in 2013 and then another third one who now works at a large company posted on Twitter

380
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,740
a screenshot of an explicit message that she received from him in 2013 when she was looking

381
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,140
to break into the industry.

382
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:09,420
And another fourth said that he groped her repeatedly at a nightclub in 2014 and he's

383
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,900
not saying anything about it.

384
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:19,820
And also Obsidian CEO who was working with him also didn't comment about it as well.

385
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,660
And then another thing that Carissa said is that he got her blackout drunk and tried to

386
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,940
rape her.

387
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,020
Drunk rape.

388
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,100
Which if you can't consent, it's rape, just saying.

389
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,420
And it's just absolutely disgusting.

390
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:44,700
You know, another game designer, Kristy Dana, also said that she went out on a drink and

391
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:52,380
he kept buying drinks for the group and then, you know, she passed out and woke up naked

392
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,660
next to him.

393
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,820
Again, that's rape.

394
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,060
If you can't consent, it is rape.

395
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
It's just really disgusting.

396
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,180
You know, it's absolutely disgusting.

397
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,420
And we've got more and more and more coming out because, you know, I think that we're

398
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,580
not post-Me Too.

399
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:18,780
We are constantly going to see it because it is time to not be quiet about this.

400
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:30,500
You know, I had advancements one year at E3, very, I'm not going to get into it, but it's

401
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:38,780
really not, it's like these guys here in this industry think that, oh, you know, you're

402
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,100
not going to make it very far without something I have to give you.

403
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,540
And it's kind of a casting couch situation, you know, oh, you want to get in it?

404
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:52,060
Well, you got to do something for me, some quid pro quo there, and no, that is not right.

405
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:59,140
You know, this, these garbage people need to be held accountable and have their balls

406
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,220
nailed to the wall, first of all, which I would pay to see done, just saying.

407
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,820
But they need to be held accountable.

408
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,660
This is unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable.

409
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,420
And I'm finally glad to see that there are more and more people speaking out against

410
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:22,500
it and naming names, put the proof out there, keep your receipts and post them.

411
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,560
It definitely feels like on Twitter, like there's just been a avalanche of these sorts

412
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,140
of reports and it's, it's, it's not surprising, but it's still depressing.

413
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,700
You know, it's kind of that situation.

414
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,300
It's kind of like, unfortunately, some people in power use that power for very crappy things.

415
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,940
And I think, you know, we're seeing that that has been some somewhat of a recurring theme

416
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,020
in 2020, just over and over again, people in power are using power for crappy things,

417
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,180
and the rest of us are not going to take it anymore.

418
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,580
And it's, it's, it's gross, obviously, you know, like Jamie, I'm, I'm glad that people

419
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:05,600
are being called out and we're setting a precedent and a rule that you should not be using your

420
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,340
power for this shitty behavior.

421
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,020
And I'm seeing, I'm seeing it everywhere on Twitter.

422
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:16,160
And it's, it's, it's, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's sad.

423
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
You know what I mean, Jamie?

424
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Right?

425
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,980
Like it's, it's one of those, like, I'm sad, but I'm not surprised.

426
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,760
I'm glad to see people are, you know, having to answer for these sorts of things, but at

427
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,240
the same time, gross, you know, you thought better of certain people and it's, it's, it's

428
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
a time.

429
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:40,080
Well, and there's another one, um, a PR person for Riot Games also shared an explicit text.

430
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,800
Um, and at the time she was trying to break in, so she forgave it, you know, but still

431
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:53,520
it's, it has to go public that this behavior is not right, no matter who does this to you.

432
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,600
Um, I, I'm glad to see this garbage now being held accountable for it and having difficulty

433
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,400
finding work and being pushed out of work.

434
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,900
And we need to do this with more people, you know, we need to do this with racists.

435
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,680
We need to do this with white supremacists.

436
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,640
We definitely need to do it with, um, definitely these sexual predators who are just pure garbage.

437
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:22,280
Um, you know, they, all of these garbage humans need to be held accountable.

438
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,940
End of story.

439
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,220
Call them out.

440
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,480
What can we do?

441
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
Well, not we.

442
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,080
I mean, I don't think we sitting here can do much to change Twitch, but what can Twitch

443
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,500
do to change Twitch in these, you talked about the blackout, which I actually think was this

444
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
past week.

445
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,760
I know there was a Twitch blackout that happened on, I think it was Wednesday.

446
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,840
Um, but I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a future protest forthcoming and so forth.

447
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,040
But what can, cause you know, Twitch, Twitch is in this interesting position because it

448
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,720
is a platform, but they don't, I mean, and I don't think it's realistic that they have

449
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,160
the platform to be the detective, to be the local, you know, and so forth.

450
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,440
But what can Twitch do to help make their platform safer?

451
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,440
There are two words and it's not just for Twitch.

452
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,400
It's for all, all really forums.

453
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,840
It's for the medical industry.

454
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,960
It's for mental health.

455
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,000
Believe women.

456
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,320
Don't just start writing it off and say, well, you had to have done something to have provoked

457
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
this.

458
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,280
Start it with an objective eye.

459
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Look at the proof.

460
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Oops.

461
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:35,920
I just hit my meatless and say, yeah, look, look at, look at the proof submitted.

462
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,000
Look at those chat logs.

463
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,120
Look at screenshots that are provided and believe when we say this is happening.

464
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:50,320
You know, I keep thinking back to, uh, you know, it was a few years ago where apparently

465
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,520
like some guy had used, uh, the lady's email about something or both in the same industry

466
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
did the same thing.

467
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,560
And he started finding that people weren't responding to, uh, the request that was made

468
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,440
that they were being condescending where she was starting to get her stuff done again.

469
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,000
You know, she had found herself in a slump and found it difficult to, to get things from

470
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
people to finish her work.

471
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:21,160
And it's ridiculous that it took a man experiencing sexism to believe her because he said he hadn't

472
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,760
believed her before that.

473
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,480
Um, and then, you know, on top of that, just when we provide you the proof, don't start

474
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,760
asking, Oh, well, why didn't you do this?

475
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,240
Why didn't you do that?

476
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,720
Fuck that.

477
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,920
Why didn't you believe when we brought this to your attention and how many times do we

478
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,460
have to do it?

479
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Let me get an important.

480
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Oh, sorry.

481
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Don't want to cut you off.

482
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,780
Uh, the one other thing I was saying, you know how I mentioned the medical industry.

483
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:55,460
Do you know that it takes us sometimes up to seven years longer for heart conditions

484
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,900
to be diagnosed?

485
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,420
And I'm pretty sure that's what happened with Dan's mom, that she would be alive if they

486
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:09,700
believed her, that she was worried about her heart that we did get the notice that it was

487
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
a heart condition.

488
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,740
And that's a big issue in the medical industry for sure.

489
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,180
Is that doctors, you know, kind of, um, a lot of times we'll put a stamp on a certain

490
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,020
set of conditions and they don't necessarily listen to the patient.

491
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,780
I know that's a huge, huge issue.

492
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,500
Um, I do want, sorry if, if I just one little thing, just people, if you want to really

493
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,780
look up how bad women have it, look up endometriosis diagnoses and that's it.

494
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,100
Let me get this comment in our chat from quest buster, because I think this is very important

495
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:44,340
when we talk about how can twitch do a better job and I say twitch, uh, and like Jamie said,

496
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,540
meaning all forums and stuff, but quest buster says there's a twitch executive that has also

497
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,900
had allegations leveled against him and that person is in charge of partnerships, which

498
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,780
for some isn't surprising considering their past behavior when it comes to selective bands.

499
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,880
And obviously that's a huge issue if you know, the call is coming from inside the house,

500
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,360
so to speak, that's a huge issue that twitch has to deal with.

501
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,840
And there's also a part of the trash.

502
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Yeah.

503
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,520
And, but there's also a part of me that's like, how does one person within twitch carry

504
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:22,480
so much power over partnerships that if this guy didn't have that kind of power, he wouldn't

505
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,320
be able to leverage it against people with these alleged, you know, issues that are going

506
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
on.

507
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,240
Um, so I kind of think that's also an issue is that there shouldn't one person should

508
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,400
not be left to dictate and maybe it, maybe, maybe it doesn't really work that way, but

509
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,560
it definitely seems like this individual again, if these allegations are true, cause legally

510
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:49,400
I have to say that, um, and so forth, where, where did this person get all that power?

511
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,560
Why are all this a, why are all those eggs in this basket?

512
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,560
And I think that's something twitch needs to look at is the division of power within

513
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,720
the organization and making sure that there is a decent amount of women in power, minorities

514
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
in power.

515
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,280
And to be fair, I believe, um, the, uh, person, uh, getting the complaints is, is, um, is

516
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,960
a minority, but it doesn't, it doesn't like matter.

517
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
You know what I mean?

518
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,240
They still need to have representation across the board in different positions of power,

519
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,240
if that makes sense.

520
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,000
Well, and to, to bring attention to what Bobby just said in chat, um, he said, and the sad

521
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,840
part is that it could be any man before you, not all men this.

522
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,200
And that is really the thing that actually is going to go back to, I think even with

523
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,680
the police thing too, you know, the, the, the all cops are bastards thing.

524
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,920
The problem is, is that there are enough.

525
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,400
That means we can't trust any until, you know, we know them and the proof has been laid bare

526
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,680
and we know that this is a trustworthy person.

527
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:57,360
And even then there are people out there who are complete predators who will lean in,

528
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,600
you know, try to be the gentleman.

529
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
And then they turn around.

530
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Well, I'm a nice guy.

531
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
You owe me.

532
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:10,880
So even, even then, you know, so before anyone says like the not all men thing, it's enough.

533
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,640
It is enough to make us trust none of you.

534
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:20,200
Um, Bobby in chat says, well, actually let me, let me follow that up in just a minute.

535
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,000
Bobby says, well, it's great that I know I'm not a creep.

536
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,320
I give off the creep vibe.

537
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,760
If someone just looks at me at a gaming event, I don't expect any woman to trust me at a

538
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
gaming event.

539
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,240
I mean, I have long hair, goatee, heavyset, I fit the profile.

540
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,600
Bobby's a great guy for what it's worth, but I understand what he's saying.

541
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,280
And like you say, dark soccer, you trust me, but, um, here's the thing.

542
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,120
So like, you know, I love to go out and play like Pokemon go and ingress and Orna and all

543
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,760
these location based games of the park.

544
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Right?

545
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,200
Well, just recently I was at a park and I was walking around farming and ingress and

546
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,160
you know, that involves, I'm staring at my phone, I'm doing this thing.

547
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,800
This woman at the park thought I was taking pictures of her and she's like, can you not

548
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
point that at me?

549
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,240
And while there was a part of me that wanted to clap back and be like, don't flatter yourself.

550
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,640
There is also that part of me that's like, let it go.

551
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,600
She's obviously got something going on that you don't know about.

552
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,040
So I just kind of like turned so my back was to her and kind of, you know, kept doing my

553
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,840
thing a different direction.

554
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,320
So and unfortunately, you know, playing the location based games I got in even just yesterday,

555
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,140
just yesterday, somebody was, it wasn't quite the same situation, but somebody was like,

556
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,200
are you taking pictures of that car?

557
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,280
What is, is that your car?

558
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,200
And I was like, no, I'm playing a game and she was like, Oh, okay.

559
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,360
You know, I kind of like tilted my phone enough so that you could see the ingress screen and

560
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,520
I don't expect that to make sense to anybody.

561
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,100
But you know, so my point is, and I am kind of like tying this to games in a way is that,

562
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:54,480
you know, I have to remember that not everybody is going to think I have the best intentions.

563
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,100
I have to kind of earn that, if that makes sense.

564
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:05,900
And the other thing too, is that, gosh, I just lost my train of thought on that one.

565
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:14,940
It's that we, that women, you know, and anybody who is in, I'm going to go ahead and say a

566
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:21,580
marginalized group has to do extra to watch our asses.

567
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:27,600
You know, if I'm going out to say, check the mail, I have my keys in my hand.

568
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,560
Like I'm going to stab a bitch.

569
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,380
You know, if I'm walking out to my car when I am, you know, in midtown, even in sister

570
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:41,400
face, you know, going out and doing ministry, I still have one of my sisters with me to

571
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,480
walk to the car, even though not many people, you know, have had pretty good responses.

572
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:54,120
Everyone's like, oh, hey sister, hey, I still do not go alone.

573
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,660
I think conventions need to have, and to be fair, like a lot of them do have a policy,

574
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,880
although it's not always well known.

575
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,740
And so it needs to be something that's like easily accessible and easily understandable.

576
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,520
There should definitely be policies at conventions for people to do not feel safe, like how they

577
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,200
can report that they feel like they're in an unsafe position and somebody with con

578
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,680
security or something can either like escort them to a car or to a hotel or whatever it

579
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,920
is that they need, you know, and sometimes that kind of stuff is like an afterthought

580
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,280
like that, that number or that procedure should be like on the back of the badge.

581
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,200
And again, some cons do have that, like, you know, one of the ones I was working with had

582
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,240
it actually built into policies now.

583
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Cool.

584
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
But that should be the standard.

585
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Right?

586
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Yeah, it should be.

587
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,520
And E3 didn't have that.

588
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,640
And it's at least in the years we went and maybe they've changed it since then.

589
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,840
I haven't been in many years.

590
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,160
And that is something that, you know, industry shows and industry actors need to have as

591
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
well, you know?

592
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:51,280
Well, and the thing is, and, you know, back when we were doing E3, you know, you know

593
00:34:51,280 --> 00:35:00,320
me, I go into pure con mode and I wander off by myself, but I also have this kind of weave

594
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,320
that I do in crowds, you know?

595
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,960
And like, if I am, you know, a lot of times when I was out doing cosplay, I would have

596
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,080
a very large prop with me because it's damn hard to miss a fan that's as big as I am.

597
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,000
And it's damn hard to miss big black wings walking around through, you know, a crowded

598
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,880
hall or are wearing like six inch platform heels that I could, you know, kick somebody

599
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,120
to death with if I chose to.

600
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:36,040
You know, I, when I do, even in choosing like my cosplay for going to conventions, I try

601
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:42,400
to pick something that I can use as a weapon or I can use to defend myself because I like

602
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,720
to go by myself.

603
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Yeah.

604
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
I didn't need somebody to protect me.

605
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,400
SSG100 Matt in chat says, my girlfriend gets harassed in public, including in gaming.

606
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,940
Men often feel the need to test her gaming knowledge or flex their superiority to her.

607
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,100
She handles it well, but it's frustrating that happens to her and many others.

608
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
You know what?

609
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,100
You bring up an excellent point, Matt.

610
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:07,780
And that is that we like it is, it is the year 2020 and we all need to make an agreement.

611
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,880
I think it's going to be a very easy thing for the, for our hosts and our listeners to

612
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
all agree to.

613
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,580
Um, I think this will be very easy and I'm not sure we're the ones that necessarily need

614
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,440
to change our mindset, but can we, can we kind of start a wave here and get the people

615
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
we know to do this?

616
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,340
And this is simply, can we just accept that everyone plays video games and everyone can

617
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:32,480
play video games and video games are fun for everyone and everyone should be able to enjoy

618
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,360
video games and everyone is going to like video games at different levels of enthusiasm,

619
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,320
meaning not everybody's going to know the name of every single monster in the legend

620
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
of Zelda.

621
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
And that's fine.

622
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
That doesn't mean they're not a gamer.

623
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,160
And some people do know the names of every monster in the legend of Zelda.

624
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
And that's fine too.

625
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,100
They're not a nerd or a basement dweller.

626
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,080
They just like games the way that another person might be able to name the baseball

627
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,080
roster for the New York Yankees in the year 2004.

628
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Right?

629
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Yeah.

630
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,360
Everybody has their different passions and enthusiasms and so forth and we need to respect

631
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
fandoms.

632
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Yeah.

633
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:16,320
And I, I even, you know, I'll, I'll even cause I do get the, Oh, prove it thing, you know,

634
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
whatever.

635
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,400
I mean, thankfully I've got the podcaster, I'm like, um, look me up on this.

636
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
That's all I have to say.

637
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Google me, bitch.

638
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Google me, bitch.

639
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Right.

640
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,120
But you know, the other, the other thing is that, you know, I've just flat out saying,

641
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,840
I don't have shit to prove to you.

642
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
I know myself.

643
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Fuck you.

644
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
That's all I say.

645
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Or, you know, if I really feel like proving it, I'm like, name a video game system.

646
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,240
I'll tell you if I have it.

647
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,640
And you know, and I used to, you know, funny enough to kind of bring this full circle with

648
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,840
the, the 18 years of OLR thing, I used to complain about this a lot in the earlier days

649
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,360
of OLR was the judgment I would get as a gay dude because I played video games and it was

650
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
like, Oh, what?

651
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,520
You don't follow fashion or listen to Madonna or, you know, and I, I, I am absolutely stereotyping

652
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,860
here, but these types of things like what happened is that it was like, Oh, you play

653
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,860
video games.

654
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,880
Isn't that like what, like, you know, basement boys do type of thing.

655
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,440
And so, you know, that now, luckily in the years that we've been doing this show, I kind

656
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:25,200
of feel like gay nerds and gamers like that has really like, there's a lot of gay guys

657
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,720
that play video games and that's very much accepted now.

658
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,600
Like I don't feel the same way now in 2020 that I probably did in the earlier days of

659
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
this show.

660
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,840
But you know, what age of the gamer, well, you know, what helped a lot with that was

661
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,840
having a place like where we had gamer X and the, like, if I could point out, when did

662
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,360
things feel like they started to turn around?

663
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,480
Oh, when there was a convention for people like me, that was a big one.

664
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Yeah.

665
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Yeah.

666
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Matt Khan, you hear us bring it back.

667
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,720
Well, he's, there was, I don't think he'll be bringing it back yet.

668
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,960
But the organization, yes.

669
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,120
And obviously not in the age of COVID either, but at some point, you know, hopefully we

670
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,960
do see a convention like that.

671
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,160
Well, there is that flame con that happens in New York.

672
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,560
I think that's a little more, it's more like a gay nerd con than just game gay games, but

673
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,960
I would love to go to that at some point.

674
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,960
And you know, the, the bar that people were going to, that we were just poo pooing earlier

675
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,480
about people going there.

676
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:29,680
Um, I actually am doing a flyers and advertisement for their classic game, uh, Friday one month,

677
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
which I love.

678
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Cause the one time I went, Jamie, it was really sad, but I'm, I'm glad to hear they're stepping

679
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
their game up.

680
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,720
Yeah, no, they, they, they're really trained to, to make it better.

681
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,520
And, you know, I said that, you know, I can't, of course can't do it now, but I was like,

682
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
I'll bring the turbo graphics.

683
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
We'll bring a TV.

684
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
It'll be cool.

685
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Yeah.

686
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,680
You know, and, but I've been doing the, the flyers and everything for that once it comes

687
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
out.

688
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,160
Um, of course that all really got put to the sidelines, but I'm, I'm really good friends

689
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,520
with the person that runs that.

690
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Cool.

691
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Well, I hope to see that improve.

692
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Anyway.

693
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,720
Um, I know this is a big topic and we probably need to spend more time on it, but I think

694
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
you still have a seven 30 cutoff.

695
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
Right.

696
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Jamie.

697
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
So I probably need to keep it.

698
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
But I can budget a little bit.

699
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Okay.

700
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,000
Well, let's, let's go ahead and move forward with the show, um, as we have other things

701
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,760
to discuss, but I'm sure this topic that was just under discussion, uh, will unfortunately

702
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,780
come up again, but it's one of those things where I hope we can learn, you know, as a

703
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,700
group to do better through these things, you know, like dark Sakura said, believe women,

704
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:36,380
like I said, respect fandoms and you know, the, everybody plays video games and so forth.

705
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:42,460
And I think once these types of attitudes start to really become, they spread and they

706
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,660
become out there, I think those will be the first steps into creating a better environment

707
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
for games.

708
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
That makes sense.

709
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
So agreed.

710
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,660
All right.

711
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,460
Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks since we are gamers, what were the types

712
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,580
of video games that we were playing this week?

713
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,620
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

714
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,940
I have been playing, of course, a lot of animal crossing because it's easy.

715
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:11,300
Um, and I've also been, I finally, I actually beat every new puzzle on patterned again.

716
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,700
Um, which I love that game is so relaxing is so chill.

717
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,700
Um, so that's really been the big two.

718
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:26,420
Um, and I actually, I started playing words with friends too, which I blame, uh, Samantha

719
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,180
of, um, stuff mom never told you podcast.

720
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,340
Um, I, I know I just, I have been a, the message and say, Hey, I haven't played words with

721
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
friends in a while.

722
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
So I play with me.

723
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,340
I'm like, okay, I will.

724
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
She's cool.

725
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,860
Um, so I, I'm now playing words with friends too again, so it's pretty fun, uh, make my

726
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,100
brain work and that's about it.

727
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
That's about it.

728
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,260
Um, you know, I like my stuff.

729
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,100
I made an alt and animal crossing Dan and I both did so that we can make, pay off all

730
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:00,340
of those houses and make like shopping centers in a house.

731
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,340
Nice.

732
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,340
All right.

733
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,340
My audio got out of sync a little bit.

734
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,340
Sorry.

735
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:15,340
Uh, because he didn't name his character, his name, no, but yeah, that's it.

736
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,460
All right, let me go to Loki and there might be a quick, I'm actually gonna just try to

737
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,900
fix my discord issues, but Loki, if you wouldn't mind talking about your gaming week here while

738
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,660
I try to fix some stuff on my end.

739
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,660
Sure.

740
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,700
So I, it was pretty much all Minecraft this week.

741
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,700
So there was the brand new, um, another update that came out.

742
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:40,460
Uh, so it was, uh, that was out on Tuesday.

743
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,420
So I've been, uh, you know, checking out that and working on our realm and doing that kind

744
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,940
of stuff.

745
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:55,660
And then, um, outside of that, I was also playing some, um, uh, Orna of course.

746
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,860
And then that's pretty much it.

747
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,820
Watch my kids been playing, um, animal crossing.

748
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,820
They've been really good.

749
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:09,340
Well, my son's been really getting into that, but it's been mainly just, um, just Minecraft

750
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,340
for the most part.

751
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
All right.

752
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,540
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, which I only heard half of, sorry, but I think I

753
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,020
fixed my issues.

754
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,780
Um, I will talk about my gaming week.

755
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,780
All right.

756
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,780
Yeah.

757
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,780
I've got issues.

758
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
I has them.

759
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,780
Uh, my gaming week, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff I usually do.

760
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,140
My location games that I love my ingress, my Pokemon go, my Orna.

761
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,780
I've been playing all those games, uh, but I've been playing stuff on a console and PC

762
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,140
as well, including continued adventures and final fantasy 14.

763
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:43,740
I almost have completed the fate grind, which means the, uh, a fate is a world quest event

764
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,780
basically that happens in a zone.

765
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,300
And in the latest expansion, you can get a reward.

766
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,740
If you do like, I think it's like 70 fates in every zone and we're working on the last

767
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,740
zone right now.

768
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,740
So that's very exciting.

769
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,740
I'm making progress on that.

770
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,580
Um, so a lot of the same old games, but I did play a new game this week.

771
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,220
Uh, it just hit game pass not that long ago.

772
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:08,420
Uh, so on Xbox one, I've been playing the messenger, which is a, uh, it's definitely

773
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,820
inspired by Ninja Gaiden, uh, from back in the day.

774
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,540
It's very heavily inspired.

775
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,020
And what I like about it is that it kind of winks and nods to the game that inspired

776
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,540
it, uh, quite constantly.

777
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,780
And I think that's really cool.

778
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,140
Uh, it has that kind of retro look to it, but the game is it's, you know, obviously

779
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,060
wide screen, uh, and the, the graphics do feel like a little bit amped up, even though

780
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,540
it has that retro look, I love that it's very tongue in cheek.

781
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:41,340
Um, it doesn't have quite the same cinematic story, uh, that Ninja Gaiden had, but I think,

782
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:47,860
uh, this story instead kind of like is a little more tongue in cheek and a little more silly

783
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,500
and a little more self referencing, but I think that's kind of cool.

784
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,820
And the gameplay is really fun.

785
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,780
Like it really kind of feels like you're playing, you know, the old Ninja Gaiden game.

786
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:02,260
So, you know, right in the beginning you can do like a double jump if you hit like a lantern

787
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,260
that's in the air.

788
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,340
So you jump, hit the lantern, you can jump again.

789
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,420
And so that leads to kind of some interesting mechanics and there's, there's things that

790
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,380
weren't in the game that inspired it.

791
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,540
There's things like swimming and there's this whole like death mechanic that you get your,

792
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,420
uh, life back, but the little demon will take souls from you and things like that.

793
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,660
So it's, it's fun.

794
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,660
It's cute.

795
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,580
And, uh, the nice thing with game pass, it didn't cost me anything extra.

796
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,940
So I've been able to check that out.

797
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,180
So if you have game pass, I would recommend that for sure.

798
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,340
Cause I think that has been a fun game.

799
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,500
So that's been between that.

800
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,500
Yeah.

801
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,500
That's pretty much my gaming week.

802
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,820
So, all right, well, let's move on and get into some things that have been happening

803
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,380
in the news and this is, this is a whopper starting us off tonight.

804
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,380
Loki.

805
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,380
Yeah.

806
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,300
It's, uh, it's something.

807
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:57,180
So there was a surprise announcement that, um, Microsoft made, I think on Twitter even,

808
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:03,900
and it was that, Hey, uh, mixer is shutting down as of July 22nd and they are partnering

809
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,260
with Facebook gaming moving forward.

810
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:12,460
So if you happen to be a partner status in mixer, that'll transfer over to Facebook gaming,

811
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,300
assuming that you sign up over there.

812
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,140
Um, they're basically matching all existing partner agreements as closely as possible.

813
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:27,900
Uh, Ew, for one, um, triple Ew.

814
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,140
I need a new graph.

815
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,340
You know, while we've got new graphic and sound effects, I need one for that triple

816
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,060
Ew.

817
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:41,780
So yeah, so that, that sucks for everybody that jumped in on a mixer and stuff.

818
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,140
I mean, I know they're pimping the hell out of that.

819
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:50,180
Even like, uh, when we used to go to GameStop months ago, uh, they would have on their games

820
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:56,140
or their little Microsoft kiosk, whatever, just be pimping out mixer all the time.

821
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
And now that's just, it's, it's gone.

822
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:04,660
So I'm unfortunate for a lot of folks that were dedicating themselves to that platform.

823
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,620
Not sure if anyone's really getting jumped ship to Facebook gaming.

824
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,940
Um, like, I don't know.

825
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,260
It's that's, that's tough.

826
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:17,020
And I want to say like, I, there's a few streamers that I watch on like YouTube and stuff like

827
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,180
one, one in particular, Ali 43, but I think tried the Facebook gaming stuff.

828
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:27,140
And I want to say that the issue there was either it was hard to monetize the streams

829
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,300
or it was hard to discoverability was a problem, uh, just the way it's set up.

830
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:37,500
I don't know what their issues are over there, but you not going to know.

831
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:44,260
Um, so I'm thinking a lot of folks will go back to Twitch probably, or YouTube, um, streaming.

832
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,540
Like, but yeah, they had a lot of features that sounded really cool.

833
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,340
Um, I'm curious now, like I know they had mixer integration for like Minecraft and stuff.

834
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,340
So now that's going to be broken.

835
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,140
So I don't know.

836
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,620
I'm going to be very candid on something here and just say, um, what I think many of us

837
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,420
are thinking, and that is that Facebook gaming fucking sucks.

838
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:09,140
And um, there's, it, it really does feel like, like a one, two punch in the face for mixer

839
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,380
to be folding into Facebook gaming because Facebook gaming is so fucking terrible.

840
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:19,300
Um, and I, again, I am here to support all broadcasters and all indie people.

841
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,540
And if you are a person that streams on Facebook gaming, I'm sorry.

842
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,860
If what I'm saying right now feels offensive, my issues are not to the streamers there.

843
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,820
My issues are with the platform.

844
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:34,100
Facebook as a platform has no business getting into this gaming arena.

845
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,760
And one of the biggest sticking points I have with Facebook gaming, despite, in addition

846
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,180
to the fact that the layout sucks for it, the discoverability sucks for it, the monetization

847
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,180
sucks for it.

848
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,660
The way that you try to find things and stuff you want to watch on it sucks for it.

849
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,880
All those things aside, the thing that really ticks me off about Facebook gaming is Facebook's

850
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,060
real name policy.

851
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,900
What did we just fucking talk about?

852
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,880
What was the topic that was just under discussion on this program?

853
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,000
And Facebook wants to mandate that everybody should use their real names.

854
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,460
I don't fucking think so.

855
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:21,460
Like it just goes to show that Facebook has no fucking idea what they're getting into.

856
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,780
And I understand Facebook has a lot of viewers.

857
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,820
They had more viewers than Mixer because Facebook is a monopoly.

858
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:35,500
There should be antitrust movements against Facebook because they have their hands in

859
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,820
so many cookie jars.

860
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:43,580
It's so easy for them to insert and inject the Facebook gaming stuff into your feed when

861
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,420
I don't want it.

862
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,420
Sorry.

863
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,540
I just, I know I'm ranty, but I agree.

864
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,900
I really don't like Facebook getting into this space.

865
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:59,160
And I agree, like I, there's like no, nothing I would watch on there.

866
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,580
Like I would not go there ever for any sort of content whatsoever.

867
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:09,000
Even if I would not stream it on a train, I would not stream it on a plane.

868
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,460
I would not watch it on the bus.

869
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,980
I would not watch any of us.

870
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,180
Like that's, it's not, I'm not getting on Facebook gaming and you can clip fine, clip

871
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,460
it, save it as a receipt.

872
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,460
I will quit broadcasting before I stream on Facebook gaming trust.

873
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,900
I know you're not supposed to burn your bridges in this industry.

874
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,580
I have no problem setting that one on fire.

875
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,580
Sorry.

876
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:37,340
So, so, so far of the big names that were on, um, Mixer, some of the big names, uh,

877
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,500
Ninja and shroud are moving back to Twitch.

878
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,980
Uh, there is one though, um, King, uh, Gothio, the Goth lion or something.

879
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:53,060
Um, he is going to be moving to Facebook, but I don't know.

880
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,900
And to be clear, and since I've been kind of a bitch, my heart really does go out to

881
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,900
the folks on Mixer that were impacted by this.

882
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,500
And like, you know what, not everybody necessarily knows this, but I'll be very transparent.

883
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:11,280
Uh, when we were looking to relocate VOG network off of shout cast and move to a video platform,

884
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,080
Mixer was under heavy consideration.

885
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,560
And one of the reasons why Mixer at the time was appealing was because it was like, Oh,

886
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,320
in twit on Twitch, there's like a lot of, lot of noise.

887
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,620
And on Mixer, what used to be beam pro at the time, there is the potential to maybe

888
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:31,000
do something that is, uh, able to get found out a little easier through that noise, because

889
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,480
there weren't a lot of podcasters, there was a few, but there weren't a lot of podcasters

890
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,760
and folks that were doing their thing on Mixer at the time that that topic was under discussion.

891
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,400
And I really liked the concept of the, um, what were they called over there?

892
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,040
The, the sparks or something like, as you watch to feed you, which Twitch ended up integrating,

893
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,660
uh, a system that's very similar, but at the time it was exclusive to Mixer.

894
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,660
And I really liked that.

895
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,520
And I kind of thought that went with the theme of participation and so forth, but what really

896
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,600
ended up swaying the deal the other way was that it was too hard to become a Mixer partner.

897
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,460
And at the end of the day, I think that was Mixer's biggest weakness versus Twitch.

898
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:15,120
And I appreciate Mixer existing to give Twitch some real competition because I'm sorry, Facebook

899
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,860
gaming is not real competition.

900
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:22,860
Um, Steam, like literally it's, did you know, Steam has a whole broadcasting thing and like

901
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:29,260
all it really was this flute, we, we just, we threw it out there and now we're just letting

902
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,980
the vultures eat it because we're like, Steam literally is doing nothing to curate or grow

903
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,980
that platform.

904
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,540
And it's like, we made this and now let's do, let's not make Half-Life 3.

905
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,120
And I don't think you can monetize anything on there either, but, um, so Mixer, they had

906
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,540
an article in the Mixer blog, they basically talked about why they kind of went this route.

907
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,400
So they said, ultimately the success of our partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent

908
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,020
on our ability to scale the platform for them quickly and as broadly as possible, it became

909
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,500
clear that the time needed to grow our own live streaming community to scale was out

910
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,740
of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox wants to deliver to

911
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,740
gamers now.

912
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:12,620
So we decided to close operations, um, we didn't want to do it anymore.

913
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,620
Yes.

914
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,300
So, but here's, here's the writing on the wall here.

915
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,620
So it says, you know, we're teaming up with Facebook to enable Mixer community transition

916
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,620
to Facebook gaming.

917
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:25,760
This is a key part of our broader effort that Xbox and Facebook gaming are embarking on.

918
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,940
So this leads me to believe that all these integrations that we have with Mixer and stuff

919
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,140
are going to now be integrations with Facebook gaming.

920
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,380
But I mean, that sucks, I guess.

921
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,200
But at the same time, if it's not popular, they're not going to support it.

922
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,080
So we'll see, just don't use the platform and it'll go away.

923
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,180
Facebook gaming can kiss my fat fucking ass.

924
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,220
And if the Xbox series X is going to rely on Facebook integration and it's going to,

925
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,700
it is seriously going to potentially impact my decision to get an Xbox series X, that

926
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:02,140
is how much I want to separate myself from Facebook and especially not get into this

927
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,140
gaming space.

928
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:08,060
I think it'll be optional, just like the integrations with like, um, Mixer and stuff.

929
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:12,780
And I think what will happen is, is if it isn't taking off like they thought it would,

930
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,900
and I'm sure there's some money changing hands, partnerships and whatnot.

931
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,720
So there's going to be some of the integration.

932
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,500
I'm sure that it's up to the developers on what they want to integrate with.

933
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,100
A lot of them are going to be doing stuff with Twitch.

934
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:31,300
I'm sure that just because maybe Microsoft studio games will decide to have some special

935
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,940
integrations with Facebook gaming, that that's not necessarily going to close the door and

936
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:42,360
other titles to integrate with, I say, Twitch or something else, or, you know, it's just,

937
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,700
it's not a huge deal.

938
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:49,720
Like, I don't know, you may see like a Facebook gaming app on the new Microsoft console, not

939
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,720
the same.

940
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,720
You won't see a Twitch app on there.

941
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,560
Um, I don't know, I just, I don't see it being very popular.

942
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,080
Let me get a couple of chat comments I think are worth responding to, because I think these

943
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,720
are a couple of big, big points.

944
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,640
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Ninja and shroud brought a lot of streamers to Mixer, but not

945
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,640
a lot of viewers.

946
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,920
And I agree that was mistake number one.

947
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,340
And I'm not like throwing shade at these big streamers who I know work very hard to get

948
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,960
the audiences that they have.

949
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,800
But the reality is they are not a magic ticket to making the platform larger.

950
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,540
It would have been smarter for Mixer to address the question, why aren't more people streaming

951
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,960
here in the first place?

952
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,520
And I done just told you the answer is that it was too much harder to monetize on Mixer

953
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,480
than it was versus, versus Twitter.

954
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,000
You could have had us Mixer, like lots of streaming failures that they're already having.

955
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,340
So like, but there were, again, there were a lot of great things that Mixer kind of had,

956
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:49,820
but I, if they had made it easier to get to that level of monetization and work, be really

957
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,540
feeling like you're a part of the community, I don't think they would have needed to throw

958
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,880
Ninja or shroud millions of dollars because they would have attracted smaller and mid-level

959
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,880
streamers.

960
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,880
And that would have been huge because then you get all that promotion on Twitter and

961
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,880
all that other stuff.

962
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,220
Now, Pele Hanumea in chat bringing up another excellent point is Kindle, Roku, and my Samsung

963
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,220
TV don't have Mixer app.

964
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,220
Bingo.

965
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,220
Another big problem with it is that Twitch is available pretty much everywhere at this

966
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,220
point.

967
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,900
Uh, Mixer was available on PC and on Xbox, which is, you know, cool if you're streaming,

968
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,660
you know, Xbox related content and stuff.

969
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:28,500
And it was really well integrated into Windows 10, but beyond that, it's a lot harder to

970
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,500
get on the Mixer.

971
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,240
And I think Mixer really, not that Mixer necessarily needed to be on PlayStation, but it needed

972
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,240
to be more places.

973
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,100
The, the Switch was a huge untapped thing, sorry.

974
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:44,780
And here's a kick in the balls for, um, for Mixer anyway, is that, um, the Twitch, uh,

975
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:50,820
streaming app now, um, has a beta out for Mac.

976
00:56:50,820 --> 00:57:00,100
So yeah, they're, they're definitely embracing, um, many more non-Microsoft, uh, areas.

977
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,100
I mean, while they were growing in numbers like Facebook gaming.

978
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,340
So I was looking at some numbers from 2019.

979
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,860
So at December, 2019, Facebook gaming had 8.5% of the market share.

980
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:19,040
Whereas Twitch is 61%, uh, YouTube gaming, 27.9 and Mixer was 2.6.

981
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,120
Whereas the previous year, 2018 Mixer was 2% and Facebook gaming was only 3.1.

982
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:30,700
So it definitely, you know, they definitely are growing.

983
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,060
Is that sustainable?

984
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,900
Eh, I don't know.

985
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:40,120
Um, but I don't see them like dominating the marketplace.

986
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:45,660
I see them as sticking around for a while until it's not making them money enough.

987
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,380
I see them as leeching it.

988
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,760
I, I, I will miss Mixer for the competition.

989
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,980
It was giving Twitch the healthy competition and I think it was forcing each other to innovate.

990
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:00,760
Um, Facebook is innovating nothing, so I don't see, um, Twitch having to, uh, really respond

991
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,760
in that regard.

992
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,060
Um, so it will be interesting to see.

993
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,700
I mean, I guess YouTube is now kind of the big competitor in that space with Twitch.

994
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:11,500
It'll be interesting to see if maybe a Phoenix rises from the ashes and we get kind of like

995
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,360
a beam pro 2.0 type of thing, uh, to, to compete.

996
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
We'll see.

997
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
I don't know.

998
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,140
But my, again, my heart goes out to those that invested so much on the Mixer just to

999
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,860
have the rug pulled out from under them.

1000
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,900
And it, it, I think it should make, I mean, between that and I don't think it's on the

1001
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:33,020
show role tonight, but we have the news about like the Microsoft stores are going away basically.

1002
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:38,500
And that's all changing to like, I can understand why people are kind of cautious of Microsoft

1003
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,500
in the moment.

1004
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:45,460
Um, and that's a real bummer because there's so much enthusiasm for what Microsoft's about

1005
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:49,940
to bring to the table through their cloud gaming and through the series X and through

1006
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,560
the studios that they've purchased and so forth.

1007
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,940
So maybe Microsoft sitting on a poker hand that they say, you know what, people are going

1008
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:59,000
to forget about these crappy things because this poker hand we're holding of all these

1009
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,080
things we're yet to announce is so good that we're cleaning things up before we kind of

1010
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,720
put our cards on the table, so to speak, but they think it is, or they think, yeah, they

1011
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,720
think it is.

1012
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:15,640
Um, I just, but my, I mean, real people were affected by this and it just, it really stinks.

1013
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,600
And I, I just feel businesses really care that real people are, of course, of course

1014
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:27,080
they don't, of course they don't know, but I think that's a wake up call to every streamer

1015
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:34,320
and no matter where you're broadcasting, that's it, end of sentence, that's the tweet, it

1016
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,360
should be a wake up call for everybody.

1017
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:43,520
Uh, the platform at the end of the day will sell you to Facebook if that's what they feel

1018
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,360
like they need to do to make the most money for their investors or the people that make

1019
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,360
the money off it.

1020
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,360
And isn't what now doing like a welcome back kind of thing?

1021
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,360
Yeah.

1022
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,040
I mean, Twitch is seeing the opportunity in it and they have to be snickering in some

1023
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:03,600
type of way that even though Mixer is like, you can do all of this and seamlessly integrate

1024
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,920
to Facebook gaming.

1025
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,360
There are so many people that are like, you know what, I'd rather just go back to Twitch

1026
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,260
even though I maybe burned my bridges over there.

1027
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,320
I'd still rather do that than Facebook gaming, which I obviously I'm thriving on that.

1028
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,480
It gives me such energy.

1029
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,480
Um, but yeah, so anyway.

1030
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,320
Well, good deal for like the folks that did take the money for Mixer because now they're

1031
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,200
out of their contracts and they still get paid and then they still get to go back to

1032
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,240
these platforms where they probably still have a lot of followers and stuff.

1033
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,520
Well and what a stupid decision then that all ended up being, wasn't it?

1034
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,040
I hope some people are answering for that right now.

1035
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,160
Um, so for all the credit I've given Phil Spencer over the years, and I think he has

1036
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,460
driven Microsoft in a much better or Xbox specifically, obviously in a better direction.

1037
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,680
So for this is quite the blemish.

1038
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,720
So that's all I have to say on that.

1039
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,720
All right.

1040
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,720
Just wait.

1041
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,240
We're only like months away from hearing Google announced that they're getting rid of Stadia

1042
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,240
too.

1043
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,240
All right.

1044
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
Moving on.

1045
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,440
Do we really think that's going to happen though?

1046
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,440
Oh yeah.

1047
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,440
It will definitely happen.

1048
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,120
That'll be one of those things we put in the time capsule for 2021.

1049
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,760
Did we even do a time capsule?

1050
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,760
I don't think we did.

1051
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,760
Did we?

1052
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,760
I thought we didn't.

1053
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
Anyway.

1054
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,760
I don't think I did.

1055
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,760
Oh well.

1056
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,760
I have no predictions.

1057
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,000
Honestly, could anyone have predicted the way this year would go?

1058
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Maybe it's for the best.

1059
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
We don't have anything.

1060
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yeah.

1061
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
What happened to the murder hornets?

1062
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You know, now we have meth alligators.

1063
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,600
What happened to the murder hornets?

1064
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,600
They're on hold.

1065
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,680
I like how SSJ 100 math says, Oh, don't joke Loki.

1066
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,680
It's 2020.

1067
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,680
Yeah.

1068
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,280
Speaking of it's 2020, I saw a trailer today for a new movie called Greenland talking about

1069
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,160
like an asteroid hitting earth.

1070
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,080
I'm like, now's not the time for those types of movies.

1071
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,000
Really like now's not the time to an earth disaster movie.

1072
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Sorry.

1073
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,880
I got sidetracked with something IRL.

1074
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,880
What were you saying?

1075
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,120
Oh, I was just saying that, uh, there's this movie Greenland coming out.

1076
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:07,040
That's like your typical, uh, Roland Emmert disaster flick or whatever, no asteroids hitting

1077
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,680
the earth and destroying everything.

1078
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,880
I was like, no, no, no.

1079
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,680
You want to know what is crazy is that I've been watching a lot more horror flicks lately.

1080
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,200
The psychological ones is like, I've watched the witch.

1081
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,080
I watched, uh, hereditary.

1082
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,840
I watched Midsommar, which I fucking love that movie.

1083
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:32,160
I've I watched, uh, a girl walks alone at night, which is a really good movie too.

1084
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:37,120
Just like I even re-watched like the house where evil dwells, which I actually liked

1085
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,120
that movie too.

1086
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:43,960
It's just like the, the scary stuff is preferable to reality.

1087
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:51,440
I would rather deal with, uh, you know, Japanese murder ghosts than this bullshit we're living

1088
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,440
in right now.

1089
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:58,720
Um, Phoenix 77 26 in chat says, uh, the murder horn hornets saw the current situation and

1090
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,200
felt pity on us.

1091
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,200
L L a S U and her mat says, yeah, we don't need a disaster movie right now.

1092
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,480
Hype mayhem says my July, 2020 prediction, oblivion gates open up everywhere.

1093
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,440
Um, yeah, so it's, it's, it's been a year living in a disaster movie.

1094
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,440
It's been a year.

1095
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,480
I mean, you know, it's bad when the rest of the world is quarantining against us.

1096
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,920
Or if Halloween gets canceled, y'all.

1097
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:29,280
If Halloween gets canceled, I know, I know, don't, don't buy candy at the store.

1098
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,360
Let me sit on this one tiny little glimmer.

1099
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:38,960
However, however, hopeless of hope that I have that maybe there can be a Halloween anyhow.

1100
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,880
All right, moving on.

1101
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,600
Oh, let's talk about crash bandicoot.

1102
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,640
I guess that's exciting.

1103
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:49,960
At least, at least 2020 will give us that finally, a new Chris, no, this looks really

1104
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:50,960
cool actually.

1105
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,080
Now we already talked about this a little bit on last week's show because it spilled

1106
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,680
early, but we got more details on crash bandicoot for it's about time.

1107
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,720
Uh, it was confirmed earlier this week by Activision being developed by toys for Bob.

1108
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:10,160
Um, it is sporting a new kind of, or kind of like the more HD remake crash style there.

1109
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:15,480
But otherwise the classic, uh, behind the back kind of over the shoulder platforming

1110
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,160
that is going to be in the game, crashes in it, Coco cortex, all that stuff.

1111
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,420
Cortex has been banished to the past and he's now planning crashes doom.

1112
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:28,160
So I like that they're doing this tongue in cheek thing there with this whole it's about

1113
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,520
time when it's taken so long for there to be a new crash game.

1114
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,360
It's kind of like they're doing a play on words and it's super cute.

1115
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:42,160
Um, so anyhow, uh, they also in the trailer say they've only beaten cortex three times,

1116
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,360
although they could swear that they were more.

1117
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,800
And so, um, they just kind of ignored all the other crash games that happened outside

1118
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,940
the first three.

1119
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,720
So this is a true crash for games.

1120
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,080
So now, um, no games made by like traveler's tale or radical entertainment, that stuff

1121
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,520
I'll count anymore.

1122
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,520
Anyhow crash four will be coming out October 2nd for PlayStation four and X-Box one, nothing

1123
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,840
on the switch as of yet.

1124
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,760
Although I'm pretty sure Activision was asked about that.

1125
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,240
And they said something like, you know, if the, if the people want it or if the demand

1126
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,800
is there, probably your typical non-answer answer, meaning it's not being made now, but

1127
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,480
maybe later type of thing.

1128
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly that

1129
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,200
dark soccer.

1130
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,200
What's next?

1131
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:31,160
Well, um, I'm not super surprised by this at all because I kind of felt it was going

1132
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,000
to happen the moment Nintendo said they were going to do some mobile games.

1133
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,040
Um, and yes, uh, pocket camp was fun for a hot minute.

1134
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:44,600
Um, but Nintendo is moving away from mobile gaming.

1135
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:53,560
Um, they had a really, really disappointing result, um, and they basically just ended it

1136
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,560
all together.

1137
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:59,440
A president, um, Flutakada Shuntada was, um, you know, he was all down for it.

1138
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,760
He's like, it's going to be a big business, it's going to have growth and now, uh, no.

1139
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:09,120
So he basically said we are, and this is a quote, we are not necessarily looking to continue

1140
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:13,040
releasing many new applications for the mobile market.

1141
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:22,640
And I mean, look at it right now though, um, it's, they've made so much with animal crossing.

1142
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,160
Um, they have so many other really good games.

1143
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:34,240
Um, you know, they have like super Mario run just like shot down the shitter, you know,

1144
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,600
and on top of that, um, now after he said that statement, Nintendo share did fall about

1145
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:44,600
4%, but the writing was on the wall.

1146
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,600
This is going to happen.

1147
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:53,480
Um, and actually as for right now, um, the only things that I see for Nintendo that's

1148
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,840
making money is still animal crossing pocket camp.

1149
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:02,280
Um, Dragalia lost that's way gone down.

1150
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,680
Super Mario run has gone down.

1151
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:09,920
Fire Emblem heroes has gone way down and yeah, animal crossing is still doing pretty good.

1152
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,020
It's kind of, those rankings are kind of sad cause I actually feel like Dragalia lost,

1153
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:17,280
you know, when Nintendo kind of does something new as opposed to animal crossing is a little

1154
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,280
bit different.

1155
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,080
I think animal crossing kind of works as the type of game it is, but like it wasn't working

1156
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,600
when they were trying to turn platformers like super Mario brothers, like dr Mario.

1157
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,480
Yes, more of a puzzle game, but still kind of action oriented like Mario cart when they

1158
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,080
try to turn those games to mobile, they just don't work.

1159
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:37,520
But the other types of games and the new stuff, like I actually think Dragalia lost is probably

1160
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,600
one of the stronger titles they put out.

1161
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,280
And the nice thing about it is it's not tied to any other Nintendo product.

1162
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,880
And I kind of think that's the direction Nintendo should have thought about staying in.

1163
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:53,880
But you know, the only thing that's really, I think, helped with the pocket camp to be

1164
01:07:53,880 --> 01:08:00,080
honest is people who have forgot to cancel their subscriptions to like the, the leaf

1165
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,360
ticket service and all of that.

1166
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:07,640
I mean, I almost forgot to do it, but you know, once I got my, my goodies from pocket

1167
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,240
camp, I was like, okay, I'm kind of done with this.

1168
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,000
It's not really that fun.

1169
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,560
You know, you can't really, you don't have the same customization.

1170
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:24,480
And then you know, on top of that, I think that they've got really big competition in

1171
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,880
the form of Fortnite.

1172
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:35,400
Honor of Kings is way making money in comparison to what the, you know, Nintendo titles are

1173
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,840
doing as far as the mobile competition.

1174
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:45,680
They are, honestly, I think it's, it's wise.

1175
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,600
I think it's a good thing for them that they're not really pulling a hole out of it.

1176
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,600
They should keep, you know, support for what they have on there now.

1177
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,960
You know what I think that would make the money is if they did a specifically mobile

1178
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,440
ACE attorney game, that would be fun.

1179
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,040
That would bring them the moolah.

1180
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,160
Um, but you know, I, I also feel like I was just gonna say, I feel like Nintendo is almost

1181
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,160
strongest when other people are allowed to develop their IPs on mobile.

1182
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,400
And obviously what's coming to my mind is Pokemon go.

1183
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,320
And I realized little different cause Pokemon is the Pokemon company, but it's still kind

1184
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,880
of all, it's still kind of all wraps up to Nintendo.

1185
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,560
And I still kind of feel like that's the strongest title.

1186
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,200
And that was like somebody else's new idea type of thing.

1187
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,600
And I think that's like by far the strongest title that's out there that involves a Nintendo

1188
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,640
product.

1189
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,720
But granted, I know Pokemon is like not really Nintendo, but it is, you know, I mean, I never

1190
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:38,640
played that, that, um, uh, Fire Emblem heroes.

1191
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,520
But what if they did like a Fire Emblem thing kind of like Orna?

1192
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,000
Oh, uh, cool.

1193
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Yeah.

1194
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,640
I mean, I, who knows what else Niantic is working on for the future.

1195
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,920
There might be other Nintendo related stuff in development.

1196
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,920
Who knows?

1197
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,320
Uh, we know content harvest their partnerships.

1198
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,320
Yeah.

1199
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:03,280
Well, anyway, um, we'll see what, uh, doesn't develop from Nintendo on the mobile front,

1200
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,720
or maybe if they do end up kind of letting go and letting some other people develop for

1201
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,720
that.

1202
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,720
Or if they're just like, eh, maybe not.

1203
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,400
Uh, I would take an old school Final Fantasy style Ornae game.

1204
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,400
Yeah.

1205
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,400
Heck yeah.

1206
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,360
Uh, there is a square game that's out for Apple arcade.

1207
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,160
So, um, it's not very good.

1208
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:26,240
I don't think it is, but I'm just saying, you know, it wouldn't be too hard, but it

1209
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:32,040
seems that, that, uh, some of those, uh, other companies are looking more to partner with,

1210
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,440
uh, you know, the arcade service.

1211
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,840
All right.

1212
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,840
Well, uh, Loki, you have a pretty logical followup for this, right?

1213
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,840
Yeah.

1214
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:48,320
So there was a little trailer for a brand new, uh, summer update coming to animal crossing

1215
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,080
new horizons.

1216
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:55,240
And so with this, there's going to be some cool stuff, including, um, diving into the

1217
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,760
sea and swimming.

1218
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:02,160
So now, uh, you can actually go in there and look for treasure and furniture and also new

1219
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:08,640
fish in aquatic wildlife that you can then donate to your museum or sell.

1220
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,880
And then along with that, the return of Pascal and Gulliver, um,

1221
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:18,040
Gulliver's already back, but I think we're getting pirate Gulliver.

1222
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,040
Yes.

1223
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,040
Pirate Gulliver.

1224
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,560
And you're able to trade it for a mermaid furniture.

1225
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:30,200
Well, hey, I'm excited about Pascal because I ordered a Pascal card and then I actually

1226
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,760
can use him in the photo thing.

1227
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,760
Yeah.

1228
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,760
I'm excited.

1229
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,000
Pascal is who you trade for the furniture.

1230
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yeah.

1231
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,640
I'm excited to get more content for animal crossing.

1232
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,160
Cause I feel a little like, okay, I'm a little worn out on what's there.

1233
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,520
Although, uh, I forgot to mention during my gaming week, the, the bug off happened on

1234
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,520
Saturday.

1235
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
That was cute.

1236
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,560
Like that wasn't just a nice little diversion.

1237
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,560
My birthday happened.

1238
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,560
Did you get your gold?

1239
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,400
Uh, no, I didn't play enough.

1240
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,560
I didn't even get the bronze.

1241
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,560
What is that?

1242
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,560
Oh, your town?

1243
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:05,200
She's showing, she's showing it on a stream for those are on the podcast, but, uh, but,

1244
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,440
um, well, one thing I was going to say with, uh, animal crossing.

1245
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,400
So, um, you may or may not know I had a birthday this past week as well.

1246
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,640
Cause my birthday's only a few days after OLR.

1247
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,640
So I happy.

1248
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,640
Thank you.

1249
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,880
I got to do my birthday and animal crossing.

1250
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,320
And that was really cute.

1251
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:23,640
Cause it's a whole little like sequence where it's kind of like, like right when you start

1252
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,320
and you like appear outside your house, your best friend in the town who I assume cause

1253
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,320
ketchup showed up for me and I love her.

1254
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,800
So she showed up and she's like, come with me, don't ask questions.

1255
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,700
And then suddenly I'm in ketchup's house.

1256
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:39,080
And then who I believe are my next two best friends on the Island poncho and rocket, because

1257
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,560
they were my two starters.

1258
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,560
So I've talked to them every day.

1259
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,920
So I'm pretty sure they're my closest friends next to ketchup, who I've also been showering

1260
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,920
and gifts.

1261
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,680
Um, they all showed up for my party and it was really cute.

1262
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:52,680
And then they gave me cupcakes and you go give everybody on the Island a cupcake and

1263
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,760
they give you something party themed in return.

1264
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,640
So you get like a party floor and a party wall and all this other stuff.

1265
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,640
It's cute.

1266
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,600
That's why I didn't get any of that stuff because I kept my cupcakes.

1267
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,400
Oh, you're supposed to trade them to the villagers and they give you stuff.

1268
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:11,480
If I do it afterwards, it's like, here's a cupcake.

1269
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,280
Here's a moldy cupcake.

1270
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,280
I don't want this.

1271
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,280
This is super old.

1272
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:22,320
You know, what's funny is that I got kidnapped by Agnes who I didn't realize she was my bestie,

1273
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,640
but she kind of is like the kind of person I would hang out with.

1274
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,360
She's one of the uchi characters, the big sister kind.

1275
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,840
And so like, okay, Agnes, you're cool.

1276
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,480
But I guess, you know, I had my whole birthday party on animal crossing with everybody.

1277
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,480
Yeah.

1278
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,960
Well, you, you, you were right when the game came out too.

1279
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,320
So it was kind of, you were one of the first to get a birthday in animal crossing.

1280
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,640
So a few weeks after.

1281
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,640
Yeah.

1282
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,640
Yeah.

1283
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,640
Yeah.

1284
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,640
So, um, yeah.

1285
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,440
Uh, also my least favorite villager left this week.

1286
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,440
So that was exciting.

1287
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,400
And now I have, Oh, I can't remember Nana.

1288
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,680
She's gone.

1289
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:01,760
And uh, I can't remember the name of who I got us a replacement, but he, he's a smug

1290
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,760
type.

1291
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,640
He's a large bear that is like a Greek God type.

1292
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,160
Oh, I know who that is.

1293
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,160
Yeah.

1294
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,640
I can't remember his name in the moment.

1295
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,640
Klaus.

1296
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,640
That's it's Klaus.

1297
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,560
I know what I called the German bear.

1298
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,560
Yeah.

1299
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,360
So I got Roman German bear when I went to the nook Island.

1300
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:23,000
And so I was, I knew I was hunting for a smug villager cause it was the one type I didn't

1301
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
have.

1302
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,320
So when I went nook, I saw like this, this bear is gigantic.

1303
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:31,520
I could see him from like when I started the Island, I was like, dang, this bear is big.

1304
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,920
So yeah, that's why, that's why I took into the town.

1305
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,920
And then I laughed.

1306
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,400
Cause he has like a whole like Greek God theme going with him.

1307
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:43,680
Do you want me to drop off my binder of animal crossing cards next time you need any villager?

1308
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,680
Oh yeah.

1309
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,680
Actually.

1310
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,680
Yes.

1311
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,400
Cause uh, I am going to let Alan really wants Gigi.

1312
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,800
I have the Gigi card.

1313
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,800
Okay.

1314
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,160
Well then maybe we can just do it that way.

1315
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,880
Cause, but, but I love Gigi.

1316
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,680
I have Gigi and Naomi who are the same type and I kind of prefer Naomi.

1317
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,600
So I think I have Naomi too.

1318
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,600
All right.

1319
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,160
It's turning into an animal crossing podcast.

1320
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,160
I'm sorry.

1321
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,760
We can do one anyway.

1322
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,760
It doesn't matter.

1323
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,760
I know.

1324
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,760
We've got it.

1325
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,760
We've got to get to your classic game though.

1326
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,760
Cause I know you've got to go soon.

1327
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:18,440
I will say, um, uh, animal crossing, even though I'm getting, even though I keep talking

1328
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,720
about it, I do, I do appreciate that there's new stuff coming to kind of motivate me to

1329
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,040
keep going with it.

1330
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,280
And this is coming at a very good time, I think.

1331
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:30,560
So, all right, moving on, let's talk quickly about the smash brothers direct that happened

1332
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
this week.

1333
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,280
So we knew that we were going to be getting a character from arms.

1334
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,200
Uh, and so we did get announced, uh, the character from arms will be Min Min will be coming over

1335
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,600
from arms.

1336
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,680
And uh, so, so unfortunately a lot of people were hoping for twin tell who I guess Shane

1337
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:50,720
messaged me and said, I called twin tell twin Tanya, which is a final fantasy 14 boss on

1338
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:54,680
the last show and nobody bothered to correct me.

1339
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:59,360
I've been playing too much of 14 anyway, twin tell was, it seemed to be a popular choice

1340
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,360
on Twitter.

1341
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:04,300
Uh, but it did end up being Min Min who I think a lot of people, I think people are

1342
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:08,040
kind of like, okay, it's kind of like the reaction I'm kind of feeling out there.

1343
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,040
It's Min Min.

1344
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
Okay.

1345
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:15,640
So anyway, um, that is the new character that's coming to smash and they, you know, detailed

1346
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,720
how it's all going to work and kind of the Springs and all that type of stuff.

1347
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:23,240
Now what else was announced during, I mean, we knew we were getting an arms character,

1348
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,640
but what about some of the stuff we didn't know about?

1349
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:30,300
So there were actually some new me fighter costumes that were unveiled and one of them

1350
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,700
is the fallout boy or not, not like the band fallout boy, but like the little pit boy from

1351
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:40,000
fallout is, which is weird because I'm like, is there even a fallout game on switch?

1352
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,200
Maybe shell, maybe fallout shelters on switch.

1353
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,480
That's all I can think of.

1354
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,040
So, um, there's that.

1355
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,480
I think that's kind of interesting.

1356
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,400
And then you can get some of the, uh, splatoon characters as well, which I think is really

1357
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,400
cute.

1358
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,400
And there's some other stuff too.

1359
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,680
Uh, 75 cents each for the, those are me fighter costumes.

1360
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,440
So it's not like an actual character, but you can make your me fighter and look like

1361
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,440
one.

1362
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:04,640
And there's more amiibo coming, including persona fives, joker, and that amiibo looks

1363
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,640
awesome.

1364
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,420
Actually, that's coming this fall.

1365
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:10,820
And they're also going to be doing the hero from the dragon quest series, who's also added

1366
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,960
the game previously, uh, both those figures coming out this fall.

1367
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,940
So yes, amiibo is still a thing if you are wondering.

1368
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,340
So that was a fun direct.

1369
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,020
I must admit I didn't watch it live.

1370
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:26,140
I just checked out the cliff notes after the fact, cause I don't play smash quite as frequently

1371
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:30,520
as I think other people I know, but, um, yeah, I'm excited to, to, I think some of the me

1372
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,580
characters they're doing are really cute.

1373
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:37,700
And uh, I love that this game is still going all this time after it released, uh, poor

1374
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:42,220
Sakurai probably needs a fucking nap, but good for him working so hard on this game

1375
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,220
and everything.

1376
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:44,220
So cool.

1377
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,220
Cool.

1378
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,220
All right.

1379
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,220
Moving on.

1380
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,220
Uh, Dark Sakura.

1381
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,420
Dark Sakura, you're muted.

1382
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,420
I think.

1383
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,420
I'm still muted.

1384
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,420
Yeah.

1385
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,420
Sorry.

1386
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,420
Sorry about it.

1387
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:59,140
Um, so to move on to Canada, we don't give Canada enough love.

1388
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,140
Do we?

1389
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,140
Love you Canada.

1390
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,860
You have a right to close your borders.

1391
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:07,060
Um, there is the entertainment software association of Canada.

1392
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,060
Sorry.

1393
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,060
Quick aside.

1394
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,660
Just fact though, I was supposed to be in Toronto this weekend.

1395
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,980
There wasn't even supposed to be a show today.

1396
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,260
I was supposed to be in Toronto for pride this year.

1397
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,520
That was the original plan.

1398
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,520
So frown.

1399
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,520
Anyway.

1400
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,520
Sorry Jamie.

1401
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,520
But that was important.

1402
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,520
Girl.

1403
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,520
Okay.

1404
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,520
Anyway.

1405
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,180
Um, they, what they do is they, uh, support the growth of Canada's video game industry.

1406
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:33,300
So they do research advocacy, um, and promote awareness of issues that affect video gaming

1407
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,060
and the development thereof.

1408
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,220
And they also work in talent development and technology skills.

1409
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:44,860
Um, and so what they've done, they are hosting the Canadian student video game competition.

1410
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:49,300
So they're inviting post-secondary students from across the country to participate, to

1411
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:55,460
show their skills and show excellence in three categories, originality slash creativity,

1412
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:59,140
artistic expression and technical proficiency.

1413
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:02,860
So, um, they are doing it in the form of video games.

1414
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:08,740
They want to really promote and cultivate, uh, new, new blood in the industry.

1415
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:16,500
So their winning team, um, will, uh, has a cash award of $6,000 Canadian to be put toward

1416
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,240
new equipment to continue in their education and training.

1417
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:25,220
So, uh, it's now in their sixth year, they've received 20 submissions this year.

1418
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:33,100
And, uh, like last year, um, we, the looks like the first unit, like, you know, I'm trying

1419
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:38,740
to say winner and I'm looking at university was, um, uh, from the school of digital, uh,

1420
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,100
arts animation and design at the university of Quebec.

1421
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:47,340
Um, and then, uh, another one from, it looks like their mathematic I'm translating to the

1422
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,100
university of Quebec, mathematic information team.

1423
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,860
And they build a game called cold sun.

1424
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,420
I'm sure we've seen this around.

1425
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:58,300
Haven't you, um, I've been seeing ads for cold sun.

1426
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:02,220
And then the second place was a game called wormwood from Sheridan college.

1427
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:08,580
And third place was the last frame from, uh, uh, I think it's also university of

1428
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,620
Quebec, uh, uh, she, she called Timmy.

1429
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:15,660
I think is how it's pronounced, but yeah, cold sun is, is this third party stealth

1430
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:22,180
game, um, kind of, you know, post POCA, post post-apocalyptic that basically you have

1431
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:24,820
to scavenge her resources by using garbage.

1432
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:30,900
Um, and then wormwood is a hack and slash and last frame is a cooperative puzzle game.

1433
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,500
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes out of it this year.

1434
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,500
That'd be really cool.

1435
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Yeah.

1436
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,740
Hooray for the future of game developers.

1437
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:38,740
Yay, Canada.

1438
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:39,740
All right.

1439
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:40,740
Yay, Canada.

1440
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:41,740
All right.

1441
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:46,260
To which, uh, we actually have a chatter in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog

1442
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:51,220
network named I am Canadian 47 who just responded with clap emojis.

1443
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,260
So there you go.

1444
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,260
Shout out to Canada.

1445
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,580
Uh, I am Canadian 47 also says pride up here was virtual.

1446
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,580
So it was quieter.

1447
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,580
Yeah.

1448
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,580
They've been doing it.

1449
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,580
They did like a big virtual pride on Amazon.

1450
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,860
I think there's like, it's not, it's not quite the same.

1451
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:03,860
I don't know.

1452
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:04,860
It's just, yeah.

1453
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:09,140
I mean, I don't like to go to the one in San Francisco anymore because San Francisco is

1454
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:14,920
so packed in like something weird started happening in my thirties and now my forties

1455
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:20,140
were like, I suddenly have claustrophobia in certain situations and San Francisco pride

1456
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:23,060
like gets that going.

1457
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:27,100
Whereas when I was in Chicago, it was fine, but that's because there's, it's so like the

1458
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,940
route is gigantic and there's so much space.

1459
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:33,620
I didn't feel like it's packed in when I was there and I was looking forward to Toronto

1460
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:36,820
this year, but we'll just have to make it happen in a future year.

1461
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,580
For me, San Francisco pride.

1462
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,860
Um, I much prefer it to the garbage that was Sacramento pride.

1463
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:44,620
Um, cause it was garbage.

1464
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,780
It was really bad.

1465
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,980
Super hot, overcrowded, not enough water, not enough emergency.

1466
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:53,780
Um, I've been to a festival where San Francisco has been run pretty, pretty well.

1467
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,860
Um, as long as at least I've gone to it.

1468
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:59,940
And of course I also have the advantage of marching in it with the sisters.

1469
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:04,500
I remember the rainbow festival here, which is labor day weekend beat.

1470
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:09,540
Now granted, I haven't been, I haven't been in like eight years because of dragon con.

1471
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:13,720
Um, but with the rainbow festival, I always say that was something the bars downtown just

1472
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,220
kind of did on their own.

1473
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,220
That's a better time of year.

1474
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,140
It's not as hot labor day weekend.

1475
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:21,580
And honestly though, this past one, I don't know.

1476
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:22,580
It seemed pretty tame.

1477
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:28,940
The most exciting place that, that I went to was probably what was supposed to be there.

1478
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:33,740
You know, their answer to Dory alley, you know, the, the leather place.

1479
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:39,620
Um, and I had a good time, um, but it was, it was pretty quiet.

1480
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:43,380
I think I went in face come to think of it, or maybe I didn't anyway.

1481
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:44,380
All right.

1482
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,380
It was still fun.

1483
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,380
Let's move on for time.

1484
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,580
So Loki, what do you have next for us?

1485
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,100
All right.

1486
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,180
So let's talk about more Pokemon announcements.

1487
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:58,980
So we've got this brand new game announced by the Pokemon company called Pokemon unite.

1488
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:07,020
It's a team-based mobile battle arena game that's created with the company Tencent and

1489
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:11,540
it's free to play on the switch and as well as mobile.

1490
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,420
And I guess it's five on five, um, base or team-based MOBA.

1491
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:21,780
So no word on what it's supposed to be coming out, but it looks interesting.

1492
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,940
I'm not really one to play MOBAs.

1493
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,140
So it's not something that appeals to me, but I know there are a lot of people that

1494
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,140
like that kind of stuff.

1495
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,140
Yeah.

1496
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:34,500
I, I, I, I've enjoyed some of the MOBAs I've played.

1497
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,140
Like I just, there's a lot of toxic people that play them.

1498
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,420
And so it usually scares me off from them.

1499
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:43,220
Probably my best experience was in heroes of the storm, because when you play versus

1500
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:48,260
AI, it's a lot less toxic there because all the edge Lords are playing more of the PVP

1501
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:49,260
stuff.

1502
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,740
So that was probably my best experience was playing heroes of the storm.

1503
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:55,500
So I know a lot of people were upset about this Pokemon news because I think some people

1504
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,660
set the bar way too high.

1505
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:02,780
Like they were expecting Pokemon let's go for the Sinnoh regions, which, you know, when

1506
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:06,780
they've got DLC still happening for the main game is not going to happen anyway.

1507
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:10,740
Um, or they were expecting, I don't know, like gen four remix or something, but it's

1508
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:13,060
like, you just got new Pokemon snap announced.

1509
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:14,940
Like it's not going to exceed that.

1510
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:19,540
Um, so some people are disappointed, but I, I, I welcome it.

1511
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,780
I don't think it's the worst thing they could have announced.

1512
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:24,500
Um, I think it could be interesting.

1513
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,500
Yeah.

1514
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,340
It's different to be willing to see what it's like.

1515
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:33,180
Um, you know, there was the other Pokemon game that they had that was all kind of cubish.

1516
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:35,180
Um, that was okay.

1517
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,580
Um, I don't know.

1518
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,740
It's nice that they're experimenting with the franchise.

1519
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:45,460
Um, I forgot to say during my gaming week, I played that Pokemon cafe came out, um, and

1520
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,860
I played a little bit of that.

1521
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:47,860
It's super cute.

1522
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:49,380
Like the art style's great.

1523
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,420
And, uh, it's, it's kind of a cute way to look at Pokemon.

1524
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:56,500
And at first I was kind of, Oh, it is kind of Tsum Tsum, but it's kind of like a puzzler.

1525
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,700
Like you only have so many swipes to clear the board and it starts to turn into freemium

1526
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,140
trash real quick.

1527
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,140
Sorry.

1528
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:08,000
But, um, there's, there's a really cute art style there that maybe could be developed

1529
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,880
into other games or I just wish there was a nonstop mode like Tsum Tsum has, like, I

1530
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,400
don't know why it needed to be a strictly a puzzler.

1531
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:19,420
Um, probably that's how they plan to make money, but maybe when this game kind of fizzles

1532
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:24,560
out because it's not very good, um, they'll look at different ways to, um, innovate it

1533
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,000
and maybe I'll get the, I like how you say that because it's not very good.

1534
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,360
Well, I'm just, I'm in a mood tonight.

1535
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,200
I'm just, I'm not making friends tonight.

1536
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:40,280
Sadly, I'm a little bit of a cactus tonight.

1537
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,280
Happy pride.

1538
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,280
All right.

1539
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,280
All right.

1540
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,360
Uh, let's move on and, uh, Oh, I think this one's my story and this is about some anime

1541
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,360
that's going to be happening.

1542
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,920
So there was a cyberpunk reveal that happened this week as well.

1543
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,320
So they were explaining more about that game.

1544
01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:01,280
And as part of it, there's going to be a collaboration between studio trigger and CD project red

1545
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:08,320
and for Netflix in 2022, a new anime series called cyberpunk edge runners will be coming

1546
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,320
out.

1547
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:13,720
And if that didn't have your attention, what if I told you that Akira Yamaoka is doing

1548
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,400
the music for it?

1549
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,400
That's pretty cool.

1550
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,400
Yeah.

1551
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,400
Right.

1552
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,400
So I think that's pretty cool.

1553
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:24,440
Uh, so the screenplay is being handled by Yoshiki Ussa and Masahiko Otsuka.

1554
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:30,160
Uh, and so I think this is a good kind of expand the world of cyberpunk and these anime

1555
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,720
series on Netflix based on video games have done pretty well.

1556
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,920
I guess some people could kind of give or take the ingress one, but I guess the Castlevania

1557
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:38,920
was pretty good.

1558
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:41,360
Uh, and is there one of the ingress one in there?

1559
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,360
Yeah.

1560
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,760
Like, well, there's plenty of them, but if the ingress one is, it's kind of plagued

1561
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,200
by the same problem that ingress has, which is the storylines really convoluted and confusing

1562
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,920
and the anime plays that game for the story.

1563
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:54,920
Give me a break.

1564
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,920
Exactly.

1565
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,760
But it's just like anime was really good.

1566
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,760
Ooh, yeah.

1567
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:05,200
And I'm sorry if they should have released this in the US, but the animal crossing anime

1568
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,400
was really cute and really sweet.

1569
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,200
Maybe they will.

1570
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:14,740
Also announced for anime adaptation in the worlds of video games.

1571
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:15,740
This is pretty cool.

1572
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:20,080
The world ends with you is going to be getting an anime adaptation.

1573
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,080
Remember that game?

1574
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,880
It was just a recently re-released on switch, not that long ago.

1575
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,360
Anime expo light.

1576
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,560
We'll be getting more details on that.

1577
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,720
Basically the real anime expo not happening because of COVID.

1578
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,280
So they're doing the online deal.

1579
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,800
So just think this, you would have got to see this in person maybe if COVID hadn't happened,

1580
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,800
but it did.

1581
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:43,400
So anime expo light on Friday, July 3rd, 6 PM Pacific, and then Saturday, July 4th,

1582
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,400
10 AM.

1583
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1584
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,960
That's time zone conversion for Japan.

1585
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:55,840
So more information you can check out their website is, Ooh, it's subarashiki-anime.jp.

1586
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,640
And that's the world ends with you anime, and I'm sure our pals over at anime jam session

1587
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,240
Tuesday nights hosted here at VOG network.

1588
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,880
I'm sure they will have plenty more to say on these stories.

1589
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,720
So check them out Tuesday night.

1590
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:08,720
All right.

1591
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:13,240
Meanwhile, it's time to get to the classic game of the week and dark soccer.

1592
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,240
Are you ready for this?

1593
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,760
I have something very special.

1594
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:21,960
So it's time for the classic game of the week and the return of the cute little music that

1595
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,760
plays in the background, which we haven't had for a long time.

1596
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,360
And a little, little video flourish for our pals over on Twitch.

1597
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:33,160
So every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and she's trying to find a game

1598
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:37,360
that, Hey, you brats should check out this game, respect this game.

1599
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:41,000
But once a month, dark soccer says, you know what, I'm going to mix it up and pick a pinball

1600
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
game.

1601
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,560
Uh, and, uh, we're finally getting to June's.

1602
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,440
There was a lot of other stuff that needed attention this month.

1603
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:50,840
So we're, we're, we're getting to June's pinball pick at the end of the month, but that's okay.

1604
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,560
So dark soccer, what did you pick for the classic pinball of the month?

1605
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,960
I picked the shadow, terrible movie, really cool game.

1606
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:05,200
Um, so, um, it was designed by Brian Eddie.

1607
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,600
The software was done by Mike Boone, um, artwork by Doug Watson.

1608
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,080
Um, it's, it's really an interesting, an interesting table.

1609
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,360
So, um, hold on just a second.

1610
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,600
Cause I'm trying to actually get the layout of the shadow so I can describe a little bit

1611
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,600
more.

1612
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,760
Um, we do see some video footage of it.

1613
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,440
Sadly, I wasn't able to get around to get any of the music.

1614
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:31,600
I couldn't find a clean copy, but we do have the video playing, uh, for our Twitch friends.

1615
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:38,440
So one of the very interesting things about it to me is that, um, if you're looking at

1616
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:46,160
that there is on the upper left hand side, a, um, like a mini little play field that

1617
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:51,680
has, uh, this kind of paddly game on it is just really cool.

1618
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:57,600
And that's one of, I think for me, I'd kind of call it the gimmick of the game, but overall

1619
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,160
it's a really fun one to play.

1620
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,160
I'm no good at it.

1621
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,160
I'm just going to tell you this right now.

1622
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,680
I don't play it that often.

1623
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:08,480
Um, and I think we loaned ours out right now, but yeah, it's called the battlefield is that

1624
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:14,080
whole section up there and it's got some fun ramp action, you know, and even the theming

1625
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:19,600
of it, um, you know, if it wasn't the shadow, just having that whole art deco look to it

1626
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,080
just really is quite attractive.

1627
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,520
So it's a really, really pretty, pretty looking one.

1628
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,600
Um, and yeah, uh, Questbuster also points out that the soundtrack by Goldsmith was great

1629
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,600
and actually, yeah, it was.

1630
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,600
I saw this in the theater.

1631
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:37,320
Um, but as far as, uh, other things about it, you've got all these different scenes.

1632
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:41,880
You have punish the guilty Farley Claymore, duel of wills, which is a video mode, um,

1633
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:47,060
brilliant sphere, escape from underwater, escape underwater, doom, and discover hotel

1634
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:48,060
monolith.

1635
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:52,240
You have, um, the bat, the battlefield, like I was just mentioning, you have shadow multi-ball

1636
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,240
and con multi-ball.

1637
01:30:53,240 --> 01:31:04,440
Um, and it actually had Tim Curry in it, Rob, some of the actors, um, recorded new speech

1638
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,440
for the game.

1639
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:10,000
So you had Penelope and Miller, uh, John loan and Tim Curry.

1640
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,400
So, uh, and then, um, there, though, the, the, the character for the shadow was actually

1641
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:21,640
voiced by one of the Williams, uh, midway voice actors, uh, Tim, uh, kids row.

1642
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:26,960
Um, and then it was kind of funny because like that whole battlefield thing is kinda,

1643
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,280
you know, Arkanoid breakout E sorta sorta thing.

1644
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:37,880
Um, but at any rate they produced 4,247 units, it was released November, 1994.

1645
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:45,840
So right after I graduated high school, um, and, uh, you know, it had the usual, uh, you

1646
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:51,040
know, cheeseball catchphrases for marketing, like when the shadow falls, earnings rise

1647
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,120
and no one can resist the power of the shadow.

1648
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:57,480
And then the shadow has the power to cloud men's minds, but the shadow pinball has the

1649
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:01,520
power to seize players' imaginations, whatever.

1650
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,560
Um, you can, uh, get ROMs of it for pen maim.

1651
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:12,640
Um, there's of course, you know, you can still kind of get some of the stuff for it.

1652
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,600
It's really, really fun.

1653
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,480
There's something, I think a couple of mods for it.

1654
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,920
I'm not really familiar cause we haven't, I don't think we've really done anything like

1655
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:20,920
that.

1656
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:28,720
Um, there, uh, I'm trying to see like what the last one, I don't remember what we, what

1657
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:34,240
we paid for ours, but they, it's one of the, from what I understand, I don't think you

1658
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,560
have to pay too much for it, like two grand maybe for a really good one.

1659
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,880
Um, but yeah, it's a fun one.

1660
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:43,800
Um, you know, like I said, terrible movie, excellent machine.

1661
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,800
I recommend it.

1662
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,800
We have one ourselves.

1663
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,480
Like I said, we loaned it out.

1664
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:53,640
Um, one of Dan's buddies was streaming it not too long ago and that was our table.

1665
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:59,960
You know, sometimes, um, bad movies become okay games or even better pinball tables,

1666
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,760
you know, it can happen sometimes.

1667
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,760
So it's pretty cool.

1668
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:10,800
But you know, it's, I think my favorite thing about it is just that whole, you know, pseudo

1669
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:11,800
art deco style.

1670
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,560
I just think it's really, really cool looking.

1671
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,560
All right.

1672
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,800
I know they definitely had good style, even if poor execution.

1673
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,880
There it is your classic pinball table of the month, the shadow.

1674
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:22,880
Good pick.

1675
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,120
Yep.

1676
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,120
All right.

1677
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:30,240
Happy to happy to be of service and yeah, now I'm like way, not way past where I need

1678
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,240
to be.

1679
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,240
All right.

1680
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,800
So sadly, blah, blah, blah.

1681
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:34,800
Yep.

1682
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,440
Sadly, I think we have to say goodnight to dark Sakura.

1683
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,160
Uh, but any, uh, thanks for being here as always.

1684
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,160
Happy 18th.

1685
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,760
Um, and any parting words for us tonight?

1686
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,760
Right.

1687
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:44,760
Yeah.

1688
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,760
And go to adult jail.

1689
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:56,640
Well, I don't know, but I, I'm, I'm really flattered that everyone liked, um, like the

1690
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:01,720
theme and likes the artwork and, uh, there'll be other versions of the artwork, Rob, like

1691
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,720
we've discussed.

1692
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:07,120
So you'll see, you'll see more come of it and you know, I kind of gave everyone, we

1693
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:16,600
gave them a bit of a preview cause our little icons on, uh, on discord, uh, for a video

1694
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,360
that's, uh, that's part of it and the ferrets in there.

1695
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:25,160
So you didn't have, you know, when I showed Alan, you know, speaking of like all the little

1696
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,920
in jokes, which I hope you guys have fun looking at the different in jokes, but when I showed

1697
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,800
Alan, do you know what he said?

1698
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,400
What he said, where's president cat?

1699
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,960
I didn't think of that.

1700
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,640
Yeah, no, it's, and it's fine.

1701
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,640
It's fine.

1702
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,440
I don't, I don't want to like when you do such great art, I don't want to be like, but

1703
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,040
what about this one thing you forgot?

1704
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:49,760
No, it's, it's still great, but yeah, it was just funny specifically for Loki.

1705
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,520
Did you notice what it was?

1706
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,440
I don't know if Loki seemed like the final final version really briefly when I was on

1707
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,080
the screen, but I wasn't paying to tingle holding broccoli.

1708
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,080
Yeah.

1709
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:02,500
There's tingles holding broccoli.

1710
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,500
It's cute.

1711
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:08,080
So we have the reference to the broccoli farm and there's like plugs for two yyr games in

1712
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,080
there.

1713
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:12,080
So I'll tell you what.

1714
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:19,360
If someone would message me the two yyr plugs, which should be fairly fucking easy.

1715
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,360
Yeah.

1716
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,960
Um, maybe I will give you your own special version of the artwork.

1717
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:24,960
Oh, fun.

1718
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:25,960
All right.

1719
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:26,960
Yeah.

1720
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,960
All right.

1721
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,960
Well thank you.

1722
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:29,960
Dark Sakura.

1723
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,640
We'll see you next time here on OLR.

1724
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,520
And by the way, everyone look up at my camera.

1725
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,520
Okay.

1726
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,280
But the, the folks on podcast going to announce it.

1727
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,280
Okay.

1728
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,280
Wear your mask.

1729
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,280
Hold on.

1730
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,280
Happy pride.

1731
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,280
Yeah.

1732
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,280
And happy pride.

1733
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,280
Oh, I don't know.

1734
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,280
I don't.

1735
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:55,160
I'm going to be muffled now cause I'm wearing a mask and I don't know if Jamie can see it,

1736
01:35:55,160 --> 01:36:00,280
but as that as that gave me these wonderful rainbow glitter masks.

1737
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:02,280
I see it.

1738
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:03,520
Yes.

1739
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,680
So I'm, I'm Katana and Molina's gay brother right now.

1740
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:16,120
I just have plain black ones, but I ordered, um, was it, uh, they were, they were doing

1741
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:21,760
some promotion on Twitter and I think a gearbox was for Borderlands where they were offering

1742
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,280
a psycho face mask.

1743
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,880
So I got a set of those.

1744
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,880
Nice.

1745
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,280
I did get two masks when my friend Nikki came back from Thailand.

1746
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:35,040
Um, one of them is red with cats all over it and then another one is a Doraemon one,

1747
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,040
but it's upside down.

1748
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,040
So, yeah.

1749
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:41,760
But one of my sister friends is making me masks on the fabric that I have had forever.

1750
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,360
So I'll show you those when I get them.

1751
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,680
I think we have two of the rainbow masks and I think Alan just went to the store.

1752
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:49,920
I know he went to the store cause that was what was the side conversation that distracted

1753
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,920
me earlier.

1754
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,600
Um, and I think he wore his rainbow mask out.

1755
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:59,700
So I think he's just daring one of our bitch neighbors to say something on pride weekend

1756
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:01,840
about his rainbow glitter mask.

1757
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:08,480
I'm still tempted to put, to put out a pride flag for the fourth or a black lives matter

1758
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,480
flag.

1759
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:14,400
I'd have to get it past the hubby or get the, get the modern pride flag with the, uh, with

1760
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,400
the, um, Chevron.

1761
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:19,800
They call that a little, I want to, but, um, other than that, I don't want to put a flag

1762
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,800
out.

1763
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,800
So just saying.

1764
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,800
All right.

1765
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,800
Uh, we're gonna move on with the show.

1766
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,800
Bye dark soccer.

1767
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,800
Thanks for being here.

1768
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,800
Okay.

1769
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,800
Bye.

1770
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,920
Let's talk about some rapid fire news.

1771
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,640
We're going to go to Loki for some rapid fire news.

1772
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:37,840
You know, I, I'm very disappointed with my social media following that I was not made

1773
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,300
aware of this until several days after the official announcement.

1774
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:46,720
So just to let everybody else know, that's not in the know, uh, earth defense for six

1775
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,880
was announced, uh, coming in 2021.

1776
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,880
Now that was just a teaser bit that was at the end of the actual announcement trailer

1777
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:59,080
for a different game, which is a little odd, but it was called earth defense force.

1778
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:09,360
Uh, world brothers, and it is a kind of a voxel Lee looking, uh, earth defense force

1779
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,360
game.

1780
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:14,120
That's going to be out on the switch and on PlayStation four.

1781
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:19,280
It looks like a mashup between, you know, like, uh, Minecraft and earth defense force.

1782
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:23,600
So I'm not sure what you do as far as like being able to build anything in the game,

1783
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,520
but neat.

1784
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,980
And I will definitely play it because it is, uh, something that appeals to, uh, both games

1785
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,280
that I love dearly.

1786
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:37,020
Um, so yeah, so those will be coming soon.

1787
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:44,360
And then, uh, for July's Xbox, uh, live games of gold, we're gonna be getting, uh, WRC eight

1788
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:48,760
FIA world rally championship and dunk Lords.

1789
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,760
Those are both on Xbox one.

1790
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,760
Then your Xbox.

1791
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:52,760
I'm sorry.

1792
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,160
Is that a game called dunk Lords?

1793
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,160
Dunk Lords.

1794
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:57,160
Yeah.

1795
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,160
Is that like Dunkaroos?

1796
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,160
What, what is, is that back?

1797
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,160
What's that basketball?

1798
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,160
Like dunk.

1799
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,160
It's like a basketball type.

1800
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,160
Okay.

1801
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,160
Okay.

1802
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,160
It's basketball.

1803
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,160
Okay.

1804
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,160
Yeah.

1805
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,160
So it is a pretty cool.

1806
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,160
And then you don't just dunk.

1807
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,160
You dunk Lords.

1808
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,160
Forget it.

1809
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,160
Doesn't deserve it.

1810
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,160
Of course.

1811
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:17,720
One of my favorite Xbox three 60 games, saints row two, uh, and then also a game called juju.

1812
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,080
That's going to be out later in the month.

1813
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,440
Oh, juju B should totally win all stars five.

1814
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,440
What?

1815
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,440
Okay.

1816
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:25,440
All right.

1817
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,440
Moving on.

1818
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,440
All right.

1819
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,440
I have some rapid fire news as well.

1820
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,960
Uh, let's talk about a sequel for blood stained curse of the moon.

1821
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:34,960
Please note.

1822
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,200
This is not the main blood stained game.

1823
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,680
I mean, I would think that game's probably going to get a sequel at some point, but they

1824
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,160
haven't confirmed anything with that.

1825
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:46,780
However, that eight bit retro kind of thing that proceeded pretty good.

1826
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:47,780
That was pretty good.

1827
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:48,780
It was curse of the moon.

1828
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:51,040
There is going to be a curse of the moon too.

1829
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,400
Um, so that's pretty cool.

1830
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:57,120
So you will play as Zangetsu, who is the swordsman who I believe you meet in the story

1831
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,120
of the original.

1832
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:03,840
So, um, if you've played the actual bloodstain game, you've already seen Zangetsu, um, but

1833
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:07,100
there's a whole new cast of characters in the game that are end up in the playable roster

1834
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:08,100
and so forth.

1835
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:14,480
Um, no date yet on that, but we do know it's steam, Xbox one, PlayStation four and switch.

1836
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,480
So pretty much everywhere.

1837
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,960
Uh, so check that out.

1838
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:21,800
That is the sequel to curse of the moon and which I think this is really funny.

1839
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:27,400
There's a new game coming out called shakedown Hawaii, which is kind of a 16 bit retro action

1840
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,400
game.

1841
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,760
And this game is so retro, how retro is it?

1842
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:37,320
It's coming out for the Wii and the Wii U that's, that's, that's not a typo or miss.

1843
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,480
It's coming out for the Wii and the Wii U.

1844
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:40,760
It's a port there.

1845
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:44,520
So they, it's, it's out on like all the other platforms right now.

1846
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:49,420
And the guy that made this one before he did, uh, try to think of the other one was called,

1847
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:54,260
he did, he's done several like grand theft audit, like retro grand theft auto type games.

1848
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:56,500
The first one I did was kind of an NES based one.

1849
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,900
This one's SNES.

1850
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:02,660
Um, great game actually, but it's cool to see that he's supporting those other systems

1851
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:04,500
because he'd actually done that before too.

1852
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:09,140
I think with like even in the PSP last time he put out a game as well.

1853
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:11,180
So um, cool.

1854
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:13,780
There's not a lot, well actually I wouldn't say there's not a lot of games coming out

1855
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:17,620
on the Wii, but we had an announcement of another Wii game like not too long ago either.

1856
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:23,180
So what the reality is, there's still millions of those machines out there and they still

1857
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,180
work.

1858
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:25,620
So why not?

1859
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:28,700
Now this is very much a collector's thing and I think they even said it's only going

1860
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:32,000
to be, it's going to be limited to 3000 copies for this Wii version.

1861
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,440
So it's not something he's looking to mass produce.

1862
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:39,180
This is very much a niche collectors type of thing that he's doing.

1863
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,620
Um, and that's, you know, that's what it's for.

1864
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:45,500
It's going to be 30 bucks too, which is more of a collector's price for a game like that.

1865
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,660
But I'm sure there will be people that will be all about it.

1866
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:48,660
So why not?

1867
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:49,660
I think it's neat.

1868
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:50,660
I think it's neat.

1869
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:51,660
It's a good game.

1870
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:55,100
I have it on Epic Game Store and it's pretty awesome.

1871
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:56,100
Awesome.

1872
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,100
All right.

1873
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:01,420
Well, let's move on and let's get into some world release dates and check out some other

1874
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:03,580
games that are coming out this week.

1875
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,260
Maybe on the more modern systems.

1876
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:06,260
Loki.

1877
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:07,260
Yes.

1878
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:13,020
So we've got a game called Brigadine, the Legend of Runeseria and that's coming out

1879
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:14,780
on Nintendo Switch.

1880
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:16,820
Color Cross Malice.

1881
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:18,740
That's on Nintendo Switch.

1882
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:22,940
We have a Death Come True, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android.

1883
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:28,660
Mr. Driller Drill Land on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1884
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:34,300
Blaster Master Zero and Blaster Master Zero 2 both coming to PlayStation 4.

1885
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:39,300
The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel 3 on Nintendo Switch.

1886
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:42,920
Little Town Hero on PC.

1887
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:47,960
Track Mania on PC, which I'm assuming is the brand new version, not the older Track

1888
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,520
Mania game.

1889
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:55,080
And last but not least, coming to PlayStation VR, Marvel's Iron Man VR.

1890
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:58,320
My son will be overly joyed with that.

1891
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,440
All right.

1892
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:03,700
Well traveling to Japan and checking out the release dates over there.

1893
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:07,720
We have a few things on the Nintendo Switch this week, including Catherine Full Body for

1894
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,440
Nintendo Switch is out this week on the second.

1895
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:15,420
And probably one of the best titles, game title names you'll ever have on the Switch.

1896
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:22,800
We have Wolf Meow Animal Hospital, an important, an important job to help pets.

1897
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,280
It is an important job to help pets.

1898
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,280
But I just love that name.

1899
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,960
It's Wolf Meow Animal Hospital.

1900
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,240
The songs that they make.

1901
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:34,240
What do we, what do we, what do we call, what do we call the animal hospital in our game?

1902
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,240
Quick.

1903
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,240
Somebody give us a name to call this.

1904
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:37,240
Oh, Wolf Meow.

1905
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:38,240
Thank you.

1906
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,240
Yes.

1907
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,240
Yes, Mr. Smoosh.

1908
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,040
Now Wolf.

1909
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:45,240
Anyway, actually the cover looks really cute.

1910
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,240
I got to say this.

1911
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,560
The game looks adorable.

1912
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:53,400
Like I doubt it's getting a regional release here in the US, but like in Japan, if you

1913
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:57,000
had like kids that wanted to be like a veterinarian when they grow up or something, this would

1914
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,300
be like the perfect game for them.

1915
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,960
It looks really cute.

1916
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:05,600
Like you're actually like checking the temperature on the dog and giving a little bit of medicine

1917
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,800
and inspecting the cat's eyes and doing all sorts of things.

1918
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:09,800
It looks really cute.

1919
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:16,480
So with as much like kind of crap I'm giving the game, I think it actually looks cute.

1920
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,640
On the PlayStation 4, a little quieter this week, I guess nobody wanted to compete with

1921
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:26,480
Wolf Meow, but you do have Marvel's Iron Man VR is also out in Japan.

1922
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,120
I think that's like a worldwide release when that game hits.

1923
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,920
How about the UK, Loki?

1924
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:38,000
The UK, we've got Down the Rabbit Hole on PlayStation 4, Gun Club VR on PlayStation

1925
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,280
4, I'm assuming PlayStation VR.

1926
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:44,680
Big Pharma special edition on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

1927
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,200
No, fuck Big Pharma.

1928
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:49,200
Evil bastards.

1929
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,200
All right.

1930
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:58,040
The Wonderful 101 remastered on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, Iron Man VR as well

1931
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:04,500
on PlayStation VR, Azure Striker Gunvolt Striker Pack on PlayStation 4.

1932
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:05,500
And that's it.

1933
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:10,860
Sorry, just the whole Big Pharma, like, you know how we do those little parody intros

1934
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,700
on Twitch that inspired from you can't do that on television.

1935
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:19,300
I think we had one like a year ago that was Wizards Unite against Big Pharma.

1936
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:23,140
And it was a picture of that guy, that fucking asshole guy that bought the company and then

1937
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:24,620
jacked up the meds.

1938
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:26,980
That's all I can think of when you say Big Pharma.

1939
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:31,100
It's funny that you say that because here's the summary of the title.

1940
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:34,580
What if you have the power to rid the world of disease, to improve the lives of millions

1941
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:38,860
to ease suffering and cure the sick, and earn a tidy profit?

1942
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:39,860
Wow.

1943
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:43,860
That's what you do.

1944
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:46,460
I don't know how I feel about this game.

1945
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:47,460
Wow.

1946
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:49,460
All right.

1947
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:50,460
Anyway.

1948
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:51,460
Wow.

1949
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:56,860
So combine that with Woof Meow Animal Hospital and you've got some worldwide drug treatment

1950
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:57,860
this week.

1951
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:58,860
All right.

1952
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:01,660
Anyway, let's move on and we're going to get to the mailbag every week.

1953
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:07,460
You guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of our favorite emails here

1954
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:09,140
on the show.

1955
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:11,660
And we actually have a few of them to get through here.

1956
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:14,580
So let me make sure I get to them all.

1957
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:19,660
And we're going to start tonight with our first email from YYR, who said, hello, LR.

1958
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:23,180
Rob, I was thrilled that you mentioned Rocky's Boots last week.

1959
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:24,420
Well, I was thrilled to bring it up.

1960
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:25,420
I love that game.

1961
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:28,620
I didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted with that game when I was little because I

1962
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:29,620
never owned it myself.

1963
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:33,180
But I remember how much fun I had with it in the short time that I played it.

1964
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:37,460
I wonder if it'd be worth finding again for when my daughter is old enough to try it.

1965
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:38,820
You probably wouldn't have to look that hard.

1966
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:43,180
I'm almost positive it's on that archive website, you know, the library archive that has all

1967
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,180
the old games.

1968
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:45,540
I'm almost positive it's there.

1969
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:48,460
Although I did hear, we didn't get into it on tonight's show, but I did hear there's

1970
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:52,900
some type of lawsuit coming up against that archive and it might threaten its existence

1971
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:56,220
because I don't think it's specifically the video game part of it, but I think there's

1972
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:59,980
other stuff that they're archiving that copyright holders are taking issue with.

1973
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:05,220
I think it's the books or something because it's bypassing some sort of like loaning.

1974
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:09,460
I don't remember what the issue is, but it's book publishers that are having some problems

1975
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:10,460
with it.

1976
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:11,460
Yeah, you're right.

1977
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:15,220
It is the book publishers, but that could trickle down and have an effect on the game

1978
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,220
part of it.

1979
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:20,620
Regardless, it's the internet, and if you really wanted to find a Commodore 64 and Apple

1980
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:25,340
2 ROM, it's not that hard to do, so just putting that out there.

1981
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,860
Anyway, YYRContinues in the email.

1982
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:32,100
I did want to mention that it wasn't actually published by MECC.

1983
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:37,060
It was actually a product of The Learning Company, but MECC had so much great output

1984
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:41,580
as well, including Odell Lake, Number Munchers, and of course, The Oregon Trail.

1985
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:42,580
You know what?

1986
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:46,500
And I always got The Learning Company and MECC confused, so I'm not particularly...

1987
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,500
And you know what?

1988
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:51,180
A lot of those Apple 2 games were hard to distinguish from one another, so I think if

1989
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:55,580
it was an edutainment game that existed, I kind of just defaulted it to MECC, but I

1990
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:56,580
appreciate the clarification.

1991
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:57,580
You're absolutely right.

1992
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:00,100
Let's give credit where credit is due.

1993
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:02,580
Never mind that, though, says YYR.

1994
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:05,220
The most important part of this email is what I attached.

1995
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:10,100
When I was in high school, I knew a guy who was part of a punk ska band called Fix.

1996
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:13,540
The band wasn't around for very long, but one of its songs was dedicated to Rocky's

1997
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:14,860
Boots the Game.

1998
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:17,260
It is awesome, and I hope you can play it on air.

1999
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:20,080
I'm very sorry, YYR.

2000
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:24,120
You picked the worst night to send me an audio clip 30 minutes before the show, because I

2001
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,620
was literally...

2002
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:32,040
Like the smush clip that y'all saw on Twitch was done like minutes before we were on air,

2003
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:33,640
so it was just a bad night for that.

2004
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,640
I'm sorry, buddy.

2005
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,740
But I think he says he'll put it in Discord, and that's great.

2006
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:40,640
I did listen to it, and it did rock.

2007
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,160
Anyway, it is awesome, and I hope you can play it on air.

2008
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,720
I scoured the internet, and I couldn't find any trace of it.

2009
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:49,920
Shazam had no clue what it was, and the band broke up over 20 years ago.

2010
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,800
So I'm pretty sure you're in the clear.

2011
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:54,800
But if you can't play it after all, I'll stick it in the VoG Discord.

2012
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,540
Anyway, thanks for the show, and have a great week.

2013
01:48:57,540 --> 01:49:00,160
Stay healthy, happy, and sane, Aaron, or YYR.

2014
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:03,880
Oh, I didn't even think about the fact that technically I'm not supposed to play copyright

2015
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:07,400
music, but it was just a little clip, and I'm sure, like you said, it would have been

2016
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:08,400
fine.

2017
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,440
But sadly, it was like the worst night to send me a clip.

2018
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:11,440
I'm sorry.

2019
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:12,680
But put it in Discord, because it's funny.

2020
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:17,600
And I love songs based off games.

2021
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:18,600
So yeah.

2022
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:20,480
All right.

2023
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,760
Let's get to some more emails.

2024
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,280
FrodoSwagons is next.

2025
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:29,560
Hey all, I already brought this up in chat, but was wondering if you had any thoughts.

2026
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,960
Not sure if you know who this is.

2027
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:40,760
Doctor Disrespect is an insanely popular streamer, got permanently banned off of Twitch, and

2028
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,640
just sort of disappeared.

2029
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:44,840
Everyone is super confused as to what happened.

2030
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:47,040
Twitch won't say why, and neither will the doctor.

2031
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:52,720
Apparently, he brought up conspiracy theorist David Icky on stream shortly after he read

2032
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,600
something on his phone and got emotional, and his stream ended.

2033
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:58,960
I just find it odd that no one knows anything or won't speak up.

2034
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:04,760
No idea what David would do with violation Twitch policies, but that's what some people

2035
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:05,760
think.

2036
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,120
No worries if you haven't heard of it.

2037
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:11,160
Yes, I've heard of it, because I'm going to be honest, and I'm sorry if you're a fan.

2038
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:14,400
I'm not directing anger at you, but I don't get why this guy is famous.

2039
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,600
I don't get it.

2040
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,920
And I kind of thought he would have got banned after he took the camera into the bathroom

2041
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,080
at E3, because that wasn't funny.

2042
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:30,880
I kind of feel like this whole Disrespect, Edgelord, I kind of think that stuff was the

2043
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,320
attitude we're trying to get away from in games.

2044
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:39,320
And look, I'm not going to shit on those of you that enjoy it, because I still laugh at

2045
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:40,800
South Park once in a while.

2046
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,800
I get it.

2047
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:48,160
There's a time and a place for bathroom humor, but I don't get this guy, and I don't get

2048
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,800
why he had all this fame.

2049
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:55,100
So yes, I did hear about that it happened, and I don't know the reason why either.

2050
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:59,360
We here at OLR do not have any extra information, I'm sorry to say.

2051
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:03,120
And if he's not saying anything and Twitch isn't saying anything, the reality is we're

2052
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,340
probably never going to know what happened.

2053
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:07,000
He might write a tell-all book.

2054
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,680
I imagine that's where something like this goes.

2055
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:12,160
So maybe you'll find out at that point.

2056
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:18,860
But nobody really owes anybody an explanation, so that part's kind of difficult as well.

2057
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:22,360
So yeah, I don't know what else to add to that.

2058
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:23,700
I don't know.

2059
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:27,960
My coworker is a big fan of his, and I tried watching some of his stuff.

2060
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:32,240
And I get the appeal because the character was kind of funny, but then there was a lot

2061
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:38,360
of stuff recently that he's done that's just weird, and just spreading conspiracy theories

2062
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:39,360
and stuff like that.

2063
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,520
And I don't understand where there's a place for that.

2064
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,920
And then, of course, there's the personal drama they went through, and then the drama

2065
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:47,920
at E3.

2066
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:52,240
And I think what Twitch is trying to do right now is get away from all the drama, and there's

2067
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:59,320
been a lot of bans with folks that have been accused of different misconduct stuff.

2068
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:03,720
So I don't know if it's just because of all the other things.

2069
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:06,540
Who knows what the specific thing is this time.

2070
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:09,660
And there's also, on the flip side of that, there's a lot of people that probably should

2071
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:13,340
have been banned, and haven't been banned.

2072
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:21,100
I don't really care about the drama because I'm here for the games, so it's unfortunate

2073
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:26,580
if you're a fan of his, and he's off the air, and you'll just have to wait for him to say

2074
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:32,020
what the reason is behind it, and hey, I hear that Facebook Gaming's looking for some brand

2075
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:34,780
new faces for their platform, so you know.

2076
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:35,780
Perfect.

2077
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:39,660
But he couldn't go by, he'd have to use his real name on Facebook Gaming.

2078
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:40,660
Perfect.

2079
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:42,180
Put that over there.

2080
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:43,180
Perfect.

2081
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:46,180
There's so much drama out there, and I get it that we're all bored at home and stuff

2082
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:54,980
like that, but I just, you know, the character's fine, and it's just all the other drama that's

2083
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:58,620
around with it that I just don't really care for it.

2084
01:52:58,620 --> 01:53:05,400
I've got a limited amount of time in my day, and I'd rather watch someone that's more entertaining.

2085
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:12,880
There are hundreds of other streamers, thousands of other streamers that can fill time, and

2086
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:20,440
I'm sure you will enjoy watching as much as you enjoyed this guy, but I was not a fan,

2087
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:24,560
so I just, okay, he's gone.

2088
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,560
Cool.

2089
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:26,560
All right.

2090
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,560
Anyway, sorry.

2091
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:28,560
I'm such a dick tonight.

2092
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,560
I'm sorry, guys.

2093
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:30,920
Like, it's supposed to be a happy night.

2094
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:33,480
We're turning 18, but oh well.

2095
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,480
All right.

2096
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,040
Anyway, let's get to our next email, which is from Brad.

2097
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:42,320
I appreciate the question that you asked us, and again, I'm not trying to be a jerk to

2098
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,320
you.

2099
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:45,040
Everybody likes what they like, whatever.

2100
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:49,040
I just never understood why this guy was popular, but maybe I'm just old.

2101
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:52,480
Maybe one of those people's like, I don't understand why the kids today listen to this

2102
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:53,480
rock music.

2103
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,720
It's just, maybe I'm hitting that point in my life.

2104
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:56,720
I don't know.

2105
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:00,800
Anyway, moving on to our next email, last email from Brad.

2106
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:06,160
I believe this is our buddy Brad from PodCulture, who says, congrats on hitting 18, y'all.

2107
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,560
This is one hell of a milestone.

2108
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:10,440
You guys have been a part of my Sunday nights for so many years now.

2109
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:14,560
I can't count the number of games and hours of fun that I've had because of something

2110
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,240
I've heard about on your show.

2111
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:20,360
You guys were the key inspiration for doing my own show with friends, and it was a huge

2112
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:23,840
honor to have been asked for that same show to be a part of VOG.

2113
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,940
Had it not been for the family that has grown around your show and Bobby's, certain dark

2114
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:31,160
times in my life would have been a lot darker and probably would have not have turned out

2115
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:33,960
as positive as they did, and I'm still humbled by that.

2116
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:34,960
Thank you.

2117
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,200
It is great having y'all around as part of my Sunday night routine.

2118
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:41,540
Here is looking forward to another 18 or more.

2119
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:42,540
Peace Brad.

2120
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:49,840
Well, if we go for 18 more years, I'll be 60 years old, so that'll be something.

2121
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,780
But thank you for those kind words.

2122
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:52,780
I'm glad we could help.

2123
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:58,220
I'm glad you're part of the family, and I welcome everybody that is here to treat others

2124
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:04,220
with respect and just have fun, kind of like what Loki said, honestly.

2125
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:08,160
Just have fun playing games and leave the drama.

2126
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:12,940
I'm not into, and Bobby said it in chat too, and I remember a day at a time when fighting

2127
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:18,840
with other streamers and other broadcasters and stuff was funny, and it's not funny.

2128
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:21,020
We need to be lifting each other up because you know what?

2129
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:25,760
Do you know how often podcasters are the butt of jokes in this day and age and all that stuff?

2130
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:30,520
It's like, we need to be working together to get past some of that crap and not bringing

2131
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,520
each other down.

2132
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,840
So that's that.

2133
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:33,840
All right.

2134
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,920
Anyway, moving on.

2135
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:38,080
That's it for emails.

2136
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,480
We encourage more emails in future weeks.

2137
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:43,400
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.

2138
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:46,200
Again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

2139
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:49,200
Meanwhile, we have a few more stories for you.

2140
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:50,200
Loki.

2141
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,140
All right.

2142
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:57,300
So speaking of, we were talking a little bit about Facebook gaming earlier, well, another

2143
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:03,620
portion of Facebook is dedicated to Oculus, and Oculus has decided that they're going

2144
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:13,740
to be discontinuing the Oculus Go, which was their first foray to the wireless self-contained

2145
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:14,740
VR platforms.

2146
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:19,140
Of course, now you may remember they have the Oculus Quest, which is just better all

2147
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,320
around.

2148
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:25,280
And so unfortunately, they said they will, it'll still receive security packages and

2149
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:30,540
bug fixes through 2022, but they're not shipping any new features starting now.

2150
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:34,440
And they will update the storefront after December 18th of this year.

2151
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:39,400
Isn't this kind of just like a logical thing like, oh, we're not selling Windows 7 anymore

2152
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:43,520
because now there's Windows 10 and we'll support Windows 7 for a little bit, but it's someday

2153
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,400
we're going to pull the plug on that.

2154
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:46,400
It's just that kind of thing.

2155
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:52,580
There's now this unit that does essentially the same thing.

2156
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:55,660
So go get that one.

2157
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:56,660
Pretty much.

2158
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:57,660
Yeah.

2159
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:58,660
And I mean, it makes sense.

2160
01:56:58,660 --> 01:57:02,940
There's more, there's better hardware, more features that are in the Oculus Quest.

2161
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:06,980
It's just harder to probably support this older system when they're trying to push people

2162
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:09,220
to a better platform.

2163
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:14,640
So I mean, that's tech for you.

2164
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:18,000
You know what Facebook should do with Oculus though?

2165
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,060
They should sell it to somebody else and not have it anymore.

2166
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:24,220
And this is not me being one of those, why did Facebook buy Oculus?

2167
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:26,460
I completely understand why Facebook bought Oculus.

2168
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:30,340
I just say, again, Facebook, Facebook needs less, not more.

2169
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:35,100
And I don't, if certain things are to, you know, that maybe they are going to look at

2170
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:38,860
antitrust stuff on Facebook, I bet Facebook will be under pressure to unload.

2171
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:41,980
I don't know if Oculus would be one of the things, but I bet Instagram, because remember

2172
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:44,180
when they bought Instagram, that was a huge deal too.

2173
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:47,320
I bet they would be under a lot of pressure to unload Instagram.

2174
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:49,240
So we'll see how that goes.

2175
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:50,240
Anyway, sorry.

2176
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:52,760
That's me being an old bitchy man again.

2177
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:56,180
But and no shade on Oculus.

2178
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:57,840
I'm glad it exists and so forth.

2179
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,440
I just don't like their owners.

2180
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,320
All right.

2181
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:02,320
Let's move on.

2182
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:03,840
Hey, this is some good news.

2183
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,560
I have no complaints about this.

2184
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:06,960
This is a great story.

2185
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:13,160
It's a Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for one was a underrated gem on the GameCube because

2186
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:17,660
so few people actually bothered to hook up the Game Boy advances and play it all that

2187
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:18,660
way.

2188
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:21,560
But those that did do it have fond memories of doing so.

2189
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:24,980
So it's pretty exciting that it's going to get a second life on the Switch.

2190
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:30,960
And what I think is awesome, it was just announced that when the game launches on August 27th,

2191
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,640
there will be a free demo available for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

2192
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:38,820
It will have three free dungeons as a part of the demo.

2193
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:40,660
So you can just try that out.

2194
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:48,600
But if you team up with somebody that has the full game, you can actually go to 13 dungeons

2195
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:50,660
without having to buy anything extra.

2196
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:54,760
So it opens up a lot more to explore in the demo version.

2197
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:59,700
So it's an interesting kind of compromise between having everything and having just

2198
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:00,700
a little bit.

2199
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:03,720
It's like, oh, you get a little more if a friend has the game.

2200
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:10,400
And that definitely like throws back to like the DS era, which again, I know this is more

2201
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:14,140
like a GameCube Game Boy Advance thing, but the DS wasn't far behind.

2202
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:18,500
And remember when we could like beam demos of games or like one person has the DS game

2203
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:21,920
and they could beam it to others and everybody could kind of connect that way.

2204
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:27,740
So it kind of like had the window for the Wii and the DS Crystal Chronicles.

2205
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:29,860
Yeah.

2206
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,860
Did they?

2207
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:33,600
I thought they like announced it, but it never went anywhere.

2208
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:34,600
I'm sorry.

2209
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:35,600
It was chock chock.

2210
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:36,600
Well, mystery dungeon.

2211
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:37,600
Yeah.

2212
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:38,600
Same concept where they had it.

2213
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,600
Yes, that's right.

2214
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:41,900
So, uh, yeah.

2215
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:46,180
And, uh, Orange Right says it's too bad download play isn't built into the Switch, but isn't

2216
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:48,900
it interesting how we're seeing games kind of use it anyway?

2217
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:51,820
Because Clubhouse Games is another one that's doing this.

2218
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:56,180
And then, uh, Pac-Man Versus, I think had that player or like it was a Namco collection

2219
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:58,580
that had Pac-Man Versus in it and you could get the player.

2220
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:02,200
It was really early on in the Switch's life because I think I remember grabbing it for

2221
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:03,500
Dragon Con or something.

2222
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:04,500
Yeah.

2223
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:08,300
I think for the reason why download play isn't really a thing on the Switch is because the

2224
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:14,240
ROM sizes are much larger and like a portable system, like the DS and the 3DS versus the

2225
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:20,560
stuff that's in the Switch, whereas the Switch, it's not, it's not huge, but to beam all that

2226
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:25,800
stuff over there, it's just not feasible to do it super quick.

2227
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:26,800
Yeah.

2228
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,100
It would be pretty heavy on network traffic, but it is kind of neat that you can still

2229
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:33,360
like, you know, you download the local copy and then you're able to do this stuff.

2230
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:35,360
I think that's going to be great for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

2231
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,700
I look forward to playing it.

2232
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:37,880
So yeah.

2233
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:41,420
I remember playing it a little bit, but I never got very far because how many people

2234
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:42,420
had that whole setup?

2235
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:46,180
I had an X that had the Game Boy Advance, that whole thing, so I could play with him,

2236
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:48,380
but like we only ever played like two or three times.

2237
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:49,380
So anyway.

2238
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:50,380
All right.

2239
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,380
Moving on.

2240
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:52,380
A few more stories for you.

2241
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:53,380
Loki.

2242
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:54,380
All right.

2243
02:00:54,380 --> 02:01:00,940
And so we know about the Xbox Series X and what to kind of expect there.

2244
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:07,960
What we don't know about is some of these leaks and information coming out about some

2245
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:13,080
sort of system called a code name Lockhart, which the thought is it's going to be a

2246
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:16,680
lower powered version of the Xbox Series X.

2247
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:20,640
Some are thinking that it's going to be like an Xbox Series S, whereas, you know, we have

2248
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:27,200
the Xbox One S as well, that could be maybe an only digital system or a system that may

2249
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:32,500
be dedicated to just current gen Xbox One games.

2250
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:36,820
No words on exactly what that's going to be, but we know that there's some information

2251
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:44,060
based on the X2K and GDK release notes for June 2020 that reference the Lockhart profiling

2252
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:45,060
and stuff.

2253
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:49,360
And it lists these different dev kit.

2254
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:51,380
It kind of refers back to that.

2255
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:58,500
So I guess we'll find out later on what that means.

2256
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,740
I don't know.

2257
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:02,480
Very interesting.

2258
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,960
I guess we'll find out in July because that's where we're supposed to get everything on

2259
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:06,720
the table about Xbox Series X.

2260
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,980
So some of these rumors will be addressed then.

2261
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:13,420
And I think now most people are kind of anticipating Microsoft will end up being the cheaper console

2262
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:15,080
one way or another.

2263
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:21,200
The question is just how cheap does it end up and what do the features kind of look like

2264
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:22,200
versus the other?

2265
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:25,460
Because we know PlayStation five, there's disc and there's no disc.

2266
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:28,700
Like you can, you know, otherwise they're probably going to be the same thing.

2267
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:30,260
Microsoft, who knows?

2268
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,460
Could one rely more on cloud gaming or so these other things that you're talking about

2269
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:37,300
it maybe, you know, won't be there and it'll be, it'll be interesting.

2270
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:41,520
Plus something else to consider your Xbox One is still going to play a lot of stuff.

2271
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,340
So maybe it takes some of the pressure off of upgrading pretty fast.

2272
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:45,340
I don't know.

2273
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:47,820
It's, it's, it's interesting, but I do feel like we're going to get all the answers pretty

2274
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:48,820
soon.

2275
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:49,820
Yeah.

2276
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:50,820
We'll see.

2277
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,440
I'm waiting for more announcements.

2278
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:54,880
We've got, was it that event coming in July?

2279
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:57,680
So pretty soon, next couple of weeks.

2280
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:01,160
She Hulk 10 and chat says they should be giving out these consoles for free.

2281
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:07,960
Well, let's not forget Microsoft did toy with the whole like cell phone style Xbox at one

2282
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:08,960
point.

2283
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:12,800
And what I mean by that, only through those Microsoft retail centers, which don't exist

2284
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,800
anymore.

2285
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:14,800
Don't exist anymore.

2286
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:15,800
But you never know.

2287
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:16,800
They might partner with Facebook or something.

2288
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,800
No.

2289
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,800
They'll partner with somebody.

2290
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:19,800
Yikes.

2291
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:23,940
They'll partner with somebody maybe to offer the whole like subsidized.

2292
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:27,420
If you get a certain year subscription to gold path.

2293
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:35,100
I don't, I I'm being a little silly, but I we've seen the consoles try to take what works

2294
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:37,980
for cell phones and make it work for them.

2295
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:41,380
That part doesn't really seem to be stopping.

2296
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:42,380
So it'd be interesting.

2297
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:43,380
Right?

2298
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:44,380
Yeah.

2299
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:45,380
It'll be interesting to see what they announce.

2300
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:47,980
I mean, we'll know hopefully soon enough.

2301
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:48,980
Absolutely.

2302
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:50,160
All right.

2303
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:52,560
One more story here before we get to the last minute stuff and listen to round table.

2304
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:56,800
If you guys have any questions or comments for us in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog

2305
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,960
network, by all means, uh, say hello, ask your question.

2306
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:02,520
And this one is, is kind of a, is this really news?

2307
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:05,520
We knew this was going to happen, but it is official.

2308
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:11,360
The super Nintendo world theme park opening at universal studios in Japan will be delayed.

2309
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,760
You want to guess why?

2310
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:13,760
Yep.

2311
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,220
It's COVID-19.

2312
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:21,640
So super Nintendo world will not be opening, even though universal studios in Japan opened

2313
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:26,120
to visitors once again on June 8th, cause you know, in other places, believe it or not,

2314
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:31,480
in a lot of other countries, they got COVID a little more under control than they do here.

2315
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:35,880
So there's that, um, not to say it's completely under control, but they have a little more

2316
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:36,880
under control.

2317
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:41,160
So Japan opened up theme parks again with precautions on June 8th.

2318
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:46,300
But super Nintendo world is not going to be opening, uh, as a result, uh, right away.

2319
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:51,960
Uh, and so they've delayed the Nintendo area opening until later.

2320
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:54,900
And no, uh, it was, it was going to be late July.

2321
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:56,420
We don't know the new date now.

2322
02:04:56,420 --> 02:05:01,740
Um, and it's because of course, when they open this new land, they're anticipating,

2323
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:04,840
they're going to get more visitors that are wanting to check out the new land.

2324
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:08,660
And right now they don't want a flood of visitors because social distancing is still supposed

2325
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:09,660
to be a thing.

2326
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:13,000
They actually want to keep attendance down at a manageable levels.

2327
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:17,400
In fact, right now, only people can visit the theme park if you live in the surrounding

2328
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:18,760
Kansai region.

2329
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:22,520
Uh, and so it's really cut the number of visitors way, way down.

2330
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:26,260
Um, otherwise super Nintendo world is pretty much finished.

2331
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:32,480
So once COVID is taken care of, we have vaccine, effective treatment, herd immunity, whatever

2332
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:35,920
it is that takes care of this thing at the end of the day, uh, super Nintendo world will

2333
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,640
be like ready to open.

2334
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:42,100
Uh, and, uh, that means when air travel can resume again, so you can go to Japan and all

2335
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:43,100
that stuff.

2336
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:45,220
I'm just waiting for them to open up in Hollywood.

2337
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:48,860
Um, cause they know they're working on it over there too, or at least they're supposed

2338
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:54,580
to be at some point, 2022 super Nintendo land was really supposed to open in tandem with

2339
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:58,460
the Tokyo Olympics and it was supposed to be like, well, not in tandem, but you know

2340
02:05:58,460 --> 02:05:59,460
what I mean?

2341
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:00,460
Like still will.

2342
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:01,460
Yeah.

2343
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:02,460
Well, yeah.

2344
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:04,180
Now with the Olympics being postponed to next year, maybe it still will.

2345
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:05,180
So there is that.

2346
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:10,600
Uh, and yeah, as Joe 100, Matt points out in chat, Disneyland delayed their opening.

2347
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:13,280
Can't imagine Disney world will open on time either.

2348
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:14,280
Yep.

2349
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:17,880
Um, you know, I know a lot of people are, are crapping on the theme park opening stuff

2350
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:24,120
and you know, precautions are very important and uh, you just have to wear the damn mask,

2351
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:25,240
wear the damn mask.

2352
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:29,040
If people, and that, that's why this country is having a problem where, where, where are

2353
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:34,700
all these crazy people at trader Joe's and uh, whole foods that are screaming at the

2354
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:38,540
camera and screaming at people about how masks are a president stuff in other countries.

2355
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:43,660
It's not happening in other countries because other countries, they just wear the masks

2356
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:44,660
here.

2357
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:45,660
They don't do it.

2358
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:47,060
And that's why we're not going anywhere.

2359
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:52,900
I would argue it has very little to do with certain reopenings.

2360
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:56,260
They've already proved the protest to not have the impact because people at protests

2361
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:58,000
wear their, wore their goddamn masks.

2362
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,320
And there were people at protests who were dedicated to handing out masks to those that

2363
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:02,320
didn't have them.

2364
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,320
And you didn't have those crazy people at the protest.

2365
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,160
They didn't belong.

2366
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:07,320
It's that's, that's it.

2367
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:08,800
You want to know why COVID is still around.

2368
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,800
Look at the people in those videos.

2369
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:15,080
Anyway, I've gone on too many rents tonight.

2370
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:16,080
Sorry.

2371
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:17,960
We're, we're up for our listener round table.

2372
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:21,360
If you'd like to participate with our show, if you have any questions or anything for

2373
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,440
us in chat, go for it.

2374
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:27,300
Otherwise, I will look to my cohost, Loki, to see if there's any last minute stories.

2375
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:30,180
I thought there were a few things we didn't get to yet.

2376
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:33,020
There's a couple of things that also weren't on the show roll.

2377
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:38,980
So there's one thing that someone has developed a brand new exploit for the PlayStation 2

2378
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:44,700
that allows you to play homebrew discs on the system without any mods needing to be

2379
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,180
done to the system.

2380
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:47,660
No USB keys, nothing.

2381
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:55,560
It is just a way to burn a disc that'll actually play it on the system without any problems.

2382
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:56,560
Pretty amazing.

2383
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:04,040
It's a free DVD boot and it exploits, I guess, the DVD playing portion of the PlayStation

2384
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:09,060
2, which sadly rules out my PlayStation 2 because the DVD drive, I think, is broken

2385
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:10,780
on it.

2386
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:16,360
But apparently it causes the, it triggers a corruption in video playback and then runs

2387
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:20,260
the game through that security hole.

2388
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:26,420
Pretty crazy that we're developing this stuff already, but yeah.

2389
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:27,540
So there's that.

2390
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:31,480
And then one other thing I was going to mention is there's some possible leaks about what

2391
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:34,720
the announcements are going to be at Evo this year.

2392
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:39,220
So some of the announcements, including a Marvel versus Capcom Invitational, they're

2393
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:43,820
going to announce a collection that includes X-Men, Children of the Atom, all the way

2394
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:46,600
through Marvel versus Capcom 2.

2395
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:49,920
I guess kind of similar to what we had with the Arcade 1-Up cabinets, but just like in

2396
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,920
the collection.

2397
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:58,100
They were saying that they're going to announce Fei Long, Alina, and some new character who's

2398
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:01,840
a Grilla member of the Neo-Chadaloo.

2399
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:09,360
And some additional announcements, Tekken 7, Christy Montanaro, Dr. I can't pronounce

2400
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:14,060
the name, Vakskonovich, and a guest character, Kamen Rider 01.

2401
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:15,060
Neat.

2402
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:22,260
Before we get to another story, since you brought up Arcade 1-Up, guess what email I

2403
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:23,940
just got a couple hours ago?

2404
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:28,060
I got an email from UPS saying I have a package coming tomorrow and somebody needs to be here

2405
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:29,500
to sign for it.

2406
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:30,500
It's very heavy.

2407
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:31,500
Oh boy.

2408
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:32,500
Coming from Los Angeles.

2409
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:37,420
So I have to decide if I want to do like a stream of putting that together or not.

2410
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:38,420
I don't know.

2411
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,480
Because it's like IKEA.

2412
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:44,100
Well I feel like the only time Alan and I really, really, truly fight is when we're

2413
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:45,760
trying to put together furniture.

2414
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:48,740
So that might be the type of thing we don't want to broadcast.

2415
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:49,960
So we'll see.

2416
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:50,960
I don't know.

2417
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:51,960
I have to see how hard it is first.

2418
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:55,560
I need to go back and watch Bobby's video when he got a Star Wars cabinet and see how

2419
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:57,720
difficult of an undertaking it's going to be.

2420
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:59,440
But I'm really excited that that's showing up.

2421
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:03,680
And again, if you don't know, I bought myself a birthday present because my birthday was

2422
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:07,480
this last week and they just, like the timing of the shipment just worked out.

2423
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:13,220
I got one of the limited edition, I think there's only like 3000 or 3000 and change,

2424
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:15,500
Burger Time arcade 1UP machines.

2425
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:17,100
So I get to find out what number I am too.

2426
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:18,100
That'll be fun too.

2427
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:19,100
Ooh.

2428
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:20,100
Yeah.

2429
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:21,100
Ooh.

2430
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:22,100
Very fun.

2431
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:23,100
Cool.

2432
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:24,100
Ooh, wow.

2433
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:25,940
Bobby said it took four hours to put that thing together.

2434
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:26,940
My gosh.

2435
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:27,940
All right.

2436
02:10:27,940 --> 02:10:28,940
I like fun.

2437
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:29,940
Let me get some other questions from chat.

2438
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:30,940
Okay.

2439
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:31,940
Bobby says don't stream it.

2440
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:32,940
It takes too long.

2441
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:33,940
Okay.

2442
02:10:33,940 --> 02:10:34,940
Fair enough.

2443
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:35,940
Let's see.

2444
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:41,040
Who says there are so many great games on the market and so little time, how do you

2445
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:44,840
guys choose what game to play and finish?

2446
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:45,840
Good question.

2447
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:49,880
You know, a lot of times a game just kind of has to hold my attention long enough for

2448
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:53,320
another game to not come in and eclipse it.

2449
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:58,160
And then has to hope that the social games that I play, like the MMOs online also don't

2450
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:01,080
knock it out of me paying attention to it either.

2451
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:03,520
And it's one of those easier said than done sort of things.

2452
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:08,940
Like I have really bad attention span issues when it comes to video games.

2453
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:12,780
So when I do take the time to sit down and really finish a video game, play it start

2454
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:16,900
to finish, something like the Final Fantasy 7 Remake is probably the most recent one.

2455
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:19,200
I think that really is a compliment to the game.

2456
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:23,260
And usually it's like I have to know what happens in the story or I just, I need to

2457
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:29,500
see what, how this turns out or it's a franchise that I've been a fan of for a long time or

2458
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,500
what have you.

2459
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:31,500
I don't know.

2460
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:33,500
Loki, how do you pick and choose?

2461
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:40,760
It's just whatever holds my interest and a lot of times it's just, I've got so many

2462
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:41,840
to play.

2463
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:47,320
So yeah, it could be whatever holds my interest or what people are playing at that given time,

2464
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:50,680
if I want to get in on that stuff.

2465
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:51,680
I don't know.

2466
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:57,720
I know I have a huge library of things I haven't gotten around to playing and we're in Steam

2467
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:02,320
Summer Sale time and I'm still getting things.

2468
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:08,060
So you know, yeah, I looked at the Steam Summer Sale as well and like, thankfully I resisted

2469
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:09,060
so far.

2470
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:13,900
I'm kind of like, all right, I've, I've got plenty of games, plenty of games.

2471
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:17,760
I can never sit here and go, I have nothing to play because I still, there's that itch

2472
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:18,760
IO bundle.

2473
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:21,180
I'll never run out of things to play.

2474
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:25,220
So it's just a matter of just what grabs my attention.

2475
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:27,100
What in the moment says, Oh, this is shiny.

2476
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,520
I want to check this out.

2477
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,040
And that's, that's really what it is.

2478
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:34,480
So yeah, there's a lot of games, like a lot of VR games I've been looking at.

2479
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:35,880
I'm like, Ooh, I want to get that.

2480
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:37,880
And then I'm like, when am I really going to play that?

2481
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:43,200
Or, you know, just things that, Oh yeah, you know, that's on my wishlist.

2482
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:46,280
Maybe actually, and no, I'm not going to play it.

2483
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:48,920
I'm still going to get it, but I'm not going to play it.

2484
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:51,920
SSJ100Matt says, did we talk about Rogue Legacy 2?

2485
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:54,160
I forgot that announcement trailer came out this week.

2486
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:55,160
No, we didn't yet.

2487
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:56,960
I'm, I'm, I'll check that out.

2488
02:12:56,980 --> 02:12:58,300
I think it's interesting too.

2489
02:12:58,300 --> 02:13:00,440
I saw it kind of like the discussion in discord about that.

2490
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:04,700
It's using the whole, like, it costs less money if you buy it early.

2491
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:08,220
Uh, and then it'll cost more money by the time it actually comes out.

2492
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:11,140
Cause it's kind of like they're, they're taking some of the money out.

2493
02:13:11,140 --> 02:13:13,460
Cause you're kind of effectively beta testing it in a way.

2494
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:14,420
Uh, and so that's it.

2495
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:17,900
I mean, heck Minecraft was the same way when it, wasn't it cheap when it was first

2496
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:21,560
out and then when they like finally were like, okay, Minecraft's a real game.

2497
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:24,320
Now they kind of bumped up the price, another $10, I think.

2498
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:26,500
So maybe that was just cause Microsoft bought it.

2499
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:28,280
I don't know, but, uh, yeah.

2500
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:29,840
And, and some other comments and chat.

2501
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:31,660
Attica was cheaper on early access.

2502
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:32,160
Yeah.

2503
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,380
So, uh, Rogue Legacy 2 is doing that.

2504
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:35,800
I thought the first one was great.

2505
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:36,620
I really enjoyed it.

2506
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:40,960
I'm kind of surprised it took this long for them to announce a second one, but

2507
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:44,840
maybe it's, you know, games don't, games don't show up overnight.

2508
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:47,800
It's probably just taken a while to develop and now it's ready to be shown.

2509
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:48,720
So that's exciting.

2510
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:51,520
I was really one of the first like rogue likes.

2511
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:54,720
I remember really playing when that genre really started to take off.

2512
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:57,240
I think it was an early PlayStation plus game or something.

2513
02:13:58,920 --> 02:13:59,420
Yeah.

2514
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:00,380
All right.

2515
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:00,880
Anything else?

2516
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:03,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

2517
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:07,580
As far as, uh, news I had, um, I, well, I'm probably gonna end up doing it.

2518
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:11,260
At some point is going through, I like to sort by least expensive and

2519
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:12,540
see what they have offering there.

2520
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:16,260
I did that on the eShop the other week and I got a, I got a game for a penny.

2521
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:16,940
Oh yeah.

2522
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,900
You were mentioning buying games for like 9 cents a penny.

2523
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:21,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2524
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:22,060
That's fun.

2525
02:14:22,820 --> 02:14:23,100
Yeah.

2526
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:24,240
I have some of my kids to play.

2527
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:25,720
All right.

2528
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:29,640
Well, I guess with that, we're going to move to wrap up the show.

2529
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:32,720
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show this week,

2530
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:34,600
or maybe you were listening live on Twitch.

2531
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:37,360
Thank you guys for your support over 18 years.

2532
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:40,140
Um, and you know, we're gonna, we're gonna keep on going.

2533
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:43,480
I hope you guys liked some of the little, little flourishes we added to the show

2534
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:45,200
tonight, just to keep things fun.

2535
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:48,680
Uh, not just on Twitch, but on the podcast feed as well.

2536
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,880
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Islands Radio,

2537
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,080
please help us spread the word.

2538
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:55,640
Uh, we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to

2539
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:58,360
put out on the air, then we're missing something.

2540
02:14:58,360 --> 02:14:59,760
So we need to get more voices here.

2541
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:02,840
So help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show.

2542
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:07,360
Um, the, that word of mouth goes an awfully long, an awfully long way.

2543
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,360
Auto hosts on Twitch are also amazing.

2544
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:12,760
And we really appreciate those when you can set those up.

2545
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:13,680
Uh, so thank you.

2546
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:15,400
Thank you to everybody who hosts us on Twitch.

2547
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:18,240
Uh, thank you to all the new followers and the bit donations and all that.

2548
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:20,960
I'll read those after the show, after the credits, um, since we

2549
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:22,320
are taping for the podcast feed.

2550
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,520
And I appreciate those of you listening on the podcast as well.

2551
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:25,840
Drop us an email sometime.

2552
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:28,920
Say hi, uh, participate at orangelandsradio.com.

2553
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:31,640
We also welcome the tweets at OLR.

2554
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:34,160
So if you want to send us tweets, we do read those as well.

2555
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:37,120
Um, with that, I think we are to final thoughts.

2556
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:38,720
Loki, your final thought tonight.

2557
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:45,040
Uh, my final thought is I need to play something other than Minecraft,

2558
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:46,560
but probably not going to happen.

2559
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:50,600
Maybe I'll play one of these games that are on the, uh, on my Steam library.

2560
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:52,440
All right.

2561
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:56,960
Uh, my final thought is happy pride, black lives still matter.

2562
02:15:57,200 --> 02:16:01,280
I really like that new, uh, redesign of the pride flag with the Chevron,

2563
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:04,760
with the other colors in it to represent trans and, uh, people of color.

2564
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:05,760
I think that's great.

2565
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:10,040
Um, and, um, as far as video games are concerned, I'm looking forward

2566
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:12,400
to getting into more, probably actually putting in some hours on

2567
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,480
Xenoblade this week, cause I didn't put in a lot last week.

2568
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:19,800
Um, and I'm looking forward to, um, playing more this, uh, next week.

2569
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:20,560
Try to diversify.

2570
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,560
I want to play a little more of the messenger cause that game was fun too.

2571
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:27,880
So we'll be back in seven days to, um, to talk about what we've been doing

2572
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:32,160
in the week and recap the gaming news as we get closer and closer to more

2573
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:35,760
console reveals and all that fun stuff for what we can expect in the holiday.

2574
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:37,080
So be safe, everybody.

2575
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:38,920
We'll see you in seven days.

2576
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:39,880
Have a wonderful night.

2577
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:40,240
Good night.

2578
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:43,840
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

2579
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:48,160
