00:00.000 --> 00:18.040
This week it's nearly summer, which means the game developers, publishers, and makers

00:18.040 --> 00:19.800
around all present their wares.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.780
This year, from a distance, introverts unite apart.

00:22.780 --> 00:25.800
Join us for the announcement, preparations, and schedule your favorites, starting right

00:25.800 --> 00:29.520
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:29.520 --> 00:35.120
Orange Lounge Radio Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.080
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.680
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 823 for this June the 14th

00:43.680 --> 00:45.360
of 2020.

00:45.360 --> 00:49.620
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here in the studio that we've used for a little while

00:49.620 --> 00:53.080
out of a lot of the various studios that we've used over the years.

00:53.080 --> 00:59.180
But I'm by myself as we are practicing social distancing, as is still the case right now.

00:59.180 --> 01:02.320
But I am joined thanks to the magic of Discord by my co-hosts.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.680
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
Hello.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
Hi.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
How are you?

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
I'm okay.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
Good.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.880
I see I see still Kirby in the background.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.400
I'm looking at doll legs as well.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.400
And there's my camera.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.400
I gotcha.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
But you look great.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
Thank you.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
All right.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.400
Let's go to Techmaster Loki.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
Hello.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.400
Hi.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
And I'm trying to figure out what is that?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.400
Is that Mega Zeus?

01:26.400 --> 01:31.040
Oh my gosh, the sequel to ZZT or something like that, right?

01:31.040 --> 01:32.040
In the background with you?

01:32.040 --> 01:33.040
Yeah.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.040
I love it.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.040
So I was trying to find some interesting background.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.560
So it was either like some weird trippy Minecraft thing that only lasts for three minutes or

01:38.560 --> 01:40.320
a long play of Mega Zeus.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.280
So that's what it's going to be.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.280
I love it.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.280
I'm with it.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.280
That's awesome.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.280
All right.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.680
Well, we have had a busy week in the gaming world.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.160
I know we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight, so I want to get right on into

01:52.160 --> 01:53.160
it.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.780
We had a lot of news this week.

01:54.780 --> 01:58.360
This would have been the week that E3 would have taken place.

01:58.360 --> 02:03.800
But obviously with the situation of well, first off, E3, of course, was not it was in

02:03.800 --> 02:05.760
a weird place as it was.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.240
And then COVID happened.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.780
And then it was certainly not going to happen this year.

02:09.780 --> 02:13.280
So all the gaming companies have kind of scrambled to do their own thing.

02:13.280 --> 02:18.240
IGN brought a lot of people together under like a summer banner.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.840
But Sony moved forward and this week had their PlayStation 5 preview, which was originally

02:23.840 --> 02:25.080
going to be last week.

02:25.080 --> 02:30.240
But obviously with everything that's going on in the call for racial justice and equality,

02:30.240 --> 02:34.320
which is still going on, just because you're not seeing it 24 7 on CNN doesn't mean it's

02:34.320 --> 02:35.840
not happening.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.880
Good friends, several friends of mine were at an L.A. protest today because they kind

02:39.880 --> 02:46.000
of turned the L.A. pride into a huge thing for a support of Black Lives Matter and Black

02:46.240 --> 02:48.600
trans lives matter, of course.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.720
So all of that is still going on.

02:50.720 --> 02:59.000
But some of the, you know, kind of where do we kind of fit in the other things that go

02:59.000 --> 03:05.040
on, such as video games and recreation, trying to find the places for that appropriately.

03:05.040 --> 03:09.440
We did have the PlayStation 5 announcement this week and there was a lot.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.760
There was a lot to it.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.400
Let me just kind of start from the top and ask my co-hosts, just generally, what were

03:16.400 --> 03:20.560
your reactions to Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal?

03:20.560 --> 03:24.200
Loki, I'll start with you.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.160
I started watching when I thought it was supposed to be on.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.680
And apparently there was like trailers that started before that time.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.240
So I was a little disappointed that it didn't start when they said they were going to, at

03:33.240 --> 03:35.000
least I thought.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.360
Otherwise, content wise, yeah, that's PlayStation.

03:39.360 --> 03:45.280
I mean, there's a few games that look pretty interesting, not necessarily the ones like

03:45.280 --> 03:46.560
the mainstream stuff.

03:46.560 --> 03:51.080
So yeah, I don't know.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.280
Some of the announcements are disappointing, like seriously, Rockstar, we're going to do

03:54.280 --> 04:02.880
Grand Theft Auto 5 again, again, you know, for a third generation of consoles.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.880
I don't know.

04:03.880 --> 04:10.760
We didn't know more about it, like what exactly the systems can, you know, what are the features

04:10.760 --> 04:11.760
of the system?

04:11.760 --> 04:15.320
And then he kind of showed some of the console and like some of the accessories for some

04:15.320 --> 04:19.040
reason, no PlayStation VR, I'm kind of surprised.

04:19.040 --> 04:24.280
And yet we don't know price or release date or which of those games that they showed are

04:24.280 --> 04:26.960
actually coming out at release.

04:26.960 --> 04:32.120
Or is it going to be release window, you know, the 12 months after release or whatever?

04:33.120 --> 04:34.760
Yeah, I mean, it looks really cool.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.720
A lot of the games look pretty nice.

04:36.720 --> 04:41.600
I don't think that they're necessarily like blowing me away with this looks drastically

04:41.600 --> 04:46.920
different than like the PlayStation 4, but you know, I'll have to see.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.040
And then also with these games, I mean, are they going to be coming out on PlayStation

04:50.040 --> 04:51.040
4 as well?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.840
Or is these all PlayStation 5?

04:52.840 --> 04:56.840
I mean, it's just a lot of like kind of unknowns there.

04:56.840 --> 05:00.240
So yeah, we'll have to see.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.560
So maybe some more specifics on some of these scenarios would have been good for you.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.120
Yeah, I can see that.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.800
You know, we don't know exactly what is a PlayStation 5 exclusive.

05:09.800 --> 05:15.640
Like I'm sure we can assume the horizon, the out west, I forgot the westward, westward

05:15.640 --> 05:16.640
ho.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.360
I forget what was the name of the horizon west life.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
The horizon.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
What was it?

05:23.360 --> 05:27.200
It was horizon Forbidden West.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.200
Thank you.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.200
Horizon Forbidden West.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.680
I can assume that is a PlayStation 5 exclusive.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.960
Well, actually, no, I can't even assume that anymore because there's been all that rumble

05:34.960 --> 05:38.080
rumble rabble about Zero Dawn coming to PC at some point.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.220
But you know what?

05:39.220 --> 05:41.120
What exactly is a PlayStation 5 exclusive?

05:41.120 --> 05:42.600
I think you bring up a good point.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.120
What might be available on PlayStation 4?

05:45.120 --> 05:50.040
The grand theft auto 5 thing I thought certainly was going to lead into a conversation about

05:50.040 --> 05:55.000
the larger conversation about backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 5.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.640
I thought that's how they were opening the door to that conversation.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.080
Here's the first of all of these games.

06:00.080 --> 06:05.640
And granted, yes, Sony has confirmed because there was an odd footing that happened after

06:05.640 --> 06:11.080
the Mark Cerny chat that was originally GDC, where he had said the top 100 games.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.000
And then Sony said, it's going to be a lot more than that.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.960
Those are just like, they kind of quickly corrected that statement.

06:15.960 --> 06:20.780
But they haven't really just given us a firm what to expect of backwards compatibility.

06:20.780 --> 06:26.080
We know PlayStation 4 is there in some capacity, but is it everything?

06:26.080 --> 06:27.600
Did they get every single game?

06:27.600 --> 06:29.200
Are there going to be some things excluded?

06:29.200 --> 06:32.260
What about PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 1?

06:32.260 --> 06:36.840
We know what all those details were going to be because they didn't really go into

06:36.840 --> 06:37.840
any of that.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.280
And I know that's because they have this whole summer thing where they're going to have more

06:41.280 --> 06:46.000
announcements I'm sure, or more stuff to talk about around Gamescom and all that later in

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
the summer.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
So we'll get more details then.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.080
But it's kind of annoying though.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.900
It's like this drip feed of information.

06:51.900 --> 06:58.420
But there's also a part of me that understands the message this episode or whatever was supposed

06:58.420 --> 07:03.700
to be the games, games, games, games, and they didn't really want to deviate from that.

07:03.700 --> 07:07.460
And maybe there's something to be said about what they wanted to talk about the future

07:07.460 --> 07:09.940
of games and maybe not linger so much on the past.

07:09.940 --> 07:15.940
But if that's the case, that Grand Theft Auto 5 was a misstep in my book, but I still found

07:15.940 --> 07:16.940
a lot of positives.

07:16.940 --> 07:20.380
However, before we go on too much longer, I definitely want to let Dark Soccer have

07:20.380 --> 07:21.380
a say.

07:21.380 --> 07:22.380
What was your thoughts?

07:22.380 --> 07:24.580
I don't know if you watched it or saw some of the trailers.

07:24.580 --> 07:26.380
What did you think, Dark Soccer?

07:26.380 --> 07:28.580
I looked and saw a little bit of it.

07:28.580 --> 07:33.020
I'm kind of interested in whatever the Resident Evil thing is going to be.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.660
The design is fine.

07:34.660 --> 07:40.060
I don't even know if that's going to be a final design because they've changed before.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.060
I don't know.

07:42.060 --> 07:47.260
This might sound a little bit odd, but I was really focusing more on social issues right

07:47.260 --> 07:48.260
now.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.260
No, it's not odd at all.

07:49.260 --> 07:58.900
I've been actually doing some design work for a couple of the protest organizations.

07:58.900 --> 08:04.460
Interesting point, though, about the design possibly not being finalized.

08:04.460 --> 08:05.460
You're right.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.020
They don't always.

08:07.020 --> 08:13.260
The thing that jumps in my mind like a neon sign is the PlayStation 3 controller.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.260
Remember when we first saw that at E3 years ago, it was like the boomerang.

08:16.260 --> 08:17.580
I actually kind of liked the boomerang.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.900
That thing was terrible.

08:18.900 --> 08:19.900
I liked it.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.820
It was looking at it made my hands hurt.

08:22.820 --> 08:26.780
All right, five different opinions, whatever.

08:26.780 --> 08:32.100
But when it comes to the console itself, I would be surprised if there was major changes.

08:32.100 --> 08:36.980
But we've I mean, we've seen this thing meme-ified like crazy at this point.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.420
Let me actually roll some footage, of course.

08:38.420 --> 08:41.860
I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this by now, but this is what the PlayStation 5

08:41.860 --> 08:43.540
like reveal actually looked like.

08:43.540 --> 08:47.340
And it's if you hear some ominous music in the background, that's because it's from PlayStation's

08:47.340 --> 08:49.660
official reveal on the YouTube.

08:49.660 --> 08:52.820
And we've seen this thing meme-ified like crazy.

08:52.820 --> 08:59.740
Talk about how it's an Oreo or one of those reverse ones sandwiches.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.860
Talk about how it looks like a Wi-Fi router.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.820
And just we've seen all cells heads.

09:04.820 --> 09:05.820
Yes.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.160
Yeah, we've seen perfect cells head.

09:08.160 --> 09:14.460
And I saw, though, like one where they did like they did like human forms of the systems

09:14.460 --> 09:15.460
is kind of neat.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.460
Yeah.

09:16.580 --> 09:21.020
There were some like a porned up versions, but there were some other tasteful versions

09:21.020 --> 09:23.780
that it's kind of interesting to see that conceptualized.

09:23.780 --> 09:28.380
But I know one that looks really high fashion, actually, that I was like, I'd wear that.

09:28.380 --> 09:34.980
I have to admit, like I, I think it I like it because it's different.

09:34.980 --> 09:39.140
I mean, is it the perfect, you know, figure or whatever?

09:39.140 --> 09:40.140
Maybe not.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.140
But I kind of like that.

09:41.140 --> 09:46.180
It's not just a box, you know, and PlayStation's always well, I shouldn't say always, but they've

09:46.340 --> 09:51.020
they've done some weird things before, like the PlayStation three being a form and grill.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.020
Come on.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.000
Like, that was a weird thing, too.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.540
And and it attracts so much dust.

09:56.540 --> 09:57.540
It did.

09:57.540 --> 10:01.500
I would I would I would rather this system not attract that much dust and this system

10:01.500 --> 10:02.500
be quiet.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
They did.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
Mine's still hooked up.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
OK.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.220
Technically, I have a PlayStation three hooked up here in the corner, but I don't even think

10:09.220 --> 10:11.300
it's hooked into a television right now.

10:11.300 --> 10:17.420
But anyway, I really think at the end of the day, people are not going to pass on the PlayStation

10:17.420 --> 10:21.060
five because they don't like the way the console looks like.

10:21.060 --> 10:27.780
I, I, I guess maybe you might have people that like hold out for a year because maybe

10:27.780 --> 10:30.220
they're not super happy with the launch lineup.

10:30.220 --> 10:33.720
And we all know there's been all these talks and all these renderings.

10:33.720 --> 10:39.140
I'm sure many people have seen that Spider-Man console rendering, which it looked good in

10:39.140 --> 10:40.140
red and so forth.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.620
But these are all fan dreams.

10:41.620 --> 10:46.460
But at some point, the console will likely come out in different colors and different

10:46.460 --> 10:47.780
shapes and things like that.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.860
Or maybe there'll be a mini or something.

10:49.860 --> 10:50.860
Money.

10:50.860 --> 10:51.860
Yeah.

10:51.860 --> 10:52.860
And I know skins.

10:52.860 --> 10:53.860
Yeah.

10:53.860 --> 10:54.860
And I could see people maybe holding out for that.

10:54.860 --> 10:59.940
But I feel like if if there's really the games on this console, people want to play day one,

10:59.940 --> 11:01.980
they'll figure out where to put that console.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.500
And it's not going to be a big deal.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.860
Like the look of it is not a big deal.

11:05.860 --> 11:13.340
I wondered myself if the shape wasn't in part to do with air circulation and maybe having

11:13.340 --> 11:19.220
the odd shape meant that the vents would have to be exposed a little bit and you wouldn't

11:19.220 --> 11:22.220
maybe be able to fit it into a very tight, confined space.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.220
Very easy.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.520
And maybe that's intentional.

11:24.520 --> 11:30.620
I'm just, that's my like a tinfoil hat theory, I guess if nothing else, maybe, maybe I don't

11:30.620 --> 11:31.620
know.

11:31.620 --> 11:33.100
It does look very tall.

11:33.100 --> 11:39.340
I wish they had shown there was a shot that I saw where the system can be laid horizontally

11:39.340 --> 11:46.220
as well, because otherwise that looks like it's going to be a hard fit for my entertainment

11:46.220 --> 11:47.220
console.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.580
I don't think I'd be even able to fit it in there.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.580
Otherwise it had to lay flat.

11:50.580 --> 11:55.460
And I kind of like, you know, like everyone's like dogging on the Xbox console, but I like

11:55.460 --> 11:57.860
my console to be kind of flat because I can stack them.

11:57.860 --> 12:03.060
Yeah, I know that's not really making sense for, you know, thermal design and everything.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.020
But I like being able to stack stuff.

12:05.020 --> 12:09.600
I loved having my PlayStation 2 and being able to stack stuff on top of it or my Xbox

12:09.600 --> 12:10.600
360.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.060
I like them being somewhat flat so that you can do that.

12:14.060 --> 12:19.300
Even if it's not necessarily like another game console, maybe like controllers or something.

12:19.300 --> 12:25.820
You know, the PlayStation 3, I had that and it had to be off to the side because it didn't

12:25.820 --> 12:28.500
really fit anywhere and you couldn't put anything on top of it.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.060
So it was really awkward.

12:30.060 --> 12:32.700
And I don't care, whatever, who cares what the console looks like.

12:32.700 --> 12:38.220
Let's talk a little bit about the fact that you have now a disk drive version or a Blu-ray

12:38.220 --> 12:42.660
drive version and we have a no Blu-ray version.

12:42.660 --> 12:46.220
And this is something we've already seen Microsoft do in the last generation, but I believe this

12:46.220 --> 12:50.260
is the first time we're seeing Sony go this direction of an all digital console.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.580
We didn't hear anything about price.

12:52.580 --> 12:56.900
We didn't hear anything about release date, which I can understand the release date side

12:56.900 --> 13:00.940
of things because they're probably still trying to navigate the waters with COVID and everything.

13:01.180 --> 13:07.300
And second wave, especially in countries where these things are produced and so forth, there's

13:07.300 --> 13:11.500
still probably a lot of to be determined when it comes to that.

13:11.500 --> 13:16.700
And the price, though, I think a lot of people are getting the sense they're playing chicken

13:16.700 --> 13:22.820
with Microsoft a little bit, but having the two different options certainly opens the

13:22.820 --> 13:28.300
door for them to be able to say, oh, we're going to price this one below Microsoft.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.780
We're going to price this one above Microsoft.

13:31.340 --> 13:37.540
I kind of feel like it's going to be obvious that Xbox Series X will also have disk drive.

13:38.340 --> 13:41.580
Microsoft will also do that because they've already done that.

13:41.940 --> 13:46.460
They already have a digital version of the Xbox one, so that's not a new thing.

13:48.220 --> 13:54.020
I just don't, I need to know what the price difference is before I would decide.

13:54.020 --> 13:58.380
And I'd still probably, even though I do mostly digital purchases anyways, I still like having

13:58.380 --> 13:59.580
the flexibility for it.

13:59.580 --> 14:06.060
So I would probably just still get one with the drive either, unless it's like several

14:06.060 --> 14:06.980
hundred dollars more.

14:08.340 --> 14:14.100
But I don't know, I would have to see really what the cost savings is going to be on that.

14:14.540 --> 14:19.060
But I still like the flexibility of it, even if it's not something I'm going to be using a

14:19.060 --> 14:19.380
lot.

14:20.380 --> 14:24.820
Dark Sakura, do you think digital versus disk is a conversation that will happen in your

14:24.820 --> 14:25.220
household?

14:26.140 --> 14:32.620
Probably, we're kind of blasé about some things, like we may get a physical copy if it's

14:32.620 --> 14:34.380
got stuff I think that we want with it.

14:34.900 --> 14:40.860
But I don't know, since the whole quarantine started going on, I think that we did get a

14:40.860 --> 14:44.420
little bit less on top of the physical media side of things.

14:44.580 --> 14:45.860
Really, it was just Animal Crossing.

14:46.140 --> 14:53.100
So, you know, now me, I want good packaging, I want good artwork, I want to be able to see

14:53.100 --> 14:58.620
it and look at it and enjoy it and put it somewhere so I can still look at it and see it

14:58.620 --> 14:59.500
and enjoy it.

15:00.980 --> 15:05.660
We have, I mean, well, you've seen what my closet, my game room looks like full of the

15:05.660 --> 15:08.540
boxes and some of the best artwork that you know, that you can see.

15:08.540 --> 15:12.500
So I would rather enjoy having a physical copy.

15:12.500 --> 15:16.020
However, I also enjoy having space and we are running quite short of it.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.300
Let me ask a weird question.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.540
This might be a stupid question, but there's no such thing as stupid questions, right?

15:21.540 --> 15:22.580
Unless I'm the one asking them.

15:22.580 --> 15:23.780
Only stupid people.

15:23.780 --> 15:25.700
OK, well, then this is a stupid people statement.

15:27.100 --> 15:35.220
Could the disk driveless version be a response to COVID and this new world we find ourselves in?

15:36.060 --> 15:41.860
No, it's because the system's going to be expensive and so they want to have a version that's cheaper.

15:41.900 --> 15:42.380
That's all.

15:43.620 --> 15:51.620
How many, I mean, not too many, say, laptops come with a CD, DVD drive.

15:52.740 --> 15:55.060
I mean, again, cuts down on cost.

15:55.060 --> 15:56.100
You can make a better computer.

15:56.340 --> 15:58.820
So I look at it that way.

15:59.380 --> 16:04.580
Does any a lot of laptops don't come with a drive so they can make them thinner.

16:04.820 --> 16:11.740
But with any well, maybe not so much on the Mac side of the house, but on the PC side, you have

16:11.740 --> 16:12.660
multiple storefronts.

16:12.660 --> 16:18.020
You can purchase software from multiple options to make purchases, whereas you have a closed

16:18.020 --> 16:22.380
system with PlayStation or Microsoft and or purchasing things.

16:22.380 --> 16:28.140
So it's granted they do a lot more sales nowadays, I think, digitally, but.

16:29.180 --> 16:33.900
It's really, you know, you're only going to be purchasing it there, and if it goes on sale, it's

16:33.900 --> 16:38.020
because the publishers decided to put it on sale and you can't get stuff secondhand, you can't

16:38.020 --> 16:39.180
sell used games.

16:40.540 --> 16:45.340
If that's important to you, then, you know, something to consider.

16:45.380 --> 16:49.460
I, you know, like I said, I like the flexibility whether I use it or not.

16:49.460 --> 16:56.460
I know with this generation, PlayStation 4, it's been mostly digital, like 99% of the stuff I

16:56.460 --> 16:57.940
bought is digital.

16:58.620 --> 16:59.500
So I don't know.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.900
I'm still buying a lot of physical things.

17:01.900 --> 17:06.100
I mean, I'm open to digital and I do more and more digital, especially on the Switch, because I

17:06.100 --> 17:07.300
like the portability and all that.

17:07.300 --> 17:10.420
But there's still a lot of physical things I buy.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.180
But I don't know.

17:11.180 --> 17:17.620
I mean, I'm not as like staunchly against an all digital thing as I once was at one point.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.860
I mean, after all, and I think this point got brought up in chat.

17:20.860 --> 17:22.780
I'm sorry, guys, I don't mean to ignore you guys in chat.

17:23.020 --> 17:27.820
My phone is all digital and I have a ton of applications and software and games and the like on my

17:27.820 --> 17:32.300
phone, you know, so it's not like an all digital thing is a completely foreign concept.

17:32.460 --> 17:36.860
Now, what's funny, and this comment made me laugh in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

17:36.860 --> 17:40.380
because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

17:40.380 --> 17:41.780
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

17:42.180 --> 17:46.420
And Quest Buster says the Phantom called and wants people to remember it was a thing.

17:46.820 --> 17:47.900
Well, the what?

17:48.300 --> 17:48.820
The Phantom.

17:48.820 --> 17:49.220
Remember that?

17:49.300 --> 17:50.100
Phantoms.

17:50.140 --> 17:50.460
The what?

17:50.460 --> 17:51.020
Phantom.

17:51.060 --> 17:51.620
Phantoms.

17:51.660 --> 17:52.500
Oh, that was a movie.

17:52.540 --> 17:52.860
Right.

17:52.900 --> 17:53.740
A really bad movie.

17:54.660 --> 17:54.980
Anyway.

17:54.980 --> 17:55.380
Wasn't it bad?

17:55.700 --> 17:56.100
I don't remember.

17:56.100 --> 17:56.540
I don't remember.

17:56.620 --> 18:02.260
Anyway, the point with all that is, is that there is such a thing as being ahead of your time.

18:02.820 --> 18:08.220
Hello, the Sega Dreamcast called, you know, there is such a thing as like you're too ahead of your

18:08.220 --> 18:11.980
time that it just doesn't catch on, you know, the same way.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.060
And maybe in a way, that's what happened with the Phantom.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.180
Well, Tiger Claw has a good point too.

18:17.180 --> 18:21.100
Like speaking about backwards compatibility, we don't know how that's going to work.

18:21.100 --> 18:27.180
So if say, for example, the system is backwards compatible with PlayStation one, two, three, four

18:27.900 --> 18:32.020
games, you know, and those can be read via the disk drive.

18:32.100 --> 18:37.060
It may be advantageous to have a disk drive in the system so that you can play all those.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.060
That's a very good point.

18:38.060 --> 18:42.780
You're going to need a disk drive if backwards compatibility beyond four is a thing.

18:43.020 --> 18:47.540
I mean, and even with four being a thing, if you have PlayStation four disks, unless you have a

18:47.540 --> 18:51.340
digital license, a PlayStation five is not going to automatically recognize that.

18:51.340 --> 18:57.780
So that's a very excellent thought for folks that are considering disk versus, um, digital, uh,

18:57.820 --> 18:58.260
quickly.

18:58.260 --> 19:01.660
And then, then I want to talk a little more about some of the games at the PlayStation five event

19:01.660 --> 19:02.100
quickly.

19:02.300 --> 19:06.820
Does anybody want to tinfoil hat what the price and date?

19:07.100 --> 19:11.940
You don't have to hit the date on the head, but what the price and date ish will be.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.300
Any of my co-hosts want to take a stab at it?

19:16.300 --> 19:25.020
Uh, four 99, five 99 and November.

19:26.700 --> 19:27.300
Dark soccer.

19:28.460 --> 19:28.700
Low.

19:28.700 --> 19:33.660
It's going to be four 99, a higher model system is going to run about six 50, 700.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.220
They did it before.

19:36.860 --> 19:40.860
Um, I am also going to go, I'm going to go with a four 99, five 99.

19:40.860 --> 19:46.780
I don't think dark soccer's thought is beyond because, you know, again, if the diskless one is

19:46.780 --> 19:48.580
four 99, that's what they're going to say.

19:48.580 --> 19:54.180
The price is, and we all remember when Sony got a lot of shit during the PlayStation three reveal

19:54.180 --> 19:56.020
with the 599 us dollars.

19:56.300 --> 20:01.860
If they hit that mark or beyond it with the one with the disk drive, they are not going to be

20:01.860 --> 20:06.780
emphasizing that price there that you're going to see all the marketing material says starting at

20:06.940 --> 20:08.020
four 99.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.700
That's what it will all say.

20:10.220 --> 20:15.060
Uh, as far as the timeframe, I'm going to predict a delay to March.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.740
I don't think it comes out this year.

20:17.820 --> 20:21.540
And I, I know, yes, I know all the games are already saying holiday and so forth.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.340
I I'm going to be the weirdo that says they don't make it.

20:24.580 --> 20:29.940
And it's, it's because of, of the COVID situation and just the supply demand type of thing.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.540
I don't think it makes the holiday, but we'll see.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.020
All right.

20:34.260 --> 20:42.780
Um, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, DJ Rama S says, here's the deal on

20:42.780 --> 20:46.900
backwards compatibility, whether it's Xbox series X or PlayStation five, both systems have the

20:46.900 --> 20:49.260
hardware to be backwards compatible with its older systems.

20:49.260 --> 20:54.420
The issues lies into licensing, meaning of third party companies want their games to be played on

20:54.420 --> 20:55.220
the newest system.

20:55.500 --> 21:00.220
It is a weird thing to think about in a way though, when we think like, Oh, the PlayStation two

21:00.220 --> 21:02.820
just played every single PlayStation one game.

21:03.060 --> 21:07.820
And I'm trying to think, have we, uh, and maybe the Wii U played every Wii game and those things

21:07.820 --> 21:12.700
weren't really a problem, but backwards compatibility isn't as common as you'd necessarily think.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.140
Maybe.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.940
Although Nintendo did a very good job with their handheld systems.

21:15.980 --> 21:20.460
I would say the handheld systems where we got really spoiled, like Game Boy Color played Game Boy

21:20.460 --> 21:24.300
games, Game Boy Advance played Game Boy Color games, DS played advanced games, 3DS played DS

21:24.300 --> 21:24.500
games.

21:24.660 --> 21:28.780
Like they've, their portables were like always very good with backwards compatibility, but

21:28.780 --> 21:31.340
otherwise we don't see it a lot.

21:31.940 --> 21:33.380
Oh, interesting.

21:33.860 --> 21:39.060
Um, Phoenix 7726 says, wait, they have a cell processor for PS3 play, huh?

21:39.500 --> 21:42.380
Uh, we don't know yet for sure.

21:42.420 --> 21:46.060
We don't know, um, what that's going to entail.

21:46.180 --> 21:51.580
We don't know if it would be emulation or if it's even going to be there or could they do something

21:51.580 --> 21:54.660
via PlayStation now and their streaming service.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.100
Like we don't, we don't know.

21:57.540 --> 21:58.660
It could be any of those things.

21:58.780 --> 22:00.540
So, all right.

22:00.940 --> 22:06.340
Anyhow, uh, let's talk a little more about some of the games that we saw at the PlayStation event.

22:06.340 --> 22:11.060
We've mentioned a couple of them, such as the, um, Horizon Forbidden West, but what about some of the

22:11.060 --> 22:11.660
other games?

22:11.660 --> 22:13.580
Were there other things that caught your eye?

22:13.580 --> 22:17.140
I know a lot of people were talking about Spider-Man, Miles Morales.

22:17.580 --> 22:20.020
A lot of people were lighting up at that trailer.

22:20.660 --> 22:21.780
Yeah, that looked pretty good.

22:21.780 --> 22:26.820
I haven't played the original one, but it looks like a great game and I, the new one looks pretty good too.

22:27.060 --> 22:30.580
It was a little confusing because at first, you know, everyone's like, oh, a new game.

22:30.580 --> 22:33.060
And then, then it was like, oh, it's only expansion.

22:33.140 --> 22:36.500
Oh, is it a, you know, is it a new game or is it an expansion?

22:36.500 --> 22:41.700
So apparently what it sounds like, it's, it's a spinoff kind of like how they did with infamous.

22:41.700 --> 22:42.660
They have like that.

22:42.700 --> 22:47.820
I don't remember what the subtitle was on that one, but there was one that was like a, a spinoff game in

22:47.820 --> 22:50.580
the same engine, but it's its own thing.

22:50.980 --> 22:56.540
So, um, I think it's just a spinoff.

22:56.740 --> 23:01.220
Um, I don't know if it's like an expansion with the remastered game or something like that.

23:01.220 --> 23:05.220
Well, they, they really butchered the messaging after that trailer, because you had that executive

23:05.220 --> 23:09.380
who said, oh, it's no, it's the original, uh, one with additional content.

23:09.620 --> 23:13.980
And then they had Insomniac had to come out and say, no, it's an all new game.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.300
It's just not Spider-Man two.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.300
It's like a Spider-Man side thing.

23:17.300 --> 23:19.380
Like, and they said it was like Uncharted.

23:19.380 --> 23:22.420
Uncharted had that side game that came out not that long ago.

23:22.700 --> 23:26.340
Um, and of course I forget the subtitle in the moment, Lost Legacy.

23:26.340 --> 23:26.860
Was that it?

23:27.100 --> 23:29.020
So, uh, they, they had that.

23:29.020 --> 23:34.780
So it's, you know, but it's, it's going to be a similar game, you know, in that.

23:35.060 --> 23:39.660
Or, uh, another good one might be like, there's Bioshock two and then there's Bioshock Infinite.

23:39.820 --> 23:40.860
Which one's the sequel?

23:43.460 --> 23:45.060
Well, technically both are.

23:46.060 --> 23:46.620
Right.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.980
Infinite's a side story though.

23:48.980 --> 23:50.540
Infinite ties everything together.

23:51.260 --> 23:53.340
I know, I know, but which one's the sequel?

23:53.340 --> 23:56.260
So there's, there's different ways you can kind of do a sequel.

23:56.260 --> 24:01.980
I think, I don't know, but they really butchered the messaging on that.

24:02.060 --> 24:05.540
So, uh, I think it's, it's going to be a fine game.

24:05.540 --> 24:09.140
If you enjoyed the Spider-Man game, there's no reason you're not going to like this one as well.

24:09.140 --> 24:09.820
I'm sure.

24:10.060 --> 24:12.580
And it will be prettier cause it's on PlayStation five.

24:13.020 --> 24:18.340
Um, Dark Soccer already mentioned Resident Evil eight, the village or village, uh, that looks scary.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.580
That looked like it might've been a VR thing as well.

24:20.860 --> 24:27.340
And you pointed out, they avoided talk about VR to all the last game was fully playable in VR.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.260
So it makes sense that this one is.

24:29.940 --> 24:30.340
Yeah.

24:31.180 --> 24:34.060
Uh, Gran Turismo seven was pretty.

24:34.060 --> 24:34.380
Yeah.

24:34.620 --> 24:34.940
Yeah.

24:34.940 --> 24:35.460
Look pretty.

24:35.780 --> 24:36.060
Yeah.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.100
I don't like sim games though.

24:38.380 --> 24:38.620
Yeah.

24:38.620 --> 24:42.140
I don't usually get into the racing sim games, but it, it did look pretty.

24:42.260 --> 24:44.500
How about Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart?

24:44.900 --> 24:48.060
Um, that, that game play was really smooth.

24:48.060 --> 24:51.620
Like it, it was kind of neat to watch that game play, uh, flow.

24:53.100 --> 24:53.380
Yeah.

24:53.380 --> 24:56.180
I think that was one of the trailers I missed originally.

24:56.220 --> 24:59.740
Um, I saw the announcement for it, but it looked, it looks nice.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.780
Looks better than the movie that they did.

25:03.380 --> 25:07.420
I totally forgot about the movie, but yeah, it was just probably a good thing that you forget about it.

25:07.780 --> 25:08.100
Yeah.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.980
It just, it really snapped as they were moving from like, you know, place to place.

25:11.980 --> 25:17.300
Like, I, I definitely think that was a way to show off the solid state drive and the types of things that that can bring to it.

25:17.300 --> 25:18.340
So it was interesting.

25:18.660 --> 25:26.100
Uh, the Demon's Souls remake, uh, they didn't really show us a lot outside of a, you know, creepy looking trailer, no gameplay here.

25:26.540 --> 25:31.660
Um, but I'm sure that'll be something that Alan will be into if I pick up the PlayStation five right away.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.500
Cause I know he likes those games.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.020
I liked the trailer for Deathloop.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.060
Did you guys see that?

25:38.100 --> 25:42.700
The Arkane Studios game, which kind of was, I forgot all about that.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.300
They'd shown that last year at the Bethesda thing.

25:45.380 --> 25:50.780
Um, and I completely forgot about it because originally when I saw it, I was like, Oh, another dishonored.

25:50.780 --> 25:53.060
And it's like, definitely I'm like, Oh yeah, that's right.

25:53.060 --> 25:53.580
They have that game.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.980
Um, yeah, it looks interesting.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.380
I like the art style.

25:57.660 --> 26:04.460
Uh, NBA 2K21 was there, which, you know, I thought that was a very odd approach to really focus on the sweat.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.700
I don't think sweat is a thing that people like to think about a lot.

26:07.700 --> 26:12.460
Um, so that was a sweat and thinking about how much money you're gonna be spending on microtransactions.

26:13.260 --> 26:22.660
It was an odd approach to a trailer, but I mean, we can't sit here and go sports, whatever, because sports games, people do buy those.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.900
A lot of people buy those.

26:23.900 --> 26:24.660
So it's important.

26:24.700 --> 26:29.060
Can't wait to see the extreme fidelity in the bugginess of the new WWE.

26:29.100 --> 26:29.500
Oh, that's right.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.500
They're skipping this year.

26:30.780 --> 26:33.620
Well, hopefully it's not a piece of garbage.

26:33.620 --> 26:42.180
I mean, NBA 2K is usually okay, but that's, that's only in comparison to NBA, uh, I don't even know what they call the EA one.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.860
I guess it doesn't matter because that one's not very good.

26:45.380 --> 26:50.820
But yeah, it's just, it's a big mess of microtransactions and loot boxes.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.980
Uh, that's all I think of that series.

26:52.980 --> 26:55.940
So, uh, and then we had Sackboy.

26:56.020 --> 27:01.620
I was excited about that because I kind of feel like the little big planet games kind of need to come back a little bit.

27:01.780 --> 27:08.340
And this is sort of that it seems like now I completely understand media molecules moved on to dreams and they have a big old thing.

27:08.500 --> 27:15.340
So I'm, I, it's kind of one of those, Oh, I didn't think they'd go back to this idea, but Sackboy is a PlayStation mascot of sorts.

27:15.540 --> 27:17.180
And the trailer looked really cute.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.420
I was into it.

27:20.540 --> 27:22.580
This, this, it looks cool.

27:22.820 --> 27:29.340
I was just gonna say the little sack girl they had in the trailer looks just like one of my friends in her Burning Man photos, straight up.

27:29.460 --> 27:30.980
I don't know if you saw the little sack girl.

27:31.180 --> 27:33.340
She looks straight up like one of my friends at Burning Man.

27:33.780 --> 27:42.100
Well, I always used to like, granted, like I didn't never really mess too much with the actual level creators and everything in those games.

27:42.140 --> 27:47.260
Um, even though they're really, you know, cool, but I love playing like the single player campaigns and stuff.

27:47.260 --> 27:50.540
So, I mean, I'm sure this would be great.

27:51.380 --> 27:54.860
Uh, and I'm sorry guys, I'm just not going to have time to dive into everything.

27:54.860 --> 27:57.540
So I'm just kind of doing a few like standouts for me here.

27:57.860 --> 28:02.940
I thought that Hitman 3 trailer, like when, when it was going, I was like, Ooh, what game is this?

28:02.940 --> 28:03.620
This looks neat.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.300
And then they were like, it's Hitman 3.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.700
And I was like, it's Hitman?

28:06.900 --> 28:07.380
Really?

28:07.380 --> 28:11.300
I don't, I usually pass on those games, but that looked, that was one of the better looking trailers.

28:11.300 --> 28:11.860
I really thought.

28:12.260 --> 28:13.420
That looked pretty exciting.

28:13.460 --> 28:18.020
Um, the other one that I really liked too, that was pretty cool looking is, uh, Ghostwire Tokyo.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.060
That looked really cool.

28:20.260 --> 28:23.820
Where they're like fighting demons and stuff like that, that, that was pretty sweet.

28:23.820 --> 28:29.980
And then, uh, Pragmata was another one that like really trippy, uh, I don't even know what it is.

28:29.980 --> 28:31.580
It's some game from Capcom.

28:31.900 --> 28:32.700
It looked pretty awesome.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.020
I really liked Returnal.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.260
That was the one with the, the woman in space.

28:37.300 --> 28:42.020
Otherwise it was a little bit vague what that might be about, but I usually like space sci-fi games.

28:42.380 --> 28:46.940
Um, it looked like it might be a little bit of a, a platformer type of game.

28:46.980 --> 28:48.780
Uh, I'm kind of curious more about that.

28:48.780 --> 28:51.740
So I'm curious to see some, uh, some, uh, gameplay on that.

28:51.980 --> 28:56.780
The Square Enix game, Project Aethia, that looked hot, hot, hot.

28:56.780 --> 29:01.500
I mean, again, we need to see more gameplay, but I was living for that character design.

29:01.660 --> 29:03.500
The environments looked awesome.

29:03.540 --> 29:07.140
That was a, I mean, again, it's, it was a little bit of a cryptic trailer.

29:07.140 --> 29:10.220
Cause you don't really see what the game was, but I was, I was into that.

29:10.260 --> 29:12.660
I don't know about you guys, but that was, that was great.

29:13.220 --> 29:16.860
Is that there, that engine that they showed off like a long time ago?

29:17.100 --> 29:20.700
Well, it's the luminous engine, which is what Final Fantasy 15 was built in.

29:20.940 --> 29:25.580
It was not, I do not believe it was the one that they showed a couple E3s

29:25.580 --> 29:29.700
ago that people were like, Oh, is this like the first look at Final Fantasy 16?

29:29.700 --> 29:30.820
And they're not calling it that.

29:31.020 --> 29:33.820
I don't think this project relates to that.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.180
I think it's really cool.

29:36.260 --> 29:36.540
Yeah.

29:37.340 --> 29:42.060
Um, and then I also, of course, the game, the game of the show was stray.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.620
That was the one where you're the cat and there was all the robots,

29:45.620 --> 29:46.660
but you're playing as the cat.

29:46.820 --> 29:49.180
And you know, I'm always here for a game where you're playing as the cat.

29:49.740 --> 29:50.220
That's for sure.

29:50.540 --> 29:51.340
That one looked good.

29:51.340 --> 29:54.780
I also liked, it was that, uh, Kena Bridge of Spirits.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.380
That one was pretty cool looking.

29:56.780 --> 29:57.100
Yeah.

29:57.500 --> 30:04.700
Um, and then, uh, was it, so, uh, Goodbye Volcano High looked interesting.

30:04.780 --> 30:08.980
Um, I, it looks like I basically watching a cartoon.

30:09.500 --> 30:14.060
Um, and then of course, uh, we have to talk about Bugsnax.

30:14.220 --> 30:17.980
We do have to talk about Bugsnax cause that song was very catchy.

30:18.300 --> 30:22.100
But when I hear that bug sack, bug snack song, all I can hear.

30:22.100 --> 30:27.060
Cause I saw a tweet and now all I hear is butt sex when I hear that song,

30:27.220 --> 30:32.900
instead of hearing bug snacks, but I think, but sex, but so like, then

30:32.900 --> 30:34.100
now it's going to happen to you too.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.380
Next time you hear that song.

30:35.380 --> 30:36.060
So you're welcome.

30:36.060 --> 30:38.860
I thought like when I first saw it, I was like, it was like a cloudy with a

30:38.860 --> 30:41.220
chance of meatballs game and be like, what is this?

30:41.220 --> 30:47.020
Cause it looks very similar to that, uh, premise, but then it gets weird.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.580
So, you know, I don't know.

30:49.700 --> 30:53.500
So overall, you know, trying to, trying to tie this up so we can move on to

30:53.500 --> 30:57.460
other big announcements in the week overall, like, how did you feel about,

30:57.460 --> 30:58.900
because this was a different format.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.140
This was a different way of doing this information.

31:01.140 --> 31:03.780
How did you feel about what Sony brought to the table this week?

31:03.780 --> 31:04.180
Anybody?

31:06.620 --> 31:09.700
It was good, except for, uh, Godfall.

31:09.700 --> 31:14.220
I, that I can't get excited about that game, but everything else looks pretty cool.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.260
I just wish there was more of it.

31:17.020 --> 31:20.180
I kind of miss the, the, you know, overwhelming amount of

31:20.180 --> 31:22.020
information during E3 week.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.500
I kind of like, I really liked though.

31:25.500 --> 31:28.740
And I think the best thing about this, which not a lot of people are talking

31:28.740 --> 31:33.500
about is just that this was a bullshit free, I shouldn't say bullshit free,

31:33.860 --> 31:38.220
but they really like the, the method of how they had to do this.

31:38.220 --> 31:42.540
Not that I am, not that I'm saying COVID is a great thing by any means.

31:42.580 --> 31:43.460
Absolutely not.

31:43.780 --> 31:48.020
But PlayStation having to adjust things because of COVID, like this

31:48.020 --> 31:52.500
was like the tightest, like bullshit free presentation I've ever seen them do.

31:52.740 --> 31:58.820
It was such a contrast to the year that they only had four games to show at E3.

31:58.820 --> 32:01.500
And they were moving people from room to room for some type of like

32:01.500 --> 32:03.180
artistic experience or something.

32:03.380 --> 32:07.140
Like this was just game, game, game, game, game, game, game.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.540
And I, I think that's what a lot of people want to see.

32:10.540 --> 32:15.020
And I, I kind of applaud their approach because I thought it was well done.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.700
And I think even more than the Microsoft event, a couple of weeks

32:17.700 --> 32:20.180
ago, we saw more gameplay.

32:20.180 --> 32:23.580
We saw, you know, we didn't see it for every game, but we saw enough of a

32:23.580 --> 32:26.580
taste of this is what the machine's actually going to look like in motion.

32:26.860 --> 32:28.380
You know, and got a sense of that.

32:28.660 --> 32:33.540
And so I, I, I kind of applaud it and I noticed, I don't know if you guys noticed,

32:33.540 --> 32:37.540
but I certainly noticed a lot of the protagonists, a lot of the characters

32:37.540 --> 32:43.180
in the games, we had a pretty welcoming, diverse lineup of characters in these

32:43.180 --> 32:48.500
games that were featured and I was, I was very happy to see it, so I don't know.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.140
Was it just me?

32:49.180 --> 32:51.780
I thought there was a pretty good mix in there.

32:52.540 --> 32:53.580
So, yeah, definitely.

32:54.580 --> 32:54.980
All right.

32:55.180 --> 32:59.500
Well, let's move on and talk about the PC gaming show.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.860
Uh, so look, I didn't even watch.

33:01.900 --> 33:04.180
I just read some of the headlines, but Loki, what were your

33:04.180 --> 33:05.460
thoughts on the PC gaming show?

33:06.180 --> 33:09.540
Um, I also didn't watch it too much or at all.

33:09.580 --> 33:12.780
Um, I was just catching some of the different highlights that they had.

33:12.780 --> 33:15.820
So, uh, one of the things I was excited about, it looks really

33:15.820 --> 33:18.220
different than the last one was.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.060
Um, Oh God, what is it?

33:21.100 --> 33:25.140
It's a, I'm trying to find the, uh, a surgeon simulator too.

33:25.300 --> 33:28.180
Um, so that one looks really weird.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.220
It's co-op this time.

33:29.220 --> 33:35.340
Plus there's an element of like, um, you can build your own surgery

33:35.340 --> 33:36.540
rooms and stuff like that.

33:36.540 --> 33:39.140
And then it looks like there's like almost like an adventure mode or

33:39.140 --> 33:42.300
something like that, that you are solving puzzles with people, but

33:42.300 --> 33:43.580
it's just all sorts of crazy.

33:43.820 --> 33:45.420
So that looked pretty neat.

33:45.500 --> 33:51.180
Um, some of the other stuff that they showed that looked interesting

33:51.180 --> 33:52.660
that Proteus always looks good.

33:52.700 --> 33:55.100
That's that kind of a retro looking shooter game.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.900
Uh, I don't know.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.500
Icarus kind of neat looking.

34:02.300 --> 34:08.900
Um, it's, I don't know, a lot survival games, but yeah, Icarus, I guess

34:08.940 --> 34:12.940
that's the one that was, Oh, so that's the one that's, uh, that was

34:12.940 --> 34:14.580
by the folks that did DayZ.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.780
So it's, it's a survival game where it's like you're on a different

34:17.780 --> 34:23.900
planet, you land there and so, uh, neat looking, um, I don't know.

34:23.940 --> 34:25.260
This is not a lot.

34:25.300 --> 34:29.860
The PC game showcase was never one that I would always get excited about.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.940
I guess one of the exciting things though, if you're a fan of the series

34:32.940 --> 34:37.900
that Torchlight 3 was out on Steam that day, so that was a pretty cool announcement.

34:38.340 --> 34:41.900
Um, other than that, I mean, I don't know.

34:42.060 --> 34:44.700
I was excited about Torchlight 3, that's for sure.

34:44.700 --> 34:48.300
But then I started seeing some of the like reception to it and some of the,

34:48.340 --> 34:52.140
not that I want to listen to user reviews, but a lot of people are kind

34:52.180 --> 34:55.100
of saying, boy, it kind of feels like it was a free to play game that

34:55.100 --> 34:58.220
was shifted around a little bit, but I'm going to, I'm going to wait

34:58.220 --> 35:01.140
until it's a little further on because it is in early access.

35:01.380 --> 35:03.140
So let's cut it a little slack.

35:03.380 --> 35:06.340
I want to see what it looks like a little further along, but generally

35:06.340 --> 35:07.780
I'm excited about Torchlight 3.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.060
So, yeah, so I don't know.

35:13.100 --> 35:18.300
Um, like I said, I'm, I miss that the, the whole presentation for that.

35:18.540 --> 35:23.780
Um, it's typically one that I do normally miss anyways, so I don't

35:23.780 --> 35:29.580
know, not a huge deal for me, but I'm sure there's, there's a lot of stuff

35:29.580 --> 35:34.300
out there for folks that are fans of PC gaming, I just, a lot of this stuff,

35:34.300 --> 35:36.900
especially when it comes down to like some of these simulation games and

35:36.900 --> 35:42.780
everything, I just don't play a lot of the strategies, same games, but I mean,

35:42.780 --> 35:47.180
I know there's a certain simulator too I'm definitely excited for, especially

35:47.180 --> 35:52.260
if they, I'm hoping that they get VR in that as well, um, and then I'm sure

35:52.260 --> 35:53.940
that I'll come to console at some point.

35:54.660 --> 35:57.420
Um, so yeah, we'll have to wait and see.

35:58.380 --> 36:01.660
Did you actually watch the PC gaming thing or did you just kind of sift

36:01.660 --> 36:03.100
through what was announced like I did?

36:03.300 --> 36:04.660
I sifted through it.

36:04.780 --> 36:06.980
Yeah, cause I was, I was kind of curious cause you know, that, that

36:06.980 --> 36:09.860
show has never gotten a good review since the year it started.

36:10.060 --> 36:12.780
So I was kind of curious if they were, I mean, I don't know, chat, did

36:12.780 --> 36:13.980
anybody in chat take a look at it?

36:13.980 --> 36:15.980
Cause I'm kind of curious about it.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.060
I know, right?

36:17.060 --> 36:18.780
Like it was, I totally forgot.

36:19.060 --> 36:24.100
That's the problem with this year is that with not everything being this

36:24.100 --> 36:27.900
week, I can't keep track of what's when, because it's all over the map.

36:28.300 --> 36:28.860
You know what I mean?

36:28.860 --> 36:31.460
It like, it used to be like, Oh, it's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and

36:31.460 --> 36:32.740
all day, we'll have some announcements.

36:32.740 --> 36:35.220
It's kind of, it's kind of hard to stay on top of it.

36:35.220 --> 36:35.740
That's for sure.

36:36.540 --> 36:36.820
All right.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.060
Yeah.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.700
Proteus looks amazing.

36:39.260 --> 36:44.020
That one is, that one's like kind of, it's a, imagine if you will, a Doom

36:44.020 --> 36:48.340
running a Doom engine with like modern effects and lighting and everything.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.140
So it looks pretty, pretty awesome in that sense.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.660
It's got a really unique looking style to it.

36:54.100 --> 36:54.380
Okay.

36:54.580 --> 36:57.940
And then there was yet yet another, and I think it's a completely new game as

36:57.940 --> 37:02.220
well, cause there's been a several that have come out or been announced already,

37:02.340 --> 37:06.380
but I thought that there was a third rhythm shooter game that they had out

37:06.380 --> 37:11.060
there now, so it was like three games, almost in the same genre that's brand new.

37:11.380 --> 37:15.060
Um, I don't remember what that was called though, but I know there's

37:15.060 --> 37:16.780
Was it Hellsinger?

37:16.780 --> 37:19.300
Cause that's in our next batch of news is the Hellsinger.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.420
No, not Hellsinger.

37:20.460 --> 37:23.340
It was, um, it's something metal.

37:23.340 --> 37:25.780
I don't remember what it's called, but there's, there's like three different

37:25.780 --> 37:28.860
games that are kind of have that same mechanic to them now.

37:29.420 --> 37:31.180
It's like everyone came up with the idea at the same time.

37:31.540 --> 37:34.460
Well, let me move on into some of the other announcements from this week,

37:34.460 --> 37:37.060
because there were a spattering of other things that were announced

37:37.060 --> 37:37.980
during the week as well.

37:38.060 --> 37:42.540
And one of the ones I definitely want to get into, uh, because I was really

37:42.540 --> 37:45.300
excited to see this and it kind of came out of nowhere and I imagined dark

37:45.300 --> 37:48.260
soccer has gotta be feeling some kind of way about this, but that is the

37:48.340 --> 37:52.860
Alex Kidd in a Miracle World Deluxe or DX that they, uh, showed.

37:52.860 --> 37:54.420
Did you, did you see this dark saga?

37:54.980 --> 37:55.500
Yes, I did.

37:55.620 --> 37:56.660
I'm pretty happy about it.

37:56.660 --> 37:57.100
Me too.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.620
Cause it looks like the wonder boy dragons trap thing that they did.

38:01.060 --> 38:05.940
Um, where you can, and that was really good and you can switch really easily

38:05.940 --> 38:10.220
with like a button in between the newer mode and the retro mode and so forth.

38:10.220 --> 38:12.220
And I thought it looked so cool.

38:12.260 --> 38:13.820
I'm, I'm very happy about this.

38:15.180 --> 38:16.500
Yeah, I thought it looked really good.

38:16.500 --> 38:19.660
I mean, we are definitely looking into, of course, picking it up.

38:19.660 --> 38:21.180
So we'll see what happens.

38:21.460 --> 38:22.100
Yeah, for sure.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.300
I was really excited about that.

38:23.900 --> 38:27.260
Um, let's see some other, uh, games that were announced as well.

38:27.540 --> 38:32.420
Um, they talked more about blood stained and what that has in

38:32.420 --> 38:34.420
store for it for the rest of 2020.

38:34.620 --> 38:36.540
They're continuing development on that game.

38:36.900 --> 38:40.780
Um, I think one other thing I want to mention, uh, for sure is the

38:40.780 --> 38:44.340
arcade one up machines, because I know some people are getting into

38:44.340 --> 38:48.300
collecting those and we know that they, you know, they're going to have a

38:48.340 --> 38:52.340
pinball, we knew that was coming, but they unveiled a Marvel pinball

38:52.340 --> 38:53.380
table that they're doing.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.100
They're also doing a Ms.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.460
Pac-Man cabinet, uh, and compilation.

38:57.740 --> 39:01.620
They're also doing an X-Men versus street fighter cabinet, uh, that will

39:01.620 --> 39:04.980
include Marvel versus street fighter and Marvel versus Capcom.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.980
That's going to be a highly desirable one, I'm sure.

39:07.300 --> 39:10.860
And they're doing a big buck Hunter cabinet for, you know, that crowd.

39:11.220 --> 39:13.220
Um, that's actually pretty, uh, pretty cool.

39:13.220 --> 39:17.740
Like the gun cabinets that, that opens the door for like, Hey, can

39:17.740 --> 39:21.900
we get like a time crisis or can we get a house with a dead cabinet?

39:21.900 --> 39:23.860
Point blank, point blank here.

39:24.020 --> 39:26.420
I'll take a time crisis slash point blank game.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.500
Um, and maybe those are a little bit more to emulate.

39:29.580 --> 39:31.940
Um, but like, I'm surprised.

39:31.980 --> 39:35.740
Well, I guess, you know, the stuff that they had in there, um, cause

39:35.900 --> 39:38.740
Marvel or just Capcom, that's not CPS too, I don't believe.

39:39.380 --> 39:41.180
Um, I don't know.

39:41.700 --> 39:44.540
I'm excited to see like the different things that they're going to

39:44.540 --> 39:45.980
have available for that stuff.

39:45.980 --> 39:50.660
So, um, I'm curious more of these like unique cabinets that come out.

39:51.660 --> 39:55.260
Um, I do want to quickly say this as well on the arcade one up front.

39:55.260 --> 39:59.020
So y'all know that, um, my birthday, well, maybe you don't know, but my,

39:59.020 --> 40:01.060
I'm to tell you, my birthday's coming up at the end of the month.

40:01.580 --> 40:03.260
This year's been a little crazy.

40:03.260 --> 40:06.820
So I said, you know what, I'm going to do something crazy for my birthday

40:06.820 --> 40:08.300
and buy myself something stupid.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.220
So guess what?

40:09.220 --> 40:12.100
Y'all I bought the burger time cabinet.

40:13.020 --> 40:18.380
So next time when we are able to get together in person, again, I will

40:18.380 --> 40:21.780
have a burger time one up cabinet in that arcade one up cabinet in the house.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.020
And I'm actually really psyched about it.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.420
So there is that.

40:25.020 --> 40:25.340
Yeah.

40:25.780 --> 40:26.060
Cool.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.820
Uh, it's a bad dudes, uh, cause it's like a data East karate champ.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.260
Uh, and I think there's one other one.

40:31.260 --> 40:33.620
So it's like a data East cabinet.

40:33.660 --> 40:33.980
Yeah.

40:34.020 --> 40:35.100
It's a bad dudes will be cool too.

40:35.540 --> 40:41.580
Um, so, uh, anything else, uh, other announcements, uh, Loki, uh, that we

40:41.580 --> 40:44.020
wanted to touch on from that list or should we move on?

40:45.380 --> 40:48.420
Uh, I think we can probably move on.

40:48.740 --> 40:49.020
All right.

40:49.020 --> 40:51.380
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

40:51.380 --> 40:54.020
that we have been playing that we've been playing.

40:54.020 --> 40:56.780
This week, uh, amongst all these announcements, dark soccer.

40:56.780 --> 40:57.380
How was your gaming week?

40:58.820 --> 40:59.460
Animal crossing.

41:01.180 --> 41:03.500
What are your goals or like pattern?

41:04.780 --> 41:06.860
Um, sorry, I didn't mean to cut off, but I'm just curious.

41:06.860 --> 41:10.500
Like what, what do you, cause like I I've mentioned on the show before,

41:10.500 --> 41:13.540
I'm getting to that point where I'm like, I feel like I'm running out

41:13.540 --> 41:14.860
of things to do an animal crossing.

41:14.900 --> 41:18.740
What, what do you kind of like, what is, what is your goals in animal crossing?

41:18.740 --> 41:20.740
I guess, how do you keep yourself motivated in that game?

41:21.460 --> 41:22.340
I don't have it.

41:23.220 --> 41:24.660
I don't have any goals.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.580
I just play and wander around because it's relaxing.

41:28.900 --> 41:29.820
It was kind of a Zen thing.

41:29.900 --> 41:30.180
Okay.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.980
You don't, you don't have to have a goal for something to be fun.

41:33.420 --> 41:34.540
No, I guess that's true.

41:34.540 --> 41:35.060
I guess that's true.

41:35.060 --> 41:38.780
I guess it's more like, you know, what, what motivates you to turn on the power

41:38.780 --> 41:43.380
every day, but relaxing, escaping, I'm sure you do a lot of hanging with friends

41:43.380 --> 41:48.500
and stuff, I mean, sometimes I just really prefer doing the run around and, you

41:48.500 --> 41:50.820
know, being kind of by myself for a bit.

41:51.220 --> 41:51.540
Yeah.

41:52.660 --> 41:53.220
Yeah, that's nice.

41:53.620 --> 41:53.900
Okay.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.860
Uh, and then I'm sorry, you said Puzzled or what was the other game?

41:57.900 --> 42:00.740
Oh no, um, uh, Patterned.

42:02.420 --> 42:06.380
A bunch of new puzzles for Patterned got released, um, the Apple Arcade.

42:06.740 --> 42:11.540
I mean, you can buy it, but I'm playing through Apple Arcade and I super like it.

42:11.540 --> 42:16.460
It's very relaxing, gets my mind off of stuff and usually helps me regain some of

42:16.460 --> 42:18.300
my focus when I'm having a really bad time.

42:20.300 --> 42:20.660
Nice.

42:21.540 --> 42:22.100
It's good.

42:22.300 --> 42:27.340
I'll, I'll, I'll try to put it on camera for a little bit while y'all are talking,

42:27.340 --> 42:28.740
but that's really all I've been playing.

42:29.420 --> 42:29.700
Okay.

42:30.340 --> 42:34.540
Um, then if that's it for Dark Sakura, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

42:35.460 --> 42:41.300
Uh, it was mainly Minecraft bedrock, um, still playing a lot on our

42:41.300 --> 42:42.940
realm and doing a lot of stuff there.

42:42.940 --> 42:48.060
So I ended up building an automatic slime farm, which involved me digging

42:48.060 --> 42:49.940
out an entire chunk of space.

42:49.980 --> 42:53.220
So that's 16 by 16 blocks.

42:53.260 --> 42:58.900
And then I say it dug down at least, gosh, like 80.

42:59.220 --> 43:01.300
So that took a very long time.

43:01.420 --> 43:04.660
Plus when you constantly have slime spawning on you, that was not fun.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.740
Uh, but I finished that today, so that was good.

43:06.820 --> 43:10.540
And then, uh, just more kind of playing around with that with kids.

43:10.860 --> 43:18.180
And then, uh, played a little bit of Orna this week and that's about it.

43:19.180 --> 43:23.620
I have also been playing a crap ton of Orna, um, which of course we've talked

43:23.620 --> 43:26.380
about the game many times on this show, but it's like the real world.

43:26.420 --> 43:31.940
Uh, but it's very, very inspired by an APID RPG, but I finally got the 2 million

43:31.940 --> 43:35.140
Orns it takes to up, uh, unlock one of the higher level classes.

43:35.540 --> 43:36.700
Oh my God, that took forever.

43:36.700 --> 43:39.700
And now I'm looking at like the next batch is like three and a half million.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.860
And I'm just like, oh no.

43:41.860 --> 43:42.700
Oh my God.

43:42.700 --> 43:46.500
But at least, oh my God, it has made my survivability so much better.

43:46.820 --> 43:48.540
Like I don't die in one hit anymore.

43:48.540 --> 43:50.140
It takes at least three hits to kill me now.

43:50.540 --> 43:51.060
So there's that.

43:51.300 --> 43:53.820
Um, and then I've been to continuing in Xenoblade.

43:53.900 --> 43:56.700
Uh, I'm probably about 10 hours in with Xenoblade, which means I've barely made

43:56.700 --> 43:58.180
any progression cause that game is forever.

43:58.180 --> 44:01.740
No, I'm, I'm in chapter five, uh, for anybody that knows that game and I'm,

44:01.740 --> 44:05.460
I'm enjoying it and that's kind of like my, uh, you know, kind of like finding

44:05.460 --> 44:09.020
your game to kind of like chill out to right now, like Xenoblade's been good

44:09.020 --> 44:13.540
for that because, um, there's so many, like if I don't want to do the main

44:13.580 --> 44:16.780
story, there's so many side quests and things to do.

44:16.780 --> 44:20.940
I feel like I could play that game for like three minutes and still feel like I

44:20.940 --> 44:24.500
did something because I did one of the side quests in the game, which a lot of

44:24.500 --> 44:26.580
RPGs can't really claim that.

44:26.820 --> 44:30.300
So that's one thing I'm finding that I really like about Xenoblade and why I

44:30.300 --> 44:33.180
think the switch is a great system for that to be on.

44:33.460 --> 44:36.860
Um, you know, despite all the weird releases that that game has had

44:36.860 --> 44:40.820
previously, and now I understand a little better as well why it came out on the

44:40.820 --> 44:45.700
3DS and I know I, I, I was more upset about the whole new 3DS result, 3DS

44:45.700 --> 44:49.660
thing, but I understand a lot more now why that game made a good 3DS candidate.

44:49.660 --> 44:53.580
So I will, I will concede that years later for what it's worth.

44:54.100 --> 44:58.700
Um, and then otherwise I still am playing animal crossing because Alan is still

44:58.700 --> 45:01.980
very like, you know, does a lot and I help him out and you know, like my

45:01.980 --> 45:03.820
turnip prices were lower than his this morning.

45:03.820 --> 45:07.260
So he came over, Oh, I, I, my, my price has spiked.

45:07.300 --> 45:09.460
I, I finally was the popular girl this week.

45:09.460 --> 45:16.100
Cause I had the four 70 turnip price and all I had to do was make a post on my

45:16.100 --> 45:16.740
Facebook.

45:17.020 --> 45:19.060
I didn't even get around to doing groups.

45:19.660 --> 45:23.780
I had friends that I didn't even know played animal crossing that were like,

45:23.780 --> 45:24.620
can I come sell?

45:24.780 --> 45:27.900
Can, can, um, my, my, I didn't even see your post.

45:27.900 --> 45:30.260
Dan told me, Oh yeah, cause Dan saw it.

45:30.300 --> 45:34.620
Dan was the, Dan was the first person to comment that you went into what, what the

45:34.620 --> 45:36.340
next day I could have sold for six 70.

45:36.420 --> 45:39.900
Oh, that's always, it's so hard to determine.

45:40.420 --> 45:41.900
It's like the stock market.

45:41.900 --> 45:42.500
When do I buy?

45:42.500 --> 45:43.060
When do I sell?

45:43.220 --> 45:43.620
Yeah.

45:43.620 --> 45:44.020
Right.

45:44.020 --> 45:50.260
So, um, but yeah, I had, I had a lot of people come through, uh, to buy for that.

45:50.260 --> 45:55.580
I just pretty much left my switch on and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't going

45:55.580 --> 45:57.140
to be flooded with people.

45:57.380 --> 46:00.140
And I think that's one reason I really try to make sure my friends would get

46:00.140 --> 46:03.860
through first because like I was able to, like it was at most, I think like three

46:03.860 --> 46:05.020
people were there at one point.

46:05.060 --> 46:07.420
And I think that was actually when you were there, Jamie, like I think my buddy

46:07.740 --> 46:10.540
Abra was there and one other might've showed up there when you were there.

46:10.540 --> 46:10.980
And that was it.

46:11.020 --> 46:12.900
Like, you know, that was, yeah.

46:13.460 --> 46:20.380
So one of the things like when I open up for anything like that is I just flat out

46:20.380 --> 46:25.180
say, um, you know, uh, cause you know, I've got my big group, all I do is say,

46:25.220 --> 46:28.500
um, Send me a message and I'll let you in.

46:28.500 --> 46:33.820
And I don't let more than four in at one time because I hate having it interrupted

46:33.820 --> 46:35.020
when I'm in the middle of something.

46:35.140 --> 46:35.460
Yeah.

46:35.860 --> 46:39.820
And I know there's websites that facilitate that as well, but for, and I

46:39.820 --> 46:42.460
could have used like Turnip Exchange or something, but I feel like there's

46:42.460 --> 46:47.860
something more personal about like, Hey, message me and you know, that's, I don't,

46:47.860 --> 46:49.780
I don't need a 99,000 bell tip.

46:49.820 --> 46:51.700
I mean, I won't say no, but I don't need it.

46:51.700 --> 46:54.020
I just, just have an excuse to say hi to me.

46:54.540 --> 46:55.220
You know what I mean?

46:56.300 --> 46:57.900
So, yeah.

46:58.460 --> 46:58.820
All right.

46:58.860 --> 47:02.300
Uh, as far as other games that I've been playing this week, um, you know, same,

47:02.300 --> 47:06.580
same old, same old on the PC, been playing Final Fantasy 14 still.

47:06.580 --> 47:09.820
And, uh, yeah, uh, just keeping myself entertained with that.

47:09.860 --> 47:13.540
So we will move on to some longer news here.

47:13.540 --> 47:16.380
So let's get to our first story tonight.

47:16.660 --> 47:17.180
Uh, outside.

47:17.180 --> 47:20.100
I mean, we've already talked a lot tonight, but our first maybe

47:20.100 --> 47:24.300
non press conference story, uh, has to do with leaks, right?

47:24.300 --> 47:24.660
Logie.

47:25.540 --> 47:25.860
Yeah.

47:25.860 --> 47:29.100
So, uh, I was actually going to mention too real quick since you brought up the

47:29.100 --> 47:35.020
switch, um, so our switch at home, the SD card slot is jacked up.

47:35.300 --> 47:38.380
Oh no, that's probably because it's because their design of how they

47:38.380 --> 47:40.500
designed the whole system is really stupid.

47:40.820 --> 47:44.580
They've got the board that has the micro SD card.

47:44.620 --> 47:48.620
It's just, there's like a little connector that just held in by

47:48.620 --> 47:51.260
pressure and doesn't snap in or anything.

47:51.260 --> 47:55.500
And so it, that originally was loose and it was causing it to not work all the time.

47:55.500 --> 47:56.660
Now it just doesn't work at all.

47:56.740 --> 48:00.940
So I ordered replacements, at least it's only 20 bucks to fix it, but it's still

48:00.940 --> 48:04.460
super annoying that I've had to repair so many things on this switch already.

48:04.900 --> 48:07.500
Anyway, so that aside, uh, let's talk about leaks.

48:07.860 --> 48:14.540
So, um, earlier this week, Star Wars squadrons had a wonderful little banner

48:14.540 --> 48:19.660
that appeared on the Xbox store and, um, basically leaked that, Hey, there's

48:19.660 --> 48:21.060
a new Star Wars game coming.

48:21.500 --> 48:26.580
And of course, because of that now, uh, EA has announced that yes, there will be

48:26.620 --> 48:31.540
a reveal trailer that's going to be coming at 8 PM Pacific time on June 15th.

48:31.980 --> 48:35.700
So you can check that out, but it does look like it's going to be kind of, um,

48:36.340 --> 48:39.060
uh, similar to the X-wing TIE fire series.

48:39.060 --> 48:42.940
So I don't know if it's mainly like kind of a flight SIM game, but, uh, it looks

48:42.940 --> 48:46.500
interesting, so I guess we'll check that out tomorrow when that comes out.

48:47.180 --> 48:53.140
Um, and then also with that as well, there's a, there was a listing for UFC

48:53.140 --> 48:56.700
four on the PlayStation four patch database.

48:57.100 --> 49:00.780
Um, so apparently EA is having all sorts of trouble keeping

49:00.780 --> 49:03.100
their secrets, uh, this week.

49:03.140 --> 49:06.940
But I guess we'll expect some announcements soon.

49:06.940 --> 49:09.980
They've got their EA play event, I think pretty soon.

49:10.340 --> 49:12.900
Uh, that's supposed to be at the end of this week on the 18th.

49:12.900 --> 49:15.220
So I guess we'll see all those announcements officially then.

49:17.220 --> 49:17.820
All right.

49:17.820 --> 49:18.100
Yeah.

49:18.100 --> 49:20.380
I know the EA, the EA thing is coming up.

49:20.420 --> 49:23.020
Uh, so yeah, more, more stuff in the next week.

49:23.180 --> 49:27.060
But leaks are an inevitable part, inevitable part of E3, aren't they?

49:27.860 --> 49:28.460
Yes.

49:29.060 --> 49:30.620
It's almost like we're in real E3 again.

49:31.580 --> 49:31.860
All right.

49:31.860 --> 49:33.860
Except it's, it's faux E3 anyway.

49:34.140 --> 49:38.180
Um, so, uh, before we move on to the next, uh, story, uh, Dark

49:38.180 --> 49:41.180
Sakura, I know you've got work things going on tomorrow and I'm sorry.

49:41.180 --> 49:42.700
You can't stay longer tonight.

49:43.020 --> 49:46.580
Um, but I know you wanted to say good night and, uh, all that good stuff.

49:46.780 --> 49:49.100
So thank you for being here as always.

49:49.140 --> 49:52.100
Um, any parting words for our audience tonight?

49:52.820 --> 49:56.020
Uh, just in a couple of weeks, I'm going to be back on a much

49:56.020 --> 49:57.580
easier to deal with schedule.

49:57.980 --> 50:02.860
Um, so this won't last too much longer that I have to pop out early.

50:02.860 --> 50:06.060
And this is, I just have things I need to take care of before work tomorrow.

50:06.060 --> 50:07.500
So sorry about it.

50:07.860 --> 50:08.260
All right.

50:08.260 --> 50:08.780
Sounds good.

50:08.780 --> 50:11.340
It's always, it's always good to have you here, even if just for a little bit,

50:11.340 --> 50:14.340
Dark Sakura, we look forward to, uh, uh, a couple of weeks and we

50:14.340 --> 50:15.540
can keep you here until midnight.

50:16.300 --> 50:20.780
Oh, trust me that that's coming, uh, right at the beginning of, uh, gosh, I

50:20.820 --> 50:22.820
think it's actually starting next month.

50:22.940 --> 50:24.980
I'll have to know it's starting August.

50:24.980 --> 50:28.820
I'm so stupid, but still, it is what it is.

50:28.820 --> 50:29.340
No worries.

50:29.420 --> 50:29.820
No worries.

50:30.060 --> 50:30.540
All right.

50:31.300 --> 50:33.700
Well, be sure to say hello to our chatters because there's a lot of

50:33.700 --> 50:35.060
kind words for you out there in chat.

50:35.060 --> 50:37.380
So, um, take care of my friend and have a great night.

50:38.100 --> 50:38.700
You too.

50:38.700 --> 50:39.980
Love y'all everybody.

50:39.980 --> 50:40.540
Bye.

50:41.260 --> 50:41.540
All right.

50:41.540 --> 50:41.940
Bye.

50:42.420 --> 50:42.780
All right.

50:43.100 --> 50:47.140
Um, so, uh, meanwhile, let me go to the next story here.

50:47.140 --> 50:52.660
And, uh, the video, the video may look a little funky for you guys.

50:52.660 --> 50:55.500
As soon as Dark Sakura disconnects, it's going to mess up my discord layout,

50:55.500 --> 50:58.540
but just bear with me, I'll fix it as soon as I can, but I want to get to the

50:58.540 --> 51:02.380
next story here that has to do with, unfortunately, some more Nintendo

51:02.380 --> 51:04.180
accounts have been breached.

51:04.340 --> 51:08.180
This is an addition to what we heard about before, but apparently another

51:08.380 --> 51:11.700
140,000 accounts were breached in April.

51:11.900 --> 51:15.660
Uh, Nintendo, of course, already earlier, uh, probably about a month ago, talked

51:15.660 --> 51:19.540
about that 160,000 accounts were breached in the hack and they've added

51:19.540 --> 51:21.540
another 140,000 to that total.

51:21.540 --> 51:24.020
So that's about 300,000 accounts.

51:24.420 --> 51:28.460
Um, although Nintendo is kind of trying to say now, well, that's only 1%

51:28.460 --> 51:30.620
of all the Nintendo network users.

51:31.020 --> 51:31.740
All right, whatever.

51:32.740 --> 51:38.020
The moral of the story is whether you're part of this 1% or not, make

51:38.020 --> 51:39.900
sure you change your Nintendo password.

51:39.900 --> 51:40.860
That's probably a good idea.

51:41.060 --> 51:44.500
Make sure your Nintendo password is not your bank password

51:44.540 --> 51:45.820
or your email password.

51:46.020 --> 51:50.260
Like you really should have a separate email for everything, but at least

51:50.260 --> 51:54.180
your bank and your email, because without those two things, you're

51:54.180 --> 51:54.820
going to be really unhappy.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.340
Like I can live without Nintendo for a little bit while I get it fixed.

51:57.460 --> 51:58.740
I can't live without the other two.

51:58.740 --> 52:01.740
So just make sure you're using unique passwords there.

52:02.140 --> 52:03.980
Um, so yeah, that's.

52:04.940 --> 52:08.020
I did, but they, I'm not hearing maybe, maybe there's more details.

52:08.020 --> 52:11.420
If I dig through this announcement, except it's in the Japanese, uh, sites,

52:11.420 --> 52:14.900
I don't know, like what all the specifics are, but I'm not sure like

52:14.900 --> 52:17.900
why they just suddenly found more.

52:17.900 --> 52:19.100
Did you hear anything on that?

52:19.260 --> 52:19.660
Loki?

52:20.700 --> 52:25.060
Um, no, I don't know why they found more.

52:25.060 --> 52:28.700
I know originally when they were talking about the original leaks, it was supposed

52:28.700 --> 52:30.700
to be like a smaller subset of the users.

52:31.540 --> 52:37.460
I don't know if it's because, you know, other sites were like compromised and

52:37.460 --> 52:41.300
maybe they found that, you know, the passwords from that other

52:41.300 --> 52:44.540
people use, I don't know how they may have figured it out, but.

52:44.940 --> 52:47.540
It's weird that we're finding out more of these coming out.

52:47.540 --> 52:53.100
So now, you know, 300,000 accounts total, and it's kind of ridiculous.

52:53.780 --> 52:57.580
So I guess we'll, I guess we'll find out, or maybe they just won't tell us

52:57.580 --> 53:02.060
how, how they figured that out, but I don't know, I don't like when it

53:02.060 --> 53:06.060
trickles out like that, because that was kind of like that whole, um, you

53:06.060 --> 53:10.820
know, Equifax stuff, it's like, oh yeah, it was only this many, or Facebook.

53:11.180 --> 53:14.220
It was only like, it was only like half a billion.

53:14.260 --> 53:14.660
Okay.

53:14.660 --> 53:17.380
No, 1 billion or the Yahoo email.

53:17.380 --> 53:20.420
Actually, it was everybody on the whole fucking site.

53:20.460 --> 53:22.660
It was the whole goddamn site.

53:23.060 --> 53:23.420
Anyway.

53:23.500 --> 53:27.100
Uh, very good point by SGA 100 Matt in our chat room over at Twitch TV slash

53:27.100 --> 53:31.700
VOG network as 200 Matt says, sign up for the two factor authentication word.

53:32.340 --> 53:36.340
Two factor authentication is great and pretty much any bank.

53:36.860 --> 53:40.620
I mean, maybe local banks don't use it, or I can't speak for every credit

53:40.620 --> 53:44.860
union in the world, but just about every big bank is, has a two factor

53:44.860 --> 53:46.500
auth available at this point.

53:46.700 --> 53:49.980
Uh, and certainly all of the major email providers, uh, have two

53:49.980 --> 53:52.780
factor auth and seriously use it.

53:53.060 --> 53:55.100
Um, you'll, you'll thank me later.

53:56.340 --> 53:58.340
Although I'm sure many people listening to this show are

53:58.340 --> 53:59.300
already doing that, right?

54:00.260 --> 54:00.980
I would hope so.

54:01.260 --> 54:01.660
All right.

54:01.980 --> 54:04.900
Um, now Jamie was going to talk about this, uh, for us, but we

54:04.900 --> 54:08.500
ran along a little bit here, so I don't know, uh, I've heard a little,

54:08.660 --> 54:10.100
I've heard a little bit about this Loki.

54:10.100 --> 54:12.780
I'll try to hit on the big points here and you can help me fill in the gaps.

54:13.020 --> 54:17.460
But, uh, Warner brothers interactive, who also is over rock steady,

54:17.460 --> 54:18.900
which is a Batman Arkham.

54:19.140 --> 54:21.740
And they're also over nether realm, which is mortal combat.

54:21.940 --> 54:23.260
Apparently they're up for sale.

54:23.380 --> 54:25.940
Um, I had no idea that they were something that was being put on the

54:25.940 --> 54:31.740
market, but apparently the parent company of Warner AT&T is talking about a big

54:31.740 --> 54:37.900
sale, uh, AT&T got Time Warner for 109 billion in 2018, this was a part of that.

54:38.140 --> 54:40.580
Obviously Time Warner is much more than a game developer, right?

54:40.620 --> 54:41.540
Uh, what, right?

54:41.540 --> 54:41.740
Yeah.

54:41.860 --> 54:44.540
How many movies have you seen with the Warner brothers logo in the beginning?

54:44.700 --> 54:46.500
Or they're a big cable provider as well.

54:46.500 --> 54:46.780
Right.

54:46.780 --> 54:48.140
So they're a big, big company.

54:48.140 --> 54:49.300
Games is one part of that.

54:49.780 --> 54:53.620
Um, but investors have been saying, Hey, Warner, you need to sell off some of

54:53.620 --> 54:57.780
your like non-core business, which for, I guess the games for whatever reason,

54:57.780 --> 55:01.580
fall into that anyway, some of the suitors that have expressed interest.

55:01.860 --> 55:06.060
The ones you would expect EA and blizzard, uh, Activision blizzard,

55:06.060 --> 55:10.140
excuse me, uh, have expressed interest as well as take two entertainment, uh,

55:10.180 --> 55:13.460
have all expressed interest in possibly buying the game division, but

55:13.500 --> 55:16.580
nothing has been finalized yet.

55:17.100 --> 55:24.740
So, um, apparently IPs that are movie IPs that tie into games.

55:24.980 --> 55:32.060
So like the Batman IP, the Harry Potter IP are not inherently a part of the deal,

55:32.220 --> 55:34.420
but they could still be part of licensing.

55:34.540 --> 55:38.380
And if I'm not mistaken, EA has made Harry Potter games in the past.

55:38.740 --> 55:39.220
They have.

55:39.220 --> 55:39.540
Yeah.

55:39.580 --> 55:39.900
Yeah.

55:39.900 --> 55:45.100
So they can license that or work that out, but just because they buy Warner

55:45.100 --> 55:48.260
doesn't mean they're going to automatically get Batman and Harry Potter

55:48.460 --> 55:51.500
and the things that tie into the Warner movie side of things.

55:51.660 --> 55:55.780
So, uh, these types of sales and business are complicated to say the least.

55:57.300 --> 55:57.580
Yeah.

55:57.580 --> 56:02.540
And I don't think it matters which studio purchases them because, um, I don't know

56:02.540 --> 56:07.980
all big AAA studios nowadays are kind of shitty anyway, so I guess it doesn't

56:07.980 --> 56:13.900
matter which, which one should we, you know, uh, which one should we pick?

56:13.940 --> 56:17.540
Uh, well, it would just be a matter of how much are they allowed to

56:17.540 --> 56:19.260
run independently as well, you know?

56:19.820 --> 56:20.180
Right.

56:20.180 --> 56:20.580
Yeah.

56:20.620 --> 56:28.220
I mean, I guess if I was going to pick one of the three or the least, uh,

56:28.620 --> 56:33.420
favorite of the three, I would say EA, um, only because of their track record of

56:33.420 --> 56:37.540
taking studios and then closing them down after they've milked them to death.

56:37.860 --> 56:41.780
So I would rather have, you know, Activision or take two in that sense.

56:42.020 --> 56:44.540
Um, but who knows?

56:44.740 --> 56:46.900
I'm laughing because I'm very happy that Mr.

56:46.900 --> 56:51.820
Smoosh has a friend in who loves to wine when the microphone's hot every single

56:51.820 --> 56:52.140
time.

56:52.140 --> 56:53.780
Like she's always screaming in here.

56:54.260 --> 56:54.700
Chat.

56:54.700 --> 56:55.580
That's not smush.

56:55.620 --> 56:56.540
That's not smush.

56:57.540 --> 56:58.700
No, that's Stella.

56:58.740 --> 57:02.420
You know, quite literally comes in the room and starts yelling all the time.

57:02.460 --> 57:04.060
Not because she doesn't have food.

57:04.180 --> 57:08.700
She literally has her, her kibble with a can of soft food on top of it.

57:08.700 --> 57:10.740
So I don't know what she's complaining about.

57:11.620 --> 57:12.660
And now she's going back to eat.

57:12.700 --> 57:15.500
She just like, lets us know that, Hey, I'm in the room.

57:15.700 --> 57:17.980
I'm, I'm unhappy for some reason.

57:18.020 --> 57:19.100
Smoosh heard his name.

57:19.100 --> 57:20.660
So Alan brought him in for cameo.

57:20.660 --> 57:20.980
There you go.

57:20.980 --> 57:23.700
That's why he didn't like getting picked up.

57:25.100 --> 57:25.580
All right.

57:25.580 --> 57:29.020
Uh, anyway, and the chat is lighting up smoosh, smoosh, smoosh.

57:29.220 --> 57:29.660
Okay.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.820
Uh, anyway, uh, let's move on.

57:31.860 --> 57:33.260
Uh, Loki, what do you have for us next?

57:34.140 --> 57:34.620
All right.

57:34.620 --> 57:39.980
So, uh, the Sims players are holding virtual black lives matter rallies.

57:40.380 --> 57:47.460
Um, so there's a modder and streamer at Daniel, uh, Ebonics Sims.

57:47.820 --> 57:49.300
I can't pronounce the last name.

57:49.340 --> 57:52.700
Uh, they started in, in game black lives matter rally.

57:52.860 --> 57:56.780
Uh, apparently last weekend and it's been still going strong for a while.

57:57.180 --> 57:58.340
Um, neat.

57:58.580 --> 58:01.420
I mean, I guess everybody's been doing different types of things.

58:01.420 --> 58:05.580
I remember we talked about NBA 2k last week with, um, giving out some of the

58:05.580 --> 58:07.100
different skins and stuff for that.

58:07.300 --> 58:09.220
There's people holding, holding protests and that.

58:09.220 --> 58:13.260
So it's kind of cool to see people expressing themselves in different games.

58:13.300 --> 58:13.740
Um,

58:15.660 --> 58:20.780
man, this is, this is also where like your, your, um, player base is coming up

58:21.660 --> 58:25.340
with this and it's not necessarily something like in the cases we were

58:25.340 --> 58:29.020
talking about last week, you had publishers and developers that were, you

58:29.020 --> 58:31.220
know, putting the message into the games, which is great.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.100
This is something that's very organic.

58:33.100 --> 58:34.580
That's grown out of the player base.

58:34.580 --> 58:38.620
And so we see this in the Sims and you know, although I don't have an example

58:38.620 --> 58:42.260
in front of me, I would be hard pressed to believe, uh, believe that this isn't

58:42.260 --> 58:46.500
happening in games like world of Warcraft, final fantasy, actually, I feel like

58:46.500 --> 58:52.740
there was a parade in final fantasy, um, at some point recently, um, yeah,

58:52.860 --> 58:56.460
where I'm just trying to, I don't want to misappropriate it to this

58:56.460 --> 58:58.340
particular movement when it's not.

58:58.740 --> 59:03.260
Um, but we have seen that these, these games are capable of

59:03.260 --> 59:04.580
that from their communities.

59:04.580 --> 59:09.220
And so seeing that grow into, cause you know, uh, there's a lot of people

59:09.220 --> 59:14.100
that don't, that they, they want to protest, but for whatever reason,

59:14.140 --> 59:16.780
they're not able to physically be out there protesting.

59:16.780 --> 59:18.780
And that could be because of physical needs.

59:18.980 --> 59:24.500
That could be because of COBA, COBA, COVID and, uh, uh, immunocompetent.

59:25.140 --> 59:26.220
Why can't I speak tonight?

59:26.220 --> 59:26.820
I'm so sorry.

59:27.100 --> 59:30.140
Uh, COVID and immunocompromised individuals and so forth.

59:30.300 --> 59:37.620
So I feel like the digital, um, protests are a great way for people to kind

59:37.620 --> 59:42.540
of participate without when they're not able to participate out there in

59:42.540 --> 59:43.700
the real world, if that makes sense.

59:44.500 --> 59:44.980
Yeah.

59:45.100 --> 59:45.380
Yeah.

59:45.420 --> 59:48.460
Everybody kind of has their own different ways of, you know,

59:48.460 --> 59:49.980
the activism and so forth.

59:49.980 --> 59:54.380
And, and certainly, you know, a, a, a movement like this, a protest in the

59:54.380 --> 59:56.740
Sims, it gets people's attention.

59:57.180 --> 59:59.740
Um, and lately here we are talking about it here.

59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.100
It is a story running across all the gaming blogs this week.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.260
You know, we talk about things that are on Twitter and on game blogs and so forth.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.220
So it is succeeding in that element.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.980
Um, so I think it's pretty cool to watch that stuff.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.020
So, yeah.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:13.460
All right.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:17.580
Um, SSG100Matt says, I remember seeing stories of funerals for

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.460
players on wow and final fantasy.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:19.980
Yeah.

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.940
And that's, you know, again, the community coming together for, you know, in this

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.100
case, the, the players that have deceased, but I'm sure there's a lot of, you know,

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:31.020
we, and we talked about this last week as well, too, people doing activism in

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:35.780
animal crossing, changing town flags, uh, doing screenshots of their own

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.420
types of activism and so forth.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.980
You know, everybody's got their different way.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.700
Um, so it's, it's interesting to see how video games, you know, again, if you want

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.940
to say video games are art, it's interesting to see how this art, this

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:50.100
movement is creating these new types of artistic expression.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.700
Uh, and it's pretty cool.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.660
So, all right.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.940
And we will mention it later in the show as well, but, um, you know, we're still

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.900
kind of, cause this, this whole movement is far from over.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.340
So please, uh, continue to pay attention to the bottom ticker bar.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.260
We do have some resources there for you guys.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.700
Uh, if you are interested in learning more about it, or you're interested in

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:13.460
making a donation, um, to the black lives matter movement, uh, there is some

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.460
information that scrolls on the bottom of the screen.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:19.260
Also, we'll mention it again later in the show, but there's like 48 hours left or

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.220
something like that in that itch IO bundle.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.420
So if you're like, what is like one easy thing I as a gamer can do right now?

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.980
Well, here's, here's a good start.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.220
So there's the, I mean, don't, don't let that be your only thing, but here's a

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:34.100
good start is that itch IO bundle is still available, uh, for like 48 more

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:34.540
hours.

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.180
And probably I'm giving it too much time with that.

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.780
Uh, and that's a great thing.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:43.860
And if you can spare it, don't just give $5 for like 1500 games.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:48.060
See if you can at least double it, you know, 10 bucks, maybe you can do 20, 25.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:48.780
Or do it.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.540
I mean, it's great.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.340
And if you've already purchased it, then you, um, you get those as well.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:58.620
So, but like, Gosh, I can't imagine like all the things to play in that it's just

01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.100
amazing.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.700
Uh, hype mayhem in chat asks a good question that is worth bringing up.

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.140
And that is a, okay, stupid question time.

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.860
Isn't the whole point of a protest to make your stance known to politicians and

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.980
or police and in real life protest does that since it's visible, won't the in

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.900
game protests not be visible to politicians and cops?

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.140
It's not always just about that crowd of the politicians and the decision makers.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.620
I mean, certainly that's an important part of it, but I think a big part of

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:30.340
that is also each other and that visibility with each other.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.980
We talked a little bit about this last week.

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:38.660
Um, and that is that I think part of the importance of being an ally is being able

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:44.740
to talk to other people in positions of privilege about what is going on and why

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:51.460
they should care because black people generally are tired of having to do so.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:56.660
So that's why allies need to step up and have those difficult conversations because

01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:01.180
we are, uh, in a position with privilege to be able to do that.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:08.300
So that being said, it's not just about police and politicians, it's about

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.540
spreading the message with each other.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:15.100
And I think the protest that we see in these games are getting the attention.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.580
I mean, we just mentioned it's all over video game blogs and all of this.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:23.660
Now it is getting attention of a crowd that may otherwise not be paying enough

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:30.660
attention to what is going on or have the privilege to be able to, uh, I'm just,

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.220
I'm not paying attention to this.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.900
This is just, this is too much.

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.180
I don't, I don't, I don't care about what's going on.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.460
Well, the reason why, and you may not like that word privilege, but the reason why

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:46.020
we use that word is because you have the privilege to be able to do that.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.620
You have the privilege to be able to turn it off.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.860
Not everybody gets to turn it off.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.020
And that's the point.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.780
So something to think about.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.740
So anyway, um, but I think, I think that was a very fair question.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.340
And, uh, you know, there you go.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:58.980
That's the answer.

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:01.380
It's about bringing visible, at least from my perspective, I'm sure other

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:05.300
folks will have answers as well, but it's about bringing visibility to each other

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:10.300
and not just those in a position of power, but real quickly, and I know when we get

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:14.020
to the next story, but, um, we are also in a day and age where more and more

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:19.900
politicians are gamers too, like we all know AOCs playing animal crossing

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.260
and stuff like that, right?

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:25.820
I'm sure she's not the only politician who happens to be a gamer and read game.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:31.580
I know she's, we had that one politician who was, uh, fraudulently spending money

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:37.900
on steam, so you have all sorts of gamers out there in politics, but my point is,

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:41.620
is that, you know, as we spread the message to each other, it gets to the

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:45.380
decision makers, it gets to the politicians, because again, part of that

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:50.340
continued activism is saying something both at the ballot box and to your

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.140
representatives.

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.540
So there you go.

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:56.420
Um, and there's some, um, there's some good comments in chat that kind of follow

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:57.100
that as well.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.220
Fifth dream today says it got publicity.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.420
It's noticed by people who say the stuff on the web.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.780
It could change minds.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.380
Uh, quest buster says they keep the protest visible and continue to raise

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.580
awareness, which is still an important part of the message.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.380
A few streamers even did black lives matter, charity streams.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:11.580
Yeah.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.220
So, and they, thank you for the kind words about me summing it up there.

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:19.860
I'm always like, God, I don't want to get this wrong, but I try to speak from here

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:22.620
where I can and, and usually that leads me to the right answer.

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:23.420
All right.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:24.820
Let's move on.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:29.940
We got more stories for you, uh, including, uh, news about a Skyrim mod.

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:33.100
That's going way beyond just being a mod anymore.

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:38.220
Um, so for Skyrim, uh, there is a mod out there called the forgotten city,

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.140
I believe is the name of it.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.700
Uh, and it is a, a Skyrim mod that has, you know, gotten a lot of

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.540
achievements and praise and so forth.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.260
Um, apparently it even won a writer's guild of America award.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:48.900
I had no idea.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.620
Pretty cool.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.740
How did that happen?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.740
I that's cool though.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:56.340
Um, it is now being its own game, so it's no longer going to be like dependent on

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.980
Skyrim and it's going to launch this winter.

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.220
Um, so the forgotten city has gotten a lot of props and the Elder Scrolls

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:05.100
community for having its own rich story experience.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.340
Um, The developer is modern storyteller.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:13.060
The publisher is dear villagers, and they're talking about a mature

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.820
narrative driven game with this.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.380
And the trailer actually debuted as part of the PC gaming show.

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.580
So I know we didn't discuss it earlier, but I think it's important to point out,

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:29.940
Hey, this was born as a, uh, mod for Skyrim, just like 50 shades of gray

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.700
was born from Twilight fanfic.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.700
It's just like that, right?

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:33.060
Loki.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:40.540
Um, let's just compare it to maybe like, um, you know, say Dota two or something

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:45.580
else, you know, I like that Loki's like, maybe that's not the comparison

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.060
we want to use right now.

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:47.500
Okay.

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:48.140
All right.

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:48.740
I'll give you that.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:54.780
This is going to be good versus, you know, 50 shades of gray, which was terrible.

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:55.100
Okay.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:55.380
Okay.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:55.620
Okay.

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.780
Team fortress two was born of a quake mod.

01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.060
All right.

01:06:59.060 --> 01:06:59.660
How about that?

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.300
Much better.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:00.980
Yeah, much better.

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:01.300
All right.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:03.580
Okay.

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:09.700
Uh, but anyway, uh, it's, so here we have another example of a modded

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.220
game turning into its own game and, uh, yeah, it's going to be out this winter.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.260
And I think that's pretty cool.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.700
So, yeah, I'm very excited to check it out.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:20.420
Me too.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.940
Um, and hopefully no one takes an arrow to the knee in that game.

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.660
Cause that line's played out.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.020
Yes.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:26.780
Yes.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.180
All right, let's move on.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:32.380
Uh, so, uh, dark soccer was going to talk about this next story and I think I'm

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.500
going to save it for, cause that's not something that is necessarily time

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:39.260
sensitive, even though the story came out this week, uh, and she asked us to go

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.860
ahead and skip the classic game of the week this week, I don't know.

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.620
Are we, are we able to just like find something on the fly?

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.340
Low key.

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.780
Uh, unfortunately the news this week was so top heavy.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.820
We weren't able to get to where dark soccer, uh, could do

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.020
her classic game of the week.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.780
Um, so now we're in this odd predicament where we don't have a game of the week.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.900
But then I feel like, how can we go a week on the show and

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.740
not do a classic game segment?

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.660
So we need to kind of pick something live.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.060
I think that we haven't done before.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:07.020
Can we do that?

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:10.100
Um, I mean, anything is possible.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:14.260
Like I know at one time when we were doing classic game, uh, or I was

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.500
picking one, there was a lot of backup, like, Oh yeah, that'd be great.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.420
Let's, let's save that for another day.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.460
You know, type of things.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.140
Uh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.900
You, you have mega Zeus in the background all night.

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.940
Well, now you have Pokemon.

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.260
Have we done mega Zeus?

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:28.860
Damn it.

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:29.700
We've done mega Zeus.

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:30.540
I thought we did.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:30.940
Yeah.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.380
It's, it's pretty close.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:40.060
I mean, um, let me think, um, thinking on the fly here.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:44.980
Uh, what about, and the other thing is I'm, we've had so many games.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.460
I don't want to duplicate something.

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:48.180
You know what I mean?

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.980
Like we've picked so many games in the past.

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.460
I worry if I'm going to pick something, I'm going to duplicate it.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.780
So I'm trying to think I'm using my brain and I'm trying to go way into

01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:00.580
the archives of my brain, uh, and come up with a game, like maybe something

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:04.340
I've been playing on, um, ant stream or something.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:11.860
Um, I have one and I know I do have one if you want to do it.

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:13.260
Okay.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:17.060
Otherwise I actually see a suggestion in chat I could go with, to be honest.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:20.220
Cause I don't think we've ever talked about this game and it is something

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.420
I could talk about memories for.

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.460
Okay.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.180
Um, we can do that.

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.660
Um, I was going to pick Derby owners club.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.900
Oh, Jamie will be so mad if we do that without her.

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:33.460
Yeah.

01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:35.060
Yeah, that's a good pick.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:35.300
All right.

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.700
I'm going to do the one that's chat picked.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.020
Okay.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:37.980
Okay.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.340
So let me, wait, let me hurry up.

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.300
I'm going to bring up Safari here and find a YouTube clip of it real quick,

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.020
because this is a game I totally remember.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.500
And somebody in the chat just picked this.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.100
You said it in chat and I was like, oh hell yeah, that game.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:49.620
Okay.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:50.060
Hold on.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.100
I'm trying to get to the YouTube.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:55.780
Um, okay.

01:09:55.780 --> 01:10:00.700
So this game I'm picking because I have memories of this game and I

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:04.420
have memories of this game and it was kind of like, um, it was kind of scary.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.980
And, uh, I'm not sure all my memories of this game were necessarily good because

01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:11.220
I remember being scared as hell by this game, because it was almost like a boo.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.820
Uh, gotcha type of thing.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:18.340
Uh, but the classic game I'm going to pick is Jurassic park on the super Nintendo.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.300
So, oops.

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.100
And I hit the wrong button and now we don't have Safari.

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.940
Uh, gotta love doing it live here.

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.340
Okay.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.980
Let me try this one more time.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:34.780
So Jurassic park on the super Nintendo was a, there we go, was a game that was

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:40.180
made by, um, ocean, uh, and it was a tie-in to the, uh, of course the movie of the

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:44.780
same name and it was, it was interesting because it was like, you have this

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:49.460
overworld, like 2.5 D and for those watching on Twitch, you had this overworld

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:53.740
2.5 D mode, uh, where you're walking around and, uh, you know, trying to

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.220
make your way through the park.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.900
Cause you're trying to escape and so forth.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:01.540
Um, and then you had these segments of the game where you would actually go into

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:08.940
pens and it was actually like a first person game, which for the super Nintendo

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:12.180
at the time was very, very like rare.

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.300
You didn't see a lot of, cause you know, the super Nintendo was

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.060
all like Sprite driven graphics.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:22.300
So this was kind of a hard thing to kind of drive on, um, a console, but first

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:28.660
person games, like this game came out in an era when like doom and Wolfenstein

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.540
and all that shit was the rage.

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:35.540
So, uh, I think this was kind of like to respond to that in some ways.

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:38.860
It's like, Hey, we can do a first person shooter as well, except it was with a

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:42.980
game like Jurassic park, which is almost kind of crazy in a weird, in a weird way.

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:48.220
Um, so anyway, this game came out in, uh, it was actually out in the UK first

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.740
and probably because it was developed, um, over there, uh, by ocean software.

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.700
Uh, and it was released on in October of 93.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:59.020
Uh, but it came out here in North America just like weeks after that.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.820
And then it actually came out in Japan, uh, in June the next year.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.780
So it did see a worldwide release there.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.380
Um, and you are playing as Dr.

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:11.660
Grant and you are, of course, the park is overrun by dinosaurs.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:15.900
You have various weapons that you use to help combat the different dinosaurs.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.620
Um, and then there's also ways that other characters in the

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.820
game can communicate with you.

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:23.020
Like you probably saw those little like polls and signs that people

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.420
were, uh, talking through and so forth.

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:31.580
Um, and then, yeah, the other like not so great things about this game, there

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.460
was no password feature in this game.

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:39.580
So if you couldn't beat this game in one sitting, then you were screwed.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:43.220
Uh, it was, it was like Rygar on the NES in that fashion.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:46.060
So yeah, there was no saves or any of that.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:52.380
Um, and, um, yeah, you can, I'm sure if you really wanted to see somebody beat

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:55.740
this game, start to finish, there's playthroughs available now, I really want

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.620
somebody to get to the first person part of this, I was hoping they'd get to it.

01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.020
Let me see.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.660
I'm going to, uh, for those that are watching on Twitch, I'm going to do a

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.140
little hunt and pecking in this video here.

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:03.540
Oh, there we go.

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:03.860
There we go.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:04.780
Cause I can see a little preview.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:05.780
There we go.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:10.740
Here's some of the scary first person stuff where now he's actually in one of

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:15.500
the, and you see, it's very inspired by like Wolfenstein 3D and then one of

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:20.180
those dinos comes out rawr is going to get you and you got to love how it's

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:26.380
like paired so that the story behind it is it's night vision goggles, but what

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:32.220
they're doing is that notice how it's a very small area of the screen relatively

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:36.620
compared to the other game footage we saw earlier, and that allows it to run

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:40.820
at an acceptable frame rate on the Super Nintendo, which still isn't great.

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:46.860
If you'll remember back to like the good old days of Wolfenstein 3D, that was one

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.820
of the options that they had screen size and like you could shrink that thing down

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.620
to like the size of a penny and, uh, it would run really fast because it's

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.620
rendering less area.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.060
But yep, that's why.

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:57.340
Yeah.

01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:57.900
Oh, boom.

01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.060
Dinosaur came out of nowhere there.

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:04.540
So, yeah, no, it's very, that it's very like doom size down to like half the

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.300
screen so you can play it on an older machine.

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.900
That's what Jurassic Park looked like on the Super Nintendo.

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:13.220
Um, but, uh, it was cool because there was nothing like it on the Super Nintendo.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:17.660
Like the only other thing I can think of was like Faceball 2000.

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.980
You remember when that game was getting a lot of hype and it's like, that game

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.140
was, that game was kind of fucking garbage.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:28.980
Like the only reason people were into it was because it was first person.

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:33.620
And that was a new novel thing that was like just coming out in, in the nineties,

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.100
like around 94 when this game came out was right around when doom was

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.260
coming out and all of that.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.260
So, Ooh, and there's, here's the sequence where you really do have night vision

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:42.780
goggles and everything is tinted green.

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:43.700
It's kind of a cool effect.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:49.060
Uh, now one thing I think is, is notable about this as well is that, uh, it used

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.940
like, uh, like it was like a surround sound type of game.

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:56.420
Uh, and I remember that logo being on the screen when you would launch the game.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:00.460
And it was because of these sequences, you could hear the dinosaurs moving on the

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:04.140
left channel or the right channel, which might not sound like a big deal in this

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:09.140
day and age, cause you know, now that's, but like again, in 94, like full stereo

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.700
in your games was a new thing.

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:16.300
And especially in these more intense sequences, if you will, um, where you are,

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:22.900
um, uh, in the first person mode, very different, by the way, I want to point

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:25.860
out the super Nintendo version of this game, very different than the Genesis

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:26.260
version.

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:30.900
They, they have hardly anything different developers, different ideas.

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.460
So I think it's a variable because like, you might be thinking, I played Jurassic

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:36.900
Park and it is nothing like what Rob is talking about.

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:40.420
That's because the super Nintendo and the Genesis games were very different.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:45.140
I think the Genesis one was generally better received, but the super Nintendo,

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.100
I don't think it was really received well by critics because of some of these

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:51.940
drawbacks I've talked about already, but I also feel like it's one of those things.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:52.820
Oh, it's going to play an ad.

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:53.860
So I'm just going to go back to that.

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:58.180
I was going to say, and I don't know if you noticed, but like it mentioned that

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:00.460
you can click the left or right mouse button.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:03.860
That's because it supported the mouse that came with Mario Paint.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.620
It did, it did support that.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.620
And I was trying to, there was something about the super FX chip as well.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:13.140
Um, Oh no, it, they were replicating the effects of the chip in the super

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:14.060
Nintendo hardware.

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:16.380
Uh, that's what they were saying about developing the game.

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:21.100
So it's this game, even though I don't think it was critically like well

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:24.580
received, I still feel like, like you look at chat, like, you know, since I

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.500
brought up this game, there's a lot of people in chat that are like, heck yeah,

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.340
this game, I remember this game.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:30.940
Oh yeah.

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:31.420
And this stuff.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.220
So I feel like maybe like a cult type of video game, like the people that played

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:40.460
it, remember it because it was so like, I mean, it tied into like, what was the

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.460
biggest movie of the decade, probably well, because Titanic was 99.

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:48.780
So maybe that, but, um, but still like it tied in not just to that nostalgia,

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.180
but like all these different type of things you weren't really seeing in other.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:57.740
So I think for those reasons, it's notable as a classic game, especially

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.380
for something that we are completely pulling out of our ass tonight.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.460
Um, well, thanks to the help of chat because as that, as that was the one

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:07.460
that Chad, that I was like, Oh yeah, I, I, uh, I forgot about that one.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.460
So, um, yeah, that's a good pick.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:10.980
Here it is.

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.020
Your classic game of the week.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.260
Presto.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:19.900
Uh, uh, Rob's choice with the help of chat, Jurassic park, uh, on the super Nintendo.

01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:23.980
So we'll, we'll get the actual, uh, game that dark soccer had intended to do tonight.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.180
We'll do that next week.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:26.060
We'll roll that over.

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:30.100
Uh, fifth dream today in chat says pulled out of your Jurassic.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:31.060
Yes, I like that.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:31.940
Good, good, good.

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:32.820
All right.

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:36.340
Let's move on and do some rapid fire news.

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.140
Uh, Loki.

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:38.860
All right.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:44.140
So let's talk a little bit about what's coming to game pass in the month of June.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:49.180
So, uh, the first notable thing is that you're getting a lot of kingdom hearts.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.900
Uh, so yes, get your, uh, kingdom hearts ready.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.500
So you've got birth by sleep.

01:17:55.180 --> 01:18:12.900
Um, kingdom hearts, one final mix re chain of memories, uh, 358 slash two days, uh, kingdom hearts to final mix birth by sleep, final mix recoded, uh, dream drop distance, HD birth by sleep and a fragmentary passage.

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.820
And then of course, uh, kingdom hearts X back cover.

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:30.740
And then along with kingdom hearts, uh, you're going to be getting, uh, Bard's tail remastered and Reese snarled on console and PC, uh, battle fleet Gothic armada two on PC.

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:33.020
Battle tech on PC.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.980
Uh, it looks like dungeon of the endless on console and PC.

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:40.620
And then let's see, no man's sky on console and PC.

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.300
And finally, uh, throne breaker on console.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.940
So those are all going to be out by the end of this week.

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:47.700
Real quick.

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:56.540
I knew I forgot something during my gaming week and I want to enhance on this a little bit because I had cut the story because I intended to talk about it during my gaming week and then forgot.

01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:02.220
So, uh, one of the games, thanks to game pass, I played this week was I played no man's sky on Xbox.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:08.660
And so did I end up playing no man's sky on the, on a third system for the third time?

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.900
Yes, I did.

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.500
So I've now, I bought the PlayStation four version.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:17.100
I bought the PC version so I could play with Alan because cross play didn't exist back then.

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.820
But then the new, the big news this week, we have cross play now.

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.100
So I didn't have to do that.

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:26.260
And now I played the Xbox version just because I have game pass.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.340
Why the fuck not?

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:28.820
Let's complete the trifecta.

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:36.740
So I did play on Xbox and I will say it was probably the worst of the three because, well, here's why, here's why.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:40.060
I have a regular Xbox one.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.180
Uh, I have a PlayStation four pro.

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:51.380
So to be fair, I imagine what I'm playing is the same thing that a regular PlayStation four user gets.

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:59.340
But with the little extra oomph in the pro, I'm seeing something a little better than the, and then of course my PC is in pretty good shape.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.940
So what I see there is really good.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.500
Like that's probably the best of all of them.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.180
Um, so that's the only reason.

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:09.500
So if you have an Xbox one X, uh, you will probably have a completely different experience.

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.340
It wasn't bad.

01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:18.860
Like again, if you don't have no man's sky on any of the other systems and you have game pass, should you skip it on Xbox?

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:21.420
Because I'm sitting here saying, no, get it.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:22.700
It's still worth your time.

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.220
And it's a, it's a good game.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:32.420
It's just, I definitely noticed like, Oh, the draw distance and some of the pop-ins not quite as fluid as the other systems I played this on.

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.180
But again, that is just because of my home setup.

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:43.620
If your home setup includes an Xbox one X or a regular PlayStation four or something, you are not going to have these same issues that I had.

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:46.380
So I say it's very well worth your time.

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.580
If you have game pass, you've never checked it out before.

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.940
So anyway, just, just wanted to throw that out there.

01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:59.100
And then, um, in other news, we've got a new RPG maker coming.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:07.140
So RPG maker MZ, uh, not much known about this yet, although there is a steam page for it.

01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:14.300
And it's basically saying that, uh, it looks like there's the requirements for are a little bit more of substantial.

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:24.060
But other than that, don't really know, uh, what's exactly going to be involved with it, but, um, Oh, actually, no, there are some details on it.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.580
So it looks like they just mentioned like different, I don't know.

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:31.340
A lot of this stuff mentions that they mentioned here.

01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:33.140
It looks like kind of like all the other ones.

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:41.380
So they've got, you know, you can do a character generator, different events, map editor, uh, the usual trappings of a RPG maker.

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:51.900
I don't really, like I said, a lot of these, I couldn't, I couldn't tell you what the difference are between a lot of these different, um, uh, RPG maker programs.

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:56.580
But I'll be interesting to check it out and hopefully it comes out of sale and Humble Bundle or something like that.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.180
Cause that's where I tend to buy all those and then never use them.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:01.860
All right.

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:02.980
All right.

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.700
Let's talk a little bit about, um, arcade archives.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:16.420
You know, the arcade archives is a lot of the, uh, well, some people out there going the main games available on Nintendo switch, but hello, they're in Maine because these are arcade cabinets and things in the eighties and nineties.

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:23.500
So a lot of these old games have been re-released for the switch and PlayStation four, um, through this series known as arcade archives.

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.380
Well, arcade archives released their 100th game this past week.

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:29.660
And that was sunset riders.

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:31.380
Uh, that's a, that's a big game.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.940
People remember on the, uh, uh, on the arcades, uh, big Konami game.

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:39.620
It was one of those, uh, like, like Ninja turtles, basically the Cowboys.

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:40.140
Okay.

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.700
That's what sunset riders was interesting to know.

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.340
And maybe you guys, okay.

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:51.620
So you guys know, I will always sing a Swan song and pour one out for Microsoft game room.

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:55.140
Y'all remember, y'all remember my love for Microsoft game room on the X-Box three 60.

01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:00.380
All the old, do you know what the last game was they did in Microsoft game room sunset, right?

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.020
It was, there's a reason why I brought that up.

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.500
So sunset riders is a landmark game in a couple of places here.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:10.740
So, um, anyway, is the 100th arcade archives, uh, to be released.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:20.980
And, uh, there's some cool, uh, little art that hamster, the company that's put it all together is put out hamsters also pointing out, Hey, there's official Nintendo releases and arcade archives.

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:21.380
That's true.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:26.380
And still to this day, super Mario brothers versus is like one of the best selling Nintendo switch games.

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:29.740
You go to the top games that are released, that game is still there.

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:32.380
So that's, um, that's good.

01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:33.980
They've been having a lot of success with that.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:39.060
And I'm sure a lot of people will be, um, uh, looking for that, uh, sunset riders release as well.

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:41.780
I already mentioned this a little earlier in the show.

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:42.540
It's important.

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.660
I'm going to mention it again.

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:53.180
I do want to congratulate itch.io as their bundle for racial justice and equality has passed $6 million in donations.

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.180
That is incredible.

01:23:54.500 --> 01:24:00.140
The indie developer scene has rallied together in a historic fashion.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:03.300
Quite frankly, I don't know of any other bundle.

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:08.060
That's been this big or this monumentous.

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:09.900
I mean, think about $6 million.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:13.700
That's two times what summer games done quick did in their record.

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:22.980
And that's not, that is a hugely important thing that I would never speak ill of at all, but I'm trying to express the volume of what is happening here at itch.io.

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:30.700
And that is like, they have, they have doubled over what a summer games done quick would make with this bundle, 1500 items and counting in this bundle.

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:37.820
Um, one of the games they just added that I played last night for a little bit, uh, Loki, this would have to be a fave of yours too.

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.660
Cat lateral damage is in the bundle.

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:48.740
So if nothing goes, if, if the 1499 other games don't speak to you, let that one speak.

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.780
But trust me, there's plenty in here that will speak to you.

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.940
Let that one do the talking.

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.580
Cause I love cat.

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.700
Like I have that like three times over.

01:24:55.700 --> 01:25:01.820
So I, cause I have it on a PlayStation, which it supports VR by the way.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.740
And, um, I have it on steam as well.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.300
So cool.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:15.860
Anyway, it ends Tuesday, uh, all the money being raised going for the NAACP legal defense and educational fund and the community bail fund.

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:19.380
Um, so go head over to itch.io.

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.500
It's you can't miss it.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.260
It's right there, front and center on the page.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:30.140
They're only asking $5 for it, but I bet you could spare 10, 15, maybe 20, uh, maybe more, who knows how you're feeling.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:36.500
And, uh, you could check out all those games and support a great cause who knows, maybe we'll get it up to 7 million by Tuesday.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:36.940
Who knows?

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:37.820
Anything's possible.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:40.140
Um, six point eight already.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:46.100
Is it really, I was going to say last night, it was cause I admittedly, I was like, Oh yeah, I definitely need to get on that.

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:51.260
So, uh, and a tweet reminded me like, Oh yeah, that's not going to be around forever and you want to support those causes.

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:51.820
So get on it.

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:53.060
So I did that.

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.380
Um, and it was already at like 6.3 million.

01:25:55.380 --> 01:26:00.820
So, uh, I'm not surprised at all to hear, uh, it will probably hit seven by the time Tuesday comes around.

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.980
So don't forget y'all.

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:03.060
Okay.

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:05.460
Um, yeah.

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:13.460
Uh, quest buster in chat says the itch IO bundle also kept growing, which is amazing from 700 something games to more than a thousand.

01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:14.100
Yeah.

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:18.660
Like it's just like the, again, the indie developers have rallied together in a way.

01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:20.020
There's Celeste in there.

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.700
I mean, Celeste is an awesome game as well that you probably would know.

01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:33.020
And then, uh, one that I see a screenshot for here that I've been, I forgot all about, but I was following them when they were developing the game was sky road, which is kind of like

01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:35.740
an old school, uh, flight SIM action game.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:40.380
And I don't know, there's just so much good content in there that you should really pick it up.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:44.300
2064 read only memories got added recently into that bundle.

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.180
Um, there's, there's so much octodad.

01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:53.500
So if you're like, if you, if you want to see where, um, uh, bug snacks comes from, octodad is in there.

01:26:53.700 --> 01:27:02.780
Uh, there's there, unless you are absolutely broke and just, and on a budget and cannot afford anything extra about that, you, you really owe it to yourself.

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:10.700
To kick some money in and it support a good cause for one, but check out all of these amazing indie games, um, as a, as a two.

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:12.380
So, all right.

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:15.820
And yeah, questmaster also points out there are assets in there.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.300
There are tools, tile sets, PDF, RPG books from Indies.

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:23.620
There are loops, musical loops that got my attention as well.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.020
Hundreds of board games.

01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:29.580
So, and all for a great cause.

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.060
So fantastic.

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:31.780
All right.

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.180
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:38.420
Let's check out what's going to be coming to stores, uh, near you in the near future.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:46.780
So Loki, how about the U S so we've got a persona for golden that's coming out on PC.

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.700
Uh, actually, I'm sorry that came out yesterday.

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.980
I think they, I think that was a surprise.

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:52.580
It's today.

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:52.860
Yeah.

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:54.540
So, um, okay.

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:59.660
So this week we've got Desperados three that's on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:05.020
Uh, uh, disintegration on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:09.020
We've got burnout paradise remastered on Nintendo switch.

01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:15.180
And, uh, last but not least the last of us part two on PlayStation four.

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.060
Oh, we need to mention this at some point.

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.260
Um, because this is everywhere.

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:23.620
And for whatever reason, it didn't, like it didn't, it wasn't in a story

01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.140
that we slotted in our show tonight.

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:29.060
But Bobby talked about this on his show tonight and I was like, oh yeah, this is

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.180
the thing I've been reading around on Twitter.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:30.780
This is awesome.

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:34.100
Have you heard about the accessibility settings in the last of us too?

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:37.460
It's like, it's setting a new standard.

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:42.740
You, you can customize like everything in this game to meet your needs.

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.340
They actually, cause I saw, I don't know if Strelok still in chat, but I know he

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:49.980
was in there during Bobby black off and he was like a friend of mine actually

01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:54.500
consulted on like a being able for a blind person to be able to play through

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.740
this game actually consulted so that somebody who's blind can play through

01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.620
the last of us too.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:03.180
That is the level of accessibility settings, where you want subtitles to

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.220
be, how big they are, how little they are.

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:08.660
Apparently you can do things with the difficulty where it's like, if jump

01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:12.580
scares are going to be bad for you, you can like, and I'm like, Oh my God.

01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:19.580
I, I consider myself somebody who's very fortunate to not usually have a need

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:21.300
for accessibility settings in many games.

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:25.660
But like to take out jump scares kind of does like, I don't like a lot of

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.300
horror games because of jump scares.

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.340
If I can get rid of that, it does make a game more accessible for me.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.780
So like, I'm all about that.

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:41.140
So I just have to give a wink and a nod and a smile to how out

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:43.180
of their way it almost seems.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:46.300
But then now that you see it, it's like, gosh, I hope this becomes the norm.

01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:49.260
Uh, this company went with the accessibility features.

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:52.380
So a major, major props to the last of us part two for that.

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:53.940
So, all right.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:58.020
Anyway, um, moving on to Japan and some of the releases over there.

01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:00.980
We have a lot of releases this week on June 18th.

01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.300
And I think it's because we've had a couple of weeks with no releases.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:04.980
So we're finally getting caught up this week.

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:08.700
Um, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de Seven, uh, is coming out this

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.460
week from Koei Tecmo in Japan.

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:15.060
Uh, there's also Haruka Beyond the Stream of Time is also out as well.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:19.580
Uh, we also have a game called Variable Barricade is out as well.

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.820
Mud Runner, American Wilds.

01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:26.860
And, uh, this game, uh, we were talking about last week, the Namkot Collection,

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.940
which is Namco, but when they were publishing in Japan in the early

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:30.940
eighties, they were Namkot.

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.780
That is out in Japan this week.

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:36.540
That's the one with the DMAKE of Pac-Man Championship Edition, which will

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:38.260
come out in the States a little later.

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:38.940
I'm sorry.

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.980
I said those were all PlayStation 4 releases.

01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:42.340
Those are actually Switch titles.

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:42.820
Sorry.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.980
I got them switched up.

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:48.100
So those are all Switch titles, but I imagine, yeah, on PlayStation 4, we're

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.580
going to see a very similar story.

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:49.780
Yeah.

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.660
It's like all the same shit on PlayStation 4.

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.660
Um, however, uh, we also have, of course, the last of us part two also

01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:56.900
releasing in Japan this week.

01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:00.900
So there's that they have a special PlayStation 4 pro to go with that.

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:03.620
Cause we love our limited edition consoles there as well.

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:04.620
Uh, okay.

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:06.740
Namkot Collection is exclusive to Switch.

01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.380
It is not in the PlayStation 4 releases.

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.780
So I'm glad I made that clarification.

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:10.260
Sorry guys.

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:11.140
All right.

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.140
Let's move on to the UK.

01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:12.500
Loki.

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:14.020
All right.

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:19.420
So in the UK, we've got Desperados 3 coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox 1 and PC.

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:22.740
Uh, Disintegration is coming out on PC.

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:31.300
Uh, it looks like the, um, ease memory of Celceta on PlayStation 4 railway, uh,

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:39.620
railway empire on the Switch, Ion Fury on PlayStation 4 and the Switch, Minimoto

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:45.100
Racing X on PlayStation 4, Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Switch.

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:50.660
Uh, they're also getting the last of us a part two as well on PlayStation 4.

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:52.660
All right.

01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:56.700
And apparently, yeah, I just noticed that the Pokemon sword and shield expansion

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.020
passes come out this week as well.

01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:59.420
So, oh, yeah, that's right.

01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:00.540
That's a big deal too.

01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.820
And that would be Japan U S that's everywhere.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:03.500
Yes.

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:07.660
Um, I know our, our pal friend of orange, Andrea here, Shane, who we talk about one

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.580
of my buddies, I play Final Fantasy 14 with a lot.

01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.940
Um, I know he is getting geared up for that.

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:15.780
Uh, there's been a lot of events in the game with different shinies and I know on

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:18.460
his Twitter and he talks to me about this too, he's been collecting some of the

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:22.980
different, you know, Gigantamax and shinies and so forth, uh, in anticipation of the

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:25.380
DLC, which is apparently introducing some new Pokemon as well.

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:31.260
I think there's a Galarian Slowbro or the Evolve with Slowking.

01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:33.020
One of those is getting a new Galarian form.

01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:36.660
So there are some new Pokemon coming out, uh, as well in the DLC.

01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:37.540
So that's pretty exciting.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:38.780
All right.

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:43.100
This is the part of the show where we would open up the mailbag over at

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:46.300
participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:53.220
Although last I looked just before showtime, we didn't have any emails and

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:58.900
I'm checking now, uh, because sometimes we get them right at the top of the show.

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.020
No, none, none came in.

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.340
So everybody was feeling a little quiet this week.

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:02.900
That's okay.

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:08.220
Um, so participate at orange launch radio.com is the place to send your emails that

01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:09.940
we will consider reading in a future week.

01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:13.180
In the meantime, we have a few more news stories for you guys to talk about.

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:13.740
So Loki.

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:15.460
Yes.

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:21.260
So there is a game, um, that Ubisoft is developing called gods and monsters that

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:24.660
accidentally, uh, was uploaded to Stadia.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:29.820
And apparently of course, you know, it's not finished yet.

01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:34.900
So one of the things, um, once down and I guess, apparently you, you could play a

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:39.140
development build of the game and they had temporary character models and assets

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:45.100
that were from assassin's creed filling in as well, um, basically it says

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:50.420
regretfully on Thursday morning, we mistakenly made an E3 2019 demo version

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:54.260
of gods and monsters from Ubisoft available on Stadia store, and that was

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.820
not intended for the public to play.

01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:59.180
A few hundred gamers were able to play it for less than 30 minutes.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:03.500
We sincerely apologize to our partners at Ubisoft for this mistake.

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:08.740
And that was from, uh, Google, uh, that actually made that booboo there.

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:11.500
Um, interesting.

01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:17.100
Um, it's kind of funny that, uh, you know, some of that stuff happens, but they

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:22.260
said that apparently though they're looking at, uh, they're going to probably

01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:25.100
have, you know, announced some more details by the end of the summer.

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:30.660
So I guess we'll have to wait and see what is going on with that, but kind of

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:34.140
cool if you were one of the few hundred people that able to actually play that

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.900
for a short period of time, you know, what this whole thing kind of made me

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:41.900
think of though, especially with this being E3 week and all, you know, one of

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:47.140
the more memorable E3s, I think we all remember was that year when, um, now I

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.340
think, I think you, me and Jamie were all there in person that year.

01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:52.220
I think it was 2005 or 2006.

01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:53.740
No, maybe it was right after that.

01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:57.660
Might've been one of the airport years, because I just remember that on the

01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:02.500
Xbox 360, they did that whole E3 at home thing and you could download all these

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:05.380
demos on your 360 and they were 2006.

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.100
Was it 2006?

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:06.260
Okay.

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:06.780
It was that year.

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:13.300
So yeah, it was lost planet, MotoGP 6 and something else.

01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:13.820
I don't remember.

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.060
That was really cool.

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:18.180
And a lot of us thought that was a really neat way to kind of participate

01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.380
with the E3 experience.

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:22.940
Um, even if we couldn't actually be at E3 and so forth.

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:29.660
So my point is now that we live in this day and age of cloud streaming games and

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:34.380
being able to play games on the cloud and so forth, um, especially when it was noted

01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:37.340
that, Hey, this game was supposed to be for developers.

01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:38.220
It was like an internal thing.

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.940
It was supposed to be a preview, you know, that whole type of thing.

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:40.780
It's not done yet.

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.620
Like, why couldn't we roll demos out like this?

01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:46.940
Like, they're never going to do that again.

01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:47.660
Why?

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:52.220
And the reason for that is because they, what they'll do is they will show

01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:57.700
gameplay footage that they'll stream gameplay footage that they have control

01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:59.780
over because they can control the experience.

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:04.180
And then that way they can control weather so that you don't see bugs.

01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:07.940
So you don't see, you know, partially developed gameplay.

01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:12.620
Um, it, they have a way that they can control the narrative a lot easier than

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:15.660
if they were to develop demos to release on these platforms.

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:20.260
And unfortunately it, it takes more development time to put out these vertical

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:22.620
slice demos and stuff to show off.

01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:27.380
It would be cool to see that, but I don't think we're going to see AAA publishers

01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:29.740
doing this anytime soon at all.

01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:34.180
Um, it's just not the way that they do business anymore, especially now that we

01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:38.140
have these large scale, you know, streaming events, they can just stream

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:42.460
gameplay, get people hyped up about it and just go from there.

01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:46.660
They, they don't need to have a demo put out there where people can pick it apart

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:50.740
and complain about how it's terrible because it's, you know, work in progress

01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:51.540
and that type of stuff.

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:53.820
So, yeah, unfortunately we're never going to see that again.

01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.820
Your, your answer is logical.

01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:56.940
It makes complete sense.

01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:59.140
Loki that being said, I don't like it.

01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:01.060
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.980
That's just the way the industry is.

01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:03.900
I don't like it either.

01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.180
Yes.

01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:09.260
I would like, I don't want to, I don't want to, I want to go back to what it was.

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:10.500
No, you're right.

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:11.020
You're right.

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:17.660
That it's, it's development time and deadlines for a demo that, uh, sometimes

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:21.620
is poorly received and ends up affecting the game as a result.

01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:25.100
I get all that there, but there's that part of me and you know, people on Twitter

01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:29.180
and a lot of gamers like this, why can't they just do a time demo of the real

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.900
product or why can't they do level one?

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:35.140
They don't have to, they don't have to tailor it that much.

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:35.660
Loki.

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:41.420
You can get that now with a lot of these games that go the whole, um, early access

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:41.740
route.

01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:46.380
So, I mean, it's, there's, there's a lot of opportunity to play stuff early and

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:49.980
there's even, you know, for example, if these studios are willing to develop,

01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:53.220
you know, Substantial demos for their products.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:38:00.500
Um, one that I keep talking about, uh, was it that I have wishlets on steam.

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.100
And I was talking about it earlier this week.

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.940
I pointed out as well is a game called one dreamer.

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:07.300
They have one dream or prologue that you can go play for free.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:11.860
It's the opening act for the game and gives you a really good idea of what it's

01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:12.460
going to be like.

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.660
And I think it's a great game and definitely worth checking out.

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:19.860
Um, but that that's something that they've put together a demo for.

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.780
So I think it depends.

01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:25.180
Like if I, a lot of indie developers want to get their, you know, games out there

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:30.340
and get, you know, the, um, word of mouth traveling about it.

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:34.460
And so they're more willing to spend the time, I think, to put together a vertical

01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.620
slice of their game so that people can check it out.

01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:40.580
But there's a lot of ways nowadays to be able to check out games in progress.

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:46.620
Whereas back in 2006 and 2005, you may have just had like a lot of the game

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.220
demo discs and stuff like that.

01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:52.180
Um, you didn't really have games streaming or anything like that to be

01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:53.780
able to see in progress stuff.

01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:59.620
It was, you know, what showed up in a magazine or what you saw on IGN or

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:03.820
something like that during, uh, E3, or in this case, you were able to play a demo.

01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:07.620
I wish they would still do more of that, but it's just not going to happen because

01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:12.380
you know, they've had it bite them too many times where people even at E3 see

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:17.100
a demo of a game and they immediately judge a game by the demo, knowing that

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.100
it's not finished and they're like, well, it's terrible.

01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.380
I'm not going to buy this, you know?

01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:25.780
So, um, and then you also have the folks that like EA that want to sell you a demo

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:30.020
for, you know, 30 days in advance for monthly fees.

01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:36.220
So I think we can count on indie game devs to, um, you know, fulfill that need

01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.700
for us, but unfortunately we're not going to see that widespread.

01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:39.820
Okay.

01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:43.460
I will, and, and, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Rob has gone full of

01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:47.420
Rook assault fair, but I will concede that point because this, this seems to

01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:51.420
happen a lot in the industry where the AAA developers have gone and moved on.

01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:53.340
The indie developers are here to save the day.

01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:54.220
So you're right.

01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:58.060
If I want to play some more demos, I bet there is a crap ton of indie stuff out

01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:00.460
there that I need to be better about looking for and supporting.

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.900
So I think that's a good message to leave things on.

01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:05.660
I I'm just still shocked with this technology, Logie.

01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:06.460
All right.

01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:10.660
Uh, the fifth dream today in our chat says, remember the PlayStation VR demo disc.

01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:11.220
Yes.

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.180
I guess they've updated that several times too.

01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:13.380
Yeah.

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:14.460
It's digital now.

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.180
There's like three different versions of it, right?

01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:17.260
Yeah.

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.900
Well, it's digital now and they keep updating the titles in it.

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:22.620
Cause obviously, you know, some of the titles in there are pretty old.

01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:28.020
So, um, you know, they keep updating that and that's cool that they have VR

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:32.140
demos that I understand because, you know, you're getting into VR, you know, you may

01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:35.700
have like a brand new headset or something like that and you don't have anything to

01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:39.020
play, which was the case when I was playing the demo stuff.

01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:43.580
And it's so gave me a good idea of like what I wanted to purchase, but you know, I

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:47.260
think a lot of those titles they're already complete and now they're just putting out

01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:49.460
something because they knew they needed this demo disc.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:52.660
It's not necessarily to showcase an upcoming game.

01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:55.460
Um, VR is also a challenging.

01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:55.660
Yeah.

01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:01.140
I was gonna say VR is also a challenging thing where you can't just show VR on

01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:01.620
YouTube.

01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:06.460
You know, VR is something you kind of have to experience to see what's going to be

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:07.140
right for you.

01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:11.900
Like I, I could say, I could play B roll of Tetris effect and show you what a cool

01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:12.940
game Tetris effect is.

01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.300
I can't describe for you.

01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:22.580
I can't show you, I can't explain to you why Tetris effect is better in VR.

01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.660
You just have to try it.

01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:28.300
And like the PS, the demo disc is a way for you to try it.

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:31.220
I, and I say Tetris effect just because that's a favorite VR game of mine.

01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:34.620
I don't think it's actually on any of these demos, but, uh, you know, it's a lot

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:38.060
of these games that they, they, they need a demo because it's really, truly the only

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:39.900
way you can see what the game really is.

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:41.980
Yeah.

01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:46.180
Or like a rez was another area X.

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:46.860
Hell yeah.

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:47.180
Yeah.

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:52.380
Well, not even area X, but like, um, there's something, you know, Hey, area X,

01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:53.740
is that going to become a full game?

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:55.500
I'd like to know something about that.

01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:00.900
I always, I was convinced that area X was the prototype for rez too, that for

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:05.300
whatever reason, uh, they didn't believe there'd be enough of a market for, which

01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:12.100
is sad, but I, I, I full on think area X was a demo for a rez too, or a rez VR

01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:14.980
project that that's as far as they got basically.

01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:19.260
And for, they didn't, they didn't get to see the full one to fruition, which is

01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:21.140
sad because I fricking love rez.

01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:22.580
So, all right.

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:26.180
Anyhow, let's talk about other technologies.

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:30.740
Uh, this one coming to the Microsoft Xbox, although it's, it's weird to call

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:33.140
this a new technology, it's just kind of one of those, Oh, it's just, your

01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:34.340
machines are getting smarter.

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:39.540
So basically, um, the 25 digit codes that you may be used to having bundled in with

01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:42.700
your console are not going to necessarily be there anymore.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.740
This is like when you buy a console that has games.

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:52.660
Like when I did finally buy Xbox one, I got the one terabyte Xbox one that came

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:56.700
with halo anniversary collection, but it was a digital copy of halo anniversary

01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:57.020
collection.

01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:58.540
I had to put it into 25 digit code.

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:02.860
What's going to happen now moving forward through a program called digital direct is

01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:04.940
that it's just tied to your Xbox.

01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:08.780
Your Xbox already knows that you're entitled to this software and it just

01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:14.620
shows up in a new section under your, my library section on your Xbox and that the

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.060
game will be right there waiting for you.

01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:21.020
The first time I was going to say, honestly, I just thought it was, cause I

01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:25.100
know that they have the QR codes with the stuff before I was just thought it was

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.140
the phone app and QR codes.

01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:30.060
That's a great way to do it.

01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:30.180
Yeah.

01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:34.700
Cause the queue they were using when Xbox one was first, first out, it was QR codes

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:39.140
because they all had connect cameras and you would hold the QR code and up in the

01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:40.140
connect camera would scan it.

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.740
Well, they could just have, they have an Xbox app, so just use a QR scanner through

01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:44.220
your phone.

01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:51.660
I mean, really smart phones, but I, in some ways this is even better.

01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:56.380
Cause there's no code in a QR form or otherwise there's no codes.

01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:02.220
Um, so that is, uh, something, uh, that is going to be unleashed with the cyberpunk

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:06.060
2077 Xbox one X that's coming out.

01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:10.380
Uh, I think it just came out even though the game itself is not out till September,

01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:13.980
but the console already knows you're entitled to the game.

01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:17.380
I wonder if they're doing that through like a Mac address range or something

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:21.500
where like they know certain consoles manufactured, uh, are just entitled to

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:21.740
this.

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.620
I'm not sure what it really is.

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:24.220
What is it?

01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:25.660
It's preventing resale.

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:34.820
It's because smart folks will sell the game separately from the console or try

01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:37.460
to resell that stuff because that, that happened a lot.

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.700
And so it's the prevent resale.

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:41.860
That is an Intel.

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:42.420
Wow.

01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.220
Loki with the facts tonight.

01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:44.980
I hate it.

01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:45.340
All right.

01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:45.780
No, just kidding.

01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:48.460
Uh, Bobby and chat says it's tied to the serial number.

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:49.340
That makes sense as well.

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.020
I also wanted to read Bobby's comment cause I'm just now seeing this about the VR and

01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:53.820
the demo and all that.

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:57.380
Bobby says, this is why I bring my VR gear to dragon con.

01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:59.220
I can only show you the door.

01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:01.020
It is up to you to walk through it.

01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:01.700
And that's true.

01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:04.460
I was not like completely sold on VR.

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:09.020
I was always kind of like, Oh, you know, my, my brain was still tied to nineties VR

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:11.700
lawnmower man shit, which was very different.

01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:14.820
Like, remember when VR was big in the nineties, remember that?

01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:17.940
And then like it kind of went away on the mind's eye stuff.

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:18.380
Yeah.

01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.980
At least that's what they made us think it is.

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:22.580
My brain was still on that shit.

01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.860
Like I, I remember, okay.

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.100
Storytelling time.

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:32.100
I remember for whatever weird reason, the store that I used to rent video games from

01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:35.380
also had a VR headset that they rented.

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:39.220
It was, and it was a VR headset that would hook up to your super Nintendo.

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.580
All it fucking was you guys.

01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:45.980
It was like these glasses you put on and the TV would just be right there in front of

01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:46.500
your face.

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:47.500
That's all it was.

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:49.940
So that as you turned around, the TV was right there with you.

01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:52.940
There was, there was no fucking VR in that thing at all.

01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.060
And that Jurassic park game is one of the games that I played on it.

01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.980
And that's why that game scared the shit out of me.

01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:00.060
And it had the built in headphones on stuff too.

01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:04.260
But anyway, my point is, is that my perception, my brain was still kind of

01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:04.580
there.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.780
And it wasn't until I really played it at dragon con when then Bobby was like, I

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.420
think Rob will like this.

01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:18.220
And I think Rob will like this music game when then I was like, Oh, Oh, okay.

01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:18.980
Yeah, I want this.

01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:26.180
And that's, that's where VR kind of struggled sometimes because it's not, it's

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:30.620
not something I can just roll the VR footage and you will experience it the

01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:31.300
same way.

01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:34.460
You have to kind of actually check it out.

01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:35.420
All right.

01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:39.140
Uh, was that the Victor max or something?

01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:45.020
Oh, the thing I, I played with from the video store in the nineties.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:46.220
Yeah.

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:50.580
It says they'll run your super Nintendo and Sega Genesis games from a Victor or

01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:52.940
a Victor max virtual reality headset.

01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:53.860
That sounds right.

01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:54.860
That sounds right.

01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:58.060
Cause all it did, you just plugged whatever it was into the headset and then

01:46:58.140 --> 01:46:59.140
while it played.

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:01.500
That sounds stupid.

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:07.900
It was, but, but again, you have to remember in the nineties, VR was a

01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:09.500
fucking fad, right?

01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:10.900
It was the lawnmower man.

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:15.500
It was all this, which was a, a novel by Stephen King that became a really shitty

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:15.900
movie.

01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:19.820
And you know, it just, that was the stuff that was around in the nineties.

01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:23.900
And so somebody in a room somewhere thought, how can we get in on VR?

01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:27.820
What if we could make every super Nintendo game play like a VR game, but it's really

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:31.500
just a piece of shit headset that just puts a TV and Freddie will make billions.

01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:34.100
So anyway, yeah.

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:37.420
All right, moving on.

01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:40.820
So I don't know how we got from digital direct to stories about the lawnmower man,

01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.420
but welcome to orange launch radio.

01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:43.220
Hope you're enjoying the ride.

01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.020
Okay.

01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:44.940
Let's move on.

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:45.500
Loki.

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:47.540
All right.

01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:49.340
So, uh, this is kind of cool.

01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:54.940
So there's a brand new, um, basically it's, I think they have a crowd funding

01:47:54.980 --> 01:48:02.300
campaign for a program called colors live, and it allows folks to, uh, paint on a

01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:08.180
Nintendo switch, but what's unique about it though, is it has a unique pen that has

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.980
pressure sensitivity built into it.

01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:14.140
Now you may be asking yourself, well, how the hell is that possible considering

01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:19.100
that, you know, the touch screen on the Nintendo switch is not pressure sensitive.

01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:24.060
Well, apparently the pen actually connects through your, um, headphone jack.

01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:30.300
And it allows, it basically sends a sound signal to detect the pressure sense, the

01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:34.860
pressure, uh, part of that, whereas the stylist would just, you know, detect

01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.060
where you're tapping on the screen.

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:39.860
So with that together, it works pretty well to be able to actually,

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.140
uh, paint on your tablet.

01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:43.500
So it's pretty cool.

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:47.300
So apparently they're going to, they have a Kickstarter for it right now.

01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:52.780
Um, and apparently the bundle with the app and the pen together will run

01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:54.100
$41.

01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:54.900
Oh, wow.

01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:58.900
Um, so yeah, or let's see here.

01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:01.340
Apparently, I don't know if it's been done.

01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:03.180
It says sign up to be notified.

01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:04.500
Has this been completed yet?

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:05.540
Yes.

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:08.460
So apparently that, uh, just ended.

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:13.180
And of course they looks like they did hit their backing on that, but, uh,

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:18.660
colorslive.com if you're interested in checking that out now that it's, um, over.

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:21.660
But it's an interesting piece of tech though.

01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:25.740
Um, I'm curious to see how that's going to work with, you know, whether

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:29.860
games are going to have there, but apparently this is a long live of, uh,

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:33.060
they've had other colors apps.

01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:37.980
Um, so they had one out apparently back on the original DS, uh, they had one

01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:42.780
for the 3DS called colors 3D, and now they have this colors live with this new pen.

01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:48.660
So it'd be interesting to see, uh, what that looks like when it comes out.

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:50.020
I want to see it at retail.

01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:56.620
Um, so, uh, this Nintendo switch does a lot of neat things and that we're

01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:00.620
starting to hear like some of the things that it can kind of do with the technology

01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:04.300
that, um, weren't always advertised.

01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:06.500
And this is, I think one of those things was like, oh, it's this app that kind of

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:10.500
unlocks more things we're not used to seeing on the Nintendo switch and my brain

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:13.900
went to another game that I've been playing this week that I completely forgot

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.060
to talk about during my gaming week.

01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:18.540
Cause I'm just, my brain's going a hundred miles an hour, but I need to

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:22.340
talk about clubhouse games because that came out on the Nintendo switch this past

01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:23.780
week or the week before as well.

01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:25.020
And so I've been playing that.

01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:28.540
And the reason why I'm bringing it up now with this, uh, other art story, this talk

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:31.140
is about like different technologies that we're unlocking within the switch.

01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:35.540
Did you know, because I didn't, that clubhouse games uses that, and I think

01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:41.180
they call it mosaic technology where when you lie the switch down flat, it

01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:43.100
creates a multi-screen experience.

01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:46.780
I had no idea clubhouse games supported this, but it does.

01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.420
How well does that work with like the switch light?

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:50.980
Does that work with the switch light?

01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:52.620
I don't know yet.

01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:57.020
I will answer that question next week because, uh, my husband has a switch

01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.260
light and I keep meaning to try this with him.

01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:00.220
I just haven't yet.

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:05.420
Um, however, that being said, one of the games that I know this does this in

01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:07.300
clubhouse games is the slot car game.

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:10.460
So the slot car game is, you know, the old slot where you pull the trigger

01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:11.540
and the car goes faster down.

01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:14.740
So there's a lot of tracks that you just, you know, you have on the screen.

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:17.900
If you put two switches next to each other, it makes a track

01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:20.060
that goes across both switches.

01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:21.700
But here's the crazy part.

01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:27.460
You could put one switch vertical, one switch horizontal, one switch vertical

01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:31.220
under that, and like a weird, and it will make a track that goes across all the

01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:32.420
screens and the way you've laid it out.

01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:34.060
It's pretty cool.

01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:34.660
That's rad.

01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:35.860
That is rad.

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:38.940
And nobody, and I think very few people are talking about it because

01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:40.340
it's in fucking clubhouse games.

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:43.220
Um, there is also the piano man.

01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:45.540
I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I love clubhouse games.

01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:46.820
I shouldn't like say, oh, it's just club.

01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:49.300
Actually this, this game doesn't get enough credit.

01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.700
It was bad-ass on the DS and it's bad-ass now.

01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:54.820
So there's also, there's a piano thing.

01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:58.380
So if you put, if you just play it, like you have it down, you can play

01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.420
like you're playing a piano.

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:04.660
If you put another switch next to that, do now it's a two octave piano.

01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:07.100
And you can play like, yeah.

01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:07.620
Right.

01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:11.180
So who knew the switch could even be a switch?

01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:14.340
Who knew the switch could even do this, but you're right.

01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:17.340
I have no idea how the switch light messes with that.

01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:19.340
So I'll try to see if that still works.

01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:22.060
Um, Comments and chat.

01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:25.020
Uh, let's start to see you says, oh yeah, the wife and I have had

01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:26.220
sessions of clubhouse games.

01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.500
Just waiting on the fog nights.

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:28.540
Yeah, I know we need to get to that.

01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.340
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says Mario party does this too.

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:32.660
I'm loving clubhouse games.

01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:34.620
I probably already spent 10 hours on it.

01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:34.900
Yeah.

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:38.100
I'm kicking myself for not bringing it up earlier, but I've been trying to

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.460
produce the show and be a star on it.

01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:42.700
Um, all at the same time.

01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.540
So sometimes I forget to talk about things.

01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:47.100
Uh, but yeah, clubhouse games is, is cool.

01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:49.500
And I love that it like, oh yeah, they, they're, they

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:50.940
aren't even advertising really.

01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:53.300
I mean, it's probably out there on a blog somewhere, but that

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:54.820
the mosaic thing is in it.

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.180
And it's, it's bad-ass.

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.100
It's so cool.

01:52:57.380 --> 01:52:57.780
So.

01:52:58.500 --> 01:52:59.980
I'll have to find out about the switch light though.

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:04.580
Now real quick, because you know, you know, people in chat are asking

01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:06.220
about the VR headset experience.

01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:11.540
I was talking about, uh, bonds double 06 in chat said, um, my girlfriend

01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:14.940
loved your rant, got her coming over to the PC to listen to your story.

01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:20.020
Uh, my girlfriend wants to ask how let down you were that day that

01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:21.300
I played the VR headset.

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:23.420
And my answer was I was 12.

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:24.540
It was fucking rad.

01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:26.660
Like I wasn't let down.

01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:28.180
I was a little bit like, well,

01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:31.620
It's a time when like the virtual boy is like, oh my God, this is the future.

01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:35.500
You know, it's like, I wish it was in color, but yeah.

01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:37.420
It was still amazing.

01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:38.900
Like I was 12 and I didn't care.

01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:44.020
And now, now that I'm looking back on it, I'm like, you know, it was actually

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:49.900
kind of cool that like, cause my, my mom always would complain, like, you

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:55.700
know, that she wanted to watch TV, Rob, get off the TV so I can watch such and

01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:58.420
such, or it was that more, she had a TV in her bedroom, so sometimes it was when

01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:01.380
her and my dad wanted to watch something, get off the TV.

01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:02.140
Right.

01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:06.060
But if I had one of these little headsets, they could use the TV and I

01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:07.500
could play a game on my little headset.

01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:11.620
So, but again, we only, I, I never, you think I'm going to be able to

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:15.300
convince my mom to, can you buy me a $500 headset so you can play?

01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:16.700
No, that wasn't going to fly.

01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:19.980
So I only got to rent it like once or twice and play with it that way.

01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:20.460
That was it.

01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:22.420
So anyway.

01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:24.060
All right.

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:26.940
Uh, Bobby says the mosaic thing was in all the trailers.

01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:28.620
I guess I just completely overlooked.

01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:31.300
I didn't, I didn't need the trailers.

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:34.940
When I heard Clubhouse Games was coming to Switch, I was like, sold.

01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.180
I, I didn't need anything else.

01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:39.140
So maybe that's why I just totally missed it.

01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:39.580
I don't know.

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:43.940
Uh, Questbuster in chat says young me was floored when I tried out a VR rig

01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:47.180
at Epcot, not by the weight of the headset or the giant cable that came

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.900
out the back, but by the experience.

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:49.380
Oh yeah.

01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:49.820
You know?

01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:54.580
And again, especially if you're younger, like you, technology is so much cooler.

01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:58.420
Speaking of things we enjoyed when we were younger, and I think this is a good note

01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:01.660
to end on tonight, guess what's coming back in mobile form.

01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:02.260
That's right.

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:03.500
Neopets.

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:08.740
Neopets that started in 1999.

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:11.900
Neopets is older than this show.

01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:13.100
And that's saying something.

01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:16.540
Neopads I never got in on.

01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:20.900
So Neil will remember in the early days of OLR Loki, like Jamie and I were

01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:25.180
playing this shit all the time and talking about our stupid Neopets on the show.

01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:25.740
How was your game?

01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:27.100
I completely blocked that out from my brain.

01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:31.660
Well, let me remind you, my friend, we used to talk about that during our

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:36.700
gaming weeks, all that fucking Neopets shit and, uh, Neopets it's still around.

01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:37.580
It never went away.

01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:43.660
It's always still been there, but now just now in the year 2020, Neopets

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:44.900
put out a tweet this week.

01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:49.060
Now you can do Neopets on desktop and on mobile.

01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:55.020
So if you, uh, abandoned your Neopet in 1999 and haven't fed it in what, 20

01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:00.020
years, uh, good news is your Neopet is not dead, uh, your Neopet will still be

01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:03.660
there, uh, and you can check on it in a mobile form if that is something,

01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:05.860
um, that you're interested in doing.

01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:09.500
This whole thing was really just a ruse for me to ask the chat.

01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:11.700
I'm going to ask yourself out.

01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.420
I want to know who's still playing Neopets out yourself.

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.340
Who's still playing Neopets?

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.620
Uh, bonds double 06 fesses up.

01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:20.940
I still play Neopets.

01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:22.420
I got the update for mobile.

01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:26.300
Um, let's see what other comments, uh, orange, right.

01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:30.020
Says probably haven't fed my Neopet in about a decade or so pixel pocket says,

01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:33.500
I mean, you could play it on your phone, but it wasn't optimized for it in any way.

01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:35.420
But you knew that.

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:37.380
So you tried wink.

01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:37.820
All right.

01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:42.380
Uh, let's see a fifth dream today said I tried a month or so ago, but

01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:43.940
I can't get into my account.

01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:46.340
Um, so I love it.

01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:52.180
You guys are, uh, I seriously, I think the email address that was tied to my Neopets

01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:57.580
account, I don't use anymore, so I don't even know if I could get into my Neopets

01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:59.020
account even if I wanted to.

01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:00.300
So there's that.

01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:03.140
What in the world is my cat doing?

01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:06.900
I'm sorry you guys, but he's got his eye on something.

01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:08.220
He's jumping up on the counter.

01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:09.700
I don't know.

01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:12.700
Hopefully he must've seen other daddy coming in here and thinking at that

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:16.220
minute was feeding time, even though he's already eaten, but I'm just, I'm

01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:16.940
keeping an eye on him.

01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:17.220
All right.

01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:17.900
Anyway, sorry guys.

01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:22.580
So this is the part of the show where we open up our listener round table.

01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:25.820
And if you have any questions or comments or you want me to tell more VR headset

01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:29.020
stories from the nineties, I certainly will, uh, speak up in our chat room over

01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:33.380
at twitch.tv slash vog network while we wait and gather some questions or

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:33.980
comments.

01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:37.820
Uh, I'm going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories like I usually do at

01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:38.220
this point.

01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:41.700
Um, I don't really have too much.

01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:46.620
I remember we had talked about, um, the PlayStation five and how you wish there

01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:47.740
was more color options.

01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:50.780
And I said that there's probably a skinning company already doing it.

01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:54.740
Well, I already see that dbrand has a PS five listed on their site with skin

01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:55.300
options.

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:59.140
You know, there's going to be third party stuff out the wazoo.

01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:00.380
Anyway, there's certainly that.

01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:02.780
Yeah, we already got some comments in chat.

01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:03.140
Love it.

01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:04.580
Hype mayhem says Rob.

01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:04.860
Okay.

01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:06.900
So I grabbed that samurai showdown collection.

01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:09.380
That's free on Epic and I've been playing that.

01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:11.180
I love it.

01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:14.740
If only for samurai showdown four, which I played the shit out of while in

01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:17.620
college, did you and Loki get that freebie on Epic?

01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:18.900
What are your thoughts on it?

01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:20.580
I did grab the freebie.

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:21.740
I haven't played it yet.

01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.620
Sorry, but I'm looking forward to doing so because I don't remember samurai

01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:26.820
showdown four as much, but I definitely remember the first two.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:28.820
Um, so I will check that out.

01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.580
Loki, did you grab that free on Epic store?

01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:31.420
So I think there's that.

01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:32.340
And there's the freebies.

01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:32.620
Yeah.

01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:33.500
Well, there's that.

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.420
There's art or not.

01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:36.100
Yeah, for sure.

01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:39.540
Uh, and you know, we, we love our, don't forget.

01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:42.940
Not only is there that samurai showdown collection, but if you're a Twitch, uh,

01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:46.380
prime person, there's Neo Geo stuff at the wazoo.

01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:48.020
That's free on Twitch prime right now.

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:49.100
If you use the Twitch app.

01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:50.980
So don't, here's your reminder.

01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:54.060
If you're sitting there right now, if you haven't claimed those games, get on it.

01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:57.780
Uh, and, um, if you want to say thanks, you could always toss your

01:58:57.780 --> 01:58:59.220
free sub over to VOG network.

01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:00.300
We definitely appreciate that.

01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:03.780
Uh, and you get access to our video archives with all the old shows.

01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:07.500
Of course, the audio content is free as it has been for the last 18 years.

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:12.340
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is asking favorite clubhouse games.

01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:13.540
Great question.

01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:18.700
Uh, my favorite, probably speed, honestly, because I remember playing

01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:21.620
that when I was a kid and I don't think I've played that since I was a kid.

01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:25.580
So the fact that like speed of all things is in clubhouse

01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:26.620
games is pretty awesome.

01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:30.180
Now, you know, with 51 games, there's going to be some stinkers though.

01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:37.020
Uh, and like Loki, one of the 51 games in clubhouse games is war.

01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:39.180
Do you know what game war is?

01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:41.460
Have you ever played war?

01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:42.900
Yeah, I've played war.

01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:43.740
Yeah.

01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:46.620
It's just turn over the card and the highest card wins.

01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:47.420
That's war.

01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:49.780
Like we got to pad this out.

01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:54.260
Let's pad this out with some, they, they try, they, what they do.

01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:55.940
And I've never seen war played this way.

01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:57.740
I've seen war played two ways.

01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:00.220
I've seen cut the deck and play it that way.

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:05.020
I've seen spread out an ocean and each person picks a card from

02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:06.420
the ocean and does it that way.

02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:12.220
This one, hold on, y'all, you put three cards face down in front of you and you

02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:14.340
pick which of the three cards you're going to turn over.

02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:18.180
Ooh, that's so thrilling.

02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:19.260
I know, right?

02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:23.580
So anyway, I, I don't want to dwell on the negative cause I love clubhouse games, but

02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:27.300
that was definitely one of the games that made me go Nintendo, please.

02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:28.860
Um, yacht dice.

02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:32.300
Cause it's just yacht, it's Yahtzee, but it was originally, you know, yacht dice.

02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:36.860
Uh, and the six, the six ball, the battle balls, what did, what did it call it?

02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:38.500
Six ball puzzle, something like that.

02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:39.860
I like that one too.

02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:42.300
Um, let's see.

02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:43.780
Oh, and a last card.

02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:45.900
That's just Uno, but under a different name.

02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:50.620
I did, I forced myself to learn how to play president because I was like, is

02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:51.740
this the game I thought it was?

02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:54.260
And it wasn't, but I learned a new game.

02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:55.580
So that's kind of cool.

02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:58.220
Like it's kind of fun to learn a new game on clubhouse games.

02:00:58.260 --> 02:00:59.020
So there was that.

02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:01.180
Uh, let's see, going to some comments from chat.

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:03.580
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, yeah, I hate war.

02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:05.980
I played it enough to get the gold trophy and then turned it off.

02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:07.780
Sevens is my jam.

02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:09.900
Dark Tetsuya says Renegade is my jam.

02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:15.220
Um, Orange Wright says, even the fun fact says that traditional war isn't even a game.

02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:20.620
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, one of the things that's interesting about Klondike is that

02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:25.060
it will tell you immediately when you lose, not when you've gone through all the

02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:28.380
cards, but it will tell you immediately when you lose.

02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:31.740
So you can just undo once and try something different.

02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:32.260
Yeah.

02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:37.420
And, uh, Bobby Blackwell says, president is kind of like great Dow multi.

02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.860
You know, there are so many card games out there that you probably know

02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:43.780
under a different house variation.

02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:45.420
Um, this was funny.

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:45.700
Okay.

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:47.060
So I'm going to tell a work story.

02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:51.500
So we were talking about games, um, because it was like our team building

02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:54.300
call and we were talking about like, what's a game that you have fond memories of.

02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:59.780
And one of the people on the call brought up that her family

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.660
really liked to play BS.

02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:02.700
Right.

02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:04.100
Have you ever played that card game?

02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:08.900
Bullshit, basically where you say you put the cards face down and you're like,

02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:13.860
I am playing two sevens and somebody says bullshit and you turn them over.

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:17.740
And if you didn't actually play two sevens, you have to take all the cards

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:18.460
that have been laid down.

02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:20.900
And if somebody miscalled you on it, they have to take all the cards.

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:21.060
Right.

02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:24.260
So you've probably played this game at some point, but she said, because they

02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:30.380
didn't want to say bullshit in front of the kids, they call the game blue salmon

02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:32.580
or something like that.

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:33.380
I think that's what it was.

02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:35.700
It was a blue salmon or something like that.

02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:37.180
So that's, that's what they play.

02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:38.260
They play blue salmon.

02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:44.020
And so, and that's what they either blue salmon or was it, was it blue?

02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:45.500
I don't know.

02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:47.700
Uh, something badgers, I don't know.

02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:51.780
But anyway, so people come up with all these different names and come to think

02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:56.420
of it, I even remember years ago when I was in church.

02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:57.660
So this was a long time ago.

02:02:57.660 --> 02:02:58.020
Okay.

02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:02.780
Uh, we played bullshit, but it was called, I don't know, or no, it was called, I

02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:04.700
don't, I don't think so.

02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:05.300
Or something like that.

02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:09.220
You just, you say, I don't think so is what you would say, uh, instead of bullshit.

02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:11.900
So anyway, yeah.

02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:13.940
Uh, SG-100 Matt says bull spit.

02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:14.460
Yep.

02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:14.980
Yep.

02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:15.540
Bull spit.

02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:15.860
Yeah.

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:17.260
Boy scout.

02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:19.420
So there it is.

02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:21.140
How funny.

02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:23.060
SG-100 Matt says, that's what my grandmother told me.

02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:24.060
It was bull spit.

02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:29.660
That's a really, I love the stories we get told as kids.

02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:30.140
All right.

02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.180
Any lies you're telling your children, Loki?

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:35.620
I don't know.

02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:37.780
Probably.

02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:38.460
All right.

02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:42.620
Oh, Bobby Blackwell says, I doubt it was the name of it in the DS games.

02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:43.100
That's right.

02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:44.900
Oh, as that said, the broccoli farm.

02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:46.660
Well, the listeners with the receipts.

02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:49.460
Well, I love it.

02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:50.580
All right.

02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:53.380
Uh, Loki, any other last minute stories?

02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:58.060
Yes, this is, uh, it's interesting.

02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:04.460
So I don't know if you remember back to the Simpsons where there was a gag where I think

02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:11.460
Bart was playing a, a golf game called a Lee Corrello's putting challenge is like some

02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:12.780
really terrible game.

02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:14.980
Well, apparently someone's decided to make that a real thing.

02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:21.740
And so you can now play that for free and it's, uh, so, uh, it's pretty funny.

02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:25.140
They actually put together the game using sound clips from the show.

02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:30.060
I love that somebody went to the links to actually make it a real thing.

02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:30.580
That's great.

02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:32.220
The Simpsons predicting the future yet again.

02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:33.620
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:35.460
Yeah, it looks like Martin was playing that.

02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:40.340
So, um, that's funny, but neat.

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:41.460
That's it.

02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:42.380
All right.

02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:44.780
Well, I think that's it from our chat room as well.

02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:47.260
So this is the part of the show where we're going to wrap things up.

02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:50.580
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show this week or listening

02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:52.660
to us live, however you consume orange launch radio.

02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:54.700
We really appreciate you guys being here.

02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:57.260
And if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange laundry, you know, tell a friend or

02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:00.820
two, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but

02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:05.700
we need, we need those voices to be here to help, uh, help us, uh, spread, spread, spread

02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:08.140
the chat and the love and the different perspectives that we have.

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:11.700
Spread the chat and the love and the different perspectives and all that good stuff.

02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:14.260
Uh, we will be back in seven days.

02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:16.420
I'm sure there's going to be more gaming news this week.

02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:18.660
This is probably going to be a pretty busy month for gaming news.

02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:21.460
It's not going to happen all at once, but like slow, slow trickle

02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:23.140
through probably all the summer.

02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:25.660
Do we have any big events that we don't necessarily, Oh, the EA, we talked

02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:27.580
about the earlier show, so the EA events this next week, right?

02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:30.340
So we'll maybe I'll get, Oh my gosh.

02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:33.820
Maybe Jamie and I get to spend three hours talking about a mass effect

02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:35.140
trilogy remaster next week.

02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:36.340
I really hope that's the case.

02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:37.620
Fingers and toes crossed.

02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:42.820
So maybe, or more Sims or I don't know, new star Wars game.

02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:43.860
There's that for sure.

02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:44.500
We know that one.

02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.780
I don't feel, yep.

02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:48.900
So that'll be some exciting stuff to talk about next week is as much

02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:53.420
shit as EA sometimes gets, uh, there's some pretty darn good games that come

02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:56.140
out of it, so we'll, uh, we'll, we'll be looking at that for next week.

02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:56.900
And who knows what else?

02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:59.300
Uh, so we'll be back in seven days to do that all again.

02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:01.980
Thank you so much for downloading, uh, the feed.

02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:03.580
Uh, and thank you so much.

02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:06.980
Uh, for those of you guys that are listening live as well.

02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:10.260
Um, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend, leave a nice five

02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:11.620
star review on a place like iTunes.

02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:13.940
I don't think we've gotten a review on iTunes in like three years.

02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:17.700
Um, but I would appreciate if someone would leave one tonight, um, or

02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:19.060
wherever it is you found this show.

02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:22.460
Uh, I know a lot of you are listening on Spotify, uh, and other places as well.

02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.540
Maybe you're listening directly at vognetwork.com.

02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:25.140
That's fine too.

02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:26.300
However, you're listening to the show.

02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:28.180
I appreciate you being here.

02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:28.980
Thank you so much.

02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:30.900
Um, I think that's it.

02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:32.980
I think we get to give our final thoughts now.

02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:34.980
So, um, I'll start.

02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:38.700
Um, my final thought tonight is, uh, black lives still matter.

02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:41.700
Black trans lives, especially still matter.

02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:43.180
It is pride month.

02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:48.620
Let us not forget that pride was a riot that was started by trans

02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:49.860
women, black trans women.

02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:51.980
So, uh, don't forget, don't forget that.

02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:54.780
Um, that's, that's what I got.

02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:55.300
Loki.

02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:59.780
I'm going to probably end up playing more Minecraft this week

02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:03.060
because I'm stuck in that loop.

02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:05.540
So I need to stream some.

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:07.860
All right.

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:10.260
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Onch Radio.

02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:12.340
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight.

02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:16.940
Uh, we will see you next time here at Orange Onch Radio, uh, in seven days

02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:17.940
here at the Voice Geeks Network.

02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:19.180
Uh, happy gaming.

02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:19.980
Enjoy it.

02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:21.340
There's a lot of good stuff out there.

02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:22.540
Uh, enjoy it.

02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:25.300
Good luck when those pre-orders for PlayStation five go up.

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:27.620
Have a great week, everybody.

02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:28.820
