0	18040	This week it's nearly summer, which means the game developers, publishers, and makers
18040	19800	around all present their wares.
19800	22780	This year, from a distance, introverts unite apart.
22780	25800	Join us for the announcement, preparations, and schedule your favorites, starting right
25800	29520	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
29520	35120	Orange Lounge Radio Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
35120	38080	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38080	43680	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 823 for this June the 14th
43680	45360	of 2020.
45360	49620	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here in the studio that we've used for a little while
49620	53080	out of a lot of the various studios that we've used over the years.
53080	59180	But I'm by myself as we are practicing social distancing, as is still the case right now.
59180	62320	But I am joined thanks to the magic of Discord by my co-hosts.
62320	64680	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
64680	65680	Hello.
65680	66680	Hi.
66680	67680	How are you?
67680	68680	I'm okay.
68680	69680	Good.
69680	71880	I see I see still Kirby in the background.
71880	75400	I'm looking at doll legs as well.
75400	76400	And there's my camera.
76400	77400	I gotcha.
77400	78400	But you look great.
78400	79400	Thank you.
79400	80400	All right.
80400	82400	Let's go to Techmaster Loki.
82400	83400	Hello.
83400	84400	Hi.
84400	85400	And I'm trying to figure out what is that?
85400	86400	Is that Mega Zeus?
86400	91040	Oh my gosh, the sequel to ZZT or something like that, right?
91040	92040	In the background with you?
92040	93040	Yeah.
93040	94040	I love it.
94040	95040	So I was trying to find some interesting background.
95040	98560	So it was either like some weird trippy Minecraft thing that only lasts for three minutes or
98560	100320	a long play of Mega Zeus.
100320	102280	So that's what it's going to be.
102280	103280	I love it.
103280	104280	I'm with it.
104280	105280	That's awesome.
105280	106280	All right.
106280	108680	Well, we have had a busy week in the gaming world.
108680	112160	I know we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight, so I want to get right on into
112160	113160	it.
113160	114780	We had a lot of news this week.
114780	118360	This would have been the week that E3 would have taken place.
118360	123800	But obviously with the situation of well, first off, E3, of course, was not it was in
123800	125760	a weird place as it was.
125760	127240	And then COVID happened.
127240	129780	And then it was certainly not going to happen this year.
129780	133280	So all the gaming companies have kind of scrambled to do their own thing.
133280	138240	IGN brought a lot of people together under like a summer banner.
138800	143840	But Sony moved forward and this week had their PlayStation 5 preview, which was originally
143840	145080	going to be last week.
145080	150240	But obviously with everything that's going on in the call for racial justice and equality,
150240	154320	which is still going on, just because you're not seeing it 24 7 on CNN doesn't mean it's
154320	155840	not happening.
155840	159880	Good friends, several friends of mine were at an L.A. protest today because they kind
159880	166000	of turned the L.A. pride into a huge thing for a support of Black Lives Matter and Black
166240	168600	trans lives matter, of course.
168600	170720	So all of that is still going on.
170720	179000	But some of the, you know, kind of where do we kind of fit in the other things that go
179000	185040	on, such as video games and recreation, trying to find the places for that appropriately.
185040	189440	We did have the PlayStation 5 announcement this week and there was a lot.
189440	191760	There was a lot to it.
191760	196400	Let me just kind of start from the top and ask my co-hosts, just generally, what were
196400	200560	your reactions to Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal?
200560	204200	Loki, I'll start with you.
204200	207160	I started watching when I thought it was supposed to be on.
207160	209680	And apparently there was like trailers that started before that time.
209680	213240	So I was a little disappointed that it didn't start when they said they were going to, at
213240	215000	least I thought.
215000	219360	Otherwise, content wise, yeah, that's PlayStation.
219360	225280	I mean, there's a few games that look pretty interesting, not necessarily the ones like
225280	226560	the mainstream stuff.
226560	231080	So yeah, I don't know.
231080	234280	Some of the announcements are disappointing, like seriously, Rockstar, we're going to do
234280	242880	Grand Theft Auto 5 again, again, you know, for a third generation of consoles.
242880	243880	I don't know.
243880	250760	We didn't know more about it, like what exactly the systems can, you know, what are the features
250760	251760	of the system?
251760	255320	And then he kind of showed some of the console and like some of the accessories for some
255320	259040	reason, no PlayStation VR, I'm kind of surprised.
259040	264280	And yet we don't know price or release date or which of those games that they showed are
264280	266960	actually coming out at release.
266960	272120	Or is it going to be release window, you know, the 12 months after release or whatever?
273120	274760	Yeah, I mean, it looks really cool.
274760	276720	A lot of the games look pretty nice.
276720	281600	I don't think that they're necessarily like blowing me away with this looks drastically
281600	286920	different than like the PlayStation 4, but you know, I'll have to see.
286920	290040	And then also with these games, I mean, are they going to be coming out on PlayStation
290040	291040	4 as well?
291040	292840	Or is these all PlayStation 5?
292840	296840	I mean, it's just a lot of like kind of unknowns there.
296840	300240	So yeah, we'll have to see.
300240	304560	So maybe some more specifics on some of these scenarios would have been good for you.
304560	306120	Yeah, I can see that.
306120	309800	You know, we don't know exactly what is a PlayStation 5 exclusive.
309800	315640	Like I'm sure we can assume the horizon, the out west, I forgot the westward, westward
315640	316640	ho.
316640	321360	I forget what was the name of the horizon west life.
321360	322360	The horizon.
322360	323360	What was it?
323360	327200	It was horizon Forbidden West.
327200	328200	Thank you.
328200	329200	Horizon Forbidden West.
329240	331680	I can assume that is a PlayStation 5 exclusive.
331680	334960	Well, actually, no, I can't even assume that anymore because there's been all that rumble
334960	338080	rumble rabble about Zero Dawn coming to PC at some point.
338080	339220	But you know what?
339220	341120	What exactly is a PlayStation 5 exclusive?
341120	342600	I think you bring up a good point.
342600	345120	What might be available on PlayStation 4?
345120	350040	The grand theft auto 5 thing I thought certainly was going to lead into a conversation about
350040	355000	the larger conversation about backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 5.
355000	357640	I thought that's how they were opening the door to that conversation.
358160	360080	Here's the first of all of these games.
360080	365640	And granted, yes, Sony has confirmed because there was an odd footing that happened after
365640	371080	the Mark Cerny chat that was originally GDC, where he had said the top 100 games.
371080	373000	And then Sony said, it's going to be a lot more than that.
373000	375960	Those are just like, they kind of quickly corrected that statement.
375960	380780	But they haven't really just given us a firm what to expect of backwards compatibility.
380780	386080	We know PlayStation 4 is there in some capacity, but is it everything?
386080	387600	Did they get every single game?
387600	389200	Are there going to be some things excluded?
389200	392260	What about PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 1?
392260	396840	We know what all those details were going to be because they didn't really go into
396840	397840	any of that.
397840	401280	And I know that's because they have this whole summer thing where they're going to have more
401280	406000	announcements I'm sure, or more stuff to talk about around Gamescom and all that later in
406000	407000	the summer.
407000	408000	So we'll get more details then.
408000	409080	But it's kind of annoying though.
409080	411900	It's like this drip feed of information.
411900	418420	But there's also a part of me that understands the message this episode or whatever was supposed
418420	423700	to be the games, games, games, games, and they didn't really want to deviate from that.
423700	427460	And maybe there's something to be said about what they wanted to talk about the future
427460	429940	of games and maybe not linger so much on the past.
429940	435940	But if that's the case, that Grand Theft Auto 5 was a misstep in my book, but I still found
435940	436940	a lot of positives.
436940	440380	However, before we go on too much longer, I definitely want to let Dark Soccer have
440380	441380	a say.
441380	442380	What was your thoughts?
442380	444580	I don't know if you watched it or saw some of the trailers.
444580	446380	What did you think, Dark Soccer?
446380	448580	I looked and saw a little bit of it.
448580	453020	I'm kind of interested in whatever the Resident Evil thing is going to be.
453020	454660	The design is fine.
454660	460060	I don't even know if that's going to be a final design because they've changed before.
460060	462060	I don't know.
462060	467260	This might sound a little bit odd, but I was really focusing more on social issues right
467260	468260	now.
468260	469260	No, it's not odd at all.
469260	478900	I've been actually doing some design work for a couple of the protest organizations.
478900	484460	Interesting point, though, about the design possibly not being finalized.
484460	485460	You're right.
485460	487020	They don't always.
487020	493260	The thing that jumps in my mind like a neon sign is the PlayStation 3 controller.
493260	496260	Remember when we first saw that at E3 years ago, it was like the boomerang.
496260	497580	I actually kind of liked the boomerang.
497580	498900	That thing was terrible.
498900	499900	I liked it.
499900	502820	It was looking at it made my hands hurt.
502820	506780	All right, five different opinions, whatever.
506780	512100	But when it comes to the console itself, I would be surprised if there was major changes.
512100	516980	But we've I mean, we've seen this thing meme-ified like crazy at this point.
516980	518420	Let me actually roll some footage, of course.
518420	521860	I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this by now, but this is what the PlayStation 5
521860	523540	like reveal actually looked like.
523540	527340	And it's if you hear some ominous music in the background, that's because it's from PlayStation's
527340	529660	official reveal on the YouTube.
529660	532820	And we've seen this thing meme-ified like crazy.
532820	539740	Talk about how it's an Oreo or one of those reverse ones sandwiches.
539740	542860	Talk about how it looks like a Wi-Fi router.
542860	544820	And just we've seen all cells heads.
544820	545820	Yes.
545820	548160	Yeah, we've seen perfect cells head.
548160	554460	And I saw, though, like one where they did like they did like human forms of the systems
554460	555460	is kind of neat.
555460	556460	Yeah.
556580	561020	There were some like a porned up versions, but there were some other tasteful versions
561020	563780	that it's kind of interesting to see that conceptualized.
563780	568380	But I know one that looks really high fashion, actually, that I was like, I'd wear that.
568380	574980	I have to admit, like I, I think it I like it because it's different.
574980	579140	I mean, is it the perfect, you know, figure or whatever?
579140	580140	Maybe not.
580140	581140	But I kind of like that.
581140	586180	It's not just a box, you know, and PlayStation's always well, I shouldn't say always, but they've
586340	591020	they've done some weird things before, like the PlayStation three being a form and grill.
591020	592020	Come on.
592020	594000	Like, that was a weird thing, too.
594000	596540	And and it attracts so much dust.
596540	597540	It did.
597540	601500	I would I would I would rather this system not attract that much dust and this system
601500	602500	be quiet.
602500	603500	They did.
603500	605500	Mine's still hooked up.
605500	606500	OK.
606500	609220	Technically, I have a PlayStation three hooked up here in the corner, but I don't even think
609220	611300	it's hooked into a television right now.
611300	617420	But anyway, I really think at the end of the day, people are not going to pass on the PlayStation
617420	621060	five because they don't like the way the console looks like.
621060	627780	I, I, I guess maybe you might have people that like hold out for a year because maybe
627780	630220	they're not super happy with the launch lineup.
630220	633720	And we all know there's been all these talks and all these renderings.
633720	639140	I'm sure many people have seen that Spider-Man console rendering, which it looked good in
639140	640140	red and so forth.
640140	641620	But these are all fan dreams.
641620	646460	But at some point, the console will likely come out in different colors and different
646460	647780	shapes and things like that.
647780	649860	Or maybe there'll be a mini or something.
649860	650860	Money.
650860	651860	Yeah.
651860	652860	And I know skins.
652860	653860	Yeah.
653860	654860	And I could see people maybe holding out for that.
654860	659940	But I feel like if if there's really the games on this console, people want to play day one,
659940	661980	they'll figure out where to put that console.
661980	663500	And it's not going to be a big deal.
663500	665860	Like the look of it is not a big deal.
665860	673340	I wondered myself if the shape wasn't in part to do with air circulation and maybe having
673340	679220	the odd shape meant that the vents would have to be exposed a little bit and you wouldn't
679220	682220	maybe be able to fit it into a very tight, confined space.
682220	683220	Very easy.
683220	684520	And maybe that's intentional.
684520	690620	I'm just, that's my like a tinfoil hat theory, I guess if nothing else, maybe, maybe I don't
690620	691620	know.
691620	693100	It does look very tall.
693100	699340	I wish they had shown there was a shot that I saw where the system can be laid horizontally
699340	706220	as well, because otherwise that looks like it's going to be a hard fit for my entertainment
706220	707220	console.
707220	709580	I don't think I'd be even able to fit it in there.
709580	710580	Otherwise it had to lay flat.
710580	715460	And I kind of like, you know, like everyone's like dogging on the Xbox console, but I like
715460	717860	my console to be kind of flat because I can stack them.
717860	723060	Yeah, I know that's not really making sense for, you know, thermal design and everything.
723060	725020	But I like being able to stack stuff.
725020	729600	I loved having my PlayStation 2 and being able to stack stuff on top of it or my Xbox
729600	730600	360.
730600	734060	I like them being somewhat flat so that you can do that.
734060	739300	Even if it's not necessarily like another game console, maybe like controllers or something.
739300	745820	You know, the PlayStation 3, I had that and it had to be off to the side because it didn't
745820	748500	really fit anywhere and you couldn't put anything on top of it.
748500	750060	So it was really awkward.
750060	752700	And I don't care, whatever, who cares what the console looks like.
752700	758220	Let's talk a little bit about the fact that you have now a disk drive version or a Blu-ray
758220	762660	drive version and we have a no Blu-ray version.
762660	766220	And this is something we've already seen Microsoft do in the last generation, but I believe this
766220	770260	is the first time we're seeing Sony go this direction of an all digital console.
770260	772580	We didn't hear anything about price.
772580	776900	We didn't hear anything about release date, which I can understand the release date side
776900	780940	of things because they're probably still trying to navigate the waters with COVID and everything.
781180	787300	And second wave, especially in countries where these things are produced and so forth, there's
787300	791500	still probably a lot of to be determined when it comes to that.
791500	796700	And the price, though, I think a lot of people are getting the sense they're playing chicken
796700	802820	with Microsoft a little bit, but having the two different options certainly opens the
802820	808300	door for them to be able to say, oh, we're going to price this one below Microsoft.
808300	810780	We're going to price this one above Microsoft.
811340	817540	I kind of feel like it's going to be obvious that Xbox Series X will also have disk drive.
818340	821580	Microsoft will also do that because they've already done that.
821940	826460	They already have a digital version of the Xbox one, so that's not a new thing.
828220	834020	I just don't, I need to know what the price difference is before I would decide.
834020	838380	And I'd still probably, even though I do mostly digital purchases anyways, I still like having
838380	839580	the flexibility for it.
839580	846060	So I would probably just still get one with the drive either, unless it's like several
846060	846980	hundred dollars more.
848340	854100	But I don't know, I would have to see really what the cost savings is going to be on that.
854540	859060	But I still like the flexibility of it, even if it's not something I'm going to be using a
859060	859380	lot.
860380	864820	Dark Sakura, do you think digital versus disk is a conversation that will happen in your
864820	865220	household?
866140	872620	Probably, we're kind of blasé about some things, like we may get a physical copy if it's
872620	874380	got stuff I think that we want with it.
874900	880860	But I don't know, since the whole quarantine started going on, I think that we did get a
880860	884420	little bit less on top of the physical media side of things.
884580	885860	Really, it was just Animal Crossing.
886140	893100	So, you know, now me, I want good packaging, I want good artwork, I want to be able to see
893100	898620	it and look at it and enjoy it and put it somewhere so I can still look at it and see it
898620	899500	and enjoy it.
900980	905660	We have, I mean, well, you've seen what my closet, my game room looks like full of the
905660	908540	boxes and some of the best artwork that you know, that you can see.
908540	912500	So I would rather enjoy having a physical copy.
912500	916020	However, I also enjoy having space and we are running quite short of it.
917100	918300	Let me ask a weird question.
918300	921540	This might be a stupid question, but there's no such thing as stupid questions, right?
921540	922580	Unless I'm the one asking them.
922580	923780	Only stupid people.
923780	925700	OK, well, then this is a stupid people statement.
927100	935220	Could the disk driveless version be a response to COVID and this new world we find ourselves in?
936060	941860	No, it's because the system's going to be expensive and so they want to have a version that's cheaper.
941900	942380	That's all.
943620	951620	How many, I mean, not too many, say, laptops come with a CD, DVD drive.
952740	955060	I mean, again, cuts down on cost.
955060	956100	You can make a better computer.
956340	958820	So I look at it that way.
959380	964580	Does any a lot of laptops don't come with a drive so they can make them thinner.
964820	971740	But with any well, maybe not so much on the Mac side of the house, but on the PC side, you have
971740	972660	multiple storefronts.
972660	978020	You can purchase software from multiple options to make purchases, whereas you have a closed
978020	982380	system with PlayStation or Microsoft and or purchasing things.
982380	988140	So it's granted they do a lot more sales nowadays, I think, digitally, but.
989180	993900	It's really, you know, you're only going to be purchasing it there, and if it goes on sale, it's
993900	998020	because the publishers decided to put it on sale and you can't get stuff secondhand, you can't
998020	999180	sell used games.
1000540	1005340	If that's important to you, then, you know, something to consider.
1005380	1009460	I, you know, like I said, I like the flexibility whether I use it or not.
1009460	1016460	I know with this generation, PlayStation 4, it's been mostly digital, like 99% of the stuff I
1016460	1017940	bought is digital.
1018620	1019500	So I don't know.
1020180	1021900	I'm still buying a lot of physical things.
1021900	1026100	I mean, I'm open to digital and I do more and more digital, especially on the Switch, because I
1026100	1027300	like the portability and all that.
1027300	1030420	But there's still a lot of physical things I buy.
1030420	1031180	But I don't know.
1031180	1037620	I mean, I'm not as like staunchly against an all digital thing as I once was at one point.
1037620	1040860	I mean, after all, and I think this point got brought up in chat.
1040860	1042780	I'm sorry, guys, I don't mean to ignore you guys in chat.
1043020	1047820	My phone is all digital and I have a ton of applications and software and games and the like on my
1047820	1052300	phone, you know, so it's not like an all digital thing is a completely foreign concept.
1052460	1056860	Now, what's funny, and this comment made me laugh in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
1056860	1060380	because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right
1060380	1061780	after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
1062180	1066420	And Quest Buster says the Phantom called and wants people to remember it was a thing.
1066820	1067900	Well, the what?
1068300	1068820	The Phantom.
1068820	1069220	Remember that?
1069300	1070100	Phantoms.
1070140	1070460	The what?
1070460	1071020	Phantom.
1071060	1071620	Phantoms.
1071660	1072500	Oh, that was a movie.
1072540	1072860	Right.
1072900	1073740	A really bad movie.
1074660	1074980	Anyway.
1074980	1075380	Wasn't it bad?
1075700	1076100	I don't remember.
1076100	1076540	I don't remember.
1076620	1082260	Anyway, the point with all that is, is that there is such a thing as being ahead of your time.
1082820	1088220	Hello, the Sega Dreamcast called, you know, there is such a thing as like you're too ahead of your
1088220	1091980	time that it just doesn't catch on, you know, the same way.
1091980	1095060	And maybe in a way, that's what happened with the Phantom.
1095460	1097180	Well, Tiger Claw has a good point too.
1097180	1101100	Like speaking about backwards compatibility, we don't know how that's going to work.
1101100	1107180	So if say, for example, the system is backwards compatible with PlayStation one, two, three, four
1107900	1112020	games, you know, and those can be read via the disk drive.
1112100	1117060	It may be advantageous to have a disk drive in the system so that you can play all those.
1117100	1118060	That's a very good point.
1118060	1122780	You're going to need a disk drive if backwards compatibility beyond four is a thing.
1123020	1127540	I mean, and even with four being a thing, if you have PlayStation four disks, unless you have a
1127540	1131340	digital license, a PlayStation five is not going to automatically recognize that.
1131340	1137780	So that's a very excellent thought for folks that are considering disk versus, um, digital, uh,
1137820	1138260	quickly.
1138260	1141660	And then, then I want to talk a little more about some of the games at the PlayStation five event
1141660	1142100	quickly.
1142300	1146820	Does anybody want to tinfoil hat what the price and date?
1147100	1151940	You don't have to hit the date on the head, but what the price and date ish will be.
1152300	1154300	Any of my co-hosts want to take a stab at it?
1156300	1165020	Uh, four 99, five 99 and November.
1166700	1167300	Dark soccer.
1168460	1168700	Low.
1168700	1173660	It's going to be four 99, a higher model system is going to run about six 50, 700.
1174500	1175220	They did it before.
1176860	1180860	Um, I am also going to go, I'm going to go with a four 99, five 99.
1180860	1186780	I don't think dark soccer's thought is beyond because, you know, again, if the diskless one is
1186780	1188580	four 99, that's what they're going to say.
1188580	1194180	The price is, and we all remember when Sony got a lot of shit during the PlayStation three reveal
1194180	1196020	with the 599 us dollars.
1196300	1201860	If they hit that mark or beyond it with the one with the disk drive, they are not going to be
1201860	1206780	emphasizing that price there that you're going to see all the marketing material says starting at
1206940	1208020	four 99.
1208340	1209700	That's what it will all say.
1210220	1215060	Uh, as far as the timeframe, I'm going to predict a delay to March.
1216140	1217740	I don't think it comes out this year.
1217820	1221540	And I, I know, yes, I know all the games are already saying holiday and so forth.
1221900	1224340	I I'm going to be the weirdo that says they don't make it.
1224580	1229940	And it's, it's because of, of the COVID situation and just the supply demand type of thing.
1230020	1232540	I don't think it makes the holiday, but we'll see.
1233580	1234020	All right.
1234260	1242780	Um, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, DJ Rama S says, here's the deal on
1242780	1246900	backwards compatibility, whether it's Xbox series X or PlayStation five, both systems have the
1246900	1249260	hardware to be backwards compatible with its older systems.
1249260	1254420	The issues lies into licensing, meaning of third party companies want their games to be played on
1254420	1255220	the newest system.
1255500	1260220	It is a weird thing to think about in a way though, when we think like, Oh, the PlayStation two
1260220	1262820	just played every single PlayStation one game.
1263060	1267820	And I'm trying to think, have we, uh, and maybe the Wii U played every Wii game and those things
1267820	1272700	weren't really a problem, but backwards compatibility isn't as common as you'd necessarily think.
1272700	1273140	Maybe.
1273500	1275940	Although Nintendo did a very good job with their handheld systems.
1275980	1280460	I would say the handheld systems where we got really spoiled, like Game Boy Color played Game Boy
1280460	1284300	games, Game Boy Advance played Game Boy Color games, DS played advanced games, 3DS played DS
1284300	1284500	games.
1284660	1288780	Like they've, their portables were like always very good with backwards compatibility, but
1288780	1291340	otherwise we don't see it a lot.
1291940	1293380	Oh, interesting.
1293860	1299060	Um, Phoenix 7726 says, wait, they have a cell processor for PS3 play, huh?
1299500	1302380	Uh, we don't know yet for sure.
1302420	1306060	We don't know, um, what that's going to entail.
1306180	1311580	We don't know if it would be emulation or if it's even going to be there or could they do something
1311580	1314660	via PlayStation now and their streaming service.
1314660	1317100	Like we don't, we don't know.
1317540	1318660	It could be any of those things.
1318780	1320540	So, all right.
1320940	1326340	Anyhow, uh, let's talk a little more about some of the games that we saw at the PlayStation event.
1326340	1331060	We've mentioned a couple of them, such as the, um, Horizon Forbidden West, but what about some of the
1331060	1331660	other games?
1331660	1333580	Were there other things that caught your eye?
1333580	1337140	I know a lot of people were talking about Spider-Man, Miles Morales.
1337580	1340020	A lot of people were lighting up at that trailer.
1340660	1341780	Yeah, that looked pretty good.
1341780	1346820	I haven't played the original one, but it looks like a great game and I, the new one looks pretty good too.
1347060	1350580	It was a little confusing because at first, you know, everyone's like, oh, a new game.
1350580	1353060	And then, then it was like, oh, it's only expansion.
1353140	1356500	Oh, is it a, you know, is it a new game or is it an expansion?
1356500	1361700	So apparently what it sounds like, it's, it's a spinoff kind of like how they did with infamous.
1361700	1362660	They have like that.
1362700	1367820	I don't remember what the subtitle was on that one, but there was one that was like a, a spinoff game in
1367820	1370580	the same engine, but it's its own thing.
1370980	1376540	So, um, I think it's just a spinoff.
1376740	1381220	Um, I don't know if it's like an expansion with the remastered game or something like that.
1381220	1385220	Well, they, they really butchered the messaging after that trailer, because you had that executive
1385220	1389380	who said, oh, it's no, it's the original, uh, one with additional content.
1389620	1393980	And then they had Insomniac had to come out and say, no, it's an all new game.
1393980	1395300	It's just not Spider-Man two.
1395300	1397300	It's like a Spider-Man side thing.
1397300	1399380	Like, and they said it was like Uncharted.
1399380	1402420	Uncharted had that side game that came out not that long ago.
1402700	1406340	Um, and of course I forget the subtitle in the moment, Lost Legacy.
1406340	1406860	Was that it?
1407100	1409020	So, uh, they, they had that.
1409020	1414780	So it's, you know, but it's, it's going to be a similar game, you know, in that.
1415060	1419660	Or, uh, another good one might be like, there's Bioshock two and then there's Bioshock Infinite.
1419820	1420860	Which one's the sequel?
1423460	1425060	Well, technically both are.
1426060	1426620	Right.
1427260	1428980	Infinite's a side story though.
1428980	1430540	Infinite ties everything together.
1431260	1433340	I know, I know, but which one's the sequel?
1433340	1436260	So there's, there's different ways you can kind of do a sequel.
1436260	1441980	I think, I don't know, but they really butchered the messaging on that.
1442060	1445540	So, uh, I think it's, it's going to be a fine game.
1445540	1449140	If you enjoyed the Spider-Man game, there's no reason you're not going to like this one as well.
1449140	1449820	I'm sure.
1450060	1452580	And it will be prettier cause it's on PlayStation five.
1453020	1458340	Um, Dark Soccer already mentioned Resident Evil eight, the village or village, uh, that looks scary.
1458340	1460580	That looked like it might've been a VR thing as well.
1460860	1467340	And you pointed out, they avoided talk about VR to all the last game was fully playable in VR.
1467340	1469260	So it makes sense that this one is.
1469940	1470340	Yeah.
1471180	1474060	Uh, Gran Turismo seven was pretty.
1474060	1474380	Yeah.
1474620	1474940	Yeah.
1474940	1475460	Look pretty.
1475780	1476060	Yeah.
1476060	1478100	I don't like sim games though.
1478380	1478620	Yeah.
1478620	1482140	I don't usually get into the racing sim games, but it, it did look pretty.
1482260	1484500	How about Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart?
1484900	1488060	Um, that, that game play was really smooth.
1488060	1491620	Like it, it was kind of neat to watch that game play, uh, flow.
1493100	1493380	Yeah.
1493380	1496180	I think that was one of the trailers I missed originally.
1496220	1499740	Um, I saw the announcement for it, but it looked, it looks nice.
1500020	1501780	Looks better than the movie that they did.
1503380	1507420	I totally forgot about the movie, but yeah, it was just probably a good thing that you forget about it.
1507780	1508100	Yeah.
1508340	1511980	It just, it really snapped as they were moving from like, you know, place to place.
1511980	1517300	Like, I, I definitely think that was a way to show off the solid state drive and the types of things that that can bring to it.
1517300	1518340	So it was interesting.
1518660	1526100	Uh, the Demon's Souls remake, uh, they didn't really show us a lot outside of a, you know, creepy looking trailer, no gameplay here.
1526540	1531660	Um, but I'm sure that'll be something that Alan will be into if I pick up the PlayStation five right away.
1532180	1533500	Cause I know he likes those games.
1534300	1537020	I liked the trailer for Deathloop.
1537060	1538060	Did you guys see that?
1538100	1542700	The Arkane Studios game, which kind of was, I forgot all about that.
1542700	1545300	They'd shown that last year at the Bethesda thing.
1545380	1550780	Um, and I completely forgot about it because originally when I saw it, I was like, Oh, another dishonored.
1550780	1553060	And it's like, definitely I'm like, Oh yeah, that's right.
1553060	1553580	They have that game.
1554260	1555980	Um, yeah, it looks interesting.
1556500	1557380	I like the art style.
1557660	1564460	Uh, NBA 2K21 was there, which, you know, I thought that was a very odd approach to really focus on the sweat.
1564900	1567700	I don't think sweat is a thing that people like to think about a lot.
1567700	1572460	Um, so that was a sweat and thinking about how much money you're gonna be spending on microtransactions.
1573260	1582660	It was an odd approach to a trailer, but I mean, we can't sit here and go sports, whatever, because sports games, people do buy those.
1582660	1583900	A lot of people buy those.
1583900	1584660	So it's important.
1584700	1589060	Can't wait to see the extreme fidelity in the bugginess of the new WWE.
1589100	1589500	Oh, that's right.
1589500	1590500	They're skipping this year.
1590780	1593620	Well, hopefully it's not a piece of garbage.
1593620	1602180	I mean, NBA 2K is usually okay, but that's, that's only in comparison to NBA, uh, I don't even know what they call the EA one.
1602500	1604860	I guess it doesn't matter because that one's not very good.
1605380	1610820	But yeah, it's just, it's a big mess of microtransactions and loot boxes.
1610900	1612980	Uh, that's all I think of that series.
1612980	1615940	So, uh, and then we had Sackboy.
1616020	1621620	I was excited about that because I kind of feel like the little big planet games kind of need to come back a little bit.
1621780	1628340	And this is sort of that it seems like now I completely understand media molecules moved on to dreams and they have a big old thing.
1628500	1635340	So I'm, I, it's kind of one of those, Oh, I didn't think they'd go back to this idea, but Sackboy is a PlayStation mascot of sorts.
1635540	1637180	And the trailer looked really cute.
1637260	1638420	I was into it.
1640540	1642580	This, this, it looks cool.
1642820	1649340	I was just gonna say the little sack girl they had in the trailer looks just like one of my friends in her Burning Man photos, straight up.
1649460	1650980	I don't know if you saw the little sack girl.
1651180	1653340	She looks straight up like one of my friends at Burning Man.
1653780	1662100	Well, I always used to like, granted, like I didn't never really mess too much with the actual level creators and everything in those games.
1662140	1667260	Um, even though they're really, you know, cool, but I love playing like the single player campaigns and stuff.
1667260	1670540	So, I mean, I'm sure this would be great.
1671380	1674860	Uh, and I'm sorry guys, I'm just not going to have time to dive into everything.
1674860	1677540	So I'm just kind of doing a few like standouts for me here.
1677860	1682940	I thought that Hitman 3 trailer, like when, when it was going, I was like, Ooh, what game is this?
1682940	1683620	This looks neat.
1683820	1685300	And then they were like, it's Hitman 3.
1685300	1686700	And I was like, it's Hitman?
1686900	1687380	Really?
1687380	1691300	I don't, I usually pass on those games, but that looked, that was one of the better looking trailers.
1691300	1691860	I really thought.
1692260	1693420	That looked pretty exciting.
1693460	1698020	Um, the other one that I really liked too, that was pretty cool looking is, uh, Ghostwire Tokyo.
1698060	1699060	That looked really cool.
1700260	1703820	Where they're like fighting demons and stuff like that, that, that was pretty sweet.
1703820	1709980	And then, uh, Pragmata was another one that like really trippy, uh, I don't even know what it is.
1709980	1711580	It's some game from Capcom.
1711900	1712700	It looked pretty awesome.
1713100	1715020	I really liked Returnal.
1715060	1717260	That was the one with the, the woman in space.
1717300	1722020	Otherwise it was a little bit vague what that might be about, but I usually like space sci-fi games.
1722380	1726940	Um, it looked like it might be a little bit of a, a platformer type of game.
1726980	1728780	Uh, I'm kind of curious more about that.
1728780	1731740	So I'm curious to see some, uh, some, uh, gameplay on that.
1731980	1736780	The Square Enix game, Project Aethia, that looked hot, hot, hot.
1736780	1741500	I mean, again, we need to see more gameplay, but I was living for that character design.
1741660	1743500	The environments looked awesome.
1743540	1747140	That was a, I mean, again, it's, it was a little bit of a cryptic trailer.
1747140	1750220	Cause you don't really see what the game was, but I was, I was into that.
1750260	1752660	I don't know about you guys, but that was, that was great.
1753220	1756860	Is that there, that engine that they showed off like a long time ago?
1757100	1760700	Well, it's the luminous engine, which is what Final Fantasy 15 was built in.
1760940	1765580	It was not, I do not believe it was the one that they showed a couple E3s
1765580	1769700	ago that people were like, Oh, is this like the first look at Final Fantasy 16?
1769700	1770820	And they're not calling it that.
1771020	1773820	I don't think this project relates to that.
1775340	1776180	I think it's really cool.
1776260	1776540	Yeah.
1777340	1782060	Um, and then I also, of course, the game, the game of the show was stray.
1782940	1785620	That was the one where you're the cat and there was all the robots,
1785620	1786660	but you're playing as the cat.
1786820	1789180	And you know, I'm always here for a game where you're playing as the cat.
1789740	1790220	That's for sure.
1790540	1791340	That one looked good.
1791340	1794780	I also liked, it was that, uh, Kena Bridge of Spirits.
1795260	1796380	That one was pretty cool looking.
1796780	1797100	Yeah.
1797500	1804700	Um, and then, uh, was it, so, uh, Goodbye Volcano High looked interesting.
1804780	1808980	Um, I, it looks like I basically watching a cartoon.
1809500	1814060	Um, and then of course, uh, we have to talk about Bugsnax.
1814220	1817980	We do have to talk about Bugsnax cause that song was very catchy.
1818300	1822100	But when I hear that bug sack, bug snack song, all I can hear.
1822100	1827060	Cause I saw a tweet and now all I hear is butt sex when I hear that song,
1827220	1832900	instead of hearing bug snacks, but I think, but sex, but so like, then
1832900	1834100	now it's going to happen to you too.
1834260	1835380	Next time you hear that song.
1835380	1836060	So you're welcome.
1836060	1838860	I thought like when I first saw it, I was like, it was like a cloudy with a
1838860	1841220	chance of meatballs game and be like, what is this?
1841220	1847020	Cause it looks very similar to that, uh, premise, but then it gets weird.
1848020	1849580	So, you know, I don't know.
1849700	1853500	So overall, you know, trying to, trying to tie this up so we can move on to
1853500	1857460	other big announcements in the week overall, like, how did you feel about,
1857460	1858900	because this was a different format.
1858900	1861140	This was a different way of doing this information.
1861140	1863780	How did you feel about what Sony brought to the table this week?
1863780	1864180	Anybody?
1866620	1869700	It was good, except for, uh, Godfall.
1869700	1874220	I, that I can't get excited about that game, but everything else looks pretty cool.
1874940	1876260	I just wish there was more of it.
1877020	1880180	I kind of miss the, the, you know, overwhelming amount of
1880180	1882020	information during E3 week.
1883100	1885500	I kind of like, I really liked though.
1885500	1888740	And I think the best thing about this, which not a lot of people are talking
1888740	1893500	about is just that this was a bullshit free, I shouldn't say bullshit free,
1893860	1898220	but they really like the, the method of how they had to do this.
1898220	1902540	Not that I am, not that I'm saying COVID is a great thing by any means.
1902580	1903460	Absolutely not.
1903780	1908020	But PlayStation having to adjust things because of COVID, like this
1908020	1912500	was like the tightest, like bullshit free presentation I've ever seen them do.
1912740	1918820	It was such a contrast to the year that they only had four games to show at E3.
1918820	1921500	And they were moving people from room to room for some type of like
1921500	1923180	artistic experience or something.
1923380	1927140	Like this was just game, game, game, game, game, game, game.
1927420	1930540	And I, I think that's what a lot of people want to see.
1930540	1935020	And I, I kind of applaud their approach because I thought it was well done.
1935180	1937700	And I think even more than the Microsoft event, a couple of weeks
1937700	1940180	ago, we saw more gameplay.
1940180	1943580	We saw, you know, we didn't see it for every game, but we saw enough of a
1943580	1946580	taste of this is what the machine's actually going to look like in motion.
1946860	1948380	You know, and got a sense of that.
1948660	1953540	And so I, I, I kind of applaud it and I noticed, I don't know if you guys noticed,
1953540	1957540	but I certainly noticed a lot of the protagonists, a lot of the characters
1957540	1963180	in the games, we had a pretty welcoming, diverse lineup of characters in these
1963180	1968500	games that were featured and I was, I was very happy to see it, so I don't know.
1968500	1969140	Was it just me?
1969180	1971780	I thought there was a pretty good mix in there.
1972540	1973580	So, yeah, definitely.
1974580	1974980	All right.
1975180	1979500	Well, let's move on and talk about the PC gaming show.
1979540	1981860	Uh, so look, I didn't even watch.
1981900	1984180	I just read some of the headlines, but Loki, what were your
1984180	1985460	thoughts on the PC gaming show?
1986180	1989540	Um, I also didn't watch it too much or at all.
1989580	1992780	Um, I was just catching some of the different highlights that they had.
1992780	1995820	So, uh, one of the things I was excited about, it looks really
1995820	1998220	different than the last one was.
1998300	2001060	Um, Oh God, what is it?
2001100	2005140	It's a, I'm trying to find the, uh, a surgeon simulator too.
2005300	2008180	Um, so that one looks really weird.
2008180	2009220	It's co-op this time.
2009220	2015340	Plus there's an element of like, um, you can build your own surgery
2015340	2016540	rooms and stuff like that.
2016540	2019140	And then it looks like there's like almost like an adventure mode or
2019140	2022300	something like that, that you are solving puzzles with people, but
2022300	2023580	it's just all sorts of crazy.
2023820	2025420	So that looked pretty neat.
2025500	2031180	Um, some of the other stuff that they showed that looked interesting
2031180	2032660	that Proteus always looks good.
2032700	2035100	That's that kind of a retro looking shooter game.
2035500	2038900	Uh, I don't know.
2039460	2041500	Icarus kind of neat looking.
2042300	2048900	Um, it's, I don't know, a lot survival games, but yeah, Icarus, I guess
2048940	2052940	that's the one that was, Oh, so that's the one that's, uh, that was
2052940	2054580	by the folks that did DayZ.
2054900	2057780	So it's, it's a survival game where it's like you're on a different
2057780	2063900	planet, you land there and so, uh, neat looking, um, I don't know.
2063940	2065260	This is not a lot.
2065300	2069860	The PC game showcase was never one that I would always get excited about.
2070020	2072940	I guess one of the exciting things though, if you're a fan of the series
2072940	2077900	that Torchlight 3 was out on Steam that day, so that was a pretty cool announcement.
2078340	2081900	Um, other than that, I mean, I don't know.
2082060	2084700	I was excited about Torchlight 3, that's for sure.
2084700	2088300	But then I started seeing some of the like reception to it and some of the,
2088340	2092140	not that I want to listen to user reviews, but a lot of people are kind
2092180	2095100	of saying, boy, it kind of feels like it was a free to play game that
2095100	2098220	was shifted around a little bit, but I'm going to, I'm going to wait
2098220	2101140	until it's a little further on because it is in early access.
2101380	2103140	So let's cut it a little slack.
2103380	2106340	I want to see what it looks like a little further along, but generally
2106340	2107780	I'm excited about Torchlight 3.
2110900	2113060	So, yeah, so I don't know.
2113100	2118300	Um, like I said, I'm, I miss that the, the whole presentation for that.
2118540	2123780	Um, it's typically one that I do normally miss anyways, so I don't
2123780	2129580	know, not a huge deal for me, but I'm sure there's, there's a lot of stuff
2129580	2134300	out there for folks that are fans of PC gaming, I just, a lot of this stuff,
2134300	2136900	especially when it comes down to like some of these simulation games and
2136900	2142780	everything, I just don't play a lot of the strategies, same games, but I mean,
2142780	2147180	I know there's a certain simulator too I'm definitely excited for, especially
2147180	2152260	if they, I'm hoping that they get VR in that as well, um, and then I'm sure
2152260	2153940	that I'll come to console at some point.
2154660	2157420	Um, so yeah, we'll have to wait and see.
2158380	2161660	Did you actually watch the PC gaming thing or did you just kind of sift
2161660	2163100	through what was announced like I did?
2163300	2164660	I sifted through it.
2164780	2166980	Yeah, cause I was, I was kind of curious cause you know, that, that
2166980	2169860	show has never gotten a good review since the year it started.
2170060	2172780	So I was kind of curious if they were, I mean, I don't know, chat, did
2172780	2173980	anybody in chat take a look at it?
2173980	2175980	Cause I'm kind of curious about it.
2176300	2177060	I know, right?
2177060	2178780	Like it was, I totally forgot.
2179060	2184100	That's the problem with this year is that with not everything being this
2184100	2187900	week, I can't keep track of what's when, because it's all over the map.
2188300	2188860	You know what I mean?
2188860	2191460	It like, it used to be like, Oh, it's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
2191460	2192740	all day, we'll have some announcements.
2192740	2195220	It's kind of, it's kind of hard to stay on top of it.
2195220	2195740	That's for sure.
2196540	2196820	All right.
2196820	2197060	Yeah.
2197100	2198700	Proteus looks amazing.
2199260	2204020	That one is, that one's like kind of, it's a, imagine if you will, a Doom
2204020	2208340	running a Doom engine with like modern effects and lighting and everything.
2208340	2211140	So it looks pretty, pretty awesome in that sense.
2211340	2213660	It's got a really unique looking style to it.
2214100	2214380	Okay.
2214580	2217940	And then there was yet yet another, and I think it's a completely new game as
2217940	2222220	well, cause there's been a several that have come out or been announced already,
2222340	2226380	but I thought that there was a third rhythm shooter game that they had out
2226380	2231060	there now, so it was like three games, almost in the same genre that's brand new.
2231380	2235060	Um, I don't remember what that was called though, but I know there's
2235060	2236780	Was it Hellsinger?
2236780	2239300	Cause that's in our next batch of news is the Hellsinger.
2239300	2240420	No, not Hellsinger.
2240460	2243340	It was, um, it's something metal.
2243340	2245780	I don't remember what it's called, but there's, there's like three different
2245780	2248860	games that are kind of have that same mechanic to them now.
2249420	2251180	It's like everyone came up with the idea at the same time.
2251540	2254460	Well, let me move on into some of the other announcements from this week,
2254460	2257060	because there were a spattering of other things that were announced
2257060	2257980	during the week as well.
2258060	2262540	And one of the ones I definitely want to get into, uh, because I was really
2262540	2265300	excited to see this and it kind of came out of nowhere and I imagined dark
2265300	2268260	soccer has gotta be feeling some kind of way about this, but that is the
2268340	2272860	Alex Kidd in a Miracle World Deluxe or DX that they, uh, showed.
2272860	2274420	Did you, did you see this dark saga?
2274980	2275500	Yes, I did.
2275620	2276660	I'm pretty happy about it.
2276660	2277100	Me too.
2277100	2280620	Cause it looks like the wonder boy dragons trap thing that they did.
2281060	2285940	Um, where you can, and that was really good and you can switch really easily
2285940	2290220	with like a button in between the newer mode and the retro mode and so forth.
2290220	2292220	And I thought it looked so cool.
2292260	2293820	I'm, I'm very happy about this.
2295180	2296500	Yeah, I thought it looked really good.
2296500	2299660	I mean, we are definitely looking into, of course, picking it up.
2299660	2301180	So we'll see what happens.
2301460	2302100	Yeah, for sure.
2302100	2303300	I was really excited about that.
2303900	2307260	Um, let's see some other, uh, games that were announced as well.
2307540	2312420	Um, they talked more about blood stained and what that has in
2312420	2314420	store for it for the rest of 2020.
2314620	2316540	They're continuing development on that game.
2316900	2320780	Um, I think one other thing I want to mention, uh, for sure is the
2320780	2324340	arcade one up machines, because I know some people are getting into
2324340	2328300	collecting those and we know that they, you know, they're going to have a
2328340	2332340	pinball, we knew that was coming, but they unveiled a Marvel pinball
2332340	2333380	table that they're doing.
2333580	2335100	They're also doing a Ms.
2335100	2337460	Pac-Man cabinet, uh, and compilation.
2337740	2341620	They're also doing an X-Men versus street fighter cabinet, uh, that will
2341620	2344980	include Marvel versus street fighter and Marvel versus Capcom.
2345020	2346980	That's going to be a highly desirable one, I'm sure.
2347300	2350860	And they're doing a big buck Hunter cabinet for, you know, that crowd.
2351220	2353220	Um, that's actually pretty, uh, pretty cool.
2353220	2357740	Like the gun cabinets that, that opens the door for like, Hey, can
2357740	2361900	we get like a time crisis or can we get a house with a dead cabinet?
2361900	2363860	Point blank, point blank here.
2364020	2366420	I'll take a time crisis slash point blank game.
2366700	2369500	Um, and maybe those are a little bit more to emulate.
2369580	2371940	Um, but like, I'm surprised.
2371980	2375740	Well, I guess, you know, the stuff that they had in there, um, cause
2375900	2378740	Marvel or just Capcom, that's not CPS too, I don't believe.
2379380	2381180	Um, I don't know.
2381700	2384540	I'm excited to see like the different things that they're going to
2384540	2385980	have available for that stuff.
2385980	2390660	So, um, I'm curious more of these like unique cabinets that come out.
2391660	2395260	Um, I do want to quickly say this as well on the arcade one up front.
2395260	2399020	So y'all know that, um, my birthday, well, maybe you don't know, but my,
2399020	2401060	I'm to tell you, my birthday's coming up at the end of the month.
2401580	2403260	This year's been a little crazy.
2403260	2406820	So I said, you know what, I'm going to do something crazy for my birthday
2406820	2408300	and buy myself something stupid.
2408540	2409220	So guess what?
2409220	2412100	Y'all I bought the burger time cabinet.
2413020	2418380	So next time when we are able to get together in person, again, I will
2418380	2421780	have a burger time one up cabinet in that arcade one up cabinet in the house.
2421780	2423020	And I'm actually really psyched about it.
2423020	2424420	So there is that.
2425020	2425340	Yeah.
2425780	2426060	Cool.
2426380	2429820	Uh, it's a bad dudes, uh, cause it's like a data East karate champ.
2429860	2431260	Uh, and I think there's one other one.
2431260	2433620	So it's like a data East cabinet.
2433660	2433980	Yeah.
2434020	2435100	It's a bad dudes will be cool too.
2435540	2441580	Um, so, uh, anything else, uh, other announcements, uh, Loki, uh, that we
2441580	2444020	wanted to touch on from that list or should we move on?
2445380	2448420	Uh, I think we can probably move on.
2448740	2449020	All right.
2449020	2451380	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games
2451380	2454020	that we have been playing that we've been playing.
2454020	2456780	This week, uh, amongst all these announcements, dark soccer.
2456780	2457380	How was your gaming week?
2458820	2459460	Animal crossing.
2461180	2463500	What are your goals or like pattern?
2464780	2466860	Um, sorry, I didn't mean to cut off, but I'm just curious.
2466860	2470500	Like what, what do you, cause like I I've mentioned on the show before,
2470500	2473540	I'm getting to that point where I'm like, I feel like I'm running out
2473540	2474860	of things to do an animal crossing.
2474900	2478740	What, what do you kind of like, what is, what is your goals in animal crossing?
2478740	2480740	I guess, how do you keep yourself motivated in that game?
2481460	2482340	I don't have it.
2483220	2484660	I don't have any goals.
2484700	2487580	I just play and wander around because it's relaxing.
2488900	2489820	It was kind of a Zen thing.
2489900	2490180	Okay.
2490500	2492980	You don't, you don't have to have a goal for something to be fun.
2493420	2494540	No, I guess that's true.
2494540	2495060	I guess that's true.
2495060	2498780	I guess it's more like, you know, what, what motivates you to turn on the power
2498780	2503380	every day, but relaxing, escaping, I'm sure you do a lot of hanging with friends
2503380	2508500	and stuff, I mean, sometimes I just really prefer doing the run around and, you
2508500	2510820	know, being kind of by myself for a bit.
2511220	2511540	Yeah.
2512660	2513220	Yeah, that's nice.
2513620	2513900	Okay.
2514780	2517860	Uh, and then I'm sorry, you said Puzzled or what was the other game?
2517900	2520740	Oh no, um, uh, Patterned.
2522420	2526380	A bunch of new puzzles for Patterned got released, um, the Apple Arcade.
2526740	2531540	I mean, you can buy it, but I'm playing through Apple Arcade and I super like it.
2531540	2536460	It's very relaxing, gets my mind off of stuff and usually helps me regain some of
2536460	2538300	my focus when I'm having a really bad time.
2540300	2540660	Nice.
2541540	2542100	It's good.
2542300	2547340	I'll, I'll, I'll try to put it on camera for a little bit while y'all are talking,
2547340	2548740	but that's really all I've been playing.
2549420	2549700	Okay.
2550340	2554540	Um, then if that's it for Dark Sakura, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2555460	2561300	Uh, it was mainly Minecraft bedrock, um, still playing a lot on our
2561300	2562940	realm and doing a lot of stuff there.
2562940	2568060	So I ended up building an automatic slime farm, which involved me digging
2568060	2569940	out an entire chunk of space.
2569980	2573220	So that's 16 by 16 blocks.
2573260	2578900	And then I say it dug down at least, gosh, like 80.
2579220	2581300	So that took a very long time.
2581420	2584660	Plus when you constantly have slime spawning on you, that was not fun.
2584940	2586740	Uh, but I finished that today, so that was good.
2586820	2590540	And then, uh, just more kind of playing around with that with kids.
2590860	2598180	And then, uh, played a little bit of Orna this week and that's about it.
2599180	2603620	I have also been playing a crap ton of Orna, um, which of course we've talked
2603620	2606380	about the game many times on this show, but it's like the real world.
2606420	2611940	Uh, but it's very, very inspired by an APID RPG, but I finally got the 2 million
2611940	2615140	Orns it takes to up, uh, unlock one of the higher level classes.
2615540	2616700	Oh my God, that took forever.
2616700	2619700	And now I'm looking at like the next batch is like three and a half million.
2619700	2621860	And I'm just like, oh no.
2621860	2622700	Oh my God.
2622700	2626500	But at least, oh my God, it has made my survivability so much better.
2626820	2628540	Like I don't die in one hit anymore.
2628540	2630140	It takes at least three hits to kill me now.
2630540	2631060	So there's that.
2631300	2633820	Um, and then I've been to continuing in Xenoblade.
2633900	2636700	Uh, I'm probably about 10 hours in with Xenoblade, which means I've barely made
2636700	2638180	any progression cause that game is forever.
2638180	2641740	No, I'm, I'm in chapter five, uh, for anybody that knows that game and I'm,
2641740	2645460	I'm enjoying it and that's kind of like my, uh, you know, kind of like finding
2645460	2649020	your game to kind of like chill out to right now, like Xenoblade's been good
2649020	2653540	for that because, um, there's so many, like if I don't want to do the main
2653580	2656780	story, there's so many side quests and things to do.
2656780	2660940	I feel like I could play that game for like three minutes and still feel like I
2660940	2664500	did something because I did one of the side quests in the game, which a lot of
2664500	2666580	RPGs can't really claim that.
2666820	2670300	So that's one thing I'm finding that I really like about Xenoblade and why I
2670300	2673180	think the switch is a great system for that to be on.
2673460	2676860	Um, you know, despite all the weird releases that that game has had
2676860	2680820	previously, and now I understand a little better as well why it came out on the
2680820	2685700	3DS and I know I, I, I was more upset about the whole new 3DS result, 3DS
2685700	2689660	thing, but I understand a lot more now why that game made a good 3DS candidate.
2689660	2693580	So I will, I will concede that years later for what it's worth.
2694100	2698700	Um, and then otherwise I still am playing animal crossing because Alan is still
2698700	2701980	very like, you know, does a lot and I help him out and you know, like my
2701980	2703820	turnip prices were lower than his this morning.
2703820	2707260	So he came over, Oh, I, I, my, my price has spiked.
2707300	2709460	I, I finally was the popular girl this week.
2709460	2716100	Cause I had the four 70 turnip price and all I had to do was make a post on my
2716100	2716740	Facebook.
2717020	2719060	I didn't even get around to doing groups.
2719660	2723780	I had friends that I didn't even know played animal crossing that were like,
2723780	2724620	can I come sell?
2724780	2727900	Can, can, um, my, my, I didn't even see your post.
2727900	2730260	Dan told me, Oh yeah, cause Dan saw it.
2730300	2734620	Dan was the, Dan was the first person to comment that you went into what, what the
2734620	2736340	next day I could have sold for six 70.
2736420	2739900	Oh, that's always, it's so hard to determine.
2740420	2741900	It's like the stock market.
2741900	2742500	When do I buy?
2742500	2743060	When do I sell?
2743220	2743620	Yeah.
2743620	2744020	Right.
2744020	2750260	So, um, but yeah, I had, I had a lot of people come through, uh, to buy for that.
2750260	2755580	I just pretty much left my switch on and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't going
2755580	2757140	to be flooded with people.
2757380	2760140	And I think that's one reason I really try to make sure my friends would get
2760140	2763860	through first because like I was able to, like it was at most, I think like three
2763860	2765020	people were there at one point.
2765060	2767420	And I think that was actually when you were there, Jamie, like I think my buddy
2767740	2770540	Abra was there and one other might've showed up there when you were there.
2770540	2770980	And that was it.
2771020	2772900	Like, you know, that was, yeah.
2773460	2780380	So one of the things like when I open up for anything like that is I just flat out
2780380	2785180	say, um, you know, uh, cause you know, I've got my big group, all I do is say,
2785220	2788500	um, Send me a message and I'll let you in.
2788500	2793820	And I don't let more than four in at one time because I hate having it interrupted
2793820	2795020	when I'm in the middle of something.
2795140	2795460	Yeah.
2795860	2799820	And I know there's websites that facilitate that as well, but for, and I
2799820	2802460	could have used like Turnip Exchange or something, but I feel like there's
2802460	2807860	something more personal about like, Hey, message me and you know, that's, I don't,
2807860	2809780	I don't need a 99,000 bell tip.
2809820	2811700	I mean, I won't say no, but I don't need it.
2811700	2814020	I just, just have an excuse to say hi to me.
2814540	2815220	You know what I mean?
2816300	2817900	So, yeah.
2818460	2818820	All right.
2818860	2822300	Uh, as far as other games that I've been playing this week, um, you know, same,
2822300	2826580	same old, same old on the PC, been playing Final Fantasy 14 still.
2826580	2829820	And, uh, yeah, uh, just keeping myself entertained with that.
2829860	2833540	So we will move on to some longer news here.
2833540	2836380	So let's get to our first story tonight.
2836660	2837180	Uh, outside.
2837180	2840100	I mean, we've already talked a lot tonight, but our first maybe
2840100	2844300	non press conference story, uh, has to do with leaks, right?
2844300	2844660	Logie.
2845540	2845860	Yeah.
2845860	2849100	So, uh, I was actually going to mention too real quick since you brought up the
2849100	2855020	switch, um, so our switch at home, the SD card slot is jacked up.
2855300	2858380	Oh no, that's probably because it's because their design of how they
2858380	2860500	designed the whole system is really stupid.
2860820	2864580	They've got the board that has the micro SD card.
2864620	2868620	It's just, there's like a little connector that just held in by
2868620	2871260	pressure and doesn't snap in or anything.
2871260	2875500	And so it, that originally was loose and it was causing it to not work all the time.
2875500	2876660	Now it just doesn't work at all.
2876740	2880940	So I ordered replacements, at least it's only 20 bucks to fix it, but it's still
2880940	2884460	super annoying that I've had to repair so many things on this switch already.
2884900	2887500	Anyway, so that aside, uh, let's talk about leaks.
2887860	2894540	So, um, earlier this week, Star Wars squadrons had a wonderful little banner
2894540	2899660	that appeared on the Xbox store and, um, basically leaked that, Hey, there's
2899660	2901060	a new Star Wars game coming.
2901500	2906580	And of course, because of that now, uh, EA has announced that yes, there will be
2906620	2911540	a reveal trailer that's going to be coming at 8 PM Pacific time on June 15th.
2911980	2915700	So you can check that out, but it does look like it's going to be kind of, um,
2916340	2919060	uh, similar to the X-wing TIE fire series.
2919060	2922940	So I don't know if it's mainly like kind of a flight SIM game, but, uh, it looks
2922940	2926500	interesting, so I guess we'll check that out tomorrow when that comes out.
2927180	2933140	Um, and then also with that as well, there's a, there was a listing for UFC
2933140	2936700	four on the PlayStation four patch database.
2937100	2940780	Um, so apparently EA is having all sorts of trouble keeping
2940780	2943100	their secrets, uh, this week.
2943140	2946940	But I guess we'll expect some announcements soon.
2946940	2949980	They've got their EA play event, I think pretty soon.
2950340	2952900	Uh, that's supposed to be at the end of this week on the 18th.
2952900	2955220	So I guess we'll see all those announcements officially then.
2957220	2957820	All right.
2957820	2958100	Yeah.
2958100	2960380	I know the EA, the EA thing is coming up.
2960420	2963020	Uh, so yeah, more, more stuff in the next week.
2963180	2967060	But leaks are an inevitable part, inevitable part of E3, aren't they?
2967860	2968460	Yes.
2969060	2970620	It's almost like we're in real E3 again.
2971580	2971860	All right.
2971860	2973860	Except it's, it's faux E3 anyway.
2974140	2978180	Um, so, uh, before we move on to the next, uh, story, uh, Dark
2978180	2981180	Sakura, I know you've got work things going on tomorrow and I'm sorry.
2981180	2982700	You can't stay longer tonight.
2983020	2986580	Um, but I know you wanted to say good night and, uh, all that good stuff.
2986780	2989100	So thank you for being here as always.
2989140	2992100	Um, any parting words for our audience tonight?
2992820	2996020	Uh, just in a couple of weeks, I'm going to be back on a much
2996020	2997580	easier to deal with schedule.
2997980	3002860	Um, so this won't last too much longer that I have to pop out early.
3002860	3006060	And this is, I just have things I need to take care of before work tomorrow.
3006060	3007500	So sorry about it.
3007860	3008260	All right.
3008260	3008780	Sounds good.
3008780	3011340	It's always, it's always good to have you here, even if just for a little bit,
3011340	3014340	Dark Sakura, we look forward to, uh, uh, a couple of weeks and we
3014340	3015540	can keep you here until midnight.
3016300	3020780	Oh, trust me that that's coming, uh, right at the beginning of, uh, gosh, I
3020820	3022820	think it's actually starting next month.
3022940	3024980	I'll have to know it's starting August.
3024980	3028820	I'm so stupid, but still, it is what it is.
3028820	3029340	No worries.
3029420	3029820	No worries.
3030060	3030540	All right.
3031300	3033700	Well, be sure to say hello to our chatters because there's a lot of
3033700	3035060	kind words for you out there in chat.
3035060	3037380	So, um, take care of my friend and have a great night.
3038100	3038700	You too.
3038700	3039980	Love y'all everybody.
3039980	3040540	Bye.
3041260	3041540	All right.
3041540	3041940	Bye.
3042420	3042780	All right.
3043100	3047140	Um, so, uh, meanwhile, let me go to the next story here.
3047140	3052660	And, uh, the video, the video may look a little funky for you guys.
3052660	3055500	As soon as Dark Sakura disconnects, it's going to mess up my discord layout,
3055500	3058540	but just bear with me, I'll fix it as soon as I can, but I want to get to the
3058540	3062380	next story here that has to do with, unfortunately, some more Nintendo
3062380	3064180	accounts have been breached.
3064340	3068180	This is an addition to what we heard about before, but apparently another
3068380	3071700	140,000 accounts were breached in April.
3071900	3075660	Uh, Nintendo, of course, already earlier, uh, probably about a month ago, talked
3075660	3079540	about that 160,000 accounts were breached in the hack and they've added
3079540	3081540	another 140,000 to that total.
3081540	3084020	So that's about 300,000 accounts.
3084420	3088460	Um, although Nintendo is kind of trying to say now, well, that's only 1%
3088460	3090620	of all the Nintendo network users.
3091020	3091740	All right, whatever.
3092740	3098020	The moral of the story is whether you're part of this 1% or not, make
3098020	3099900	sure you change your Nintendo password.
3099900	3100860	That's probably a good idea.
3101060	3104500	Make sure your Nintendo password is not your bank password
3104540	3105820	or your email password.
3106020	3110260	Like you really should have a separate email for everything, but at least
3110260	3114180	your bank and your email, because without those two things, you're
3114180	3114820	going to be really unhappy.
3114820	3117340	Like I can live without Nintendo for a little bit while I get it fixed.
3117460	3118740	I can't live without the other two.
3118740	3121740	So just make sure you're using unique passwords there.
3122140	3123980	Um, so yeah, that's.
3124940	3128020	I did, but they, I'm not hearing maybe, maybe there's more details.
3128020	3131420	If I dig through this announcement, except it's in the Japanese, uh, sites,
3131420	3134900	I don't know, like what all the specifics are, but I'm not sure like
3134900	3137900	why they just suddenly found more.
3137900	3139100	Did you hear anything on that?
3139260	3139660	Loki?
3140700	3145060	Um, no, I don't know why they found more.
3145060	3148700	I know originally when they were talking about the original leaks, it was supposed
3148700	3150700	to be like a smaller subset of the users.
3151540	3157460	I don't know if it's because, you know, other sites were like compromised and
3157460	3161300	maybe they found that, you know, the passwords from that other
3161300	3164540	people use, I don't know how they may have figured it out, but.
3164940	3167540	It's weird that we're finding out more of these coming out.
3167540	3173100	So now, you know, 300,000 accounts total, and it's kind of ridiculous.
3173780	3177580	So I guess we'll, I guess we'll find out, or maybe they just won't tell us
3177580	3182060	how, how they figured that out, but I don't know, I don't like when it
3182060	3186060	trickles out like that, because that was kind of like that whole, um, you
3186060	3190820	know, Equifax stuff, it's like, oh yeah, it was only this many, or Facebook.
3191180	3194220	It was only like, it was only like half a billion.
3194260	3194660	Okay.
3194660	3197380	No, 1 billion or the Yahoo email.
3197380	3200420	Actually, it was everybody on the whole fucking site.
3200460	3202660	It was the whole goddamn site.
3203060	3203420	Anyway.
3203500	3207100	Uh, very good point by SGA 100 Matt in our chat room over at Twitch TV slash
3207100	3211700	VOG network as 200 Matt says, sign up for the two factor authentication word.
3212340	3216340	Two factor authentication is great and pretty much any bank.
3216860	3220620	I mean, maybe local banks don't use it, or I can't speak for every credit
3220620	3224860	union in the world, but just about every big bank is, has a two factor
3224860	3226500	auth available at this point.
3226700	3229980	Uh, and certainly all of the major email providers, uh, have two
3229980	3232780	factor auth and seriously use it.
3233060	3235100	Um, you'll, you'll thank me later.
3236340	3238340	Although I'm sure many people listening to this show are
3238340	3239300	already doing that, right?
3240260	3240980	I would hope so.
3241260	3241660	All right.
3241980	3244900	Um, now Jamie was going to talk about this, uh, for us, but we
3244900	3248500	ran along a little bit here, so I don't know, uh, I've heard a little,
3248660	3250100	I've heard a little bit about this Loki.
3250100	3252780	I'll try to hit on the big points here and you can help me fill in the gaps.
3253020	3257460	But, uh, Warner brothers interactive, who also is over rock steady,
3257460	3258900	which is a Batman Arkham.
3259140	3261740	And they're also over nether realm, which is mortal combat.
3261940	3263260	Apparently they're up for sale.
3263380	3265940	Um, I had no idea that they were something that was being put on the
3265940	3271740	market, but apparently the parent company of Warner AT&T is talking about a big
3271740	3277900	sale, uh, AT&T got Time Warner for 109 billion in 2018, this was a part of that.
3278140	3280580	Obviously Time Warner is much more than a game developer, right?
3280620	3281540	Uh, what, right?
3281540	3281740	Yeah.
3281860	3284540	How many movies have you seen with the Warner brothers logo in the beginning?
3284700	3286500	Or they're a big cable provider as well.
3286500	3286780	Right.
3286780	3288140	So they're a big, big company.
3288140	3289300	Games is one part of that.
3289780	3293620	Um, but investors have been saying, Hey, Warner, you need to sell off some of
3293620	3297780	your like non-core business, which for, I guess the games for whatever reason,
3297780	3301580	fall into that anyway, some of the suitors that have expressed interest.
3301860	3306060	The ones you would expect EA and blizzard, uh, Activision blizzard,
3306060	3310140	excuse me, uh, have expressed interest as well as take two entertainment, uh,
3310180	3313460	have all expressed interest in possibly buying the game division, but
3313500	3316580	nothing has been finalized yet.
3317100	3324740	So, um, apparently IPs that are movie IPs that tie into games.
3324980	3332060	So like the Batman IP, the Harry Potter IP are not inherently a part of the deal,
3332220	3334420	but they could still be part of licensing.
3334540	3338380	And if I'm not mistaken, EA has made Harry Potter games in the past.
3338740	3339220	They have.
3339220	3339540	Yeah.
3339580	3339900	Yeah.
3339900	3345100	So they can license that or work that out, but just because they buy Warner
3345100	3348260	doesn't mean they're going to automatically get Batman and Harry Potter
3348460	3351500	and the things that tie into the Warner movie side of things.
3351660	3355780	So, uh, these types of sales and business are complicated to say the least.
3357300	3357580	Yeah.
3357580	3362540	And I don't think it matters which studio purchases them because, um, I don't know
3362540	3367980	all big AAA studios nowadays are kind of shitty anyway, so I guess it doesn't
3367980	3373900	matter which, which one should we, you know, uh, which one should we pick?
3373940	3377540	Uh, well, it would just be a matter of how much are they allowed to
3377540	3379260	run independently as well, you know?
3379820	3380180	Right.
3380180	3380580	Yeah.
3380620	3388220	I mean, I guess if I was going to pick one of the three or the least, uh,
3388620	3393420	favorite of the three, I would say EA, um, only because of their track record of
3393420	3397540	taking studios and then closing them down after they've milked them to death.
3397860	3401780	So I would rather have, you know, Activision or take two in that sense.
3402020	3404540	Um, but who knows?
3404740	3406900	I'm laughing because I'm very happy that Mr.
3406900	3411820	Smoosh has a friend in who loves to wine when the microphone's hot every single
3411820	3412140	time.
3412140	3413780	Like she's always screaming in here.
3414260	3414700	Chat.
3414700	3415580	That's not smush.
3415620	3416540	That's not smush.
3417540	3418700	No, that's Stella.
3418740	3422420	You know, quite literally comes in the room and starts yelling all the time.
3422460	3424060	Not because she doesn't have food.
3424180	3428700	She literally has her, her kibble with a can of soft food on top of it.
3428700	3430740	So I don't know what she's complaining about.
3431620	3432660	And now she's going back to eat.
3432700	3435500	She just like, lets us know that, Hey, I'm in the room.
3435700	3437980	I'm, I'm unhappy for some reason.
3438020	3439100	Smoosh heard his name.
3439100	3440660	So Alan brought him in for cameo.
3440660	3440980	There you go.
3440980	3443700	That's why he didn't like getting picked up.
3445100	3445580	All right.
3445580	3449020	Uh, anyway, and the chat is lighting up smoosh, smoosh, smoosh.
3449220	3449660	Okay.
3449700	3451820	Uh, anyway, uh, let's move on.
3451860	3453260	Uh, Loki, what do you have for us next?
3454140	3454620	All right.
3454620	3459980	So, uh, the Sims players are holding virtual black lives matter rallies.
3460380	3467460	Um, so there's a modder and streamer at Daniel, uh, Ebonics Sims.
3467820	3469300	I can't pronounce the last name.
3469340	3472700	Uh, they started in, in game black lives matter rally.
3472860	3476780	Uh, apparently last weekend and it's been still going strong for a while.
3477180	3478340	Um, neat.
3478580	3481420	I mean, I guess everybody's been doing different types of things.
3481420	3485580	I remember we talked about NBA 2k last week with, um, giving out some of the
3485580	3487100	different skins and stuff for that.
3487300	3489220	There's people holding, holding protests and that.
3489220	3493260	So it's kind of cool to see people expressing themselves in different games.
3493300	3493740	Um,
3495660	3500780	man, this is, this is also where like your, your, um, player base is coming up
3501660	3505340	with this and it's not necessarily something like in the cases we were
3505340	3509020	talking about last week, you had publishers and developers that were, you
3509020	3511220	know, putting the message into the games, which is great.
3511420	3513100	This is something that's very organic.
3513100	3514580	That's grown out of the player base.
3514580	3518620	And so we see this in the Sims and you know, although I don't have an example
3518620	3522260	in front of me, I would be hard pressed to believe, uh, believe that this isn't
3522260	3526500	happening in games like world of Warcraft, final fantasy, actually, I feel like
3526500	3532740	there was a parade in final fantasy, um, at some point recently, um, yeah,
3532860	3536460	where I'm just trying to, I don't want to misappropriate it to this
3536460	3538340	particular movement when it's not.
3538740	3543260	Um, but we have seen that these, these games are capable of
3543260	3544580	that from their communities.
3544580	3549220	And so seeing that grow into, cause you know, uh, there's a lot of people
3549220	3554100	that don't, that they, they want to protest, but for whatever reason,
3554140	3556780	they're not able to physically be out there protesting.
3556780	3558780	And that could be because of physical needs.
3558980	3564500	That could be because of COBA, COBA, COVID and, uh, uh, immunocompetent.
3565140	3566220	Why can't I speak tonight?
3566220	3566820	I'm so sorry.
3567100	3570140	Uh, COVID and immunocompromised individuals and so forth.
3570300	3577620	So I feel like the digital, um, protests are a great way for people to kind
3577620	3582540	of participate without when they're not able to participate out there in
3582540	3583700	the real world, if that makes sense.
3584500	3584980	Yeah.
3585100	3585380	Yeah.
3585420	3588460	Everybody kind of has their own different ways of, you know,
3588460	3589980	the activism and so forth.
3589980	3594380	And, and certainly, you know, a, a, a movement like this, a protest in the
3594380	3596740	Sims, it gets people's attention.
3597180	3599740	Um, and lately here we are talking about it here.
3599740	3603100	It is a story running across all the gaming blogs this week.
3603100	3606260	You know, we talk about things that are on Twitter and on game blogs and so forth.
3606420	3608220	So it is succeeding in that element.
3608500	3610980	Um, so I think it's pretty cool to watch that stuff.
3611500	3613020	So, yeah.
3613140	3613460	All right.
3613940	3617580	Um, SSG100Matt says, I remember seeing stories of funerals for
3617580	3619460	players on wow and final fantasy.
3619660	3619980	Yeah.
3619980	3623940	And that's, you know, again, the community coming together for, you know, in this
3623940	3627100	case, the, the players that have deceased, but I'm sure there's a lot of, you know,
3627100	3631020	we, and we talked about this last week as well, too, people doing activism in
3631020	3635780	animal crossing, changing town flags, uh, doing screenshots of their own
3635780	3637420	types of activism and so forth.
3637420	3638980	You know, everybody's got their different way.
3639340	3642700	Um, so it's, it's interesting to see how video games, you know, again, if you want
3642700	3646940	to say video games are art, it's interesting to see how this art, this
3646940	3650100	movement is creating these new types of artistic expression.
3650740	3651700	Uh, and it's pretty cool.
3652380	3653660	So, all right.
3653820	3657940	And we will mention it later in the show as well, but, um, you know, we're still
3657940	3660900	kind of, cause this, this whole movement is far from over.
3661140	3664340	So please, uh, continue to pay attention to the bottom ticker bar.
3664340	3666260	We do have some resources there for you guys.
3666500	3669700	Uh, if you are interested in learning more about it, or you're interested in
3669700	3673460	making a donation, um, to the black lives matter movement, uh, there is some
3673460	3675460	information that scrolls on the bottom of the screen.
3675620	3679260	Also, we'll mention it again later in the show, but there's like 48 hours left or
3679260	3681220	something like that in that itch IO bundle.
3681380	3685420	So if you're like, what is like one easy thing I as a gamer can do right now?
3685580	3686980	Well, here's, here's a good start.
3687020	3690220	So there's the, I mean, don't, don't let that be your only thing, but here's a
3690220	3694100	good start is that itch IO bundle is still available, uh, for like 48 more
3694100	3694540	hours.
3694540	3697180	And probably I'm giving it too much time with that.
3697420	3698780	Uh, and that's a great thing.
3698780	3703860	And if you can spare it, don't just give $5 for like 1500 games.
3704020	3708060	See if you can at least double it, you know, 10 bucks, maybe you can do 20, 25.
3708180	3708780	Or do it.
3708780	3709540	I mean, it's great.
3709540	3713340	And if you've already purchased it, then you, um, you get those as well.
3713340	3718620	So, but like, Gosh, I can't imagine like all the things to play in that it's just
3718620	3719100	amazing.
3719900	3723700	Uh, hype mayhem in chat asks a good question that is worth bringing up.
3723980	3726140	And that is a, okay, stupid question time.
3726140	3729860	Isn't the whole point of a protest to make your stance known to politicians and
3729860	3734980	or police and in real life protest does that since it's visible, won't the in
3734980	3737900	game protests not be visible to politicians and cops?
3738180	3743140	It's not always just about that crowd of the politicians and the decision makers.
3743140	3746620	I mean, certainly that's an important part of it, but I think a big part of
3746620	3750340	that is also each other and that visibility with each other.
3750340	3752980	We talked a little bit about this last week.
3753220	3758660	Um, and that is that I think part of the importance of being an ally is being able
3758660	3764740	to talk to other people in positions of privilege about what is going on and why
3764740	3771460	they should care because black people generally are tired of having to do so.
3771780	3776660	So that's why allies need to step up and have those difficult conversations because
3776660	3781180	we are, uh, in a position with privilege to be able to do that.
3781460	3788300	So that being said, it's not just about police and politicians, it's about
3788860	3790540	spreading the message with each other.
3790900	3795100	And I think the protest that we see in these games are getting the attention.
3795100	3798580	I mean, we just mentioned it's all over video game blogs and all of this.
3798580	3803660	Now it is getting attention of a crowd that may otherwise not be paying enough
3803660	3810660	attention to what is going on or have the privilege to be able to, uh, I'm just,
3810660	3812220	I'm not paying attention to this.
3812260	3813900	This is just, this is too much.
3814220	3817180	I don't, I don't, I don't care about what's going on.
3817220	3821460	Well, the reason why, and you may not like that word privilege, but the reason why
3821460	3826020	we use that word is because you have the privilege to be able to do that.
3826940	3828620	You have the privilege to be able to turn it off.
3829540	3830860	Not everybody gets to turn it off.
3831380	3832020	And that's the point.
3832580	3833780	So something to think about.
3833980	3836740	So anyway, um, but I think, I think that was a very fair question.
3836740	3838340	And, uh, you know, there you go.
3838340	3838980	That's the answer.
3838980	3841380	It's about bringing visible, at least from my perspective, I'm sure other
3841380	3845300	folks will have answers as well, but it's about bringing visibility to each other
3845380	3850300	and not just those in a position of power, but real quickly, and I know when we get
3850300	3854020	to the next story, but, um, we are also in a day and age where more and more
3854020	3859900	politicians are gamers too, like we all know AOCs playing animal crossing
3859900	3861260	and stuff like that, right?
3861860	3865820	I'm sure she's not the only politician who happens to be a gamer and read game.
3866060	3871580	I know she's, we had that one politician who was, uh, fraudulently spending money
3871580	3877900	on steam, so you have all sorts of gamers out there in politics, but my point is,
3877900	3881620	is that, you know, as we spread the message to each other, it gets to the
3881620	3885380	decision makers, it gets to the politicians, because again, part of that
3885380	3890340	continued activism is saying something both at the ballot box and to your
3890340	3891140	representatives.
3891460	3892540	So there you go.
3892940	3896420	Um, and there's some, um, there's some good comments in chat that kind of follow
3896420	3897100	that as well.
3897220	3899220	Fifth dream today says it got publicity.
3899220	3901420	It's noticed by people who say the stuff on the web.
3901580	3902780	It could change minds.
3902980	3906380	Uh, quest buster says they keep the protest visible and continue to raise
3906380	3908580	awareness, which is still an important part of the message.
3908820	3911380	A few streamers even did black lives matter, charity streams.
3911380	3911580	Yeah.
3911980	3915220	So, and they, thank you for the kind words about me summing it up there.
3915460	3919860	I'm always like, God, I don't want to get this wrong, but I try to speak from here
3919860	3922620	where I can and, and usually that leads me to the right answer.
3923060	3923420	All right.
3924220	3924820	Let's move on.
3924820	3929940	We got more stories for you, uh, including, uh, news about a Skyrim mod.
3930180	3933100	That's going way beyond just being a mod anymore.
3933380	3938220	Um, so for Skyrim, uh, there is a mod out there called the forgotten city,
3938260	3939140	I believe is the name of it.
3939420	3942700	Uh, and it is a, a Skyrim mod that has, you know, gotten a lot of
3942700	3944540	achievements and praise and so forth.
3944860	3948260	Um, apparently it even won a writer's guild of America award.
3948260	3948900	I had no idea.
3948900	3949620	Pretty cool.
3949780	3950740	How did that happen?
3950780	3951740	I that's cool though.
3951940	3956340	Um, it is now being its own game, so it's no longer going to be like dependent on
3956340	3958980	Skyrim and it's going to launch this winter.
3959380	3962220	Um, so the forgotten city has gotten a lot of props and the Elder Scrolls
3962220	3965100	community for having its own rich story experience.
3965420	3969340	Um, The developer is modern storyteller.
3969340	3973060	The publisher is dear villagers, and they're talking about a mature
3973100	3974820	narrative driven game with this.
3975100	3979380	And the trailer actually debuted as part of the PC gaming show.
3979540	3982580	So I know we didn't discuss it earlier, but I think it's important to point out,
3982580	3989940	Hey, this was born as a, uh, mod for Skyrim, just like 50 shades of gray
3989940	3991700	was born from Twilight fanfic.
3991740	3992700	It's just like that, right?
3992700	3993060	Loki.
3994020	4000540	Um, let's just compare it to maybe like, um, you know, say Dota two or something
4000540	4005580	else, you know, I like that Loki's like, maybe that's not the comparison
4005580	4007060	we want to use right now.
4007100	4007500	Okay.
4007780	4008140	All right.
4008140	4008740	I'll give you that.
4008980	4014780	This is going to be good versus, you know, 50 shades of gray, which was terrible.
4014820	4015100	Okay.
4015100	4015380	Okay.
4015380	4015620	Okay.
4015780	4018780	Team fortress two was born of a quake mod.
4018780	4019060	All right.
4019060	4019660	How about that?
4019780	4020300	Much better.
4020300	4020980	Yeah, much better.
4020980	4021300	All right.
4023180	4023580	Okay.
4024740	4029700	Uh, but anyway, uh, it's, so here we have another example of a modded
4029700	4033220	game turning into its own game and, uh, yeah, it's going to be out this winter.
4033220	4034260	And I think that's pretty cool.
4035260	4038700	So, yeah, I'm very excited to check it out.
4039740	4040420	Me too.
4040460	4042940	Um, and hopefully no one takes an arrow to the knee in that game.
4043660	4044660	Cause that line's played out.
4045620	4046020	Yes.
4046500	4046780	Yes.
4046900	4048180	All right, let's move on.
4048220	4052380	Uh, so, uh, dark soccer was going to talk about this next story and I think I'm
4052380	4055500	going to save it for, cause that's not something that is necessarily time
4055500	4059260	sensitive, even though the story came out this week, uh, and she asked us to go
4059260	4061860	ahead and skip the classic game of the week this week, I don't know.
4061860	4064620	Are we, are we able to just like find something on the fly?
4064780	4065340	Low key.
4066780	4070780	Uh, unfortunately the news this week was so top heavy.
4071020	4073820	We weren't able to get to where dark soccer, uh, could do
4073820	4075020	her classic game of the week.
4075300	4078780	Um, so now we're in this odd predicament where we don't have a game of the week.
4078780	4080900	But then I feel like, how can we go a week on the show and
4080900	4082740	not do a classic game segment?
4082980	4084660	So we need to kind of pick something live.
4084700	4086060	I think that we haven't done before.
4086340	4087020	Can we do that?
4087860	4090100	Um, I mean, anything is possible.
4090100	4094260	Like I know at one time when we were doing classic game, uh, or I was
4094260	4097500	picking one, there was a lot of backup, like, Oh yeah, that'd be great.
4097500	4099420	Let's, let's save that for another day.
4099420	4100460	You know, type of things.
4100500	4103140	Uh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
4103140	4105900	You, you have mega Zeus in the background all night.
4105940	4106940	Well, now you have Pokemon.
4106940	4108260	Have we done mega Zeus?
4108380	4108860	Damn it.
4108860	4109700	We've done mega Zeus.
4109820	4110540	I thought we did.
4110540	4110940	Yeah.
4113140	4114380	It's, it's pretty close.
4114460	4120060	I mean, um, let me think, um, thinking on the fly here.
4120420	4124980	Uh, what about, and the other thing is I'm, we've had so many games.
4126060	4127460	I don't want to duplicate something.
4127580	4128180	You know what I mean?
4128180	4129980	Like we've picked so many games in the past.
4129980	4131460	I worry if I'm going to pick something, I'm going to duplicate it.
4131700	4135780	So I'm trying to think I'm using my brain and I'm trying to go way into
4135780	4140580	the archives of my brain, uh, and come up with a game, like maybe something
4140580	4144340	I've been playing on, um, ant stream or something.
4144420	4151860	Um, I have one and I know I do have one if you want to do it.
4152780	4153260	Okay.
4153300	4157060	Otherwise I actually see a suggestion in chat I could go with, to be honest.
4157300	4160220	Cause I don't think we've ever talked about this game and it is something
4160220	4161420	I could talk about memories for.
4162940	4163460	Okay.
4163660	4165180	Um, we can do that.
4165220	4168660	Um, I was going to pick Derby owners club.
4169540	4171900	Oh, Jamie will be so mad if we do that without her.
4172820	4173460	Yeah.
4173940	4175060	Yeah, that's a good pick.
4175100	4175300	All right.
4175300	4176700	I'm going to do the one that's chat picked.
4176700	4177020	Okay.
4177740	4177980	Okay.
4177980	4179340	So let me, wait, let me hurry up.
4179340	4182300	I'm going to bring up Safari here and find a YouTube clip of it real quick,
4182460	4184020	because this is a game I totally remember.
4184020	4185500	And somebody in the chat just picked this.
4185500	4188100	You said it in chat and I was like, oh hell yeah, that game.
4189300	4189620	Okay.
4189620	4190060	Hold on.
4190060	4191100	I'm trying to get to the YouTube.
4191660	4195780	Um, okay.
4195780	4200700	So this game I'm picking because I have memories of this game and I
4201020	4204420	have memories of this game and it was kind of like, um, it was kind of scary.
4204740	4207980	And, uh, I'm not sure all my memories of this game were necessarily good because
4207980	4211220	I remember being scared as hell by this game, because it was almost like a boo.
4211540	4212820	Uh, gotcha type of thing.
4213140	4218340	Uh, but the classic game I'm going to pick is Jurassic park on the super Nintendo.
4218900	4220300	So, oops.
4220380	4223100	And I hit the wrong button and now we don't have Safari.
4223540	4225940	Uh, gotta love doing it live here.
4225940	4226340	Okay.
4226900	4227980	Let me try this one more time.
4228980	4234780	So Jurassic park on the super Nintendo was a, there we go, was a game that was
4234780	4240180	made by, um, ocean, uh, and it was a tie-in to the, uh, of course the movie of the
4240180	4244780	same name and it was, it was interesting because it was like, you have this
4244820	4249460	overworld, like 2.5 D and for those watching on Twitch, you had this overworld
4249460	4253740	2.5 D mode, uh, where you're walking around and, uh, you know, trying to
4253980	4255220	make your way through the park.
4255220	4256900	Cause you're trying to escape and so forth.
4256900	4261540	Um, and then you had these segments of the game where you would actually go into
4262060	4268940	pens and it was actually like a first person game, which for the super Nintendo
4268940	4272180	at the time was very, very like rare.
4272180	4274300	You didn't see a lot of, cause you know, the super Nintendo was
4274300	4276060	all like Sprite driven graphics.
4276300	4282300	So this was kind of a hard thing to kind of drive on, um, a console, but first
4283140	4288660	person games, like this game came out in an era when like doom and Wolfenstein
4288660	4290540	and all that shit was the rage.
4290740	4295540	So, uh, I think this was kind of like to respond to that in some ways.
4295540	4298860	It's like, Hey, we can do a first person shooter as well, except it was with a
4298860	4302980	game like Jurassic park, which is almost kind of crazy in a weird, in a weird way.
4303420	4308220	Um, so anyway, this game came out in, uh, it was actually out in the UK first
4308220	4311740	and probably because it was developed, um, over there, uh, by ocean software.
4311780	4314700	Uh, and it was released on in October of 93.
4314940	4319020	Uh, but it came out here in North America just like weeks after that.
4319260	4322820	And then it actually came out in Japan, uh, in June the next year.
4322820	4324780	So it did see a worldwide release there.
4325100	4327380	Um, and you are playing as Dr.
4327380	4331660	Grant and you are, of course, the park is overrun by dinosaurs.
4331900	4335900	You have various weapons that you use to help combat the different dinosaurs.
4336220	4338620	Um, and then there's also ways that other characters in the
4338620	4339820	game can communicate with you.
4340140	4343020	Like you probably saw those little like polls and signs that people
4343020	4345420	were, uh, talking through and so forth.
4345820	4351580	Um, and then, yeah, the other like not so great things about this game, there
4351580	4353460	was no password feature in this game.
4353820	4359580	So if you couldn't beat this game in one sitting, then you were screwed.
4359700	4363220	Uh, it was, it was like Rygar on the NES in that fashion.
4363780	4366060	So yeah, there was no saves or any of that.
4366580	4372380	Um, and, um, yeah, you can, I'm sure if you really wanted to see somebody beat
4372380	4375740	this game, start to finish, there's playthroughs available now, I really want
4375740	4378620	somebody to get to the first person part of this, I was hoping they'd get to it.
4378620	4379020	Let me see.
4379020	4381660	I'm going to, uh, for those that are watching on Twitch, I'm going to do a
4381660	4383140	little hunt and pecking in this video here.
4383140	4383540	Oh, there we go.
4383540	4383860	There we go.
4383860	4384780	Cause I can see a little preview.
4385020	4385780	There we go.
4385940	4390740	Here's some of the scary first person stuff where now he's actually in one of
4390740	4395500	the, and you see, it's very inspired by like Wolfenstein 3D and then one of
4395500	4400180	those dinos comes out rawr is going to get you and you got to love how it's
4400180	4406380	like paired so that the story behind it is it's night vision goggles, but what
4406380	4412220	they're doing is that notice how it's a very small area of the screen relatively
4412220	4416620	compared to the other game footage we saw earlier, and that allows it to run
4416620	4420820	at an acceptable frame rate on the Super Nintendo, which still isn't great.
4421540	4426860	If you'll remember back to like the good old days of Wolfenstein 3D, that was one
4426860	4430820	of the options that they had screen size and like you could shrink that thing down
4430820	4434620	to like the size of a penny and, uh, it would run really fast because it's
4434620	4435620	rendering less area.
4435620	4437060	But yep, that's why.
4437140	4437340	Yeah.
4437380	4437900	Oh, boom.
4437940	4439060	Dinosaur came out of nowhere there.
4439580	4444540	So, yeah, no, it's very, that it's very like doom size down to like half the
4444540	4446300	screen so you can play it on an older machine.
4446540	4448900	That's what Jurassic Park looked like on the Super Nintendo.
4449220	4453220	Um, but, uh, it was cool because there was nothing like it on the Super Nintendo.
4453220	4457660	Like the only other thing I can think of was like Faceball 2000.
4458700	4461980	You remember when that game was getting a lot of hype and it's like, that game
4461980	4464140	was, that game was kind of fucking garbage.
4464300	4468980	Like the only reason people were into it was because it was first person.
4468980	4473620	And that was a new novel thing that was like just coming out in, in the nineties,
4473620	4477100	like around 94 when this game came out was right around when doom was
4477100	4478260	coming out and all of that.
4478500	4481260	So, Ooh, and there's, here's the sequence where you really do have night vision
4481260	4482780	goggles and everything is tinted green.
4482780	4483700	It's kind of a cool effect.
4484220	4489060	Uh, now one thing I think is, is notable about this as well is that, uh, it used
4489060	4492940	like, uh, like it was like a surround sound type of game.
4493180	4496420	Uh, and I remember that logo being on the screen when you would launch the game.
4496420	4500460	And it was because of these sequences, you could hear the dinosaurs moving on the
4500460	4504140	left channel or the right channel, which might not sound like a big deal in this
4504140	4509140	day and age, cause you know, now that's, but like again, in 94, like full stereo
4509140	4510700	in your games was a new thing.
4510900	4516300	And especially in these more intense sequences, if you will, um, where you are,
4516340	4522900	um, uh, in the first person mode, very different, by the way, I want to point
4522900	4525860	out the super Nintendo version of this game, very different than the Genesis
4525860	4526260	version.
4526420	4530900	They, they have hardly anything different developers, different ideas.
4531140	4534460	So I think it's a variable because like, you might be thinking, I played Jurassic
4534460	4536900	Park and it is nothing like what Rob is talking about.
4537060	4540420	That's because the super Nintendo and the Genesis games were very different.
4540460	4545140	I think the Genesis one was generally better received, but the super Nintendo,
4545140	4548100	I don't think it was really received well by critics because of some of these
4548100	4551940	drawbacks I've talked about already, but I also feel like it's one of those things.
4551940	4552820	Oh, it's going to play an ad.
4552820	4553860	So I'm just going to go back to that.
4553860	4558180	I was going to say, and I don't know if you noticed, but like it mentioned that
4558260	4560460	you can click the left or right mouse button.
4560460	4563860	That's because it supported the mouse that came with Mario Paint.
4563860	4565620	It did, it did support that.
4565620	4568620	And I was trying to, there was something about the super FX chip as well.
4568900	4573140	Um, Oh no, it, they were replicating the effects of the chip in the super
4573140	4574060	Nintendo hardware.
4574260	4576380	Uh, that's what they were saying about developing the game.
4576380	4581100	So it's this game, even though I don't think it was critically like well
4581100	4584580	received, I still feel like, like you look at chat, like, you know, since I
4584580	4588500	brought up this game, there's a lot of people in chat that are like, heck yeah,
4588540	4590340	this game, I remember this game.
4590500	4590940	Oh yeah.
4590940	4591420	And this stuff.
4591420	4595220	So I feel like maybe like a cult type of video game, like the people that played
4595220	4600460	it, remember it because it was so like, I mean, it tied into like, what was the
4600460	4604460	biggest movie of the decade, probably well, because Titanic was 99.
4604460	4608780	So maybe that, but, um, but still like it tied in not just to that nostalgia,
4608780	4612180	but like all these different type of things you weren't really seeing in other.
4613100	4617740	So I think for those reasons, it's notable as a classic game, especially
4617740	4620380	for something that we are completely pulling out of our ass tonight.
4620700	4624460	Um, well, thanks to the help of chat because as that, as that was the one
4624460	4627460	that Chad, that I was like, Oh yeah, I, I, uh, I forgot about that one.
4627460	4630460	So, um, yeah, that's a good pick.
4630660	4630980	Here it is.
4630980	4632020	Your classic game of the week.
4632500	4633260	Presto.
4633300	4639900	Uh, uh, Rob's choice with the help of chat, Jurassic park, uh, on the super Nintendo.
4640060	4643980	So we'll, we'll get the actual, uh, game that dark soccer had intended to do tonight.
4643980	4645180	We'll do that next week.
4645180	4646060	We'll roll that over.
4646380	4650100	Uh, fifth dream today in chat says pulled out of your Jurassic.
4650140	4651060	Yes, I like that.
4651100	4651940	Good, good, good.
4652460	4652820	All right.
4652820	4656340	Let's move on and do some rapid fire news.
4656380	4657140	Uh, Loki.
4658380	4658860	All right.
4658860	4664140	So let's talk a little bit about what's coming to game pass in the month of June.
4664500	4669180	So, uh, the first notable thing is that you're getting a lot of kingdom hearts.
4669780	4672900	Uh, so yes, get your, uh, kingdom hearts ready.
4672900	4674500	So you've got birth by sleep.
4675180	4692900	Um, kingdom hearts, one final mix re chain of memories, uh, 358 slash two days, uh, kingdom hearts to final mix birth by sleep, final mix recoded, uh, dream drop distance, HD birth by sleep and a fragmentary passage.
4693380	4696820	And then of course, uh, kingdom hearts X back cover.
4696860	4710740	And then along with kingdom hearts, uh, you're going to be getting, uh, Bard's tail remastered and Reese snarled on console and PC, uh, battle fleet Gothic armada two on PC.
4711060	4713020	Battle tech on PC.
4713500	4716980	Uh, it looks like dungeon of the endless on console and PC.
4717260	4720620	And then let's see, no man's sky on console and PC.
4720860	4724300	And finally, uh, throne breaker on console.
4724660	4726940	So those are all going to be out by the end of this week.
4727020	4727700	Real quick.
4727740	4736540	I knew I forgot something during my gaming week and I want to enhance on this a little bit because I had cut the story because I intended to talk about it during my gaming week and then forgot.
4736860	4742220	So, uh, one of the games, thanks to game pass, I played this week was I played no man's sky on Xbox.
4742500	4748660	And so did I end up playing no man's sky on the, on a third system for the third time?
4748940	4749900	Yes, I did.
4749940	4752500	So I've now, I bought the PlayStation four version.
4752700	4757100	I bought the PC version so I could play with Alan because cross play didn't exist back then.
4757380	4759820	But then the new, the big news this week, we have cross play now.
4760060	4761100	So I didn't have to do that.
4762300	4766260	And now I played the Xbox version just because I have game pass.
4766420	4767340	Why the fuck not?
4767460	4768820	Let's complete the trifecta.
4768940	4776740	So I did play on Xbox and I will say it was probably the worst of the three because, well, here's why, here's why.
4777340	4780060	I have a regular Xbox one.
4780780	4783180	Uh, I have a PlayStation four pro.
4783700	4791380	So to be fair, I imagine what I'm playing is the same thing that a regular PlayStation four user gets.
4791660	4799340	But with the little extra oomph in the pro, I'm seeing something a little better than the, and then of course my PC is in pretty good shape.
4799500	4800940	So what I see there is really good.
4800940	4802500	Like that's probably the best of all of them.
4802860	4805180	Um, so that's the only reason.
4805260	4809500	So if you have an Xbox one X, uh, you will probably have a completely different experience.
4809540	4810340	It wasn't bad.
4810340	4818860	Like again, if you don't have no man's sky on any of the other systems and you have game pass, should you skip it on Xbox?
4818860	4821420	Because I'm sitting here saying, no, get it.
4821460	4822700	It's still worth your time.
4822700	4824220	And it's a, it's a good game.
4824420	4832420	It's just, I definitely noticed like, Oh, the draw distance and some of the pop-ins not quite as fluid as the other systems I played this on.
4832580	4835180	But again, that is just because of my home setup.
4835420	4843620	If your home setup includes an Xbox one X or a regular PlayStation four or something, you are not going to have these same issues that I had.
4843740	4846380	So I say it's very well worth your time.
4846540	4848580	If you have game pass, you've never checked it out before.
4851820	4853940	So anyway, just, just wanted to throw that out there.
4855660	4859100	And then, um, in other news, we've got a new RPG maker coming.
4859100	4867140	So RPG maker MZ, uh, not much known about this yet, although there is a steam page for it.
4867180	4874300	And it's basically saying that, uh, it looks like there's the requirements for are a little bit more of substantial.
4874580	4884060	But other than that, don't really know, uh, what's exactly going to be involved with it, but, um, Oh, actually, no, there are some details on it.
4884060	4888580	So it looks like they just mentioned like different, I don't know.
4888580	4891340	A lot of this stuff mentions that they mentioned here.
4891340	4893140	It looks like kind of like all the other ones.
4893140	4901380	So they've got, you know, you can do a character generator, different events, map editor, uh, the usual trappings of a RPG maker.
4902060	4911900	I don't really, like I said, a lot of these, I couldn't, I couldn't tell you what the difference are between a lot of these different, um, uh, RPG maker programs.
4911900	4916580	But I'll be interesting to check it out and hopefully it comes out of sale and Humble Bundle or something like that.
4916620	4919180	Cause that's where I tend to buy all those and then never use them.
4921340	4921860	All right.
4922540	4922980	All right.
4922980	4925700	Let's talk a little bit about, um, arcade archives.
4925700	4936420	You know, the arcade archives is a lot of the, uh, well, some people out there going the main games available on Nintendo switch, but hello, they're in Maine because these are arcade cabinets and things in the eighties and nineties.
4936500	4943500	So a lot of these old games have been re-released for the switch and PlayStation four, um, through this series known as arcade archives.
4943660	4947380	Well, arcade archives released their 100th game this past week.
4947380	4949660	And that was sunset riders.
4949780	4951380	Uh, that's a, that's a big game.
4951380	4955940	People remember on the, uh, uh, on the arcades, uh, big Konami game.
4955940	4959620	It was one of those, uh, like, like Ninja turtles, basically the Cowboys.
4959940	4960140	Okay.
4960140	4962700	That's what sunset riders was interesting to know.
4962700	4964340	And maybe you guys, okay.
4964420	4971620	So you guys know, I will always sing a Swan song and pour one out for Microsoft game room.
4971660	4975140	Y'all remember, y'all remember my love for Microsoft game room on the X-Box three 60.
4975140	4980380	All the old, do you know what the last game was they did in Microsoft game room sunset, right?
4981180	4983020	It was, there's a reason why I brought that up.
4983220	4986500	So sunset riders is a landmark game in a couple of places here.
4986500	4990740	So, um, anyway, is the 100th arcade archives, uh, to be released.
4990940	5000980	And, uh, there's some cool, uh, little art that hamster, the company that's put it all together is put out hamsters also pointing out, Hey, there's official Nintendo releases and arcade archives.
5000980	5001380	That's true.
5001580	5006380	And still to this day, super Mario brothers versus is like one of the best selling Nintendo switch games.
5006620	5009740	You go to the top games that are released, that game is still there.
5010020	5012380	So that's, um, that's good.
5012380	5013980	They've been having a lot of success with that.
5013980	5019060	And I'm sure a lot of people will be, um, uh, looking for that, uh, sunset riders release as well.
5019660	5021780	I already mentioned this a little earlier in the show.
5021780	5022540	It's important.
5022540	5023660	I'm going to mention it again.
5023700	5033180	I do want to congratulate itch.io as their bundle for racial justice and equality has passed $6 million in donations.
5033180	5034180	That is incredible.
5034500	5040140	The indie developer scene has rallied together in a historic fashion.
5040140	5043300	Quite frankly, I don't know of any other bundle.
5044060	5048060	That's been this big or this monumentous.
5048100	5049900	I mean, think about $6 million.
5050100	5053700	That's two times what summer games done quick did in their record.
5053700	5062980	And that's not, that is a hugely important thing that I would never speak ill of at all, but I'm trying to express the volume of what is happening here at itch.io.
5062980	5070700	And that is like, they have, they have doubled over what a summer games done quick would make with this bundle, 1500 items and counting in this bundle.
5071060	5077820	Um, one of the games they just added that I played last night for a little bit, uh, Loki, this would have to be a fave of yours too.
5077980	5080660	Cat lateral damage is in the bundle.
5081540	5088740	So if nothing goes, if, if the 1499 other games don't speak to you, let that one speak.
5088740	5090780	But trust me, there's plenty in here that will speak to you.
5091060	5092940	Let that one do the talking.
5092940	5093580	Cause I love cat.
5093580	5095700	Like I have that like three times over.
5095700	5101820	So I, cause I have it on a PlayStation, which it supports VR by the way.
5102140	5105740	And, um, I have it on steam as well.
5105740	5107300	So cool.
5107900	5115860	Anyway, it ends Tuesday, uh, all the money being raised going for the NAACP legal defense and educational fund and the community bail fund.
5116180	5119380	Um, so go head over to itch.io.
5119380	5120500	It's you can't miss it.
5120500	5122260	It's right there, front and center on the page.
5122500	5130140	They're only asking $5 for it, but I bet you could spare 10, 15, maybe 20, uh, maybe more, who knows how you're feeling.
5130140	5136500	And, uh, you could check out all those games and support a great cause who knows, maybe we'll get it up to 7 million by Tuesday.
5136500	5136940	Who knows?
5136940	5137820	Anything's possible.
5138140	5140140	Um, six point eight already.
5140260	5146100	Is it really, I was going to say last night, it was cause I admittedly, I was like, Oh yeah, I definitely need to get on that.
5146100	5151260	So, uh, and a tweet reminded me like, Oh yeah, that's not going to be around forever and you want to support those causes.
5151260	5151820	So get on it.
5152060	5153060	So I did that.
5153100	5155380	Um, and it was already at like 6.3 million.
5155380	5160820	So, uh, I'm not surprised at all to hear, uh, it will probably hit seven by the time Tuesday comes around.
5160820	5161980	So don't forget y'all.
5162660	5163060	Okay.
5163580	5165460	Um, yeah.
5165500	5173460	Uh, quest buster in chat says the itch IO bundle also kept growing, which is amazing from 700 something games to more than a thousand.
5173780	5174100	Yeah.
5174100	5178660	Like it's just like the, again, the indie developers have rallied together in a way.
5178660	5180020	There's Celeste in there.
5180020	5183700	I mean, Celeste is an awesome game as well that you probably would know.
5183700	5193020	And then, uh, one that I see a screenshot for here that I've been, I forgot all about, but I was following them when they were developing the game was sky road, which is kind of like
5193020	5195740	an old school, uh, flight SIM action game.
5195740	5200380	And I don't know, there's just so much good content in there that you should really pick it up.
5200500	5204300	2064 read only memories got added recently into that bundle.
5204340	5206180	Um, there's, there's so much octodad.
5206220	5213500	So if you're like, if you, if you want to see where, um, uh, bug snacks comes from, octodad is in there.
5213700	5222780	Uh, there's there, unless you are absolutely broke and just, and on a budget and cannot afford anything extra about that, you, you really owe it to yourself.
5223060	5230700	To kick some money in and it support a good cause for one, but check out all of these amazing indie games, um, as a, as a two.
5231020	5232380	So, all right.
5232380	5235820	And yeah, questmaster also points out there are assets in there.
5235820	5239300	There are tools, tile sets, PDF, RPG books from Indies.
5239580	5243620	There are loops, musical loops that got my attention as well.
5244620	5246020	Hundreds of board games.
5247220	5249580	So, and all for a great cause.
5249660	5251060	So fantastic.
5251460	5251780	All right.
5251780	5254180	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5254180	5258420	Let's check out what's going to be coming to stores, uh, near you in the near future.
5258420	5266780	So Loki, how about the U S so we've got a persona for golden that's coming out on PC.
5267460	5269700	Uh, actually, I'm sorry that came out yesterday.
5270020	5271980	I think they, I think that was a surprise.
5271980	5272580	It's today.
5272620	5272860	Yeah.
5273460	5274540	So, um, okay.
5274580	5279660	So this week we've got Desperados three that's on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5279980	5285020	Uh, uh, disintegration on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5285380	5289020	We've got burnout paradise remastered on Nintendo switch.
5289420	5295180	And, uh, last but not least the last of us part two on PlayStation four.
5296060	5298060	Oh, we need to mention this at some point.
5298220	5300260	Um, because this is everywhere.
5300260	5303620	And for whatever reason, it didn't, like it didn't, it wasn't in a story
5303620	5305140	that we slotted in our show tonight.
5305460	5309060	But Bobby talked about this on his show tonight and I was like, oh yeah, this is
5309060	5310180	the thing I've been reading around on Twitter.
5310180	5310780	This is awesome.
5311020	5314100	Have you heard about the accessibility settings in the last of us too?
5314660	5317460	It's like, it's setting a new standard.
5317820	5322740	You, you can customize like everything in this game to meet your needs.
5322980	5326340	They actually, cause I saw, I don't know if Strelok still in chat, but I know he
5326340	5329980	was in there during Bobby black off and he was like a friend of mine actually
5329980	5334500	consulted on like a being able for a blind person to be able to play through
5334500	5337740	this game actually consulted so that somebody who's blind can play through
5337740	5338620	the last of us too.
5339060	5343180	That is the level of accessibility settings, where you want subtitles to
5343180	5345220	be, how big they are, how little they are.
5345420	5348660	Apparently you can do things with the difficulty where it's like, if jump
5348660	5352580	scares are going to be bad for you, you can like, and I'm like, Oh my God.
5352620	5359580	I, I consider myself somebody who's very fortunate to not usually have a need
5359580	5361300	for accessibility settings in many games.
5361540	5365660	But like to take out jump scares kind of does like, I don't like a lot of
5365660	5367300	horror games because of jump scares.
5367540	5371340	If I can get rid of that, it does make a game more accessible for me.
5371580	5373780	So like, I'm all about that.
5373820	5381140	So I just have to give a wink and a nod and a smile to how out
5381140	5383180	of their way it almost seems.
5383220	5386300	But then now that you see it, it's like, gosh, I hope this becomes the norm.
5386620	5389260	Uh, this company went with the accessibility features.
5389340	5392380	So a major, major props to the last of us part two for that.
5392660	5393940	So, all right.
5394500	5398020	Anyway, um, moving on to Japan and some of the releases over there.
5398780	5400980	We have a lot of releases this week on June 18th.
5400980	5403300	And I think it's because we've had a couple of weeks with no releases.
5403500	5404980	So we're finally getting caught up this week.
5405180	5408700	Um, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de Seven, uh, is coming out this
5408700	5410460	week from Koei Tecmo in Japan.
5410740	5415060	Uh, there's also Haruka Beyond the Stream of Time is also out as well.
5415340	5419580	Uh, we also have a game called Variable Barricade is out as well.
5419900	5421820	Mud Runner, American Wilds.
5422220	5426860	And, uh, this game, uh, we were talking about last week, the Namkot Collection,
5427140	5429940	which is Namco, but when they were publishing in Japan in the early
5429940	5430940	eighties, they were Namkot.
5431220	5432780	That is out in Japan this week.
5432780	5436540	That's the one with the DMAKE of Pac-Man Championship Edition, which will
5436540	5438260	come out in the States a little later.
5438500	5438940	I'm sorry.
5438940	5440980	I said those were all PlayStation 4 releases.
5440980	5442340	Those are actually Switch titles.
5442380	5442820	Sorry.
5442980	5443980	I got them switched up.
5444220	5448100	So those are all Switch titles, but I imagine, yeah, on PlayStation 4, we're
5448100	5449580	going to see a very similar story.
5449580	5449780	Yeah.
5449780	5451660	It's like all the same shit on PlayStation 4.
5451980	5455660	Um, however, uh, we also have, of course, the last of us part two also
5455660	5456900	releasing in Japan this week.
5456900	5460900	So there's that they have a special PlayStation 4 pro to go with that.
5461100	5463620	Cause we love our limited edition consoles there as well.
5463860	5464620	Uh, okay.
5464620	5466740	Namkot Collection is exclusive to Switch.
5466740	5468380	It is not in the PlayStation 4 releases.
5468380	5469780	So I'm glad I made that clarification.
5469780	5470260	Sorry guys.
5470820	5471140	All right.
5471180	5472140	Let's move on to the UK.
5472140	5472500	Loki.
5473620	5474020	All right.
5474020	5479420	So in the UK, we've got Desperados 3 coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox 1 and PC.
5479420	5482740	Uh, Disintegration is coming out on PC.
5483460	5491300	Uh, it looks like the, um, ease memory of Celceta on PlayStation 4 railway, uh,
5491300	5499620	railway empire on the Switch, Ion Fury on PlayStation 4 and the Switch, Minimoto
5499620	5505100	Racing X on PlayStation 4, Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Switch.
5505940	5510660	Uh, they're also getting the last of us a part two as well on PlayStation 4.
5512140	5512660	All right.
5512660	5516700	And apparently, yeah, I just noticed that the Pokemon sword and shield expansion
5516700	5518020	passes come out this week as well.
5518020	5519420	So, oh, yeah, that's right.
5519460	5520540	That's a big deal too.
5520580	5522820	And that would be Japan U S that's everywhere.
5523060	5523500	Yes.
5523540	5527660	Um, I know our, our pal friend of orange, Andrea here, Shane, who we talk about one
5527660	5529580	of my buddies, I play Final Fantasy 14 with a lot.
5529860	5531940	Um, I know he is getting geared up for that.
5532300	5535780	Uh, there's been a lot of events in the game with different shinies and I know on
5535780	5538460	his Twitter and he talks to me about this too, he's been collecting some of the
5538460	5542980	different, you know, Gigantamax and shinies and so forth, uh, in anticipation of the
5542980	5545380	DLC, which is apparently introducing some new Pokemon as well.
5545380	5551260	I think there's a Galarian Slowbro or the Evolve with Slowking.
5551340	5553020	One of those is getting a new Galarian form.
5553020	5556660	So there are some new Pokemon coming out, uh, as well in the DLC.
5556660	5557540	So that's pretty exciting.
5558420	5558780	All right.
5559020	5563100	This is the part of the show where we would open up the mailbag over at
5563100	5566300	participate at orange lounge, radio.com.
5566500	5573220	Although last I looked just before showtime, we didn't have any emails and
5573220	5578900	I'm checking now, uh, because sometimes we get them right at the top of the show.
5578900	5580020	No, none, none came in.
5580020	5582340	So everybody was feeling a little quiet this week.
5582340	5582900	That's okay.
5583140	5588220	Um, so participate at orange launch radio.com is the place to send your emails that
5588220	5589940	we will consider reading in a future week.
5590580	5593180	In the meantime, we have a few more news stories for you guys to talk about.
5593180	5593740	So Loki.
5594940	5595460	Yes.
5595540	5601260	So there is a game, um, that Ubisoft is developing called gods and monsters that
5601260	5604660	accidentally, uh, was uploaded to Stadia.
5605220	5609820	And apparently of course, you know, it's not finished yet.
5609820	5614900	So one of the things, um, once down and I guess, apparently you, you could play a
5614900	5619140	development build of the game and they had temporary character models and assets
5619420	5625100	that were from assassin's creed filling in as well, um, basically it says
5625100	5630420	regretfully on Thursday morning, we mistakenly made an E3 2019 demo version
5630420	5634260	of gods and monsters from Ubisoft available on Stadia store, and that was
5634260	5635820	not intended for the public to play.
5636220	5639180	A few hundred gamers were able to play it for less than 30 minutes.
5639180	5643500	We sincerely apologize to our partners at Ubisoft for this mistake.
5643940	5648740	And that was from, uh, Google, uh, that actually made that booboo there.
5649180	5651500	Um, interesting.
5651660	5657100	Um, it's kind of funny that, uh, you know, some of that stuff happens, but they
5657100	5662260	said that apparently though they're looking at, uh, they're going to probably
5662260	5665100	have, you know, announced some more details by the end of the summer.
5665140	5670660	So I guess we'll have to wait and see what is going on with that, but kind of
5670660	5674140	cool if you were one of the few hundred people that able to actually play that
5674140	5677900	for a short period of time, you know, what this whole thing kind of made me
5677900	5681900	think of though, especially with this being E3 week and all, you know, one of
5681900	5687140	the more memorable E3s, I think we all remember was that year when, um, now I
5687140	5690340	think, I think you, me and Jamie were all there in person that year.
5690340	5692220	I think it was 2005 or 2006.
5692580	5693740	No, maybe it was right after that.
5693740	5697660	Might've been one of the airport years, because I just remember that on the
5697660	5702500	Xbox 360, they did that whole E3 at home thing and you could download all these
5702500	5705380	demos on your 360 and they were 2006.
5705420	5706100	Was it 2006?
5706100	5706260	Okay.
5706260	5706780	It was that year.
5706780	5713300	So yeah, it was lost planet, MotoGP 6 and something else.
5713300	5713820	I don't remember.
5713860	5715060	That was really cool.
5715060	5718180	And a lot of us thought that was a really neat way to kind of participate
5718180	5719380	with the E3 experience.
5719700	5722940	Um, even if we couldn't actually be at E3 and so forth.
5723180	5729660	So my point is now that we live in this day and age of cloud streaming games and
5729660	5734380	being able to play games on the cloud and so forth, um, especially when it was noted
5734380	5737340	that, Hey, this game was supposed to be for developers.
5737340	5738220	It was like an internal thing.
5738220	5739940	It was supposed to be a preview, you know, that whole type of thing.
5739940	5740780	It's not done yet.
5740980	5744620	Like, why couldn't we roll demos out like this?
5744980	5746940	Like, they're never going to do that again.
5747020	5747660	Why?
5747660	5752220	And the reason for that is because they, what they'll do is they will show
5752340	5757700	gameplay footage that they'll stream gameplay footage that they have control
5757700	5759780	over because they can control the experience.
5759780	5764180	And then that way they can control weather so that you don't see bugs.
5764180	5767940	So you don't see, you know, partially developed gameplay.
5767980	5772620	Um, it, they have a way that they can control the narrative a lot easier than
5772620	5775660	if they were to develop demos to release on these platforms.
5775660	5780260	And unfortunately it, it takes more development time to put out these vertical
5780260	5782620	slice demos and stuff to show off.
5782980	5787380	It would be cool to see that, but I don't think we're going to see AAA publishers
5787380	5789740	doing this anytime soon at all.
5789780	5794180	Um, it's just not the way that they do business anymore, especially now that we
5794180	5798140	have these large scale, you know, streaming events, they can just stream
5798140	5802460	gameplay, get people hyped up about it and just go from there.
5802460	5806660	They, they don't need to have a demo put out there where people can pick it apart
5806660	5810740	and complain about how it's terrible because it's, you know, work in progress
5810740	5811540	and that type of stuff.
5811540	5813820	So, yeah, unfortunately we're never going to see that again.
5814020	5815820	Your, your answer is logical.
5815820	5816940	It makes complete sense.
5816940	5819140	Loki that being said, I don't like it.
5820220	5821060	Oh, I'm sorry.
5821060	5822980	That's just the way the industry is.
5823020	5823900	I don't like it either.
5823940	5824180	Yes.
5824220	5829260	I would like, I don't want to, I don't want to, I want to go back to what it was.
5829540	5830500	No, you're right.
5830500	5831020	You're right.
5831020	5837660	That it's, it's development time and deadlines for a demo that, uh, sometimes
5837660	5841620	is poorly received and ends up affecting the game as a result.
5841660	5845100	I get all that there, but there's that part of me and you know, people on Twitter
5845100	5849180	and a lot of gamers like this, why can't they just do a time demo of the real
5849180	5852900	product or why can't they do level one?
5852900	5855140	They don't have to, they don't have to tailor it that much.
5855140	5855660	Loki.
5856660	5861420	You can get that now with a lot of these games that go the whole, um, early access
5861420	5861740	route.
5861740	5866380	So, I mean, it's, there's, there's a lot of opportunity to play stuff early and
5866380	5869980	there's even, you know, for example, if these studios are willing to develop,
5870020	5873220	you know, Substantial demos for their products.
5873500	5880500	Um, one that I keep talking about, uh, was it that I have wishlets on steam.
5880500	5882100	And I was talking about it earlier this week.
5882100	5884940	I pointed out as well is a game called one dreamer.
5884940	5887300	They have one dream or prologue that you can go play for free.
5887500	5891860	It's the opening act for the game and gives you a really good idea of what it's
5891860	5892460	going to be like.
5892460	5895660	And I think it's a great game and definitely worth checking out.
5896060	5899860	Um, but that that's something that they've put together a demo for.
5899860	5900780	So I think it depends.
5900780	5905180	Like if I, a lot of indie developers want to get their, you know, games out there
5905180	5910340	and get, you know, the, um, word of mouth traveling about it.
5910460	5914460	And so they're more willing to spend the time, I think, to put together a vertical
5914460	5916620	slice of their game so that people can check it out.
5916620	5920580	But there's a lot of ways nowadays to be able to check out games in progress.
5920580	5926620	Whereas back in 2006 and 2005, you may have just had like a lot of the game
5926620	5928220	demo discs and stuff like that.
5928260	5932180	Um, you didn't really have games streaming or anything like that to be
5932180	5933780	able to see in progress stuff.
5933780	5939620	It was, you know, what showed up in a magazine or what you saw on IGN or
5939620	5943820	something like that during, uh, E3, or in this case, you were able to play a demo.
5943860	5947620	I wish they would still do more of that, but it's just not going to happen because
5948140	5952380	you know, they've had it bite them too many times where people even at E3 see
5952380	5957100	a demo of a game and they immediately judge a game by the demo, knowing that
5957100	5959100	it's not finished and they're like, well, it's terrible.
5959100	5960380	I'm not going to buy this, you know?
5960380	5965780	So, um, and then you also have the folks that like EA that want to sell you a demo
5965780	5970020	for, you know, 30 days in advance for monthly fees.
5970020	5976220	So I think we can count on indie game devs to, um, you know, fulfill that need
5976220	5978700	for us, but unfortunately we're not going to see that widespread.
5979060	5979820	Okay.
5979820	5983460	I will, and, and, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Rob has gone full of
5983460	5987420	Rook assault fair, but I will concede that point because this, this seems to
5987420	5991420	happen a lot in the industry where the AAA developers have gone and moved on.
5991420	5993340	The indie developers are here to save the day.
5993540	5994220	So you're right.
5994220	5998060	If I want to play some more demos, I bet there is a crap ton of indie stuff out
5998060	6000460	there that I need to be better about looking for and supporting.
6000460	6002900	So I think that's a good message to leave things on.
6003220	6005660	I I'm just still shocked with this technology, Logie.
6006180	6006460	All right.
6006740	6010660	Uh, the fifth dream today in our chat says, remember the PlayStation VR demo disc.
6010900	6011220	Yes.
6011220	6013180	I guess they've updated that several times too.
6013220	6013380	Yeah.
6013380	6014460	It's digital now.
6014500	6016180	There's like three different versions of it, right?
6016860	6017260	Yeah.
6017300	6019900	Well, it's digital now and they keep updating the titles in it.
6019900	6022620	Cause obviously, you know, some of the titles in there are pretty old.
6022980	6028020	So, um, you know, they keep updating that and that's cool that they have VR
6028060	6032140	demos that I understand because, you know, you're getting into VR, you know, you may
6032140	6035700	have like a brand new headset or something like that and you don't have anything to
6035700	6039020	play, which was the case when I was playing the demo stuff.
6039420	6043580	And it's so gave me a good idea of like what I wanted to purchase, but you know, I
6043580	6047260	think a lot of those titles they're already complete and now they're just putting out
6047260	6049460	something because they knew they needed this demo disc.
6049460	6052660	It's not necessarily to showcase an upcoming game.
6053060	6055460	Um, VR is also a challenging.
6055460	6055660	Yeah.
6056140	6061140	I was gonna say VR is also a challenging thing where you can't just show VR on
6061140	6061620	YouTube.
6062380	6066460	You know, VR is something you kind of have to experience to see what's going to be
6066460	6067140	right for you.
6067140	6071900	Like I, I could say, I could play B roll of Tetris effect and show you what a cool
6071900	6072940	game Tetris effect is.
6073340	6076300	I can't describe for you.
6076300	6082580	I can't show you, I can't explain to you why Tetris effect is better in VR.
6083780	6084660	You just have to try it.
6085100	6088300	And like the PS, the demo disc is a way for you to try it.
6088500	6091220	I, and I say Tetris effect just because that's a favorite VR game of mine.
6091220	6094620	I don't think it's actually on any of these demos, but, uh, you know, it's a lot
6094620	6098060	of these games that they, they, they need a demo because it's really, truly the only
6098060	6099900	way you can see what the game really is.
6101700	6101980	Yeah.
6101980	6106180	Or like a rez was another area X.
6106420	6106860	Hell yeah.
6106900	6107180	Yeah.
6107900	6112380	Well, not even area X, but like, um, there's something, you know, Hey, area X,
6112420	6113740	is that going to become a full game?
6114060	6115500	I'd like to know something about that.
6116460	6120900	I always, I was convinced that area X was the prototype for rez too, that for
6120900	6125300	whatever reason, uh, they didn't believe there'd be enough of a market for, which
6125300	6132100	is sad, but I, I, I full on think area X was a demo for a rez too, or a rez VR
6132100	6134980	project that that's as far as they got basically.
6135180	6139260	And for, they didn't, they didn't get to see the full one to fruition, which is
6139260	6141140	sad because I fricking love rez.
6141220	6142580	So, all right.
6143580	6146180	Anyhow, let's talk about other technologies.
6146220	6150740	Uh, this one coming to the Microsoft Xbox, although it's, it's weird to call
6150740	6153140	this a new technology, it's just kind of one of those, Oh, it's just, your
6153140	6154340	machines are getting smarter.
6154580	6159540	So basically, um, the 25 digit codes that you may be used to having bundled in with
6159540	6162700	your console are not going to necessarily be there anymore.
6162740	6165740	This is like when you buy a console that has games.
6165980	6172660	Like when I did finally buy Xbox one, I got the one terabyte Xbox one that came
6172660	6176700	with halo anniversary collection, but it was a digital copy of halo anniversary
6176700	6177020	collection.
6177020	6178540	I had to put it into 25 digit code.
6178940	6182860	What's going to happen now moving forward through a program called digital direct is
6182860	6184940	that it's just tied to your Xbox.
6185260	6188780	Your Xbox already knows that you're entitled to this software and it just
6188780	6194620	shows up in a new section under your, my library section on your Xbox and that the
6194620	6196060	game will be right there waiting for you.
6196380	6201020	The first time I was going to say, honestly, I just thought it was, cause I
6201020	6205100	know that they have the QR codes with the stuff before I was just thought it was
6205100	6207140	the phone app and QR codes.
6208740	6210060	That's a great way to do it.
6210060	6210180	Yeah.
6210180	6214700	Cause the queue they were using when Xbox one was first, first out, it was QR codes
6214700	6219140	because they all had connect cameras and you would hold the QR code and up in the
6219140	6220140	connect camera would scan it.
6220180	6223740	Well, they could just have, they have an Xbox app, so just use a QR scanner through
6223740	6224220	your phone.
6224460	6231660	I mean, really smart phones, but I, in some ways this is even better.
6231660	6236380	Cause there's no code in a QR form or otherwise there's no codes.
6236700	6242220	Um, so that is, uh, something, uh, that is going to be unleashed with the cyberpunk
6242220	6246060	2077 Xbox one X that's coming out.
6246060	6250380	Uh, I think it just came out even though the game itself is not out till September,
6250580	6253980	but the console already knows you're entitled to the game.
6254100	6257380	I wonder if they're doing that through like a Mac address range or something
6257380	6261500	where like they know certain consoles manufactured, uh, are just entitled to
6261500	6261740	this.
6261740	6263620	I'm not sure what it really is.
6263660	6264220	What is it?
6264260	6265660	It's preventing resale.
6266860	6274820	It's because smart folks will sell the game separately from the console or try
6274820	6277460	to resell that stuff because that, that happened a lot.
6277860	6279700	And so it's the prevent resale.
6280460	6281860	That is an Intel.
6281900	6282420	Wow.
6282540	6284220	Loki with the facts tonight.
6284420	6284980	I hate it.
6285060	6285340	All right.
6285340	6285780	No, just kidding.
6285940	6288460	Uh, Bobby and chat says it's tied to the serial number.
6288460	6289340	That makes sense as well.
6289460	6293020	I also wanted to read Bobby's comment cause I'm just now seeing this about the VR and
6293020	6293820	the demo and all that.
6293820	6297380	Bobby says, this is why I bring my VR gear to dragon con.
6297700	6299220	I can only show you the door.
6299260	6301020	It is up to you to walk through it.
6301220	6301700	And that's true.
6301740	6304460	I was not like completely sold on VR.
6304460	6309020	I was always kind of like, Oh, you know, my, my brain was still tied to nineties VR
6309060	6311700	lawnmower man shit, which was very different.
6312260	6314820	Like, remember when VR was big in the nineties, remember that?
6315260	6317940	And then like it kind of went away on the mind's eye stuff.
6318060	6318380	Yeah.
6318380	6319980	At least that's what they made us think it is.
6320540	6322580	My brain was still on that shit.
6322660	6324860	Like I, I remember, okay.
6325260	6326100	Storytelling time.
6326620	6332100	I remember for whatever weird reason, the store that I used to rent video games from
6332420	6335380	also had a VR headset that they rented.
6335700	6339220	It was, and it was a VR headset that would hook up to your super Nintendo.
6339900	6341580	All it fucking was you guys.
6342380	6345980	It was like these glasses you put on and the TV would just be right there in front of
6345980	6346500	your face.
6346740	6347500	That's all it was.
6347540	6349940	So that as you turned around, the TV was right there with you.
6350260	6352940	There was, there was no fucking VR in that thing at all.
6353300	6356060	And that Jurassic park game is one of the games that I played on it.
6356060	6357980	And that's why that game scared the shit out of me.
6358140	6360060	And it had the built in headphones on stuff too.
6360540	6364260	But anyway, my point is, is that my perception, my brain was still kind of
6364260	6364580	there.
6364900	6368780	And it wasn't until I really played it at dragon con when then Bobby was like, I
6368780	6370420	think Rob will like this.
6370420	6378220	And I think Rob will like this music game when then I was like, Oh, Oh, okay.
6378220	6378980	Yeah, I want this.
6380580	6386180	And that's, that's where VR kind of struggled sometimes because it's not, it's
6386180	6390620	not something I can just roll the VR footage and you will experience it the
6390660	6391300	same way.
6391540	6394460	You have to kind of actually check it out.
6395060	6395420	All right.
6395780	6399140	Uh, was that the Victor max or something?
6400540	6405020	Oh, the thing I, I played with from the video store in the nineties.
6405900	6406220	Yeah.
6406220	6410580	It says they'll run your super Nintendo and Sega Genesis games from a Victor or
6410580	6412940	a Victor max virtual reality headset.
6412980	6413860	That sounds right.
6414220	6414860	That sounds right.
6414900	6418060	Cause all it did, you just plugged whatever it was into the headset and then
6418140	6419140	while it played.
6420620	6421500	That sounds stupid.
6421820	6427900	It was, but, but again, you have to remember in the nineties, VR was a
6427900	6429500	fucking fad, right?
6429540	6430900	It was the lawnmower man.
6430900	6435500	It was all this, which was a, a novel by Stephen King that became a really shitty
6435500	6435900	movie.
6435900	6439820	And you know, it just, that was the stuff that was around in the nineties.
6439820	6443900	And so somebody in a room somewhere thought, how can we get in on VR?
6444020	6447820	What if we could make every super Nintendo game play like a VR game, but it's really
6447820	6451500	just a piece of shit headset that just puts a TV and Freddie will make billions.
6452100	6454100	So anyway, yeah.
6456660	6457420	All right, moving on.
6457420	6460820	So I don't know how we got from digital direct to stories about the lawnmower man,
6460820	6462420	but welcome to orange launch radio.
6462420	6463220	Hope you're enjoying the ride.
6463620	6464020	Okay.
6464060	6464940	Let's move on.
6465020	6465500	Loki.
6466860	6467540	All right.
6467540	6469340	So, uh, this is kind of cool.
6469380	6474940	So there's a brand new, um, basically it's, I think they have a crowd funding
6474980	6482300	campaign for a program called colors live, and it allows folks to, uh, paint on a
6482300	6488180	Nintendo switch, but what's unique about it though, is it has a unique pen that has
6488180	6489980	pressure sensitivity built into it.
6490020	6494140	Now you may be asking yourself, well, how the hell is that possible considering
6494140	6499100	that, you know, the touch screen on the Nintendo switch is not pressure sensitive.
6499340	6504060	Well, apparently the pen actually connects through your, um, headphone jack.
6504100	6510300	And it allows, it basically sends a sound signal to detect the pressure sense, the
6510300	6514860	pressure, uh, part of that, whereas the stylist would just, you know, detect
6514860	6516060	where you're tapping on the screen.
6516300	6519860	So with that together, it works pretty well to be able to actually,
6520180	6522140	uh, paint on your tablet.
6522540	6523500	So it's pretty cool.
6523500	6527300	So apparently they're going to, they have a Kickstarter for it right now.
6527780	6532780	Um, and apparently the bundle with the app and the pen together will run
6532780	6534100	$41.
6534580	6534900	Oh, wow.
6534940	6538900	Um, so yeah, or let's see here.
6538940	6541340	Apparently, I don't know if it's been done.
6541340	6543180	It says sign up to be notified.
6543260	6544500	Has this been completed yet?
6544900	6545540	Yes.
6545900	6548460	So apparently that, uh, just ended.
6548860	6553180	And of course they looks like they did hit their backing on that, but, uh,
6553180	6558660	colorslive.com if you're interested in checking that out now that it's, um, over.
6559100	6561660	But it's an interesting piece of tech though.
6561660	6565740	Um, I'm curious to see how that's going to work with, you know, whether
6565740	6569860	games are going to have there, but apparently this is a long live of, uh,
6569980	6573060	they've had other colors apps.
6573140	6577980	Um, so they had one out apparently back on the original DS, uh, they had one
6577980	6582780	for the 3DS called colors 3D, and now they have this colors live with this new pen.
6583100	6588660	So it'd be interesting to see, uh, what that looks like when it comes out.
6589060	6590020	I want to see it at retail.
6590020	6596620	Um, so, uh, this Nintendo switch does a lot of neat things and that we're
6596620	6600620	starting to hear like some of the things that it can kind of do with the technology
6600620	6604300	that, um, weren't always advertised.
6604300	6606500	And this is, I think one of those things was like, oh, it's this app that kind of
6606500	6610500	unlocks more things we're not used to seeing on the Nintendo switch and my brain
6610500	6613900	went to another game that I've been playing this week that I completely forgot
6613900	6615060	to talk about during my gaming week.
6615060	6618540	Cause I'm just, my brain's going a hundred miles an hour, but I need to
6619220	6622340	talk about clubhouse games because that came out on the Nintendo switch this past
6622340	6623780	week or the week before as well.
6624020	6625020	And so I've been playing that.
6625020	6628540	And the reason why I'm bringing it up now with this, uh, other art story, this talk
6628540	6631140	is about like different technologies that we're unlocking within the switch.
6631420	6635540	Did you know, because I didn't, that clubhouse games uses that, and I think
6635540	6641180	they call it mosaic technology where when you lie the switch down flat, it
6641180	6643100	creates a multi-screen experience.
6643980	6646780	I had no idea clubhouse games supported this, but it does.
6646780	6649420	How well does that work with like the switch light?
6649460	6650980	Does that work with the switch light?
6651220	6652620	I don't know yet.
6653100	6657020	I will answer that question next week because, uh, my husband has a switch
6657020	6659260	light and I keep meaning to try this with him.
6659260	6660220	I just haven't yet.
6660620	6665420	Um, however, that being said, one of the games that I know this does this in
6665420	6667300	clubhouse games is the slot car game.
6667700	6670460	So the slot car game is, you know, the old slot where you pull the trigger
6670460	6671540	and the car goes faster down.
6671580	6674740	So there's a lot of tracks that you just, you know, you have on the screen.
6674740	6677900	If you put two switches next to each other, it makes a track
6678140	6680060	that goes across both switches.
6680220	6681700	But here's the crazy part.
6682100	6687460	You could put one switch vertical, one switch horizontal, one switch vertical
6687460	6691220	under that, and like a weird, and it will make a track that goes across all the
6691220	6692420	screens and the way you've laid it out.
6693460	6694060	It's pretty cool.
6694060	6694660	That's rad.
6695220	6695860	That is rad.
6695940	6698940	And nobody, and I think very few people are talking about it because
6698940	6700340	it's in fucking clubhouse games.
6700860	6703220	Um, there is also the piano man.
6703220	6705540	I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I love clubhouse games.
6705540	6706820	I shouldn't like say, oh, it's just club.
6706820	6709300	Actually this, this game doesn't get enough credit.
6709460	6711700	It was bad-ass on the DS and it's bad-ass now.
6712100	6714820	So there's also, there's a piano thing.
6714980	6718380	So if you put, if you just play it, like you have it down, you can play
6718380	6719420	like you're playing a piano.
6719620	6724660	If you put another switch next to that, do now it's a two octave piano.
6725300	6727100	And you can play like, yeah.
6727100	6727620	Right.
6727820	6731180	So who knew the switch could even be a switch?
6731940	6734340	Who knew the switch could even do this, but you're right.
6734340	6737340	I have no idea how the switch light messes with that.
6737340	6739340	So I'll try to see if that still works.
6739980	6742060	Um, Comments and chat.
6742380	6745020	Uh, let's start to see you says, oh yeah, the wife and I have had
6745020	6746220	sessions of clubhouse games.
6746220	6747500	Just waiting on the fog nights.
6747500	6748540	Yeah, I know we need to get to that.
6748860	6751340	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says Mario party does this too.
6751340	6752660	I'm loving clubhouse games.
6752820	6754620	I probably already spent 10 hours on it.
6754620	6754900	Yeah.
6754900	6758100	I'm kicking myself for not bringing it up earlier, but I've been trying to
6758660	6760460	produce the show and be a star on it.
6760700	6762700	Um, all at the same time.
6762700	6764540	So sometimes I forget to talk about things.
6764780	6767100	Uh, but yeah, clubhouse games is, is cool.
6767100	6769500	And I love that it like, oh yeah, they, they're, they
6769500	6770940	aren't even advertising really.
6771180	6773300	I mean, it's probably out there on a blog somewhere, but that
6773300	6774820	the mosaic thing is in it.
6774820	6776180	And it's, it's bad-ass.
6776220	6777100	It's so cool.
6777380	6777780	So.
6778500	6779980	I'll have to find out about the switch light though.
6780500	6784580	Now real quick, because you know, you know, people in chat are asking
6784580	6786220	about the VR headset experience.
6786220	6791540	I was talking about, uh, bonds double 06 in chat said, um, my girlfriend
6791540	6794940	loved your rant, got her coming over to the PC to listen to your story.
6795460	6800020	Uh, my girlfriend wants to ask how let down you were that day that
6800020	6801300	I played the VR headset.
6801300	6803420	And my answer was I was 12.
6803420	6804540	It was fucking rad.
6804980	6806660	Like I wasn't let down.
6806980	6808180	I was a little bit like, well,
6808180	6811620	It's a time when like the virtual boy is like, oh my God, this is the future.
6811620	6815500	You know, it's like, I wish it was in color, but yeah.
6816340	6817420	It was still amazing.
6817420	6818900	Like I was 12 and I didn't care.
6819220	6824020	And now, now that I'm looking back on it, I'm like, you know, it was actually
6824020	6829900	kind of cool that like, cause my, my mom always would complain, like, you
6829900	6835700	know, that she wanted to watch TV, Rob, get off the TV so I can watch such and
6835700	6838420	such, or it was that more, she had a TV in her bedroom, so sometimes it was when
6838420	6841380	her and my dad wanted to watch something, get off the TV.
6841700	6842140	Right.
6842140	6846060	But if I had one of these little headsets, they could use the TV and I
6846060	6847500	could play a game on my little headset.
6848220	6851620	So, but again, we only, I, I never, you think I'm going to be able to
6851620	6855300	convince my mom to, can you buy me a $500 headset so you can play?
6855340	6856700	No, that wasn't going to fly.
6856860	6859980	So I only got to rent it like once or twice and play with it that way.
6859980	6860460	That was it.
6860900	6862420	So anyway.
6863660	6864060	All right.
6864420	6866940	Uh, Bobby says the mosaic thing was in all the trailers.
6866940	6868620	I guess I just completely overlooked.
6868900	6871300	I didn't, I didn't need the trailers.
6871860	6874940	When I heard Clubhouse Games was coming to Switch, I was like, sold.
6875700	6877180	I, I didn't need anything else.
6877220	6879140	So maybe that's why I just totally missed it.
6879180	6879580	I don't know.
6880020	6883940	Uh, Questbuster in chat says young me was floored when I tried out a VR rig
6883940	6887180	at Epcot, not by the weight of the headset or the giant cable that came
6887180	6888900	out the back, but by the experience.
6888980	6889380	Oh yeah.
6889460	6889820	You know?
6890180	6894580	And again, especially if you're younger, like you, technology is so much cooler.
6895180	6898420	Speaking of things we enjoyed when we were younger, and I think this is a good note
6898420	6901660	to end on tonight, guess what's coming back in mobile form.
6901700	6902260	That's right.
6902500	6903500	Neopets.
6904900	6908740	Neopets that started in 1999.
6909460	6911900	Neopets is older than this show.
6911940	6913100	And that's saying something.
6914740	6916540	Neopads I never got in on.
6917020	6920900	So Neil will remember in the early days of OLR Loki, like Jamie and I were
6920900	6925180	playing this shit all the time and talking about our stupid Neopets on the show.
6925220	6925740	How was your game?
6925740	6927100	I completely blocked that out from my brain.
6927740	6931660	Well, let me remind you, my friend, we used to talk about that during our
6931660	6936700	gaming weeks, all that fucking Neopets shit and, uh, Neopets it's still around.
6936700	6937580	It never went away.
6937580	6943660	It's always still been there, but now just now in the year 2020, Neopets
6943700	6944900	put out a tweet this week.
6944940	6949060	Now you can do Neopets on desktop and on mobile.
6949300	6955020	So if you, uh, abandoned your Neopet in 1999 and haven't fed it in what, 20
6955020	6960020	years, uh, good news is your Neopet is not dead, uh, your Neopet will still be
6960020	6963660	there, uh, and you can check on it in a mobile form if that is something,
6963980	6965860	um, that you're interested in doing.
6966060	6969500	This whole thing was really just a ruse for me to ask the chat.
6969980	6971700	I'm going to ask yourself out.
6971780	6974420	I want to know who's still playing Neopets out yourself.
6974820	6976340	Who's still playing Neopets?
6977220	6979620	Uh, bonds double 06 fesses up.
6979660	6980940	I still play Neopets.
6980980	6982420	I got the update for mobile.
6982860	6986300	Um, let's see what other comments, uh, orange, right.
6986300	6990020	Says probably haven't fed my Neopet in about a decade or so pixel pocket says,
6990020	6993500	I mean, you could play it on your phone, but it wasn't optimized for it in any way.
6994460	6995420	But you knew that.
6995420	6997380	So you tried wink.
6997460	6997820	All right.
6997820	7002380	Uh, let's see a fifth dream today said I tried a month or so ago, but
7002380	7003940	I can't get into my account.
7004460	7006340	Um, so I love it.
7006420	7012180	You guys are, uh, I seriously, I think the email address that was tied to my Neopets
7012180	7017580	account, I don't use anymore, so I don't even know if I could get into my Neopets
7017580	7019020	account even if I wanted to.
7019420	7020300	So there's that.
7021300	7023140	What in the world is my cat doing?
7023140	7026900	I'm sorry you guys, but he's got his eye on something.
7026900	7028220	He's jumping up on the counter.
7029340	7029700	I don't know.
7029700	7032700	Hopefully he must've seen other daddy coming in here and thinking at that
7032700	7036220	minute was feeding time, even though he's already eaten, but I'm just, I'm
7036220	7036940	keeping an eye on him.
7036940	7037220	All right.
7037220	7037900	Anyway, sorry guys.
7038860	7042580	So this is the part of the show where we open up our listener round table.
7042580	7045820	And if you have any questions or comments or you want me to tell more VR headset
7045820	7049020	stories from the nineties, I certainly will, uh, speak up in our chat room over
7049020	7053380	at twitch.tv slash vog network while we wait and gather some questions or
7053380	7053980	comments.
7054060	7057820	Uh, I'm going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories like I usually do at
7057820	7058220	this point.
7059220	7061700	Um, I don't really have too much.
7061740	7066620	I remember we had talked about, um, the PlayStation five and how you wish there
7066660	7067740	was more color options.
7067740	7070780	And I said that there's probably a skinning company already doing it.
7070980	7074740	Well, I already see that dbrand has a PS five listed on their site with skin
7074740	7075300	options.
7076500	7079140	You know, there's going to be third party stuff out the wazoo.
7079180	7080380	Anyway, there's certainly that.
7080380	7082780	Yeah, we already got some comments in chat.
7082780	7083140	Love it.
7083460	7084580	Hype mayhem says Rob.
7084620	7084860	Okay.
7084860	7086900	So I grabbed that samurai showdown collection.
7086900	7089380	That's free on Epic and I've been playing that.
7089380	7091180	I love it.
7091220	7094740	If only for samurai showdown four, which I played the shit out of while in
7094740	7097620	college, did you and Loki get that freebie on Epic?
7097780	7098900	What are your thoughts on it?
7099180	7100580	I did grab the freebie.
7100860	7101740	I haven't played it yet.
7101740	7104620	Sorry, but I'm looking forward to doing so because I don't remember samurai
7104620	7106820	showdown four as much, but I definitely remember the first two.
7107300	7108820	Um, so I will check that out.
7108820	7110580	Loki, did you grab that free on Epic store?
7110740	7111420	So I think there's that.
7111420	7112340	And there's the freebies.
7112340	7112620	Yeah.
7112940	7113500	Well, there's that.
7113500	7114420	There's art or not.
7115060	7116100	Yeah, for sure.
7116380	7119540	Uh, and you know, we, we love our, don't forget.
7119540	7122940	Not only is there that samurai showdown collection, but if you're a Twitch, uh,
7122980	7126380	prime person, there's Neo Geo stuff at the wazoo.
7126380	7128020	That's free on Twitch prime right now.
7128020	7129100	If you use the Twitch app.
7129380	7130980	So don't, here's your reminder.
7130980	7134060	If you're sitting there right now, if you haven't claimed those games, get on it.
7134380	7137780	Uh, and, um, if you want to say thanks, you could always toss your
7137780	7139220	free sub over to VOG network.
7139260	7140300	We definitely appreciate that.
7140340	7143780	Uh, and you get access to our video archives with all the old shows.
7143980	7147500	Of course, the audio content is free as it has been for the last 18 years.
7148340	7152340	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is asking favorite clubhouse games.
7152660	7153540	Great question.
7153820	7158700	Uh, my favorite, probably speed, honestly, because I remember playing
7158700	7161620	that when I was a kid and I don't think I've played that since I was a kid.
7161820	7165580	So the fact that like speed of all things is in clubhouse
7165580	7166620	games is pretty awesome.
7166900	7170180	Now, you know, with 51 games, there's going to be some stinkers though.
7170660	7177020	Uh, and like Loki, one of the 51 games in clubhouse games is war.
7177700	7179180	Do you know what game war is?
7180180	7181460	Have you ever played war?
7182020	7182900	Yeah, I've played war.
7183500	7183740	Yeah.
7183780	7186620	It's just turn over the card and the highest card wins.
7186780	7187420	That's war.
7188620	7189780	Like we got to pad this out.
7189780	7194260	Let's pad this out with some, they, they try, they, what they do.
7194260	7195940	And I've never seen war played this way.
7195940	7197740	I've seen war played two ways.
7197780	7200220	I've seen cut the deck and play it that way.
7200580	7205020	I've seen spread out an ocean and each person picks a card from
7205020	7206420	the ocean and does it that way.
7206420	7212220	This one, hold on, y'all, you put three cards face down in front of you and you
7212220	7214340	pick which of the three cards you're going to turn over.
7215900	7218180	Ooh, that's so thrilling.
7218580	7219260	I know, right?
7219260	7223580	So anyway, I, I don't want to dwell on the negative cause I love clubhouse games, but
7223580	7227300	that was definitely one of the games that made me go Nintendo, please.
7227340	7228860	Um, yacht dice.
7229220	7232300	Cause it's just yacht, it's Yahtzee, but it was originally, you know, yacht dice.
7232340	7236860	Uh, and the six, the six ball, the battle balls, what did, what did it call it?
7236860	7238500	Six ball puzzle, something like that.
7239180	7239860	I like that one too.
7241140	7242300	Um, let's see.
7242340	7243780	Oh, and a last card.
7243820	7245900	That's just Uno, but under a different name.
7246060	7250620	I did, I forced myself to learn how to play president because I was like, is
7250620	7251740	this the game I thought it was?
7251740	7254260	And it wasn't, but I learned a new game.
7254500	7255580	So that's kind of cool.
7255620	7258220	Like it's kind of fun to learn a new game on clubhouse games.
7258260	7259020	So there was that.
7259020	7261180	Uh, let's see, going to some comments from chat.
7261220	7263580	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, yeah, I hate war.
7263580	7265980	I played it enough to get the gold trophy and then turned it off.
7266300	7267780	Sevens is my jam.
7267820	7269900	Dark Tetsuya says Renegade is my jam.
7270420	7275220	Um, Orange Wright says, even the fun fact says that traditional war isn't even a game.
7276060	7280620	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, one of the things that's interesting about Klondike is that
7280620	7285060	it will tell you immediately when you lose, not when you've gone through all the
7285060	7288380	cards, but it will tell you immediately when you lose.
7289340	7291740	So you can just undo once and try something different.
7291980	7292260	Yeah.
7292820	7297420	And, uh, Bobby Blackwell says, president is kind of like great Dow multi.
7297660	7301860	You know, there are so many card games out there that you probably know
7301860	7303780	under a different house variation.
7304180	7305420	Um, this was funny.
7305460	7305700	Okay.
7305700	7307060	So I'm going to tell a work story.
7307660	7311500	So we were talking about games, um, because it was like our team building
7311500	7314300	call and we were talking about like, what's a game that you have fond memories of.
7315220	7319780	And one of the people on the call brought up that her family
7319780	7321660	really liked to play BS.
7322260	7322700	Right.
7322980	7324100	Have you ever played that card game?
7324220	7328900	Bullshit, basically where you say you put the cards face down and you're like,
7328940	7333860	I am playing two sevens and somebody says bullshit and you turn them over.
7334180	7337740	And if you didn't actually play two sevens, you have to take all the cards
7337740	7338460	that have been laid down.
7338700	7340900	And if somebody miscalled you on it, they have to take all the cards.
7340900	7341060	Right.
7341060	7344260	So you've probably played this game at some point, but she said, because they
7344260	7350380	didn't want to say bullshit in front of the kids, they call the game blue salmon
7352060	7352580	or something like that.
7352740	7353380	I think that's what it was.
7353380	7355700	It was a blue salmon or something like that.
7355820	7357180	So that's, that's what they play.
7357180	7358260	They play blue salmon.
7358300	7364020	And so, and that's what they either blue salmon or was it, was it blue?
7364940	7365500	I don't know.
7365660	7367700	Uh, something badgers, I don't know.
7367900	7371780	But anyway, so people come up with all these different names and come to think
7371780	7376420	of it, I even remember years ago when I was in church.
7376420	7377660	So this was a long time ago.
7377660	7378020	Okay.
7378380	7382780	Uh, we played bullshit, but it was called, I don't know, or no, it was called, I
7382780	7384700	don't, I don't think so.
7384780	7385300	Or something like that.
7385300	7389220	You just, you say, I don't think so is what you would say, uh, instead of bullshit.
7389820	7391900	So anyway, yeah.
7391940	7393940	Uh, SG-100 Matt says bull spit.
7394100	7394460	Yep.
7394700	7394980	Yep.
7394980	7395540	Bull spit.
7395620	7395860	Yeah.
7396540	7397260	Boy scout.
7398620	7399420	So there it is.
7400420	7401140	How funny.
7401180	7403060	SG-100 Matt says, that's what my grandmother told me.
7403060	7404060	It was bull spit.
7406660	7409660	That's a really, I love the stories we get told as kids.
7409700	7410140	All right.
7410380	7412180	Any lies you're telling your children, Loki?
7414940	7415620	I don't know.
7417140	7417780	Probably.
7417980	7418460	All right.
7418660	7422620	Oh, Bobby Blackwell says, I doubt it was the name of it in the DS games.
7422620	7423100	That's right.
7423260	7424900	Oh, as that said, the broccoli farm.
7424900	7426660	Well, the listeners with the receipts.
7428660	7429460	Well, I love it.
7430060	7430580	All right.
7430860	7433380	Uh, Loki, any other last minute stories?
7434140	7438060	Yes, this is, uh, it's interesting.
7438380	7444460	So I don't know if you remember back to the Simpsons where there was a gag where I think
7444460	7451460	Bart was playing a, a golf game called a Lee Corrello's putting challenge is like some
7451460	7452780	really terrible game.
7452780	7454980	Well, apparently someone's decided to make that a real thing.
7455540	7461740	And so you can now play that for free and it's, uh, so, uh, it's pretty funny.
7461740	7465140	They actually put together the game using sound clips from the show.
7467060	7470060	I love that somebody went to the links to actually make it a real thing.
7470060	7470580	That's great.
7470580	7472220	The Simpsons predicting the future yet again.
7473060	7473620	Oh, I'm sorry.
7473660	7475460	Yeah, it looks like Martin was playing that.
7475460	7480340	So, um, that's funny, but neat.
7480940	7481460	That's it.
7481820	7482380	All right.
7482900	7484780	Well, I think that's it from our chat room as well.
7484780	7487260	So this is the part of the show where we're going to wrap things up.
7487580	7490580	Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show this week or listening
7490580	7492660	to us live, however you consume orange launch radio.

7512180	7514260	Uh, we will be back in seven days.
7514260	7516420	I'm sure there's going to be more gaming news this week.
7516420	7518660	This is probably going to be a pretty busy month for gaming news.
7518660	7521460	It's not going to happen all at once, but like slow, slow trickle
7521460	7523140	through probably all the summer.
7523300	7525660	Do we have any big events that we don't necessarily, Oh, the EA, we talked
7525660	7527580	about the earlier show, so the EA events this next week, right?
7527580	7530340	So we'll maybe I'll get, Oh my gosh.
7530340	7533820	Maybe Jamie and I get to spend three hours talking about a mass effect
7533820	7535140	trilogy remaster next week.
7535180	7536340	I really hope that's the case.
7536620	7537620	Fingers and toes crossed.
7537820	7542820	So maybe, or more Sims or I don't know, new star Wars game.
7543220	7543860	There's that for sure.
7543860	7544500	We know that one.
7544500	7545780	I don't feel, yep.
7546180	7548900	So that'll be some exciting stuff to talk about next week is as much
7548900	7553420	shit as EA sometimes gets, uh, there's some pretty darn good games that come
7553420	7556140	out of it, so we'll, uh, we'll, we'll be looking at that for next week.
7556140	7556900	And who knows what else?
7557260	7559300	Uh, so we'll be back in seven days to do that all again.
7559300	7561980	Thank you so much for downloading, uh, the feed.
7562300	7563580	Uh, and thank you so much.
7563660	7566980	Uh, for those of you guys that are listening live as well.
7567100	7570260	Um, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend, leave a nice five
7570260	7571620	star review on a place like iTunes.
7571620	7573940	I don't think we've gotten a review on iTunes in like three years.
7574220	7577700	Um, but I would appreciate if someone would leave one tonight, um, or
7577700	7579060	wherever it is you found this show.
7579100	7582460	Uh, I know a lot of you are listening on Spotify, uh, and other places as well.
7582460	7584540	Maybe you're listening directly at vognetwork.com.
7584540	7585140	That's fine too.
7585140	7586300	However, you're listening to the show.
7586700	7588180	I appreciate you being here.
7588180	7588980	Thank you so much.
7589340	7590900	Um, I think that's it.
7590940	7592980	I think we get to give our final thoughts now.
7592980	7594980	So, um, I'll start.
7595300	7598700	Um, my final thought tonight is, uh, black lives still matter.
7599220	7601700	Black trans lives, especially still matter.
7602060	7603180	It is pride month.
7603420	7608620	Let us not forget that pride was a riot that was started by trans
7608620	7609860	women, black trans women.
7609860	7611980	So, uh, don't forget, don't forget that.
7612500	7614780	Um, that's, that's what I got.
7614900	7615300	Loki.
7616500	7619780	I'm going to probably end up playing more Minecraft this week
7619940	7623060	because I'm stuck in that loop.
7623060	7625540	So I need to stream some.
7627300	7627860	All right.
7628220	7630260	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Onch Radio.

7632540	7636940	Uh, we will see you next time here at Orange Onch Radio, uh, in seven days
