7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	28000	You know, I had a good last week. A new X-Week and Pokemon Snap release were announced, and that excites me. It's a long wait for them to get here, but Introvert's E3 week was great to me. These are just two games in a week of exciting news. Stay tuned for the rest, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 824 of our show for this June the 21st of 2020.
46000	60000	Happy Father's Day to everybody out there who's celebrating today. Happy Father's Day to all my favorite daddies out there, including a father right here on Orange Lounge Radio. Say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki, joining me thanks to the magic of Discord.
60000	61000	Hello, how's it going?
61000	62000	Good, how are you, Loki?
62000	63000	I'm fine.
63000	64000	Good.
64000	66000	I'm tangling myself from chords.
67000	79000	It's understandable. It's like sometimes the tech stuff ends up like a box of Christmas lights. Not joining us tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. She is taking the night off to take care of some other things, but she will be joining us next week.
79000	99000	Next week after all is episode number 825, and it happens to be our birthday show, which this is this is the 2020s just been a strange year and obviously these are these are interesting times that we're in right now and it feels a little weird to be celebrating and all of that but 18 years is a very long time.
100000	127000	825 which will be next week's episode is a very roundish number. So yeah, we'll be kind of celebrating a little bit of that stuff next week we've been we've been working on some stuff under the hood that I was hoping would be more of a we're going to return to the studio and we're going to kind of have a soft relaunch while we're all here together again and studio again but then now all these COVID things are back on the rise where we live in California and and in many other places too.
127000	148000	So I have a feeling these discord magic episodes are probably going to continue for quite some time. So there it is. But anyway, what the heck are you playing behind you this week Loki What is that running? I mean, I realized those in the podcast can't see video but those on Twitch can. What is that that you're running behind yourself there's Oh, is that Kirby?
148000	173000	You're muted, buddy. Don't forget to unmute. Sorry, it's still the same thing as last week. It's a I would say it's a video game study radio by game chops radio. So it's like this like kind of lo fi like video game remix stream thing that I put on but they always have these like looping random video game animated gifs so I just thought I did see if I dodge out of the way here.
173000	197000	Okay, all right. Props to them. Props to them. Okay. And I see many people in chatter recognizing like Kirby 64. Again, a shout out for our chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and several folks act FC very recognizing Kirby 64 there, SSG100 Matt saying the show can legally vote now, which by the way, vote.
197000	221000	Well, sadly, I can't register the show to vote. We all know that would be a bad thing. But myself, Loki and dark soccer certainly are registered to vote. And I hope all of you guys are as well. In fact, I think on our ticker bar at the bottom live on Twitch, it even reminds you like how to register, which is vote.gov. It's very, very easy to get that process started. So if you are a legal age, 18 to vote in the US, and in fact, I think if you're going to be 18 by the end of the year, you're going to be 18 by the end of the year.
221000	233000	So if you are a legal age, 18 to vote in the US, and in fact, I think if you're going to be 18 by the next election, in some states, you can register now all the rules and all that good stuff is over at vote.gov.
233000	242000	So anyway, uh, it is Father's Day. Of course, as I was saying at the top of the show, have you have you been able to do anything kind of special today, Loki and with the holiday or
242000	248000	I you muted again. I don't know why.
248000	256000	It's okay. Because I have kids yelling in the background. So I, I went out and cleaned gutters.
256000	260000	And then I got pizza from Roundtable.
260000	266000	Okay, well, that's okay. Like, wow. What a riveting day. You got to go out and clean the gutters.
267000	270000	Okay, but Roundtable.
270000	276000	And then aside from that, you know, I've been playing Minecraft, like most of the weekend. Okay, that's good, too. That's a good reward. That's nice.
276000	285000	All right. So let's get into some video game news. And this week is kind of the continuing of E3 that didn't really happen this year.
285000	290000	So we get all these other kind of random things that are popping up over the next few months instead.
290000	296000	So one of the big groups or one of the big companies that would always have a big press event during E3 week would be EA.
296000	301000	So we got their event last week or this last week. Right, Loki?
301000	309000	That's correct. So they were showing off some pretty cool stuff, one of which we've already were teased because it leaked out anyways.
309000	313000	And so that was the brand new Star Wars game, which looks pretty awesome.
313000	320000	So Star Wars Squadrons, it's going to be a five on five flight sim game, basically.
320000	325000	And so they showed off some actual gameplay of that and it looks pretty amazing.
325000	328000	And it's supposed to be coming out later this October.
328000	336000	Yeah, it's one thing to know the title and hear that it got leaked, but it's another one to really see it in motion and all the things they have planned for it.
336000	338000	It looks pretty cool.
338000	342000	Yeah, so it does look pretty awesome.
342000	348000	And so it's going to be coming out, like I said, around October so far, unless it gets delayed.
348000	355000	Then they announced some additional things, including Apex Legends is coming to Switch and Steam this fall.
355000	360000	And there's supposed to be some sort of cross play with that as well.
360000	364000	And then they're doing a new event, Lost Treasures, which is starting this week.
364000	366000	So that's pretty cool.
366000	368000	A lot of Switch fans going to be very happy about that one.
368000	377000	Although I imagine like Overwatch, it's not going to look quite as crisp as the PlayStation 4 version or the Xbox One version.
377000	382000	But it's going to be portable, at least within your own home, because that game kind of requires an internet connection.
382000	387000	But still, that portability of sorts of the game is going to be a huge asset.
387000	395000	And remember when portability meant you were playing like the Game Boy port of Mortal Kombat, which I think was just straight up missing characters?
395000	406000	Yeah. So like, you know, a tiny little loss in graphics is probably not going to be a big deal for a lot of Nintendo fans to be able to play Apex Legends, which is free anyway.
406000	408000	So what do you got to lose, right?
408000	418000	Right. And so it did like, I mean, I haven't really played Apex, but it's cool to see it come to other consoles and stuff.
419000	426000	So that's neat. I mean, everybody's been kind of porting different things over to the Switch, so it's about time they got more stuff.
426000	435000	Well, and the fact that this is EA as well is, you know, and this is a title like Apex Legends, which has performed incredibly well for them.
435000	444000	I think the fact that this is coming over to the Switch when EA, just this last round when Nintendo with the Wii U kind of left Nintendo at the altar, really.
444000	450000	I mean, you know, EA promised all these big things. They delivered a few of them when the console first came out the gate.
450000	462000	But because these, you know, year old, two year old ports didn't perform well out the gate, when I think a big reason why is that they were ports of year and two year old games everybody had already played.
462000	465000	Yeah. Anyway, I don't mean to rehash drama for 10 years ago.
465000	473000	No, no, no, I completely agree. Yeah, you're right. You know, the strategy of porting over old games to the Switch is just not a good one, which is why they're going to do it some more.
473000	481000	And so they've got, of course, Burnout Paradise Remastered, which is coming out as well, or already came out.
481000	488000	And then they have seven more games coming over to the Switch from EA ports, and that's going to be over the next 12 months.
488000	490000	So they haven't learned a thing.
490000	495000	Yeah, these are not going to perform at the levels EA is hoping for.
495000	497000	Apex is different because it's free.
498000	508000	Apex will do fine. So I hope there's something, I'll probably download Apex on the Switch, but I hope there's something in there that EA can kind of see, you know.
508000	516000	Well then, and then so they did show off another multiplayer game as well.
516000	523000	It's a game called Rocket Arena, which doesn't look all that original.
523000	530000	It's basically, it's like an FPS, almost like an Overwatch type looking game, but it's, you know, it's from EA.
530000	535000	And so they're going to have that coming out now with cross play on July 14th.
535000	538000	And that's coming to all different platforms.
538000	541000	I honestly couldn't get excited about that trailer at all.
542000	550000	Although EA embracing the cross play kind of initiative that, you know, we've really come a long way with that in the last two years.
550000	557000	And the fact that EA seems to really be embracing that and putting that in more of their games, that a nice, a polite golf clap for that.
557000	561000	Well, yeah, I'm glad that that happens because I know like, was it today?
561000	566000	Even I was trying to get my because, you know, with Minecraft, it's all the bedrock edition.
566000	568000	It's supposed to be cross play across all platforms.
568000	573000	PlayStation 4, I swear to God, it just doesn't want to work.
573000	576000	It does not want to work with any of them.
576000	578000	You can't see any of your friends online.
578000	581000	You can't play with other people.
581000	584000	You can't access the realms that are in there.
584000	593000	I'm surprised with it being this announcement was almost it was over six months ago that they had added that bedrock addition to PlayStation 4.
593000	596000	And they still haven't resolved all that stuff yet.
596000	597000	That's just ridiculous.
597000	601000	And I hope that's not the same with other games across EA and stuff.
601000	603000	I hope they're not running the same problems.
603000	607000	But I would think a company like Microsoft or Mojang should be able to be able to handle that.
607000	611000	And I have a feeling that Sony is the one that's kind of dragging their feet.
611000	615000	Yeah, admittedly, I haven't tried a lot of games with cross play.
615000	622000	I mean, the only one that I play on an extremely regular basis is Final Fantasy 14, which is really seamless with PlayStation 4 and PC.
622000	626000	But I think that's because it's all just running through Square Enix's servers at the end of the day.
626000	631000	And Microsoft still is not invited to the party for some reason with Final Fantasy 14.
631000	634000	I would have thought for sure that would have been remedied by now.
634000	639000	Maybe it's something we'll hear about in July whenever Microsoft does their big event.
639000	641000	But other than that, there's not a lot.
641000	644000	I guess I've played Rocket League a little bit here and there.
644000	647000	But I don't know if I was playing against people on other consoles.
647000	648000	Right.
648000	653000	And I guess really the only other game was No Man's Sky I was playing last week.
653000	659000	And it was because, you know, it's on Xbox Game Pass now and that is now a multi platform.
659000	669000	But because it's No Man's Sky and it's literally the universe, you don't exactly run across people unless you're like looking for it, especially when you're first starting the game.
669000	671000	Yeah, true.
671000	672000	Some other stuff.
672000	675000	So they did show off a lot of like indie games as well on there.
675000	680000	So they had a game called A Way Out.
680000	682000	And I'm sorry, not A Way Out.
682000	683000	It's called It Takes Two.
683000	686000	It's from Hazellight or Hazellight who did A Way Out.
686000	691000	And so It Takes Two is a co-op adventure platformer.
691000	697000	They did another one called Lost in Random, which was a game from Zoinks or Zoink Games.
697000	703000	Those both look kind of cool, especially the latter, the Lost in Random.
703000	710000	One thing I wanted to mention about Star Wars Squadrons that was pretty awesome, though, is the campaign apparently is fully playable in VR, which is awesome.
710000	712000	So I'm definitely going to have to check that out.
712000	716000	And that's both on PlayStation and in PC.
716000	717000	So what else?
717000	720000	Have we seen EA really embrace VR yet?
720000	726000	I'm trying to think of like other big VR titles EA might have been behind and I'm drawing a blank in the moment.
726000	728000	I don't think, I can't think of any.
728000	733000	So this is kind of a step for them, unless somebody in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
733000	736000	OK, see, I knew if anybody would pop in on VR to be Bobby.
736000	741000	Bobby Blackwell says that they did a PSVR mission for a previous Call of Duty.
741000	744000	OK, so that was like dipping the toe in the water.
744000	746000	Now this is like wading in the pool.
746000	749000	Call of Duty is not EA, Call of Duty is Activision.
749000	751000	So that's not the same.
751000	752000	There is, there is that too.
752000	754000	Yes, good call.
754000	756000	And now I know what you're talking about.
756000	757000	Yeah, there is.
757000	765000	They did like a VR like it was their futuristic jet thing from Dancewar Fighter or it was a while ago.
765000	768000	Bobby's correcting Battlefront 2.
768000	769000	Oh, Battlefront 2.
769000	770000	OK.
770000	772000	Yeah.
772000	773000	Yeah.
773000	774000	Then they kind of showed off.
774000	780000	They teased a few things from like Criterion, BioWare, DICE and EA Motive and just showed some like in development stuff.
780000	782000	Do you know what they hold up, Loki?
782000	786000	You're not just going to go right through that because you know what they didn't tease from BioWare?
786000	788000	You know what wasn't shown from BioWare?
788000	791000	You know what we had no news about from BioWare?
791000	793000	A new Dragon Age?
793000	801000	We got, OK, we got like four screenshots of and I don't even think they said it was Dragon Age.
801000	805000	They were just like this game that we're working on that looks a lot like Dragon Age.
805000	811000	It's like we have four screenshots from that and nothing on Mass Effect.
811000	817000	When it's like the trilogy remaster is the worst kept secret in the industry right now.
817000	827000	I'm not sure why they unless, heaven forbid, they canceled it, which I swear to God, if they canceled it.
827000	828000	I'm not going to say anything.
828000	833000	The silence is because I'm making gestures because I'm not going to say anything that's going to get me in trouble on Twitch.
833000	836000	But if they canceled it.
836000	840000	I'm going to be so mad, so mad.
840000	844000	Yes. Silent Rage says act out. Perfect. Yes.
844000	850000	They're going to get a game called Silent Rage. That's what they're going to get. That's for sure.
850000	856000	Quest Busters pointing out we still have no idea what Anthem 2.0 is either.
856000	865000	Yeah, they've there's still little updates on Anthem here and there, but I don't think they put anything really in the EA Play presentation there.
865000	872000	Quest Buster says there were screenshots of something that could be Dragon Age 4 when they were talking about EA working on new worlds.
872000	878000	Tiger Claw says the question is, do you want a new Mass Effect after what happened with Andromeda?
878000	881000	Yes. Does that answer surprise you?
881000	889000	Number one, Andromeda wasn't that bad and I wouldn't even say it was bad. Andromeda was undercooked.
889000	894000	So my answer to that is really, yes, I would. I'm I would.
894000	900000	First, a Mass Effect remaster is going to be very hard to go wrong with because the original trilogy was fucking great.
900000	906000	But if we're talking about a new Mass Effect game, yeah, I'd love to see that happen even after Andromeda.
906000	912000	But please don't release it until it's done.
912000	916000	That's all I'm asking. That's the big yes. Make it. I would love a new Mass Effect. Please.
916000	924000	May I have a new Mass Effect? But just make sure it's done. Make sure it's done. That's all.
924000	930000	And don't release it on one of those frickin pay a subscription fee to play at 48 hours early thing.
930000	934000	It was a horrible idea. Well, they're going to do that because it's EA.
934000	940000	Oh, it's like they're it's the I don't it's how do I shoot myself in the foot over and over and over again?
940000	945000	See that system. I don't it boggles my mind why they're they are so stubborn on that.
945000	950000	But the extra money I could possibly make, I need to make all of the money.
950000	956000	Anyway, what else did they I'm over my Bioware moment. What else do they announce?
956000	963000	That was pretty much it. Really? Oh, no, no, it was rather hurt. We're just going to ignore sports.
963000	968000	Just get it. Just ignore the sport. OK, OK, so so so they they've he's skate four.
968000	973000	So that was a big thing. They don't show anything. I realized we don't this isn't the Madden show.
973000	977000	OK, I realize there's some video games in there to show Madden.
977000	981000	So like, is that really a new thing or was that? No, that was NBA. I don't know.
981000	985000	It's also one of those things where it's like, are you really surprised to do that?
985000	990000	It's kind of like that are our next gen sports games are being going to be more next gen.
990000	996000	Whoo. Without actually going into details on what it is. So like, I don't know, like.
996000	1000000	I don't find it worth talking about because even doing the details about it.
1000000	1005000	S.S. Joe and her mat says way to ignore sports with a crying emoji. Way to go. Way to go, Matt.
1005000	1014000	You made Matt cry. Way to go. But active playing those games doesn't make you cry enough.
1014000	1021000	Act after chat says they didn't even mention NHL, though, which I mean now.
1021000	1027000	OK, now now that's a good retort because, you know, hockey is the only sport that matters.
1027000	1031000	That statement will make Matt cry. The only matter if you make them money.
1031000	1035000	And unfortunately, you know, that doesn't make them a lot of money.
1035000	1039000	All right. All right. I'm sure it'll look great.
1039000	1046000	But like, I don't know, it's it's I can't really get excited about it just because they don't innovate with that.
1046000	1050000	I mean, they innovate in all the wrong areas. Like, I don't need more grass physics.
1050000	1058000	I need. But Loki, didn't you not see on the PlayStation five how much sweat we're going to get.
1058000	1065000	Sweat. OK, more sweat, more real.
1065000	1072000	So, OK, some folks in chatter piping up on skate, though, because that was a pretty good pretty big announcement.
1072000	1078000	I mean, yeah, it's exciting that they are in make another skate, obviously, because they see Tony Hawk popular.
1078000	1085000	Let's follow up in all these other like independent games getting made that are basically like skate.
1085000	1090000	And everybody's jumping for joy for that stuff. So they're like, OK, there's some money to be made here.
1090000	1096000	But honestly, like in and I get it. Maybe if people are just as excited about like the Metro,
1096000	1100000	Metro Prime 4 announcement where all it was is practically a logo.
1100000	1105000	I mean, that's basically all we got is like, yep, it's in development. What's it coming out?
1105000	1111000	No idea. Any details? Nope. Have none of those for you. So I don't know.
1111000	1119000	I can't get excited about it because one, I didn't play skate and then to no details.
1119000	1124000	So. All right. Our Twitch chat is lighting up a little bit.
1124000	1132000	First off, regarding sweat, some folks are talking about the sweat thing is that Bobby Bickel says they've been zooming in on beads of sweat for two console generations.
1132000	1140000	The PlayStation three was powerful enough to show sweaty athletes, but Bobby ray traced sweat.
1140000	1146000	Yes. You're going to see so much ray traced sweat from your camera. That's about 20 feet back up in the air.
1146000	1151000	You're not going to see any of that detail. It's going to glisten a matter. It's going to glisten on the replays.
1151000	1156000	Who cares? OK. S2 and her mat with a realistic take here saying in their defense,
1156000	1162000	this new partnership with steam is monumental because this opens the door for EA Sports games to come to PC.
1162000	1170000	Finally, fair point. You know, as much as we might poke fun at things like Madden and so forth, they sell shit tons of copies.
1170000	1174000	They're extremely popular games. FIFA is probably the biggest game in the entire world.
1174000	1178000	When you look at that perspective, coming out there on PC already.
1179000	1180000	Is Madden on Steam?
1180000	1182000	They're on Origin.
1182000	1187000	OK. OK. Well, does that really does that really count?
1187000	1190000	I think they've given up. I think that they they looked at their numbers.
1190000	1194000	They're like, yeah, our experiment to put our own platform didn't work.
1194000	1197000	Everyone's not flocking to us for, you know, games.
1197000	1202000	Hold up. I got I got a realistic question because this might actually be something worth worth considering.
1202000	1207000	Is Origin available in every country? Because Steam is available in a lot of countries.
1207000	1214000	Origin is not. So maybe there is something where it's going to open it up to new countries.
1214000	1218000	And especially when we talk about things like FIFA, that could be a pretty big deal.
1218000	1222000	Actives saying FIFA is the only sports game on PC.
1222000	1225000	But it seems that Madden is coming back to PC, too.
1225000	1229000	They've had Madden on PC. I'm not sure why they would have not brought it each year.
1229000	1233000	Maybe just it doesn't sell enough. But I don't know.
1233000	1239000	I mean. Here here's what I think it is it comes down to now.
1239000	1248000	So before the prospect was, well, we don't make enough on those or we're losing like a little bit of a percentage.
1248000	1256000	So say we sell on Origin, we're not making that additional 30 percent off of selling that title up front.
1256000	1262000	But then something happened over the last few years, and that's something is we make billions of dollars off of microtransactions.
1262000	1271000	And so that losing the initial 30 percent or like, say, I don't know, like six dollars, eight dollars off of that title.
1271000	1280000	Initially isn't such a big deal anymore because they're making so much more back on just getting people to, you know, have that game.
1280000	1289000	That's why you see a lot of times NBA 2K, for example, recently giving it away for free market down to like under ten dollars.
1289000	1297000	I think it was even down to under a dollar at one point because they get people in there and they know they're going to spend more than that on microtransactions.
1297000	1299000	And that's where they're making all their money back.
1299000	1304000	Really, they should just go to free to play with this stuff in the first place since they're monetizing it like free to play.
1304000	1308000	But they're still greedy and they want to sell it for sixty dollars, but whatever.
1308000	1310000	So they're going to make some additional profit that way.
1310000	1322000	But that's why I think you're seeing less resistance to putting out more platforms now because they're realizing that they can make more of that on the back end with these games versus not putting it everywhere.
1322000	1326000	I kind of get that. I think I think there's some truth into what you're saying there, for sure.
1326000	1331000	So. All right. Anything. So we get everything on the EA play event then we're good there.
1331000	1335000	Yeah. Now that now that we've acknowledged sports and skate and all that good stuff.
1335000	1339000	All right. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we've been playing this week.
1339000	1343000	Sports games or otherwise. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1343000	1348000	It was mainly well, it was enough for a little bit and then it was mainly Minecraft.
1348000	1354000	So I have my Minecraft realm that I'm I'm actually sort of playing right now.
1354000	1358000	It's on its auto plane, I guess it's doing AFK fishing for.
1358000	1362000	So we did a lot of stuff there.
1362000	1369000	We've built like out different portals to different biomes that aren't near our our main house.
1369000	1374000	And I've expanded the house a few times. And then this week I was putting together a giant map wall.
1374000	1380000	So it's like, I think, 12 blocks high and like 18 blocks wide.
1380000	1386000	It's just enormous. So I've been putting it up together and just getting prepared for the new update,
1386000	1389000	which will be I think we'll probably be talking about a little bit later.
1389000	1395000	But new updates can be coming out soon at another update and lots of stuff coming with that.
1395000	1403000	So I just been playing out with the kids. Nice. Anything else besides Minecraft or in Orna?
1403000	1408000	That that's pretty much it. I've gotten a lot. I was purchasing some stuff.
1408000	1416000	So, like, I noticed that there was like some RPGs and stuff down dirt cheap, some indie stuff on the Switch, on the Nintendo eShop.
1416000	1420000	They were down to like 10 cents or like even less than that.
1420000	1424000	So I was going on the eShop, I sorted by price and I picked up a few games.
1424000	1428000	Like there was a bunch of games for like a penny or like nine cents for stuff.
1428000	1432000	And so I didn't even know that. Wow. I was just grabbing them because it's like, well, this sucks.
1432000	1436000	Who cares? It's a penny. And plus, I have Nintendo points, so it doesn't cost me anything.
1436000	1440000	So I picked up a few games and actually my kids are been enjoying those.
1440000	1444000	They had a few games. They're really good that were down to like a buck fifty.
1444000	1447000	So I was like, whatever, let's just have some more stuff to that.
1447000	1452000	I fixed my Switch this week because the SD card reader was bad. So I had to replace that.
1452000	1456000	And then what else? Yeah, that's pretty much it.
1456000	1459000	I mean, so I wanted to play some of the stuff in the Steam.
1459000	1464000	They have that indie fest thing going on and to play a bunch of the demos for things.
1464000	1470000	Like Tank and Rock was one I wanted to try out. And there is a SkateBurb, which is pretty awesome.
1471000	1479000	And then I don't know, plus diving into the 1700 games or whatever they got in the itch.io bundle.
1479000	1484000	So I got to go play some of that stuff eventually. I saw my kids the other day.
1484000	1487000	I'm like, well, I probably will play most of the stuff now.
1487000	1491000	But when I retire someday, I'll just have lots of stuff to play.
1491000	1495000	But we know that's not going to happen. I'll just end up buying more games.
1496000	1499000	The eternal backlog. Yes.
1499000	1503000	All right. My gaming week. So I've still been continuing in Xenoblade.
1503000	1510000	I'm in Chapter 6 or 7 now. And yeah, I'm really enjoying that game.
1510000	1515000	I don't know what else to say. It's a fun little RPG and I've been playing it in kind of short bursts.
1515000	1521000	But the sheer amount of side quests there are to do in that game kind of lends itself pretty well to being able to play the game in short bursts.
1521000	1526000	That's nice. I've still been playing a little bit of Animal Crossing, but I've scaled way back on Animal Crossing.
1526000	1532000	I stopped with the turnip thing. My extent in Animal Crossing is more like helping Alan.
1532000	1536000	Because he got to Animal Crossing about six weeks later than everybody else.
1536000	1540000	And so he's still building up his island and it looks better than mine, but he's still a little bit behind.
1540000	1543000	So pretty much the only reason I play that game is to help him out at this point.
1543000	1548000	Otherwise, I'm kind of waiting for some more seasonal events or something to kind of get me interested in that game again.
1548000	1553000	Because I'm a little bit like, OK, I've kind of run out of things to do in Animal Crossing.
1553000	1558000	I've actually been playing a little bit, just a little bit, of Pokemon Shield.
1558000	1564000	Because you know that DLC came out, the Isle of Armor DLC came out, and that's a pretty big deal in the Pokemon world.
1564000	1569000	I didn't get it yet. I haven't been in a rush to get it, really.
1569000	1574000	Because in my brain I was like, I still have content in Pokemon Shield I need to finish.
1574000	1578000	Now I did beat the game. Remember, this is a big deal because of all the mainline Pokemon games.
1578000	1584000	Pokemon Shield is the first one that I beat. I got all the badges, beat the equivalent of the Final Four and all that.
1584000	1591000	But I did not finish that post-game content where you actually get the legendary Pokemon.
1591000	1595000	So I've started to work on that a little bit because, you know, of course,
1595000	1600000	Shane, our resident Pokemon fanatic, was kind of asking me, well, when are you going to get the DLC?
1600000	1605000	And I was like, well, I kind of need to finish the content I have before I can really justify buying new content.
1605000	1609000	So I made a little bit of progress on beating some of that extra content.
1609000	1619000	Also, I've remembered to start using my little Pokeball Plus when I go out and play Pokemon Go again.
1619000	1628000	Because you get so much of the rare candy, which is great for getting instant levels on your Pokemon and those sorts of rewards.
1628000	1635000	Because I did Pokemon Community Day was yesterday, right? They had a Weedle, had Pokemon Community Day.
1635000	1640000	And I was out, I played, like, I was doing Ingress with my Pokemon Ball Plus on the side.
1640000	1644000	And I was doing a mission downtown that took me some time to finish.
1644000	1650000	When all was said and done, I was probably casually playing for like three hours.
1650000	1654000	And I got 12 of those shiny Weedles through Bluetooth.
1654000	1657000	So I was very happy with the way that went.
1657000	1660000	So that was kind of my Pokemon adventures for the week.
1660000	1663000	Still been playing Orna a little bit myself.
1663000	1670000	I'm trying to upgrade some more of my weapons and armor and the blacksmiths so I can really take on some of the stronger stuff.
1670000	1672000	Because I feel weak right now.
1672000	1676000	I just upgraded into a new star level, whichever 25 levels.
1676000	1680000	You kind of go to a new star level, which generates all the enemies in the world and things like that.
1680000	1684000	And I'm really weak right now, so I need some better gear to take that on.
1684000	1685000	So I've been working on that.
1685000	1688000	And then I've been working a little bit with classics.
1688000	1690000	Because, you know, I have some minis sitting around the house.
1690000	1693000	And all of a sudden it was just like, I'm going to play all my mini machines this week.
1693000	1696000	So the Turbo Graphics mini that I picked up a couple weeks ago.
1696000	1699000	I finally spent some, like, real time playing some games on that.
1699000	1701000	And that was fun.
1701000	1704000	And I was playing Salamander quite a bit.
1704000	1707000	And Alan was watching me die a lot and laughing at me.
1707000	1709000	So that was a thing that happened.
1709000	1712000	And remember the Commodore 64 mini you got me?
1712000	1713000	Yeah, yeah.
1713000	1715000	Yeah, I was playing with that.
1715000	1718000	And I played a little bit. I played around a little bit with that already.
1718000	1725000	But this week I decided I want to play these random ROMs because you can load.
1725000	1730000	Remember they did a version update where you can load your own games onto it now, basically.
1730000	1731000	Yeah.
1731000	1735000	So I was having a ball with playing old Commodore 64 games on my TV.
1735000	1740000	I think it started as, like, I want to hear the theme to such and such game on my TV.
1740000	1743000	And then that just turned into Commodore 64 Night.
1743000	1746000	So that was fun. I enjoyed reliving that.
1746000	1747000	So, yeah.
1747000	1751000	I need to figure out if I want to get one of the C64 biggies.
1751000	1753000	Although I don't see...
1753000	1756000	Oh, when does that come out? Or did they already come out?
1756000	1760000	I think it was supposed to come out late last year, but I'm not sure if...
1760000	1762000	Well, I mean, COVID wouldn't have been a thing last year.
1762000	1764000	I don't know if they ever actually came out.
1764000	1767000	And now I'm sure if it was scheduled for early this year,
1767000	1770000	I'm sure the COVID thing has probably screwed that whole situation up.
1770000	1772000	So, anyway.
1772000	1774000	Fifth Dream in Chat says,
1774000	1777000	I just beat Armor Isle DLC like five minutes ago.
1777000	1780000	I heard there isn't a lot of story in it,
1780000	1784000	but obviously the new Pokemon and, well, when I say new Pokemon,
1784000	1786000	a lot of the returning Pokemon and such,
1786000	1789000	like, it kind of opens up like a new type of wild area.
1789000	1792000	And so there's just a lot of stuff to see and do there.
1792000	1794000	That's kind of what I'm hearing about it.
1794000	1797000	So it's that the story is, it's there,
1797000	1800000	but it's more about the experience in the new wild area.
1800000	1802000	So, okay.
1802000	1805000	So Bobby says the C64, not the mini,
1805000	1808000	but the C64 came out December 2019 in Europe.
1808000	1812000	North America is listed as ASAP 2020.
1812000	1815000	So I'm going to bet COVID screwed that up.
1815000	1819000	But I'm not really in a rush to get what they didn't change any of the games in it.
1820000	1823000	Right. It's just, you know, actual size now.
1823000	1826000	Yeah. And, you know, speaking of changing the games in it,
1826000	1829000	did you know they added a game in a recent,
1829000	1831000	like an official game to the C64?
1831000	1833000	They added it in a recent firmware update.
1833000	1835000	Do you know what it is they added?
1835000	1836000	What?
1836000	1838000	Farming simulator.
1838000	1843000	So somehow, someone did a port of farming simulator for the C64
1843000	1846000	in like 2018 or something.
1846000	1848000	And it is now like, so if you have,
1848000	1850000	if you have one of those Commodore 64 minis,
1850000	1852000	and you haven't updated the firmware in a while,
1852000	1856000	update it because now you can get farming simulator for the C64.
1857000	1858000	That's pretty funny.
1858000	1860000	That's the game that just keeps on giving, that's for sure.
1860000	1863000	All right. So, no, go ahead.
1863000	1864000	Sorry, I was going to mention.
1864000	1867000	So one other thing that happened this week is my,
1867000	1870000	my young son has been trying to get me to play Animal Crossing.
1870000	1873000	I still haven't because I've been too busy with other things,
1873000	1876000	but got my wife to play Animal Crossing.
1876000	1878000	Now she's playing Animal Crossing.
1878000	1881000	So that eventually happens.
1881000	1885000	And now, now she'll be playing it more hardcore, I think.
1885000	1886000	I was going to say,
1886000	1889000	didn't she get into some of the prior Animal Crossing games?
1889000	1891000	Like that's what I thought.
1891000	1893000	She didn't, she didn't start this one day one?
1893000	1894000	No.
1894000	1895000	Oh, interesting. All right.
1895000	1899000	Well, sometimes people arrive late to the party and that's okay.
1899000	1900000	That was like me with Mass Effect.
1900000	1902000	I arrived very late to that party, but I'm here now.
1902000	1903000	All right.
1903000	1905000	I think that's about it for our gaming weeks.
1905000	1908000	So we will move on and get into some other news that happened from
1908000	1909000	throughout the week.
1909000	1911000	Let's get into some other news. Loki.
1911000	1913000	Yes. Let's talk about Legos.
1913000	1916000	So we talked a little bit about the Super Mario Lego,
1916000	1920000	which is going to be launching later this year in the US.
1920000	1923000	So at least North America is going to be coming out August 1st.
1923000	1924000	However,
1924000	1928000	Nintendo announced that they're going to be launching first in Japan a
1928000	1931000	month earlier on July 10th.
1931000	1936000	So they'll be offering the starter course and I guess the Piranha Plant
1936000	1939000	Power Slide and Desert Oki expansion.
1939000	1943000	I still don't know exactly how this is all going to work,
1943000	1945000	but I do know because it's Lego,
1945000	1951000	it is going to be rather expensive with the entire range of sets running
1951000	1955000	upwards to $590, which I might say,
1955000	1959000	sounds like a lot of money when you think until you think about Lego.
1959000	1962000	And that's actually pretty reasonable considering all the other lines
1962000	1965000	that they have and how much some of their things cost.
1965000	1967000	I think it's about in line with everything.
1967000	1968000	Plus, you know,
1968000	1972000	this has got a digital element with the Mario and having the whole LCD
1972000	1974000	screen in there and stuff. So that's kind of cool.
1974000	1977000	Definitely want to pick it up when it comes out,
1977000	1979000	but they showed some more sets,
1979000	1985000	including they have a Toad character as well and Yoshi and Bullet Bills
1985000	1986000	all looks pretty cool.
1987000	1989000	I just want a Lego Mario game now.
1991000	1993000	Interesting. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
1993000	1996000	Notch actually went to Lego with the early Minecraft concept and offered
1996000	1999000	them to make it their game and they stupidly said no.
1999000	2002000	So, yeah, that could have been a big thing for Lego.
2002000	2005000	But would it have caught on the same way if it was Lego? I don't know.
2005000	2009000	They tried. Remember, they had Lego worlds and it wasn't.
2009000	2011000	It was OK.
2011000	2013000	Yeah, but it was it was a Minecraft clone.
2013000	2015000	That was the problem. It wasn't Minecraft.
2015000	2019000	Yeah, they really missed out.
2019000	2020000	Anyway, sorry.
2020000	2024000	They kind of have the sets, though, so that's OK.
2024000	2026000	But, yeah, they really missed out.
2027000	2029000	So you're interested in the Super Mario set, though, right?
2029000	2031000	Even though it's going to cost you some money?
2032000	2033000	Oh, yeah, of course.
2033000	2036000	Yeah, it looks it looks interesting to me as well.
2036000	2037000	I want to pick some of it up.
2037000	2041000	But then again, I've already spoiled myself this month because I spent
2041000	2042000	way too much money on that.
2042000	2045000	And I think I mentioned I was going to do it on O.L.R.,
2045000	2049000	but I'm just confirming I bought that arcade one up burger time machine.
2051000	2053000	So that's going to be coming whenever they shut up.
2054000	2055000	No, they haven't shipped yet.
2055000	2057000	They're still because of covid and everything has been delayed.
2057000	2060000	So I don't think they ship till the end of this month,
2060000	2062000	even though they announced it back in February.
2062000	2065000	I think they've just been having some problems due to everything going on in the world.
2065000	2068000	So I don't think they ship till later this month.
2068000	2069000	So nobody has theirs yet.
2069000	2071000	So I'll get mine when everybody else does,
2071000	2072000	even though I was late to the party.
2073000	2074000	So that part's kind of cool.
2074000	2076000	But yeah, because I spent money on that,
2076000	2079000	it's going to be very hard to justify Legos.
2079000	2082000	Like, I might get something small like because Legos,
2082000	2084000	you know, there might be there's going to be a large Mario thing
2084000	2087000	that's going to be like hundreds of dollars or one hundred dollars, I'm sure.
2087000	2089000	And then there'll be tiny, tiny Lego things, right?
2090000	2091000	Oh, yeah.
2091000	2092000	My bags.
2093000	2094000	Sounds exciting.
2095000	2097000	Yeah, I mean, some of it's you can get like the stars.
2097000	2100000	I think something like it's not too expensive,
2100000	2104000	but yeah, there's different size things that are going to be available.
2104000	2108000	Yeah, I may get a set, but that'll probably be the extent of it.
2108000	2109000	Yeah.
2110000	2111000	All right. Cool.
2111000	2115000	All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about some of the Pokemon news that came out this week,
2115000	2119000	because there was a Pokemon Direct that happened a few days ago
2119000	2121000	where, you know, it was most people suspected,
2121000	2124000	oh, it's just going to kind of detail the Isle of Armor DLC.
2124000	2125000	And it did a little bit of that.
2125000	2127000	But there were also some surprise announcements.
2127000	2130000	And if you want to talk about surprise, how about this?
2130000	2134000	This came out of nowhere, but it was also one of those things where it was,
2134000	2138000	it's about time a brand new Pokemon Snap game was announced.
2138000	2139000	That's right.
2139000	2142000	They're going back and they're making a new Pokemon Snap game.
2142000	2144000	This isn't everything old is new again.
2144000	2146000	That's right. This isn't a remake of the old game.
2146000	2152000	It's just the concept as a new game, because now it has the very first game
2152000	2158000	was when it was in 1999 when there was only the base set of Pokemon, the base 151 Pokemon.
2158000	2160000	This new one's going to have them all.
2160000	2163000	So right there, it's going to be a huge change.
2163000	2167000	Is it going to have them all or is it going to have the, we're going to have,
2167000	2171000	what is that, Pokedex Gate 2 or whatever?
2171000	2174000	Actually, that's a very good question and call out.
2174000	2176000	And maybe I want to choose my words carefully,
2176000	2180000	because we don't have confirmation that it has all the Pokemon.
2180000	2181000	So maybe it won't.
2181000	2185000	However, we know that it's going to use Pokemon from every generation.
2185000	2187000	Maybe we'll put it that way. That's current.
2187000	2190000	So we know it at least is going to have that.
2190000	2191000	It's hard to say.
2191000	2194000	We don't know if it's going to include every single Pokemon or not.
2194000	2198000	This is a different type of game, so I would think maybe they could do it.
2198000	2201000	Maybe there still will be DLC.
2201000	2202000	I don't know.
2202000	2206000	It's too early to say any of that, because all we know is that it's happening
2206000	2208000	and this is a game that is happening.
2208000	2211000	What's also kind of curious about this a little bit,
2211000	2213000	it is not being made by the Pokemon company.
2213000	2217000	This game is actually being made, or HAL Laboratory, I should say,
2217000	2219000	but those are kind of adjacent.
2219000	2224000	But anyway, Bandai Namco is making Pokemon Snap, the new one for Switch,
2224000	2226000	which is kind of like, whoa, that's a little different.
2226000	2229000	But I mean, it's not that Namco hasn't worked together with Nintendo before
2229000	2231000	on other things.
2231000	2234000	They were part of the Triforce that created the F-Zero.
2234000	2236000	Never say never.
2236000	2237000	It wasn't confirmed.
2237000	2238000	It wasn't talked about.
2238000	2241000	There's another Pokemon Direct next week that maybe they'll bring that up,
2241000	2243000	but I don't, yeah.
2243000	2246000	Right now, that's just a pipe dream, I suppose.
2246000	2250000	So some other, a little more minor Pokemon games were announced,
2250000	2253000	but there's still new Pokemon games, and some people are going to be into this.
2253000	2256000	A free-to-start puzzle game called Pokemon Snap,
2256000	2258000	which is going to be released next week.
2258000	2260000	It's going to be released next week.
2260000	2262000	New Pokemon games, and some people are going to be into this.
2262000	2268000	A free-to-start puzzle game called Pokemon Cafe that comes out on our birthday,
2268000	2270000	OLR's birthday, June 23rd.
2270000	2272000	Pokemon Cafe is going to be coming out.
2272000	2273000	It's a match puzzle game.
2273000	2277000	If I'm not mistaken, and maybe somebody in chat can correct me,
2277000	2279000	isn't it just Tsum Tsum?
2279000	2282000	Has anyone played Tsum Tsum, the Konami Disney game
2282000	2284000	where you, like, trace the paths?
2284000	2288000	I'm almost positive Pokemon Cafe is just Tsum Tsum.
2288000	2291000	But maybe I missed a difference somewhere in there.
2291000	2294000	But anyway, in this game, you are ordering a restaurant.
2294000	2296000	You're running a restaurant.
2296000	2299000	You're completing orders by connecting Pokemon monsters together.
2299000	2302000	Yeah, it's Pokemon and it's lattes, whatever.
2302000	2305000	I don't know how those things go together, but they do in Pokemon Cafe.
2305000	2310000	Another game that came out now is called Pokemon Smile.
2310000	2315000	It is a toothbrushing game, so it uses, like, the camera
2315000	2319000	so that basically you encourage kids and a lot of adults
2319000	2322000	to brush their teeth and the camera kind of sees that
2322000	2326000	and you are catching Pokemon as a result.
2326000	2329000	It's basically trying to make toothbrushing fun for kids
2329000	2334000	and it's no secret that's the audience this is aimed at.
2334000	2336000	And, okay, that's cute, right?
2336000	2340000	We do have to admit sometimes Pokemon is supposed to kind of be for kids.
2340000	2342000	It's just a lot of adults happen to enjoy it too.
2342000	2345000	So I think cute little things like Pokemon Smile,
2345000	2348000	I certainly don't have a problem with that stuff existing.
2350000	2352000	Cute, I guess.
2352000	2355000	Are they going to make themed toothbrushes to go along with it?
2355000	2359000	Loki, there's already going to be Pokemon toothbrushes out there.
2359000	2360000	You've got to be kidding me.
2360000	2362000	All right, I'm catching up on some comments from chat
2362000	2365000	over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
2365000	2370000	ActDeftInChat says Bandai Namco is doing it, but it's not Bamco's first project.
2371000	2373000	They also made Pokken Tournament.
2373000	2374000	Thank you for that call out.
2374000	2377000	That's a very good call out is that Pokken, which is like Tekken, right?
2377000	2378000	Wink, nod.
2378000	2381000	Was an Amkai Bando thing, or Bandai Namco thing.
2381000	2384000	And an arcade game.
2386000	2388000	What am I missing in the moment?
2389000	2390000	It was an arcade game.
2391000	2392000	Oh, Pokken was an arcade game.
2392000	2393000	Yes, it was.
2393000	2395000	Oh, I see you're going back on that tangent
2395000	2397000	where you want Pokemon Snap in the arcades, right?
2397000	2398000	Yes.
2398000	2399000	Okay, gotcha.
2399000	2400000	Yes.
2400000	2401000	All right.
2401000	2402000	Let's see.
2403000	2405000	I am Canadian 47 in chat.
2405000	2408000	This isn't really related to the story, but I had to read this.
2408000	2411000	After listening to the podcast since the early 2000s,
2411000	2415000	Rob and Loki don't look at all like what I imagined.
2415000	2417000	Well, and Dark Sakura is actually,
2417000	2419000	she's been participating with the show on camera,
2419000	2421000	but she just happens to not be here tonight.
2421000	2424000	If you happen to be a subscriber to vog network,
2424000	2426000	wink, wink, nudge, nudge,
2426000	2428000	over at Twitch TV,
2428000	2430000	using your Twitch Prime subscription or what have you,
2430000	2432000	you can go back and look at the archives of older episodes.
2432000	2435000	But anyhow, the reason why I read that comment
2435000	2436000	is because it begs the question,
2436000	2438000	what did you think we look like?
2439000	2441000	It's okay, we're much older now.
2441000	2442000	That's true too.
2442000	2443000	We're much older.
2444000	2446000	Maybe I did look like what you thought I was.
2448000	2450000	What I look like back in the early 2000s.
2450000	2452000	But now that's not the early 2000s.
2452000	2453000	I used to be skinny.
2454000	2460000	It's just not, things have changed in COVID-19.
2460000	2461000	And so, you know.
2462000	2464000	Yeah, the quarantine 19, that's for sure.
2464000	2465000	All right.
2465000	2466000	Let's see.
2467000	2468000	I wanted to find,
2468000	2470000	so I didn't have it on the show roll,
2470000	2475000	but there was like a recent data mining
2475000	2477000	that happened in Pokemon Go.
2478000	2480000	And I think they found some more stuff.
2480000	2481000	What was that site?
2483000	2485000	It always has the new Pokemon Go stuff.
2485000	2487000	And they found some new stuff in Pokemon Go
2487000	2488000	that it looks like they're-
2488000	2489000	The Silph Road?
2489000	2490000	What's that?
2490000	2491000	The Silph Road?
2491000	2493000	Maybe it was that, I don't know.
2493000	2496000	There's also Feve Games or Feve Games.
2496000	2497000	There's a lot of the Ingress teardowns.
2497000	2499000	I thought they did Pokemon Ones too as well.
2499000	2500000	But anyway, my point was,
2500000	2502000	and what I wanted to get to with that is that
2502000	2505000	it seems interesting that Niantic seems to be building
2505000	2508000	some type of like social network or in-game network
2508000	2510000	because you're gonna soon be able to see
2510000	2512000	what games your friends are playing.
2512000	2515000	But Niantic only has three games as far as I know.
2515000	2519000	Pokemon Go, Ingress, and Harry Potter Wizards Unite,
2519000	2521000	although that really isn't their game.
2521000	2526000	That's Port Keith's game with Niantic's back end.
2526000	2529000	Now, of course, Niantic has that Catan game
2529000	2530000	coming at some point,
2530000	2532000	but that's gonna be very interesting.
2532000	2533000	Oh yeah.
2533000	2534000	Yeah, remember that?
2534000	2536000	That's gonna be interesting to see how they implement that
2536000	2538000	and how that friends list works.
2538000	2541000	So I'm very curious to see how that all works.
2542000	2544000	So, all right.
2544000	2545000	I Am Canadian says,
2545000	2548000	Loki smiles a lot and doesn't rant as much.
2548000	2550000	Well, he's in a good mood tonight.
2550000	2552000	You missed the EA stuff earlier, actually.
2552000	2553000	Maybe there's that.
2553000	2554000	And Rob seems skinny enough.
2554000	2555000	I'll take it.
2555000	2560000	Well, I'm also in a house with other people and children.
2560000	2563000	So, you know, you have to dial it back a bit.
2563000	2565000	If you listen carefully,
2565000	2567000	you'll see that Loki's children
2567000	2571000	have gotten the loud rantiness gene from Loki.
2571000	2574000	Because you can hear him in the background.
2574000	2575000	All right.
2575000	2578000	Anyhow, let's move on.
2578000	2580000	We got more stories for you guys.
2580000	2581000	Loki.
2581000	2582000	All right.
2582000	2583000	So, you know,
2583000	2586000	I'm always fascinated with different games that come out
2586000	2588000	that try to teach you different things.
2588000	2590000	There's been several before.
2590000	2592000	In fact, I know my son used to play one
2592000	2595000	when he would go to his coding class
2595000	2597000	to learn to code JavaScript,
2597000	2600000	but this one looked a little bit more elaborate.
2600000	2608000	So, it's a game called TwiloQuest, or TwilioQuest.
2608000	2610000	And what it's supposed to teach you
2610000	2615000	is actually the Twilio's communication APIs.
2615000	2622000	And so, it's this, like, pixel, you know, retro-style RPG,
2622000	2624000	and it actually has coding in it.
2624000	2627000	And you can actually download and play it as well.
2627000	2628000	I think it's mostly for free.
2628000	2630000	But they also have, like, different things
2630000	2633000	that link back to their GitHub repositories
2633000	2635000	and talk about Twilio as well.
2635000	2638000	So, neat that you could actually play some games
2638000	2641000	and actually have them being engaged enough
2641000	2642000	to learn how to code.
2642000	2643000	I have no idea what Twilio is,
2643000	2646000	so I don't know if that would be useful for me
2646000	2649000	to learn the API calls for that.
2649000	2653000	But I guess I could figure it out.
2653000	2655000	But I still want to play the game.
2655000	2656000	This makes me think,
2656000	2660000	OK, this whole story made me think of an old, old, old game.
2660000	2663000	OK, so the Oregon Trail,
2663000	2665000	that's not the game it made me think of,
2665000	2667000	but everybody knows that game, right?
2667000	2669000	That was made by a company called,
2669000	2672000	I think it was like MECC,
2672000	2673000	I think was the name of the company.
2673000	2675000	It was something like Minnesota Educational,
2675000	2678000	somebody in chattel fill in the gaps there,
2678000	2680000	I'm sure, on what I'm lacking in the moment there.
2680000	2683000	But that company made another game,
2683000	2685000	and it was called Rocky's Boots.
2685000	2688000	And if you've never played this game,
2688000	2690000	it is worth a look,
2690000	2693000	because it really kind of turns the concept of logic,
2693000	2695000	and I think programming logic
2695000	2697000	is really what this game is teaching.
2697000	2700000	It's teaching kind of like how to think through logic,
2700000	2702000	meaning like if, then, and, or,
2702000	2705000	those types of statements that come in a lot with programming.
2705000	2708000	Rocky's Boots attempts to kind of teach you this
2708000	2709000	through different puzzles,
2709000	2712000	and you build these big, try to open gates
2712000	2715000	by putting these simple programming puzzles together
2715000	2717000	within the game's interface.
2717000	2718000	And it's really fascinating,
2718000	2720000	and it's one of those games, really,
2720000	2722000	if I haven't already spotlight,
2722000	2724000	spotlit that as a classic game of the week previously,
2724000	2726000	I really need to in a future week,
2726000	2727000	because that was a game that I remember playing
2727000	2731000	when I was younger that taught me about programming.
2731000	2734000	Yeah, and Bobby was saying that,
2734000	2736000	was it the part of Twilio I worked on
2736000	2739000	was an API that allowed you to send text messages.
2739000	2741000	And yeah, that's basically what Twilio is.
2741000	2744000	It's an API to use, it's for different companies
2744000	2749000	to send messages via SMS or Facebook Messenger,
2749000	2752000	WhatsApp, all these different apps all together.
2752000	2755000	So it is like an enterprise software or API,
2755000	2757000	but they also have this game
2757000	2758000	that kind of teach you how to use it
2758000	2762000	instead of like a boring ass course
2762000	2763000	that you can take online.
2763000	2765000	So it's kind of a unique thing.
2765000	2769000	If you want to check it out though, twilio.com slash quest,
2769000	2772000	and you can download it for free.
2772000	2774000	The other programming game I remember from when I was young,
2774000	2778000	because now I'm in reminiscing mode, was Logo.
2778000	2781000	Not to be confused with the TV network that plays Drag Race,
2781000	2785000	but Logo was, and it's a game,
2785000	2788000	Logo was really a programming language of its own,
2788000	2792000	but they taught it in a way that felt like a game
2792000	2795000	because it was like, oh, you have this turtle,
2795000	2797000	and you're going to teach the turtle to draw these shapes
2797000	2803000	by doing things like pen down, forward 90, right 90,
2803000	2805000	go to, you know, and it's like,
2805000	2807000	I've been teaching this how to build simple patterns
2807000	2808000	and things like that.
2808000	2812000	So I remember Logo was a big thing when I was a kid, so.
2812000	2814000	Yeah, I remember Logo.
2814000	2817000	Yeah, dark to see us shouting Logo.
2817000	2819000	Questbuster in chat says,
2819000	2823000	there was also an old game from the 80s from Spinnaker
2823000	2826000	that had you program robots to escape a city
2826000	2831000	by linking up things like AND, OR gates, circuits, and et cetera.
2831000	2833000	Ooh, I don't, I remember Spinnaker.
2833000	2836000	I had a math game by them,
2836000	2839000	but I don't know the game you're talking about, sadly.
2839000	2841000	See, you know, nowadays they have that kind of stuff
2841000	2844000	if you want to get into like even the basic stuff.
2844000	2846000	You know, Minecraft even has a lot of that.
2846000	2849000	They have the different education versions and stuff
2849000	2852000	that they even, I was noticing with the different objects
2852000	2854000	that they could teach chemistry in there.
2854000	2856000	They can teach programming.
2856000	2858000	I know they have block-based programming,
2858000	2860000	no pun intended, in there as well.
2860000	2862000	Plus, even just in vanilla Minecraft,
2862000	2866000	they have the redstone circuits you can create AND, OR gates,
2866000	2869000	you know, all sorts of stuff with that.
2869000	2872000	And I mean, you've seen people make some pretty complicated things with that.
2872000	2875000	The whole computers, emulators, you know, all sorts of things.
2875000	2880000	So it's, there's a lot of stuff out there
2880000	2883000	that's accessible in game form
2883000	2886000	to help even teach at a very young age.
2886000	2888000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
2888000	2890000	Human Resource Machine is a great game
2890000	2892000	that teaches assembler programming.
2892000	2894000	It's by the same people who made Little Inferno.
2894000	2896000	They also made 7 Billion Humans,
2896000	2899000	which teaches even more assembler programming.
2899000	2901000	I will have to try that because I've wanted to dabble
2901000	2903000	in assembler programming at some point.
2903000	2906000	Yeah, there's all sorts of like cool little games,
2906000	2908000	teaching games out there for that type of stuff.
2908000	2910000	I'm glad we could take a moment to spotlight this one as well
2910000	2912000	and reminisce on some of the others that are out there
2912000	2917000	from the way way past and some more contemporary stuff as well.
2917000	2920000	Fifth Dream says, Someone should build a game in Unity
2920000	2921000	to teach how to build in Unity.
2921000	2923000	Meta, that has to exist.
2923000	2925000	That has to exist.
2925000	2928000	I know you joke about that, but they already have those actually.
2928000	2932000	So there's these projects that you can start up now
2932000	2935000	that actually have tutorials on how to build the projects
2935000	2937000	or build out the projects.
2937000	2942000	Unity now has this launcher program that you use.
2942000	2944000	You can download different versions.
2944000	2947000	You can build new projects.
2947000	2949000	They have templates you can start off with.
2949000	2952000	You can actually start with these different things.
2952000	2954000	They have a kart racing game.
2954000	2956000	There's an RPG.
2956000	2958000	I think a platformer.
2958000	2962000	You can start with those and they teach you the different basics
2962000	2963000	within the game.
2963000	2966000	They have an FPS as well that's pretty awesome.
2966000	2971000	They teach you building add-ons or how to modify the code
2971000	2974000	to do different things that you learn by doing.
2974000	2977000	I understand that's a joke, but they actually do have that.
2977000	2981000	Honestly, when it comes to teaching people how to do things,
2981000	2984000	games is a very common way to do that.
2984000	2986000	I am a teacher.
2986000	2988000	A lot of you guys don't know that, but my day job...
2988000	2990000	I don't teach kids in a school.
2990000	2992000	I teach in a corporate environment, which is very different,
2992000	2995000	but I still do corporate training as my job.
2996000	2999000	Believe it or not, y'all, I'm a game designer
2999000	3003000	because I've designed games that we play in the classroom.
3003000	3005000	Games are huge for reinforcements.
3005000	3008000	I'm sure many of you, either in your jobs or whatever,
3008000	3010000	you go and you learn something.
3010000	3013000	It's always more fun when the class isn't just like
3013000	3015000	wah-wah, wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.
3015000	3020000	There's things that you participate in and little games
3020000	3023000	that get you a little more engaged and make the learning more fun.
3023000	3028000	Using games to teach people how to do things is not a new trick.
3028000	3033000	It's just interesting when what is being taught is
3033000	3035000	how to, in turn, make more games.
3035000	3037000	It's just interesting.
3039000	3042000	Anyhow, Phoenix7726 says,
3042000	3046000	But Rob, have you ever sent a student to the shadow realm?
3046000	3048000	Not yet, but maybe I'll try that in a future game.
3048000	3050000	Never say never.
3050000	3052000	Let's move on.
3052000	3054000	Let's talk about interfaces.
3054000	3056000	Interfaces of the systems we play games on.
3056000	3060000	Some new details coming out about the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X
3060000	3062000	and what the interfaces might look like.
3062000	3066000	The PlayStation 5 interface is going to be completely redone.
3066000	3070000	They're saying a 100% overhaul of the PlayStation 4 UI.
3070000	3075000	We got a little hint of that during that PlayStation 5 preview.
3075000	3076000	You remember that?
3076000	3079000	It was like the push the PlayStation button to begin.
3079000	3082000	That was all we kind of saw? That whole thing, right?
3082000	3086000	I wasn't sure if that was legit or if that was just kind of like,
3086000	3091000	we're making some UI for example purposes.
3091000	3094000	I kind of feel like it was legit, but you're right. Maybe it wasn't.
3094000	3098000	Apparently, there was a LinkedIn thread out there that got deleted.
3098000	3101000	That's how you know it was an issue because it ended up getting deleted.
3101000	3106000	The vice president of UX design at Sony, Matt McLaren,
3106000	3110000	confirmed that the PlayStation 5 will have a redesigned user interface
3110000	3115000	and said it was a 100% overhaul of the PlayStation 4 UI
3115000	3117000	and some very different concepts.
3117000	3122000	Also, in a continued chat on that thread saying the new operating system
3122000	3127000	was more subtle than flashy, but no pixel is untouched.
3127000	3129000	Hard to know what that really means,
3129000	3131000	but it sounds like essentially they're building it from the ground up.
3131000	3134000	They're building a brand new interface for the PlayStation 5, right?
3134000	3141000	Meanwhile, on the Microsoft side, there's an update that came from
3141000	3145000	some tweets that were made by a senior editor at The Verge,
3145000	3150000	and then there was a report on some next gen console interfaces saying
3150000	3155000	there will be some additional things to account for some of the Xbox Series X new features,
3155000	3161000	but the UI and the dash will be the same outside of the things you would expect to be enhanced,
3161000	3165000	such as maybe some of the picture fidelity and some of the speed and things like that.
3165000	3171000	But Microsoft doesn't seem to really be reinventing the wheel when it comes to the Xbox Series X.
3171000	3174000	Two very different schools of thought there. What do you think?
3174000	3180000	I mean, they've been kind of developing all of the interface on the Xbox One,
3180000	3184000	I think, to be cross-platform with Windows 10.
3184000	3190000	It's just kind of this Xbox platform, so I wouldn't see them making some major design changes
3190000	3194000	when the whole point is that this would be parity across these different platforms.
3194000	3195000	Right.
3195000	3197000	I mean, I guess that's why they would be doing it.
3197000	3199000	That makes a lot of sense.
3199000	3201000	I don't know.
3201000	3204000	Now, Bobby brings up a good point, and this is something I wanted to address as well.
3204000	3209000	Bobby says, to be fair, the PlayStation 4's interface never changed since launch.
3209000	3213000	The Xbox One's interface is completely different today than it was at launch.
3213000	3216000	That is true. We don't usually see PlayStation change.
3216000	3222000	In fact, I don't think they've ever completely changed their interface midway through a console's lifespan,
3222000	3225000	whereas they definitely did it with the Xbox One.
3225000	3228000	They did it a couple times because they took out Kinect at one point, right?
3228000	3229000	There was that whole thing.
3229000	3233000	But I remember the Xbox 360 went through some huge changes during its launch.
3233000	3234000	I mean, huge.
3234000	3237000	You remember the Blade's layout that the 360 originally started with?
3237000	3238000	Oh, I love the Blade's.
3238000	3244000	I loved it too, but it might be hard to fit everything we're used to seeing today in the Blade's layout.
3244000	3248000	So, the 360 changed its layout partway through its life.
3248000	3255000	So, Microsoft has shown that even though it might seem to have this parity now,
3255000	3260000	they might end up re-changing it two years into its lifespan.
3260000	3262000	Microsoft's shown a willingness to do that.
3262000	3264000	Sony doesn't really do that.
3264000	3266000	I guess, yeah.
3266000	3268000	I mean, I don't know.
3268000	3271000	It doesn't matter if it's changed or not.
3271000	3274000	Does it need to be changed unless it's kind of broken?
3274000	3278000	I would just make sure that if it's doing everything we want it to do,
3278000	3281000	then who cares if it's different or not.
3281000	3282000	Yeah.
3282000	3284000	At the end of the day, people are not going to say,
3284000	3288000	oh, I love this system more because I love the UI more.
3288000	3291000	Now, if the UI is an issue, people will speak up on it,
3291000	3294000	such as folks in our chat right now are saying,
3294000	3297000	Fifth Dream says the fucking new PS4 dashboard or whatever they call it
3297000	3299000	better be more responsive on PS5.
3299000	3301000	Because, you know, right now some of these consoles,
3301000	3305000	actually both of them for me have some issues with lag input
3305000	3307000	and things like input lag and things like that.
3307000	3309000	I get that once in a while on both,
3309000	3313000	both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, and it gets really annoying.
3313000	3317000	So, hopefully these are things that get fixed.
3317000	3318000	Yeah.
3318000	3320000	And Fifth Dream is asking, is that smush or not smush?
3320000	3321000	It is smush.
3321000	3322000	That's smush.
3322000	3323000	Yeah, it was smush.
3323000	3326000	Because he just, this is TMI, but I don't care.
3326000	3328000	His litter box is right over here.
3328000	3330000	It's right off cam on the other side of a little divider wall.
3330000	3332000	So, his litter box is there, and for whatever reason,
3332000	3337000	Mr. Smush loves to announce when he's just used the litter box.
3337000	3339000	And that's what you just heard.
3339000	3341000	Is that you'll hear scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch,
3341000	3343000	scratch, scratch, scratch, pause.
3343000	3344000	Meow.
3344000	3345000	Meow.
3345000	3346000	Yeah.
3346000	3348000	Yeah, my cat's asleep right now in the garage.
3348000	3351000	She likes sleeping out there in the hot summer.
3351000	3352000	Wow.
3352000	3353000	It's hot in the garage.
3353000	3357000	It is super hot, but apparently because she's older,
3357000	3361000	it feels really good on her bones, I guess, or something.
3361000	3363000	So, she'll just lay right...
3363000	3366000	Well, I set up some blankets out there for her,
3366000	3368000	but she'll just lay on the concrete sometimes.
3368000	3370000	Sometimes she'll lay on a blanket.
3370000	3372000	She was on a plastic bag earlier when I went out there.
3372000	3373000	She keeps moving around.
3373000	3377000	But yeah, so I don't know.
3377000	3379000	But even today, it was even worse out there
3379000	3382000	because we have somebody power washing the house.
3382000	3388000	And so, it smells like wet dirt or wet cat out there.
3388000	3393000	And so, it's hot and it's smelly and humid.
3393000	3394000	Lovely.
3394000	3395000	I don't know.
3395000	3396000	But she loves it.
3396000	3398000	She's just like, I'm going to nap out here all day.
3398000	3402000	Yeah, we have a total heat wave going on here in Northern California
3402000	3403000	where our show is based right now.
3403000	3405000	Actually, today is just the start of it.
3405000	3408000	It's supposed to be over 100 every day this week.
3408000	3409000	Yikes.
3409000	3410000	No, thank you.
3410000	3411000	Send it back.
3411000	3412000	All right.
3412000	3413000	Anyway, let's move on.
3413000	3414000	We have some more stories.
3414000	3415000	Low key.
3415000	3416000	This is exciting.
3416000	3417000	I'm excited about this game.
3417000	3420000	Yeah, so out of left field here.
3420000	3425000	I guess it's not out of left field because we've had rhythm games before.
3425000	3430000	But we have Kingdom Hearts getting a rhythm game spinoff
3430000	3433000	called Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory.
3433000	3439000	And it looks almost like if the Kingdom Hearts character
3439000	3443000	is running down the note rail for like a guitar hero
3443000	3444000	or something like that.
3444000	3447000	That's kind of what the game looks like.
3447000	3451000	But I don't really know how it necessarily plays.
3451000	3454000	I guess you just would hit different buttons to coincide
3454000	3456000	with attacking different enemies on each of the rails.
3456000	3459000	Be my assumption.
3459000	3465000	Well, I heard about it on Twitter before I saw some of the pictures
3465000	3468000	and short videos and things like that of the game in motion.
3468000	3472000	And my first reaction was, well, a lot of people were like,
3472000	3473000	OMG, Kingdom Hearts on Switch.
3473000	3474000	And then it was a music game.
3474000	3476000	But still, it's, you know, something.
3476000	3477000	And I love music games.
3477000	3478000	So cool.
3478000	3479000	Yeah.
3479000	3482000	But my first instinct was like, well, this is nice.
3482000	3484000	When can we have theater them get ported to the switch finally?
3484000	3485000	But it was.
3485000	3486000	Yeah, exactly.
3486000	3487000	Well, here's the thing.
3487000	3489000	It was pointed out to me in Discord.
3489000	3491000	This is basically theater them in 3D.
3491000	3493000	If you kind of look at it and the way that they're running
3493000	3497000	and what the note patterns are, it's kind of a theater them in 3D.
3497000	3499000	And I was like, oh, huh.
3499000	3503000	OK, well, I mean, I would have been into it anyway because you said
3503000	3504000	Kingdom Hearts music game.
3504000	3507000	And that means you're going to have all those Disney songs potentially
3507000	3509000	that are going to be in this.
3509000	3513000	But yeah, I'm excited to see how this turns out.
3513000	3517000	I still wouldn't mind a proper theater them ports.
3517000	3520000	That has been on the back of my mind, especially, you know,
3520000	3523000	even if they feel the touch screen isn't good enough.
3523000	3527000	There's the arcade style controls using the two sticks
3527000	3529000	that you could do very easy.
3529000	3532000	So I would still love to see that someday.
3532000	3537000	But this looks cool and is certainly welcome at the at the table.
3537000	3538000	So.
3538000	3540000	Yeah, it looks OK.
3540000	3543000	It's not something I'm going to be playing, though.
3543000	3544000	I don't know.
3544000	3546000	It also depends how much it costs.
3546000	3549000	I hope they don't try to charge like 40, 50 bucks for this,
3549000	3550000	but they might.
3550000	3551000	They might charge.
3551000	3554000	I want to say three theater them probably cost like 40 bucks
3554000	3555000	when it came out.
3555000	3557000	I feel like so.
3557000	3558000	I don't know. We'll see.
3558000	3559000	We'll see.
3559000	3560000	All right.
3560000	3561000	Moving on.
3561000	3566000	Let's take a trip down memory lane and visit a classic game of the week.
3566000	3567000	Every week here at Orange Launch Radio,
3567000	3570000	we like dark soccer to step into the gaming vault and find a game
3570000	3571000	that she thinks, hey,
3571000	3575000	you guys should check out this game this week and play this a little bit.
3575000	3576000	Well, dark soccer is not here.
3577000	3580000	So I decided to take over the segment tonight because sorry, Loki.
3580000	3584000	But when I was going through all these minis, I was like, oh,
3584000	3586000	I want to talk about this.
3586000	3590000	So the classic game of the week that I picked for tonight is a game
3590000	3593000	called Monty on the Run.
3593000	3597000	And it was a game for the Commodore 64.
3597000	3601000	It was also on the ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum, if you will.
3601000	3603000	It was ported to some other systems as well.
3603000	3606000	The Amstrad CPC, the Commodore 16.
3606000	3610000	Technically it exists on the Famicom disk system, actually.
3610000	3613000	Jellico made a port of this game on the Famicom.
3613000	3617000	I think they called it Monty's Great Heart-Pounding Escape.
3617000	3620000	But like the game is very different.
3620000	3622000	So I have a hard time.
3622000	3626000	All it does is it has like the same music and some similar platforming
3626000	3629000	mechanics, but like you're not even playing as Monty the Mole.
3629000	3632000	They turned Monty into a person or something like that.
3632000	3635000	I don't know. Anyway, as this video is playing on Twitch,
3635000	3638000	you're probably hearing the music in the background.
3638000	3641000	And honestly, that is the reason for this game.
3641000	3645000	Monty on the Run has a fucking phenomenal soundtrack.
3645000	3651000	When you consider this is a game from July of 1985 on the Commodore 64,
3651000	3654000	which means 64 kilobytes of RAM.
3654000	3658000	Now, obviously the Commodore 64 had that SID chip, which, you know,
3658000	3661000	kind of lends itself to a lot of the chip to noise that we hear today.
3661000	3664000	But I hope you guys can kind of hear some of that soundtrack in the background
3664000	3668000	because this game was known for its soundtrack.
3668000	3673000	Otherwise, it's kind of a base platformer that's really hard,
3673000	3676000	as a lot of these games in the 80s were very hard.
3676000	3679000	The particular person that we're watching play on Twitch
3679000	3683000	knows what they're doing, so they make it look very easy.
3683000	3687000	But basically, you know, the Commodore 64 joystick had a joystick
3687000	3690000	and one fire button. So that's all you could do.
3690000	3694000	You run and you jump. And you had to time those jumps perfectly
3694000	3697000	because Monty does, like, a little flip every time you jump
3697000	3700000	and you will get right in the way of certain things
3700000	3704000	and all the enemies that are around and things like that.
3704000	3710000	The game is kind of weird. You have all of these strange levels everywhere.
3710000	3714000	Like, he escapes a house in the beginning and then he's, like,
3714000	3717000	going through a sewer system. And all of these monsters,
3717000	3720000	like, I can't explain this. Like, there's an angry shoe,
3720000	3724000	a beer can, and a tea kettle that are chasing him right now.
3724000	3727000	Somebody was just like, let's draw random sprites
3727000	3729000	and those will be the monsters.
3729000	3732000	Now, one thing I think we also have to remember is that
3732000	3736000	a lot of the game developers in the 80s were on drugs.
3736000	3739000	Now, I'm not saying this game was made on drugs.
3739000	3742000	I'm not going to make a claim like that that I don't have the facts back up.
3742000	3745000	But I'm just going to say a lot of games in the 80s
3745000	3748000	were made under the influence.
3748000	3751000	And sometimes you see that come through.
3751000	3754000	It could be just that, you know, they ran out of ideas.
3754000	3756000	I'm not saying what I'm saying.
3756000	3760000	Because I've seen a lot of games, like, I remember playing
3760000	3763000	one of the Barbie games or whatever on the NES
3763000	3766000	and they had some weird enemies in that.
3766000	3770000	So, I mean, this is kind of on par with some of those things.
3771000	3774000	You broke up for me even though I think you came out over the feed.
3774000	3776000	So I didn't hear all of that. Sorry.
3777000	3780000	So, yeah, I was talking about how, like, some games out there
3780000	3782000	have really weird enemies as well.
3782000	3786000	Like, I've seen, like, a Barbie game
3786000	3789000	or they have, like, the Back to the Future 2 and 3.
3789000	3792000	Games have some really weird enemies and stuff like that along the lines of this.
3792000	3797000	Sometimes you just have to come up and be creative with what they have.
3797000	3800000	You just accept it because it's a game.
3800000	3802000	Yeah, exactly.
3802000	3807000	Now, okay, a lot of folks in chat are suddenly bringing up VVVVV,
3807000	3811000	which was a very big game from an indie title from...
3811000	3814000	Actually, that game is probably from 2013 or 2012.
3814000	3817000	It's almost old enough to be a classic game of the week itself at this point.
3817000	3822000	VVVVV was heavily inspired by classic Commodore 64 games
3822000	3826000	and I would argue Monty on the Run was absolutely one of those games.
3826000	3830000	Not only for the fact that VVVV has a fucking fantastic soundtrack all of its own,
3830000	3832000	but you're right, as you move from room to room,
3832000	3834000	every room kind of has its own little name,
3834000	3838000	which is something you see here in Monty on the Run as well.
3838000	3844000	So, I would say, yeah, VVVVV was heavily inspired by Monty on the Run, absolutely.
3844000	3847000	Anyway, some other details about Monty on the Run.
3847000	3850000	Monty on the Run is actually the third game in the series,
3850000	3853000	but it's probably the one that's talked about the most
3853000	3855000	because of, again, the great soundtrack.
3855000	3858000	Technically, the first game was Wanted, Monty Mole,
3858000	3861000	and then there was Monty is Innocent was the second game.
3861000	3863000	Here we have Monty on the Run.
3863000	3865000	And then there was Auf Wiedersehen Monty,
3865000	3872000	and then Mole Christmas and Impossible was the last game in the series that they made.
3872000	3876000	Impossible, I think, actually had a port on the TurboGrafx-16, actually.
3876000	3882000	But anyway, we'll save that for another day because today is about Monty on the Run.
3882000	3886000	The plot of the game is that he is on the run from authorities
3886000	3889000	after the intervention in the miners' strike.
3889000	3894000	So, he escapes from his house and has to head for the English Channel
3894000	3896000	and for freedom in Europe.
3896000	3898000	I'm not making this up.
3898000	3900000	And the last screen in this game,
3900000	3904000	he gets on a ship that has a big Union Jack on it and sails away,
3904000	3906000	and it's game over. It's free.
3906000	3910000	Anyway, and that apparently was the start for the next game.
3910000	3911000	Go figure.
3911000	3915000	The Commodore 64 version was produced by Micro Projects Limited.
3915000	3918000	There was some graphical input by Mark Rogers.
3918000	3920000	The classic soundtrack by Rob Hubbard.
3920000	3924000	The music for this version is regarded as one of the best computer game scores
3924000	3926000	for the Commodore 64.
3926000	3927000	Totally agree with that.
3927000	3931000	Rob Hubbard said it was inspired by Devil's Gallop,
3931000	3934000	and that was the tune to the radio serial Dick Barton.
3934000	3940000	This theme song has been highly rated as far as Commodore 64 classics have gone
3940000	3942000	in all sorts of different places.
3942000	3944000	Again, there was a Famicom Disk System remake,
3944000	3946000	but it was really nothing.
3946000	3948000	I have a hard time calling it a remake.
3948000	3952000	All it took was the title and this song for its title.
3952000	3955000	This song isn't even in the fucking game on the FDS.
3955000	3957000	It's just on the title screen, so it's weird.
3957000	3958000	I don't know.
3958000	3963000	Anyway, there's an unofficial port for Atari 8-bit systems,
3963000	3966000	but that didn't happen until 2019.
3966000	3969000	Otherwise, it was rated pretty well.
3969000	3973000	Apparently, it was a bestseller on the Spectrum.
3973000	3977000	Crash Magazine gave the Spectrum version a 94 out of 100.
3977000	3980000	Now, if you want to actually play this game today,
3980000	3983000	there are a couple legitimate ways you can do it.
3983000	3986000	Number one, it's on the C64 Mini.
3986000	3988000	That's what made me think about this game out of nowhere,
3988000	3990000	is that it's actually on the C64 Mini.
3990000	3992000	So if you have that, it's one of the games.
3992000	3994000	And you don't have to sideload it or anything.
3994000	3999000	It's one of the quote-unquote legit games that's on the C64 Mini.
3999000	4001000	So you can check it out there.
4001000	4006000	Also, if you have Antstream, which I backed on Kickstarter.
4006000	4008000	I think that's a year old now.
4008000	4010000	I backed that on Kickstarter a year ago,
4010000	4012000	and Antstream's out in the UK.
4012000	4015000	I don't know if they ever officially launched in the US.
4015000	4017000	I think COVID things might have set them back,
4017000	4018000	or they're in beta or something.
4018000	4020000	But if you have access to Antstream,
4020000	4024000	both the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum versions are on Antstream.
4024000	4027000	That is how I played the Spectrum version, finally,
4027000	4028000	after all these years.
4028000	4032000	And I'm sorry, the Spectrum version is garbage compared to the Commodore 64 version.
4032000	4035000	Some people from their childhood memories
4035000	4037000	are going to strongly disagree with me on that comment.
4037000	4038000	I don't give a fuck.
4038000	4043000	I stand by it because the Spectrum could not replicate this music
4043000	4046000	and was just not capable of the same type of platforming
4046000	4048000	that the Commodore 64 was.
4048000	4052000	But I'm sure some of you overseas who grew up on the ZX
4052000	4055000	are going to want to fight me on that comment,
4055000	4056000	and that's fine.
4056000	4057000	We'll fight.
4057000	4061000	But please at least try the Commodore 64 version as well.
4061000	4064000	And hey, I would still say play the ZX Spectrum version
4064000	4066000	because it was so popular,
4066000	4068000	and it's interesting to see all the differences.
4068000	4071000	You know, in this day and age, it's always about
4071000	4073000	Nintendo versus Microsoft versus Sony.
4073000	4074000	Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony.
4074000	4075000	Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony.
4075000	4077000	And we don't really talk about other companies.
4077000	4079000	Once in a great while, we might talk about Google
4079000	4082000	or one of these other newer players, you know, in televisions,
4082000	4083000	they've got a thing.
4083000	4087000	But the reality is, in 85, when this game was made,
4087000	4089000	you had Atari.
4089000	4090000	You had Commodore.
4090000	4092000	You had Texas Instruments.
4092000	4093000	You had ZX Spectrum.
4093000	4095000	You had MSX.
4095000	4097000	I mean, there was so...
4097000	4098000	You had Coleco.
4098000	4101000	Everybody had a fucking system,
4101000	4104000	and games had to be ported everywhere.
4104000	4105000	So...
4105000	4106000	Oh, man.
4106000	4109000	One of these days, we need to bring up one of those old...
4109000	4110000	You guys have to look it up.
4110000	4112000	Maybe somebody can link it in chat.
4112000	4116000	Go find, like, an old 80s gaming magazine ad
4116000	4119000	for a popular game of the time,
4119000	4122000	and notice how there's, like, 12 screenshots
4122000	4126000	showing you what the game looks like on 12 different systems.
4127000	4130000	That is something that used to be a big part of gaming in the 80s
4130000	4132000	that, I mean, as much as it might feel,
4132000	4134000	oh, Nintendo versus Sony versus Microsoft,
4134000	4137000	it was nothing compared to what we dealt with back then.
4138000	4139000	Back in my day...
4140000	4143000	We had to go through all of these different screenshots.
4143000	4144000	Anyway, there it is.
4144000	4147000	Monty on the Run, your classic game of the week,
4147000	4149000	as chosen by me.
4150000	4152000	Some comments from chat.
4152000	4153000	Let's see.
4153000	4154000	SHO 100 Matt says,
4154000	4156000	Rob is like, don't at me, fight me.
4156000	4157000	Pretty much, sorry.
4157000	4158000	Fifth Dream says,
4158000	4160000	Yeah, most of these aren't ports
4160000	4162000	so much as game with the same name,
4162000	4164000	and beyond that, they're not recognizable.
4164000	4166000	Yeah, that happens sometimes.
4166000	4167000	Let's see.
4167000	4168000	Pixelpaca says,
4168000	4171000	These game names when talking about the Monty and Mole series.
4171000	4173000	Yeah, that's a little crazy.
4173000	4175000	Bobby Blackwolf also says,
4175000	4177000	And the best part of this is that all these games
4177000	4179000	came out in the span of one year.
4179000	4180000	Just kidding.
4180000	4181000	You know what, though?
4181000	4183000	Like, five games probably came out
4183000	4185000	in the scope of, like, five years, though,
4185000	4186000	so maybe a little more,
4186000	4188000	because one of them was on the TurboGrafx,
4188000	4189000	so that would have been till later,
4189000	4191000	but games didn't take us.
4191000	4194000	Games could be developed by, like, a team of three.
4194000	4195000	Relatively quickly.
4195000	4198000	So, anyway.
4198000	4200000	I like Monty on the Run.
4200000	4201000	Did you guys like the soundtrack?
4201000	4202000	Those of you that could hear it,
4202000	4203000	was it coming through okay?
4203000	4204000	Hopefully it was.
4204000	4205000	Have you ever,
4205000	4206000	you've probably never played this game,
4206000	4207000	have you, Loki?
4207000	4208000	And you probably have no idea
4208000	4209000	of the soundtrack either.
4209000	4210000	Well, you need to fix that
4210000	4212000	because it's a great soundtrack.
4212000	4213000	Well, I heard the soundtrack in the video,
4213000	4215000	but, like, I haven't,
4215000	4216000	no, I have not played the game.
4216000	4217000	I didn't have a,
4217000	4220000	my friend down the street had a Commodore 64
4220000	4222000	and all we used to play on that
4222000	4225000	was a game called Kickstart.
4225000	4228000	I think it's Kickstart.
4228000	4230000	And it was, like, a little,
4230000	4233000	what was it, like, a dirt bike game
4233000	4235000	you could set up your own tracks
4235000	4236000	and stuff like that.
4236000	4237000	Okay.
4237000	4239000	I think that's what it was called.
4239000	4241000	And then, yeah,
4241000	4242000	I think that's all we ever played on that
4242000	4244000	because I think that Commodore 64
4244000	4246000	was actually his brother's computer
4246000	4249000	and so he didn't get to use it very often,
4249000	4250000	but sometimes he did.
4250000	4253000	And his brother owned the TurboGrafx-16 too.
4253000	4255000	Yeah, technically the Commodore 64 was my dad's,
4255000	4256000	but, like, that was my system.
4256000	4258000	I mean, we had an Atari 2600,
4258000	4262000	but I played nothing but that Commodore 64
4262000	4264000	probably until the Nintendo Entertainment System was out.
4264000	4266000	And that was when the Commodore 64
4266000	4267000	finally started to sunset a bit.
4267000	4269000	It was, like, 88, 89.
4269000	4272000	Although, honestly, really, Commodore 64,
4272000	4274000	well, there's still homebrew out there today
4274000	4277000	for the 64, but reality is
4278000	4281000	the enthusiasm was probably still going into the early 90s
4281000	4283000	because I wanted to say, like, 88 was probably
4283000	4286000	when, like, Geos started to really take over
4286000	4287000	on the Commodore 64,
4287000	4289000	which was the graphic operating system.
4289000	4293000	But I want to say that finally Commodore 64,
4293000	4295000	we started to see a lot less of that
4295000	4298000	when we got into the early 90s.
4298000	4300000	But it was a great machine.
4300000	4302000	I learned a lot from that little machine.
4302000	4303000	So, yeah.
4303000	4304000	Anyway.
4304000	4309000	Yeah, Kickstarter was like the trials of the Commodore 64.
4309000	4313000	So, you know, it's a side-scrolling motorcycle racing game.
4313000	4314000	That's cool.
4314000	4315000	I like that, though.
4315000	4316000	Cool, cool.
4316000	4317000	All right, let's move on.
4317000	4318000	We got some more gaming news,
4318000	4320000	including some rapid-fire news.
4320000	4323000	So, quickly, a few headlines from the week.
4323000	4324000	Loki.
4324000	4325000	Yes, so this is pretty exciting.
4325000	4327000	So, Dead by Daylight,
4327000	4329000	and I think we may have talked about this
4329000	4330000	when they announced it originally,
4330000	4332000	but it's actually out now.
4332000	4337000	So, Dead by Daylight is getting a Silent Hill expansion as well.
4337000	4339000	They've been doing a bunch of different expansions
4339000	4343000	with all different horror genres or franchises.
4343000	4351000	So, now you have the Dead by Daylight Silent Hill season.
4351000	4354000	It's going to cost you $7.
4354000	4357000	And I'm trying to see what it gives you as far as...
4357000	4360000	Usually, it's like a creature.
4360000	4361000	So, in this case, it's a germanet.
4361000	4364000	And we did talk a little bit about this last week before it released,
4364000	4366000	but obviously, the release is out,
4366000	4368000	and now we know a few more things about it.
4368000	4369000	So, yeah.
4369000	4372000	Yeah, so Pyramid Head is going to be the monster chasing you down,
4372000	4374000	or you can play as that monster.
4374000	4378000	I'm not sure who the protagonists are that they're going to have in this.
4378000	4380000	It was Heather, wasn't it?
4380000	4383000	It looks like it based on the screenshots.
4383000	4385000	So, I don't know.
4385000	4386000	Looks cool.
4386000	4387000	I don't...
4387000	4390000	And then, of course, Silent Hill being the actual level
4390000	4391000	that you can play in as well.
4391000	4393000	So, that's pretty sweet.
4393000	4394000	Yeah, neat.
4394000	4395000	I don't know.
4395000	4397000	I really should check this game out.
4397000	4399000	I mean, they have a lot of different things.
4399000	4402000	They have Stranger Things, Crossover, Saw, Nightmare on Elm Street,
4402000	4405000	Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Left 4 Dead.
4405000	4407000	So, lots of cool stuff.
4407000	4410000	I'm amazed to see this game having so many crossovers
4410000	4413000	of different franchises that are owned by different people.
4413000	4414000	So, pretty cool.
4414000	4416000	I am Canadian47 in chat says,
4416000	4418000	Dead by Daylight, on what operating systems?
4418000	4420000	It would be for all of them, right?
4420000	4422000	I mean, obviously, PlayStation gets a lot of coverage.
4422000	4424000	But Dead by Daylight's on Steam.
4424000	4427000	I'm almost positive it's on Xbox as well.
4427000	4428000	Is it on Switch?
4428000	4430000	I don't know if it's on Switch.
4430000	4432000	I don't know.
4432000	4434000	No, it is on Switch.
4434000	4437000	So, yeah, PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
4437000	4440000	So, it's pretty much everywhere.
4440000	4442000	Yeah, so it's like if...
4442000	4444000	I don't think it's the 4v1.
4444000	4446000	I think it's 2v1, maybe.
4446000	4448000	Or at least I've seen...
4448000	4449000	It could be maybe 4v1.
4449000	4453000	It reminds me a lot of the Nightmare Island 3.
4453000	4457000	Friday the 13th game, but with different genres
4457000	4460000	or different franchises.
4460000	4462000	So, pretty cool.
4462000	4464000	And then this is kind of neat to go along with
4464000	4468000	all these games coming back with unexpected sequels.
4468000	4471000	So, apparently there was a leak
4471000	4475000	talking about a brand new Crash Bandicoot game
4475000	4478000	called Crash Bandicoot 4, It's About Time.
4478000	4482000	And they had some box art leak
4482000	4485000	for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version.
4485000	4488000	It looks like it's being developed by Toys for Bob.
4488000	4492000	And apparently, though, there was an announcement
4492000	4494000	via Twitter from...
4494000	4499000	Was it Jeff Keighley saying that they're gonna be talking about...
4499000	4503000	They're doing the full reveal on Monday,
4503000	4505000	showing off what this game's about.
4505000	4507000	So, that's pretty cool.
4507000	4508000	New Crash Bandicoot game.
4508000	4511000	I guess it makes sense since the remasters are very popular.
4511000	4513000	So, might as well make a new one.
4513000	4516000	Yeah, it just goes to show if you kind of support the old stuff,
4516000	4518000	it usually will generate the interest in the new stuff.
4518000	4519000	So, that's pretty cool.
4519000	4520000	So, I'm looking forward to seeing
4520000	4522000	whatever they come up with for this game.
4522000	4524000	Now that they've pretty much confirmed these leaks
4524000	4525000	and basically said,
4525000	4526000	yeah, okay, we're showing it tomorrow.
4526000	4528000	Yeah, I saw that Jeff Keighley tweet
4528000	4529000	right before we went live tonight.
4529000	4530000	So, yeah.
4530000	4532000	It's a cute stuff secret now.
4532000	4533000	It is, it is.
4533000	4535000	Well, this is no secret anymore.
4535000	4540000	Cyberpunk 2077 had its release date delayed again.
4540000	4542000	And that made the rounds around the internet this week
4542000	4544000	is that Cyberpunk 2077 has been delayed
4544000	4547000	now until 19 November,
4547000	4550000	which is a throwback to an old Bomani classic.
4550000	4551000	But yeah, it's been delayed.
4551000	4553000	They posted a letter
4553000	4559000	and basically saying that the situation about...
4559000	4560000	They're ironing out bugs
4560000	4561000	and making sure all parts of the game
4561000	4563000	are balanced and working properly.
4563000	4565000	And this has caused things to basically get pushed back.
4565000	4568000	And it's, I think, in one sense,
4568000	4569000	people are kind of going,
4569000	4572000	ugh, because it's not the first time it's been pushed back.
4572000	4573000	But on the other hand,
4573000	4576000	hey, would you want the game to come out and be buggy
4576000	4578000	and just end up shooting itself in the foot as a result?
4578000	4579000	You know what?
4579000	4581000	With COVID and everything that's going on
4581000	4583000	and folks now working from home and things like that,
4583000	4585000	it's for the best.
4585000	4586000	Delays are never fun.
4586000	4589000	But at the same time, when the game comes out
4589000	4592000	and if it's as wonderful as everybody hopes it's going to be,
4592000	4594000	nobody will remember the delay.
4594000	4598000	Insert Miyamoto quote here, et cetera, et cetera.
4598000	4602000	Witcher 3 got delayed, I think it was about 74 times
4602000	4603000	before it finally came out.
4603000	4605000	And then Witcher 3 was great, right?
4605000	4607000	And now it even has a Netflix series and all that stuff.
4607000	4608000	So, right?
4608000	4610000	Was Witcher 3 delayed about 74 times?
4610000	4611000	I think that's about right.
4611000	4612000	Yeah.
4612000	4613000	Give or take.
4613000	4614000	I don't remember.
4614000	4615000	See, but that's the point.
4615000	4617000	No one remembers how many times the game was delayed.
4618000	4619000	Exactly.
4619000	4620000	All right.
4620000	4622000	S2100matt says, I'm fine with this.
4622000	4624000	I'm going to be playing this game a ton
4624000	4626000	and I would really like it to be a non-buggy mess.
4626000	4630000	It also makes me want to wait on getting it on one of the new consoles.
4630000	4632000	BobbyBlackWolf says, Animal Crossing was delayed.
4632000	4633000	Nobody cares now.
4633000	4635000	Questbuster says, not surprised it was delayed.
4635000	4638000	Would rather they take their time on it than rush things.
4638000	4639000	Yes.
4639000	4640000	So, that part.
4640000	4643000	I think everybody here understands it's going to get delayed
4643000	4645000	and that's just fine.
4645000	4649000	We want to do another follow-up here to the itch.io bundle
4649000	4651000	we've been talking about for a couple weeks on the show.
4651000	4654000	It was the itch.io bundle for racial justice and equality.
4654000	4656000	I think last week on the show before we signed off,
4656000	4659000	we were saying, hooray, it passed $7 million.
4659000	4662000	We'll get this before they actually close the doors on it.
4662000	4667000	$8.1 million raised.
4667000	4668000	That is awesome.
4668000	4669000	Great.
4669000	4670000	Yeah.
4670000	4673000	It was over 814,000 donations.
4673000	4678000	That means most people were actually paying more of like an average of $10 for it
4678000	4680000	when only five was being asked for.
4680000	4682000	So, that's kind of rad as well.
4682000	4686000	Now, granted, I'm sure there were some people that put down like $100, $250,
4686000	4688000	and there were some people that probably could only afford five.
4688000	4691000	And I'm not judging, shaming, or any of that stuff.
4691000	4697000	I'm just saying that's neat that the average was about double what they were asking for.
4697000	4698000	That's pretty rad.
4698000	4701000	So, yeah, congrats to everybody involved with that.
4701000	4706000	I do want to point out, and I think it's been scrolling along the ticker bar at the bottom,
4706000	4709000	but I think it's worth pointing out the itch.io efforts
4709000	4713000	and the gaming community's efforts to raise money
4713000	4717000	because, again, just because the media is talking about it less and all this stuff,
4717000	4721000	it doesn't mean this fight and this struggle is still not going on.
4721000	4724000	Let us not forget the police who killed Breonna Taylor
4724000	4729000	are still not in jail themselves or on trial or any of that stuff.
4729000	4733000	One's been fired? Wow.
4733000	4737000	That is the tip of the iceberg.
4737000	4743000	So, there's plenty more discussion to be had on these topics throughout our society
4743000	4746000	and there are going to be plenty more fundraisers to come.
4746000	4751000	Not as many people talking about this one because itch.io rolled right into a new bundle,
4751000	4753000	and I think this is worth pointing out.
4753000	4757000	Now, it might not be 1,700 games, but it's still quite a few.
4757000	4764000	It's regularly about $100 worth of stuff, 23 items in it right now.
4764000	4771000	It's Chicago New Media Artists for Racial Justice, and the goal is $10,000,
4771000	4776000	and they're sitting on about $2,800 right now.
4776000	4779000	Now, this bundle, they're asking for $20,
4779000	4785000	but you've got quite a few games in this as well that are worth it right there.
4785000	4789000	Octodad, Octodad Deadliest Catch, so if you're like a Bugsnax person right now,
4789000	4791000	you can check that out in this bundle.
4791000	4795000	Biorhythm, Plant Daddy, Antbassador, so on and so on.
4795000	4798000	There's lots and lots of stuff there, so check that out.
4798000	4804000	itch.io has a brand new bundle for Chicago New Media Artists for Racial Justice.
4804000	4807000	And there's going to be lots more charity events, I'm sure, in the coming months,
4807000	4811000	and so forth, so stay tuned.
4812000	4816000	Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates
4816000	4818000	for what is coming out real soon in a country near you.
4818000	4820000	Loki, how about the US?
4820000	4825000	Well, we've got Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 coming out on PC,
4825000	4829000	Kingdom Hearts Dark Road on Android and iOS,
4829000	4835000	we've got Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary World Tour on Nintendo Switch,
4835000	4839000	Little Town Hero on PlayStation 4,
4839000	4843000	SpongeBob SquarePants Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated on PC,
4843000	4846000	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One,
4846000	4851000	Star Wars Episode 1 Racer on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4,
4851000	4858000	and also we've got Pokemon Cafe Mix on Nintendo Switch, Android, and iOS,
4858000	4861000	and last, oh, I'm sorry, there's actually a few more,
4861000	4864000	Ninjala on Nintendo Switch,
4864000	4870000	Brigadain the Legend of Runeseria, that's on Nintendo Switch,
4870000	4874000	Collar Cross Malice on Nintendo Switch,
4874000	4878000	and Death Come True, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android,
4878000	4885000	and last but not least, Mr. Driller Land on PC and Nintendo Switch.
4885000	4889000	All right. Heading over to Japan, there's actually quite a big overlap,
4889000	4891000	a lot of those games I just heard Loki mention,
4891000	4893000	also coming out in Japan this week on the Switch,
4893000	4899000	that Brigadain the Legend of Runersia,
4899000	4903000	it's a tactical RPG it looks like, that is coming out in Japan as well on the Switch.
4903000	4909000	We also have Shujo Jigoku no Doku Musume is coming out as well.
4909000	4912000	This game is Made in Hell,
4912000	4916000	a hell where girls captured by strong emotions, desires,
4916000	4920000	and obstructive thoughts fall regardless of life or death.
4920000	4924000	This sounds interesting to say the least,
4924000	4926000	and I have no idea what kind of game it is,
4926000	4928000	but I'm sure somebody out there is into it.
4928000	4932000	Also, we have Mr. Driller Encore is what they're calling it in Japan,
4932000	4934000	and that is coming out for the Switch,
4934000	4936000	and I heard that in the U.S. releases as well,
4936000	4938000	but it's called Mr. Driller Encore overseas.
4938000	4942000	Human Fall Flat is also out on the Switch in Japan this week,
4942000	4944000	so those are the Switch releases.
4944000	4947000	PlayStation 4 I imagine is some very similar stuff.
4947000	4952000	We have a game called Death Match Love Comedy.
4952000	4955000	Wow, it's all my favorite things rolled into one title.
4955000	4958000	Death Match Love Comedy is coming out.
4958000	4960000	It is another visual novel,
4960000	4963000	but basically in this story,
4963000	4968000	if a girl falls in love with you, it means your death.
4968000	4972000	In this game, the player is a guy who just got transferred to a new school,
4972000	4976000	and if a girl confesses her love to him, he explodes and dies.
4976000	4980000	And I think he's pretty safe.
4980000	4984000	Wow, this game sounds rad.
4984000	4987000	I'm going to live forever.
4987000	4991000	She's a jerk to everybody.
4991000	4993000	Anyhow, also coming out in Japan,
4993000	4996000	that same Shujo Jiko no Duko Musume,
4996000	4998000	Journey to the Savage Planet,
4999000	5001000	and then FIFA 20 gets a price reduction
5001000	5004000	as it moves into the best hits collection over in Japan.
5004000	5006000	So those are the Japanese releases.
5006000	5008000	How about the UK releases, Loki?
5008000	5011000	So we've got, let's see,
5011000	5017000	Seto Corsa Competizone on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
5017000	5021000	SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated on Xbox One,
5021000	5024000	PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch and PC,
5024000	5028000	a game called Rush VR on the PlayStation 4,
5028000	5032000	Indivisible on the Nintendo Switch,
5032000	5037000	we've got Farmer's Dynasty on Nintendo Switch,
5037000	5041000	Journey to the Savage Planet on Nintendo Switch,
5041000	5047000	Dungeons 3 Complete Collection on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
5047000	5049000	and that's it.
5049000	5052000	All right, let's travel to the mailbag.
5052000	5054000	Every week you guys send us emails,
5054000	5056000	participate at orangelaungeradio.com,
5056000	5059000	and we read some of our favorites here on the air.
5059000	5062000	We do have an email this week that's in our mailbag
5062000	5065000	at participate at orangelaungeradio.com,
5065000	5067000	and we hope we'll get even more next week.
5067000	5069000	But this week's email comes to us from Ziba.
5069000	5071000	Always good to hear from Ziba.
5071000	5073000	So the email goes like this,
5073000	5075000	Hey all, I haven't really been able to watch live lately
5075000	5077000	due to my work schedule.
5077000	5079000	That's okay. That's why we have a podcast as well.
5079000	5081000	So I'm glad you're still with us.
5082000	5084000	Anyway, I wanted to talk about a game
5084000	5086000	I started playing again after many years.
5086000	5088000	I needed a game to play while I take a short break
5088000	5090000	from Final Fantasy XIV.
5090000	5093000	There is a content lull in Final Fantasy XIV right now,
5093000	5096000	so I understand. I still play.
5096000	5098000	I even have a new free company,
5098000	5100000	and I've met some new people in there,
5100000	5102000	but it's just like, the content's a little dry,
5102000	5103000	and it's understandable.
5103000	5105000	Things have been delayed due to COVID,
5105000	5107000	so I've also been cheating with other games.
5107000	5110000	So anyway, sorry, Ziba. I keep getting derailed.
5110000	5113000	Let's see, while I take a short break from Final Fantasy XIV.
5113000	5116000	Of all the games I have in my backlog,
5116000	5118000	I decided to go back to Guild Wars 2.
5118000	5120000	This game came out in 2012,
5120000	5122000	and let me tell you, it's still very beautiful and fun.
5122000	5125000	The combat still feels very fresh and easy to learn.
5125000	5128000	The main story is pretty good,
5128000	5131000	and there are a lot of events that people still participate in.
5131000	5134000	There's even some PvP and World vs. World
5134000	5137000	that is separate from the PvE content that I heard is fun.
5137000	5139000	However, the game feels kind of slow at first
5139000	5142000	because you don't get any mounts until the second expansion at level 80.
5142000	5146000	But the best thing about Guild Wars 2 is that the base game is free.
5146000	5149000	I almost forgot that the game was free now until my brother-in-law looked it up.
5149000	5151000	There are microtransactions in the game,
5151000	5154000	but as far as I know, they don't really sell any pay-to-win items.
5154000	5156000	Anyway, I highly recommend downloading it
5156000	5158000	if you need to take a break from another game, like me,
5158000	5162000	or if you are looking for a good free online game.
5162000	5163000	I'm having tons of fun,
5163000	5166000	and I'm having trouble going back to Final Fantasy XIV.
5166000	5170000	Happy Father's Day to all the dads and fur dads out there.
5170000	5172000	Ziba, thank you so much for the email,
5172000	5174000	and thanks for the reminder about Guild Wars 2.
5174000	5176000	I played that game when it was first out,
5176000	5180000	and I think at the time it was more like an alternative to World of Warcraft for me
5180000	5184000	because in 2012, I don't think Final Fantasy XIV was quite out yet.
5184000	5186000	So I was playing it in the beginning, and it was very nice.
5186000	5188000	I would like to go back and visit it again
5188000	5190000	now that I have a better computer
5190000	5192000	that will probably make the game look even better
5192000	5195000	than it did in 2012, 2013 when I first played it.
5195000	5199000	I couldn't, for the life of me, remember my old login,
5199000	5202000	but now that you tell me that the base game is free,
5202000	5204000	maybe I don't have to worry about that anymore.
5204000	5207000	I wonder if, because I bought the game at one point in time,
5207000	5211000	I'll get some sort of kickback if I can remember my login.
5211000	5215000	I imagine it's got to be one of two emails, maybe three,
5215000	5217000	that the game is tied to.
5217000	5219000	So if I did a password reset on those emails,
5219000	5223000	I ought to be able to figure it out and get my way back in there at some point.
5223000	5226000	But that's really cool that the base game is at least free,
5226000	5228000	even if I'd bought it all that time ago.
5228000	5231000	So that's, yeah, that's really cool.
5231000	5236000	So, the whole chat, oh, I didn't even see that during that email, Loki,
5236000	5239000	you brought Stella, and Stella's taking a nap on your shoulder right now.
5239000	5242000	Well, she was standing there screaming at me, so I had to pick her up.
5242000	5245000	Okay, so a lot of folks in chat are noticing that.
5245000	5248000	I had my face deep in that email there, so I didn't even notice that.
5248000	5250000	Aw, pretty kitty.
5250000	5253000	Okay, well, thank you, Zeba, for the email, and keep having fun in Guild Wars 2.
5253000	5256000	I might check that out as well, because, yeah, I'm also,
5256000	5259000	I'm in a little bit of a contract drought in Final Fantasy XIV.
5259000	5262000	Like, I still have fun. Like, Shane and I will get on and do Fates,
5262000	5264000	and we kind of find things to entertain ourselves,
5264000	5268000	but it'll last for an hour or two, and then it's like,
5268000	5272000	all right, I'm ready to play something else, you know, so that's cool.
5272000	5275000	I'll check out Guild Wars 2 again. That's a good tip.
5275000	5276000	Thank you for the email.
5276000	5279000	All right, that's it for our emails.
5279000	5281000	So if you want to send us an email for a future week,
5281000	5284000	participate at orangesondrader.com is the place to do it.
5284000	5287000	Meanwhile, we're going to get to our next story,
5287000	5289000	and for those watching live on Twitch, don't be alarmed.
5289000	5292000	I'm just going to step away, because I really badly need some water,
5292000	5295000	so I'll be back while Loki takes care of this next story. Loki.
5295000	5299000	All right, so let's talk a little bit about Fortnite again,
5299000	5304000	and apparently they're breaking Twitch records with a brand new event
5304000	5308000	that they live-streamed with 2.3 million live viewers
5308000	5310000	across multiple channels on Twitch,
5310000	5314000	which is apparently surpassing the previous record,
5314000	5317000	which was just over 1.7 million viewers
5317000	5321000	during last year's World Championship of League of Legends.
5321000	5326000	This also surpassed their last really big event,
5326000	5330000	which is the Black Hole event that started the game's second chapter.
5330000	5336000	Well, this one now, I don't remember if it's a brand new chapter to the game or not,
5336000	5340000	but basically they had some sort of device that was fighting back the storm
5340000	5344000	that now flooded or sunk the whole map into water,
5344000	5348000	and they have a new event now that actually has Aquaman in there and stuff.
5348000	5352000	So I actually watched kind of a replay of it, and it looked neat.
5352000	5356000	I mean, they do a lot of these big cinematic events
5356000	5360000	that the change of a different chapter or season or something like that.
5360000	5364000	So I don't know, it's kind of neat,
5364000	5367000	and they change up the map a little bit doing that sort of thing.
5367000	5370000	I still haven't really been playing this game,
5370000	5372000	but I know a lot of people really like it.
5372000	5374000	It's probably going to be one of these days.
5374000	5379000	It'll be like Minecraft where I just get into it way late in the game and find out.
5379000	5382000	There's always these random events and things
5382000	5385000	that make me want to check out Fortnite just out of the blue,
5385000	5393000	but I still can't process the strategy of building things as you play Fortnite.
5393000	5396000	I've always struggled during that game.
5396000	5400000	I don't think it matters because my son, who's six,
5400000	5403000	he's gotten second place in those matches before.
5403000	5408000	So I don't know if it necessarily is a really high-skill-based game.
5408000	5411000	I mean, aside from there's real competitive play,
5411000	5413000	but just running into the normal games,
5413000	5417000	I don't think that you have to be an expert at games to be able to do it.
5417000	5420000	And I think you would kind of pick up the whole building mechanic later on,
5420000	5424000	but you can probably still have fun with it.
5424000	5427000	Phoenix7726 in chat says,
5427000	5430000	But will there be another Travis Scott concert?
5430000	5432000	That was a trip how they did that.
5432000	5434000	Honestly, probably.
5434000	5438000	Depends how long this COVID pandemic keeps going.
5438000	5441000	I mean, who's to say?
5441000	5442000	I don't know.
5442000	5444000	Without getting too far off base,
5444000	5447000	the reality is we know a lot of places are spiking right now.
5447000	5450000	They're just going up and not showing any signs of slowing down.
5450000	5455000	I suppose one of the few positives about that situation,
5455000	5458000	although I kind of feel like the people that will die and stuff
5458000	5460000	is it's not a positive situation at all,
5460000	5464000	but that's how you're going to get herd immunity.
5464000	5466000	So I don't know.
5466000	5467000	I don't know.
5467000	5471000	But my point is if this COVID thing kind of keeps going on,
5471000	5472000	like think about it.
5472000	5476000	The entire live entertainment industry right now
5476000	5478000	is pretty fucked.
5478000	5482000	Like when was the last concert that happened?
5482000	5484000	A while ago, yeah.
5484000	5489000	I mean, I remember when Gaga did the concert at home fundraiser thing,
5489000	5492000	but we all know those are special and few and far between.
5492000	5496000	And I'm sure those of you that follow like drag queens like I do,
5496000	5500000	you've probably seen a lot of the drag queen virtual shows.
5500000	5502000	And that's really cool that they're bridging the gap
5502000	5504000	and coming up with these clever ideas on how to do it.
5504000	5505000	And I'm not going to knock those things.
5505000	5507000	I understand they've got to make money and pay their rent
5507000	5509000	and eat their food too.
5509000	5512000	But the reality is like that's it.
5512000	5514000	People are having to come up with new ideas
5514000	5516000	because we can't gather right now.
5516000	5520000	And we're not going to be able to gather for some time if this keeps going.
5520000	5524000	So as far as when is the next Travis Scott concert happen in Fortnite,
5524000	5527000	I think the realistic answer is that depends.
5527000	5529000	When does COVID go away?
5529000	5531000	Because if COVID goes away soon,
5531000	5534000	then probably probably won't see those types of events very often again.
5534000	5537000	Well, if COVID is here to stay for a little while,
5537000	5540000	you'll probably probably the beginning of many.
5543000	5544000	Right.
5545000	5546000	Yes. Okay.
5546000	5548000	So that's why I'm walking the keyboard.
5548000	5551000	So the cat was ready to go now.
5552000	5555000	She's like, I want to get up on here and walk on some keyboard.
5555000	5557000	So I don't know.
5557000	5561000	The problem is too, even though you have them locking stuff down.
5561000	5564000	So for those who may not live in California,
5564000	5569000	recently the governor mandated that now masks have to be worn out
5569000	5571000	when you go to indoor locations.
5571000	5573000	But nobody's enforcing it, which is...
5573000	5574000	Right, exactly.
5574000	5578000	So you have, like I was at the grocery store the other day,
5578000	5582000	getting groceries as usual and having a mask on.
5582000	5586000	And there's the people that this is intended to protect,
5586000	5590000	the high-risk groups, like the elderly,
5590000	5595000	those really young children like babies and stuff.
5595000	5597000	These people just don't care.
5597000	5599000	They're just out there.
5599000	5603000	I'm sorry, it just bothers me so much,
5603000	5606000	the people that refuse to wear a mask.
5606000	5608000	It's just so ridiculous.
5608000	5613000	And I get there are a couple legitimate reasons
5613000	5615000	why someone might not wear a mask.
5615000	5618000	There are a few medical conditions.
5618000	5621000	Somebody that speaks ASL and needs to be able to do that.
5621000	5623000	And just a few.
5623000	5625000	But let's be real, Loki.
5625000	5628000	Those exceptions, they are exceptions.
5628000	5630000	They are few and far between.
5630000	5634000	And we're seeing way more people not wearing a mask
5634000	5636000	than it makes logical sense to be exceptions.
5636000	5638000	Or just not wearing them at all correctly,
5638000	5640000	like where their nose is sticking out,
5640000	5643000	or I saw someone that had it around their neck.
5643000	5645000	Or there's a dude that was in there,
5645000	5649000	he had one on and took it off to go look at something.
5649000	5651000	He was on his phone and took it off
5651000	5655000	and just was doing his phone.
5655000	5657000	When somebody doesn't wear a mask,
5657000	5659000	you know what that says to me?
5659000	5662000	It says to me, I don't care if you live or die.
5662000	5663000	I don't care.
5663000	5665000	I don't care if you live or die.
5665000	5666000	That's what it says when you don't,
5666000	5669000	because you're wearing a mask to help protect other people.
5669000	5672000	And you can have this disease without actually feeling sick.
5672000	5675000	When you're not wearing a mask, you say, I don't care.
5675000	5678000	I don't care if you die.
5678000	5679000	That's what you're saying.
5679000	5682000	And that blows my mind that you have so many people
5682000	5685000	willing to look at you in the eye
5685000	5688000	and say, basically, I don't care if you die.
5688000	5693000	And that, like, I just want to slap them.
5693000	5694000	And I'm not a violent person,
5694000	5696000	and I don't condone that type of stuff at all,
5696000	5699000	but I just want to slap them,
5699000	5701000	because that person doesn't care.
5701000	5703000	It's so... Now, I don't, because, you know,
5703000	5705000	maybe it's one of those, you know,
5705000	5707000	maybe it is one of those, like, 1% of people
5707000	5710000	that have a valid exception that I talked about before,
5710000	5715000	but it's just so infuriating, so infuriating.
5715000	5718000	Why do I wear pants in public?
5718000	5719000	You know what?
5719000	5722000	I'm going to just not wear pants to the store.
5722000	5724000	Why should I?
5724000	5726000	I don't like pants.
5726000	5728000	They're uncomfortable.
5728000	5730000	They're not going to say anything.
5730000	5732000	They make me itch.
5732000	5733000	It's uncomfortable.
5733000	5735000	I'm not going to wear pants anymore.
5735000	5738000	Why should I?
5738000	5740000	I don't... It shouldn't be that hard.
5740000	5743000	You know, everybody is accepted for a long time.
5743000	5746000	There are signs at businesses that say,
5746000	5750000	no shirt, no shoes, no service.
5750000	5751000	Why is that not a problem for people,
5751000	5756000	but now we just say, no shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service,
5756000	5758000	and now suddenly it's a giant...
5758000	5762000	I'm being oppressed!
5762000	5764000	The government!
5764000	5766000	Recall Gavin Newsom!
5766000	5768000	Fuck you!
5768000	5770000	I just wish that natural selection
5770000	5772000	would happen a little faster, please.
5772000	5777000	I mean, I get that there's certain groups of individuals
5777000	5779000	that decide that they don't want to follow
5779000	5781000	any of these procedures for their own safety,
5781000	5784000	and I take that as that they accept the consequences of that,
5784000	5786000	but I would just like those consequences
5786000	5789000	to add a little faster, please, so we can get over with all this.
5789000	5791000	Anyway, all right. I'm sorry.
5791000	5793000	Sorry, I allowed tangent training to happen,
5793000	5797000	but number one, it was a chat comment that started it.
5797000	5799000	You started it.
5799000	5802000	All right, anyway.
5802000	5804000	But it's been bugging me.
5804000	5805000	It's really been bugging me.
5805000	5807000	Yeah, well, technically I was saying,
5807000	5809000	so I wear a face guard,
5809000	5811000	and that's a good alternative.
5811000	5813000	That's fine.
5813000	5816000	If you find that mask is hard to breathe in,
5816000	5818000	then that's a perfect alternative.
5818000	5823000	Look, you don't have to justify to me because you're trying.
5823000	5826000	I think if it's not very clear,
5826000	5829000	it's very clear there are an abundance of people out there
5829000	5832000	that do not give a fuck,
5832000	5835000	and that's the people I'm mad at.
5835000	5838000	So, yeah, if you have to do a mask or a guard or whatever,
5838000	5840000	okay, cool.
5840000	5842000	You're taking precautions,
5842000	5844000	and that's more we can say for a lot of people.
5844000	5846000	So, yikes.
5846000	5850000	Anyway, let's see.
5850000	5853000	BooBlue2 in chat says,
5853000	5856000	I've seen people take the mask off to talk to someone.
5856000	5859000	Like, bitch, that's when you want it the most.
5859000	5861000	So horrible.
5861000	5863000	Anyway, so here's the thing.
5863000	5865000	I'm going to be honest about something.
5865000	5869000	So, like, Alan and I have kind of tried the whole,
5869000	5871000	like, let's go to restaurants again thing,
5871000	5874000	and you might find that it's weird that I just went on that whole rant,
5874000	5876000	yet I'm willing to go out and go to restaurants,
5876000	5879000	but the thing is restaurants are taking precautions.
5879000	5883000	The restaurants that we've been to thus far,
5883000	5886000	you have, you know, people are seating at every other table.
5886000	5887000	You're not really sharing menus.
5887000	5889000	It's not the same that it was before.
5889000	5892000	There are precautions all over the place in a restaurant.
5892000	5897000	However, yesterday we went out to eat,
5897000	5900000	and I swear five minutes into the meal I wanted to get up and go.
5900000	5902000	You know why?
5902000	5905000	The wait staff wasn't wearing masks.
5905000	5909000	People were coming in with no mask.
5909000	5912000	I'm going to tell you, if I get COVID, I got it from that restaurant,
5912000	5915000	and there's a part of me that's, like, kind of mad at myself
5915000	5917000	for putting myself in that situation,
5917000	5920000	and, like, maybe, okay, maybe I guess I shouldn't have gone out,
5920000	5925000	but I'm also kind of mad as hell that they're not following the,
5925000	5927000	like, I'm not going to go back there,
5927000	5929000	and after the pandemic is over,
5929000	5933000	I probably will not go back there.
5933000	5939000	Yeah, I mean, that's ridiculous because especially those, I mean,
5939000	5941000	patrons coming into those locations,
5941000	5943000	I would see as necessarily, like,
5943000	5945000	you're not going to be able to necessarily enforce that
5945000	5949000	unless the actual location's enforcing or somehow they get caught.
5949000	5952000	But if, you know, employees are not doing that,
5952000	5954000	I mean, that could shut your whole place down.
5954000	5957000	That's ridiculous to even risk that.
5957000	5960000	But I know there's some folks that are just, like,
5960000	5962000	well, we're just not going to enforce it,
5962000	5964000	and they can't catch everybody.
5964000	5966000	You know, they're not going to be checking up on it,
5966000	5970000	and there's even departments, like, hold, like, I want to say Modesto say,
5970000	5972000	well, we're not enforcing this.
5972000	5974000	We're not going to arrest you because you don't have a mask on.
5974000	5978000	So, I mean, that's just basically saying, though, okay,
5978000	5980000	go out and do whatever you want.
5980000	5983000	I mean, originally, like, when they were talking about not arresting folks
5983000	5987000	for doing stuff, it was like, you know, if we see you out walking,
5987000	5990000	you know, for exercise, we're not going to say, well, where are you going?
5990000	5991000	Are you going to the grocery store?
5991000	5992000	Are you doing this for exercise?
5992000	5994000	Are you going to a person's house?
5994000	5996000	They're not going to stop you for that because they can't.
5996000	5999000	But, I mean, I think when there's a regulation,
5999000	6002000	and it's not like you don't know that this is a thing.
6002000	6007000	They had, like, giant, giant, like, signs out there saying,
6007000	6011000	look, this is a brand new regulation.
6011000	6013000	You know, it's in bright neon.
6013000	6014000	You can't miss it.
6014000	6018000	It's like, how do you not know that this is a thing?
6018000	6019000	You read it when you walked in.
6019000	6021000	You just don't care.
6021000	6024000	Anyway, if I miss the next show, like, you know, I'm not,
6024000	6026000	I'm not really into, like, shaming people and dragging through the mud
6026000	6028000	or whatever, but I'm going to say as Loki,
6028000	6031000	that Indian restaurant down the street, like,
6031000	6034000	if I'm not here in the next episode, shut them down.
6034000	6035000	That's all I have to say, okay?
6036000	6038000	Alan knows the one. All right.
6038000	6042000	Anyway, and that is, I'm not,
6042000	6046000	it is just my particular experience, a particular place,
6046000	6049000	and just, I'm just saying that much on the air.
6049000	6052000	I don't want you to think I am painting a broad stroke.
6052000	6055000	All my other experiences have been fine thus far
6055000	6057000	with plenty of precautions,
6057000	6060000	but I was really, really uncomfortable with this particular one
6060000	6062000	that just happened yesterday.
6062000	6064000	In fact, I'm still kind of in like a,
6064000	6066000	how the hell did I let that happen type of thing.
6066000	6068000	All right, anyway.
6068000	6070000	Let's see, moving on.
6070000	6072000	Let's move on to a different subject before I get depressed.
6072000	6074000	Moving on, let's talk about, well,
6074000	6076000	this is actually kind of sad as well.
6076000	6080000	PAX West and Australia not going to be happening this year.
6080000	6082000	I mean, I don't know, I kind of,
6082000	6086000	I stopped going to those conventions a couple of years ago
6086000	6089000	just because they're kind of large and out of control.
6089000	6090000	I don't know, I always kind of think, like,
6090000	6093000	maybe I wouldn't mind going again, like, one more time in the future.
6093000	6095000	But it won't be this year, that's for sure,
6095000	6097000	because PAX West and PAX Australia were canceled.
6097000	6100000	They were replaced by PAX Online.
6100000	6103000	PAX Online is going to be a series of livestream shows,
6103000	6105000	panel discussions, video game demos,
6105000	6108000	going to happen from September 12th through the 20th.
6108000	6111000	That's like a nine-day event that they're going to be doing.
6111000	6113000	So it's kind of like,
6113000	6115000	basically they're taking the panel portion of it
6115000	6118000	and taking it online, adding some game demos into that,
6118000	6120000	so that'll be kind of neat.
6120000	6123000	It's like yet another game announcement event,
6123000	6125000	so it's like they won't end with the summer,
6125000	6127000	but that's still pretty cool.
6127000	6129000	You know, it's a bummer about what happened,
6129000	6132000	but is anyone really surprised?
6132000	6134000	Nope.
6134000	6136000	Nope.
6136000	6138000	No, I mean, everything else has been, like, canceled
6138000	6142000	or delayed or converted to a digital, you know, event instead.
6142000	6144000	Not surprised.
6144000	6147000	Literally the only thing that I know that is still scheduled to happen right now
6147000	6149000	is Dragon Con,
6149000	6153000	and I think a lot of that has to do with the politics of the state
6153000	6155000	that it's in right now
6155000	6158000	and trying to navigate a lot of those waters.
6158000	6160000	We're still not quite 60 days out.
6160000	6162000	We will be in a couple weeks.
6162000	6164000	All I know is that I see some interesting chess pieces
6164000	6166000	with the hotels moving.
6166000	6168000	Even more hotels are starting to say,
6168000	6170000	if you want to move your reso to 2021,
6170000	6172000	they haven't all done it yet,
6172000	6174000	but more and more of them are starting to do it,
6174000	6177000	so I kind of feel like I just don't...
6177000	6179000	Even if they have a Dragon Con this year,
6179000	6181000	it's going to be weird,
6181000	6184000	like, because I bet none of the celebrities
6184000	6186000	are going to end up there.
6186000	6188000	There's not going to be a parade.
6188000	6190000	There's still going to be a lot of panels and stuff,
6190000	6192000	and that's where I'm struggling,
6192000	6195000	because actually right now I'm still supposed to go to Dragon Con,
6195000	6197000	but I made a promise.
6197000	6199000	I said I'm not making any calls
6199000	6202000	until July,
6202000	6204000	because that's 60 days out,
6204000	6206000	and we're going to know more in July,
6206000	6208000	and I still stand by that.
6208000	6210000	Right now, my gut just kind of says,
6210000	6212000	I don't see, even in the state,
6212000	6214000	like, how it's going to happen,
6214000	6217000	but we'll see.
6217000	6219000	I mean, they might...
6219000	6221000	It just seems like they would stand to almost lose more money
6221000	6224000	putting on an event that is just, like,
6224000	6227000	not at the level they usually do,
6227000	6229000	but, I mean, we'll see.
6229000	6231000	There's still a lot can change in the next few weeks.
6231000	6233000	We'll see what happens.
6233000	6235000	All right, after all,
6235000	6239000	our world changed in the scope of about three weeks, right?
6239000	6241000	So, who knows?
6241000	6243000	And that's why I've been very big on it.
6243000	6245000	I'm not going to commit one way or the other.
6245000	6247000	It might sound like I'm being very negative on things,
6247000	6249000	but our world changed in three weeks.
6249000	6251000	Who's to say it's not going to change again?
6251000	6253000	So that's where my mind is at,
6253000	6255000	is I don't want to make any rash decisions
6255000	6257000	as fast as possible.
6257000	6259000	All right, let's move on, however, for now
6259000	6262000	and talk about maybe now some good news,
6262000	6264000	some games doing some good stuff, right?
6264000	6266000	I mean, I don't know if it's necessarily good news,
6266000	6268000	but it's interesting.
6268000	6272000	So it's a new treatment for ADHD
6272000	6276000	that is a video game that requires a prescription.
6276000	6281000	So it's apparently targeted for kids with ADHD symptoms
6281000	6284000	between the age of 8 and 12,
6284000	6288000	and it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
6288000	6292000	The game, called EndeavorRx,
6292000	6296000	uses a combination of sensory and motor challenges
6296000	6301000	to help the player improve cognitive functioning.
6301000	6303000	Interesting, though, that it also notes
6303000	6307000	that the game is based on study by doctors
6307000	6310000	who were on the developer's payroll.
6310000	6312000	And let's be honest, I looked at, I mean,
6312000	6314000	I don't know the intricacies of this game,
6314000	6317000	but based on the short 30-second trailer that they had,
6317000	6321000	it doesn't look any different than any other, like,
6321000	6325000	it doesn't look like it's something that's extremely unique.
6325000	6330000	So I'm surprised that this would be a,
6330000	6333000	something that would be offered as a prescription.
6333000	6338000	Because I can only imagine how expensive that would be.
6338000	6341000	I don't know. It just, it seems a little ridiculous.
6341000	6344000	But it's something that I think we've seen
6344000	6347000	that there have been studies that show that gaming
6347000	6350000	can help with some of these symptoms,
6350000	6353000	but I don't necessarily think it's only this game
6353000	6354000	can help with the symptoms.
6354000	6356000	I think it's just, in general,
6356000	6361000	and this happens to be something that seems to be taking on,
6361000	6364000	I don't know, it sounds like there might be some manipulation
6364000	6369000	going on here in order to get past that FDA approval.
6369000	6372000	And I think it's also worth noting, though,
6372000	6374000	that just a prescription doesn't necessarily,
6374000	6376000	isn't necessarily going to make it more expensive.
6376000	6378000	Like, I don't know, but there's a lot of cheap stuff
6378000	6379000	you have to get prescription for.
6379000	6381000	Like, penicillin is dirt cheap,
6381000	6383000	and a lot of those antibiotics are dirt cheap.
6383000	6386000	And like, when I had my dental surgery recently,
6386000	6389000	they gave me prescription ibuprofen, which is cheap,
6389000	6391000	and some mouthwash that's also cheap.
6391000	6393000	So not everything that requires a prescription
6393000	6395000	is necessarily expensive.
6395000	6398000	Although, I would imagine this is priced like a normal game,
6398000	6402000	is probably priced, but it is interesting about the whole,
6402000	6408000	huh, some of the doctors are also, it's interesting.
6408000	6411000	Like, they give you an idea of like, you know,
6411000	6413000	some of the things, the gameplay of this.
6413000	6418000	So the gameplay is designed very much like a mobile runner game,
6418000	6421000	where basically you have free pass and you have to dodge
6421000	6424000	or collect things along those paths.
6424000	6425000	And that's all it is.
6425000	6428000	Like, you can't tell me that this is a unique idea.
6428000	6433000	It's literally hundreds, if not thousands of games out there
6433000	6434000	are like this.
6434000	6438000	I mean, it's just, I don't know.
6438000	6440000	I just, I would worry that like,
6440000	6443000	because it is something that requires a prescription,
6443000	6445000	leads me to believe that, you know,
6445000	6448000	even stuff that has to do with like,
6448000	6451000	other therapies that are out there can be expensive,
6451000	6453000	especially when you're going through like, you know,
6453000	6456000	insurance or through anything that has to do with the medical
6456000	6460000	professions, because, you know, they're going to say, oh, well,
6460000	6462000	there's development costs and stuff like that.
6462000	6465000	And I could just see a higher price tag than what actually this
6465000	6468000	should be applied to this. And I'm worried that, you know,
6468000	6470000	with folks wondering for like,
6470000	6474000	trying to find good treatments for something like this,
6474000	6478000	which I am not even sure if like ADHD gets diagnosed like way too
6478000	6479000	much anyways, but.
6479000	6481000	I do. I do want to quickly jump in Loki,
6481000	6482000	because I think it's still 100.
6482000	6484000	Matt has a very important comment about, you know,
6484000	6487000	what this game really does and the intent as to 100.
6487000	6490000	Matt in our chat says to emphasize the point of the game,
6490000	6493000	isn't to buy, play it and expected to just treat ADHD.
6493000	6496000	He's not going to, it's not going to be like a cure or, you know,
6496000	6499000	is it not by itself going to do anything?
6499000	6503000	The point is to play the game in the presence of a clinician,
6503000	6506000	therapist, doctor, so forth.
6506000	6510000	So you can work with that person to process with them different
6510000	6512000	strategies to work through.
6512000	6516000	Now that makes a lot of sense because if you think about it,
6516000	6518000	think about all those types of things that like,
6518000	6521000	if you're treating certain types of, you know,
6521000	6523000	mental or even certain type of physical conditions,
6523000	6526000	there are all sorts of different tests, right? Like, you know, every,
6526000	6529000	everybody knows like the ink blot test. Okay.
6529000	6532000	And I'm obviously like oversimplifying something, but like, you know,
6532000	6536000	you got to buy those cards, those paintings of the ink blot somewhere.
6536000	6539000	Right. Or the eye tests you do at the doctor.
6539000	6543000	That book, the eye test, they got to come from somewhere. Right.
6543000	6548000	So even something like a game being used in treatment still has to come
6548000	6550000	from somewhere. Does that make sense?
6550000	6551000	That makes sense. Yes.
6551000	6553000	So I think that is like, this isn't just, Oh,
6553000	6557000	you're going to have to buy this on steam, but pick up your, you know,
6557000	6559000	file your prescription before you buy it. No,
6559000	6560000	it's not going to be like that at all.
6560000	6562000	I think it's going to be the type of thing where it is.
6562000	6565000	And I think as Joe and Hunter Matt kind of puts that really great into
6565000	6569000	perspective, it's another tool, like a book, like a test,
6569000	6574000	like a game that's used in a clinician's office when meeting with the
6574000	6578000	patient. So as Joe and her mat says,
6578000	6581000	someone can play this game and many may help them focus better,
6581000	6584000	but that person has no idea why it's helping them focus.
6584000	6589000	Working with that clinician will help that person process what they're
6589000	6591000	experiencing. So.
6592000	6595000	All right, let's move on. Oh, are you muted again?
6595000	6598000	Logie or did I just lose you for a second? That was weird.
6598000	6601000	No, I, I'm sorry. There's people walking in out here.
6601000	6606000	So it was okay. I understand you got a lot of busy stuff going on at home.
6606000	6610000	Okay, let's move on. And I'm going to talk a little bit about Duke Nukem 3d.
6610000	6613000	That's right. We're still going with the Duke Nukem news.
6613000	6616000	I feel like every month coming out of here on the switch, we've had something.
6616000	6617000	Yeah, that's it. That's it.
6617000	6622000	That's it. That's it. Uh, the 20th anniversary world tour is coming out on switch.
6622000	6626000	Uh, I believe the 20th anniversary world tour already exists on like PlayStation,
6626000	6630000	Xbox platforms, but it's coming out on the switch as well.
6630000	6633000	It's going to have eight new levels, uh, which is our,
6633000	6635000	these are already in the prior versions,
6635000	6637000	but if you weren't familiar with the 20th anniversary world tour,
6637000	6641000	there's an all new episode five in the game. Uh,
6641000	6645000	this is a company by new music from the composer, from the original game,
6645000	6649000	new voice lines from John St. John. So, I mean, it's,
6649000	6653000	it's just literally like more Duke Nukem 3d stuff. Uh,
6653000	6658000	the switch port will have optional gyro aiming if you're into that HD rumble
6658000	6662000	motion controls and local wireless multiplayer. So it's kind of cool because again,
6662000	6666000	the switch is the closest thing we have to like land gaming on a console in a
6666000	6670000	way. So it's kind of neat. Uh, and there's also going to be a remaster toggle.
6670000	6674000	So you can play the game with the original visuals or the enhanced ones.
6674000	6677000	That's pretty cool too. Like it sounds like what we saw, like in the wonderboy,
6677000	6681000	uh, uh, dragon's trap and all that stuff. So that's pretty rad. Now, uh,
6681000	6685000	the game will be available for nine 99, uh,
6685000	6688000	but five bucks for a limited time. If you want to grab that a little bit early,
6688000	6691000	that's pretty cool. Uh, now what box? Yeah.
6691000	6693000	What's interesting about this, uh,
6693000	6697000	there's a whole other lawsuit going on now,
6697000	6701000	uh, because of the 20th anniversary world tour. Uh,
6701000	6705000	apparently gearbox was supposed to have Duke Nukem free and clear of copyright
6705000	6710000	infringement when it originally acquired the franchise from Apogee software
6710000	6715000	in 2010. But apparently the original composer, uh,
6715000	6719000	sued and there's still some unresolved liabilities from this whole thing. Um,
6719000	6723000	so it's, it's still going on. Have you been following any of this at all? Loki?
6724000	6728000	No, I haven't. Unfortunately. Um, you know, it's,
6728000	6731000	it's, it's Duke Nukem. And unfortunately, you know,
6731000	6736000	after Duke Nukem forever came out, it's like kinda, eh, I, I, I lost,
6736000	6738000	lost interest in that franchise. I mean,
6738000	6741000	unless we get like a brand new Duke Nukem game or something,
6741000	6743000	that's completely, you know,
6744000	6748000	it has that same punch as like Duke Nukem 3d did. Um,
6749000	6752000	I can't really be too excited about it, but now like, you know,
6752000	6756000	so we're talking about gearbox and I just, you know, brandy pitch for it.
6756000	6758000	I can't, I can't anymore.
6761000	6764000	That is the truth. I'm also at an, I can't situation with him as well.
6766000	6769000	All right. Sorry. I was typing in a quick comment in our chat room.
6769000	6771000	Sometimes I multitask. Let's move on.
6771000	6773000	We have just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up, uh,
6773000	6775000	for further chat comments in our listener round table,
6775000	6778000	as well as maybe some last minute stories if we have any. But first,
6778000	6780000	we have a couple other scheduled things. Loki.
6780000	6784000	Yes. In a page of, I it's 2020.
6784000	6786000	So of course this is going to happen. Uh,
6786000	6790000	Guinness has recently announced that as of June 10th,
6791000	6796000	it has decided to reinstate Billy Mitchell's previously removed high scores
6796000	6799000	and achievements for donkey calling and pac-man. Um,
6799000	6803000	and they did this really produced video starring, um,
6803000	6805000	Billy Mitchell as well. Um,
6805000	6810000	talking about how they had some eye witnesses and some additional analysis
6810000	6815000	done don't really seem to mention what exactly that was that they did or
6815000	6816000	who or what,
6816000	6821000	but apparently they felt that that was merited that they should reinstate
6821000	6824000	those high scores. And then it's, it's, uh, you know,
6824000	6828000	a good half of it of Billy Mitchell just talking up himself and how he's the,
6828000	6833000	he's the original e-sports, you know, contender and stuff. Um,
6834000	6838000	good for him, I guess. I, this is just weird. I don't know.
6838000	6842000	It doesn't really change anything with the twin galaxy stuff. So, yeah.
6842000	6846000	And then Guinness is kind of as it is. So I,
6846000	6849000	I know some people are really upset with this news,
6849000	6854000	but at the same time this is news that can now power your anti Billy Mitchell
6854000	6859000	YouTube channel for like the next three years because there are entire YouTube
6859000	6863000	channels dedicated to this stuff. And
6864000	6868000	I'm like, I don't want to sound shady or mean like people are into whatever
6868000	6872000	they're into and that's cool. But I'm also like, it's,
6872000	6876000	it's a fucking video game and this is coming from the,
6876000	6879000	this is coming from the guy who's been doing a podcast for 18 years. Okay.
6879000	6884000	Like I, like, I just don't like, I don't care either way.
6884000	6888000	Like I don't want, this is not like a, a thing I'm gonna pick sides on.
6888000	6893000	It's just, it's like, I just don't care. Like, okay, cool.
6893000	6897000	You know, maybe it was me, maybe it wasn't me. He plays,
6897000	6901000	he plays a great game of donkey calling and Pac-Man. I'm not going to contend
6901000	6905000	that, you know, con or contest that. Like, who cares?
6905000	6908000	I just don't care. I really don't. And
6911000	6915000	it's fine. You know, good for him. I mean,
6915000	6919000	hopefully he's a nice guy. He actually thinks about, he is a nice guy.
6919000	6922000	I've, I've met him completely,
6922000	6925000	completely out of the context of any of this stuff,
6925000	6929000	completely out of the context of any of this stuff I've, I've met. He's just,
6929000	6934000	he's, he's a normal fucking person when there's no camera. So like,
6934000	6939000	I don't know. Like, I really don't care. I'm glad that he's got some resolution here.
6939000	6942000	So at the very least, he's got his Guinness world records. And honestly,
6942000	6944000	if you're asking, you know, Joe Schmo on the street,
6944000	6948000	they're going to know what Guinness is versus twin galaxies any day of the week.
6948000	6949000	So that's probably,
6949000	6953000	maybe that's a little bit more important to him than say twin galaxies,
6953000	6956000	but good for him, I guess. I mean,
6956000	6959000	he fought the hard fight and he's back in there.
6959000	6963000	So I don't know. I'll let the drama be drama.
6963000	6966000	I don't need to deal with it. Very good point. Um,
6966000	6971000	Questbuster in chat says a comment on an article by Ars Technica covering this
6971000	6976000	suggested that the threshold for persuasive proof was much higher on Guinness's
6976000	6980000	side. So they needed more to remove his records than it was for twin galaxies.
6980000	6985000	And yeah, I, I've been hearing that take on it as well. And, um,
6985000	6990000	it makes sense. But at the same time, like, I'm just kind of like, I,
6990000	6992000	there's so many other things going on in our industry.
6992000	6996000	Why are we still fighting about this Billy Mitchell thing? Like it's,
6996000	7000000	it's exhausting everyone. I'm exhausted. I'm tired.
7001000	7004000	I need a nap. Anyhow. All right.
7005000	7009000	Let's move on to news. Now, this is a blast from the past that I welcome.
7009000	7012000	This is, I think, I think I do.
7012000	7016000	Cause I have many fond memories when I see this title involved and that is that
7016000	7020000	micro pros is back. Micro pros.
7020000	7025000	Now the reason why I remember micro pros is because that was the company logo on
7025000	7029000	the loading screen of the all time. Great Sid Myers civilization.
7030000	7034000	Uh, I'm talking about the very first one on the PC years and years ago and pretty
7034000	7038000	much all the Sid Meyer games, uh, covert action, railroad tycoon, all that stuff.
7038000	7040000	Those are all micro pros games back in the day. Uh,
7040000	7043000	micro pros put out a lot of awesome games back in the day. Uh,
7043000	7048000	and then in 2019 the micro pros brand was bought by, uh,
7048000	7052000	a ex Bohemia interactive developer, David Ligeti, uh,
7052000	7054000	and was revived in Australia.
7054000	7059000	Now the new micro pros has signed a publishing deal with Drakeling Labs,
7060000	7063000	uh, for their games. Uh, there's two games that they're working on.
7063000	7068000	One is called Operation Harsh Doorstop and the other is Warfare 1944.
7069000	7073000	Operation Harsh Doorstop is a competitive multiplayer game, um,
7074000	7078000	that does not have any microtransactions paid DLC or loot box mechanic.
7078000	7080000	Well, that's worth celebrating. Uh,
7080000	7084000	it is a game that's set in East Afghanistan and revolves around a fictional
7084000	7088000	conflict between Soviet and NATO forces in the summer of 1991.
7088000	7092000	Warfare 1944 on the other hand is a World War II tactical shooter,
7092000	7094000	as you can imagine by the name. Uh,
7094000	7098000	and that is going to be going into steam early access on July 7th. So, uh,
7098000	7102000	sadly it doesn't seem like micro pros is still in the business of Sid Meyer
7102000	7104000	games, but that makes sense. I mean,
7104000	7108000	like 2K has been putting out the Sid games for quite some time. Uh,
7108000	7111000	and so yeah, they're not going to be putting out those types of games anymore,
7111000	7115000	but they are working on a new strategy game, uh, Task Force Admiral, uh,
7115000	7119000	another tactics game called Second Front. So, uh, who knows,
7119000	7121000	perhaps the days of the tactical games, uh,
7121000	7125000	and strategy games for micro pros are not quite in the past, but for now,
7125000	7127000	we're going to see that name attached a little more towards, uh,
7127000	7131000	first person shooters a little bit there. Uh, looking in chat, uh,
7131000	7133000	Quest Buster says, wow, micro pros,
7133000	7137000	one of the war game gods back in the day along with SSI. Yeah. Uh,
7137000	7141000	I am Canadian says micro pros was fantastic and had super
7141000	7145000	detailed manuals. Heck yeah. And, uh, um, the, uh,
7145000	7148000	manuals oftentimes with the copy protection as well.
7148000	7150000	I remember that being a thing in covert action,
7150000	7153000	which was a very underrated Sid Meyer game, just FYI.
7153000	7156000	No, I've said that before, but I'm going to say it again. All right.
7156000	7160000	I think that is it for the news that we had scheduled tonight,
7160000	7165000	but we are going to welcome your questions in our chat room over at twitch TV
7165000	7167000	slash vog network.
7167000	7171000	If you have any extra questions for us here before we wrap up tonight, um,
7171000	7174000	while I'm waiting to see if we get any questions in chat or if there's
7174000	7176000	something you want us to talk about, or you have an opinion,
7176000	7178000	you want to get out there, shout that out in our chat room.
7178000	7181000	We'll get that out here. I don't know if we have any last minute stories.
7181000	7183000	If Loki wants to get into those.
7183000	7186000	I was just going to mention, let's see,
7186000	7190000	I was going to say that there is a Nintendo direct tomorrow for, uh,
7190000	7194000	smash brothers. We're supposed to learn which arms characters smash brothers.
7194000	7197000	Yeah. It's specifically the arms one, right? Yes.
7197000	7201000	So that's going to take place tomorrow. So look forward to that.
7201000	7206000	Uh, apparently there's a sequel for desert golfing,
7206000	7209000	which is one of the early, uh, earliest mobile games.
7209000	7213000	It's called golf on Mars. So that's coming to mobile. Huh?
7213000	7218000	Uh, pretty neat. And, uh, yeah, that's all I got.
7218000	7220000	All right. That's all you got, huh?
7220000	7224000	Any thoughts on who the arms character might be that they end up adding?
7224000	7227000	I don't even know who any of the arms characters are. Like I don't know.
7227000	7232000	Twintania is the one I see a lot on Twitter. So, but I, uh,
7232000	7236000	also Twintania, if I remember right, does not fight with arms.
7236000	7241000	So that might not work out. So I don't know. Um, okay.
7241000	7242000	So we've got some questions. Okay.
7242000	7244000	Actually I'm really glad this question came up.
7244000	7247000	Phoenix 77 26 says any thoughts on the last of us too,
7247000	7249000	because we didn't get into that game tonight.
7249000	7252000	And I know that was a huge release for this week. Um, and I,
7252000	7255000	I apologize because I talked about it with Bobby at the end of his show.
7255000	7258000	I kind of like in my mind, I was like, Oh, I've already talked about that. Um,
7258000	7262000	I didn't pick up the last of us too, and I'm very likely not going to.
7262000	7266000	And here's the thing. It's nothing like I hear the game is great. Um,
7266000	7271000	and the accessibility stuff sounds phenomenal and is worth acknowledging and
7271000	7273000	recognizing that being said,
7273000	7276000	I think there's a level of violence in the game that I'm just,
7276000	7279000	I'm kind of exhausted on. I'm kind of over it and I'm not yet.
7279000	7284000	I know it's weird to hear me probably say like the game is just too violent,
7284000	7286000	but that's, that's the real, real thing.
7286000	7289000	Like I'm just not into the gore violence and,
7289000	7294000	and animal stuff and all that stuff. And I realize it's,
7294000	7297000	it's kind of one of the points of the game and it's something about the
7297000	7301000	narrative and so forth. But I also kind of recognize, like, I just,
7301000	7305000	there are thousands of games, literally thousands of games out there.
7305000	7309000	And that's just one narrative I'm just not interested in right now. Um,
7309000	7312000	and I was talking about this on Bobby a little bit is that, you know,
7312000	7314000	it's kind of like horror movies.
7314000	7319000	Like I think those saw movies are the dumbest,
7319000	7323000	most heinous thing I can possibly think of. Uh, when it comes to movies,
7323000	7328000	I have no interest in those films, but I know other people love them. Uh,
7328000	7330000	other people, I, I,
7330000	7334000	I volunteer a lot with the SAC horror film Fest here locally,
7334000	7336000	which is the most ironic fucking thing,
7336000	7341000	but horror and cult really intersect a lot. And I get that.
7341000	7345000	But that being said, the gore side of stuff just really isn't for me.
7345000	7347000	I don't like it. I don't like those saw movies.
7347000	7350000	And so it's kind of like that same sort of thing. I,
7350000	7355000	but there is a big difference between what I'm saying and that saw
7355000	7359000	movies shouldn't exist. The last of us two shouldn't exist.
7359000	7360000	I'm not saying that at all.
7361000	7365000	I think those of y'all that like that and enjoy that have fun.
7365000	7370000	Meanwhile, I've got a hundred hours still left on Xenoblade. I'm good.
7370000	7372000	I'm taken care of. What about you? Loki? What are,
7372000	7374000	where are you at with the last of us too?
7374000	7377000	Is that something that's up your alley or what I never played the first one?
7377000	7381000	So the second one doesn't really make a difference to me.
7381000	7384000	I've watched some reviews regarding it. Um, you know,
7384000	7387000	aside from just the folks kind of, um,
7387000	7391000	getting angry over the fact that there's a strong female protagonist or that
7391000	7396000	there's, you know, um, LGBTQ,
7396000	7399000	like elements to the game. Um,
7399000	7404000	there's like writing issues that folks are having issues with and being
7404000	7408000	fans of the original game. Um, I don't know.
7408000	7412000	All that seems like drama to me. Like I, I just,
7412000	7416000	I never played the first one. So I, I hear it's a good game.
7416000	7420000	Um, I don't know what the second one got good reviews,
7420000	7423000	um, in the press,
7423000	7425000	but a lot of the user reviews are kind of negative,
7425000	7427000	but that seems to be the case a lot of times.
7427000	7432000	I will wait usually and see what some of the trusted like YouTube reviewers that
7432000	7433000	I watch, you know,
7433000	7436000	that share the same opinions with like me on games is to like see what they say.
7436000	7439000	But even after I see that I probably still won't play because I didn't play the
7439000	7441000	first one. And there's a lot of series that I don't play.
7441000	7443000	I haven't played any of the charted games.
7443000	7445000	I haven't played any of the last of us that I haven't played, uh,
7445000	7447000	until dawn except for rush of blood.
7447000	7452000	There's a lot of like big series games that have come out that I just haven't
7452000	7453000	gotten into.
7453000	7454000	Yeah.
7454000	7457000	There's a lot of those like user negative reviews stuff.
7457000	7460000	I think a lot of that is motivated because people are like,
7460000	7461000	Ew,
7461000	7466000	it's LGBT content and it's an agenda and it's being shoved in my face and blah,
7466000	7467000	blah, like fuck off.
7467000	7472000	Like the heterosexuality of agenda has been shoved in my face for many,
7472000	7476000	many years and I don't complain. So just, it's not, it's,
7476000	7479000	it's so dumb. So I, and again, like I,
7479000	7484000	I think it's great that there are the LGBT et cetera themes in the game and so
7484000	7486000	forth. And I think that's cool. And I can, I, you know,
7486000	7489000	there's one hand and I can say, I love that that exists.
7489000	7492000	I think that's great that that's a thing. These accessibility options,
7492000	7495000	that's fucking amazing. That being said, not for me.
7495000	7498000	Not for me. So I,
7498000	7503000	I will have to try that all somewhere else because the hope is that those,
7503000	7507000	those themes and the, the, the, um, the, the accessibility option,
7507000	7511000	that stuff is, is, is well received by the masses.
7511000	7514000	Cause we all know the bullshit on, uh,
7514000	7517000	user reviews and stuff is just angry basement dwellers. And there,
7517000	7520000	it's not reflective of what people really think because most people that play
7520000	7524000	these games aren't on video game websites. That's the reality of it. So, um,
7525000	7529000	you know, it's, it w I imagine the stuff will be strong enough that we'll see,
7529000	7530000	uh,
7530000	7534000	more games that aren't necessarily about like zombies and violence and things
7534000	7538000	like that. And I think that'll be cool. Um, dark Tetsuya says,
7538000	7540000	I'm inclined to agree on the violence. I mean,
7540000	7543000	it was one thing when it was Mortal Kombat two or Grand Theft Auto,
7543000	7546000	but there's more recent stuff is definitely on another level.
7546000	7550000	It's almost just too much at times. Uh, bonds, double six says, LOL.
7550000	7554000	Each final destination film game, everyone a reason to be Leary, the TV,
7554000	7556000	the fridge, the stove piece. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7556000	7561000	I saw that first final destination film and it was wow. Uh,
7561000	7565000	and then all I heard about the second one is that it will never make you want
7565000	7568000	to drive on the freeway ever again. And that was enough for me. And, but,
7568000	7572000	but see, here's the thing. I married a guy who loves those things.
7572000	7576000	He watches death scene compilations on YouTube and that stuff.
7576000	7578000	And he loves that stuff. That's fine.
7578000	7581000	And I love that he watches it on YouTube because it's on his phone where I
7581000	7585000	don't have to look at it. So that's fine. Um,
7585000	7590000	and I understand those movies are for a certain crowd and that's cool.
7590000	7595000	It's just not me. Have fun. All right.
7595000	7599000	Yeah. I am Canadian and chat says all that matters is if the story moves you,
7599000	7602000	then it's worth trying. But if you find it too emotionally draining,
7602000	7605000	then maybe not since it brings you down too much. Yeah. So I don't know.
7605000	7609000	Like I don't want to speak negatively of the last of us too. Uh,
7609000	7614000	it's just, I can look at it and go, not for me. Uh, let's see.
7614000	7615000	There were a couple other questions.
7615000	7619000	So that was a great conversation in chat though. Um,
7619000	7621000	I am Canadian asked,
7621000	7626000	has anyone played Sid Meyer pirates or micro pros game called airborne ranger?
7626000	7631000	I did play Sid Meyer's pirates. I think they reinvented that game.
7631000	7634000	I think they had to drop his name because he wasn't involved,
7634000	7638000	but I think they redid it as a game called pirates about 10 years ago,
7638000	7641000	maybe longer. My memories. So I want to say it was a game.
7641000	7643000	I saw it like one of the first E threes I went to.
7643000	7646000	That would have been about 15 years ago. Uh,
7646000	7649000	and I did play a little bit of that. Uh, and I did play,
7649000	7651000	I do remember playing the original a little bit,
7651000	7654000	but not as much as I played railroad tycoon and especially civilization,
7654000	7659000	but I loved railroad tycoon. That game was great. So, uh,
7659000	7663000	Phoenix 77 26 says pirates was one of my faves when I was a lot younger.
7663000	7666000	Yeah. So there's that. Do you, have you,
7666000	7667000	do you remember any of these, uh,
7667000	7672000	strategical classic games for micro pros Loki or no, not, not ringing about.
7672000	7675000	I never really played that stuff. I mean, um,
7675000	7677000	I don't know. Like the,
7677000	7682000	the most I would get into any sort of strategy would be just like the classic
7682000	7683000	SIM city. I,
7683000	7688000	I really never got into a lot of the S the strategy or management Sims and
7688000	7691000	stuff like that. I'm aware of them and just never played them.
7692000	7694000	Phoenix 77 26 and chat says, Rob,
7694000	7697000	did you ever show your dad railroad tycoon and what did he think? Yeah.
7697000	7700000	I don't know if you're remembering that my dad actually worked on the railroad
7700000	7704000	for many years. He retired from that industry. So I don't know. Um, he,
7704000	7707000	I remember him saying, yes, I do remember showing it to him.
7708000	7711000	I remember showing him an old ass Commodore 64 game.
7711000	7714000	I want to say the original a train was on the Commodore 64 and I remember
7714000	7717000	showing that to him. Uh, and it was one of those things where he goes, huh,
7718000	7722000	that's neat. Or like, Oh, that's pretty cool. And then it was like, okay,
7722000	7726000	turn around and leave. But my dad, my dad never really got into game.
7726000	7729000	My dad was never a gamer at all. And it's, it's,
7729000	7733000	I don't even think today my dad really plays games that just for whatever
7733000	7738000	reason, isn't it ironic that here I am. But, um,
7738000	7743000	he was, I will say what my dad was into that will make you giggle.
7743000	7744000	He might not have been in a games.
7744000	7748000	He was always really into like radio and, uh,
7748000	7752000	ham radio, trucker radio, shortwave.
7752000	7757000	He had one of those like radio things that was like am F way FM
7757000	7761000	shortwave with a blue, a green, a yellow, and like all these things.
7761000	7762000	I don't even know.
7762000	7766000	And like I remember he could tune into a radio station that was in like fucking
7766000	7770000	Russia or something like on the other side of the globe and was able to hear
7770000	7772000	stuff on it. And that was the type of stuff he thought was interesting.
7772000	7777000	So, um, I also think he used to listen to a lot of Art Bell.
7777000	7778000	I don't think he really talked about it,
7778000	7782000	but I think he did just based on like what stations the radios are often tuned
7782000	7785000	to. So I think he might be into that type of like, I don't know.
7785000	7787000	He's probably, probably knows where all the aliens are at.
7787000	7789000	Um, but I've never really bothered to ask.
7789000	7794000	Uh, Phoenix 77 26 says, I guess he has a big antenna bolted to the house.
7794000	7798000	Um, not that I can think of. I am Canadian says shortwave,
7799000	7803000	ham and CB radio is big up here. And that makes a lot of sense because, uh,
7803000	7807000	assuming your name is not a lie and you are in fact Canadian and perhaps you are
7807000	7810000	a Canadian who lives out a little, you know,
7810000	7815000	further north where stuff is so spread out and there's just so,
7815000	7820000	but like that's the type of radio that gets from city to city or that covers
7820000	7823000	such a large, large area. Uh,
7823000	7826000	sometimes we forget just how big Canada is.
7826000	7830000	I know that seems like such a silly thing to say, but it's so true.
7830000	7835000	Like, like Canada's pretty fucking huge. Uh, and so, you know,
7835000	7839000	it makes sense that a lot of that shortwave and stuff is how you get,
7839000	7844000	and a lot of that applies in Alaska as well. A lot of that same type of logic.
7844000	7848000	So my dad was always kind of into that stuff. Yeah. Um,
7851000	7855000	uh, ask him if he ever talked to a particular call sign on his ham.
7855000	7860000	I don't think he had a license to operate it.
7861000	7865000	So I don't think he ever talked to people, but I think he listened.
7867000	7870000	I don't know. So here's the thing. His other big thing is genealogy.
7870000	7875000	My dad is like huge into genealogy and I probably shouldn't give away too much,
7875000	7879000	but he like is part of like genealogy groups.
7879000	7882000	So his big, this is what always interested to him.
7882000	7887000	He loved ways he could scan pictures into the computer, uh,
7887000	7890000	scan documents, add records,
7890000	7894000	family tree maker and those types of programs when they would get new updates
7894000	7895000	and those types of things,
7895000	7899000	how to search for things online at the library and using things like Lexis
7899000	7902000	Nexus. That's the type of stuff that would make him perk up.
7902000	7906000	He's super into genealogy and that type of stuff.
7906000	7911000	So, um, those are, those are the things that I would associate more than, uh,
7911000	7915000	uh, gaming. So, uh, Phoenix 7726 says,
7915000	7919000	Rob is secretly related to some Dutch nobles or something. Well, I'm actually,
7919000	7923000	my heritage is a large part Dutch. So it's,
7923000	7927000	it's Dutch and it's Scottish, which you could probably see in the beard a little
7927000	7932000	bit. So there you go. Uh, Phoenix says, so he's a huge data nerd then. Cool.
7932000	7933000	Yeah. I think that's a good way to put it. He's,
7933000	7937000	he's definitely a bit of a data nerd. So, all right.
7937000	7940000	Anyway, I don't mind talking about my dad though. It's father's day.
7940000	7945000	Was your dad a gamer, Logie? Um, he's would say no.
7945000	7947000	But then again, he's the one that had all the,
7947000	7951000	the Coleco vision in like 60 games.
7951000	7954000	So I don't know if it's just because they got that cheap during the video game
7954000	7958000	crash or what, but they were all his games. So I don't know.
7958000	7962000	Yeah. Technically the Commodore 64 was my dad's machine,
7962000	7965000	but I guarantee you I use that machine at the age of like five or six.
7965000	7968000	There's a picture of me out there somewhere and I've got to find it and I'll,
7968000	7972000	I'll show it on the show sometime. I'm like five years old and I'm, I'm,
7972000	7977000	I'm five years old and I'm sitting in front of the 64 and I'm typing at it and
7977000	7981000	I'm looking at a magazine typing in the thing I see in the magazine.
7981000	7985000	So that's like an early picture of me that exists out there somewhere.
7985000	7988000	So yeah, I always use that thing way more than he,
7988000	7991000	and then he wouldn't need me to show him how to use like the word processor or
7991000	7996000	something like that. So I tried typing out stuff that was in a book as well one
7996000	7998000	time. So like I had the, um,
7999000	8003000	I had the TI 85 and then, um, I had like the,
8003000	8007000	the tape deck that came with it. And because I was, you know,
8007000	8011000	a kid and my parents weren't necessarily familiar with how like technology
8011000	8012000	works, you know,
8012000	8016000	all I was familiar with the tape deck was like I listen to music on this,
8016000	8019000	like, but somehow this hooks up to the computer.
8019000	8023000	And then so we ended up doing accidentally is hitting the record button and
8023000	8027000	erasing part of the tape. But the tape was of course storage for the programs,
8027000	8031000	you're supposed to hit play. Then the computer receives, you know, the,
8031000	8034000	the analog signal and it converts it into actual coding language.
8034000	8038000	But I didn't know how any of that worked because like it's a tape deck,
8038000	8041000	like it's music. So I had the book that came with it though,
8041000	8042000	with all the coding.
8042000	8045000	And one of the things I was really interested in was the mini golf game that
8045000	8047000	was in there. It was a basic. And then,
8047000	8052000	so I didn't really bother typing it into a TI basic for
8052000	8055000	a while, but I still have that book. And then later on,
8055000	8058000	when we got a brand new, you know,
8058000	8063000	what was that a three 86 20 computer,
8063000	8067000	I had Q basic in DOS. And so I was like, well, this is about this.
8067000	8070000	It's basic. It's the same. So I typed it all in.
8070000	8073000	It didn't work because no, not all basic is the same,
8073000	8076000	even though it has the word basic and it is not the same programming language.
8076000	8079000	So, so yeah,
8079000	8084000	uh, I wish I had more of those magazines around that time.
8084000	8086000	And I wish I understood how that stuff worked because I really wanted to play
8086000	8089000	that, that, uh, mini golf game.
8089000	8092000	One of these days, one of these days. All right.
8092000	8095000	Those are, those are some good questions and a fun trip down memory lane.
8095000	8099000	Thanks you guys in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
8099000	8102000	But if Loki is out of last minute stories, I am too.
8102000	8106000	And I think that means it's time. One last one, one last one, please.
8106000	8110000	Another, another, uh, lead to what we may be getting in game announcements,
8110000	8112000	but apparently this last week,
8112000	8117000	the URL suicide squad game.com has been registered.
8117000	8122000	So I guess we should expect a suicide squad game to be announced at some
8122000	8126000	point. So we'll have to wait and see pretty interesting.
8126000	8129000	They tend to be surprised when they announce it. All right.
8129000	8132000	Coming soon, maybe. All right.
8132000	8136000	All right. Uh, Phoenix 77 26 says, did that Avengers game get axed? No,
8136000	8138000	it didn't. They just, they, they did push it back. Yeah.
8138000	8140000	They delayed it back. And I think again,
8140000	8144000	COVID and all that stuff came into play with that as well. So, all right.
8144000	8145000	All right. Well,
8145000	8148000	that is going to wrap it up for another night here at orange launch radio and
8148000	8150000	another week on the podcast feed.
8150000	8153000	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or watching us live.
8153000	8156000	However you participated with the show. We appreciate you guys.
8156000	8158000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio,
8158000	8161000	help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show. Uh,
8161000	8164000	we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here,
8164000	8167000	we can't, we can't air all the different thoughts. So, uh,
8167000	8170000	a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is,
8170000	8174000	you found this show, those going off a long way, uh, hosting on Twitch.
8174000	8176000	Even if you don't do a lot of streaming yourself,
8176000	8179000	host is huge for discoverability.
8179000	8182000	So we super appreciate those of you that host fog network. Unfortunately,
8182000	8185000	Twitch took away my ability to see who hosts us at this very moment.
8185000	8188000	So I can't shout you all out individually, but please know,
8188000	8191000	I do know people do do it cause I see in the stats that, Oh,
8191000	8193000	so-and-so found your channel through this. So I,
8193000	8196000	I definitely appreciate you guys that do participate. Thank you. Thank you.
8196000	8200000	Thank you. Uh, with all that and that helped us spread the word. Um,
8200000	8205000	with that, it's about time to get everybody's final thoughts. Um,
8205000	8207000	I don't know what else to say. So Loki,
8207000	8209000	we'll get your final thought and then we'll wrap up.
8209000	8213000	Uh, my final thought is I probably should work on my game.
8213000	8217000	Um, but I'll probably end up playing Minecraft instead.
8218000	8221000	But I really should work on my game. Um,
8221000	8225000	my final thought is, um, happy pride. Uh, this upcoming weekend,
8225000	8228000	I really should have been going to some pride festival somewhere or
8228000	8229000	something. Actually this coming weekend,
8229000	8232000	I think was when I had planned to go to Toronto for pride,
8232000	8234000	but COVID kind of put a stop to all that.
8234000	8236000	So that unfortunately didn't happen this year.
8236000	8238000	I've never been to Toronto. I would love to do that.
8238000	8241000	So I hope everybody has a happy pride, however, you're celebrating. Um,
8241000	8243000	and I know a lot of people are celebrating,
8243000	8245000	probably participating in a lot of the protests that are going on.
8245000	8249000	And I think that's great. Uh, obviously black lives matter.
8249000	8251000	We got to keep reminding people of that.
8251000	8254000	Even when the media is kind of moved on to some other topics, uh,
8254000	8257000	this is not something that needs to just go away.
8257000	8261000	We're going to continue to have these conversations. Um, however, again,
8261000	8263000	COVID is also still out there.
8263000	8266000	So do make sure you're wearing your mask and practicing social distancing,
8266000	8268000	but everything I've seen from those protests,
8268000	8270000	they're very well organized with that type of stuff.
8270000	8274000	So kudos and a plus and all that stuff, um, with that. So anyway, uh,
8274000	8276000	that's my thought on that. Uh,
8276000	8278000	thank you guys very much for participating with the show.
8278000	8281000	You guys are awesome. We'll be back here in seven days to do it all again.
8281000	8286000	Next week is the 18th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.
8286000	8288000	We're going to have some new things.
8288000	8290000	You've seen some things for the very last time tonight.
8290000	8292000	So, uh, we're going to,
8292000	8294000	we're going to freshen up some things under the hood next week,
8294000	8297000	and we'll see you next week to do that. That's it.
8297000	8299000	Have a good night, everybody. We'll see you next time.
