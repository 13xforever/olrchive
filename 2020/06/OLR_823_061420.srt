00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,040
This week it's nearly summer, which means the game developers, publishers, and makers

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,800
around all present their wares.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,780
This year, from a distance, introverts unite apart.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,800
Join us for the announcement, preparations, and schedule your favorites, starting right

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,520
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,120
Orange Lounge Radio Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,080
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,680
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 823 for this June the 14th

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
of 2020.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,620
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here in the studio that we've used for a little while

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,080
out of a lot of the various studios that we've used over the years.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,180
But I'm by myself as we are practicing social distancing, as is still the case right now.

13
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,320
But I am joined thanks to the magic of Discord by my co-hosts.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,680
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Hello.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Hi.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
How are you?

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm okay.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Good.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,880
I see I see still Kirby in the background.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm looking at doll legs as well.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
And there's my camera.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
I gotcha.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
But you look great.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Thank you.

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
All right.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Let's go to Techmaster Loki.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Hello.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Hi.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
And I'm trying to figure out what is that?

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Is that Mega Zeus?

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
Oh my gosh, the sequel to ZZT or something like that, right?

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
In the background with you?

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Yeah.

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
I love it.

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
So I was trying to find some interesting background.

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,560
So it was either like some weird trippy Minecraft thing that only lasts for three minutes or

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,320
a long play of Mega Zeus.

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,280
So that's what it's going to be.

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
I love it.

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm with it.

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
That's awesome.

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
All right.

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,680
Well, we have had a busy week in the gaming world.

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,160
I know we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight, so I want to get right on into

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
it.

47
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,780
We had a lot of news this week.

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,360
This would have been the week that E3 would have taken place.

49
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,800
But obviously with the situation of well, first off, E3, of course, was not it was in

50
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
a weird place as it was.

51
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,240
And then COVID happened.

52
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,780
And then it was certainly not going to happen this year.

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,280
So all the gaming companies have kind of scrambled to do their own thing.

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,240
IGN brought a lot of people together under like a summer banner.

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,840
But Sony moved forward and this week had their PlayStation 5 preview, which was originally

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
going to be last week.

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,240
But obviously with everything that's going on in the call for racial justice and equality,

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,320
which is still going on, just because you're not seeing it 24 7 on CNN doesn't mean it's

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,840
not happening.

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,880
Good friends, several friends of mine were at an L.A. protest today because they kind

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,000
of turned the L.A. pride into a huge thing for a support of Black Lives Matter and Black

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,600
trans lives matter, of course.

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,720
So all of that is still going on.

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:59,000
But some of the, you know, kind of where do we kind of fit in the other things that go

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,040
on, such as video games and recreation, trying to find the places for that appropriately.

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,440
We did have the PlayStation 5 announcement this week and there was a lot.

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
There was a lot to it.

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,400
Let me just kind of start from the top and ask my co-hosts, just generally, what were

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
your reactions to Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal?

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,200
Loki, I'll start with you.

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,160
I started watching when I thought it was supposed to be on.

72
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,680
And apparently there was like trailers that started before that time.

73
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,240
So I was a little disappointed that it didn't start when they said they were going to, at

74
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,000
least I thought.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Otherwise, content wise, yeah, that's PlayStation.

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,280
I mean, there's a few games that look pretty interesting, not necessarily the ones like

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
the mainstream stuff.

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,080
So yeah, I don't know.

79
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,280
Some of the announcements are disappointing, like seriously, Rockstar, we're going to do

80
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:02,880
Grand Theft Auto 5 again, again, you know, for a third generation of consoles.

81
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
I don't know.

82
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:10,760
We didn't know more about it, like what exactly the systems can, you know, what are the features

83
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
of the system?

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,320
And then he kind of showed some of the console and like some of the accessories for some

85
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,040
reason, no PlayStation VR, I'm kind of surprised.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,280
And yet we don't know price or release date or which of those games that they showed are

87
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,960
actually coming out at release.

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,120
Or is it going to be release window, you know, the 12 months after release or whatever?

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,760
Yeah, I mean, it looks really cool.

90
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,720
A lot of the games look pretty nice.

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,600
I don't think that they're necessarily like blowing me away with this looks drastically

92
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,920
different than like the PlayStation 4, but you know, I'll have to see.

93
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,040
And then also with these games, I mean, are they going to be coming out on PlayStation

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
4 as well?

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,840
Or is these all PlayStation 5?

96
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,840
I mean, it's just a lot of like kind of unknowns there.

97
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,240
So yeah, we'll have to see.

98
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
So maybe some more specifics on some of these scenarios would have been good for you.

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,120
Yeah, I can see that.

100
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,800
You know, we don't know exactly what is a PlayStation 5 exclusive.

101
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,640
Like I'm sure we can assume the horizon, the out west, I forgot the westward, westward

102
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
ho.

103
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,360
I forget what was the name of the horizon west life.

104
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
The horizon.

105
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
What was it?

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,200
It was horizon Forbidden West.

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Thank you.

108
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Horizon Forbidden West.

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,680
I can assume that is a PlayStation 5 exclusive.

110
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,960
Well, actually, no, I can't even assume that anymore because there's been all that rumble

111
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
rumble rabble about Zero Dawn coming to PC at some point.

112
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,220
But you know what?

113
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,120
What exactly is a PlayStation 5 exclusive?

114
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,600
I think you bring up a good point.

115
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,120
What might be available on PlayStation 4?

116
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,040
The grand theft auto 5 thing I thought certainly was going to lead into a conversation about

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,000
the larger conversation about backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 5.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,640
I thought that's how they were opening the door to that conversation.

119
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
Here's the first of all of these games.

120
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,640
And granted, yes, Sony has confirmed because there was an odd footing that happened after

121
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,080
the Mark Cerny chat that was originally GDC, where he had said the top 100 games.

122
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,000
And then Sony said, it's going to be a lot more than that.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,960
Those are just like, they kind of quickly corrected that statement.

124
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,780
But they haven't really just given us a firm what to expect of backwards compatibility.

125
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,080
We know PlayStation 4 is there in some capacity, but is it everything?

126
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
Did they get every single game?

127
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
Are there going to be some things excluded?

128
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,260
What about PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 1?

129
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,840
We know what all those details were going to be because they didn't really go into

130
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
any of that.

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,280
And I know that's because they have this whole summer thing where they're going to have more

132
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,000
announcements I'm sure, or more stuff to talk about around Gamescom and all that later in

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
the summer.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So we'll get more details then.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,080
But it's kind of annoying though.

136
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,900
It's like this drip feed of information.

137
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,420
But there's also a part of me that understands the message this episode or whatever was supposed

138
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,700
to be the games, games, games, games, and they didn't really want to deviate from that.

139
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,460
And maybe there's something to be said about what they wanted to talk about the future

140
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,940
of games and maybe not linger so much on the past.

141
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,940
But if that's the case, that Grand Theft Auto 5 was a misstep in my book, but I still found

142
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
a lot of positives.

143
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,380
However, before we go on too much longer, I definitely want to let Dark Soccer have

144
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
a say.

145
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
What was your thoughts?

146
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,580
I don't know if you watched it or saw some of the trailers.

147
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,380
What did you think, Dark Soccer?

148
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,580
I looked and saw a little bit of it.

149
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,020
I'm kind of interested in whatever the Resident Evil thing is going to be.

150
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,660
The design is fine.

151
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,060
I don't even know if that's going to be a final design because they've changed before.

152
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,060
I don't know.

153
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,260
This might sound a little bit odd, but I was really focusing more on social issues right

154
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
now.

155
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,260
No, it's not odd at all.

156
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:58,900
I've been actually doing some design work for a couple of the protest organizations.

157
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,460
Interesting point, though, about the design possibly not being finalized.

158
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,460
You're right.

159
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,020
They don't always.

160
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,260
The thing that jumps in my mind like a neon sign is the PlayStation 3 controller.

161
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,260
Remember when we first saw that at E3 years ago, it was like the boomerang.

162
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,580
I actually kind of liked the boomerang.

163
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,900
That thing was terrible.

164
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,900
I liked it.

165
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,820
It was looking at it made my hands hurt.

166
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,780
All right, five different opinions, whatever.

167
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,100
But when it comes to the console itself, I would be surprised if there was major changes.

168
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,980
But we've I mean, we've seen this thing meme-ified like crazy at this point.

169
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,420
Let me actually roll some footage, of course.

170
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,860
I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this by now, but this is what the PlayStation 5

171
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,540
like reveal actually looked like.

172
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,340
And it's if you hear some ominous music in the background, that's because it's from PlayStation's

173
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,660
official reveal on the YouTube.

174
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,820
And we've seen this thing meme-ified like crazy.

175
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:59,740
Talk about how it's an Oreo or one of those reverse ones sandwiches.

176
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,860
Talk about how it looks like a Wi-Fi router.

177
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,820
And just we've seen all cells heads.

178
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
Yes.

179
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,160
Yeah, we've seen perfect cells head.

180
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,460
And I saw, though, like one where they did like they did like human forms of the systems

181
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,460
is kind of neat.

182
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
Yeah.

183
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,020
There were some like a porned up versions, but there were some other tasteful versions

184
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,780
that it's kind of interesting to see that conceptualized.

185
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,380
But I know one that looks really high fashion, actually, that I was like, I'd wear that.

186
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,980
I have to admit, like I, I think it I like it because it's different.

187
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,140
I mean, is it the perfect, you know, figure or whatever?

188
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,140
Maybe not.

189
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,140
But I kind of like that.

190
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,180
It's not just a box, you know, and PlayStation's always well, I shouldn't say always, but they've

191
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,020
they've done some weird things before, like the PlayStation three being a form and grill.

192
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,020
Come on.

193
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,000
Like, that was a weird thing, too.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,540
And and it attracts so much dust.

195
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
It did.

196
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,500
I would I would I would rather this system not attract that much dust and this system

197
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
be quiet.

198
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
They did.

199
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Mine's still hooked up.

200
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
OK.

201
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,220
Technically, I have a PlayStation three hooked up here in the corner, but I don't even think

202
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,300
it's hooked into a television right now.

203
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,420
But anyway, I really think at the end of the day, people are not going to pass on the PlayStation

204
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,060
five because they don't like the way the console looks like.

205
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:27,780
I, I, I guess maybe you might have people that like hold out for a year because maybe

206
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,220
they're not super happy with the launch lineup.

207
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,720
And we all know there's been all these talks and all these renderings.

208
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,140
I'm sure many people have seen that Spider-Man console rendering, which it looked good in

209
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,140
red and so forth.

210
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,620
But these are all fan dreams.

211
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,460
But at some point, the console will likely come out in different colors and different

212
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,780
shapes and things like that.

213
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,860
Or maybe there'll be a mini or something.

214
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
Money.

215
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
Yeah.

216
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
And I know skins.

217
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Yeah.

218
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
And I could see people maybe holding out for that.

219
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,940
But I feel like if if there's really the games on this console, people want to play day one,

220
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,980
they'll figure out where to put that console.

221
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,500
And it's not going to be a big deal.

222
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,860
Like the look of it is not a big deal.

223
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:13,340
I wondered myself if the shape wasn't in part to do with air circulation and maybe having

224
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:19,220
the odd shape meant that the vents would have to be exposed a little bit and you wouldn't

225
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,220
maybe be able to fit it into a very tight, confined space.

226
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,220
Very easy.

227
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,520
And maybe that's intentional.

228
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,620
I'm just, that's my like a tinfoil hat theory, I guess if nothing else, maybe, maybe I don't

229
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,620
know.

230
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,100
It does look very tall.

231
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,340
I wish they had shown there was a shot that I saw where the system can be laid horizontally

232
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:46,220
as well, because otherwise that looks like it's going to be a hard fit for my entertainment

233
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
console.

234
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,580
I don't think I'd be even able to fit it in there.

235
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,580
Otherwise it had to lay flat.

236
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,460
And I kind of like, you know, like everyone's like dogging on the Xbox console, but I like

237
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,860
my console to be kind of flat because I can stack them.

238
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,060
Yeah, I know that's not really making sense for, you know, thermal design and everything.

239
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,020
But I like being able to stack stuff.

240
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,600
I loved having my PlayStation 2 and being able to stack stuff on top of it or my Xbox

241
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
360.

242
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,060
I like them being somewhat flat so that you can do that.

243
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,300
Even if it's not necessarily like another game console, maybe like controllers or something.

244
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,820
You know, the PlayStation 3, I had that and it had to be off to the side because it didn't

245
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,500
really fit anywhere and you couldn't put anything on top of it.

246
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,060
So it was really awkward.

247
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,700
And I don't care, whatever, who cares what the console looks like.

248
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,220
Let's talk a little bit about the fact that you have now a disk drive version or a Blu-ray

249
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,660
drive version and we have a no Blu-ray version.

250
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,220
And this is something we've already seen Microsoft do in the last generation, but I believe this

251
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,260
is the first time we're seeing Sony go this direction of an all digital console.

252
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,580
We didn't hear anything about price.

253
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,900
We didn't hear anything about release date, which I can understand the release date side

254
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,940
of things because they're probably still trying to navigate the waters with COVID and everything.

255
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:07,300
And second wave, especially in countries where these things are produced and so forth, there's

256
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,500
still probably a lot of to be determined when it comes to that.

257
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,700
And the price, though, I think a lot of people are getting the sense they're playing chicken

258
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,820
with Microsoft a little bit, but having the two different options certainly opens the

259
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:28,300
door for them to be able to say, oh, we're going to price this one below Microsoft.

260
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,780
We're going to price this one above Microsoft.

261
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:37,540
I kind of feel like it's going to be obvious that Xbox Series X will also have disk drive.

262
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,580
Microsoft will also do that because they've already done that.

263
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,460
They already have a digital version of the Xbox one, so that's not a new thing.

264
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:54,020
I just don't, I need to know what the price difference is before I would decide.

265
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,380
And I'd still probably, even though I do mostly digital purchases anyways, I still like having

266
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,580
the flexibility for it.

267
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:06,060
So I would probably just still get one with the drive either, unless it's like several

268
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,980
hundred dollars more.

269
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:14,100
But I don't know, I would have to see really what the cost savings is going to be on that.

270
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,060
But I still like the flexibility of it, even if it's not something I'm going to be using a

271
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,380
lot.

272
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,820
Dark Sakura, do you think digital versus disk is a conversation that will happen in your

273
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,220
household?

274
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,620
Probably, we're kind of blasé about some things, like we may get a physical copy if it's

275
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,380
got stuff I think that we want with it.

276
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,860
But I don't know, since the whole quarantine started going on, I think that we did get a

277
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,420
little bit less on top of the physical media side of things.

278
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,860
Really, it was just Animal Crossing.

279
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:53,100
So, you know, now me, I want good packaging, I want good artwork, I want to be able to see

280
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,620
it and look at it and enjoy it and put it somewhere so I can still look at it and see it

281
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,500
and enjoy it.

282
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,660
We have, I mean, well, you've seen what my closet, my game room looks like full of the

283
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,540
boxes and some of the best artwork that you know, that you can see.

284
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,500
So I would rather enjoy having a physical copy.

285
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,020
However, I also enjoy having space and we are running quite short of it.

286
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,300
Let me ask a weird question.

287
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,540
This might be a stupid question, but there's no such thing as stupid questions, right?

288
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,580
Unless I'm the one asking them.

289
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,780
Only stupid people.

290
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,700
OK, well, then this is a stupid people statement.

291
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:35,220
Could the disk driveless version be a response to COVID and this new world we find ourselves in?

292
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,860
No, it's because the system's going to be expensive and so they want to have a version that's cheaper.

293
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,380
That's all.

294
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:51,620
How many, I mean, not too many, say, laptops come with a CD, DVD drive.

295
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,060
I mean, again, cuts down on cost.

296
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,100
You can make a better computer.

297
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,820
So I look at it that way.

298
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,580
Does any a lot of laptops don't come with a drive so they can make them thinner.

299
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:11,740
But with any well, maybe not so much on the Mac side of the house, but on the PC side, you have

300
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,660
multiple storefronts.

301
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,020
You can purchase software from multiple options to make purchases, whereas you have a closed

302
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,380
system with PlayStation or Microsoft and or purchasing things.

303
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:28,140
So it's granted they do a lot more sales nowadays, I think, digitally, but.

304
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,900
It's really, you know, you're only going to be purchasing it there, and if it goes on sale, it's

305
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,020
because the publishers decided to put it on sale and you can't get stuff secondhand, you can't

306
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,180
sell used games.

307
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,340
If that's important to you, then, you know, something to consider.

308
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,460
I, you know, like I said, I like the flexibility whether I use it or not.

309
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:56,460
I know with this generation, PlayStation 4, it's been mostly digital, like 99% of the stuff I

310
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,940
bought is digital.

311
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,500
So I don't know.

312
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,900
I'm still buying a lot of physical things.

313
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,100
I mean, I'm open to digital and I do more and more digital, especially on the Switch, because I

314
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,300
like the portability and all that.

315
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,420
But there's still a lot of physical things I buy.

316
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,180
But I don't know.

317
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,620
I mean, I'm not as like staunchly against an all digital thing as I once was at one point.

318
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,860
I mean, after all, and I think this point got brought up in chat.

319
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,780
I'm sorry, guys, I don't mean to ignore you guys in chat.

320
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,820
My phone is all digital and I have a ton of applications and software and games and the like on my

321
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,300
phone, you know, so it's not like an all digital thing is a completely foreign concept.

322
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,860
Now, what's funny, and this comment made me laugh in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

323
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,380
because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

324
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,780
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

325
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,420
And Quest Buster says the Phantom called and wants people to remember it was a thing.

326
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,900
Well, the what?

327
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,820
The Phantom.

328
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,220
Remember that?

329
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,100
Phantoms.

330
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,460
The what?

331
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,020
Phantom.

332
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,620
Phantoms.

333
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,500
Oh, that was a movie.

334
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:52,860
Right.

335
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,740
A really bad movie.

336
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:54,980
Anyway.

337
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,380
Wasn't it bad?

338
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,100
I don't remember.

339
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,540
I don't remember.

340
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,260
Anyway, the point with all that is, is that there is such a thing as being ahead of your time.

341
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,220
Hello, the Sega Dreamcast called, you know, there is such a thing as like you're too ahead of your

342
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,980
time that it just doesn't catch on, you know, the same way.

343
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,060
And maybe in a way, that's what happened with the Phantom.

344
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,180
Well, Tiger Claw has a good point too.

345
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,100
Like speaking about backwards compatibility, we don't know how that's going to work.

346
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:27,180
So if say, for example, the system is backwards compatible with PlayStation one, two, three, four

347
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,020
games, you know, and those can be read via the disk drive.

348
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,060
It may be advantageous to have a disk drive in the system so that you can play all those.

349
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,060
That's a very good point.

350
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,780
You're going to need a disk drive if backwards compatibility beyond four is a thing.

351
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,540
I mean, and even with four being a thing, if you have PlayStation four disks, unless you have a

352
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,340
digital license, a PlayStation five is not going to automatically recognize that.

353
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,780
So that's a very excellent thought for folks that are considering disk versus, um, digital, uh,

354
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,260
quickly.

355
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,660
And then, then I want to talk a little more about some of the games at the PlayStation five event

356
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,100
quickly.

357
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,820
Does anybody want to tinfoil hat what the price and date?

358
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,940
You don't have to hit the date on the head, but what the price and date ish will be.

359
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Any of my co-hosts want to take a stab at it?

360
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:25,020
Uh, four 99, five 99 and November.

361
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,300
Dark soccer.

362
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:28,700
Low.

363
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,660
It's going to be four 99, a higher model system is going to run about six 50, 700.

364
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,220
They did it before.

365
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Um, I am also going to go, I'm going to go with a four 99, five 99.

366
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,780
I don't think dark soccer's thought is beyond because, you know, again, if the diskless one is

367
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,580
four 99, that's what they're going to say.

368
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,180
The price is, and we all remember when Sony got a lot of shit during the PlayStation three reveal

369
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,020
with the 599 us dollars.

370
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,860
If they hit that mark or beyond it with the one with the disk drive, they are not going to be

371
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,780
emphasizing that price there that you're going to see all the marketing material says starting at

372
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,020
four 99.

373
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,700
That's what it will all say.

374
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,060
Uh, as far as the timeframe, I'm going to predict a delay to March.

375
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,740
I don't think it comes out this year.

376
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,540
And I, I know, yes, I know all the games are already saying holiday and so forth.

377
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,340
I I'm going to be the weirdo that says they don't make it.

378
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,940
And it's, it's because of, of the COVID situation and just the supply demand type of thing.

379
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,540
I don't think it makes the holiday, but we'll see.

380
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,020
All right.

381
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:42,780
Um, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, DJ Rama S says, here's the deal on

382
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,900
backwards compatibility, whether it's Xbox series X or PlayStation five, both systems have the

383
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,260
hardware to be backwards compatible with its older systems.

384
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,420
The issues lies into licensing, meaning of third party companies want their games to be played on

385
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,220
the newest system.

386
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,220
It is a weird thing to think about in a way though, when we think like, Oh, the PlayStation two

387
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,820
just played every single PlayStation one game.

388
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,820
And I'm trying to think, have we, uh, and maybe the Wii U played every Wii game and those things

389
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,700
weren't really a problem, but backwards compatibility isn't as common as you'd necessarily think.

390
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,140
Maybe.

391
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,940
Although Nintendo did a very good job with their handheld systems.

392
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,460
I would say the handheld systems where we got really spoiled, like Game Boy Color played Game Boy

393
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,300
games, Game Boy Advance played Game Boy Color games, DS played advanced games, 3DS played DS

394
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,500
games.

395
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,780
Like they've, their portables were like always very good with backwards compatibility, but

396
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,340
otherwise we don't see it a lot.

397
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,380
Oh, interesting.

398
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,060
Um, Phoenix 7726 says, wait, they have a cell processor for PS3 play, huh?

399
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,380
Uh, we don't know yet for sure.

400
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,060
We don't know, um, what that's going to entail.

401
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,580
We don't know if it would be emulation or if it's even going to be there or could they do something

402
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,660
via PlayStation now and their streaming service.

403
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,100
Like we don't, we don't know.

404
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,660
It could be any of those things.

405
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,540
So, all right.

406
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,340
Anyhow, uh, let's talk a little more about some of the games that we saw at the PlayStation event.

407
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,060
We've mentioned a couple of them, such as the, um, Horizon Forbidden West, but what about some of the

408
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,660
other games?

409
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,580
Were there other things that caught your eye?

410
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,140
I know a lot of people were talking about Spider-Man, Miles Morales.

411
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,020
A lot of people were lighting up at that trailer.

412
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,780
Yeah, that looked pretty good.

413
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,820
I haven't played the original one, but it looks like a great game and I, the new one looks pretty good too.

414
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,580
It was a little confusing because at first, you know, everyone's like, oh, a new game.

415
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,060
And then, then it was like, oh, it's only expansion.

416
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,500
Oh, is it a, you know, is it a new game or is it an expansion?

417
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,700
So apparently what it sounds like, it's, it's a spinoff kind of like how they did with infamous.

418
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,660
They have like that.

419
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,820
I don't remember what the subtitle was on that one, but there was one that was like a, a spinoff game in

420
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,580
the same engine, but it's its own thing.

421
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,540
So, um, I think it's just a spinoff.

422
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,220
Um, I don't know if it's like an expansion with the remastered game or something like that.

423
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Well, they, they really butchered the messaging after that trailer, because you had that executive

424
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,380
who said, oh, it's no, it's the original, uh, one with additional content.

425
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,980
And then they had Insomniac had to come out and say, no, it's an all new game.

426
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,300
It's just not Spider-Man two.

427
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
It's like a Spider-Man side thing.

428
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,380
Like, and they said it was like Uncharted.

429
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,420
Uncharted had that side game that came out not that long ago.

430
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,340
Um, and of course I forget the subtitle in the moment, Lost Legacy.

431
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:26,860
Was that it?

432
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,020
So, uh, they, they had that.

433
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,780
So it's, you know, but it's, it's going to be a similar game, you know, in that.

434
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,660
Or, uh, another good one might be like, there's Bioshock two and then there's Bioshock Infinite.

435
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,860
Which one's the sequel?

436
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,060
Well, technically both are.

437
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,620
Right.

438
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,980
Infinite's a side story though.

439
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,540
Infinite ties everything together.

440
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,340
I know, I know, but which one's the sequel?

441
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,260
So there's, there's different ways you can kind of do a sequel.

442
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,980
I think, I don't know, but they really butchered the messaging on that.

443
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,540
So, uh, I think it's, it's going to be a fine game.

444
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,140
If you enjoyed the Spider-Man game, there's no reason you're not going to like this one as well.

445
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,820
I'm sure.

446
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,580
And it will be prettier cause it's on PlayStation five.

447
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:18,340
Um, Dark Soccer already mentioned Resident Evil eight, the village or village, uh, that looks scary.

448
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,580
That looked like it might've been a VR thing as well.

449
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,340
And you pointed out, they avoided talk about VR to all the last game was fully playable in VR.

450
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,260
So it makes sense that this one is.

451
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,340
Yeah.

452
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,060
Uh, Gran Turismo seven was pretty.

453
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,380
Yeah.

454
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:34,940
Yeah.

455
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,460
Look pretty.

456
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,060
Yeah.

457
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,100
I don't like sim games though.

458
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,620
Yeah.

459
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,140
I don't usually get into the racing sim games, but it, it did look pretty.

460
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,500
How about Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart?

461
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,060
Um, that, that game play was really smooth.

462
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,620
Like it, it was kind of neat to watch that game play, uh, flow.

463
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,380
Yeah.

464
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,180
I think that was one of the trailers I missed originally.

465
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,740
Um, I saw the announcement for it, but it looked, it looks nice.

466
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,780
Looks better than the movie that they did.

467
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,420
I totally forgot about the movie, but yeah, it was just probably a good thing that you forget about it.

468
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,100
Yeah.

469
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,980
It just, it really snapped as they were moving from like, you know, place to place.

470
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,300
Like, I, I definitely think that was a way to show off the solid state drive and the types of things that that can bring to it.

471
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,340
So it was interesting.

472
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:26,100
Uh, the Demon's Souls remake, uh, they didn't really show us a lot outside of a, you know, creepy looking trailer, no gameplay here.

473
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,660
Um, but I'm sure that'll be something that Alan will be into if I pick up the PlayStation five right away.

474
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,500
Cause I know he likes those games.

475
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,020
I liked the trailer for Deathloop.

476
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Did you guys see that?

477
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,700
The Arkane Studios game, which kind of was, I forgot all about that.

478
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,300
They'd shown that last year at the Bethesda thing.

479
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,780
Um, and I completely forgot about it because originally when I saw it, I was like, Oh, another dishonored.

480
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,060
And it's like, definitely I'm like, Oh yeah, that's right.

481
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,580
They have that game.

482
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,980
Um, yeah, it looks interesting.

483
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,380
I like the art style.

484
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:04,460
Uh, NBA 2K21 was there, which, you know, I thought that was a very odd approach to really focus on the sweat.

485
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,700
I don't think sweat is a thing that people like to think about a lot.

486
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,460
Um, so that was a sweat and thinking about how much money you're gonna be spending on microtransactions.

487
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:22,660
It was an odd approach to a trailer, but I mean, we can't sit here and go sports, whatever, because sports games, people do buy those.

488
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,900
A lot of people buy those.

489
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,660
So it's important.

490
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,060
Can't wait to see the extreme fidelity in the bugginess of the new WWE.

491
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,500
Oh, that's right.

492
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
They're skipping this year.

493
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,620
Well, hopefully it's not a piece of garbage.

494
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:42,180
I mean, NBA 2K is usually okay, but that's, that's only in comparison to NBA, uh, I don't even know what they call the EA one.

495
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,860
I guess it doesn't matter because that one's not very good.

496
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,820
But yeah, it's just, it's a big mess of microtransactions and loot boxes.

497
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,980
Uh, that's all I think of that series.

498
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,940
So, uh, and then we had Sackboy.

499
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:01,620
I was excited about that because I kind of feel like the little big planet games kind of need to come back a little bit.

500
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:08,340
And this is sort of that it seems like now I completely understand media molecules moved on to dreams and they have a big old thing.

501
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:15,340
So I'm, I, it's kind of one of those, Oh, I didn't think they'd go back to this idea, but Sackboy is a PlayStation mascot of sorts.

502
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,180
And the trailer looked really cute.

503
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,420
I was into it.

504
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,580
This, this, it looks cool.

505
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:29,340
I was just gonna say the little sack girl they had in the trailer looks just like one of my friends in her Burning Man photos, straight up.

506
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,980
I don't know if you saw the little sack girl.

507
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,340
She looks straight up like one of my friends at Burning Man.

508
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:42,100
Well, I always used to like, granted, like I didn't never really mess too much with the actual level creators and everything in those games.

509
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,260
Um, even though they're really, you know, cool, but I love playing like the single player campaigns and stuff.

510
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,540
So, I mean, I'm sure this would be great.

511
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,860
Uh, and I'm sorry guys, I'm just not going to have time to dive into everything.

512
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,540
So I'm just kind of doing a few like standouts for me here.

513
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,940
I thought that Hitman 3 trailer, like when, when it was going, I was like, Ooh, what game is this?

514
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,620
This looks neat.

515
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,300
And then they were like, it's Hitman 3.

516
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,700
And I was like, it's Hitman?

517
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,380
Really?

518
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,300
I don't, I usually pass on those games, but that looked, that was one of the better looking trailers.

519
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,860
I really thought.

520
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,420
That looked pretty exciting.

521
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:18,020
Um, the other one that I really liked too, that was pretty cool looking is, uh, Ghostwire Tokyo.

522
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,060
That looked really cool.

523
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,820
Where they're like fighting demons and stuff like that, that, that was pretty sweet.

524
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:29,980
And then, uh, Pragmata was another one that like really trippy, uh, I don't even know what it is.

525
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,580
It's some game from Capcom.

526
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,700
It looked pretty awesome.

527
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,020
I really liked Returnal.

528
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,260
That was the one with the, the woman in space.

529
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,020
Otherwise it was a little bit vague what that might be about, but I usually like space sci-fi games.

530
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,940
Um, it looked like it might be a little bit of a, a platformer type of game.

531
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,780
Uh, I'm kind of curious more about that.

532
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,740
So I'm curious to see some, uh, some, uh, gameplay on that.

533
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,780
The Square Enix game, Project Aethia, that looked hot, hot, hot.

534
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,500
I mean, again, we need to see more gameplay, but I was living for that character design.

535
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,500
The environments looked awesome.

536
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,140
That was a, I mean, again, it's, it was a little bit of a cryptic trailer.

537
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,220
Cause you don't really see what the game was, but I was, I was into that.

538
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,660
I don't know about you guys, but that was, that was great.

539
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,860
Is that there, that engine that they showed off like a long time ago?

540
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,700
Well, it's the luminous engine, which is what Final Fantasy 15 was built in.

541
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,580
It was not, I do not believe it was the one that they showed a couple E3s

542
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,700
ago that people were like, Oh, is this like the first look at Final Fantasy 16?

543
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,820
And they're not calling it that.

544
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,820
I don't think this project relates to that.

545
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,180
I think it's really cool.

546
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,540
Yeah.

547
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,060
Um, and then I also, of course, the game, the game of the show was stray.

548
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,620
That was the one where you're the cat and there was all the robots,

549
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,660
but you're playing as the cat.

550
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,180
And you know, I'm always here for a game where you're playing as the cat.

551
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,220
That's for sure.

552
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,340
That one looked good.

553
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,780
I also liked, it was that, uh, Kena Bridge of Spirits.

554
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,380
That one was pretty cool looking.

555
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,100
Yeah.

556
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,700
Um, and then, uh, was it, so, uh, Goodbye Volcano High looked interesting.

557
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,980
Um, I, it looks like I basically watching a cartoon.

558
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,060
Um, and then of course, uh, we have to talk about Bugsnax.

559
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,980
We do have to talk about Bugsnax cause that song was very catchy.

560
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,100
But when I hear that bug sack, bug snack song, all I can hear.

561
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,060
Cause I saw a tweet and now all I hear is butt sex when I hear that song,

562
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,900
instead of hearing bug snacks, but I think, but sex, but so like, then

563
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,100
now it's going to happen to you too.

564
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,380
Next time you hear that song.

565
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,060
So you're welcome.

566
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,860
I thought like when I first saw it, I was like, it was like a cloudy with a

567
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,220
chance of meatballs game and be like, what is this?

568
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:47,020
Cause it looks very similar to that, uh, premise, but then it gets weird.

569
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,580
So, you know, I don't know.

570
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,500
So overall, you know, trying to, trying to tie this up so we can move on to

571
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,460
other big announcements in the week overall, like, how did you feel about,

572
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,900
because this was a different format.

573
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,140
This was a different way of doing this information.

574
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,780
How did you feel about what Sony brought to the table this week?

575
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,180
Anybody?

576
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,700
It was good, except for, uh, Godfall.

577
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,220
I, that I can't get excited about that game, but everything else looks pretty cool.

578
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,260
I just wish there was more of it.

579
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,180
I kind of miss the, the, you know, overwhelming amount of

580
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,020
information during E3 week.

581
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,500
I kind of like, I really liked though.

582
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,740
And I think the best thing about this, which not a lot of people are talking

583
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,500
about is just that this was a bullshit free, I shouldn't say bullshit free,

584
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,220
but they really like the, the method of how they had to do this.

585
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,540
Not that I am, not that I'm saying COVID is a great thing by any means.

586
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,460
Absolutely not.

587
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,020
But PlayStation having to adjust things because of COVID, like this

588
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,500
was like the tightest, like bullshit free presentation I've ever seen them do.

589
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,820
It was such a contrast to the year that they only had four games to show at E3.

590
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,500
And they were moving people from room to room for some type of like

591
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,180
artistic experience or something.

592
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,140
Like this was just game, game, game, game, game, game, game.

593
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,540
And I, I think that's what a lot of people want to see.

594
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:15,020
And I, I kind of applaud their approach because I thought it was well done.

595
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,700
And I think even more than the Microsoft event, a couple of weeks

596
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,180
ago, we saw more gameplay.

597
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,580
We saw, you know, we didn't see it for every game, but we saw enough of a

598
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,580
taste of this is what the machine's actually going to look like in motion.

599
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,380
You know, and got a sense of that.

600
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,540
And so I, I, I kind of applaud it and I noticed, I don't know if you guys noticed,

601
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,540
but I certainly noticed a lot of the protagonists, a lot of the characters

602
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:43,180
in the games, we had a pretty welcoming, diverse lineup of characters in these

603
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,500
games that were featured and I was, I was very happy to see it, so I don't know.

604
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,140
Was it just me?

605
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,780
I thought there was a pretty good mix in there.

606
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,580
So, yeah, definitely.

607
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:54,980
All right.

608
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,500
Well, let's move on and talk about the PC gaming show.

609
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,860
Uh, so look, I didn't even watch.

610
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,180
I just read some of the headlines, but Loki, what were your

611
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,460
thoughts on the PC gaming show?

612
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,540
Um, I also didn't watch it too much or at all.

613
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,780
Um, I was just catching some of the different highlights that they had.

614
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,820
So, uh, one of the things I was excited about, it looks really

615
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,220
different than the last one was.

616
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,060
Um, Oh God, what is it?

617
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,140
It's a, I'm trying to find the, uh, a surgeon simulator too.

618
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,180
Um, so that one looks really weird.

619
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,220
It's co-op this time.

620
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,340
Plus there's an element of like, um, you can build your own surgery

621
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,540
rooms and stuff like that.

622
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,140
And then it looks like there's like almost like an adventure mode or

623
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,300
something like that, that you are solving puzzles with people, but

624
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,580
it's just all sorts of crazy.

625
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,420
So that looked pretty neat.

626
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,180
Um, some of the other stuff that they showed that looked interesting

627
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,660
that Proteus always looks good.

628
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,100
That's that kind of a retro looking shooter game.

629
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,900
Uh, I don't know.

630
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,500
Icarus kind of neat looking.

631
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:08,900
Um, it's, I don't know, a lot survival games, but yeah, Icarus, I guess

632
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,940
that's the one that was, Oh, so that's the one that's, uh, that was

633
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,580
by the folks that did DayZ.

634
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,780
So it's, it's a survival game where it's like you're on a different

635
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,900
planet, you land there and so, uh, neat looking, um, I don't know.

636
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,260
This is not a lot.

637
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,860
The PC game showcase was never one that I would always get excited about.

638
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,940
I guess one of the exciting things though, if you're a fan of the series

639
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,900
that Torchlight 3 was out on Steam that day, so that was a pretty cool announcement.

640
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,900
Um, other than that, I mean, I don't know.

641
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,700
I was excited about Torchlight 3, that's for sure.

642
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,300
But then I started seeing some of the like reception to it and some of the,

643
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,140
not that I want to listen to user reviews, but a lot of people are kind

644
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,100
of saying, boy, it kind of feels like it was a free to play game that

645
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,220
was shifted around a little bit, but I'm going to, I'm going to wait

646
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,140
until it's a little further on because it is in early access.

647
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,140
So let's cut it a little slack.

648
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,340
I want to see what it looks like a little further along, but generally

649
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,780
I'm excited about Torchlight 3.

650
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,060
So, yeah, so I don't know.

651
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,300
Um, like I said, I'm, I miss that the, the whole presentation for that.

652
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,780
Um, it's typically one that I do normally miss anyways, so I don't

653
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:29,580
know, not a huge deal for me, but I'm sure there's, there's a lot of stuff

654
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:34,300
out there for folks that are fans of PC gaming, I just, a lot of this stuff,

655
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,900
especially when it comes down to like some of these simulation games and

656
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,780
everything, I just don't play a lot of the strategies, same games, but I mean,

657
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,180
I know there's a certain simulator too I'm definitely excited for, especially

658
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,260
if they, I'm hoping that they get VR in that as well, um, and then I'm sure

659
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,940
that I'll come to console at some point.

660
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,420
Um, so yeah, we'll have to wait and see.

661
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,660
Did you actually watch the PC gaming thing or did you just kind of sift

662
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,100
through what was announced like I did?

663
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,660
I sifted through it.

664
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,980
Yeah, cause I was, I was kind of curious cause you know, that, that

665
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,860
show has never gotten a good review since the year it started.

666
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,780
So I was kind of curious if they were, I mean, I don't know, chat, did

667
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,980
anybody in chat take a look at it?

668
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
Cause I'm kind of curious about it.

669
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,060
I know, right?

670
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,780
Like it was, I totally forgot.

671
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:24,100
That's the problem with this year is that with not everything being this

672
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,900
week, I can't keep track of what's when, because it's all over the map.

673
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:28,860
You know what I mean?

674
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,460
It like, it used to be like, Oh, it's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and

675
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,740
all day, we'll have some announcements.

676
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,220
It's kind of, it's kind of hard to stay on top of it.

677
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,740
That's for sure.

678
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:36,820
All right.

679
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,060
Yeah.

680
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,700
Proteus looks amazing.

681
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,020
That one is, that one's like kind of, it's a, imagine if you will, a Doom

682
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,340
running a Doom engine with like modern effects and lighting and everything.

683
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,140
So it looks pretty, pretty awesome in that sense.

684
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,660
It's got a really unique looking style to it.

685
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,380
Okay.

686
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,940
And then there was yet yet another, and I think it's a completely new game as

687
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,220
well, cause there's been a several that have come out or been announced already,

688
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,380
but I thought that there was a third rhythm shooter game that they had out

689
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,060
there now, so it was like three games, almost in the same genre that's brand new.

690
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,060
Um, I don't remember what that was called though, but I know there's

691
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,780
Was it Hellsinger?

692
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,300
Cause that's in our next batch of news is the Hellsinger.

693
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,420
No, not Hellsinger.

694
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,340
It was, um, it's something metal.

695
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,780
I don't remember what it's called, but there's, there's like three different

696
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,860
games that are kind of have that same mechanic to them now.

697
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,180
It's like everyone came up with the idea at the same time.

698
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,460
Well, let me move on into some of the other announcements from this week,

699
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,060
because there were a spattering of other things that were announced

700
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,980
during the week as well.

701
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,540
And one of the ones I definitely want to get into, uh, because I was really

702
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,300
excited to see this and it kind of came out of nowhere and I imagined dark

703
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,260
soccer has gotta be feeling some kind of way about this, but that is the

704
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,860
Alex Kidd in a Miracle World Deluxe or DX that they, uh, showed.

705
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,420
Did you, did you see this dark saga?

706
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,500
Yes, I did.

707
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,660
I'm pretty happy about it.

708
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,100
Me too.

709
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,620
Cause it looks like the wonder boy dragons trap thing that they did.

710
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,940
Um, where you can, and that was really good and you can switch really easily

711
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,220
with like a button in between the newer mode and the retro mode and so forth.

712
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,220
And I thought it looked so cool.

713
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,820
I'm, I'm very happy about this.

714
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,500
Yeah, I thought it looked really good.

715
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,660
I mean, we are definitely looking into, of course, picking it up.

716
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,180
So we'll see what happens.

717
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,100
Yeah, for sure.

718
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,300
I was really excited about that.

719
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,260
Um, let's see some other, uh, games that were announced as well.

720
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,420
Um, they talked more about blood stained and what that has in

721
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
store for it for the rest of 2020.

722
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,540
They're continuing development on that game.

723
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,780
Um, I think one other thing I want to mention, uh, for sure is the

724
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,340
arcade one up machines, because I know some people are getting into

725
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,300
collecting those and we know that they, you know, they're going to have a

726
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,340
pinball, we knew that was coming, but they unveiled a Marvel pinball

727
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,380
table that they're doing.

728
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,100
They're also doing a Ms.

729
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,460
Pac-Man cabinet, uh, and compilation.

730
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,620
They're also doing an X-Men versus street fighter cabinet, uh, that will

731
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,980
include Marvel versus street fighter and Marvel versus Capcom.

732
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,980
That's going to be a highly desirable one, I'm sure.

733
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,860
And they're doing a big buck Hunter cabinet for, you know, that crowd.

734
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
Um, that's actually pretty, uh, pretty cool.

735
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,740
Like the gun cabinets that, that opens the door for like, Hey, can

736
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,900
we get like a time crisis or can we get a house with a dead cabinet?

737
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,860
Point blank, point blank here.

738
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,420
I'll take a time crisis slash point blank game.

739
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,500
Um, and maybe those are a little bit more to emulate.

740
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,940
Um, but like, I'm surprised.

741
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,740
Well, I guess, you know, the stuff that they had in there, um, cause

742
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,740
Marvel or just Capcom, that's not CPS too, I don't believe.

743
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,180
Um, I don't know.

744
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,540
I'm excited to see like the different things that they're going to

745
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,980
have available for that stuff.

746
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,660
So, um, I'm curious more of these like unique cabinets that come out.

747
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,260
Um, I do want to quickly say this as well on the arcade one up front.

748
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,020
So y'all know that, um, my birthday, well, maybe you don't know, but my,

749
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,060
I'm to tell you, my birthday's coming up at the end of the month.

750
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,260
This year's been a little crazy.

751
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,820
So I said, you know what, I'm going to do something crazy for my birthday

752
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,300
and buy myself something stupid.

753
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,220
So guess what?

754
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,100
Y'all I bought the burger time cabinet.

755
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:18,380
So next time when we are able to get together in person, again, I will

756
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,780
have a burger time one up cabinet in that arcade one up cabinet in the house.

757
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,020
And I'm actually really psyched about it.

758
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,420
So there is that.

759
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,340
Yeah.

760
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,060
Cool.

761
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,820
Uh, it's a bad dudes, uh, cause it's like a data East karate champ.

762
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,260
Uh, and I think there's one other one.

763
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,620
So it's like a data East cabinet.

764
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:33,980
Yeah.

765
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,100
It's a bad dudes will be cool too.

766
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:41,580
Um, so, uh, anything else, uh, other announcements, uh, Loki, uh, that we

767
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,020
wanted to touch on from that list or should we move on?

768
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,420
Uh, I think we can probably move on.

769
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,020
All right.

770
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,380
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

771
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,020
that we have been playing that we've been playing.

772
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,780
This week, uh, amongst all these announcements, dark soccer.

773
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,380
How was your gaming week?

774
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,460
Animal crossing.

775
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,500
What are your goals or like pattern?

776
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,860
Um, sorry, I didn't mean to cut off, but I'm just curious.

777
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,500
Like what, what do you, cause like I I've mentioned on the show before,

778
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,540
I'm getting to that point where I'm like, I feel like I'm running out

779
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,860
of things to do an animal crossing.

780
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,740
What, what do you kind of like, what is, what is your goals in animal crossing?

781
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,740
I guess, how do you keep yourself motivated in that game?

782
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,340
I don't have it.

783
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,660
I don't have any goals.

784
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,580
I just play and wander around because it's relaxing.

785
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,820
It was kind of a Zen thing.

786
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,180
Okay.

787
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,980
You don't, you don't have to have a goal for something to be fun.

788
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,540
No, I guess that's true.

789
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,060
I guess that's true.

790
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,780
I guess it's more like, you know, what, what motivates you to turn on the power

791
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,380
every day, but relaxing, escaping, I'm sure you do a lot of hanging with friends

792
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,500
and stuff, I mean, sometimes I just really prefer doing the run around and, you

793
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,820
know, being kind of by myself for a bit.

794
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,540
Yeah.

795
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,220
Yeah, that's nice.

796
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:53,900
Okay.

797
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,860
Uh, and then I'm sorry, you said Puzzled or what was the other game?

798
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,740
Oh no, um, uh, Patterned.

799
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,380
A bunch of new puzzles for Patterned got released, um, the Apple Arcade.

800
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,540
I mean, you can buy it, but I'm playing through Apple Arcade and I super like it.

801
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,460
It's very relaxing, gets my mind off of stuff and usually helps me regain some of

802
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,300
my focus when I'm having a really bad time.

803
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,660
Nice.

804
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,100
It's good.

805
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,340
I'll, I'll, I'll try to put it on camera for a little bit while y'all are talking,

806
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,740
but that's really all I've been playing.

807
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:29,700
Okay.

808
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,540
Um, then if that's it for Dark Sakura, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

809
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,300
Uh, it was mainly Minecraft bedrock, um, still playing a lot on our

810
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,940
realm and doing a lot of stuff there.

811
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:48,060
So I ended up building an automatic slime farm, which involved me digging

812
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,940
out an entire chunk of space.

813
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,220
So that's 16 by 16 blocks.

814
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,900
And then I say it dug down at least, gosh, like 80.

815
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,300
So that took a very long time.

816
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,660
Plus when you constantly have slime spawning on you, that was not fun.

817
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,740
Uh, but I finished that today, so that was good.

818
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,540
And then, uh, just more kind of playing around with that with kids.

819
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:18,180
And then, uh, played a little bit of Orna this week and that's about it.

820
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,620
I have also been playing a crap ton of Orna, um, which of course we've talked

821
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,380
about the game many times on this show, but it's like the real world.

822
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,940
Uh, but it's very, very inspired by an APID RPG, but I finally got the 2 million

823
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,140
Orns it takes to up, uh, unlock one of the higher level classes.

824
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,700
Oh my God, that took forever.

825
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,700
And now I'm looking at like the next batch is like three and a half million.

826
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,860
And I'm just like, oh no.

827
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,700
Oh my God.

828
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,500
But at least, oh my God, it has made my survivability so much better.

829
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,540
Like I don't die in one hit anymore.

830
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,140
It takes at least three hits to kill me now.

831
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,060
So there's that.

832
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,820
Um, and then I've been to continuing in Xenoblade.

833
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,700
Uh, I'm probably about 10 hours in with Xenoblade, which means I've barely made

834
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,180
any progression cause that game is forever.

835
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,740
No, I'm, I'm in chapter five, uh, for anybody that knows that game and I'm,

836
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,460
I'm enjoying it and that's kind of like my, uh, you know, kind of like finding

837
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,020
your game to kind of like chill out to right now, like Xenoblade's been good

838
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:13,540
for that because, um, there's so many, like if I don't want to do the main

839
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,780
story, there's so many side quests and things to do.

840
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,940
I feel like I could play that game for like three minutes and still feel like I

841
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,500
did something because I did one of the side quests in the game, which a lot of

842
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,580
RPGs can't really claim that.

843
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:30,300
So that's one thing I'm finding that I really like about Xenoblade and why I

844
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,180
think the switch is a great system for that to be on.

845
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,860
Um, you know, despite all the weird releases that that game has had

846
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,820
previously, and now I understand a little better as well why it came out on the

847
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,700
3DS and I know I, I, I was more upset about the whole new 3DS result, 3DS

848
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,660
thing, but I understand a lot more now why that game made a good 3DS candidate.

849
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,580
So I will, I will concede that years later for what it's worth.

850
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,700
Um, and then otherwise I still am playing animal crossing because Alan is still

851
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,980
very like, you know, does a lot and I help him out and you know, like my

852
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,820
turnip prices were lower than his this morning.

853
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,260
So he came over, Oh, I, I, my, my price has spiked.

854
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,460
I, I finally was the popular girl this week.

855
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:16,100
Cause I had the four 70 turnip price and all I had to do was make a post on my

856
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,740
Facebook.

857
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,060
I didn't even get around to doing groups.

858
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,780
I had friends that I didn't even know played animal crossing that were like,

859
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,620
can I come sell?

860
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,900
Can, can, um, my, my, I didn't even see your post.

861
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,260
Dan told me, Oh yeah, cause Dan saw it.

862
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,620
Dan was the, Dan was the first person to comment that you went into what, what the

863
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,340
next day I could have sold for six 70.

864
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,900
Oh, that's always, it's so hard to determine.

865
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,900
It's like the stock market.

866
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,500
When do I buy?

867
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,060
When do I sell?

868
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,620
Yeah.

869
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,020
Right.

870
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:50,260
So, um, but yeah, I had, I had a lot of people come through, uh, to buy for that.

871
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,580
I just pretty much left my switch on and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't going

872
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,140
to be flooded with people.

873
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,140
And I think that's one reason I really try to make sure my friends would get

874
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,860
through first because like I was able to, like it was at most, I think like three

875
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,020
people were there at one point.

876
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,420
And I think that was actually when you were there, Jamie, like I think my buddy

877
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,540
Abra was there and one other might've showed up there when you were there.

878
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:10,980
And that was it.

879
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,900
Like, you know, that was, yeah.

880
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:20,380
So one of the things like when I open up for anything like that is I just flat out

881
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,180
say, um, you know, uh, cause you know, I've got my big group, all I do is say,

882
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,500
um, Send me a message and I'll let you in.

883
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,820
And I don't let more than four in at one time because I hate having it interrupted

884
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,020
when I'm in the middle of something.

885
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:35,460
Yeah.

886
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,820
And I know there's websites that facilitate that as well, but for, and I

887
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,460
could have used like Turnip Exchange or something, but I feel like there's

888
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,860
something more personal about like, Hey, message me and you know, that's, I don't,

889
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,780
I don't need a 99,000 bell tip.

890
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,700
I mean, I won't say no, but I don't need it.

891
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,020
I just, just have an excuse to say hi to me.

892
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,220
You know what I mean?

893
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,900
So, yeah.

894
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:58,820
All right.

895
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,300
Uh, as far as other games that I've been playing this week, um, you know, same,

896
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,580
same old, same old on the PC, been playing Final Fantasy 14 still.

897
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,820
And, uh, yeah, uh, just keeping myself entertained with that.

898
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,540
So we will move on to some longer news here.

899
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,380
So let's get to our first story tonight.

900
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,180
Uh, outside.

901
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,100
I mean, we've already talked a lot tonight, but our first maybe

902
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,300
non press conference story, uh, has to do with leaks, right?

903
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:24,660
Logie.

904
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:25,860
Yeah.

905
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,100
So, uh, I was actually going to mention too real quick since you brought up the

906
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:35,020
switch, um, so our switch at home, the SD card slot is jacked up.

907
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,380
Oh no, that's probably because it's because their design of how they

908
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,500
designed the whole system is really stupid.

909
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,580
They've got the board that has the micro SD card.

910
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,620
It's just, there's like a little connector that just held in by

911
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,260
pressure and doesn't snap in or anything.

912
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:55,500
And so it, that originally was loose and it was causing it to not work all the time.

913
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,660
Now it just doesn't work at all.

914
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,940
So I ordered replacements, at least it's only 20 bucks to fix it, but it's still

915
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,460
super annoying that I've had to repair so many things on this switch already.

916
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,500
Anyway, so that aside, uh, let's talk about leaks.

917
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:14,540
So, um, earlier this week, Star Wars squadrons had a wonderful little banner

918
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:19,660
that appeared on the Xbox store and, um, basically leaked that, Hey, there's

919
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,060
a new Star Wars game coming.

920
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,580
And of course, because of that now, uh, EA has announced that yes, there will be

921
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:31,540
a reveal trailer that's going to be coming at 8 PM Pacific time on June 15th.

922
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,700
So you can check that out, but it does look like it's going to be kind of, um,

923
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,060
uh, similar to the X-wing TIE fire series.

924
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,940
So I don't know if it's mainly like kind of a flight SIM game, but, uh, it looks

925
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,500
interesting, so I guess we'll check that out tomorrow when that comes out.

926
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:53,140
Um, and then also with that as well, there's a, there was a listing for UFC

927
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,700
four on the PlayStation four patch database.

928
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,780
Um, so apparently EA is having all sorts of trouble keeping

929
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,100
their secrets, uh, this week.

930
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,940
But I guess we'll expect some announcements soon.

931
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,980
They've got their EA play event, I think pretty soon.

932
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,900
Uh, that's supposed to be at the end of this week on the 18th.

933
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,220
So I guess we'll see all those announcements officially then.

934
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:17,820
All right.

935
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,100
Yeah.

936
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,380
I know the EA, the EA thing is coming up.

937
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,020
Uh, so yeah, more, more stuff in the next week.

938
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:27,060
But leaks are an inevitable part, inevitable part of E3, aren't they?

939
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,460
Yes.

940
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,620
It's almost like we're in real E3 again.

941
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:31,860
All right.

942
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,860
Except it's, it's faux E3 anyway.

943
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:38,180
Um, so, uh, before we move on to the next, uh, story, uh, Dark

944
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,180
Sakura, I know you've got work things going on tomorrow and I'm sorry.

945
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,700
You can't stay longer tonight.

946
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,580
Um, but I know you wanted to say good night and, uh, all that good stuff.

947
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,100
So thank you for being here as always.

948
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,100
Um, any parting words for our audience tonight?

949
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,020
Uh, just in a couple of weeks, I'm going to be back on a much

950
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,580
easier to deal with schedule.

951
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:02,860
Um, so this won't last too much longer that I have to pop out early.

952
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,060
And this is, I just have things I need to take care of before work tomorrow.

953
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,500
So sorry about it.

954
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,260
All right.

955
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:08,780
Sounds good.

956
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,340
It's always, it's always good to have you here, even if just for a little bit,

957
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,340
Dark Sakura, we look forward to, uh, uh, a couple of weeks and we

958
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,540
can keep you here until midnight.

959
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,780
Oh, trust me that that's coming, uh, right at the beginning of, uh, gosh, I

960
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,820
think it's actually starting next month.

961
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,980
I'll have to know it's starting August.

962
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,820
I'm so stupid, but still, it is what it is.

963
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,340
No worries.

964
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:29,820
No worries.

965
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,540
All right.

966
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,700
Well, be sure to say hello to our chatters because there's a lot of

967
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,060
kind words for you out there in chat.

968
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,380
So, um, take care of my friend and have a great night.

969
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:38,700
You too.

970
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,980
Love y'all everybody.

971
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,540
Bye.

972
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:41,540
All right.

973
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:41,940
Bye.

974
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:42,780
All right.

975
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,140
Um, so, uh, meanwhile, let me go to the next story here.

976
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:52,660
And, uh, the video, the video may look a little funky for you guys.

977
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,500
As soon as Dark Sakura disconnects, it's going to mess up my discord layout,

978
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,540
but just bear with me, I'll fix it as soon as I can, but I want to get to the

979
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,380
next story here that has to do with, unfortunately, some more Nintendo

980
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,180
accounts have been breached.

981
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,180
This is an addition to what we heard about before, but apparently another

982
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,700
140,000 accounts were breached in April.

983
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,660
Uh, Nintendo, of course, already earlier, uh, probably about a month ago, talked

984
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,540
about that 160,000 accounts were breached in the hack and they've added

985
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,540
another 140,000 to that total.

986
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,020
So that's about 300,000 accounts.

987
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,460
Um, although Nintendo is kind of trying to say now, well, that's only 1%

988
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,620
of all the Nintendo network users.

989
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,740
All right, whatever.

990
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:38,020
The moral of the story is whether you're part of this 1% or not, make

991
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,900
sure you change your Nintendo password.

992
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,860
That's probably a good idea.

993
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,500
Make sure your Nintendo password is not your bank password

994
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,820
or your email password.

995
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,260
Like you really should have a separate email for everything, but at least

996
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:54,180
your bank and your email, because without those two things, you're

997
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,820
going to be really unhappy.

998
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,340
Like I can live without Nintendo for a little bit while I get it fixed.

999
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,740
I can't live without the other two.

1000
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,740
So just make sure you're using unique passwords there.

1001
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,980
Um, so yeah, that's.

1002
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,020
I did, but they, I'm not hearing maybe, maybe there's more details.

1003
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:11,420
If I dig through this announcement, except it's in the Japanese, uh, sites,

1004
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,900
I don't know, like what all the specifics are, but I'm not sure like

1005
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,900
why they just suddenly found more.

1006
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,100
Did you hear anything on that?

1007
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:19,660
Loki?

1008
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,060
Um, no, I don't know why they found more.

1009
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,700
I know originally when they were talking about the original leaks, it was supposed

1010
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,700
to be like a smaller subset of the users.

1011
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:37,460
I don't know if it's because, you know, other sites were like compromised and

1012
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,300
maybe they found that, you know, the passwords from that other

1013
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,540
people use, I don't know how they may have figured it out, but.

1014
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,540
It's weird that we're finding out more of these coming out.

1015
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:53,100
So now, you know, 300,000 accounts total, and it's kind of ridiculous.

1016
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,580
So I guess we'll, I guess we'll find out, or maybe they just won't tell us

1017
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:02,060
how, how they figured that out, but I don't know, I don't like when it

1018
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:06,060
trickles out like that, because that was kind of like that whole, um, you

1019
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,820
know, Equifax stuff, it's like, oh yeah, it was only this many, or Facebook.

1020
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,220
It was only like, it was only like half a billion.

1021
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,660
Okay.

1022
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,380
No, 1 billion or the Yahoo email.

1023
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,420
Actually, it was everybody on the whole fucking site.

1024
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,660
It was the whole goddamn site.

1025
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:23,420
Anyway.

1026
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,100
Uh, very good point by SGA 100 Matt in our chat room over at Twitch TV slash

1027
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:31,700
VOG network as 200 Matt says, sign up for the two factor authentication word.

1028
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,340
Two factor authentication is great and pretty much any bank.

1029
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,620
I mean, maybe local banks don't use it, or I can't speak for every credit

1030
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,860
union in the world, but just about every big bank is, has a two factor

1031
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,500
auth available at this point.

1032
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,980
Uh, and certainly all of the major email providers, uh, have two

1033
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,780
factor auth and seriously use it.

1034
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,100
Um, you'll, you'll thank me later.

1035
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,340
Although I'm sure many people listening to this show are

1036
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,300
already doing that, right?

1037
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:00,980
I would hope so.

1038
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:01,660
All right.

1039
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,900
Um, now Jamie was going to talk about this, uh, for us, but we

1040
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,500
ran along a little bit here, so I don't know, uh, I've heard a little,

1041
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,100
I've heard a little bit about this Loki.

1042
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,780
I'll try to hit on the big points here and you can help me fill in the gaps.

1043
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,460
But, uh, Warner brothers interactive, who also is over rock steady,

1044
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,900
which is a Batman Arkham.

1045
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,740
And they're also over nether realm, which is mortal combat.

1046
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,260
Apparently they're up for sale.

1047
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,940
Um, I had no idea that they were something that was being put on the

1048
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:31,740
market, but apparently the parent company of Warner AT&T is talking about a big

1049
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:37,900
sale, uh, AT&T got Time Warner for 109 billion in 2018, this was a part of that.

1050
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,580
Obviously Time Warner is much more than a game developer, right?

1051
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,540
Uh, what, right?

1052
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:41,740
Yeah.

1053
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,540
How many movies have you seen with the Warner brothers logo in the beginning?

1054
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,500
Or they're a big cable provider as well.

1055
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:46,780
Right.

1056
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,140
So they're a big, big company.

1057
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,300
Games is one part of that.

1058
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,620
Um, but investors have been saying, Hey, Warner, you need to sell off some of

1059
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,780
your like non-core business, which for, I guess the games for whatever reason,

1060
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,580
fall into that anyway, some of the suitors that have expressed interest.

1061
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,060
The ones you would expect EA and blizzard, uh, Activision blizzard,

1062
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:10,140
excuse me, uh, have expressed interest as well as take two entertainment, uh,

1063
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,460
have all expressed interest in possibly buying the game division, but

1064
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,580
nothing has been finalized yet.

1065
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:24,740
So, um, apparently IPs that are movie IPs that tie into games.

1066
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:32,060
So like the Batman IP, the Harry Potter IP are not inherently a part of the deal,

1067
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,420
but they could still be part of licensing.

1068
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,380
And if I'm not mistaken, EA has made Harry Potter games in the past.

1069
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,220
They have.

1070
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:39,540
Yeah.

1071
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:39,900
Yeah.

1072
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:45,100
So they can license that or work that out, but just because they buy Warner

1073
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,260
doesn't mean they're going to automatically get Batman and Harry Potter

1074
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,500
and the things that tie into the Warner movie side of things.

1075
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,780
So, uh, these types of sales and business are complicated to say the least.

1076
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:57,580
Yeah.

1077
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,540
And I don't think it matters which studio purchases them because, um, I don't know

1078
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:07,980
all big AAA studios nowadays are kind of shitty anyway, so I guess it doesn't

1079
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:13,900
matter which, which one should we, you know, uh, which one should we pick?

1080
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,540
Uh, well, it would just be a matter of how much are they allowed to

1081
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,260
run independently as well, you know?

1082
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,180
Right.

1083
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,580
Yeah.

1084
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:28,220
I mean, I guess if I was going to pick one of the three or the least, uh,

1085
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:33,420
favorite of the three, I would say EA, um, only because of their track record of

1086
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,540
taking studios and then closing them down after they've milked them to death.

1087
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:41,780
So I would rather have, you know, Activision or take two in that sense.

1088
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,540
Um, but who knows?

1089
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,900
I'm laughing because I'm very happy that Mr.

1090
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:51,820
Smoosh has a friend in who loves to wine when the microphone's hot every single

1091
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,140
time.

1092
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,780
Like she's always screaming in here.

1093
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:54,700
Chat.

1094
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,580
That's not smush.

1095
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,540
That's not smush.

1096
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,700
No, that's Stella.

1097
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,420
You know, quite literally comes in the room and starts yelling all the time.

1098
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,060
Not because she doesn't have food.

1099
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:08,700
She literally has her, her kibble with a can of soft food on top of it.

1100
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,740
So I don't know what she's complaining about.

1101
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,660
And now she's going back to eat.

1102
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,500
She just like, lets us know that, Hey, I'm in the room.

1103
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,980
I'm, I'm unhappy for some reason.

1104
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,100
Smoosh heard his name.

1105
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,660
So Alan brought him in for cameo.

1106
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:20,980
There you go.

1107
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,700
That's why he didn't like getting picked up.

1108
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,580
All right.

1109
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,020
Uh, anyway, and the chat is lighting up smoosh, smoosh, smoosh.

1110
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,660
Okay.

1111
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,820
Uh, anyway, uh, let's move on.

1112
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,260
Uh, Loki, what do you have for us next?

1113
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:34,620
All right.

1114
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:39,980
So, uh, the Sims players are holding virtual black lives matter rallies.

1115
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:47,460
Um, so there's a modder and streamer at Daniel, uh, Ebonics Sims.

1116
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,300
I can't pronounce the last name.

1117
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,700
Uh, they started in, in game black lives matter rally.

1118
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:56,780
Uh, apparently last weekend and it's been still going strong for a while.

1119
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,340
Um, neat.

1120
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,420
I mean, I guess everybody's been doing different types of things.

1121
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,580
I remember we talked about NBA 2k last week with, um, giving out some of the

1122
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,100
different skins and stuff for that.

1123
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,220
There's people holding, holding protests and that.

1124
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,260
So it's kind of cool to see people expressing themselves in different games.

1125
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:13,740
Um,

1126
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:20,780
man, this is, this is also where like your, your, um, player base is coming up

1127
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,340
with this and it's not necessarily something like in the cases we were

1128
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,020
talking about last week, you had publishers and developers that were, you

1129
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,220
know, putting the message into the games, which is great.

1130
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,100
This is something that's very organic.

1131
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,580
That's grown out of the player base.

1132
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,620
And so we see this in the Sims and you know, although I don't have an example

1133
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:42,260
in front of me, I would be hard pressed to believe, uh, believe that this isn't

1134
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,500
happening in games like world of Warcraft, final fantasy, actually, I feel like

1135
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:52,740
there was a parade in final fantasy, um, at some point recently, um, yeah,

1136
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,460
where I'm just trying to, I don't want to misappropriate it to this

1137
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,340
particular movement when it's not.

1138
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:03,260
Um, but we have seen that these, these games are capable of

1139
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,580
that from their communities.

1140
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:09,220
And so seeing that grow into, cause you know, uh, there's a lot of people

1141
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:14,100
that don't, that they, they want to protest, but for whatever reason,

1142
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,780
they're not able to physically be out there protesting.

1143
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,780
And that could be because of physical needs.

1144
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:24,500
That could be because of COBA, COBA, COVID and, uh, uh, immunocompetent.

1145
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,220
Why can't I speak tonight?

1146
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:26,820
I'm so sorry.

1147
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,140
Uh, COVID and immunocompromised individuals and so forth.

1148
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:37,620
So I feel like the digital, um, protests are a great way for people to kind

1149
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:42,540
of participate without when they're not able to participate out there in

1150
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,700
the real world, if that makes sense.

1151
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,980
Yeah.

1152
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:45,380
Yeah.

1153
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,460
Everybody kind of has their own different ways of, you know,

1154
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,980
the activism and so forth.

1155
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,380
And, and certainly, you know, a, a, a movement like this, a protest in the

1156
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,740
Sims, it gets people's attention.

1157
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,740
Um, and lately here we are talking about it here.

1158
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:03,100
It is a story running across all the gaming blogs this week.

1159
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,260
You know, we talk about things that are on Twitter and on game blogs and so forth.

1160
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,220
So it is succeeding in that element.

1161
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,980
Um, so I think it's pretty cool to watch that stuff.

1162
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,020
So, yeah.

1163
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:13,460
All right.

1164
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:17,580
Um, SSG100Matt says, I remember seeing stories of funerals for

1165
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,460
players on wow and final fantasy.

1166
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:19,980
Yeah.

1167
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,940
And that's, you know, again, the community coming together for, you know, in this

1168
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,100
case, the, the players that have deceased, but I'm sure there's a lot of, you know,

1169
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:31,020
we, and we talked about this last week as well, too, people doing activism in

1170
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:35,780
animal crossing, changing town flags, uh, doing screenshots of their own

1171
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,420
types of activism and so forth.

1172
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,980
You know, everybody's got their different way.

1173
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,700
Um, so it's, it's interesting to see how video games, you know, again, if you want

1174
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,940
to say video games are art, it's interesting to see how this art, this

1175
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,100
movement is creating these new types of artistic expression.

1176
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,700
Uh, and it's pretty cool.

1177
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,660
So, all right.

1178
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,940
And we will mention it later in the show as well, but, um, you know, we're still

1179
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,900
kind of, cause this, this whole movement is far from over.

1180
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,340
So please, uh, continue to pay attention to the bottom ticker bar.

1181
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,260
We do have some resources there for you guys.

1182
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,700
Uh, if you are interested in learning more about it, or you're interested in

1183
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,460
making a donation, um, to the black lives matter movement, uh, there is some

1184
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,460
information that scrolls on the bottom of the screen.

1185
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,260
Also, we'll mention it again later in the show, but there's like 48 hours left or

1186
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,220
something like that in that itch IO bundle.

1187
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,420
So if you're like, what is like one easy thing I as a gamer can do right now?

1188
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,980
Well, here's, here's a good start.

1189
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,220
So there's the, I mean, don't, don't let that be your only thing, but here's a

1190
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:34,100
good start is that itch IO bundle is still available, uh, for like 48 more

1191
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:34,540
hours.

1192
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:37,180
And probably I'm giving it too much time with that.

1193
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,780
Uh, and that's a great thing.

1194
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:43,860
And if you can spare it, don't just give $5 for like 1500 games.

1195
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:48,060
See if you can at least double it, you know, 10 bucks, maybe you can do 20, 25.

1196
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:48,780
Or do it.

1197
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,540
I mean, it's great.

1198
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,340
And if you've already purchased it, then you, um, you get those as well.

1199
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:58,620
So, but like, Gosh, I can't imagine like all the things to play in that it's just

1200
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,100
amazing.

1201
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,700
Uh, hype mayhem in chat asks a good question that is worth bringing up.

1202
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,140
And that is a, okay, stupid question time.

1203
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,860
Isn't the whole point of a protest to make your stance known to politicians and

1204
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:14,980
or police and in real life protest does that since it's visible, won't the in

1205
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,900
game protests not be visible to politicians and cops?

1206
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:23,140
It's not always just about that crowd of the politicians and the decision makers.

1207
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,620
I mean, certainly that's an important part of it, but I think a big part of

1208
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:30,340
that is also each other and that visibility with each other.

1209
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,980
We talked a little bit about this last week.

1210
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:38,660
Um, and that is that I think part of the importance of being an ally is being able

1211
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:44,740
to talk to other people in positions of privilege about what is going on and why

1212
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:51,460
they should care because black people generally are tired of having to do so.

1213
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:56,660
So that's why allies need to step up and have those difficult conversations because

1214
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,180
we are, uh, in a position with privilege to be able to do that.

1215
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:08,300
So that being said, it's not just about police and politicians, it's about

1216
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,540
spreading the message with each other.

1217
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,100
And I think the protest that we see in these games are getting the attention.

1218
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,580
I mean, we just mentioned it's all over video game blogs and all of this.

1219
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:23,660
Now it is getting attention of a crowd that may otherwise not be paying enough

1220
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:30,660
attention to what is going on or have the privilege to be able to, uh, I'm just,

1221
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,220
I'm not paying attention to this.

1222
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,900
This is just, this is too much.

1223
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,180
I don't, I don't, I don't care about what's going on.

1224
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:41,460
Well, the reason why, and you may not like that word privilege, but the reason why

1225
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:46,020
we use that word is because you have the privilege to be able to do that.

1226
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,620
You have the privilege to be able to turn it off.

1227
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,860
Not everybody gets to turn it off.

1228
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,020
And that's the point.

1229
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,780
So something to think about.

1230
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,740
So anyway, um, but I think, I think that was a very fair question.

1231
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,340
And, uh, you know, there you go.

1232
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:58,980
That's the answer.

1233
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,380
It's about bringing visible, at least from my perspective, I'm sure other

1234
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,300
folks will have answers as well, but it's about bringing visibility to each other

1235
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:10,300
and not just those in a position of power, but real quickly, and I know when we get

1236
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,020
to the next story, but, um, we are also in a day and age where more and more

1237
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:19,900
politicians are gamers too, like we all know AOCs playing animal crossing

1238
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,260
and stuff like that, right?

1239
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:25,820
I'm sure she's not the only politician who happens to be a gamer and read game.

1240
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:31,580
I know she's, we had that one politician who was, uh, fraudulently spending money

1241
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:37,900
on steam, so you have all sorts of gamers out there in politics, but my point is,

1242
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,620
is that, you know, as we spread the message to each other, it gets to the

1243
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,380
decision makers, it gets to the politicians, because again, part of that

1244
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:50,340
continued activism is saying something both at the ballot box and to your

1245
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,140
representatives.

1246
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:52,540
So there you go.

1247
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:56,420
Um, and there's some, um, there's some good comments in chat that kind of follow

1248
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,100
that as well.

1249
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,220
Fifth dream today says it got publicity.

1250
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,420
It's noticed by people who say the stuff on the web.

1251
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,780
It could change minds.

1252
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,380
Uh, quest buster says they keep the protest visible and continue to raise

1253
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,580
awareness, which is still an important part of the message.

1254
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,380
A few streamers even did black lives matter, charity streams.

1255
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:11,580
Yeah.

1256
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,220
So, and they, thank you for the kind words about me summing it up there.

1257
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:19,860
I'm always like, God, I don't want to get this wrong, but I try to speak from here

1258
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:22,620
where I can and, and usually that leads me to the right answer.

1259
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:23,420
All right.

1260
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:24,820
Let's move on.

1261
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:29,940
We got more stories for you, uh, including, uh, news about a Skyrim mod.

1262
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,100
That's going way beyond just being a mod anymore.

1263
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:38,220
Um, so for Skyrim, uh, there is a mod out there called the forgotten city,

1264
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,140
I believe is the name of it.

1265
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:42,700
Uh, and it is a, a Skyrim mod that has, you know, gotten a lot of

1266
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,540
achievements and praise and so forth.

1267
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,260
Um, apparently it even won a writer's guild of America award.

1268
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:48,900
I had no idea.

1269
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,620
Pretty cool.

1270
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,740
How did that happen?

1271
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,740
I that's cool though.

1272
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:56,340
Um, it is now being its own game, so it's no longer going to be like dependent on

1273
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,980
Skyrim and it's going to launch this winter.

1274
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:02,220
Um, so the forgotten city has gotten a lot of props and the Elder Scrolls

1275
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:05,100
community for having its own rich story experience.

1276
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,340
Um, The developer is modern storyteller.

1277
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,060
The publisher is dear villagers, and they're talking about a mature

1278
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,820
narrative driven game with this.

1279
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,380
And the trailer actually debuted as part of the PC gaming show.

1280
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,580
So I know we didn't discuss it earlier, but I think it's important to point out,

1281
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:29,940
Hey, this was born as a, uh, mod for Skyrim, just like 50 shades of gray

1282
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,700
was born from Twilight fanfic.

1283
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,700
It's just like that, right?

1284
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,060
Loki.

1285
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:40,540
Um, let's just compare it to maybe like, um, you know, say Dota two or something

1286
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:45,580
else, you know, I like that Loki's like, maybe that's not the comparison

1287
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,060
we want to use right now.

1288
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:47,500
Okay.

1289
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:48,140
All right.

1290
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:48,740
I'll give you that.

1291
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:54,780
This is going to be good versus, you know, 50 shades of gray, which was terrible.

1292
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,100
Okay.

1293
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:55,380
Okay.

1294
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:55,620
Okay.

1295
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,780
Team fortress two was born of a quake mod.

1296
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,060
All right.

1297
01:06:59,060 --> 01:06:59,660
How about that?

1298
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:00,300
Much better.

1299
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:00,980
Yeah, much better.

1300
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:01,300
All right.

1301
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:03,580
Okay.

1302
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:09,700
Uh, but anyway, uh, it's, so here we have another example of a modded

1303
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,220
game turning into its own game and, uh, yeah, it's going to be out this winter.

1304
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,260
And I think that's pretty cool.

1305
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,700
So, yeah, I'm very excited to check it out.

1306
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,420
Me too.

1307
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,940
Um, and hopefully no one takes an arrow to the knee in that game.

1308
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:24,660
Cause that line's played out.

1309
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,020
Yes.

1310
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:26,780
Yes.

1311
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,180
All right, let's move on.

1312
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:32,380
Uh, so, uh, dark soccer was going to talk about this next story and I think I'm

1313
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,500
going to save it for, cause that's not something that is necessarily time

1314
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,260
sensitive, even though the story came out this week, uh, and she asked us to go

1315
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,860
ahead and skip the classic game of the week this week, I don't know.

1316
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,620
Are we, are we able to just like find something on the fly?

1317
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,340
Low key.

1318
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:50,780
Uh, unfortunately the news this week was so top heavy.

1319
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,820
We weren't able to get to where dark soccer, uh, could do

1320
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,020
her classic game of the week.

1321
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,780
Um, so now we're in this odd predicament where we don't have a game of the week.

1322
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,900
But then I feel like, how can we go a week on the show and

1323
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,740
not do a classic game segment?

1324
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,660
So we need to kind of pick something live.

1325
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,060
I think that we haven't done before.

1326
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,020
Can we do that?

1327
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:10,100
Um, I mean, anything is possible.

1328
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:14,260
Like I know at one time when we were doing classic game, uh, or I was

1329
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,500
picking one, there was a lot of backup, like, Oh yeah, that'd be great.

1330
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,420
Let's, let's save that for another day.

1331
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,460
You know, type of things.

1332
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,140
Uh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1333
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,900
You, you have mega Zeus in the background all night.

1334
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:26,940
Well, now you have Pokemon.

1335
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,260
Have we done mega Zeus?

1336
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:28,860
Damn it.

1337
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:29,700
We've done mega Zeus.

1338
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:30,540
I thought we did.

1339
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:30,940
Yeah.

1340
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,380
It's, it's pretty close.

1341
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:40,060
I mean, um, let me think, um, thinking on the fly here.

1342
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:44,980
Uh, what about, and the other thing is I'm, we've had so many games.

1343
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,460
I don't want to duplicate something.

1344
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,180
You know what I mean?

1345
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,980
Like we've picked so many games in the past.

1346
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:51,460
I worry if I'm going to pick something, I'm going to duplicate it.

1347
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,780
So I'm trying to think I'm using my brain and I'm trying to go way into

1348
01:08:55,780 --> 01:09:00,580
the archives of my brain, uh, and come up with a game, like maybe something

1349
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,340
I've been playing on, um, ant stream or something.

1350
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:11,860
Um, I have one and I know I do have one if you want to do it.

1351
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:13,260
Okay.

1352
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:17,060
Otherwise I actually see a suggestion in chat I could go with, to be honest.

1353
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,220
Cause I don't think we've ever talked about this game and it is something

1354
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,420
I could talk about memories for.

1355
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:23,460
Okay.

1356
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,180
Um, we can do that.

1357
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,660
Um, I was going to pick Derby owners club.

1358
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,900
Oh, Jamie will be so mad if we do that without her.

1359
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:33,460
Yeah.

1360
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,060
Yeah, that's a good pick.

1361
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:35,300
All right.

1362
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,700
I'm going to do the one that's chat picked.

1363
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,020
Okay.

1364
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:37,980
Okay.

1365
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,340
So let me, wait, let me hurry up.

1366
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,300
I'm going to bring up Safari here and find a YouTube clip of it real quick,

1367
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,020
because this is a game I totally remember.

1368
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,500
And somebody in the chat just picked this.

1369
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,100
You said it in chat and I was like, oh hell yeah, that game.

1370
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:49,620
Okay.

1371
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,060
Hold on.

1372
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,100
I'm trying to get to the YouTube.

1373
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:55,780
Um, okay.

1374
01:09:55,780 --> 01:10:00,700
So this game I'm picking because I have memories of this game and I

1375
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,420
have memories of this game and it was kind of like, um, it was kind of scary.

1376
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,980
And, uh, I'm not sure all my memories of this game were necessarily good because

1377
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,220
I remember being scared as hell by this game, because it was almost like a boo.

1378
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,820
Uh, gotcha type of thing.

1379
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:18,340
Uh, but the classic game I'm going to pick is Jurassic park on the super Nintendo.

1380
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,300
So, oops.

1381
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,100
And I hit the wrong button and now we don't have Safari.

1382
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,940
Uh, gotta love doing it live here.

1383
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:26,340
Okay.

1384
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,980
Let me try this one more time.

1385
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:34,780
So Jurassic park on the super Nintendo was a, there we go, was a game that was

1386
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:40,180
made by, um, ocean, uh, and it was a tie-in to the, uh, of course the movie of the

1387
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:44,780
same name and it was, it was interesting because it was like, you have this

1388
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:49,460
overworld, like 2.5 D and for those watching on Twitch, you had this overworld

1389
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,740
2.5 D mode, uh, where you're walking around and, uh, you know, trying to

1390
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,220
make your way through the park.

1391
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,900
Cause you're trying to escape and so forth.

1392
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:01,540
Um, and then you had these segments of the game where you would actually go into

1393
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:08,940
pens and it was actually like a first person game, which for the super Nintendo

1394
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:12,180
at the time was very, very like rare.

1395
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,300
You didn't see a lot of, cause you know, the super Nintendo was

1396
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,060
all like Sprite driven graphics.

1397
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:22,300
So this was kind of a hard thing to kind of drive on, um, a console, but first

1398
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:28,660
person games, like this game came out in an era when like doom and Wolfenstein

1399
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,540
and all that shit was the rage.

1400
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:35,540
So, uh, I think this was kind of like to respond to that in some ways.

1401
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,860
It's like, Hey, we can do a first person shooter as well, except it was with a

1402
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:42,980
game like Jurassic park, which is almost kind of crazy in a weird, in a weird way.

1403
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:48,220
Um, so anyway, this game came out in, uh, it was actually out in the UK first

1404
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,740
and probably because it was developed, um, over there, uh, by ocean software.

1405
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:54,700
Uh, and it was released on in October of 93.

1406
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:59,020
Uh, but it came out here in North America just like weeks after that.

1407
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:02,820
And then it actually came out in Japan, uh, in June the next year.

1408
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,780
So it did see a worldwide release there.

1409
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,380
Um, and you are playing as Dr.

1410
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:11,660
Grant and you are, of course, the park is overrun by dinosaurs.

1411
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,900
You have various weapons that you use to help combat the different dinosaurs.

1412
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,620
Um, and then there's also ways that other characters in the

1413
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,820
game can communicate with you.

1414
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,020
Like you probably saw those little like polls and signs that people

1415
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,420
were, uh, talking through and so forth.

1416
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:31,580
Um, and then, yeah, the other like not so great things about this game, there

1417
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,460
was no password feature in this game.

1418
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:39,580
So if you couldn't beat this game in one sitting, then you were screwed.

1419
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:43,220
Uh, it was, it was like Rygar on the NES in that fashion.

1420
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,060
So yeah, there was no saves or any of that.

1421
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:52,380
Um, and, um, yeah, you can, I'm sure if you really wanted to see somebody beat

1422
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:55,740
this game, start to finish, there's playthroughs available now, I really want

1423
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:58,620
somebody to get to the first person part of this, I was hoping they'd get to it.

1424
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,020
Let me see.

1425
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,660
I'm going to, uh, for those that are watching on Twitch, I'm going to do a

1426
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,140
little hunt and pecking in this video here.

1427
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:03,540
Oh, there we go.

1428
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:03,860
There we go.

1429
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,780
Cause I can see a little preview.

1430
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:05,780
There we go.

1431
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:10,740
Here's some of the scary first person stuff where now he's actually in one of

1432
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,500
the, and you see, it's very inspired by like Wolfenstein 3D and then one of

1433
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:20,180
those dinos comes out rawr is going to get you and you got to love how it's

1434
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:26,380
like paired so that the story behind it is it's night vision goggles, but what

1435
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:32,220
they're doing is that notice how it's a very small area of the screen relatively

1436
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:36,620
compared to the other game footage we saw earlier, and that allows it to run

1437
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:40,820
at an acceptable frame rate on the Super Nintendo, which still isn't great.

1438
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:46,860
If you'll remember back to like the good old days of Wolfenstein 3D, that was one

1439
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:50,820
of the options that they had screen size and like you could shrink that thing down

1440
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:54,620
to like the size of a penny and, uh, it would run really fast because it's

1441
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,620
rendering less area.

1442
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,060
But yep, that's why.

1443
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:57,340
Yeah.

1444
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:57,900
Oh, boom.

1445
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:59,060
Dinosaur came out of nowhere there.

1446
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:04,540
So, yeah, no, it's very, that it's very like doom size down to like half the

1447
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,300
screen so you can play it on an older machine.

1448
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,900
That's what Jurassic Park looked like on the Super Nintendo.

1449
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,220
Um, but, uh, it was cool because there was nothing like it on the Super Nintendo.

1450
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:17,660
Like the only other thing I can think of was like Faceball 2000.

1451
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,980
You remember when that game was getting a lot of hype and it's like, that game

1452
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,140
was, that game was kind of fucking garbage.

1453
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,980
Like the only reason people were into it was because it was first person.

1454
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:33,620
And that was a new novel thing that was like just coming out in, in the nineties,

1455
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:37,100
like around 94 when this game came out was right around when doom was

1456
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,260
coming out and all of that.

1457
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,260
So, Ooh, and there's, here's the sequence where you really do have night vision

1458
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,780
goggles and everything is tinted green.

1459
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:43,700
It's kind of a cool effect.

1460
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:49,060
Uh, now one thing I think is, is notable about this as well is that, uh, it used

1461
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,940
like, uh, like it was like a surround sound type of game.

1462
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:56,420
Uh, and I remember that logo being on the screen when you would launch the game.

1463
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:00,460
And it was because of these sequences, you could hear the dinosaurs moving on the

1464
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,140
left channel or the right channel, which might not sound like a big deal in this

1465
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:09,140
day and age, cause you know, now that's, but like again, in 94, like full stereo

1466
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,700
in your games was a new thing.

1467
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:16,300
And especially in these more intense sequences, if you will, um, where you are,

1468
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:22,900
um, uh, in the first person mode, very different, by the way, I want to point

1469
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,860
out the super Nintendo version of this game, very different than the Genesis

1470
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,260
version.

1471
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:30,900
They, they have hardly anything different developers, different ideas.

1472
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:34,460
So I think it's a variable because like, you might be thinking, I played Jurassic

1473
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,900
Park and it is nothing like what Rob is talking about.

1474
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,420
That's because the super Nintendo and the Genesis games were very different.

1475
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:45,140
I think the Genesis one was generally better received, but the super Nintendo,

1476
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:48,100
I don't think it was really received well by critics because of some of these

1477
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,940
drawbacks I've talked about already, but I also feel like it's one of those things.

1478
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:52,820
Oh, it's going to play an ad.

1479
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:53,860
So I'm just going to go back to that.

1480
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:58,180
I was going to say, and I don't know if you noticed, but like it mentioned that

1481
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,460
you can click the left or right mouse button.

1482
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:03,860
That's because it supported the mouse that came with Mario Paint.

1483
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,620
It did, it did support that.

1484
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,620
And I was trying to, there was something about the super FX chip as well.

1485
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:13,140
Um, Oh no, it, they were replicating the effects of the chip in the super

1486
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,060
Nintendo hardware.

1487
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:16,380
Uh, that's what they were saying about developing the game.

1488
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:21,100
So it's this game, even though I don't think it was critically like well

1489
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,580
received, I still feel like, like you look at chat, like, you know, since I

1490
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,500
brought up this game, there's a lot of people in chat that are like, heck yeah,

1491
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,340
this game, I remember this game.

1492
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:30,940
Oh yeah.

1493
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:31,420
And this stuff.

1494
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:35,220
So I feel like maybe like a cult type of video game, like the people that played

1495
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:40,460
it, remember it because it was so like, I mean, it tied into like, what was the

1496
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:44,460
biggest movie of the decade, probably well, because Titanic was 99.

1497
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:48,780
So maybe that, but, um, but still like it tied in not just to that nostalgia,

1498
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:52,180
but like all these different type of things you weren't really seeing in other.

1499
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,740
So I think for those reasons, it's notable as a classic game, especially

1500
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,380
for something that we are completely pulling out of our ass tonight.

1501
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:04,460
Um, well, thanks to the help of chat because as that, as that was the one

1502
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,460
that Chad, that I was like, Oh yeah, I, I, uh, I forgot about that one.

1503
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:10,460
So, um, yeah, that's a good pick.

1504
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:10,980
Here it is.

1505
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,020
Your classic game of the week.

1506
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,260
Presto.

1507
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:19,900
Uh, uh, Rob's choice with the help of chat, Jurassic park, uh, on the super Nintendo.

1508
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:23,980
So we'll, we'll get the actual, uh, game that dark soccer had intended to do tonight.

1509
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,180
We'll do that next week.

1510
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,060
We'll roll that over.

1511
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:30,100
Uh, fifth dream today in chat says pulled out of your Jurassic.

1512
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,060
Yes, I like that.

1513
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:31,940
Good, good, good.

1514
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:32,820
All right.

1515
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:36,340
Let's move on and do some rapid fire news.

1516
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,140
Uh, Loki.

1517
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:38,860
All right.

1518
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:44,140
So let's talk a little bit about what's coming to game pass in the month of June.

1519
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:49,180
So, uh, the first notable thing is that you're getting a lot of kingdom hearts.

1520
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:52,900
Uh, so yes, get your, uh, kingdom hearts ready.

1521
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,500
So you've got birth by sleep.

1522
01:17:55,180 --> 01:18:12,900
Um, kingdom hearts, one final mix re chain of memories, uh, 358 slash two days, uh, kingdom hearts to final mix birth by sleep, final mix recoded, uh, dream drop distance, HD birth by sleep and a fragmentary passage.

1523
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:16,820
And then of course, uh, kingdom hearts X back cover.

1524
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:30,740
And then along with kingdom hearts, uh, you're going to be getting, uh, Bard's tail remastered and Reese snarled on console and PC, uh, battle fleet Gothic armada two on PC.

1525
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,020
Battle tech on PC.

1526
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,980
Uh, it looks like dungeon of the endless on console and PC.

1527
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,620
And then let's see, no man's sky on console and PC.

1528
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:44,300
And finally, uh, throne breaker on console.

1529
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,940
So those are all going to be out by the end of this week.

1530
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:47,700
Real quick.

1531
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:56,540
I knew I forgot something during my gaming week and I want to enhance on this a little bit because I had cut the story because I intended to talk about it during my gaming week and then forgot.

1532
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:02,220
So, uh, one of the games, thanks to game pass, I played this week was I played no man's sky on Xbox.

1533
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:08,660
And so did I end up playing no man's sky on the, on a third system for the third time?

1534
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:09,900
Yes, I did.

1535
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:12,500
So I've now, I bought the PlayStation four version.

1536
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:17,100
I bought the PC version so I could play with Alan because cross play didn't exist back then.

1537
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,820
But then the new, the big news this week, we have cross play now.

1538
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:21,100
So I didn't have to do that.

1539
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:26,260
And now I played the Xbox version just because I have game pass.

1540
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,340
Why the fuck not?

1541
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,820
Let's complete the trifecta.

1542
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:36,740
So I did play on Xbox and I will say it was probably the worst of the three because, well, here's why, here's why.

1543
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,060
I have a regular Xbox one.

1544
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:43,180
Uh, I have a PlayStation four pro.

1545
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:51,380
So to be fair, I imagine what I'm playing is the same thing that a regular PlayStation four user gets.

1546
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:59,340
But with the little extra oomph in the pro, I'm seeing something a little better than the, and then of course my PC is in pretty good shape.

1547
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,940
So what I see there is really good.

1548
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,500
Like that's probably the best of all of them.

1549
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,180
Um, so that's the only reason.

1550
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:09,500
So if you have an Xbox one X, uh, you will probably have a completely different experience.

1551
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,340
It wasn't bad.

1552
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:18,860
Like again, if you don't have no man's sky on any of the other systems and you have game pass, should you skip it on Xbox?

1553
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:21,420
Because I'm sitting here saying, no, get it.

1554
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,700
It's still worth your time.

1555
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,220
And it's a, it's a good game.

1556
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:32,420
It's just, I definitely noticed like, Oh, the draw distance and some of the pop-ins not quite as fluid as the other systems I played this on.

1557
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,180
But again, that is just because of my home setup.

1558
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:43,620
If your home setup includes an Xbox one X or a regular PlayStation four or something, you are not going to have these same issues that I had.

1559
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,380
So I say it's very well worth your time.

1560
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,580
If you have game pass, you've never checked it out before.

1561
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,940
So anyway, just, just wanted to throw that out there.

1562
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:59,100
And then, um, in other news, we've got a new RPG maker coming.

1563
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:07,140
So RPG maker MZ, uh, not much known about this yet, although there is a steam page for it.

1564
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:14,300
And it's basically saying that, uh, it looks like there's the requirements for are a little bit more of substantial.

1565
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:24,060
But other than that, don't really know, uh, what's exactly going to be involved with it, but, um, Oh, actually, no, there are some details on it.

1566
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:28,580
So it looks like they just mentioned like different, I don't know.

1567
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:31,340
A lot of this stuff mentions that they mentioned here.

1568
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,140
It looks like kind of like all the other ones.

1569
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:41,380
So they've got, you know, you can do a character generator, different events, map editor, uh, the usual trappings of a RPG maker.

1570
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:51,900
I don't really, like I said, a lot of these, I couldn't, I couldn't tell you what the difference are between a lot of these different, um, uh, RPG maker programs.

1571
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:56,580
But I'll be interesting to check it out and hopefully it comes out of sale and Humble Bundle or something like that.

1572
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,180
Cause that's where I tend to buy all those and then never use them.

1573
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:01,860
All right.

1574
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:02,980
All right.

1575
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:05,700
Let's talk a little bit about, um, arcade archives.

1576
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:16,420
You know, the arcade archives is a lot of the, uh, well, some people out there going the main games available on Nintendo switch, but hello, they're in Maine because these are arcade cabinets and things in the eighties and nineties.

1577
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:23,500
So a lot of these old games have been re-released for the switch and PlayStation four, um, through this series known as arcade archives.

1578
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:27,380
Well, arcade archives released their 100th game this past week.

1579
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:29,660
And that was sunset riders.

1580
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,380
Uh, that's a, that's a big game.

1581
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:35,940
People remember on the, uh, uh, on the arcades, uh, big Konami game.

1582
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:39,620
It was one of those, uh, like, like Ninja turtles, basically the Cowboys.

1583
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:40,140
Okay.

1584
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,700
That's what sunset riders was interesting to know.

1585
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,340
And maybe you guys, okay.

1586
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:51,620
So you guys know, I will always sing a Swan song and pour one out for Microsoft game room.

1587
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:55,140
Y'all remember, y'all remember my love for Microsoft game room on the X-Box three 60.

1588
01:22:55,140 --> 01:23:00,380
All the old, do you know what the last game was they did in Microsoft game room sunset, right?

1589
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,020
It was, there's a reason why I brought that up.

1590
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:06,500
So sunset riders is a landmark game in a couple of places here.

1591
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:10,740
So, um, anyway, is the 100th arcade archives, uh, to be released.

1592
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:20,980
And, uh, there's some cool, uh, little art that hamster, the company that's put it all together is put out hamsters also pointing out, Hey, there's official Nintendo releases and arcade archives.

1593
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:21,380
That's true.

1594
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:26,380
And still to this day, super Mario brothers versus is like one of the best selling Nintendo switch games.

1595
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:29,740
You go to the top games that are released, that game is still there.

1596
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:32,380
So that's, um, that's good.

1597
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:33,980
They've been having a lot of success with that.

1598
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:39,060
And I'm sure a lot of people will be, um, uh, looking for that, uh, sunset riders release as well.

1599
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,780
I already mentioned this a little earlier in the show.

1600
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:42,540
It's important.

1601
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,660
I'm going to mention it again.

1602
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:53,180
I do want to congratulate itch.io as their bundle for racial justice and equality has passed $6 million in donations.

1603
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,180
That is incredible.

1604
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:00,140
The indie developer scene has rallied together in a historic fashion.

1605
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,300
Quite frankly, I don't know of any other bundle.

1606
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:08,060
That's been this big or this monumentous.

1607
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,900
I mean, think about $6 million.

1608
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,700
That's two times what summer games done quick did in their record.

1609
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:22,980
And that's not, that is a hugely important thing that I would never speak ill of at all, but I'm trying to express the volume of what is happening here at itch.io.

1610
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:30,700
And that is like, they have, they have doubled over what a summer games done quick would make with this bundle, 1500 items and counting in this bundle.

1611
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:37,820
Um, one of the games they just added that I played last night for a little bit, uh, Loki, this would have to be a fave of yours too.

1612
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:40,660
Cat lateral damage is in the bundle.

1613
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:48,740
So if nothing goes, if, if the 1499 other games don't speak to you, let that one speak.

1614
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,780
But trust me, there's plenty in here that will speak to you.

1615
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,940
Let that one do the talking.

1616
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,580
Cause I love cat.

1617
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,700
Like I have that like three times over.

1618
01:24:55,700 --> 01:25:01,820
So I, cause I have it on a PlayStation, which it supports VR by the way.

1619
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:05,740
And, um, I have it on steam as well.

1620
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,300
So cool.

1621
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:15,860
Anyway, it ends Tuesday, uh, all the money being raised going for the NAACP legal defense and educational fund and the community bail fund.

1622
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:19,380
Um, so go head over to itch.io.

1623
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,500
It's you can't miss it.

1624
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,260
It's right there, front and center on the page.

1625
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:30,140
They're only asking $5 for it, but I bet you could spare 10, 15, maybe 20, uh, maybe more, who knows how you're feeling.

1626
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:36,500
And, uh, you could check out all those games and support a great cause who knows, maybe we'll get it up to 7 million by Tuesday.

1627
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:36,940
Who knows?

1628
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:37,820
Anything's possible.

1629
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:40,140
Um, six point eight already.

1630
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:46,100
Is it really, I was going to say last night, it was cause I admittedly, I was like, Oh yeah, I definitely need to get on that.

1631
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:51,260
So, uh, and a tweet reminded me like, Oh yeah, that's not going to be around forever and you want to support those causes.

1632
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:51,820
So get on it.

1633
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:53,060
So I did that.

1634
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,380
Um, and it was already at like 6.3 million.

1635
01:25:55,380 --> 01:26:00,820
So, uh, I'm not surprised at all to hear, uh, it will probably hit seven by the time Tuesday comes around.

1636
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:01,980
So don't forget y'all.

1637
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,060
Okay.

1638
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,460
Um, yeah.

1639
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:13,460
Uh, quest buster in chat says the itch IO bundle also kept growing, which is amazing from 700 something games to more than a thousand.

1640
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:14,100
Yeah.

1641
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:18,660
Like it's just like the, again, the indie developers have rallied together in a way.

1642
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:20,020
There's Celeste in there.

1643
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:23,700
I mean, Celeste is an awesome game as well that you probably would know.

1644
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:33,020
And then, uh, one that I see a screenshot for here that I've been, I forgot all about, but I was following them when they were developing the game was sky road, which is kind of like

1645
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,740
an old school, uh, flight SIM action game.

1646
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:40,380
And I don't know, there's just so much good content in there that you should really pick it up.

1647
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:44,300
2064 read only memories got added recently into that bundle.

1648
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,180
Um, there's, there's so much octodad.

1649
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:53,500
So if you're like, if you, if you want to see where, um, uh, bug snacks comes from, octodad is in there.

1650
01:26:53,700 --> 01:27:02,780
Uh, there's there, unless you are absolutely broke and just, and on a budget and cannot afford anything extra about that, you, you really owe it to yourself.

1651
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:10,700
To kick some money in and it support a good cause for one, but check out all of these amazing indie games, um, as a, as a two.

1652
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,380
So, all right.

1653
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:15,820
And yeah, questmaster also points out there are assets in there.

1654
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:19,300
There are tools, tile sets, PDF, RPG books from Indies.

1655
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:23,620
There are loops, musical loops that got my attention as well.

1656
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,020
Hundreds of board games.

1657
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,580
So, and all for a great cause.

1658
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,060
So fantastic.

1659
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:31,780
All right.

1660
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,180
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1661
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:38,420
Let's check out what's going to be coming to stores, uh, near you in the near future.

1662
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:46,780
So Loki, how about the U S so we've got a persona for golden that's coming out on PC.

1663
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,700
Uh, actually, I'm sorry that came out yesterday.

1664
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,980
I think they, I think that was a surprise.

1665
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:52,580
It's today.

1666
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:52,860
Yeah.

1667
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:54,540
So, um, okay.

1668
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:59,660
So this week we've got Desperados three that's on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1669
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:05,020
Uh, uh, disintegration on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1670
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:09,020
We've got burnout paradise remastered on Nintendo switch.

1671
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:15,180
And, uh, last but not least the last of us part two on PlayStation four.

1672
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,060
Oh, we need to mention this at some point.

1673
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:20,260
Um, because this is everywhere.

1674
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:23,620
And for whatever reason, it didn't, like it didn't, it wasn't in a story

1675
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,140
that we slotted in our show tonight.

1676
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:29,060
But Bobby talked about this on his show tonight and I was like, oh yeah, this is

1677
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,180
the thing I've been reading around on Twitter.

1678
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:30,780
This is awesome.

1679
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:34,100
Have you heard about the accessibility settings in the last of us too?

1680
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:37,460
It's like, it's setting a new standard.

1681
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:42,740
You, you can customize like everything in this game to meet your needs.

1682
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:46,340
They actually, cause I saw, I don't know if Strelok still in chat, but I know he

1683
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:49,980
was in there during Bobby black off and he was like a friend of mine actually

1684
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:54,500
consulted on like a being able for a blind person to be able to play through

1685
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,740
this game actually consulted so that somebody who's blind can play through

1686
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:58,620
the last of us too.

1687
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:03,180
That is the level of accessibility settings, where you want subtitles to

1688
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,220
be, how big they are, how little they are.

1689
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:08,660
Apparently you can do things with the difficulty where it's like, if jump

1690
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:12,580
scares are going to be bad for you, you can like, and I'm like, Oh my God.

1691
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:19,580
I, I consider myself somebody who's very fortunate to not usually have a need

1692
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:21,300
for accessibility settings in many games.

1693
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:25,660
But like to take out jump scares kind of does like, I don't like a lot of

1694
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,300
horror games because of jump scares.

1695
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:31,340
If I can get rid of that, it does make a game more accessible for me.

1696
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,780
So like, I'm all about that.

1697
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:41,140
So I just have to give a wink and a nod and a smile to how out

1698
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:43,180
of their way it almost seems.

1699
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:46,300
But then now that you see it, it's like, gosh, I hope this becomes the norm.

1700
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,260
Uh, this company went with the accessibility features.

1701
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:52,380
So a major, major props to the last of us part two for that.

1702
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:53,940
So, all right.

1703
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:58,020
Anyway, um, moving on to Japan and some of the releases over there.

1704
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,980
We have a lot of releases this week on June 18th.

1705
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:03,300
And I think it's because we've had a couple of weeks with no releases.

1706
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,980
So we're finally getting caught up this week.

1707
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:08,700
Um, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de Seven, uh, is coming out this

1708
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,460
week from Koei Tecmo in Japan.

1709
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:15,060
Uh, there's also Haruka Beyond the Stream of Time is also out as well.

1710
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:19,580
Uh, we also have a game called Variable Barricade is out as well.

1711
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,820
Mud Runner, American Wilds.

1712
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:26,860
And, uh, this game, uh, we were talking about last week, the Namkot Collection,

1713
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:29,940
which is Namco, but when they were publishing in Japan in the early

1714
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:30,940
eighties, they were Namkot.

1715
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,780
That is out in Japan this week.

1716
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:36,540
That's the one with the DMAKE of Pac-Man Championship Edition, which will

1717
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,260
come out in the States a little later.

1718
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:38,940
I'm sorry.

1719
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,980
I said those were all PlayStation 4 releases.

1720
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:42,340
Those are actually Switch titles.

1721
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:42,820
Sorry.

1722
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:43,980
I got them switched up.

1723
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:48,100
So those are all Switch titles, but I imagine, yeah, on PlayStation 4, we're

1724
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,580
going to see a very similar story.

1725
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:49,780
Yeah.

1726
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,660
It's like all the same shit on PlayStation 4.

1727
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:55,660
Um, however, uh, we also have, of course, the last of us part two also

1728
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:56,900
releasing in Japan this week.

1729
01:30:56,900 --> 01:31:00,900
So there's that they have a special PlayStation 4 pro to go with that.

1730
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:03,620
Cause we love our limited edition consoles there as well.

1731
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,620
Uh, okay.

1732
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:06,740
Namkot Collection is exclusive to Switch.

1733
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,380
It is not in the PlayStation 4 releases.

1734
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,780
So I'm glad I made that clarification.

1735
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:10,260
Sorry guys.

1736
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:11,140
All right.

1737
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:12,140
Let's move on to the UK.

1738
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:12,500
Loki.

1739
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,020
All right.

1740
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:19,420
So in the UK, we've got Desperados 3 coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox 1 and PC.

1741
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:22,740
Uh, Disintegration is coming out on PC.

1742
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:31,300
Uh, it looks like the, um, ease memory of Celceta on PlayStation 4 railway, uh,

1743
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:39,620
railway empire on the Switch, Ion Fury on PlayStation 4 and the Switch, Minimoto

1744
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:45,100
Racing X on PlayStation 4, Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Switch.

1745
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:50,660
Uh, they're also getting the last of us a part two as well on PlayStation 4.

1746
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:52,660
All right.

1747
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:56,700
And apparently, yeah, I just noticed that the Pokemon sword and shield expansion

1748
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,020
passes come out this week as well.

1749
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,420
So, oh, yeah, that's right.

1750
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:00,540
That's a big deal too.

1751
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,820
And that would be Japan U S that's everywhere.

1752
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:03,500
Yes.

1753
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:07,660
Um, I know our, our pal friend of orange, Andrea here, Shane, who we talk about one

1754
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,580
of my buddies, I play Final Fantasy 14 with a lot.

1755
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:11,940
Um, I know he is getting geared up for that.

1756
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,780
Uh, there's been a lot of events in the game with different shinies and I know on

1757
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,460
his Twitter and he talks to me about this too, he's been collecting some of the

1758
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:22,980
different, you know, Gigantamax and shinies and so forth, uh, in anticipation of the

1759
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:25,380
DLC, which is apparently introducing some new Pokemon as well.

1760
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:31,260
I think there's a Galarian Slowbro or the Evolve with Slowking.

1761
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:33,020
One of those is getting a new Galarian form.

1762
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:36,660
So there are some new Pokemon coming out, uh, as well in the DLC.

1763
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:37,540
So that's pretty exciting.

1764
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:38,780
All right.

1765
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:43,100
This is the part of the show where we would open up the mailbag over at

1766
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:46,300
participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

1767
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:53,220
Although last I looked just before showtime, we didn't have any emails and

1768
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:58,900
I'm checking now, uh, because sometimes we get them right at the top of the show.

1769
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,020
No, none, none came in.

1770
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:02,340
So everybody was feeling a little quiet this week.

1771
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:02,900
That's okay.

1772
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:08,220
Um, so participate at orange launch radio.com is the place to send your emails that

1773
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,940
we will consider reading in a future week.

1774
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:13,180
In the meantime, we have a few more news stories for you guys to talk about.

1775
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:13,740
So Loki.

1776
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:15,460
Yes.

1777
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:21,260
So there is a game, um, that Ubisoft is developing called gods and monsters that

1778
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:24,660
accidentally, uh, was uploaded to Stadia.

1779
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:29,820
And apparently of course, you know, it's not finished yet.

1780
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:34,900
So one of the things, um, once down and I guess, apparently you, you could play a

1781
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:39,140
development build of the game and they had temporary character models and assets

1782
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:45,100
that were from assassin's creed filling in as well, um, basically it says

1783
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:50,420
regretfully on Thursday morning, we mistakenly made an E3 2019 demo version

1784
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:54,260
of gods and monsters from Ubisoft available on Stadia store, and that was

1785
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,820
not intended for the public to play.

1786
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,180
A few hundred gamers were able to play it for less than 30 minutes.

1787
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:03,500
We sincerely apologize to our partners at Ubisoft for this mistake.

1788
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:08,740
And that was from, uh, Google, uh, that actually made that booboo there.

1789
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,500
Um, interesting.

1790
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:17,100
Um, it's kind of funny that, uh, you know, some of that stuff happens, but they

1791
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:22,260
said that apparently though they're looking at, uh, they're going to probably

1792
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:25,100
have, you know, announced some more details by the end of the summer.

1793
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:30,660
So I guess we'll have to wait and see what is going on with that, but kind of

1794
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:34,140
cool if you were one of the few hundred people that able to actually play that

1795
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,900
for a short period of time, you know, what this whole thing kind of made me

1796
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:41,900
think of though, especially with this being E3 week and all, you know, one of

1797
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:47,140
the more memorable E3s, I think we all remember was that year when, um, now I

1798
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,340
think, I think you, me and Jamie were all there in person that year.

1799
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:52,220
I think it was 2005 or 2006.

1800
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:53,740
No, maybe it was right after that.

1801
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:57,660
Might've been one of the airport years, because I just remember that on the

1802
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:02,500
Xbox 360, they did that whole E3 at home thing and you could download all these

1803
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:05,380
demos on your 360 and they were 2006.

1804
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:06,100
Was it 2006?

1805
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:06,260
Okay.

1806
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:06,780
It was that year.

1807
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:13,300
So yeah, it was lost planet, MotoGP 6 and something else.

1808
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:13,820
I don't remember.

1809
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:15,060
That was really cool.

1810
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:18,180
And a lot of us thought that was a really neat way to kind of participate

1811
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:19,380
with the E3 experience.

1812
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,940
Um, even if we couldn't actually be at E3 and so forth.

1813
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:29,660
So my point is now that we live in this day and age of cloud streaming games and

1814
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:34,380
being able to play games on the cloud and so forth, um, especially when it was noted

1815
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,340
that, Hey, this game was supposed to be for developers.

1816
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:38,220
It was like an internal thing.

1817
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:39,940
It was supposed to be a preview, you know, that whole type of thing.

1818
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:40,780
It's not done yet.

1819
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:44,620
Like, why couldn't we roll demos out like this?

1820
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:46,940
Like, they're never going to do that again.

1821
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:47,660
Why?

1822
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:52,220
And the reason for that is because they, what they'll do is they will show

1823
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:57,700
gameplay footage that they'll stream gameplay footage that they have control

1824
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,780
over because they can control the experience.

1825
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:04,180
And then that way they can control weather so that you don't see bugs.

1826
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:07,940
So you don't see, you know, partially developed gameplay.

1827
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:12,620
Um, it, they have a way that they can control the narrative a lot easier than

1828
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:15,660
if they were to develop demos to release on these platforms.

1829
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:20,260
And unfortunately it, it takes more development time to put out these vertical

1830
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:22,620
slice demos and stuff to show off.

1831
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:27,380
It would be cool to see that, but I don't think we're going to see AAA publishers

1832
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,740
doing this anytime soon at all.

1833
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:34,180
Um, it's just not the way that they do business anymore, especially now that we

1834
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:38,140
have these large scale, you know, streaming events, they can just stream

1835
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:42,460
gameplay, get people hyped up about it and just go from there.

1836
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:46,660
They, they don't need to have a demo put out there where people can pick it apart

1837
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:50,740
and complain about how it's terrible because it's, you know, work in progress

1838
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,540
and that type of stuff.

1839
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:53,820
So, yeah, unfortunately we're never going to see that again.

1840
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,820
Your, your answer is logical.

1841
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:56,940
It makes complete sense.

1842
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:59,140
Loki that being said, I don't like it.

1843
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:01,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

1844
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,980
That's just the way the industry is.

1845
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:03,900
I don't like it either.

1846
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:04,180
Yes.

1847
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:09,260
I would like, I don't want to, I don't want to, I want to go back to what it was.

1848
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:10,500
No, you're right.

1849
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,020
You're right.

1850
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:17,660
That it's, it's development time and deadlines for a demo that, uh, sometimes

1851
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:21,620
is poorly received and ends up affecting the game as a result.

1852
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:25,100
I get all that there, but there's that part of me and you know, people on Twitter

1853
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:29,180
and a lot of gamers like this, why can't they just do a time demo of the real

1854
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:32,900
product or why can't they do level one?

1855
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:35,140
They don't have to, they don't have to tailor it that much.

1856
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:35,660
Loki.

1857
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:41,420
You can get that now with a lot of these games that go the whole, um, early access

1858
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:41,740
route.

1859
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:46,380
So, I mean, it's, there's, there's a lot of opportunity to play stuff early and

1860
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:49,980
there's even, you know, for example, if these studios are willing to develop,

1861
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:53,220
you know, Substantial demos for their products.

1862
01:37:53,500 --> 01:38:00,500
Um, one that I keep talking about, uh, was it that I have wishlets on steam.

1863
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,100
And I was talking about it earlier this week.

1864
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:04,940
I pointed out as well is a game called one dreamer.

1865
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:07,300
They have one dream or prologue that you can go play for free.

1866
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:11,860
It's the opening act for the game and gives you a really good idea of what it's

1867
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:12,460
going to be like.

1868
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,660
And I think it's a great game and definitely worth checking out.

1869
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:19,860
Um, but that that's something that they've put together a demo for.

1870
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:20,780
So I think it depends.

1871
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:25,180
Like if I, a lot of indie developers want to get their, you know, games out there

1872
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:30,340
and get, you know, the, um, word of mouth traveling about it.

1873
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:34,460
And so they're more willing to spend the time, I think, to put together a vertical

1874
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:36,620
slice of their game so that people can check it out.

1875
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:40,580
But there's a lot of ways nowadays to be able to check out games in progress.

1876
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:46,620
Whereas back in 2006 and 2005, you may have just had like a lot of the game

1877
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,220
demo discs and stuff like that.

1878
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:52,180
Um, you didn't really have games streaming or anything like that to be

1879
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:53,780
able to see in progress stuff.

1880
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:59,620
It was, you know, what showed up in a magazine or what you saw on IGN or

1881
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:03,820
something like that during, uh, E3, or in this case, you were able to play a demo.

1882
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:07,620
I wish they would still do more of that, but it's just not going to happen because

1883
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:12,380
you know, they've had it bite them too many times where people even at E3 see

1884
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:17,100
a demo of a game and they immediately judge a game by the demo, knowing that

1885
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,100
it's not finished and they're like, well, it's terrible.

1886
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,380
I'm not going to buy this, you know?

1887
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:25,780
So, um, and then you also have the folks that like EA that want to sell you a demo

1888
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:30,020
for, you know, 30 days in advance for monthly fees.

1889
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:36,220
So I think we can count on indie game devs to, um, you know, fulfill that need

1890
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:38,700
for us, but unfortunately we're not going to see that widespread.

1891
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:39,820
Okay.

1892
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:43,460
I will, and, and, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Rob has gone full of

1893
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:47,420
Rook assault fair, but I will concede that point because this, this seems to

1894
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:51,420
happen a lot in the industry where the AAA developers have gone and moved on.

1895
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:53,340
The indie developers are here to save the day.

1896
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:54,220
So you're right.

1897
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:58,060
If I want to play some more demos, I bet there is a crap ton of indie stuff out

1898
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:00,460
there that I need to be better about looking for and supporting.

1899
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:02,900
So I think that's a good message to leave things on.

1900
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:05,660
I I'm just still shocked with this technology, Logie.

1901
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:06,460
All right.

1902
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:10,660
Uh, the fifth dream today in our chat says, remember the PlayStation VR demo disc.

1903
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:11,220
Yes.

1904
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:13,180
I guess they've updated that several times too.

1905
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:13,380
Yeah.

1906
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,460
It's digital now.

1907
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,180
There's like three different versions of it, right?

1908
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:17,260
Yeah.

1909
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,900
Well, it's digital now and they keep updating the titles in it.

1910
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:22,620
Cause obviously, you know, some of the titles in there are pretty old.

1911
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:28,020
So, um, you know, they keep updating that and that's cool that they have VR

1912
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:32,140
demos that I understand because, you know, you're getting into VR, you know, you may

1913
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:35,700
have like a brand new headset or something like that and you don't have anything to

1914
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:39,020
play, which was the case when I was playing the demo stuff.

1915
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:43,580
And it's so gave me a good idea of like what I wanted to purchase, but you know, I

1916
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:47,260
think a lot of those titles they're already complete and now they're just putting out

1917
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,460
something because they knew they needed this demo disc.

1918
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,660
It's not necessarily to showcase an upcoming game.

1919
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:55,460
Um, VR is also a challenging.

1920
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:55,660
Yeah.

1921
01:40:56,140 --> 01:41:01,140
I was gonna say VR is also a challenging thing where you can't just show VR on

1922
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:01,620
YouTube.

1923
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:06,460
You know, VR is something you kind of have to experience to see what's going to be

1924
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,140
right for you.

1925
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:11,900
Like I, I could say, I could play B roll of Tetris effect and show you what a cool

1926
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:12,940
game Tetris effect is.

1927
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:16,300
I can't describe for you.

1928
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:22,580
I can't show you, I can't explain to you why Tetris effect is better in VR.

1929
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:24,660
You just have to try it.

1930
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:28,300
And like the PS, the demo disc is a way for you to try it.

1931
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:31,220
I, and I say Tetris effect just because that's a favorite VR game of mine.

1932
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:34,620
I don't think it's actually on any of these demos, but, uh, you know, it's a lot

1933
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:38,060
of these games that they, they, they need a demo because it's really, truly the only

1934
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:39,900
way you can see what the game really is.

1935
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:41,980
Yeah.

1936
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:46,180
Or like a rez was another area X.

1937
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:46,860
Hell yeah.

1938
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:47,180
Yeah.

1939
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:52,380
Well, not even area X, but like, um, there's something, you know, Hey, area X,

1940
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:53,740
is that going to become a full game?

1941
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:55,500
I'd like to know something about that.

1942
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:00,900
I always, I was convinced that area X was the prototype for rez too, that for

1943
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:05,300
whatever reason, uh, they didn't believe there'd be enough of a market for, which

1944
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:12,100
is sad, but I, I, I full on think area X was a demo for a rez too, or a rez VR

1945
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:14,980
project that that's as far as they got basically.

1946
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:19,260
And for, they didn't, they didn't get to see the full one to fruition, which is

1947
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:21,140
sad because I fricking love rez.

1948
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:22,580
So, all right.

1949
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:26,180
Anyhow, let's talk about other technologies.

1950
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:30,740
Uh, this one coming to the Microsoft Xbox, although it's, it's weird to call

1951
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:33,140
this a new technology, it's just kind of one of those, Oh, it's just, your

1952
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:34,340
machines are getting smarter.

1953
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:39,540
So basically, um, the 25 digit codes that you may be used to having bundled in with

1954
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:42,700
your console are not going to necessarily be there anymore.

1955
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:45,740
This is like when you buy a console that has games.

1956
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:52,660
Like when I did finally buy Xbox one, I got the one terabyte Xbox one that came

1957
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:56,700
with halo anniversary collection, but it was a digital copy of halo anniversary

1958
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:57,020
collection.

1959
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:58,540
I had to put it into 25 digit code.

1960
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:02,860
What's going to happen now moving forward through a program called digital direct is

1961
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:04,940
that it's just tied to your Xbox.

1962
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:08,780
Your Xbox already knows that you're entitled to this software and it just

1963
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:14,620
shows up in a new section under your, my library section on your Xbox and that the

1964
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,060
game will be right there waiting for you.

1965
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:21,020
The first time I was going to say, honestly, I just thought it was, cause I

1966
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:25,100
know that they have the QR codes with the stuff before I was just thought it was

1967
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:27,140
the phone app and QR codes.

1968
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:30,060
That's a great way to do it.

1969
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:30,180
Yeah.

1970
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:34,700
Cause the queue they were using when Xbox one was first, first out, it was QR codes

1971
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:39,140
because they all had connect cameras and you would hold the QR code and up in the

1972
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:40,140
connect camera would scan it.

1973
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,740
Well, they could just have, they have an Xbox app, so just use a QR scanner through

1974
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:44,220
your phone.

1975
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:51,660
I mean, really smart phones, but I, in some ways this is even better.

1976
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:56,380
Cause there's no code in a QR form or otherwise there's no codes.

1977
01:43:56,700 --> 01:44:02,220
Um, so that is, uh, something, uh, that is going to be unleashed with the cyberpunk

1978
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:06,060
2077 Xbox one X that's coming out.

1979
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:10,380
Uh, I think it just came out even though the game itself is not out till September,

1980
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:13,980
but the console already knows you're entitled to the game.

1981
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:17,380
I wonder if they're doing that through like a Mac address range or something

1982
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:21,500
where like they know certain consoles manufactured, uh, are just entitled to

1983
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:21,740
this.

1984
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:23,620
I'm not sure what it really is.

1985
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:24,220
What is it?

1986
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:25,660
It's preventing resale.

1987
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:34,820
It's because smart folks will sell the game separately from the console or try

1988
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:37,460
to resell that stuff because that, that happened a lot.

1989
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:39,700
And so it's the prevent resale.

1990
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,860
That is an Intel.

1991
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,420
Wow.

1992
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:44,220
Loki with the facts tonight.

1993
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:44,980
I hate it.

1994
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:45,340
All right.

1995
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:45,780
No, just kidding.

1996
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:48,460
Uh, Bobby and chat says it's tied to the serial number.

1997
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,340
That makes sense as well.

1998
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:53,020
I also wanted to read Bobby's comment cause I'm just now seeing this about the VR and

1999
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:53,820
the demo and all that.

2000
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:57,380
Bobby says, this is why I bring my VR gear to dragon con.

2001
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:59,220
I can only show you the door.

2002
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:01,020
It is up to you to walk through it.

2003
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:01,700
And that's true.

2004
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:04,460
I was not like completely sold on VR.

2005
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:09,020
I was always kind of like, Oh, you know, my, my brain was still tied to nineties VR

2006
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,700
lawnmower man shit, which was very different.

2007
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:14,820
Like, remember when VR was big in the nineties, remember that?

2008
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:17,940
And then like it kind of went away on the mind's eye stuff.

2009
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:18,380
Yeah.

2010
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,980
At least that's what they made us think it is.

2011
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:22,580
My brain was still on that shit.

2012
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:24,860
Like I, I remember, okay.

2013
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:26,100
Storytelling time.

2014
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:32,100
I remember for whatever weird reason, the store that I used to rent video games from

2015
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:35,380
also had a VR headset that they rented.

2016
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:39,220
It was, and it was a VR headset that would hook up to your super Nintendo.

2017
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,580
All it fucking was you guys.

2018
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:45,980
It was like these glasses you put on and the TV would just be right there in front of

2019
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:46,500
your face.

2020
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:47,500
That's all it was.

2021
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:49,940
So that as you turned around, the TV was right there with you.

2022
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,940
There was, there was no fucking VR in that thing at all.

2023
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:56,060
And that Jurassic park game is one of the games that I played on it.

2024
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,980
And that's why that game scared the shit out of me.

2025
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:00,060
And it had the built in headphones on stuff too.

2026
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:04,260
But anyway, my point is, is that my perception, my brain was still kind of

2027
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:04,580
there.

2028
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:08,780
And it wasn't until I really played it at dragon con when then Bobby was like, I

2029
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:10,420
think Rob will like this.

2030
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:18,220
And I think Rob will like this music game when then I was like, Oh, Oh, okay.

2031
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:18,980
Yeah, I want this.

2032
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:26,180
And that's, that's where VR kind of struggled sometimes because it's not, it's

2033
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:30,620
not something I can just roll the VR footage and you will experience it the

2034
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:31,300
same way.

2035
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:34,460
You have to kind of actually check it out.

2036
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:35,420
All right.

2037
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:39,140
Uh, was that the Victor max or something?

2038
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:45,020
Oh, the thing I, I played with from the video store in the nineties.

2039
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:46,220
Yeah.

2040
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:50,580
It says they'll run your super Nintendo and Sega Genesis games from a Victor or

2041
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:52,940
a Victor max virtual reality headset.

2042
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:53,860
That sounds right.

2043
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:54,860
That sounds right.

2044
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:58,060
Cause all it did, you just plugged whatever it was into the headset and then

2045
01:46:58,140 --> 01:46:59,140
while it played.

2046
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,500
That sounds stupid.

2047
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:07,900
It was, but, but again, you have to remember in the nineties, VR was a

2048
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:09,500
fucking fad, right?

2049
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,900
It was the lawnmower man.

2050
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:15,500
It was all this, which was a, a novel by Stephen King that became a really shitty

2051
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:15,900
movie.

2052
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:19,820
And you know, it just, that was the stuff that was around in the nineties.

2053
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:23,900
And so somebody in a room somewhere thought, how can we get in on VR?

2054
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:27,820
What if we could make every super Nintendo game play like a VR game, but it's really

2055
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:31,500
just a piece of shit headset that just puts a TV and Freddie will make billions.

2056
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:34,100
So anyway, yeah.

2057
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:37,420
All right, moving on.

2058
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:40,820
So I don't know how we got from digital direct to stories about the lawnmower man,

2059
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:42,420
but welcome to orange launch radio.

2060
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,220
Hope you're enjoying the ride.

2061
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:44,020
Okay.

2062
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:44,940
Let's move on.

2063
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:45,500
Loki.

2064
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:47,540
All right.

2065
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:49,340
So, uh, this is kind of cool.

2066
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:54,940
So there's a brand new, um, basically it's, I think they have a crowd funding

2067
01:47:54,980 --> 01:48:02,300
campaign for a program called colors live, and it allows folks to, uh, paint on a

2068
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:08,180
Nintendo switch, but what's unique about it though, is it has a unique pen that has

2069
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:09,980
pressure sensitivity built into it.

2070
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:14,140
Now you may be asking yourself, well, how the hell is that possible considering

2071
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:19,100
that, you know, the touch screen on the Nintendo switch is not pressure sensitive.

2072
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:24,060
Well, apparently the pen actually connects through your, um, headphone jack.

2073
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:30,300
And it allows, it basically sends a sound signal to detect the pressure sense, the

2074
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:34,860
pressure, uh, part of that, whereas the stylist would just, you know, detect

2075
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,060
where you're tapping on the screen.

2076
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:39,860
So with that together, it works pretty well to be able to actually,

2077
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,140
uh, paint on your tablet.

2078
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:43,500
So it's pretty cool.

2079
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:47,300
So apparently they're going to, they have a Kickstarter for it right now.

2080
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:52,780
Um, and apparently the bundle with the app and the pen together will run

2081
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:54,100
$41.

2082
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:54,900
Oh, wow.

2083
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:58,900
Um, so yeah, or let's see here.

2084
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:01,340
Apparently, I don't know if it's been done.

2085
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,180
It says sign up to be notified.

2086
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,500
Has this been completed yet?

2087
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:05,540
Yes.

2088
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:08,460
So apparently that, uh, just ended.

2089
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:13,180
And of course they looks like they did hit their backing on that, but, uh,

2090
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:18,660
colorslive.com if you're interested in checking that out now that it's, um, over.

2091
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:21,660
But it's an interesting piece of tech though.

2092
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:25,740
Um, I'm curious to see how that's going to work with, you know, whether

2093
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:29,860
games are going to have there, but apparently this is a long live of, uh,

2094
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:33,060
they've had other colors apps.

2095
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:37,980
Um, so they had one out apparently back on the original DS, uh, they had one

2096
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:42,780
for the 3DS called colors 3D, and now they have this colors live with this new pen.

2097
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:48,660
So it'd be interesting to see, uh, what that looks like when it comes out.

2098
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,020
I want to see it at retail.

2099
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:56,620
Um, so, uh, this Nintendo switch does a lot of neat things and that we're

2100
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:00,620
starting to hear like some of the things that it can kind of do with the technology

2101
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:04,300
that, um, weren't always advertised.

2102
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:06,500
And this is, I think one of those things was like, oh, it's this app that kind of

2103
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:10,500
unlocks more things we're not used to seeing on the Nintendo switch and my brain

2104
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:13,900
went to another game that I've been playing this week that I completely forgot

2105
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:15,060
to talk about during my gaming week.

2106
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:18,540
Cause I'm just, my brain's going a hundred miles an hour, but I need to

2107
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:22,340
talk about clubhouse games because that came out on the Nintendo switch this past

2108
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:23,780
week or the week before as well.

2109
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:25,020
And so I've been playing that.

2110
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:28,540
And the reason why I'm bringing it up now with this, uh, other art story, this talk

2111
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:31,140
is about like different technologies that we're unlocking within the switch.

2112
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:35,540
Did you know, because I didn't, that clubhouse games uses that, and I think

2113
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:41,180
they call it mosaic technology where when you lie the switch down flat, it

2114
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,100
creates a multi-screen experience.

2115
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:46,780
I had no idea clubhouse games supported this, but it does.

2116
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:49,420
How well does that work with like the switch light?

2117
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:50,980
Does that work with the switch light?

2118
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:52,620
I don't know yet.

2119
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:57,020
I will answer that question next week because, uh, my husband has a switch

2120
01:50:57,020 --> 01:50:59,260
light and I keep meaning to try this with him.

2121
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:00,220
I just haven't yet.

2122
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:05,420
Um, however, that being said, one of the games that I know this does this in

2123
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:07,300
clubhouse games is the slot car game.

2124
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:10,460
So the slot car game is, you know, the old slot where you pull the trigger

2125
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:11,540
and the car goes faster down.

2126
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:14,740
So there's a lot of tracks that you just, you know, you have on the screen.

2127
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:17,900
If you put two switches next to each other, it makes a track

2128
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:20,060
that goes across both switches.

2129
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:21,700
But here's the crazy part.

2130
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:27,460
You could put one switch vertical, one switch horizontal, one switch vertical

2131
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:31,220
under that, and like a weird, and it will make a track that goes across all the

2132
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:32,420
screens and the way you've laid it out.

2133
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:34,060
It's pretty cool.

2134
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:34,660
That's rad.

2135
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:35,860
That is rad.

2136
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:38,940
And nobody, and I think very few people are talking about it because

2137
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:40,340
it's in fucking clubhouse games.

2138
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:43,220
Um, there is also the piano man.

2139
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:45,540
I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I love clubhouse games.

2140
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,820
I shouldn't like say, oh, it's just club.

2141
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:49,300
Actually this, this game doesn't get enough credit.

2142
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:51,700
It was bad-ass on the DS and it's bad-ass now.

2143
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:54,820
So there's also, there's a piano thing.

2144
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:58,380
So if you put, if you just play it, like you have it down, you can play

2145
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:59,420
like you're playing a piano.

2146
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:04,660
If you put another switch next to that, do now it's a two octave piano.

2147
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:07,100
And you can play like, yeah.

2148
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:07,620
Right.

2149
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:11,180
So who knew the switch could even be a switch?

2150
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:14,340
Who knew the switch could even do this, but you're right.

2151
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:17,340
I have no idea how the switch light messes with that.

2152
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:19,340
So I'll try to see if that still works.

2153
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:22,060
Um, Comments and chat.

2154
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:25,020
Uh, let's start to see you says, oh yeah, the wife and I have had

2155
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:26,220
sessions of clubhouse games.

2156
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:27,500
Just waiting on the fog nights.

2157
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,540
Yeah, I know we need to get to that.

2158
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:31,340
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says Mario party does this too.

2159
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:32,660
I'm loving clubhouse games.

2160
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:34,620
I probably already spent 10 hours on it.

2161
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:34,900
Yeah.

2162
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:38,100
I'm kicking myself for not bringing it up earlier, but I've been trying to

2163
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:40,460
produce the show and be a star on it.

2164
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:42,700
Um, all at the same time.

2165
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:44,540
So sometimes I forget to talk about things.

2166
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:47,100
Uh, but yeah, clubhouse games is, is cool.

2167
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:49,500
And I love that it like, oh yeah, they, they're, they

2168
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,940
aren't even advertising really.

2169
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:53,300
I mean, it's probably out there on a blog somewhere, but that

2170
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,820
the mosaic thing is in it.

2171
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:56,180
And it's, it's bad-ass.

2172
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:57,100
It's so cool.

2173
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:57,780
So.

2174
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,980
I'll have to find out about the switch light though.

2175
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:04,580
Now real quick, because you know, you know, people in chat are asking

2176
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:06,220
about the VR headset experience.

2177
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:11,540
I was talking about, uh, bonds double 06 in chat said, um, my girlfriend

2178
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:14,940
loved your rant, got her coming over to the PC to listen to your story.

2179
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:20,020
Uh, my girlfriend wants to ask how let down you were that day that

2180
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:21,300
I played the VR headset.

2181
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,420
And my answer was I was 12.

2182
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:24,540
It was fucking rad.

2183
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:26,660
Like I wasn't let down.

2184
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:28,180
I was a little bit like, well,

2185
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:31,620
It's a time when like the virtual boy is like, oh my God, this is the future.

2186
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:35,500
You know, it's like, I wish it was in color, but yeah.

2187
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:37,420
It was still amazing.

2188
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:38,900
Like I was 12 and I didn't care.

2189
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:44,020
And now, now that I'm looking back on it, I'm like, you know, it was actually

2190
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:49,900
kind of cool that like, cause my, my mom always would complain, like, you

2191
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:55,700
know, that she wanted to watch TV, Rob, get off the TV so I can watch such and

2192
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:58,420
such, or it was that more, she had a TV in her bedroom, so sometimes it was when

2193
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:01,380
her and my dad wanted to watch something, get off the TV.

2194
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:02,140
Right.

2195
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:06,060
But if I had one of these little headsets, they could use the TV and I

2196
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:07,500
could play a game on my little headset.

2197
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:11,620
So, but again, we only, I, I never, you think I'm going to be able to

2198
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:15,300
convince my mom to, can you buy me a $500 headset so you can play?

2199
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:16,700
No, that wasn't going to fly.

2200
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:19,980
So I only got to rent it like once or twice and play with it that way.

2201
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:20,460
That was it.

2202
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:22,420
So anyway.

2203
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,060
All right.

2204
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,940
Uh, Bobby says the mosaic thing was in all the trailers.

2205
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,620
I guess I just completely overlooked.

2206
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:31,300
I didn't, I didn't need the trailers.

2207
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:34,940
When I heard Clubhouse Games was coming to Switch, I was like, sold.

2208
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:37,180
I, I didn't need anything else.

2209
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:39,140
So maybe that's why I just totally missed it.

2210
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:39,580
I don't know.

2211
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:43,940
Uh, Questbuster in chat says young me was floored when I tried out a VR rig

2212
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:47,180
at Epcot, not by the weight of the headset or the giant cable that came

2213
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:48,900
out the back, but by the experience.

2214
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:49,380
Oh yeah.

2215
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:49,820
You know?

2216
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:54,580
And again, especially if you're younger, like you, technology is so much cooler.

2217
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,420
Speaking of things we enjoyed when we were younger, and I think this is a good note

2218
01:54:58,420 --> 01:55:01,660
to end on tonight, guess what's coming back in mobile form.

2219
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:02,260
That's right.

2220
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:03,500
Neopets.

2221
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:08,740
Neopets that started in 1999.

2222
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:11,900
Neopets is older than this show.

2223
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:13,100
And that's saying something.

2224
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:16,540
Neopads I never got in on.

2225
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:20,900
So Neil will remember in the early days of OLR Loki, like Jamie and I were

2226
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:25,180
playing this shit all the time and talking about our stupid Neopets on the show.

2227
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:25,740
How was your game?

2228
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:27,100
I completely blocked that out from my brain.

2229
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:31,660
Well, let me remind you, my friend, we used to talk about that during our

2230
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:36,700
gaming weeks, all that fucking Neopets shit and, uh, Neopets it's still around.

2231
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:37,580
It never went away.

2232
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:43,660
It's always still been there, but now just now in the year 2020, Neopets

2233
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:44,900
put out a tweet this week.

2234
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:49,060
Now you can do Neopets on desktop and on mobile.

2235
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:55,020
So if you, uh, abandoned your Neopet in 1999 and haven't fed it in what, 20

2236
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:00,020
years, uh, good news is your Neopet is not dead, uh, your Neopet will still be

2237
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:03,660
there, uh, and you can check on it in a mobile form if that is something,

2238
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:05,860
um, that you're interested in doing.

2239
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:09,500
This whole thing was really just a ruse for me to ask the chat.

2240
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:11,700
I'm going to ask yourself out.

2241
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:14,420
I want to know who's still playing Neopets out yourself.

2242
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:16,340
Who's still playing Neopets?

2243
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,620
Uh, bonds double 06 fesses up.

2244
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:20,940
I still play Neopets.

2245
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:22,420
I got the update for mobile.

2246
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:26,300
Um, let's see what other comments, uh, orange, right.

2247
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:30,020
Says probably haven't fed my Neopet in about a decade or so pixel pocket says,

2248
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:33,500
I mean, you could play it on your phone, but it wasn't optimized for it in any way.

2249
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:35,420
But you knew that.

2250
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:37,380
So you tried wink.

2251
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:37,820
All right.

2252
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:42,380
Uh, let's see a fifth dream today said I tried a month or so ago, but

2253
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:43,940
I can't get into my account.

2254
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:46,340
Um, so I love it.

2255
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:52,180
You guys are, uh, I seriously, I think the email address that was tied to my Neopets

2256
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:57,580
account, I don't use anymore, so I don't even know if I could get into my Neopets

2257
01:56:57,580 --> 01:56:59,020
account even if I wanted to.

2258
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:00,300
So there's that.

2259
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:03,140
What in the world is my cat doing?

2260
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:06,900
I'm sorry you guys, but he's got his eye on something.

2261
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,220
He's jumping up on the counter.

2262
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:09,700
I don't know.

2263
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:12,700
Hopefully he must've seen other daddy coming in here and thinking at that

2264
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:16,220
minute was feeding time, even though he's already eaten, but I'm just, I'm

2265
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:16,940
keeping an eye on him.

2266
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:17,220
All right.

2267
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:17,900
Anyway, sorry guys.

2268
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:22,580
So this is the part of the show where we open up our listener round table.

2269
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:25,820
And if you have any questions or comments or you want me to tell more VR headset

2270
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:29,020
stories from the nineties, I certainly will, uh, speak up in our chat room over

2271
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:33,380
at twitch.tv slash vog network while we wait and gather some questions or

2272
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:33,980
comments.

2273
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:37,820
Uh, I'm going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories like I usually do at

2274
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:38,220
this point.

2275
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:41,700
Um, I don't really have too much.

2276
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:46,620
I remember we had talked about, um, the PlayStation five and how you wish there

2277
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:47,740
was more color options.

2278
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:50,780
And I said that there's probably a skinning company already doing it.

2279
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:54,740
Well, I already see that dbrand has a PS five listed on their site with skin

2280
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:55,300
options.

2281
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:59,140
You know, there's going to be third party stuff out the wazoo.

2282
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:00,380
Anyway, there's certainly that.

2283
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:02,780
Yeah, we already got some comments in chat.

2284
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:03,140
Love it.

2285
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:04,580
Hype mayhem says Rob.

2286
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:04,860
Okay.

2287
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,900
So I grabbed that samurai showdown collection.

2288
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:09,380
That's free on Epic and I've been playing that.

2289
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:11,180
I love it.

2290
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:14,740
If only for samurai showdown four, which I played the shit out of while in

2291
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:17,620
college, did you and Loki get that freebie on Epic?

2292
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:18,900
What are your thoughts on it?

2293
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:20,580
I did grab the freebie.

2294
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:21,740
I haven't played it yet.

2295
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:24,620
Sorry, but I'm looking forward to doing so because I don't remember samurai

2296
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:26,820
showdown four as much, but I definitely remember the first two.

2297
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,820
Um, so I will check that out.

2298
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:30,580
Loki, did you grab that free on Epic store?

2299
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:31,420
So I think there's that.

2300
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:32,340
And there's the freebies.

2301
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:32,620
Yeah.

2302
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:33,500
Well, there's that.

2303
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:34,420
There's art or not.

2304
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:36,100
Yeah, for sure.

2305
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:39,540
Uh, and you know, we, we love our, don't forget.

2306
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:42,940
Not only is there that samurai showdown collection, but if you're a Twitch, uh,

2307
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:46,380
prime person, there's Neo Geo stuff at the wazoo.

2308
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:48,020
That's free on Twitch prime right now.

2309
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:49,100
If you use the Twitch app.

2310
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:50,980
So don't, here's your reminder.

2311
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:54,060
If you're sitting there right now, if you haven't claimed those games, get on it.

2312
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:57,780
Uh, and, um, if you want to say thanks, you could always toss your

2313
01:58:57,780 --> 01:58:59,220
free sub over to VOG network.

2314
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:00,300
We definitely appreciate that.

2315
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:03,780
Uh, and you get access to our video archives with all the old shows.

2316
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:07,500
Of course, the audio content is free as it has been for the last 18 years.

2317
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:12,340
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is asking favorite clubhouse games.

2318
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:13,540
Great question.

2319
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:18,700
Uh, my favorite, probably speed, honestly, because I remember playing

2320
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,620
that when I was a kid and I don't think I've played that since I was a kid.

2321
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:25,580
So the fact that like speed of all things is in clubhouse

2322
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:26,620
games is pretty awesome.

2323
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:30,180
Now, you know, with 51 games, there's going to be some stinkers though.

2324
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:37,020
Uh, and like Loki, one of the 51 games in clubhouse games is war.

2325
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:39,180
Do you know what game war is?

2326
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:41,460
Have you ever played war?

2327
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:42,900
Yeah, I've played war.

2328
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:43,740
Yeah.

2329
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:46,620
It's just turn over the card and the highest card wins.

2330
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:47,420
That's war.

2331
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:49,780
Like we got to pad this out.

2332
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:54,260
Let's pad this out with some, they, they try, they, what they do.

2333
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:55,940
And I've never seen war played this way.

2334
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:57,740
I've seen war played two ways.

2335
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:00,220
I've seen cut the deck and play it that way.

2336
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:05,020
I've seen spread out an ocean and each person picks a card from

2337
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:06,420
the ocean and does it that way.

2338
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:12,220
This one, hold on, y'all, you put three cards face down in front of you and you

2339
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:14,340
pick which of the three cards you're going to turn over.

2340
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:18,180
Ooh, that's so thrilling.

2341
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:19,260
I know, right?

2342
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:23,580
So anyway, I, I don't want to dwell on the negative cause I love clubhouse games, but

2343
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:27,300
that was definitely one of the games that made me go Nintendo, please.

2344
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,860
Um, yacht dice.

2345
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:32,300
Cause it's just yacht, it's Yahtzee, but it was originally, you know, yacht dice.

2346
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:36,860
Uh, and the six, the six ball, the battle balls, what did, what did it call it?

2347
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:38,500
Six ball puzzle, something like that.

2348
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:39,860
I like that one too.

2349
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:42,300
Um, let's see.

2350
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:43,780
Oh, and a last card.

2351
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,900
That's just Uno, but under a different name.

2352
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:50,620
I did, I forced myself to learn how to play president because I was like, is

2353
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:51,740
this the game I thought it was?

2354
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:54,260
And it wasn't, but I learned a new game.

2355
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:55,580
So that's kind of cool.

2356
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,220
Like it's kind of fun to learn a new game on clubhouse games.

2357
02:00:58,260 --> 02:00:59,020
So there was that.

2358
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:01,180
Uh, let's see, going to some comments from chat.

2359
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:03,580
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, yeah, I hate war.

2360
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:05,980
I played it enough to get the gold trophy and then turned it off.

2361
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,780
Sevens is my jam.

2362
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:09,900
Dark Tetsuya says Renegade is my jam.

2363
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:15,220
Um, Orange Wright says, even the fun fact says that traditional war isn't even a game.

2364
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:20,620
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, one of the things that's interesting about Klondike is that

2365
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:25,060
it will tell you immediately when you lose, not when you've gone through all the

2366
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:28,380
cards, but it will tell you immediately when you lose.

2367
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,740
So you can just undo once and try something different.

2368
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:32,260
Yeah.

2369
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:37,420
And, uh, Bobby Blackwell says, president is kind of like great Dow multi.

2370
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:41,860
You know, there are so many card games out there that you probably know

2371
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:43,780
under a different house variation.

2372
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:45,420
Um, this was funny.

2373
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:45,700
Okay.

2374
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,060
So I'm going to tell a work story.

2375
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:51,500
So we were talking about games, um, because it was like our team building

2376
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:54,300
call and we were talking about like, what's a game that you have fond memories of.

2377
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:59,780
And one of the people on the call brought up that her family

2378
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,660
really liked to play BS.

2379
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:02,700
Right.

2380
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:04,100
Have you ever played that card game?

2381
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:08,900
Bullshit, basically where you say you put the cards face down and you're like,

2382
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:13,860
I am playing two sevens and somebody says bullshit and you turn them over.

2383
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:17,740
And if you didn't actually play two sevens, you have to take all the cards

2384
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:18,460
that have been laid down.

2385
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:20,900
And if somebody miscalled you on it, they have to take all the cards.

2386
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:21,060
Right.

2387
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:24,260
So you've probably played this game at some point, but she said, because they

2388
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:30,380
didn't want to say bullshit in front of the kids, they call the game blue salmon

2389
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:32,580
or something like that.

2390
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:33,380
I think that's what it was.

2391
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:35,700
It was a blue salmon or something like that.

2392
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:37,180
So that's, that's what they play.

2393
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,260
They play blue salmon.

2394
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:44,020
And so, and that's what they either blue salmon or was it, was it blue?

2395
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:45,500
I don't know.

2396
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:47,700
Uh, something badgers, I don't know.

2397
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:51,780
But anyway, so people come up with all these different names and come to think

2398
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:56,420
of it, I even remember years ago when I was in church.

2399
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:57,660
So this was a long time ago.

2400
02:02:57,660 --> 02:02:58,020
Okay.

2401
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:02,780
Uh, we played bullshit, but it was called, I don't know, or no, it was called, I

2402
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:04,700
don't, I don't think so.

2403
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:05,300
Or something like that.

2404
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:09,220
You just, you say, I don't think so is what you would say, uh, instead of bullshit.

2405
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:11,900
So anyway, yeah.

2406
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:13,940
Uh, SG-100 Matt says bull spit.

2407
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:14,460
Yep.

2408
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:14,980
Yep.

2409
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:15,540
Bull spit.

2410
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:15,860
Yeah.

2411
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:17,260
Boy scout.

2412
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:19,420
So there it is.

2413
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:21,140
How funny.

2414
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:23,060
SG-100 Matt says, that's what my grandmother told me.

2415
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:24,060
It was bull spit.

2416
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:29,660
That's a really, I love the stories we get told as kids.

2417
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:30,140
All right.

2418
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:32,180
Any lies you're telling your children, Loki?

2419
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:35,620
I don't know.

2420
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:37,780
Probably.

2421
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:38,460
All right.

2422
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:42,620
Oh, Bobby Blackwell says, I doubt it was the name of it in the DS games.

2423
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:43,100
That's right.

2424
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:44,900
Oh, as that said, the broccoli farm.

2425
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:46,660
Well, the listeners with the receipts.

2426
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:49,460
Well, I love it.

2427
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:50,580
All right.

2428
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:53,380
Uh, Loki, any other last minute stories?

2429
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:58,060
Yes, this is, uh, it's interesting.

2430
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:04,460
So I don't know if you remember back to the Simpsons where there was a gag where I think

2431
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:11,460
Bart was playing a, a golf game called a Lee Corrello's putting challenge is like some

2432
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:12,780
really terrible game.

2433
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:14,980
Well, apparently someone's decided to make that a real thing.

2434
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:21,740
And so you can now play that for free and it's, uh, so, uh, it's pretty funny.

2435
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:25,140
They actually put together the game using sound clips from the show.

2436
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:30,060
I love that somebody went to the links to actually make it a real thing.

2437
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:30,580
That's great.

2438
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:32,220
The Simpsons predicting the future yet again.

2439
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:33,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

2440
02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:35,460
Yeah, it looks like Martin was playing that.

2441
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:40,340
So, um, that's funny, but neat.

2442
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:41,460
That's it.

2443
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:42,380
All right.

2444
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,780
Well, I think that's it from our chat room as well.

2445
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:47,260
So this is the part of the show where we're going to wrap things up.

2446
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:50,580
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show this week or listening

2447
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:52,660
to us live, however you consume orange launch radio.

2448
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:54,700
We really appreciate you guys being here.

2449
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:57,260
And if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange laundry, you know, tell a friend or

2450
02:04:57,260 --> 02:05:00,820
two, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but

2451
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:05,700
we need, we need those voices to be here to help, uh, help us, uh, spread, spread, spread

2452
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:08,140
the chat and the love and the different perspectives that we have.

2453
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:11,700
Spread the chat and the love and the different perspectives and all that good stuff.

2454
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:14,260
Uh, we will be back in seven days.

2455
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:16,420
I'm sure there's going to be more gaming news this week.

2456
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:18,660
This is probably going to be a pretty busy month for gaming news.

2457
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:21,460
It's not going to happen all at once, but like slow, slow trickle

2458
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:23,140
through probably all the summer.

2459
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:25,660
Do we have any big events that we don't necessarily, Oh, the EA, we talked

2460
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:27,580
about the earlier show, so the EA events this next week, right?

2461
02:05:27,580 --> 02:05:30,340
So we'll maybe I'll get, Oh my gosh.

2462
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:33,820
Maybe Jamie and I get to spend three hours talking about a mass effect

2463
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:35,140
trilogy remaster next week.

2464
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:36,340
I really hope that's the case.

2465
02:05:36,620 --> 02:05:37,620
Fingers and toes crossed.

2466
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:42,820
So maybe, or more Sims or I don't know, new star Wars game.

2467
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:43,860
There's that for sure.

2468
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:44,500
We know that one.

2469
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:45,780
I don't feel, yep.

2470
02:05:46,180 --> 02:05:48,900
So that'll be some exciting stuff to talk about next week is as much

2471
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:53,420
shit as EA sometimes gets, uh, there's some pretty darn good games that come

2472
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:56,140
out of it, so we'll, uh, we'll, we'll be looking at that for next week.

2473
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:56,900
And who knows what else?

2474
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:59,300
Uh, so we'll be back in seven days to do that all again.

2475
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:01,980
Thank you so much for downloading, uh, the feed.

2476
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:03,580
Uh, and thank you so much.

2477
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:06,980
Uh, for those of you guys that are listening live as well.

2478
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:10,260
Um, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend, leave a nice five

2479
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:11,620
star review on a place like iTunes.

2480
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:13,940
I don't think we've gotten a review on iTunes in like three years.

2481
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:17,700
Um, but I would appreciate if someone would leave one tonight, um, or

2482
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:19,060
wherever it is you found this show.

2483
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:22,460
Uh, I know a lot of you are listening on Spotify, uh, and other places as well.

2484
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:24,540
Maybe you're listening directly at vognetwork.com.

2485
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:25,140
That's fine too.

2486
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:26,300
However, you're listening to the show.

2487
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:28,180
I appreciate you being here.

2488
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:28,980
Thank you so much.

2489
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:30,900
Um, I think that's it.

2490
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:32,980
I think we get to give our final thoughts now.

2491
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:34,980
So, um, I'll start.

2492
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:38,700
Um, my final thought tonight is, uh, black lives still matter.

2493
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:41,700
Black trans lives, especially still matter.

2494
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:43,180
It is pride month.

2495
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:48,620
Let us not forget that pride was a riot that was started by trans

2496
02:06:48,620 --> 02:06:49,860
women, black trans women.

2497
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:51,980
So, uh, don't forget, don't forget that.

2498
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:54,780
Um, that's, that's what I got.

2499
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:55,300
Loki.

2500
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:59,780
I'm going to probably end up playing more Minecraft this week

2501
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:03,060
because I'm stuck in that loop.

2502
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:05,540
So I need to stream some.

2503
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:07,860
All right.

2504
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:10,260
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Onch Radio.

2505
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:12,340
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight.

2506
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:16,940
Uh, we will see you next time here at Orange Onch Radio, uh, in seven days

2507

02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:19,180
Uh, happy gaming.

2509
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:19,980
Enjoy it.

2510
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:21,340
There's a lot of good stuff out there.

2511
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:22,540
Uh, enjoy it.

2512
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:25,300
