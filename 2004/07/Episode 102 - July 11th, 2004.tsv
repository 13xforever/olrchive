6292	10874	Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?
10894	11434	That's right.

14956	16316	Have you seen Malcolm?
16376	16717	Lena?
17137	20678	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.
20998	21719	So it was you.
22611	23652	I was going to expose you.
23872	24212	I know.
24793	26094	So I choose to expose myself.
26374	27815	Please, they're our ladies' presents.
28055	30277	That would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
30437	31678	DarkSakura.
31979	34020	Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!
34541	35161	Skye.

53049	56651	for this July the 11th, 2004.
57111	63614	You're listening to the internet's most vacationing radio station of all things bee money.
64254	64914	And then some.
65615	68656	I'm one of your happy campers, Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.
69417	74759	Joining me as always is the happiest bunny in our camp, Counselor Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
76540	77340	Your mic's not on, babe.
77640	78521	Oh, is it on now?
78541	79101	There we go, yes.
79907	81647	Don't let me counsel anybody.
82367	84708	My advice will be, get a gun.
86588	87048	Get a gun.
90309	94410	I lost the whole script and the whole computer upgrade thing, so I had to just rewrite it just now.
94490	96510	Ew.
96650	98650	I like this camp theme we've got going.
98670	100031	Wait till you hear this next line, okay?
100051	100331	Rob?
100631	100851	What?
101291	102111	I hated camp.
103051	103431	Exactly.
103451	104231	Wait till you hear this next line.
104751	108252	Also say hello to our Fire Marshal Tech Master Loki.
109622	111683	You so ripped that off from In Living Color.
111883	112324	I don't care.
113564	113985	I don't care.
116446	118707	Joining us tonight also, we have some very special guests.
119848	123050	Say hello to our guests, I guess, as in singular.
123490	125231	Say hello to Bud!
126092	126872	Hello to Bud.
128113	129033	Also known as Neil.
129754	131635	You don't have a fancy stage last name, though.
131655	132135	You want one?
132756	132976	No.
133356	134957	What can we give Neil as a last name?
136601	139225	Neil, I'll let our chat room think about that one.
139986	143751	You can join our chat room, www.orangeslawntrader.com.
143791	147737	Yes, we have not been here for like three weeks now.
147777	149099	Jamie hasn't been here in a month.
149880	151282	That's because I had shit to do.
152722	159488	Okay, I have a friend who was at UCSD for like six years in the math program of all things.
160008	161930	How could I pass up her graduation party?
161970	164212	I think that was the week we ended up not having a show anyway.
164252	165433	You were gone the week before also.
165453	167975	The week before I was being a lusty wench.
168535	169896	Oh yeah, that's right.
169916	172639	I remember that now because we were making fun of the Ren Faire on the show while you weren't here.
173159	178944	I was like, I had a good time at the Ren Faire but they didn't have any meat and it pissed me off.
179485	181206	But you have meat now, right?
181387	181707	No.
182267	182628	Mead.
183068	183408	Oh, mead.
183428	184189	I thought you said meat.
184329	185069	Brewed honey.
185210	185690	Oh, never mind.
187451	188752	Sorry, I have a dick in my ear.
189973	190254	Well.
193076	194477	You know they have surgery for that, Rob.
194577	197599	All that TMI and plenty more when we come back.
198180	200742	There's like three weeks of ranting to catch up on.
201442	202804	So much Bomani news.
202844	203324	Oh, yes.
204540	205061	Not really.
205341	208283	I mean, basically, I could wrap it up right here.
208303	209224	Funny news.
209725	211046	They have plenty of funny news.
211406	214669	DDR was in the media because somebody lost weight.
214929	215450	There you go.
215590	217311	There's more than that.
217331	219213	DDR was in the media because somebody had a heart attack.
219273	220494	You're right, there's more than that.
220534	226400	We'll be talking about that when we come back after this set of just some DDR music I wanted to play.
227932	231440	And then we'll be back and we'll get started with the catching up.
231921	236070	Tell everybody you know, Orange Lounge is back on the air and we're taking names.
236271	236732	We'll be back.
330182	330748	Thank you for watching!
364723	369003	I'm a veteran now, which means that I've been in the game too long Since the day that they prevented me way back when
451485	452147	La Senorita
491570	498351	Orange Lounge Radio Mamani Music And more Perfect
520223	521224	Indeed, perfect.
521344	523005	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
523045	526007	Here we are, back with episode number 102.
526547	530009	We are live... You made a promo and didn't tell me.
530509	532270	You know what was going on last night?
532591	536393	I was playing with this new software program because I've been looking for stuff for... You made a promo?
537414	538454	You want to hear it one more time?
538854	539375	Hold on.
542417	543717	Orange Lounge Radio.
544318	545158	Mamani Music.
545839	546279	And more.
546399	546819	Perfect!
546859	547700	Perfect!
549110	549570	Yeah, I know.
549970	550591	Shut up, Loki.
551051	552152	At least I put some effort out.
552172	553772	I was like, what the hell was that?
555813	557494	OMG WTF BBQ.
557534	562797	Well, okay, I've been playing with some new toys for Diversion because... Okay, let's back this up a little bit.
563177	563617	Let's back it up.
563917	567479	Obviously, you might have heard, I got a new kind of computer thing going on.
567519	571861	I finally put in the stuff that Squeenix gave me at E3 when I won the Ballista thing.
572381	577644	And I put them in a couple weeks ago, and of course that's what caused the show to not be here a couple weeks ago.
578355	591719	But it's given me some time to like play with some new things install some new software that didn't run good before and one of them is like this Mixing program that I was thinking about using for diversion because I thought would be really cool to have like the Bomani music Remixed remixes mixing together.
591979	600921	I thought be pretty cool, but unfortunately the software had problems of its own But it sounds really really good if you have like these short like 10-second promos like stringing the music together and
601161	604423	So I made a bunch of like, well not a bunch, but like three quickie little promos.
604463	604964	Little bumpers.
605184	606205	Little bumpers, exactly.
606245	606785	Little bumpers.
606905	607466	Mini bumpers.
607786	609267	Not really promos, but mini bumpers.
609727	613190	But since... The buggy baby... Shut up.
614270	617273	Rubber baggy... Baggy Bumani bumpers.
618333	618633	I don't know.
619553	621274	So, I'll play some more of those tonight.
621294	623794	Because now, that program fucking sucked.
623854	626555	Because after about 30 minutes and all my audio starts skipping.
626575	627235	So I can't use it.
627575	632016	So now I have those little rubber baby Bomani bumpers and nothing to use them for.
632657	633837	So, I'll play them tonight.
634137	636017	Because everybody bitches that we never have new promos.
636237	637098	So, you get those.
641059	641339	Alright.
641819	646580	So, I guess we have to start this episode off with a bit of an apology.
647486	648686	Sorry, we had lives.
649907	650187	Okay.
650707	652987	Hold on, I'm finding some apology music here.
653908	656208	Because as you may or may not know, this is our first show.
656248	657608	When was episode 101?
657669	659109	I would have to get out a calendar to look.
659729	661950	What?
662970	664130	I can't find that song that quick.
665891	667691	Yeah, it was before my birthday.
667711	668411	I remember that much.
669091	669571	Or was it?
669892	670052	No.
670112	670792	It was before.
670992	672472	Yeah, it was the week before my birthday.
672512	674213	So it would have been like the 18th or something.
674273	675833	So gosh, we got a lot of ground to cover.
677383	679544	Okay, so we're going to play some apology music here.
679584	680705	I'm looking for it.
681845	682286	There we go.
682626	685628	This is some nice little gothy apology music.
689470	700076	Dear listeners of Orange Lounge Radio, we offer our condolences and Jamie's hairball for not being live for the past two weeks.
701177	705940	Jamie offers her special condolences for not being here for the past three weeks.
706607	716992	She's missed you all dearly But my aim is improving And she coughs up this hairball especially for you It tastes like tri-tip You see
718123	728856	What we decided to do two weeks ago was for you, the listener, we decided to upgrade our boards and studios so that we could have faster and better audio for those of you guys.
728916	730678	And plus I would have much less headache running the show.
731078	735103	So we let our tech master Loki, I'm going to blame it on him, upgrade the computer.
735323	736344	Blame it on Squinnix.
736364	738387	Blame it on Microsoft.
739088	742309	Actually, well, I can't really blame it on Microsoft because we were using Piratey Cup.
743530	748672	Oh, no, no, he meant a pirate's treasure that we found.
749152	751773	A photocopy.
751833	753314	Yes, a photocopy.
753714	756955	So basically, we started to upgrade the computer around what, noon?
757035	758556	Thinking we'd have plenty of time to do it?
758996	763018	And how many times did we have to install different versions of Windows XP?
763939	765080	About six.
765680	769742	Because, see, Rob's computer is what we like to call in the industry, old.
770322	773343	And it did not like anything that you did to it.
773524	774564	It was very cranky.
774924	783568	And so I ended up having to take one of my older hard drives, a nice 40 gig Maxter hard drive, and put that in there and format it.
783748	784909	God knows what was on that.
785829	786890	I'm sick of apology music.
787692	803838	every battle so yeah we had to end up reinstalling a new hard drive before it would even take for some reason I don't know why so but we finally got it installed like after the show yeah it finally finally the system came up about
805013	805854	3 hours after the show
826107	828689	And we just took it off because... Yeah, you guys have to face this.
829410	832633	We have a national holiday dedicated to fire.
833194	837237	And we're going to be here doing a show for you all?
837538	839099	No, we're going to be out setting things on fire.
839199	840240	Illegal fireworks.
840280	842643	For last week, you do not have our apology.
842743	843503	You get fire.
843884	845145	Our leftover fire from last week.
845706	847086	This is smoke and ashes.
847206	849767	It was not our intention to be on two weeks in a row, so we apologize.
849867	850587	We know you've missed us.
854428	855228	That's the excuse.
855508	856188	That's what's going on.
856348	857468	I make no excuses.
858089	860229	I stand by my decisions, dammit.
860709	867690	I take full responsibility and accountability for what I did, unlike those who are coming up in the upcoming presidential elections.
869211	869871	Vote for me.
873506	874787	and Unstable Jelly.
874827	875968	Red vs. Blue owns you.
875988	876489	Go watch it.
878230	883194	Jamie likes to talk back to our chat room, so if you want to get Jamie's attention, you can... Say something stupid.
884415	886777	It's broadcast on the TV screen here in our studio.
887278	889940	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
889980	890821	All the good stuff's there.
891321	893883	There's all the chatting boys and girls in the chat room.
893903	896165	That's the only way you can participate in Cage Match.
896485	897166	By the way, my friends...
899881	905385	Someone brought up to me that there is a working Mac emulator now for a PC that I'm going to be getting for my computer.
906046	906446	Wait a minute.
906466	908708	You just said working and Mac in the same sentence.
909508	910449	I'm going to try it out.
912190	914512	I'm going to try it out just for curiosity.
914532	916694	I'm just giving our listeners a little hell.
918175	919496	This is going to be interesting news.
919576	924420	Now that I've apologized for being gone for the past two weeks, I have some interesting news to tell you all.
925961	928002	I'm not going to be here for the next two weeks.
928223	928583	Bye.
931962	934884	This show will be solely in the hands of DarkSakura and Loki.
937204	938125	Dear God save us all.
938165	939966	I fear for you all and my apologies.
941206	945608	If you want to pay my rent and my bills, then I will be here every week for you.
945808	954411	Otherwise, I need to remain my company's bitch and go to strange places they tell me to go to, which for the next two weeks will involve the East Coast.
955211	956612	Bring me back something Eastern.
957860	959200	I don't know if I should say where.
959340	960901	I don't want stalker fans to find me.
961221	964342	I'm not going to say exactly where, but I'll give a hint.
964622	965182	I'll give a hint.
971123	971563	Okay.
972504	974924	It's one letter off from California in the state of abbreviation.
974944	975664	That's way nerdy.
976285	980125	It's an hour away from where Queer as Folk is set.
981746	982346	There's a good hint.
984787	986387	So I won't be here for the next two weeks, so.
987443	991447	How many times are we going to do this show from my house?
992368	995471	As long as people don't decide to abandon me for Ron Jeremy like they did last time.
995491	997313	No, this time I'll be abandoned for Mame.
1010882	1011943	I'll do what I can.
1012363	1016605	If there's something I can do to help from millions of miles away, I will.
1016905	1022969	Actually, this is still all up in the air, because basically, I got told that I'm taking this trip Friday.
1023970	1025630	And I'll be leaving a week from today.
1026051	1030693	So everything's very last minute here, and I'm wondering if it'll actually happen.
1030733	1033555	So I may be here next week, but not bloody likely.
1033935	1035656	When the man tells you you go, you go.
1035796	1036717	So that's all you can do.
1038732	1042034	Why does it always have to be the man?
1042094	1044116	Why can't it be the woman to tell you to do something?
1044176	1046457	Well, because in this case it was a man that told me I'm going.
1047318	1050040	Well, fuck you.
1050821	1053763	My boss is a woman, but her boss is a man.
1055184	1056305	Okay, well then I retract that.
1056385	1058046	I heard some great woman jokes over the weekend.
1058086	1058666	You want to hear some?
1058827	1059567	Sure.
1060568	1061669	How do you fix a woman's watch?
1065612	1065932	What?
1066257	1067678	You don't need to, there's a clock on the oven.
1071879	1076381	I would throw this can at you, but I'm still drinking from it.
1077801	1079822	And this root beer I value more than that joke.
1079842	1083303	And also, you know, I wouldn't want the house getting dirty.
1087885	1088885	Anyway, moving right along.
1089878	1092380	Here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're equal opportunity offenders, by the way.
1093401	1097183	Moving right along, we usually start the show off with doing a little bit of How was your day?
1097263	1097884	How was your week?
1098024	1100986	But seeing as we've been gone for a little while, I think we're going to do some How was your day?
1101006	1101527	How was your month?
1102087	1104949	So, Jamie, how was your day?
1105029	1105510	How was your month?
1105830	1107051	My day was pretty good, actually.
1108912	1113856	I woke up at 8.30 in the morning after having gone to bed around 4 a.m.
1115057	1115177	And...
1117219	1120341	I decided that, well, today, Julie and I were going to go running.
1120561	1122963	So we went, and we left, you know, on time.
1123303	1126986	For the first time, Julie was on time getting to my house.
1128387	1132029	We got out, we got to ARC, and it was all roped off.
1132230	1134711	ARC, by the way, is American River College, for those people who don't know.
1135272	1138614	And so we're like, okay, so we'll go over to CSUS.
1139155	1140656	Forgot the Olympic trials were going on.
1140776	1141776	That's closed off, too.
1143277	1146700	Right here in Sacramento, we got the Olympians.
1147233	1150514	So I went to, we saw a limo there, I wanted to egg it, but anyway.
1152155	1160139	So we went to Sac City, forgetting that the track there was a stadium and all closed off because of whatever zoning law or whatever.
1160719	1162700	So we ended up running at Natomas High School.
1163640	1166261	Now Natomas High School is really nice.
1166882	1169723	It's a very new school, lots of amenities.
1170503	1172164	One would think the track would be paved.
1172791	1173692	No, it's not.
1174593	1185024	And with it being as hot as it was by the time we got there, like around noon, actually no it wasn't around noon, it was around 11, but it was still fairly hot outside.
1185064	1189990	There was wind blowing, the thing is that wind plus dirt equals dirt in your face.
1190933	1194554	So to clarify, you don't rely on DDR for your exercise.
1194574	1196895	You get out there on the track and run, on the dirt track.
1196915	1201076	Well, I'm trying to... I have to get where I can run two miles.
1201756	1202316	Oh, okay.
1202576	1219561	So right now, what the plan was is walk the first lap to warm up and then run-walk two more and then walk another and run-walk two more and walk another until I can get to where I can do the whole thing
1220351	1223333	Running the straight way, walking the curve, and keep doing it like that.
1223353	1227857	Because a friend of mine who ran track told me that that's how they trained.
1228417	1229758	So I was like, okay, I'll do that.
1230178	1232720	I actually made it a full mile doing the walk run.
1232880	1233581	I didn't stop.
1234802	1239766	And did my first lap walking and my last lap walking.
1239806	1242968	Actually, I did another half of that lap on a run.
1243068	1245149	So I made it pretty well.
1245370	1248512	I'm hoping that by the end of the month I can actually at least run a mile.
1250239	1253460	or at least run two laps without feeling like my heart wants to explode.
1254380	1255620	I can breathe just fine though.
1255840	1256320	No asthma.
1256400	1258481	That's another thing about my month.
1259681	1263522	Starting what happened, I think it was the week before Ren Faire.
1264783	1266443	I'm thinking it was either the one before or after.
1266463	1270744	I had a pulmonary exam done to see if I, to prove I didn't have asthma.
1271604	1272824	And I don't have asthma.
1273465	1278326	The way that one of the charts reads is that it has a scale of 1 to 10 and
1279795	1284336	When you take in your first breath, it goes up and then it pans off as you exhale.
1284997	1293679	And six, for the inhale part of that, is about mid-average lung capacity, and I hit an eight out of ten.
1294320	1301902	So I apparently have really awesome, fantastic lungs, and so I'm all good, and I don't have to keep the inhaler anymore.
1302022	1305383	All it took was just losing some weight, and so I've been good with that.
1306338	1308399	And, uh, the Ren Fair was really fun.
1308780	1313422	I was in the chat room, though, on that, for that show, because I was, like, just dead tired after the fair.
1313802	1315103	But they didn't have mead anywhere.
1315223	1315984	I was pissed off.
1316564	1317725	And my bodice was too big.
1318285	1321307	So I didn't have quite the, you know, lusty wench effect.
1321907	1326430	Although some guy asked me to pick up something off of the ground so that he could stare down my cleavage.
1326590	1328191	So, I took it as a compliment.
1328351	1328751	Right.
1328811	1329411	No, I didn't.
1330672	1331513	I told him to pay me.
1333294	1333714	He didn't.
1334522	1344009	There was this adorable little kid there who was in the ultimate... I can't think of the word now.
1344069	1345330	He was in sackcloth.
1345530	1346010	It was great.
1346991	1348632	Just running around in sackcloth the whole time.
1348652	1349913	He looked like he was having a good time.
1350093	1350814	Sackcloth?
1351674	1352035	Burlap.
1352415	1353596	Whatever.
1353776	1355657	I mean, but I'm trying to think of the actual term.
1355717	1356238	The peasant.
1356658	1357018	That was it.
1358699	1363563	And there was... Let's see what else.
1365513	1367414	Fourth of July was okay.
1367494	1368535	I was actually sick all day.
1368975	1370336	I was sick practically all the weekend.
1370396	1371236	Dope.
1371416	1382002	But I went to a barbecue at the home of some friends of mine and Dan who are Atkinsing.
1383063	1384844	So there was lots of meat everywhere.
1385444	1386565	Meat everywhere.
1387625	1389026	And no potato salad.
1389086	1391307	Although someone did bring potato salad, but I didn't touch it.
1392248	1392368	And...
1393365	1396146	They had sparklers there, but they had the old ones that are metal.
1397366	1398066	So those were fun.
1398306	1399026	Cool!
1399126	1400807	You can't ever find those kind anymore.
1401227	1403347	I was setting them on fire the whole night.
1404828	1406628	I was just all happy because I had fire.
1407588	1421712	And I've been training somebody at work, and I basically told that I'm going to be sort of like, I guess, like the mentor from now on for a lot of people, for the new hires who come in.
1421752	1422912	So I was like,
1423553	1428257	I don't know what to think about that because I like doing it.
1428437	1433400	I like passing on what I know and I like the teaching aspect.
1433440	1436623	But sometimes I want my cubicle to myself.
1436743	1437924	That's like my space.
1439185	1440185	It's your domain.
1440266	1441947	You want to be the master of your domain.
1443868	1446070	But other than that, it's really cool.
1446110	1447531	It's just been an interesting week.
1448532	1449412	I missed my brother.
1449592	1452895	My brother was in Alabama on the fourth weekend.
1454651	1459394	and I wanted to have the money to go see him, but I'm like flat broke right now.
1460894	1461675	Oh, what else I did?
1462295	1463156	I enrolled in school.
1463956	1464396	Congrats.
1464536	1465637	I'm going back to college.
1465797	1467598	I'm going into database management.
1468859	1475162	And so I need a laptop so that I can do my homework wherever I happen to be because half my classes are online.
1475683	1479385	I decided to get a class that I'm not looking forward to out of the way, like right off the bat.
1479885	1481726	I'm taking business law.
1483502	1485524	and I'm just going to take that one in the classroom.
1485724	1486145	I don't care.
1486205	1486865	I want it out of the way.
1488106	1495914	But they're making me take all of the stupid prerequisites that I could test out of if I was able to miss work for it.
1496955	1500678	But I figure it's going to be an easy A and a good buffer against that business law class.
1500698	1508766	So I'm having to take like Intro to Windows and beginning word processing and beginning Excel and next semester I'm taking like Access.
1510706	1514588	It's probably going to be around summer when I'm going to have to start taking the crappy programming classes.
1517029	1522111	So that also is going to affect when Pump Up the Volume is.
1522531	1525893	Because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.
1526873	1529374	I get out of class like at 6.45.
1530975	1540119	But because it's also going to break into my gym time on Wednesdays, I'm thinking about moving the show to another night in the week
1540997	1543719	or maybe do two shows late night.
1545180	1552386	Because Monday, I figure if I move the show, then I'll start running on Monday and Wednesday and do spin on Friday.
1552526	1553967	You can always have Tuesday back if you want.
1554447	1555869	Okay, that should be easiest.
1555969	1557290	Yeah, I'll just give you Tuesday back.
1557490	1559131	And we can use the old promo again!
1559171	1559812	Yay!
1559832	1560152	Okay.
1563044	1563745	That does work out.
1563845	1564806	You let me know when you want to do that.
1565406	1566647	I'm going to be gone for two weeks.
1566908	1571752	And then after I get back from my little work trip, I should have an announcement on what's going to happen with Vanilla Sky.
1571812	1574094	Why don't I just start it this week?
1574574	1575395	Yeah, we'll figure something out.
1575415	1575715	That's fine.
1575796	1576616	I'll start doing it on Tuesdays.
1576736	1577177	Yeah, okay.
1577357	1578298	We can shuffle it around.
1578358	1580260	I'll do it two nights in a row.
1580280	1580740	I don't care.
1580940	1581140	Sure.
1582041	1582482	Yeah, okay.
1583623	1585304	I'll just go live all week.
1585484	1586065	Fun.
1586245	1587586	All right, yeah, the Jamie experience.
1587606	1588427	We'll figure it out.
1589312	1590633	Everyone's going to get so sick of me.
1590814	1594097	We'll make an official announcement on the website when we figure out the scheduling stuff.
1594477	1596379	Oh, and the last bit of news.
1597180	1598882	I have meat, and meat makes me happy.
1601024	1601765	Congratulations.
1603506	1603907	Okay, I'm done.
1604307	1604607	All done?
1604627	1605288	Yeah.
1605308	1605508	All right.
1606489	1607951	Loki, do you have anything you want to share?
1607991	1608591	How was your week?
1608912	1609692	I'm sorry, how was your month?
1609713	1610113	How was your day?
1613427	1614848	I played Final Fantasy.
1615148	1616229	I burned things.
1616889	1619631	I got my hard drive loader working.
1619691	1620812	I played Driver 3.
1627096	1629137	I forgot to mention something, so I'm going to have Rob mention it for me.
1630238	1630418	Okay.
1631319	1633420	Anyways, I saw Spider-Man 2.
1634401	1638123	I saw Fahrenheit 9-11 twice.
1639224	1639804	I saw...
1642455	1643296	I don't know, some other movie.
1644397	1647739	I don't know, not much that really happened.
1648260	1649301	What do I say every week?
1649381	1650582	Nothing happened during the week.
1650942	1652943	Multiply that times four, that was my month.
1654725	1657207	Or, you know, two weeks, half a month, I guess.
1657567	1662811	No, your week was playing Final Fantasy XI all night.
1663552	1672059	Anyways, my fiancee Nellie, who's been on the show a few times, she got a job at my work doing Mailer Room, and she loves it.
1672789	1700907	and, um, I'm trying to think what else I did, oh, today I put together the PC that's going to go in the cabinet that's been sitting here for months, not just collecting dust, so it will be functional soon, so possibly the webcam will come back, hooray, and then, um, what else, um, and there's other things, but I'll mention them later, I'm sure, yeah.
1701908	1703169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1722069	1723590	I thought I was going to die or something.
1723630	1728511	I mean, seriously, I don't know if you've ever had hiccups, but usually they last, what, like a half hour at the most?
1728831	1732912	I had it on and off for like 90 minute intervals for three days.
1733393	1734133	It was horrid.
1734833	1738954	So I finally had to go to the doctor, and I swear to God, my doctor was going to laugh at me.
1739174	1740815	Like, you got the hiccups?
1741889	1743270	You coming in here because you got hiccups?
1743631	1744852	Like, it's been three days!
1744932	1745753	It's not normal!
1746293	1747394	I've got brain cancer!
1747414	1748896	Because I went on to WebMD.com.
1748936	1755682	I swear to God, if you go on WebMD, and you type in, like, hiccups, like, reoccurring, it'll tell you, like, oh, you might have brain cancer.
1755702	1756583	You better go get checked out.
1756703	1757664	It's not a tumor.
1758584	1759766	So, I went to the doctor.
1759806	1761807	I'm like, doctor, I think I have brain cancer.
1761928	1762148	Why?
1762168	1763009	Because I have hiccups.
1765511	1767393	So, um...
1769725	1771226	Oh, God, what else happened besides that?
1771306	1772606	Oh, yeah, my birthday happened.
1772827	1773847	God, that was wild now.
1774587	1775688	Happy birthday, Rob!
1775708	1776188	Thank you.
1776208	1778549	Some of my friends threw me a surprise party, which was really cute.
1779629	1783010	And my cake said, Happy Birthday, Dr. Dick, which was really cute.
1783051	1784031	Yes, and I got this.
1784411	1786032	I got the answer to the ferret here.
1786532	1787752	I got this new little toy here.
1787792	1788593	What's this guy's name?
1788733	1789273	Does he have a name?
1790313	1794275	It's Trash Talkers, and this guy's name... Marshall!
1794635	1795695	I left your present at home.
1795936	1796936	And Marshall... Oh, that's all good.
1797600	1804343	Marshall is this guy, and he's wearing a lavender shirt and lavender pants with a little rainbow flag on it, and let's see some of the things that Marshall has to say.
1807624	1807985	Ah, shit.
1808025	1809665	You have to whack him in the head to get him to say something.
1810806	1811866	You can barely hear it.
1811926	1817128	I don't think our listeners can hear it at all.
1817148	1817689	That's great.
1827850	1829173	So that's my answer to the ferret.
1829213	1832780	So whenever you start up with a ferret... Oh, there, I think his speaker's in the front here.
1836688	1837309	Alright, anyway.
1841345	1843586	So, uh, what else?
1844006	1846187	I don't think I've played a single game of DDR.
1846947	1848008	No, I take that back.
1848148	1850469	I actually, I was hanging out with Navi, our poppin' music whore.
1851029	1855631	I was hanging out with him on Friday, and I beat a 31 on poppin' music.
1855651	1856411	That made me so happy.
1856471	1857851	Like, on the arcade controller.
1858312	1859392	So, I was all jazzed.
1859852	1861613	I know some of you out there are better, but don't hate!
1862629	1863209	I'm getting better.
1863589	1866910	But we actually played DDR, like on an ignition pad and everything.
1866950	1868451	We were playing DDR Extreme at home.
1869071	1872272	And it was so great because I was still doing really well.
1872752	1874493	And I also got DDR for my Xbox.
1874553	1878574	Those of you that were listening to episode 101 heard the confession that I bought an Xbox.
1879254	1882756	And I've been playing DDR on live a little bit.
1882876	1889838	And I've got to say, it's very interesting to play DDR on Xbox Live because people can talk on the microphones and stuff.
1890538	1892439	You need to play Phantasy Star with me.
1903720	1904821	That's extra money.
1905042	1905662	That's more money.
1905822	1906844	You know how many MMORPGs I'm playing?
1906864	1907544	PSO is cheap.
1908646	1909266	PSO is $9.
1909627	1910268	We'll see.
1910288	1910608	We'll see.
1910908	1912090	Yeah, okay, so then I'd be on PSO.
1912110	1913231	And then they forget to charge you.
1913691	1914512	I'd be on PSO.
1914833	1917916	Then I'd be on Ragnarok, because Jamie found this free server.
1918317	1919238	No, I didn't find it.
1919278	1920039	Marenchan found it.
1920059	1920359	Oh, sorry.
1920399	1923523	Marenchan found this free server that we've all been playing Ragnarok on now.
1923583	1923963	The 60th.
1926232	1932784	With the 60 times experience and 30 times drops?
1932804	1934027	Yeah, something like that.
1934047	1934548	It's crazy.
1936010	1936091	Um...
1937307	1940570	So we've got that, the free Ragnarok server.
1940610	1944834	And now, okay, Final Fantasy XI, when I reinstalled everything for the computer, it broke.
1944934	1951261	It was fucked up, my graphics were flickering, it was screwed up beyond belief, and I was never going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI again.
1951861	1954023	Last night, it finally got fixed.
1954404	1959949	Finally got fixed last night because the way to fix it, I had to install some drivers that are two years old for my card.
1960309	1961010	And now it works.
1961711	1961851	So...
1963497	1991692	now I'm back on there so that would be three MMORPGs I'm wasting my time with I bitch enough about how I don't have enough time to play like real console games like I've been trying to play Mega Man Collection barely have any time I finally have sat down with Silent Hill 2 and I'm only about halfway through that because I'm so I have video game ADD is basically what it boils down to I sit down this is especially bad when I have emulation I play a game for like literally like 10 seconds and then I'm done with it and I want to do another game so yes Jamie
1992008	1994629	I just want to answer Angel's question real quick.
1995530	2010637	If you go onto, and this is sort of, I'm not meaning to plug my own stuff here, but if you go to roleplay.darksakura.com, look in the Ragnarok online folder, you'll see an announcement there posted regarding playing the free Ragnarok server.
2012098	2012318	Anyway.
2017216	2022100	Yeah, so that was pretty much my week and my day, or my month and my day, really.
2023601	2026463	Did you play any Bomani at all through this whole month, Jamie?
2026623	2029645	I did, and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was.
2030606	2039152	I played some pop and music when we had the first Dorama night, and I played DDR!
2039712	2040092	Did ya?
2041093	2041573	Amazing.
2041614	2042594	Tamarik was in town.
2043295	2043535	Mm-hmm.
2044704	2047886	and we went to Fry's and I played TDR in Fry's.
2048766	2049067	Awesome.
2051628	2062936	I also bought, because it just came out a couple weeks ago, I bought the You Got Served Taken to the Streets DVD, which is the instructional videos on how to do all the choreography and I thought that was sweet.
2062976	2063256	Funny.
2063596	2064417	Haven't watched it yet, but
2065123	2071228	I like the, uh, I actually bought, I was also probably one of the only people on the face of the earth that bought Darren's Dance Grooves.
2071268	2072609	I have that DVD also.
2073169	2078894	Just in case if I ever won these days aside, you know, I feel like getting in shape and doing freestyle.
2079234	2081396	Just in case if that dark day ever comes.
2082577	2083097	I'll be ready.
2085859	2086239	Okay.
2087847	2094352	Alright, I think we're going to take a break, and then we're going to come back and we're going to do some real Babani news.
2094392	2098856	Because we missed a lot of news stories while we were gone, our little bit of downtime.
2098896	2099957	So we're going to talk about some of that.
2101218	2104720	So we're going to take a break, and Jamie requested a Gradius break.
2105041	2105801	So we're going to do that.
2106362	2107443	That makes me go squeak.
2107543	2109024	So what is a Gradius break, Jamie?
2109444	2112787	Well, I guess it's not just Gradius, but it's all of the...
2113402	2115563	Games featuring the Vic Viper, I guess.
2116263	2121145	Sensation is from the second stage of Life Force, Salamander 2.
2123726	2127007	And Burning Heat was, of course, the first stage of Gradius 2.
2127947	2132349	And then the Gradius full option mix, which was all the music from the first Gradius.
2132648	2139254	Alright, so we're going to do these songs, and then we'll do some chat rooms requests and some pop-in music, so we'll do that in a later break.
2140515	2143238	Okay, some actual Bomani news when we come back.
2144119	2144559	We'll be back!
2144579	2144559	... ...
2218661	2219643	Thanks for watching!
2362185	2363992	Thanks for watching!
2467412	2468273	Thanks for watching!
2489537	2492722	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
2492982	2495145	No!
2495285	2495946	Just kidding.
2496387	2499110	Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bavani Radio.
2501894	2505779	We are back live, Orange Lounge Radio, episode 102 in progress.
2506977	2512878	Some folks out there are telling me there might be a little bit of skipping going on with some of the stuff we're playing.
2514098	2516499	We're using a new encoder program tonight.
2516539	2521380	It's actually not new, it's the one we used to use like a long time ago between episodes like 1 and 60.
2522460	2525041	But they updated it so it does the MP3 Pro thing now.
2525341	2530982	If you guys don't hear us in stereo, all you gotta do is download the MP3 Pro codec and you'll hear us in stereo.
2531442	2535903	But I guess maybe it's causing things to skip a little bit if I do too much in the background, so...
2537439	2564929	it's not everyone that's getting it though yeah I don't know weird we'll see we'll see yeah we'll see I don't know yeah I know my computer is like now it's a 3.2 gigahertz machine now I would think it has enough you know juice in there to handle everything and not make things skip but I don't know technology amazes me some days I don't know we'll see I can always try the new video card I think it has to do with I have too much video going on we'll see we'll see
2565939	2567919	We are back, Orange Lounge Radio.
2569200	2574161	I wanted to talk about some stuff that's been going on in the Bomani news scene while we've been gone for the past three weeks.
2575341	2580362	First off, this story kind of came out not too long after we had our last show.
2581722	2586003	You probably all heard about this, but we haven't had a chance to make fun of it yet, so I'm bringing it up again.
2587104	2593065	This girl, I'm sure you've heard, but she had a heart attack or something like that while playing DDR.
2594844	2595845	Now, that's the short story.
2595905	2604012	Now, really what it is, is that that's kind of what the media says in all these headlines, is that, oh my god, girl almost died playing DDR.
2604293	2606034	DDR kills teen.
2606354	2609277	Did they bring up that it was a pre-existing condition?
2609357	2610198	Of course not.
2611124	2612064	But here's the headline.
2612425	2615006	Heart condition strikes girl down at arcade.
2615226	2616427	Now see, that's not so bad.
2616807	2624631	But then if you go on to like GameSpot or something, GameSpot's headline was something like, girl gets heart problem while playing DDR or something like that.
2624691	2628533	It's kind of like, it sort of infers that DDR caused the problem.
2628773	2630514	DDR did not cause the problem.
2632565	2635727	If she had been out running, the same damn thing would have happened.
2636228	2639610	If she had been rollerblading, the same thing would have happened.
2639630	2642231	If she had been masturbating, the same thing would have happened.
2642251	2643532	I have heard of that, okay?
2647194	2648395	How's that for a climax?
2650136	2651017	It's heart-stopping.
2651037	2655519	Oh my God, I'm dead.
2655920	2656220	Damn it.
2656820	2657100	Damn it.
2657841	2658842	I just came in my eye.
2659282	2659402	Okay.
2659462	2659542	Okay.
2663611	2663931	Yeah.
2664972	2668375	The thing is, is that the media... If she had been eating a donut, that would have happened.
2668395	2672398	All I could hear in the bathroom was masturbating in the crowd-making stream.
2672418	2674280	It's alright, it's alright.
2674360	2684209	Let's listen to this lovely news story brought to us by TheOmahaChannel.com And hopefully you guys don't get a lot of skipping, but let's hear what happened to our friend here in Omaha.
2687652	2687952	We'll just...
2689337	2701866	The sign outside the Bellevue Arcade has been up for nearly one week.
2702266	2703667	Get well soon, Kimber.
2703827	2704908	Ooh, yeah.
2704988	2706829	A 15-year-old is doing just that.
2707329	2709131	I don't remember too much.
2709911	2710411	Yes, Loki.
2710812	2712653	She's all, ooh, yeah, donut.
2713894	2714474	Stop it.
2715115	2715635	Stop it.
2716776	2718677	You are very rude, Mr. Loki.
2720757	2721438	Alright, moving on.
2721758	2724840	Is that a midget playing DDR on the right side?
2724960	2726421	It looks like a midget.
2726461	2727242	That's Tyler Durden.
2727262	2728443	She then fell to the floor.
2745151	2747613	Okay, well see, she was playing I Do, I Do, I Do.
2747713	2748454	That's what happened.
2749214	2753498	She heard that song and she was like, Ah, Christ, this song sucks!
2753818	2754499	I'm gonna die.
2757501	2758942	We're being really horrible, you guys.
2758982	2761945	Okay, we're not trying to be mean, but we accomplished... What?
2762005	2762185	Yes.
2762865	2764447	She played this song, Broken My Heart.
2766148	2766909	That joke...
2767848	2768949	Oh, give me a break.
2769029	2770991	That joke is so used.
2771591	2775555	That was like the first freaking thing you heard on every message board.
2776015	2777497	First thing on every message board.
2781700	2784563	Oh, God, what a crappy song.
2784583	2788026	I do, I do, I do.
2788046	2789807	I don't, I don't, I don't.
2790168	2790548	Let's see.
2790768	2791709	Let's continue with the news story here.
2792319	2804624	Now how many times do you get to hear the word defibrillator in the news, huh?
2805844	2806985	That's such an awesome word.
2807265	2808065	Defibrillator.
2808345	2811626	I challenge all of our listeners to use the word defibrillator in a sentence today.
2812687	2814928	Why don't you shove a defibrillator up your ass?
2817989	2821330	Because, keep in mind that the media is typically too tight-ass to...
2823427	2823947	Oh, sorry.
2824288	2824648	Nothing.
2824868	2825168	Okay.
2825569	2827490	Hypertrophy cardiomyopathy.
2828091	2829592	Yeah, I'll say that three times fast.
2831073	2835496	Hydro, wait, let's see if it, hydrotrophy cardiomyopathy.
2836277	2837177	I totally fucked that up.
2837618	2838719	I know, it totally sounds made up.
2838739	2839499	It has to do with water.
2839559	2840340	This is real.
2840760	2841581	This is a real infection.
2841641	2843662	You could have this and you could get this.
2844063	2847085	No, he probably doesn't have it and you probably can't catch it.
2848146	2848526	Moving on.
2849400	2853623	The walls around her heart are so thick, her heart wasn't getting the signals to beat.
2853983	2860727	You could be asleep, you could be walking, running, sitting down to eat, and it can hit you.
2862588	2864109	Sitting down to eat, and it could hit you.
2867371	2871133	You know, it could have been that she's like, Mongo need food!
2871153	2875116	A translation for Spaceboy, who I guess is one of our new listeners.
2875858	2878101	It's the paddle thing that they put on you to clear.
2878141	2880023	The question is, what is a defibrillator?
2881305	2884007	Yes, if you ever watch ER or something and you hear them go, clear!
2884028	2888953	And then they put those paddles on somebody and then the body bounces, that's a defibrillator.
2888973	2891996	I want to see someone that doesn't clear when that happens.
2892116	2894539	I want them to be like, you're going to be okay!
2894599	2895700	And just get thrown back.
2895841	2896541	That'd be great.
2897582	2907871	Defibulator has always been comedy gold in movies like Naked Gun and stuff like that.
2907931	2909592	So, anyway, moving on.
2909612	2911634	I would just like to point something out there, though.
2911654	2913295	The mother says, what's so damn funny, Jamie?
2927825	2929126	Ah ha ha, that's funny.
2929947	2935813	The mother says, in this story, the mother says she was at the right place with all the people needed around there to help her.
2936914	2939116	DDR almost kills a teen.
2939376	2944020	It murdered a teenager because she was playing a bad song and her heart just stopped.
2944300	2945722	DDR is bad for people.
2945762	2950626	Yet the mother says she was in the right place at the right time with all the right people around her.
2952608	2953449	DDR kills!
2956772	2961015	Truth is, they don't really want their daughter, and they were hoping that she would die so they can collect the insurance.
2961035	2961775	That is mean.
2961895	2962635	That is just mean.
2962655	2963876	First off, first off.
2963956	2964437	Rude.
2964697	2965337	So rude.
2965377	2966037	How old was she?
2966458	2966958	Fifteen.
2967698	2974843	First and foremost, her parents should have been doing their goddamn job, okay?
2975243	2976964	They knew she had a heart condition, right?
2977384	2978305	No, I don't think they did.
2978625	2978905	Really?
2979425	2980326	I don't think so.
2982452	2983212	They don't say.
2983272	2984492	You know, interestingly enough, they don't say.
2984793	2987473	I heard that it was a known pre-existing condition.
2988193	2991174	Well, you know, people are going to say things in this situation.
2993595	2998056	My question is... You don't catch heart disease from playing DDR.
2998556	3001376	It's because there's something wrong with you, okay?
3002557	3004137	You have a condition.
3005858	3006898	I am almost positive.
3006918	3011939	To be honest, I'm almost positive they did not know beforehand because of the next part of this little article.
3017639	3028285	So, she's now on medication and she now has a pacemaker.
3028325	3031527	I'm assuming if they knew about the condition before, they would have given her the pacemaker before.
3032067	3036770	The thing is that that's still not something that playing a game of DDR is going to cause.
3037030	3038811	And who is the maker of this pacemaker?
3039071	3039612	Konami.
3039872	3041333	I smell conspiracy.
3042836	3046779	How do you know it's Black Ops Konami?
3050442	3065733	Well they make casino games and a lot of people didn't know that, I mean... They make pachinko machines, they could very well make pacemakers.
3066354	3069356	Yes, this girl will be playing Para Para Paradise for the rest of her life.
3070877	3071578	God help everybody.
3073337	3074698	Yes, she'll be switching to Pump It Up.
3074758	3076299	She'll be switching to Technomotion.
3078340	3084244	Timber and her parents wanted to thank all of the people who helped to revive her, including the arcade owners, the police officer, and the paramedics.
3084644	3087226	All of those rescuers have been checking up on her in the hospital.
3087546	3089387	Patricia, the heart problem is genetic?
3089427	3090188	That's what we're told.
3090248	3092549	In fact, her mother got checked and has a mild form of it.
3092809	3094490	And the rest of the family is getting checked out, too.
3094550	3097132	A simple echocardiogram can usually detect the disease.
3097654	3098174	Interesting.
3098254	3101315	So it sounds like they didn't know about it because the mom's getting checked now.
3101335	3102156	They're all getting checked.
3102376	3105197	They're having this electrocardiogram to figure out who's got the heart condition.
3105777	3107458	But see, that shows right there.
3107698	3116341	That right there is proof that the doctors themselves don't think DDR did it, which of course they're going to be smarter than them, and checking it as a genetic condition.
3117322	3123024	What would happen if this story was girl gets heart attack from playing Grand Theft Auto?
3123924	3124825	That would be great.
3125125	3125445	I mean...
3127155	3129116	The bullets were so real, it struck my heart.
3132137	3133197	Alright, thanks for sharing.
3133998	3135178	Alright, that's the end of the story.
3137179	3140200	I'm really... What if that poor girl's listening to us?
3140240	3143761	What if that poor girl's an Orange Lounge Radio fan, and here we are making fun of her plight?
3143781	3145682	We're not making fun of her plight.
3145942	3148763	We're making fun of the stupid people who don't understand it.
3148903	3149224	Alright.
3152285	3155546	Just remember that Loki's an equal opportunity offender, and we love everybody equally.
3157843	3159704	I'm so glad that the microphone can't pick Loki up right now.
3159884	3160565	I am so glad.
3160605	3160905	All right.
3160945	3161825	I guess that's that for that story.
3161845	3163706	Anything else you want to say about the girl with the heart thing?
3188752	3204830	Please, people, if you think, if your heart kind of tingles sometimes, or you think your heart might, there's something non-normal about your heart, like you feel it, like, you know, tingling a lot, and you suddenly can't feel your arm someday, tingle, not tinkle.
3205431	3208014	If your heart tingles, you've got a whole nother problem, okay?
3208576	3217238	If your heart's tingling a little bit or your hand hurts or you find that you're losing feeling in your leg when you're playing DDR, please go see a doctor.
3217579	3223620	If I can go to my doctor because I think I have the hiccups for too long, you can go to your doctor because you might have a heart condition.
3223700	3228542	Get that little electrocardiogram and please keep DDR out of the news for this kind of crap.
3230062	3233503	If the rest of your body is thick, then your heart's probably going to be thick too.
3237441	3241224	My head is just large, as Bug said, unlike Loki's head.
3245108	3256258	One day, Loki, you are going to get smited down from the heavens above with some horrible, horrific story, and everybody you've ever made fun of in the past is going to be there to make fun of you.
3257299	3258300	Woo!
3259061	3259961	Oh my god!
3260962	3262083	Oh wait, that's ironic.
3264164	3266725	No, I keep telling people I'm going to die an ironic death.
3266805	3267325	It'll be funny.
3267345	3267705	Don't worry.
3269265	3271366	I just want to... Or drown on an airplane or something.
3271386	3272186	This is my disclaimer.
3272586	3281309	That for everybody who thinks that DDR was... You know, her playing DDR contributed to an aggravation of that condition.
3281789	3286630	But for anyone who thinks that DDR caused the condition, I'm laughing at you and pointing my finger.
3286810	3287550	But it did.
3287751	3289251	It's devil, devil revolution.
3292116	3293617	I hit Rob instead.
3295778	3301081	You guys are so insensitive.
3301882	3306705	We should call ourselves Orange Lounge Insensitive Radio because that's what we are, you guys.
3308006	3311188	Don't play DDR if you are 500 pounds and can't feel your arm.
3312048	3313329	No, play DDR.
3313749	3314249	Please.
3315270	3316251	Yes, Loki.
3316491	3318472	If you throw your arm, that's just going to be disturbing.
3325273	3326954	I really don't know where to take the show from here.
3327355	3327695	What?
3328996	3332838	Did her falling down and having a heart attack cause vibrations that disturbed the neighbors?
3333259	3334700	Just stop it.
3334900	3335340	Just stop.
3335360	3336161	Was she really overweight?
3336301	3336541	Yes.
3337042	3337682	Well, I don't know.
3341845	3342565	She looked healthy.
3343546	3344787	Did she pass her song?
3347289	3348550	Did she perfect attack it?
3349030	3351032	Did she pass her song?
3352112	3353193	God damn!
3353473	3354294	How many misses?
3358854	3363656	She was a shape that a lot of people are, okay?
3363756	3367777	She's just... No, I wouldn't say that.
3367817	3371979	She didn't look to the point where it was morbid, okay?
3372059	3373800	She just looked healthy.
3374520	3378321	Like, you know, she just... God.
3380082	3381362	I'm going to get letters from this.
3383303	3384423	We never do get hate mail.
3384764	3385124	Yeah, I know.
3385204	3385744	Moving on.
3387435	3388876	Our chatroom's going, moving on!
3389856	3390817	I agree, moving on.
3391937	3393978	This week we get a brand new Bomani game.
3394498	3402942	I know we haven't talked about it a whole lot on this show, but Karaoke Revolution 2 is still slated to come out July 13th.
3403222	3405683	So, Jamie, there's something you can do while I'm gone.
3407304	3410065	Not just no, but hell no, I don't think.
3411145	3412866	I was in band for a reason.
3415904	3438000	If you look at the box art, it's interesting because it's red instead of blue, and it's got all new songs in it, some new modes, we've talked about it enough before on this show, but it is coming out relatively soon, hopefully you got your pre-orders in, if you didn't, well, you're not supporting Konami, and we won't have any more DDR ever again, thanks to you.
3443038	3443819	Moving on.
3444599	3448002	Also, so we know Karaoke Revolution 2 is coming out.
3448022	3449824	We still have Xtreme on the way.
3450244	3452346	We still have DDR Ultimix 2 on the way.
3452386	3453707	But what's going on in Japan?
3454208	3455469	We haven't heard a whole lot about what's going on.
3455489	3456850	Beautiful, blissful news.
3456910	3458552	Yes, beautiful, blissful news from Japan.
3458592	3460814	We haven't heard a whole lot.
3460834	3461294	Shut up.
3461755	3462835	Quite the opposite, Loki.
3463176	3466999	We did get an announcement that 8th Style is, in fact, on the way.
3467019	3469101	8th Style will be coming to the home soon.
3470616	3489380	more guitar freaks also I thought more guitar freaks would make me happy but it's not going to happen I thought that because it did so well they were going to look into their other games if they do, sign me up because I need more guitar dota at home
3492438	3495561	Yes, so basically their website says something to this effect.
3495821	3500646	Because 7th Style did better than they thought it would do, they're going to go ahead and make an 8th Style.
3501086	3505691	And thank you to all of you that helped make Konami Style a purchase to continue supporting the project.
3506452	3513959	Details will be on the 2DX website, official website, konamistyle.com, and in the Konami Style newsletter.
3513999	3514880	You just have to wait.
3515721	3515921	Keep
3516531	3520073	on helping them out and continuing the production of Beatmania 2DX sequels.
3520474	3524356	So it sounds like they might keep going, even after 8th style, if 8th style does well.
3524656	3527798	The question is, are we going to have to do any petitions this time?
3527818	3531460	Are we going to have to do any, you know... God, I hope not.
3531480	3532081	That was stupid.
3532401	3537944	You remember I went off on Konami style on this show previously for having to make us do all those stupid questionnaires and everything.
3538305	3539846	Either make the game, or don't.
3541987	3543108	Quit making us have to work.
3543248	3544669	You're the ones making money off it.
3544709	3545269	You do the work.
3546067	3547508	We're not going to fill out no damn petition.
3548769	3549130	Jeez.
3550991	3551251	All right.
3551431	3552552	The 7th style is pretty.
3554094	3556255	You know what's funny is I still never did buy 7th style.
3556275	3561139	I said I would buy 7th style, but because my controller kind of sucks, I haven't bothered with 7th style.
3561580	3563481	And now I'm like, I'm all about poppin' music now.
3563521	3565383	I'm like, I need to get a poppin' music arcade style.
3567625	3568045	We'll see.
3569466	3570087	We'll see what happens.
3573442	3576285	So hopefully 8th style does well too and then we'll see a 9th style in the future.
3576365	3578627	But let's take it one step at a time, boys and girls.
3579888	3583651	So hopefully we will see 8th style at the end of the year.
3584732	3588856	But nothing confirmed yet.
3590157	3591738	Alright, let's see.
3591838	3592899	Do we want to do the cage match?
3593079	3594621	Actually, let's go to a break.
3595061	3598424	Because there's still more news stories I want to talk about before we come back.
3600461	3605042	In this break, I guess since we heard about 8Style, we'll play something from 2DX8Style.
3607762	3608622	We'll play this song.
3608702	3609383	I like this one.
3609463	3612703	And then we had a request for some poppin' music, so we'll work that in there too.
3613463	3614664	Some random poppin' music song.
3615164	3619564	And when we come back, some more news and all your favorite stuff.
3619704	3625885	Orange Lounge Radio, Cage Match on the way, FU's on the way, and more exciting news.
3626226	3626426	Yes.
3627946	3628406	Yes, Jamie, yes.
3628426	3628586	Yes.
3630030	3630253	Yes!
3630375	3631003	Alright, we'll be back.
3736308	3737450	Thanks for watching!
3753698	3767261	Kamaba Chikyuu Yo Midatsu Fune Wa Uchuru Sentai Yamato Uchuu no Kanatai Kandaru Unmei Seoi Ima Tobikaze Kananatsu Tokoe
3780552	3783533	Thank you for watching.
3783553	3784574	See you next time.
3808195	3809476	Thank you for watching!
3833332	3835653	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3876218	3877879	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3934793	3936374	Thank you for watching.
3936414	3937514	See you next time.
3979067	3982448	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio and I just spilled Propel all over.
3982548	3985549	Now the cords tangle in my chair and everything is breaking.
3985569	3986109	Poor Rob.
3986229	3988169	Well, I'll take this moment to answer John Field then.
3988669	3989130	Sure.
3989270	3996311	I want the song from End of Ava because I've been looking for it forever and my single was sort of stepped on by somebody.
3997609	3997809	Ouch.
4001534	4001835	Alright.
4003257	4014271	Since some of you guys didn't seem to know those songs in the break... Uh, the songs in that break, uh, from 2DX8style, Love is Orange...
4015014	4031038	by Orange Lounge, Yamato, Space Warship Yamato by Sosasaki from Poppin' Music 7, and then in Poppin' Music 7 as well, we played a song by a group called Komotomoke, the genre is lonely, and the song, Artemis.
4031978	4038500	So I know a lot of you guys may not be as familiar with the Poppin' Music songs, so we'll play a few more for you guys tonight, just because we can.
4040146	4040526	Uh, you are back.
4040546	4043868	Maybe you can pick up that soundtrack they have, though, of the Anamelo 1 and 2.
4044628	4044908	Oh, yeah?
4045788	4046869	I came really close to it.
4046889	4047549	It's really awesome.
4049090	4049390	Cool.
4050670	4050950	Alright.
4051951	4054432	We were talking about some Mamani news before we went to the break.
4054452	4056833	We were talking about the girl who had the heart attack playing DDR.
4056873	4059294	Even though that was, well, she wasn't really a heart attack, whatever it was.
4060594	4061414	That was a couple weeks ago.
4061454	4064195	But as you may or may not know, we've been off the air for about three weeks.
4065696	4067917	Because of problems out of our control, but we're back.
4068848	4073811	You know, real shows go off the air for like two months and you still watch them.
4074932	4078094	So, I don't think a two week break is too much to ask, people.
4079655	4084298	Anyway, I thought this was interesting and I know Loki wants to talk about this.
4084338	4086580	You found something interesting on eBay this week, didn't you?
4088821	4089742	Yes, we have.
4090422	4092063	It's just been hitting the streets now.
4093319	4103964	Apparently the same people behind the wonderful bootleg DDR Megamix are back at it again with... For those who don't know what DDR Megamix is... My bad!
4105125	4105665	God!
4105685	4108007	I'm just thinking I forget these things.
4108527	4118572	Now DDR Megamix is this really shitty bootleg that came out that basically was supposed to have the songs from 4th, 5th, and Extreme all in one cabinet, which would be pretty cool.
4119184	4129032	But no, all it was was DDR Extreme with really shitty graphics and glitched out shit and the wonderful warning screen don't fall off with two giant Star Wars AT-STs on there.
4129532	4131874	So, um, that was really lame.
4131974	4140741	So this new one now has come out and is being distributed by some guy on the internet and it's also the same guy that is behind Megamix, as I said before.
4141342	4144264	Now, what's new about this is, one, there's actual graphics.
4144324	4146646	It's not, like, fucked up graphics as before.
4147428	4150770	There's actual new graphics, which is stupid, who cares?
4151851	4157694	And the ability to speed up the tempo of a song up to 20%, which is pretty lame.
4159255	4161876	So it's Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus.
4163597	4166539	With, yeah, just really shitty stuff.
4166699	4167379	And they're selling it for $650.
4167799	4171021	And there's the link in the chatroom.
4173069	4173889	I love this ad.
4174150	4175710	I just posted the link in the chat room there.
4176511	4180973	It has this running theme going through the game, and that is like torso shots.
4181913	4182373	And look at this.
4182413	4187576	The logo, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus, is just the shot of a boob, basically.
4187596	4189577	That's the logo.
4189617	4190057	Look at that.
4190557	4191398	It's just a boob.
4192138	4192979	That's the marquee.
4193039	4193639	It's a boob.
4195569	4198310	And then, um, oh, sorry, it's a breast.
4199911	4200711	It's a breast.
4201411	4206393	And then you have that same breast for light mode, and then there's beginner mode, which has a man breast.
4206733	4208274	Very nice man breast, I must say.
4209074	4211275	And then on heavy mode, I don't know what the fuck that is.
4211295	4214296	Then you have, like, a god, like Trinity from the Matrix.
4216697	4217617	It's the hermaphrodite.
4221679	4224180	Also, let me read this ad for you guys, because it's hilarious.
4224200	4224280	Yeah.
4225917	4249456	I will read this in my announcer voice here Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus is available now This is the latest upgrade for the DDR All new graphics with an incredible speed upgrade We asked the players what they wanted and they said Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up So we did Earnings results up by 40% Is that what everybody was saying?
4249556	4251157	Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up?
4251537	4253419	I think they were saying get rid of it faster
4254096	4258937	No, I think they were saying, give us new songs, give us new mix, new mix, new mix.
4260698	4262798	Not crappy bootlegs, crappy bootlegs.
4265579	4270560	I love this, how you can bring up the screen and then you can speed up the song by 20%.
4270680	4273701	Here's a little problem, though, with it.
4273741	4276021	A few things that just didn't quite work out.
4276802	4279242	Number one, there is no heavy mode.
4279702	4282403	There's beginner, light, standard.
4283294	4286316	Heavy is only selectable on, you know, the song select screen.
4286897	4287417	Number two.
4287437	4291720	If you speed up the song save by 20%, okay, you're done with your game.
4291980	4292500	Guess what?
4292660	4295582	If the person doesn't set it back down to normal, they're still on 20%.
4297324	4298424	It just stays that way.
4298825	4300005	It's really stupid.
4300045	4301707	That should make Max 300 really fun.
4302047	4307951	Yeah, actually, there's an arcade already in Australia that has this, and they said...
4308399	4309600	You know, it's not that bad.
4309640	4311780	It's actually kind of fun to play the sped up songs.
4312121	4313641	But it's just a novelty, I think.
4314181	4324926	You know, if they... See, what I thought when I first heard about DDR Extreme Plus, I thought it was, oh, someone's selling the hacked version of DDR Extreme with the extra modifiers on it.
4325446	4326606	See, now that's what I would have done.
4326626	4330388	If you're going to hack it like this, you know, put those extra modifiers on there as well.
4331728	4334489	Here, I'm going to simulate for you guys what this would sound like, okay?
4334550	4336270	So here's a fast song already, alright?
4336310	4337011	Waka Laka.
4337971	4338131	Oops.
4338516	4339797	Sorry, let me play this for you guys.
4342099	4346422	Okay, now let's see what it sounds like if we were to up the speed by 20%.
4346562	4348903	Now you know how hard this song is already, right?
4348923	4349864	Okay, here we go.
4362513	4364054	I would die trying to play this.
4364714	4366756	This would give me a heart failure, okay?
4367739	4371121	They would have to get the defibrillators out for me on this crap.
4375623	4377103	It made the song sound a little better, though.
4378684	4379164	See you now.
4380305	4380625	Alright.
4383026	4383906	This is really stupid.
4384567	4389129	Arcade owners are actually... The people that bought Megamix are ready to snatch this up for another $650.
4390329	4392210	Yes, that's how much Megamix was.
4392410	4396672	$650 to get a really shitty version of DDR Extreme with crap graphics.
4397310	4401753	Arcade owners actually paid this, so there's obviously money in this.
4402033	4405516	And, now, this is distributed through a company called Dakota Games.
4405976	4417223	Dakota Games is also known for another hack that's Daytona CRX, which is basically Daytona with Super Off-Road added to it.
4417283	4425389	Basically, it's the ability, which is kind of cool, it's the ability to save profiles and you upgrade car parts and stuff to make your cars have
4425851	4428172	More speed, more traction, etc.
4428472	4429552	Now, that's a cool feature.
4429792	4431193	It adds, you know, stuff to the game.
4431593	4435754	Now, this, while it being a really shitty hack, it does add features to it.
4435914	4443497	So, it's a really... I wouldn't go spend $650 on it, but hey, whatever.
4443637	4447579	I mean, at least it's not like Megamix, but it is still crap.
4448999	4450039	It's getting better, though.
4450439	4451480	They're starting to learn.
4451520	4454661	They actually did something I didn't think, you know, of, so...
4455948	4456969	More power to them, I guess.
4461030	4465032	I don't know what to think about this whole, like, we're going to do the tempo change and change the game here.
4465052	4468854	I think it would have been cool if they had to slow it down by 20% mode.
4469114	4470094	That would have been cool.
4471715	4475096	Oh, now I've got to try it again to see what slowed down 20% would sound like.
4477057	4477538	Yes, I do.
4479178	4479919	You know you want to hear it.
4482840	4482960	Ugh.
4483615	4484556	Jamie, what do you think of this?
4484576	4488900	Would you ever play this game, or is this just utter crap to you, or what?
4488920	4490602	I have two words for this.
4491963	4493425	Hell no.
4494306	4494766	Why not?
4495126	4496568	Because it's just stupid.
4496648	4502594	If I want to play DDR, I would go play, like, you know, Max 2 or Extreme.
4502834	4506498	I'd like to add that, you know that arcade chain Tilt that's in...
4507250	4508190	Waka Laka Slow Down
4532264	4533045	If I can get it to play.
4533545	4533925	Okay.
4535126	4536607	Now let's see what it'll be down 20%.
4542851	4543852	Now I can beat it.
4544312	4547654	Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
4547694	4549656	This is like training mode, kind of.
4553338	4554639	I can almost stand this song now.
4564364	4565465	Jenny, Ranma, and the Demon.
4565845	4571110	See, we knew there was something to that Devil Devil Revolution thing going on.
4571150	4577136	Chatroom is letting you know that somebody who says they worked for Tilt said they did not upgrade all the machines.
4577836	4579278	Well, that still doesn't matter.
4579318	4580699	You upgraded some of them.
4580719	4581820	That still makes you stupid.
4583361	4587345	I'm so glad that... It's like, I didn't inject all the heroin.
4590120	4591261	Yes, Jamie?
4591741	4595683	The tilt in my town of birth was bought out by Namco, thank God.
4596983	4598084	So it doesn't suck.
4602786	4606027	We have some other news we want to share with you guys, unless anybody else has anything to say on Megamix.
4607328	4608428	Can I burp?
4609709	4609909	Sure.
4611491	4611931	Thank you.
4612372	4613092	I didn't have to now.
4637045	4642510	That should be a very good read, so check DDRspot.com the next couple days and wait for that.
4642730	4648916	Also, he's looking for, they scored an interview, DDRspot also scored an interview with Naoki.
4649940	4652100	They're going to be doing an interview with Naoki in the next few days.
4652380	4660782	They are still looking to field questions, so Mel has said his email box is open to you guys if you want to send him some questions.
4661542	4669384	I know this is ironic because the interview is for DDR Spot, but if you want to send Mel an email, if you have a question for Naoki, Mel will consider all your questions.
4669404	4675065	He won't ask everything, because if everybody sends a question, that interview is going to be an hour long, but he'll consider all your stuff.
4675745	4679826	Mel at DDRFreak.com is his email.
4680410	4685614	So, just send that along if you have a question you would like to ask Naoki.
4686174	4688736	Such as, you want some fashion tips?
4690618	4691298	Who does his hair?
4691718	4693159	Naoki eye for the straight guy.
4694641	4696222	How deep in the punani are you?
4697943	4698403	Okay.
4703307	4705809	See, the questions I want to ask, Mel isn't going to ask.
4705829	4705909	Okay.
4707560	4712483	I want to know if he ever really has boinked, Paula Terry, or if it's a purely professional relationship.
4717066	4718207	I would love to have Nokia.
4718307	4722390	I would give a lot of head to get any Bomani celebrity on this show.
4723370	4724871	Because then that means we've made it.
4727353	4728034	That's a good idea.
4728394	4733117	You know, we were supposed to have an interview with Jason Enos from Konami, but...
4734034	4737457	In typical Orange Lounge fashion, that all got fucked up.
4737597	4740680	Yeah, and I missed my chance to go hang out with the man, thank you.
4740700	4749307	Which is too bad, because it was a... Honestly, guys, I hate to say this, it was a great interview, because Loki fucking asked... I can't believe you had the balls to do this.
4749647	4752749	Loki fucking asked him about Into the Groove, okay?
4753510	4754411	He had a very good answer.
4754451	4756913	He had a very good answer, and I wish I could remember it.
4757293	4761216	It was easy to encourage the community to keep growing.
4761997	4763458	Yeah, something like that.
4765441	4766081	It was something like that.
4766862	4771224	He basically was welcoming the challenge, basically.
4771905	4773566	Which I thought was very professional.
4774046	4774646	He's a good guy.
4774806	4776768	I'm sad about what happened to the interview.
4781070	4782551	Yeah, what he told us off-air was hilarious.
4782591	4783051	No, I'm just kidding.
4784352	4789295	We thank him for taking the time to do the interview with us, even though it never aired, because mistakes happen.
4791516	4792957	Bad mistakes happen.
4795478	4796778	We could have brought back Portal.
4797739	4799159	That's very true.
4801060	4803260	We could have merged with G4, okay?
4803300	4804321	That could have been what happened.
4804941	4806241	Yeah, I wouldn't mind that.
4807302	4807782	That's true.
4808482	4811863	I wouldn't mind Taka and Taku naked in the same room.
4813244	4813544	Alright.
4814504	4816765	In response to Jason in the chatroom.
4817005	4820766	While Jamie lives out her fantasy over there, perhaps... I'm not living out any fantasy!
4823993	4825214	You have another news story you want to talk about?
4825254	4828216	Yeah, well, stuff unrelated with... Okay, fine, Loki.
4829096	4837082	Because I'm not quite on, you know, the pulse of all the new music games that come out, this one kind of slipped under my radar.
4837902	4840764	It's a game called I Can Boogie.
4842105	4842465	Okay.
4843706	4845007	Say that one more time, Loki.
4846069	4847450	You're an ass, okay?
4848050	4849311	It's called I Can Boogie, okay?
4849432	4855996	It's basically, if you were to take iToy Groove, put it in an arcade cabinet that looks something like Pump It Up, that's what you've got.
4856897	4858098	And it looks pretty cool.
4858178	4865443	We just got it down at one of our arcades in the Century 14 in Roseville, down near Sacramento.
4865644	4866684	We got one of these things.
4866884	4869566	I have yet to play it, but it sounds really cool.
4869586	4871188	It looks kind of neat.
4871428	4875551	It's got actual music from artists, no covers or anything, hot stuff.
4876240	4877100	from Donna Summers.
4877881	4886424	It's got, was it, something like Jan Jackson on there and some other stuff.
4886724	4887584	It's pretty good, though.
4889185	4893887	It just looks interesting because it uses a camera just like, you know, iToy Groove.
4895047	4898989	So, if you've got one of these by you, because I also heard there's one at Dave & Buster's in Milpitas.
4899149	4900629	If you've got one by you, you should check it out.
4902350	4905011	So, yeah, that was all I had.
4905805	4913670	And you can find that at, I believe, iKinGroove.com But you actually haven't gotten a chance to play this yet.
4914251	4914831	No, not yet.
4915111	4915411	Not yet.
4919694	4920034	Alright.
4922336	4924497	So they basically turned iToy Groove into an arcade game.
4924537	4926679	Somebody stole that idea and turned it into an arcade game.
4927439	4927519	Yeah.
4928040	4928440	Interesting.
4928800	4931222	iToy Groove... I wasn't that thrilled with iToy Groove.
4931262	4933263	Like, it was cool for a day, and then that was it.
4933823	4934444	Like, I don't know...
4935816	4942719	I don't know why that game just didn't do it for me, but the thing is with this arcade game, it's like a cross between Itoy Groove and Parapara.
4943540	4944700	That's pretty much what it is.
4944760	4952884	Because it's, I think, there's five points, like five sensors, spots that you have to hit, you know, depending on how the arrows come.
4954085	4956186	And they've got, you know, pretty interesting stuff.
4956646	4956746	Um...
4958024	4980134	on there, um, that was, oh, that was the other thing, since someone mentioned DDR Karaoke Mix, there was actually one of those very, very, very rare arcade games being sold on Yahoo Auctions for $1,600 at Karaoke Revolution 2nd Mix, or not Karaoke Revolution, um, DDR Karaoke Mix 2nd Mix, which I thought that was pretty sweet.
4980834	4985336	If I had that kind of, you know, cash, I would buy one, but I don't, so...
4988666	4989947	My second mix substream.
4991688	4992028	Oh yeah.
4992209	4993489	You have the 2DX machine too?
4993769	4994490	That's what I want.
4994710	4995390	Awesome.
4995551	4999933	You have the only one in the US, I think.
5000534	5012821	Well, we said right off the bat when we buy our house we're getting a DDR machine and I'm thinking of trying to get that in the... I want to get an actual second style build substream machine.
5013516	5015477	You know, the old style monitor and everything.
5016438	5016698	I know.
5017578	5017918	Yeah.
5017998	5021200	But if I can, I doubt it would be that expensive for that particular machine.
5023501	5024142	Well, good luck to you.
5025502	5027183	Alright, you guys want to have yourselves a cage match?
5027203	5029064	We haven't had one of these in a while, it feels like.
5029264	5029904	We sure haven't.
5030045	5032966	Alright, there's going to be kind of a small twist in tonight's cage match.
5035434	5045703	The twist in tonight's cage match is that we are cleaning the slate and we're not going to carry a winner over from the show three weeks ago because basically it's won for like three weeks now by default.
5046023	5051488	So we are wiping the slate clean and we're starting off with three brand new songs tonight in tonight's cage match.
5051908	5056652	So the way the cage match works, each host brings one song to the table.
5057762	5075298	and we're going to play these songs and then you're going to vote on your favorite in the chat room and your song that you pick as your favorite will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program with all your favorite DDR, 2DX and Dance Mania favorites that'll include the cage match winner from tonight
5075917	5077118	Um, we'll go into rotation.
5077438	5080641	And then it'll come back next week to compete again against two challengers.
5081101	5084724	So, we get a clean slate tonight, so that means we're gonna hear three new songs in full.
5085224	5096853	Cage Match kinda used to have this theme of songs that would be good for Bomani, like DDR, 2DX, but now it's kind of evolved into cool stuff, but looking at tonight's lineup, I'd say we're kinda going back to our roots here.
5096913	5100815	All three of these songs look to be songs that'll be made for Bomani.
5101236	5103057	So this should be a fun Cage Match tonight.
5103297	5103818	Not mine.
5105288	5106529	So make sure you are in.
5106549	5109511	Well, I'm just looking at your artists and knowing their music.
5110472	5110772	We'll see.
5112414	5114255	If you want to vote, remember you have to be in our chat room.
5114355	5115436	Orangeloungeradio.com.
5115456	5117417	Click on chat and then you'll be able to place a vote.
5117778	5118338	So here we go.
5118999	5125964	First up tonight is Loki and he's actually the one who won three weeks ago but we couldn't even remember what song it was so we're giving him a new song tonight.
5126314	5128075	What song are you putting in the cage match tonight?
5128995	5137879	Well, I've put this artist in a few times now, and since they have a new song that's going to be in DDR Extreme, I thought, hey, let's take a song from another game, Need for Speed Underground.
5137999	5143541	And this is also featured in Tourney Mix 5, if anyone really gives a damn about that.
5143821	5152164	But this is BT featuring Wild Side with... I think it was Wild Side or Wild Style.
5152885	5153405	Okay, something...
5154468	5160651	Wild Side is the Irresistible Mom band from Xtreme, so I don't think it's that.
5161571	5162912	It might be Wild Style, I think.
5163032	5167533	Anyway, it's BT featuring Wild Style, and this is Kimo Sabe.
5167553	5169774	Alright, here it is.
5169874	5171375	That was in Frequency.
5172315	5172996	What's in Frequency?
5173716	5174376	Well, okay.
5174856	5176837	Is it in Frequency or Amplitude, too?
5176977	5178038	Well, here it is.
5178158	5178558	Enjoy it.
5178738	5180739	BT, Kimo Sabe, song number one.
5291303	5291717	Full Effect
5333706	5335924	I bust positive vibes from the west to Maui
5369588	5371253	Pull it back Pull it back
5432741	5433384	Thanks for watching!
5469870	5470730	Watch out for my man B.T.
5470750	5470870	B.T.
5470890	5471290	B.T.
5471310	5471410	B.T.
5471470	5471510	B.T.
5471550	5471910	B.T.
5471930	5472090	B.T.
5472251	5472311	B.T.
5472331	5472471	B.T.
5472491	5472691	B.T.
5472731	5472851	B.T.
5472871	5473031	B.T.
5473051	5473091	B.T.
5500964	5502105	I've heard that song a whole lot.
5504307	5505407	Alright, Loki.
5506488	5509190	It's my favorite song in Tourney Mix 5, so it gets a 10.
5510291	5510772	Interesting.
5512093	5515055	Um, to be honest, BT just doesn't do it for me.
5515175	5520619	Like a lot of other artists in his genre do, and especially that song just doesn't do it for me.
5520719	5522521	So I give it like a, it's okay.
5523101	5524802	So I give it like an okay score of like 6.5.
5524942	5528165	I don't know, it just doesn't do it for me.
5529130	5531511	Alright, it's not gay enough, I think that's what it is.
5531871	5534192	I don't know how you got that confused.
5534852	5536753	When I heard Wild Side, I got excited.
5537233	5538674	But no, it was Wild Child.
5539094	5540374	Alright, moving on.
5541034	5543876	Song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us from Jamie.
5544236	5548037	And I gotta say, I'm a little bit surprised at her pick, but let's see what's up.
5548217	5550398	My song has the power of porn behind it.
5551411	5553792	It's Tracy Lord, let's say something.
5554833	5555513	Okay, this is the thing.
5555713	5560936	I went on a big downloading spree trying to find this one Tracy Lord song.
5562137	5563998	And if anyone knows what this is, please tell me.
5564178	5565899	I'm in the chat room right now, 7 p.m.
5566339	5568940	It's one about this woman getting revenge on a cowboy.
5571142	5573603	It's not Fallen Angel?
5573943	5574704	It's not Fallen Angel.
5575464	5579026	I have a remix of a Tracy Lord song done by Paula Confold.
5579912	5580572	Dude, I want that.
5580592	5585255	Good for you!
5585295	5589117	But it... I heard the song, like, when I was in college the first time.
5589417	5589917	That was, like, in 95.
5590057	5595520	And the CD was about a year old then, so if that helps anybody, find the song for me.
5595780	5601123	But anyway, this particular one, this one is, like, it definitely has the power of porn behind it.
5601383	5606966	Because this is, like, a song that someone would participate in nocturnal activities to.
5608019	5609680	Oh my, nocturnal activities.
5610500	5613941	Alright, let's hear it then.
5614642	5618483	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Tracy Lord's Say Something.
5618964	5619284	Enjoy.
5637795	5638036	Thank you.
5695373	5697475	How did you know I am lonely?
5697495	5700458	Dear mama, say something How did you know I am lonely?
5700478	5702679	Dear mama, say something How did you know I am lonely?
5730299	5731744	Thanks for watching!
5784505	5786827	How did you know I am only here a moment?
5786847	5789649	Say something How did you know I am only here a moment?
5789669	5789769	Say
5813450	5814411	Thanks for watching!
5871874	5873175	Song number two was right there.
5873215	5875236	It was Tracy Lords with Say Something.
5875657	5876937	Say something about that song, Jamie.
5879039	5879839	I like that song.
5879859	5883322	I'm going to give it an eight.
5883702	5884562	She's done better.
5885203	5886524	Apparently she sucks live.
5888085	5888945	Imagine that.
5889345	5893668	Porn star given music career who can't really sing without a studio.
5893989	5897931	Dan said that he went to some show that was going on that had like Moby and a bunch of people.
5897951	5899012	This was a few years ago.
5900273	5905435	He said that Moby got naked and tried scratching wood.
5905535	5907716	But he said that she wasn't very good live.
5907756	5909116	But I don't know, the song was okay.
5909176	5910357	It sort of reminds me of Slow.
5911818	5912598	So I give it an 8.
5914419	5914759	Interesting.
5916479	5918560	Oh, did Loki go second or did I go second?
5918580	5919040	I don't remember.
5919400	5920221	Loki went second, I think.
5921601	5923682	Yeah, I could see fucking to that.
5926083	5928204	I'll give it an 8, because...
5929008	5929989	Tracy Lords is cool.
5930269	5931010	She did Control.
5933532	5935974	Um, yeah, that's definitely a song to fuck to.
5936574	5942399	Um, I don't know if I could imagine it on our station regularly, but, um, it's unique.
5943280	5944541	And it did get me a little horny.
5944681	5945202	Just a little bit.
5945962	5946763	Just kidding, just kidding.
5948620	5950242	I don't get the slow comparison though.
5950262	5953906	They're both slow songs, but Kylie's way...
5972093	5973554	Your votes count though, not ours.
5973594	5976656	There is one more song you get to vote for, possibly, if you want to.
5977096	5978417	And that's My Pick.
5979258	5985742	My Pick is an artist that you've actually already heard on our station because she was on a Dance Mania album.
5986282	5988564	And she used to be with a group, you might have heard of them.
5988984	5990445	You know the Spice Girls?
5990685	5991766	You ever heard of the Spice Girls?
5992830	5994351	I was laughing at the Sam magazine.
5994391	5996013	That's right.
5997254	6001598	Well, Sporty Spice has a solo career, believe it or not, and she has some big dance hits.
6002278	6009905	I too, like Jamie, went on a downloading spree this week, and I was downloading all these British dance compilations, and this song turned up on one of them, and I kind of liked it.
6010466	6012287	So I'm going to put it in tonight's cage match.
6012348	6017912	It's Melanie C, and the song is Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, and it's the Shanghai Surprise remix.
6018866	6021588	Wasn't that the movie with Madonna and Sean Penn from like years ago?
6021969	6022889	Shanghai Surprise?
6024311	6026012	That was supposed to be like this horrible movie.
6026212	6028514	I assure you this song is way better than the movie.
6028534	6029435	At least I think so.
6030876	6033438	The rest of you, I don't care what you think, but we'll see.
6033478	6034219	Hopefully you'll like it.
6034439	6036541	I found the page with the old guy again.
6038743	6041645	The listeners don't even know what you're doing over there.
6041665	6042786	I know, I'm not going to say anything.
6042826	6043327	You shouldn't.
6043427	6043727	Alright.
6044928	6045769	Oh, here comes Loki.
6047062	6055167	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on a mission Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you're with me, raise your hands Yeah, yeah, yeah, got no inhibitions, it's our decision
6079139	6081821	Easy girl, don't let go Be given to yourself tonight
6131317	6132242	Thanks for watching!
6202677	6204438	Thank you for watching!
6238562	6239925	Thanks for watching!
6291944	6293444	All righty, song number three tonight.
6293564	6295224	Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.
6295685	6296445	What'd you think?
6296545	6298625	Yeah Yeah Yeah or Oh Hell No?
6298745	6299026	Jamie?
6299186	6300106	It gets a yeah.
6300626	6303567	I mean, it's good, don't get me wrong.
6303627	6304887	It's just kind of generic, you know.
6305447	6308348	So it gets a six, seven-ish.
6309188	6309568	Seven-ish.
6310149	6311129	Seven-ish from Jamie.
6311209	6311469	Loki?
6313641	6319923	I've heard this somewhere before, I don't know if it's another artist's song or what, but I don't like the Spice Girls.
6320263	6325004	I don't like Melanin C. The only thing they're good in is nude pictures.
6326145	6330146	So, uh, yeah, I give it a yeah, yeah, yeah, five.
6332274	6338940	I don't know, to me that song, it's so British, and it's like a song I would hear at a soccer game, seriously.
6339901	6342843	And that so fits 45, I'm sorry, football.
6343384	6344024	Football!
6344044	6346086	Goal!
6346386	6348368	Yeah, yeah, yeah!
6348388	6349148	So I could hear that.
6349929	6352711	So I give it like an 8, because I think that would be fun for DDR.
6352952	6355273	I might do a sim file to it if I get unlazy, ever.
6355834	6359397	Alright, let's review the three songs before I open up the voting lines.
6359761	6364245	Here we go, a review of the three songs you can vote for tonight, because it is up to you.
6364745	6368348	Song number one, BT featuring Wildchild, Kimo Sabe.
6374834	6378317	Song number two tonight, Tracy Lords with Say Something.
6379058	6380599	How did you know I am lonely?
6387625	6390823	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.
6399586	6402969	All righty, place vote now.
6403129	6406051	To place your votes, just send Sky a message in the chatroom.
6406071	6408493	That's me, talking about myself in the third person again.
6409153	6411335	Send me a message in the chatroom with your vote.
6411795	6417419	Winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6418520	6421502	Meanwhile, back to some of the news we missed the three weeks we were out.
6421842	6426506	You know, another article that came out while we were gone was on the Fox News Channel.
6427674	6428314	Fox News Channel.
6428334	6429535	You guys know Fox News Channel?
6430135	6433657	Home of the Bill O'Reilly show and all those fun conservative talk programs.
6433897	6434837	If I didn't watch TV.
6435617	6436858	Okay, well, I know you don't watch TV.
6436938	6438098	I think I know, though.
6438138	6442440	They're giving CNN a little bit of a run because they have some talk programs that people, for some reason, like.
6443280	6443781	But whatever.
6443921	6444701	I won't hate right now.
6445001	6449143	But actually, they ran an article about DDR and a weight loss article.
6451357	6454379	It's again another, isn't DDR great because people lost weight playing it?
6454419	6458061	But this article quotes some friends of the show.
6458681	6461963	Some buddies of Orange Lounge Radio were quoted in this article.
6462403	6466346	And Mel B and Sharksgirl were both quoted in this article, which I thought was cool.
6466666	6467506	Yeah, so good for them.
6468027	6469667	There's a link to it over there on a website.
6469868	6471288	I'll kind of summarize for you guys.
6472749	6477652	It's just kind of talking about, you know, it breaks down how to play DDR, how DDR is played.
6478712	6483715	says the assistant editor at Wired Magazine, you're literally controlling the game with your whole body and not just your fingertips.
6484096	6486997	It's definitely a new genre that will probably get bigger.
6490579	6491360	That will probably.
6492381	6493341	It might get a little bigger.
6493521	6493741	Might.
6494222	6497183	Assuming it doesn't kill off its players with heart attacks.
6501046	6506709	But a relatively new genre, I don't know about you guys, but I've known about this game for
6507745	6508986	Damn near four years now.
6509106	6512128	I don't know about the rest of you guys, but that's not that new.
6513189	6515471	Well, I'm sorry, but it's not old school like Christ.
6519234	6521016	That is like way old school, man.
6522417	6524038	DDR is like a lot better.
6525157	6528118	He's probably talking about the history of time thing.
6528559	6529879	That would be relatively new.
6530759	6531660	You're right.
6532180	6534481	Considering the entire history of time, it would be new.
6534681	6539603	And considering that a lot of people that watch Fox News Channel are old people, it would make sense.
6540763	6549526	Our buddy Mel Baltazar says he was drawn to DDR because he likes music-based games, but after a while he noticed an unexpected side benefit.
6551147	6551347	What?
6553084	6554325	No, not heart attacks.
6556046	6558888	In the first four months or so, I lost around 30 pounds.
6558988	6560990	Actually, from Mel, it would have sounded something like this.
6561890	6565193	Yo, dawg, in the first 40 months or so, dawg, I lost around 30 pounds, dawg.
6565393	6566154	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
6568635	6569436	He's going to kick my ass.
6570637	6573459	Well, you know, because he did Randy Jackson to your idols.
6573499	6574800	It's a joke, it's a joke, Jesus.
6575861	6578382	In about six to eight months, I went from 280 to 230.
6579623	6581865	I play nowadays to keep in shape more than anything.
6582711	6583231	Very interesting.
6584072	6593478	DDR fan Melody Haman, also known as SharksGirl on this program, also shed pounds while she played going from about 220 to 143 at her lowest weight.
6593858	6596900	I never realized that she lost that much weight playing DDR.
6597901	6598501	I never knew that.
6598621	6599922	SharksGirl is like one of my best buds.
6600042	6603304	I never knew that she went from 220 to 143 from DDR.
6603644	6605065	I know, I'm a bad friend.
6606006	6607327	She should so fire me.
6609008	6609608	I just didn't know.
6610409	6610949	Well, that's great.
6612537	6615538	She says, I'm significantly lighter than when I wasn't playing, she said.
6615578	6618479	You're not just using your hands, you're actually getting up and doing something.
6619779	6632763	With the obesity epidemic in America reaching epic proportions, I think it would have been better if they said biblical proportions, and video games, the internet and television accused of being among the culprits, entertainment that combines physical activity with technology could be the wave of the future.
6633742	6642446	said SportWall founder and CEO Kathy Lamberti, we have to give them the computer game packaged with their physical fitness, otherwise they're not going to be interested.
6642986	6643807	Kids have changed.
6643827	6647328	They've been taught how to be entertained and seduced by technology.
6649189	6650550	Seduced by technology.
6653211	6654371	DDR is going to seduce you.
6654391	6656512	Yeah, I know.
6656552	6658553	I get it hard on every time I pirate movies.
6660974	6662795	Technology sure knows how to seduce me.
6667644	6668784	Mel had another quote in here.
6669705	6674165	There's that stigma that people who play video games are slobs who just sit on the couch.
6674766	6676366	I always thought that was true, actually.
6677966	6682487	In DDR, it's more of an interactive experience where you're putting yourself into the game.
6682527	6687228	Now, I don't know about you guys, but I got the DDR for Xbox this week.
6687808	6690469	Well, not this week, but a couple weeks ago, and I've been playing on Xbox Live.
6690929	6695030	And my fat ass has been on the couch schooling people by playing on the controller, so...
6696480	6697740	and I've been having lots of fun.
6704202	6714446	To date, Konami Digital Entertainment, which distributes DDR, has sold more than 6.5 million copies worldwide and 1 million in the United States.
6717106	6718047	And let's see.
6718127	6719587	Oh, Jason, you notice I had a quote in here too.
6719927	6725249	This is a game that defies all the other games out there because the person has to get up and do the work.
6726869	6728710	Scooby Ball Scooby Ball Scooby Ball
6758155	6761356	Loki, why don't you share with us what's going on in the sim scene these days?
6761537	6763678	I know there's got to be some news these past few weeks.
6764018	6765399	Well, Turnabix is still going, right?
6765499	6765839	What's up?
6767040	6768040	I think it's still going.
6768520	6768961	I don't know.
6769441	6772022	The last release I got was number four.
6773663	6775824	And I haven't seen anything since then.
6775904	6776965	I mean, I've looked.
6777305	6778606	It's just nothing.
6779847	6783869	I don't know if they're still voting or what the hell's going on, but...
6785287	6787388	Yeah, there's four sections for Tourney Mix.
6788869	6792532	Checking right now, see if there's number five.
6792692	6794173	Nope, just bracket four still.
6794853	6798115	So apparently bracket four rounds up the end of Tourney Mix five.
6800917	6801777	But you know what?
6802018	6802858	No one cares.
6803098	6806120	There's... Wasn't that many good stuff.
6806560	6812984	To be honest, it's still like the same 5% of the songs are decent and 2% are good and the rest suck.
6813485	6813885	But, um,
6814889	6817690	and some other interesting stuff if you're a TourneyMix fan.
6818251	6826615	On DDRUK's forums, they've got in the music production thread DJ Damien's V-Rare CD that he put out.
6826795	6829356	Basically, it's a zip file of all the songs that he's made.
6831097	6832118	They're okay.
6832238	6839102	They've got, you know, your famous Art 2 and then, you know, the Legend of Art that were featured in TourneyMix 1, 2, and 4, I think.
6839122	6839242	And, um...
6843749	6844169	What else?
6844930	6846632	Just some other crap that he's done.
6847152	6850676	But if you want something to download on your board, there you go.
6852618	6855241	Aside from that, really not too much going on.
6855902	6857524	There is some interesting stuff, though.
6857624	6863711	I noticed that since DDRUK has their set media machine, which is DDX, or Dance...
6864242	6866264	Dance something or other, I don't know, whatever.
6867085	6875011	Anyways, it's got internet rankings, which I'm assuming is probably something that's thrown into Stepmania now.
6875091	6878053	So, you know, hey, look for internet rankings, it'll be coming soon.
6878594	6881596	As well as extended light support, people are working on that right now.
6882037	6886460	There's talks about using serial ports, maybe USB ports for lights.
6886961	6890764	Right now, parallel ports are, you know, supported, so...
6891559	6893801	There's information on DDR Maniacs for that.
6894401	6899585	Um, tons more sim files for download on, um, Bomani Style and their sim file database.
6900166	6906691	A lot of them suck, though, but, hey, you know, look at the rankings on the sides, um, to get an idea what might be good and what's not.
6907571	6910473	Um, aside from that, really not too much stuff going on.
6910554	6913836	No new alphas, um, for Stepmania released.
6914076	6916978	Um, it's just been kinda slow.
6918139	6919480	Slow news week.
6919660	6920241	No, um,
6920971	6930533	Service Pack 6 for Ultramix, which we did not mention, because that is news and all.
6932233	6934994	Nothing yet, because it has not come out yet.
6936514	6938334	It's pretty much all that's going on.
6938574	6944215	There's a nice thread, though, on DDR Maniacs' Setmania theme boards.
6944475	6947616	They're basically how-to guides to make your skin better, which is cool.
6949009	6953352	And it just proves that you can make a sim that looks exactly like in the group.
6953493	6956135	So, yeah.
6956155	6958737	Anyways.
6959137	6959898	I kind of agree.
6960579	6963882	Somebody in the chatroom said DJ Damien's kind of crap stuff.
6964462	6967184	Maybe it's just because I'm not a cool kid, but I don't get the joke.
6967345	6970808	It's not funny, and it's kind of stupid to me.
6971348	6972589	Yeah, I guess it's just British.
6973310	6974771	Like, Spice Girls, I get that.
6974951	6975992	DJ Damien, I don't get it.
6977932	6978472	Yes, Jamie.
6980234	6981955	What, about him being crappy?
6982175	6982435	Yeah.
6984016	6987058	Oh, you picked up the microphone, so I thought you were going to say something.
6987138	6987838	I don't get it.
6988279	6988519	Yeah.
6989620	6991341	Have you heard his stuff?
6992461	6992561	No.
6992601	6994443	Play Jamie a little bit of one of these songs.
6994563	6995023	Play the best one.
6995043	6995803	The best one?
6997044	6997805	The best one.
6999766	7000707	I can't wait to hear this.
7003949	7007271	I don't think this should be getting any airtime on the show, but since Loki brought it up...
7012239	7015441	Sure, sure, Ballad of Tom Jones.
7016181	7017242	Let's hear a little bit of this.
7021604	7022505	Put it in the middle somewhere.
7024626	7028528	The two of us would surely have ended up dead.
7028988	7032110	You thought that from killing each other.
7032130	7032430	Okay.
7032450	7033851	Tom Jones, Tom Jones.
7033891	7037012	You'll never know, but you saved my life.
7037032	7038173	Tom Jones, Tom Jones.
7055290	7056470	Oh god, that's horrible.
7056630	7058491	See, I don't get it.
7058511	7059451	Why do you think he's good?
7060011	7062112	I don't get it.
7062292	7062852	You know what it is?
7062932	7064752	It's the William Hung of DDR.
7064932	7065933	That is exactly what it is.
7066913	7069734	But William Hung is good compared to this guy.
7079376	7081377	So, I don't know.
7081497	7081777	Whatever.
7082386	7085929	The song makes... Listening to that made me angsty and full of rage.
7086129	7088591	Well, then we'll have to get into the FUs very soon after we come back.
7088991	7095036	But... But, um, we got, um... We've got a cage match winner to announce, boys and girls.
7096177	7097598	I know you're excited to hear about this.
7098218	7103662	Tonight's cage match winner was the one and only... This should be a big surprise to you guys.
7104183	7108226	Loki... BT with Kimo Sari.
7108246	7109287	That's who I would have voted for.
7111050	7113051	You wouldn't have even voted for the own song you put in?
7113571	7113851	No.
7114271	7114551	Alright.
7114571	7117352	Because I have come very close to using that song before.
7117572	7119813	Well... I thought that I might have, but it was another song.
7119953	7124614	If I'm going to be gone for two weeks, I'm going to give you guys such crap songs to play in cage match while I'm gone.
7124654	7125234	I can't wait.
7125595	7126515	I'll pick them for you, Rob.
7126615	7126875	No.
7127355	7128836	I already have them lined up.
7129736	7131016	I already have them lined up.
7132037	7132997	So tune in next week.
7133337	7134157	I'll be there in spirit.
7135158	7135438	Alright.
7136338	7136518	Just...
7138342	7141785	When we come back from this next break, boys and girls, the FUs of the week.
7141925	7143426	I know you've got some rants in you.
7144767	7145267	Send them.
7145928	7146809	What'd you say, Jamie?
7147449	7148390	I made a request.
7149431	7149831	Oh, yeah, yeah.
7149911	7153234	Oh, I thought you said, when I said, I know you've got some rants in you, I thought you said a ton.
7154715	7156236	Yeah, a ton of those, too.
7158297	7159558	Okay.
7160399	7163862	So, yeah, we'll get to the FUs of the week.
7163882	7165283	So send those in over private message.
7167253	7168273	and we'll take care of that.
7168774	7172375	In the meantime, more poppin' music songs this break, including one Jamie wants to hear.
7172415	7173595	She always wants to hear this song.
7173935	7174775	You know what's sad, though?
7175256	7179117	I lost my folder of the poppin' nine consumer songs.
7179137	7179437	Have them.
7179817	7182158	Good, because I need to get them for you, because I don't have Don't Cry Jesus anymore.
7182178	7182778	I'll get them when I get them.
7182838	7183398	You can send it to me.
7183638	7185179	Because my desktop got erased.
7185459	7187339	Imagine if Loki's desktop got erased.
7187459	7191461	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
7191801	7192121	Don't cry.
7194654	7199137	We'll be back after some more poppin' music, starting off with Gatchaman and some more stuff in here.
7199378	7201419	And when we come back, FUs of the Week, send them now!
7203020	7207844	Who is it?
7207884	7208305	Who is it?
7208345	7208965	Who is it?
7209085	7215410	A shadow dancing in the distance of the sky A shadow of white wings
7226589	7227593	Thank you for watching!
7258539	7260942	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7301663	7302384	Thank you for watching!
7348024	7348984	Thank you for watching.
7349004	7349684	See you next time.
7397396	7398497	Thank you for watching!
7473070	7475673	Thank you for watching!
7537171	7538672	Hey, did you hear about that show?
7539192	7539752	What show?
7540052	7545534	Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.
7545934	7547215	Oh, I've heard of that station.
7547315	7547635	Really?
7548055	7550156	Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.
7550636	7552917	Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?
7553117	7554077	Well, you die.
7554697	7555238	I, what?
7556058	7560199	Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?
7562478	7563598	Orange Lounge Radio.
7563758	7565159	Listen or DIE!
7570780	7572440	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
7572460	7574760	We're going to get into the FUs of the week very shortly.
7577841	7580941	Gosh, I'm not sure what else is going on in the money world right now.
7581401	7583562	Loki, you seem to be more on top of things than I am.
7584962	7586022	What are you checking out there?
7586962	7589363	This is, like I was saying earlier, their...
7590592	7606418	DDRUK's DanceDX, and they're on their version 2 now, and I'm going to, in just one second here, link the chatroom to their gallery for this, which it's actually, it's a very well put together set menu machine, I might add.
7606838	7614601	They have a lot of people working on it, and it's the way I wish Golfland would work, where you have more than one person working on it.
7615404	7617445	What exactly is going on with that thing?
7617685	7621746	Even our chatroom's curious, because it's been three weeks since we really had an update, and I know there's kind of some stuff going on.
7621786	7626187	What exactly happened with that EX2 project you've been really heavily involved with?
7627387	7628528	Keith broke the motherboard.
7629048	7630588	That's pretty much what it comes down to.
7631249	7638751	And no, I'm not going to go buy a new motherboard, because as it was, I put more time and effort into it than was needed.
7638771	7641872	And that's what it sounds like he wants me to do, is get a new motherboard for it.
7641892	7642892	I'm like, no, so...
7643821	7644922	Whatever happens, happens.
7645262	7647563	They got their money out of it, I got my money out of it.
7648444	7650085	So, no one's at a real loss.
7651665	7665973	Sucks for them because they rewired their whole cabinet, but you know... Someday I guess we can put a new motherboard in it, but I really... It's just a pain in the ass the way it was set up and things don't work that should work.
7666714	7669455	It's just really annoying and real frustrating.
7669475	7669535	But...
7671711	7676633	I learned from it, and hopefully my next project won't be as bad.
7678833	7680654	Any chance you'll do a cabinet for a different arcade?
7682394	7683915	Actually, that's what the other project is.
7684635	7690036	It's not a cabinet for another arcade, it's a plug-and-play upgrade for any arcade.
7690557	7691977	That's what I'm looking into right now.
7692157	7698839	Basically, taking all the stuff I've learned from this, and we'll apply it to any arcade, because guess what I found out?
7699341	7702143	You don't need to license Statmania from them.
7702363	7704744	It's free to sell, do whatever you want with it.
7705505	7711528	As long as you keep the development team's credit in there, which that's already hard programmed into it.
7712169	7720814	So, technically, yeah, I could go out there, make an upgrade for an arcade, and sell it, and make money off it.
7722655	7725597	So, I'm looking into it.
7726707	7728989	No, I wonder how many people are going to steal your idea right there.
7729229	7729489	Huh?
7729649	7730570	Check your legal channels.
7730770	7730991	Yeah.
7731671	7732592	Just cover your butt.
7732992	7735935	But I figure if they can get away with that Megamix thing.
7736555	7737176	Here's what it is.
7737616	7744101	I don't have to check any legal channels because all I'm doing is providing the hardware and the program to run it.
7744822	7745983	They made the program.
7746203	7747084	I made the hardware.
7747604	7749145	There's nothing I can get in trouble for.
7749165	7751247	What do you mean?
7751347	7752088	That's the program.
7753229	7754169	That's all Stepmania.
7754189	7755270	That's their licensing.
7755310	7756171	That's their problem.
7756579	7758660	All I'm doing is making the hardware setup for it.
7759100	7761622	So there's no way I can get in trouble for building a PC.
7762162	7767585	That's, you know, they can try, but, you know, it's not going to work.
7768005	7769726	So that's if I were to do it.
7771046	7773728	And if the coppers ever come after me, Loki did it!
7773988	7774928	He had the gun!
7775349	7778290	It was Loki with a revolver in the conservatory.
7778390	7779751	I saw it with my own eyes.
7782292	7783793	Let's get on with the FUs of the week, shall we?
7785037	7787478	What do we do during the FUs of the week, Miss Jamie?
7787718	7803944	We bitch and moon.
7804784	7806344	I really miss that music.
7806845	7808605	Really, really miss that.
7808685	7809886	I'm going to keep it for a while.
7811606	7814007	Anyway, my first FU of the week goes towards
7814622	7820348	People who go 15 miles under the speed limit, when I'm wanting to go 10 over it.
7821889	7824031	Damn them.
7825693	7834982	Also, it goes to the Safeway over on Madison, like, on the way here, for not carrying IM's cat food.
7835836	7836997	which is what I feed Shermie.
7838538	7842361	A big F you goes to cat food in general to having their first product be wheat.
7842901	7844462	Okay, what cat?
7845683	7849106	Have you ever seen a stray cat go up and want wheat?
7850207	7854150	No, they're going to go after the open can of tuna that's sitting around by the trash can.
7854990	7856712	They're going to go kill a bird or a squirrel.
7857732	7859794	Rob, have you ever known of any cats that go after wheat?
7861035	7861735	I can't say I have.
7862035	7863537	Have you ever met a vegetarian cat?
7863957	7864677	I can't say I have.
7864838	7865278	Okay then.
7868049	7874412	and Jeremy got really, really fat when I was feeding her the other kind of cat food that had meat.
7874892	7879074	And then I switched her over to cat food that had meat as the first product.
7879494	7881775	And lo and behold, she lost weight.
7881855	7886777	And by the way, cats eat grass because they can puke it back up and get stuff out of their system.
7887617	7889238	Okay, that's why cats eat grass.
7889458	7889838	Thank you.
7890518	7892459	And I kid you not, watch a cat.
7892659	7895261	They eat grass, then they hack it all back up.
7897382	7898862	Yeah, any animal will do that.
7899223	7900683	Let's go eat grass and throw it up.
7901204	7901364	Ew.
7902564	7904105	Let's go make mud pies, Jamie.
7904725	7907547	Yeah, okay.
7910188	7914510	Anyway, another F you goes toward a lack of money.
7915552	7940261	a lack of time, a big F you goes to distance, um, also, um, an F you goes towards stupid people, and I don't mean people who just don't understand, you know, people who, well, there's a, there's types of stupidity, the stupidity I'm referring to is lack of common sense, okay,
7940916	7949358	For the people who should not be involved in any part of the gene pool, these are the people that I would like removed from my universe.
7952299	7960461	Another F you goes toward myself for having all of these ideas for writing and just not being able to get them out of my head.
7960661	7962922	I hate writer's block with an unholy passion.
7963562	7964642	It's been driving me nuts.
7965502	7968523	So an F you to writer's block.
7969122	7971303	and Artist's Block, although I have started drawing again.
7971644	7975166	I'm doing a commission drawing right now.
7977007	7979789	Another FU goes toward my college.
7981130	7982871	But, okay, this is what I don't get.
7983091	7985032	And this may be a little bit technical for some people.
7986153	7996259	When you take out a student loan, if you're going for federal loans and you have to fill out your FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, so that your school will know how much...
7997074	8000136	Your family makes, or through an incentive, how much you make.
8000596	8007019	So I can understand that since they're doing a federal loan, they need to see how much you are going to be eligible for.
8007579	8012301	But why on earth do I need to fill out a FAFSA for a private loan?
8013282	8016143	I sort of see the reason behind it.
8016203	8017844	It's just a big pain in the ass right now.
8018504	8019965	So I've got to go out and...
8020782	8028627	I've done my FAFSA already, I just have to wait on the school to get my student aid report so I can get my award letter, so I can apply for the loan, so I can get my laptop.
8029327	8034831	I need a laptop because I'm going into database management.
8034891	8041074	And another FU goes toward being really homesick lately.
8041575	8048539	I just wanted to go back home for a little while and not have the money to do it in a little while.
8051070	8055673	and the rest of you guys for just being the busy time of year at work.
8056153	8056914	And that's about it.
8057794	8060356	But yeah, I'm really hungry.
8060836	8060976	Aw.
8062077	8062617	Alright then.
8063317	8063818	Moving on.
8064118	8065279	Loki, your turn.
8065539	8066900	What's pissing you off this week?
8068501	8070742	I forgot about this song.
8071883	8072003	Um.
8073984	8074644	Number one.
8075385	8077146	I don't really know.
8077186	8078987	It's like, it's been so long.
8079951	8083814	First off, of course, fuck you to the safe and sane fireworks.
8084214	8093100	They're really lame, and when you have a firework that lasts shorter, you know, the match lighting lasts longer than the actual firework.
8093720	8097142	I've had orgasms that lasted longer than some of those fireworks, seriously.
8098423	8100465	I mean, it's just like really pathetic.
8100525	8105608	You're like, wow, you know, lighting a candle would have been more exciting than those fireworks.
8106311	8111015	So, that really sucks, but luckily we know how to get our money out of safe and sane fireworks.
8111035	8112836	That's burning the packaging that they come in.
8114937	8116499	So, hooray.
8118680	8121763	Number two goes to the heat.
8122223	8122984	I don't like it.
8123344	8126846	It's been pretty hot.
8127147	8128848	I like it being nice and cool out.
8129168	8131510	You know, comfy Bay Area weather.
8132250	8133291	Don't like this dry heat.
8133851	8134111	Sucks.
8134872	8141237	Um, also, um... Just be glad that this is in the South where it's very humid.
8141457	8150144	Also, of course, you know, after seeing Fahrenheit 9-11 again, and, uh, fuck Bush just because, you know, he's stupid.
8151565	8157369	And, um... Really, I'm not that pissed off at stuff that much.
8157905	8160248	Fuck you, the retarded people on Final Fantasy XI.
8160448	8162210	I mean, there's some really dumb people out there.
8162290	8163511	I guess pretty much everyone.
8164192	8166014	There's a lot of dumb people everywhere.
8166914	8168876	I really hate dumb people and when you would kill them.
8169797	8173661	And fuck you, the goddamn DVR EX2 thing being broken again.
8173701	8176184	It's like, I can't fix that machine enough.
8176685	8180889	And that's why I have to be at the point to where I say, you know, fuck it, I don't care.
8181303	8191272	and once again, fuck you to Keith because that promise he made that I would get to dismantle the Beat Mania machine and take some of the parts for it because they were going to get rid of it anyways, well, he did it without me and threw the machine away.
8191492	8192152	So, fuck him.
8194494	8197797	And, um... Yeah, that's really all I have.
8198218	8199078	I'm just done.
8199759	8204083	I'm just... I don't know what the hell my PC, like, instantly restarted today.
8204523	8210446	Like, when Ranma was going to log out of Final Fantasy, just the whole PC restarted, so now I have to figure out what's wrong with that.
8210767	8212668	So all I did today was open the case up.
8212788	8219392	I touched nothing inside, opened the case up because I noticed there was a lot of dust on the outside, and I wanted to see how much it, you know, collected on the inside.
8219792	8224715	Opened it up, looked inside, closed case, done, and it goes and gets all fucked up, so...
8226255	8229996	Oh, and fuck you the cool web search for hijacking Internet Explorer.
8230977	8234678	Internet Explorer is completely useless for a while, so you know what?
8234698	8236178	That's why I'm using Firefox now.
8236298	8237679	Fuck you, Microsoft.
8238659	8239159	And I'm done.
8241540	8243260	Did you have something you wanted to add, Jamie?
8243280	8243481	Sorry.
8243641	8245421	I have something in mind, too.
8246221	8246561	Ugh.
8247602	8248602	Spammers can go to hell.
8250903	8251183	My turn.
8253804	8256065	An F you to having the hiccups for two weeks.
8256386	8257366	No, it wasn't that one.
8257386	8257886	Three days.
8260708	8262088	And that really sucked.
8262909	8266671	And an F you to my work wanting to send me away for two weeks.
8268852	8272154	My work wants to send me away for two weeks and thusly I'm going to miss all this cool stuff that was going on.
8272454	8275375	My friend that's in Iraq right now is going to be home and I'm going to be gone.
8276736	8277977	I was going to get tickets.
8278837	8280478	Well, back it up.
8280518	8282519	Shark Skrull was going to treat me to an Atlantis concert.
8283283	8285264	and I don't get to go to that now because I'm not going to be here.
8286465	8289566	I'll go.
8290106	8292047	And, yeah, so, sad.
8292507	8293128	What else was I going to miss?
8293148	8294888	There was something else big I'm missing, I forget.
8295028	8297670	I'm missing this show twice in a row, but, you know, you got to do what you got to do.
8299770	8303592	Real life sucks sometimes.
8303732	8310875	Also an F you to Golfland and Scandia together for helping make Sacramento Arcades a big fat joke.
8311196	8311896	I hate living here.
8313194	8315775	Actually, no, I really like living here, but as a gamer, it's pathetic.
8316275	8316616	Honestly.
8316696	8318637	There's no arcades in Sacramento.
8318797	8318997	None.
8320598	8321398	I miss the game room.
8321498	8322238	I miss it so much.
8322278	8323439	You know why I miss the game room?
8323899	8326240	Because they didn't have ticket machines at the game room.
8326500	8327481	That is why I miss them.
8328441	8330002	They were all about fighting games.
8331917	8335060	I would rather have the fighting game crowd than the birthday crowd, enough said.
8335140	8336081	And they had victory.
8337202	8337602	Yes, they did.
8337622	8339184	And they had pinball games too, which made me happy.
8339844	8340985	I just, I can't stand it.
8341346	8341806	I've had it.
8341906	8342627	I've had my limit.
8342967	8346731	I've reached my limit of putting up with kids and teenagers.
8347131	8349734	Fucking, like, 15, 16 year olds.
8349754	8352556	Like, I know a lot of 15, 16 year olds listen to this program.
8352916	8357621	And so I'm not, I'm not trying to be generalizing, but I'm talking about those kids that probably pick on you at school.
8358041	8360565	Well, those guys hang out at the arcade, too.
8361025	8362988	And they're such asses.
8363288	8365051	I mean, my God.
8365311	8368515	And F you to their parents for making them.
8369637	8371359	I wish you would have aborted those childs.
8372510	8374111	Rob, do what I do.
8374651	8375511	Have them thrown out.
8375691	8382094	Keith would be able to, you know, fix the problems at Golf Land if it weren't for the kids, like, ripping shit off the games.
8382654	8385475	You know, before it used to be ripping keys off the keyboard mania.
8385515	8386316	And changing diapers.
8386696	8387956	And changing diapers on them.
8388396	8390837	And now it's ripping the cymbals off the drums.
8391878	8393278	Or just chunks of the cymbals.
8393819	8397280	But Golf Land's defense, they did add a subway, and that makes me happy.
8400020	8401961	I don't fucking go there to eat Subway.
8402242	8406785	I go there to play DDR, not be harassed and get shit thrown at me.
8408846	8410367	There's no arcades in this town anymore.
8410387	8412989	Until I open my dream arcade.
8413129	8417432	If I feel like just going somewhere to be a bitch, I'll just go to Golf Land and have people thrown out.
8417452	8419974	Well, maybe we should just go there regularly and have people thrown out regularly.
8419994	8421075	That makes me feel better.
8421135	8423096	I think we should do it.
8424057	8425818	We could have like a squad name or something.
8427492	8428412	All right, let's move on.
8428452	8430633	The Arcade Protection Agency.
8431813	8432994	Got a small story about that.
8433474	8434634	It was really small.
8434855	8442137	There was, you know, our friend, Mr. Pirate Power, you know, that's in, I don't know, Toadie, I guess.
8443237	8445598	I want to get him on the show sometime because he's actually pretty funny.
8445638	8448459	I think he'd be pretty good for a guest on the show, but anyway.
8449119	8456082	Anyway, so he was down at Golf Land with Prestige and stuff there and some stupid kid came up and was acting like an ass and they scared him and he ran out.
8456382	8456862	That was funny.
8459383	8460363	I thought there was more to the story.
8460384	8463845	I thought you would have like how he was thrown out or what was said.
8466206	8469788	Puppy's volunteering to sign up for the Arcade Ejection Squad.
8472589	8473450	Anyway, moving on.
8474770	8477112	Yeah, AES, the Arcade Ejection Squad.
8477832	8478993	Fuck up, you outta here!
8479993	8481674	We should totally start a website.
8488874	8489735	I'm loving this idea.
8490736	8493579	We're going to single-handedly save this arcade scene in this town.
8493599	8494379	All right, moving on.
8494619	8498103	Well, we did once by putting all these pictures of the broken machines on.
8498623	8499364	That's very true.
8499384	8500925	We ought to do that again.
8501206	8501906	We ought to do that again.
8502587	8505370	But this time we should send them, like, the media and stuff.
8506871	8509794	Anyway, let's go to the chat room, FUs, shall we?
8511688	8521031	VxJasonXV says, one simple FU, FU to having a job and not yet actually working, thus not having income.
8522872	8525033	DDR Angel says, only one FU this week.
8525573	8531115	I like to say FU to one of my coworkers who thinks that he should control my schedule at work when he doesn't even have the authority to touch it.
8531615	8533676	If I'm scheduled until 10, leave it at 10.
8534076	8537057	I can't stay a half hour even if you wanted me to, so get over it.
8537397	8539178	At least I'll be out of that hellhole soon.
8539258	8539778	That is all.
8539858	8540278	Goodbye.
8541121	8542402	You know, she's moving up here pretty soon.
8542422	8542782	Yep.
8543382	8545923	She'll get out of the place she's in.
8546984	8549085	Then we'll hear more local FUs, anyway.
8550785	8559729	SharksGirl says, great, she says, FU to your work, my work, FU to Sky's work for making you go away so you miss our date.
8560450	8561790	I won't be able to put out for her.
8561870	8566632	I promised I would put out because she bought the tickets and everything, so.
8566732	8570374	She says she figures if nothing else, Mel's her default, but he just wouldn't appreciate it.
8571943	8574685	I'm sure Mel would accept the putting out, though, huh?
8574765	8575726	Jamie's raising her hand.
8575746	8577067	You should talk to Jamie.
8579449	8580610	Don't count me out yet, though.
8580650	8583372	The way my work works, I'll be... Just you wait.
8583592	8584853	I won't be gone until September.
8586514	8587815	Locke has two FUs.
8588555	8589916	One is a couple weeks old, and then the new one.
8590377	8593499	Number one is this girl named Lauren, who I thought everything was going well with.
8593539	8598943	After dating for a month, I got told that she was dating someone else by her best friend, and she wasn't going to even tell me.
8600404	8601025	So F you there.
8601045	8601085	Hi.
8602446	8603287	High school drama.
8604788	8606109	I don't even think he's in high school, though.
8606129	8607009	I think he's older than that.
8607569	8608030	I don't know.
8608050	8608350	I don't know.
8608370	8609491	I don't know the age of all our listeners.
8609591	8611612	It's drama.
8612553	8614654	We're in the old demographic here in studio.
8614694	8615995	That's the interesting part.
8616556	8621439	Locke also says, F you to people who cannot discuss politics without getting pissed off.
8622439	8628924	And also those who believe that you are not allowed to have an opinion yourself and unless you agree with them completely in politics, that they won't talk to you.
8631441	8633142	You know what?
8633162	8640065	Anything that anyone has a strong opinion about, they get all close-minded about.
8641105	8643226	Everyone has a right to an opinion, you know.
8648271	8653833	Flerone says, F you Dr. Atkins, if I hear low carb or Atkins friendly, I swear I will break my TV.
8653953	8661016	I mean, I bet half the people on Atkins who haven't read the books don't know that carb is short for carbohydrate or that fruits have them.
8662136	8665597	Also, I doubt many know that all the fucking heart problems Atkins had when he died.
8667178	8671199	Of course, that was debatable because they said he also died from falling or something.
8671259	8673480	No, the Atkins diet gives you gout.
8674659	8676240	I thought you were going to say gas.
8676420	8677180	No, it gives you gas.
8677220	8679101	But eating all that meat would give you a lot of gas.
8679161	8686284	It also gives you bad breath and affects your hormones and will eventually give you cancer.
8686324	8688665	Here, I have the miracle diet for you guys.
8688725	8690306	We're going to call it the Venata diet.
8690726	8692427	And I want to put this on all the packaging.
8692707	8696469	We're going to put this on all these packages, the Venata diet friendly thing.
8698130	8701091	Eat less, exercise more.
8701911	8702472	God.
8707096	8707957	It's worked for me.
8707977	8709397	It's hard work.
8710458	8712419	John Fields says, F you to my father.
8713379	8718081	And just so you know, when I say eat less, that doesn't mean you do the Mary-Kate Olsen thing and not eat at all.
8718481	8719882	You just eat less.
8720542	8723824	If you're eating a whole pie, eat half the pie.
8725625	8728886	Instead of not eating, do crack, just like the Olsen twins.
8729046	8732948	Because that's step two in Matt's great plan to get them naked.
8733775	8738657	No, it is, it is what you eat as much as how much of it you eat.
8739398	8742299	You know, just don't eat processed food.
8742859	8749962	Go cook a meal, you know, get some, some, you know, steak, cook it on your Foreman Grill.
8750623	8752604	Foreman Grill's awesome, you know.
8753644	8757606	It's a matter of just eating real food.
8758846	8760067	Look, I guarantee you.
8761556	8770118	I challenge everybody, okay, for one week, you know, go grocery shopping and try and don't buy anything that has high-fructose corn syrup in it.
8770858	8771599	Try doing it for a week.
8772039	8779641	I guarantee you, everything that you normally get, or most of everything that you get, has that as either a primary or at least a middle ingredient on it.
8782341	8782841	Okay, I'm done.
8783142	8783502	That's all right.
8783702	8784562	Back to John Peel's FU.
8784582	8784682	Yeah.
8785575	8791178	FU to my father, fuck having to get a job, fuck having to pay $500 for a tiny scratch on a bumper that happened in an accident.
8791218	8793339	My life worth is now down to only $1,000.
8793379	8797161	Hey, that's more than I've got today.
8798401	8798882	Moving on.
8800002	8807406	EvilMaliki2DX says, FU goes to idiot tourists on July 4th who thought that standing and blocking my view was going to give them a better view of the fireworks.
8808035	8811278	Oh, and F you to Fog for blocking out the fireworks in the first place.
8811798	8815381	And F you to idiot drivers trying to run me over on my way back to the BART station.
8815981	8818864	Oh, and F you to the idiot drunk driver that took Satoshi's life.
8824328	8831951	Spaceboy says, neighbor kids suck, they touch your drums, then you tell them not to, and then tell their soccer mom.
8832211	8834493	Then they come back and taunt you, then they get you in trouble.
8835453	8838574	I want to throw them off my house headfirst.
8841816	8847739	Misty says, this one goes to myself, because I lost my wallet and all the important shit that I was stupid enough to keep in there.
8848763	8851686	I only hope I can find it in the landfill that is my room.
8852326	8853607	I like how she calls it in the landfill.
8854128	8858131	And lastly, Mel B of RTF has an FU.
8858712	8862055	He says, FU to Richard Earl Sevitz.
8862655	8866319	Thanks a whole freaking lot for taking the lives of a local DDR and his mom.
8866559	8868801	I'm sure drinking before taking the wheel was worth it.
8869361	8870062	You worthless fuck.
8872554	8873555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8902796	8905098	We always have a backup plan for how we're all going to get home.
8905278	8906599	The fact that two of us live here helps.
8907599	8910902	I had you pick me up to bring me here and I had Dan take me home.
8911042	8911482	Exactly.
8911782	8917786	I mean, you know, if only everybody could be smart, then we wouldn't have this bullshit happening.
8918027	8918547	And that's what it is.
8918627	8919147	It's bullshit.
8920108	8920548	Shouldn't happen.
8922330	8923450	That is really sad.
8923530	8924391	I didn't hear about that.
8924411	8926432	They just better nail this guy's ass to the wall.
8926673	8927413	That's all I have to say.
8928474	8930755	I'm almost positive he died too, but I'm not sure.
8930876	8931336	I'm not sure.
8934861	8938923	But if you want to get into some more Black Ops stuff, Maker of the Alcohol, Konami.
8947608	8957954	I just have this thing, though, about the drunk drivers who live, that I am sort of glad that they live for one reason, because dead people can't suffer.
8958594	8959535	You can't make them suffer.
8960151	8961492	That's a lot of guilt to have.
8961993	8964676	That's not even the guilt that I care about.
8964876	8968199	I care about sitting them down and making them suffer repeatedly.
8969000	8973445	I don't think a lot of drunk drivers are necessarily bad people.
8973725	8975367	It doesn't matter.
8975987	8976588	No, I know, I know.
8976848	8977369	It doesn't matter.
8977749	8980412	They made a really horrible, bad...
8981030	8981450	Ignorant.
8981570	8982671	It's an ignorant decision.
8982691	8983632	They're ignorant people.
8983652	8987034	I think that they need to be punished for it for the rest of their life.
8987694	9001823	Whether they punish themselves or, you know, I think that if you are involved in a drunk driving accident and you were the drunk driver, you need to, for the rest of your life, have your driving privileges revoked.
9003004	9004025	For the rest of your life.
9004905	9008107	I don't care how goddamn inconvenient it makes it on you, you do not deserve to drive.
9008127	9008868	Take the bus!
9009468	9010149	That's what it's for!
9011448	9015089	More people should take the bus anyway, not that I should talk, because I drive, but you know.
9018131	9021512	Actually, I do have another... If I lived in a big city, I would take the subway.
9021732	9021912	Yes?
9022272	9023833	I actually do have another F you, by the way.
9023853	9024974	Yes, DarkSakura?
9025814	9030756	I have an F you to the emissions commercials that they have on the radio here.
9031716	9038379	Because I normally listen to the radio, but I have a big F you to the emissions one, saying that, you know, drive your car less.
9040003	9044026	Do you know who the cause of the emissions problem is in this state?
9044446	9045627	It's freaking industry.
9046628	9053153	You know, car emissions are negligible in comparison to these unregulated factories that we have floating around.
9053753	9055435	So, you know what all that is?
9056576	9058757	It's my whole theory on how government works.
9059318	9059598	Okay?
9059618	9059698	Okay.
9060600	9061100	It's money.
9061240	9061980	It's lobbyists.
9063901	9065522	We are run by corporations.
9066202	9069383	And it's these corporations that control what legislature gets passed.
9070563	9071364	So, anyway.
9072264	9075645	We had one more FU come in to kind of try and bring the mood back up here a little bit.
9076365	9086749	DDArcoholic says, FU to Comcast for deleting our connection to Japan TV because it was a mistake and finding out that to get it back it costs $24 a month just for that one channel.
9087649	9089290	I guess that means we probably lost it too.
9089330	9089930	That makes me sad.
9091269	9092750	I know, but that still makes me sad.
9092790	9093611	It was a cool network.
9094652	9094952	Oh well.
9096113	9096613	What can you do?
9096993	9102837	I think that's the station that plays a lot of the current Dorama series that come on too.
9102857	9103038	Yep.
9103538	9104238	I'm almost positive it is.
9104258	9106180	I was watching one in Berkeley that was called Sakura.
9108982	9109262	Oh well.
9110343	9112785	Okay, so what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.
9113585	9118549	When we come back, what we're going to do, we will do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9118629	9120030	And I also want to show something off.
9121328	9127292	This computer upgrade has helped us be capable of doing something else here on the show that we will be incorporating in the show in the future.
9128152	9129913	But we're going to kind of try it out tonight.
9130434	9132015	I'm going to show it to you guys when we come back.
9133055	9133856	Excuse me for this break.
9134474	9135115	Ask Orange Lounge
9396243	9397823	Baby, it's all in gold
9519710	9528332	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
9534673	9538234	Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.
9539774	9542255	We're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in just a moment.
9542810	9546353	But first I want to show off a new feature that we're going to have very soon on the show.
9546533	9551216	I'm just trying to think of ways to implement this in a non-trainwreck sort of way.
9551717	9553658	Oh yes, I hear a phone ringing.
9556100	9556560	Hello?
9556580	9558421	Hello, Orange Lounge?
9558682	9559002	Yes.
9559662	9560543	I just have one question.
9561364	9561664	Yes.
9562324	9563085	Can you hear me now?
9563585	9564846	Yes, I can hear you now.
9564966	9565507	Who is this?
9566207	9567028	This is Jason.
9567268	9569850	Hi, is this TVX JasonXV?
9570697	9573240	You would be correct, sir.
9575222	9576083	Oh, how you doing?
9577385	9578606	I'm doing pretty good.
9578787	9579267	That's good.
9579327	9580609	This is exciting, isn't it?
9581290	9582471	Now we can talk to our listeners.
9583052	9584313	Sounds nice and smooth to me.
9584413	9587417	Just so you know, this is not a regular phone connection, is it?
9588594	9590476	No, this is actually a digital connection.
9590636	9592758	Yes, this is an all-digital secure connection.
9592798	9594500	We're using a program called Skype.
9594880	9596641	You can download it at Skype.org.
9596701	9597742	It's completely free.
9597762	9598843	You should spell it for everybody.
9599063	9600625	S-K-Y-P-E.
9601726	9605229	And when we get this running, which we will soon, you'll be able to call us.
9605669	9613796	If you have a broadband connection, unfortunately those of you with a modem connection, it's going to be too much for your connections, you're not going to be able to do it, but if you have a broadband connection, you will be able to interact with us.
9613936	9622364	And we're not sure in what capacity yet, we're probably going to have to control it somehow, but you will be able to call the show, and it'll be fun.
9622704	9624666	And Jamie can yell at you in person, which will be great.
9625246	9627368	And know your phone bill has nothing to do with this.
9627782	9630204	Yeah, this is not an actual phone line.
9630304	9634687	This is the same thing as sending an IM to somebody just verbally.
9634787	9635607	This is voice chat.
9635707	9636888	It's just a voice chat program on that.
9636928	9638049	It's like Xbox Live.
9639270	9642892	Except there's not people on it going, you know, Bitch, bitch, bitch, your mom, your mom.
9643633	9644913	You're a controller cheater.
9645093	9646054	You're a controller cheater.
9646074	9646594	You're lame.
9647335	9651057	You know what's going to be cool is when they come out with iToyChat.
9652258	9653339	I'm still waiting for that.
9653951	9656814	It's coming, it's coming, so soon enough we'll have that.
9657194	9659576	And then we'll be able to see your ugly mugs at the same time.
9662458	9664660	Yeah, we'll definitely have to do something with iToyChat in the future.
9664680	9666442	Jason needs to come back out and hang out with us again.
9668123	9669704	I have an excellent... Hold on!
9669925	9670465	Wait, stop!
9670585	9671186	Stop the show!
9671546	9672567	I have an excellent idea.
9672807	9675850	We could broadcast all of our shows over iToyChat.
9677251	9677391	No.
9678539	9679199	Oh, come on.
9679440	9681581	I think there's moderators on iToyChat.
9681601	9682781	We'd probably get banned.
9684442	9684803	We'll see.
9684843	9685583	We'll see when it comes out.
9686844	9687064	All right.
9687084	9689605	Well, thanks for calling, Jason, and helping us show off this new toy.
9690266	9690506	Thank you.
9690526	9692287	And thank you for filling in for the show last week.
9692307	9693047	That was very nice of you.
9693687	9695628	It was very fun once I actually got underway.
9695649	9696609	When are you going to do your own show?
9697650	9699971	As soon as I actually have a definitive schedule.
9700351	9700871	Sounds good to me.
9701792	9701992	Yes.
9702272	9702552	All right.
9702572	9703293	You have a good one, Jason.
9703313	9703833	Thanks for calling.
9704293	9704894	Goodbye, sir.
9705034	9705254	Later.
9705514	9705894	Bye.
9706615	9706895	All right.
9706915	9707315	That was fun.
9708305	9712227	That's going to be a fun program to start using when we figure out how to do it.
9712267	9714308	But get on board right now.
9715128	9717609	Skype.org.
9718169	9720630	Oh, people are posting the link in the chat room.
9721531	9725812	We're going to get a user account made just for Orange Lounge and figure something out.
9725993	9727093	You did make one a while back, didn't you?
9727833	9728153	Yes, Amy.
9728594	9731615	I just wanted to make a quick statement.
9732051	9733932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9759389	9759849	Let's see.
9759869	9763632	Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.
9763652	9765133	I'm trying to find my Ask Orange Lounge music.
9765594	9768776	Now that we can actually do the music on beat, I can't find the damn music.
9769337	9769777	It's horrible.
9771038	9771418	Found it.
9771518	9771899	Here we go.
9772619	9778244	We're going to answer some questions that were sent to us by you for any of our hosts.
9778284	9779645	You can ask us anything you want.
9779685	9780245	What's on your mind?
9780265	9781166	What do you want us to talk about?
9781206	9781646	Here we go.
9787911	9789072	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
9789682	9790762	Some stupid question.
9791303	9794544	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9795364	9796385	I don't know what we'll learn.
9796825	9798225	The questions are probably pretty dumb.
9798706	9802067	But all I know is I feel great because now I can sing in sync.
9805608	9808390	That sounded profane.
9809170	9810550	Number one question!
9811651	9815993	EvilNauki2DX, when is the next time you'll be in San Francisco?
9816053	9817933	It's been over a year since I last seen you guys.
9818334	9819274	When do you pay for the trip?
9821326	9827131	Actually, I want to go to Dave & Buster's in Mopita, so I know it's not San Francisco, but I really want to go to DMV's again.
9827171	9827811	Oh my god, I want to.
9828332	9834516	A certain host has a certain birthday coming up with a certain power crash anniversary.
9834536	9837038	You know, that's like six weeks away.
9837098	9837739	I want to go now.
9838099	9840221	I want to go when I get back from East Coast.
9842442	9844884	We should celebrate the return of Rob with booze.
9844904	9845004	Booze.
9847024	9850187	I want a going away party and a coming back party.
9851067	9855851	What was that game that you played with the really gay name?
9857071	9859213	It was right behind our table on my birthday.
9860094	9860874	Flaming Fingers.
9860954	9862195	Yeah, that was great.
9863116	9863776	Alright, moving on.
9864437	9865557	You should win on that again.
9866098	9871061	Oh my god, Dave and Busters is having an I Love the 90s viewing party all this week, says Shark Skrull.
9871141	9871822	We need to go.
9871862	9872462	What a cool...
9875000	9876102	Dead Air, fun.
9876202	9879727	I was just sending a private message to a buddy.
9889673	9892295	John Fields says, I know this really isn't Bimani.
9892395	9892736	Oh, I'm sorry.
9892976	9893937	Number two question.
9894718	9899682	I know this isn't really Bimani related anyway, but did you see the end of season two of Red vs. Blue?
9899782	9901263	And if you did, what did you think of it?
9901464	9902765	I need to go watch those.
9902785	9905427	I haven't watched anything since the last season of Red vs. Blue.
9907849	9910612	Red vs. Blue is awesome.
9910632	9911072	What is it?
9911232	9911893	I don't even know.
9912213	9914035	It's these funny movies that they did.
9915830	9916891	Using the Halo engine.
9917731	9918852	Oh, I have heard of that.
9919032	9919813	They're great.
9919853	9920993	I've got the first DVD.
9922854	9923034	Oh.
9923054	9924935	So she can just download all of them off the internet.
9924955	9927217	Didn't Microsoft start actually paying them to do it?
9927297	9929158	Yeah, they thought it was awesome.
9929218	9929978	It's really cool.
9930018	9938023	If you go into GameStop, their Xbox demos, the little cut scenes in between are the red versus blue guys.
9938826	9939286	Interesting.
9939827	9944109	Maybe we should talk more good things about Xbox and they'll hire us to do, you know, something.
9944690	9946571	DDR Ultramix is great.
9946611	9949233	You should go buy an Xbox today and play it.
9949273	9949973	It's so much fun.
9950033	9954296	I wish everybody listening could see the expression on your face.
9955777	9956918	You look constipated.
9958519	9958959	It's great.
9960800	9961981	Number three question.
9964110	9968513	Flairone wants to know, you guys always make a bunch of general comments about your work.
9968634	9970595	Where do you guys work exactly?
9970935	9971756	I'm not telling.
9971996	9975839	We're not going to tell exactly where we work, but we can tell what kind of work we do.
9976279	9977661	I work for a student loan lender.
9978681	9980022	A very big student loan lender.
9980943	9985006	Owned by a very big bank.
9985907	9988549	I'm a corporate trainer for a very large health insurance company.
9990378	9991879	Not very large, but somewhat big.
9992019	9994100	I work in customer service.
9994741	9996482	It's big in this state, but probably not where you live.
9996982	9997462	Uh, Loki.
9997802	9998303	Wait, one thing.
9998823	9999023	Yes.
9999403	10001124	Yes, I am that phone voice.
10004926	10007688	I sit and read the internet.
10009749	10010649	That's all I do.
10010829	10011830	He's a jizz mopper.
10012530	10013811	I am not a jizz mopper.
10014011	10015812	I talk to stupid people.
10016596	10022459	Mostly stupid people in the Midwest because they're extraordinarily stupid.
10022979	10025161	Especially the people that work at video stores there.
10026261	10027502	God, they're so stupid.
10028823	10029863	Yeah.
10032685	10035486	Anyways, yeah, I work in the video industry.
10036487	10037887	The movie industry.
10038348	10039288	I get free movies.
10040449	10042490	To answer John Fields real quick.
10042670	10042830	Mm-hmm.
10043985	10048187	The federal government doesn't freaking care where you work.
10049107	10052948	You still have to fill out your FAFSA to get your student loans.
10053088	10055749	Even if you work for the IRS, you still have to pay your taxes every year.
10055969	10056310	Exactly.
10056330	10056750	Believe it or not.
10058170	10058891	Damn it, I know.
10059251	10067554	And I'm going to be taking out my student loans through where I work because I'll, you know, not necessarily that I'll get a better deal on it, it's just I simply know how the processes are.
10068134	10069975	You can go in there and tweak your account.
10070035	10072136	No, I wouldn't do that.
10072356	10073256	But you still...
10075399	10083406	The FAFSA, if you've never done your own FAFSA, I recommend do it because it asks for all of this information.
10083907	10086049	It looks for the crap on your income taxes.
10086089	10087450	It doesn't give a shit where you work.
10088171	10089492	It just asks how much money you made.
10092355	10092855	And that is all.
10093747	10107891	Alright Next question Next question Number four question Also from Flareon A Also, with that one promo where if you don't listen to Orange Lounge too often you get killed by an assassin through the computer Does it say seven days at the end?
10107971	10112213	Yes, it does Yes If so, is that in reference to the crappy UPN series from years ago?
10112333	10116814	No, it's The Ring Yeah, you need to rent The Ring Oh my god, you haven't seen that?
10116854	10122676	That movie is so awesome I didn't see it until it came out on video Have you seen the Japanese one?
10123894	10124735	I've not seen Ringu.
10124775	10125675	I heard it's not as good.
10126316	10128418	Well, no, it's a different type of movie.
10128978	10129438	The U.S.
10129538	10131140	one is more for scare.
10131900	10133722	The Japanese one is more suspense.
10135483	10138546	And it also brings in this whole stupid psychic thing with it.
10139146	10140347	But the book is really good.
10140647	10141468	The book is really good.
10142329	10142589	Anyway.
10144210	10146912	I had this whole big fandom for The Ring going on for a while.
10148153	10148413	Okay.
10151216	10151896	Let's see.
10151996	10152677	Moving on.
10153936	10154957	Damn, I thought that was a question.
10155357	10155737	Oh, here we go.
10155777	10158119	Number five question from Jason.
10158879	10161441	Which new consumer style do you want to see first?
10162582	10170347	Gita Dora 5 and 4, Poppin' 10, 2DX8, or a new DDR?
10171828	10172888	I'd have to say in order.
10173629	10180213	I really want 2DX8, and then Gita Dora 5-4, and then Poppin'.
10181263	10190986	Just because I, you know, well, I didn't buy Poppin' 9, which I probably should have, but Dan has just been going off wanting new Guitar Freaks Drum Mania.
10191486	10197928	And I have two Guitar Freaks controllers and a Drum Mania controller collecting dust in my house.
10199689	10207511	I actually put a new DDR at the top of my list, and then I would say 2DX8, Poppin' 10, Guitador 5-4.
10207611	10209992	I don't really collect the Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania at home.
10210032	10211052	I think it's good for other people
10211522	10212623	I really want them all to come out.
10213263	10213824	So we'll see.
10213884	10214945	But I want a new DDR.
10215005	10216366	I want a new Keyboard Mania.
10219048	10219809	That's what I want.
10220289	10221350	And another Pada Pada.
10225533	10225813	Alright.
10227014	10227275	Sorry.
10227295	10229196	I'm trying to get set up on something here.
10229796	10230677	Puppy has a question.
10230697	10231438	Number six question.
10232833	10236455	Would you believe that my little brother got a job working at a TapX in my hometown?
10236575	10237116	Because he did.
10237376	10239237	Those things are starting to pop up everywhere.
10239437	10240358	They seriously are.
10240518	10242299	I wish one would open up near here.
10243460	10247843	I went to the TapX down off of Sutterville.
10248904	10250405	And they are really nice.
10250445	10253206	They have a big widescreen TV and they let you change the channels on it.
10254267	10256449	And then they have a PlayStation hooked up to it.
10257049	10258050	A PS2 hooked up to it.
10258090	10259410	So you can play whatever games they have there.
10259651	10260491	I actually saw that.
10260571	10261472	They have iToy Groove.
10262316	10268098	and if you pay $5 a month, you can use their broadband service.
10268979	10269319	Oh, that's cool.
10269339	10270179	They'll give you broadband.
10271560	10272980	Wireless broadband, too, if you have a laptop.
10274381	10274761	Pretty good, huh?
10274801	10275901	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
10277502	10277902	Okay.
10280623	10282644	Actually, I think we'll go ahead and we'll try and do this.
10293308	10294869	Sorry about that guys, we dropped for just a second there.
10294889	10296870	We didn't drop, but our sound went out for a second there.
10296890	10298492	Because I'm actually trying to set Skype back up.
10299052	10301834	If you guys want to contact us on Skype, we'll open up the Skype lines.
10301854	10303355	We'll take one call before the end of the show.
10303655	10305376	Anything you want to talk about in regards to tonight's show.
10305917	10308218	Username, Orange Lounge Radio.
10308358	10311160	All one word, Orange Lounge Radio.
10312861	10319085	And by the way, in answer to John Fields, it is $5 a month to use the broadband at their TapX.
10321069	10325030	We did get another question real fast while we wait for a call to come through on the skyline.
10325591	10328332	Black Lab wants to know, what is favorite Pokemon of you?
10331113	10331953	Number seven question.
10333534	10335494	I used to like Togepi a whole lot.
10338115	10340876	But I liked Porygon because it made all the children have seizures.
10343137	10344538	Jigglypuff was my favorite.
10345078	10345618	Absolutely.
10349560	10349700	Um...
10350888	10357893	Man, uh... My favorite would have to be... Heart Attack Squirrel.
10361975	10366999	I liked in Evangelion Redeath how they had the giant, real, geek Pikachu battle.
10367579	10368820	And then Fanboy Bebop.
10368980	10369480	Penis!
10371422	10377426	There's a fan animation that somebody did that instead of Pikachu was Fuckachu.
10379367	10379467	And...
10381543	10383504	It's actually about the human Pokemon, though.
10383564	10385645	But I have to get it from my friend and show it to you.
10385685	10386205	It's really funny.
10386945	10391007	I need to see ReDeath and Fanboy Bebop again.
10391327	10392748	I need to get a copy of Nescaflowne.
10393008	10396429	I can't understand why these movies have not made their way onto the internet.
10396549	10397729	Nescaflowne, yes.
10397809	10398570	Nescaflowne.
10399190	10400370	Well, I've got Fanboy Bebop.
10401151	10401531	Cool.
10401951	10403692	That movie is awesome.
10404792	10406893	I also have the cutscenes from Fanboy Bebop, too.
10407673	10409254	With the It's Gendo scene.
10410701	10411461	Didn't they play those?
10411502	10414043	I thought they played those at the very end, like after the credits.
10414423	10414843	Yeah.
10415844	10418465	I'll have to find my tape.
10418485	10422947	And I did have Jubei Powers, Japanese Man of Intercourse.
10423467	10424347	I hated that.
10425288	10426448	It had funny scenes.
10426548	10428569	They need to make a Gendo movie.
10429470	10431731	It's Gendo the movie.
10432431	10434092	Did you hear what I snuck in on the pre-show?
10434112	10434152	No.
10435094	10435975	The Misato.
10436715	10438176	I have two bestestes.
10438896	10440917	Not one, but two.
10441317	10449302	I swear they changed the dialogue in that because I thought there was one that was like a part that said shut up Shinzi and then they changed it to no.
10451643	10454804	No, it looks like that as far as I've seen it because I saw it at Faname when they played it.
10456785	10457046	Oh well.
10458326	10459567	Nobody likes us, oh well.
10461032	10467115	I don't think enough people have gotten Skype yet because we just said it like 10 minutes ago we're going to be using this and I don't think a lot of people even have this program yet.
10467135	10468435	I have another parody you might like.
10468655	10469616	But we'll see what happens, huh?
10470116	10471577	Voltron hellbent for leather.
10473438	10473838	What?
10476379	10478920	It's really old but I'll have to copy it for you.
10481441	10482982	Guys are crazy.
10486966	10490547	Alright, we got some people saying they're going to call in, they're trying to install the program now.
10490587	10497229	We've only got time to take like one or two calls, so if you don't get through this week, definitely we can do... Do we have any more waiting for us via private message?
10497269	10500591	We don't have any other questions waiting private message, so I'm just kind of... I have a message.
10500951	10501171	Yes.
10501471	10502891	Why are we so damn cool?
10505772	10507333	Haven't you missed doing the show, though?
10509013	10512335	Yes, I've missed... No, finally, we're getting a damn call.
10512355	10513355	Let's see, I don't even know...
10521892	10523513	I don't even know how to answer the damn call.
10523574	10524634	It's not coming up on the screen.
10525375	10527376	I think I just hung up on whoever was calling.
10527857	10528577	We're sorry.
10528837	10535522	I need to actually change something here on my options real fast because it's trying to... Holy crap, it's Zaku.
10537023	10543388	I'm trying to have it not switch... No, I'm trying to make sure it doesn't switch...
10544636	10554082	Hold on, I'm actually going to disable calls for a second because I don't want people to call just yet because what it's doing, it's switching our input, which is fucking up our thing going out.
10554282	10555263	Hold on, I'll fix it.
10555783	10556503	Sorry, guys.
10556704	10558525	Jamie, help me fill time.
10559906	10560646	Fill time.
10560846	10563248	Well, I could rant.
10564108	10564188	Sure.
10564208	10565389	Or we could listen to the ferrets.
10568746	10569666	Okay, I got it fixed.
10569686	10570447	We can take a call now.
10570527	10572067	I knew the ferret would get you motivated.
10572087	10575828	For some reason, the last person that called, I did not get the answer button when you called.
10575928	10578109	So make sure we're on your buddy list, I guess.
10578609	10579409	Maybe, I don't know.
10581970	10582730	Oh, maybe you did.
10583551	10584211	Let's see if I can do it.
10585411	10586452	Okay, we're getting a call now.
10587972	10588712	I can't answer it.
10590713	10591573	It's not letting me answer it.
10594534	10596255	Okay, let me see if I can change it from friends only.
10596595	10596935	There we go.
10597659	10598539	There, I got it.
10598640	10598960	Hello?
10601241	10601621	Hello?
10602061	10602822	You're on Orange Lounge?
10603622	10603942	Yes.
10604163	10604663	Who is this?
10605743	10607144	It's EvilNaoki2DX.
10607344	10608785	Hello, EvilNaoki2DX!
10608985	10610186	Naoki, whatever.
10610566	10611086	How you doing?
10611727	10612267	I'm alright.
10612287	10613968	It's my Ototo-chan.
10614908	10615829	Hi, Onitan.
10616449	10616969	How are you?
10618550	10618730	Eh.
10620291	10621132	How am I ever?
10623333	10627195	Is there anything you wanted to say about tonight's show or a comment on anything we've talked about tonight?
10627745	10630047	Well, I mean, you guys got the Skype thing up.
10630747	10636051	I can tell by my Winamp, it's kind of lagging behind, so it's starting to confuse me, so I put it on mute real quick.
10636131	10637232	Yeah, you're going to have to do that.
10637452	10645398	Folks, when you do call in to the station, make sure you put your Winamp down, because there is about a 30-second delay between us talking to you and then, just like real radio.
10646859	10647760	Except we don't dump the F1.
10647780	10649541	Hello to DarklineXDI as well.
10649561	10652964	I just want to say, well, what's up, and...
10654164	10659545	Hopefully I will come up to Sacramento one day soon and actually be on the show live.
10660345	10661925	Definitely, you've got to come be on the show live sometime.
10662626	10663806	Yes, yes, definitely.
10664066	10664866	Any shoutouts?
10665086	10668567	Any TRL style Carson Daly blessed shoutouts you want to give?
10670047	10677908	Just to Angel and DarkLineXPI and anyone else who wants a shoutout, here's my shoutout.
10678968	10679769	That's very kind of you.
10680449	10681649	Oh, and Rob?
10681669	10681729	Yes?
10681929	10682149	Yes.
10682904	10686427	When are you coming to my house in a French maid outfit?
10686687	10689650	You promised me back at Replicon.
10689790	10693974	When I can afford a French maid outfit, I will come in my French maid outfit.
10694694	10695515	Oh, you're so kind.
10695735	10695995	I know.
10696136	10698398	All right, I'm going to let you go so we can take one more call before we leave.
10698418	10698658	Okay.
10698858	10699378	All right, take care, bud.
10699398	10700059	All right, see you guys later.
10700179	10700620	Thanks, bye.
10701300	10706204	Okay, if anybody else wants to call in, any comment on any of tonight's topics, Skype line is open for you guys.
10706284	10707886	Username, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10708840	10711342	SKYPE.org is the program you've got to get.
10711382	10714624	Brand new thing we're rolling out tonight, the Skype line.
10714724	10716585	So we'll wait and see if anybody else wants to give us a call.
10716605	10718246	That just sounds cool, the Skype line.
10718366	10718666	I know.
10719406	10722829	It should be like 1-900-HOT-SKYPE.
10723869	10724470	I think it's very smart.
10724490	10729032	You know what's kind of neat about this is supposedly we can dial out too using this thing.
10729072	10730613	But I don't know how well that works.
10731314	10733155	We could try calling my cell phone and see what happens.
10735296	10736037	We're getting a call.
10736057	10736337	Hold on.
10738004	10738885	Orange Lounge Radio.
10739926	10741848	Hello, it's me, DarkLineXPI.
10741908	10742629	Turn down your wind amp.
10744250	10745071	Oh, hold on.
10745311	10745732	That's right.
10748835	10749836	Okay, it's down now.
10749956	10750316	Alright.
10750837	10753019	You sound like you're calling us from a glass jar.
10754721	10758945	He's hanging out with the tin can lady from Solo.
10759966	10760927	I guess it's just my mic.
10761934	10762454	It's all good.
10762954	10765395	You guys will have plenty of time to play around with settings.
10765815	10766156	What's up?
10766196	10766776	What's on your mind?
10766796	10767756	What did you think of tonight's show?
10767796	10768697	Any comments on anything?
10768717	10770077	Well, it's really good, actually.
10771177	10771998	When aren't we good?
10772078	10772758	Damn, we're good.
10772978	10773978	We are so hot.
10774699	10777640	We could do TRL on Originals Radio.
10778260	10778700	Indeed.
10779460	10781121	I don't know if we would want to, but we could.
10782642	10784962	What's better than real radio?
10785943	10787563	How can I get multiple calls there?
10787583	10788064	That was weird.
10789815	10794678	I'm going to have to play with the settings myself on this, and everything's still in beta, so we'll figure it out.
10794738	10795599	Anything else you wanted to say?
10795639	10796239	Any shout-outs?
10797200	10803885	Well, I would like to make a shout-out to Rich, EvilNaoki2DX, and all of the 2DX community here in Vegas.
10805346	10805866	Oh, Vegas!
10805926	10807267	I've got to go back to Vegas someday.
10807607	10809389	Yeah, when are you coming to Vegas?
10809569	10810429	I miss gambling.
10810649	10811970	We need to see Mara and Chun.
10812291	10814492	Yeah, there's a lot of folks that listen to Vegas.
10814532	10815373	When are you guys coming to Vegas?
10815393	10817514	I need to go to the Adult Entertainment Expo.
10818095	10818515	Ha ha ha!
10819537	10821838	Yeah, we'll be down there for Adult Entertainment Expo sometime.
10822239	10825941	Yeah, but we won't be there for Classic Gaming Expo because they moved that to San Jose.
10826821	10828882	Yeah, oh, I definitely want to go to Classic Gaming Expo this year.
10828942	10829303	Oh, yeah.
10829383	10829683	We'll see.
10830023	10831204	Alright, we're going to have to let you go.
10831264	10832044	You know what, though?
10832204	10837267	I just realized that you sent me that story about the American Idol style thing they're doing.
10837627	10838708	Oh, yeah, I sent you that.
10838788	10840449	And I totally forgot to bring it up tonight.
10840489	10842110	I'll send it to Jamie to talk about next week.
10842190	10843331	By the way, it's already gone.
10844111	10844571	Oh, is it?
10845472	10845712	Yeah.
10845872	10847073	Well... They don't have the links.
10847373	10847893	That sucks.
10848153	10849214	Alright, well, it was worth a try.
10851189	10852291	Alright, thanks for calling in, dude.
10852812	10853794	Yeah, my pleasure.
10854255	10854635	Bye.
10854776	10855076	Bye.
10855798	10857380	See, this is pretty cool now that we can take calls.
10857841	10858402	I'm liking this.
10859785	10860927	Alright, that's it.
10860967	10862951	We're going to have to go ahead and close the Skype line for tonight.
10865236	10866336	I'm still trying to implement this.
10866356	10866896	I'm doing DarkSakura email.
10893712	10894172	We'll see what happens.
10894212	10895193	Just wanted to make a mention.
10920106	10921927	Okay, I guess that's it.
10922567	10923007	We're done.
10923927	10924948	Oh, God, final thoughts.
10925188	10926088	Jamie, your final thought.
10931550	10934090	My final thought is Skype line.
10934731	10936791	That sounds so hot, Rob.
10937812	10938612	Loki's not here.
10938712	10940192	Loki's final thought is potty.
10940412	10942573	Yeah, Loki's final thought is potty.
10943633	10946694	And the final word of the show, I guess I'll have to give it to Jamie.
10946714	10947775	There's really no one else here.
10952153	10955134	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10955694	10959036	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

10978144	10981065	And now, today's Ebonics Language Lesson.
10981972	10982713	Meeting girls.
10983493	10985394	My, you're a lovely young lady.
10986115	10987776	Damn, you's a fine mother******.
10988756	10990798	Damn, you's a fine mother******.
10992179	10993820	Let's go for a ride, shall we?
10994440	10997222	Hey, baby, jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.
10997882	11001885	Hey, baby, let's jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.
11002946	11003826	You are beautiful.
11004286	11005627	I would like to make love to you.
11006348	11008289	Damn, bitch, you stupid fly.
11008749	11011171	Let me pull up to that bumper and smack that monkey.
11011809	11013711	Damn bitch, you stupid fly.
11014111	11016673	Let me pull up to your bumper and smack that monkey.
11017554	11018675	Greeting old friends.
11019435	11020036	Hello, sir.
11020737	11022098	What up, dog?
11022918	11024440	What up, dog?
11025681	11026982	May I borrow some money?
11027642	11028943	Hey, let me hold some ends.
11029024	11030785	I'll hit you back on the first, my brother.
11031325	11032747	Hey, let me hold some ends.
11032947	11035249	I will hit you back on the first, my brother.
11036570	11037250	You don't have it?
11037691	11038471	Thanks anyway.
11039312	11040053	F*** you!
11042844	11043845	Making new friends.
11044466	11045086	Hello, sir.
11045707	11046227	What up?
11046928	11047388	What up?
11048749	11051191	I admire your fashionable running shoes.
11051812	11055254	Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherfucker.
11055875	11059918	Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherfucker.
11060819	11063381	I used to be a stuck-up white boy faking the funk.
11063821	11064442	Bump that.
11065082	11070887	I ain't bullshitting on Front Street no more thanks to the Wake Up Crew's Ebonics language lesson.
11072236	11080582	Available in a hood near you Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
11116874	11117735	All right, we're back.
11117835	11119715	Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.
11119775	11120176	Here it is.
11120216	11122776	This is the part after the credits have come and gone.
11122797	11124737	We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.
11124757	11126598	Some more of you guys want to play on that for a minute.
11126658	11128379	Damn, bitch, you stupid cat.
11128399	11130499	That was a great fortune cookie message.
11130699	11133861	Dan had that a long time ago, and I finally bothered to get it.
11134001	11135381	I played it on my show once.
11136682	11137082	That's good.
11137302	11137662	I like it.
11139329	11140370	Can we set up voicemail on it?
11140410	11140890	Possibly.
11141130	11145552	I think it would be cool if we could, because then we'd just leave it up all day and people could send us their FUs with voice.
11148734	11149034	Maybe.
11149094	11150935	Maybe that's something they're going to do in a little bit.
11150955	11151255	I don't know.
11154457	11159560	Alright, so, um... We'll see if we get any calls.
11160941	11161621	Nobody loves us.
11161701	11164843	Actually, we're going to put details up on the website of exactly how you can call the show.
11167264	11168305	Da-da-da-da-da-da-da...
11169617	11172120	Otherwise, is there anything else you guys wanted to add?
11174523	11175484	What up, dog?
11178047	11181751	I need to find a computer case with, like, very specific specifications.
11181831	11188599	Like, I need... It has to be, like, about 13 to 14 inches wide and about 17 inches long.
11189200	11189940	Height is not a...
11191471	11192813	Thanks for watching!
11212552	11219916	So I need to install pretty much just, well, I don't know, I might be able to do it in a normal case.
11221037	11235105	Because I need enough room to install the extra ports for, because there's, on a normal DDR machine you've got like, you know, your standard, like a JAMMA cable and four other smaller 5-pin cables that get plugged in there.
11235425	11238447	Because it needs more than just the JAMMA stuff.
11238888	11253477	So I need to add those extra ports onto the PC, and then I need to have, like, the, um, there's a monitor, um, what was it, like a video, uh, converter card or something, that small little, um, PC board that I need to get.
11254057	11266285	So I need to have that all inside a case, and it's just kind of, um, well, it's kind of tough to get a case a whole, all that, without heavily modding one or having to make one, so...
11267864	11269604	Yeah, I don't know.
11272665	11277406	Well, I was waiting for somebody to call, but I guess it's not going to happen.
11277726	11278506	I guess not.
11279006	11279386	I don't know.
11280187	11280607	Oh, well.
11281487	11282967	I thought somebody said they were going to call.
11283307	11287848	There was that one chick, Misty, that said... Well, yeah, but I didn't think she had a mic.
11287888	11288328	Let me see.
11290609	11290729	Oh.
11291466	11293408	The person who's going to call us is having technical problems.
11293428	11294849	So I guess we'll just have to try again next week.
11295870	11297111	Thank you everybody for listening.
11297311	11298772	I went ahead and closed the Skype line for now.
11299853	11303777	And we're going to do a post-show tonight of... I don't know what music I want to do.
11303817	11309461	How about... I like those compilations that I've been downloading recently.
11309501	11310823	The Ministry of Sound stuff.
11311483	11313745	I know you've got a lot of that on your computer, but I like it too.
11314225	11315446	We should listen to the whole...
11317045	11320526	The whole V-Rare CD for DJ Damien.
11320586	11321106	No, we shouldn't.
11322786	11323006	Okay.
11324227	11326147	You know, I was just looking at an Alienware site.
11326167	11328667	They have, like, small, mid-sized business computers.
11328908	11331748	Who the fuck would buy Alienware computers for business?
11332228	11336289	I mean, you can't even look professional with this little alien head on there and shit.
11336309	11338990	I don't know, I guess it beats cow print.
11339730	11340190	But whatever.
11342870	11346053	Alright, we will see you guys later.
11346293	11347354	Thanks a lot for listening.
11347594	11350817	Enjoy this random mix of stuff mixed together by Ministry Sound.
11350837	11354160	There's a lot of good DDR sounding stuff in here and stuff you've probably heard in a cage match before.
11354540	11355601	Have a great night, you guys.

11912418	11915961	Lost in this space, there's a voice calling out in my head.
11916041	11920564	I'm passing my faces that I hardly know I'll ever see.
11920684	11921345	And they keep on
