07:11.840 --> 07:15.840
Funny death of sunlight shining in her hair

07:15.840 --> 07:19.840
When she leaves, you want to follow

07:19.840 --> 07:22.840
Worry where the dress is too tight

07:22.840 --> 07:26.840
But you can't let her see you there

07:26.840 --> 07:30.840
And she's a hot one, a hell of a young

07:30.840 --> 07:32.840
Tula tenorita

07:32.840 --> 07:35.840
You'll never get close enough

07:35.840 --> 07:38.840
Tula tenorita

07:38.840 --> 07:56.840
I know she has a mind, she has an attitude Attitude, she takes on a solid tune

07:56.840 --> 08:00.840
She sees you, believes you, feeling good over you

08:00.840 --> 08:07.840
Like you knew she wouldn't when she smiles It's like the sun shining on your face

08:07.840 --> 08:13.840
Rolling and stretching the lemonade

Perfect!

08:39.840 --> 08:40.840
Indeed, perfect.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.840
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.840
Here we are back with episode number 102.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.840
We are live.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.840
You made a promo and didn't tell me.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.840
You know what was going on last night?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.840
I was playing with this new software program

08:53.840 --> 08:55.840
because I've been looking for stuff for...

08:55.840 --> 08:56.840
Is it a promo?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.840
You want to hear it one more time?

08:58.840 --> 09:02.240
Hold on.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.320
Orange Lounge Radio,

09:04.320 --> 09:05.760
Imani Music,

09:05.760 --> 09:09.080
and more.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.000
Yeah, I know. Shut up, Loki.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.680
At least I put some effort out. I was like, what the hell was that?

09:15.680 --> 09:21.160
OMG WTFBBQ. Well, okay, I've been playing with some new toys for diversion because...

09:21.160 --> 09:23.800
Well, okay, let's back this up a little bit.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.520
Obviously, you might have heard I got a new kind of computer thing going on. I

09:27.520 --> 09:32.500
I finally put in the stuff that Squeenix gave me at E3 when I won the Ballista thing, and

09:32.500 --> 09:37.100
I put them in a couple weeks ago, and of course that's what caused the show to not be here

09:37.100 --> 09:40.940
a couple weeks ago, but it's given me some time to play with some new things, install

09:40.940 --> 09:45.660
some new software that didn't run good before, and one of them is this mixing program that

09:45.660 --> 09:48.020
I was thinking about using for Diversion, because I thought it would be really cool

09:48.020 --> 09:53.220
to have the Bamani Music remixes mixing together, I thought it would be pretty cool.

09:53.220 --> 09:57.000
But unfortunately the software had problems of its own, but it sounds really, really good

09:57.000 --> 10:01.080
if you have, like, these short, like, ten-second promos, like, stringing the music together.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.400
So I made a bunch of, like, just, well, not a bunch, but, like, three quickie little promos.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.040
Little bumpers. Little bumpers, exactly. Little bumpers. Mini

10:07.040 --> 10:14.460
bumpers. Not really promos, but mini bumpers. But since the Buggy Baby... Shut up. Rubber

10:14.460 --> 10:21.240
Baggy... Baggy Bomani Bumpers. I don't know. Uh, so, I'll play some more of those tonight,

10:21.240 --> 10:25.560
because now I, that program fuckin' sucked, because after about 30 minutes and all my

10:25.560 --> 10:29.760
my audio starts skipping, so I can't use it. So now I have those little rubber baby

10:29.760 --> 10:34.600
bimani bumpers and nothing to use them for. So, I'll play them tonight, because everybody

10:34.600 --> 10:37.040
bitches that we never have new promos. So, you get those.

10:37.040 --> 10:46.520
Alright, so, I guess we have to start this episode off with a bit of an apology.

10:46.520 --> 10:53.920
Sorry, we had lives. Okay. Hold on, I'm finding some apology music here.

10:53.920 --> 10:59.680
Cuz as you may or may not know, this is our first show. When was episode 101? I would have to get out a calendar to look...

10:59.680 --> 11:01.240
What?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.880
The 18th?

11:02.880 --> 11:05.800
I can't find that song that quick.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.040
Yeah, it was before my birthday. I remember that much.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.960
What was it? No.

11:10.960 --> 11:16.420
Yeah, it was the week before my birthday, so it would have been like the 18th or something, so gosh, we've got a lot of ground to cover.

11:16.420 --> 11:17.340
But um...

11:17.340 --> 11:22.640
Okay, so we're gonna play some apology music here. I'm just looking for it.

11:22.640 --> 11:29.440
this is some nice little gothy apology music

11:29.440 --> 11:32.060
dear listeners of orange lounge radio

11:32.060 --> 11:36.200
we offer our condolences

11:36.200 --> 11:37.680
and jamie's hairball

11:37.680 --> 11:41.120
for not being live for the past two weeks

11:41.120 --> 11:46.520
jamie offers her special condolences for not being here for the past three weeks

11:46.520 --> 11:48.720
she's missed you all dearly

11:48.720 --> 11:50.720
but my aim is improving

11:50.720 --> 11:53.920
And she coughs up this hairball, especially for you.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.520
It tastes like tri-tip.

11:56.520 --> 12:01.200
You see, what we decided to do two weeks ago was for you,

12:01.200 --> 12:04.920
the listener, we decided to upgrade our boards and studios

12:04.920 --> 12:08.840
so that we could have faster and better audio for those of you guys.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.080
And plus, I would have much less headache running the show.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.840
So we let our tech master, Loki, I'm going to blame it on him,

12:13.840 --> 12:15.520
upgrade the computer.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.520
Blame it on Squenix.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.960
Microsoft.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.960
Well actually, I can't really blame it on Microsoft because we were using piratey copy.

12:22.960 --> 12:28.960
Oh, nope, he meant a pirate's treasure that we found.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.960
A photocopy.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.960
Yes, a photocopy.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.960
So basically, we started to upgrade the computer around 1 noon, thinking we'd have plenty of time to do it.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.960
And how many times did we have to install different versions of Windows XP?

12:43.960 --> 12:48.760
about six it requires because see Rob's computer is what we like to call an

12:48.760 --> 12:53.960
industry old and it it did not like anything that you did to it it was very

12:53.960 --> 12:59.800
cranky and so I ended up having to take one of my older hard drives a nice 40

12:59.800 --> 13:03.880
gig master hard drive and re-ins you know put that in there and format it god

13:03.880 --> 13:09.760
knows what was on that I'm sick of apology music every battle so yeah we

13:09.760 --> 13:14.600
We ended up reinstalling a new hard drive before it even take for some reason, I don't

13:14.600 --> 13:15.600
know why.

13:15.600 --> 13:22.280
But we finally got it installed after the show.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.400
Finally the system came up about three hours after the show was over.

13:26.400 --> 13:30.520
By that time, our buddy VX JasonXV, for those of you guys that were listening, he ended

13:30.520 --> 13:34.820
up taking over our station because I forgot that he had access to get in there and fuck

13:34.820 --> 13:37.440
with our station, but I thought it was cool that he went in there and did a live thing.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.440
It was cute.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.440
He didn't fuck with our station.

13:39.440 --> 13:43.600
No, that wasn't two weeks ago. He fondled it. That was last week, not two weeks ago.

13:43.600 --> 13:48.080
Last week was the 4th of July, and we just took it off because. Yeah, you guys have to

13:48.080 --> 13:56.200
face this. We have a national holiday dedicated to fire, and we're going to be here doing

13:56.200 --> 14:00.320
a show for you all? No, we're going to be out setting things on fire. Illegal fireworks.

14:00.320 --> 14:04.960
For last week, you do not have our apology, you get fire. Our leftover fire from last

14:04.960 --> 14:09.240
week. This is smoke and ashes. It was not our intention to be gone two weeks in a row,

14:09.240 --> 14:16.280
so we apologize. We know you've missed us. That's the excuse. That's what's going on.

14:16.280 --> 14:23.620
I make no excuses. I stand by my decisions, dammit. I take full responsibility and accountability

14:23.620 --> 14:27.720
for what I did, unlike those who are coming up in the upcoming presidential elections.

14:27.720 --> 14:34.040
Vote for me. Also...

14:34.040 --> 14:36.560
Unstable Jelly, Red vs. Blue owns you. Go watch it.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.360
uh... it and right now jamie likes to talk back to our chat room so if you

14:40.360 --> 14:42.280
want to get any detention you cannot

14:42.280 --> 14:46.240
if you think you've ever broadcast on its broadcast on the tv screen here in

14:46.240 --> 14:47.040
our studio

14:47.040 --> 14:51.320
w w w dot org launch radio dot com click on chat all the good stuff there and

14:51.320 --> 14:54.400
there's all the chatting boys and girls in the chair room that's the only way

14:54.400 --> 14:56.440
you can participate in a match if used

14:56.440 --> 14:59.880
by the way my friends

14:59.880 --> 15:04.120
someone brought up to me that there is a working mac emulator now for a pc that

15:04.120 --> 15:06.000
i'm going to be getting from a computer

15:06.000 --> 15:09.440
Wait a minute, you just said working and Mac in the same sentence.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.160
I'm going to try it out.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.800
I'm going to try it out.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.000
Just for curiosity. I'm just giving our listeners a little help.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.440
This is going to be interesting news. Now that I've apologized for being gone for

15:21.440 --> 15:25.840
the past two weeks, I have some interesting news to tell you all.

15:25.840 --> 15:31.580
I'm not going to be here for the next two weeks. Bye!

15:31.580 --> 15:35.880
So, this show will be solely in the hands of DarkSakur and Loki.

15:35.880 --> 15:41.380
I, I, yeah, dear God save us all, I fear for you all, and my apologies, but, um, if you

15:41.380 --> 15:46.820
want to pay my rent and my bills, then, uh, I will be here every week for you. Otherwise,

15:46.820 --> 15:51.240
I need to remain my company's bitch and go to strange places they tell me to go to, which,

15:51.240 --> 15:55.180
uh, for the next two weeks will involve the East Coast.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.520
Bring me back something Eastern.

15:57.520 --> 16:01.280
I, I, I don't know if I should say where. I don't want stalker fans to find me. I'm

16:01.280 --> 16:04.680
I'm not going to say exactly where, but I'll give a hint.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.840
I'll give you a hint.

16:06.840 --> 16:11.120
It's one letter off from California in the state of abbreviation.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.200
OK.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.000
It's one letter off from California in the state of abbreviation.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.680
That's way nerdy.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.800
It's an hour away from where Queer As Folk is set.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.760
There's a good hint.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.440
So I won't be here in the next two weeks.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.520
Sorry, boys and girls.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.520
How many times are we going to do this show from my house?

16:32.520 --> 16:36.520
This is my house. If you don't like it, get the fuck out.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.520
That'll be the theme of the next two weeks.

16:39.520 --> 16:44.520
As long as people don't decide to abandon me for Ron Jeremy like they did last time.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.520
You need to put the smack down.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.520
No, this time I'll be abandoned for Mame.

16:50.520 --> 16:56.520
I'll do what I can. If there's something I can do to help from millions of miles away, I will.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.800
will. Actually, this is still all up in the air, because basically, I got told that I'm

17:00.800 --> 17:08.880
taking this trip Friday, and I'll be leaving a week from today. So, everything's very last

17:08.880 --> 17:13.000
minute here, and I'm wondering if it'll actually happen. So I may be here next week, but not

17:13.000 --> 17:18.880
bloody likely. When the man tells you you go, you go. So, that's all you can do. Alright.

17:18.880 --> 17:24.400
Why does it always have to be the man? Why can't it be the woman to tell you to do something?

17:24.400 --> 17:31.600
because in this case it was a man that told me I'm going. Well, fuck you. My boss is a

17:31.600 --> 17:37.320
woman, but her boss is a man, so. Okay, well then I retract that. I heard some great woman

17:37.320 --> 17:41.320
jokes over the weekend, you wanna hear some? Sure. Alright, um, how do you fix a woman's

17:41.320 --> 17:52.720
watch? What? You don't need to, there's a clock on the oven. I would throw this can

17:52.720 --> 17:59.480
you but I'm still drinking from it and this root beer I value more than that

17:59.480 --> 18:10.080
joke I wouldn't want the house getting dirty anyway moving right along here at

18:10.080 --> 18:13.660
Orange Lounge radio we're equal opportunity offenders by the way moving

18:13.660 --> 18:16.800
right along we usually start the show off with doing a little bit of how was

18:16.800 --> 18:19.800
your day how was your week but seeing us we've been gone for a little while I

18:19.800 --> 18:21.800
I think we're going to do some how was your day, how was your month.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.800
So, Jamie, how was your day, how was your month?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.800
My day was pretty good actually.

18:28.800 --> 18:34.800
I woke up at 8.30 in the morning after having gone to bed around 4 a.m.

18:34.800 --> 18:40.800
and I decided that, well today, Julie and I were going to go running.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.800
So we went and we left, you know, on time.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.800
For the first time, Julie was on time getting to my house.

18:47.800 --> 18:52.100
We got out, we got to ARC, and it was all roped off.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.340
ARC, by the way, is American River College for those people who don't know.

18:55.340 --> 18:59.360
And so we're like, okay, so we'll go over to CSUS.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.940
Forgot the Olympic trials were going on.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.460
That's closed off, too.

19:03.460 --> 19:07.260
Right here in Sacramento, we got the Olympians.

19:07.260 --> 19:14.140
So I went to, we saw a limo there, I wanted to egg it, but anyway, so we went to Sac

19:14.140 --> 19:19.060
City, forgetting that the track there was a stadium and all closed off because of whatever

19:19.060 --> 19:24.220
zoning law or whatever. So we ended up running at Natomas High School. Now, Natomas High

19:24.220 --> 19:31.380
School is really nice. It's a very new school, lots of amenities. One would think the track

19:31.380 --> 19:37.940
would be paved. No, it's not. And with it being as hot as it was by the time we got

19:37.940 --> 19:42.980
there, like around noon. Actually, no, it wasn't around noon, it was around 11, but

19:42.980 --> 19:45.100
It was still fairly hot outside.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.100
There was wind blowing.

19:46.100 --> 19:51.700
The thing is that wind plus dirt equals dirt in your face.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.700
So to clarify, you don't rely on DDR for your exercise.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.980
You get out there on the track and run, on the dirt track.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.220
Well, I'm trying to...

19:59.220 --> 20:02.700
I have to get where I can run two miles.

20:02.700 --> 20:12.800
So right now, what the plan was is walk the first lap to warm up and then run, walk two

20:12.800 --> 20:17.360
more and then walk another and run walk two more and walk another until I can

20:17.360 --> 20:21.760
get to where I can do the whole thing running the straight way walking the

20:21.760 --> 20:25.620
curve and keep doing it like that because a friend of mine who ran track

20:25.620 --> 20:30.380
told me that that's how they trained so I was like okay I'll do that I actually

20:30.380 --> 20:38.700
made it a full mile doing the walk run I didn't stop and did my first lap walking

20:38.700 --> 20:42.780
in my last lap walking actually I did another half of that lap do on a run

20:42.780 --> 20:48.380
So I made it pretty well. I'm hoping that by the end of the month. I can actually at least run a mile

20:49.700 --> 20:55.540
Or at least run two laps without feeling like my heart wants to explode I can breathe just fine though

20:55.540 --> 20:58.380
No asthma. That's another thing about my my month

20:59.500 --> 21:02.140
Starting what happened? I think it was the week before

21:02.980 --> 21:04.620
Renfaire I'm

21:04.620 --> 21:06.620
Thinking is either the one before or after

21:06.740 --> 21:10.900
I had a pulmonary exam done to see if I to prove I didn't have asthma and

21:10.900 --> 21:17.980
I don't have asthma. The way that one of the charts reads is that it has a scale of

21:17.980 --> 21:22.960
one to ten and when you take in your first breath it goes up and then it pans

21:22.960 --> 21:31.940
off as you exhale and six for the inhale part of that is about mid-average lung

21:31.940 --> 21:36.100
capacity and I hit an eight out of ten so I apparently have really awesome

21:36.100 --> 21:41.300
some fantastic lungs and so I'm all good and I don't have to you know keep the

21:41.300 --> 21:44.860
inhaler anymore all it all it took was just losing some weight and so I've been

21:44.860 --> 21:49.700
good with that and the Ren Faire was really fun I was in the chat room though

21:49.700 --> 21:53.980
on that for that show because I was like just dead tired after the fair but they

21:53.980 --> 21:58.380
didn't have mead anywhere I was pissed off and my bodice was too big so I

21:58.380 --> 22:03.100
didn't have quite the you know lusty wench effect although some guy asked me

22:03.100 --> 22:06.380
to pick up something off of the ground so that he could stare down my cleavage

22:06.380 --> 22:14.780
so I took it as a compliment no I didn't I told him to pay me he didn't there was

22:14.780 --> 22:22.300
this cute business adorable little kid there who was in like the ultimate um I

22:22.300 --> 22:27.380
can't think of the word now he was in like sackcloth it was great just running

22:27.380 --> 22:29.820
around in sackcloth the whole time he looked like he was having a good time

22:29.820 --> 22:35.860
sackcloth burlap whatever I mean but I'm trying to think of the actual term the

22:35.860 --> 22:44.700
peasant now is it and there was let's see what else

22:44.700 --> 22:49.340
fourth of July was okay I was actually sick all day I was sick

22:49.340 --> 22:57.900
practically all the weekend dope but I went to a barbecue at the home of some

22:57.900 --> 23:06.460
friends of mine and Dan who are Atkinsing. So there's lots of meat everywhere. Meat everywhere.

23:08.060 --> 23:11.260
No potato salad. Although someone did bring potato salad, but I didn't touch it.

23:13.180 --> 23:16.060
They had sparklers there, but they had the old ones that are metal.

23:17.180 --> 23:21.020
So those were fun. I was setting them on fire. You can't ever find those kind anymore.

23:21.020 --> 23:26.460
was setting them on fire the whole night I was just all happy because I had fire

23:26.460 --> 23:36.180
and I've been training somebody at work and I basically told that uh that I'm

23:36.180 --> 23:39.980
gonna be sort of like I guess like the mentor from now on for a lot of people

23:39.980 --> 23:44.380
for the new hires who come in so I was like I don't know what to think about

23:44.380 --> 23:52.380
that because I like doing it you know I like passing on what I know and I like

23:52.380 --> 23:56.860
the teaching aspect but sometimes I want my cubicle to myself you know that's

23:56.860 --> 24:03.940
like my space it's your domain you want to be the master of your domain so but

24:03.940 --> 24:07.420
other than that I mean it's it's really cool it's just been an interesting week

24:07.420 --> 24:16.600
I missed my brother. My brother was in Alabama on the fourth weekend and I wanted to have

24:16.600 --> 24:22.700
the money to go see him but I'm flat broke right now. Oh, what else did I do? I enrolled

24:22.700 --> 24:29.820
in school. I'm going back to college. I'm going into database management and so I need

24:29.820 --> 24:34.620
a laptop so that I can do my homework wherever I happen to be because half of my classes

24:34.620 --> 24:38.460
are online. I decided to get a class that I'm not looking forward to out of the way

24:38.460 --> 24:44.980
like right off the bat. I'm taking Business Law and I'm just going to take that one in

24:44.980 --> 24:49.060
the classroom. I don't care. I want it out of the way. But they're making me take all

24:49.060 --> 24:57.180
of the stupid prerequisites that I could test out of if I was able to miswork for it. But

24:57.180 --> 25:00.620
I figure it's going to be an easy A and a good buffer against that Business Law class.

25:00.620 --> 25:03.900
So I'm having to take like Intro to Windows and beginning

25:03.900 --> 25:06.380
word processing and beginning Excel.

25:06.380 --> 25:10.580
And next semester I'm taking like Access.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.460
It's probably going to be around summer when I'm going

25:12.460 --> 25:16.900
to have to start taking the crappy programming classes.

25:16.900 --> 25:21.540
So that also is going to affect when I pump up the

25:21.540 --> 25:26.780
volume is, because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.

25:26.780 --> 25:34.920
I get out of class like at 6.45, but because it's also going to break into my gym time

25:34.920 --> 25:41.380
on Wednesdays, I'm thinking about moving the show to another night in the week, or maybe

25:41.380 --> 25:49.940
do two shows late night, because Monday, I figure if I move the show, then I'll start

25:49.940 --> 25:52.580
running on Monday and Wednesday and do spin on Friday.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.260
You can always have Tuesday back if you want.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.260
Okay.

25:55.260 --> 25:56.260
That should be easiest.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.260
And we can use the old promo again!

25:58.260 --> 25:59.260
Yay!

25:59.260 --> 26:00.260
Yay!

26:00.260 --> 26:01.260
Okay.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.260
See, that works out for everybody.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.260
That does work out.

26:03.260 --> 26:04.260
You let me know when you want to do that.

26:04.260 --> 26:06.260
I'm going to be gone for two weeks, so...

26:06.260 --> 26:08.260
And then after I get back from my little work trip,

26:08.260 --> 26:11.260
I should have an announcement on what's going to happen with Vanilla Sky.

26:11.260 --> 26:13.260
Why don't I just start it this week?

26:13.260 --> 26:14.260
Yeah, we'll figure something out.

26:14.260 --> 26:15.260
That's fine.

26:15.260 --> 26:16.260
I'll start doing it on Tuesdays.

26:16.260 --> 26:17.260
Yeah, okay.

26:17.260 --> 26:18.260
We can shuffle it around, yeah.

26:18.260 --> 26:19.260
All right.

26:19.260 --> 26:20.260
I'll do it two nights in a row.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.260
I don't care.

26:21.260 --> 26:22.260
Sure.

26:22.260 --> 26:23.260
Yeah, okay.

26:23.260 --> 26:25.260
I'll just go live all week.

26:25.260 --> 26:29.260
Fun! Alright, yeah, the Jamie experience. We'll figure it out.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.260
Everyone's going to get so sick of me.

26:31.260 --> 26:34.260
We'll make an official announcement on the website when we figure out the scheduling stuff.

26:34.260 --> 26:40.260
Oh, and the last bit of news. I have meat, and meat makes me happy.

26:40.260 --> 26:43.260
Congratulations.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.260
Okay, I'm done.

26:44.260 --> 26:48.260
All done? Alright. Um, Lucky, do you have anything you want to share? How was your week?

26:48.260 --> 26:51.260
I'm sorry, how was your month? How was your day?

26:51.260 --> 27:02.260
Um, I played Final Fantasy, I burned things, I got, um, my hard drive loader working, I played Driver 3, um...

27:04.260 --> 27:05.260
Huh?

27:06.260 --> 27:09.260
I forgot to mention something, so I'm gonna have Rob mention it for me.

27:09.260 --> 27:37.260
Okay. Anyways, I saw Spider-Man 2. I saw, um, Fahrenheit 9-11 twice. I saw, um... I don't know, some other movie. But, um, I don't know, not much that really happened. What do I say every week? Nothing happened during the week. Multiply that times four, that was my month. You know? Or, you know, two weeks since half a month, I guess.

27:37.260 --> 27:50.600
My fiancee, Nellie, who's been on the show a few times, she got a job at my work doing

27:50.600 --> 27:57.100
a mailer room and she loves it, and I'm trying to think of what else I did.

27:57.100 --> 28:00.440
Oh, today I put together the PC that's going to go in the cabinet that's been sitting here

28:00.440 --> 28:05.800
for months, just collecting dust, so it will be functional soon.

28:05.800 --> 28:17.480
So possibly the webcam will come back. Hooray. And then, um, what else? Um, there's other

28:17.480 --> 28:23.640
things but I'll mention them later. I'm sure. Yeah. Oh, and once again the EX2 machine doesn't

28:23.640 --> 28:28.920
work but I didn't have anything to do with that one. So, yeah.

28:28.920 --> 28:32.680
Alright, my week and my month and my day.

28:32.680 --> 28:36.640
You guys missed, I think, I don't think I, I think this happened after we were off air

28:36.640 --> 28:40.460
for a little while, but I had the hiccups for like three days in a row.

28:40.460 --> 28:43.620
That was really scary, because I thought like I was going to die or something.

28:43.620 --> 28:47.460
I mean, seriously, like, I don't know if you've ever had hiccups, but usually they last, what,

28:47.460 --> 28:48.740
like a half hour at the most.

28:48.740 --> 28:53.420
I had it on and off for like 90 minute intervals for three days.

28:53.420 --> 28:54.900
It was horrid.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.660
So I finally had to go to the doctor, and I swear to God, my doctor was going to laugh

28:58.660 --> 29:03.820
at me. Like, you got the hiccups? You coming in here because you got hiccups? Like, it's

29:03.820 --> 29:08.860
been three days! It's not normal! I've got brain cancer! Because I went on to WebMD.com,

29:08.860 --> 29:13.900
I swear to God, if you go on WebMD, and you type in like, hiccups, like reoccurring, it'll

29:13.900 --> 29:17.080
tell you like, oh you might have brain cancer, you better go get checked out. It's not a

29:17.080 --> 29:23.080
I went to the doctor and I'm like, Doctor, I think I have brain cancer. Why? Because I have hiccups.

29:29.080 --> 29:34.080
Oh God, what else happened besides that? Oh yeah, my birthday happened. God, that was a while now.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.080
Happy birthday, Rod!

29:36.080 --> 29:39.080
Thank you. Some of my friends threw me a surprise party, which was really cute.

29:39.080 --> 29:43.080
And my cake said, Happy Birthday, Dr. Dick, which was really cute.

29:43.080 --> 29:47.760
Yes, and I got this. I got the answer to the ferret here. I got this new little toy here.

29:47.760 --> 29:53.160
What's this guy's name? Does he have a name? Uh, it's Trash Talkers, and this guy's name...

29:53.160 --> 29:54.160
Oh my God, I love...

29:54.160 --> 29:55.160
Marshall!

29:55.160 --> 29:56.160
I left your present at home.

29:56.160 --> 30:00.160
And Marshall... Oh, that's not good. Marshall is this guy and he's wearing a lavender shirt

30:00.160 --> 30:03.400
and lavender pants with a little rainbow flag on it. And let's see some of the things that

30:03.400 --> 30:04.400
Marshall has to say.

30:04.400 --> 30:09.640
Ah, shit. You have to whack him in the head to get him to say something.

30:09.640 --> 30:20.640
It's only kinky the first time! Come on! Oh my god! It's humongous! I can't fit all that in my mouth!

30:20.640 --> 30:22.640
You can barely hear it.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.640
I don't think our listeners can hear it at all.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.640
That's great.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.640
So that's my answer to the ferret.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.640
So whenever you start up with a ferret...

30:30.640 --> 30:32.640
Oh, there, I think his speaker's in the front here.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.640
It's only kinky the first time.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.640
It's only kinky the first time.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.640
All right, anyway.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.640
Someone's done something in my purse.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.640
So, uh, what else?

30:43.640 --> 30:46.640
I don't think I've played a single game of DDR.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.640
No, I take that back.

30:48.640 --> 30:52.280
hanging out with Navi, our pop music whore, I was hanging out with him on

30:52.280 --> 30:57.280
Friday and I beat a 31 on pop music that made me so happy like on the arcade

30:57.280 --> 31:01.120
controller so I was all jazzed I know some of you out there are better but

31:01.120 --> 31:05.960
don't hate I'm getting better but we actually played DDR like on an ignition

31:05.960 --> 31:09.760
pad and everything we were playing DDR extreme at home and it was so great

31:09.760 --> 31:13.880
because like I was still doing like really well and I also got DDR for my

31:13.880 --> 31:17.520
Xbox those of you that were listening to episode 101 heard the confession that I

31:17.520 --> 31:23.840
I bought an Xbox, and I've been playing DDR on Live a little bit, and I gotta say it's

31:23.840 --> 31:29.440
very interesting to play DDR on Xbox Live, because people can talk on the microphones

31:29.440 --> 31:34.640
and stuff, and I don't have a dance pad for Xbox, so I play with a controller, and man

31:34.640 --> 31:37.960
do people on there hate on controller players, I don't care, I mean they can see I'm on a

31:37.960 --> 31:40.640
controller when I join their game, if they don't like it, kick me.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.640
I don't care.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.920
You need to play Phantasy Star with me.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.200
That's extra money.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.200
That's more money.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.200
any MMORPGs I'm playing?

31:48.200 --> 31:50.200
PSO is nine dollars.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.200
We'll see. Yeah, okay, so then I'd be on PSO.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.200
And then they forget to charge you.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.200
I'd be on PSO, then I'd be on Ragnarok,

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
cause Jamie found this free server

31:58.200 --> 32:00.200
No, I didn't find it, Marintan found it.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.200
Oh sorry, Marintan found this free server that we've all been playing Ragnarok on now.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.200
With the 60...

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
With the 60...

32:07.200 --> 32:09.200
With the 60...

32:09.200 --> 32:11.200
Yeah, 60 times experience

32:11.200 --> 32:13.200
and like 30 times drops

32:13.200 --> 32:15.200
Yeah, something like that, it's crazy.

32:15.200 --> 32:23.400
So, we've got that, the free Ragnarok server, and now, okay, Final Fantasy XI, when I reinstalled

32:23.400 --> 32:27.280
everything for the computer, it broke. It was fucked up, my graphics were flickering,

32:27.280 --> 32:31.000
it was screwed up beyond belief, and I was never going to be able to play Final Fantasy

32:31.000 --> 32:36.360
XI again. Last night, it finally got fixed. Finally got fixed last night because the way

32:36.360 --> 32:40.680
to fix it, I had to install some drivers that are two years old for my card, and now it

32:40.680 --> 32:46.560
works. So, now I'm back on there. So that would be three MMORPGs that I'm wasting my

32:46.560 --> 32:50.460
time with. I bitch enough about how I don't have enough time to play, like, real console

32:50.460 --> 32:54.840
games. Like, I've been trying to play Mega Man collection, barely have any time. I finally

32:54.840 --> 32:58.260
have sat down with Silent Hill 2, and I'm only about halfway through that, because I'm

32:58.260 --> 33:03.460
so... I have video game ADD is basically what it boils down to. I sit down... This is especially

33:03.460 --> 33:07.760
bad when I have emulation. I play a game for, like, literally, like, ten seconds, and then

33:07.760 --> 33:09.760
I'm done with it, and I want to do another game.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.760
So, yes, Jamie?

33:11.760 --> 33:14.760
I just want to answer Angel's question real quick.

33:14.760 --> 33:20.760
If you go on to, and this is sort of, I'm not meaning to plug my own stuff here, but

33:20.760 --> 33:25.760
if you go to roleplay.darksacra.com, look in the Ragnarok online folder, you'll see

33:25.760 --> 33:31.760
an announcement there posted regarding playing the free Ragnarok server.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.760
Anyway.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.760
Woo!

33:36.760 --> 33:42.400
Yeah, so that was pretty much my week and my day or my month and my day really so

33:43.180 --> 33:46.920
Did you play any Bahmani at all through this whole month Jamie? I did

33:47.620 --> 33:53.460
And I'll be damned if I can remember what it was. I played some pop and music when we had the first dorama night

33:54.340 --> 33:56.340
and

33:57.780 --> 34:02.460
I played DDR. Did you? Amazing. Kamerick was in town

34:03.100 --> 34:04.660
mm-hmm and

34:04.660 --> 34:08.660
And we went to Fry's, and I played TDR at Fry's.

34:08.660 --> 34:11.660
Awesome.

34:11.660 --> 34:23.660
I also bought, because it just came out a couple weeks ago, I bought the You Got Served, Taken to the Streets DVD, which is the instructional videos on how to do all the choreography, and I thought that was sweet.

34:23.660 --> 34:23.660
Funny.

34:23.660 --> 34:32.660
I haven't watched it yet, but I like the, uh, I actually bought, I was also probably one of the only people on the face of the earth that bought Darren's Dance Crews. I have that DVD also.

34:32.660 --> 34:43.660
Just in case if I ever one these days decide, you know, I feel like getting in shape and doing freestyle. Just in case, if that dark day ever comes. I'll be ready.

34:43.660 --> 34:51.540
Okay. All right. I think we're going to take a break, and then we're going to come back

34:51.540 --> 34:56.260
and we're going to do some real Bhavani news, because we do have, we missed a lot of news

34:56.260 --> 34:59.580
stories while we were gone, our little bit of downtime, so we're going to talk about

34:59.580 --> 35:05.220
some of that. So we're going to take a break, and Jamie requested a Gradius break, so we're

35:05.220 --> 35:06.220
going to do that.

35:06.220 --> 35:07.580
That makes me go squeak.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.340
So what is a Gradius break, Jamie?

35:09.340 --> 35:15.740
Well, I guess it's not just Gradius, but it's of all of the games featuring the Vic Viper, I guess.

35:15.740 --> 35:16.240
Oh, okay.

35:16.240 --> 35:21.440
Sensation is from the second stage of Life Force, Salamander 2.

35:23.440 --> 35:27.840
And Burning Heat was, of course, the first stage of Gradius 2.

35:27.840 --> 35:32.540
And then the Gradius Full Option mix, which was all of the music from the first Gradius.

35:32.540 --> 35:36.340
Alright, so we're going to do these songs, and then we'll do some...

35:36.340 --> 35:39.340
Chad was requesting some pop-in music, so we'll do that in a later break.

35:39.340 --> 35:43.340
And, um, okay, some actual Bomani news when we come back.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.340
We'll be back!

39:43.340 --> 39:47.340
The

39:47.340 --> 39:51.340
the

39:51.340 --> 39:55.340
the

39:55.340 --> 39:59.340
the

39:59.340 --> 40:03.340
the

40:03.340 --> 40:07.340
the

40:07.340 --> 40:11.340
the

41:11.340 --> 41:33.020
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.020
Nooooooo!

41:34.020 --> 41:36.260
Just kidding.

41:36.260 --> 41:41.820
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani Radio.

41:41.820 --> 41:46.940
We are back live, Orange Lounge Radio episode 102 in progress.

41:46.940 --> 41:52.080
Some folks out there tell me there might be a little bit of skipping going on with some of the stuff

41:52.080 --> 41:53.420
we're playing.

41:53.420 --> 41:55.220
We're using a new

41:55.220 --> 41:59.380
encoder program tonight. It's actually not new, it's the one we used to use like a long

41:59.380 --> 42:02.460
time ago between episodes like one and sixty.

42:02.460 --> 42:07.420
but they updated it so it does the MP3 Pro thing now. If you guys don't hear us in stereo,

42:07.420 --> 42:12.220
all you got to do is download the MP3 Pro codec and you'll hear us in stereo. But I

42:12.220 --> 42:15.700
guess maybe it's causing things to skip a little bit if I do too much in the background,

42:15.700 --> 42:16.700
so hmm.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.820
It's not everyone that's getting it though.

42:18.820 --> 42:26.700
Yeah, I don't know. Weird. We'll see. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. I don't know. Yeah,

42:26.700 --> 42:31.000
I know. My computer is like now it's a 3.2 gigahertz machine now. I would think it has

42:31.000 --> 42:36.680
enough juice in there to handle everything and not make things skip, but I don't know.

42:36.680 --> 42:41.060
Technology amazes me some days. I don't know. We'll see. I can always try the new video

42:41.060 --> 42:44.620
card. I think it has to do with when I have too much video going on. We'll see. We'll

42:44.620 --> 42:51.100
see. We are back, Orange Lounge Radio. I wanted to talk about some stuff that's been going

42:51.100 --> 42:55.940
on in the Bomani news scene while we've been gone for the past three weeks. First off,

42:55.940 --> 43:00.880
this story kind of came out not too long after we had our last show

43:00.880 --> 43:01.720
uh...

43:01.720 --> 43:04.780
you probably all heard about this but we haven't had a chance to make fun of it

43:04.780 --> 43:06.560
yet so i'm bringing it up again

43:06.560 --> 43:07.640
uh... this

43:07.640 --> 43:09.700
girl uh... i'm sure you've heard

43:09.700 --> 43:14.840
but she had a heart attack or something like that while playing ddr

43:14.840 --> 43:17.260
now that's a short story now really what it is

43:17.260 --> 43:18.960
is that that's kind of what the media

43:18.960 --> 43:20.960
says in all these headlines that

43:20.960 --> 43:24.300
Oh my god, girl almost died playing DDR.

43:24.300 --> 43:26.400
DDR kills teen.

43:26.400 --> 43:29.340
Did they bring up that it was a pre-existing condition?

43:29.340 --> 43:31.140
Of course not.

43:31.140 --> 43:32.420
But here's the headline.

43:32.420 --> 43:35.260
Heart condition strikes girl down in an arcade.

43:35.260 --> 43:36.820
Now see, that's not so bad.

43:36.820 --> 43:39.060
But then if you go on to GameSpot or something,

43:39.060 --> 43:40.460
GameSpot's headline was something

43:40.460 --> 43:43.660
like, girl gets heart problem while playing

43:43.660 --> 43:44.740
DDR, something like that.

43:44.740 --> 43:47.260
It's kind of like, it sort of infers

43:47.260 --> 43:48.780
that DDR caused the problem.

43:48.780 --> 43:52.060
DDR did not cause the problem.

43:52.060 --> 43:54.300
You know, if she had been out running,

43:54.300 --> 43:56.180
the same damn thing would have happened.

43:56.180 --> 44:00.380
If she had been rollerblading, the same thing would have happened.

44:00.380 --> 44:02.320
If she had been masturbating, the same thing would have happened.

44:02.320 --> 44:07.220
I have heard of that, okay?

44:07.220 --> 44:10.100
How's that for climax?

44:10.100 --> 44:12.860
It's heart-stopping. Oh my god, I'm dead.

44:12.860 --> 44:15.940
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

44:15.940 --> 44:17.700
Stop it! Stop it!

44:17.700 --> 44:22.940
God, I just came in my eye!

44:22.940 --> 44:24.860
Uh, yeah.

44:24.860 --> 44:31.860
If she had been eating a donut, that would have happened.

44:32.060 --> 44:33.840
It's alright, it's alright.

44:33.840 --> 44:38.880
Uh, let's listen to this lovely news story brought to us by the Omaha Channel

44:38.880 --> 44:41.780
dot com. And hopefully you guys don't get a lot of skipping, but uh, let's

44:41.780 --> 44:48.780
let's hear what happened to our friend here in uh... oma

44:59.060 --> 45:02.820
outside the bellevue arcade has been up for nearly one week

45:02.820 --> 45:04.940
get well soon kimber

45:04.940 --> 45:07.260
fifteen-year-old is doing just that

45:07.260 --> 45:09.840
i don't remember too much

45:09.840 --> 45:10.800
yes loki

45:10.800 --> 45:16.800
She's all, ooh yeah, donut. Stop it. Stop it.

45:16.800 --> 45:20.680
You are very rude, Mr. Loki.

45:20.680 --> 45:21.720
Alright, moving on.

45:21.720 --> 45:28.720
...willson's hat last Tuesday explained to her several times.

45:29.480 --> 45:35.140
Is that a midget playing DDR on the right side? It looks like a midget.

45:35.140 --> 45:37.820
That's Tyler Gurden.

45:37.820 --> 45:41.820
You know she was playing this game, Dance Dance Revolution, at the arcade with a friend.

45:41.820 --> 45:44.820
She then fell to the floor.

45:44.820 --> 45:50.820
Okay, well see she was playing I Do, I Do, I Do. That's what happened is that she heard that song and she was like,

45:50.820 --> 45:54.820
Ah Christ, this song sucks. I'm gonna die.

45:56.820 --> 46:02.820
We're being really horrible, you guys. Okay, we're not trying to be mean, but we accomplished, what, yes.

46:02.820 --> 46:04.820
She played the song Broken My Heart.

46:04.820 --> 46:17.820
That joke, oh give me a break, that joke is so used. That was like the first freaking thing he heard on every message board. First thing on every message board.

46:21.820 --> 46:24.820
Oh god, what a crappy song!

46:26.820 --> 46:27.820
I do, I do, I do.

46:27.820 --> 46:29.820
I don't, I don't, I don't.

46:29.820 --> 46:31.820
Let's see, let's continue with the news story here.

46:31.820 --> 46:41.820
The arcade owners gave Kimber CPR, a police officer took over for them, and paramedics shocked Kimber several times with a defibrillator to get her heart working again.

46:41.820 --> 46:45.820
Now how many times do you get to hear the word defibrillator in the news, huh?

46:45.820 --> 46:46.820
That's such an awesome word.

46:46.820 --> 46:51.820
Defibrillator. I challenge all of our listeners to use the word defibrillator in a sentence today.

46:51.820 --> 46:57.820
Why don't you shove a defibrillator up your ass?

46:57.820 --> 47:01.320
Because keep in mind that the media is typically too tight after

47:03.040 --> 47:06.940
Well, I'm sorry nothing, okay hypertrophy cardiomyopathy

47:07.700 --> 47:09.700
Yeah, I'll say that three times fast

47:11.020 --> 47:14.820
Hydro wait, let's see if it hydrotrophy cardiomyopathy

47:15.180 --> 47:20.160
I totally fucked that up. I know it totally sounds made up water. This is real

47:20.340 --> 47:23.580
This is a real if you could have this and you could get this

47:23.580 --> 47:27.580
No, he probably doesn't have it, and you probably can't catch it.

47:27.580 --> 47:28.580
Moving on.

47:28.580 --> 47:33.580
The walls around her heart are so thick, her heart wasn't getting the signals to beat.

47:33.580 --> 47:41.580
You could be asleep, you could be walking, running, sitting down to eat, and it could hit you.

47:41.580 --> 47:46.580
Sitting down to eat, it could hit you.

47:46.580 --> 47:48.580
You know, it could have been that she's like,

47:48.580 --> 47:51.580
Mungo needs food!

47:51.580 --> 47:55.260
A translation for Spaceboy, who I guess is one of our new listeners?

47:55.260 --> 47:55.760
Sure.

47:55.760 --> 47:58.960
It's the paddle thing that they put on you and make it clear.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.100
The question is, what is a defibrillator?

48:00.100 --> 48:03.920
What is a defibrillator? Yes, if you ever watch like ER or something and you hear them go clear

48:03.920 --> 48:05.700
and then they put those paddles on somebody and it goes

48:05.700 --> 48:08.500
and then the body like bounces, that's a defibrillator.

48:08.500 --> 48:12.020
I want to see someone that doesn't clear when that happens.

48:12.020 --> 48:14.460
I want them to like be like, you're gonna be okay!

48:14.460 --> 48:16.620
And then just get thrown back. That'd be great.

48:16.620 --> 48:18.820
Defibrillators have always been...

48:18.820 --> 48:27.820
Defibrillator has always been comedy gold, um, in movies like Naked Gun and stuff like

48:27.820 --> 48:29.820
that, so, anyway, moving on.

48:29.820 --> 48:33.340
I'm gonna bring you some comic books that Kimber's parents are just glad it hit her

48:33.340 --> 48:34.340
when it did.

48:34.340 --> 48:40.020
I mean, she was in the right place with all the right people around her.

48:40.020 --> 48:42.700
I would just like to point something out there, though.

48:42.700 --> 48:45.700
The mother says, what's so damn funny, Jamie?

48:45.700 --> 48:54.460
The mother says, in this story, the mother says she was at the right place with all the

48:54.460 --> 48:56.460
people needed around there to help her.

48:56.460 --> 48:59.500
DDR almost kills a teen.

48:59.500 --> 49:04.180
It murdered a teenager because she was playing a bad song and her heart just stopped.

49:04.180 --> 49:05.860
DDR is bad for people.

49:05.860 --> 49:10.220
Yet the mother says she was in the right place at the right time with all the right people

49:10.220 --> 49:12.220
around her.

49:12.220 --> 49:19.780
The truth is, they don't really want their daughter and they are hoping that she would

49:19.780 --> 49:22.040
die so they can collect the insert- That is mean!

49:22.040 --> 49:23.040
That is just mean!

49:23.040 --> 49:24.040
First off- Rude!

49:24.040 --> 49:25.040
So rude!

49:25.040 --> 49:27.040
How old was she?

49:27.040 --> 49:28.040
15.

49:28.040 --> 49:33.500
First and foremost, her parents should have been doing their god damn job, okay?

49:33.500 --> 49:34.500
They knew she had- Well now-

49:34.500 --> 49:37.260
Now listen, they knew she had a heart condition, right?

49:37.260 --> 49:39.060
No, I don't think they did.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.060
Really?

49:40.060 --> 49:41.060
I don't think so.

49:41.060 --> 49:45.060
They don't say. You know, interestingly enough, they don't say, but I'm going to assume...

49:45.060 --> 49:48.060
I heard that it was a known pre-existing condition.

49:48.060 --> 49:53.060
Well, you know, people are going to say things in this situation.

49:53.060 --> 49:55.060
Well, it's not even so. My question is, well...

49:55.060 --> 49:58.060
You don't catch heart disease from playing DDR.

49:58.060 --> 50:02.060
It's because there's something wrong with you, okay?

50:02.060 --> 50:05.060
You have a condition.

50:05.060 --> 50:09.060
I am almost positive. To be honest, I'm almost positive they did not know beforehand

50:09.060 --> 50:12.940
beforehand because of the next part of this little article.

50:12.940 --> 50:17.540
Kimber now has a pacemaker and will be on medication for the rest of her life, but she

50:17.540 --> 50:21.880
should be out of the hospital soon, in fact hanging out with her friends and going to

50:21.880 --> 50:23.320
the arcade.

50:23.320 --> 50:28.320
So she's now on medication and she now has a pacemaker.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.300
I'm assuming if they knew about the condition before they would have given her the pacemaker

50:31.300 --> 50:32.300
before.

50:32.300 --> 50:37.120
And the thing is that that's still not something that playing a game of DDR is going to cause.

50:37.120 --> 50:41.560
And who is the maker of this pacemaker? Konami. I smell conspiracy.

50:41.560 --> 50:48.560
Konami doesn't make pacemakers. How do you know? It's Black Ops Konami.

50:50.560 --> 50:54.260
Well they make casino games and a lot of people didn't know that, I mean.

50:54.260 --> 50:59.800
Nintendo makes pachinko machines. They make pachinko machines, they could very

50:59.800 --> 51:04.800
well make pacemakers. I might try the Dance Dance Revolution, but

51:04.800 --> 51:08.840
thinking no yes this girl will be playing para para paradise for the rest

51:08.840 --> 51:14.680
of her life God help everybody yes she'll be switching to pump it up

51:14.680 --> 51:20.440
switching to techno motion her parents wanted to thank all of the people who

51:20.440 --> 51:23.680
helped to revive her including the arcade owners the police officer and the

51:23.680 --> 51:27.240
paramedics all of those rescuers have been checking up on her in the hospital

51:27.240 --> 51:31.000
the heart problem is genetic yeah that's what we're told in fact her mother got

51:31.000 --> 51:33.880
checked and has a mild form of it and the rest of the family is getting

51:33.880 --> 51:37.560
checked out too. A simple echocardiogram can usually detect the disease.

51:37.560 --> 51:40.640
Interesting, so it sounds like they didn't know about it because the mom's

51:40.640 --> 51:42.400
getting checked now, they're all getting checked.

51:42.400 --> 51:45.760
They're having this electrocardiogram to figure out who's got the heart condition.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.920
But see, that shows right there. That right there

51:48.920 --> 51:52.400
is proof that the doctors themselves don't think DDR did it, which of course

51:52.400 --> 51:54.520
they're going to be smarter than them,

51:54.520 --> 51:57.280
and checking it as a genetic condition.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.680
What would happen if this story was

51:59.680 --> 52:04.120
that girl gets heart attack from playing grand theft auto

52:04.120 --> 52:07.240
that would be great i mean

52:07.240 --> 52:14.240
the bullets are so real it struck my heart

52:14.360 --> 52:17.360
alright that's the end of the story

52:17.360 --> 52:19.040
i'm really

52:19.040 --> 52:22.560
what if that poor girl is listening to us what if that poor girl is an orange lounge radio fan

52:22.560 --> 52:26.080
and here we are making fun of her plight

52:26.080 --> 52:29.000
making fun of the stupid people who don't understand it.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Alright.

52:30.000 --> 52:37.760
Just remember that Loki is an equal opportunity offender and we love everybody equally.

52:37.760 --> 52:43.040
I just was laughing at something that DD Archaholic said in there that, you know, about the warning

52:43.040 --> 52:46.360
because it's in Japanese.

52:46.360 --> 52:53.320
The high intensity warning that's in Japanese.

52:53.320 --> 53:00.320
I'm so glad that the microphone can't pick Loki up right now, I am so glad.

53:01.400 --> 53:05.400
I guess that's that for that story. Anything else you want to say about the girl with the

53:05.400 --> 53:08.720
heart thing?

53:08.720 --> 53:09.960
Please people,

53:09.960 --> 53:10.900
if you think

53:10.900 --> 53:13.360
if your heart kind of tingles sometimes,

53:13.360 --> 53:15.120
or you think your heart might,

53:15.120 --> 53:18.380
there's something non-normal about your heart, like you feel it

53:18.380 --> 53:23.440
you know tingling a lot and you suddenly can't feel your arm someday

53:23.440 --> 53:25.360
tingle not tinkle

53:25.360 --> 53:28.520
if your heart tingles you've got a whole other problem okay

53:28.520 --> 53:32.760
but if your heart's like tingling a little bit or your hand hurts or you know you

53:32.760 --> 53:34.000
find that you're losing

53:34.000 --> 53:36.240
uh... feeling in your leg when you're playing DDR

53:36.240 --> 53:39.560
please go see a doctor okay if i can go to my doctor because i think i have the

53:39.560 --> 53:41.300
hiccups for too long

53:41.300 --> 53:43.960
you can go to your doctor because you might have a heart condition get that

53:43.960 --> 53:45.600
little electrocardiogram

53:45.600 --> 53:50.040
And please keep DDR out of the news for this kind of crap.

53:50.040 --> 53:51.600
If the rest of your body is thick,

53:51.600 --> 53:53.800
then you're probably your heart's going to be thick too.

53:57.440 --> 54:01.320
My head is just large, as a bug said, unlike Loki's head.

54:04.920 --> 54:07.120
One day, Loki, you are going to get

54:07.120 --> 54:09.520
smited down from the heavens above

54:09.520 --> 54:11.880
with some horrible, horrific story.

54:11.880 --> 54:15.000
And everybody you've ever made fun of in the past

54:15.000 --> 54:24.640
is going to be there to make fun of you. Whoo! Oh my God! Oh wait, that's ironic. No, I

54:24.640 --> 54:29.560
keep telling people I'm going to die an ironic death. It'll be funny. Don't worry. I just

54:29.560 --> 54:33.860
want to... I'll drown on an airplane or something. This is my disclaimer, that for everybody

54:33.860 --> 54:40.760
who thinks that DDR was... You know, her playing DDR contributed to an aggravation of that

54:40.760 --> 54:45.360
condition. But for anyone who thinks that DDR caused the condition, I'm laughing at

54:45.360 --> 54:46.760
you and pointing my finger.

54:46.760 --> 54:49.360
But it did. It's Devil Devil Revolution.

54:49.360 --> 54:53.360
I hit Rob instead.

54:53.360 --> 54:58.360
Give me my computer.

54:58.360 --> 55:04.560
Alright. You guys are so insensitive. We should call ourselves Orange Lounge Insensitive Radio

55:04.560 --> 55:07.960
because that's, that's what we are, you guys. Man.

55:07.960 --> 55:11.960
Don't play DDR if you are 500 pounds and can't feel your arm.

55:11.960 --> 55:15.320
No, play DDR. Please.

55:15.320 --> 55:22.320
Yes, Loki. If you throw your arm, that's just gonna be disturbing.

55:25.200 --> 55:28.960
I really don't know where to take the show from here. What?

55:28.960 --> 55:32.440
Did her falling down and having a heart attack cause vibrations that disturb the

55:32.440 --> 55:33.200
neighbors?

55:33.200 --> 55:36.240
Just stop it. Just stop. Wait, wait, wait. Was she really overweight?

55:36.240 --> 55:39.760
yes well I don't know it's got well I didn't see

55:39.760 --> 55:42.680
she looked she looked healthy

55:42.680 --> 55:46.680
did she pass her song?

55:46.680 --> 55:50.360
did she perfect attack it? did she pass her song?

55:50.360 --> 55:53.360
god damn

55:53.360 --> 55:58.680
how many misses?

55:58.680 --> 56:04.560
she was she was a shape that a lot of people are okay she's just

56:04.560 --> 56:21.560
Everybody, no, I wouldn't say that. She didn't look, she didn't look to the point where it was, like, morbid, okay? She just looked healthy. Like, you know, she just, God. I'm gonna get letters from this.

56:21.560 --> 56:30.560
I wish we never do get hate mail. We never do get hate mail. Yeah, I know. Moving on. I have chat rooms going, moving on! I agree, moving on.

56:30.560 --> 56:45.560
This week we get a brand new Bomani game. I know we haven't talked about it a whole lot on this show, but, uh, Karaoke Revolution 2 is still slated to come out July 13th. So, uh, Jamie, there's something you can do while I'm gone.

56:45.560 --> 56:52.560
Not just no, but hell no. I don't think. I was in band for a reason.

56:52.560 --> 57:01.440
season? If you look at the box art, it's interesting because it's red instead of blue, and it's

57:01.440 --> 57:05.680
got all new songs in it, some new modes. We've talked about it enough before on this show,

57:05.680 --> 57:12.760
but it is coming out relatively soon. Hopefully you got your pre-orders in. If you didn't,

57:12.760 --> 57:17.640
well, yeah, you're not supporting Konami, and we won't have any more DDR ever again

57:17.640 --> 57:22.960
thanks to you

57:22.960 --> 57:24.460
moving on

57:24.460 --> 57:25.700
also uh...

57:25.700 --> 57:29.420
so we know character evolution to is coming out we still have extreme on the

57:29.420 --> 57:30.240
way

57:30.240 --> 57:33.120
we still have uh... do you also makes two on the way but what's going on in

57:33.120 --> 57:34.180
japan

57:34.180 --> 57:37.520
we haven't heard a whole lot about what's going blissful news yes beautiful

57:37.520 --> 57:40.580
blissful news from japan we haven't heard of

57:40.580 --> 57:45.080
no setup i'd quite the opposite loki we did get an announcement that eight style

57:45.080 --> 57:47.080
is, in fact, on the way.

57:47.080 --> 57:49.080
Airdstyle will be coming to the home.

57:49.080 --> 57:52.580
You're talking about releasing more Guitar Freaks, also, I thought.

57:52.580 --> 57:54.080
No, more Guitar Freaks.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.580
I think that's just people starting rumors.

57:55.580 --> 57:58.080
Would make me happy, but it's not going to happen.

57:58.080 --> 58:01.580
Well, I thought that because it did so well,

58:01.580 --> 58:04.580
they were going to look into their other games.

58:04.580 --> 58:06.080
If they do, sign me up,

58:06.080 --> 58:09.580
because I need more Guitarodile at home.

58:09.580 --> 58:17.820
Yes, so basically their website says something to this effect, because 7th Style did better

58:17.820 --> 58:21.360
than they thought it would do, they are going to go ahead and make an 8th style, and thank

58:21.360 --> 58:25.660
you to all of you that helped make Konami Style a purchase to continue supporting the

58:25.660 --> 58:26.660
project.

58:26.660 --> 58:33.140
Details will be on the 2DX website, official website, konamistyle.com, and in the Konami

58:33.140 --> 58:38.700
Style newsletter, you just have to wait, keep on helping them out and continuing the production

58:38.700 --> 58:43.500
of BeatMania 2DX sequels. So it sounds like they might keep going, even after 8th style,

58:43.500 --> 58:47.180
if 8th style does well. The question is, are we going to have to do any petitions this

58:47.180 --> 58:49.900
time, or are we going to have to do any, you know, um...

58:49.900 --> 58:54.060
God, I hope not. God, I hope not too. That was stupid. You remember, I went off on Konami

58:54.060 --> 58:57.780
style on this show previously for having to make us do all those stupid questionnaires

58:57.780 --> 59:03.660
and everything? Either make the game, or don't! Quit making us have to work. You're the ones

59:03.660 --> 59:10.980
making money off it, you do the work. We're not going to fill out no damn petition. Geez.

59:10.980 --> 59:15.500
Alright. You know what's funny is I still never did

59:15.500 --> 59:19.620
buy Seven Style. I said I would buy Seven Style, but because my controller kind of sucks,

59:19.620 --> 59:23.340
I haven't bothered with Seven Style. And now I'm like, I'm all about popin' music now.

59:23.340 --> 59:29.500
I'm like, I need to get a popin' music arcade style, and da da da da da. We'll see. We'll

59:29.500 --> 59:35.740
we'll see what happens. So hopefully 8 style does well too, and then we'll see a 9th style

59:35.740 --> 59:40.500
in the future, but let's take it one step at a time, boys and girls. So we'll hopefully

59:40.500 --> 59:50.220
see, hopefully we will see 8 style at the end of the year, but nothing confirmed yet.

59:50.220 --> 59:55.260
Alright, let's see, do we want to do the cage match? Actually, let's go to a break, because

59:55.260 --> 01:00:01.220
there's still more news stories I want to talk about before we come back. In this break,

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:08.060
I guess since we heard about 8 style, we'll play something from 2DX8 style. We'll play

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.960
this song. I like this one. And then we had a request from some pop music, so we'll work

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:18.340
that in there too. Some random pop music song. And when we come back, some more news and

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:24.060
all your favorite stuff, Orange Launch Radio, Cage Match on the way, FUs on the way, and

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:31.060
more exciting news. Yes. Yes, Jamie. Yes? Yes. Yes. All right. We'll be back.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:34.060
I don't want to go back to the place where I was born

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:44.060
I don't want to go back to the place where I was born

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:19.080
dot com

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.900
welcome back to warren's laundry and i just don't propel all over now the

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:24.760
courts tangle in my chair and

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.600
everything's breaking rob well i'll take this moment to answer john field

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.420
sure i'm i want uh...

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.080
this time from and today because i've been looking for forever and my single

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.480
uh... but uh... sort of stepped on by somebody

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:43.320
ouch

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:51.320
Since some of you guys didn't seem to know those songs in the break, the songs in that

01:06:51.320 --> 01:07:00.520
break from 2DX8 style, Love is Orange by Orange Lounge, Yamato, Space Worship Yamato by Sousasaki

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:06.720
from Popin' Music 7, and then in Popin' Music 7 as well, we played a song by a group called

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:12.040
Komo Tomok, the genre is lonely in the song, Artemis.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.700
So I know a lot of you guys may not be as familiar with the pop music songs.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:20.300
So we'll play a few more for you guys tonight just because we can.

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:21.300
You are back...

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.500
I need you to pick up that soundtrack they have, though, of the Auto-Malo 1 and 2.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.500
Oh yeah?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.540
I came really close to it, it's really awesome.

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.540
Cool.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.540
Alright.

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:35.420
We were talking about some Bahmani news before we went to the break, we were talking about

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:38.180
the girl who had the heart attack playing DDR, even though that was, well, it wasn't

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.540
really a heart attack, whatever it was, that was a couple weeks ago.

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:45.860
But as you may or may not know, we've been off the air for about three weeks.

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.940
Because of problems out of our control, but we're back.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.940
You know what?

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.940
It's like a national holiday.

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:55.020
Real shows go off the air for like two months, and you still watch them.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:08:00.220
So I don't think a two week break is too much to ask, people.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:04.420
Anyway, I thought this was interesting, and I know Loki wants to talk about this.

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:08.140
You found something interesting on eBay this week, didn't you?

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.540
Yes, we have.

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:20.140
the same people behind the wonderful bootleg ddr megamix are back at it again with, for

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:27.980
those who don't know what ddr megamix is, my bad! God! I'm thinking I forget these things.

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:33.340
Now, ddr megamix is this really shitty bootleg that came out that basically was supposed

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:38.300
to have the songs from 4th, 5th and Xtreme in all in one cabinet, which would be pretty

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:43.220
cool. But no, all it was was DDR Extreme with really shitty graphics and glitched out shit

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:49.580
and the wonderful warning screen don't fall off with two giant Star Wars AT-STs in there.

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:55.900
So, um, that was really lame. So this new one now has come out and is being distributed

01:08:55.900 --> 01:09:00.320
by some guy on the internet and it's also the same guy that's behind Megamix as I said

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:05.340
before. Now what's new about this is one, there's actual graphics, it's not like fucked

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:12.020
up graphics as before. There's actual, like, new graphics, which, stupid, who cares? And

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:19.840
the ability to speed up tempo of a song up to 20%, which is pretty lame. So it's Dance

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:27.180
Dance Revolution Extreme Plus with, yeah, just really shitty stuff. And they're selling

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:35.060
for $650. And there is the link in the chatroom. I love this ad. I just posted the link in

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:40.400
the chat room there. It has this running theme going through the game, and that is like torso

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:46.160
shots. And look at this, the logo, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus, is just the shot

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:52.760
of a boob, basically. It's the logo. Look at that. It's just a boob. That's the marquee.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:10:02.260
It's a boob. And then, oh sorry, it's a breast. It's a breast. And then you have that same

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.220
breast for light mode and then there's beginner mode which has a man breast

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:10.700
very nice man breast I must say and then on the heavy mode I don't know what the

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:16.940
fuck that is then you have like a god like Trinity for the matrix it's the

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.500
hermaphrodite

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:26.460
also let me read this ad for you guys because it's hilarious let me I will

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:31.540
read this my announcer voice here dad stands revolution extreme plus is

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:36.900
available now this is the latest upgrade for the DDR all new graphics with an

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.780
incredible speed upgrade we asked the players what they wanted and they said

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:48.020
speed it up speed it up speed it up so we did earnings results up by 40% is

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:51.860
that what everybody was saying speed it up speed it up speed it up I think they

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.820
were saying get rid of it faster no I think they were saying give us new songs

01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:05.820
songs. Give us a new mix, new mix, new mix. Not crappy bootlegs, crappy bootlegs. I love

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:11.700
this, how you can bring up the screen and then you can speed up the song by 20%. There's

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:17.860
a little problem though with it. A few things that just didn't quite work out. Number one,

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:24.620
there is no heavy mode. There's beginner, light, standard. Heavy is only selectable

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:30.360
on, you know, the song select screen. Number two, if you speed up the song save by 20 percent,

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.180
okay, you're done with your game. Guess what? If the person doesn't set it back down to

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:40.280
normal, they're still on 20 percent. It just stays that way. It's really stupid. That should

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:47.020
be max 300 really fun. Yeah, actually there's an arcade already in Australia that has this

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:51.240
and they said, you know, it's not that bad. It's actually kind of fun to play the sped

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.340
up songs, but it's just a novelty, I think. You know, if they, see what I thought when

01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:01.260
I first heard about DDR Extreme Plus, I thought it was, oh, someone's, you know, selling the

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:06.340
hacked version of DDR Extreme with the extra modifiers on it. See, now that's what I would

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.940
have done. If you're gonna hack it like this, you know, put those extra modifiers on there

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:14.580
as well. Here, I'm gonna simulate for you guys what this would sound like, okay? So

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.020
So here's a fast song already, all right, Waka Waka.

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.060
Oops, sorry, let me play this for you guys.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.340
Okay, now let's see what it sounds like

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.020
if we were to up the volume, up the speed by 20%.

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.340
Now you know how hard this song is already, right?

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.180
Okay, here we go.

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:42.460
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:47.460
I would die trying to play this. This would give me a heart failure, okay?

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:52.460
They would have to get the defibrillators out for me on this crap.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:58.460
It made the song sound a little better, though.

01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:02.460
See, now... Alright.

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:06.460
This is really stupid. Arcade owners are actually...

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.460
The people that bought Megamix are ready to snatch this up for another $650.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:16.460
That's how much Megamix was. $650 to get a really shitty version of DDR Extreme with crap graphics.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:21.460
Arcade owners actually paid this, so there's obviously money in this.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:25.460
And, now this is distributed through a company called Dakota Games.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:32.460
Dakota Games is also known for another, um, hack that's Daytona CRX.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:37.460
Which is, um, basically Daytona with Super Off-Road added to it.

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:48.460
Basically, it's the ability, which is kinda cool, it's the ability to, like, save profiles and you upgrade car parts and stuff to make your cars have more speed, more traction, etc.

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.460
Now that's a cool feature, it adds, you know, stuff to the game.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:56.460
Now this, while it being a really shitty hack, it does add features to it, so...

01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:07.460
It's a really, I wouldn't go spend $650 on it, but hey, whatever. I mean, at least it's not like Megamix, but it is still crap.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:17.460
It's getting better though. They're starting to learn. They actually did something I didn't think, you know, of. So, more power to them, I guess.

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:24.660
I don't know what to think about this whole, like, we're going to do the tempo change and

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:28.100
change the game here. I think it would have been cool if they had to slow it down by 20%

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:33.820
mode. That would have been cool. Oh, now I've got to try it again to see what slowed down

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:44.340
20% would sound like. Yes, I do. You know you want to hear it. Jamie, what do you think

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:49.580
this would you ever play this game or is this just utter crap to you or what? I have two

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:58.020
words for this. Hell no. Why not? Because it's just stupid. If I want to play DDR, I

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:04.460
would go play like, you know, like Max 2 or Xtreme. I'd like to add that, you know the

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:09.780
arcade chain Tilt that's in, you know, arcades around malls throughout the United States?

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:14.780
We've upgraded all their machines to Megamix, so I guess we're going to upgrade to next.

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:16.780
Yeah, that's right.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:21.780
Well, I knew there was a reason I don't go there. Also because it's in Florida Mall.

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:22.780
Yeah.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:26.780
Let's see what Wakka-Lakka would sound like if they had a slow down feature.

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.780
Now maybe more of you could pass the song this way.

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.780
So here we go, we know the normal way.

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.780
If I can get it to play.

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.780
Okay.

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:40.780
Okay, now let's see what it'll be down 20%.

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.900
Now I can beat it!

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.780
Duh, duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh.

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:53.780
This is like training mode, kind of.

01:15:53.780 --> 01:16:00.780
I can't stand this song now.

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.740
J. Ramen the Demon.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:10.740
See, we knew there was something to that Devil Devil Revolution thing going on.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:14.740
Uh, Chat Room is letting you know that somebody who says they worked for Tilt

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:18.420
said they did not upgrade ALL the machines.

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.100
Well that still doesn't matter, you upgraded some of them, that still makes you stupid.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:29.100
The tilt in my town of Berth was bought out by Namco, thank God, so it doesn't suck.

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.420
Alright.

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:58.260
Other news going on here, Mel B was in our chat room earlier, one of our buddies from

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:02.420
ddrspot.com, and he wanted us to share some information with you guys, or, well, you know,

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:05.820
he was telling us some stuff, and I said I'd pass it along.

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:11.340
I know ddrspot hasn't posted a lot of articles lately, but he did say this week, sometime

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:16.180
early in the week, they are going to post an interview with Akira Yumoka.

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.820
So that should be a very good read.

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:23.020
So check ddrspot.com the next couple days and wait for that.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:30.100
Also, he's looking for, they scored an interview, DDR Spot also scored an interview with Naoki.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.500
They're going to be doing an interview with Naoki in the next few days.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:37.740
They are still looking to field questions, so Mel has said his email box is open to you

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:41.220
guys if you want to send him some questions.

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:45.400
I know this is ironic because the interview is for DDR Spot, but if you want to send Mel

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.640
an email. If you have a question for Naoki, Mel will consider all your questions. He won't

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:52.360
ask everything because if everybody sends a question, that interview is going to be

01:17:52.360 --> 01:18:02.080
an hour long. But he'll consider all your stuff. Mel at DDRFreak.com is his email. So,

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:07.640
just send that along if you have a question you would like to ask Naoki. Such as, you

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:15.200
want some fashion tips? Who does his hair? Naoki Eye for the straight guy. How deep in

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:27.800
the Punani, are you? Okay. See, the questions I want to ask, Mel isn't going to ask. I want

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:36.960
to know if he ever really has boiktopolitary or if it's a purely professional relationship.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.640
I would love to have Nokia. I would give a lot of head to get any Bimani celebrity on

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:48.880
the show, because then that means we've made it. That's a good idea. You know, we were

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:55.320
supposed to have an interview with, you know, Jason Enos from Konami, but in typical Orange

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.680
Lounge fashion, that all got fucked up. Yeah, and I missed my chance to go hang out with

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:04.200
the man, thank you. Which is too bad, because it was, honestly guys, I hate to say this,

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.840
it was a great interview, because Loki fucking asked, I can't believe you had the balls to

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:12.520
to do this. Loki fucking asked him about Into the Groove, okay?

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.360
They had a very good answer. He had a very good answer, and I wish I could

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.480
remember it. It was using it to encourage the community

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.480
to keep growing. Yeah. Something like that.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:32.020
It was something like that. He basically was welcoming the challenge, basically, which

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:36.280
I thought was very professional. He's a good guy. I'm sad about what happened

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.980
to the interview but

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:44.340
yeah what he told us off air was hilarious no just kidding

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:46.700
we thank him for taking the time to do the interview with us even though it

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.220
never aired because uh...

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:51.500
mistakes happen

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.460
bad mistakes happen

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.460
we could have brought back portal

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.980
that's very true

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:07.980
we could have merged with g_-four okay that that could have been what happened

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:14.440
i wouldn't mind taka and taku naked in the same room

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.940
in response to uh...

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:16.960
jason in the chat room

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:23.960
while uh... jamie lives out her fantasy over there perhaps... I'm not living out any fantasy

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.320
you have another news story you wanna talk about or?

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.180
okay fine logie

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:35.180
Because I'm not quite on, you know, the pulse of all the new music games that come out,

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:42.180
this one kind of slipped under my radar. It's a game called I Can Boogie, okay?

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:49.180
Say that one more time, Loki. You're an ass, okay? It's called I Can Boogie, okay?

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:55.180
It's basically, if you were to take Itoy Groove, put it in an arcade cabinet that looks something like Pump It Up,

01:20:55.180 --> 01:21:11.180
So that's what you've got. And it looks pretty cool. We just got it down at one of our arcades in the Century 14 in Roseville, down near Sacramento. We got one of these things. I have yet to play it, but it sounds really cool. It looks kind of neat.

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:17.180
It's got actual music from, you know, artists, no covers or anything, you know, hot stuff from Donna Summers.

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:26.180
It's got, uh, what is it, um, something like Jan Jackson on there and, like, some other stuff.

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.180
It's pretty good, though.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:34.180
Um, it just looks interesting because it uses a camera just like, you know, Itoygroove.

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:39.180
So, if you've got one of these by you, because I also heard there's one at Dave & Buster's in Milpitas.

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:46.420
you got one by you should check it out. So, yeah, that was all I had. And you can find

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:53.380
that at, I believe, ikengroove.com. But you actually haven't gotten a chance to play this

01:21:53.380 --> 01:22:04.420
yet. No, not yet. Not yet. All right. So they basically turned Itoy Groove into an arcade

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:09.600
game. Somebody stole that idea and turned it into an arcade game. Interesting. Itoygroove,

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:13.720
I wasn't that thrilled with Itoygroove. Like, it was cool for a day and then that was it.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:19.560
Like, I don't know, I don't know why that game just didn't do it for me. But, the thing

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.900
is with this arcade game, it's like a cross between Itoygroove and Para Para. That's pretty

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:29.580
much what it is. Because it's, I think, there's five points, like five sensors spots that

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:34.780
that you have to hit, you know, depending on how the arrows come. And they've got, you

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:40.340
know, pretty interesting stuff on there. That was, oh, that was the other thing, since someone

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:45.820
mentioned DDR Karaoke Mix. There's actually one of those very, very, very rare arcade

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:55.060
games being sold on Yahoo Auctions for $1600 at Karaoke Revolution Second Mix, or not Karaoke

01:22:55.060 --> 01:23:00.840
revolution DDR karaoke mix second mix which I thought that was pretty sweet if

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:06.360
I had that kind of no cash I would buy one but I don't so I already know what I

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:12.920
want to get for my house my second mix upstream oh yeah you get the 2d x

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:17.160
machine too that's what I want awesome but I probably you have the only one in

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:22.640
the u.s. I think that's my well we said right off the bat when we buy our house

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:28.420
We're getting a DDR machine, and I'm about I'm thinking of trying to get that in the I want to get an actual

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:36.520
Second you know second style build a substream machine. You know the old style monitor and everything I know

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.120
Yeah, if I can I doubt it would be that expensive for that particular machine

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.120
Well good luck to you

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.000
Alright, you guys want to have yourselves a cage match. We haven't had that one of these in a while. It feels like

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Alright, there's going to be kind of a small twist in tonight's cage match.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The twist in tonight's cage match is that we are cleaning the slate and we're not going to carry a winner over from the show three weeks ago

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
because basically it's won for like three weeks now by default.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So we are wiping the slate clean and we're starting off with three brand new songs tonight in tonight's cage match.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000
So, the way the cage match works, each host brings one song to the table.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And we're going to play these songs, and then you're going to vote on your favorite in the chat room,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and your song that you pick as your favorite will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Bimani Music and More program, with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
That'll include the Cage Match winner from tonight. We'll go into rotation.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And then it'll come back next week to compete again against two challengers.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
So, we get a clean slate tonight, so that means we're going to hear three new songs in full.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Cage Match kind of used to have this theme of songs that would be good for Bamani, like GDR2DX, but now it's kind of evolved into cool stuff, but looking at tonight's lineup, I'd say we're kind of going back to our roots here.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000
All three of these songs look to be songs that will be made for Bamani, so this should be a fun Cage Match tonight.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
This is not mine.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
So make sure you are in, well, I'm just looking at your artists and knowing their music.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:17.000
If you want to vote, remember you have to be in our chat room, orangelaungeradio.com, click on chat, and then you'll be able to place a vote.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:26.000
So here we go! First up tonight is Loki, and he's actually the one who won three weeks ago, but we couldn't even remember what song it was, so we're giving him a new song tonight.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
What song are you putting in the cage match tonight?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Well, I've put this artist in a few times now, and since they have a new song that's going to be in DDR Extreme, I thought, hey, let's take a song from another game, Need for Speed Underground.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.000
And this is also featured in Tourney Mix 5, if anyone really gives a damn about that.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:53.000
But this is BT featuring Wildside with... I think it's Wildside or Wildstyle.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Okay, something... Wildside is the Irresistive Among band from Extreme, so I don't think it's that.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.800
It might be wild style, I think. Anyways, it's BT featuring wild style, um, and this is Kimo Sabe.

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.800
Alright, here it is.

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.800
That was in frequency.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.800
What's in frequency? Well, okay.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.800
It's either in frequency or amplitude, too.

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.800
Well, here it is. Enjoy it. BT, Kimo Sabe, song number one.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:53.800
The whole Stone Stone foundation plus the planet with more control

01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:00.800
The circle starts to form B-boys and B-girls start to swarm

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.800
Especially from the beginning of the night you know

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.800
Cause they like the song the hype is on

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.800
What we came to do is uplift you Shift the whole party and straighten it

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.800
You jump up to the ground in the front front to reach this is for the street

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.300
Come on!

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:11.800

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.300

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:12.800

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:13.800

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.300

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:14.800

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:15.300

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:15.800
9

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.300
10

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:16.800
11

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.300
12

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:17.800
13

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.300
14

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:18.800
15

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.300
16

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:19.800
17

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.300
18

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:20.800
19

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.300
20

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:21.800
21

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.300
22

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:22.800
23

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:23.300
24

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:23.800
25

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.300
26

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:24.800
27

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.300
28

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:25.800
29

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.300
30

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:26.800
30

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.300
30

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:27.800
31

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.300
32

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:28.800
33

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.300
33

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:29.800
34

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.300
35

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:30.800
36

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.300
37

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:31.800
38

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.300
39

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:32.800
40

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.300
40

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:33.800
41

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.300
42

01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:34.800
43

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.300
44

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:35.800
45

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.300
45

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:36.800
46

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.300
47

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:37.800
47

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.300
48

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:38.800
48

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.300
49

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:39.800
49

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.800
Trying to build up a mind-typical, cutting even, divinical, unidentical

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.800
Which America's stereotype is typical

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.800
That expectation was visible, make money residual

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.800
Without fame, used physically

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.800
We'll resurrect the Earth from Earth and push the dead

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.800
Spread the bottle, cross the globe like they was down to scratch

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.800
That's what we need, my mobility

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800
With the millennium, get it?

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.800
And then when Jack steps out of perfect venom

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.800
I'm venom, venom, I'm venom

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.800
Buh-duh-buh-buh, creativity

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.800
Buh-duh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.500
Well, now rock's a utility

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.700
No soul foundation plus no plan to the neighbors

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:07.800
More creative control to perfect

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.300
Montana-Jackson, full effect

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:10.300
Use the pull, I'm the effect

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.800
That means you're never control the pack

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.800
I'm a circle, stars are born

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.800
Chillin' people's every girl star to swarm

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.800
I'm all special from the getting of the night tomorrow

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:18.800
Cause a light is the spark

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.800
The light is the spark

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:20.300
Come on

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.800
Before he falls on the floor

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.300
Before he falls on the floor

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:32.300
Full Effect

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.300
Full Effect

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.300
Brothers caught in a lot and I wishin' they was like on top of the world

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:38.300
Realize they were calm and refer to hip-hop as a girl

01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:40.300
Cause back in junior class my cats had bumped the tour

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:42.300
Remember to face well cause I wish they met a sooner

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.300
Fortunately I stepped two and it had to be a dope strategy

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.300
She was leavin' to an academy

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.300
Can I have your digits? I'm travelin' it's hard to get at me

01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.300
What's your major by the way? Modular Activity

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.300
I slap, I trap, energy, backflip, I'm on abstract captivity

01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.300
When I rock creativity

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.300
I bust positive vibes from the west to Maui

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.300
Lupek is the antidote created in Cali

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:26.340
Alrighty, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, BT with Kimo Sabe.

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:30.060
is a part of the show where we go Simon Cowell on all these songs and we give

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:33.880
our opinion but our opinion doesn't count it's your votes to do but we want

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:43.360
to help you make that vote. Jamie. I like BT, it gets an 8. I just heard that song a whole lot.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:49.740
All right. Logie. It's my favorite song in tourney mix 5, so it gets a 10.

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:55.260
Interesting um to be honest I'm just that BT just doesn't do it for me like

01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:15.260
kostjamrh It's not gay enough, I think that's what it is.

01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:21.900
wild side i got excited but no it was wild child all right uh moving on song number two in tonight's

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:27.020
cage mesh comes to us from jamie and i gotta say i'm a little bit surprised at her pick but let's

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:34.140
let's see what's up my song has the power of cord behind it it's uh tracy lord let's say something

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:39.820
i okay this is the thing is i went on a big downloading speed trying to find this one tracy

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.540
Lord's song it's and if anyone knows what this is please tell me I'm in the

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:48.360
chat room right now 7 a.m. it's one about this woman getting revenge on a

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:56.620
cowboy it's I've not fallen angel it's not fallen angel I have a remix of a

01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:07.460
Tracy Lord song done by Pollock and fold I heard I heard the song like when I was

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:12.820
in college the first time that was like in 95 and the CD was about a year old

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:17.060
then so if that helps anybody find the song for me but anyway this particular

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:21.700
one this one is like it definitely has the power of porn behind it because this

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:27.020
is like a song that someone would participate in nocturnal activities to

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:34.060
oh my nocturnal activities all right let's hear it then

01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:41.180
song number two in tonight's cage match Tracy Lord say something enjoy

01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:31.060
It's summer up in a small cave

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:49.820
I can see it all before me Here it comes now, it means nothing

01:34:49.820 --> 01:35:00.820
Just take some space, just take some space How did you know I am only here among us?

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:19.820
How did you know I am only here among us?

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:32.820
Oh

01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:04.820
Some are ashamed of me

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:13.820
I can see you fall before me

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:17.820
Oh, please

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.820
How did you know me?

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:23.820
How did you know me?

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:28.820
How did you know I am only here, mama

01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:33.120
Say something

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:42.520
How did you know I am only here and I'm not going to say something?

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:52.120
How did you know I am only here and I'm not going to say something?

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:58.020
How did you know I am only here and I'm not going to say something?

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:56.300
Song number two was right there. It was Tracy Lord's with Say Something. Say something about

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:59.300
What about that song, Jamie?

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:02.300
I like that song.

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:05.300
I mean, I'm going to give it an 8. She's done better.

01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:08.300
Apparently she sucks live.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:14.300
Imagine that! Porn star-given music career who can't really sing without a studio.

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.300
Dan said that he went to some show that was going on that had Moby and a bunch of people.

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.300
This was a few years ago.

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:25.300
He said that Moby got naked and tried scratching women.

01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:50.060
p0k3smot42o

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.060
T.J. Control.

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:56.060
Um, yeah, that's definitely a song to fuck to.

01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:03.060
Um, I don't know if I could imagine it on our station regularly, but, um, it's unique.

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.060
And it did get me a little horny. Just a little bit.

01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:07.060
Just kidding, just kidding.

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:11.060
Because I was looking at that magazine you're looking at. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:13.060
Okay, there's your music line.

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:15.060
You're listening to KTMi.

01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:20.060
I'm kidding. It was interesting. I give it like a seven and a half.

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.060
Because Tracey Lords is pretty cool.

01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:29.060
I don't get the slow comparison though. They're both slow songs, but Kylie's way different.

01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:33.060
Anyway, so there you have it. Your votes count though, not ours.

01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:36.060
There is one more song you get to vote for, possibly, if you want to.

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:43.060
And that's my pick. My pick is an artist that you've actually already heard on our station

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:47.240
heard on our station because she was on a Dance Mania album and she used to be

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.860
with a group you might have heard of them you know the spice girls you ever

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:58.840
heard of the spice girls laughing that's right well sporty spice has a solo

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.880
career believe it or not and she has some big dance hits I I too like Jamie

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.820
went on a downloading spree this week and I was downloading all these British

01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:09.700
dance compilations and this song turned up all one of them and I kind of liked

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:14.620
it so I'm gonna put in a nice cage match it's Melanie C and the song is yeah

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:19.900
yeah yeah and it's the Shanghai surprise remix wasn't that the movie with Madonna

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:27.220
and Sean Penn from like years ago Shanghai surprise I assure you this song

01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:31.440
is way better than the movie at least I think so all right the rest of you I

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:39.060
don't care what you think but we'll see hopefully you'll like it the chat room

01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:41.060
the listeners don't even know what you're doing over there.

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:43.060
I know, I'm not going to say any of this.

01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:44.060
You shouldn't, alright.

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:46.060
Um, oh, here comes Loki.

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:49.060
She's looking at Playgirl!

01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:52.060
Ewww!

01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.060
Okay, anyways.

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:56.060
Stop ruining the cage match!

01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:58.060
Alright, here it is, song number three.

01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:01.060
Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah, Shanghai Surprise.

Yeah, so inefficient, it's our decision

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.060
We're gonna have a good time

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:19.060
Oh, when there's pain in you

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:23.060

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:54.060
Got no intervention

01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:59.060
We're gonna have a good time, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:03.060

We're gonna have a good time

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:20.060
Can't have a good time

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:29.060
I've got desire

01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:33.060
I've been inspired

01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:36.060
I want so much higher

01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:40.060
Baby, I don't wanna come down

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:44.060
All I want is to be excited

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:47.060
So come on and get united

01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:52.060

Got the expectation

The clarification

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:25.040
We're gonna have a good time

Alrighty, song number three tonight, Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:56.940
What did you think?

01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:57.940
Yeah Yeah Yeah?

01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:58.940
Or, oh, hell no.

01:44:58.940 --> 01:44:59.940
Jamie?

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:00.940
It gets a yeah.

01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:05.540
I mean, it could, don't get me wrong, it's just kind of generic, you know?

01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:10.340
So it gets a six, seven-ish, seven-ish.

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:13.560
from janey lucky

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.420
i've heard this summer before i don't know if it's another artist

01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:17.940
on the right

01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:20.220
but i don't like the flight

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.320
i don't like melissa

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.100
living there didn't is

01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:26.180
you'd pictures

01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:27.660
so uh...

01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:32.780
yeah i give it a yeah yeah yeah five

01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:34.580
i don't know to me that's on it

01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:35.800
itself reddish

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.360
and it is like a song i would hear to soccer games seriously

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:46.360
uh... and that still fits forty-five outside football

01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.360
uh... so i could hear that uh... so i give it like a

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.920
i think i'll be fun to be here

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:55.800
and i do it in part of it again lately

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.000
all right now let's review of the uh... three songs before i open up the voting

01:45:59.000 --> 01:45:59.760
lines

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:03.240
here we go a review of the three times before tonight

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.680
because it is up to you

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:11.680
song number one BT featuring wild child Kimo Sabe

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:21.800
song number two tonight Tracy Lords with Say Something

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:27.300
If you hear them on my face, I'll say

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:33.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so inefficient

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:51.840
Just send Skye a message in the chatroom with your vote.

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:58.040
Winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:01.880
Meanwhile, back to some of the news we missed the three weeks we were out.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:07.880
You know, another article that came out while we were gone was on the Fox News Channel.

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:12.160
Fox News Channel, you guys know Fox News Channel? Home of the Bill O'Reilly show and all those

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.760
fun conservative talk programs?

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.760
If I didn't watch TV.

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.760
Okay, well, I know you don't watch TV.

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.760
I think I know, though.

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.240
They're giving CNN a little bit of a run, because they have some talk programs that

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:25.520
people for some reason like, but whatever, I won't hate right now. But actually they

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:33.000
ran an article about DDR and a weight loss article. It's again another, isn't DDR great

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.560
because people lost weight playing it, but this article quotes some friends of the show.

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:44.280
Some buddies of Orange Launch Radio were quoted in this article and Mel B and Sharks Girl

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.140
were both quoted in this article which I thought was cool. Yeah, so good for them. There's

01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:53.000
a link to it over there on a website. I'll kind of summarize for you guys. It's just

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:59.400
kind of talking about how it breaks down how to play DDR, how DDR is played. Says the assistant

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:02.360
editor at Wired magazine, you're literally controlling the game with your whole body

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.940
and not just your fingertips. It's definitely a new genre that will probably get bigger.

01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:13.420
That will probably. It might get a little bigger.

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:16.440
It might. Assuming it doesn't kill off its players with

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:19.440
heart attack

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.600
uh...

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.960
uh... relatively new genre i don't know about you guys i've known about this

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.720
game for

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.320
damn near four years now i don't know that for us to you guys but

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.240
that's not that new

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:39.240
well i'm sorry but it's not old school like christ

01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:42.440
as like way old school man

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:48.800
DDR is a lot better. He's probably talking about the history of time thing. That would

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:54.640
be relatively new. You're right. Considering the entire history of time, it would be new.

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:59.280
And considering that a lot of people who watch Fox News Channel are old people, it would

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:05.720
make sense. Anyway, our buddy Mel Balthazar says he was drawn to DDR because he likes

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:09.520
music-based games, but after a while he noticed an unexpected side benefit.

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:18.040
in the first no not heart attacks in the first four months or so I lost around

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.000
30 pounds actually it would it from Mel would have sounded something like this

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.600
your dog in the first 40 months or so dog I lost around 30 pounds dog I'm just

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.120
kidding I'm kidding he's gonna kick my ass well you know

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.560
cuz he did Randy Jackson DRI don't it's a joke it's a joke Jesus in about six to

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:42.840
months I went from 280 to 230. I play nowadays to keep in shape more than anything. Very

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:49.380
interesting. Uh, DDR fan Melody Hommen, also known as SharksGirl on this program, uh, also

01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:54.980
shed pounds while she played going from about 220 to 143 at her lowest weight. I never realized

01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:59.340
that she lost that much weight playing DDR. I never knew that. SharksGirl's like one of

01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:06.060
my best buds. I never knew that she went from 220 to 143 from DDR. I know, I'm a bad friend.

01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:08.980
She should so fire me!

01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:10.440
I just didn't know.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.520
Well, that's great.

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.120
She says, I'm significantly lighter than when I wasn't playing, she said. You're not just

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.520
using your hands, you're actually getting up and doing something.

01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:25.960
With the obesity epidemic in America reaching EPIC proportions, I think it would have been better if they said biblical proportions,

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:29.400
and video games, the internet and television accused of being among the culprits, entertainment that

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:33.360
combines physical activity with technology could be the wave of the future.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.180
said sport wall founder and CEO Kathy Lamberti,

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:40.640
we have to give them the computer game packaged with their physical fitness

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.980
otherwise they're not going to be interested.

01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:46.520
Kids have changed, they've been taught how to be entertained and seduced

01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:49.080
by technology.

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.360
Seduced by technology, that's...

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.220
oooh...

01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:56.040
DDR is going to seduce you.

01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.960
Yeah I know, I get it hard on every time I pirate movies.

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:10.680
technology sir knows how to seduce me. Mel had another quote in here. There's that stigma

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:15.200
that people who play video games are slobs who just sit on the couch. I always thought

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:21.260
that was true actually. In DDR it's more of an interactive experience where you're putting

01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:26.960
yourself into the game. Now I don't know about you guys, but I got the DDR for Xbox this

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.860
this week, well not this week, but a couple weeks ago, and I've been playing on Xbox Live,

01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:36.580
and my fat ass has been on the couch schooling people by playing on the controller, so, and

01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:47.760
I've been having lots of fun. To date, Konami Digital Entertainment, which distributes DDR,

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:57.280
has sold more than 6.5 million copies worldwide and 1 million in the United States.

01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:01.740
And let's see, oh Jason Enos had a quote in here too, this is a game that defies all the

01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:08.440
other games out there because the person has to get up and do the work. Interesting. And

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:14.720
then it talks about this other thing called the Scooby Ball. The Scooby Ball. The Scooby

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:22.140
ball. It's DDR and the Scooby Ball. In Scooby Ball, kids play in a portable enclosed playground.

01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:26.100
Both music signals and voice prompts guide them to lighted targets which they hit with

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:39.420
balls to score points. Scooby Ball. Go figure. Lucky, why don't you share with us what's

01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:43.380
going on in the sim scene these days? I know there's got to be some news these past few

01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:48.740
weeks. Well, Tournemix is still going, right? What's up? I think it's still going. I don't

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:55.860
know. Last release I got was number four, and I haven't seen anything since then. I

01:52:55.860 --> 01:53:01.660
mean, I've looked. It's just nothing, but I don't know if they're like, you know, still

01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:09.180
voting or what the hell's going on, but yeah, there's four sections for Tournemix. Checking

01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:14.940
right now see if there's number five nope just bracket four still so

01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:21.440
apparently bracket four rounds up the end of tourney mix five but you know

01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:27.440
what no one cares there's yeah wasn't that many good stuff to be honest it's

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.480
still like the same five percent of the songs are decent then two percent are

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:37.260
good and the rest suck but um some other interesting stuff if you're a tourney mix

01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:49.260
On DDRUK's forums, they've got in the music production thread, DJ Damien's V-Rare CD that he put out. Basically, it's a zip file of all of his songs that he's made.

01:53:49.260 --> 01:54:00.260
They're okay. They've got, you know, your famous Art Art 2, and then, you know, the Legend of Art that were featured in Turning Mix 1, 2, and 4, I think.

01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:10.260
And, um, what else? Ah, just some other crap that he's done. But if you, you know, want something to download on your board, there you go.

01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:12.420
There you go.

01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:15.980
Aside from that, really not too much going on.

01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:17.540
There is some interesting stuff, though.

01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:25.000
I noticed that since DDRUK has their StepMania machine, which is DDX, or Dance something

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.240
or other, I don't know, whatever, anyways, it's got internet rankings, which I'm assuming

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:36.760
is probably something that's thrown into StepMania now, so, you know, hey, look for internet

01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:40.760
that rankings will be coming soon. As well as extended light support, people are working

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:46.880
on that right now. There's talks about using serial ports, maybe USB ports for lights.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:53.360
Right now, parallel ports are, you know, supported, so there's information on DDR Maniacs for

01:54:53.360 --> 01:55:00.120
that. Tons more sim files for download on BomaniStyle and their sim file database. A

01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:04.840
lot of them suck though, but hey, you know, look at the rankings on the sides to get an

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.220
idea what might be good and what's not. Aside from that, really not too much stuff going

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:19.680
on. No new alphas for StepMania released. It's just been kind of slow. Slow news week.

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:29.340
No service pack 6 stuff for, you know, Ultramix, which we did not mention. You know, because

01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:38.340
That is news and all. Nothing yet because it has not come out yet, and I don't know. That's pretty much all that's going on.

01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:48.340
There's a nice thread, though, on the DDRManiaX's setmania theme boards that they're basically how-to guides to make your skin better, which is cool.

01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:56.340
And it just proves that you can make a sim that looks exactly like In the Groove, so yeah.

01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:20.340
Anyways, I kind of agree. Somebody in the chat room said DJ Damien's kind of crap stuff. Maybe it's just because I'm not a cool kid, but I don't get the joke. It's not funny, and it's kind of stupid to me. Yeah, I guess it's just British. Like Spice Girls, I get that. DJ Damien, I don't get it. Yes, Jamie?

01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:22.340
About him being crabby?

01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:24.340
Yeah.

01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:26.340
Oh, you picked up the microphone, so I thought you were going to say something.

01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:28.340
I don't get it.

01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:30.340
Yeah. Have you heard his stuff?

01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:32.340
No.

01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:36.340
Play Jamie a little bit of one of these songs. Play the best one.

01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:38.340
The best one.

01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.340
The best one.

01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:42.340
I can't wait to hear this.

01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:47.340
I don't think this should be getting any airtime on the show, but since Loki brought it up...

01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:57.340
Sure. Ballad of Tom Jones. Let's hear a little bit of this.

01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:02.340
Put it in the middle somewhere.

01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:08.340
Let's move up with your reach, I've ended up dead

01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:12.340
You thought that I'm killing each other

01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:17.340
You never know, I'll let you save my life

01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:19.340
I'm gonna throw up

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:23.340
Show me the door, but now I'm on top, you fucks will fall

01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.340
Screw this shit, I'm done, making trash ain't fun

01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:29.340
And you're trying to make stuff, pick it up, you're up

01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:31.340
i remember that

01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:33.340
alright, turn off, turn off

01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:35.340
stop it

01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:37.340
oh god that's horrible

01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:39.340
see i don't, i don't get it

01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:41.340
why do you think he's good?

01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:43.340
i don't get it

01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:45.340
you know what it is? it's the william hung of ddr

01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:47.340
that is exactly what it is

01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.340
but william hung is good

01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:51.340
compared to this guy

01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:55.340
the new song from our other listener.

01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:24.340
Finally, this should be a big surprise to you guys.

01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:28.340
Loki, BT with Kimo Sari.

01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:31.340
That's who I would have voted for.

01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:33.340
You wouldn't have even voted for the own song you put in?

01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:37.340
No, because I have come very close to using that song before.

01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:40.340
I thought that I might have, but it was another song.

01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:43.340
If I'm going to be gone for two weeks, I'm going to give you guys such crap songs

01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:45.340
to play in cage match while I'm gone. I can't wait.

01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:47.340
I'll pick them for you, Rob.

01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:49.340
No, I already have them lined up.

01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:51.340
I already have them lined up.

01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:54.340
So tune in next week. I'll be there in spirit.

01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:56.340
Alright.

01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:58.340
Just...

01:58:58.340 --> 01:59:03.340
When we come back from this next break, boys and girls, the FUs of the week, I know you've got some rants in you.

01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:05.340
Um, send them...

01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:07.340
What'd you say, Jamie?

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:08.340
I made a request.

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:10.340
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, I thought you said...

01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:13.340
When I said, I know you got some rants in you, I thought you said, a ton.

01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:16.340
Yeah, a ton of those, too.

01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:24.460
Okay, um, so, uh, yeah, we'll, um, get to the FUs of the week, so send those in over

01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:27.380
a private message.

01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:28.820
And we'll take care of that.

01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:32.440
In the meantime, more pop and music songs this break, including one Jamie wants to hear.

01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.000
She always wants to hear this song.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.180
You know what's sad, though?

01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:39.260
I lost my folder of the pop and nine consumer songs.

01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:40.260
Have them.

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:41.260
Good, because I need to get them for you.

01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:42.260
Because I don't have Don't Cry Jesus anymore.

01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:43.260
I'll get it when I get home.

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.260
You can send it to me.

01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:45.460
Because when I, my desktop got erased.

01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:48.040
Imagine if Loki's desktop got erased, that's what I mean.

01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:49.040
Rob!

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.040
Rob!

01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:51.040
Rob!

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:52.040
Rob!

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:53.040
Rob!

01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:54.040
Rob!

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:55.040
Rob!

01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:56.040
Don't cry!

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.040
Alright, we'll be back after some more popin music.

01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:00.800
Start off with Gachimon and some more stuff in here and when we come back, FUs of the

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:01.800
week!

02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:12.920
Send them now!

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.840
Tare da, tare da, tare da, tare da, tare da

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:18.120
Sora no kaneta ni no gojukage

02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:25.140
Uchiro itu basa no gachiman

02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:28.620
Niho shi o kage senroida seba

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:32.020
Ihigaki ni o hito todida

02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:35.720
Tōbe, tobe, tobe, gachiman

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.720
Yukai, yukai, yukai, gachiman

02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:52.720
Jijuu wa ito-ji, Jijuu wa ito-ji, Oh gachama, gachama

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:27.720
Get your man, get you, what he told you

02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:31.720
Get you, what he told you

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:37.720
Go get your man, get your man

02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:33.720
But it ain't

02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:37.720
You think you can say it, girl, it ain't

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:40.720
People be doin' what you can

02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:45.720
Trash hearts, livid me, I ain't cheatin' for none

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:48.720
I don't like it, girl

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:51.720
You're not a girl, you're found

02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:53.720
But it's true

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:55.720
When you get down on your way

02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:58.720
Come along, you're in the sun on

02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:00.720
This is the end

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:39.320
Hey, did you hear about that show?

02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:40.320
What show?

02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:43.560
Well, they play a lot of greats and money and video game music, but if you listen to

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:45.600
it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:47.320
Oh, I've heard of that station.

02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:48.320
Really?

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:50.680
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:53.320
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:54.320
Well, you die.

02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:55.320
I what?

02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.320
Hey, wait!

02:05:56.320 --> 02:06:00.120
Wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:02.120
Aaaaaaahh!

02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:05.120
Orange Launch Radio, listen, or die!

02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:08.120
Stop it Dave!

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:15.120
Welcome back to Orange Launch Radio, we're going to get into the FUs of the Week very shortly.

02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:21.120
Umm, gosh I'm not sure what else is going on in the mining world right now.

02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:24.120
Loki you seem to be more on top of things than I am.

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:52.120
What is it you're checking out there? This is, uh, like I was saying earlier, their, um, DDR UK's Dance, um, with Dance DX, and they're on their version 2 now, and I'm gonna, in just one second here, uh, link the chat room to their gallery for this, which it's actually, it's a very well-put-together set-mania machine, I might add, and they have a lot of people working on it, and it's the way I wish, uh, Golf Land would work,

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:55.480
work, where you have more than one person working on it.

02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:58.860
What exactly is going on with that thing? And even our chat room's curious, because

02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:01.140
it's been three weeks since we really had an update, and I know there's kind of some

02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:05.740
stuff going on. What exactly happened with that EX2 project you've been really heavily

02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:06.740
involved with?

02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:11.920
Keith broke the motherboard. That's pretty much what it comes down to. And no, I'm not

02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:16.960
going to go buy a new motherboard, because as it was, I put more time and effort into

02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:21.580
it than was needed. And that's what it sounds like he wants me to do, is get a new motherboard

02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:25.980
for it I'm like no so you know whatever happens happens they got their money out

02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:32.200
of it I got my money out of it so no one's at a real loss sucks for them

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:37.720
because they rewired their whole cabinet but you know I you know someday I guess

02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:41.540
we can put any motherboard in it but I really it's just pain the ass the way it

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:47.520
was set up and things don't work that should work it's just really annoying

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:50.520
Any chance you'll do a cabinet for a different arcade?

02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:46.520
It's free to sell, do whatever you want with it. As long as you keep the development team's credit in there, which that's already hard programmed into it. So, technically, yeah, I could go out there, make an upgrade for an arcade and sell it and make money off of it. So, I'm looking into it.

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:48.520
No, I wonder how many people are going to steal your idea right there.

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:49.520
Check your legal channels.

02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:50.520
Huh?

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:51.520
Check your legal channels.

02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:52.520
Yeah.

02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:53.520
Just cover your butt.

02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:56.520
But I figure if they can get away with that megamix thing.

02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:57.520
Here's what it is.

02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:02.520
I don't have to check any legal channels because all I'm doing is providing the hardware.

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.520
And the program to run it.

02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:05.520
They made the program.

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:07.520
I made the hardware.

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:08.520
There's nothing I can get in trouble for.

02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:09.520
What about music?

02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:10.520
Licensing.

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:11.520
What do you mean?

02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:12.520
That's the program.

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:14.520
That's all StepMania.

02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:15.520
That's their licensing.

02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:19.680
their problem all I'm doing is making the hardware set up for it so there's no

02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:25.000
way I can get in trouble for building a PC that's you know they can try but you

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:31.360
know it's not gonna work so that's that's if I were to do it and if the

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:36.580
coppers ever come after me Loki did it he had the gun it was Loki with a

02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:42.840
revolver in the conservatory I saw it with my own eyes let's get on with the

02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:45.220
the FUs of the Week, shall we?

02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:48.220
What do we do during the FUs of the Week, Miss Jamie?

02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:55.220
We bit your moon.

02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:11.060
I really miss that music. I really, really miss that. I'm going to keep it for a while.

02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:18.060
Anyway, my first F.U. of the week goes toward people who go 15 miles under the speed limit

02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:23.060
when I'm wanting to go 10 over it. Damn them.

02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:37.060
Also, it goes to the Safeway over on Madison, like on the way here, for not carrying I.M.'s cat food, which is what I feed Sherman.

02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:42.060
A big effigy goes to cat food in general to having their first product be wheat.

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:49.060
Okay, what cat? Have you ever seen a stray cat go up and want wheat?

02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:54.060
No, they're going to go after the open can of tuna that's sitting around by the trash can.

02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:57.060
They're going to go kill a bird or a squirrel.

02:10:57.060 --> 02:11:00.060
Rob, have you ever known of any cats that go after wheat?

02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:02.060
I can't say I have.

02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:04.060
Have you ever met a vegetarian cat?

02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:05.060
I can't say I have.

02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:13.780
And Shermy got really, really fat when I was feeding her the other kind of cat food that

02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:14.980
had meat.

02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:19.540
And then I switched over to cat food that had meat as the first product.

02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:21.920
And lo and behold, she lost weight.

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:26.980
And by the way, cats eat grass because they can puke it back up and get stuff out of their

02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:27.980
situation.

02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:28.980
Okay?

02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:29.980
That's why cats eat grass.

02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:30.980
Thank you.

02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:31.980
And I kid you not.

02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:32.980
Watch cats.

02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:40.580
grass then they hack it all back up yeah any animal will do that let's go eat grass and throw it up

02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:45.540
let's go make mud pies jamie yeah okay

02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:59.460
anyway um another fu goes toward a lack of money a lack of time a big fu goes consistent

02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:10.980
Also, an F.U. goes towards stupid people, and that don't mean people who just don't

02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:11.980
understand.

02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:17.140
You know, people who, well, there's types of stupidity.

02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:22.340
The stupidity I'm referring to is lack of common sense, okay, for the people who should

02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:25.700
not be involved in any part of the gene pool.

02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:31.700
These are the people that I would like removed from my universe.

02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:37.700
Another F.U. goes toward myself for having all of these ideas for writing

02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:40.700
and just not being able to get them out of my head.

02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:43.700
I hate writer's block with an unholy passion.

02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:45.700
It's been driving me nuts.

02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:48.700
So, an F.U. to writer's block.

02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:51.700
An artist's block, although I had started drawing again.

02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:53.700
I'm doing a commission drawing right now.

02:12:53.700 --> 02:13:03.580
Another F.U. goes toward my college, but, okay, this is what I don't get, and this may

02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:06.240
be a little bit technical for some people.

02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:10.480
When you take out a student loan, if you're going for federal loans and you have to fill

02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:14.720
out your FAFSA, it's a free application for federal student aid, so that your school will

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:20.320
know how much your family makes, or if you're an independent student, how much you make.

02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:25.640
So I can understand that since they're doing a federal loan, they need to see how much

02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:27.320
you are going to be eligible for.

02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:34.520
But why on earth do I need to fill out a FAFSA for a private loan, okay?

02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:38.560
I sort of see the reason behind it, it's just a big pain in the ass right now.

02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:43.000
So I got to go out and I've done my FAFSA already, I just have to wait on the school

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.800
to get my student aid report so I can get my award letter, so I can apply for the loan

02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:49.180
so I can get my laptop.

02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:59.940
I need a laptop because I'm going into database management and another F.U. goes toward being

02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:01.460
really homesick lately.

02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:11.500
I just wanted to go back home for a little while and not have the money to do it in the

02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:18.500
you go to stores, just being the busy time you're at work, and that's about it. But yeah,

02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:19.500
I'm really hungry.

02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:20.500
Aww.

02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:21.500
Well.

02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:23.500
Alright then, moving on.

02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:26.500
Morkie, your turn. What's pissing you off this week?

02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:31.500
I forgot about this song.

02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:39.500
Um, number one, uh, I don't really know. It's like, it's been so long.

02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:43.500
First off, of course, Fuck You is a safe and sane firework.

02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:53.500
They're really lame, and when you have a firework that lasts shorter, you know, the matched lighting lasts longer than the actual firework.

02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:57.500
I've had orgasms that lasted longer than some of those fireworks, seriously.

02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:05.500
I mean, it's just like really pathetic. You're like, wow, you know, lighting a candle would have been more exciting than this firework.

02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:10.620
So, that really sucks, but luckily we know how to get our money out of Safe and Same

02:15:10.620 --> 02:15:20.620
Fireworks. That's burnt packaging that they come in. So, hooray. Number two goes to the

02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:29.260
heat. I don't like it. It's been pretty hot. I don't like it being nice and cool out. You

02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:34.260
comfy, Bay Area weather. Don't like this dry heat. Sucks.

02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:36.260
Um, also, um...

02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:40.260
Just be glad that this isn't the South Shore. It's very humid.

02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:50.260
Also, of course, you know, after seeing Fahrenheit 9-11 again, and, uh, Buck Bush, just because, you know, he's stupid.

02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:57.260
And, um, really, I'm not that pissed off at stuff that much.

02:15:57.260 --> 02:16:09.260
Fuck you, the retarded people on Final Fantasy XI. I mean, there's some really dumb people out there. I guess pretty much everyone. There's a lot of dumb people everywhere. I really hate dumb people and many of the children.

02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:21.260
And fuck you, the goddamn DDREX2 thing being broken again. It's like, I can't fix that machine enough. And that's why I have to be at the point to where I say, you know, fuck it, I don't care.

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:29.260
And once again, fuck you to Keith, because that promise he made that I would get to dismantle the BeatMania machine and take some of the parts for it, because you're gonna get rid of it anyways.

02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:32.260
Well, he did it without me and threw the machine away. So, fuck him.

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:35.260
And, um...

02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.260
Yeah, that's really all I have. I'm- I'm just done.

02:16:39.260 --> 02:16:40.260
I- I'm just...

02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:44.260
And I don't know what the hell, my PC, like, instantly restarted today.

02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:50.260
Like, when, when I was gonna log out of Final Fantasy, just the whole PC restarted, so I had to figure out what's wrong with that.

02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:55.260
So all I did today was open the case up. I touched nothing inside, opened the case up

02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:58.260
because I noticed there was a lot of dust on the outside and I wanted to see how much

02:16:58.260 --> 02:17:03.260
it collected on the inside. Opened it up, looked inside, closed case done, and it goes

02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:10.260
and gets all fucked up, so. Oh, and fuck you to CoolWebSearch for hijacking Internet Explorer.

02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:15.260
Internet Explorer is completely useless for a while, so you know what, that's why I'm

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:21.340
firebox now fuck you microsoft and i'm done

02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:23.420
did you have something you want to add jamie

02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:27.180
i happened to remind you

02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:30.460
spammers can go to hell

02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:33.180
my turn

02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:37.340
um an fu to having the hiccups for two weeks or not that no it wasn't that one

02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:42.620
three days um and uh that really sucked

02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:48.380
and uh... an f you to my work wanting to send me away for two weeks

02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:51.340
uh... my work must anyway for two weeks and that's the end of this all this

02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:52.380
stuff is going on

02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:55.980
my friend that's in iraq right now is going to be home and let me go on

02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:58.340
uh... i was going to get tickets

02:17:58.340 --> 02:17:59.980
uh... well fight

02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:03.060
backed up sharks rose to treat me to elana's concert

02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:04.620
and i'll get to go to that now

02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:08.820
might be here

02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:12.380
uh... and yeah so

02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:14.980
What else was I going to miss? There was something else big I'm missing, let's forget.

02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:19.680
I'm missing this show twice in a while, but you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.

02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:22.880
Real life sucks sometimes.

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:27.980
Also an FU to Golfland and Scandia together

02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:33.080
for helping make Sacramento Arcades a peak fat joke. I hate living here.

02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:36.180
Actually, no, I really like living here, but as a gamer, it's pathetic.

02:18:36.180 --> 02:18:40.480
Honestly, there's no arcades in Sacramento. None.

02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:43.480
I miss the game room. I miss it so much. You know why I miss the game room?

02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:47.480
Because they didn't have ticket machines at the game room. That is why I miss them.

02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:50.480
They were all about fighting games.

02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:54.480
I would rather have the fighting game crowd than the birthday crowd, and that's sad.

02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:56.480
And they had victory.

02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:59.480
Yes, they did. And they had pinball games, too, which made me happy.

02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:02.480
I just, I can't stand it. I've had it. I've had my limit.

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:06.480
I've reached my limit of putting up with kids and teenagers.

02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:11.960
fucking like 15 16 year olds like I know a lot of 15 16 year olds listen to this

02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:15.360
program and so I'm not I'm not trying to be generalizing but I'm talking about

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:19.680
those kids that probably pick on you at school well those guys you hang out at

02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:26.400
the arcade too and they're such asses I mean my god I wanted an F you to their

02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:30.760
parents for making them I wish you would have aborted those

02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:32.760
child

02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:34.760
you know

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:36.760
he could be able to

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:38.760
fix the problems at

02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:40.760
golf land if it weren't for the kids like ripping

02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:42.760
shit off the game

02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:44.760
you know before you used to be ripping keys off the

02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:46.760
keyboard mania and changing diapers

02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:48.760
and changing diapers on them and now

02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:50.760
it's ripping the cymbals off the drums

02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:52.760
or just chunks of

02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:54.760
the cymbals but

02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:56.760
golf lands defense they did at a subway

02:19:56.760 --> 02:19:58.760
and that makes me happy

02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:07.760
I don't fucking go there to eat Subway. I go there to play DDR, not be harassed and get the shit thrown at me. I'm just sick of it.

02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:10.760
There's no arcades in this town anymore.

02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:12.760
Till I open my dream arcade.

02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:16.760
If I feel like just going somewhere to be a bitch, I'll just go to Golf Land and have people thrown out.

02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:19.760
Well, maybe we should just go there regularly and have people thrown out regularly. That makes me feel better.

02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:21.760
Probably be wonders for my morale.

02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:26.760
I think we should do it. We could have like a squad name or something.

02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:28.760
Alright, let's move on.

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:30.760
The arcade protection agency.

02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:32.760
Got a small story about that.

02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:34.760
It was really small.

02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:42.760
There was our friend, Mr. Pirate Power, that's in, I don't know, Toady, I guess.

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:45.760
I want to get him on the show sometime because he's actually pretty funny.

02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:48.760
I think he'd be pretty good for a guest on the show, but anyway.

02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:51.760
Anyway, so he was down at Golf Land with prestige and stuff there,

02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:54.760
and some stupid kid came up on him just acting like an ass,

02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:56.760
They scared him and he ran out. That was funny.

02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:03.760
I thought there was more to this story. I thought you would have, like, how he was thrown out or what was said.

02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:09.760
I thought he was volunteering to sign up for the arcade ejection squad.

02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:13.760
Anyway, moving on.

02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:16.760
Yeah, AES. The Arcade Ejection Squad.

02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:18.760
Fuck up! Get out of here!

02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:27.760
We should totally start a website.

02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:30.760
I'm loving this idea.

02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:33.760
We're going to single-handedly save this arcade scene in this town.

02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.760
All right, moving on.

02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:37.760
Well, we did once by putting all of these pictures of the broken machines.

02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.760
That's very true.

02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:40.760
That's very true.

02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:41.760
We ought to do that again.

02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:42.760
We ought to do that again.

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:45.760
But this time we should send them, like, the media and stuff.

02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:50.760
Anyway, let's go to the chat room, F.U.s, shall we?

02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:54.760
VxJasonXV says, one simple F.U.

02:21:54.760 --> 02:22:01.760
F.U. to having a job and not yet actually working, thus not having income.

02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:04.760
DDR Angel says, only one F.U. this week.

02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:08.760
I'd like to say F.U. to one of my coworkers who thinks that he should control my schedule at work

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:10.760
when he doesn't even have the authority to touch it.

02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:13.760
If I'm scheduled until 10, leave it at 10.

02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:17.260
I can't stay a half hour, even if you wanted me to, so get over it!

02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:20.760
At least I'll be out of that hellhole soon, that is all, goodbye.

02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:22.760
You know she's moving up here pretty soon.

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:26.760
She'll get out of the, uh, place she's in.

02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:29.760
Then we'll hear more local FUs, anyway.

02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:34.760
Um, sharksgirl says, uh, great, she says, uh, F you to your work.

02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:39.760
My work. F you disguise work for making you go away so you miss our date.

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:44.760
I won't be able to put out for her. I promised I would put out because she bought the tickets and everything, so.

02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:49.760
She says she figures if nothing else Mel's her default, but he just wouldn't appreciate it.

02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:54.760
I'm sure Mel would accept the putting out, though, huh?

02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:59.760
Jamie's raising her hand. You should talk to Jamie.

02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:04.760
Don't count me out yet, though. The way my work works, just you wait. I won't be gone till September.

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:09.760
Lach has two FUs, one is a couple weeks old and then the new one.

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:13.760
Number one is this girl named Lauren who I thought everything was going well with.

02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:18.760
After dating for a month, I got told that she was dating someone else by her best friend and she wasn't going to even tell me.

02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:20.760
So FU there.

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:22.760
High school drama.

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:23.760
High school drama.

02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:26.760
I don't even think he's in high school though, I think he's older than that.

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:29.760
I don't know the age of all our listeners.

02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:30.760
It's drama.

02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:36.060
I'm, I'm, we're in the old demographic here in the studio, that's the interesting part.

02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:41.560
Locke also says, F you to people who cannot discuss politics by, without getting pissed off.

02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:45.260
And also those who believe that you are not allowed to have an opinion yourself,

02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:49.060
and unless you agree with them completely in politics, that they won't talk to you.

02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:54.760
Replace politics with religion, and I had a frustrating experience like that the other day.

02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:58.260
You know what, if anything that anyone has a strong opinion about,

02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:05.260
they get all closed-minded about. Everyone has a right to an opinion, you know.

02:24:08.260 --> 02:24:12.980
Blair O'Nai says, F you Dr. Atkins. If I hear low-carb or Atkins-friendly, I swear I will

02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:17.300
break my TV. I mean, I bet half the people on Atkins who haven't read the books don't

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:23.020
know that carb is short for carbohydrate or that fruits have them. Also, I doubt many

02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:26.780
know that all the fucking heart problems Atkins had when he died.

02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:33.340
What's that was debatable because they said he also that died from falling. No the active site gives you gout

02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:36.180
I thought you're gonna say yeah

02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:43.180
But eating all that meat with a lot of gas like that. It also gives you bad breath and affects your hormones and

02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:50.140
Like will eventually give you here. I have the miracle diet for you guys. Okay, we're gonna call it the banana diet

02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:52.340
Okay, and I want to put this on all the packaging

02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:56.300
We're gonna put this on like all these packages the banana diet friendly thing

02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:59.540
eat less

02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:01.740
exercise more

02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:08.760
John it's worked for me John

02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:12.220
John field says f you to my father

02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:17.700
But and just so you know when I say eat less that doesn't mean you do the Mary Kate Olsen thing and not eat at

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:24.700
soft, you just eat less. If you're eating a whole pie, eat half the pie. Instead of

02:25:26.180 --> 02:25:30.940
not eating, do crackles, just like the Olsen twins. Cause that's step two in Matt's great

02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:37.940
plan to get them naked. No, it is, it is what you eat as much as how much of it you eat.

02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:46.500
You know, just don't eat processed food. Go cook a meal. You know, get some, some, you

02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:53.500
some, you know, steak, cook it on your Foreman Grill. Foreman Grill's awesome, you know.

02:25:53.780 --> 02:26:00.780
It's a matter of just eating real food. Look, I guarantee you, I challenge everybody, okay,

02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:09.120
for one week, you know, go grocery shopping and try it. Don't buy anything that has high

02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:13.980
fructose corn syrup in it. Try doing it for a week. I guarantee you, everything that you

02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:18.820
normally get, or most of everything that you get, has that as either a primary or at least

02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:19.820
a middle ingredient on it.

02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:20.820
Okay, I'm sorry.

02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:27.500
That's alright. Back to John Fields' FU. FU to my father, fuck having to get a job, fuck

02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:31.660
having to pay $500 for a tiny scratch on a bumper that happened in an accident. My life

02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:33.980
worth is now down to only $1,000.

02:26:33.980 --> 02:26:38.540
Hey, that's more than I've got today.

02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:39.540
on

02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:44.720
Evo Maoki 2DX says F.U. goes to idiot tourists on July 4th who thought that standing and

02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:47.880
blocking my view was going to give them a better view of the fireworks

02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:51.640
Oh and F.U. goes to F.O.G. for blocking out the fireworks in the first place

02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.800
And F.U. to idiot drivers trying to run me over on my way back to the BART station

02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:58.800
Oh and F.U. to the idiot drunk driver that took Satoshi's life

02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:04.620
I think we have another F.U. to address that I'll get that at the end here

02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:10.020
boy says neighbor kids suck they touch your drums then you tell them not to and

02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:13.820
then tell their soccer mom then they come back and taunt you then they get

02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:20.380
you in trouble I want to throw them off my house headfirst

02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:25.460
misty says this one goes to myself because I lost my wallet and all the

02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:29.740
important shit that I was stupid enough to keep in there I only hope I can find

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:33.500
it in the landfill that is my room I like I should go through the landfill

02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:43.000
And lastly, Mel B of RTF has an FU. He says FU to Richard Earl Sevets. Thanks a whole

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.500
freaking lot for taking the lives of a local DDR and his mom. I'm sure drinking before

02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:52.880
taking the wheel was worth it. You worthless fuck.

02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:57.460
Difficult times for the NorCal Bomani scene this week. I didn't know him personally, but

02:27:57.460 --> 02:28:03.040
I know a lot of people in NorCal knew Satoshi was his online name and passed away in a drunk

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:13.560
driving accident this week which is just a sad reminder about the effects of

02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:18.000
drunk driving so just remember if you're going to drink give a friend your keys

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.840
please do not drive notice when we do our drunk shows here on orange lounge we

02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:25.760
always have a backup plan for how we're all going to get home the fact that two

02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:30.140
of us live here helps I had I had you pick me up to bring me here and I had

02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:35.500
Dan take me home exactly I mean you know if if only everybody could be smart then

02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:39.340
we wouldn't have this bullshit happening and that's what it is it's bullshit

02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:46.180
shouldn't happen that is really sad I didn't better nail this guy's ass to the

02:28:46.180 --> 02:28:50.660
wall that's all I have to say I'm almost positive he died too but I'm not sure

02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:57.840
I'm not sure but you want to get some more black ops stuff maker of the

02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:13.240
I just have this thing, though, about the drunk drivers who live, that I am sort of

02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:19.280
glad that they live for one reason. Because dead people can't suffer. You can't make them

02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:20.280
suffer.

02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:22.400
That's a lot of guilt to have. I mean, a lot of...

02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.800
It's not even the guilt that I care about. I care about sitting them down and making

02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:32.600
them suffer repeatedly. I don't think a lot of drunk drivers are necessarily

02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:35.680
bad people. It doesn't matter.

02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:41.680
I know, I know, I know. It doesn't matter. They made a really horrible, bad, ignorant.

02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:43.280
It's an ignorant decision. They're ignorant people.

02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:47.880
I think that they need to be punished for it for the rest of their life.

02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:55.200
Whether they punish themselves or, you know, I think that if you are involved in a drunk

02:29:55.200 --> 02:30:00.520
driving accident and you were the drunk driver, you need to, for the rest of your life, have

02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:06.340
your driving privileges revoked. For the rest of your life. I don't care how God damn inconvenient

02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:08.300
it makes it on you, you do not deserve to drive.

02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:13.380
Take the bus! That's what it's for! More people should take the bus anyway, not that I should

02:30:13.380 --> 02:30:15.220
talk because I drive, but you know.

02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:19.100
Actually, I do have another-

02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:21.900
If I lived in a big city, I would take, like, the subway. Yes?

02:30:21.900 --> 02:30:23.900
I actually do have another few, by the way.

02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:30.900
I have an F you to the emissions commercials that they have on the radio here.

02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:35.900
Because I normally listen to the radio, but I have a big F you to the emissions one.

02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:39.900
Saying that, you know, drive your car less. Blah, blah, blah.

02:30:39.900 --> 02:30:43.900
Do you know who the cause of the emissions problem is in the state?

02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:45.900
It's freaking industry.

02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:52.900
You know, car emissions are negligible in comparison to these unregulated factories that we have floating around.

02:30:52.900 --> 02:31:00.720
around. So, you know what all that is? It's my whole theory on how government works, okay?

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:07.260
It's money. It's lobbyists. We are run by corporations. And it's these corporations

02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:12.380
that control what legislature gets passed. So, anyway.

02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:16.460
We had one more FU come in to kind of try and bring the mood back up here a little bit.

02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:21.060
D. Archaholic says, FU to Comcast for deleting our connection to Japan TV because it was

02:31:21.060 --> 02:31:27.600
a mistake and finding out that to get it back it cost $24 a month just for that one channel.

02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:32.180
I guess that means we probably lost it too, that makes me sad. I know, but that still

02:31:32.180 --> 02:31:38.800
makes me sad, it was a cool network. Oh well. What can you do? I think that's the station

02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:44.220
that plays a lot of the current Dorama series that come on TV. Yep, I'm almost positive

02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:48.220
I was watching one in Berkeley that was called Sakura.

02:31:48.220 --> 02:31:50.220
Oh well.

02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:53.220
Okay, so what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.

02:31:53.220 --> 02:31:58.220
When we come back, what we're going to do, we will do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:31:58.220 --> 02:32:01.220
And I also want to show something off.

02:32:01.220 --> 02:32:05.220
This computer upgrade has helped us be capable of doing something else here on the show

02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:08.220
that we will be incorporating in the show in the future.

02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:10.220
But we're going to kind of try it out tonight.

02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:13.220
I'm going to show it to you guys when we come back.

02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:14.700
Excuse me, front of the screen.

02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:17.700
Allow you to sing in sync with the song.

02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:19.000
That's one thing.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000
We're going to do that.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.820
We're going to have Ask Orange Lounge with synced music, for one.

02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:26.340
Send your questions over private message to Sky if you want to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:29.400
In the meantime, we've done a lot of pop and music stuff, so I think we need to get away

02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:32.860
from it and try some, how about some 2DX, I don't think we've played a single, oh, we

02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:36.020
did one 2DX song, that's not enough.

02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:37.020
You want to do Cracker?

02:32:37.020 --> 02:32:38.020
I want to hear Cracker.

02:32:38.020 --> 02:32:39.020
All right, we'll do some Cracker.

02:32:39.020 --> 02:32:42.020
And when we come back, Asgore's Lounge!

02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:11.020
You

02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:42.260

You must be, must be, you know that you're not the one that's lost

You gotta kick the neck, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be

02:35:29.460 --> 02:35:39.460
Can't make me feel that you're running with me, yeah

02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:49.460
Can't make me feel that you're running with me, yeah

02:35:49.460 --> 02:35:56.460
Whenever I'm fine

02:35:56.460 --> 02:36:03.460
I'm not prepared to say

02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:09.460
Whenever I'm fine

02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:16.460
I'm not prepared to say

02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:20.460
Whenever I fall

02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:26.460
It makes me happy

02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:52.860
Baby, it's on the go Baby, it's on the go

02:37:22.860 --> 02:37:33.860
I want you baby, maybe tonight I'll take you far away

02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:38.860
I'll see you dancing, shining like a jewel

02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:45.860
Burning for love In the golden light of love inside you

02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:51.860
My breath I have and your precious fire for me

02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:56.860

Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go

02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:11.860
Woah, baby, it's all just gold

02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:15.860
I'll shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow

02:38:27.860 --> 02:38:30.860
I need you, baby

02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:44.940
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:49.060
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:54.820
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:58.340
Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:03.780
We're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in just a moment, but first I want to show

02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:06.500
off a new feature that we're going to have very soon on the show.

02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:11.660
I'm just trying to think of ways to implement this in a non-Trainwreck sort of way.

02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:12.660
Oh yes!

02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:13.660
I hear a phone ringing!

02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:14.660
Hello?

02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:15.660
Hello, Orange Lounge?

02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:16.660
Yes!

02:39:16.660 --> 02:39:17.660
I just have one question.

02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:18.660
Yes!

02:39:18.660 --> 02:39:19.660
Can you hear me now?

02:39:19.660 --> 02:39:20.660
Yes, I can hear you now.

02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:21.660
Who is this?

02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:22.660
This is Jason.

02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:23.660
Hi, Jason.

02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:25.660
Yes, I can hear you now. Who is this?

02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:27.660
This is Jason.

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:30.660
Hi Jason. Is this TeVX JasonXV?

02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:32.660
You would be correct, sir.

02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:36.660
Oh, how you doing?

02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:38.660
I'm doing pretty good.

02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:40.660
That's good. This is exciting, isn't it?

02:39:40.660 --> 02:39:42.660
Now we can talk to our listeners.

02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:44.660
Sounds nice and smooth to me.

02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:47.660
Just so you know, this is not a regular phone connection, is it?

02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:48.660
Nope.

02:39:48.660 --> 02:39:49.660
No, this is actually...

02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:50.660
This is a digital connection.

02:39:50.660 --> 02:39:52.840
Yes, this is an all digital secure connection.

02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:54.940
We're using a program called Skype.

02:39:54.940 --> 02:39:56.740
You can download it at skype.org.

02:39:56.740 --> 02:39:57.900
It's completely free.

02:39:57.900 --> 02:39:58.900
You can spell it for everybody.

02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:04.380
S-K-Y-P-E. And when we get this running, which we will soon,

02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:05.660
you'll be able to call us.

02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:07.620
If you have a broadband connection, unfortunately,

02:40:07.620 --> 02:40:08.940
those of you with a modem connection,

02:40:08.940 --> 02:40:10.420
it's going to be too much for your connections.

02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:11.020
You're not going to be able to do it.

02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:12.600
But if you have a broadband connection,

02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:14.180
you will be able to interact with us.

02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:16.980
And we're not sure in what capacity yet.

02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:19.900
We're probably going to have to control it somehow.

02:40:19.900 --> 02:40:22.660
but you will be able to call the show and it'll be fun.

02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:25.180
And Jamie can yell at you in person, which will be great.

02:40:25.180 --> 02:40:27.820
And you know your phone bill has nothing to do with this.

02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:30.940
Yeah, this is not an actual phone line.

02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:34.820
This is the same thing as sending an IM to somebody just verbally.

02:40:34.820 --> 02:40:35.740
This is voice chat.

02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:37.320
It's just a voice chat program on that.

02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:40.820
It's like Xbox Live, except there's not people on it going,

02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:43.660
you know, bitch, bitch, bitch, your mom, your mom.

02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:45.100
You're a controller kiddo.

02:40:45.100 --> 02:40:46.220
You're a controller kiddo.

02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:47.380
You're lame.

02:40:47.380 --> 02:40:49.700
You know what's going to be cool is when they come out

02:40:49.700 --> 02:40:53.700
I'm still waiting for that.

02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:57.700
It's coming, it's coming, so soon enough we'll have that.

02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:01.700
And then we'll be able to see your ugly mugs at the same time.

02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:05.700
Yeah, we'll definitely have to do something with itoychat in the future.

02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:09.700
You should need to come back out and hang out with us again.

02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:13.700
I have an excellent...hold on, wait, stop, stop the show! I have an excellent idea.

02:41:13.700 --> 02:41:17.700
We can broadcast all of our shows over itoychat.

02:41:17.700 --> 02:41:23.700
Oh, come on! I think there's moderators on itoychat. We'd probably get banned.

02:41:23.700 --> 02:41:26.700
We'll see. We'll see when it comes out.

02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:29.700
Alright, well thanks for calling, Jason, and helping us show off this new toy.

02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:30.700
Thank you.

02:41:30.700 --> 02:41:33.700
And thank you for filling in for the show last week. That was very nice of you.

02:41:33.700 --> 02:41:35.700
It was very fun once I actually got underway.

02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:37.700
When are you going to do your own show?

02:41:37.700 --> 02:41:39.700
As soon as I actually have a definitive schedule.

02:41:39.700 --> 02:41:41.700
Sounds good to me.

02:41:41.700 --> 02:41:42.700
Yes.

02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:43.700
Alright, you have a good one, Jason. Thanks for calling.

02:41:43.700 --> 02:41:44.700
Goodbye, sir.

02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:45.700
Later.

02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:46.700
Bye.

02:41:46.700 --> 02:41:50.700
Alright, that was fun. That's going to be a fun program to start using when we figure

02:41:50.700 --> 02:42:00.060
out how to do it. But get on board right now. Skype.org. Oh, so people are posting the link

02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:04.340
in the chat room. We're going to get a user account made just for Orange Lounge and figure

02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:08.500
something out. Oh yeah, you did make one a while back, didn't you? Yes, ma'am?

02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:16.180
I just wanted to make a quick statement. I apologize for going into the whole political

02:42:16.180 --> 02:42:26.180
rant earlier. I try not to do it. I have my own elaborate conspiracy theory about all

02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:28.980
of that, and if anyone would like to hear it, just PM me about it later. I won't bring

02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:36.420
it up on the show again. I just wanted to mention.

02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:44.340
Alright. Let's see. Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge. I'm trying to find my Ask

02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:48.060

02:43:00.700 --> 02:43:03.420

02:43:07.020 --> 02:43:12.780

San Francisco it's been over a year since I last seen you guys when you pay

02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:45.560
for the trip? Actually, I want to, um, go to, like, Dave & Busters in Mopedis. I know

02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:48.600
it's not San Francisco, but I really want to go to D&B again. Oh my god, I want to.

02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:54.600
A certain host has a certain birthday coming up with a certain power crash, um, anniversary.

02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:59.680
You know, that's like six weeks away. I wanna go now. I wanna go when I get back from, uh,

02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:02.400
East Coast.

02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:06.640
We should celebrate the return of Rob with booze.

02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:10.320
I want a going away party and a coming back party.

02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:13.640
What was that game that you played that was the really

02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:18.240
gay name? It was right behind our table

02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:22.360
on my birthday. Flaming finger. Yeah, that was great.

02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:25.680
Alright, moving on. You should win on that again.

02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:30.360
Oh my god, Dave and Busters is having an I love the 90s viewing party all this week,

We need to go.

02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:33.360
What a cool.

02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:34.360
I said I'll be gone.

02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:35.360
Cry.

02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:36.360
This week?

02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:39.840
Yeah, I love the 90s started today.

02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:45.140
Beautiful.

02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:46.140
Dead air, fun.

02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:49.620
I was just sending a private message to a buddy.

02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:54.620
John Field says, I know this really isn't Bamani, oh I'm sorry, number two question!

02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:58.820
I know this isn't really Bamani related anyway, but did you see the end of Season 2 of Red

02:44:58.820 --> 02:44:59.820
vs. Blue?

02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:01.420
And if you did, what did you think of it?

02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:02.780
I need to go watch those.

02:45:02.780 --> 02:45:07.940
I haven't watched anything since the last season of Red vs. Blue.

02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:10.700
Red vs. Blue is awesome.

02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:11.700
What is it?

02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:12.700
I don't even know.

02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:17.220
It's these funny movies that they did with using the Halo engine.

02:45:17.220 --> 02:45:19.020
Oh, I have heard of that.

02:45:19.020 --> 02:45:20.020
They're great.

02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:21.020
I've gotten the first DVD.

02:45:21.020 --> 02:45:22.020
Oh.

02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:27.020
Oh! So she can just download all of them off the internet. Didn't Microsoft, like, start actually paying them to do it?

02:45:27.020 --> 02:45:38.020
Yeah! They, like, thought it was awesome. Well, it's really cool. Um, if you go into GameStop, um, their Xbox demos, the little cutscenes in between are from our, uh, the Red vs. Blue guys.

02:45:38.020 --> 02:45:44.020
Interesting. Maybe we should talk more good things about Xbox and they'll hire us to do, you know, something.

02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:51.020
DDR UltraMix is great. You should go buy an Xbox today and play it. It's so much fun.

02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:55.020
I wish everybody listening could see the expression on your face.

02:45:55.020 --> 02:46:00.020
You looked constipated. It was great.

02:46:00.020 --> 02:46:04.020
Number three question.

02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:08.020
Flair O'Nai wants to know, you guys always make a bunch of general comments about your work.

02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:11.020
Where do you guys work exactly?

02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:12.020
I'm not telling.

02:46:12.020 --> 02:46:15.540
Yeah, we're not going to tell exactly where we work, but we can tell what kind of work

02:46:15.540 --> 02:46:16.540
we do.

02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:18.580
I work for a student loan lender.

02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:23.140
A very big student loan lender, owned by a very big bank.

02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:24.260
Okay.

02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:30.500
I work for a, I'm a corporate trainer for a very large health insurance company.

02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:31.940
Not very large, but somewhat big.

02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:34.860
I work in customer service.

02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:37.060
It's big in this state, but probably not where you live.

02:46:37.060 --> 02:46:38.060
Uh, Logie.

02:46:38.060 --> 02:46:39.060
Wait, one thing.

02:46:39.060 --> 02:46:40.060
Yes.

02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:50.060
I sit and read the internet. That's all I do.

02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:52.060
He's a jizz mopper.

02:46:52.060 --> 02:47:05.060
I am not a jizz mopper. I talk to stupid people. Mostly stupid people in the midwest because they're extraordinary stupid. Especially the people that work at video stores there.

02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:19.060
God, they're so stupid. Yeah. Anyways, yeah, I work in the video industry. The movie industry. I get free movies.

02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:33.060
To answer John Fields real quick, the federal government doesn't freaking care where you work. You still have to fill out your FAFSA to get your student loan.

02:47:33.060 --> 02:47:37.620
Even if you work for the IRS, you still have to pay your taxes every year, believe it or

02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:38.620
not.

02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:39.620
Damn it, I know.

02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:43.620
And I'm going to be taking out my student loans through where I work because, you know,

02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:47.300
not necessarily that I'll get a better deal on it, it's just I simply know how the processes

02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:48.300
are.

02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:50.460
You go in there and tweak your account, no?

02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:55.480
No, I wouldn't do that, but you still...

02:47:55.480 --> 02:48:02.340
The FAFSA, if you've never done your own FAFSA, I recommend do it because it asks for all

02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:06.740
of this information, it looks for the crap on your income tax, and it doesn't give a

02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:13.420
shit where you work. It just asks how much money you made. And that is all.

02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:15.780
Alright. Next question.

02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:22.140
Next question. Number four question, also from Flareon A. Also, without one promo where

02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:25.460
if you don't listen to Orange Lounge too often you get killed by an assassin through the

02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:28.700
computer, does it say seven days at the end? Yes, it does.

02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:30.940
Yes. If so, is that in reference to the crappy

02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:06.940
which is really good. Anyway, I had this whole big fandom for the ring going on for a while.

02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:15.940
Okay. Let's see, moving on. Damn, I thought that was a question. Oh, here we go. Number

02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:23.940
five question from Jason. Which new consumer style do you want to see first? GITADORA 5

02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:31.940
5.4, Poppin' 10, 2DX8, or a new DDR?

02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:39.940
I'd have to say in order. I really want 2DX8, and then, um, guitar dota, um, 5.4, and then

02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:45.940
Poppin'. Just because I, you know, well, I didn't buy Poppin' 9, which I probably should've,

02:49:45.940 --> 02:49:52.940
but, um, Dan has just been goin' off wantin' new Guitar Freaks Drummania. And I have two

02:49:52.940 --> 02:49:59.580
guitar freaks controller or is it a drum mania controller collecting dust in my house?

02:49:59.580 --> 02:50:06.580
I actually put a new DDR at the top of my list and then I would say 2DX8, Popn10, Guitadora

02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:10.460
5-4. I don't really collect the guitar freaks and drum mania at home. I think it's good

02:50:10.460 --> 02:50:14.980
for other people. I really want them all to come out. So we'll see. But I want a new DDR

02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:20.980
above everything else. I want a new keyboard mania! That's what I want. And another pada

02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:29.980
Alright, sorry, I'm trying to get set up on something here.

02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:30.980
Puppy has a question.

02:50:30.980 --> 02:50:32.900
Number six question.

02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:36.740
Would you believe that my little brother got a job working at a TAP-X in my hometown?

02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:37.740
Because he did.

02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:39.020
Those things are starting to pop up everywhere.

02:50:39.020 --> 02:50:40.440
They seriously are.

02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:43.380
I wish one would open up near here.

02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:50.460
I went to the TAP-X down off of Sutterville and they are really nice.

02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:55.280
have a big widescreen TV and they let you change the channels on it, and then they have

02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:59.000
a PlayStation hooked up to it, a PS2 hooked up to it, so you can play whatever games they

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:12.000
have there. And, if you pay $5 a month, you can use their broadband service. A wireless

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.360
take one call before the end of the show if you anything you want to talk about

02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:49.960
in regards to tonight's show username orange lounge radio all one word orange

02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:57.580
lounge radio and by the way in answer to John Fields it is $5 a month to use the

02:51:57.580 --> 02:52:02.640
broadband at their at their tap X we do get another question real fast while we

02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:06.880
wait for a call to come through on the skyline black lab wants to know what is

02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:18.600
favorite Pokemon of you? Number seven question. I used to like Togepi a whole lot. But I liked

02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:25.560
Porygon because it made all the children have seizures. Jigglypuff was my favorite. Absolutely.

02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:41.880
Um, man, um, my favorite would have to be Heart Attack Squirrel.

02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:47.640
I liked in Evangelion Redeath how they had the giant, real, geeky Pikachu battle.

02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:50.080
And then Fanboy Bebop Penis!

02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:58.080
There's a fan animation that somebody did that, instead of Pikachu, was Fuckachu.

02:52:58.080 --> 02:53:06.080
And it's actually about the human Pokemon, though, but I have to get it from my friend and show it to you. It's really funny.

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:12.080
I need to see Redeath and Fanboy Devop again. I need to get a copy of Nescaflowney.

02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:16.080
I can't understand why these movies have not made their way onto the internet.

02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:17.080
Nescaflowney, yes.

02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:18.080
Nescaflowney.

02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:25.920
Flonie well I've got fanboy bebop cool I have I also have the cutscenes from

02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:31.720
fanboy bebop to with the it's gendo scene didn't they play those I thought

02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:40.280
they play those at the very end like after the credits yeah I did have a jube

02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:45.480
powers international Japanese man of intercourse I hated that it was it has

02:53:45.480 --> 02:53:52.440
funny scenes. They need to make a Gendo movie. The It's Gendo movie? It's Gendo the movie.

02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:59.040
Did you hear what I snuck in on the pre-show? The Misato. Yeah. I have two breasteses. No.

02:53:59.040 --> 02:54:04.400
I won. The two. I swear they changed the dialogue in that because I thought there was one that

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:11.960
was like a part that said shut up Shinzi and then they changed it to no. No. No it looks

02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:16.960
It looks like that as far as I've seen it, because I saw it at Fanime when they played it.

02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:20.960
Oh well. Nobody likes this, oh well.

02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:26.960
I don't think enough people have gotten Skype yet, because we just said it like ten minutes ago, we're going to be using this, and I don't think a lot of people even have this program yet.

02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:28.960
I have another parody you might like.

02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:29.960
But we'll see what happens, huh?

02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:32.960
Voltron Hellbent for Leather.

02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:35.960
What?

02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:40.960
It's really old, but I'll have to copy it for you.

02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:42.960
You guys are crazy.

02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:49.960
Alright, we got some people saying they're gonna call in, they're trying to install the program now.

02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:53.960
We only got time to take like one or two calls, so if you don't get through this week, um, definitely we can do-

02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:56.960
Do we have any more waiting for us via private message?

02:54:56.960 --> 02:54:58.960
We don't have any other questions waiting private message, so I'm just gonna-

02:54:58.960 --> 02:54:59.960
I have a message?

02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:00.960
Yes.

02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:02.960
Why are we so damn cool?

02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:06.960
Haven't you missed doing the show, though?

02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:09.960
Yes, I've missed-

02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:14.960
No, finally, we're getting a damn call. Let's see, I don't even know...

02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:24.960
I don't even know how to answer the damn call. It's not coming up on the screen.

02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:27.960
I think I just hung up on whoever was calling.

02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:28.960
We're sorry.

02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:32.960
I need to actually change something here in my options real fast because it's trying to...

02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:35.960
Holy crap, it's Zaku.

02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:56.960
I'm trying to have it not switch. No, I'm trying to make sure it doesn't switch. Hold on, I'm actually going to disable calls for a second, because I don't want people to call just yet, because what it's doing is switching our input, which is fucking up our thing going out. Hold on, I'll fix it. Sorry, guys.

02:55:56.960 --> 02:55:58.960
Amy, help me fill time.

02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:01.960
Fill time? Well...

02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:03.960
I could rant.

02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:05.960
Or we could listen to the ferret.

02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:09.960
Okay, I got it fixed. We can take a call now.

02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:11.960
I knew the ferret would get you motivated.

02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:15.960
For some reason, the last person that called, I did not get the answer button when you called.

02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:17.960
So make sure we're on your buddy list, I guess.

02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:19.960
Maybe? I don't know.

02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:22.960
Oh, maybe you did.

02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:24.960
Let's see if I can do it.

02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:26.960
Okay, we're getting a call now.

02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:28.960
I can't answer it!

02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:31.960
It's not letting me answer it.

02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:35.960
Okay, let me see if I can change it from friends only.

02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:36.960
There we go!

02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:37.960
There, I got it.

02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:38.960
Hello?

Yes.

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:44.960
Who is this?

02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:46.960
It's, uh, the Evil Naoki 2DX.

02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:48.960
Hello, Evil Naoki 2DX! Naoki.

02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:49.960
Yes, hello.

02:57:41.980 --> 02:57:44.980
yes, yes, definitely, any shoutouts

02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:48.620
any TRL style Carson Daly blessed shoutouts you wanna give

02:57:48.620 --> 02:57:58.620
Um, just to Angel and, uh, DarklineXVI and anyone else who wants a shoutout, here's my shoutout.

02:57:58.620 --> 02:58:00.620
That's very kind of you.

02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:01.620
Oh, and, uh, Rob?

02:58:01.620 --> 02:58:02.620
Yes.

02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:07.620
When are you coming to my house in a French maid outfit?

02:58:07.620 --> 02:58:09.620
Promise me back at Reticon.

02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:14.620
When I can afford a French maid outfit, I will come in my French maid outfit.

02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:15.620
Oh, you're so kind.

02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:16.620
I know.

02:58:16.620 --> 02:58:17.620
Alright, I'm gonna let you go so we can take one more call before we leave.

02:58:17.620 --> 02:58:19.620
no more call before we leave. Okay. Alright. Take care, bud.

02:58:19.620 --> 02:58:21.040
See you guys later. Thanks, bye.

02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:24.800
Okay, if anyone else wants to call in a comment on any of tonight's topics,

02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:26.160
Skype-Line is open for you guys.

02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:31.460
Username orange-lounge-radio-skype.org is the program you gotta get.

02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:34.700
Brand new thing we're rolling out tonight, the Skype line.

02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:36.620
So we'll wait and see if anybody else wants to give us a call.

02:58:36.620 --> 02:58:38.600
That just sounds cool, the Skype line. I know.

02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:44.540
It should like be like 1-900-HOT-SKYPE. I think it's very smart.

02:58:44.540 --> 02:58:48.780
You know what's kind of neat about this is supposedly we can dial out, too, using this

02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:52.740
thing, but I don't know how well that works. We could try calling my cell phone and see

02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:53.740
what happens.

02:58:53.740 --> 02:58:58.820
Alright, we're getting a call. Hold on. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:58.820 --> 02:59:01.900
Hello, it's me, Darkline XBI.

02:59:01.900 --> 02:59:02.900
Turn down your wing amp.

02:59:02.900 --> 02:59:05.300
Oh, hold on.

02:59:05.300 --> 02:59:06.300
That's right.

02:59:06.300 --> 02:59:09.860
Okay, it's down now.

02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:13.180
Alright. You sound like you're calling us from a glass jar.

02:59:13.180 --> 02:59:19.180
He's hanging out with the tin can lady from Solo.

02:59:19.180 --> 02:59:21.180
I got to adjust my mic.

02:59:21.180 --> 02:59:24.180
It's all good. You guys will have plenty of time to play around with setting stuff.

02:59:24.180 --> 02:59:28.180
What's up? What's on your mind? What do you think of tonight's show? Any comments on anything?

02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:30.180
It's really good, actually.

02:59:30.180 --> 02:59:32.180
When aren't we good? Damn, we're good.

02:59:32.180 --> 02:59:34.180
We are so hot.

02:59:34.180 --> 02:59:37.180
We could do TRL on Orgeland's radio.

02:59:37.180 --> 02:59:39.180
Indeed.

02:59:39.180 --> 02:59:42.180
I don't know if we would want to, but we could, so...

02:59:42.180 --> 02:59:46.180
What's better than real radio?

02:59:46.180 --> 02:59:50.180
How can I get multiple calls there? That was weird.

02:59:50.180 --> 02:59:54.180
I'm gonna have to play with the settings myself on this end. Everything's still in beta, so we'll figure it out.

02:59:54.180 --> 02:59:58.180
Anything else you want to say? Any shout-outs?

02:59:58.180 --> 03:00:02.180
Well, I would like to make a shout-out to Rich, Evil Naoki, 2DX, and all of the

03:00:02.180 --> 03:00:06.180
2DX community here in Vegas.

03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:10.180
Oh, Vegas! I gotta go back to Vegas someday.

03:00:10.180 --> 03:00:12.180
We need to see Maron-chan.

03:00:12.180 --> 03:00:14.180
Yeah, there's a lot of folks that listen to us.

03:00:14.180 --> 03:00:15.180
Why do you guys come into Vegas?

03:00:15.180 --> 03:00:17.180
We need to go to the Adult Entertainment Expo.

03:00:19.180 --> 03:00:22.180
Yeah, we'll be down there for Adult Entertainment Expo sometime.

03:00:22.180 --> 03:00:26.180
Yeah, but we won't be there for Classic Gaming Expo because they moved that to San Jose.

03:00:26.180 --> 03:00:28.180
Yeah, oh, I definitely want to go to Classic Gaming Expo this year.

03:00:28.180 --> 03:00:29.180
Oh, yeah.

03:00:29.180 --> 03:00:30.180
We'll see.

03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:31.180
All right, we're going to have to let you go.

03:00:31.180 --> 03:00:32.180
You know what, though?

03:00:32.180 --> 03:00:37.180
I just realized that you sent me that story about the American Idol style thing they're doing.

03:00:37.180 --> 03:00:38.180
Oh, yeah, I sent you that.

03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:42.180
And I totally forgot to bring it up tonight. I'll send it to Jamie to talk about next week.

03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:44.180
By the way, it's already gone.

03:00:44.180 --> 03:00:45.180
Oh, is it?

03:00:45.180 --> 03:00:47.180
Yeah. They don't have the links.

03:00:47.180 --> 03:00:51.180
That sucks. All right, well, it was worth a try.

03:00:51.180 --> 03:00:52.180
All right, thanks for calling in, dude.

03:00:52.180 --> 03:00:53.180
Yeah, my pleasure.

03:00:53.180 --> 03:00:54.180
Take it easy.

03:00:54.180 --> 03:00:55.180
Bye.

03:00:55.180 --> 03:00:56.180
Bye.

03:00:56.180 --> 03:00:59.180
See, this is pretty cool now that we can take calls. I'm liking this.

03:00:59.180 --> 03:01:05.180
All right, that's it. We're going to have to go ahead and close the Skype line for tonight.

03:01:05.180 --> 03:01:09.040
And supposedly you can call actual phone numbers, we'll see how that works later.

03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:11.300
But we're going to end the show for now, because we're running over a little bit.

03:01:11.300 --> 03:01:14.300
Maybe we'll take a call in the afterbirth or something, that'd be fun.

03:01:14.300 --> 03:01:15.300
Maybe.

03:01:15.300 --> 03:01:16.300
Maybe.

03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:18.100
Alright, but we've got to end the show, so goodnight everybody, thank you very much for

03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:21.660
listening, thank you for supporting Orange Lawn's radio, please help us out, listen to

03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:24.000
our Bomani Music and More program, whore up our ratings.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:25.140
And send us money.

03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:29.060
Listen to Jamie's show, which will be on- Oh, oh, oh, oh, that reminds me.

03:01:29.060 --> 03:01:30.060
Yes.

03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:34.500
I'm still trying to implement this, I'm doing Dark Sakura email, sort of like Strong Bad

03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:41.960
email but not. And so, I'm taking either private messages to me on orangechallengeradio.com

03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:50.420
as darksacra or to darksacra at gmail.com. Go ahead and send me your email and I will

03:01:50.420 --> 03:01:56.860
answer them on the show and totally berate you, but not really. We'll see what happens.

03:01:56.860 --> 03:02:00.220
Just wanted to make a mention.

03:02:00.220 --> 03:02:11.580
Okay, um, I guess that's it. We're done. Oh god, final thoughts. Jamie, your final thought.

03:02:11.580 --> 03:02:14.420
My final thought is Skype Line.

03:02:14.420 --> 03:02:18.020
That sounds so hot, Rob.

03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:19.020
Loki's not here.

03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:20.340
Loki's final thought is potty.

03:02:20.340 --> 03:02:25.900
Yeah, Loki's final thought is potty. And the final word of the show, I guess I'll have

03:02:25.900 --> 03:02:39.900
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

03:02:57.900 --> 03:03:01.900
And now today's Ebonics language lesson.

03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:02.900
Meeting girls.

03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:05.900
My, you're a lovely young lady.

03:03:05.900 --> 03:03:08.900
Damn, you's a fine motherf***er.

03:03:08.900 --> 03:03:11.900
Damn, you's a fine motherf***er.

03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:13.900
Let's go for a ride, shall we?

03:03:13.900 --> 03:03:17.900
Hey baby, jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.

03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:22.900
Hey baby, let's jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.

03:03:22.900 --> 03:03:24.240
You are beautiful.

03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:26.360
I would like to make love to you.

03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:28.780
Damn bitch, you stupid fly.

03:03:28.780 --> 03:03:31.820
Let me pull up to that bumper and smack that monkey.

03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:34.060
Damn bitch, you stupid fly.

03:03:34.060 --> 03:03:37.540
Let me pull up to your bumper and smack that monkey.

03:03:37.540 --> 03:03:39.460
Greeting old friends.

03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:40.660
Hello, sir.

03:03:40.660 --> 03:03:42.900
What up, dog?

03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:45.660
What up, dog?

03:03:45.660 --> 03:03:47.660
May I borrow some money?

03:03:47.660 --> 03:03:50.860
Hey, let me hold some ends. I'll hit you back on the first, my brother.

03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:55.360
Hey, let me hold some ends. I will hit you back on the first, my brother.

03:03:55.360 --> 03:03:58.560
You don't have it? Thanks anyway.

03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:01.860
F*** you!

03:04:01.860 --> 03:04:05.260
Making new friends. Hello, sir.

03:04:05.260 --> 03:04:11.460
What up? What up? I admire your fashionable running shoes.

03:04:11.460 --> 03:04:15.360
Drop them Nike's off your ass before I blast you, motherf***er!

03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:20.360
Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherfucker!

03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:24.360
I used to be a stuck-up white boy faking the funk. Bump that!

03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:31.360
I ain't bullshitting on Front Street no more, thanks to the Wake Up Crew's Ebonics language lesson.

03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:34.360
Available in a hood near you!

03:04:34.360 --> 03:05:02.360
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:05:04.360 --> 03:05:20.760
Alright, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio, the after birth, here it is, this is the part

03:05:20.760 --> 03:05:24.720
after the credits have come and gone, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line

03:05:24.720 --> 03:05:27.160
some more, you guys want to play on that for a minute, so we'll...

03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:28.360
Damn bitch, you stupid...

03:05:28.360 --> 03:05:31.080
That was a great fortune cookie message, I mean not that...

03:05:31.080 --> 03:05:33.920
I hadn't had that a long time ago and I finally bothered to get it.

03:05:33.920 --> 03:05:36.640
I played it on my show once.

03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:39.280
That's good, I like it.

03:05:39.280 --> 03:05:43.220
Can we set up voicemail on it? Possibly. I think it would be cool if we could, because then we just leave it up

03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:48.420
all day and people could send us their refuse with voice.

03:05:48.420 --> 03:05:54.360
Maybe, maybe it's something they're going to do in a little bit, I don't know.

03:05:54.360 --> 03:05:57.660
Alright, so we'll see if

03:05:57.660 --> 03:06:00.880
we get any calls.

03:06:00.880 --> 03:06:04.880
Nobody loves us. Actually, we're going to put details up on the website of exactly how you can call the show.

03:06:04.880 --> 03:06:08.880
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.

03:06:08.880 --> 03:06:12.880
Otherwise, is there anything else you guys wanted to add?

03:06:12.880 --> 03:06:16.880
What up, dog?

03:06:16.880 --> 03:06:20.880
I need to find a computer case with, like, very specific

03:06:20.880 --> 03:06:24.880
specifications. Like, I need...it has to be, like, about, eh, 13

03:06:24.880 --> 03:06:28.880
to 14 inches wide and about 17 inches long.

03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:41.880
Height is not a factor. But I'm looking at the micro ATX cases, and they're like, they're too small, and the normal ATX cases are too big. It's just I can't win.

03:06:41.880 --> 03:06:59.880
Um, but I don't know, maybe if I could find an ATX case that was, you know, really, uh, short, that might work, but, um, I just, basically what I'm doing is I need to install, um, pretty much just, um, I don't know, I might be able to do it in a normal case.

03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:06.040
Um, cause I need enough room to install the extra, um, ports for, cause there's, on a

03:07:06.040 --> 03:07:10.960
normal DDR machine you've got like, you know, um, your standard, like a JAMA cable and four

03:07:10.960 --> 03:07:16.840
other smaller, um, five pin cables that get plugged in there, cause it needs more than

03:07:16.840 --> 03:07:18.920
just the JAMA, um, stuff.

03:07:18.920 --> 03:07:24.620
So I need to add those extra ports onto the PC, and then I need to have, like, the, um,

03:07:24.620 --> 03:07:32.860
There's a monitor, like a video converter card or something, a small PC board that I

03:07:32.860 --> 03:07:34.120
need to get.

03:07:34.120 --> 03:07:37.100
So I need to have that all inside a case.

03:07:37.100 --> 03:07:44.860
And it's just kind of tough to get a case to hold all that without having to mod one

03:07:44.860 --> 03:07:52.860
or having to make one, so yeah, I don't know.

03:07:52.860 --> 03:07:57.860
Well, I was waiting for somebody to call, but I guess it's not going to happen.

03:07:57.860 --> 03:07:59.860
Guess not. I don't know.

03:07:59.860 --> 03:08:00.860
Oh, well.

03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:02.860
I thought somebody said they were going to call.

03:08:02.860 --> 03:08:04.860
There was that one chick, Misty, that said...

03:08:04.860 --> 03:08:08.860
Well, yeah, but I didn't think she had a mic. Let me see.

03:08:08.860 --> 03:08:10.860
Oh.

03:08:10.860 --> 03:08:14.860
Well, the person who was going to call us is having technical problems, so I guess we'll just have to try again next week.

03:08:14.860 --> 03:08:18.860
Thank you, everybody, for listening. I went ahead and closed the Skype line for now.

03:08:18.860 --> 03:08:22.020
um... and we're gonna do a post show tonight

03:08:22.020 --> 03:08:25.220
uh... but i don't know what music i wanna do. How about um...

03:08:25.220 --> 03:08:27.560
I like this uh...

03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:31.500
those compilations that I've been downloading recently, the Ministry of Sound stuff

03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:35.580
I know you've got a lot of that on your computer, but I like it too. We should listen to the whole

03:08:35.580 --> 03:08:37.000
uh...

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:38.860
the whole v-rare CD

03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:39.640
for

03:08:39.640 --> 03:08:44.260
E.A. Damion. Uh, no we shouldn't.

03:08:44.260 --> 03:08:48.220
You know, I was just looking at Alienware's site. They have like small, mid-sized business

03:08:48.220 --> 03:08:53.340
computers? Who the fuck would buy Alienware computers for business? I mean, you can't

03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:57.860
even look professional with this little alien head on there and shit. I don't know, I guess

03:08:57.860 --> 03:09:06.940
it beats cow print or whatever. All right, we will see you guys later. Thanks a lot for

03:09:06.940 --> 03:09:10.940
listening. Enjoy this random mix of stuff mixed together by Ministry Sound. There's

03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:13.780
a lot of good DDR sounding stuff in here and stuff you've probably heard in a cage match

03:09:13.780 --> 03:09:17.800
before. Have a great night, you guys. Thanks for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge

03:09:17.800 --> 03:09:24.800

Ooh, if you're gonna love me, baby Ooh, I want to be the only one

03:13:19.900 --> 03:13:37.900
Since you're gone, everything looks so empty Without you, the nights are so cold

03:13:37.900 --> 03:13:47.900
Can you tell, tell me how to convince you Please come back

03:13:47.900 --> 03:13:54.900
I won't let you down, I won't let you down

03:13:58.900 --> 03:14:06.900
I can't let you go, why can't you stay?

03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:12.900
I still wonder why

03:14:12.900 --> 03:14:30.900
I can't let you go. Why can't you stay? Give it one more try. I can't let you go.

03:14:30.900 --> 03:14:44.900
I can't let you go

03:14:44.900 --> 03:15:12.900
And I hope, one day you will forgive me If I could, I would turn back time

03:15:12.900 --> 03:15:28.900
Would you know that I'm thinking about you If you knew, would you change your mind, would you change your mind?

03:15:28.900 --> 03:15:40.900
I can't let you go, why can't you stay?

03:15:40.900 --> 03:15:50.900
I still wonder why, I can't let you go

03:15:50.900 --> 03:16:00.900

03:16:00.900 --> 03:16:18.900

03:16:18.900 --> 03:16:20.900
Oh

03:18:18.900 --> 03:18:32.900
Where am I now, I am looking but can't see ahead

03:18:32.900 --> 03:18:38.900
Lost in this space, there's a voice calling out in my head

03:18:38.900 --> 03:18:46.900
I'm passing my faces that I have been known never seen

03:18:46.900 --> 03:18:52.900
Keep on looking and asking where have you been

03:18:53.900 --> 03:18:59.900
I'm falling away, I am lost in the wilderness

03:19:00.900 --> 03:19:06.900
I'm falling away on the wind I'm afraid

03:19:07.900 --> 03:19:13.900
I'm travelling through, riding high into paradise

03:19:13.900 --> 03:19:21.900
And all I can see is wilderness

03:19:21.900 --> 03:19:28.900
I'm falling away, I am lost in a wilderness

03:19:28.900 --> 03:19:35.900
I'm falling away on the wing of a friend

03:19:35.900 --> 03:19:42.900
I'm traveling through, riding high into paradise

03:19:42.900 --> 03:19:48.900
And all I can see is wilderness

03:19:50.900 --> 03:19:56.900
I'm falling away, I am lost in the wilderness

03:19:57.900 --> 03:20:03.900
I'm falling away, all the way back away

03:20:04.900 --> 03:20:10.900
I'm traveling through, riding high, if you have to die

03:20:10.900 --> 03:20:16.900
And all I can see, it will remain

03:20:16.900 --> 03:20:45.900
And all I can do is will the man

03:21:15.900 --> 03:21:17.900
Happyness

03:21:17.900 --> 03:21:19.900
And loneliness

03:21:19.900 --> 03:21:21.900
be happy
