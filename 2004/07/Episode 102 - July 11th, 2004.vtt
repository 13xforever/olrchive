[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

00:06.292 --> 00:10.874
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

00:10.894 --> 00:11.434
[SPEAKER_28]: That's right.

00:12.555 --> 00:14.476
[SPEAKER_28]: The only thing you're going to be riding is me.

[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

00:24.793 --> 00:26.094
[SPEAKER_00]: So I choose to expose myself.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.815
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, they're our ladies' presents.

00:28.055 --> 00:30.277

[SPEAKER_23]: Loki.

00:38.063 --> 00:38.924
[SPEAKER_27]: Ow, my foot!

00:39.405 --> 00:41.606
[SPEAKER_27]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

00:42.007 --> 00:43.748
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, is it on now?

01:18.541 --> 01:19.101
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go, yes.

01:19.907 --> 01:21.647
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't let me counsel anybody.

01:22.367 --> 01:24.708
[SPEAKER_31]: My advice will be, get a gun.

01:26.588 --> 01:27.048
[SPEAKER_31]: Get a gun.

01:30.309 --> 01:34.410
[SPEAKER_18]: I lost the whole script and the whole computer upgrade thing, so I had to just rewrite it just now.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.510
[SPEAKER_31]: Ew.

01:36.650 --> 01:38.650
[SPEAKER_18]: I like this camp theme we've got going.

01:38.670 --> 01:40.031
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait till you hear this next line, okay?

01:40.051 --> 01:40.331

01:40.631 --> 01:40.851
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

01:41.291 --> 01:42.111
[SPEAKER_31]: I hated camp.

[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.231
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait till you hear this next line.

[SPEAKER_11]: You so ripped that off from In Living Color.

[SPEAKER_18]: I don't care.

01:53.564 --> 01:53.985
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't care.

01:56.446 --> 01:58.707
[SPEAKER_18]: Joining us tonight also, we have some very special guests.

01:59.848 --> 02:03.050
[SPEAKER_18]: Say hello to our guests, I guess, as in singular.

[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have a fancy stage last name, though.

02:11.655 --> 02:12.135
[SPEAKER_18]: You want one?

02:12.756 --> 02:12.976
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

02:13.356 --> 02:14.957
[SPEAKER_18]: What can we give Neil as a last name?

02:16.601 --> 02:19.225
[SPEAKER_18]: Neil, I'll let our chat room think about that one.

02:19.986 --> 02:23.751
[SPEAKER_18]: You can join our chat room, www.orangeslawntrader.com.

02:23.791 --> 02:27.737
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we have not been here for like three weeks now.

02:27.777 --> 02:29.099
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie hasn't been here in a month.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.282
[SPEAKER_29]: That's because I had shit to do.

02:32.722 --> 02:39.488
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I have a friend who was at UCSD for like six years in the math program of all things.

02:40.008 --> 02:41.930
[SPEAKER_31]: How could I pass up her graduation party?

02:41.970 --> 02:44.212
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that was the week we ended up not having a show anyway.

02:44.252 --> 02:45.433
[SPEAKER_18]: You were gone the week before also.

02:45.453 --> 02:47.975
[SPEAKER_31]: The week before I was being a lusty wench.

02:48.535 --> 02:49.896
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, that's right.

02:49.916 --> 02:52.639
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember that now because we were making fun of the Ren Faire on the show while you weren't here.

02:53.159 --> 02:58.944
[SPEAKER_31]: I was like, I had a good time at the Ren Faire but they didn't have any meat and it pissed me off.

02:59.485 --> 03:01.206
[SPEAKER_18]: But you have meat now, right?

03:01.387 --> 03:01.707
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

03:02.267 --> 03:02.628
[SPEAKER_31]: Mead.

03:03.068 --> 03:03.408
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, mead.

03:03.428 --> 03:04.189
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought you said meat.

03:04.329 --> 03:05.069
[SPEAKER_31]: Brewed honey.

03:05.210 --> 03:05.690
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, never mind.

03:07.451 --> 03:08.752
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I have a dick in my ear.

03:09.973 --> 03:10.254
[SPEAKER_31]: Well.

03:13.076 --> 03:14.477
[SPEAKER_31]: You know they have surgery for that, Rob.

03:14.577 --> 03:17.599
[SPEAKER_18]: All that TMI and plenty more when we come back.

03:18.180 --> 03:20.742
[SPEAKER_18]: There's like three weeks of ranting to catch up on.

03:21.442 --> 03:22.804
[SPEAKER_18]: So much Bomani news.

03:22.844 --> 03:23.324
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, yes.

03:24.540 --> 03:25.061
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really.

03:25.341 --> 03:28.283
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, basically, I could wrap it up right here.

03:28.303 --> 03:29.224
[SPEAKER_18]: Funny news.

03:29.725 --> 03:31.046
[SPEAKER_13]: They have plenty of funny news.

03:31.406 --> 03:34.669
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR was in the media because somebody lost weight.

03:34.929 --> 03:35.450
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.311
[SPEAKER_18]: There's more than that.

03:37.331 --> 03:39.213
[SPEAKER_26]: DDR was in the media because somebody had a heart attack.

03:39.273 --> 03:40.494
[SPEAKER_18]: You're right, there's more than that.

03:40.534 --> 03:46.400
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be talking about that when we come back after this set of just some DDR music I wanted to play.

03:47.932 --> 03:51.440
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'll be back and we'll get started with the catching up.

03:51.921 --> 03:56.070
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell everybody you know, Orange Lounge is back on the air and we're taking names.

03:56.271 --> 03:56.732
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

05:30.182 --> 05:30.748
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

06:04.723 --> 06:09.003
I'm a veteran now, which means that I've been in the game too long Since the day that they prevented me way back when

07:31.485 --> 07:32.147
[SPEAKER_07]: La Senorita

08:46.547 --> 08:50.009
[SPEAKER_31]: We are live... You made a promo and didn't tell me.

08:50.509 --> 08:52.270
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what was going on last night?

08:52.591 --> 08:56.393
[SPEAKER_18]: I was playing with this new software program because I've been looking for stuff for... You made a promo?

08:57.414 --> 08:58.454
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to hear it one more time?

08:58.854 --> 08:59.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.717
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_18]: Mamani Music.

09:05.839 --> 09:06.279
[SPEAKER_18]: And more.

09:06.859 --> 09:07.700
[SPEAKER_25]: Perfect!

09:09.110 --> 09:09.570
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know.

09:09.970 --> 09:10.591
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up, Loki.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.152
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I put some effort out.

09:12.172 --> 09:13.772
[SPEAKER_31]: I was like, what the hell was that?

09:15.813 --> 09:17.494
[SPEAKER_31]: OMG WTF BBQ.

09:17.534 --> 09:22.797
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, okay, I've been playing with some new toys for Diversion because... Okay, let's back this up a little bit.

09:23.177 --> 09:23.617
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's back it up.

09:23.917 --> 09:27.479
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, you might have heard, I got a new kind of computer thing going on.

09:27.519 --> 09:31.861
[SPEAKER_18]: I finally put in the stuff that Squeenix gave me at E3 when I won the Ballista thing.

09:32.381 --> 09:37.644
[SPEAKER_18]: And I put them in a couple weeks ago, and of course that's what caused the show to not be here a couple weeks ago.

09:38.355 --> 09:51.719
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's given me some time to like play with some new things install some new software that didn't run good before and one of them is like this Mixing program that I was thinking about using for diversion because I thought would be really cool to have like the Bomani music Remixed remixes mixing together.

09:51.979 --> 10:00.921
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought be pretty cool, but unfortunately the software had problems of its own But it sounds really really good if you have like these short like 10-second promos like stringing the music together and

10:01.161 --> 10:04.423
[SPEAKER_18]: So I made a bunch of like, well not a bunch, but like three quickie little promos.

10:04.463 --> 10:04.964
[SPEAKER_07]: Little bumpers.

10:05.184 --> 10:06.205
[SPEAKER_18]: Little bumpers, exactly.

10:06.245 --> 10:06.785
[SPEAKER_18]: Little bumpers.

10:06.905 --> 10:07.466
[SPEAKER_18]: Mini bumpers.

10:07.786 --> 10:09.267
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really promos, but mini bumpers.

10:09.727 --> 10:13.190
[SPEAKER_14]: But since... The buggy baby... Shut up.

10:14.270 --> 10:17.273
[SPEAKER_18]: Rubber baggy... Baggy Bumani bumpers.

10:18.333 --> 10:18.633
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.274
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'll play some more of those tonight.

10:21.294 --> 10:23.794
[SPEAKER_18]: Because now, that program fucking sucked.

10:23.854 --> 10:26.555
[SPEAKER_18]: Because after about 30 minutes and all my audio starts skipping.

10:26.575 --> 10:27.235
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can't use it.

10:27.575 --> 10:32.016
[SPEAKER_18]: So now I have those little rubber baby Bomani bumpers and nothing to use them for.

10:32.657 --> 10:33.837
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'll play them tonight.

10:34.137 --> 10:36.017
[SPEAKER_18]: Because everybody bitches that we never have new promos.

10:36.237 --> 10:37.098
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you get those.

10:41.059 --> 10:41.339
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

10:41.819 --> 10:46.580
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I guess we have to start this episode off with a bit of an apology.

10:47.486 --> 10:48.686
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, we had lives.

10:49.907 --> 10:50.187
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

10:50.707 --> 10:52.987
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'm finding some apology music here.

10:53.908 --> 10:56.208
[SPEAKER_18]: Because as you may or may not know, this is our first show.

10:56.248 --> 10:57.608
[SPEAKER_18]: When was episode 101?

10:57.669 --> 10:59.109
[SPEAKER_18]: I would have to get out a calendar to look.

10:59.729 --> 11:01.950
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

11:02.970 --> 11:04.130
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't find that song that quick.

11:05.891 --> 11:07.691
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was before my birthday.

11:07.711 --> 11:08.411
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember that much.

11:09.091 --> 11:09.571
[SPEAKER_18]: Or was it?

11:09.892 --> 11:10.052
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

11:10.112 --> 11:10.792
[SPEAKER_03]: It was before.

11:10.992 --> 11:12.472
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was the week before my birthday.

11:12.512 --> 11:14.213
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would have been like the 18th or something.

11:14.273 --> 11:15.833
[SPEAKER_18]: So gosh, we got a lot of ground to cover.

11:17.383 --> 11:19.544
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so we're going to play some apology music here.

11:19.584 --> 11:20.705
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm looking for it.

11:21.845 --> 11:22.286
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.

11:22.626 --> 11:25.628
[SPEAKER_18]: This is some nice little gothy apology music.

11:29.470 --> 11:40.076
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear listeners of Orange Lounge Radio, we offer our condolences and Jamie's hairball for not being live for the past two weeks.

11:41.177 --> 11:45.940
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie offers her special condolences for not being here for the past three weeks.

11:46.607 --> 11:56.992
[SPEAKER_18]: She's missed you all dearly But my aim is improving And she coughs up this hairball especially for you It tastes like tri-tip You see

11:58.123 --> 12:08.856
[SPEAKER_18]: What we decided to do two weeks ago was for you, the listener, we decided to upgrade our boards and studios so that we could have faster and better audio for those of you guys.

12:08.916 --> 12:10.678
[SPEAKER_18]: And plus I would have much less headache running the show.

12:11.078 --> 12:15.103
[SPEAKER_18]: So we let our tech master Loki, I'm going to blame it on him, upgrade the computer.

12:15.323 --> 12:16.344
[SPEAKER_29]: Blame it on Squinnix.

12:16.364 --> 12:18.387
[SPEAKER_14]: Blame it on Microsoft.

12:19.088 --> 12:22.309
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, well, I can't really blame it on Microsoft because we were using Piratey Cup.

12:23.530 --> 12:28.672
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, no, no, he meant a pirate's treasure that we found.

12:29.152 --> 12:31.773
[SPEAKER_29]: A photocopy.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.314
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, a photocopy.

12:33.714 --> 12:36.955
[SPEAKER_18]: So basically, we started to upgrade the computer around what, noon?

12:37.035 --> 12:38.556
[SPEAKER_18]: Thinking we'd have plenty of time to do it?

12:38.996 --> 12:43.018
[SPEAKER_18]: And how many times did we have to install different versions of Windows XP?

12:43.939 --> 12:45.080
[SPEAKER_14]: About six.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.742
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, see, Rob's computer is what we like to call in the industry, old.

12:50.322 --> 12:53.343
[SPEAKER_14]: And it did not like anything that you did to it.

12:53.524 --> 12:54.564
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very cranky.

12:54.924 --> 13:03.568
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I ended up having to take one of my older hard drives, a nice 40 gig Maxter hard drive, and put that in there and format it.

13:03.748 --> 13:04.909
[SPEAKER_14]: God knows what was on that.

13:05.829 --> 13:06.890
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sick of apology music.

13:07.692 --> 13:23.838
[SPEAKER_14]: every battle so yeah we had to end up reinstalling a new hard drive before it would even take for some reason I don't know why so but we finally got it installed like after the show yeah it finally finally the system came up about

13:25.013 --> 13:25.854
[SPEAKER_18]: 3 hours after the show

13:46.107 --> 13:48.689
[SPEAKER_18]: And we just took it off because... Yeah, you guys have to face this.

13:49.410 --> 13:52.633
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a national holiday dedicated to fire.

13:53.194 --> 13:57.237
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to be here doing a show for you all?

13:57.538 --> 13:59.099
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we're going to be out setting things on fire.

13:59.199 --> 14:00.240
[SPEAKER_31]: Illegal fireworks.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.643
[SPEAKER_18]: For last week, you do not have our apology.

14:02.743 --> 14:03.503
[SPEAKER_18]: You get fire.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.145
[SPEAKER_18]: Our leftover fire from last week.

14:05.706 --> 14:07.086
[SPEAKER_31]: This is smoke and ashes.

14:07.206 --> 14:09.767
[SPEAKER_18]: It was not our intention to be on two weeks in a row, so we apologize.

14:09.867 --> 14:10.587
[SPEAKER_18]: We know you've missed us.

14:14.428 --> 14:15.228
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the excuse.

14:15.508 --> 14:16.188
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what's going on.

14:16.348 --> 14:17.468
[SPEAKER_31]: I make no excuses.

14:18.089 --> 14:20.229
[SPEAKER_31]: I stand by my decisions, dammit.

14:20.709 --> 14:27.690
[SPEAKER_31]: I take full responsibility and accountability for what I did, unlike those who are coming up in the upcoming presidential elections.

14:29.211 --> 14:29.871
[SPEAKER_31]: Vote for me.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.787
[SPEAKER_31]: and Unstable Jelly.

14:34.827 --> 14:35.968
[SPEAKER_31]: Red vs. Blue owns you.

14:35.988 --> 14:36.489
[SPEAKER_31]: Go watch it.

14:38.230 --> 14:43.194
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie likes to talk back to our chat room, so if you want to get Jamie's attention, you can... Say something stupid.

14:44.415 --> 14:46.777
[SPEAKER_18]: It's broadcast on the TV screen here in our studio.

14:47.278 --> 14:49.940
[SPEAKER_18]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

14:49.980 --> 14:50.821
[SPEAKER_18]: All the good stuff's there.

14:51.321 --> 14:53.883
[SPEAKER_18]: There's all the chatting boys and girls in the chat room.

14:53.903 --> 14:56.165
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the only way you can participate in Cage Match.

14:56.485 --> 14:57.166
[SPEAKER_31]: By the way, my friends...

14:59.881 --> 15:05.385
[SPEAKER_31]: Someone brought up to me that there is a working Mac emulator now for a PC that I'm going to be getting for my computer.

15:06.046 --> 15:06.446
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait a minute.

15:06.466 --> 15:08.708
[SPEAKER_18]: You just said working and Mac in the same sentence.

15:09.508 --> 15:10.449
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to try it out.

15:12.190 --> 15:14.512
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm going to try it out just for curiosity.

15:14.532 --> 15:16.694
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just giving our listeners a little hell.

15:18.175 --> 15:19.496
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to be interesting news.

15:19.576 --> 15:24.420
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that I've apologized for being gone for the past two weeks, I have some interesting news to tell you all.

15:25.961 --> 15:28.002
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to be here for the next two weeks.

15:28.223 --> 15:28.583
[SPEAKER_29]: Bye.

15:31.962 --> 15:34.884
[SPEAKER_18]: This show will be solely in the hands of DarkSakura and Loki.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.125
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear God save us all.

15:38.165 --> 15:39.966
[SPEAKER_18]: I fear for you all and my apologies.

15:41.206 --> 15:45.608
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to pay my rent and my bills, then I will be here every week for you.

15:45.808 --> 15:54.411
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, I need to remain my company's bitch and go to strange places they tell me to go to, which for the next two weeks will involve the East Coast.

15:55.211 --> 15:56.612
[SPEAKER_31]: Bring me back something Eastern.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.200
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if I should say where.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.901
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want stalker fans to find me.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.342
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to say exactly where, but I'll give a hint.

16:04.622 --> 16:05.182
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give a hint.

16:11.123 --> 16:11.563
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

16:12.504 --> 16:14.924
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one letter off from California in the state of abbreviation.

16:14.944 --> 16:15.664
[SPEAKER_18]: That's way nerdy.

16:16.285 --> 16:20.125
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an hour away from where Queer as Folk is set.

16:21.746 --> 16:22.346
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a good hint.

16:24.787 --> 16:26.387
[SPEAKER_18]: So I won't be here for the next two weeks, so.

16:27.443 --> 16:31.447
[SPEAKER_31]: How many times are we going to do this show from my house?

16:32.368 --> 16:35.471
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as people don't decide to abandon me for Ron Jeremy like they did last time.

16:35.491 --> 16:37.313
[SPEAKER_18]: No, this time I'll be abandoned for Mame.

16:50.882 --> 16:51.943
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll do what I can.

16:52.363 --> 16:56.605
[SPEAKER_18]: If there's something I can do to help from millions of miles away, I will.

16:56.905 --> 17:02.969
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, this is still all up in the air, because basically, I got told that I'm taking this trip Friday.

17:03.970 --> 17:05.630
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll be leaving a week from today.

17:06.051 --> 17:10.693
[SPEAKER_18]: So everything's very last minute here, and I'm wondering if it'll actually happen.

17:10.733 --> 17:13.555
[SPEAKER_18]: So I may be here next week, but not bloody likely.

17:13.935 --> 17:15.656
[SPEAKER_18]: When the man tells you you go, you go.

17:15.796 --> 17:16.717
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's all you can do.

17:18.732 --> 17:22.034
[SPEAKER_31]: Why does it always have to be the man?

17:22.094 --> 17:24.116
[SPEAKER_31]: Why can't it be the woman to tell you to do something?

17:24.176 --> 17:26.457
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, because in this case it was a man that told me I'm going.

17:27.318 --> 17:30.040
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, fuck you.

17:30.821 --> 17:33.763
[SPEAKER_18]: My boss is a woman, but her boss is a man.

17:35.184 --> 17:36.305
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, well then I retract that.

17:36.385 --> 17:38.046
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard some great woman jokes over the weekend.

17:38.086 --> 17:38.666
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to hear some?

17:38.827 --> 17:39.567
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure.

17:40.568 --> 17:41.669
[SPEAKER_18]: How do you fix a woman's watch?

17:45.612 --> 17:45.932
[SPEAKER_31]: What?

17:46.257 --> 17:47.678
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't need to, there's a clock on the oven.

17:51.879 --> 17:56.381
[SPEAKER_31]: I would throw this can at you, but I'm still drinking from it.

17:57.801 --> 17:59.822
[SPEAKER_31]: And this root beer I value more than that joke.

17:59.842 --> 18:03.303
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, you know, I wouldn't want the house getting dirty.

18:07.885 --> 18:08.885
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, moving right along.

18:09.878 --> 18:12.380
[SPEAKER_18]: Here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're equal opportunity offenders, by the way.

18:13.401 --> 18:17.183
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving right along, we usually start the show off with doing a little bit of How was your day?

18:17.263 --> 18:17.884
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your week?

18:18.024 --> 18:20.986
[SPEAKER_18]: But seeing as we've been gone for a little while, I think we're going to do some How was your day?

18:21.006 --> 18:21.527
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your month?

18:22.087 --> 18:24.949
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Jamie, how was your day?

18:25.029 --> 18:25.510
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your month?

18:25.830 --> 18:27.051
[SPEAKER_31]: My day was pretty good, actually.

18:28.912 --> 18:33.856
[SPEAKER_31]: I woke up at 8.30 in the morning after having gone to bed around 4 a.m.

18:35.057 --> 18:35.177
[SPEAKER_31]: And...

18:37.219 --> 18:40.341
[SPEAKER_31]: I decided that, well, today, Julie and I were going to go running.

18:40.561 --> 18:42.963
[SPEAKER_31]: So we went, and we left, you know, on time.

18:43.303 --> 18:46.986
[SPEAKER_31]: For the first time, Julie was on time getting to my house.

18:48.387 --> 18:52.029
[SPEAKER_31]: We got out, we got to ARC, and it was all roped off.

18:52.230 --> 18:54.711
[SPEAKER_31]: ARC, by the way, is American River College, for those people who don't know.

18:55.272 --> 18:58.614
[SPEAKER_31]: And so we're like, okay, so we'll go over to CSUS.

18:59.155 --> 19:00.656
[SPEAKER_31]: Forgot the Olympic trials were going on.

19:00.776 --> 19:01.776
[SPEAKER_31]: That's closed off, too.

19:03.277 --> 19:06.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Right here in Sacramento, we got the Olympians.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.514
[SPEAKER_31]: So I went to, we saw a limo there, I wanted to egg it, but anyway.

19:12.155 --> 19:20.139
[SPEAKER_31]: So we went to Sac City, forgetting that the track there was a stadium and all closed off because of whatever zoning law or whatever.

19:20.719 --> 19:22.700
[SPEAKER_31]: So we ended up running at Natomas High School.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.261
[SPEAKER_31]: Now Natomas High School is really nice.

19:26.882 --> 19:29.723
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a very new school, lots of amenities.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.164
[SPEAKER_31]: One would think the track would be paved.

19:32.791 --> 19:33.692
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it's not.

19:34.593 --> 19:45.024
[SPEAKER_31]: And with it being as hot as it was by the time we got there, like around noon, actually no it wasn't around noon, it was around 11, but it was still fairly hot outside.

19:45.064 --> 19:49.990
[SPEAKER_31]: There was wind blowing, the thing is that wind plus dirt equals dirt in your face.

19:50.933 --> 19:54.554
[SPEAKER_18]: So to clarify, you don't rely on DDR for your exercise.

19:54.574 --> 19:56.895
[SPEAKER_18]: You get out there on the track and run, on the dirt track.

19:56.915 --> 20:01.076
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I'm trying to... I have to get where I can run two miles.

20:01.756 --> 20:02.316
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, okay.

20:02.576 --> 20:19.561
[SPEAKER_31]: So right now, what the plan was is walk the first lap to warm up and then run-walk two more and then walk another and run-walk two more and walk another until I can get to where I can do the whole thing

20:20.351 --> 20:23.333
[SPEAKER_31]: Running the straight way, walking the curve, and keep doing it like that.

20:23.353 --> 20:27.857
[SPEAKER_31]: Because a friend of mine who ran track told me that that's how they trained.

20:28.417 --> 20:29.758
[SPEAKER_31]: So I was like, okay, I'll do that.

20:30.178 --> 20:32.720
[SPEAKER_31]: I actually made it a full mile doing the walk run.

20:32.880 --> 20:33.581
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't stop.

20:34.802 --> 20:39.766
[SPEAKER_31]: And did my first lap walking and my last lap walking.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.968
[SPEAKER_31]: Actually, I did another half of that lap on a run.

20:43.068 --> 20:45.149
[SPEAKER_31]: So I made it pretty well.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.512
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm hoping that by the end of the month I can actually at least run a mile.

20:50.239 --> 20:53.460
[SPEAKER_31]: or at least run two laps without feeling like my heart wants to explode.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.620
[SPEAKER_31]: I can breathe just fine though.

20:55.840 --> 20:56.320
[SPEAKER_31]: No asthma.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.481
[SPEAKER_31]: That's another thing about my month.

20:59.681 --> 21:03.522
[SPEAKER_31]: Starting what happened, I think it was the week before Ren Faire.

21:04.783 --> 21:06.443
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm thinking it was either the one before or after.

21:06.463 --> 21:10.744
[SPEAKER_31]: I had a pulmonary exam done to see if I, to prove I didn't have asthma.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.824
[SPEAKER_31]: And I don't have asthma.

21:13.465 --> 21:18.326
[SPEAKER_31]: The way that one of the charts reads is that it has a scale of 1 to 10 and

21:19.795 --> 21:24.336
[SPEAKER_31]: When you take in your first breath, it goes up and then it pans off as you exhale.

21:24.997 --> 21:33.679
[SPEAKER_31]: And six, for the inhale part of that, is about mid-average lung capacity, and I hit an eight out of ten.

21:34.320 --> 21:41.902
[SPEAKER_31]: So I apparently have really awesome, fantastic lungs, and so I'm all good, and I don't have to keep the inhaler anymore.

21:42.022 --> 21:45.383
[SPEAKER_31]: All it took was just losing some weight, and so I've been good with that.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.399
[SPEAKER_31]: And, uh, the Ren Fair was really fun.

21:48.780 --> 21:53.422
[SPEAKER_31]: I was in the chat room, though, on that, for that show, because I was, like, just dead tired after the fair.

21:53.802 --> 21:55.103
[SPEAKER_31]: But they didn't have mead anywhere.

21:55.223 --> 21:55.984
[SPEAKER_31]: I was pissed off.

21:56.564 --> 21:57.725
[SPEAKER_31]: And my bodice was too big.

21:58.285 --> 22:01.307
[SPEAKER_31]: So I didn't have quite the, you know, lusty wench effect.

22:01.907 --> 22:06.430
[SPEAKER_31]: Although some guy asked me to pick up something off of the ground so that he could stare down my cleavage.

22:06.590 --> 22:08.191
[SPEAKER_31]: So, I took it as a compliment.

22:08.351 --> 22:08.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

22:08.811 --> 22:09.411
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I didn't.

22:10.672 --> 22:11.513
[SPEAKER_31]: I told him to pay me.

22:13.294 --> 22:13.714
[SPEAKER_31]: He didn't.

22:14.522 --> 22:24.009
[SPEAKER_31]: There was this adorable little kid there who was in the ultimate... I can't think of the word now.

22:24.069 --> 22:25.330
[SPEAKER_31]: He was in sackcloth.

22:25.530 --> 22:26.010
[SPEAKER_31]: It was great.

22:26.991 --> 22:28.632
[SPEAKER_31]: Just running around in sackcloth the whole time.

22:28.652 --> 22:29.913
[SPEAKER_31]: He looked like he was having a good time.

22:30.093 --> 22:30.814
[SPEAKER_31]: Sackcloth?

22:31.674 --> 22:32.035
[SPEAKER_31]: Burlap.

22:32.415 --> 22:33.596
[SPEAKER_31]: Whatever.

22:33.776 --> 22:35.657
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, but I'm trying to think of the actual term.

22:35.717 --> 22:36.238
[SPEAKER_31]: The peasant.

22:36.658 --> 22:37.018
[SPEAKER_31]: That was it.

22:38.699 --> 22:43.563
[SPEAKER_31]: And there was... Let's see what else.

22:45.513 --> 22:47.414
[SPEAKER_31]: Fourth of July was okay.

22:47.494 --> 22:48.535
[SPEAKER_31]: I was actually sick all day.

22:48.975 --> 22:50.336
[SPEAKER_31]: I was sick practically all the weekend.

22:50.396 --> 22:51.236
[SPEAKER_31]: Dope.

22:51.416 --> 23:02.002
[SPEAKER_31]: But I went to a barbecue at the home of some friends of mine and Dan who are Atkinsing.

23:03.063 --> 23:04.844
[SPEAKER_31]: So there was lots of meat everywhere.

23:05.444 --> 23:06.565
[SPEAKER_31]: Meat everywhere.

23:07.625 --> 23:09.026
[SPEAKER_31]: And no potato salad.

23:09.086 --> 23:11.307
[SPEAKER_31]: Although someone did bring potato salad, but I didn't touch it.

23:12.248 --> 23:12.368
[SPEAKER_31]: And...

23:13.365 --> 23:16.146
[SPEAKER_31]: They had sparklers there, but they had the old ones that are metal.

23:17.366 --> 23:18.066
[SPEAKER_31]: So those were fun.

23:18.306 --> 23:19.026
[SPEAKER_31]: Cool!

23:19.126 --> 23:20.807
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't ever find those kind anymore.

23:21.227 --> 23:23.347
[SPEAKER_31]: I was setting them on fire the whole night.

23:24.828 --> 23:26.628
[SPEAKER_31]: I was just all happy because I had fire.

23:27.588 --> 23:41.712
[SPEAKER_31]: And I've been training somebody at work, and I basically told that I'm going to be sort of like, I guess, like the mentor from now on for a lot of people, for the new hires who come in.

23:41.752 --> 23:42.912
[SPEAKER_31]: So I was like,

23:43.553 --> 23:48.257
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know what to think about that because I like doing it.

23:48.437 --> 23:53.400
[SPEAKER_31]: I like passing on what I know and I like the teaching aspect.

23:53.440 --> 23:56.623
[SPEAKER_31]: But sometimes I want my cubicle to myself.

23:56.743 --> 23:57.924
[SPEAKER_31]: That's like my space.

23:59.185 --> 24:00.185
[SPEAKER_16]: It's your domain.

24:00.266 --> 24:01.947
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to be the master of your domain.

24:03.868 --> 24:06.070
[SPEAKER_31]: But other than that, it's really cool.

24:06.110 --> 24:07.531
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just been an interesting week.

24:08.532 --> 24:09.412
[SPEAKER_31]: I missed my brother.

24:09.592 --> 24:12.895
[SPEAKER_31]: My brother was in Alabama on the fourth weekend.

24:14.651 --> 24:19.394
[SPEAKER_31]: and I wanted to have the money to go see him, but I'm like flat broke right now.

24:20.894 --> 24:21.675
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, what else I did?

24:22.295 --> 24:23.156
[SPEAKER_31]: I enrolled in school.

24:23.956 --> 24:24.396
[SPEAKER_17]: Congrats.

24:24.536 --> 24:25.637
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going back to college.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.598
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going into database management.

24:28.859 --> 24:35.162
[SPEAKER_31]: And so I need a laptop so that I can do my homework wherever I happen to be because half my classes are online.

24:35.683 --> 24:39.385
[SPEAKER_31]: I decided to get a class that I'm not looking forward to out of the way, like right off the bat.

24:39.885 --> 24:41.726
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm taking business law.

24:43.502 --> 24:45.524
[SPEAKER_31]: and I'm just going to take that one in the classroom.

24:45.724 --> 24:46.145
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't care.

24:46.205 --> 24:46.865
[SPEAKER_31]: I want it out of the way.

24:48.106 --> 24:55.914
[SPEAKER_31]: But they're making me take all of the stupid prerequisites that I could test out of if I was able to miss work for it.

24:56.955 --> 25:00.678
[SPEAKER_31]: But I figure it's going to be an easy A and a good buffer against that business law class.

25:00.698 --> 25:08.766
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm having to take like Intro to Windows and beginning word processing and beginning Excel and next semester I'm taking like Access.

25:10.706 --> 25:14.588
[SPEAKER_31]: It's probably going to be around summer when I'm going to have to start taking the crappy programming classes.

25:17.029 --> 25:22.111
[SPEAKER_31]: So that also is going to affect when Pump Up the Volume is.

25:22.531 --> 25:25.893
[SPEAKER_31]: Because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.

25:26.873 --> 25:29.374
[SPEAKER_31]: I get out of class like at 6.45.

25:30.975 --> 25:40.119
[SPEAKER_31]: But because it's also going to break into my gym time on Wednesdays, I'm thinking about moving the show to another night in the week

25:40.997 --> 25:43.719
[SPEAKER_31]: or maybe do two shows late night.

25:45.180 --> 25:52.386
[SPEAKER_31]: Because Monday, I figure if I move the show, then I'll start running on Monday and Wednesday and do spin on Friday.

25:52.526 --> 25:53.967
[SPEAKER_10]: You can always have Tuesday back if you want.

25:54.447 --> 25:55.869
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, that should be easiest.

25:55.969 --> 25:57.290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll just give you Tuesday back.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.131
[SPEAKER_31]: And we can use the old promo again!

25:59.171 --> 25:59.812
[SPEAKER_31]: Yay!

25:59.832 --> 26:00.152
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

26:03.044 --> 26:03.745
[SPEAKER_18]: That does work out.

26:03.845 --> 26:04.806
[SPEAKER_18]: You let me know when you want to do that.

26:05.406 --> 26:06.647
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to be gone for two weeks.

26:06.908 --> 26:11.752
[SPEAKER_18]: And then after I get back from my little work trip, I should have an announcement on what's going to happen with Vanilla Sky.

26:11.812 --> 26:14.094
[SPEAKER_31]: Why don't I just start it this week?

26:14.574 --> 26:15.395
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'll figure something out.

26:15.415 --> 26:15.715
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine.

26:15.796 --> 26:16.616
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll start doing it on Tuesdays.

26:16.736 --> 26:17.177
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, okay.

26:17.357 --> 26:18.298
[SPEAKER_10]: We can shuffle it around.

26:18.358 --> 26:20.260
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll do it two nights in a row.

26:20.280 --> 26:20.740
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't care.

26:20.940 --> 26:21.140
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

26:22.041 --> 26:22.482
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, okay.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.304
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll just go live all week.

26:25.484 --> 26:26.065
[SPEAKER_18]: Fun.

26:26.245 --> 26:27.586
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, yeah, the Jamie experience.

26:27.606 --> 26:28.427
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll figure it out.

26:29.312 --> 26:30.633
[SPEAKER_31]: Everyone's going to get so sick of me.

26:30.814 --> 26:34.097
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll make an official announcement on the website when we figure out the scheduling stuff.

26:34.477 --> 26:36.379
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, and the last bit of news.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.882
[SPEAKER_31]: I have meat, and meat makes me happy.

26:41.024 --> 26:41.765
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations.

26:43.506 --> 26:43.907
Okay, I'm done.

26:44.307 --> 26:44.607
[SPEAKER_18]: All done?

26:44.627 --> 26:45.288
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

26:45.308 --> 26:45.508
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

26:46.489 --> 26:47.951
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, do you have anything you want to share?

26:47.991 --> 26:48.591
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your week?

26:48.912 --> 26:49.692
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, how was your month?

26:49.713 --> 26:50.113
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your day?

26:53.427 --> 26:54.848
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Final Fantasy.

26:55.148 --> 26:56.229
[SPEAKER_14]: I burned things.

26:56.889 --> 26:59.631
[SPEAKER_14]: I got my hard drive loader working.

26:59.691 --> 27:00.812
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Driver 3.

27:07.096 --> 27:09.137
[SPEAKER_31]: I forgot to mention something, so I'm going to have Rob mention it for me.

27:10.238 --> 27:10.418
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

27:11.319 --> 27:13.420
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, I saw Spider-Man 2.

27:14.401 --> 27:18.123
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw Fahrenheit 9-11 twice.

27:19.224 --> 27:19.804
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw...

27:22.455 --> 27:23.296
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, some other movie.

27:24.397 --> 27:27.739
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, not much that really happened.

27:28.260 --> 27:29.301
[SPEAKER_14]: What do I say every week?

27:29.381 --> 27:30.582
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing happened during the week.

27:30.942 --> 27:32.943
[SPEAKER_14]: Multiply that times four, that was my month.

27:34.725 --> 27:37.207
[SPEAKER_14]: Or, you know, two weeks, half a month, I guess.

27:37.567 --> 27:42.811
[SPEAKER_31]: No, your week was playing Final Fantasy XI all night.

27:43.552 --> 27:52.059
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, my fiancee Nellie, who's been on the show a few times, she got a job at my work doing Mailer Room, and she loves it.

27:52.789 --> 28:20.907
[SPEAKER_14]: and, um, I'm trying to think what else I did, oh, today I put together the PC that's going to go in the cabinet that's been sitting here for months, not just collecting dust, so it will be functional soon, so possibly the webcam will come back, hooray, and then, um, what else, um, and there's other things, but I'll mention them later, I'm sure, yeah.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.169
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:42.069 --> 28:43.590
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought I was going to die or something.

28:43.630 --> 28:48.511
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, seriously, I don't know if you've ever had hiccups, but usually they last, what, like a half hour at the most?

28:48.831 --> 28:52.912
[SPEAKER_18]: I had it on and off for like 90 minute intervals for three days.

28:53.393 --> 28:54.133
[SPEAKER_18]: It was horrid.

28:54.833 --> 28:58.954
[SPEAKER_18]: So I finally had to go to the doctor, and I swear to God, my doctor was going to laugh at me.

28:59.174 --> 29:00.815
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, you got the hiccups?

29:01.889 --> 29:03.270
[SPEAKER_18]: You coming in here because you got hiccups?

29:03.631 --> 29:04.852
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, it's been three days!

29:04.932 --> 29:05.753
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not normal!

29:06.293 --> 29:07.394
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got brain cancer!

29:07.414 --> 29:08.896
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I went on to WebMD.com.

29:08.936 --> 29:15.682
[SPEAKER_18]: I swear to God, if you go on WebMD, and you type in, like, hiccups, like, reoccurring, it'll tell you, like, oh, you might have brain cancer.

29:15.702 --> 29:16.583
[SPEAKER_18]: You better go get checked out.

29:16.703 --> 29:17.664
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not a tumor.

29:18.584 --> 29:19.766
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I went to the doctor.

29:19.806 --> 29:21.807
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, doctor, I think I have brain cancer.

29:21.928 --> 29:22.148
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

29:22.168 --> 29:23.009
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I have hiccups.

29:25.511 --> 29:27.393
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um...

29:29.725 --> 29:31.226
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, what else happened besides that?

29:31.306 --> 29:32.606
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, my birthday happened.

29:32.827 --> 29:33.847
[SPEAKER_18]: God, that was wild now.

29:34.587 --> 29:35.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday, Rob!

29:35.708 --> 29:36.188
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.549
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of my friends threw me a surprise party, which was really cute.

29:39.629 --> 29:43.010
[SPEAKER_18]: And my cake said, Happy Birthday, Dr. Dick, which was really cute.

29:43.051 --> 29:44.031
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and I got this.

29:44.411 --> 29:46.032
[SPEAKER_18]: I got the answer to the ferret here.

29:46.532 --> 29:47.752
[SPEAKER_18]: I got this new little toy here.

29:47.792 --> 29:48.593
[SPEAKER_18]: What's this guy's name?

29:48.733 --> 29:49.273
[SPEAKER_18]: Does he have a name?

29:50.313 --> 29:54.275
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Trash Talkers, and this guy's name... Marshall!

29:54.635 --> 29:55.695
[SPEAKER_31]: I left your present at home.

29:55.936 --> 29:56.936
[SPEAKER_18]: And Marshall... Oh, that's all good.

29:57.600 --> 30:04.343
[SPEAKER_18]: Marshall is this guy, and he's wearing a lavender shirt and lavender pants with a little rainbow flag on it, and let's see some of the things that Marshall has to say.

30:07.624 --> 30:07.985
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, shit.

30:08.025 --> 30:09.665
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to whack him in the head to get him to say something.

30:10.806 --> 30:11.866
You can barely hear it.

30:11.926 --> 30:17.128
I don't think our listeners can hear it at all.

30:17.148 --> 30:17.689
That's great.

30:27.850 --> 30:29.173
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's my answer to the ferret.

30:29.213 --> 30:32.780
[SPEAKER_18]: So whenever you start up with a ferret... Oh, there, I think his speaker's in the front here.

30:36.688 --> 30:37.309
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, anyway.

30:41.345 --> 30:43.586
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, what else?

30:44.006 --> 30:46.187
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think I've played a single game of DDR.

30:46.947 --> 30:48.008
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I take that back.

30:48.148 --> 30:50.469
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually, I was hanging out with Navi, our poppin' music whore.

30:51.029 --> 30:55.631
[SPEAKER_18]: I was hanging out with him on Friday, and I beat a 31 on poppin' music.

30:55.651 --> 30:56.411
[SPEAKER_18]: That made me so happy.

30:56.471 --> 30:57.851
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, on the arcade controller.

30:58.312 --> 30:59.392
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I was all jazzed.

30:59.852 --> 31:01.613
[SPEAKER_18]: I know some of you out there are better, but don't hate!

31:02.629 --> 31:03.209
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm getting better.

31:03.589 --> 31:06.910
[SPEAKER_18]: But we actually played DDR, like on an ignition pad and everything.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.451
[SPEAKER_18]: We were playing DDR Extreme at home.

31:09.071 --> 31:12.272
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was so great because I was still doing really well.

31:12.752 --> 31:14.493
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also got DDR for my Xbox.

31:14.553 --> 31:18.574
[SPEAKER_18]: Those of you that were listening to episode 101 heard the confession that I bought an Xbox.

31:19.254 --> 31:22.756
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've been playing DDR on live a little bit.

31:22.876 --> 31:29.838
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've got to say, it's very interesting to play DDR on Xbox Live because people can talk on the microphones and stuff.

31:30.538 --> 31:32.439
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to play Phantasy Star with me.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.821
[SPEAKER_18]: That's extra money.

31:45.042 --> 31:45.662
[SPEAKER_18]: That's more money.

31:45.822 --> 31:46.844
[SPEAKER_18]: You know how many MMORPGs I'm playing?

31:46.864 --> 31:47.544
[SPEAKER_18]: PSO is cheap.

31:48.646 --> 31:49.266
[SPEAKER_31]: PSO is $9.

31:49.627 --> 31:50.268
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll see.

31:50.288 --> 31:50.608
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

31:50.908 --> 31:52.090
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, okay, so then I'd be on PSO.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.231
[SPEAKER_31]: And then they forget to charge you.

31:53.691 --> 31:54.512
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be on PSO.

31:54.833 --> 31:57.916
[SPEAKER_18]: Then I'd be on Ragnarok, because Jamie found this free server.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.238
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I didn't find it.

31:59.278 --> 32:00.039
[SPEAKER_31]: Marenchan found it.

32:00.059 --> 32:00.359
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, sorry.

32:00.399 --> 32:03.523
[SPEAKER_18]: Marenchan found this free server that we've all been playing Ragnarok on now.

32:03.583 --> 32:03.963
[SPEAKER_31]: The 60th.

32:06.232 --> 32:12.784
[SPEAKER_31]: With the 60 times experience and 30 times drops?

32:12.804 --> 32:14.027
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, something like that.

32:14.047 --> 32:14.548
[SPEAKER_18]: It's crazy.

32:16.010 --> 32:16.091
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

32:17.307 --> 32:20.570
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've got that, the free Ragnarok server.

32:20.610 --> 32:24.834
[SPEAKER_18]: And now, okay, Final Fantasy XI, when I reinstalled everything for the computer, it broke.

32:24.934 --> 32:31.261
[SPEAKER_18]: It was fucked up, my graphics were flickering, it was screwed up beyond belief, and I was never going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI again.

32:31.861 --> 32:34.023
[SPEAKER_18]: Last night, it finally got fixed.

32:34.404 --> 32:39.949
[SPEAKER_18]: Finally got fixed last night because the way to fix it, I had to install some drivers that are two years old for my card.

32:40.309 --> 32:41.010
[SPEAKER_18]: And now it works.

32:41.711 --> 32:41.851
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

32:43.497 --> 33:11.692
[SPEAKER_18]: now I'm back on there so that would be three MMORPGs I'm wasting my time with I bitch enough about how I don't have enough time to play like real console games like I've been trying to play Mega Man Collection barely have any time I finally have sat down with Silent Hill 2 and I'm only about halfway through that because I'm so I have video game ADD is basically what it boils down to I sit down this is especially bad when I have emulation I play a game for like literally like 10 seconds and then I'm done with it and I want to do another game so yes Jamie

33:12.008 --> 33:14.629
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to answer Angel's question real quick.

33:15.530 --> 33:30.637
[SPEAKER_31]: If you go onto, and this is sort of, I'm not meaning to plug my own stuff here, but if you go to roleplay.darksakura.com, look in the Ragnarok online folder, you'll see an announcement there posted regarding playing the free Ragnarok server.

33:32.098 --> 33:32.318
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway.

33:37.216 --> 33:42.100
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so that was pretty much my week and my day, or my month and my day, really.

33:43.601 --> 33:46.463
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you play any Bomani at all through this whole month, Jamie?

33:46.623 --> 33:49.645
[SPEAKER_31]: I did, and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was.

33:50.606 --> 33:59.152
[SPEAKER_31]: I played some pop and music when we had the first Dorama night, and I played DDR!

33:59.712 --> 34:00.092
[SPEAKER_18]: Did ya?

34:01.093 --> 34:01.573
[SPEAKER_18]: Amazing.

34:01.614 --> 34:02.594
[SPEAKER_31]: Tamarik was in town.

34:03.295 --> 34:03.535
[SPEAKER_18]: Mm-hmm.

34:04.704 --> 34:07.886
[SPEAKER_31]: and we went to Fry's and I played TDR in Fry's.

34:08.766 --> 34:09.067
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

34:11.628 --> 34:22.936
[SPEAKER_14]: I also bought, because it just came out a couple weeks ago, I bought the You Got Served Taken to the Streets DVD, which is the instructional videos on how to do all the choreography and I thought that was sweet.

34:22.976 --> 34:23.256
[SPEAKER_31]: Funny.

34:23.596 --> 34:24.417
[SPEAKER_14]: Haven't watched it yet, but

34:25.123 --> 34:31.228
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the, uh, I actually bought, I was also probably one of the only people on the face of the earth that bought Darren's Dance Grooves.

34:31.268 --> 34:32.609
[SPEAKER_14]: I have that DVD also.

34:33.169 --> 34:38.894
[SPEAKER_14]: Just in case if I ever won these days aside, you know, I feel like getting in shape and doing freestyle.

34:39.234 --> 34:41.396
[SPEAKER_14]: Just in case if that dark day ever comes.

34:42.577 --> 34:43.097
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be ready.

34:45.859 --> 34:46.239
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

34:47.847 --> 34:54.352
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I think we're going to take a break, and then we're going to come back and we're going to do some real Babani news.

34:54.392 --> 34:58.856
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we missed a lot of news stories while we were gone, our little bit of downtime.

34:58.896 --> 34:59.957
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to talk about some of that.

35:01.218 --> 35:04.720
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to take a break, and Jamie requested a Gradius break.

35:05.041 --> 35:05.801
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to do that.

35:06.362 --> 35:07.443
[SPEAKER_31]: That makes me go squeak.

35:07.543 --> 35:09.024
[SPEAKER_18]: So what is a Gradius break, Jamie?

35:09.444 --> 35:12.787
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I guess it's not just Gradius, but it's all of the...

35:13.402 --> 35:15.563
[SPEAKER_31]: Games featuring the Vic Viper, I guess.

35:16.263 --> 35:21.145
[SPEAKER_31]: Sensation is from the second stage of Life Force, Salamander 2.

35:23.726 --> 35:27.007
[SPEAKER_31]: And Burning Heat was, of course, the first stage of Gradius 2.

35:27.947 --> 35:32.349
[SPEAKER_31]: And then the Gradius full option mix, which was all the music from the first Gradius.

35:32.648 --> 35:39.254
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so we're going to do these songs, and then we'll do some chat rooms requests and some pop-in music, so we'll do that in a later break.

35:40.515 --> 35:43.238
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, some actual Bomani news when we come back.

35:44.119 --> 35:44.559
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back!

35:44.579 --> 35:44.559
... ...

36:58.661 --> 36:59.643
Thanks for watching!

39:22.185 --> 39:23.992
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

41:07.412 --> 41:08.273
Thanks for watching!

41:29.537 --> 41:32.722
[SPEAKER_18]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

41:32.982 --> 41:35.145
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

41:35.285 --> 41:35.946
[SPEAKER_18]: Just kidding.

41:36.387 --> 41:39.110
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bavani Radio.

41:41.894 --> 41:45.779
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back live, Orange Lounge Radio, episode 102 in progress.

41:46.977 --> 41:52.878
[SPEAKER_18]: Some folks out there are telling me there might be a little bit of skipping going on with some of the stuff we're playing.

41:54.098 --> 41:56.499
[SPEAKER_18]: We're using a new encoder program tonight.

41:56.539 --> 42:01.380
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually not new, it's the one we used to use like a long time ago between episodes like 1 and 60.

42:02.460 --> 42:05.041
[SPEAKER_18]: But they updated it so it does the MP3 Pro thing now.

42:05.341 --> 42:10.982
[SPEAKER_18]: If you guys don't hear us in stereo, all you gotta do is download the MP3 Pro codec and you'll hear us in stereo.

42:11.442 --> 42:15.903
[SPEAKER_18]: But I guess maybe it's causing things to skip a little bit if I do too much in the background, so...

42:17.439 --> 42:44.929
[SPEAKER_18]: it's not everyone that's getting it though yeah I don't know weird we'll see we'll see yeah we'll see I don't know yeah I know my computer is like now it's a 3.2 gigahertz machine now I would think it has enough you know juice in there to handle everything and not make things skip but I don't know technology amazes me some days I don't know we'll see I can always try the new video card I think it has to do with I have too much video going on we'll see we'll see

42:45.939 --> 42:47.919
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back, Orange Lounge Radio.

42:49.200 --> 42:54.161
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to talk about some stuff that's been going on in the Bomani news scene while we've been gone for the past three weeks.

42:55.341 --> 43:00.362
[SPEAKER_18]: First off, this story kind of came out not too long after we had our last show.

43:01.722 --> 43:06.003
[SPEAKER_18]: You probably all heard about this, but we haven't had a chance to make fun of it yet, so I'm bringing it up again.

43:07.104 --> 43:13.065
[SPEAKER_18]: This girl, I'm sure you've heard, but she had a heart attack or something like that while playing DDR.

43:14.844 --> 43:15.845
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, that's the short story.

43:15.905 --> 43:24.012
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, really what it is, is that that's kind of what the media says in all these headlines, is that, oh my god, girl almost died playing DDR.

43:24.293 --> 43:26.034
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR kills teen.

43:26.354 --> 43:29.277
[SPEAKER_31]: Did they bring up that it was a pre-existing condition?

43:29.357 --> 43:30.198
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course not.

43:31.124 --> 43:32.064
[SPEAKER_18]: But here's the headline.

43:32.425 --> 43:35.006
[SPEAKER_18]: Heart condition strikes girl down at arcade.

43:35.226 --> 43:36.427
[SPEAKER_18]: Now see, that's not so bad.

43:36.807 --> 43:44.631
[SPEAKER_18]: But then if you go on to like GameSpot or something, GameSpot's headline was something like, girl gets heart problem while playing DDR or something like that.

43:44.691 --> 43:48.533
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of like, it sort of infers that DDR caused the problem.

43:48.773 --> 43:50.514
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR did not cause the problem.

43:52.565 --> 43:55.727
[SPEAKER_31]: If she had been out running, the same damn thing would have happened.

43:56.228 --> 43:59.610
[SPEAKER_31]: If she had been rollerblading, the same thing would have happened.

43:59.630 --> 44:02.231
[SPEAKER_18]: If she had been masturbating, the same thing would have happened.

44:02.251 --> 44:03.532
[SPEAKER_31]: I have heard of that, okay?

44:07.194 --> 44:08.395
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that for a climax?

44:10.136 --> 44:11.017
[SPEAKER_14]: It's heart-stopping.

44:11.037 --> 44:15.519
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my God, I'm dead.

44:15.920 --> 44:16.220
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it.

44:16.820 --> 44:17.100
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it.

44:17.841 --> 44:18.842
[SPEAKER_27]: I just came in my eye.

44:19.282 --> 44:19.402
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

44:19.462 --> 44:19.542
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

44:23.611 --> 44:23.931
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

44:24.972 --> 44:28.375
[SPEAKER_31]: The thing is, is that the media... If she had been eating a donut, that would have happened.

44:28.395 --> 44:32.398
[SPEAKER_18]: All I could hear in the bathroom was masturbating in the crowd-making stream.

44:32.418 --> 44:34.280
[SPEAKER_18]: It's alright, it's alright.

44:34.360 --> 44:44.209
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's listen to this lovely news story brought to us by TheOmahaChannel.com And hopefully you guys don't get a lot of skipping, but let's hear what happened to our friend here in Omaha.

44:47.652 --> 44:47.952
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll just...

44:49.337 --> 45:01.866
[SPEAKER_26]: The sign outside the Bellevue Arcade has been up for nearly one week.

45:02.266 --> 45:03.667
[SPEAKER_26]: Get well soon, Kimber.

45:03.827 --> 45:04.908
[SPEAKER_26]: Ooh, yeah.

45:04.988 --> 45:06.829
[SPEAKER_26]: A 15-year-old is doing just that.

45:07.329 --> 45:09.131
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't remember too much.

45:09.911 --> 45:10.411
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Loki.

45:10.812 --> 45:12.653
[SPEAKER_18]: She's all, ooh, yeah, donut.

45:13.894 --> 45:14.474
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop it.

45:15.115 --> 45:15.635
[SPEAKER_27]: Stop it.

45:16.776 --> 45:18.677
[SPEAKER_18]: You are very rude, Mr. Loki.

45:20.757 --> 45:21.438
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on.

45:21.758 --> 45:24.840
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that a midget playing DDR on the right side?

45:24.960 --> 45:26.421
[SPEAKER_26]: It looks like a midget.

45:26.461 --> 45:27.242
[SPEAKER_26]: That's Tyler Durden.

45:27.262 --> 45:28.443
[SPEAKER_26]: She then fell to the floor.

45:45.151 --> 45:47.613
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well see, she was playing I Do, I Do, I Do.

45:47.713 --> 45:48.454
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what happened.

45:49.214 --> 45:53.498
[SPEAKER_18]: She heard that song and she was like, Ah, Christ, this song sucks!

45:53.818 --> 45:54.499
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna die.

45:57.501 --> 45:58.942
[SPEAKER_18]: We're being really horrible, you guys.

45:58.982 --> 46:01.945
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're not trying to be mean, but we accomplished... What?

46:02.005 --> 46:02.185
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

46:02.865 --> 46:04.447
[SPEAKER_18]: She played this song, Broken My Heart.

46:06.148 --> 46:06.909
[SPEAKER_18]: That joke...

46:07.848 --> 46:08.949
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, give me a break.

46:09.029 --> 46:10.991
[SPEAKER_18]: That joke is so used.

46:11.591 --> 46:15.555
[SPEAKER_18]: That was like the first freaking thing you heard on every message board.

46:16.015 --> 46:17.497
[SPEAKER_18]: First thing on every message board.

46:21.700 --> 46:24.563
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, what a crappy song.

46:24.583 --> 46:28.026
[SPEAKER_18]: I do, I do, I do.

46:28.046 --> 46:29.807
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't, I don't, I don't.

46:30.168 --> 46:30.548
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

46:30.768 --> 46:31.709
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's continue with the news story here.

46:32.319 --> 46:44.624
[SPEAKER_26]: Now how many times do you get to hear the word defibrillator in the news, huh?

46:45.844 --> 46:46.985
[SPEAKER_26]: That's such an awesome word.

46:47.265 --> 46:48.065
[SPEAKER_18]: Defibrillator.

46:48.345 --> 46:51.626
[SPEAKER_18]: I challenge all of our listeners to use the word defibrillator in a sentence today.

46:52.687 --> 46:54.928
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you shove a defibrillator up your ass?

46:57.989 --> 47:01.330
[SPEAKER_31]: Because, keep in mind that the media is typically too tight-ass to...

47:03.427 --> 47:03.947
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

47:04.288 --> 47:04.648
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

47:04.868 --> 47:05.168
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

47:05.569 --> 47:07.490
[SPEAKER_26]: Hypertrophy cardiomyopathy.

47:08.091 --> 47:09.592
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'll say that three times fast.

47:11.073 --> 47:15.496
[SPEAKER_18]: Hydro, wait, let's see if it, hydrotrophy cardiomyopathy.

47:16.277 --> 47:17.177
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally fucked that up.

47:17.618 --> 47:18.719
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, it totally sounds made up.

47:18.739 --> 47:19.499
[SPEAKER_18]: It has to do with water.

47:19.559 --> 47:20.340
[SPEAKER_18]: This is real.

47:20.760 --> 47:21.581
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a real infection.

47:21.641 --> 47:23.662
[SPEAKER_18]: You could have this and you could get this.

47:24.063 --> 47:27.085
[SPEAKER_31]: No, he probably doesn't have it and you probably can't catch it.

47:28.146 --> 47:28.526
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

47:29.400 --> 47:33.623
[SPEAKER_26]: The walls around her heart are so thick, her heart wasn't getting the signals to beat.

47:33.983 --> 47:40.727
[SPEAKER_24]: You could be asleep, you could be walking, running, sitting down to eat, and it can hit you.

47:42.588 --> 47:44.109
[SPEAKER_14]: Sitting down to eat, and it could hit you.

47:47.371 --> 47:51.133
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it could have been that she's like, Mongo need food!

47:51.153 --> 47:55.116
[SPEAKER_31]: A translation for Spaceboy, who I guess is one of our new listeners.

47:55.858 --> 47:58.101
[SPEAKER_31]: It's the paddle thing that they put on you to clear.

47:58.141 --> 48:00.023
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is, what is a defibrillator?

48:01.305 --> 48:04.007
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, if you ever watch ER or something and you hear them go, clear!

48:04.028 --> 48:08.953
[SPEAKER_18]: And then they put those paddles on somebody and then the body bounces, that's a defibrillator.

48:08.973 --> 48:11.996
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to see someone that doesn't clear when that happens.

48:12.116 --> 48:14.539
[SPEAKER_14]: I want them to be like, you're going to be okay!

48:14.599 --> 48:15.700
[SPEAKER_14]: And just get thrown back.

48:15.841 --> 48:16.541
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be great.

48:17.582 --> 48:27.871
[SPEAKER_18]: Defibulator has always been comedy gold in movies like Naked Gun and stuff like that.

48:27.931 --> 48:29.592
[SPEAKER_18]: So, anyway, moving on.

48:29.612 --> 48:31.634
[SPEAKER_26]: I would just like to point something out there, though.

48:31.654 --> 48:33.295
[SPEAKER_26]: The mother says, what's so damn funny, Jamie?

48:47.825 --> 48:49.126
[SPEAKER_29]: Ah ha ha, that's funny.

48:49.947 --> 48:55.813
[SPEAKER_18]: The mother says, in this story, the mother says she was at the right place with all the people needed around there to help her.

48:56.914 --> 48:59.116
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR almost kills a teen.

48:59.376 --> 49:04.020
[SPEAKER_18]: It murdered a teenager because she was playing a bad song and her heart just stopped.

49:04.300 --> 49:05.722
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR is bad for people.

49:05.762 --> 49:10.626
[SPEAKER_18]: Yet the mother says she was in the right place at the right time with all the right people around her.

49:12.608 --> 49:13.449
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR kills!

49:16.772 --> 49:21.015
[SPEAKER_14]: Truth is, they don't really want their daughter, and they were hoping that she would die so they can collect the insurance.

49:21.035 --> 49:21.775
[SPEAKER_14]: That is mean.

49:21.895 --> 49:22.635
[SPEAKER_14]: That is just mean.

49:22.655 --> 49:23.876
[SPEAKER_31]: First off, first off.

49:23.956 --> 49:24.437
[SPEAKER_14]: Rude.

49:24.697 --> 49:25.337
[SPEAKER_14]: So rude.

49:25.377 --> 49:26.037
[SPEAKER_31]: How old was she?

49:26.458 --> 49:26.958
[SPEAKER_18]: Fifteen.

49:27.698 --> 49:34.843
[SPEAKER_31]: First and foremost, her parents should have been doing their goddamn job, okay?

49:35.243 --> 49:36.964
[SPEAKER_31]: They knew she had a heart condition, right?

49:37.384 --> 49:38.305
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't think they did.

49:38.625 --> 49:38.905
[SPEAKER_31]: Really?

49:39.425 --> 49:40.326
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think so.

49:42.452 --> 49:43.212
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't say.

49:43.272 --> 49:44.492
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, interestingly enough, they don't say.

49:44.793 --> 49:47.473
[SPEAKER_31]: I heard that it was a known pre-existing condition.

49:48.193 --> 49:51.174
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, people are going to say things in this situation.

49:53.595 --> 49:58.056
[SPEAKER_31]: My question is... You don't catch heart disease from playing DDR.

49:58.556 --> 50:01.376
[SPEAKER_31]: It's because there's something wrong with you, okay?

50:02.557 --> 50:04.137
[SPEAKER_31]: You have a condition.

50:05.858 --> 50:06.898
[SPEAKER_18]: I am almost positive.

50:06.918 --> 50:11.939
[SPEAKER_18]: To be honest, I'm almost positive they did not know beforehand because of the next part of this little article.

50:17.639 --> 50:28.285
[SPEAKER_26]: So, she's now on medication and she now has a pacemaker.

50:28.325 --> 50:31.527
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm assuming if they knew about the condition before, they would have given her the pacemaker before.

50:32.067 --> 50:36.770
[SPEAKER_31]: The thing is that that's still not something that playing a game of DDR is going to cause.

50:37.030 --> 50:38.811
[SPEAKER_14]: And who is the maker of this pacemaker?

50:39.071 --> 50:39.612
[SPEAKER_14]: Konami.

50:39.872 --> 50:41.333
[SPEAKER_13]: I smell conspiracy.

50:42.836 --> 50:46.779
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you know it's Black Ops Konami?

50:50.442 --> 51:05.733
[SPEAKER_18]: Well they make casino games and a lot of people didn't know that, I mean... They make pachinko machines, they could very well make pacemakers.

51:06.354 --> 51:09.356
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, this girl will be playing Para Para Paradise for the rest of her life.

51:10.877 --> 51:11.578
[SPEAKER_18]: God help everybody.

51:13.337 --> 51:14.698
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, she'll be switching to Pump It Up.

51:14.758 --> 51:16.299
[SPEAKER_31]: She'll be switching to Technomotion.

51:18.340 --> 51:24.244
[SPEAKER_26]: Timber and her parents wanted to thank all of the people who helped to revive her, including the arcade owners, the police officer, and the paramedics.

51:24.644 --> 51:27.226
[SPEAKER_26]: All of those rescuers have been checking up on her in the hospital.

51:27.546 --> 51:29.387
[SPEAKER_24]: Patricia, the heart problem is genetic?

51:29.427 --> 51:30.188
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what we're told.

51:30.248 --> 51:32.549
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, her mother got checked and has a mild form of it.

51:32.809 --> 51:34.490
[SPEAKER_26]: And the rest of the family is getting checked out, too.

51:34.550 --> 51:37.132
[SPEAKER_26]: A simple echocardiogram can usually detect the disease.

51:37.654 --> 51:38.174
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

51:38.254 --> 51:41.315
[SPEAKER_18]: So it sounds like they didn't know about it because the mom's getting checked now.

51:41.335 --> 51:42.156
[SPEAKER_18]: They're all getting checked.

51:42.376 --> 51:45.197
[SPEAKER_18]: They're having this electrocardiogram to figure out who's got the heart condition.

51:45.777 --> 51:47.458
[SPEAKER_31]: But see, that shows right there.

51:47.698 --> 51:56.341
[SPEAKER_31]: That right there is proof that the doctors themselves don't think DDR did it, which of course they're going to be smarter than them, and checking it as a genetic condition.

51:57.322 --> 52:03.024
[SPEAKER_14]: What would happen if this story was girl gets heart attack from playing Grand Theft Auto?

52:03.924 --> 52:04.825
[SPEAKER_31]: That would be great.

52:05.125 --> 52:05.445
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean...

52:07.155 --> 52:09.116
[SPEAKER_14]: The bullets were so real, it struck my heart.

52:12.137 --> 52:13.197
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, thanks for sharing.

52:13.998 --> 52:15.178
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's the end of the story.

52:17.179 --> 52:20.200
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really... What if that poor girl's listening to us?

52:20.240 --> 52:23.761
[SPEAKER_18]: What if that poor girl's an Orange Lounge Radio fan, and here we are making fun of her plight?

52:23.781 --> 52:25.682
[SPEAKER_31]: We're not making fun of her plight.

52:25.942 --> 52:28.763
[SPEAKER_31]: We're making fun of the stupid people who don't understand it.

52:28.903 --> 52:29.224
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

52:32.285 --> 52:35.546
[SPEAKER_18]: Just remember that Loki's an equal opportunity offender, and we love everybody equally.

52:37.843 --> 52:39.704
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm so glad that the microphone can't pick Loki up right now.

52:39.884 --> 52:40.565
[SPEAKER_31]: I am so glad.

52:40.605 --> 52:40.905
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

52:40.945 --> 52:41.825
[SPEAKER_31]: I guess that's that for that story.

52:41.845 --> 52:43.706
[SPEAKER_31]: Anything else you want to say about the girl with the heart thing?

53:08.752 --> 53:24.830
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, people, if you think, if your heart kind of tingles sometimes, or you think your heart might, there's something non-normal about your heart, like you feel it, like, you know, tingling a lot, and you suddenly can't feel your arm someday, tingle, not tinkle.

53:25.431 --> 53:28.014
[SPEAKER_18]: If your heart tingles, you've got a whole nother problem, okay?

53:28.576 --> 53:37.238
[SPEAKER_18]: If your heart's tingling a little bit or your hand hurts or you find that you're losing feeling in your leg when you're playing DDR, please go see a doctor.

53:37.579 --> 53:43.620
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can go to my doctor because I think I have the hiccups for too long, you can go to your doctor because you might have a heart condition.

53:43.700 --> 53:48.542
[SPEAKER_18]: Get that little electrocardiogram and please keep DDR out of the news for this kind of crap.

53:50.062 --> 53:53.503
[SPEAKER_14]: If the rest of your body is thick, then your heart's probably going to be thick too.

53:57.441 --> 54:01.224
[SPEAKER_14]: My head is just large, as Bug said, unlike Loki's head.

54:05.108 --> 54:16.258
[SPEAKER_18]: One day, Loki, you are going to get smited down from the heavens above with some horrible, horrific story, and everybody you've ever made fun of in the past is going to be there to make fun of you.

54:17.299 --> 54:18.300
[SPEAKER_18]: Woo!

54:19.061 --> 54:19.961
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god!

54:20.962 --> 54:22.083
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh wait, that's ironic.

54:24.164 --> 54:26.725
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I keep telling people I'm going to die an ironic death.

54:26.805 --> 54:27.325
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be funny.

54:27.345 --> 54:27.705
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't worry.

54:29.265 --> 54:31.366
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to... Or drown on an airplane or something.

54:31.386 --> 54:32.186
[SPEAKER_31]: This is my disclaimer.

54:32.586 --> 54:41.309
[SPEAKER_31]: That for everybody who thinks that DDR was... You know, her playing DDR contributed to an aggravation of that condition.

54:41.789 --> 54:46.630
[SPEAKER_31]: But for anyone who thinks that DDR caused the condition, I'm laughing at you and pointing my finger.

54:46.810 --> 54:47.550
[SPEAKER_14]: But it did.

54:47.751 --> 54:49.251
[SPEAKER_14]: It's devil, devil revolution.

54:52.116 --> 54:53.617
[SPEAKER_29]: I hit Rob instead.

54:55.778 --> 55:01.081
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys are so insensitive.

55:01.882 --> 55:06.705
[SPEAKER_18]: We should call ourselves Orange Lounge Insensitive Radio because that's what we are, you guys.

55:08.006 --> 55:11.188
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't play DDR if you are 500 pounds and can't feel your arm.

55:12.048 --> 55:13.329
[SPEAKER_31]: No, play DDR.

55:13.749 --> 55:14.249
[SPEAKER_31]: Please.

55:15.270 --> 55:16.251
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, Loki.

55:16.491 --> 55:18.472
[SPEAKER_14]: If you throw your arm, that's just going to be disturbing.

55:25.273 --> 55:26.954
[SPEAKER_18]: I really don't know where to take the show from here.

55:27.355 --> 55:27.695
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

55:28.996 --> 55:32.838
[SPEAKER_14]: Did her falling down and having a heart attack cause vibrations that disturbed the neighbors?

55:33.259 --> 55:34.700
[SPEAKER_31]: Just stop it.

55:34.900 --> 55:35.340
[SPEAKER_31]: Just stop.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.161
[SPEAKER_31]: Was she really overweight?

55:36.301 --> 55:36.541
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

55:37.042 --> 55:37.682
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I don't know.

55:41.845 --> 55:42.565
[SPEAKER_18]: She looked healthy.

55:43.546 --> 55:44.787
[SPEAKER_13]: Did she pass her song?

55:47.289 --> 55:48.550
[SPEAKER_13]: Did she perfect attack it?

55:49.030 --> 55:51.032
[SPEAKER_18]: Did she pass her song?

55:52.112 --> 55:53.193
[SPEAKER_18]: God damn!

55:53.473 --> 55:54.294
[SPEAKER_31]: How many misses?

55:58.854 --> 56:03.656
[SPEAKER_18]: She was a shape that a lot of people are, okay?

56:03.756 --> 56:07.777
[SPEAKER_18]: She's just... No, I wouldn't say that.

56:07.817 --> 56:11.979
[SPEAKER_18]: She didn't look to the point where it was morbid, okay?

56:12.059 --> 56:13.800
[SPEAKER_18]: She just looked healthy.

56:14.520 --> 56:18.321
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, you know, she just... God.

56:20.082 --> 56:21.362
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to get letters from this.

56:23.303 --> 56:24.423
[SPEAKER_18]: We never do get hate mail.

56:24.764 --> 56:25.124
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know.

56:25.204 --> 56:25.744
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

56:27.435 --> 56:28.876
[SPEAKER_18]: Our chatroom's going, moving on!

56:29.856 --> 56:30.817
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree, moving on.

56:31.937 --> 56:33.978
[SPEAKER_18]: This week we get a brand new Bomani game.

56:34.498 --> 56:42.942
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we haven't talked about it a whole lot on this show, but Karaoke Revolution 2 is still slated to come out July 13th.

56:43.222 --> 56:45.683
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Jamie, there's something you can do while I'm gone.

56:47.304 --> 56:50.065
[SPEAKER_31]: Not just no, but hell no, I don't think.

56:51.145 --> 56:52.866
[SPEAKER_31]: I was in band for a reason.

56:55.904 --> 57:18.000
[SPEAKER_18]: If you look at the box art, it's interesting because it's red instead of blue, and it's got all new songs in it, some new modes, we've talked about it enough before on this show, but it is coming out relatively soon, hopefully you got your pre-orders in, if you didn't, well, you're not supporting Konami, and we won't have any more DDR ever again, thanks to you.

57:23.038 --> 57:23.819
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

57:24.599 --> 57:28.002
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, so we know Karaoke Revolution 2 is coming out.

57:28.022 --> 57:29.824
[SPEAKER_18]: We still have Xtreme on the way.

57:30.244 --> 57:32.346
[SPEAKER_18]: We still have DDR Ultimix 2 on the way.

57:32.386 --> 57:33.707
[SPEAKER_18]: But what's going on in Japan?

57:34.208 --> 57:35.469
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't heard a whole lot about what's going on.

57:35.489 --> 57:36.850
[SPEAKER_29]: Beautiful, blissful news.

57:36.910 --> 57:38.552
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, beautiful, blissful news from Japan.

57:38.592 --> 57:40.814
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't heard a whole lot.

57:40.834 --> 57:41.294
[SPEAKER_29]: Shut up.

57:41.755 --> 57:42.835
[SPEAKER_18]: Quite the opposite, Loki.

57:43.176 --> 57:46.999
[SPEAKER_18]: We did get an announcement that 8th Style is, in fact, on the way.

57:47.019 --> 57:49.101
[SPEAKER_18]: 8th Style will be coming to the home soon.

57:50.616 --> 58:09.380
[SPEAKER_31]: more guitar freaks also I thought more guitar freaks would make me happy but it's not going to happen I thought that because it did so well they were going to look into their other games if they do, sign me up because I need more guitar dota at home

58:12.438 --> 58:15.561
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so basically their website says something to this effect.

58:15.821 --> 58:20.646
[SPEAKER_18]: Because 7th Style did better than they thought it would do, they're going to go ahead and make an 8th Style.

58:21.086 --> 58:25.691
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you to all of you that helped make Konami Style a purchase to continue supporting the project.

58:26.452 --> 58:33.959
[SPEAKER_18]: Details will be on the 2DX website, official website, konamistyle.com, and in the Konami Style newsletter.

58:33.999 --> 58:34.880
[SPEAKER_18]: You just have to wait.

58:35.721 --> 58:35.921
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep

58:36.531 --> 58:40.073
[SPEAKER_18]: on helping them out and continuing the production of Beatmania 2DX sequels.

58:40.474 --> 58:44.356
[SPEAKER_18]: So it sounds like they might keep going, even after 8th style, if 8th style does well.

58:44.656 --> 58:47.798
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is, are we going to have to do any petitions this time?

58:47.818 --> 58:51.460
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to have to do any, you know... God, I hope not.

58:51.480 --> 58:52.081
[SPEAKER_18]: That was stupid.

58:52.401 --> 58:57.944
[SPEAKER_18]: You remember I went off on Konami style on this show previously for having to make us do all those stupid questionnaires and everything.

58:58.305 --> 58:59.846
[SPEAKER_18]: Either make the game, or don't.

59:01.987 --> 59:03.108
[SPEAKER_18]: Quit making us have to work.

59:03.248 --> 59:04.669
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the ones making money off it.

59:04.709 --> 59:05.269
[SPEAKER_08]: You do the work.

59:06.067 --> 59:07.508
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to fill out no damn petition.

59:08.769 --> 59:09.130
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez.

59:10.991 --> 59:11.251
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

59:11.431 --> 59:12.552
[SPEAKER_31]: The 7th style is pretty.

59:14.094 --> 59:16.255
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what's funny is I still never did buy 7th style.

59:16.275 --> 59:21.139
[SPEAKER_18]: I said I would buy 7th style, but because my controller kind of sucks, I haven't bothered with 7th style.

59:21.580 --> 59:23.481
[SPEAKER_18]: And now I'm like, I'm all about poppin' music now.

59:23.521 --> 59:25.383
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, I need to get a poppin' music arcade style.

59:27.625 --> 59:28.045
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

59:29.466 --> 59:30.087
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see what happens.

59:33.442 --> 59:36.285
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully 8th style does well too and then we'll see a 9th style in the future.

59:36.365 --> 59:38.627
[SPEAKER_18]: But let's take it one step at a time, boys and girls.

59:39.888 --> 59:43.651
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully we will see 8th style at the end of the year.

59:44.732 --> 59:48.856
[SPEAKER_10]: But nothing confirmed yet.

59:50.157 --> 59:51.738
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's see.

59:51.838 --> 59:52.899
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we want to do the cage match?

59:53.079 --> 59:54.621
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, let's go to a break.

59:55.061 --> 59:58.424
[SPEAKER_18]: Because there's still more news stories I want to talk about before we come back.

01:00:00.461 --> 01:00:05.042
[SPEAKER_18]: In this break, I guess since we heard about 8Style, we'll play something from 2DX8Style.

01:00:07.762 --> 01:00:08.622
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll play this song.

01:00:08.702 --> 01:00:09.383
[SPEAKER_18]: I like this one.

01:00:09.463 --> 01:00:12.703
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we had a request for some poppin' music, so we'll work that in there too.

01:00:13.463 --> 01:00:14.664
[SPEAKER_18]: Some random poppin' music song.

01:00:15.164 --> 01:00:19.564
[SPEAKER_18]: And when we come back, some more news and all your favorite stuff.

01:00:19.704 --> 01:00:25.885
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio, Cage Match on the way, FU's on the way, and more exciting news.

01:00:26.226 --> 01:00:26.426
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

01:00:27.946 --> 01:00:28.406
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Jamie, yes.

01:00:28.426 --> 01:00:28.586
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:30.253
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes!

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:31.003
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we'll be back.

01:02:16.308 --> 01:02:17.450
Thanks for watching!

01:02:33.698 --> 01:02:47.261
[SPEAKER_22]: Kamaba Chikyuu Yo Midatsu Fune Wa Uchuru Sentai Yamato Uchuu no Kanatai Kandaru Unmei Seoi Ima Tobikaze Kananatsu Tokoe

01:03:00.552 --> 01:03:03.533
Thank you for watching.

01:03:03.553 --> 01:03:04.574
See you next time.

01:03:28.195 --> 01:03:29.476
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

01:03:53.332 --> 01:03:55.653
[SPEAKER_22]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:04:36.218 --> 01:04:37.879
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:05:34.793 --> 01:05:36.374
Thank you for watching.

01:05:36.414 --> 01:05:37.514
See you next time.

01:06:19.067 --> 01:06:22.448
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio and I just spilled Propel all over.

01:06:22.548 --> 01:06:25.549
[SPEAKER_18]: Now the cords tangle in my chair and everything is breaking.

01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:26.109
[SPEAKER_31]: Poor Rob.

01:06:26.229 --> 01:06:28.169
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I'll take this moment to answer John Field then.

01:06:28.669 --> 01:06:29.130
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:36.311
[SPEAKER_31]: I want the song from End of Ava because I've been looking for it forever and my single was sort of stepped on by somebody.

01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.809
[SPEAKER_10]: Ouch.

01:06:41.534 --> 01:06:41.835
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:06:43.257 --> 01:06:54.271
[SPEAKER_18]: Since some of you guys didn't seem to know those songs in the break... Uh, the songs in that break, uh, from 2DX8style, Love is Orange...

01:06:55.014 --> 01:07:11.038
[SPEAKER_18]: by Orange Lounge, Yamato, Space Warship Yamato by Sosasaki from Poppin' Music 7, and then in Poppin' Music 7 as well, we played a song by a group called Komotomoke, the genre is lonely, and the song, Artemis.

01:07:11.978 --> 01:07:18.500
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know a lot of you guys may not be as familiar with the Poppin' Music songs, so we'll play a few more for you guys tonight, just because we can.

01:07:20.146 --> 01:07:20.526
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, you are back.

01:07:20.546 --> 01:07:23.868
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe you can pick up that soundtrack they have, though, of the Anamelo 1 and 2.

01:07:24.628 --> 01:07:24.908
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah?

01:07:25.788 --> 01:07:26.869
[SPEAKER_31]: I came really close to it.

01:07:26.889 --> 01:07:27.549
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really awesome.

01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:29.390
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.950
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:07:31.951 --> 01:07:34.432
[SPEAKER_18]: We were talking about some Mamani news before we went to the break.

01:07:34.452 --> 01:07:36.833
[SPEAKER_18]: We were talking about the girl who had the heart attack playing DDR.

01:07:36.873 --> 01:07:39.294
[SPEAKER_18]: Even though that was, well, she wasn't really a heart attack, whatever it was.

01:07:40.594 --> 01:07:41.414
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a couple weeks ago.

01:07:41.454 --> 01:07:44.195
[SPEAKER_18]: But as you may or may not know, we've been off the air for about three weeks.

01:07:45.696 --> 01:07:47.917
[SPEAKER_18]: Because of problems out of our control, but we're back.

01:07:48.848 --> 01:07:53.811
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, real shows go off the air for like two months and you still watch them.

01:07:54.932 --> 01:07:58.094
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I don't think a two week break is too much to ask, people.

01:07:59.655 --> 01:08:04.298
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I thought this was interesting and I know Loki wants to talk about this.

01:08:04.338 --> 01:08:06.580
[SPEAKER_18]: You found something interesting on eBay this week, didn't you?

01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:09.742
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we have.

01:08:10.422 --> 01:08:12.063
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just been hitting the streets now.

01:08:13.319 --> 01:08:23.964
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently the same people behind the wonderful bootleg DDR Megamix are back at it again with... For those who don't know what DDR Megamix is... My bad!

01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:25.665
[SPEAKER_14]: God!

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:28.007
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just thinking I forget these things.

01:08:28.527 --> 01:08:38.572
[SPEAKER_14]: Now DDR Megamix is this really shitty bootleg that came out that basically was supposed to have the songs from 4th, 5th, and Extreme all in one cabinet, which would be pretty cool.

01:08:39.184 --> 01:08:49.032
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, all it was was DDR Extreme with really shitty graphics and glitched out shit and the wonderful warning screen don't fall off with two giant Star Wars AT-STs on there.

01:08:49.532 --> 01:08:51.874
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, that was really lame.

01:08:51.974 --> 01:09:00.741
[SPEAKER_14]: So this new one now has come out and is being distributed by some guy on the internet and it's also the same guy that is behind Megamix, as I said before.

01:09:01.342 --> 01:09:04.264
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, what's new about this is, one, there's actual graphics.

01:09:04.324 --> 01:09:06.646
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not, like, fucked up graphics as before.

01:09:07.428 --> 01:09:10.770
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actual new graphics, which is stupid, who cares?

01:09:11.851 --> 01:09:17.694
[SPEAKER_14]: And the ability to speed up the tempo of a song up to 20%, which is pretty lame.

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:21.876
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus.

01:09:23.597 --> 01:09:26.539
[SPEAKER_14]: With, yeah, just really shitty stuff.

01:09:26.699 --> 01:09:27.379
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're selling it for $650.

01:09:27.799 --> 01:09:31.021
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's the link in the chatroom.

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:33.889
[SPEAKER_18]: I love this ad.

01:09:34.150 --> 01:09:35.710
[SPEAKER_18]: I just posted the link in the chat room there.

01:09:36.511 --> 01:09:40.973
[SPEAKER_18]: It has this running theme going through the game, and that is like torso shots.

01:09:41.913 --> 01:09:42.373
[SPEAKER_18]: And look at this.

01:09:42.413 --> 01:09:47.576
[SPEAKER_18]: The logo, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus, is just the shot of a boob, basically.

01:09:47.596 --> 01:09:49.577
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the logo.

01:09:49.617 --> 01:09:50.057
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that.

01:09:50.557 --> 01:09:51.398
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a boob.

01:09:52.138 --> 01:09:52.979
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the marquee.

01:09:53.039 --> 01:09:53.639
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a boob.

01:09:55.569 --> 01:09:58.310
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, um, oh, sorry, it's a breast.

01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:00.711
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a breast.

01:10:01.411 --> 01:10:06.393
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you have that same breast for light mode, and then there's beginner mode, which has a man breast.

01:10:06.733 --> 01:10:08.274
[SPEAKER_18]: Very nice man breast, I must say.

01:10:09.074 --> 01:10:11.275
[SPEAKER_18]: And then on heavy mode, I don't know what the fuck that is.

01:10:11.295 --> 01:10:14.296
[SPEAKER_18]: Then you have, like, a god, like Trinity from the Matrix.

01:10:16.697 --> 01:10:17.617
[SPEAKER_29]: It's the hermaphrodite.

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:24.180
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, let me read this ad for you guys, because it's hilarious.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:24.280
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:49.456
[SPEAKER_18]: I will read this in my announcer voice here Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus is available now This is the latest upgrade for the DDR All new graphics with an incredible speed upgrade We asked the players what they wanted and they said Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up So we did Earnings results up by 40% Is that what everybody was saying?

01:10:49.556 --> 01:10:51.157
[SPEAKER_18]: Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up?

01:10:51.537 --> 01:10:53.419
[SPEAKER_31]: I think they were saying get rid of it faster

01:10:54.096 --> 01:10:58.937
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think they were saying, give us new songs, give us new mix, new mix, new mix.

01:11:00.698 --> 01:11:02.798
[SPEAKER_18]: Not crappy bootlegs, crappy bootlegs.

01:11:05.579 --> 01:11:10.560
[SPEAKER_18]: I love this, how you can bring up the screen and then you can speed up the song by 20%.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.701
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a little problem, though, with it.

01:11:13.741 --> 01:11:16.021
[SPEAKER_14]: A few things that just didn't quite work out.

01:11:16.802 --> 01:11:19.242
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, there is no heavy mode.

01:11:19.702 --> 01:11:22.403
[SPEAKER_14]: There's beginner, light, standard.

01:11:23.294 --> 01:11:26.316
[SPEAKER_14]: Heavy is only selectable on, you know, the song select screen.

01:11:26.897 --> 01:11:27.417
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two.

01:11:27.437 --> 01:11:31.720
[SPEAKER_14]: If you speed up the song save by 20%, okay, you're done with your game.

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:32.500
[SPEAKER_14]: Guess what?

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.582
[SPEAKER_14]: If the person doesn't set it back down to normal, they're still on 20%.

01:11:37.324 --> 01:11:38.424
[SPEAKER_14]: It just stays that way.

01:11:38.825 --> 01:11:40.005
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really stupid.

01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:41.707
[SPEAKER_30]: That should make Max 300 really fun.

01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:47.951
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, actually, there's an arcade already in Australia that has this, and they said...

01:11:48.399 --> 01:11:49.600
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's not that bad.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.780
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually kind of fun to play the sped up songs.

01:11:52.121 --> 01:11:53.641
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just a novelty, I think.

01:11:54.181 --> 01:12:04.926
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if they... See, what I thought when I first heard about DDR Extreme Plus, I thought it was, oh, someone's selling the hacked version of DDR Extreme with the extra modifiers on it.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:06.606
[SPEAKER_14]: See, now that's what I would have done.

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:10.388
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to hack it like this, you know, put those extra modifiers on there as well.

01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:14.489
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, I'm going to simulate for you guys what this would sound like, okay?

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.270
[SPEAKER_18]: So here's a fast song already, alright?

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:17.011
[SPEAKER_18]: Waka Laka.

01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:18.131
[SPEAKER_18]: Oops.

01:12:18.516 --> 01:12:19.797
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, let me play this for you guys.

01:12:22.099 --> 01:12:26.422
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, now let's see what it sounds like if we were to up the speed by 20%.

01:12:26.562 --> 01:12:28.903
[SPEAKER_18]: Now you know how hard this song is already, right?

01:12:28.923 --> 01:12:29.864
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, here we go.

01:12:42.513 --> 01:12:44.054
[SPEAKER_18]: I would die trying to play this.

01:12:44.714 --> 01:12:46.756
[SPEAKER_18]: This would give me a heart failure, okay?

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:51.121
[SPEAKER_08]: They would have to get the defibrillators out for me on this crap.

01:12:55.623 --> 01:12:57.103
[SPEAKER_30]: It made the song sound a little better, though.

01:12:58.684 --> 01:12:59.164
[SPEAKER_14]: See you now.

01:13:00.305 --> 01:13:00.625
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:13:03.026 --> 01:13:03.906
[SPEAKER_14]: This is really stupid.

01:13:04.567 --> 01:13:09.129
[SPEAKER_14]: Arcade owners are actually... The people that bought Megamix are ready to snatch this up for another $650.

01:13:10.329 --> 01:13:12.210
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's how much Megamix was.

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:16.672
[SPEAKER_14]: $650 to get a really shitty version of DDR Extreme with crap graphics.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:21.753
[SPEAKER_14]: Arcade owners actually paid this, so there's obviously money in this.

01:13:22.033 --> 01:13:25.516
[SPEAKER_14]: And, now, this is distributed through a company called Dakota Games.

01:13:25.976 --> 01:13:37.223
[SPEAKER_14]: Dakota Games is also known for another hack that's Daytona CRX, which is basically Daytona with Super Off-Road added to it.

01:13:37.283 --> 01:13:45.389
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it's the ability, which is kind of cool, it's the ability to save profiles and you upgrade car parts and stuff to make your cars have

01:13:45.851 --> 01:13:48.172
[SPEAKER_14]: More speed, more traction, etc.

01:13:48.472 --> 01:13:49.552
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, that's a cool feature.

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:51.193
[SPEAKER_14]: It adds, you know, stuff to the game.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:55.754
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this, while it being a really shitty hack, it does add features to it.

01:13:55.914 --> 01:14:03.497
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it's a really... I wouldn't go spend $650 on it, but hey, whatever.

01:14:03.637 --> 01:14:07.579
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, at least it's not like Megamix, but it is still crap.

01:14:08.999 --> 01:14:10.039
[SPEAKER_14]: It's getting better, though.

01:14:10.439 --> 01:14:11.480
[SPEAKER_14]: They're starting to learn.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.661
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually did something I didn't think, you know, of, so...

01:14:15.948 --> 01:14:16.969
[SPEAKER_14]: More power to them, I guess.

01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:25.032
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what to think about this whole, like, we're going to do the tempo change and change the game here.

01:14:25.052 --> 01:14:28.854
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would have been cool if they had to slow it down by 20% mode.

01:14:29.114 --> 01:14:30.094
[SPEAKER_18]: That would have been cool.

01:14:31.715 --> 01:14:35.096
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, now I've got to try it again to see what slowed down 20% would sound like.

01:14:37.057 --> 01:14:37.538
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I do.

01:14:39.178 --> 01:14:39.919
[SPEAKER_18]: You know you want to hear it.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:42.960
[SPEAKER_18]: Ugh.

01:14:43.615 --> 01:14:44.556
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, what do you think of this?

01:14:44.576 --> 01:14:48.900
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you ever play this game, or is this just utter crap to you, or what?

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.602
[SPEAKER_31]: I have two words for this.

01:14:51.963 --> 01:14:53.425
[SPEAKER_31]: Hell no.

01:14:54.306 --> 01:14:54.766
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not?

01:14:55.126 --> 01:14:56.568
[SPEAKER_31]: Because it's just stupid.

01:14:56.648 --> 01:15:02.594
[SPEAKER_31]: If I want to play DDR, I would go play, like, you know, Max 2 or Extreme.

01:15:02.834 --> 01:15:06.498
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to add that, you know that arcade chain Tilt that's in...

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:08.190
[SPEAKER_14]: Waka Laka Slow Down

01:15:32.264 --> 01:15:33.045
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can get it to play.

01:15:33.545 --> 01:15:33.925
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

01:15:35.126 --> 01:15:36.607
[SPEAKER_18]: Now let's see what it'll be down 20%.

01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:43.852
[SPEAKER_27]: Now I can beat it.

01:15:44.312 --> 01:15:47.654
[SPEAKER_27]: Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

01:15:47.694 --> 01:15:49.656
[SPEAKER_18]: This is like training mode, kind of.

01:15:53.338 --> 01:15:54.639
[SPEAKER_18]: I can almost stand this song now.

01:16:04.364 --> 01:16:05.465
[SPEAKER_14]: Jenny, Ranma, and the Demon.

01:16:05.845 --> 01:16:11.110
[SPEAKER_18]: See, we knew there was something to that Devil Devil Revolution thing going on.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:17.136
[SPEAKER_18]: Chatroom is letting you know that somebody who says they worked for Tilt said they did not upgrade all the machines.

01:16:17.836 --> 01:16:19.278
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that still doesn't matter.

01:16:19.318 --> 01:16:20.699
[SPEAKER_13]: You upgraded some of them.

01:16:20.719 --> 01:16:21.820
[SPEAKER_13]: That still makes you stupid.

01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:27.345
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so glad that... It's like, I didn't inject all the heroin.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.261
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Jamie?

01:16:31.741 --> 01:16:35.683
[SPEAKER_31]: The tilt in my town of birth was bought out by Namco, thank God.

01:16:36.983 --> 01:16:38.084
[SPEAKER_31]: So it doesn't suck.

01:16:42.786 --> 01:16:46.027
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some other news we want to share with you guys, unless anybody else has anything to say on Megamix.

01:16:47.328 --> 01:16:48.428
[SPEAKER_31]: Can I burp?

01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.909
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

01:16:51.491 --> 01:16:51.931
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:53.092
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't have to now.

01:17:17.045 --> 01:17:22.510
[SPEAKER_18]: That should be a very good read, so check DDRspot.com the next couple days and wait for that.

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:28.916
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, he's looking for, they scored an interview, DDRspot also scored an interview with Naoki.

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.100
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going to be doing an interview with Naoki in the next few days.

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:40.782
[SPEAKER_18]: They are still looking to field questions, so Mel has said his email box is open to you guys if you want to send him some questions.

01:17:41.542 --> 01:17:49.384
[SPEAKER_18]: I know this is ironic because the interview is for DDR Spot, but if you want to send Mel an email, if you have a question for Naoki, Mel will consider all your questions.

01:17:49.404 --> 01:17:55.065
[SPEAKER_18]: He won't ask everything, because if everybody sends a question, that interview is going to be an hour long, but he'll consider all your stuff.

01:17:55.745 --> 01:17:59.826
[SPEAKER_18]: Mel at DDRFreak.com is his email.

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:05.614
[SPEAKER_18]: So, just send that along if you have a question you would like to ask Naoki.

01:18:06.174 --> 01:18:08.736
[SPEAKER_18]: Such as, you want some fashion tips?

01:18:10.618 --> 01:18:11.298
[SPEAKER_30]: Who does his hair?

01:18:11.718 --> 01:18:13.159
[SPEAKER_18]: Naoki eye for the straight guy.

01:18:14.641 --> 01:18:16.222
[SPEAKER_18]: How deep in the punani are you?

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:18.403
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

01:18:23.307 --> 01:18:25.809
[SPEAKER_18]: See, the questions I want to ask, Mel isn't going to ask.

01:18:25.829 --> 01:18:25.909
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.483
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know if he ever really has boinked, Paula Terry, or if it's a purely professional relationship.

01:18:37.066 --> 01:18:38.207
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love to have Nokia.

01:18:38.307 --> 01:18:42.390
[SPEAKER_18]: I would give a lot of head to get any Bomani celebrity on this show.

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:44.871
[SPEAKER_18]: Because then that means we've made it.

01:18:47.353 --> 01:18:48.034
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good idea.

01:18:48.394 --> 01:18:53.117
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we were supposed to have an interview with Jason Enos from Konami, but...

01:18:54.034 --> 01:18:57.457
[SPEAKER_18]: In typical Orange Lounge fashion, that all got fucked up.

01:18:57.597 --> 01:19:00.680
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, and I missed my chance to go hang out with the man, thank you.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:09.307
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is too bad, because it was a... Honestly, guys, I hate to say this, it was a great interview, because Loki fucking asked... I can't believe you had the balls to do this.

01:19:09.647 --> 01:19:12.749
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki fucking asked him about Into the Groove, okay?

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:14.411
[SPEAKER_31]: He had a very good answer.

01:19:14.451 --> 01:19:16.913
[SPEAKER_18]: He had a very good answer, and I wish I could remember it.

01:19:17.293 --> 01:19:21.216
[SPEAKER_31]: It was easy to encourage the community to keep growing.

01:19:21.997 --> 01:19:23.458
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, something like that.

01:19:25.441 --> 01:19:26.081
[SPEAKER_18]: It was something like that.

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:31.224
[SPEAKER_18]: He basically was welcoming the challenge, basically.

01:19:31.905 --> 01:19:33.566
[SPEAKER_18]: Which I thought was very professional.

01:19:34.046 --> 01:19:34.646
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a good guy.

01:19:34.806 --> 01:19:36.768
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sad about what happened to the interview.

01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:42.551
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, what he told us off-air was hilarious.

01:19:42.591 --> 01:19:43.051
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:19:44.352 --> 01:19:49.295
[SPEAKER_18]: We thank him for taking the time to do the interview with us, even though it never aired, because mistakes happen.

01:19:51.516 --> 01:19:52.957
[SPEAKER_18]: Bad mistakes happen.

01:19:55.478 --> 01:19:56.778
[SPEAKER_14]: We could have brought back Portal.

01:19:57.739 --> 01:19:59.159
[SPEAKER_18]: That's very true.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.260
[SPEAKER_18]: We could have merged with G4, okay?

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.321
[SPEAKER_18]: That could have been what happened.

01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:06.241
Yeah, I wouldn't mind that.

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:07.782
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true.

01:20:08.482 --> 01:20:11.863
[SPEAKER_31]: I wouldn't mind Taka and Taku naked in the same room.

01:20:13.244 --> 01:20:13.544
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:20:14.504 --> 01:20:16.765
[SPEAKER_31]: In response to Jason in the chatroom.

01:20:17.005 --> 01:20:20.766
[SPEAKER_18]: While Jamie lives out her fantasy over there, perhaps... I'm not living out any fantasy!

01:20:23.993 --> 01:20:25.214
[SPEAKER_18]: You have another news story you want to talk about?

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:28.216
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, stuff unrelated with... Okay, fine, Loki.

01:20:29.096 --> 01:20:37.082
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm not quite on, you know, the pulse of all the new music games that come out, this one kind of slipped under my radar.

01:20:37.902 --> 01:20:40.764
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a game called I Can Boogie.

01:20:42.105 --> 01:20:42.465
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

01:20:43.706 --> 01:20:45.007
[SPEAKER_18]: Say that one more time, Loki.

01:20:46.069 --> 01:20:47.450
[SPEAKER_14]: You're an ass, okay?

01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:49.311
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called I Can Boogie, okay?

01:20:49.432 --> 01:20:55.996
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically, if you were to take iToy Groove, put it in an arcade cabinet that looks something like Pump It Up, that's what you've got.

01:20:56.897 --> 01:20:58.098
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks pretty cool.

01:20:58.178 --> 01:21:05.443
[SPEAKER_14]: We just got it down at one of our arcades in the Century 14 in Roseville, down near Sacramento.

01:21:05.644 --> 01:21:06.684
[SPEAKER_14]: We got one of these things.

01:21:06.884 --> 01:21:09.566
[SPEAKER_14]: I have yet to play it, but it sounds really cool.

01:21:09.586 --> 01:21:11.188
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks kind of neat.

01:21:11.428 --> 01:21:15.551
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got actual music from artists, no covers or anything, hot stuff.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.100
[SPEAKER_14]: from Donna Summers.

01:21:17.881 --> 01:21:26.424
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got, was it, something like Jan Jackson on there and some other stuff.

01:21:26.724 --> 01:21:27.584
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty good, though.

01:21:29.185 --> 01:21:33.887
[SPEAKER_14]: It just looks interesting because it uses a camera just like, you know, iToy Groove.

01:21:35.047 --> 01:21:38.989
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if you've got one of these by you, because I also heard there's one at Dave & Buster's in Milpitas.

01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:40.629
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've got one by you, you should check it out.

01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:45.011
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, that was all I had.

01:21:45.805 --> 01:21:53.670
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can find that at, I believe, iKinGroove.com But you actually haven't gotten a chance to play this yet.

01:21:54.251 --> 01:21:54.831
No, not yet.

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:55.411
[SPEAKER_18]: Not yet.

01:21:59.694 --> 01:22:00.034
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:22:02.336 --> 01:22:04.497
[SPEAKER_18]: So they basically turned iToy Groove into an arcade game.

01:22:04.537 --> 01:22:06.679
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody stole that idea and turned it into an arcade game.

01:22:07.439 --> 01:22:07.519
Yeah.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:08.440
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.222
[SPEAKER_18]: iToy Groove... I wasn't that thrilled with iToy Groove.

01:22:11.262 --> 01:22:13.263
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, it was cool for a day, and then that was it.

01:22:13.823 --> 01:22:14.444
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I don't know...

01:22:15.816 --> 01:22:22.719
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why that game just didn't do it for me, but the thing is with this arcade game, it's like a cross between Itoy Groove and Parapara.

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:24.700
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much what it is.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:32.884
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's, I think, there's five points, like five sensors, spots that you have to hit, you know, depending on how the arrows come.

01:22:34.085 --> 01:22:36.186
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've got, you know, pretty interesting stuff.

01:22:36.646 --> 01:22:36.746
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

01:22:38.024 --> 01:23:00.134
[SPEAKER_14]: on there, um, that was, oh, that was the other thing, since someone mentioned DDR Karaoke Mix, there was actually one of those very, very, very rare arcade games being sold on Yahoo Auctions for $1,600 at Karaoke Revolution 2nd Mix, or not Karaoke Revolution, um, DDR Karaoke Mix 2nd Mix, which I thought that was pretty sweet.

01:23:00.834 --> 01:23:05.336
[SPEAKER_14]: If I had that kind of, you know, cash, I would buy one, but I don't, so...

01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:09.947
[SPEAKER_31]: My second mix substream.

01:23:11.688 --> 01:23:12.028
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh yeah.

01:23:12.209 --> 01:23:13.489
[SPEAKER_18]: You have the 2DX machine too?

01:23:13.769 --> 01:23:14.490
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what I want.

01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:15.390
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:19.933
[SPEAKER_18]: You have the only one in the US, I think.

01:23:20.534 --> 01:23:32.821
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, we said right off the bat when we buy our house we're getting a DDR machine and I'm thinking of trying to get that in the... I want to get an actual second style build substream machine.

01:23:33.516 --> 01:23:35.477
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, the old style monitor and everything.

01:23:36.438 --> 01:23:36.698
[SPEAKER_31]: I know.

01:23:37.578 --> 01:23:37.918
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:23:37.998 --> 01:23:41.200
[SPEAKER_31]: But if I can, I doubt it would be that expensive for that particular machine.

01:23:43.501 --> 01:23:44.142
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, good luck to you.

01:23:45.502 --> 01:23:47.183
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, you guys want to have yourselves a cage match?

01:23:47.203 --> 01:23:49.064
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't had one of these in a while, it feels like.

01:23:49.264 --> 01:23:49.904
[SPEAKER_06]: We sure haven't.

01:23:50.045 --> 01:23:52.966
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, there's going to be kind of a small twist in tonight's cage match.

01:23:55.434 --> 01:24:05.703
[SPEAKER_18]: The twist in tonight's cage match is that we are cleaning the slate and we're not going to carry a winner over from the show three weeks ago because basically it's won for like three weeks now by default.

01:24:06.023 --> 01:24:11.488
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are wiping the slate clean and we're starting off with three brand new songs tonight in tonight's cage match.

01:24:11.908 --> 01:24:16.652
[SPEAKER_18]: So the way the cage match works, each host brings one song to the table.

01:24:17.762 --> 01:24:35.298
[SPEAKER_18]: and we're going to play these songs and then you're going to vote on your favorite in the chat room and your song that you pick as your favorite will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program with all your favorite DDR, 2DX and Dance Mania favorites that'll include the cage match winner from tonight

01:24:35.917 --> 01:24:37.118
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we'll go into rotation.

01:24:37.438 --> 01:24:40.641
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it'll come back next week to compete again against two challengers.

01:24:41.101 --> 01:24:44.724
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we get a clean slate tonight, so that means we're gonna hear three new songs in full.

01:24:45.224 --> 01:24:56.853
[SPEAKER_18]: Cage Match kinda used to have this theme of songs that would be good for Bomani, like DDR, 2DX, but now it's kind of evolved into cool stuff, but looking at tonight's lineup, I'd say we're kinda going back to our roots here.

01:24:56.913 --> 01:25:00.815
[SPEAKER_18]: All three of these songs look to be songs that'll be made for Bomani.

01:25:01.236 --> 01:25:03.057
[SPEAKER_18]: So this should be a fun Cage Match tonight.

01:25:03.297 --> 01:25:03.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Not mine.

01:25:05.288 --> 01:25:06.529
[SPEAKER_18]: So make sure you are in.

01:25:06.549 --> 01:25:09.511
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'm just looking at your artists and knowing their music.

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:10.772
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

01:25:12.414 --> 01:25:14.255
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to vote, remember you have to be in our chat room.

01:25:14.355 --> 01:25:15.436
[SPEAKER_18]: Orangeloungeradio.com.

01:25:15.456 --> 01:25:17.417
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on chat and then you'll be able to place a vote.

01:25:17.778 --> 01:25:18.338
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we go.

01:25:18.999 --> 01:25:25.964
[SPEAKER_18]: First up tonight is Loki and he's actually the one who won three weeks ago but we couldn't even remember what song it was so we're giving him a new song tonight.

01:25:26.314 --> 01:25:28.075
[SPEAKER_18]: What song are you putting in the cage match tonight?

01:25:28.995 --> 01:25:37.879
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I've put this artist in a few times now, and since they have a new song that's going to be in DDR Extreme, I thought, hey, let's take a song from another game, Need for Speed Underground.

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:43.541
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is also featured in Tourney Mix 5, if anyone really gives a damn about that.

01:25:43.821 --> 01:25:52.164
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is BT featuring Wild Side with... I think it was Wild Side or Wild Style.

01:25:52.885 --> 01:25:53.405
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, something...

01:25:54.468 --> 01:26:00.651
[SPEAKER_18]: Wild Side is the Irresistible Mom band from Xtreme, so I don't think it's that.

01:26:01.571 --> 01:26:02.912
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be Wild Style, I think.

01:26:03.032 --> 01:26:07.533
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, it's BT featuring Wild Style, and this is Kimo Sabe.

01:26:07.553 --> 01:26:09.774
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here it is.

01:26:09.874 --> 01:26:11.375
[SPEAKER_30]: That was in Frequency.

01:26:12.315 --> 01:26:12.996
[SPEAKER_13]: What's in Frequency?

01:26:13.716 --> 01:26:14.376
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, okay.

01:26:14.856 --> 01:26:16.837
[SPEAKER_31]: Is it in Frequency or Amplitude, too?

01:26:16.977 --> 01:26:18.038
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, here it is.

01:26:18.158 --> 01:26:18.558
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy it.

01:26:18.738 --> 01:26:20.739
[SPEAKER_18]: BT, Kimo Sabe, song number one.

01:28:11.303 --> 01:28:11.717
Full Effect

01:28:53.706 --> 01:28:55.924
I bust positive vibes from the west to Maui

01:29:29.588 --> 01:29:31.253
Pull it back Pull it back

01:30:32.741 --> 01:30:33.384
Thanks for watching!

01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:10.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch out for my man B.T.

01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.870
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:10.890 --> 01:31:11.290
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.410
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.510
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:11.910
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:12.090
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:12.251 --> 01:31:12.311
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:12.331 --> 01:31:12.471
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:12.491 --> 01:31:12.691
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:12.731 --> 01:31:12.851
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:13.031
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:13.091
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

01:31:40.964 --> 01:31:42.105
[SPEAKER_30]: I've heard that song a whole lot.

01:31:44.307 --> 01:31:45.407
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Loki.

01:31:46.488 --> 01:31:49.190
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my favorite song in Tourney Mix 5, so it gets a 10.

01:31:50.291 --> 01:31:50.772
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

01:31:52.093 --> 01:31:55.055
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, to be honest, BT just doesn't do it for me.

01:31:55.175 --> 01:32:00.619
[SPEAKER_18]: Like a lot of other artists in his genre do, and especially that song just doesn't do it for me.

01:32:00.719 --> 01:32:02.521
[SPEAKER_18]: So I give it like a, it's okay.

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:04.802
[SPEAKER_18]: So I give it like an okay score of like 6.5.

01:32:04.942 --> 01:32:08.165
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, it just doesn't do it for me.

01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:11.511
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, it's not gay enough, I think that's what it is.

01:32:11.871 --> 01:32:14.192
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how you got that confused.

01:32:14.852 --> 01:32:16.753
[SPEAKER_18]: When I heard Wild Side, I got excited.

01:32:17.233 --> 01:32:18.674
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, it was Wild Child.

01:32:19.094 --> 01:32:20.374
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on.

01:32:21.034 --> 01:32:23.876
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us from Jamie.

01:32:24.236 --> 01:32:28.037
[SPEAKER_18]: And I gotta say, I'm a little bit surprised at her pick, but let's see what's up.

01:32:28.217 --> 01:32:30.398
[SPEAKER_31]: My song has the power of porn behind it.

01:32:31.411 --> 01:32:33.792
[SPEAKER_31]: It's Tracy Lord, let's say something.

01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:35.513
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, this is the thing.

01:32:35.713 --> 01:32:40.936
[SPEAKER_31]: I went on a big downloading spree trying to find this one Tracy Lord song.

01:32:42.137 --> 01:32:43.998
[SPEAKER_31]: And if anyone knows what this is, please tell me.

01:32:44.178 --> 01:32:45.899
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm in the chat room right now, 7 p.m.

01:32:46.339 --> 01:32:48.940
[SPEAKER_31]: It's one about this woman getting revenge on a cowboy.

01:32:51.142 --> 01:32:53.603
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not Fallen Angel?

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:54.704
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not Fallen Angel.

01:32:55.464 --> 01:32:59.026
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a remix of a Tracy Lord song done by Paula Confold.

01:32:59.912 --> 01:33:00.572
[SPEAKER_31]: Dude, I want that.

01:33:00.592 --> 01:33:05.255
[SPEAKER_31]: Good for you!

01:33:05.295 --> 01:33:09.117
[SPEAKER_31]: But it... I heard the song, like, when I was in college the first time.

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:09.917
[SPEAKER_31]: That was, like, in 95.

01:33:10.057 --> 01:33:15.520
[SPEAKER_31]: And the CD was about a year old then, so if that helps anybody, find the song for me.

01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:21.123
[SPEAKER_31]: But anyway, this particular one, this one is, like, it definitely has the power of porn behind it.

01:33:21.383 --> 01:33:26.966
[SPEAKER_31]: Because this is, like, a song that someone would participate in nocturnal activities to.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.680
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my, nocturnal activities.

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:33.941
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's hear it then.

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:38.483
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Tracy Lord's Say Something.

01:33:38.964 --> 01:33:39.284
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

01:33:57.795 --> 01:33:58.036
Thank you.

01:34:55.373 --> 01:34:57.475
How did you know I am lonely?

01:34:57.495 --> 01:35:00.458
Dear mama, say something How did you know I am lonely?

01:35:00.478 --> 01:35:02.679
Dear mama, say something How did you know I am lonely?

01:35:30.299 --> 01:35:31.744
Thanks for watching!

01:36:24.505 --> 01:36:26.827
How did you know I am only here a moment?

01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:29.649
Say something How did you know I am only here a moment?

01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.769
Say

01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:54.411
Thanks for watching!

01:37:51.874 --> 01:37:53.175
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two was right there.

01:37:53.215 --> 01:37:55.236
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Tracy Lords with Say Something.

01:37:55.657 --> 01:37:56.937
[SPEAKER_18]: Say something about that song, Jamie.

01:37:59.039 --> 01:37:59.839
[SPEAKER_31]: I like that song.

01:37:59.859 --> 01:38:03.322
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to give it an eight.

01:38:03.702 --> 01:38:04.562
[SPEAKER_31]: She's done better.

01:38:05.203 --> 01:38:06.524
[SPEAKER_31]: Apparently she sucks live.

01:38:08.085 --> 01:38:08.945
[SPEAKER_18]: Imagine that.

01:38:09.345 --> 01:38:13.668
[SPEAKER_18]: Porn star given music career who can't really sing without a studio.

01:38:13.989 --> 01:38:17.931
[SPEAKER_31]: Dan said that he went to some show that was going on that had like Moby and a bunch of people.

01:38:17.951 --> 01:38:19.012
[SPEAKER_31]: This was a few years ago.

01:38:20.273 --> 01:38:25.435
[SPEAKER_31]: He said that Moby got naked and tried scratching wood.

01:38:25.535 --> 01:38:27.716
[SPEAKER_31]: But he said that she wasn't very good live.

01:38:27.756 --> 01:38:29.116
[SPEAKER_31]: But I don't know, the song was okay.

01:38:29.176 --> 01:38:30.357
[SPEAKER_31]: It sort of reminds me of Slow.

01:38:31.818 --> 01:38:32.598
[SPEAKER_31]: So I give it an 8.

01:38:34.419 --> 01:38:34.759
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

01:38:36.479 --> 01:38:38.560
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, did Loki go second or did I go second?

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.040
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:40.221
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki went second, I think.

01:38:41.601 --> 01:38:43.682
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I could see fucking to that.

01:38:46.083 --> 01:38:48.204
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give it an 8, because...

01:38:49.008 --> 01:38:49.989
[SPEAKER_14]: Tracy Lords is cool.

01:38:50.269 --> 01:38:51.010
[SPEAKER_14]: She did Control.

01:38:53.532 --> 01:38:55.974
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, yeah, that's definitely a song to fuck to.

01:38:56.574 --> 01:39:02.399
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I don't know if I could imagine it on our station regularly, but, um, it's unique.

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.541
[SPEAKER_18]: And it did get me a little horny.

01:39:04.681 --> 01:39:05.202
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a little bit.

01:39:05.962 --> 01:39:06.763
[SPEAKER_18]: Just kidding, just kidding.

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.242
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't get the slow comparison though.

01:39:10.262 --> 01:39:13.906
[SPEAKER_29]: They're both slow songs, but Kylie's way...

01:39:32.093 --> 01:39:33.554
[SPEAKER_18]: Your votes count though, not ours.

01:39:33.594 --> 01:39:36.656
[SPEAKER_18]: There is one more song you get to vote for, possibly, if you want to.

01:39:37.096 --> 01:39:38.417
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's My Pick.

01:39:39.258 --> 01:39:45.742
[SPEAKER_18]: My Pick is an artist that you've actually already heard on our station because she was on a Dance Mania album.

01:39:46.282 --> 01:39:48.564
[SPEAKER_18]: And she used to be with a group, you might have heard of them.

01:39:48.984 --> 01:39:50.445
[SPEAKER_18]: You know the Spice Girls?

01:39:50.685 --> 01:39:51.766
[SPEAKER_18]: You ever heard of the Spice Girls?

01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:54.351
[SPEAKER_30]: I was laughing at the Sam magazine.

01:39:54.391 --> 01:39:56.013
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

01:39:57.254 --> 01:40:01.598
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Sporty Spice has a solo career, believe it or not, and she has some big dance hits.

01:40:02.278 --> 01:40:09.905
[SPEAKER_18]: I too, like Jamie, went on a downloading spree this week, and I was downloading all these British dance compilations, and this song turned up on one of them, and I kind of liked it.

01:40:10.466 --> 01:40:12.287
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to put it in tonight's cage match.

01:40:12.348 --> 01:40:17.912
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Melanie C, and the song is Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, and it's the Shanghai Surprise remix.

01:40:18.866 --> 01:40:21.588
[SPEAKER_18]: Wasn't that the movie with Madonna and Sean Penn from like years ago?

01:40:21.969 --> 01:40:22.889
[SPEAKER_18]: Shanghai Surprise?

01:40:24.311 --> 01:40:26.012
[SPEAKER_30]: That was supposed to be like this horrible movie.

01:40:26.212 --> 01:40:28.514
[SPEAKER_18]: I assure you this song is way better than the movie.

01:40:28.534 --> 01:40:29.435
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I think so.

01:40:30.876 --> 01:40:33.438
[SPEAKER_18]: The rest of you, I don't care what you think, but we'll see.

01:40:33.478 --> 01:40:34.219
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully you'll like it.

01:40:34.439 --> 01:40:36.541
[SPEAKER_29]: I found the page with the old guy again.

01:40:38.743 --> 01:40:41.645
[SPEAKER_18]: The listeners don't even know what you're doing over there.

01:40:41.665 --> 01:40:42.786
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, I'm not going to say anything.

01:40:42.826 --> 01:40:43.327
[SPEAKER_18]: You shouldn't.

01:40:43.427 --> 01:40:43.727
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:40:44.928 --> 01:40:45.769
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, here comes Loki.

01:40:47.062 --> 01:40:55.167
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on a mission Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you're with me, raise your hands Yeah, yeah, yeah, got no inhibitions, it's our decision

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:21.821
Easy girl, don't let go Be given to yourself tonight

01:42:11.317 --> 01:42:12.242
Thanks for watching!

01:43:22.677 --> 01:43:24.438
Thank you for watching!

01:43:58.562 --> 01:43:59.925
Thanks for watching!

01:44:51.944 --> 01:44:53.444
[SPEAKER_18]: All righty, song number three tonight.

01:44:53.564 --> 01:44:55.224
[SPEAKER_18]: Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

01:44:55.685 --> 01:44:56.445
[SPEAKER_18]: What'd you think?

01:44:56.545 --> 01:44:58.625
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah Yeah Yeah or Oh Hell No?

01:44:58.745 --> 01:44:59.026
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie?

01:44:59.186 --> 01:45:00.106
[SPEAKER_31]: It gets a yeah.

01:45:00.626 --> 01:45:03.567
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, it's good, don't get me wrong.

01:45:03.627 --> 01:45:04.887
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just kind of generic, you know.

01:45:05.447 --> 01:45:08.348
[SPEAKER_31]: So it gets a six, seven-ish.

01:45:09.188 --> 01:45:09.568
[SPEAKER_30]: Seven-ish.

01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:11.129
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven-ish from Jamie.

01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:11.469
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki?

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:19.923
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard this somewhere before, I don't know if it's another artist's song or what, but I don't like the Spice Girls.

01:45:20.263 --> 01:45:25.004
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like Melanin C. The only thing they're good in is nude pictures.

01:45:26.145 --> 01:45:30.146
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, yeah, I give it a yeah, yeah, yeah, five.

01:45:32.274 --> 01:45:38.940
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, to me that song, it's so British, and it's like a song I would hear at a soccer game, seriously.

01:45:39.901 --> 01:45:42.843
[SPEAKER_18]: And that so fits 45, I'm sorry, football.

01:45:43.384 --> 01:45:44.024
[SPEAKER_18]: Football!

01:45:44.044 --> 01:45:46.086
[SPEAKER_18]: Goal!

01:45:46.386 --> 01:45:48.368
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:45:48.388 --> 01:45:49.148
[SPEAKER_18]: So I could hear that.

01:45:49.929 --> 01:45:52.711
[SPEAKER_18]: So I give it like an 8, because I think that would be fun for DDR.

01:45:52.952 --> 01:45:55.273
[SPEAKER_18]: I might do a sim file to it if I get unlazy, ever.

01:45:55.834 --> 01:45:59.397
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's review the three songs before I open up the voting lines.

01:45:59.761 --> 01:46:04.245
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go, a review of the three songs you can vote for tonight, because it is up to you.

01:46:04.745 --> 01:46:08.348
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number one, BT featuring Wildchild, Kimo Sabe.

01:46:14.834 --> 01:46:18.317
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two tonight, Tracy Lords with Say Something.

01:46:19.058 --> 01:46:20.599
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you know I am lonely?

01:46:27.625 --> 01:46:30.823
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

01:46:39.586 --> 01:46:42.969
[SPEAKER_18]: All righty, place vote now.

01:46:43.129 --> 01:46:46.051
[SPEAKER_18]: To place your votes, just send Sky a message in the chatroom.

01:46:46.071 --> 01:46:48.493
[SPEAKER_18]: That's me, talking about myself in the third person again.

01:46:49.153 --> 01:46:51.335
[SPEAKER_18]: Send me a message in the chatroom with your vote.

01:46:51.795 --> 01:46:57.419
[SPEAKER_18]: Winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:01.502
[SPEAKER_18]: Meanwhile, back to some of the news we missed the three weeks we were out.

01:47:01.842 --> 01:47:06.506
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, another article that came out while we were gone was on the Fox News Channel.

01:47:07.674 --> 01:47:08.314
[SPEAKER_18]: Fox News Channel.

01:47:08.334 --> 01:47:09.535
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys know Fox News Channel?

01:47:10.135 --> 01:47:13.657
[SPEAKER_18]: Home of the Bill O'Reilly show and all those fun conservative talk programs.

01:47:13.897 --> 01:47:14.837
[SPEAKER_30]: If I didn't watch TV.

01:47:15.617 --> 01:47:16.858
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well, I know you don't watch TV.

01:47:16.938 --> 01:47:18.098
[SPEAKER_30]: I think I know, though.

01:47:18.138 --> 01:47:22.440
[SPEAKER_18]: They're giving CNN a little bit of a run because they have some talk programs that people, for some reason, like.

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:23.781
[SPEAKER_18]: But whatever.

01:47:23.921 --> 01:47:24.701
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't hate right now.

01:47:25.001 --> 01:47:29.143
[SPEAKER_18]: But actually, they ran an article about DDR and a weight loss article.

01:47:31.357 --> 01:47:34.379
[SPEAKER_18]: It's again another, isn't DDR great because people lost weight playing it?

01:47:34.419 --> 01:47:38.061
[SPEAKER_18]: But this article quotes some friends of the show.

01:47:38.681 --> 01:47:41.963
[SPEAKER_18]: Some buddies of Orange Lounge Radio were quoted in this article.

01:47:42.403 --> 01:47:46.346
[SPEAKER_18]: And Mel B and Sharksgirl were both quoted in this article, which I thought was cool.

01:47:46.666 --> 01:47:47.506
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so good for them.

01:47:48.027 --> 01:47:49.667
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a link to it over there on a website.

01:47:49.868 --> 01:47:51.288
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll kind of summarize for you guys.

01:47:52.749 --> 01:47:57.652
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just kind of talking about, you know, it breaks down how to play DDR, how DDR is played.

01:47:58.712 --> 01:48:03.715
[SPEAKER_18]: says the assistant editor at Wired Magazine, you're literally controlling the game with your whole body and not just your fingertips.

01:48:04.096 --> 01:48:06.997
[SPEAKER_18]: It's definitely a new genre that will probably get bigger.

01:48:10.579 --> 01:48:11.360
[SPEAKER_31]: That will probably.

01:48:12.381 --> 01:48:13.341
[SPEAKER_18]: It might get a little bigger.

01:48:13.521 --> 01:48:13.741
[SPEAKER_31]: Might.

01:48:14.222 --> 01:48:17.183
[SPEAKER_14]: Assuming it doesn't kill off its players with heart attacks.

01:48:21.046 --> 01:48:26.709
[SPEAKER_18]: But a relatively new genre, I don't know about you guys, but I've known about this game for

01:48:27.745 --> 01:48:28.986
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn near four years now.

01:48:29.106 --> 01:48:32.128
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know about the rest of you guys, but that's not that new.

01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:35.471
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm sorry, but it's not old school like Christ.

01:48:39.234 --> 01:48:41.016
[SPEAKER_14]: That is like way old school, man.

01:48:42.417 --> 01:48:44.038
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR is like a lot better.

01:48:45.157 --> 01:48:48.118
[SPEAKER_14]: He's probably talking about the history of time thing.

01:48:48.559 --> 01:48:49.879
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be relatively new.

01:48:50.759 --> 01:48:51.660
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right.

01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:54.481
[SPEAKER_18]: Considering the entire history of time, it would be new.

01:48:54.681 --> 01:48:59.603
[SPEAKER_18]: And considering that a lot of people that watch Fox News Channel are old people, it would make sense.

01:49:00.763 --> 01:49:09.526
[SPEAKER_18]: Our buddy Mel Baltazar says he was drawn to DDR because he likes music-based games, but after a while he noticed an unexpected side benefit.

01:49:11.147 --> 01:49:11.347
What?

01:49:13.084 --> 01:49:14.325
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not heart attacks.

01:49:16.046 --> 01:49:18.888
[SPEAKER_18]: In the first four months or so, I lost around 30 pounds.

01:49:18.988 --> 01:49:20.990
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, from Mel, it would have sounded something like this.

01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:25.193
[SPEAKER_18]: Yo, dawg, in the first 40 months or so, dawg, I lost around 30 pounds, dawg.

01:49:25.393 --> 01:49:26.154
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

01:49:28.635 --> 01:49:29.436
[SPEAKER_18]: He's going to kick my ass.

01:49:30.637 --> 01:49:33.459
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, because he did Randy Jackson to your idols.

01:49:33.499 --> 01:49:34.800
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a joke, it's a joke, Jesus.

01:49:35.861 --> 01:49:38.382
[SPEAKER_18]: In about six to eight months, I went from 280 to 230.

01:49:39.623 --> 01:49:41.865
[SPEAKER_18]: I play nowadays to keep in shape more than anything.

01:49:42.711 --> 01:49:43.231
[SPEAKER_18]: Very interesting.

01:49:44.072 --> 01:49:53.478
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR fan Melody Haman, also known as SharksGirl on this program, also shed pounds while she played going from about 220 to 143 at her lowest weight.

01:49:53.858 --> 01:49:56.900
[SPEAKER_18]: I never realized that she lost that much weight playing DDR.

01:49:57.901 --> 01:49:58.501
[SPEAKER_18]: I never knew that.

01:49:58.621 --> 01:49:59.922
[SPEAKER_18]: SharksGirl is like one of my best buds.

01:50:00.042 --> 01:50:03.304
[SPEAKER_18]: I never knew that she went from 220 to 143 from DDR.

01:50:03.644 --> 01:50:05.065
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I'm a bad friend.

01:50:06.006 --> 01:50:07.327
[SPEAKER_18]: She should so fire me.

01:50:09.008 --> 01:50:09.608
[SPEAKER_18]: I just didn't know.

01:50:10.409 --> 01:50:10.949
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's great.

01:50:12.537 --> 01:50:15.538
[SPEAKER_18]: She says, I'm significantly lighter than when I wasn't playing, she said.

01:50:15.578 --> 01:50:18.479
[SPEAKER_18]: You're not just using your hands, you're actually getting up and doing something.

01:50:19.779 --> 01:50:32.763
[SPEAKER_18]: With the obesity epidemic in America reaching epic proportions, I think it would have been better if they said biblical proportions, and video games, the internet and television accused of being among the culprits, entertainment that combines physical activity with technology could be the wave of the future.

01:50:33.742 --> 01:50:42.446
[SPEAKER_18]: said SportWall founder and CEO Kathy Lamberti, we have to give them the computer game packaged with their physical fitness, otherwise they're not going to be interested.

01:50:42.986 --> 01:50:43.807
[SPEAKER_18]: Kids have changed.

01:50:43.827 --> 01:50:47.328
[SPEAKER_18]: They've been taught how to be entertained and seduced by technology.

01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:50.550
[SPEAKER_18]: Seduced by technology.

01:50:53.211 --> 01:50:54.371
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR is going to seduce you.

01:50:54.391 --> 01:50:56.512
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know.

01:50:56.552 --> 01:50:58.553
[SPEAKER_14]: I get it hard on every time I pirate movies.

01:51:00.974 --> 01:51:02.795
[SPEAKER_14]: Technology sure knows how to seduce me.

01:51:07.644 --> 01:51:08.784
[SPEAKER_18]: Mel had another quote in here.

01:51:09.705 --> 01:51:14.165
[SPEAKER_18]: There's that stigma that people who play video games are slobs who just sit on the couch.

01:51:14.766 --> 01:51:16.366
[SPEAKER_18]: I always thought that was true, actually.

01:51:17.966 --> 01:51:22.487
[SPEAKER_18]: In DDR, it's more of an interactive experience where you're putting yourself into the game.

01:51:22.527 --> 01:51:27.228
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I don't know about you guys, but I got the DDR for Xbox this week.

01:51:27.808 --> 01:51:30.469
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, not this week, but a couple weeks ago, and I've been playing on Xbox Live.

01:51:30.929 --> 01:51:35.030
[SPEAKER_18]: And my fat ass has been on the couch schooling people by playing on the controller, so...

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:37.740
[SPEAKER_18]: and I've been having lots of fun.

01:51:44.202 --> 01:51:54.446
[SPEAKER_18]: To date, Konami Digital Entertainment, which distributes DDR, has sold more than 6.5 million copies worldwide and 1 million in the United States.

01:51:57.106 --> 01:51:58.047
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's see.

01:51:58.127 --> 01:51:59.587
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Jason, you notice I had a quote in here too.

01:51:59.927 --> 01:52:05.249
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a game that defies all the other games out there because the person has to get up and do the work.

01:52:06.869 --> 01:52:08.710
[SPEAKER_18]: Scooby Ball Scooby Ball Scooby Ball

01:52:38.155 --> 01:52:41.356
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, why don't you share with us what's going on in the sim scene these days?

01:52:41.537 --> 01:52:43.678
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there's got to be some news these past few weeks.

01:52:44.018 --> 01:52:45.399
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Turnabix is still going, right?

01:52:45.499 --> 01:52:45.839
[SPEAKER_18]: What's up?

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:48.040
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's still going.

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:48.961
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

01:52:49.441 --> 01:52:52.022
[SPEAKER_14]: The last release I got was number four.

01:52:53.663 --> 01:52:55.824
[SPEAKER_14]: And I haven't seen anything since then.

01:52:55.904 --> 01:52:56.965
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I've looked.

01:52:57.305 --> 01:52:58.606
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just nothing.

01:52:59.847 --> 01:53:03.869
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if they're still voting or what the hell's going on, but...

01:53:05.287 --> 01:53:07.388
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there's four sections for Tourney Mix.

01:53:08.869 --> 01:53:12.532
[SPEAKER_14]: Checking right now, see if there's number five.

01:53:12.692 --> 01:53:14.173
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, just bracket four still.

01:53:14.853 --> 01:53:18.115
[SPEAKER_14]: So apparently bracket four rounds up the end of Tourney Mix five.

01:53:20.917 --> 01:53:21.777
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what?

01:53:22.018 --> 01:53:22.858
[SPEAKER_14]: No one cares.

01:53:23.098 --> 01:53:26.120
[SPEAKER_14]: There's... Wasn't that many good stuff.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:32.984
[SPEAKER_14]: To be honest, it's still like the same 5% of the songs are decent and 2% are good and the rest suck.

01:53:33.485 --> 01:53:33.885
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um,

01:53:34.889 --> 01:53:37.690
[SPEAKER_14]: and some other interesting stuff if you're a TourneyMix fan.

01:53:38.251 --> 01:53:46.615
[SPEAKER_14]: On DDRUK's forums, they've got in the music production thread DJ Damien's V-Rare CD that he put out.

01:53:46.795 --> 01:53:49.356
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it's a zip file of all the songs that he's made.

01:53:51.097 --> 01:53:52.118
[SPEAKER_14]: They're okay.

01:53:52.238 --> 01:53:59.102
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got, you know, your famous Art 2 and then, you know, the Legend of Art that were featured in TourneyMix 1, 2, and 4, I think.

01:53:59.122 --> 01:53:59.242
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um...

01:54:03.749 --> 01:54:04.169
[SPEAKER_14]: What else?

01:54:04.930 --> 01:54:06.632
[SPEAKER_14]: Just some other crap that he's done.

01:54:07.152 --> 01:54:10.676
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want something to download on your board, there you go.

01:54:12.618 --> 01:54:15.241
[SPEAKER_14]: Aside from that, really not too much going on.

01:54:15.902 --> 01:54:17.524
[SPEAKER_14]: There is some interesting stuff, though.

01:54:17.624 --> 01:54:23.711
[SPEAKER_14]: I noticed that since DDRUK has their set media machine, which is DDX, or Dance...

01:54:24.242 --> 01:54:26.264
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance something or other, I don't know, whatever.

01:54:27.085 --> 01:54:35.011
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, it's got internet rankings, which I'm assuming is probably something that's thrown into Stepmania now.

01:54:35.091 --> 01:54:38.053
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, hey, look for internet rankings, it'll be coming soon.

01:54:38.594 --> 01:54:41.596
[SPEAKER_14]: As well as extended light support, people are working on that right now.

01:54:42.037 --> 01:54:46.460
[SPEAKER_14]: There's talks about using serial ports, maybe USB ports for lights.

01:54:46.961 --> 01:54:50.764
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, parallel ports are, you know, supported, so...

01:54:51.559 --> 01:54:53.801
[SPEAKER_14]: There's information on DDR Maniacs for that.

01:54:54.401 --> 01:54:59.585
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, tons more sim files for download on, um, Bomani Style and their sim file database.

01:55:00.166 --> 01:55:06.691
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of them suck, though, but, hey, you know, look at the rankings on the sides, um, to get an idea what might be good and what's not.

01:55:07.571 --> 01:55:10.473
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, aside from that, really not too much stuff going on.

01:55:10.554 --> 01:55:13.836
[SPEAKER_14]: No new alphas, um, for Stepmania released.

01:55:14.076 --> 01:55:16.978
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's just been kinda slow.

01:55:18.139 --> 01:55:19.480
[SPEAKER_14]: Slow news week.

01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:20.241
[SPEAKER_14]: No, um,

01:55:20.971 --> 01:55:30.533
[SPEAKER_14]: Service Pack 6 for Ultramix, which we did not mention, because that is news and all.

01:55:32.233 --> 01:55:34.994
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing yet, because it has not come out yet.

01:55:36.514 --> 01:55:38.334
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty much all that's going on.

01:55:38.574 --> 01:55:44.215
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a nice thread, though, on DDR Maniacs' Setmania theme boards.

01:55:44.475 --> 01:55:47.616
[SPEAKER_14]: They're basically how-to guides to make your skin better, which is cool.

01:55:49.009 --> 01:55:53.352
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just proves that you can make a sim that looks exactly like in the group.

01:55:53.493 --> 01:55:56.135
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

01:55:56.155 --> 01:55:58.737
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyways.

01:55:59.137 --> 01:55:59.898
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of agree.

01:56:00.579 --> 01:56:03.882
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody in the chatroom said DJ Damien's kind of crap stuff.

01:56:04.462 --> 01:56:07.184
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe it's just because I'm not a cool kid, but I don't get the joke.

01:56:07.345 --> 01:56:10.808
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not funny, and it's kind of stupid to me.

01:56:11.348 --> 01:56:12.589
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I guess it's just British.

01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:14.771
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, Spice Girls, I get that.

01:56:14.951 --> 01:56:15.992
[SPEAKER_18]: DJ Damien, I don't get it.

01:56:17.932 --> 01:56:18.472
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Jamie.

01:56:20.234 --> 01:56:21.955
[SPEAKER_31]: What, about him being crappy?

01:56:22.175 --> 01:56:22.435
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:56:24.016 --> 01:56:27.058
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you picked up the microphone, so I thought you were going to say something.

01:56:27.138 --> 01:56:27.838
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't get it.

01:56:28.279 --> 01:56:28.519
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:31.341
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you heard his stuff?

01:56:32.461 --> 01:56:32.561
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

01:56:32.601 --> 01:56:34.443
[SPEAKER_18]: Play Jamie a little bit of one of these songs.

01:56:34.563 --> 01:56:35.023
[SPEAKER_18]: Play the best one.

01:56:35.043 --> 01:56:35.803
[SPEAKER_18]: The best one?

01:56:37.044 --> 01:56:37.805
[SPEAKER_18]: The best one.

01:56:39.766 --> 01:56:40.707
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't wait to hear this.

01:56:43.949 --> 01:56:47.271
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think this should be getting any airtime on the show, but since Loki brought it up...

01:56:52.239 --> 01:56:55.441
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, sure, Ballad of Tom Jones.

01:56:56.181 --> 01:56:57.242
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's hear a little bit of this.

01:57:01.604 --> 01:57:02.505
[SPEAKER_18]: Put it in the middle somewhere.

01:57:04.626 --> 01:57:08.528
[SPEAKER_07]: The two of us would surely have ended up dead.

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:12.110
[SPEAKER_07]: You thought that from killing each other.

01:57:12.130 --> 01:57:12.430
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:57:12.450 --> 01:57:13.851
[SPEAKER_27]: Tom Jones, Tom Jones.

01:57:13.891 --> 01:57:17.012
[SPEAKER_27]: You'll never know, but you saved my life.

01:57:17.032 --> 01:57:18.173
[SPEAKER_27]: Tom Jones, Tom Jones.

01:57:35.290 --> 01:57:36.470
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh god, that's horrible.

01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:38.491
[SPEAKER_18]: See, I don't get it.

01:57:38.511 --> 01:57:39.451
[SPEAKER_31]: Why do you think he's good?

01:57:40.011 --> 01:57:42.112
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't get it.

01:57:42.292 --> 01:57:42.852
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what it is?

01:57:42.932 --> 01:57:44.752
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the William Hung of DDR.

01:57:44.932 --> 01:57:45.933
[SPEAKER_18]: That is exactly what it is.

01:57:46.913 --> 01:57:49.734
[SPEAKER_29]: But William Hung is good compared to this guy.

01:57:59.376 --> 01:58:01.377
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I don't know.

01:58:01.497 --> 01:58:01.777
[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever.

01:58:02.386 --> 01:58:05.929
[SPEAKER_31]: The song makes... Listening to that made me angsty and full of rage.

01:58:06.129 --> 01:58:08.591
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, then we'll have to get into the FUs very soon after we come back.

01:58:08.991 --> 01:58:15.036
[SPEAKER_18]: But... But, um, we got, um... We've got a cage match winner to announce, boys and girls.

01:58:16.177 --> 01:58:17.598
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you're excited to hear about this.

01:58:18.218 --> 01:58:23.662
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight's cage match winner was the one and only... This should be a big surprise to you guys.

01:58:24.183 --> 01:58:28.226
[SPEAKER_30]: Loki... BT with Kimo Sari.

01:58:28.246 --> 01:58:29.287
[SPEAKER_31]: That's who I would have voted for.

01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:33.051
[SPEAKER_18]: You wouldn't have even voted for the own song you put in?

01:58:33.571 --> 01:58:33.851
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

01:58:34.271 --> 01:58:34.551
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:58:34.571 --> 01:58:37.352
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I have come very close to using that song before.

01:58:37.572 --> 01:58:39.813
[SPEAKER_31]: Well... I thought that I might have, but it was another song.

01:58:39.953 --> 01:58:44.614
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm going to be gone for two weeks, I'm going to give you guys such crap songs to play in cage match while I'm gone.

01:58:44.654 --> 01:58:45.234
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't wait.

01:58:45.595 --> 01:58:46.515
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll pick them for you, Rob.

01:58:46.615 --> 01:58:46.875
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

01:58:47.355 --> 01:58:48.836
[SPEAKER_18]: I already have them lined up.

01:58:49.736 --> 01:58:51.016
[SPEAKER_18]: I already have them lined up.

01:58:52.037 --> 01:58:52.997
[SPEAKER_18]: So tune in next week.

01:58:53.337 --> 01:58:54.157
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be there in spirit.

01:58:55.158 --> 01:58:55.438
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:58:56.338 --> 01:58:56.518
[SPEAKER_18]: Just...

01:58:58.342 --> 01:59:01.785
[SPEAKER_18]: When we come back from this next break, boys and girls, the FUs of the week.

01:59:01.925 --> 01:59:03.426
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you've got some rants in you.

01:59:04.767 --> 01:59:05.267
[SPEAKER_18]: Send them.

01:59:05.928 --> 01:59:06.809
[SPEAKER_18]: What'd you say, Jamie?

01:59:07.449 --> 01:59:08.390
[SPEAKER_31]: I made a request.

01:59:09.431 --> 01:59:09.831
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:59:09.911 --> 01:59:13.234
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I thought you said, when I said, I know you've got some rants in you, I thought you said a ton.

01:59:14.715 --> 01:59:16.236
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, a ton of those, too.

01:59:18.297 --> 01:59:19.558
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

01:59:20.399 --> 01:59:23.862
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah, we'll get to the FUs of the week.

01:59:23.882 --> 01:59:25.283
[SPEAKER_18]: So send those in over private message.

01:59:27.253 --> 01:59:28.273
[SPEAKER_18]: and we'll take care of that.

01:59:28.774 --> 01:59:32.375
[SPEAKER_18]: In the meantime, more poppin' music songs this break, including one Jamie wants to hear.

01:59:32.415 --> 01:59:33.595
[SPEAKER_18]: She always wants to hear this song.

01:59:33.935 --> 01:59:34.775
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what's sad, though?

01:59:35.256 --> 01:59:39.117
[SPEAKER_18]: I lost my folder of the poppin' nine consumer songs.

01:59:39.137 --> 01:59:39.437
[SPEAKER_30]: Have them.

01:59:39.817 --> 01:59:42.158
[SPEAKER_18]: Good, because I need to get them for you, because I don't have Don't Cry Jesus anymore.

01:59:42.178 --> 01:59:42.778
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll get them when I get them.

01:59:42.838 --> 01:59:43.398
[SPEAKER_18]: You can send it to me.

01:59:43.638 --> 01:59:45.179
[SPEAKER_18]: Because my desktop got erased.

01:59:45.459 --> 01:59:47.339
[SPEAKER_18]: Imagine if Loki's desktop got erased.

01:59:47.459 --> 01:59:51.461
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:59:51.801 --> 01:59:52.121
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't cry.

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:59.137
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back after some more poppin' music, starting off with Gatchaman and some more stuff in here.

01:59:59.378 --> 02:00:01.419
[SPEAKER_18]: And when we come back, FUs of the Week, send them now!

02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:07.844
Who is it?

02:00:07.884 --> 02:00:08.305
Who is it?

02:00:08.345 --> 02:00:08.965
Who is it?

02:00:09.085 --> 02:00:15.410
[SPEAKER_05]: A shadow dancing in the distance of the sky A shadow of white wings

02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:27.593
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

02:00:58.539 --> 02:01:00.942
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:01:41.663 --> 02:01:42.384
Thank you for watching!

02:02:28.024 --> 02:02:28.984
Thank you for watching.

02:02:29.004 --> 02:02:29.684
See you next time.

02:03:17.396 --> 02:03:18.497
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:35.673
Thank you for watching!

02:05:37.171 --> 02:05:38.672
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, did you hear about that show?

02:05:39.192 --> 02:05:39.752
[SPEAKER_23]: What show?

02:05:40.052 --> 02:05:45.534
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

02:05:45.934 --> 02:05:47.215
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I've heard of that station.

02:05:47.315 --> 02:05:47.635
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

02:05:48.055 --> 02:05:50.156
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

02:05:50.636 --> 02:05:52.917
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

02:05:53.117 --> 02:05:54.077
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, you die.

02:05:54.697 --> 02:05:55.238
[SPEAKER_08]: I, what?

02:05:56.058 --> 02:06:00.199
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

02:06:02.478 --> 02:06:03.598
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:03.758 --> 02:06:05.159
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen or DIE!

02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:12.440
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:14.760
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week very shortly.

02:06:17.841 --> 02:06:20.941
[SPEAKER_18]: Gosh, I'm not sure what else is going on in the money world right now.

02:06:21.401 --> 02:06:23.562
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, you seem to be more on top of things than I am.

02:06:24.962 --> 02:06:26.022
[SPEAKER_17]: What are you checking out there?

02:06:26.962 --> 02:06:29.363
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, like I was saying earlier, their...

02:06:30.592 --> 02:06:46.418
[SPEAKER_14]: DDRUK's DanceDX, and they're on their version 2 now, and I'm going to, in just one second here, link the chatroom to their gallery for this, which it's actually, it's a very well put together set menu machine, I might add.

02:06:46.838 --> 02:06:54.601
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a lot of people working on it, and it's the way I wish Golfland would work, where you have more than one person working on it.

02:06:55.404 --> 02:06:57.445
[SPEAKER_18]: What exactly is going on with that thing?

02:06:57.685 --> 02:07:01.746
[SPEAKER_18]: Even our chatroom's curious, because it's been three weeks since we really had an update, and I know there's kind of some stuff going on.

02:07:01.786 --> 02:07:06.187
[SPEAKER_18]: What exactly happened with that EX2 project you've been really heavily involved with?

02:07:07.387 --> 02:07:08.528
[SPEAKER_14]: Keith broke the motherboard.

02:07:09.048 --> 02:07:10.588
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much what it comes down to.

02:07:11.249 --> 02:07:18.751
[SPEAKER_14]: And no, I'm not going to go buy a new motherboard, because as it was, I put more time and effort into it than was needed.

02:07:18.771 --> 02:07:21.872
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what it sounds like he wants me to do, is get a new motherboard for it.

02:07:21.892 --> 02:07:22.892
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, no, so...

02:07:23.821 --> 02:07:24.922
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever happens, happens.

02:07:25.262 --> 02:07:27.563
[SPEAKER_14]: They got their money out of it, I got my money out of it.

02:07:28.444 --> 02:07:30.085
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no one's at a real loss.

02:07:31.665 --> 02:07:45.973
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks for them because they rewired their whole cabinet, but you know... Someday I guess we can put a new motherboard in it, but I really... It's just a pain in the ass the way it was set up and things don't work that should work.

02:07:46.714 --> 02:07:49.455
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just really annoying and real frustrating.

02:07:49.475 --> 02:07:49.535
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

02:07:51.711 --> 02:07:56.633
[SPEAKER_14]: I learned from it, and hopefully my next project won't be as bad.

02:07:58.833 --> 02:08:00.654
[SPEAKER_18]: Any chance you'll do a cabinet for a different arcade?

02:08:02.394 --> 02:08:03.915
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that's what the other project is.

02:08:04.635 --> 02:08:10.036
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a cabinet for another arcade, it's a plug-and-play upgrade for any arcade.

02:08:10.557 --> 02:08:11.977
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm looking into right now.

02:08:12.157 --> 02:08:18.839
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, taking all the stuff I've learned from this, and we'll apply it to any arcade, because guess what I found out?

02:08:19.341 --> 02:08:22.143
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't need to license Statmania from them.

02:08:22.363 --> 02:08:24.744
[SPEAKER_14]: It's free to sell, do whatever you want with it.

02:08:25.505 --> 02:08:31.528
[SPEAKER_14]: As long as you keep the development team's credit in there, which that's already hard programmed into it.

02:08:32.169 --> 02:08:40.814
[SPEAKER_14]: So, technically, yeah, I could go out there, make an upgrade for an arcade, and sell it, and make money off it.

02:08:42.655 --> 02:08:45.597
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm looking into it.

02:08:46.707 --> 02:08:48.989
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I wonder how many people are going to steal your idea right there.

02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.489
[SPEAKER_18]: Huh?

02:08:49.649 --> 02:08:50.570
[SPEAKER_18]: Check your legal channels.

02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:50.991
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

02:08:51.671 --> 02:08:52.592
[SPEAKER_18]: Just cover your butt.

02:08:52.992 --> 02:08:55.935
[SPEAKER_18]: But I figure if they can get away with that Megamix thing.

02:08:56.555 --> 02:08:57.176
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's what it is.

02:08:57.616 --> 02:09:04.101
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have to check any legal channels because all I'm doing is providing the hardware and the program to run it.

02:09:04.822 --> 02:09:05.983
[SPEAKER_14]: They made the program.

02:09:06.203 --> 02:09:07.084
[SPEAKER_14]: I made the hardware.

02:09:07.604 --> 02:09:09.145
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing I can get in trouble for.

02:09:09.165 --> 02:09:11.247
[SPEAKER_31]: What do you mean?

02:09:11.347 --> 02:09:12.088
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the program.

02:09:13.229 --> 02:09:14.169
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all Stepmania.

02:09:14.189 --> 02:09:15.270
[SPEAKER_14]: That's their licensing.

02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:16.171
[SPEAKER_14]: That's their problem.

02:09:16.579 --> 02:09:18.660
[SPEAKER_14]: All I'm doing is making the hardware setup for it.

02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:21.622
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no way I can get in trouble for building a PC.

02:09:22.162 --> 02:09:27.585
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, you know, they can try, but, you know, it's not going to work.

02:09:28.005 --> 02:09:29.726
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's if I were to do it.

02:09:31.046 --> 02:09:33.728
[SPEAKER_18]: And if the coppers ever come after me, Loki did it!

02:09:33.988 --> 02:09:34.928
[SPEAKER_18]: He had the gun!

02:09:35.349 --> 02:09:38.290
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Loki with a revolver in the conservatory.

02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:39.751
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw it with my own eyes.

02:09:42.292 --> 02:09:43.793
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get on with the FUs of the week, shall we?

02:09:45.037 --> 02:09:47.478
[SPEAKER_18]: What do we do during the FUs of the week, Miss Jamie?

02:09:47.718 --> 02:10:03.944
[SPEAKER_27]: We bitch and moon.

02:10:04.784 --> 02:10:06.344
[SPEAKER_30]: I really miss that music.

02:10:06.845 --> 02:10:08.605
[SPEAKER_30]: Really, really miss that.

02:10:08.685 --> 02:10:09.886
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm going to keep it for a while.

02:10:11.606 --> 02:10:14.007
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway, my first FU of the week goes towards

02:10:14.622 --> 02:10:20.348
[SPEAKER_31]: People who go 15 miles under the speed limit, when I'm wanting to go 10 over it.

02:10:21.889 --> 02:10:24.031
[SPEAKER_31]: Damn them.

02:10:25.693 --> 02:10:34.982
[SPEAKER_31]: Also, it goes to the Safeway over on Madison, like, on the way here, for not carrying IM's cat food.

02:10:35.836 --> 02:10:36.997
[SPEAKER_31]: which is what I feed Shermie.

02:10:38.538 --> 02:10:42.361
[SPEAKER_31]: A big F you goes to cat food in general to having their first product be wheat.

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:44.462
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, what cat?

02:10:45.683 --> 02:10:49.106
[SPEAKER_31]: Have you ever seen a stray cat go up and want wheat?

02:10:50.207 --> 02:10:54.150
[SPEAKER_31]: No, they're going to go after the open can of tuna that's sitting around by the trash can.

02:10:54.990 --> 02:10:56.712
[SPEAKER_31]: They're going to go kill a bird or a squirrel.

02:10:57.732 --> 02:10:59.794
[SPEAKER_31]: Rob, have you ever known of any cats that go after wheat?

02:11:01.035 --> 02:11:01.735
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't say I have.

02:11:02.035 --> 02:11:03.537
[SPEAKER_31]: Have you ever met a vegetarian cat?

02:11:03.957 --> 02:11:04.677
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't say I have.

02:11:04.838 --> 02:11:05.278
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay then.

02:11:08.049 --> 02:11:14.412
[SPEAKER_31]: and Jeremy got really, really fat when I was feeding her the other kind of cat food that had meat.

02:11:14.892 --> 02:11:19.074
[SPEAKER_31]: And then I switched her over to cat food that had meat as the first product.

02:11:19.494 --> 02:11:21.775
[SPEAKER_31]: And lo and behold, she lost weight.

02:11:21.855 --> 02:11:26.777
[SPEAKER_31]: And by the way, cats eat grass because they can puke it back up and get stuff out of their system.

02:11:27.617 --> 02:11:29.238
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, that's why cats eat grass.

02:11:29.458 --> 02:11:29.838
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

02:11:30.518 --> 02:11:32.459
[SPEAKER_31]: And I kid you not, watch a cat.

02:11:32.659 --> 02:11:35.261
[SPEAKER_31]: They eat grass, then they hack it all back up.

02:11:37.382 --> 02:11:38.862
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, any animal will do that.

02:11:39.223 --> 02:11:40.683
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go eat grass and throw it up.

02:11:41.204 --> 02:11:41.364
[SPEAKER_31]: Ew.

02:11:42.564 --> 02:11:44.105
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go make mud pies, Jamie.

02:11:44.725 --> 02:11:47.547
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, okay.

02:11:50.188 --> 02:11:54.510
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway, another F you goes toward a lack of money.

02:11:55.552 --> 02:12:20.261
[SPEAKER_31]: a lack of time, a big F you goes to distance, um, also, um, an F you goes towards stupid people, and I don't mean people who just don't understand, you know, people who, well, there's a, there's types of stupidity, the stupidity I'm referring to is lack of common sense, okay,

02:12:20.916 --> 02:12:29.358
[SPEAKER_31]: For the people who should not be involved in any part of the gene pool, these are the people that I would like removed from my universe.

02:12:32.299 --> 02:12:40.461
[SPEAKER_31]: Another F you goes toward myself for having all of these ideas for writing and just not being able to get them out of my head.

02:12:40.661 --> 02:12:42.922
[SPEAKER_31]: I hate writer's block with an unholy passion.

02:12:43.562 --> 02:12:44.642
[SPEAKER_31]: It's been driving me nuts.

02:12:45.502 --> 02:12:48.523
[SPEAKER_31]: So an F you to writer's block.

02:12:49.122 --> 02:12:51.303
[SPEAKER_31]: and Artist's Block, although I have started drawing again.

02:12:51.644 --> 02:12:55.166
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm doing a commission drawing right now.

02:12:57.007 --> 02:12:59.789
[SPEAKER_31]: Another FU goes toward my college.

02:13:01.130 --> 02:13:02.871
[SPEAKER_31]: But, okay, this is what I don't get.

02:13:03.091 --> 02:13:05.032
[SPEAKER_31]: And this may be a little bit technical for some people.

02:13:06.153 --> 02:13:16.259
[SPEAKER_31]: When you take out a student loan, if you're going for federal loans and you have to fill out your FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, so that your school will know how much...

02:13:17.074 --> 02:13:20.136
[SPEAKER_31]: Your family makes, or through an incentive, how much you make.

02:13:20.596 --> 02:13:27.019
[SPEAKER_31]: So I can understand that since they're doing a federal loan, they need to see how much you are going to be eligible for.

02:13:27.579 --> 02:13:32.301
[SPEAKER_31]: But why on earth do I need to fill out a FAFSA for a private loan?

02:13:33.282 --> 02:13:36.143
[SPEAKER_31]: I sort of see the reason behind it.

02:13:36.203 --> 02:13:37.844
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just a big pain in the ass right now.

02:13:38.504 --> 02:13:39.965
[SPEAKER_31]: So I've got to go out and...

02:13:40.782 --> 02:13:48.627
[SPEAKER_31]: I've done my FAFSA already, I just have to wait on the school to get my student aid report so I can get my award letter, so I can apply for the loan, so I can get my laptop.

02:13:49.327 --> 02:13:54.831
[SPEAKER_31]: I need a laptop because I'm going into database management.

02:13:54.891 --> 02:14:01.074
[SPEAKER_31]: And another FU goes toward being really homesick lately.

02:14:01.575 --> 02:14:08.539
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to go back home for a little while and not have the money to do it in a little while.

02:14:11.070 --> 02:14:15.673
[SPEAKER_30]: and the rest of you guys for just being the busy time of year at work.

02:14:16.153 --> 02:14:16.914
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's about it.

02:14:17.794 --> 02:14:20.356
[SPEAKER_30]: But yeah, I'm really hungry.

02:14:20.836 --> 02:14:20.976
[SPEAKER_23]: Aw.

02:14:22.077 --> 02:14:22.617
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright then.

02:14:23.317 --> 02:14:23.818
[SPEAKER_23]: Moving on.

02:14:24.118 --> 02:14:25.279
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, your turn.

02:14:25.539 --> 02:14:26.900
[SPEAKER_23]: What's pissing you off this week?

02:14:28.501 --> 02:14:30.742
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot about this song.

02:14:31.883 --> 02:14:32.003
[SPEAKER_11]: Um.

02:14:33.984 --> 02:14:34.644
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one.

02:14:35.385 --> 02:14:37.146
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really know.

02:14:37.186 --> 02:14:38.987
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, it's been so long.

02:14:39.951 --> 02:14:43.814
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, of course, fuck you to the safe and sane fireworks.

02:14:44.214 --> 02:14:53.100
[SPEAKER_14]: They're really lame, and when you have a firework that lasts shorter, you know, the match lighting lasts longer than the actual firework.

02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:57.142
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had orgasms that lasted longer than some of those fireworks, seriously.

02:14:58.423 --> 02:15:00.465
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's just like really pathetic.

02:15:00.525 --> 02:15:05.608
[SPEAKER_14]: You're like, wow, you know, lighting a candle would have been more exciting than those fireworks.

02:15:06.311 --> 02:15:11.015
[SPEAKER_14]: So, that really sucks, but luckily we know how to get our money out of safe and sane fireworks.

02:15:11.035 --> 02:15:12.836
[SPEAKER_14]: That's burning the packaging that they come in.

02:15:14.937 --> 02:15:16.499
[SPEAKER_14]: So, hooray.

02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:21.763
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two goes to the heat.

02:15:22.223 --> 02:15:22.984
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like it.

02:15:23.344 --> 02:15:26.846
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been pretty hot.

02:15:27.147 --> 02:15:28.848
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it being nice and cool out.

02:15:29.168 --> 02:15:31.510
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, comfy Bay Area weather.

02:15:32.250 --> 02:15:33.291
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't like this dry heat.

02:15:33.851 --> 02:15:34.111
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks.

02:15:34.872 --> 02:15:41.237
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, also, um... Just be glad that this is in the South where it's very humid.

02:15:41.457 --> 02:15:50.144
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, of course, you know, after seeing Fahrenheit 9-11 again, and, uh, fuck Bush just because, you know, he's stupid.

02:15:51.565 --> 02:15:57.369
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um... Really, I'm not that pissed off at stuff that much.

02:15:57.905 --> 02:16:00.248
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you, the retarded people on Final Fantasy XI.

02:16:00.448 --> 02:16:02.210
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's some really dumb people out there.

02:16:02.290 --> 02:16:03.511
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess pretty much everyone.

02:16:04.192 --> 02:16:06.014
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of dumb people everywhere.

02:16:06.914 --> 02:16:08.876
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hate dumb people and when you would kill them.

02:16:09.797 --> 02:16:13.661
[SPEAKER_14]: And fuck you, the goddamn DVR EX2 thing being broken again.

02:16:13.701 --> 02:16:16.184
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, I can't fix that machine enough.

02:16:16.685 --> 02:16:20.889
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I have to be at the point to where I say, you know, fuck it, I don't care.

02:16:21.303 --> 02:16:31.272
[SPEAKER_14]: and once again, fuck you to Keith because that promise he made that I would get to dismantle the Beat Mania machine and take some of the parts for it because they were going to get rid of it anyways, well, he did it without me and threw the machine away.

02:16:31.492 --> 02:16:32.152
[SPEAKER_14]: So, fuck him.

02:16:34.494 --> 02:16:37.797
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um... Yeah, that's really all I have.

02:16:38.218 --> 02:16:39.078
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just done.

02:16:39.759 --> 02:16:44.083
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just... I don't know what the hell my PC, like, instantly restarted today.

02:16:44.523 --> 02:16:50.446
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, when Ranma was going to log out of Final Fantasy, just the whole PC restarted, so now I have to figure out what's wrong with that.

02:16:50.767 --> 02:16:52.668
[SPEAKER_14]: So all I did today was open the case up.

02:16:52.788 --> 02:16:59.392
[SPEAKER_14]: I touched nothing inside, opened the case up because I noticed there was a lot of dust on the outside, and I wanted to see how much it, you know, collected on the inside.

02:16:59.792 --> 02:17:04.715
[SPEAKER_14]: Opened it up, looked inside, closed case, done, and it goes and gets all fucked up, so...

02:17:06.255 --> 02:17:09.996
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and fuck you the cool web search for hijacking Internet Explorer.

02:17:10.977 --> 02:17:14.678
[SPEAKER_14]: Internet Explorer is completely useless for a while, so you know what?

02:17:14.698 --> 02:17:16.178
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I'm using Firefox now.

02:17:16.298 --> 02:17:17.679
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you, Microsoft.

02:17:18.659 --> 02:17:19.159
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm done.

02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:23.260
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you have something you wanted to add, Jamie?

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:23.481
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry.

02:17:23.641 --> 02:17:25.421
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something in mind, too.

02:17:26.221 --> 02:17:26.561
[SPEAKER_23]: Ugh.

02:17:27.602 --> 02:17:28.602
[SPEAKER_18]: Spammers can go to hell.

02:17:30.903 --> 02:17:31.183
[SPEAKER_18]: My turn.

02:17:33.804 --> 02:17:36.065
[SPEAKER_18]: An F you to having the hiccups for two weeks.

02:17:36.386 --> 02:17:37.366
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it wasn't that one.

02:17:37.386 --> 02:17:37.886
[SPEAKER_18]: Three days.

02:17:40.708 --> 02:17:42.088
[SPEAKER_18]: And that really sucked.

02:17:42.909 --> 02:17:46.671
[SPEAKER_18]: And an F you to my work wanting to send me away for two weeks.

02:17:48.852 --> 02:17:52.154
[SPEAKER_18]: My work wants to send me away for two weeks and thusly I'm going to miss all this cool stuff that was going on.

02:17:52.454 --> 02:17:55.375
[SPEAKER_18]: My friend that's in Iraq right now is going to be home and I'm going to be gone.

02:17:56.736 --> 02:17:57.977
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to get tickets.

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:00.478
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, back it up.

02:18:00.518 --> 02:18:02.519
[SPEAKER_18]: Shark Skrull was going to treat me to an Atlantis concert.

02:18:03.283 --> 02:18:05.264
[SPEAKER_18]: and I don't get to go to that now because I'm not going to be here.

02:18:06.465 --> 02:18:09.566
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go.

02:18:10.106 --> 02:18:12.047
[SPEAKER_18]: And, yeah, so, sad.

02:18:12.507 --> 02:18:13.128
[SPEAKER_18]: What else was I going to miss?

02:18:13.148 --> 02:18:14.888
[SPEAKER_18]: There was something else big I'm missing, I forget.

02:18:15.028 --> 02:18:17.670
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm missing this show twice in a row, but, you know, you got to do what you got to do.

02:18:19.770 --> 02:18:23.592
[SPEAKER_11]: Real life sucks sometimes.

02:18:23.732 --> 02:18:30.875
[SPEAKER_18]: Also an F you to Golfland and Scandia together for helping make Sacramento Arcades a big fat joke.

02:18:31.196 --> 02:18:31.896
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate living here.

02:18:33.194 --> 02:18:35.775
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, no, I really like living here, but as a gamer, it's pathetic.

02:18:36.275 --> 02:18:36.616
[SPEAKER_18]: Honestly.

02:18:36.696 --> 02:18:38.637
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no arcades in Sacramento.

02:18:38.797 --> 02:18:38.997
[SPEAKER_18]: None.

02:18:40.598 --> 02:18:41.398
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss the game room.

02:18:41.498 --> 02:18:42.238
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss it so much.

02:18:42.278 --> 02:18:43.439
[SPEAKER_18]: You know why I miss the game room?

02:18:43.899 --> 02:18:46.240
[SPEAKER_18]: Because they didn't have ticket machines at the game room.

02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:47.481
[SPEAKER_18]: That is why I miss them.

02:18:48.441 --> 02:18:50.002
[SPEAKER_31]: They were all about fighting games.

02:18:51.917 --> 02:18:55.060
[SPEAKER_18]: I would rather have the fighting game crowd than the birthday crowd, enough said.

02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:56.081
[SPEAKER_30]: And they had victory.

02:18:57.202 --> 02:18:57.602
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, they did.

02:18:57.622 --> 02:18:59.184
[SPEAKER_18]: And they had pinball games too, which made me happy.

02:18:59.844 --> 02:19:00.985
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, I can't stand it.

02:19:01.346 --> 02:19:01.806
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had it.

02:19:01.906 --> 02:19:02.627
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had my limit.

02:19:02.967 --> 02:19:06.731
[SPEAKER_18]: I've reached my limit of putting up with kids and teenagers.

02:19:07.131 --> 02:19:09.734
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking, like, 15, 16 year olds.

02:19:09.754 --> 02:19:12.556
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I know a lot of 15, 16 year olds listen to this program.

02:19:12.916 --> 02:19:17.621
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm not, I'm not trying to be generalizing, but I'm talking about those kids that probably pick on you at school.

02:19:18.041 --> 02:19:20.565
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, those guys hang out at the arcade, too.

02:19:21.025 --> 02:19:22.988
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're such asses.

02:19:23.288 --> 02:19:25.051
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, my God.

02:19:25.311 --> 02:19:28.515
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you to their parents for making them.

02:19:29.637 --> 02:19:31.359
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish you would have aborted those childs.

02:19:32.510 --> 02:19:34.111
[SPEAKER_30]: Rob, do what I do.

02:19:34.651 --> 02:19:35.511
[SPEAKER_30]: Have them thrown out.

02:19:35.691 --> 02:19:42.094
[SPEAKER_14]: Keith would be able to, you know, fix the problems at Golf Land if it weren't for the kids, like, ripping shit off the games.

02:19:42.654 --> 02:19:45.475
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, before it used to be ripping keys off the keyboard mania.

02:19:45.515 --> 02:19:46.316
[SPEAKER_14]: And changing diapers.

02:19:46.696 --> 02:19:47.956
[SPEAKER_14]: And changing diapers on them.

02:19:48.396 --> 02:19:50.837
[SPEAKER_14]: And now it's ripping the cymbals off the drums.

02:19:51.878 --> 02:19:53.278
[SPEAKER_14]: Or just chunks of the cymbals.

02:19:53.819 --> 02:19:57.280
[SPEAKER_14]: But Golf Land's defense, they did add a subway, and that makes me happy.

02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:01.961
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't fucking go there to eat Subway.

02:20:02.242 --> 02:20:06.785
[SPEAKER_18]: I go there to play DDR, not be harassed and get shit thrown at me.

02:20:08.846 --> 02:20:10.367
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no arcades in this town anymore.

02:20:10.387 --> 02:20:12.989
[SPEAKER_18]: Until I open my dream arcade.

02:20:13.129 --> 02:20:17.432
[SPEAKER_31]: If I feel like just going somewhere to be a bitch, I'll just go to Golf Land and have people thrown out.

02:20:17.452 --> 02:20:19.974
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, maybe we should just go there regularly and have people thrown out regularly.

02:20:19.994 --> 02:20:21.075
[SPEAKER_31]: That makes me feel better.

02:20:21.135 --> 02:20:23.096
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we should do it.

02:20:24.057 --> 02:20:25.818
[SPEAKER_18]: We could have like a squad name or something.

02:20:27.492 --> 02:20:28.412
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, let's move on.

02:20:28.452 --> 02:20:30.633
[SPEAKER_31]: The Arcade Protection Agency.

02:20:31.813 --> 02:20:32.994
[SPEAKER_14]: Got a small story about that.

02:20:33.474 --> 02:20:34.634
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really small.

02:20:34.855 --> 02:20:42.137
[SPEAKER_14]: There was, you know, our friend, Mr. Pirate Power, you know, that's in, I don't know, Toadie, I guess.

02:20:43.237 --> 02:20:45.598
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to get him on the show sometime because he's actually pretty funny.

02:20:45.638 --> 02:20:48.459
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he'd be pretty good for a guest on the show, but anyway.

02:20:49.119 --> 02:20:56.082
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, so he was down at Golf Land with Prestige and stuff there and some stupid kid came up and was acting like an ass and they scared him and he ran out.

02:20:56.382 --> 02:20:56.862
[SPEAKER_14]: That was funny.

02:20:59.383 --> 02:21:00.363
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought there was more to the story.

02:21:00.384 --> 02:21:03.845
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought you would have like how he was thrown out or what was said.

02:21:06.206 --> 02:21:09.788
[SPEAKER_18]: Puppy's volunteering to sign up for the Arcade Ejection Squad.

02:21:12.589 --> 02:21:13.450
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, moving on.

02:21:14.770 --> 02:21:17.112
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, AES, the Arcade Ejection Squad.

02:21:17.832 --> 02:21:18.993
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck up, you outta here!

02:21:19.993 --> 02:21:21.674
[SPEAKER_31]: We should totally start a website.

02:21:28.874 --> 02:21:29.735
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm loving this idea.

02:21:30.736 --> 02:21:33.579
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to single-handedly save this arcade scene in this town.

02:21:33.599 --> 02:21:34.379
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, moving on.

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:38.103
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, we did once by putting all these pictures of the broken machines on.

02:21:38.623 --> 02:21:39.364
[SPEAKER_31]: That's very true.

02:21:39.384 --> 02:21:40.925
[SPEAKER_18]: We ought to do that again.

02:21:41.206 --> 02:21:41.906
[SPEAKER_18]: We ought to do that again.

02:21:42.587 --> 02:21:45.370
[SPEAKER_18]: But this time we should send them, like, the media and stuff.

02:21:46.871 --> 02:21:49.794
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, let's go to the chat room, FUs, shall we?

02:21:51.688 --> 02:22:01.031
[SPEAKER_18]: VxJasonXV says, one simple FU, FU to having a job and not yet actually working, thus not having income.

02:22:02.872 --> 02:22:05.033
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Angel says, only one FU this week.

02:22:05.573 --> 02:22:11.115
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to say FU to one of my coworkers who thinks that he should control my schedule at work when he doesn't even have the authority to touch it.

02:22:11.615 --> 02:22:13.676
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm scheduled until 10, leave it at 10.

02:22:14.076 --> 02:22:17.057
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't stay a half hour even if you wanted me to, so get over it.

02:22:17.397 --> 02:22:19.178
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I'll be out of that hellhole soon.

02:22:19.258 --> 02:22:19.778
[SPEAKER_18]: That is all.

02:22:19.858 --> 02:22:20.278
[SPEAKER_18]: Goodbye.

02:22:21.121 --> 02:22:22.402
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, she's moving up here pretty soon.

02:22:22.422 --> 02:22:22.782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

02:22:23.382 --> 02:22:25.923
[SPEAKER_18]: She'll get out of the place she's in.

02:22:26.984 --> 02:22:29.085
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we'll hear more local FUs, anyway.

02:22:30.785 --> 02:22:39.729
[SPEAKER_18]: SharksGirl says, great, she says, FU to your work, my work, FU to Sky's work for making you go away so you miss our date.

02:22:40.450 --> 02:22:41.790
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't be able to put out for her.

02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:46.632
[SPEAKER_18]: I promised I would put out because she bought the tickets and everything, so.

02:22:46.732 --> 02:22:50.374
[SPEAKER_18]: She says she figures if nothing else, Mel's her default, but he just wouldn't appreciate it.

02:22:51.943 --> 02:22:54.685
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure Mel would accept the putting out, though, huh?

02:22:54.765 --> 02:22:55.726
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's raising her hand.

02:22:55.746 --> 02:22:57.067
[SPEAKER_18]: You should talk to Jamie.

02:22:59.449 --> 02:23:00.610
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't count me out yet, though.

02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:03.372
[SPEAKER_18]: The way my work works, I'll be... Just you wait.

02:23:03.592 --> 02:23:04.853
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't be gone until September.

02:23:06.514 --> 02:23:07.815
[SPEAKER_18]: Locke has two FUs.

02:23:08.555 --> 02:23:09.916
[SPEAKER_18]: One is a couple weeks old, and then the new one.

02:23:10.377 --> 02:23:13.499
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one is this girl named Lauren, who I thought everything was going well with.

02:23:13.539 --> 02:23:18.943
[SPEAKER_18]: After dating for a month, I got told that she was dating someone else by her best friend, and she wasn't going to even tell me.

02:23:20.404 --> 02:23:21.025
[SPEAKER_18]: So F you there.

02:23:21.045 --> 02:23:21.085
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

02:23:22.446 --> 02:23:23.287
[SPEAKER_18]: High school drama.

02:23:24.788 --> 02:23:26.109
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even think he's in high school, though.

02:23:26.129 --> 02:23:27.009
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he's older than that.

02:23:27.569 --> 02:23:28.030
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

02:23:28.050 --> 02:23:28.350
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

02:23:28.370 --> 02:23:29.491
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know the age of all our listeners.

02:23:29.591 --> 02:23:31.612
[SPEAKER_30]: It's drama.

02:23:32.553 --> 02:23:34.654
[SPEAKER_18]: We're in the old demographic here in studio.

02:23:34.694 --> 02:23:35.995
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the interesting part.

02:23:36.556 --> 02:23:41.439
[SPEAKER_18]: Locke also says, F you to people who cannot discuss politics without getting pissed off.

02:23:42.439 --> 02:23:48.924
[SPEAKER_18]: And also those who believe that you are not allowed to have an opinion yourself and unless you agree with them completely in politics, that they won't talk to you.

02:23:51.441 --> 02:23:53.142
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

02:23:53.162 --> 02:24:00.065
[SPEAKER_31]: Anything that anyone has a strong opinion about, they get all close-minded about.

02:24:01.105 --> 02:24:03.226
[SPEAKER_31]: Everyone has a right to an opinion, you know.

02:24:08.271 --> 02:24:13.833
[SPEAKER_18]: Flerone says, F you Dr. Atkins, if I hear low carb or Atkins friendly, I swear I will break my TV.

02:24:13.953 --> 02:24:21.016
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I bet half the people on Atkins who haven't read the books don't know that carb is short for carbohydrate or that fruits have them.

02:24:22.136 --> 02:24:25.597
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, I doubt many know that all the fucking heart problems Atkins had when he died.

02:24:27.178 --> 02:24:31.199
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, that was debatable because they said he also died from falling or something.

02:24:31.259 --> 02:24:33.480
[SPEAKER_31]: No, the Atkins diet gives you gout.

02:24:34.659 --> 02:24:36.240
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought you were going to say gas.

02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:37.180
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it gives you gas.

02:24:37.220 --> 02:24:39.101
[SPEAKER_18]: But eating all that meat would give you a lot of gas.

02:24:39.161 --> 02:24:46.284
[SPEAKER_31]: It also gives you bad breath and affects your hormones and will eventually give you cancer.

02:24:46.324 --> 02:24:48.665
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, I have the miracle diet for you guys.

02:24:48.725 --> 02:24:50.306
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to call it the Venata diet.

02:24:50.726 --> 02:24:52.427
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to put this on all the packaging.

02:24:52.707 --> 02:24:56.469
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to put this on all these packages, the Venata diet friendly thing.

02:24:58.130 --> 02:25:01.091
[SPEAKER_18]: Eat less, exercise more.

02:25:01.911 --> 02:25:02.472
[SPEAKER_29]: God.

02:25:07.096 --> 02:25:07.957
[SPEAKER_31]: It's worked for me.

02:25:07.977 --> 02:25:09.397
[SPEAKER_18]: It's hard work.

02:25:10.458 --> 02:25:12.419
[SPEAKER_18]: John Fields says, F you to my father.

02:25:13.379 --> 02:25:18.081
[SPEAKER_18]: And just so you know, when I say eat less, that doesn't mean you do the Mary-Kate Olsen thing and not eat at all.

02:25:18.481 --> 02:25:19.882
[SPEAKER_18]: You just eat less.

02:25:20.542 --> 02:25:23.824
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're eating a whole pie, eat half the pie.

02:25:25.625 --> 02:25:28.886
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of not eating, do crack, just like the Olsen twins.

02:25:29.046 --> 02:25:32.948
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's step two in Matt's great plan to get them naked.

02:25:33.775 --> 02:25:38.657
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it is, it is what you eat as much as how much of it you eat.

02:25:39.398 --> 02:25:42.299
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, just don't eat processed food.

02:25:42.859 --> 02:25:49.962
[SPEAKER_31]: Go cook a meal, you know, get some, some, you know, steak, cook it on your Foreman Grill.

02:25:50.623 --> 02:25:52.604
[SPEAKER_31]: Foreman Grill's awesome, you know.

02:25:53.644 --> 02:25:57.606
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a matter of just eating real food.

02:25:58.846 --> 02:26:00.067
[SPEAKER_31]: Look, I guarantee you.

02:26:01.556 --> 02:26:10.118
[SPEAKER_31]: I challenge everybody, okay, for one week, you know, go grocery shopping and try and don't buy anything that has high-fructose corn syrup in it.

02:26:10.858 --> 02:26:11.599
[SPEAKER_31]: Try doing it for a week.

02:26:12.039 --> 02:26:19.641
[SPEAKER_31]: I guarantee you, everything that you normally get, or most of everything that you get, has that as either a primary or at least a middle ingredient on it.

02:26:22.341 --> 02:26:22.841
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'm done.

02:26:23.142 --> 02:26:23.502
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all right.

02:26:23.702 --> 02:26:24.562
[SPEAKER_18]: Back to John Peel's FU.

02:26:24.582 --> 02:26:24.682
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

02:26:25.575 --> 02:26:31.178
[SPEAKER_18]: FU to my father, fuck having to get a job, fuck having to pay $500 for a tiny scratch on a bumper that happened in an accident.

02:26:31.218 --> 02:26:33.339
[SPEAKER_18]: My life worth is now down to only $1,000.

02:26:33.379 --> 02:26:37.161
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, that's more than I've got today.

02:26:38.401 --> 02:26:38.882
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

02:26:40.002 --> 02:26:47.406
[SPEAKER_18]: EvilMaliki2DX says, FU goes to idiot tourists on July 4th who thought that standing and blocking my view was going to give them a better view of the fireworks.

02:26:48.035 --> 02:26:51.278
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and F you to Fog for blocking out the fireworks in the first place.

02:26:51.798 --> 02:26:55.381
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you to idiot drivers trying to run me over on my way back to the BART station.

02:26:55.981 --> 02:26:58.864
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and F you to the idiot drunk driver that took Satoshi's life.

02:27:04.328 --> 02:27:11.951
[SPEAKER_18]: Spaceboy says, neighbor kids suck, they touch your drums, then you tell them not to, and then tell their soccer mom.

02:27:12.211 --> 02:27:14.493
[SPEAKER_18]: Then they come back and taunt you, then they get you in trouble.

02:27:15.453 --> 02:27:18.574
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to throw them off my house headfirst.

02:27:21.816 --> 02:27:27.739
[SPEAKER_18]: Misty says, this one goes to myself, because I lost my wallet and all the important shit that I was stupid enough to keep in there.

02:27:28.763 --> 02:27:31.686
[SPEAKER_18]: I only hope I can find it in the landfill that is my room.

02:27:32.326 --> 02:27:33.607
[SPEAKER_18]: I like how she calls it in the landfill.

02:27:34.128 --> 02:27:38.131
[SPEAKER_18]: And lastly, Mel B of RTF has an FU.

02:27:38.712 --> 02:27:42.055
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, FU to Richard Earl Sevitz.

02:27:42.655 --> 02:27:46.319
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks a whole freaking lot for taking the lives of a local DDR and his mom.

02:27:46.559 --> 02:27:48.801
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure drinking before taking the wheel was worth it.

02:27:49.361 --> 02:27:50.062
[SPEAKER_18]: You worthless fuck.

02:27:52.554 --> 02:27:53.555
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:28:22.796 --> 02:28:25.098
[SPEAKER_18]: We always have a backup plan for how we're all going to get home.

02:28:25.278 --> 02:28:26.599
[SPEAKER_18]: The fact that two of us live here helps.

02:28:27.599 --> 02:28:30.902
[SPEAKER_31]: I had you pick me up to bring me here and I had Dan take me home.

02:28:31.042 --> 02:28:31.482
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

02:28:31.782 --> 02:28:37.786
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you know, if only everybody could be smart, then we wouldn't have this bullshit happening.

02:28:38.027 --> 02:28:38.547
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what it is.

02:28:38.627 --> 02:28:39.147
[SPEAKER_18]: It's bullshit.

02:28:40.108 --> 02:28:40.548
[SPEAKER_18]: Shouldn't happen.

02:28:42.330 --> 02:28:43.450
[SPEAKER_14]: That is really sad.

02:28:43.530 --> 02:28:44.391
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't hear about that.

02:28:44.411 --> 02:28:46.432
[SPEAKER_31]: They just better nail this guy's ass to the wall.

02:28:46.673 --> 02:28:47.413
[SPEAKER_31]: That's all I have to say.

02:28:48.474 --> 02:28:50.755
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm almost positive he died too, but I'm not sure.

02:28:50.876 --> 02:28:51.336
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure.

02:28:54.861 --> 02:28:58.923
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want to get into some more Black Ops stuff, Maker of the Alcohol, Konami.

02:29:07.608 --> 02:29:17.954
[SPEAKER_31]: I just have this thing, though, about the drunk drivers who live, that I am sort of glad that they live for one reason, because dead people can't suffer.

02:29:18.594 --> 02:29:19.535
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't make them suffer.

02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:21.492
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a lot of guilt to have.

02:29:21.993 --> 02:29:24.676
[SPEAKER_31]: That's not even the guilt that I care about.

02:29:24.876 --> 02:29:28.199
[SPEAKER_31]: I care about sitting them down and making them suffer repeatedly.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.445
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think a lot of drunk drivers are necessarily bad people.

02:29:33.725 --> 02:29:35.367
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't matter.

02:29:35.987 --> 02:29:36.588
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I know, I know.

02:29:36.848 --> 02:29:37.369
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't matter.

02:29:37.749 --> 02:29:40.412
[SPEAKER_18]: They made a really horrible, bad...

02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.450
[SPEAKER_18]: Ignorant.

02:29:41.570 --> 02:29:42.671
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an ignorant decision.

02:29:42.691 --> 02:29:43.632
[SPEAKER_18]: They're ignorant people.

02:29:43.652 --> 02:29:47.034
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that they need to be punished for it for the rest of their life.

02:29:47.694 --> 02:30:01.823
[SPEAKER_31]: Whether they punish themselves or, you know, I think that if you are involved in a drunk driving accident and you were the drunk driver, you need to, for the rest of your life, have your driving privileges revoked.

02:30:03.004 --> 02:30:04.025
[SPEAKER_31]: For the rest of your life.

02:30:04.905 --> 02:30:08.107
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't care how goddamn inconvenient it makes it on you, you do not deserve to drive.

02:30:08.127 --> 02:30:08.868
[SPEAKER_18]: Take the bus!

02:30:09.468 --> 02:30:10.149
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what it's for!

02:30:11.448 --> 02:30:15.089
[SPEAKER_18]: More people should take the bus anyway, not that I should talk, because I drive, but you know.

02:30:18.131 --> 02:30:21.512
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I do have another... If I lived in a big city, I would take the subway.

02:30:21.732 --> 02:30:21.912
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes?

02:30:22.272 --> 02:30:23.833
[SPEAKER_31]: I actually do have another F you, by the way.

02:30:23.853 --> 02:30:24.974
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, DarkSakura?

02:30:25.814 --> 02:30:30.756
[SPEAKER_31]: I have an F you to the emissions commercials that they have on the radio here.

02:30:31.716 --> 02:30:38.379
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I normally listen to the radio, but I have a big F you to the emissions one, saying that, you know, drive your car less.

02:30:40.003 --> 02:30:44.026
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you know who the cause of the emissions problem is in this state?

02:30:44.446 --> 02:30:45.627
[SPEAKER_31]: It's freaking industry.

02:30:46.628 --> 02:30:53.153
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, car emissions are negligible in comparison to these unregulated factories that we have floating around.

02:30:53.753 --> 02:30:55.435
[SPEAKER_31]: So, you know what all that is?

02:30:56.576 --> 02:30:58.757
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my whole theory on how government works.

02:30:59.318 --> 02:30:59.598
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay?

02:30:59.618 --> 02:30:59.698
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:01.100
[SPEAKER_31]: It's money.

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:01.980
[SPEAKER_31]: It's lobbyists.

02:31:03.901 --> 02:31:05.522
[SPEAKER_31]: We are run by corporations.

02:31:06.202 --> 02:31:09.383
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's these corporations that control what legislature gets passed.

02:31:10.563 --> 02:31:11.364
[SPEAKER_31]: So, anyway.

02:31:12.264 --> 02:31:15.645
[SPEAKER_18]: We had one more FU come in to kind of try and bring the mood back up here a little bit.

02:31:16.365 --> 02:31:26.749
[SPEAKER_18]: DDArcoholic says, FU to Comcast for deleting our connection to Japan TV because it was a mistake and finding out that to get it back it costs $24 a month just for that one channel.

02:31:27.649 --> 02:31:29.290
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess that means we probably lost it too.

02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:29.930
[SPEAKER_18]: That makes me sad.

02:31:31.269 --> 02:31:32.750
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, but that still makes me sad.

02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:33.611
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a cool network.

02:31:34.652 --> 02:31:34.952
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh well.

02:31:36.113 --> 02:31:36.613
[SPEAKER_18]: What can you do?

02:31:36.993 --> 02:31:42.837
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that's the station that plays a lot of the current Dorama series that come on too.

02:31:42.857 --> 02:31:43.038
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

02:31:43.538 --> 02:31:44.238
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm almost positive it is.

02:31:44.258 --> 02:31:46.180
[SPEAKER_31]: I was watching one in Berkeley that was called Sakura.

02:31:48.982 --> 02:31:49.262
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh well.

02:31:50.343 --> 02:31:52.785
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.

02:31:53.585 --> 02:31:58.549
[SPEAKER_18]: When we come back, what we're going to do, we will do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:31:58.629 --> 02:32:00.030
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also want to show something off.

02:32:01.328 --> 02:32:07.292
[SPEAKER_18]: This computer upgrade has helped us be capable of doing something else here on the show that we will be incorporating in the show in the future.

02:32:08.152 --> 02:32:09.913
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're going to kind of try it out tonight.

02:32:10.434 --> 02:32:12.015
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to show it to you guys when we come back.

02:32:13.055 --> 02:32:13.856
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me for this break.

02:32:14.474 --> 02:32:15.115
[SPEAKER_18]: Ask Orange Lounge

02:36:36.243 --> 02:36:37.823
[SPEAKER_07]: Baby, it's all in gold

02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:48.332
[SPEAKER_27]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:38:54.673 --> 02:38:58.234
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:59.774 --> 02:39:02.255
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in just a moment.

02:39:02.810 --> 02:39:06.353
[SPEAKER_18]: But first I want to show off a new feature that we're going to have very soon on the show.

02:39:06.533 --> 02:39:11.216
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just trying to think of ways to implement this in a non-trainwreck sort of way.

02:39:11.717 --> 02:39:13.658
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yes, I hear a phone ringing.

02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:16.560
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:18.421
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Orange Lounge?

02:39:18.682 --> 02:39:19.002
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

02:39:19.662 --> 02:39:20.543
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have one question.

02:39:21.364 --> 02:39:21.664
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

02:39:22.324 --> 02:39:23.085
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me now?

02:39:23.585 --> 02:39:24.846
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I can hear you now.

02:39:24.966 --> 02:39:25.507
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is this?

02:39:26.207 --> 02:39:27.028
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Jason.

02:39:27.268 --> 02:39:29.850
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, is this TVX JasonXV?

02:39:30.697 --> 02:39:33.240
[SPEAKER_15]: You would be correct, sir.

02:39:35.222 --> 02:39:36.083
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, how you doing?

02:39:37.385 --> 02:39:38.606
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing pretty good.

02:39:38.787 --> 02:39:39.267
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.

02:39:39.327 --> 02:39:40.609
[SPEAKER_18]: This is exciting, isn't it?

02:39:41.290 --> 02:39:42.471
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we can talk to our listeners.

02:39:43.052 --> 02:39:44.313
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds nice and smooth to me.

02:39:44.413 --> 02:39:47.417
[SPEAKER_18]: Just so you know, this is not a regular phone connection, is it?

02:39:48.594 --> 02:39:50.476
[SPEAKER_15]: No, this is actually a digital connection.

02:39:50.636 --> 02:39:52.758
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, this is an all-digital secure connection.

02:39:52.798 --> 02:39:54.500
[SPEAKER_18]: We're using a program called Skype.

02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:56.641
[SPEAKER_18]: You can download it at Skype.org.

02:39:56.701 --> 02:39:57.742
[SPEAKER_18]: It's completely free.

02:39:57.762 --> 02:39:58.843
[SPEAKER_31]: You should spell it for everybody.

02:39:59.063 --> 02:40:00.625
[SPEAKER_18]: S-K-Y-P-E.

02:40:01.726 --> 02:40:05.229
[SPEAKER_18]: And when we get this running, which we will soon, you'll be able to call us.

02:40:05.669 --> 02:40:13.796
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have a broadband connection, unfortunately those of you with a modem connection, it's going to be too much for your connections, you're not going to be able to do it, but if you have a broadband connection, you will be able to interact with us.

02:40:13.936 --> 02:40:22.364
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're not sure in what capacity yet, we're probably going to have to control it somehow, but you will be able to call the show, and it'll be fun.

02:40:22.704 --> 02:40:24.666
[SPEAKER_18]: And Jamie can yell at you in person, which will be great.

02:40:25.246 --> 02:40:27.368
[SPEAKER_31]: And know your phone bill has nothing to do with this.

02:40:27.782 --> 02:40:30.204
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, this is not an actual phone line.

02:40:30.304 --> 02:40:34.687
[SPEAKER_31]: This is the same thing as sending an IM to somebody just verbally.

02:40:34.787 --> 02:40:35.607
[SPEAKER_18]: This is voice chat.

02:40:35.707 --> 02:40:36.888
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a voice chat program on that.

02:40:36.928 --> 02:40:38.049
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like Xbox Live.

02:40:39.270 --> 02:40:42.892
[SPEAKER_18]: Except there's not people on it going, you know, Bitch, bitch, bitch, your mom, your mom.

02:40:43.633 --> 02:40:44.913
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a controller cheater.

02:40:45.093 --> 02:40:46.054
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a controller cheater.

02:40:46.074 --> 02:40:46.594
[SPEAKER_15]: You're lame.

02:40:47.335 --> 02:40:51.057
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's going to be cool is when they come out with iToyChat.

02:40:52.258 --> 02:40:53.339
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still waiting for that.

02:40:53.951 --> 02:40:56.814
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming, it's coming, so soon enough we'll have that.

02:40:57.194 --> 02:40:59.576
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll be able to see your ugly mugs at the same time.

02:41:02.458 --> 02:41:04.660
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we'll definitely have to do something with iToyChat in the future.

02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:06.442
[SPEAKER_31]: Jason needs to come back out and hang out with us again.

02:41:08.123 --> 02:41:09.704
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an excellent... Hold on!

02:41:09.925 --> 02:41:10.465
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, stop!

02:41:10.585 --> 02:41:11.186
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop the show!

02:41:11.546 --> 02:41:12.567
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an excellent idea.

02:41:12.807 --> 02:41:15.850
[SPEAKER_14]: We could broadcast all of our shows over iToyChat.

02:41:17.251 --> 02:41:17.391
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

02:41:18.539 --> 02:41:19.199
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, come on.

02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:21.581
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's moderators on iToyChat.

02:41:21.601 --> 02:41:22.781
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd probably get banned.

02:41:24.442 --> 02:41:24.803
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

02:41:24.843 --> 02:41:25.583
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see when it comes out.

02:41:26.844 --> 02:41:27.064
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:41:27.084 --> 02:41:29.605
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thanks for calling, Jason, and helping us show off this new toy.

02:41:30.266 --> 02:41:30.506
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

02:41:30.526 --> 02:41:32.287
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you for filling in for the show last week.

02:41:32.307 --> 02:41:33.047
[SPEAKER_18]: That was very nice of you.

02:41:33.687 --> 02:41:35.628
[SPEAKER_15]: It was very fun once I actually got underway.

02:41:35.649 --> 02:41:36.609
[SPEAKER_18]: When are you going to do your own show?

02:41:37.650 --> 02:41:39.971
[SPEAKER_15]: As soon as I actually have a definitive schedule.

02:41:40.351 --> 02:41:40.871
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds good to me.

02:41:41.792 --> 02:41:41.992
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

02:41:42.272 --> 02:41:42.552
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:41:42.572 --> 02:41:43.293
[SPEAKER_18]: You have a good one, Jason.

02:41:43.313 --> 02:41:43.833
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for calling.

02:41:44.293 --> 02:41:44.894
[SPEAKER_15]: Goodbye, sir.

02:41:45.034 --> 02:41:45.254
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

02:41:45.514 --> 02:41:45.894
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

02:41:46.615 --> 02:41:46.895
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:41:46.915 --> 02:41:47.315
[SPEAKER_18]: That was fun.

02:41:48.305 --> 02:41:52.227
[SPEAKER_18]: That's going to be a fun program to start using when we figure out how to do it.

02:41:52.267 --> 02:41:54.308
[SPEAKER_18]: But get on board right now.

02:41:55.128 --> 02:41:57.609
[SPEAKER_18]: Skype.org.

02:41:58.169 --> 02:42:00.630
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, people are posting the link in the chat room.

02:42:01.531 --> 02:42:05.812
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get a user account made just for Orange Lounge and figure something out.

02:42:05.993 --> 02:42:07.093
[SPEAKER_18]: You did make one a while back, didn't you?

02:42:07.833 --> 02:42:08.153
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Amy.

02:42:08.594 --> 02:42:11.615
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to make a quick statement.

02:42:12.051 --> 02:42:13.932
[SPEAKER_31]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.849
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

02:42:39.869 --> 02:42:43.632
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.

02:42:43.652 --> 02:42:45.133
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to find my Ask Orange Lounge music.

02:42:45.594 --> 02:42:48.776
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that we can actually do the music on beat, I can't find the damn music.

02:42:49.337 --> 02:42:49.777
[SPEAKER_18]: It's horrible.

02:42:51.038 --> 02:42:51.418
[SPEAKER_18]: Found it.

02:42:51.518 --> 02:42:51.899
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

02:42:52.619 --> 02:42:58.244
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to answer some questions that were sent to us by you for any of our hosts.

02:42:58.284 --> 02:42:59.645
[SPEAKER_18]: You can ask us anything you want.

02:42:59.685 --> 02:43:00.245
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind?

02:43:00.265 --> 02:43:01.166
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you want us to talk about?

02:43:01.206 --> 02:43:01.646
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

02:43:07.911 --> 02:43:09.072
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

02:43:09.682 --> 02:43:10.762
[SPEAKER_18]: Some stupid question.

02:43:11.303 --> 02:43:14.544
[SPEAKER_18]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:43:15.364 --> 02:43:16.385
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what we'll learn.

02:43:16.825 --> 02:43:18.225
[SPEAKER_18]: The questions are probably pretty dumb.

02:43:18.706 --> 02:43:22.067
[SPEAKER_18]: But all I know is I feel great because now I can sing in sync.

02:43:25.608 --> 02:43:28.390
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounded profane.

02:43:29.170 --> 02:43:30.550
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one question!

02:43:31.651 --> 02:43:35.993
[SPEAKER_18]: EvilNauki2DX, when is the next time you'll be in San Francisco?

02:43:36.053 --> 02:43:37.933
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been over a year since I last seen you guys.

02:43:38.334 --> 02:43:39.274
[SPEAKER_31]: When do you pay for the trip?

02:43:41.326 --> 02:43:47.131
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I want to go to Dave & Buster's in Mopita, so I know it's not San Francisco, but I really want to go to DMV's again.

02:43:47.171 --> 02:43:47.811
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh my god, I want to.

02:43:48.332 --> 02:43:54.516
[SPEAKER_14]: A certain host has a certain birthday coming up with a certain power crash anniversary.

02:43:54.536 --> 02:43:57.038
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that's like six weeks away.

02:43:57.098 --> 02:43:57.739
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to go now.

02:43:58.099 --> 02:44:00.221
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to go when I get back from East Coast.

02:44:02.442 --> 02:44:04.884
[SPEAKER_31]: We should celebrate the return of Rob with booze.

02:44:04.904 --> 02:44:05.004
[SPEAKER_31]: Booze.

02:44:07.024 --> 02:44:10.187
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a going away party and a coming back party.

02:44:11.067 --> 02:44:15.851
[SPEAKER_31]: What was that game that you played with the really gay name?

02:44:17.071 --> 02:44:19.213
[SPEAKER_31]: It was right behind our table on my birthday.

02:44:20.094 --> 02:44:20.874
[SPEAKER_18]: Flaming Fingers.

02:44:20.954 --> 02:44:22.195
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, that was great.

02:44:23.116 --> 02:44:23.776
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on.

02:44:24.437 --> 02:44:25.557
[SPEAKER_31]: You should win on that again.

02:44:26.098 --> 02:44:31.061
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, Dave and Busters is having an I Love the 90s viewing party all this week, says Shark Skrull.

02:44:31.141 --> 02:44:31.822
[SPEAKER_31]: We need to go.

02:44:31.862 --> 02:44:32.462
[SPEAKER_18]: What a cool...

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:36.102
[SPEAKER_31]: Dead Air, fun.

02:44:36.202 --> 02:44:39.727
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just sending a private message to a buddy.

02:44:49.673 --> 02:44:52.295
[SPEAKER_18]: John Fields says, I know this really isn't Bimani.

02:44:52.395 --> 02:44:52.736
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

02:44:52.976 --> 02:44:53.937
[SPEAKER_18]: Number two question.

02:44:54.718 --> 02:44:59.682
[SPEAKER_18]: I know this isn't really Bimani related anyway, but did you see the end of season two of Red vs. Blue?

02:44:59.782 --> 02:45:01.263
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you did, what did you think of it?

02:45:01.464 --> 02:45:02.765
[SPEAKER_31]: I need to go watch those.

02:45:02.785 --> 02:45:05.427
[SPEAKER_31]: I haven't watched anything since the last season of Red vs. Blue.

02:45:07.849 --> 02:45:10.612
[SPEAKER_31]: Red vs. Blue is awesome.

02:45:10.632 --> 02:45:11.072
[SPEAKER_18]: What is it?

02:45:11.232 --> 02:45:11.893
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know.

02:45:12.213 --> 02:45:14.035
[SPEAKER_31]: It's these funny movies that they did.

02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:16.891
[SPEAKER_31]: Using the Halo engine.

02:45:17.731 --> 02:45:18.852
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I have heard of that.

02:45:19.032 --> 02:45:19.813
[SPEAKER_31]: They're great.

02:45:19.853 --> 02:45:20.993
[SPEAKER_31]: I've got the first DVD.

02:45:22.854 --> 02:45:23.034
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

02:45:23.054 --> 02:45:24.935
[SPEAKER_31]: So she can just download all of them off the internet.

02:45:24.955 --> 02:45:27.217
[SPEAKER_18]: Didn't Microsoft start actually paying them to do it?

02:45:27.297 --> 02:45:29.158
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, they thought it was awesome.

02:45:29.218 --> 02:45:29.978
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really cool.

02:45:30.018 --> 02:45:38.023
[SPEAKER_31]: If you go into GameStop, their Xbox demos, the little cut scenes in between are the red versus blue guys.

02:45:38.826 --> 02:45:39.286
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

02:45:39.827 --> 02:45:44.109
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should talk more good things about Xbox and they'll hire us to do, you know, something.

02:45:44.690 --> 02:45:46.571
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Ultramix is great.

02:45:46.611 --> 02:45:49.233
[SPEAKER_18]: You should go buy an Xbox today and play it.

02:45:49.273 --> 02:45:49.973
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so much fun.

02:45:50.033 --> 02:45:54.296
[SPEAKER_31]: I wish everybody listening could see the expression on your face.

02:45:55.777 --> 02:45:56.918
[SPEAKER_31]: You look constipated.

02:45:58.519 --> 02:45:58.959
[SPEAKER_31]: It's great.

02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:01.981
[SPEAKER_18]: Number three question.

02:46:04.110 --> 02:46:08.513
[SPEAKER_18]: Flairone wants to know, you guys always make a bunch of general comments about your work.

02:46:08.634 --> 02:46:10.595
[SPEAKER_18]: Where do you guys work exactly?

02:46:10.935 --> 02:46:11.756
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not telling.

02:46:11.996 --> 02:46:15.839
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not going to tell exactly where we work, but we can tell what kind of work we do.

02:46:16.279 --> 02:46:17.661
[SPEAKER_31]: I work for a student loan lender.

02:46:18.681 --> 02:46:20.022
[SPEAKER_31]: A very big student loan lender.

02:46:20.943 --> 02:46:25.006
[SPEAKER_18]: Owned by a very big bank.

02:46:25.907 --> 02:46:28.549
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a corporate trainer for a very large health insurance company.

02:46:30.378 --> 02:46:31.879
[SPEAKER_18]: Not very large, but somewhat big.

02:46:32.019 --> 02:46:34.100
[SPEAKER_31]: I work in customer service.

02:46:34.741 --> 02:46:36.482
[SPEAKER_18]: It's big in this state, but probably not where you live.

02:46:36.982 --> 02:46:37.462
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Loki.

02:46:37.802 --> 02:46:38.303
[SPEAKER_31]: Wait, one thing.

02:46:38.823 --> 02:46:39.023
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

02:46:39.403 --> 02:46:41.124
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I am that phone voice.

02:46:44.926 --> 02:46:47.688
[SPEAKER_14]: I sit and read the internet.

02:46:49.749 --> 02:46:50.649
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I do.

02:46:50.829 --> 02:46:51.830
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a jizz mopper.

02:46:52.530 --> 02:46:53.811
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not a jizz mopper.

02:46:54.011 --> 02:46:55.812
[SPEAKER_14]: I talk to stupid people.

02:46:56.596 --> 02:47:02.459
[SPEAKER_14]: Mostly stupid people in the Midwest because they're extraordinarily stupid.

02:47:02.979 --> 02:47:05.161
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially the people that work at video stores there.

02:47:06.261 --> 02:47:07.502
God, they're so stupid.

02:47:08.823 --> 02:47:09.863
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:47:12.685 --> 02:47:15.486
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, yeah, I work in the video industry.

02:47:16.487 --> 02:47:17.887
[SPEAKER_14]: The movie industry.

02:47:18.348 --> 02:47:19.288
[SPEAKER_14]: I get free movies.

02:47:20.449 --> 02:47:22.490
[SPEAKER_31]: To answer John Fields real quick.

02:47:22.670 --> 02:47:22.830
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

02:47:23.985 --> 02:47:28.187
[SPEAKER_31]: The federal government doesn't freaking care where you work.

02:47:29.107 --> 02:47:32.948
[SPEAKER_31]: You still have to fill out your FAFSA to get your student loans.

02:47:33.088 --> 02:47:35.749
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if you work for the IRS, you still have to pay your taxes every year.

02:47:35.969 --> 02:47:36.310
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

02:47:36.330 --> 02:47:36.750
[SPEAKER_31]: Believe it or not.

02:47:38.170 --> 02:47:38.891
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it, I know.

02:47:39.251 --> 02:47:47.554
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm going to be taking out my student loans through where I work because I'll, you know, not necessarily that I'll get a better deal on it, it's just I simply know how the processes are.

02:47:48.134 --> 02:47:49.975
[SPEAKER_18]: You can go in there and tweak your account.

02:47:50.035 --> 02:47:52.136
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I wouldn't do that.

02:47:52.356 --> 02:47:53.256
[SPEAKER_31]: But you still...

02:47:55.399 --> 02:48:03.406
[SPEAKER_31]: The FAFSA, if you've never done your own FAFSA, I recommend do it because it asks for all of this information.

02:48:03.907 --> 02:48:06.049
[SPEAKER_31]: It looks for the crap on your income taxes.

02:48:06.089 --> 02:48:07.450
[SPEAKER_31]: It doesn't give a shit where you work.

02:48:08.171 --> 02:48:09.492
[SPEAKER_31]: It just asks how much money you made.

02:48:12.355 --> 02:48:12.855
[SPEAKER_31]: And that is all.

02:48:13.747 --> 02:48:27.891
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright Next question Next question Number four question Also from Flareon A Also, with that one promo where if you don't listen to Orange Lounge too often you get killed by an assassin through the computer Does it say seven days at the end?

02:48:27.971 --> 02:48:32.213
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it does Yes If so, is that in reference to the crappy UPN series from years ago?

02:48:32.333 --> 02:48:36.814
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it's The Ring Yeah, you need to rent The Ring Oh my god, you haven't seen that?

02:48:36.854 --> 02:48:42.676
[SPEAKER_31]: That movie is so awesome I didn't see it until it came out on video Have you seen the Japanese one?

02:48:43.894 --> 02:48:44.735
[SPEAKER_18]: I've not seen Ringu.

02:48:44.775 --> 02:48:45.675
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard it's not as good.

02:48:46.316 --> 02:48:48.418
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, no, it's a different type of movie.

02:48:48.978 --> 02:48:49.438
[SPEAKER_31]: The U.S.

02:48:49.538 --> 02:48:51.140
[SPEAKER_31]: one is more for scare.

02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:53.722
[SPEAKER_31]: The Japanese one is more suspense.

02:48:55.483 --> 02:48:58.546
[SPEAKER_31]: And it also brings in this whole stupid psychic thing with it.

02:48:59.146 --> 02:49:00.347
[SPEAKER_31]: But the book is really good.

02:49:00.647 --> 02:49:01.468
[SPEAKER_31]: The book is really good.

02:49:02.329 --> 02:49:02.589
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway.

02:49:04.210 --> 02:49:06.912
[SPEAKER_31]: I had this whole big fandom for The Ring going on for a while.

02:49:08.153 --> 02:49:08.413
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:49:11.216 --> 02:49:11.896
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

02:49:11.996 --> 02:49:12.677
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

02:49:13.936 --> 02:49:14.957
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn, I thought that was a question.

02:49:15.357 --> 02:49:15.737
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, here we go.

02:49:15.777 --> 02:49:18.119
[SPEAKER_18]: Number five question from Jason.

02:49:18.879 --> 02:49:21.441
[SPEAKER_18]: Which new consumer style do you want to see first?

02:49:22.582 --> 02:49:30.347
[SPEAKER_18]: Gita Dora 5 and 4, Poppin' 10, 2DX8, or a new DDR?

02:49:31.828 --> 02:49:32.888
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd have to say in order.

02:49:33.629 --> 02:49:40.213
[SPEAKER_31]: I really want 2DX8, and then Gita Dora 5-4, and then Poppin'.

02:49:41.263 --> 02:49:50.986
[SPEAKER_31]: Just because I, you know, well, I didn't buy Poppin' 9, which I probably should have, but Dan has just been going off wanting new Guitar Freaks Drum Mania.

02:49:51.486 --> 02:49:57.928
[SPEAKER_31]: And I have two Guitar Freaks controllers and a Drum Mania controller collecting dust in my house.

02:49:59.689 --> 02:50:07.511
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually put a new DDR at the top of my list, and then I would say 2DX8, Poppin' 10, Guitador 5-4.

02:50:07.611 --> 02:50:09.992
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really collect the Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania at home.

02:50:10.032 --> 02:50:11.052
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's good for other people

02:50:11.522 --> 02:50:12.623
[SPEAKER_18]: I really want them all to come out.

02:50:13.263 --> 02:50:13.824
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see.

02:50:13.884 --> 02:50:14.945
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want a new DDR.

02:50:15.005 --> 02:50:16.366
[SPEAKER_31]: I want a new Keyboard Mania.

02:50:19.048 --> 02:50:19.809
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what I want.

02:50:20.289 --> 02:50:21.350
[SPEAKER_31]: And another Pada Pada.

02:50:25.533 --> 02:50:25.813
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:50:27.014 --> 02:50:27.275
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

02:50:27.295 --> 02:50:29.196
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to get set up on something here.

02:50:29.796 --> 02:50:30.677
[SPEAKER_18]: Puppy has a question.

02:50:30.697 --> 02:50:31.438
[SPEAKER_18]: Number six question.

02:50:32.833 --> 02:50:36.455
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you believe that my little brother got a job working at a TapX in my hometown?

02:50:36.575 --> 02:50:37.116
[SPEAKER_18]: Because he did.

02:50:37.376 --> 02:50:39.237
[SPEAKER_18]: Those things are starting to pop up everywhere.

02:50:39.437 --> 02:50:40.358
[SPEAKER_31]: They seriously are.

02:50:40.518 --> 02:50:42.299
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish one would open up near here.

02:50:43.460 --> 02:50:47.843
[SPEAKER_31]: I went to the TapX down off of Sutterville.

02:50:48.904 --> 02:50:50.405
[SPEAKER_31]: And they are really nice.

02:50:50.445 --> 02:50:53.206
[SPEAKER_31]: They have a big widescreen TV and they let you change the channels on it.

02:50:54.267 --> 02:50:56.449
[SPEAKER_31]: And then they have a PlayStation hooked up to it.

02:50:57.049 --> 02:50:58.050
[SPEAKER_31]: A PS2 hooked up to it.

02:50:58.090 --> 02:50:59.410
[SPEAKER_31]: So you can play whatever games they have there.

02:50:59.651 --> 02:51:00.491
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually saw that.

02:51:00.571 --> 02:51:01.472
[SPEAKER_18]: They have iToy Groove.

02:51:02.316 --> 02:51:08.098
[SPEAKER_31]: and if you pay $5 a month, you can use their broadband service.

02:51:08.979 --> 02:51:09.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's cool.

02:51:09.339 --> 02:51:10.179
[SPEAKER_31]: They'll give you broadband.

02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:12.980
[SPEAKER_31]: Wireless broadband, too, if you have a laptop.

02:51:14.381 --> 02:51:14.761
[SPEAKER_31]: Pretty good, huh?

02:51:14.801 --> 02:51:15.901
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

02:51:17.502 --> 02:51:17.902
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:51:20.623 --> 02:51:22.644
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I think we'll go ahead and we'll try and do this.

02:51:33.308 --> 02:51:34.869
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry about that guys, we dropped for just a second there.

02:51:34.889 --> 02:51:36.870
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't drop, but our sound went out for a second there.

02:51:36.890 --> 02:51:38.492
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I'm actually trying to set Skype back up.

02:51:39.052 --> 02:51:41.834
[SPEAKER_18]: If you guys want to contact us on Skype, we'll open up the Skype lines.

02:51:41.854 --> 02:51:43.355
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll take one call before the end of the show.

02:51:43.655 --> 02:51:45.376
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything you want to talk about in regards to tonight's show.

02:51:45.917 --> 02:51:48.218
[SPEAKER_18]: Username, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:51:48.358 --> 02:51:51.160
[SPEAKER_18]: All one word, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:51:52.861 --> 02:51:59.085
[SPEAKER_31]: And by the way, in answer to John Fields, it is $5 a month to use the broadband at their TapX.

02:52:01.069 --> 02:52:05.030
[SPEAKER_18]: We did get another question real fast while we wait for a call to come through on the skyline.

02:52:05.591 --> 02:52:08.332
[SPEAKER_18]: Black Lab wants to know, what is favorite Pokemon of you?

02:52:11.113 --> 02:52:11.953
[SPEAKER_31]: Number seven question.

02:52:13.534 --> 02:52:15.494
[SPEAKER_31]: I used to like Togepi a whole lot.

02:52:18.115 --> 02:52:20.876
[SPEAKER_31]: But I liked Porygon because it made all the children have seizures.

02:52:23.137 --> 02:52:24.538
[SPEAKER_18]: Jigglypuff was my favorite.

02:52:25.078 --> 02:52:25.618
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

02:52:29.560 --> 02:52:29.700
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

02:52:30.888 --> 02:52:37.893
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, uh... My favorite would have to be... Heart Attack Squirrel.

02:52:41.975 --> 02:52:46.999
[SPEAKER_31]: I liked in Evangelion Redeath how they had the giant, real, geek Pikachu battle.

02:52:47.579 --> 02:52:48.820
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Fanboy Bebop.

02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:49.480
[SPEAKER_14]: Penis!

02:52:51.422 --> 02:52:57.426
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a fan animation that somebody did that instead of Pikachu was Fuckachu.

02:52:59.367 --> 02:52:59.467
[SPEAKER_31]: And...

02:53:01.543 --> 02:53:03.504
[SPEAKER_31]: It's actually about the human Pokemon, though.

02:53:03.564 --> 02:53:05.645
[SPEAKER_31]: But I have to get it from my friend and show it to you.

02:53:05.685 --> 02:53:06.205
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really funny.

02:53:06.945 --> 02:53:11.007
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to see ReDeath and Fanboy Bebop again.

02:53:11.327 --> 02:53:12.748
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to get a copy of Nescaflowne.

02:53:13.008 --> 02:53:16.429
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't understand why these movies have not made their way onto the internet.

02:53:16.549 --> 02:53:17.729
[SPEAKER_31]: Nescaflowne, yes.

02:53:17.809 --> 02:53:18.570
[SPEAKER_14]: Nescaflowne.

02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:20.370
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I've got Fanboy Bebop.

02:53:21.151 --> 02:53:21.531
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

02:53:21.951 --> 02:53:23.692
[SPEAKER_31]: That movie is awesome.

02:53:24.792 --> 02:53:26.893
[SPEAKER_31]: I also have the cutscenes from Fanboy Bebop, too.

02:53:27.673 --> 02:53:29.254
[SPEAKER_31]: With the It's Gendo scene.

02:53:30.701 --> 02:53:31.461
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't they play those?

02:53:31.502 --> 02:53:34.043
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought they played those at the very end, like after the credits.

02:53:34.423 --> 02:53:34.843
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

02:53:35.844 --> 02:53:38.465
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll have to find my tape.

02:53:38.485 --> 02:53:42.947
[SPEAKER_31]: And I did have Jubei Powers, Japanese Man of Intercourse.

02:53:43.467 --> 02:53:44.347
[SPEAKER_14]: I hated that.

02:53:45.288 --> 02:53:46.448
[SPEAKER_31]: It had funny scenes.

02:53:46.548 --> 02:53:48.569
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to make a Gendo movie.

02:53:49.470 --> 02:53:51.731
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Gendo the movie.

02:53:52.431 --> 02:53:54.092
[SPEAKER_31]: Did you hear what I snuck in on the pre-show?

02:53:54.112 --> 02:53:54.152
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

02:53:55.094 --> 02:53:55.975
[SPEAKER_31]: The Misato.

02:53:56.715 --> 02:53:58.176
[SPEAKER_31]: I have two bestestes.

02:53:58.896 --> 02:54:00.917
[SPEAKER_14]: Not one, but two.

02:54:01.317 --> 02:54:09.302
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear they changed the dialogue in that because I thought there was one that was like a part that said shut up Shinzi and then they changed it to no.

02:54:11.643 --> 02:54:14.804
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it looks like that as far as I've seen it because I saw it at Faname when they played it.

02:54:16.785 --> 02:54:17.046
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh well.

02:54:18.326 --> 02:54:19.567
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody likes us, oh well.

02:54:21.032 --> 02:54:27.115
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think enough people have gotten Skype yet because we just said it like 10 minutes ago we're going to be using this and I don't think a lot of people even have this program yet.

02:54:27.135 --> 02:54:28.435
[SPEAKER_31]: I have another parody you might like.

02:54:28.655 --> 02:54:29.616
[SPEAKER_18]: But we'll see what happens, huh?

02:54:30.116 --> 02:54:31.577
[SPEAKER_31]: Voltron hellbent for leather.

02:54:33.438 --> 02:54:33.838
[SPEAKER_31]: What?

02:54:36.379 --> 02:54:38.920
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really old but I'll have to copy it for you.

02:54:41.441 --> 02:54:42.982
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys are crazy.

02:54:46.966 --> 02:54:50.547
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we got some people saying they're going to call in, they're trying to install the program now.

02:54:50.587 --> 02:54:57.229
[SPEAKER_18]: We've only got time to take like one or two calls, so if you don't get through this week, definitely we can do... Do we have any more waiting for us via private message?

02:54:57.269 --> 02:55:00.591
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have any other questions waiting private message, so I'm just kind of... I have a message.

02:55:00.951 --> 02:55:01.171
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

02:55:01.471 --> 02:55:02.891
[SPEAKER_31]: Why are we so damn cool?

02:55:05.772 --> 02:55:07.333
[SPEAKER_18]: Haven't you missed doing the show, though?

02:55:09.013 --> 02:55:12.335
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, I've missed... No, finally, we're getting a damn call.

02:55:12.355 --> 02:55:13.355
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, I don't even know...

02:55:21.892 --> 02:55:23.513
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know how to answer the damn call.

02:55:23.574 --> 02:55:24.634
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not coming up on the screen.

02:55:25.375 --> 02:55:27.376
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I just hung up on whoever was calling.

02:55:27.857 --> 02:55:28.577
[SPEAKER_30]: We're sorry.

02:55:28.837 --> 02:55:35.522
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to actually change something here on my options real fast because it's trying to... Holy crap, it's Zaku.

02:55:37.023 --> 02:55:43.388
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to have it not switch... No, I'm trying to make sure it doesn't switch...

02:55:44.636 --> 02:55:54.082
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'm actually going to disable calls for a second because I don't want people to call just yet because what it's doing, it's switching our input, which is fucking up our thing going out.

02:55:54.282 --> 02:55:55.263
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'll fix it.

02:55:55.783 --> 02:55:56.503
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, guys.

02:55:56.704 --> 02:55:58.525
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, help me fill time.

02:55:59.906 --> 02:56:00.646
[SPEAKER_31]: Fill time.

02:56:00.846 --> 02:56:03.248
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I could rant.

02:56:04.108 --> 02:56:04.188
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure.

02:56:04.208 --> 02:56:05.389
[SPEAKER_31]: Or we could listen to the ferrets.

02:56:08.746 --> 02:56:09.666
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I got it fixed.

02:56:09.686 --> 02:56:10.447
[SPEAKER_18]: We can take a call now.

02:56:10.527 --> 02:56:12.067
[SPEAKER_31]: I knew the ferret would get you motivated.

02:56:12.087 --> 02:56:15.828
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason, the last person that called, I did not get the answer button when you called.

02:56:15.928 --> 02:56:18.109
[SPEAKER_18]: So make sure we're on your buddy list, I guess.

02:56:18.609 --> 02:56:19.409
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe, I don't know.

02:56:21.970 --> 02:56:22.730
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, maybe you did.

02:56:23.551 --> 02:56:24.211
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if I can do it.

02:56:25.411 --> 02:56:26.452
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're getting a call now.

02:56:27.972 --> 02:56:28.712
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't answer it.

02:56:30.713 --> 02:56:31.573
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not letting me answer it.

02:56:34.534 --> 02:56:36.255
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let me see if I can change it from friends only.

02:56:36.595 --> 02:56:36.935
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.

02:56:37.659 --> 02:56:38.539
[SPEAKER_18]: There, I got it.

02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:38.960
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

02:56:41.241 --> 02:56:41.621
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

02:56:42.061 --> 02:56:42.822
[SPEAKER_18]: You're on Orange Lounge?

02:56:43.622 --> 02:56:43.942
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

02:56:44.163 --> 02:56:44.663
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is this?

02:56:45.743 --> 02:56:47.144
[SPEAKER_09]: It's EvilNaoki2DX.

02:56:47.344 --> 02:56:48.785
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, EvilNaoki2DX!

02:56:48.985 --> 02:56:50.186
[SPEAKER_09]: Naoki, whatever.

02:56:50.566 --> 02:56:51.086
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

02:56:51.727 --> 02:56:52.267
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm alright.

02:56:52.287 --> 02:56:53.968
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my Ototo-chan.

02:56:54.908 --> 02:56:55.829
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Onitan.

02:56:56.449 --> 02:56:56.969
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.730
[SPEAKER_09]: Eh.

02:57:00.291 --> 02:57:01.132
[SPEAKER_31]: How am I ever?

02:57:03.333 --> 02:57:07.195
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything you wanted to say about tonight's show or a comment on anything we've talked about tonight?

02:57:07.745 --> 02:57:10.047
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, you guys got the Skype thing up.

02:57:10.747 --> 02:57:16.051
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell by my Winamp, it's kind of lagging behind, so it's starting to confuse me, so I put it on mute real quick.

02:57:16.131 --> 02:57:17.232
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you're going to have to do that.

02:57:17.452 --> 02:57:25.398
[SPEAKER_18]: Folks, when you do call in to the station, make sure you put your Winamp down, because there is about a 30-second delay between us talking to you and then, just like real radio.

02:57:26.859 --> 02:57:27.760
[SPEAKER_18]: Except we don't dump the F1.

02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:29.541
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello to DarklineXDI as well.

02:57:29.561 --> 02:57:32.964
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say, well, what's up, and...

02:57:34.164 --> 02:57:39.545
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully I will come up to Sacramento one day soon and actually be on the show live.

02:57:40.345 --> 02:57:41.925
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitely, you've got to come be on the show live sometime.

02:57:42.626 --> 02:57:43.806
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes, definitely.

02:57:44.066 --> 02:57:44.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Any shoutouts?

02:57:45.086 --> 02:57:48.567
[SPEAKER_18]: Any TRL style Carson Daly blessed shoutouts you want to give?

02:57:50.047 --> 02:57:57.908
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to Angel and DarkLineXPI and anyone else who wants a shoutout, here's my shoutout.

02:57:58.968 --> 02:57:59.769
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very kind of you.

02:58:00.449 --> 02:58:01.649
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and Rob?

02:58:01.669 --> 02:58:01.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?

02:58:01.929 --> 02:58:02.149
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:58:02.904 --> 02:58:06.427
[SPEAKER_09]: When are you coming to my house in a French maid outfit?

02:58:06.687 --> 02:58:09.650
[SPEAKER_09]: You promised me back at Replicon.

02:58:09.790 --> 02:58:13.974
[SPEAKER_18]: When I can afford a French maid outfit, I will come in my French maid outfit.

02:58:14.694 --> 02:58:15.515
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're so kind.

02:58:15.735 --> 02:58:15.995
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

02:58:16.136 --> 02:58:18.398
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I'm going to let you go so we can take one more call before we leave.

02:58:18.418 --> 02:58:18.658
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:58:18.858 --> 02:58:19.378
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, bud.

02:58:19.398 --> 02:58:20.059
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, see you guys later.

02:58:20.179 --> 02:58:20.620
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, bye.

02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:26.204
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, if anybody else wants to call in, any comment on any of tonight's topics, Skype line is open for you guys.

02:58:26.284 --> 02:58:27.886
[SPEAKER_18]: Username, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:31.342
[SPEAKER_18]: SKYPE.org is the program you've got to get.

02:58:31.382 --> 02:58:34.624
[SPEAKER_18]: Brand new thing we're rolling out tonight, the Skype line.

02:58:34.724 --> 02:58:36.585
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll wait and see if anybody else wants to give us a call.

02:58:36.605 --> 02:58:38.246
[SPEAKER_31]: That just sounds cool, the Skype line.

02:58:38.366 --> 02:58:38.666
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

02:58:39.406 --> 02:58:42.829
[SPEAKER_31]: It should be like 1-900-HOT-SKYPE.

02:58:43.869 --> 02:58:44.470
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's very smart.

02:58:44.490 --> 02:58:49.032
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what's kind of neat about this is supposedly we can dial out too using this thing.

02:58:49.072 --> 02:58:50.613
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't know how well that works.

02:58:51.314 --> 02:58:53.155
[SPEAKER_18]: We could try calling my cell phone and see what happens.

02:58:55.296 --> 02:58:56.037
[SPEAKER_18]: We're getting a call.

02:58:56.057 --> 02:58:56.337
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on.

02:58:58.004 --> 02:58:58.885
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:59.926 --> 02:59:01.848
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, it's me, DarkLineXPI.

02:59:01.908 --> 02:59:02.629
[SPEAKER_18]: Turn down your wind amp.

02:59:04.250 --> 02:59:05.071
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, hold on.

02:59:05.311 --> 02:59:05.732
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

02:59:08.835 --> 02:59:09.836
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, it's down now.

02:59:09.956 --> 02:59:10.316
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:59:10.837 --> 02:59:13.019
[SPEAKER_18]: You sound like you're calling us from a glass jar.

02:59:14.721 --> 02:59:18.945
[SPEAKER_31]: He's hanging out with the tin can lady from Solo.

02:59:19.966 --> 02:59:20.927
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess it's just my mic.

02:59:21.934 --> 02:59:22.454
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all good.

02:59:22.954 --> 02:59:25.395
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys will have plenty of time to play around with settings.

02:59:25.815 --> 02:59:26.156
[SPEAKER_18]: What's up?

02:59:26.196 --> 02:59:26.776
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind?

02:59:26.796 --> 02:59:27.756
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of tonight's show?

02:59:27.796 --> 02:59:28.697
[SPEAKER_18]: Any comments on anything?

02:59:28.717 --> 02:59:30.077
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it's really good, actually.

02:59:31.177 --> 02:59:31.998
[SPEAKER_18]: When aren't we good?

02:59:32.078 --> 02:59:32.758
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn, we're good.

02:59:32.978 --> 02:59:33.978
[SPEAKER_28]: We are so hot.

02:59:34.699 --> 02:59:37.640
[SPEAKER_18]: We could do TRL on Originals Radio.

02:59:38.260 --> 02:59:38.700
[SPEAKER_14]: Indeed.

02:59:39.460 --> 02:59:41.121
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if we would want to, but we could.

02:59:42.642 --> 02:59:44.962
[SPEAKER_31]: What's better than real radio?

02:59:45.943 --> 02:59:47.563
[SPEAKER_18]: How can I get multiple calls there?

02:59:47.583 --> 02:59:48.064
[SPEAKER_18]: That was weird.

02:59:49.815 --> 02:59:54.678
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to have to play with the settings myself on this, and everything's still in beta, so we'll figure it out.

02:59:54.738 --> 02:59:55.599
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else you wanted to say?

02:59:55.639 --> 02:59:56.239
[SPEAKER_18]: Any shout-outs?

02:59:57.200 --> 03:00:03.885
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I would like to make a shout-out to Rich, EvilNaoki2DX, and all of the 2DX community here in Vegas.

03:00:05.346 --> 03:00:05.866
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Vegas!

03:00:05.926 --> 03:00:07.267
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got to go back to Vegas someday.

03:00:07.607 --> 03:00:09.389
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, when are you coming to Vegas?

03:00:09.569 --> 03:00:10.429
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss gambling.

03:00:10.649 --> 03:00:11.970
[SPEAKER_30]: We need to see Mara and Chun.

03:00:12.291 --> 03:00:14.492
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, there's a lot of folks that listen to Vegas.

03:00:14.532 --> 03:00:15.373
[SPEAKER_18]: When are you guys coming to Vegas?

03:00:15.393 --> 03:00:17.514
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to go to the Adult Entertainment Expo.

03:00:18.095 --> 03:00:18.515
[SPEAKER_31]: Ha ha ha!

03:00:19.537 --> 03:00:21.838
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'll be down there for Adult Entertainment Expo sometime.

03:00:22.239 --> 03:00:25.941
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, but we won't be there for Classic Gaming Expo because they moved that to San Jose.

03:00:26.821 --> 03:00:28.882
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, oh, I definitely want to go to Classic Gaming Expo this year.

03:00:28.942 --> 03:00:29.303
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

03:00:29.383 --> 03:00:29.683
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

03:00:30.023 --> 03:00:31.204
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're going to have to let you go.

03:00:31.264 --> 03:00:32.044
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what, though?

03:00:32.204 --> 03:00:37.267
[SPEAKER_18]: I just realized that you sent me that story about the American Idol style thing they're doing.

03:00:37.627 --> 03:00:38.708
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah, I sent you that.

03:00:38.788 --> 03:00:40.449
[SPEAKER_18]: And I totally forgot to bring it up tonight.

03:00:40.489 --> 03:00:42.110
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll send it to Jamie to talk about next week.

03:00:42.190 --> 03:00:43.331
[SPEAKER_28]: By the way, it's already gone.

03:00:44.111 --> 03:00:44.571
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, is it?

03:00:45.472 --> 03:00:45.712
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

03:00:45.872 --> 03:00:47.073
[SPEAKER_18]: Well... They don't have the links.

03:00:47.373 --> 03:00:47.893
[SPEAKER_18]: That sucks.

03:00:48.153 --> 03:00:49.214
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well, it was worth a try.

03:00:51.189 --> 03:00:52.291
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, thanks for calling in, dude.

03:00:52.812 --> 03:00:53.794
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, my pleasure.

03:00:54.255 --> 03:00:54.635
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye.

03:00:54.776 --> 03:00:55.076
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

03:00:55.798 --> 03:00:57.380
[SPEAKER_18]: See, this is pretty cool now that we can take calls.

03:00:57.841 --> 03:00:58.402
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm liking this.

03:00:59.785 --> 03:01:00.927
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's it.

03:01:00.967 --> 03:01:02.951
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have to go ahead and close the Skype line for tonight.

03:01:05.236 --> 03:01:06.336
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still trying to implement this.

03:01:06.356 --> 03:01:06.896
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm doing DarkSakura email.

03:01:33.712 --> 03:01:34.172
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll see what happens.

03:01:34.212 --> 03:01:35.193
[SPEAKER_31]: Just wanted to make a mention.

03:02:00.106 --> 03:02:01.927
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I guess that's it.

03:02:02.567 --> 03:02:03.007
[SPEAKER_18]: We're done.

03:02:03.927 --> 03:02:04.948
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, final thoughts.

03:02:05.188 --> 03:02:06.088
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, your final thought.

03:02:11.550 --> 03:02:14.090
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is Skype line.

03:02:14.731 --> 03:02:16.791
[SPEAKER_30]: That sounds so hot, Rob.

03:02:17.812 --> 03:02:18.612
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki's not here.

03:02:18.712 --> 03:02:20.192
[SPEAKER_30]: Loki's final thought is potty.

03:02:20.412 --> 03:02:22.573
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Loki's final thought is potty.

03:02:23.633 --> 03:02:26.694
[SPEAKER_18]: And the final word of the show, I guess I'll have to give it to Jamie.

03:02:26.714 --> 03:02:27.775
[SPEAKER_18]: There's really no one else here.

03:02:32.153 --> 03:02:35.134
[SPEAKER_21]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:35.694 --> 03:02:39.036
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

03:02:39.656 --> 03:02:44.938
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

03:02:45.118 --> 03:02:51.581

03:02:52.141 --> 03:02:55.623
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:02:58.144 --> 03:03:01.065
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, today's Ebonics Language Lesson.

03:03:01.972 --> 03:03:02.713
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting girls.

03:03:03.493 --> 03:03:05.394
[SPEAKER_00]: My, you're a lovely young lady.

03:03:06.115 --> 03:03:07.776
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn, you's a fine mother******.

03:03:08.756 --> 03:03:10.798
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, you's a fine mother******.

03:03:12.179 --> 03:03:13.820
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for a ride, shall we?

03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:17.222
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, baby, jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.

03:03:17.882 --> 03:03:21.885
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, baby, let's jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.

03:03:22.946 --> 03:03:23.826
[SPEAKER_00]: You are beautiful.

03:03:24.286 --> 03:03:25.627
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to make love to you.

03:03:26.348 --> 03:03:28.289
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn, bitch, you stupid fly.

03:03:28.749 --> 03:03:31.171
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me pull up to that bumper and smack that monkey.

03:03:31.809 --> 03:03:33.711
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn bitch, you stupid fly.

03:03:34.111 --> 03:03:36.673
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pull up to your bumper and smack that monkey.

03:03:37.554 --> 03:03:38.675
[SPEAKER_00]: Greeting old friends.

03:03:39.435 --> 03:03:40.036
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, sir.

03:03:40.737 --> 03:03:42.098
[SPEAKER_05]: What up, dog?

03:03:42.918 --> 03:03:44.440
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, dog?

03:03:45.681 --> 03:03:46.982
[SPEAKER_00]: May I borrow some money?

03:03:47.642 --> 03:03:48.943
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, let me hold some ends.

03:03:49.024 --> 03:03:50.785
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll hit you back on the first, my brother.

03:03:51.325 --> 03:03:52.747
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let me hold some ends.

03:03:52.947 --> 03:03:55.249
[SPEAKER_00]: I will hit you back on the first, my brother.

03:03:56.570 --> 03:03:57.250
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have it?

03:03:57.691 --> 03:03:58.471
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks anyway.

03:03:59.312 --> 03:04:00.053
[SPEAKER_12]: F*** you!

03:04:02.844 --> 03:04:03.845
[SPEAKER_00]: Making new friends.

03:04:04.466 --> 03:04:05.086
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, sir.

03:04:05.707 --> 03:04:06.227
[SPEAKER_12]: What up?

03:04:06.928 --> 03:04:07.388
[SPEAKER_00]: What up?

03:04:08.749 --> 03:04:11.191
[SPEAKER_00]: I admire your fashionable running shoes.

03:04:11.812 --> 03:04:15.254
[SPEAKER_12]: Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherfucker.

03:04:15.875 --> 03:04:19.918
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherfucker.

03:04:20.819 --> 03:04:23.381
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a stuck-up white boy faking the funk.

03:04:23.821 --> 03:04:24.442
[SPEAKER_00]: Bump that.

03:04:25.082 --> 03:04:30.887
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't bullshitting on Front Street no more thanks to the Wake Up Crew's Ebonics language lesson.

03:04:32.236 --> 03:04:40.582
[SPEAKER_21]: Available in a hood near you Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:05:16.874 --> 03:05:17.735
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we're back.

03:05:17.835 --> 03:05:19.715
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.

03:05:19.775 --> 03:05:20.176
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is.

03:05:20.216 --> 03:05:22.776
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the part after the credits have come and gone.

03:05:22.797 --> 03:05:24.737
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.

03:05:24.757 --> 03:05:26.598
[SPEAKER_18]: Some more of you guys want to play on that for a minute.

03:05:26.658 --> 03:05:28.379
[SPEAKER_31]: Damn, bitch, you stupid cat.

03:05:28.399 --> 03:05:30.499
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a great fortune cookie message.

03:05:30.699 --> 03:05:33.861
[SPEAKER_31]: Dan had that a long time ago, and I finally bothered to get it.

03:05:34.001 --> 03:05:35.381
[SPEAKER_31]: I played it on my show once.

03:05:36.682 --> 03:05:37.082
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.

03:05:37.302 --> 03:05:37.662
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.

03:05:39.329 --> 03:05:40.370
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we set up voicemail on it?

03:05:40.410 --> 03:05:40.890
[SPEAKER_18]: Possibly.

03:05:41.130 --> 03:05:45.552
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would be cool if we could, because then we'd just leave it up all day and people could send us their FUs with voice.

03:05:48.734 --> 03:05:49.034
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

03:05:49.094 --> 03:05:50.935
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe that's something they're going to do in a little bit.

03:05:50.955 --> 03:05:51.255
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

03:05:54.457 --> 03:05:59.560
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so, um... We'll see if we get any calls.

03:06:00.941 --> 03:06:01.621
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody loves us.

03:06:01.701 --> 03:06:04.843
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, we're going to put details up on the website of exactly how you can call the show.

03:06:07.264 --> 03:06:08.305
[SPEAKER_18]: Da-da-da-da-da-da-da...

03:06:09.617 --> 03:06:12.120
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, is there anything else you guys wanted to add?

03:06:14.523 --> 03:06:15.484
[SPEAKER_29]: What up, dog?

03:06:18.047 --> 03:06:21.751
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to find a computer case with, like, very specific specifications.

03:06:21.831 --> 03:06:28.599
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I need... It has to be, like, about 13 to 14 inches wide and about 17 inches long.

03:06:29.200 --> 03:06:29.940
[SPEAKER_14]: Height is not a...

03:06:31.471 --> 03:06:32.813
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

03:06:52.552 --> 03:06:59.916
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need to install pretty much just, well, I don't know, I might be able to do it in a normal case.

03:07:01.037 --> 03:07:15.105
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I need enough room to install the extra ports for, because there's, on a normal DDR machine you've got like, you know, your standard, like a JAMMA cable and four other smaller 5-pin cables that get plugged in there.

03:07:15.425 --> 03:07:18.447
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it needs more than just the JAMMA stuff.

03:07:18.888 --> 03:07:33.477
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need to add those extra ports onto the PC, and then I need to have, like, the, um, there's a monitor, um, what was it, like a video, uh, converter card or something, that small little, um, PC board that I need to get.

03:07:34.057 --> 03:07:46.285
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need to have that all inside a case, and it's just kind of, um, well, it's kind of tough to get a case a whole, all that, without heavily modding one or having to make one, so...

03:07:47.864 --> 03:07:49.604
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I don't know.

03:07:52.665 --> 03:07:57.406
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was waiting for somebody to call, but I guess it's not going to happen.

03:07:57.726 --> 03:07:58.506
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess not.

03:07:59.006 --> 03:07:59.386
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

03:08:00.187 --> 03:08:00.607
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well.

03:08:01.487 --> 03:08:02.967
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought somebody said they were going to call.

03:08:03.307 --> 03:08:07.848
[SPEAKER_14]: There was that one chick, Misty, that said... Well, yeah, but I didn't think she had a mic.

03:08:07.888 --> 03:08:08.328
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me see.

03:08:10.609 --> 03:08:10.729
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

03:08:11.466 --> 03:08:13.408
[SPEAKER_18]: The person who's going to call us is having technical problems.

03:08:13.428 --> 03:08:14.849
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess we'll just have to try again next week.

03:08:15.870 --> 03:08:17.111
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you everybody for listening.

03:08:17.311 --> 03:08:18.772
[SPEAKER_18]: I went ahead and closed the Skype line for now.

03:08:19.853 --> 03:08:23.777
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to do a post-show tonight of... I don't know what music I want to do.

03:08:23.817 --> 03:08:29.461
[SPEAKER_18]: How about... I like those compilations that I've been downloading recently.

03:08:29.501 --> 03:08:30.823
[SPEAKER_18]: The Ministry of Sound stuff.

03:08:31.483 --> 03:08:33.745
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you've got a lot of that on your computer, but I like it too.

03:08:34.225 --> 03:08:35.446
[SPEAKER_14]: We should listen to the whole...

03:08:37.045 --> 03:08:40.526
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole V-Rare CD for DJ Damien.

03:08:40.586 --> 03:08:41.106
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we shouldn't.

03:08:42.786 --> 03:08:43.006
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

03:08:44.227 --> 03:08:46.147
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I was just looking at an Alienware site.

03:08:46.167 --> 03:08:48.667
[SPEAKER_14]: They have, like, small, mid-sized business computers.

03:08:48.908 --> 03:08:51.748
[SPEAKER_14]: Who the fuck would buy Alienware computers for business?

03:08:52.228 --> 03:08:56.289
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can't even look professional with this little alien head on there and shit.

03:08:56.309 --> 03:08:58.990
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I guess it beats cow print.

03:08:59.730 --> 03:09:00.190
[SPEAKER_14]: But whatever.

03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:06.053
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we will see you guys later.

03:09:06.293 --> 03:09:07.354
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks a lot for listening.

03:09:07.594 --> 03:09:10.817
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy this random mix of stuff mixed together by Ministry Sound.

03:09:10.837 --> 03:09:14.160
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of good DDR sounding stuff in here and stuff you've probably heard in a cage match before.

03:09:14.540 --> 03:09:15.601
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a great night, you guys.

03:09:15.621 --> 03:09:18.364

I can't let you go Why can't you stay?

03:15:31.352 --> 03:15:35.133
[SPEAKER_07]: I still wonder why I can't let you go

I am looking but can't see ahead

03:18:32.418 --> 03:18:35.961
[SPEAKER_07]: Lost in this space, there's a voice calling out in my head.

03:18:36.041 --> 03:18:40.564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm passing my faces that I hardly know I'll ever see.

03:18:40.684 --> 03:18:41.345
And they keep on
