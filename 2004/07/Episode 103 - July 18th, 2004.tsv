242	2163	I miss forensic files really badly.
2204	3124	I go through withdrawal.
4205	11390	And I miss, and like everyone's now telling me that at least five, six people have told me that Stargate show's pretty good.
11430	15193	So I downloaded the first episode of the Atlantis one.
15413	16554	I've got that downloading.
17255	21558	And I love Iron Chef, so I've been trying to download as much Iron Chef as possible.
22299	25341	I have the liver battle and the caviar battle and the broccoli battle.
25581	26622	They made broccoli ice cream.
27362	28163	You both have like...
30309	31951	Ooh, I need more Iron Chef.
32711	34033	I even have one of the U.S.
34093	36835	ones, The Egg Battle, which I actually need to watch just to see how bad it is.
39377	45663	And I'm actually, the other thing I'm downloading right now is like a PaintShop Pro 8 beta, I think.
52129	55952	Speaking of TV, I've been watching a TV show I've been keeping up on.
56816	64402	TV Nihon has been so gracious to be fansubbing these for us, but the Sailor Moon live action show has got to be one of the greatest things ever.
64742	66763	Oh my god, it's freaking hilarious.
67344	68745	Even with the plushies!
69326	71547	Oh my god, yeah, it's in the, like, it's everything.
72247	76108	My girlfriend, who doesn't even like, you know, Rice Princess, she doesn't even, she hates Sailor Moon with a passion.
76568	79349	But she loves this show because it's just so cheesy.
79389	87252	Like, they never, when they're fighting, instead of them fighting, they just do cartwheels around each other, and that supposedly, we will defeat you with our cartwheels.
87272	93474	Well, that's almost how it is on the show itself, you know, they do the, I find it so funny that Usagi is supposed to be so...
93954	123213	Clumsy yet she can do all these elaborate poses All these crazy cartwheels and backflips and stuff It's just crazy It's so funny too And for people who do like Sailor Moon If there's anybody who likes Sailor Moon I've watched all of it They rewrote the script so it's still kind of fresh and new I mean they have some elements from the cartoon, the original But it kind of adds a little more And a little more adult Not really adult but I guess more mature humor I mean there's no sex or anything Darn
125347	128949	You know, we need the Haruka Michiru action.
130490	132651	Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune.
134712	134992	Alright.
135672	137933	We're going to go to a break because we haven't been to a break for a little while now.
138394	139034	Oh, actually, I'm sorry.
139294	143797	We should ask Lanky Saldo, since he's here, how was your week and how was your day since we were just finishing that segment up?
145818	146198	Jeez.
146578	152101	Same as always, except I just got some new crack from Irene.
152901	166431	I downloaded the Harry Potter game, The Prisoner of Azkaban, and she's, you know, it's so childish, but, you know, for a fan, like, as big of a fan she is of Harry Potter, you know, she has to play it, so, it's funny.
166892	171795	And it's, like, really skipping and stuff during the dialogue, so it's so funny, it'll be talking, and it'll be like, what's up, Harry?
173737	176019	And it's, like, it's great, it's funny.
176879	181883	And I just bought a new graphic card on the way here, I bought a new Radeon that's gonna, like,
182918	183419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
205362	212649	With all the problems you just went through with your graphic card, I think you should probably stick with the one you just, you know, you just finally fixed it so you can play your stupid Final Fantasy XI game.
212969	213990	Yeah, yeah.
214550	215391	How do you like them apples?
216873	218394	I think we need to go to a break right now.
219435	220696	Because I need to have a word with Brad.
221314	223377	Anyway, yeah, we're going to go to a break.
224638	227782	When we come back, we'll talk about some Bomani news, if we can dig any up.
228323	230566	And, of course, the cage match.
231647	235052	Of course, the FUs of the week, Ask Orange Lounge, and the Skype line.
235132	239778	All this when we come back from this break featuring more Dance Maniacs music, because that's what I feel like hearing.
251977	253418	Thank you for watching!
294216	295698	Thank you for watching.
295718	296679	See you next time.
323627	324528	Thank you for watching!
358341	359502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
385727	386367	I, I, I, I, I
431881	432163	Thank you.
514438	517640	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
517960	519982	No!
520202	520862	Just kidding.
521303	522343	Orange Lounge Radio.
522403	524044	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
527186	528387	Welcome back, boys and girls.
529227	530388	Orange Lounge Radio.
530808	531389	Here we are.
532866	534528	Episode number 103.
535589	538311	I wasn't supposed to be here tonight, but I was granted a reprieve.
538331	540073	I'm not supposed to be here today.
540894	545638	I get to leave tomorrow instead, so I'm hoping to check out some interesting things while I'm on the East Coast.
546298	546959	We'll have to see.
551083	555246	Loki had to do some surgery on the microphone here to get it to work right, but it's great now.
556047	557889	Jonas is fondling Loki's cock.
560416	562638	Oh my god, did you just put Loki's cock in your mouth?
563378	564879	Jonas, what the hell is that?
570203	572024	Watch out or his cock will bite you.
572264	573445	His cock's a real pecker.
579649	581130	Oh, I was having fun with that too.
582752	584013	Let's not have fun with the cock.
587175	588796	The only one you should have fun with is your own.
589986	594308	So you said, Loki, you said you saw something local on DDR this week in the news.
594808	596449	What did your mom say about it?
596489	597329	I didn't see it either.
597349	598029	I heard about it though.
598890	601090	She basically said DDR was on the news.
601110	603231	They said something about people losing weight playing the game.
604992	609814	So it was a generic interview piece that every news channel has done.
611234	612415	Was Tanya in it?
613936	614577	That's a shocker.
614977	615317	Alright.
616358	621442	So everything, it's just basically the same story that's been going around ever since that Associated Press thing picked it up, huh?
622022	622242	Alright.
623223	623643	Interesting.
624584	624804	What?
624904	625064	Yes.
625785	627166	Okay, this is bullshit.
627446	637414	The media and parents and stuff, they don't fucking care about our video games until somebody goes and kills somebody and then blames it on Grand Theft Auto or something, you know.
638035	640056	Yeah, we don't make fun of them for being crack whores.
640076	641897	Okay, what does that have to do with anything?
641917	642677	I don't know.
642697	644137	Anyway, yeah, sorry, I just wanted to
668450	668930	I digress.
670231	670931	Alright, that's alright.
671911	676833	I don't know, it's just the old TV saying of if it bleeds, it leads, you know?
676913	690918	If it's not like a really horrible, depressing story, or causing violence in the streets or whatever, then, you know, it's one of those pieces that's saved for the end of the newscast to make you feel good.
693078	694979	It's an uplifting story at the end, you know?
696345	698926	Fat man fat no more thanks to video game.
698986	699646	Who would have thought?
700406	702426	Nobody watches the news that long anyways.
703287	711509	They've watched the first ten minutes for all the bloody headlines, and then after that they wait until sports and they're done.
711549	713489	I just figured it out.
715150	721211	So they get lean, they lose weight, and they get in shape from playing this game, but then what's the deal?
721251	722992	Konami's not releasing any more DDRs.
723392	724692	So if you were going to get bored of DDR...
725134	725534	Hold on, hold on.
725694	736602	People are going to get bored of DDR, and they're going to stop playing, and they're going to get fat again, and then they're going to sue Konami, because they didn't come out with any new DDRs, just like they sue, like, McDonald's for not, you know, for making people fat.
737603	738063	Careful.
738263	739224	Technicality, though.
739324	745309	I know you mean no new DDR arcade, but every news story has focused on the DDR home version.
745329	754075	Almost all of them are talking about the home versions, and they are coming out with two of them this summer, or not this summer, but this fall, so, you know, you can't say that too much.
754602	755623	Well, I can't, because I don't like it.
756844	759826	The arcade DDR was the pinnacle moment for DDR.
760287	760767	Stapler.
761328	761548	Wait.
763750	765151	I want my stapler back.
766112	767713	Okay, Loki, yes, you have something to say.
769495	769735	Okay.
770430	777771	I saw another video this week of In The Groove, and I have to say, it doesn't look that bad.
777992	778352	What?
778692	779652	This coming from you?
779872	781352	It doesn't look... Well, here's the problem.
781892	783173	No, here's the thing, though.
783233	783913	Here's the thing, though.
784293	790634	It's before I saw early shots of In The Groove, and they've developed a lot further since when I saw it.
791054	792494	It actually looks pretty decent.
792894	795435	Wouldn't mind it actually coming into an arcade, except, you know...
796021	798543	Yeah, I mean, look at what the options are out there right now.
798563	800345	You have two fucking bootlegs floating around.
800485	806910	One's a miscolored DDR Extreme, and the other one's like a DDR Extreme with like this overclocking on it, which is stupid.
807871	812054	But, you know, I'd rather play in the groove than that shit.
812195	813716	So, you know, hey, bring it in.
814096	818200	Don't spend $650 on these bootlegs and bring in the groove.
818240	820041	I mean, it actually doesn't look that bad.
820301	821662	The interface is pretty nice.
822843	824105	I like what they've done with it so far.
845831	849614	And it just looked very interesting, that's all.
850875	852756	I would still rather have a new Konami DDR.
853076	858580	Well, okay, yeah, but at the moment, since there is no Konami DDR on the horizon, I'll take this.
858600	863343	It's kind of like, it's like, can you go give me, hey, can you go to the fridge and give me a soda?
863864	864825	All we got's diet.
865345	867446	Man, alright, I'll drink it anyway.
868087	873891	No, it's more like, your choices are George W. Bush or John McCain, which you'd rather have.
875615	879376	John Kerry, I'm sorry, that was last fucking election or whatever, wasn't it?
880157	882118	You just totally lost it.
882938	885719	Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, either one sucks to me.
888460	890641	Yes, Jamie wants to say, where's the other mic over there?
891241	891681	Yes, Jamie.
894262	897644	I saw a funny bumper sticker day since you mentioned that.
898484	901005	It said Clinton, he did it between two Bushes.
905200	909804	On that note, I think we're going to go ahead and get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
910966	911886	How about the cage match?
914429	918793	The way the cage match works, for those of you guys who haven't listened before, you've got to be in our chat room to participate.
918833	920795	OrangeLawnRadio.com, you pick a winner.
921215	923717	Three songs, each host brings one to the table.
924518	927741	You get to hear a clip of last week's winner, because you already heard it last week.
928234	930414	And then you get to hear two new songs in the entirety.
930454	931435	You vote for your favorite.
931475	937216	That favorite goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.
937416	939876	24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with the Monty Music and More program.
940396	941856	Okay, so let's get right into it.
941916	946377	Last week's winner was brought to the table by Loki, and it's BT.
947717	952818	And the song is called Kimo Sabe, and we figured out it is in one of those other harmonics games.
952878	953598	It's in Amplitude.
954839	955939	Alright, so here it is.
956019	957239	Song number one, a clip of this.
957935	960600	BT, Kimo Sabe, enjoy.
1049315	1051885	I rock creativity, I bust positive vibes from the west to Maui
1085447	1086548	Pull it back.
1140360	1143302	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
1143322	1148246	A clip of last week's winner, BT with Kimo Sabe.
1148806	1150567	Alright, let's get into song number two tonight.
1150627	1152689	Song number two is my pick.
1154008	1179769	And I decided, you know what, I'd like to win a cage match before I leave town So I picked an artist that I usually tend to win this with And you know what, I do really like this song a lot It's my favorite by her that I think I've heard to date So let's hear it for Kylie's sister, Dani This is Dani Minogue with her latest single, I Begin To Wonder Enjoy, song number two in tonight's cage match Shut up Here we go, here it is
1193377	1194178	Thank you for watching!
1232052	1236434	And every time I think I'm breaking free, these thoughts return to trouble me, hanging on
1262236	1283014	You're a sinner but you told me you're a saint Too fast I tripped and lost my way Can't believe what's happened to me, baby Cause everyday is the same day Different faces, no names Places I've never been before And everyday is the same thing Different faces, no names Places I've never been before
1302648	1305050	All this time you led me astray Making love to you, I do
1339521	1344721	I'm really over you No time to think, I love death
1365823	1366524	Thank you for watching!
1393243	1395664	All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
1397044	1401485	Danny Minow with I Begin to Wonder, and I'm wondering what you guys thought of that song.
1401525	1403005	Let's start with, who's got the mic?
1403065	1404425	Puppy, what did you think of that?
1405825	1410206	It really does sound like one of her sister's songs.
1410286	1415687	Yeah, besides the fact that it was really boring, it was really boring.
1415807	1418328	So yeah, a five.
1418888	1419228	Five.
1420248	1420508	Jamie?
1421607	1422967	I've heard that song before.
1424068	1426709	It's pretty repetitive.
1426829	1427409	It's not bad.
1427429	1428709	I think it's a 7.
1428829	1430110	It gets a 7.
1430330	1431210	Alright, moving on.
1431230	1431610	Aaron.
1433771	1434911	Aaron gives it half a lung.
1436632	1437492	Alright, fine.
1437512	1438732	Lanky style then.
1438812	1442113	Yeah, of course I've heard that.
1442153	1444174	Every time I'm driving in the car with you.
1444314	1445034	It's not a bad song.
1445074	1447715	I think it's pretty poppy, like most of Danny Minow's stuff, but
1448157	1450759	Personally, I have to say I put the needle on it a lot better.
1451219	1451719	A lot better.
1451980	1453080	So I'll give that a 7.
1453220	1461846	Alright, um... Jonas, your thoughts on that one?
1462607	1465229	I begin to wonder why I'm gonna give this a 7 out of 10.
1466530	1467090	Me too.
1469331	1471853	Oh my god, I just noticed your hat says you're fired.
1472013	1473774	Is that an apprentice hat or something?
1474535	1475376	That's so funny.
1475416	1475996	Alright, alright.
1476536	1477297	Now it's Aaron's turn.
1477882	1481306	Um, well, it was not that great, I'm sorry to say.
1481326	1486291	It was kind of boring to the point where I took my testicle, put on my headphones, and started listening to music, so.
1486451	1487492	Alright, okay.
1487932	1489173	So, on a scale of 1 to 10?
1489414	1491095	Probably like 4.
1491756	1492257	4, alright.
1492577	1493117	Uh, Loki?
1495219	1495800	It was okay.
1495820	1497822	It was an easygoing, like, club song.
1497982	1498583	I give it like a 7.
1498743	1500004	It's cool.
1501978	1506502	I give it a 9, because it made me very gay, as in happy.
1507062	1508763	So, I like that song.
1510065	1515569	Moving on, song number 3 tonight is Jamie's Pick, and Jamie, you want to introduce your song?
1516330	1516710	Where is she?
1516750	1517471	There she is, here she comes.
1518174	1525420	It was on the administrative sound compilation, and it was by the... By the, what is it?
1525600	1526541	The Lost Brothers.
1526701	1527382	The Lost Brothers.
1527902	1532266	I like the song because the song was in The Lost Boys, which is like one of my all-time ever favorite movies.
1532786	1535148	And actually, it's actually like real samples.
1535208	1537830	It's not like somebody covering it, so it's very well done.
1538290	1544275	And I will never, ever, hardly ever say that any, you know, song that I like that much is well done.
1544556	1546277	So, yeah.
1547853	1549235	All right, then judge for yourself.
1549295	1549716	Here it is.
1550177	1551599	If you love the 80s, you'll love this.
1551659	1554323	The Lost Brothers, Cry Little Sister.
1554964	1555585	Jamie's pick.
1555625	1555906	Enjoy.
1687417	1688279	Thanks for watching!
1795230	1795810	All right.
1796270	1797251	Hey, quiet in the studio.
1797271	1797591	All right.
1797891	1799811	That was song number three in tonight's cage match.
1799851	1802392	That was Lost Brothers with Cry Little Sister.
1802672	1803552	Sorry about the ending there.
1803612	1809634	It starts to fade into another track because I'm one of those nonstop dance compilations, so you have to disregard the last 20 seconds of that track.
1810454	1812834	Otherwise, that was Cry Little Sister.
1812895	1814295	Let's see what everybody here thought of that.
1814335	1814575	Jamie.
1815228	1822590	Of course it's nowhere near as good as the original song because I can listen to the original on repeat, endless for days and years and months and everything.
1823190	1823831	I give that one a 9.
1824351	1825671	It's well done.
1825771	1830373	I would have liked for them to do a longer one that actually had the lyrics in it, you know, but that one was still pretty good.
1830933	1842916	It's enough to get that little bit of nostalgia pulled up in me and think of, who was it, Jason Patrick with those shades and that hair and Kiefer.
1843457	1843757	Young.
1845458	1845838	Right on.
1846279	1847379	Alright, uh, Loki.
1849301	1850702	Fucking cut myself on a wire.
1851162	1853964	Anyways, um, that was okay.
1854444	1856746	Um, I'd give it a seven as well.
1857226	1858807	It was just okay.
1859407	1859768	Alright.
1860468	1861129	Uh, LankyStyle.
1863410	1863951	It was pretty good.
1864031	1867793	It's a standard club song, you know, so I'd give it a seven.
1869454	1870295	Um, who else?
1870315	1870615	Puppy.
1870915	1871796	We can get over to Puppy.
1871816	1871916	Sorry.
1874246	1877528	You know, I wasn't really paying attention to the song, so I was drinking some pineapple soda.
1880609	1882390	You make Kiefer Sutherland cry.
1883010	1886092	Kiefer Sutherland was awesome in 24, and I loved that show, yeah.
1886272	1887413	But he was also in Lost Boys.
1888693	1888953	What?
1889574	1889714	Oh.
1891015	1894396	I haven't, uh, they've had the, the box office season 2's been out for a while.
1895657	1897698	But, oh yeah, oh yeah, the song, um.
1898763	1902464	It didn't really catch much of my attention anyways.
1902664	1904704	It seemed kind of mellow.
1905824	1910785	Just because I don't feel like favoring one song over the other, I'll give this one a 5.2.
1911565	1914926	Alright, Erin, VHG.
1917666	1919947	Nah, it wasn't anything special.
1920687	1921407	It was alright.
1921427	1926708	It'd be something I would listen to if I were driving, per se, but beyond that, I wouldn't really listen to it otherwise, so I'd give it a 6.
1928871	1929453	Jonas.
1931681	1932263	I'll give it a 7.
1932323	1933808	Same reasons.
1935560	1942241	I kind of have to agree with Jamie that it's just not as good as the original, but I honestly wouldn't even put it in the same ballpark.
1942461	1945442	Just the original is so great, that one doesn't have the lyrics.
1946502	1947142	It's okay.
1947622	1954064	I get the point about it's kind of, it makes you think, when I hear that song, I think about how I want to hear the original.
1954484	1956904	That's basically how it goes for me.
1957344	1960345	So I give the original a 10 and I give that a 6.
1960985	1961325	All right.
1962639	1963539	Here we go, guys.
1964100	1967021	Here's a clip of those three songs you can vote for one more time.
1967101	1970642	Song number one tonight, BT, Kimo Sabe.
1976905	1980027	Song number two tonight, Danny Minow, I Begin to Wonder.
1987450	1990711	And song number three tonight, Lost Brothers, Cry Little Sister.
2001658	2005201	All right, now you can start placing your vote.
2005301	2008043	But if you're undecided, we'll try this out tonight.
2008483	2014448	I'm going to allow a listener to come through on the Skype line and try to get people to vote for the one they think ought to win.
2014508	2023995	I don't know if anybody will bite on this, but as long as we have this new feature, we'll try it out and see if anyone wants to persuade people that they need to vote for a particular song.
2024055	2026417	So you can place vote now.
2027549	2028749	NightRiders NightRiders NightRiders
2057148	2058388	Wait, wait, your mic's not on over there.
2059209	2059769	Your mic's not on.
2059889	2060329	How's that?
2060449	2060989	Yeah, much better.
2062469	2065070	People in Renfair garb on a motorcycle.
2070432	2075133	This has got to be the biggest piece of crap I've ever looked at.
2077130	2093982	This movie, okay, this movie has a scene where this guy's just driving down the middle of this free, uh, middle of this highway going, he's all, ahhh, ahhh, they're going down the highway, ahhh, they show like out in the distance or something, ahhh, all of a sudden, vroom, gets hit by like a semi-truck.
2097284	2101407	I want them to do a new Knight Rider series, without David Hasselhoff.
2104512	2105173	All right.
2105313	2106934	David Hasselhoff is loved in Germany.
2107534	2109155	He owns the rights for Knight Rider.
2109316	2110536	He bought them, so.
2112138	2113178	Well, I guess that makes sense.
2113278	2114499	Nobody's going to call through on the skyline.
2114519	2115220	You're a bunch of pussies.
2115300	2115560	All right.
2119560	2121802	People suck for not calling the Skype line.
2122022	2122522	That's alright.
2122823	2123924	They'll have chances later.
2124124	2126666	Nobody liked any of those songs, I guess, but we'll see.
2126706	2129988	We are getting some votes, so we'll tally those up during the next break and let you know who won.
2130489	2133511	In the meantime, let's go back and talk about some new DDR news.
2133551	2134932	Hey, this just came up today, guys.
2136753	2137874	This is interesting, I think.
2141597	2146501	Alloy Magazine is having a DDR sweepstakes.
2148709	2163878	Alloy Magazine, by the way, is one of those, like, girly magazines, like, Seventeen, and Cosmo, yeah, VHG's like, oh god, in fact, if we, if we go to, prepare to be really sad.
2164859	2177366	Oh, it's cause, um, we, we, like, my sister and I used to have a subscription to one of those girly magazines, and every once in a while they send you, like, free subscriptions to other, or send you a free trial issue of another magazine, and one of them was Alloy.
2177787	2178407	So I was like,
2178806	2187534	Here are the top stories right now on Alloy.com Which fairy tale fox is dreamier, Chad Michael Murray and Hugh Dancy duke it out?
2205760	2205980	Who?
2206421	2206941	Yeah, I know.
2207581	2209683	So they're these dream kids, I guess.
2210704	2213666	And it says, hey, get your movie on this weekend.
2215507	2216388	Get your movie on.
2216548	2222132	And right on the front page there, there's gossip about Colin Farrell and where Will Smith changed their naughty ways.
2223252	2224293	How about who cares?
2224633	2224874	All right.
2224914	2226595	Anyway, well, this is why we care.
2226635	2232399	Because Alloy.com is right now having a You Got Served Take It to the Streets contest.
2232439	2232539	What?
2233863	2236725	And you guys are saying, what the fuck does this have to do with DDR?
2236805	2249735	Well, if you win the grand prize, you win a PlayStation 2, a Dance Dance Revolution prize package with two dance pads and the game, a Vega 32-inch TV.
2249795	2251056	Now that's the reason to win right there.
2251136	2253197	I want it for the Vega for 2DX.
2253258	2253738	Exactly.
2254078	2257621	And the copy of the new Take It to the Streets DVD.
2257921	2262685	Hey, and five first place winners get a copy of the Take It to the Streets DVD and DDR Max 2.
2263857	2268699	Game, so if you still don't have DDR Max 2, you can try and win it here on Alloy.com.
2268919	2271060	Just look in between the Who's Dreamier polls.
2271080	2277863	If it weren't for the fact that they had to include the movie You Got Served anywhere in this contest, it'd be worth entering.
2279324	2283325	Take It to the Streets is where they show the choreography, it's like Darren's Dance Cruise.
2283766	2285846	Which I own both of those, sadly enough.
2287007	2288828	That's depressing, but hold on, I'm confused.
2288888	2291649	Okay, it's You Got Served, Take It to the Streets,
2293084	2294405	It's not going to buy you, or is it?
2294485	2295585	Okay, anyway, sorry.
2295785	2297266	She's talking about the Knight Riders movie, whatever.
2297486	2302788	Anyway, so, is it a DDR tournament or a freestyle dance?
2303708	2304289	It's a contest.
2304749	2305969	What kind of contest is this?
2306029	2306990	Give me some information.
2307070	2308610	Are people really dancing?
2308650	2311131	Oh, how do you enter the You Got Served contest?
2311191	2312572	No, what is it doing?
2313212	2314293	Oh, is it a sweepstakes?
2314573	2317054	Yeah, this is a sweepstakes.
2317194	2319154	It's not like a tournament or anything.
2319214	2320135	It's just a sweepstakes.
2321027	2321547	Okay, whatever.
2321928	2325230	All you do, basically... Oh my god, I'll enter it, because I want the TV.
2325270	2326150	How do you enter now?
2326230	2328231	You just... You give them your information.
2328432	2328792	That's it.
2328852	2334815	You give them your mailing address and stuff, so they'll probably send you copies of their crappy magazine, and you have a chance to win a Wega.
2335616	2336116	What a deal.
2336576	2338778	Do I get to tell them how I feel about the movie you got served?
2339398	2339958	If you want.
2339998	2341379	Because I got some things to say.
2343340	2347143	Yeah, everyone got served, but we got served... Yeah, a big pile of crap.
2349224	2350625	Are you going to serve you got served?
2354646	2358287	I'll serve chicken with a side of vegetables.
2358467	2358847	Thank you.
2364808	2367609	Dancing movies are really just cheesy all together.
2367649	2369029	Like, who remembers Lombada?
2370390	2371630	Save the Rainforest.
2371950	2372270	Yep.
2374091	2375131	Break-In was awesome.
2376731	2378211	Break-In 2, Electric Boogaloo.
2384124	2385265	How about the sound of music?
2385385	2386366	That was pretty sweet.
2386786	2389608	Those dances they did, whoa, that was off the chains.
2390609	2395892	For a shizzle.
2396232	2400716	The, uh, do not take us away to concentration camps dance.
2400836	2401456	That was great.
2402557	2406039	That was, that, that dance was just, like, awesome.
2407620	2408241	I was moved.
2408641	2409702	In my pants.
2410162	2410602	Oh my god.
2414970	2415510	Wow.
2416851	2418111	You got served, Hitler.
2422732	2430854	That, you know what, that was just, you were right, that was moving, as in bowel movement.
2436356	2436416	Um.
2437731	2439872	You know, this whole... Okay, I want to change the topic for a minute.
2439892	2445354	This whole, like, You Got Served contest being on Alloy.com kind of got me thinking earlier today.
2445414	2449156	It reminded me of a post from LiveJournal, one of my buddies LiveJournal.
2449176	2451537	I'm not going to embarrass them on the air because they might be listening.
2451897	2465882	But somebody was asking me in their LiveJournal today because they're having problems where they're not gay, but they're getting a lot of guys hitting on them because they've got, like, that... They've got that metrosexual thing going on, so, like, people assume the guy's gay.
2466383	2466823	And he's like...
2467850	2470833	You know, I'm a DDR player.
2470893	2471934	Does that make me gay?
2473275	2473595	Yes.
2474516	2483604	And that kind of just had me thinking about this stigma that DDR has with, like, the fact that if you're playing DDR, then you're either metrosexual or you're all the way gay.
2483725	2485426	If you play DDR, you gay.
2485646	2486407	Why is that?
2487168	2488709	Can somebody please explain that to me?
2488889	2490971	I don't totally see... I've seen some real...
2492092	2496776	Like, guys I would not consider gay at all.
2496856	2499798	In fact, they're not really gay or straight, they're just ugly.
2501320	2502921	And I've seen them playing DDR.
2503321	2505003	Well, well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2505063	2506564	G-Dog plays DDR, doesn't he?
2507304	2507965	Uh, moving on.
2510707	2512749	There's our new joke for the season.
2514670	2519975	I think that one of the reasons why people, you know, like... What's the word I'm looking for?
2519995	2520235	Like, they...
2521712	2527677	Wait a minute, wait a minute, though.
2530179	2534502	For the longest time, I was the only gay guy playing DDR in this town.
2534742	2535803	You know it, you know it.
2536604	2546551	At the time, yes, you were the- No, you were the only outwardly gay person playing.
2546631	2548653	Everybody else was just a closet homosexual.
2550066	2551887	And that's the word we're using today Of people who
2580359	2585521	who don't get out of their house and don't get with girls and stuff, you know, because gamer geeks don't have lives, so.
2586001	2586622	Well, that is true.
2586882	2587282	But anyway.
2588623	2589163	You see what I'm saying?
2589203	2589663	You know what?
2589723	2593304	I still find it very funny just how many guys in the Bay Area were playing Patapata.
2593925	2597746	I guess, by the way, you guys, I guess we dropped for like half a second.
2597826	2601828	I don't know what happened, but... I don't know what the fuck that was about.
2602388	2607310	Yeah, seriously, it was amazing how many guys played Patapata Paradise compared to girls.
2607691	2608731	Because when I played, there were like
2609353	2612255	3 girls playing, including me, and the rest were all guys.
2612355	2616899	Well, that's just that bad thing about there not being as many girl gamers as there are guy gamers.
2616919	2621302	The funny thing was watching how many guys played Deluxe and Oh Sole Mio.
2621662	2622343	Oh, yeah.
2622403	2625865	Okay, now that's another reason why people think they're gay, because of that.
2626226	2627687	Doing the Deluxe dance.
2627767	2632350	And those were like the two songs I kind of just didn't touch after a while.
2633051	2634772	I was just like, fuck it, I'm not playing those songs.
2636232	2646420	And for some people, and I know a few people listening actually haven't seen any of these on Patapata, Deluxe has a move where you put one hand out to one side, and the other hand out to the other side, and then you shake your butt.
2646820	2650002	And your hands are kind of in a faggish motion.
2650903	2653365	Your hands are held vertically.
2653405	2658268	Yeah, but to be more accurate, you should be pointing it down like this.
2658629	2659829	And then there's Oh Sole Mio.
2660150	2661731	Where you do the little teacup-looking dance.
2662422	2667023	The Oso de Mio has... You fan your ass as you walk to the other side.
2667423	2668823	I like to call it the cock block.
2670403	2678845	You know, you're swatting something away from your butt because, you know... You have one hand pointed out to the side like you're waving and the other one waving at your ass.
2678865	2680185	Yeah, like, I don't want you, you're ugly.
2680465	2681185	You over there.
2681465	2682305	You're pretty attractive.
2682385	2685866	I grab this one and wave this one away.
2685966	2686446	Exactly.
2686806	2687606	It's Robert Faces.
2689387	2689887	Shut up.
2690907	2691267	Anyway...
2692421	2698123	But my point is, is that this whole, like, Alloy.com thing, this isn't helping, this image, at all.
2698563	2702344	Because, like, I'm looking at this page going, this is the gayest thing I've ever seen.
2704505	2711027	Like, yeah, seriously, I'm just, I'm waiting for, like, Madonna to start playing, and, uh, you know, Liza Minnelli.
2711047	2713687	Even worse, Madonna remixed by Thundercast.
2713968	2718209	If Madonna ends up in the next DDR, you all are going to start sucking cock.
2718329	2719269	It's basically what's going to happen.
2723945	2724405	I'm kidding.
2724845	2725485	I'm totally kidding.
2726045	2727526	We shouldn't be stereotypical.
2727566	2728186	It's not nice.
2728266	2729666	But you know everybody else is.
2729966	2731707	Everybody outside of this scene is.
2736608	2739068	When have we ever been nice?
2740228	2743029	I just have a question for all the straight guys in the room, which has everybody but me.
2743669	2744309	Okay, I have a question.
2744709	2748170	Have any of you straight guys, any of you straight guys in the room,
2749195	2752497	Have you ever not been called gay while playing DDR?
2752517	2754899	Why are you talking to me?
2756360	2757941	Have I ever been not called gay?
2757961	2760803	They're like, Danny, you're so hetero!
2760984	2761944	Damn you, hetero!
2762525	2763966	Get out of my arcade, you hetero!
2763986	2764946	Let me rephrase the question.
2765007	2767528	You all have been called gay at least once while playing DDR?
2768209	2769150	You've never been called gay?
2771011	2772532	You've been called feminists?
2773953	2774694	You were called feminists?
2774914	2775474	What did you do?
2775514	2776155	Did you, like...
2777130	2793309	Buy tickets to the Lilith Fair and start blasting Ani DiFranco and... And started joining Greenpeace and shit, what... Okay, for the whole time I've been playing DDR, I was never called gay.
2794315	2797538	But someone was calling me a feminist or something like that.
2797558	2800842	I have not, but most of the times I've been, there's been no one around when I've played.
2816530	2819451	Well, you remember... Not the Bay Area, where it's a little more accepted.
2819511	2825052	Well, there's also, keep in mind, keep in mind, there's the Roseville Children, as I like to call them.
2825072	2828774	The people that I have kicked out on a regular basis every time I go?
2829114	2829414	Yes.
2829734	2833555	It's that crowd that's more... Well, no, I had a group of, like, uh...
2834142	2836303	Mid to early 20 year olds, a bunch of them.
2836543	2842486	A bunch of them with one girl trying to impress this girl and they were calling me gay and they were like, he grabbed my hand.
2842926	2843647	Who's gay now?
2843747	2844087	Come on.
2844347	2849850	He grabbed my hand and tried to pull me off the machine and I'm like, no, you gay.
2852011	2855332	Yeah, he's like, oh my ass is screaming for some action.
2855572	2857033	I'm like, uh, get away.
2858794	2860415	Get away and let me play It's Ready Men.
2862175	2863076	Oh god, that was a...
2864025	2867087	Speaking of that, I remember playing Random All with some dude.
2867907	2871129	He's gay, and it ended up being It's Raining Men.
2871649	2875311	He was like... He was grabbing your ass when he was playing?
2875331	2876192	Yeah, he was grabbing my ass.
2876612	2880434	I wasn't sure if it was intentional, but... Hey man, just be flattered.
2882195	2884036	Just nod your head, smile, you know.
2884616	2885597	Yeah, just kidding.
2885937	2887358	He's like, ah, I don't like this.
2890139	2891720	Yeah, effeminate would be the word.
2893244	2894284	Which is practically the same.
2894304	2899468	We all know that Jonas was trying to say effeminate, but it was funnier that he said feminists.
2899669	2901530	Yeah, I knew he was trying to say effeminate.
2901630	2903552	I play DDR for women everywhere!
2903712	2905853	I was going to say, I was like, whoa.
2906314	2909516	I'm going to get up on this DDR machine and burn my bra!
2912178	2916682	Now if you want to see real gay, just look at the dynamite rave hand plant knee drop routine.
2917322	2918323	That's a different type of gay.
2918343	2919284	That's not gay.
2920049	2923691	Yeah, and if you yell at me, I'm going to take out my bloody tampon and throw it at you.
2924912	2930275	And by the way, gay is not a negative thing, so stop using it like it is.
2930295	2931416	Thank you, thank you.
2931596	2933457	You people suck ass.
2935018	2936139	Who's gay now?
2936940	2938541	You are the one that is gay.
2939561	2941723	You are the ball lickers.
2942898	2950702	But seriously, for all the people who go, oh, that's so gay, you people are the hemorrhoid on the butt of social progress.
2951082	2953963	I say that's so gay all the time.
2954383	2958645	You say it in relation to things that may be associated with gay things.
2958665	2960806	But see, I feel like I have an authority on it.
2961387	2963428	You know, like I have a wand and I can deem things.
2963448	2965088	I can say, this, gay.
2965769	2966049	It's gay.
2967116	2979105	No, okay, Rob and his immediate gay friends, they constantly say, like, terms that would be used to describe a homosexual male in negative connotations.
2979405	2980646	You fucking faggot!
2980866	2981527	Things like that.
2982267	2983248	I love you too!
2984929	2985189	See?
2985369	2987991	And that's how we say, you know, hello and stuff.
2988031	2992695	It's like... It's like another...
2995086	2998608	Group of people we know who use another word that is, yeah.
2999449	3004032	Anyway, I'm going away from this topic, but here, have the microphone, faggot.
3005913	3006433	Anyway.
3011096	3015519	I'm going to burn my bra right here on behalf of drag queens everywhere.
3015539	3015999	No, I'm kidding.
3016640	3017000	I'm kidding.
3017320	3019602	All right, you guys want to hear who won tonight's case match?
3020182	3020482	No.
3020963	3021803	Well, too bad.
3021843	3022444	You get to hear.
3024205	3024525	All right.
3025320	3026581	I'm very happy this song won.
3026642	3029504	Of course you are.
3029524	3029885	It's your song.
3050168	3053130	Danny Manero wins tonight's cage match in a very close vote.
3053430	3056512	So all three songs pretty well represented tonight.
3057313	3058774	That was a mercy thing right there.
3058794	3060095	But the point is that I won.
3061195	3062997	So now I don't have to pick a song for next week.
3063077	3063537	It's great.
3063557	3064257	It works out nice.
3064277	3064978	Thank you guys.
3064998	3067059	We needed the violin music playing in the background.
3067620	3073864	And I'm going to Pennsylvania for two weeks in front of my song.
3074504	3075525	Oh, my poor heart.
3076866	3083170	and I have a heart disease and I never learned to read!
3083631	3084291	Be quiet.
3084991	3088474	Hey Rob, at least you're white, okay?
3088614	3090375	So it's okay for you to go to Pennsylvania.
3090796	3093457	You won't have to be threatened by all the hicks over there.
3093497	3094958	What in the hell does that mean?
3095319	3096680	Excuse me, hicks where?
3097660	3098301	Pennsylvania.
3100586	3101387	Okay, never mind.
3102868	3116136	I'm sorry, I hear hick and all of a sudden I'm thinking like, okay, what you saying about... Look, on the outside I may be white, but on the inside... You're a black woman, a repressed black woman.
3116556	3119018	On the inside... Hey girl, yeah.
3119438	3122260	On the inside I am blood and guts, just like you.
3125582	3126283	On the outside...
3128064	3130165	Oh, we're getting a call.
3130865	3133066	I should actually answer the Skype line once in a while.
3133106	3134186	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge.
3135086	3135586	What do you want?
3136567	3136927	Hello.
3139528	3140208	Hello, can you hear us?
3140288	3140788	Orange Lounge.
3141508	3142949	Wow, we're already getting prank calls.
3143709	3144069	No.
3144909	3145690	Okay, call her.
3145850	3147130	Is your refrigerator running?
3147150	3148110	You better catch it.
3148931	3149431	Call you there?
3150411	3150711	Yeah.
3151071	3151872	Oh, hey, there you are.
3151912	3152252	What's up?
3152272	3152612	Who's this?
3155438	3157459	Turn off your BitTorrent!
3158159	3159160	Turn off your BitTorrent!
3159200	3162381	Turn off your, uh... Stop downloading the port!
3162441	3162941	Hey, what's up?
3164202	3164482	You there?
3164582	3165382	I have no torrent.
3165763	3165983	Okay.
3166403	3166723	What's up?
3169984	3170685	Not much, man.
3171225	3172445	Yeah, I think it's a lot of lag.
3172706	3177328	Hey, I gotta let you go, dude, because you got a lot of lag going on here, so try calling us back a little later.
3177468	3178108	Maybe it'll clear up.
3178808	3179168	Take care.
3179709	3180369	Thank you for the call.
3181717	3182338	I didn't catch it.
3182518	3186019	I see the name on Skype, but the names on Skype are different than the chatroom names, so.
3186280	3189241	Chuck, I'll call you back later, dude.
3190262	3191582	He said he didn't have any torrents running.
3191602	3192403	It was just a bad connection.
3192703	3193183	You know what, though?
3193823	3196585	Apparently our show dropped earlier, so it might even be us.
3196765	3197045	I don't know.
3197065	3198146	That might have something to do with it.
3198286	3198706	It might have.
3199466	3201147	I'll leave the Skype line open a little bit longer, though.
3201167	3202208	Somebody else wants to give it a call.
3203128	3206770	Let's call in and talk about the topic.
3207130	3207771	Change the subject?
3207871	3208171	Alright.
3209131	3210252	Back to dick and fart jokes.
3211337	3213119	Okay, no, actually, we can take a break.
3213179	3221265	Actually, I do want to play this, because I haven't even heard this yet, but apparently, Loki did a new remix last night, and I didn't even know about it.
3221625	3222506	So, what's up, Loki?
3222746	3223767	Tell us about your newest remix.
3223787	3224367	We're going to play it.
3224768	3230492	I was bored, and I saw someone made some stupid remix, and it's not even really a remix that they made.
3230512	3233134	It was like... I know it wasn't Max Remix.
3233215	3238539	It was like, I heard the other day Insertion and Ecstasy, and they sounded the same!
3238599	3239920	So I decided to mix them together.
3240939	3261550	and it sounded like crap, so, but, that got me thinking, I was like, hey, Ecstasy, I haven't used Ecstasy yet, and I was working on something before, and that just wasn't going anywhere, so I plugged Ecstasy in, and played that around, it's okay, my remixes are starting to become average now, and, yes, the DDR song, Ecstasy.
3263221	3266083	So this is like an average remix now.
3266323	3269884	I worked on it for a couple hours and I was just like, eh.
3270165	3271365	It's a mediocre remix.
3271745	3272566	It's mediocre.
3273066	3273586	It's okay.
3273646	3274787	There's parts that are cool.
3275207	3281910	There's just like bad transitions in a few spots that I have to... It's really... The song I was working with was hard.
3281970	3285352	But this is kind of a tribute song to the song that got me into techno in the first place.
3286119	3288981	14 Hours to Save the Earth by Tomski, so it's a remix between that.
3289121	3291783	It's Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.
3291923	3292343	Interesting.
3292423	3296746	Alright, we're going to check this out, and then we'll be back, and we'll talk about more stuff.
3296786	3297166	We'll be back.
3480200	3503581	For up to the minute Ramadian gaming news, discussion forums, and for access to the chat room, visit our website at orangeloungeradio.com Alright, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio, and that was Tomski vs. D-Complex, remixed by Loki there, Ecstasy, the 14 hours club mix.
3503601	3504341	What did you guys think of that?
3504401	3505082	I thought it was pretty good.
3506355	3506796	You know what?
3506916	3507657	I've got to be honest with you.
3507837	3514824	I think out of all of your songs, everything you've remixed, I think that is the one I would want to listen to more than anything else.
3515344	3519548	Well, no, I like a lot of his stuff, but I think I could see myself listening to that a lot.
3519809	3520770	I really like that.
3520950	3526836	I mean, I love Ecstasy to begin with, but I love the last minute and a half of the song with the other song mixed in.
3526896	3529618	I love how it makes you feel good when people touch you.
3530359	3531860	Oh, wait, wrong ecstasy.
3532261	3536484	I seriously... I think that is a better ecstasy remix than the one that was in Max 2.
3536624	3537344	Oh, way better.
3537384	3538725	That one on Max 2 sucks.
3539346	3542368	I cannot believe that Konami isn't calling you.
3542568	3545730	I mean, I realize that you're taking commercial songs and fusing them together.
3545951	3546071	Shh!
3546391	3547292	Don't tell him the secret.
3547312	3547932	Okay, well, you know.
3548673	3550074	But I still think even with...
3550834	3551715	I know, I'm kidding.
3551835	3562184	I still think, even your, like, Silent Hill remix you had earlier, where you're kind of remixing it on top of itself and stuff, and with enough public domain samples out there, honestly, because we know in a lot of DDR songs they're using public domain samples.
3562204	3562745	Oh, yeah.
3562785	3571412	They're public domain, or they're just, they're like sample kits from Acid, I swear to God they are, because I listen to so much techno music and stuff that you're like, wait a second, that's that song.
3571472	3575716	In fact, one Easy to Dancer song, which is called, like, uh...
3577774	3579137	Oh man, I can't remember the name of it.
3579197	3581281	It's like a long mega mix of like trance stuff.
3581662	3584006	It's all commercial songs!
3584687	3585609	No credit to them!
3585669	3587793	I'm like, you completely ripped them off!
3588114	3589075	Great, you know?
3589296	3590037	But seriously?
3591294	3592535	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3609602	3610782	Whatever that one program is.
3610842	3611342	You know what?
3611903	3612543	Fruity Loose!
3612683	3614443	I'm not making my song with Fruity Loose!
3614463	3614963	How can they tell?
3615083	3616564	How can they tell what program you're using?
3616604	3618164	Because it doesn't sound like MIDI.
3618424	3619224	That's what they like.
3619264	3620065	They like MIDI.
3620185	3622785	I honestly think you should just send it in anyway.
3622825	3623986	And if they say no, they say no.
3624046	3630927	But honestly, that is better than half the stuff that was in... Almost all the stuff that was in the Balmati Star Remix Contest last month.
3631408	3635589	I just don't have... Like, that right there is below my standards right there.
3635649	3636289	It's okay.
3636529	3636649	It's...
3637269	3643514	Nice, I like the parts in it, but I can't stand non-perfect transitions and stuff like that.
3643634	3644895	Well, you're just a perfectionist.
3645215	3646596	But you did that in one evening.
3647116	3649418	Yeah, I did that in about three hours or a couple hours.
3650099	3663148	I just sat down, I was listening to this really shitty... It sounded like someone just had two songs playing back-to-back and they just... They didn't even really remix them on top of each other with acid, they just kind of faded one into the other.
3664426	3666187	or faded one in on top of the other one.
3666227	3667328	It just didn't sound right.
3667948	3672932	Honestly, if somebody is going to reject your song from a remix contest because of the program you used, they are being ignorant.
3673052	3673892	That is so ignorant.
3673912	3677595	Well, because you understand that, you know, mash mixes are not real remixes.
3677615	3681037	Okay, but that's because people fucking did Paranoia Cowgirl, okay?
3681777	3682418	That's why.
3683939	3696042	What's funny, though, is I'd like them to tell the people that mash mixes aren't real mixes since, oh, wait a second, because I do think Acid, the site that actually produces the Acid 4.0 and stuff like that, guess what?
3696062	3697803	They have a whole remix contest section.
3697843	3698223	Guess what?
3698263	3703604	It's actually recognized by many artists like BT and David Bowie.
3703624	3707525	Yeah, I was going to say, David Bowie, wasn't he giving away a car for some mashup contest?
3707605	3721453	Actually, no, his, um, yeah, it was not only that, but his, um, the mash mixes were gonna be featured on his CD, so, you know, I guess that's not very important, you know, but hey, go ahead, play with Fruity Loops, because you're better than I am, because you know how to program instruments in MIDI.
3721926	3722466	You know what?
3722506	3723007	So what?
3723147	3723647	I don't care.
3723767	3726449	So I'm not programming shit, but you know what?
3726650	3730592	Not to say that all the Fruity Loops remix stuff sucks, because there is some good stuff.
3730612	3733294	There's really good stuff out there, but there's also bad stuff too.
3733755	3740960	That is really good too, and I think we need to recognize that mash mixes can be good when they're not stupid, basically.
3740980	3741701	Let me just put it this way.
3741721	3745203	When they're not mash, insert Bambi song here.
3745403	3749907	Everybody out there uses samples, whether you guys want to recognize that or not.
3750687	3752809	And, you know what, it's just, that's the way it is.
3752929	3764780	People, but, you can program your own, like, you know, um... You can, like, remix, you know, you can, like, actually, you know, add, you know, synth on top of this stuff.
3764800	3765701	That's what I need to learn.
3765741	3768924	See, once I learn the Fruity Loop stuff, I'll be able to do that much more with it.
3769164	3772707	Yeah, and you should keep working at it, honestly, because, seriously, I think if you were just...
3773428	3783536	If somebody were to give you money, and say, take a week, and take a DDR song, and put in public domain stuff, and original stuff, you would have an awesome DDR song.
3783656	3785258	Well, here's the situation, though.
3785338	3788761	If you were to actually, like, say, Konami went to, I want you to remix this song.
3788801	3795547	What they'll give you is they'll give you, like, this song, all the samples that were in it, and all the arrangements that were in it, like, basically the 8-track, the digital track.
3796147	3803374	It's a lot easier to work with raw, you know, tracks than just, you know, everything in a composition, so it's a lot harder to do it that way.
3804355	3817607	That's why, like, when, you know, Punk Knight gave me stuff to remix, it would be an EJ, he'd give me all the samples that he used and the arrangements they had, so you can just go in there, rearrange it, and add your own stuff into it, and it's a lot easier and sounds better.
3817647	3822431	That's, you know, they're not gonna just say, oh, we want you to take something that was on the soundtrack and remix it, so...
3823956	3824476	I just don't care.
3824496	3827418	I want to hear the stuff from the, what was it, the DDROSX
3854379	3857321	I don't even know what the hell the... OSC or whatever.
3857441	3859623	So I want to hear what their stuff was in there.
3859863	3861944	Because if it's any good, you know, that's cool.
3861984	3864926	But there's stuff that sucks too, you know.
3865167	3867028	I mean, I don't know.
3867288	3868109	Here's the thing though.
3868309	3872011	I don't consider it a remix if you remake the song in Fruity Loops.
3872772	3881898	If you take like synth and just basically remake the song, it sounds the same but it's a little different because you didn't quite get the right samples.
3882538	3883399	That's not a remix.
3884073	3886856	Thank you for watching!
3896044	3897965	Waving your hand at it too much, going, eh, it sucks.
3898185	3899906	I thought it was really good, personally.
3900647	3900967	Alright.
3903188	3910333	Um, Skype line is open if you have a comment on that remix, or comment on anything we've talked about during this show so far, really.
3911033	3911734	We'll get around to that.
3912294	3917057	We're going to get to the FUs in a little bit, and no, sorry, you will not be able to do your FUs over Skype.
3917857	3919358	The segment's too long as it is.
3919418	3920779	We need to not make it any longer.
3921300	3921840	So, uh,
3922984	3923404	Foon Team
3951283	3952264	I thought that was it.
3974687	3975729	Dojinshi Sites
3989901	3991641	Yeah, so Food Mix Plus should be coming out.
3991661	3994542	They didn't really say what's going to be in it.
3994562	3998323	Probably just some additional songs and whatnot, but hey, it's cool.
3998623	4005125	Well, actually, there might be some additional songs and edit steps, because I know they had edit steps on their website, so that'd be kind of neat.
4006725	4011567	And Tourney Mix 5, I have no fucking clue what's going on with that, so let's take a look-see here.
4012847	4016948	Last thing I heard, they were in like sway votes or public sway votes or something like that.
4017982	4020683	and I have no idea what they're doing, semifinals, finals.
4020703	4022083	What the fuck is a sway vote?
4022463	4027784	Uh, okay, semifinals, they just finished that, um, now they're on, um, finals.
4029645	4033726	Let's see what we can vote on, um, oh, I have to be logged in, fuck that.
4033746	4036066	Okay, um, so, yeah, they're in finals.
4036286	4043748	I have no idea who won, what's going on, but all I know is Kimo Sabe did not make it, and that makes me sad.
4044628	4044848	So...
4045359	4047740	Did that Just Like Naoki song make it in there?
4047801	4052323	Yeah, actually, here's the songs that were considered in the semifinals.
4052924	4058987	Like, let's see, we've got Domo Domo Domo, the KCP remix, so... Whatever that is.
4059267	4060228	Just Like Naoki.
4061309	4063870	Roppongi Canyon, it looks like it was.
4063890	4068653	Let's see, Lemmings, I think, and Pear Pear All Stars, One More Lovely...
4071010	4098975	There was Look at the Heaven, Halloween, Speedy Mix, Kick Your A by Archowl Then we have Party for You, Holy Night Mix, Stronger, Yoju, Kokoro no Bushi Niwa, Nari Nari, whatever that is, I don't know Some like crap Konnichiwa, Arigato Another Kick Your A, I think this is semi-finals right here I think this is semi-finals, so Kick Your A
4099602	4100923	One More Lovely, R.E.U.
4101204	4105267	You know, it's kind of sad that it's always a remix of like a Bomani song that, you know what I mean?
4105347	4105768	Interesting.
4105968	4111573	It's always like, I want a super hard song that's like, you know, ooh, it's something like what Money Ruler used to do.
4111813	4114075	Didn't the rules say that it has to be like catapult?
4114956	4115537	Eh, whatever.
4116537	4116938	Whatever.
4117138	4119160	They're just being such dumbass idiots.
4119878	4121019	So that's what's going on there.
4121659	4122059	Interesting.
4122139	4126862	As far as other stuff, really, that's been slow on all the, like, sites.
4128222	4131624	Haven't really found any new, like, really good sim files or anything.
4131664	4133985	I've just been playing what I had.
4136306	4143010	There are some really cool tutorials, though, on DDR Mania X, especially stuff to make your skin look more, like, in the groove, which is kind of neat.
4143030	4146872	They have, like, you know, the little, what was it, the...
4148938	4151860	How well you did, and you know the little graph there, just like in Beatmania.
4151880	4159646	They have how you can put that in your sim, how to make a combo bar, which is kind of neat, and some other stuff.
4160026	4161527	They'll really help out your skins.
4163669	4166090	So just look for those, they're really good tutorials.
4167691	4170073	And that's pretty much all with that.
4173608	4174149	All right.
4174669	4174989	All righty.
4199760	4205802	You can actually call us, and it's just like a phone call, except it doesn't cost you anything, it doesn't cost me anything, because it's all over our internet connection.
4206262	4208643	So, do give us a call.
4209303	4210183	It's fun.
4212644	4217486	But do make sure you close your torrents and have the maximum bandwidth possible before calling, because otherwise it messes up.
4220326	4226528	Okay, so I guess, since nobody is calling in on the Skype right now, maybe we'll go to another break, then we're going to come back and do the FUs.
4228109	4228609	Sounds good to me.
4230936	4231916	Yes, Jamie, you have a thought?
4232416	4234977	No, I just wanted the microphone because it comforts me.
4235717	4237577	Why does having the microphone comfort you?
4238057	4238498	I don't know.
4239458	4240158	It just does!
4241058	4251620	I'm happy because I'm in fourth in line to get the Megamix from GTA 3 for Rise FM, which has the song I'm looking for, Neo the One by Slider.
4253701	4254821	I got a call on the Skype line.
4254841	4255161	What's up?
4255181	4255861	You're on Orange Lounge.
4259614	4261115	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
4262335	4263256	You're at least trying to be.
4263816	4264597	Please say something.
4265857	4267098	Is it us that slides really bad?
4267218	4268038	Oh, yes, I am here.
4268719	4269059	You there?
4269639	4269959	Richie?
4270159	4270439	Again?
4271220	4271440	Yeah.
4272160	4272621	How you doing?
4272641	4272981	What's up?
4273001	4275642	I just had to call in again.
4275962	4276182	Okay.
4276202	4277043	I just want to hug up all the air.
4277903	4278383	Well, that's all right.
4279324	4281745	Nobody else wants to call in, so we've got you.
4281825	4283126	Do you still have that torrent going?
4284006	4284446	No, I don't.
4284687	4284907	Okay.
4285087	4286147	Oh, I can hear you a little clearer now.
4286547	4286728	What's up?
4286748	4287588	Did you have a comment on something?
4288556	4290899	I just wanted to say something about remixes and stuff.
4290939	4296785	I think Loki's remixes, I think you should, like, you know, like, submit them to, like, OC Remix or whatever.
4296825	4308538	I think they're really great, you know, it's like, you know, what he's doing with, you know, it's like, certain, like, songs and just, like, throwing, like, a whole new, like... Hey, Richie, speak a little bit louder so we can hear you, because... Sorry, can you hear me now?
4308738	4309519	Yes, I can hear you now.
4309981	4314205	I'm just saying that, yeah, Loki should submit some of his stuff to OC Remix.
4314506	4318109	I think it sounds professional, really.
4318149	4325597	I mean, like, I had one of my teachers at my school listen to some of Loki's remixes, and he was wondering, hey, do you know who this guy is?
4326278	4327238	And I was saying, oh, it's...
4328171	4328331	OC Remix
4347210	4348771	Would you ever consider sending something like that?
4348791	4351434	I would if I didn't use some other commercial songs.
4351654	4352755	That's the thing that's stopping you, huh?
4352895	4354016	Oh yeah, it's true, it's true.
4354236	4354796	Have you thought about it?
4354816	4355917	Can you hear me better now?
4355937	4358299	Or is my mic still like... I can hear you a little better now.
4358619	4359080	That's better.
4359100	4359320	Okay.
4359600	4359981	There you go.
4360781	4363644	Um, let's see, other than that, well, I mean, keep up the good work, Loki.
4363784	4366166	I'm looking forward to any new remixes you might have.
4366186	4368027	Alright.
4368067	4368708	Keep up the good work.
4368808	4368988	Yeah.
4369128	4369829	Remix more stuff.
4370209	4370449	Okay.
4370669	4371430	Thanks for calling, Richie.
4371890	4372611	Yeah, no problem at all.
4373353	4373833	See you guys later.
4397079	4403321	Loki, have you thought about trying to maybe do something with public domain samples?
4404681	4405221	I thought about it.
4405241	4414063	I'm starting to go more that way anyways, because with this song even, I used a lot of those BT public domain samples that I got.
4414343	4419385	Didn't you do one a while back where you remixed a song with other video game samples or something?
4419725	4425506	That's the kind of thing OC Remix would eat up, if it was video game music mixed with other video game music, I think.
4426034	4427074	I don't think I did.
4427114	4437517	The only song that's sort of like just a bunch of different songs was that Dynamis one, which was like kind of eh, you know.
4437778	4439038	I could just, I don't know.
4440338	4441859	Pretty much like, I like the stuff...
4443382	4447323	If I learned how to do, like, DMS files or something like that, you know, that'd be kick-ass.
4447923	4450464	It's just, really, I don't have a lot of music theory and stuff.
4450504	4459686	I never took the classes, don't know shit about... I mean, I understand, you know, structure of a song and stuff, it just... Didn't they say that Akira Yamaoka couldn't even read music when he started?
4459926	4460266	I don't know.
4460286	4461626	I could've sworn I read that on some fan site.
4461646	4467448	It's probably... It's like, I just need to have, like... Because I need, like, you know, some of the set stuff.
4468368	4469788	Like, you know, scales and stuff like that.
4469808	4472249	Because, really, if you listen to a lot of songs, they're the same scales.
4473007	4477212	It's the same structure, they're very simple, they just use really elaborate samples, that's all it is.
4478373	4486999	So, I mean, pretty much every single fucking trance song, you always have a four on the floor, and then you have some beat that's going at, you know, 12th notes, and that's it.
4487379	4493664	It's every single, yeah, it's every single, you know, trance song out there, pretty much.
4494845	4499508	I tried last night to make another Revenge Neo song, and it didn't turn out very well.
4499588	4505572	That was like, I tried, what was it, I was mixing that one, um, Revenge song from, uh,
4507053	4515840	Poppin' Music, it was the one that sounds sort of like Exotic Ethnic, but not.
4516080	4519043	I tried mixing it with Exotic Ethnic, and that really sucked.
4519443	4520924	It did not sound well at all.
4521464	4522465	So, I don't know.
4523306	4525948	I want to get some sample kits and stuff.
4526008	4532673	I'm just kind of weary to do that, because I have 30,000 public domain samples on about
4534385	4538068	20 CDs or so, 20 plus CDs, and I don't use any of them.
4538228	4539549	I use about two.
4540650	4541331	Two out of those.
4542692	4543953	So, I don't know.
4544053	4549237	I just have to kind of go through and look at all those samples again, because I had them all ripped to my hard drive and it just took up too much space.
4550137	4550898	So, I don't know.
4552159	4557203	Alright, well, what we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, the F use of the week.
4557803	4558664	We're going to get ranty.
4559705	4562807	The chat room's getting mad at me because I'm calling them all pussies, and they're like,
4564566	4565587	Skype doesn't work out.
4565627	4567548	Yeah, I'll have Aaron call you a pussy instead.
4571091	4572231	Or she'll barf up along.
4572532	4577975	No, actually, but some of them, I guess Skype only works on Windows XP, I guess.
4578095	4579937	So that messes some people up.
4580157	4581738	And why don't you have Windows XP?
4582338	4584660	Well, you know, some people don't.
4585180	4586381	You know, there's Macs, Linux.
4586941	4588362	Some people still want to use ME, whatever.
4589463	4590984	If you have a Mac, okay.
4591264	4592465	If you have Linux, okay.
4592485	4592565	Okay.
4592850	4596813	But if you're using any other kind of form of Windows, why don't you have Windows XP?
4597574	4601317	Challenging somebody on their operating system, though, is such a nerd war.
4601377	4605260	You're just waiting to get lashed at for challenging someone on their operating system.
4606821	4607561	Here comes the chat room.
4607581	4608002	Here they come.
4608022	4612545	There is, by the way, a certain build where you start off with Windows 3.11, build up through to 2000.
4613646	4619110	But you take, I think, 3.11, upgrade that to NT, upgrade that to 2000.
4619150	4622613	It's supposed to be the most secure way to run Windows.
4623462	4624562	Much more secure than XP.
4625563	4627103	And I know a lot of people who do it that way.
4628384	4629864	Anyway... Everything will still run.
4630764	4644768	Anyway... Okay, so... And you remember what happened, you know... But I see that we've got a ton of people on our Skype list, so I know that there's more people than just the one calling in, so... It's alright.
4645829	4646609	That's alright.
4647289	4647829	That's alright.
4649530	4652271	We're gonna go... You just like saying the word pussy, don't you, Erin?
4652551	4653031	And boobies.
4655026	4655787	I love this show.
4656227	4656567	Alright.
4657248	4658089	What was the other word?
4658329	4659049	We'll be back.
4660931	4665835	We'll be back with the FUs of the week, which you can send over a private message.
4666715	4670819	But please no FUs to Brad for his operating system rant, because I just don't want to go there tonight.
4670879	4671199	Alright.
4671679	4672220	We'll be back.
4856741	4857824	Thanks for watching!
4941008	4945170	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
4945390	4947111	Do you want to be staffed by Hollywood?
4947151	4947471	No!
4947651	4951272	Do we care what people think of us?
4951892	4953753	No!
4953793	4955214	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
4955694	4958675	Yes!
4959776	4961656	Extreme Babani Radio.
4961856	4964698	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
4965218	4966819	We are back, Orange Lounge Radio.
4966839	4967939	Here we are, episode number 103.
4968099	4969219	You know what, Rob?
4970982	4973704	Pretty soon we'll get to use the other promo again.
4974845	4976406	I know, because Pump Up the Volume is doing it.
4976446	4977787	When are you officially moving that?
4978327	4987633	Well, I start school August 16th, but I think I have an orientation the week before, so it's probably going to be either the first or second week in August.
4987774	4990215	Alright, but this week you can hear Pump Up the Volume what night?
4990455	4991196	Monday!
4991316	4992557	Monday, Sunday.
4992657	4996139	And what happens on Monday night at 7 and 7.30?
4996479	5000182	Well, I actually have started my pre-show a whole lot earlier now because I usually just get bored.
5002007	5004047	Pre-show's been now starting about 6.45.
5006569	5007189	6.45 to 7 o'clock.
5007649	5009610	And then around 7.30 I start the normal show.
5009650	5013211	And it's supposed to end at 10.30, but sometimes I just stay bored and keep going.
5013231	5014552	You're basically just a radio whore.
5014992	5015752	I'm such a whore.
5016313	5017593	So what do you do on that show?
5018113	5022135	It's supposedly a request show, but nobody ever requests anything anymore except Dark Knight.
5024136	5025917	And Angel does sometimes when she's there.
5028618	5028818	But...
5031071	5038616	But if you hang out in our chat room, like many of you are right now, you can request or spend any song that you want to listen to.
5038636	5043879	And I've got access now to more music, so my library will just be growing.
5046200	5054726	So, in fact, I've been trying to start a segment on my show that's DarkSakura email, much in the vein of StrongBad email.
5055700	5056820	Where I answer your email.
5056840	5058261	Will you talk with a voice like this?
5058921	5063522	I'm not going to be doing the... Dear DarkSakura.
5063642	5064142	No, I'm kidding.
5064202	5066603	I'm not going to be talking in the strong bad voice.
5067843	5073064	As you take some stuff, add some more stuff, and answer the email.
5073225	5074205	I'm not going to be doing that, no.
5075585	5081547	So, just send me a private message on our forums.
5081827	5082587	Hint, hint, hint.
5083386	5103741	at orangechallengeradio.com or shoot me an email to darksakura at gmail.com because you can send it right to me or you can send it to our other email at orangechallengeradio at yahoo.com
5107507	5110670	and I prefer having MP3s to OGGs, thank you.
5110770	5113032	I can use them, but I can't play them on the station.
5115594	5119357	Tuesday nights is Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio remix show.
5119830	5123292	which will not be live for the next couple weeks because I'm not going to be in town.
5123953	5125414	But do enjoy the great music on there.
5125434	5129036	I'll make sure to try and bump up the playlist a little bit before I leave town.
5129176	5130377	And there's some really good stuff.
5130877	5131517	Awesome music.
5131718	5134879	Some more people have been tuning in lately and just hearing what a great show that is.
5134920	5138702	If you like Loki's remixes, there's tons of very talented people just like them out there.
5139042	5142466	Remixing Mamani songs and we like to give all those songs a place to be heard.
5142826	5144628	So Diversion is that place.
5144648	5146110	7 o'clock Tuesday nights here on the station.
5147011	5152997	Wednesday nights are empty right now but I hope to have an announcement about Vanilla Sky when I get back from my trip.
5153558	5154399	Yes, Lanky Style?
5156556	5157796	He's just picking his nose, that's all right.
5157816	5158557	He's picking his nose.
5158637	5158997	All right.
5159437	5171902	Remember, you can pick your friends, you can pick your nose, but if you pick your friend's nose, you're a big, gross, paraplegic, and they need their nose picked.
5172202	5173983	God damn it, I'm doing them a favor.
5175723	5176023	Anyway.
5176163	5181545	But if you need to, this is what tweezers are for, okay?
5181985	5183026	More interesting things.
5183406	5184807	I don't care about the handicapped.
5185067	5185887	I just want to make that clear.
5187182	5189643	You have a fetish for picking the nose of paraplegics.
5190123	5190543	That's it.
5190843	5193484	When did this show derail that quickly?
5193605	5194525	That's what I want to know.
5195405	5195825	When?
5196946	5199907	How about episode two when I wasn't here?
5205569	5205889	Alright.
5206810	5208530	How about on that Bart train?
5213143	5218725	Moving on, there's some actual other Bomani news going on this week, and it's Bomani news that doesn't involve California.
5218825	5220226	Do we have hot Bomani action?
5221146	5221846	California!
5223027	5223747	California!
5226508	5228189	This is Lowe's.
5228589	5230149	Lowe's is a big theater chain.
5230890	5232530	I don't know if they have any Lowe's here in California.
5232550	5233171	California!
5234111	5235351	I know what Lowe's is.
5236212	5238593	No, it's not Lowe's Hardware Store, it's Lowe's Theater Chain.
5240802	5250465	They are hosting a Ultimate Film Fan Contest, and for whatever reason, being an Ultimate Film Fan involves lots of Sony PlayStation 2 video games.
5251625	5260868	Because they will be having these local events going on where you can play Karaoke Revolution Vol.
5261128	5266350	2 and, get this, DDR Extreme before it comes out.
5268049	5270310	Before it comes out, you'll be able to play DDR Extreme.
5270930	5272751	And these are all happening on the East Coast.
5272831	5283657	It's going from Texas to Michigan to Jersey to New York, Massachusetts, Washington, that's about the closest it's going to get to here, Ohio, New York, Maryland, and Illinois.
5283697	5285577	And this is running from July through September.
5285658	5292641	So if you live in one of those areas, you want to get a jump on Extreme and you want to check it out and see what it's all about.
5294335	5296837	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5324501	5326563	But Mel B wants me to pass this along.
5327704	5333728	There will be a Konami booth at Comic-Con in San Diego this week, Thursday through Sunday.
5334349	5341054	At the booth will be the most recent demos of DDR Extreme and Ultramix 2 for PS2 and Xbox.
5341995	5344857	So what do you think that's going to mean we're going to have next week?
5346518	5347239	New song list!
5347279	5348820	Yeah, new song list.
5349000	5352803	So if you want to check out what some of the new songs on these demos are going to be,
5354865	5370800	Thursday through Sunday, Comic Con, San Diego Konami will also be doing contests and giveaways So California doesn't miss out completely You know, I wonder though, why do people always leave out my home state with this?
5371080	5374043	We need DDR contests in Alabama We do?
5374383	5379408	Yes People in the South play DDR too Skype line's open if you have a comment
5382535	5384517	Okay, we're going to leave out the Wayne's World jokes.
5386378	5386738	All right.
5388760	5399587	Well, we'll get into the FUs here a little bit, but I still am trying to figure out why a movie theater would just randomly have DDR, but then I kind of think back to the Metreon, how they have the DDR.
5399728	5399948	What?
5401149	5402550	What is Brad saying over there?
5402670	5402890	What?
5403891	5405972	We were making a joke about people calling.
5406032	5411256	Someone was breaking into the Blondie song, and I was doing the whole sex line thing.
5413255	5416176	Pick up the phone!
5416436	5417776	Does that only air in this area?
5417937	5419257	Or is that a nationwide commercial?
5419277	5420498	It's nationwide.
5420758	5422979	It's been on TV forever.
5424319	5426020	It's always on during Jerry Springer.
5426040	5428801	Pick up the phone!
5428981	5433623	I love when the Sci-Fi Channel used to do Saturday Night Anime, and then they changed it to Saturday Morning Anime.
5433963	5437285	And they always used to play those commercials in the commercial breaks.
5437505	5440386	So they got Anime, which is considered cartoons over here.
5440777	5441677	All right, we got a call.
5441917	5442377	We got a call.
5442417	5443438	Hey, don't interrupt me.
5443938	5444358	Can I finish?
5444378	5444718	Can I finish?
5444738	5445138	They can hold.
5445158	5445418	Can I finish?
5445438	5445898	They can hold.
5446578	5447079	Okay, I'm finished.
5448479	5449519	All right.
5449539	5450199	We got a caller.
5450239	5451680	You're on Orange Lounge.
5452340	5453760	I hope I'm not interrupting.
5454300	5455180	No, it's all right.
5455221	5455621	It's cool.
5455641	5456021	Who's that?
5456661	5457601	Hello again, Sky.
5457681	5458541	It's me, Siggy.
5458821	5459301	Hi, Siggy.
5459321	5459762	How you doing?
5460242	5460582	Yeah.
5460862	5461322	Got a comment?
5461994	5463775	Well, just the random stuff.
5463815	5471258	You know, in case you have any problems pronouncing Japanese titles or Japanese names, you know, don't hesitate to call me.
5471398	5475140	Which, by the way... You could ask me, but they never do.
5475200	5476741	Yeah, but you see, you're never here.
5477001	5477821	So I'm just kidding.
5478502	5479362	Excuse you!
5480042	5480983	I'm just kidding.
5482299	5483180	I just wanted to get the glare.
5483200	5486222	I think it's much funnier to hear Rob destroy the Japanese language.
5486242	5489484	Yeah, isn't it funnier to hear me stumble through it, though?
5490185	5494648	I think that's why Jamie doesn't bother to step in and correct me, because it's so much funnier when I fuck it up.
5495228	5497770	At least you're finally saying Sakura right, sort of.
5498130	5498731	Sakura?
5499511	5501693	Okay, you can shut up.
5501713	5507717	Dark Sakura says... Wait a minute, actually... Wait a minute, hold on.
5508137	5511620	I've been studying Japanese since I was nine years old, so...
5513907	5518469	All I can say is my accent is already 95% accurate.
5519010	5522132	Do you actually have Japanese in your blood, or have you just been otaku since birth?
5522692	5524833	Well, actually, I learned it by accident.
5525414	5527555	How'd that work?
5528296	5538202	Back in the Philippines, where I was actually born, there were a few channels, and then one of them is a Japanese learning show.
5539311	5540532	Learn how to speak Japanese.
5540632	5544613	That's where I got my accent and my grammar.
5545613	5546053	Interesting.
5548134	5548414	All right.
5548654	5551115	Cool.
5551255	5555916	Anything else you want to comment on besides your offer to correct me when I screw up, which is quite often?
5555936	5557377	Well, it's not really a screw up.
5557417	5560418	It's just, you know, if you're having fun.
5560578	5561078	Yeah, it is.
5562018	5563459	Oh, Rob, he's so funny.
5563519	5564479	He's so white.
5566260	5567100	Yes, he is.
5568761	5569121	Hello out there.
5569141	5569361	This is Rob.
5569381	5573103	But you might know me in the online world as Sky.
5597225	5602207	On June 23rd at 7pm Pacific Time, join DarkSakura and I for the Orange Lounge.
5602328	5609571	Also, that's actually grammatically incorrect because you don't use and I, it would be and me.
5609591	5609931	Whatever.
5627867	5629128	Woo!
5629148	5630468	Here come the grammar police.
5630568	5632809	Man, I'm double busted tonight.
5632869	5635470	I am like, because it's used as an object and not as a subject.
5635550	5637071	It was two years ago.
5637151	5637931	Give me a break.
5640312	5642053	It was when I was a radio amateur.
5642633	5648656	Did Kansai... Oh, dude, Kansai Ben is like so hot.
5648676	5651016	Just call me Ski.
5651137	5652237	Yeah, just call me Ski.
5652277	5653477	That pisses me off enough.
5653538	5653938	No, I'm kidding.
5653958	5654578	It doesn't piss me off.
5655250	5655490	Arigatou
5683206	5684327	Arigato.
5685588	5688991	You say arigato like we say arigato.
5692093	5693554	Right.
5693594	5695075	Sonny Chiba is the man.
5697237	5697797	What did he say?
5697817	5698618	I forget.
5698658	5701160	He's like... What did he say after that?
5701960	5703922	Very good!
5703942	5704142	Okay, um...
5710743	5713844	I think what we need to do is go into the FUs of the week.
5713864	5714624	What do you guys think?
5715024	5715444	Woohoo!
5715484	5716085	My favorite part!
5716185	5722807	Alright, remember, we only have a half hour show left, so let's try to keep this a relatively good length here.
5722867	5723727	So here we go.
5727368	5728488	Here we go, we're going to start it off.
5730089	5731149	DarkSakura, are you ready?
5731789	5733190	Yeah, I'm ready to be ranty.
5733310	5734470	DarkSakura, you ready to go?
5734918	5736800	Okay, you can... Where's the ferret?
5737521	5738922	Alright, what... Ow.
5739503	5741305	What do we do during the F-U's of the week?
5741405	5742967	We throw paper towels at Rob.
5748873	5750094	I already did.
5758376	5759537	Hey, I need that ferret.
5760157	5765100	Don't wipe it on your... F you to wiping the ferret on your ass, okay?
5766881	5767541	Throw it at Rob now.
5768862	5769723	Oh, eh.
5770383	5770823	Give me that.
5770903	5771364	Anyway.
5772604	5774005	You get that ferret thrown at your head.
5774906	5778168	Rob gets a ferret thrown at his head.
5778188	5779008	F you time.
5779188	5779829	Let's do it.
5780849	5782710	F you to all you people for distracting me.
5782810	5783071	Okay.
5783111	5783651	Ooh, ferrets.
5790400	5815795	Those people Anyway, F you to distracting me Because I've been so easily distracted all day And F you to being fatigued all damn day I'm trying to go out and spend a day with my fiance You know, spending money, which I consider highly romantic Because money is the way to win my heart Sex has nothing to do with it, it's money
5817941	5820083	No, money is a meme.
5821944	5824606	And sex is just the stuff that happens.
5826928	5828609	Sex is what you get when you give me money.
5828989	5831711	Hey, are you saying that I am a whore?
5833352	5834973	I didn't say anything, you just did.
5839156	5840657	Then Rob's the whore, that's it.
5840698	5842119	Yeah, that's the story of my life, anyway.
5844297	5846238	I'm really not that shallow, by the way, but still.
5846318	5857347	We were going out, we were going laser disc hunting today, because I found the Beauty and the Beast Work in Progress laser disc, which goes for like a hundred something dollars on eBay, for ten bucks last night.
5859268	5862271	And I was going back to buy more laser discs, and I
5864232	5880276	Anyway, I was getting so tired, and Dan's like, let's go to Tower Books, so I can sit in this chair and read a book about Pac-Man merchandise for an hour, while his poor, poor, poor suffering fiance has to go to the bathroom.
5881276	5882837	And there's no public bathroom at Tower Books.
5883497	5888898	So I'm here, okay Dan, hurry up, okay Dan, hurry up, okay Dan, hurry up, okay Dan, hurry up, and finally I'm like, get your ass out of the chair!
5888918	5891999	I have to go to the bathroom.
5892019	5892059	So...
5893166	5898971	It wasn't really like that, but we... Yeah, it was the Pulte emergency.
5900232	5901654	I was about to do the dance.
5902755	5911003	Anyway, another FU goes toward people who... SUV drivers in general.
5912028	5921133	There are, I have to say, a few people out there who know how to responsibly drive their vehicle and then there's everybody else who ruins it for the few who do.
5921973	5925335	You people do not need to be driving a vehicle that big, okay?
5925675	5937481	That's why I want my freakin' rebuilt Humvee with an assault rifle built onto it so I can gun your asses down and drive over you in my armored vehicle and not have you all in my way.
5939882	5941503	And I will stay in my lane
5942836	5944037	and abide by the speed limit.
5944837	5945137	Okay.
5947039	5949360	And my gun will be on a torrent, yeah?
5949980	5953282	So I can get the people who are trying to get behind me.
5954303	5955964	Aw, you tailgate my ass, you're dead too.
5956965	5959226	The road, okay, I just need my own road, okay?
5963168	5967091	I need the Jetson's car so that I don't have to deal with traffic.
5968111	5969132	I need my own jet.
5969352	5970313	Rob, I want a jet.
5970613	5971393	Maybe that's why I want a jet.
5971413	5972194	I'll make a note of that.
5975479	5982725	Another F you goes toward my schedule for being so damn busy this week that I haven't been able to get to the gym as much as I wanted to.
5982745	5983866	I was supposed to go running today.
5984786	5986708	I was up so late last night.
5987228	5990731	Another F you goes to insomnia because I have it really bad.
5991892	5999558	Another F you goes toward money for not having much of it, distance for it existing, and
6000589	6004233	Not being able to go where I want to go, or see who I want to see, or do what I want to do.
6005955	6018870	Another F you goes toward the general attitude in this state, because I'm getting really sick of it, and I really, really need to just get back to Alabama for a week so that I can be around people who are relatively polite and have good manners, at least to your face.
6021966	6028509	I just, it's just been kind of a, and it's going to be a crap, yeah, another FU to peak season at my job.
6029069	6037852	All of you people who are trying to go to school, and I guess that's including me, you know, try calling your financial aid office instead of calling me first.
6039013	6041053	Even though they probably don't know what they're doing.
6042074	6045275	Yeah, and a big FU goes to ARC's financial aid office.
6046872	6051995	Learn the freaking student aid process and tell it to other people.
6052295	6056517	If one of you is going to say something to somebody, make sure all of you are saying the same thing.
6056857	6062700	Instead of one person saying thing A, one person saying thing B, just stay on the right page.
6063060	6063960	Stay on the same page.
6064000	6065761	At least be consistent with your information.
6068382	6072324	And that's really, I guess, about it.
6072464	6073725	I've gotten the angst out.
6075306	6075886	They're currently...
6076710	6082573	I think the ferret likes it.
6084013	6085434	And I bet Rob doesn't know what I just said.
6086214	6087935	Yes, because I was saying goodbye to Brad.
6088155	6088915	Oh, bye Brad.
6089716	6090396	Bye.
6091216	6096318	Meanwhile, Loki's cock is just stiff and erect.
6096679	6097619	Half hour show, Jamie.
6098052	6099253	Half hour left in the show, Jamie.
6099293	6099933	Okay, I'm done?
6100133	6100393	All right.
6100553	6103394	I just said I was done and you were ignoring me.
6103474	6104035	Sorry, I think.
6104075	6104495	So, F you.
6104615	6104955	All right.
6105796	6107596	Moving on, uh, Logie's turn.
6107616	6112999	Oh, I forgot about that song.
6113219	6115700	Any... Okay.
6116360	6119962	Um, anyways, um, fuck you too, um...
6121738	6126162	to RadioShack because like if the computers break down you start to panic.
6126282	6128304	Aren't you supposed to be there to know how to fix things?
6129084	6130746	Yeah, I thought that's what RadioShack was.
6130786	6133628	Just fix things, sell me satellite dishes and cell phones.
6134029	6134629	Oh, and batteries.
6135430	6143037	Um, so you suck and F you to stupid SUV drivers because you suck and you can't drive your SUV.
6143077	6147581	You think it's like a race car or like a highly maneuverable car or...
6148081	6151487	A car that will just, you know, let go of the wheel and it will drive in the lane.
6151547	6153491	No, it's not a compact car.
6153991	6156295	Sorry, it's no, not a, um...
6157682	6158202	It just sucks.
6158542	6161543	Don't drive an SUV if you don't have kids or if you're driving alone.
6161963	6164444	You should have another car for driving when you're alone.
6164804	6166384	It should be a one person car.
6166744	6168625	Not this car that can hold 50 people.
6168965	6174126	You don't see bus drivers driving buses around aimlessly without anyone in there and parking in compact spaces.
6174226	6176207	I do not expect you to be doing the same.
6176607	6179508	So please, do not park your SUVs in compact spaces.
6180108	6180728	I don't like you.
6181898	6184120	and those stupid fuckers that park on the line.
6184580	6186742	Just because your tire's on the line does not count.
6187182	6188463	It needs to be in the line.
6188963	6193086	You know, I can't open my door when you're on the line and the person next to me is on the line.
6193467	6197289	Or over the line because your SUV's too big and you're parking in a compact space.
6198590	6200351	God, you people are so stupid.
6200392	6210219	You won't walk the extra few feet because, oh my god, all that SUV driving has gotten me tired and if I have to stand this heat for any longer, I'm gonna die!
6212237	6214998	Also, fuck you to stupid kids with laser pointers in movie theaters.
6215258	6215899	You're not funny.
6216499	6218820	And no, you cannot destroy the robots with laser pointers.
6219400	6220261	It just does not work.
6221981	6234667	Also, fuck you to stupid previews before movies, because, you know, that's just delaying my movie-watching time, and I really don't want to see another preview for The Manchurian Candidate.
6235127	6236208	I will not see that movie.
6236668	6237328	It's a remake.
6237448	6239529	If I wanted to see the movie, I'd watch the original.
6240069	6241470	Not with Denzel Washington.
6245867	6259395	And finally, finally, finally, um, fuck you to the goddamn people at Roundtable, because I go there to get a lunch buffet, and they have to be jackasses and go, I don't want to make pizzas for the buffet!
6259656	6262518	Well, don't offer a buffet if you don't want to make pizzas for the buffet!
6262898	6266080	And then you think you're so smart, I'm gonna make a vegetarian pizza!
6266640	6267261	Eh, I'm cool!
6268208	6271769	So I had to wait, you know, forever for them to make goddamn pizzas.
6271809	6273289	Just pop in a couple pepperonis.
6273510	6275830	They take less than a few seconds to make, okay?
6277011	6277831	And stop whining.
6278231	6280912	I mean, I swear to God, it's not like, you know, you're gonna be there forever.
6281792	6282332	And I'm done.
6284613	6285473	Alright, moving on.
6285513	6285953	My turn.
6289954	6292215	Uh, my FU goes to stress.
6292802	6295983	especially before this trip I have to take by myself.
6296364	6301386	I have a hard time going to the bathroom by myself, let alone having to travel back to the East Coast.
6301946	6303527	Don't give me a funny look when I say that, Aaron.
6303547	6307548	Girls go to the bathroom together all the time.
6309249	6310189	Oh, interesting.
6310930	6311230	You know...
6312173	6317734	I just, I don't, I'm really distressed about the trip, and yeah, but, you know, what can you do?
6319155	6328317	And F you to the fact that I'm going to miss all the good TV shows while I'm gone, because I do watch all my TV through BitTorrent, and I'm not going to be able to do that while I'm out.
6328477	6334398	And F you to the fact that I wasn't able to get a laptop for my trip, so I will have absolutely nothing to do at night, except masturbate.
6334898	6337879	But that's alright, because I'm going to get a lot of that done, so...
6340543	6343726	But Aaron, I can safely say I won't be thinking of you when I do it.
6346108	6349251	So allow me to be the first CDR male to tell you that.
6349431	6351253	I will not be thinking of you when I masturbate.
6351353	6353955	Oh, sometimes I wish Loki was my Doug 24-7.
6365376	6367438	I'll be thinking of that comment right there, yeah.
6367878	6370400	Right there.
6372802	6374724	It's a good thing you didn't hear it, DarkSakura.
6375304	6379588	And I had other FUs, but I forget what they were, so I guess we'll just move on.
6385432	6385953	I guess that's it.
6386073	6386693	Alright, moving on.
6387854	6390116	Let's hear from other folks in our studio right now.
6390156	6392398	We'll start it off with ViolentHyperGirl.
6393839	6394319	Hi!
6394640	6394840	Okay.
6395482	6400324	Um, F you to the stupid fanboys who publicly post on forums saying they want to have sex with me.
6400924	6401524	PLEASE!
6401704	6402765	KEEP IT TO YOURSELF!
6402825	6405006	IT'S A FUCKING PUBLIC FORUM!
6406266	6406806	Jesus.
6407307	6408607	Desperate people.
6409688	6413089	Dude, if you want sex that badly, go find a whore!
6417110	6419431	Or go masturbate or something!
6419511	6420872	And not to my routine!
6427996	6432838	My CBDL routine does not constitute as porn or masturbation fodder.
6435219	6442082	It should actually be illegal because I was under 18 at the time.
6442522	6443482	Pedophiles!
6447164	6450245	Second F you goes to Audio Taco at AX.
6450765	6451505	You smell.
6451825	6452786	Please shower.
6454313	6462460	It doesn't kill you to take like 10 minutes out of the day to shower, okay?
6463180	6465562	That's why people go to cons, is to not shower.
6466623	6469645	You're talking about the lobby boys, the ones who sleep in the lobby, right?
6471667	6473889	Or even the people with hotel rooms, I mean like...
6475310	6480994	For those who didn't hear Jamie's comment, she said, it's Anime Expo, what are they going to miss?
6481034	6481555	The sucking?
6500017	6505600	And honestly, you have no chance with any girl, Japanese or Asian or white.
6506120	6508281	You don't fucking shower.
6509001	6512263	Dude, you know, you might raise your chances just a little bit.
6512623	6513944	Just a little fucking bit.
6514704	6517365	Now, now, last fan of Akana, I saw boob.
6519646	6520867	What was that from?
6521007	6524349	Real boob, not fake boob, not drawn boob, real boob.
6524709	6525969	What was that from?
6526330	6526750	My boob.
6528339	6530841	What was that from the fat Mai that was walking around?
6537905	6540447	But yeah, please, don't suffocate us.
6543169	6546131	Another SU goes out to physics, for obvious reasons.
6546251	6547732	I don't have to really state why.
6548993	6550954	Yeah, just physics.
6551695	6558219	Another SU goes out to being sick, but I honestly kind of don't care because I was helping out a friend who was sick.
6559957	6565101	So, I knew what I was putting myself out in front of, so I kind of accepted the responsibility for getting myself picked.
6566983	6567523	So, yeah.
6570246	6580174	And, um, let's see, I can't really think of anything else other than the fanboy issue, which I could go off on for hours and hours at a time.
6581715	6583617	Yeah, but, uh, yeah, I think we can move on.
6588937	6589898	Moving on, Jonas.
6589918	6592181	Hold on, let me touch the car first.
6596917	6599099	Okay, I'm sorry about that, I'm sorry about that.
6599579	6607943	Okay, the first F he goes to in Zuma of 469 for almost screwing my tournament up in June 25th and the 26th.
6608343	6610845	Who the hell do you think you are trying to control my tournament?
6611465	6614827	Who the hell do you think you are saying, ooh, the pet detailer doesn't work?
6615567	6618129	Well, get used to the fucking pads.
6618229	6622771	These are the best damn pads out there in Sacramento, in case you haven't been there, Sky.
6623812	6624192	I haven't.
6625203	6625843	Okay.
6627664	6632827	And quit your whining about for one and a half hours you delayed the whole tournament.
6632867	6634047	Everyone was bitching at me.
6635428	6639810	Those pads are so squeaky clean that I can see Aaron's image in them.
6640150	6640530	Oh yeah.
6641091	6641551	Oh yeah.
6642711	6643632	Oh yeah, right there.
6643652	6643952	Oh man.
6643972	6647234	Sorry, Jonas.
6652680	6661244	Okay, the next interview goes to this bitch at work, well not, well it says some bitch customer, who's saying, OI!
6661444	6668588	You're a freakin', I'm a good woman and you're just a fuckin' worker just getting minimum wage.
6668788	6672389	Who the fuck do you think you are calling me a low-class person?
6673390	6679933	First of all, second of all, we kicked everybody out of the track because, this is during my previous island as I worked there, this,
6680666	6682527	First of all, your kids can't drive for shit.
6682547	6683888	This has no bumping.
6684589	6686650	And you're accusing my ass trying to get me fired?
6687431	6688672	Well, fuck you.
6690293	6692495	So I'm gonna kick your ass if I have the chance.
6692515	6696278	I have a whip on my car, all spiked up in braids.
6697999	6699000	Does it have braids, Aaron?
6701722	6702502	They could, eh?
6702862	6703543	How long is the whip?
6706448	6706788	Damn!
6707589	6716314	Okay, and I'll give another F you guys to someone who spiked up my freakin' strawberry daiquiri drink.
6717255	6722479	You put a hell of vodka in it!
6722499	6727142	No, I mean, there's no strawberry daiquiri in it, they put like some nasty type of vodka in it.
6727522	6731384	I know it's kind of, it's not the Smirnoff version, it's like some other vodka.
6731404	6735187	I accidentally spit that out in front of my parents and stuff.
6736158	6749808	while eating a delicate dinner during the cruise and I see to my skin because when one side is hella dark and the other is hella white no matter how many times I go to the pool it still remains the same thing oh really?
6751940	6754482	Okay, I'm kind of heated up a little bit.
6756303	6760125	Yeah, FU for time being wasted for my other FUs.
6760365	6761906	I'll continue the FUs next week.
6761986	6762686	Alright, Puppy.
6763307	6764467	I said two weeks, two weeks, sorry.
6764587	6766228	Yeah, don't forget next week won't be here.
6768049	6768350	Puppy.
6768830	6769130	Okay.
6769950	6771551	Okay, since time is short, I'll make this quick.
6772912	6781197	Fuck school, fuck my car, fuck funerals, fuck the funeral across the street, fuck the number zero when it's alone, and, um,
6783255	6786499	Suck the mold, and fuck my refrigerator.
6786599	6786899	That's all.
6786919	6790703	Alright, let's get to our chatroom FUs then.
6790823	6791964	Here we go.
6792084	6793686	Started off with Dark Knight.
6794487	6798991	Dark Knight says, let me start with a big FU, and that's for my car to go kerplunk on me.
6799072	6801013	Ended up having to catch a ride to work for the weekend.
6801554	6805218	Another for being a broke-ass mofo, and finally work, that is all.
6807951	6811732	DDR Angel says, F you to Skype for freezing while trying to run on my system.
6812252	6817093	F you to QRO for giving me sprite errors and other continuous errors spontaneously while I'm trying to play.
6818413	6819253	I want to play.
6819793	6823294	F you to feeling like I'm fully packed but then thinking I'm still going to forget something.
6823354	6824274	Meh, I guess I'm done.
6824514	6828955	And I can sympathize with thinking you're packed when you're not because I'm having that same problem right now.
6830415	6832936	Vid Palace says, F you to this horrible retainer.
6833016	6835076	I can't say anything coherently when I have it on.
6835865	6836425	You know what?
6836545	6836986	Too bad.
6837026	6837786	You had braces.
6837926	6838887	You have the retainer now.
6839327	6840207	Deal with it.
6840247	6841028	We all had to.
6841428	6841688	Yep.
6842028	6842409	Screw it.
6842449	6844189	I stopped wearing my retainer after three months.
6844770	6845990	And look at me now.
6847952	6849652	I got all three of my teeth.
6852114	6855075	Flerone says, F you to the official PS2 headset.
6855395	6858497	I got Karaoke Revolution this weekend and the headphones are crappy.
6858917	6861659	The Xbox headset is actually decently sturdy.
6864215	6868859	I actually thought the KR one was a little better, but, you know, potato potato.
6868919	6871220	VXJasonXV says, my one and only FU.
6871701	6878506	FU to people who show up almost an hour after the tournament was scheduled to start and starting about one and a quarter hours late.
6879086	6880908	Oh, and Rychan is passing one along too.
6881128	6884250	FU to other girls who repeatedly try to hang all over your boyfriend.
6884711	6886712	Even more so when it's right in front of you.
6887713	6894018	Then that's when, you know, you just take your hand and ask them what the five fingers said to the face
6895748	6896208	That's hot.
6898029	6901670	EvilNowQ2DX says, F you to Noria for singing Sylvia Drive.
6901690	6903871	That song's been in my head for the past four days.
6904591	6907312	Oh, and one F you to commercials before movies.
6908113	6908593	I agree.
6909293	6909733	F you to the 20.
6910773	6911534	Fuck that shit.
6913374	6914095	Fuck the 20.
6916295	6917496	I got 20 for you right here.
6918389	6922611	John Field says, I guess my only FU is that connection was too short.
6923272	6931015	Oh, and FU to claiming that Mega Man Anniversary Collection has remixed music when all it's using are the music tracks from Power Fighters slash Battles.
6931195	6932116	Oh, interesting.
6933196	6933897	It does have remixed music.
6934397	6936298	I thought it was the overclocked one.
6936318	6937559	There was a bunch of remixes.
6937619	6939580	If you change it to Navi mode, it's all remixed music.
6940720	6941260	Interesting.
6943826	6945688	Alright, that's all the FUs right now.
6946128	6949991	Some folks wanted to comment on some convention things you were talking about, Aaron.
6950011	6953474	So I'm going to open the Skype line back up since we only have a few minutes left in the show anyway.
6954135	6956437	Maybe some folks have comments on who knows what else.
6957558	6960360	So we're just going to kind of finish up the show with a little bit of that.
6961801	6963763	Yeah, I think there was some Anime Expo commentaries.
6964063	6965484	Somebody wanted to add.
6966485	6970008	I've only ever been to like one anime convention in my entire life.
6970609	6970909	Ditto.
6972179	6973700	And it wasn't Anime Expo, it was a little one.
6974060	6974541	Alright, here it is.
6974601	6975181	It's Richie.
6975221	6977963	Richie wants to... Richie's back on the Skype line.
6977983	6982607	He wants to talk to us about an Anime Expo story I think that Aaron brought up.
6982667	6983548	So what's up, Richie?
6985069	6986110	Hey, nothing much.
6986150	6990053	Just a couple of horror stories from AnimeCon this year.
6990073	6997278	Um... Well, yeah, just... Okay, what do you want to tell us about?
6998339	6998419	Um...
7000171	7002713	Well, buddy, hey, buddy, you're skipping up a little bit there.
7004294	7006515	Stop your torrents and stop your Winamp for a second.
7006795	7007296	See if that helps.
7007336	7009097	I don't know what the hell's wrong with my connection.
7009217	7009517	All right.
7010058	7010758	We can hear you now.
7010818	7011138	What's up?
7011278	7011558	Okay.
7011999	7018463	Well, I just want to say that, yeah, a lot of the guys there didn't know what the hell the concept of a shower meant, so it stinks like high heaven over there.
7018483	7021545	At least my roommates still were like... Sorry.
7021585	7022326	...every day and stuff.
7022346	7022906	Don't worry about it.
7023701	7029543	And other than that, well, other than, you know, like, stinky idiots, you get drunken idiots, too, who ruin everything.
7029904	7038247	I don't know if you heard about this, but, uh, on Saturday night, Sunday morning, we had to close down the convention center, because, uh... I was there, that, I was there.
7038767	7040888	That was the toilet, didn't you remember what happened, right?
7041028	7050952	Yeah, somebody, somebody, what happened that night, for people who don't know, um, in the arcade, in, uh, the Fanime 2004 convention, somebody decided to, like, blow up the toilet.
7051710	7080332	and ended up flooding that whole second floor of the convention center so they had to close the arcade down which is like almost the only thing to do in the middle of the night save for like the video rooms yeah and uh if I can add to that I was staffing the arcade during that shift so like they had me pull they had me pull con security you remember you remember how tired I looked Erin yeah they took all the arcade um workers and uh what they did was that they made them work security to make sure nobody went into the upper area
7081718	7083139	and you saw how tired I was.
7083199	7087601	I mean, I was up listening to Nami Tamaki for like how many hours straight.
7087681	7093625	Yeah, actually at Fatime too, they played the same Nami Tamaki CD for all four days.
7093845	7094645	All four days.
7094725	7095225	It was hell.
7095305	7097727	I mean, I was starting to sing along to it.
7098047	7099028	It was crazy.
7099048	7101309	Other than that though...
7102880	7110847	Oh, and if I could put in a plug for another con that's coming up, Chinatown Anime Fair in San Francisco is coming up September 11th and 12th.
7111567	7112788	Ten bucks to be registered.
7113208	7116091	Go over to JTAF.com to pre-reg.
7116231	7118372	It's going to be pretty cool.
7120414	7121535	Check out the site.
7122115	7124217	We've got a few guests of honor you might want to check out.
7125038	7125878	And hope to see you all there.
7127279	7128020	Alright, sounds good.
7128040	7129641	We've got to get going, Richie, but thanks for the call.
7129961	7130542	Yeah, no problem.
7130602	7131262	I'll see you guys later.
7131403	7131843	Take care, bud.
7132577	7135340	All right, so that's about it.
7135360	7136801	We've got to start wrapping up the show here.
7137041	7140524	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Jonas.
7144328	7145088	Okay, Erin.
7146389	7156018	Oh, well, the thing, oh, I just wanted to add one thing that really, really sucked about Anime Expo was that I guess since the con's been held there for so long,
7157834	7162517	They well knew about the BO, so what they did was they turned the AC on really, really high.
7163217	7168521	So if you walked through the convention center at night, it was at least 65 degrees in there, if not lower.
7170602	7171383	No sweat, no BO.
7171443	7172884	Final thought from Puppy.
7174745	7178887	Yeah, Loki's cock really is big, isn't it?
7178947	7181129	Jonas, do or die, final thought.
7181189	7182210	It tastes very good, too.
7185231	7185952	Loki, final thought.
7186952	7189753	I'm taking that cock back to work and I'm leaving it there.
7193975	7197296	My final thought is listen to the Bomani Music and More program.
7197316	7202478	We need people to whore up our listening hours because our ratings have been dropping and that makes me sad.
7203839	7204839	Jamie, final thought?
7205060	7206080	Tastes great, less filling.
7208345	7209366	Last word of the show.
7209547	7211009	Erin really wants it, so why not?
7212531	7214614	One word that sums it all up.
7215235	7217598	Erin, what is tonight's... Well, hold on.
7217618	7219000	I've got to make sure our outro is ready to go.
7219401	7222145	Erin, what is tonight's final word?
7222906	7223387	Movies!
7225359	7228361	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7228922	7232265	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
7232865	7238069	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

7245375	7248838	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
7249679	7251661	I have not had sex in almost two years.
7252896	7255837	And I think once you hit two years, you automatically get your virginity back.
7258158	7259078	You get to start over.
7259499	7260159	And I'm about to.
7260299	7261319	What is wrong with me?
7261399	7262280	I don't understand.
7265081	7266842	I'm just going to have to trick somebody into doing it.
7269302	7270163	Use trickery.
7272684	7275505	I'm going to have to cover with leaves and hope somebody falls in.
7289056	7290317	That's going to be the only way!
7292458	7294460	I think I would be really hot if I didn't talk.
7294640	7295340	That's my problem.
7295360	7297582	I just have a big mouth and I just say the wrong things.
7297682	7298823	But, I don't know.
7299323	7300004	Like, it's weird.
7300044	7300564	I try.
7300744	7303086	I have one pickup line, which never works.
7303366	7303987	This is what I do.
7304327	7306809	If I'm at a club and I see a guy that I like, I'll smile.
7306929	7308510	And if he smiles back, I feel comfortable.
7308810	7313133	And when I feel really comfortable, I'll walk over and I'll say, Stick it in!
7326781	7329802	So, as you know by now, I'm Korean.
7331123	7332524	I don't have a store or anything.
7342368	7343148	Well, not anymore.
7347010	7347890	I look very Korean.
7347910	7349531	I have very typically Korean features.
7349591	7353573	I look like one of those girls that you would see in a Korean grocery store on a calendar.
7355228	7356829	Holding a box of soy milk.
7361392	7362372	Drink by the soy.
7362432	7363533	It's good for you.
7373078	7373979	I have a Korean name.
7374179	7379962	My Korean name is Moran, which is a pretty name, but you have to understand I've heard my mother scream it from across the hills.
7380783	7381123	Moran!
7385396	7386757	Moran!
7388940	7389180	What?
7391482	7392543	I'm sure you can relate.
7394325	7405437	When I get famous enough, I want to have my own fragrance and have it be called Moran and have the ads be old Asian women coming out of French doors like in the Ego East ad.
7407319	7407539	Moran!
7416423	7417584	Don't you think that's sexy?
7417604	7419686	It's just, it's so hot.
7424450	7426972	My mother is convinced that everybody in show business does drugs.
7428033	7431176	She's like, oh, you cannot go to the club because they take the drugs.
7435420	7437902	The people, they take the cocaine.
7439363	7441786	And then they take the D, what is it, the D, the L, the D, the D.
7443070	7444111	Mom, it's LSD.
7444371	7445071	How do you know that?
7453055	7455316	My mother has a problem with blind intersections.
7455376	7458318	She will sit there for a very long time and rant.
7458838	7460519	They never give you a chance!
7476980	7481761	So since I was about 10 years old, almost all of my friends have been gay men.
7483161	7487422	And my mother would give me phone messages from them when they would call me when I lived at home.
7489142	7491863	Um, Scott called.
7493723	7494903	Is he the gay?
7495063	7496744	Is he the gay?
7499969	7502191	Well, godmom, I don't know if he's THE gay.
7504854	7506896	That's a lot of pressure to be THE gay.
7508558	7509919	All of that resting on one guy.
7512502	7515545	He has to do the parade all by himself.
7525766	7526427	I'm here!
7526947	7527788	I'm queer!
7529889	7530910	I guess I'm the only one.
7535113	7538476	My parents are very conservative, but surprisingly gay positive.
7538816	7543480	In the late 70s, we owned a bookstore in San Francisco on Polk Street, which then was a huge gay mecca.
7543860	7547362	And my mother, for some reason, was in charge of the gay pornography section.
7553214	7556983	So every day as we walk over there, I don't know why we have this booth!
7576303	7582785	The most harrowing experience I ever had with my mother was one time I wanted to go see this movie with my friends and she would not let me go with my friends.
7582825	7583525	She had to come with me.
7584005	7588326	So I had to go see The Wall with my mom.
7590447	7593648	Halfway through the movie, somebody actually passed her a joint.
7596749	7597529	What is this?
7597949	7600730	I don't know why they give this to me.
7600750	7602170	That's so... I... I...
7619028	7622770	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
7623391	7630756	That's what I would play for anybody who wants to know what Margaret Cho is all about because that just sums it all up right in there.
7648877	7652160	Okay, we are in the afterbirth, and we'll open up the Skype line for any calls.
7652180	7656704	I think there were a couple people that missed the chance to call during the show, so we'll give them a chance right now if they want to call in.
7656724	7657244	But guess what?
7657284	7658005	You can't talk to me.
7658045	7658185	Bye.
7658845	7659045	Oh, why?
7659086	7659446	You leaving?
7659526	7659886	I'm leaving.
7660126	7660887	Alright, bye, Jamie.
7660907	7661447	Bye.
7661487	7662909	Thanks for coming, of course, as always.
7664350	7667052	So, Studio Dark... I feel a little warm.
7667412	7670175	We're going to be in Studio Dark Sakura next week, right?
7670275	7671135	Shut up, Rob.
7672156	7674859	If we can fit people in there, because there's a bunch of boxes.
7676240	7677701	Jamie's got a lot of boxes.
7678442	7684345	Okay, we've been, we had to take all of the boxes out of Dan's mom's garage when she moved.
7684585	7684885	Uh-huh.
7685005	7686706	So we have them all piled up in the upstairs room.
7687226	7690708	And the downstairs is taken up by pole position cabinets for the main machine.
7691388	7691688	Fine.
7691708	7693329	So, we'll have to be creative.
7693369	7696871	People are going to have to sit on boxes and sit on the floor, but we'll be able to do it.
7697071	7698532	Well, I'm going to miss everybody next week.
7698792	7700493	I'll miss you too, but my aim's improving.
7700753	7701133	Shut up.
7702693	7704714	I wish I had Skype in Pennsylvania.
7704994	7707755	Well, not that you've got the Skype thing set up, but we'll get it set up sometime.
7707775	7711276	Not on the show, but I can't get it to work with the broadcaster I use.
7711436	7713957	Yeah, that's the only reason we can do it now is because I'm using a different broadcaster.
7713977	7715217	You're going to have to show me how to do that.
7715257	7717058	I might have to work that out someday.
7717718	7721719	I like the other broadcaster because I can talk over music where my sound card doesn't normally let me do that.
7723120	7724620	Stupid piece of crap, Vio.
7725601	7726221	Anyway, I'm going.
7726261	7726381	Bye.
7726735	7727275	Bye-bye!
7727535	7727995	Have a good one!
7750936	7752497	Hey Sky, this is John Fields.
7752697	7753538	Hey, what's up?
7754279	7754899	Not much.
7756300	7758122	I'd just like to say a couple of words.
7758202	7759984	I went to my first... Alright, that's it.
7760024	7760684	That was a couple of words.
7760804	7761285	No, I'm kidding.
7761345	7761665	I'm kidding.
7761685	7762005	What's up?
7764047	7766969	I went to my first anime convention this weekend, actually.
7767230	7769351	It was held right on my campus, actually.
7770592	7770973	Really?
7771653	7772454	And what was that all about?
7773750	7781896	It was Kineticon, and it was a really fun experience, but I think I kind of blew it on the anime, because I really didn't actually go to see any screenings.
7781976	7784278	I was stuck playing video games the whole time.
7786120	7787401	What kind of video games were going on there?
7788641	7791023	I actually got to play Papa Music for the first time there.
7793625	7794266	How did you like it?
7794846	7796027	It was a very fun game.
7796167	7801271	It makes me want to pick up the controller and play it at home or something like that.
7801849	7802770	It's a fun game to have.
7802870	7803411	You should pick it up.
7804653	7805514	Alright, thanks for calling.
7805554	7805874	Take care.
7807156	7808297	Call during the show sometime.
7808798	7809719	Sure, no problem.
7809859	7810099	Later.
7811900	7814082	We missed a call in there.
7814102	7817364	There's no call waiting.
7817384	7820306	Yeah, there's no call waiting or anything and I can't conference thing or anything.
7820346	7824969	So I have to remember to put it back in Do Not Disturb or else everybody will call at once.
7825330	7826791	Which is of course what always happens.
7826831	7828172	You sit there and you wait forever.
7829332	7835617	Remember guys, if you want to call, just get on the Skype line and give us a call and then everybody will call at once.
7836818	7837278	It's crazy.
7837802	7838802	Oh well, what can you do?
7839543	7844784	I'll leave it up in a few more minutes, and then I'm going to pull the plug for... We got the time.
7845565	7845885	What's that?
7846885	7848846	I finished the wiring on my main cabinet.
7850566	7854388	Meaning, all I got to do is plug shit together, and we'll be good to go.
7856208	7857268	And the TV, and yeah.
7859029	7862330	Alright, well, I think we are going to... Oh, here comes another call.
7862930	7864731	What's up, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
7865882	7866162	Hello?
7866462	7866742	Hello?
7866782	7867402	It's Ton!
7867742	7868022	Oh no.
7868783	7869003	Hey?
7869023	7869743	Hey.
7870263	7870583	What's up?
7870623	7871143	Who's this?
7872183	7872583	Uh, hi.
7873763	7874103	Hi.
7875624	7876544	Oh, crap.
7876624	7876964	Hold on.
7877284	7881845	Yeah, first rule of radio, turn down the radio when you're on the radio.
7882285	7882745	That's alright.
7882965	7883725	Well, oops.
7883945	7884545	We're all learning.
7884585	7886506	Hey, it's amateur radio on our end.
7886626	7887926	We expect it to be on your end too.
7887966	7888326	What's up?
7889246	7889986	Eh, nothing much.
7890026	7891006	Just wanted to say hi.
7891166	7891607	Who is this?
7892607	7893827	Uh, Ton Dork.
7894841	7895381	Dork!
7895562	7896703	Dork.
7896883	7903888	Unfortunately, the Skype doesn't let me type four characters in my name, so I had to type Mr. Urkel, which is my LJ name.
7904969	7906090	That's a good name, though.
7906110	7907191	He was a dork.
7907431	7907791	It fits.
7908512	7909032	Yeah, it fits.
7909473	7909813	It works.
7909833	7910474	Yeah, well, hey.
7910934	7911294	So what's up?
7911314	7913296	Did you have a comment on anything for tonight's show or anything?
7914617	7915117	Not much.
7915958	7919401	I want to ask Puppy how he thinks of Destiny.
7919441	7920582	You're asking me that again?
7921461	7922982	Hey, you requested it.
7923262	7923963	No, I didn't.
7924303	7925183	Yes, you did.
7925243	7926704	She specifically said that.
7927705	7928665	When did she say that?
7929706	7931707	Check her last LJ post.
7933048	7934008	Ooh, LJ drama.
7937030	7938371	One of our friends.
7940912	7941713	I see, LJ drama.
7941773	7942513	Oh, that's a good chance.
7942733	7945155	Hey, there's a good segue for me to plug the LiveJournal.
7945956	7947477	LiveJournal Community, Orange Lounge.
7947678	7948518	All one word right there.
7948919	7951381	And no drama on our community, unfortunately.
7951861	7957947	But if you look at the friends page with all our members, you can get plenty of drama from all their journals.
7958087	7958727	It's fabulous.
7959408	7962090	It's really good for killing time to read up on LiveJournal drama.
7962170	7962451	Yeah.
7964012	7964392	All right.
7964432	7965693	Well, thanks for giving the show a call.
7967255	7967815	Later, Dork.
7967835	7969116	Yeah, call during the show sometime.
7969897	7970698	All right.
7970838	7971078	Later.
7972139	7972920	See you Skype is fun.
7972940	7973080	Click.
7973919	7976019	Yeah, I like the little clicky noise it makes when we hang up on people.
7977560	7978060	All right.
7979640	7980320	I guess that's it.
7982621	7983221	We're out of here.
7983821	7985221	I'm kind of done with tonight's show.
7985521	7986982	I'll leave this open a few more minutes.
7987042	7989942	I know Angel was really trying to get through, and I don't know what happened, but yeah.
7990762	8003205	I'll be uploading my two new remixes, the Ecstasy one and the Room of Angels one, probably tonight, actually, for other reasons.
8004657	8006958	You want to be able to let our listeners download it, right?
8007018	8008318	That's the number one reason.
8008758	8010999	Yeah, they can listen to it before everyone else.
8011219	8011859	Exactly.
8012839	8014760	Alright, I'm going to set up a post-show here right now.
8015480	8017480	You know, this was really popular last week.
8017500	8020561	We played some stuff from the Ministry of Sound Compilation, the annual.
8020581	8023782	So I'm going to do that again, except we only got through disc one last week.
8023802	8025823	So I'm going to just go ahead and start it off with disc two tonight.
8026923	8027403	Oh, excuse me.
8029503	8030424	I know, I'm turning into Aaron here.
8031894	8034575	It's so lovely when it's sunny
