[SPEAKER_12]: The cornerstone of any nutritious practice.

2
00:00:03,411 --> 00:00:04,711
[SPEAKER_12]: That was huge.

3
00:00:05,752 --> 00:00:06,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

4
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:10,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

5
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:11,434
[SPEAKER_28]: That's right.

6
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,476
[SPEAKER_28]: The only thing you're going to be riding is me.

7
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:16,316
[SPEAKER_28]: Have you seen Malcolm?

8
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:16,717
[SPEAKER_28]: Lena?

9
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:20,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

10
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:21,719
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was you.

11
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:23,652
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to expose you.

12
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:24,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

13
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:26,094
[SPEAKER_00]: So I choose to expose myself.

14
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, they're our ladies' presents.

15
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:30,277

[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura.

17
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:34,020

00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,101
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go, yes.

35
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:21,647
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't let me counsel anybody.

36
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,708
[SPEAKER_31]: My advice will be, get a gun.

37
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:27,048
[SPEAKER_31]: Get a gun.

38
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:34,410
[SPEAKER_18]: I lost the whole script and the whole computer upgrade thing, so I had to just rewrite it just now.

39
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,510
[SPEAKER_31]: Ew.

40
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,650
[SPEAKER_18]: I like this camp theme we've got going.

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,031
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait till you hear this next line, okay?

42

00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:40,851
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

44
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,111
[SPEAKER_31]: I hated camp.

45
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:43,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:51,683
[SPEAKER_11]: You so ripped that off from In Living Color.

49
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:52,324
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't care.

50
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:53,985

00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,635
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have a fancy stage last name, though.

57
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:12,135
[SPEAKER_18]: You want one?

58
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:12,976
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

59
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:14,957
[SPEAKER_18]: What can we give Neil as a last name?

60
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:19,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Neil, I'll let our chat room think about that one.

61
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:23,751
[SPEAKER_18]: You can join our chat room, www.orangeslawntrader.com.

62
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we have not been here for like three weeks now.

63
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:29,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie hasn't been here in a month.

64
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,282
[SPEAKER_29]: That's because I had shit to do.

65
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:39,488
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I have a friend who was at UCSD for like six years in the math program of all things.

66
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:41,930
[SPEAKER_31]: How could I pass up her graduation party?

67
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,212
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that was the week we ended up not having a show anyway.

68
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:45,433
[SPEAKER_18]: You were gone the week before also.

69
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:47,975
[SPEAKER_31]: The week before I was being a lusty wench.

70
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, that's right.

71
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,639
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember that now because we were making fun of the Ren Faire on the show while you weren't here.

72
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,944
[SPEAKER_31]: I was like, I had a good time at the Ren Faire but they didn't have any meat and it pissed me off.

73
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,206
[SPEAKER_18]: But you have meat now, right?

74
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:01,707
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

75
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:02,628
[SPEAKER_31]: Mead.

76
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:03,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, mead.

77
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:04,189
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought you said meat.

78
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:05,069
[SPEAKER_31]: Brewed honey.

79
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, never mind.

80
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I have a dick in my ear.

81
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:10,254
[SPEAKER_31]: Well.

82
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:14,477
[SPEAKER_31]: You know they have surgery for that, Rob.

83
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:17,599
[SPEAKER_18]: All that TMI and plenty more when we come back.

84
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,742
[SPEAKER_18]: There's like three weeks of ranting to catch up on.

85
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:22,804
[SPEAKER_18]: So much Bomani news.

86
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:23,324
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, yes.

87
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really.

88
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:28,283
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, basically, I could wrap it up right here.

89
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:29,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Funny news.

90
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,046
[SPEAKER_13]: They have plenty of funny news.

91
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:34,669
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR was in the media because somebody lost weight.

92
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:35,450
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

93
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,311
[SPEAKER_18]: There's more than that.

94
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,213
[SPEAKER_26]: DDR was in the media because somebody had a heart attack.

95
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:40,494
[SPEAKER_18]: You're right, there's more than that.

96
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:46,400
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be talking about that when we come back after this set of just some DDR music I wanted to play.

97
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:51,440
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'll be back and we'll get started with the catching up.

98
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:56,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell everybody you know, Orange Lounge is back on the air and we're taking names.

99
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:56,732
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

100
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:30,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

101
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:09,003
I'm a veteran now, which means that I've been in the game too long Since the day that they prevented me way back when

108
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,270
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what was going on last night?

109
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:56,393
[SPEAKER_18]: I was playing with this new software program because I've been looking for stuff for... You made a promo?

110
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:58,454

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know.

118
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up, Loki.

119
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,152
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I put some effort out.

120
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,772
[SPEAKER_31]: I was like, what the hell was that?

121
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,494
[SPEAKER_31]: OMG WTF BBQ.

122
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:22,797
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, okay, I've been playing with some new toys for Diversion because... Okay, let's back this up a little bit.

123
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:23,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's back it up.

124
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:27,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, you might have heard, I got a new kind of computer thing going on.

125
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,861
[SPEAKER_18]: I finally put in the stuff that Squeenix gave me at E3 when I won the Ballista thing.

126
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:37,644
[SPEAKER_18]: And I put them in a couple weeks ago, and of course that's what caused the show to not be here a couple weeks ago.

127
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:51,719
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's given me some time to like play with some new things install some new software that didn't run good before and one of them is like this Mixing program that I was thinking about using for diversion because I thought would be really cool to have like the Bomani music Remixed remixes mixing together.

128
00:09:51,979 --> 00:10:00,921
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought be pretty cool, but unfortunately the software had problems of its own But it sounds really really good if you have like these short like 10-second promos like stringing the music together and

129
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:04,423
[SPEAKER_18]: So I made a bunch of like, well not a bunch, but like three quickie little promos.

130
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:04,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Little bumpers.

131
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,205
[SPEAKER_18]: Little bumpers, exactly.

132
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:06,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Little bumpers.

133
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:07,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Mini bumpers.

134
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:09,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really promos, but mini bumpers.

135
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:13,190
[SPEAKER_14]: But since... The buggy baby... Shut up.

136
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,273
[SPEAKER_18]: Rubber baggy... Baggy Bumani bumpers.

137
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:18,633
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

138
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,274
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'll play some more of those tonight.

139
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:23,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Because now, that program fucking sucked.

140
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:26,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Because after about 30 minutes and all my audio starts skipping.

141
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:27,235
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can't use it.

142
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:32,016
[SPEAKER_18]: So now I have those little rubber baby Bomani bumpers and nothing to use them for.

143
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:33,837
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'll play them tonight.

144
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Because everybody bitches that we never have new promos.

145
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,098
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you get those.

146
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:41,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

147
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:46,580
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I guess we have to start this episode off with a bit of an apology.

148
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:48,686
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, we had lives.

149
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:50,187
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

150
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'm finding some apology music here.

151
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:56,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Because as you may or may not know, this is our first show.

152
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,608
[SPEAKER_18]: When was episode 101?

153
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,109
[SPEAKER_18]: I would have to get out a calendar to look.

154
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,950
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

155
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,130
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't find that song that quick.

156
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was before my birthday.

157
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:08,411
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember that much.

158
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:09,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Or was it?

159
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:10,052
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

160
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:10,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It was before.

161
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:12,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was the week before my birthday.

162
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:14,213
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would have been like the 18th or something.

163
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,833
[SPEAKER_18]: So gosh, we got a lot of ground to cover.

164
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so we're going to play some apology music here.

165
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,705
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm looking for it.

166
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:22,286
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.

167
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:25,628
[SPEAKER_18]: This is some nice little gothy apology music.

168
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:40,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear listeners of Orange Lounge Radio, we offer our condolences and Jamie's hairball for not being live for the past two weeks.

169
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:45,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie offers her special condolences for not being here for the past three weeks.

170
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:56,992
[SPEAKER_18]: She's missed you all dearly But my aim is improving And she coughs up this hairball especially for you It tastes like tri-tip You see

171
00:11:58,123 --> 00:12:08,856
[SPEAKER_18]: What we decided to do two weeks ago was for you, the listener, we decided to upgrade our boards and studios so that we could have faster and better audio for those of you guys.

172
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,678
[SPEAKER_18]: And plus I would have much less headache running the show.

173
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,103
[SPEAKER_18]: So we let our tech master Loki, I'm going to blame it on him, upgrade the computer.

174
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:16,344
[SPEAKER_29]: Blame it on Squinnix.

175
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:18,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Blame it on Microsoft.

176
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:22,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, well, I can't really blame it on Microsoft because we were using Piratey Cup.

177
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, no, no, he meant a pirate's treasure that we found.

178
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:31,773
[SPEAKER_29]: A photocopy.

179
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, a photocopy.

180
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:36,955
[SPEAKER_18]: So basically, we started to upgrade the computer around what, noon?

181
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:38,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Thinking we'd have plenty of time to do it?

182
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:43,018
[SPEAKER_18]: And how many times did we have to install different versions of Windows XP?

183
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,080
[SPEAKER_14]: About six.

184
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, see, Rob's computer is what we like to call in the industry, old.

185
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:53,343
[SPEAKER_14]: And it did not like anything that you did to it.

186
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,564
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very cranky.

187
00:12:54,924 --> 00:13:03,568
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I ended up having to take one of my older hard drives, a nice 40 gig Maxter hard drive, and put that in there and format it.

188
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:04,909
[SPEAKER_14]: God knows what was on that.

189
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:06,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sick of apology music.

190
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:23,838
[SPEAKER_14]: every battle so yeah we had to end up reinstalling a new hard drive before it would even take for some reason I don't know why so but we finally got it installed like after the show yeah it finally finally the system came up about

191
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:25,854
[SPEAKER_18]: 3 hours after the show

192
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,689
[SPEAKER_18]: And we just took it off because... Yeah, you guys have to face this.

193
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,633
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a national holiday dedicated to fire.

194
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:57,237
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to be here doing a show for you all?

195
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,099
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we're going to be out setting things on fire.

196
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,240
[SPEAKER_31]: Illegal fireworks.

197
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,643
[SPEAKER_18]: For last week, you do not have our apology.

198
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:03,503
[SPEAKER_18]: You get fire.

199
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Our leftover fire from last week.

200
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:07,086
[SPEAKER_31]: This is smoke and ashes.

201
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,767
[SPEAKER_18]: It was not our intention to be on two weeks in a row, so we apologize.

202
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:10,587
[SPEAKER_18]: We know you've missed us.

203
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:15,228
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the excuse.

204
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:16,188
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what's going on.

205
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:17,468
[SPEAKER_31]: I make no excuses.

206
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,229
[SPEAKER_31]: I stand by my decisions, dammit.

207
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:27,690
[SPEAKER_31]: I take full responsibility and accountability for what I did, unlike those who are coming up in the upcoming presidential elections.

208
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:29,871
[SPEAKER_31]: Vote for me.

209
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,787
[SPEAKER_31]: and Unstable Jelly.

210
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:35,968
[SPEAKER_31]: Red vs. Blue owns you.

211
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:36,489
[SPEAKER_31]: Go watch it.

212
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie likes to talk back to our chat room, so if you want to get Jamie's attention, you can... Say something stupid.

213
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:46,777
[SPEAKER_18]: It's broadcast on the TV screen here in our studio.

214
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,940
[SPEAKER_18]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

215
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,821
[SPEAKER_18]: All the good stuff's there.

216
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,883
[SPEAKER_18]: There's all the chatting boys and girls in the chat room.

217
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:56,165
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the only way you can participate in Cage Match.

218
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:57,166
[SPEAKER_31]: By the way, my friends...

219
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:05,385
[SPEAKER_31]: Someone brought up to me that there is a working Mac emulator now for a PC that I'm going to be getting for my computer.

220
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:06,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait a minute.

221
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,708
[SPEAKER_18]: You just said working and Mac in the same sentence.

222
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,449
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to try it out.

223
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,512
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm going to try it out just for curiosity.

224
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:16,694
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just giving our listeners a little hell.

225
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,496
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to be interesting news.

226
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:24,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that I've apologized for being gone for the past two weeks, I have some interesting news to tell you all.

227
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:28,002
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to be here for the next two weeks.

228
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:28,583
[SPEAKER_29]: Bye.

229
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:34,884
[SPEAKER_18]: This show will be solely in the hands of DarkSakura and Loki.

230
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear God save us all.

231
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,966
[SPEAKER_18]: I fear for you all and my apologies.

232
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:45,608
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to pay my rent and my bills, then I will be here every week for you.

233
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:54,411
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, I need to remain my company's bitch and go to strange places they tell me to go to, which for the next two weeks will involve the East Coast.

234
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,612
[SPEAKER_31]: Bring me back something Eastern.

235
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,200
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if I should say where.

236
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,901
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want stalker fans to find me.

237
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:04,342
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to say exactly where, but I'll give a hint.

238
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:05,182
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give a hint.

239
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:11,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

240
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,924
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one letter off from California in the state of abbreviation.

241
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:15,664
[SPEAKER_18]: That's way nerdy.

242
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:20,125
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an hour away from where Queer as Folk is set.

243
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:22,346
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a good hint.

244
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:26,387
[SPEAKER_18]: So I won't be here for the next two weeks, so.

245
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:31,447
[SPEAKER_31]: How many times are we going to do this show from my house?

246
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:35,471
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as people don't decide to abandon me for Ron Jeremy like they did last time.

247
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:37,313
[SPEAKER_18]: No, this time I'll be abandoned for Mame.

248
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:51,943
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll do what I can.

249
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:56,605
[SPEAKER_18]: If there's something I can do to help from millions of miles away, I will.

250
00:16:56,905 --> 00:17:02,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, this is still all up in the air, because basically, I got told that I'm taking this trip Friday.

251
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,630
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll be leaving a week from today.

252
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:10,693
[SPEAKER_18]: So everything's very last minute here, and I'm wondering if it'll actually happen.

253
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,555
[SPEAKER_18]: So I may be here next week, but not bloody likely.

254
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,656
[SPEAKER_18]: When the man tells you you go, you go.

255
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:16,717
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's all you can do.

256
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:22,034
[SPEAKER_31]: Why does it always have to be the man?

257
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:24,116
[SPEAKER_31]: Why can't it be the woman to tell you to do something?

258
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, because in this case it was a man that told me I'm going.

259
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:30,040
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, fuck you.

260
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:33,763
[SPEAKER_18]: My boss is a woman, but her boss is a man.

261
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:36,305
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, well then I retract that.

262
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:38,046
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard some great woman jokes over the weekend.

263
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:38,666
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to hear some?

264
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:39,567
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure.

265
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:41,669
[SPEAKER_18]: How do you fix a woman's watch?

266
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:45,932
[SPEAKER_31]: What?

267
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:47,678
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't need to, there's a clock on the oven.

268
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:56,381
[SPEAKER_31]: I would throw this can at you, but I'm still drinking from it.

269
00:17:57,801 --> 00:17:59,822
[SPEAKER_31]: And this root beer I value more than that joke.

270
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:03,303
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, you know, I wouldn't want the house getting dirty.

271
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:08,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, moving right along.

272
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:12,380
[SPEAKER_18]: Here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're equal opportunity offenders, by the way.

273
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:17,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving right along, we usually start the show off with doing a little bit of How was your day?

274
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:17,884
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your week?

275
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:20,986
[SPEAKER_18]: But seeing as we've been gone for a little while, I think we're going to do some How was your day?

276
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:21,527
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your month?

277
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:24,949
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Jamie, how was your day?

278
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,510
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your month?

279
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,051
[SPEAKER_31]: My day was pretty good, actually.

280
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:33,856
[SPEAKER_31]: I woke up at 8.30 in the morning after having gone to bed around 4 a.m.

281
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:35,177
[SPEAKER_31]: And...

282
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:40,341
[SPEAKER_31]: I decided that, well, today, Julie and I were going to go running.

283
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,963
[SPEAKER_31]: So we went, and we left, you know, on time.

284
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:46,986
[SPEAKER_31]: For the first time, Julie was on time getting to my house.

285
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:52,029
[SPEAKER_31]: We got out, we got to ARC, and it was all roped off.

286
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,711
[SPEAKER_31]: ARC, by the way, is American River College, for those people who don't know.

287
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:58,614
[SPEAKER_31]: And so we're like, okay, so we'll go over to CSUS.

288
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,656
[SPEAKER_31]: Forgot the Olympic trials were going on.

289
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:01,776
[SPEAKER_31]: That's closed off, too.

290
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:06,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Right here in Sacramento, we got the Olympians.

291
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,514
[SPEAKER_31]: So I went to, we saw a limo there, I wanted to egg it, but anyway.

292
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:20,139
[SPEAKER_31]: So we went to Sac City, forgetting that the track there was a stadium and all closed off because of whatever zoning law or whatever.

293
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,700
[SPEAKER_31]: So we ended up running at Natomas High School.

294
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,261
[SPEAKER_31]: Now Natomas High School is really nice.

295
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,723
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a very new school, lots of amenities.

296
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,164
[SPEAKER_31]: One would think the track would be paved.

297
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,692
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it's not.

298
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:45,024
[SPEAKER_31]: And with it being as hot as it was by the time we got there, like around noon, actually no it wasn't around noon, it was around 11, but it was still fairly hot outside.

299
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:49,990
[SPEAKER_31]: There was wind blowing, the thing is that wind plus dirt equals dirt in your face.

300
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:54,554
[SPEAKER_18]: So to clarify, you don't rely on DDR for your exercise.

301
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:56,895
[SPEAKER_18]: You get out there on the track and run, on the dirt track.

302
00:19:56,915 --> 00:20:01,076
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I'm trying to... I have to get where I can run two miles.

303
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:02,316
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, okay.

304
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:19,561
[SPEAKER_31]: So right now, what the plan was is walk the first lap to warm up and then run-walk two more and then walk another and run-walk two more and walk another until I can get to where I can do the whole thing

305
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,333
[SPEAKER_31]: Running the straight way, walking the curve, and keep doing it like that.

306
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:27,857
[SPEAKER_31]: Because a friend of mine who ran track told me that that's how they trained.

307
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,758
[SPEAKER_31]: So I was like, okay, I'll do that.

308
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,720
[SPEAKER_31]: I actually made it a full mile doing the walk run.

309
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,581
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't stop.

310
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:39,766
[SPEAKER_31]: And did my first lap walking and my last lap walking.

311
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,968
[SPEAKER_31]: Actually, I did another half of that lap on a run.

312
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:45,149
[SPEAKER_31]: So I made it pretty well.

313
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,512
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm hoping that by the end of the month I can actually at least run a mile.

314
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:53,460
[SPEAKER_31]: or at least run two laps without feeling like my heart wants to explode.

315
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,620
[SPEAKER_31]: I can breathe just fine though.

316
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,320
[SPEAKER_31]: No asthma.

317
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,481
[SPEAKER_31]: That's another thing about my month.

318
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:03,522
[SPEAKER_31]: Starting what happened, I think it was the week before Ren Faire.

319
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:06,443
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm thinking it was either the one before or after.

320
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:10,744
[SPEAKER_31]: I had a pulmonary exam done to see if I, to prove I didn't have asthma.

321
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,824
[SPEAKER_31]: And I don't have asthma.

322
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:18,326
[SPEAKER_31]: The way that one of the charts reads is that it has a scale of 1 to 10 and

323
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:24,336
[SPEAKER_31]: When you take in your first breath, it goes up and then it pans off as you exhale.

324
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:33,679
[SPEAKER_31]: And six, for the inhale part of that, is about mid-average lung capacity, and I hit an eight out of ten.

325
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:41,902
[SPEAKER_31]: So I apparently have really awesome, fantastic lungs, and so I'm all good, and I don't have to keep the inhaler anymore.

326
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:45,383
[SPEAKER_31]: All it took was just losing some weight, and so I've been good with that.

327
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,399
[SPEAKER_31]: And, uh, the Ren Fair was really fun.

328
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,422
[SPEAKER_31]: I was in the chat room, though, on that, for that show, because I was, like, just dead tired after the fair.

329
00:21:53,802 --> 00:21:55,103
[SPEAKER_31]: But they didn't have mead anywhere.

330
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:55,984
[SPEAKER_31]: I was pissed off.

331
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:57,725
[SPEAKER_31]: And my bodice was too big.

332
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:01,307
[SPEAKER_31]: So I didn't have quite the, you know, lusty wench effect.

333
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:06,430
[SPEAKER_31]: Although some guy asked me to pick up something off of the ground so that he could stare down my cleavage.

334
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,191
[SPEAKER_31]: So, I took it as a compliment.

335
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:08,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

336
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:09,411
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I didn't.

337
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:11,513
[SPEAKER_31]: I told him to pay me.

338
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:13,714
[SPEAKER_31]: He didn't.

339
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:24,009
[SPEAKER_31]: There was this adorable little kid there who was in the ultimate... I can't think of the word now.

340
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:25,330
[SPEAKER_31]: He was in sackcloth.

341
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,010
[SPEAKER_31]: It was great.

342
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:28,632
[SPEAKER_31]: Just running around in sackcloth the whole time.

343
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:29,913
[SPEAKER_31]: He looked like he was having a good time.

344
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:30,814
[SPEAKER_31]: Sackcloth?

345
00:22:31,674 --> 00:22:32,035
[SPEAKER_31]: Burlap.

346
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,596
[SPEAKER_31]: Whatever.

347
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:35,657
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, but I'm trying to think of the actual term.

348
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:36,238
[SPEAKER_31]: The peasant.

349
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:37,018
[SPEAKER_31]: That was it.

350
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:43,563
[SPEAKER_31]: And there was... Let's see what else.

351
00:22:45,513 --> 00:22:47,414
[SPEAKER_31]: Fourth of July was okay.

352
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:48,535
[SPEAKER_31]: I was actually sick all day.

353
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,336
[SPEAKER_31]: I was sick practically all the weekend.

354
00:22:50,396 --> 00:22:51,236
[SPEAKER_31]: Dope.

355
00:22:51,416 --> 00:23:02,002
[SPEAKER_31]: But I went to a barbecue at the home of some friends of mine and Dan who are Atkinsing.

356
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:04,844
[SPEAKER_31]: So there was lots of meat everywhere.

357
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:06,565
[SPEAKER_31]: Meat everywhere.

358
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,026
[SPEAKER_31]: And no potato salad.

359
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,307
[SPEAKER_31]: Although someone did bring potato salad, but I didn't touch it.

360
00:23:12,248 --> 00:23:12,368
[SPEAKER_31]: And...

361
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:16,146
[SPEAKER_31]: They had sparklers there, but they had the old ones that are metal.

362
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,066
[SPEAKER_31]: So those were fun.

363
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:19,026
[SPEAKER_31]: Cool!

364
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:20,807
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't ever find those kind anymore.

365
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:23,347
[SPEAKER_31]: I was setting them on fire the whole night.

366
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:26,628
[SPEAKER_31]: I was just all happy because I had fire.

367
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:41,712
[SPEAKER_31]: And I've been training somebody at work, and I basically told that I'm going to be sort of like, I guess, like the mentor from now on for a lot of people, for the new hires who come in.

368
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:42,912
[SPEAKER_31]: So I was like,

369
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:48,257
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know what to think about that because I like doing it.

370
00:23:48,437 --> 00:23:53,400
[SPEAKER_31]: I like passing on what I know and I like the teaching aspect.

371
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,623
[SPEAKER_31]: But sometimes I want my cubicle to myself.

372
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:57,924
[SPEAKER_31]: That's like my space.

373
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:00,185
[SPEAKER_16]: It's your domain.

374
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,947
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to be the master of your domain.

375
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:06,070
[SPEAKER_31]: But other than that, it's really cool.

376
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,531
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just been an interesting week.

377
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:09,412
[SPEAKER_31]: I missed my brother.

378
00:24:09,592 --> 00:24:12,895
[SPEAKER_31]: My brother was in Alabama on the fourth weekend.

379
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:19,394
[SPEAKER_31]: and I wanted to have the money to go see him, but I'm like flat broke right now.

380
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:21,675
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, what else I did?

381
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,156
[SPEAKER_31]: I enrolled in school.

382
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:24,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Congrats.

383
00:24:24,536 --> 00:24:25,637
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going back to college.

384
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,598
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going into database management.

385
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:35,162
[SPEAKER_31]: And so I need a laptop so that I can do my homework wherever I happen to be because half my classes are online.

386
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:39,385
[SPEAKER_31]: I decided to get a class that I'm not looking forward to out of the way, like right off the bat.

387
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:41,726
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm taking business law.

388
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:45,524
[SPEAKER_31]: and I'm just going to take that one in the classroom.

389
00:24:45,724 --> 00:24:46,145
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't care.

390
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:46,865
[SPEAKER_31]: I want it out of the way.

391
00:24:48,106 --> 00:24:55,914
[SPEAKER_31]: But they're making me take all of the stupid prerequisites that I could test out of if I was able to miss work for it.

392
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:00,678
[SPEAKER_31]: But I figure it's going to be an easy A and a good buffer against that business law class.

393
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:08,766
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm having to take like Intro to Windows and beginning word processing and beginning Excel and next semester I'm taking like Access.

394
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:14,588
[SPEAKER_31]: It's probably going to be around summer when I'm going to have to start taking the crappy programming classes.

395
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:22,111
[SPEAKER_31]: So that also is going to affect when Pump Up the Volume is.

396
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:25,893
[SPEAKER_31]: Because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.

397
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:29,374
[SPEAKER_31]: I get out of class like at 6.45.

398
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:40,119
[SPEAKER_31]: But because it's also going to break into my gym time on Wednesdays, I'm thinking about moving the show to another night in the week

399
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,719
[SPEAKER_31]: or maybe do two shows late night.

400
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:52,386
[SPEAKER_31]: Because Monday, I figure if I move the show, then I'll start running on Monday and Wednesday and do spin on Friday.

401
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:53,967
[SPEAKER_10]: You can always have Tuesday back if you want.

402
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:55,869
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, that should be easiest.

403
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:57,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll just give you Tuesday back.

404
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,131
[SPEAKER_31]: And we can use the old promo again!

405
00:25:59,171 --> 00:25:59,812
[SPEAKER_31]: Yay!

406
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:00,152
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

407
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:03,745
[SPEAKER_18]: That does work out.

408
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:04,806
[SPEAKER_18]: You let me know when you want to do that.

409
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:06,647
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to be gone for two weeks.

410
00:26:06,908 --> 00:26:11,752
[SPEAKER_18]: And then after I get back from my little work trip, I should have an announcement on what's going to happen with Vanilla Sky.

411
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:14,094
[SPEAKER_31]: Why don't I just start it this week?

412
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'll figure something out.

413
00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:15,715
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine.

414
00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:16,616
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll start doing it on Tuesdays.

415
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:17,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, okay.

416
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:18,298
[SPEAKER_10]: We can shuffle it around.

417
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:20,260
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll do it two nights in a row.

418
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,740
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't care.

419
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

420
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:22,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, okay.

421
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,304
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll just go live all week.

422
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Fun.

423
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:27,586
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, yeah, the Jamie experience.

424
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:28,427
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll figure it out.

425
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:30,633
[SPEAKER_31]: Everyone's going to get so sick of me.

426
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:34,097
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll make an official announcement on the website when we figure out the scheduling stuff.

427
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:36,379
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, and the last bit of news.

428
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,882
[SPEAKER_31]: I have meat, and meat makes me happy.

429
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations.

430
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:43,907
Okay, I'm done.

431
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:44,607
[SPEAKER_18]: All done?

432
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:45,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

433
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:45,508
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

434
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,951
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, do you have anything you want to share?

435
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:48,591
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your week?

436
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:49,692
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, how was your month?

437
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:50,113
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your day?

438
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:54,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Final Fantasy.

439
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,229
[SPEAKER_14]: I burned things.

440
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:59,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I got my hard drive loader working.

441
00:26:59,691 --> 00:27:00,812
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Driver 3.

442
00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:09,137
[SPEAKER_31]: I forgot to mention something, so I'm going to have Rob mention it for me.

443
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:10,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

444
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, I saw Spider-Man 2.

445
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:18,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw Fahrenheit 9-11 twice.

446
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:19,804
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw...

447
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:23,296
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, some other movie.

448
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:27,739
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, not much that really happened.

449
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,301
[SPEAKER_14]: What do I say every week?

450
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing happened during the week.

451
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Multiply that times four, that was my month.

452
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:37,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Or, you know, two weeks, half a month, I guess.

453
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:42,811
[SPEAKER_31]: No, your week was playing Final Fantasy XI all night.

454
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:52,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, my fiancee Nellie, who's been on the show a few times, she got a job at my work doing Mailer Room, and she loves it.

455
00:27:52,789 --> 00:28:20,907
[SPEAKER_14]: and, um, I'm trying to think what else I did, oh, today I put together the PC that's going to go in the cabinet that's been sitting here for months, not just collecting dust, so it will be functional soon, so possibly the webcam will come back, hooray, and then, um, what else, um, and there's other things, but I'll mention them later, I'm sure, yeah.

456
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,169
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

457
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:43,590
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought I was going to die or something.

458
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,511
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, seriously, I don't know if you've ever had hiccups, but usually they last, what, like a half hour at the most?

459
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:52,912
[SPEAKER_18]: I had it on and off for like 90 minute intervals for three days.

460
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:54,133
[SPEAKER_18]: It was horrid.

461
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,954
[SPEAKER_18]: So I finally had to go to the doctor, and I swear to God, my doctor was going to laugh at me.

462
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:00,815
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, you got the hiccups?

463
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:03,270
[SPEAKER_18]: You coming in here because you got hiccups?

464
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:04,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, it's been three days!

465
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:05,753
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not normal!

466
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:07,394
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got brain cancer!

467
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:08,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I went on to WebMD.com.

468
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:15,682
[SPEAKER_18]: I swear to God, if you go on WebMD, and you type in, like, hiccups, like, reoccurring, it'll tell you, like, oh, you might have brain cancer.

469
00:29:15,702 --> 00:29:16,583
[SPEAKER_18]: You better go get checked out.

470
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:17,664
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not a tumor.

471
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:19,766
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I went to the doctor.

472
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:21,807
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, doctor, I think I have brain cancer.

473
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:22,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

474
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:23,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I have hiccups.

475
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:27,393
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um...

476
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:31,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, what else happened besides that?

477
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:32,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, my birthday happened.

478
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:33,847
[SPEAKER_18]: God, that was wild now.

479
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:35,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday, Rob!

480
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:36,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

481
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of my friends threw me a surprise party, which was really cute.

482
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:43,010
[SPEAKER_18]: And my cake said, Happy Birthday, Dr. Dick, which was really cute.

483
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:44,031
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and I got this.

484
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,032
[SPEAKER_18]: I got the answer to the ferret here.

485
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:47,752
[SPEAKER_18]: I got this new little toy here.

486
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:48,593
[SPEAKER_18]: What's this guy's name?

487
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:49,273
[SPEAKER_18]: Does he have a name?

488
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:54,275
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Trash Talkers, and this guy's name... Marshall!

489
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:55,695
[SPEAKER_31]: I left your present at home.

490
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:56,936
[SPEAKER_18]: And Marshall... Oh, that's all good.

491
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Marshall is this guy, and he's wearing a lavender shirt and lavender pants with a little rainbow flag on it, and let's see some of the things that Marshall has to say.

492
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:07,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, shit.

493
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:09,665
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to whack him in the head to get him to say something.

494
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:11,866
You can barely hear it.

495
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:17,128
I don't think our listeners can hear it at all.

496
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:17,689
That's great.

497
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,173
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's my answer to the ferret.

498
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:32,780
[SPEAKER_18]: So whenever you start up with a ferret... Oh, there, I think his speaker's in the front here.

499
00:30:36,688 --> 00:30:37,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, anyway.

500
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:43,586
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, what else?

501
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:46,187
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think I've played a single game of DDR.

502
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:48,008
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I take that back.

503
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:50,469
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually, I was hanging out with Navi, our poppin' music whore.

504
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:55,631
[SPEAKER_18]: I was hanging out with him on Friday, and I beat a 31 on poppin' music.

505
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:56,411
[SPEAKER_18]: That made me so happy.

506
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:57,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, on the arcade controller.

507
00:30:58,312 --> 00:30:59,392
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I was all jazzed.

508
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:01,613
[SPEAKER_18]: I know some of you out there are better, but don't hate!

509
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:03,209
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm getting better.

510
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:06,910
[SPEAKER_18]: But we actually played DDR, like on an ignition pad and everything.

511
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,451
[SPEAKER_18]: We were playing DDR Extreme at home.

512
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:12,272
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was so great because I was still doing really well.

513
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:14,493
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also got DDR for my Xbox.

514
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:18,574
[SPEAKER_18]: Those of you that were listening to episode 101 heard the confession that I bought an Xbox.

515
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:22,756
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've been playing DDR on live a little bit.

516
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:29,838
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've got to say, it's very interesting to play DDR on Xbox Live because people can talk on the microphones and stuff.

517
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:32,439
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to play Phantasy Star with me.

518
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,821
[SPEAKER_18]: That's extra money.

519
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:45,662
[SPEAKER_18]: That's more money.

520
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:46,844
[SPEAKER_18]: You know how many MMORPGs I'm playing?

521
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:47,544
[SPEAKER_18]: PSO is cheap.

522
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:49,266
[SPEAKER_31]: PSO is $9.

523
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:50,268
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll see.

524
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:50,608
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

525
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,090
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, okay, so then I'd be on PSO.

526
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,231
[SPEAKER_31]: And then they forget to charge you.

527
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:54,512
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be on PSO.

528
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Then I'd be on Ragnarok, because Jamie found this free server.

529
00:31:58,317 --> 00:31:59,238
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I didn't find it.

530
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:00,039
[SPEAKER_31]: Marenchan found it.

531
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:00,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, sorry.

532
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Marenchan found this free server that we've all been playing Ragnarok on now.

533
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:03,963
[SPEAKER_31]: The 60th.

534
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:12,784
[SPEAKER_31]: With the 60 times experience and 30 times drops?

535
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:14,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, something like that.

536
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:14,548
[SPEAKER_18]: It's crazy.

537
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:16,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

538
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:20,570
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've got that, the free Ragnarok server.

539
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,834
[SPEAKER_18]: And now, okay, Final Fantasy XI, when I reinstalled everything for the computer, it broke.

540
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:31,261
[SPEAKER_18]: It was fucked up, my graphics were flickering, it was screwed up beyond belief, and I was never going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI again.

541
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:34,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Last night, it finally got fixed.

542
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:39,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Finally got fixed last night because the way to fix it, I had to install some drivers that are two years old for my card.

543
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:41,010
[SPEAKER_18]: And now it works.

544
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:41,851
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

545
00:32:43,497 --> 00:33:11,692
[SPEAKER_18]: now I'm back on there so that would be three MMORPGs I'm wasting my time with I bitch enough about how I don't have enough time to play like real console games like I've been trying to play Mega Man Collection barely have any time I finally have sat down with Silent Hill 2 and I'm only about halfway through that because I'm so I have video game ADD is basically what it boils down to I sit down this is especially bad when I have emulation I play a game for like literally like 10 seconds and then I'm done with it and I want to do another game so yes Jamie

546
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:14,629
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to answer Angel's question real quick.

547
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:30,637
[SPEAKER_31]: If you go onto, and this is sort of, I'm not meaning to plug my own stuff here, but if you go to roleplay.darksakura.com, look in the Ragnarok online folder, you'll see an announcement there posted regarding playing the free Ragnarok server.

548
00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:32,318
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway.

549
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:42,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so that was pretty much my week and my day, or my month and my day, really.

550
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:46,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you play any Bomani at all through this whole month, Jamie?

551
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:49,645
[SPEAKER_31]: I did, and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was.

552
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:59,152
[SPEAKER_31]: I played some pop and music when we had the first Dorama night, and I played DDR!

553
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:00,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Did ya?

554
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:01,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Amazing.

555
00:34:01,614 --> 00:34:02,594
[SPEAKER_31]: Tamarik was in town.

556
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:03,535
[SPEAKER_18]: Mm-hmm.

557
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:07,886
[SPEAKER_31]: and we went to Fry's and I played TDR in Fry's.

558
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:09,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

559
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:22,936
[SPEAKER_14]: I also bought, because it just came out a couple weeks ago, I bought the You Got Served Taken to the Streets DVD, which is the instructional videos on how to do all the choreography and I thought that was sweet.

560
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:23,256
[SPEAKER_31]: Funny.

561
00:34:23,596 --> 00:34:24,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Haven't watched it yet, but

562
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:31,228
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the, uh, I actually bought, I was also probably one of the only people on the face of the earth that bought Darren's Dance Grooves.

563
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I have that DVD also.

564
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:38,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Just in case if I ever won these days aside, you know, I feel like getting in shape and doing freestyle.

565
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:41,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Just in case if that dark day ever comes.

566
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:43,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be ready.

567
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:46,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

568
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:54,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I think we're going to take a break, and then we're going to come back and we're going to do some real Babani news.

569
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:58,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we missed a lot of news stories while we were gone, our little bit of downtime.

570
00:34:58,896 --> 00:34:59,957
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to talk about some of that.

571
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:04,720
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to take a break, and Jamie requested a Gradius break.

572
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:05,801
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to do that.

573
00:35:06,362 --> 00:35:07,443
[SPEAKER_31]: That makes me go squeak.

574
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:09,024
[SPEAKER_18]: So what is a Gradius break, Jamie?

575
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:12,787
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I guess it's not just Gradius, but it's all of the...

576
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,563
[SPEAKER_31]: Games featuring the Vic Viper, I guess.

577
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:21,145
[SPEAKER_31]: Sensation is from the second stage of Life Force, Salamander 2.

578
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:27,007
[SPEAKER_31]: And Burning Heat was, of course, the first stage of Gradius 2.

579
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:32,349
[SPEAKER_31]: And then the Gradius full option mix, which was all the music from the first Gradius.

580
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:39,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so we're going to do these songs, and then we'll do some chat rooms requests and some pop-in music, so we'll do that in a later break.

581
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:43,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, some actual Bomani news when we come back.

582
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:44,559
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back!

583
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:44,559
... ...

584
00:36:58,661 --> 00:36:59,643
Thanks for watching!

585
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:23,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

586
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:08,273
Thanks for watching!

587
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:32,722
[SPEAKER_18]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

588
00:41:32,982 --> 00:41:35,145
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

589
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:35,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Just kidding.

590
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:39,110
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bavani Radio.

591
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:45,779
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back live, Orange Lounge Radio, episode 102 in progress.

592
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:52,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Some folks out there are telling me there might be a little bit of skipping going on with some of the stuff we're playing.

593
00:41:54,098 --> 00:41:56,499
[SPEAKER_18]: We're using a new encoder program tonight.

594
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:01,380
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually not new, it's the one we used to use like a long time ago between episodes like 1 and 60.

595
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,041
[SPEAKER_18]: But they updated it so it does the MP3 Pro thing now.

596
00:42:05,341 --> 00:42:10,982
[SPEAKER_18]: If you guys don't hear us in stereo, all you gotta do is download the MP3 Pro codec and you'll hear us in stereo.

597
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:15,903
[SPEAKER_18]: But I guess maybe it's causing things to skip a little bit if I do too much in the background, so...

598
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:44,929
[SPEAKER_18]: it's not everyone that's getting it though yeah I don't know weird we'll see we'll see yeah we'll see I don't know yeah I know my computer is like now it's a 3.2 gigahertz machine now I would think it has enough you know juice in there to handle everything and not make things skip but I don't know technology amazes me some days I don't know we'll see I can always try the new video card I think it has to do with I have too much video going on we'll see we'll see

599
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,919
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back, Orange Lounge Radio.

600
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,161
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to talk about some stuff that's been going on in the Bomani news scene while we've been gone for the past three weeks.

601
00:42:55,341 --> 00:43:00,362
[SPEAKER_18]: First off, this story kind of came out not too long after we had our last show.

602
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:06,003
[SPEAKER_18]: You probably all heard about this, but we haven't had a chance to make fun of it yet, so I'm bringing it up again.

603
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:13,065
[SPEAKER_18]: This girl, I'm sure you've heard, but she had a heart attack or something like that while playing DDR.

604
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:15,845
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, that's the short story.

605
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:24,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, really what it is, is that that's kind of what the media says in all these headlines, is that, oh my god, girl almost died playing DDR.

606
00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:26,034
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR kills teen.

607
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,277
[SPEAKER_31]: Did they bring up that it was a pre-existing condition?

608
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,198
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course not.

609
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:32,064
[SPEAKER_18]: But here's the headline.

610
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:35,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Heart condition strikes girl down at arcade.

611
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:36,427
[SPEAKER_18]: Now see, that's not so bad.

612
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:44,631
[SPEAKER_18]: But then if you go on to like GameSpot or something, GameSpot's headline was something like, girl gets heart problem while playing DDR or something like that.

613
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:48,533
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of like, it sort of infers that DDR caused the problem.

614
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:50,514
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR did not cause the problem.

615
00:43:52,565 --> 00:43:55,727
[SPEAKER_31]: If she had been out running, the same damn thing would have happened.

616
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:59,610
[SPEAKER_31]: If she had been rollerblading, the same thing would have happened.

617
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,231
[SPEAKER_18]: If she had been masturbating, the same thing would have happened.

618
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:03,532
[SPEAKER_31]: I have heard of that, okay?

619
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:08,395
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that for a climax?

620
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:11,017
[SPEAKER_14]: It's heart-stopping.

621
00:44:11,037 --> 00:44:15,519
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my God, I'm dead.

622
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,220
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it.

623
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,100
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it.

624
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:18,842
[SPEAKER_27]: I just came in my eye.

625
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:19,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

626
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:19,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

627
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:23,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

628
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:28,375
[SPEAKER_31]: The thing is, is that the media... If she had been eating a donut, that would have happened.

629
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:32,398
[SPEAKER_18]: All I could hear in the bathroom was masturbating in the crowd-making stream.

630
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:34,280
[SPEAKER_18]: It's alright, it's alright.

631
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:44,209
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's listen to this lovely news story brought to us by TheOmahaChannel.com And hopefully you guys don't get a lot of skipping, but let's hear what happened to our friend here in Omaha.

632
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:47,952
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll just...

633
00:44:49,337 --> 00:45:01,866
[SPEAKER_26]: The sign outside the Bellevue Arcade has been up for nearly one week.

634
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,667
[SPEAKER_26]: Get well soon, Kimber.

635
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:04,908
[SPEAKER_26]: Ooh, yeah.

636
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:06,829
[SPEAKER_26]: A 15-year-old is doing just that.

637
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,131
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't remember too much.

638
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:10,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Loki.

639
00:45:10,812 --> 00:45:12,653
[SPEAKER_18]: She's all, ooh, yeah, donut.

640
00:45:13,894 --> 00:45:14,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop it.

641
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:15,635
[SPEAKER_27]: Stop it.

642
00:45:16,776 --> 00:45:18,677
[SPEAKER_18]: You are very rude, Mr. Loki.

643
00:45:20,757 --> 00:45:21,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on.

644
00:45:21,758 --> 00:45:24,840
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that a midget playing DDR on the right side?

645
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,421
[SPEAKER_26]: It looks like a midget.

646
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:27,242
[SPEAKER_26]: That's Tyler Durden.

647
00:45:27,262 --> 00:45:28,443
[SPEAKER_26]: She then fell to the floor.

648
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:47,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well see, she was playing I Do, I Do, I Do.

649
00:45:47,713 --> 00:45:48,454
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what happened.

650
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:53,498
[SPEAKER_18]: She heard that song and she was like, Ah, Christ, this song sucks!

651
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:54,499
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna die.

652
00:45:57,501 --> 00:45:58,942
[SPEAKER_18]: We're being really horrible, you guys.

653
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:01,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're not trying to be mean, but we accomplished... What?

654
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:02,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

655
00:46:02,865 --> 00:46:04,447
[SPEAKER_18]: She played this song, Broken My Heart.

656
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:06,909
[SPEAKER_18]: That joke...

657
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, give me a break.

658
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:10,991
[SPEAKER_18]: That joke is so used.

659
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:15,555
[SPEAKER_18]: That was like the first freaking thing you heard on every message board.

660
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:17,497
[SPEAKER_18]: First thing on every message board.

661
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, what a crappy song.

662
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:28,026
[SPEAKER_18]: I do, I do, I do.

663
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:29,807
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't, I don't, I don't.

664
00:46:30,168 --> 00:46:30,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

665
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:31,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's continue with the news story here.

666
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:44,624
[SPEAKER_26]: Now how many times do you get to hear the word defibrillator in the news, huh?

667
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:46,985
[SPEAKER_26]: That's such an awesome word.

668
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:48,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Defibrillator.

669
00:46:48,345 --> 00:46:51,626
[SPEAKER_18]: I challenge all of our listeners to use the word defibrillator in a sentence today.

670
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:54,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you shove a defibrillator up your ass?

671
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:01,330
[SPEAKER_31]: Because, keep in mind that the media is typically too tight-ass to...

672
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:03,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

673
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:04,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

674
00:47:04,868 --> 00:47:05,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

675
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:07,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Hypertrophy cardiomyopathy.

676
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'll say that three times fast.

677
00:47:11,073 --> 00:47:15,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Hydro, wait, let's see if it, hydrotrophy cardiomyopathy.

678
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:17,177
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally fucked that up.

679
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:18,719
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, it totally sounds made up.

680
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:19,499
[SPEAKER_18]: It has to do with water.

681
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:20,340
[SPEAKER_18]: This is real.

682
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,581
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a real infection.

683
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:23,662
[SPEAKER_18]: You could have this and you could get this.

684
00:47:24,063 --> 00:47:27,085
[SPEAKER_31]: No, he probably doesn't have it and you probably can't catch it.

685
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:28,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

686
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,623
[SPEAKER_26]: The walls around her heart are so thick, her heart wasn't getting the signals to beat.

687
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:40,727
[SPEAKER_24]: You could be asleep, you could be walking, running, sitting down to eat, and it can hit you.

688
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:44,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Sitting down to eat, and it could hit you.

689
00:47:47,371 --> 00:47:51,133
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it could have been that she's like, Mongo need food!

690
00:47:51,153 --> 00:47:55,116
[SPEAKER_31]: A translation for Spaceboy, who I guess is one of our new listeners.

691
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:58,101
[SPEAKER_31]: It's the paddle thing that they put on you to clear.

692
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,023
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is, what is a defibrillator?

693
00:48:01,305 --> 00:48:04,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, if you ever watch ER or something and you hear them go, clear!

694
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:08,953
[SPEAKER_18]: And then they put those paddles on somebody and then the body bounces, that's a defibrillator.

695
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:11,996
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to see someone that doesn't clear when that happens.

696
00:48:12,116 --> 00:48:14,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I want them to be like, you're going to be okay!

697
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:15,700
[SPEAKER_14]: And just get thrown back.

698
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:16,541
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be great.

699
00:48:17,582 --> 00:48:27,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Defibulator has always been comedy gold in movies like Naked Gun and stuff like that.

700
00:48:27,931 --> 00:48:29,592
[SPEAKER_18]: So, anyway, moving on.

701
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,634
[SPEAKER_26]: I would just like to point something out there, though.

702
00:48:31,654 --> 00:48:33,295
[SPEAKER_26]: The mother says, what's so damn funny, Jamie?

703
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:49,126
[SPEAKER_29]: Ah ha ha, that's funny.

704
00:48:49,947 --> 00:48:55,813
[SPEAKER_18]: The mother says, in this story, the mother says she was at the right place with all the people needed around there to help her.

705
00:48:56,914 --> 00:48:59,116
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR almost kills a teen.

706
00:48:59,376 --> 00:49:04,020
[SPEAKER_18]: It murdered a teenager because she was playing a bad song and her heart just stopped.

707
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,722
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR is bad for people.

708
00:49:05,762 --> 00:49:10,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Yet the mother says she was in the right place at the right time with all the right people around her.

709
00:49:12,608 --> 00:49:13,449
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR kills!

710
00:49:16,772 --> 00:49:21,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Truth is, they don't really want their daughter, and they were hoping that she would die so they can collect the insurance.

711
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:21,775
[SPEAKER_14]: That is mean.

712
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:22,635
[SPEAKER_14]: That is just mean.

713
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:23,876
[SPEAKER_31]: First off, first off.

714
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:24,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Rude.

715
00:49:24,697 --> 00:49:25,337
[SPEAKER_14]: So rude.

716
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:26,037
[SPEAKER_31]: How old was she?

717
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:26,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Fifteen.

718
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:34,843
[SPEAKER_31]: First and foremost, her parents should have been doing their goddamn job, okay?

719
00:49:35,243 --> 00:49:36,964
[SPEAKER_31]: They knew she had a heart condition, right?

720
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:38,305
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't think they did.

721
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:38,905
[SPEAKER_31]: Really?

722
00:49:39,425 --> 00:49:40,326
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think so.

723
00:49:42,452 --> 00:49:43,212
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't say.

724
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,492
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, interestingly enough, they don't say.

725
00:49:44,793 --> 00:49:47,473
[SPEAKER_31]: I heard that it was a known pre-existing condition.

726
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:51,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, people are going to say things in this situation.

727
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:58,056
[SPEAKER_31]: My question is... You don't catch heart disease from playing DDR.

728
00:49:58,556 --> 00:50:01,376
[SPEAKER_31]: It's because there's something wrong with you, okay?

729
00:50:02,557 --> 00:50:04,137
[SPEAKER_31]: You have a condition.

730
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:06,898
[SPEAKER_18]: I am almost positive.

731
00:50:06,918 --> 00:50:11,939
[SPEAKER_18]: To be honest, I'm almost positive they did not know beforehand because of the next part of this little article.

732
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:28,285
[SPEAKER_26]: So, she's now on medication and she now has a pacemaker.

733
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:31,527
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm assuming if they knew about the condition before, they would have given her the pacemaker before.

734
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:36,770
[SPEAKER_31]: The thing is that that's still not something that playing a game of DDR is going to cause.

735
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,811
[SPEAKER_14]: And who is the maker of this pacemaker?

736
00:50:39,071 --> 00:50:39,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Konami.

737
00:50:39,872 --> 00:50:41,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I smell conspiracy.

738
00:50:42,836 --> 00:50:46,779
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you know it's Black Ops Konami?

739
00:50:50,442 --> 00:51:05,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Well they make casino games and a lot of people didn't know that, I mean... They make pachinko machines, they could very well make pacemakers.

740
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:09,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, this girl will be playing Para Para Paradise for the rest of her life.

741
00:51:10,877 --> 00:51:11,578
[SPEAKER_18]: God help everybody.

742
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:14,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, she'll be switching to Pump It Up.

743
00:51:14,758 --> 00:51:16,299
[SPEAKER_31]: She'll be switching to Technomotion.

744
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:24,244
[SPEAKER_26]: Timber and her parents wanted to thank all of the people who helped to revive her, including the arcade owners, the police officer, and the paramedics.

745
00:51:24,644 --> 00:51:27,226
[SPEAKER_26]: All of those rescuers have been checking up on her in the hospital.

746
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:29,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Patricia, the heart problem is genetic?

747
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:30,188
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what we're told.

748
00:51:30,248 --> 00:51:32,549
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, her mother got checked and has a mild form of it.

749
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:34,490
[SPEAKER_26]: And the rest of the family is getting checked out, too.

750
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,132
[SPEAKER_26]: A simple echocardiogram can usually detect the disease.

751
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:38,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

752
00:51:38,254 --> 00:51:41,315
[SPEAKER_18]: So it sounds like they didn't know about it because the mom's getting checked now.

753
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:42,156
[SPEAKER_18]: They're all getting checked.

754
00:51:42,376 --> 00:51:45,197
[SPEAKER_18]: They're having this electrocardiogram to figure out who's got the heart condition.

755
00:51:45,777 --> 00:51:47,458
[SPEAKER_31]: But see, that shows right there.

756
00:51:47,698 --> 00:51:56,341
[SPEAKER_31]: That right there is proof that the doctors themselves don't think DDR did it, which of course they're going to be smarter than them, and checking it as a genetic condition.

757
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:03,024
[SPEAKER_14]: What would happen if this story was girl gets heart attack from playing Grand Theft Auto?

758
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:04,825
[SPEAKER_31]: That would be great.

759
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:05,445
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean...

760
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:09,116
[SPEAKER_14]: The bullets were so real, it struck my heart.

761
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, thanks for sharing.

762
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:15,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's the end of the story.

763
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:20,200
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really... What if that poor girl's listening to us?

764
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,761
[SPEAKER_18]: What if that poor girl's an Orange Lounge Radio fan, and here we are making fun of her plight?

765
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:25,682
[SPEAKER_31]: We're not making fun of her plight.

766
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,763
[SPEAKER_31]: We're making fun of the stupid people who don't understand it.

767
00:52:28,903 --> 00:52:29,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

768
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:35,546
[SPEAKER_18]: Just remember that Loki's an equal opportunity offender, and we love everybody equally.

769
00:52:37,843 --> 00:52:39,704
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm so glad that the microphone can't pick Loki up right now.

770
00:52:39,884 --> 00:52:40,565
[SPEAKER_31]: I am so glad.

771
00:52:40,605 --> 00:52:40,905
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

772
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:41,825
[SPEAKER_31]: I guess that's that for that story.

773
00:52:41,845 --> 00:52:43,706
[SPEAKER_31]: Anything else you want to say about the girl with the heart thing?

774
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:24,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, people, if you think, if your heart kind of tingles sometimes, or you think your heart might, there's something non-normal about your heart, like you feel it, like, you know, tingling a lot, and you suddenly can't feel your arm someday, tingle, not tinkle.

775
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:28,014
[SPEAKER_18]: If your heart tingles, you've got a whole nother problem, okay?

776
00:53:28,576 --> 00:53:37,238
[SPEAKER_18]: If your heart's tingling a little bit or your hand hurts or you find that you're losing feeling in your leg when you're playing DDR, please go see a doctor.

777
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:43,620
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can go to my doctor because I think I have the hiccups for too long, you can go to your doctor because you might have a heart condition.

778
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:48,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Get that little electrocardiogram and please keep DDR out of the news for this kind of crap.

779
00:53:50,062 --> 00:53:53,503
[SPEAKER_14]: If the rest of your body is thick, then your heart's probably going to be thick too.

780
00:53:57,441 --> 00:54:01,224
[SPEAKER_14]: My head is just large, as Bug said, unlike Loki's head.

781
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:16,258
[SPEAKER_18]: One day, Loki, you are going to get smited down from the heavens above with some horrible, horrific story, and everybody you've ever made fun of in the past is going to be there to make fun of you.

782
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:18,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Woo!

783
00:54:19,061 --> 00:54:19,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god!

784
00:54:20,962 --> 00:54:22,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh wait, that's ironic.

785
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:26,725
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I keep telling people I'm going to die an ironic death.

786
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,325
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be funny.

787
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:27,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't worry.

788
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,366
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to... Or drown on an airplane or something.

789
00:54:31,386 --> 00:54:32,186
[SPEAKER_31]: This is my disclaimer.

790
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:41,309
[SPEAKER_31]: That for everybody who thinks that DDR was... You know, her playing DDR contributed to an aggravation of that condition.

791
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:46,630
[SPEAKER_31]: But for anyone who thinks that DDR caused the condition, I'm laughing at you and pointing my finger.

792
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:47,550
[SPEAKER_14]: But it did.

793
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,251
[SPEAKER_14]: It's devil, devil revolution.

794
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:53,617
[SPEAKER_29]: I hit Rob instead.

795
00:54:55,778 --> 00:55:01,081
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys are so insensitive.

796
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:06,705
[SPEAKER_18]: We should call ourselves Orange Lounge Insensitive Radio because that's what we are, you guys.

797
00:55:08,006 --> 00:55:11,188
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't play DDR if you are 500 pounds and can't feel your arm.

798
00:55:12,048 --> 00:55:13,329
[SPEAKER_31]: No, play DDR.

799
00:55:13,749 --> 00:55:14,249
[SPEAKER_31]: Please.

800
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,251
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, Loki.

801
00:55:16,491 --> 00:55:18,472
[SPEAKER_14]: If you throw your arm, that's just going to be disturbing.

802
00:55:25,273 --> 00:55:26,954
[SPEAKER_18]: I really don't know where to take the show from here.

803
00:55:27,355 --> 00:55:27,695
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

804
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:32,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Did her falling down and having a heart attack cause vibrations that disturbed the neighbors?

805
00:55:33,259 --> 00:55:34,700
[SPEAKER_31]: Just stop it.

806
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,340
[SPEAKER_31]: Just stop.

807
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,161
[SPEAKER_31]: Was she really overweight?

808
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:36,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

809
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:37,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I don't know.

810
00:55:41,845 --> 00:55:42,565
[SPEAKER_18]: She looked healthy.

811
00:55:43,546 --> 00:55:44,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Did she pass her song?

812
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:48,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Did she perfect attack it?

813
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:51,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Did she pass her song?

814
00:55:52,112 --> 00:55:53,193
[SPEAKER_18]: God damn!

815
00:55:53,473 --> 00:55:54,294
[SPEAKER_31]: How many misses?

816
00:55:58,854 --> 00:56:03,656
[SPEAKER_18]: She was a shape that a lot of people are, okay?

817
00:56:03,756 --> 00:56:07,777
[SPEAKER_18]: She's just... No, I wouldn't say that.

818
00:56:07,817 --> 00:56:11,979
[SPEAKER_18]: She didn't look to the point where it was morbid, okay?

819
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:13,800
[SPEAKER_18]: She just looked healthy.

820
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, you know, she just... God.

821
00:56:20,082 --> 00:56:21,362
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to get letters from this.

822
00:56:23,303 --> 00:56:24,423
[SPEAKER_18]: We never do get hate mail.

823
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:25,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know.

824
00:56:25,204 --> 00:56:25,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

825
00:56:27,435 --> 00:56:28,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Our chatroom's going, moving on!

826
00:56:29,856 --> 00:56:30,817
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree, moving on.

827
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:33,978
[SPEAKER_18]: This week we get a brand new Bomani game.

828
00:56:34,498 --> 00:56:42,942
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we haven't talked about it a whole lot on this show, but Karaoke Revolution 2 is still slated to come out July 13th.

829
00:56:43,222 --> 00:56:45,683
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Jamie, there's something you can do while I'm gone.

830
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:50,065
[SPEAKER_31]: Not just no, but hell no, I don't think.

831
00:56:51,145 --> 00:56:52,866
[SPEAKER_31]: I was in band for a reason.

832
00:56:55,904 --> 00:57:18,000
[SPEAKER_18]: If you look at the box art, it's interesting because it's red instead of blue, and it's got all new songs in it, some new modes, we've talked about it enough before on this show, but it is coming out relatively soon, hopefully you got your pre-orders in, if you didn't, well, you're not supporting Konami, and we won't have any more DDR ever again, thanks to you.

833
00:57:23,038 --> 00:57:23,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

834
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, so we know Karaoke Revolution 2 is coming out.

835
00:57:28,022 --> 00:57:29,824
[SPEAKER_18]: We still have Xtreme on the way.

836
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:32,346
[SPEAKER_18]: We still have DDR Ultimix 2 on the way.

837
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:33,707
[SPEAKER_18]: But what's going on in Japan?

838
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,469
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't heard a whole lot about what's going on.

839
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:36,850
[SPEAKER_29]: Beautiful, blissful news.

840
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, beautiful, blissful news from Japan.

841
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:40,814
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't heard a whole lot.

842
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:41,294
[SPEAKER_29]: Shut up.

843
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:42,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Quite the opposite, Loki.

844
00:57:43,176 --> 00:57:46,999
[SPEAKER_18]: We did get an announcement that 8th Style is, in fact, on the way.

845
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:49,101
[SPEAKER_18]: 8th Style will be coming to the home soon.

846
00:57:50,616 --> 00:58:09,380
[SPEAKER_31]: more guitar freaks also I thought more guitar freaks would make me happy but it's not going to happen I thought that because it did so well they were going to look into their other games if they do, sign me up because I need more guitar dota at home

847
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:15,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so basically their website says something to this effect.

848
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:20,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Because 7th Style did better than they thought it would do, they're going to go ahead and make an 8th Style.

849
00:58:21,086 --> 00:58:25,691
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you to all of you that helped make Konami Style a purchase to continue supporting the project.

850
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:33,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Details will be on the 2DX website, official website, konamistyle.com, and in the Konami Style newsletter.

851
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:34,880
[SPEAKER_18]: You just have to wait.

852
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:35,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep

853
00:58:36,531 --> 00:58:40,073
[SPEAKER_18]: on helping them out and continuing the production of Beatmania 2DX sequels.

854
00:58:40,474 --> 00:58:44,356
[SPEAKER_18]: So it sounds like they might keep going, even after 8th style, if 8th style does well.

855
00:58:44,656 --> 00:58:47,798
[SPEAKER_18]: The question is, are we going to have to do any petitions this time?

856
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:51,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to have to do any, you know... God, I hope not.

857
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,081
[SPEAKER_18]: That was stupid.

858
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:57,944
[SPEAKER_18]: You remember I went off on Konami style on this show previously for having to make us do all those stupid questionnaires and everything.

859
00:58:58,305 --> 00:58:59,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Either make the game, or don't.

860
00:59:01,987 --> 00:59:03,108
[SPEAKER_18]: Quit making us have to work.

861
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,669
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the ones making money off it.

862
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:05,269
[SPEAKER_08]: You do the work.

863
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:07,508
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to fill out no damn petition.

864
00:59:08,769 --> 00:59:09,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez.

865
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:11,251
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

866
00:59:11,431 --> 00:59:12,552
[SPEAKER_31]: The 7th style is pretty.

867
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:16,255
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what's funny is I still never did buy 7th style.

868
00:59:16,275 --> 00:59:21,139
[SPEAKER_18]: I said I would buy 7th style, but because my controller kind of sucks, I haven't bothered with 7th style.

869
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,481
[SPEAKER_18]: And now I'm like, I'm all about poppin' music now.

870
00:59:23,521 --> 00:59:25,383
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, I need to get a poppin' music arcade style.

871
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:28,045
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

872
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:30,087
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see what happens.

873
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:36,285
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully 8th style does well too and then we'll see a 9th style in the future.

874
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:38,627
[SPEAKER_18]: But let's take it one step at a time, boys and girls.

875
00:59:39,888 --> 00:59:43,651
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully we will see 8th style at the end of the year.

876
00:59:44,732 --> 00:59:48,856
[SPEAKER_10]: But nothing confirmed yet.

877
00:59:50,157 --> 00:59:51,738
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's see.

878
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,899
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we want to do the cage match?

879
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:54,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, let's go to a break.

880
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:58,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Because there's still more news stories I want to talk about before we come back.

881
01:00:00,461 --> 01:00:05,042
[SPEAKER_18]: In this break, I guess since we heard about 8Style, we'll play something from 2DX8Style.

882
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:08,622
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll play this song.

883
01:00:08,702 --> 01:00:09,383
[SPEAKER_18]: I like this one.

884
01:00:09,463 --> 01:00:12,703
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we had a request for some poppin' music, so we'll work that in there too.

885
01:00:13,463 --> 01:00:14,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Some random poppin' music song.

886
01:00:15,164 --> 01:00:19,564
[SPEAKER_18]: And when we come back, some more news and all your favorite stuff.

887
01:00:19,704 --> 01:00:25,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio, Cage Match on the way, FU's on the way, and more exciting news.

888
01:00:26,226 --> 01:00:26,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

889
01:00:27,946 --> 01:00:28,406
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Jamie, yes.

890
01:00:28,426 --> 01:00:28,586
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

891
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:30,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes!

892
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:31,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we'll be back.

893
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:17,450
Thanks for watching!

894
01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:47,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Kamaba Chikyuu Yo Midatsu Fune Wa Uchuru Sentai Yamato Uchuu no Kanatai Kandaru Unmei Seoi Ima Tobikaze Kananatsu Tokoe

895
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:03,533
Thank you for watching.

896
01:03:03,553 --> 01:03:04,574
See you next time.

897
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:29,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

898
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:55,653
[SPEAKER_22]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

899
01:04:36,218 --> 01:04:37,879
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

900
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:36,374
Thank you for watching.

901
01:05:36,414 --> 01:05:37,514
See you next time.

902
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:22,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio and I just spilled Propel all over.

903
01:06:22,548 --> 01:06:25,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Now the cords tangle in my chair and everything is breaking.

904
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:26,109
[SPEAKER_31]: Poor Rob.

905
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:28,169
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I'll take this moment to answer John Field then.

906
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:29,130
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

907
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:36,311
[SPEAKER_31]: I want the song from End of Ava because I've been looking for it forever and my single was sort of stepped on by somebody.

908
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:37,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Ouch.

909
01:06:41,534 --> 01:06:41,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

910
01:06:43,257 --> 01:06:54,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Since some of you guys didn't seem to know those songs in the break... Uh, the songs in that break, uh, from 2DX8style, Love is Orange...

911
01:06:55,014 --> 01:07:11,038
[SPEAKER_18]: by Orange Lounge, Yamato, Space Warship Yamato by Sosasaki from Poppin' Music 7, and then in Poppin' Music 7 as well, we played a song by a group called Komotomoke, the genre is lonely, and the song, Artemis.

912
01:07:11,978 --> 01:07:18,500
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know a lot of you guys may not be as familiar with the Poppin' Music songs, so we'll play a few more for you guys tonight, just because we can.

913
01:07:20,146 --> 01:07:20,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, you are back.

914
01:07:20,546 --> 01:07:23,868
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe you can pick up that soundtrack they have, though, of the Anamelo 1 and 2.

915
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:24,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah?

916
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:26,869
[SPEAKER_31]: I came really close to it.

917
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:27,549
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really awesome.

918
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:29,390
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

919
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:30,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

920
01:07:31,951 --> 01:07:34,432
[SPEAKER_18]: We were talking about some Mamani news before we went to the break.

921
01:07:34,452 --> 01:07:36,833
[SPEAKER_18]: We were talking about the girl who had the heart attack playing DDR.

922
01:07:36,873 --> 01:07:39,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Even though that was, well, she wasn't really a heart attack, whatever it was.

923
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:41,414
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a couple weeks ago.

924
01:07:41,454 --> 01:07:44,195
[SPEAKER_18]: But as you may or may not know, we've been off the air for about three weeks.

925
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:47,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Because of problems out of our control, but we're back.

926
01:07:48,848 --> 01:07:53,811
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, real shows go off the air for like two months and you still watch them.

927
01:07:54,932 --> 01:07:58,094
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I don't think a two week break is too much to ask, people.

928
01:07:59,655 --> 01:08:04,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I thought this was interesting and I know Loki wants to talk about this.

929
01:08:04,338 --> 01:08:06,580
[SPEAKER_18]: You found something interesting on eBay this week, didn't you?

930
01:08:08,821 --> 01:08:09,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we have.

931
01:08:10,422 --> 01:08:12,063
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just been hitting the streets now.

932
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:23,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently the same people behind the wonderful bootleg DDR Megamix are back at it again with... For those who don't know what DDR Megamix is... My bad!

933
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:25,665
[SPEAKER_14]: God!

934
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just thinking I forget these things.

935
01:08:28,527 --> 01:08:38,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Now DDR Megamix is this really shitty bootleg that came out that basically was supposed to have the songs from 4th, 5th, and Extreme all in one cabinet, which would be pretty cool.

936
01:08:39,184 --> 01:08:49,032
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, all it was was DDR Extreme with really shitty graphics and glitched out shit and the wonderful warning screen don't fall off with two giant Star Wars AT-STs on there.

937
01:08:49,532 --> 01:08:51,874
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, that was really lame.

938
01:08:51,974 --> 01:09:00,741
[SPEAKER_14]: So this new one now has come out and is being distributed by some guy on the internet and it's also the same guy that is behind Megamix, as I said before.

939
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:04,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, what's new about this is, one, there's actual graphics.

940
01:09:04,324 --> 01:09:06,646
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not, like, fucked up graphics as before.

941
01:09:07,428 --> 01:09:10,770
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actual new graphics, which is stupid, who cares?

942
01:09:11,851 --> 01:09:17,694
[SPEAKER_14]: And the ability to speed up the tempo of a song up to 20%, which is pretty lame.

943
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:21,876
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus.

944
01:09:23,597 --> 01:09:26,539
[SPEAKER_14]: With, yeah, just really shitty stuff.

945
01:09:26,699 --> 01:09:27,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're selling it for $650.

946
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:31,021
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's the link in the chatroom.

947
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:33,889
[SPEAKER_18]: I love this ad.

948
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,710
[SPEAKER_18]: I just posted the link in the chat room there.

949
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:40,973
[SPEAKER_18]: It has this running theme going through the game, and that is like torso shots.

950
01:09:41,913 --> 01:09:42,373
[SPEAKER_18]: And look at this.

951
01:09:42,413 --> 01:09:47,576
[SPEAKER_18]: The logo, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus, is just the shot of a boob, basically.

952
01:09:47,596 --> 01:09:49,577
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the logo.

953
01:09:49,617 --> 01:09:50,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that.

954
01:09:50,557 --> 01:09:51,398
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a boob.

955
01:09:52,138 --> 01:09:52,979
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the marquee.

956
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:53,639
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a boob.

957
01:09:55,569 --> 01:09:58,310
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, um, oh, sorry, it's a breast.

958
01:09:59,911 --> 01:10:00,711
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a breast.

959
01:10:01,411 --> 01:10:06,393
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you have that same breast for light mode, and then there's beginner mode, which has a man breast.

960
01:10:06,733 --> 01:10:08,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Very nice man breast, I must say.

961
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,275
[SPEAKER_18]: And then on heavy mode, I don't know what the fuck that is.

962
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:14,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Then you have, like, a god, like Trinity from the Matrix.

963
01:10:16,697 --> 01:10:17,617
[SPEAKER_29]: It's the hermaphrodite.

964
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, let me read this ad for you guys, because it's hilarious.

965
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:24,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

966
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:49,456
[SPEAKER_18]: I will read this in my announcer voice here Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus is available now This is the latest upgrade for the DDR All new graphics with an incredible speed upgrade We asked the players what they wanted and they said Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up So we did Earnings results up by 40% Is that what everybody was saying?

967
01:10:49,556 --> 01:10:51,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up?

968
01:10:51,537 --> 01:10:53,419
[SPEAKER_31]: I think they were saying get rid of it faster

969
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:58,937
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think they were saying, give us new songs, give us new mix, new mix, new mix.

970
01:11:00,698 --> 01:11:02,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Not crappy bootlegs, crappy bootlegs.

971
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:10,560
[SPEAKER_18]: I love this, how you can bring up the screen and then you can speed up the song by 20%.

972
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a little problem, though, with it.

973
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:16,021
[SPEAKER_14]: A few things that just didn't quite work out.

974
01:11:16,802 --> 01:11:19,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, there is no heavy mode.

975
01:11:19,702 --> 01:11:22,403
[SPEAKER_14]: There's beginner, light, standard.

976
01:11:23,294 --> 01:11:26,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Heavy is only selectable on, you know, the song select screen.

977
01:11:26,897 --> 01:11:27,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two.

978
01:11:27,437 --> 01:11:31,720
[SPEAKER_14]: If you speed up the song save by 20%, okay, you're done with your game.

979
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:32,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Guess what?

980
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:35,582
[SPEAKER_14]: If the person doesn't set it back down to normal, they're still on 20%.

981
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:38,424
[SPEAKER_14]: It just stays that way.

982
01:11:38,825 --> 01:11:40,005
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really stupid.

983
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:41,707
[SPEAKER_30]: That should make Max 300 really fun.

984
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:47,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, actually, there's an arcade already in Australia that has this, and they said...

985
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:49,600
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's not that bad.

986
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,780
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually kind of fun to play the sped up songs.

987
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:53,641
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just a novelty, I think.

988
01:11:54,181 --> 01:12:04,926
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if they... See, what I thought when I first heard about DDR Extreme Plus, I thought it was, oh, someone's selling the hacked version of DDR Extreme with the extra modifiers on it.

989
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,606
[SPEAKER_14]: See, now that's what I would have done.

990
01:12:06,626 --> 01:12:10,388
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to hack it like this, you know, put those extra modifiers on there as well.

991
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:14,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, I'm going to simulate for you guys what this would sound like, okay?

992
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:16,270
[SPEAKER_18]: So here's a fast song already, alright?

993
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:17,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Waka Laka.

994
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:18,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Oops.

995
01:12:18,516 --> 01:12:19,797
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, let me play this for you guys.

996
01:12:22,099 --> 01:12:26,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, now let's see what it sounds like if we were to up the speed by 20%.

997
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:28,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Now you know how hard this song is already, right?

998
01:12:28,923 --> 01:12:29,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, here we go.

999
01:12:42,513 --> 01:12:44,054
[SPEAKER_18]: I would die trying to play this.

1000
01:12:44,714 --> 01:12:46,756
[SPEAKER_18]: This would give me a heart failure, okay?

1001
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:51,121
[SPEAKER_08]: They would have to get the defibrillators out for me on this crap.

1002
01:12:55,623 --> 01:12:57,103
[SPEAKER_30]: It made the song sound a little better, though.

1003
01:12:58,684 --> 01:12:59,164
[SPEAKER_14]: See you now.

1004
01:13:00,305 --> 01:13:00,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1005
01:13:03,026 --> 01:13:03,906
[SPEAKER_14]: This is really stupid.

1006
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:09,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Arcade owners are actually... The people that bought Megamix are ready to snatch this up for another $650.

1007
01:13:10,329 --> 01:13:12,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's how much Megamix was.

1008
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:16,672
[SPEAKER_14]: $650 to get a really shitty version of DDR Extreme with crap graphics.

1009
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:21,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Arcade owners actually paid this, so there's obviously money in this.

1010
01:13:22,033 --> 01:13:25,516
[SPEAKER_14]: And, now, this is distributed through a company called Dakota Games.

1011
01:13:25,976 --> 01:13:37,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Dakota Games is also known for another hack that's Daytona CRX, which is basically Daytona with Super Off-Road added to it.

1012
01:13:37,283 --> 01:13:45,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it's the ability, which is kind of cool, it's the ability to save profiles and you upgrade car parts and stuff to make your cars have

1013
01:13:45,851 --> 01:13:48,172
[SPEAKER_14]: More speed, more traction, etc.

1014
01:13:48,472 --> 01:13:49,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, that's a cool feature.

1015
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,193
[SPEAKER_14]: It adds, you know, stuff to the game.

1016
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:55,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this, while it being a really shitty hack, it does add features to it.

1017
01:13:55,914 --> 01:14:03,497
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it's a really... I wouldn't go spend $650 on it, but hey, whatever.

1018
01:14:03,637 --> 01:14:07,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, at least it's not like Megamix, but it is still crap.

1019
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:10,039
[SPEAKER_14]: It's getting better, though.

1020
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:11,480
[SPEAKER_14]: They're starting to learn.

1021
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,661
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually did something I didn't think, you know, of, so...

1022
01:14:15,948 --> 01:14:16,969
[SPEAKER_14]: More power to them, I guess.

1023
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:25,032
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what to think about this whole, like, we're going to do the tempo change and change the game here.

1024
01:14:25,052 --> 01:14:28,854
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would have been cool if they had to slow it down by 20% mode.

1025
01:14:29,114 --> 01:14:30,094
[SPEAKER_18]: That would have been cool.

1026
01:14:31,715 --> 01:14:35,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, now I've got to try it again to see what slowed down 20% would sound like.

1027
01:14:37,057 --> 01:14:37,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I do.

1028
01:14:39,178 --> 01:14:39,919
[SPEAKER_18]: You know you want to hear it.

1029
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:42,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Ugh.

1030
01:14:43,615 --> 01:14:44,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, what do you think of this?

1031
01:14:44,576 --> 01:14:48,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you ever play this game, or is this just utter crap to you, or what?

1032
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,602
[SPEAKER_31]: I have two words for this.

1033
01:14:51,963 --> 01:14:53,425
[SPEAKER_31]: Hell no.

1034
01:14:54,306 --> 01:14:54,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not?

1035
01:14:55,126 --> 01:14:56,568
[SPEAKER_31]: Because it's just stupid.

1036
01:14:56,648 --> 01:15:02,594
[SPEAKER_31]: If I want to play DDR, I would go play, like, you know, Max 2 or Extreme.

1037
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:06,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to add that, you know that arcade chain Tilt that's in...

1038
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Waka Laka Slow Down

1039
01:15:32,264 --> 01:15:33,045
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can get it to play.

1040
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:33,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1041
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:36,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Now let's see what it'll be down 20%.

1042
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:43,852
[SPEAKER_27]: Now I can beat it.

1043
01:15:44,312 --> 01:15:47,654
[SPEAKER_27]: Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

1044
01:15:47,694 --> 01:15:49,656
[SPEAKER_18]: This is like training mode, kind of.

1045
01:15:53,338 --> 01:15:54,639
[SPEAKER_18]: I can almost stand this song now.

1046
01:16:04,364 --> 01:16:05,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Jenny, Ranma, and the Demon.

1047
01:16:05,845 --> 01:16:11,110
[SPEAKER_18]: See, we knew there was something to that Devil Devil Revolution thing going on.

1048
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:17,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Chatroom is letting you know that somebody who says they worked for Tilt said they did not upgrade all the machines.

1049
01:16:17,836 --> 01:16:19,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that still doesn't matter.

1050
01:16:19,318 --> 01:16:20,699
[SPEAKER_13]: You upgraded some of them.

1051
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:21,820
[SPEAKER_13]: That still makes you stupid.

1052
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:27,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so glad that... It's like, I didn't inject all the heroin.

1053
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Jamie?

1054
01:16:31,741 --> 01:16:35,683
[SPEAKER_31]: The tilt in my town of birth was bought out by Namco, thank God.

1055
01:16:36,983 --> 01:16:38,084
[SPEAKER_31]: So it doesn't suck.

1056
01:16:42,786 --> 01:16:46,027
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some other news we want to share with you guys, unless anybody else has anything to say on Megamix.

1057
01:16:47,328 --> 01:16:48,428
[SPEAKER_31]: Can I burp?

1058
01:16:49,709 --> 01:16:49,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

1059
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:51,931
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1060
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:53,092
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't have to now.

1061
01:17:17,045 --> 01:17:22,510
[SPEAKER_18]: That should be a very good read, so check DDRspot.com the next couple days and wait for that.

1062
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:28,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, he's looking for, they scored an interview, DDRspot also scored an interview with Naoki.

1063
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,100
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going to be doing an interview with Naoki in the next few days.

1064
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:40,782
[SPEAKER_18]: They are still looking to field questions, so Mel has said his email box is open to you guys if you want to send him some questions.

1065
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:49,384
[SPEAKER_18]: I know this is ironic because the interview is for DDR Spot, but if you want to send Mel an email, if you have a question for Naoki, Mel will consider all your questions.

1066
01:17:49,404 --> 01:17:55,065
[SPEAKER_18]: He won't ask everything, because if everybody sends a question, that interview is going to be an hour long, but he'll consider all your stuff.

1067
01:17:55,745 --> 01:17:59,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Mel at DDRFreak.com is his email.

1068
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:05,614
[SPEAKER_18]: So, just send that along if you have a question you would like to ask Naoki.

1069
01:18:06,174 --> 01:18:08,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Such as, you want some fashion tips?

1070
01:18:10,618 --> 01:18:11,298
[SPEAKER_30]: Who does his hair?

1071
01:18:11,718 --> 01:18:13,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Naoki eye for the straight guy.

1072
01:18:14,641 --> 01:18:16,222
[SPEAKER_18]: How deep in the punani are you?

1073
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:18,403
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1074
01:18:23,307 --> 01:18:25,809
[SPEAKER_18]: See, the questions I want to ask, Mel isn't going to ask.

1075
01:18:25,829 --> 01:18:25,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1076
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:32,483
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know if he ever really has boinked, Paula Terry, or if it's a purely professional relationship.

1077
01:18:37,066 --> 01:18:38,207
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love to have Nokia.

1078
01:18:38,307 --> 01:18:42,390
[SPEAKER_18]: I would give a lot of head to get any Bomani celebrity on this show.

1079
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:44,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Because then that means we've made it.

1080
01:18:47,353 --> 01:18:48,034
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good idea.

1081
01:18:48,394 --> 01:18:53,117
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we were supposed to have an interview with Jason Enos from Konami, but...

1082
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:57,457
[SPEAKER_18]: In typical Orange Lounge fashion, that all got fucked up.

1083
01:18:57,597 --> 01:19:00,680
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, and I missed my chance to go hang out with the man, thank you.

1084
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:09,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is too bad, because it was a... Honestly, guys, I hate to say this, it was a great interview, because Loki fucking asked... I can't believe you had the balls to do this.

1085
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:12,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki fucking asked him about Into the Groove, okay?

1086
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,411
[SPEAKER_31]: He had a very good answer.

1087
01:19:14,451 --> 01:19:16,913
[SPEAKER_18]: He had a very good answer, and I wish I could remember it.

1088
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:21,216
[SPEAKER_31]: It was easy to encourage the community to keep growing.

1089
01:19:21,997 --> 01:19:23,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, something like that.

1090
01:19:25,441 --> 01:19:26,081
[SPEAKER_18]: It was something like that.

1091
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:31,224
[SPEAKER_18]: He basically was welcoming the challenge, basically.

1092
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:33,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Which I thought was very professional.

1093
01:19:34,046 --> 01:19:34,646
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a good guy.

1094
01:19:34,806 --> 01:19:36,768
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sad about what happened to the interview.

1095
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:42,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, what he told us off-air was hilarious.

1096
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,051
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm just kidding.

1097
01:19:44,352 --> 01:19:49,295
[SPEAKER_18]: We thank him for taking the time to do the interview with us, even though it never aired, because mistakes happen.

1098
01:19:51,516 --> 01:19:52,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Bad mistakes happen.

1099
01:19:55,478 --> 01:19:56,778
[SPEAKER_14]: We could have brought back Portal.

1100
01:19:57,739 --> 01:19:59,159
[SPEAKER_18]: That's very true.

1101
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,260
[SPEAKER_18]: We could have merged with G4, okay?

1102
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:04,321
[SPEAKER_18]: That could have been what happened.

1103
01:20:04,941 --> 01:20:06,241
Yeah, I wouldn't mind that.

1104
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:07,782
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true.

1105
01:20:08,482 --> 01:20:11,863
[SPEAKER_31]: I wouldn't mind Taka and Taku naked in the same room.

1106
01:20:13,244 --> 01:20:13,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1107
01:20:14,504 --> 01:20:16,765
[SPEAKER_31]: In response to Jason in the chatroom.

1108
01:20:17,005 --> 01:20:20,766
[SPEAKER_18]: While Jamie lives out her fantasy over there, perhaps... I'm not living out any fantasy!

1109
01:20:23,993 --> 01:20:25,214
[SPEAKER_18]: You have another news story you want to talk about?

1110
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:28,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, stuff unrelated with... Okay, fine, Loki.

1111
01:20:29,096 --> 01:20:37,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm not quite on, you know, the pulse of all the new music games that come out, this one kind of slipped under my radar.

1112
01:20:37,902 --> 01:20:40,764
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a game called I Can Boogie.

1113
01:20:42,105 --> 01:20:42,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1114
01:20:43,706 --> 01:20:45,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Say that one more time, Loki.

1115
01:20:46,069 --> 01:20:47,450
[SPEAKER_14]: You're an ass, okay?

1116
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,311
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called I Can Boogie, okay?

1117
01:20:49,432 --> 01:20:55,996
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically, if you were to take iToy Groove, put it in an arcade cabinet that looks something like Pump It Up, that's what you've got.

1118
01:20:56,897 --> 01:20:58,098
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks pretty cool.

1119
01:20:58,178 --> 01:21:05,443
[SPEAKER_14]: We just got it down at one of our arcades in the Century 14 in Roseville, down near Sacramento.

1120
01:21:05,644 --> 01:21:06,684
[SPEAKER_14]: We got one of these things.

1121
01:21:06,884 --> 01:21:09,566
[SPEAKER_14]: I have yet to play it, but it sounds really cool.

1122
01:21:09,586 --> 01:21:11,188
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks kind of neat.

1123
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:15,551
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got actual music from artists, no covers or anything, hot stuff.

1124
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,100
[SPEAKER_14]: from Donna Summers.

1125
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:26,424
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got, was it, something like Jan Jackson on there and some other stuff.

1126
01:21:26,724 --> 01:21:27,584
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty good, though.

1127
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:33,887
[SPEAKER_14]: It just looks interesting because it uses a camera just like, you know, iToy Groove.

1128
01:21:35,047 --> 01:21:38,989
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if you've got one of these by you, because I also heard there's one at Dave & Buster's in Milpitas.

1129
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:40,629
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've got one by you, you should check it out.

1130
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:45,011
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, that was all I had.

1131
01:21:45,805 --> 01:21:53,670
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can find that at, I believe, iKinGroove.com But you actually haven't gotten a chance to play this yet.

1132
01:21:54,251 --> 01:21:54,831
No, not yet.

1133
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:55,411
[SPEAKER_18]: Not yet.

1134
01:21:59,694 --> 01:22:00,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1135
01:22:02,336 --> 01:22:04,497
[SPEAKER_18]: So they basically turned iToy Groove into an arcade game.

1136
01:22:04,537 --> 01:22:06,679
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody stole that idea and turned it into an arcade game.

1137
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:07,519
Yeah.

1138
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:08,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

1139
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,222
[SPEAKER_18]: iToy Groove... I wasn't that thrilled with iToy Groove.

1140
01:22:11,262 --> 01:22:13,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, it was cool for a day, and then that was it.

1141
01:22:13,823 --> 01:22:14,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I don't know...

1142
01:22:15,816 --> 01:22:22,719
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why that game just didn't do it for me, but the thing is with this arcade game, it's like a cross between Itoy Groove and Parapara.

1143
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:24,700
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much what it is.

1144
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:32,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's, I think, there's five points, like five sensors, spots that you have to hit, you know, depending on how the arrows come.

1145
01:22:34,085 --> 01:22:36,186
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've got, you know, pretty interesting stuff.

1146
01:22:36,646 --> 01:22:36,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1147
01:22:38,024 --> 01:23:00,134
[SPEAKER_14]: on there, um, that was, oh, that was the other thing, since someone mentioned DDR Karaoke Mix, there was actually one of those very, very, very rare arcade games being sold on Yahoo Auctions for $1,600 at Karaoke Revolution 2nd Mix, or not Karaoke Revolution, um, DDR Karaoke Mix 2nd Mix, which I thought that was pretty sweet.

1148
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:05,336
[SPEAKER_14]: If I had that kind of, you know, cash, I would buy one, but I don't, so...

1149
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:09,947
[SPEAKER_31]: My second mix substream.

1150
01:23:11,688 --> 01:23:12,028
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh yeah.

1151
01:23:12,209 --> 01:23:13,489
[SPEAKER_18]: You have the 2DX machine too?

1152
01:23:13,769 --> 01:23:14,490
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what I want.

1153
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:15,390
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

1154
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:19,933
[SPEAKER_18]: You have the only one in the US, I think.

1155
01:23:20,534 --> 01:23:32,821
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, we said right off the bat when we buy our house we're getting a DDR machine and I'm thinking of trying to get that in the... I want to get an actual second style build substream machine.

1156
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:35,477
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, the old style monitor and everything.

1157
01:23:36,438 --> 01:23:36,698
[SPEAKER_31]: I know.

1158
01:23:37,578 --> 01:23:37,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1159
01:23:37,998 --> 01:23:41,200
[SPEAKER_31]: But if I can, I doubt it would be that expensive for that particular machine.

1160
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:44,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, good luck to you.

1161
01:23:45,502 --> 01:23:47,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, you guys want to have yourselves a cage match?

1162
01:23:47,203 --> 01:23:49,064
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't had one of these in a while, it feels like.

1163
01:23:49,264 --> 01:23:49,904
[SPEAKER_06]: We sure haven't.

1164
01:23:50,045 --> 01:23:52,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, there's going to be kind of a small twist in tonight's cage match.

1165
01:23:55,434 --> 01:24:05,703
[SPEAKER_18]: The twist in tonight's cage match is that we are cleaning the slate and we're not going to carry a winner over from the show three weeks ago because basically it's won for like three weeks now by default.

1166
01:24:06,023 --> 01:24:11,488
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are wiping the slate clean and we're starting off with three brand new songs tonight in tonight's cage match.

1167
01:24:11,908 --> 01:24:16,652
[SPEAKER_18]: So the way the cage match works, each host brings one song to the table.

1168
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:35,298
[SPEAKER_18]: and we're going to play these songs and then you're going to vote on your favorite in the chat room and your song that you pick as your favorite will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program with all your favorite DDR, 2DX and Dance Mania favorites that'll include the cage match winner from tonight

1169
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:37,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we'll go into rotation.

1170
01:24:37,438 --> 01:24:40,641
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it'll come back next week to compete again against two challengers.

1171
01:24:41,101 --> 01:24:44,724
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we get a clean slate tonight, so that means we're gonna hear three new songs in full.

1172
01:24:45,224 --> 01:24:56,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Cage Match kinda used to have this theme of songs that would be good for Bomani, like DDR, 2DX, but now it's kind of evolved into cool stuff, but looking at tonight's lineup, I'd say we're kinda going back to our roots here.

1173
01:24:56,913 --> 01:25:00,815
[SPEAKER_18]: All three of these songs look to be songs that'll be made for Bomani.

1174
01:25:01,236 --> 01:25:03,057
[SPEAKER_18]: So this should be a fun Cage Match tonight.

1175
01:25:03,297 --> 01:25:03,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Not mine.

1176
01:25:05,288 --> 01:25:06,529
[SPEAKER_18]: So make sure you are in.

1177
01:25:06,549 --> 01:25:09,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'm just looking at your artists and knowing their music.

1178
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:10,772
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1179
01:25:12,414 --> 01:25:14,255
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to vote, remember you have to be in our chat room.

1180

1182
01:25:17,778 --> 01:25:18,338
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we go.

1183
01:25:18,999 --> 01:25:25,964
[SPEAKER_18]: First up tonight is Loki and he's actually the one who won three weeks ago but we couldn't even remember what song it was so we're giving him a new song tonight.

1184
01:25:26,314 --> 01:25:28,075
[SPEAKER_18]: What song are you putting in the cage match tonight?

1185
01:25:28,995 --> 01:25:37,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I've put this artist in a few times now, and since they have a new song that's going to be in DDR Extreme, I thought, hey, let's take a song from another game, Need for Speed Underground.

1186
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:43,541
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is also featured in Tourney Mix 5, if anyone really gives a damn about that.

1187
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:52,164
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is BT featuring Wild Side with... I think it was Wild Side or Wild Style.

1188
01:25:52,885 --> 01:25:53,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, something...

1189
01:25:54,468 --> 01:26:00,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Wild Side is the Irresistible Mom band from Xtreme, so I don't think it's that.

1190
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:02,912
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be Wild Style, I think.

1191
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:07,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, it's BT featuring Wild Style, and this is Kimo Sabe.

1192
01:26:07,553 --> 01:26:09,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here it is.

1193
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:11,375
[SPEAKER_30]: That was in Frequency.

1194
01:26:12,315 --> 01:26:12,996
[SPEAKER_13]: What's in Frequency?

1195
01:26:13,716 --> 01:26:14,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, okay.

1196
01:26:14,856 --> 01:26:16,837
[SPEAKER_31]: Is it in Frequency or Amplitude, too?

1197
01:26:16,977 --> 01:26:18,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, here it is.

1198
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:18,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy it.

1199
01:26:18,738 --> 01:26:20,739
[SPEAKER_18]: BT, Kimo Sabe, song number one.

1200
01:28:11,303 --> 01:28:11,717
Full Effect

1201
01:28:53,706 --> 01:28:55,924
I bust positive vibes from the west to Maui

1202
01:29:29,588 --> 01:29:31,253
Pull it back Pull it back

1203
01:30:32,741 --> 01:30:33,384
Thanks for watching!

1204
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:10,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch out for my man B.T.

1205
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:10,870
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1206
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:11,290
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1207
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:11,410
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1208
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:11,510
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1209
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:11,910
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1210
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:12,090
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1211
01:31:12,251 --> 01:31:12,311
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1212
01:31:12,331 --> 01:31:12,471
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1213
01:31:12,491 --> 01:31:12,691
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1214
01:31:12,731 --> 01:31:12,851
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1215
01:31:12,871 --> 01:31:13,031
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1216
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:13,091
[SPEAKER_06]: B.T.

1217
01:31:40,964 --> 01:31:42,105
[SPEAKER_30]: I've heard that song a whole lot.

1218
01:31:44,307 --> 01:31:45,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Loki.

1219
01:31:46,488 --> 01:31:49,190
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my favorite song in Tourney Mix 5, so it gets a 10.

1220
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:50,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

1221
01:31:52,093 --> 01:31:55,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, to be honest, BT just doesn't do it for me.

1222
01:31:55,175 --> 01:32:00,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Like a lot of other artists in his genre do, and especially that song just doesn't do it for me.

1223
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,521
[SPEAKER_18]: So I give it like a, it's okay.

1224
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:04,802
[SPEAKER_18]: So I give it like an okay score of like 6.5.

1225
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:08,165
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, it just doesn't do it for me.

1226
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:11,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, it's not gay enough, I think that's what it is.

1227
01:32:11,871 --> 01:32:14,192
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how you got that confused.

1228
01:32:14,852 --> 01:32:16,753
[SPEAKER_18]: When I heard Wild Side, I got excited.

1229
01:32:17,233 --> 01:32:18,674
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, it was Wild Child.

1230
01:32:19,094 --> 01:32:20,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on.

1231
01:32:21,034 --> 01:32:23,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us from Jamie.

1232
01:32:24,236 --> 01:32:28,037
[SPEAKER_18]: And I gotta say, I'm a little bit surprised at her pick, but let's see what's up.

1233
01:32:28,217 --> 01:32:30,398
[SPEAKER_31]: My song has the power of porn behind it.

1234
01:32:31,411 --> 01:32:33,792
[SPEAKER_31]: It's Tracy Lord, let's say something.

1235
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:35,513
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, this is the thing.

1236
01:32:35,713 --> 01:32:40,936
[SPEAKER_31]: I went on a big downloading spree trying to find this one Tracy Lord song.

1237
01:32:42,137 --> 01:32:43,998
[SPEAKER_31]: And if anyone knows what this is, please tell me.

1238
01:32:44,178 --> 01:32:45,899
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm in the chat room right now, 7 p.m.

1239
01:32:46,339 --> 01:32:48,940
[SPEAKER_31]: It's one about this woman getting revenge on a cowboy.

1240
01:32:51,142 --> 01:32:53,603
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not Fallen Angel?

1241
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:54,704
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not Fallen Angel.

1242
01:32:55,464 --> 01:32:59,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a remix of a Tracy Lord song done by Paula Confold.

1243
01:32:59,912 --> 01:33:00,572
[SPEAKER_31]: Dude, I want that.

1244
01:33:00,592 --> 01:33:05,255
[SPEAKER_31]: Good for you!

1245
01:33:05,295 --> 01:33:09,117
[SPEAKER_31]: But it... I heard the song, like, when I was in college the first time.

1246
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:09,917
[SPEAKER_31]: That was, like, in 95.

1247
01:33:10,057 --> 01:33:15,520
[SPEAKER_31]: And the CD was about a year old then, so if that helps anybody, find the song for me.

1248
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:21,123
[SPEAKER_31]: But anyway, this particular one, this one is, like, it definitely has the power of porn behind it.

1249
01:33:21,383 --> 01:33:26,966
[SPEAKER_31]: Because this is, like, a song that someone would participate in nocturnal activities to.

1250
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:29,680
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my, nocturnal activities.

1251
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's hear it then.

1252
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:38,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Tracy Lord's Say Something.

1253
01:33:38,964 --> 01:33:39,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

1254
01:33:57,795 --> 01:33:58,036
Thank you.

1255
01:34:55,373 --> 01:34:57,475
How did you know I am lonely?

1256
01:34:57,495 --> 01:35:00,458
Dear mama, say something How did you know I am lonely?

1257
01:35:00,478 --> 01:35:02,679
Dear mama, say something How did you know I am lonely?

1258
01:35:30,299 --> 01:35:31,744
Thanks for watching!

1259
01:36:24,505 --> 01:36:26,827
How did you know I am only here a moment?

1260
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:29,649
Say something How did you know I am only here a moment?

1261
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:29,769
Say

1262
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:54,411
Thanks for watching!

1263
01:37:51,874 --> 01:37:53,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two was right there.

1264
01:37:53,215 --> 01:37:55,236
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Tracy Lords with Say Something.

1265
01:37:55,657 --> 01:37:56,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Say something about that song, Jamie.

1266
01:37:59,039 --> 01:37:59,839
[SPEAKER_31]: I like that song.

1267
01:37:59,859 --> 01:38:03,322
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm going to give it an eight.

1268
01:38:03,702 --> 01:38:04,562
[SPEAKER_31]: She's done better.

1269
01:38:05,203 --> 01:38:06,524
[SPEAKER_31]: Apparently she sucks live.

1270
01:38:08,085 --> 01:38:08,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Imagine that.

1271
01:38:09,345 --> 01:38:13,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Porn star given music career who can't really sing without a studio.

1272
01:38:13,989 --> 01:38:17,931
[SPEAKER_31]: Dan said that he went to some show that was going on that had like Moby and a bunch of people.

1273
01:38:17,951 --> 01:38:19,012
[SPEAKER_31]: This was a few years ago.

1274
01:38:20,273 --> 01:38:25,435
[SPEAKER_31]: He said that Moby got naked and tried scratching wood.

1275
01:38:25,535 --> 01:38:27,716
[SPEAKER_31]: But he said that she wasn't very good live.

1276
01:38:27,756 --> 01:38:29,116
[SPEAKER_31]: But I don't know, the song was okay.

1277
01:38:29,176 --> 01:38:30,357
[SPEAKER_31]: It sort of reminds me of Slow.

1278
01:38:31,818 --> 01:38:32,598
[SPEAKER_31]: So I give it an 8.

1279
01:38:34,419 --> 01:38:34,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

1280
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:38,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, did Loki go second or did I go second?

1281
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:39,040
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember.

1282
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki went second, I think.

1283
01:38:41,601 --> 01:38:43,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I could see fucking to that.

1284
01:38:46,083 --> 01:38:48,204
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give it an 8, because...

1285
01:38:49,008 --> 01:38:49,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Tracy Lords is cool.

1286
01:38:50,269 --> 01:38:51,010
[SPEAKER_14]: She did Control.

1287
01:38:53,532 --> 01:38:55,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, yeah, that's definitely a song to fuck to.

1288
01:38:56,574 --> 01:39:02,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I don't know if I could imagine it on our station regularly, but, um, it's unique.

1289
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,541
[SPEAKER_18]: And it did get me a little horny.

1290
01:39:04,681 --> 01:39:05,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a little bit.

1291
01:39:05,962 --> 01:39:06,763
[SPEAKER_18]: Just kidding, just kidding.

1292
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,242
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't get the slow comparison though.

1293
01:39:10,262 --> 01:39:13,906
[SPEAKER_29]: They're both slow songs, but Kylie's way...

1294
01:39:32,093 --> 01:39:33,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Your votes count though, not ours.

1295
01:39:33,594 --> 01:39:36,656
[SPEAKER_18]: There is one more song you get to vote for, possibly, if you want to.

1296
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:38,417
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's My Pick.

1297
01:39:39,258 --> 01:39:45,742
[SPEAKER_18]: My Pick is an artist that you've actually already heard on our station because she was on a Dance Mania album.

1298
01:39:46,282 --> 01:39:48,564
[SPEAKER_18]: And she used to be with a group, you might have heard of them.

1299
01:39:48,984 --> 01:39:50,445
[SPEAKER_18]: You know the Spice Girls?

1300
01:39:50,685 --> 01:39:51,766
[SPEAKER_18]: You ever heard of the Spice Girls?

1301
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:54,351
[SPEAKER_30]: I was laughing at the Sam magazine.

1302
01:39:54,391 --> 01:39:56,013
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

1303
01:39:57,254 --> 01:40:01,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Sporty Spice has a solo career, believe it or not, and she has some big dance hits.

1304
01:40:02,278 --> 01:40:09,905
[SPEAKER_18]: I too, like Jamie, went on a downloading spree this week, and I was downloading all these British dance compilations, and this song turned up on one of them, and I kind of liked it.

1305
01:40:10,466 --> 01:40:12,287
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to put it in tonight's cage match.

1306
01:40:12,348 --> 01:40:17,912
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Melanie C, and the song is Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, and it's the Shanghai Surprise remix.

1307
01:40:18,866 --> 01:40:21,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Wasn't that the movie with Madonna and Sean Penn from like years ago?

1308
01:40:21,969 --> 01:40:22,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Shanghai Surprise?

1309
01:40:24,311 --> 01:40:26,012
[SPEAKER_30]: That was supposed to be like this horrible movie.

1310
01:40:26,212 --> 01:40:28,514
[SPEAKER_18]: I assure you this song is way better than the movie.

1311
01:40:28,534 --> 01:40:29,435
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I think so.

1312
01:40:30,876 --> 01:40:33,438
[SPEAKER_18]: The rest of you, I don't care what you think, but we'll see.

1313
01:40:33,478 --> 01:40:34,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully you'll like it.

1314
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:36,541
[SPEAKER_29]: I found the page with the old guy again.

1315
01:40:38,743 --> 01:40:41,645
[SPEAKER_18]: The listeners don't even know what you're doing over there.

1316
01:40:41,665 --> 01:40:42,786
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, I'm not going to say anything.

1317
01:40:42,826 --> 01:40:43,327
[SPEAKER_18]: You shouldn't.

1318
01:40:43,427 --> 01:40:43,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1319
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, here comes Loki.

1320
01:40:47,062 --> 01:40:55,167
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on a mission Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you're with me, raise your hands Yeah, yeah, yeah, got no inhibitions, it's our decision

1321
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:21,821
Easy girl, don't let go Be given to yourself tonight

01:44:51,944 --> 01:44:53,444
[SPEAKER_18]: All righty, song number three tonight.

1326
01:44:53,564 --> 01:44:55,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

1327
01:44:55,685 --> 01:44:56,445
[SPEAKER_18]: What'd you think?

1328
01:44:56,545 --> 01:44:58,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah Yeah Yeah or Oh Hell No?

1329
01:44:58,745 --> 01:44:59,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie?

1330
01:44:59,186 --> 01:45:00,106
[SPEAKER_31]: It gets a yeah.

1331
01:45:00,626 --> 01:45:03,567
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, it's good, don't get me wrong.

1332
01:45:03,627 --> 01:45:04,887
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just kind of generic, you know.

1333
01:45:05,447 --> 01:45:08,348
[SPEAKER_31]: So it gets a six, seven-ish.

1334
01:45:09,188 --> 01:45:09,568
[SPEAKER_30]: Seven-ish.

1335
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:11,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven-ish from Jamie.

1336
01:45:11,209 --> 01:45:11,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki?

1337
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:19,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard this somewhere before, I don't know if it's another artist's song or what, but I don't like the Spice Girls.

1338
01:45:20,263 --> 01:45:25,004
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like Melanin C. The only thing they're good in is nude pictures.

1339
01:45:26,145 --> 01:45:30,146
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, yeah, I give it a yeah, yeah, yeah, five.

1340
01:45:32,274 --> 01:45:38,940
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, to me that song, it's so British, and it's like a song I would hear at a soccer game, seriously.

1341
01:45:39,901 --> 01:45:42,843
[SPEAKER_18]: And that so fits 45, I'm sorry, football.

1342
01:45:43,384 --> 01:45:44,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Football!

1343
01:45:44,044 --> 01:45:46,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Goal!

1344
01:45:46,386 --> 01:45:48,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1345
01:45:48,388 --> 01:45:49,148
[SPEAKER_18]: So I could hear that.

1346
01:45:49,929 --> 01:45:52,711
[SPEAKER_18]: So I give it like an 8, because I think that would be fun for DDR.

1347
01:45:52,952 --> 01:45:55,273
[SPEAKER_18]: I might do a sim file to it if I get unlazy, ever.

1348
01:45:55,834 --> 01:45:59,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's review the three songs before I open up the voting lines.

1349
01:45:59,761 --> 01:46:04,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go, a review of the three songs you can vote for tonight, because it is up to you.

1350
01:46:04,745 --> 01:46:08,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number one, BT featuring Wildchild, Kimo Sabe.

1351
01:46:14,834 --> 01:46:18,317
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two tonight, Tracy Lords with Say Something.

1352
01:46:19,058 --> 01:46:20,599
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you know I am lonely?

1353
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:30,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

1354
01:46:39,586 --> 01:46:42,969
[SPEAKER_18]: All righty, place vote now.

1355
01:46:43,129 --> 01:46:46,051
[SPEAKER_18]: To place your votes, just send Sky a message in the chatroom.

1356
01:46:46,071 --> 01:46:48,493
[SPEAKER_18]: That's me, talking about myself in the third person again.

1357
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:51,335
[SPEAKER_18]: Send me a message in the chatroom with your vote.

1358
01:46:51,795 --> 01:46:57,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1359
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:01,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Meanwhile, back to some of the news we missed the three weeks we were out.

1360
01:47:01,842 --> 01:47:06,506
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, another article that came out while we were gone was on the Fox News Channel.

1361
01:47:07,674 --> 01:47:08,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Fox News Channel.

1362
01:47:08,334 --> 01:47:09,535
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys know Fox News Channel?

1363
01:47:10,135 --> 01:47:13,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Home of the Bill O'Reilly show and all those fun conservative talk programs.

1364
01:47:13,897 --> 01:47:14,837
[SPEAKER_30]: If I didn't watch TV.

1365
01:47:15,617 --> 01:47:16,858
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well, I know you don't watch TV.

1366
01:47:16,938 --> 01:47:18,098
[SPEAKER_30]: I think I know, though.

1367
01:47:18,138 --> 01:47:22,440
[SPEAKER_18]: They're giving CNN a little bit of a run because they have some talk programs that people, for some reason, like.

1368
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:23,781
[SPEAKER_18]: But whatever.

1369
01:47:23,921 --> 01:47:24,701
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't hate right now.

1370
01:47:25,001 --> 01:47:29,143
[SPEAKER_18]: But actually, they ran an article about DDR and a weight loss article.

1371
01:47:31,357 --> 01:47:34,379
[SPEAKER_18]: It's again another, isn't DDR great because people lost weight playing it?

1372
01:47:34,419 --> 01:47:38,061
[SPEAKER_18]: But this article quotes some friends of the show.

1373
01:47:38,681 --> 01:47:41,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Some buddies of Orange Lounge Radio were quoted in this article.

1374
01:47:42,403 --> 01:47:46,346
[SPEAKER_18]: And Mel B and Sharksgirl were both quoted in this article, which I thought was cool.

1375
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:47,506
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so good for them.

1376
01:47:48,027 --> 01:47:49,667
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a link to it over there on a website.

1377
01:47:49,868 --> 01:47:51,288
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll kind of summarize for you guys.

1378
01:47:52,749 --> 01:47:57,652
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just kind of talking about, you know, it breaks down how to play DDR, how DDR is played.

1379
01:47:58,712 --> 01:48:03,715
[SPEAKER_18]: says the assistant editor at Wired Magazine, you're literally controlling the game with your whole body and not just your fingertips.

1380
01:48:04,096 --> 01:48:06,997
[SPEAKER_18]: It's definitely a new genre that will probably get bigger.

1381
01:48:10,579 --> 01:48:11,360
[SPEAKER_31]: That will probably.

1382
01:48:12,381 --> 01:48:13,341
[SPEAKER_18]: It might get a little bigger.

1383
01:48:13,521 --> 01:48:13,741
[SPEAKER_31]: Might.

1384
01:48:14,222 --> 01:48:17,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Assuming it doesn't kill off its players with heart attacks.

1385
01:48:21,046 --> 01:48:26,709
[SPEAKER_18]: But a relatively new genre, I don't know about you guys, but I've known about this game for

1386
01:48:27,745 --> 01:48:28,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn near four years now.

1387
01:48:29,106 --> 01:48:32,128
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know about the rest of you guys, but that's not that new.

1388
01:48:33,189 --> 01:48:35,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm sorry, but it's not old school like Christ.

1389
01:48:39,234 --> 01:48:41,016
[SPEAKER_14]: That is like way old school, man.

1390
01:48:42,417 --> 01:48:44,038
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR is like a lot better.

1391
01:48:45,157 --> 01:48:48,118
[SPEAKER_14]: He's probably talking about the history of time thing.

1392
01:48:48,559 --> 01:48:49,879
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be relatively new.

1393
01:48:50,759 --> 01:48:51,660
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right.

1394
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:54,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Considering the entire history of time, it would be new.

1395
01:48:54,681 --> 01:48:59,603
[SPEAKER_18]: And considering that a lot of people that watch Fox News Channel are old people, it would make sense.

1396
01:49:00,763 --> 01:49:09,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Our buddy Mel Baltazar says he was drawn to DDR because he likes music-based games, but after a while he noticed an unexpected side benefit.

1397
01:49:11,147 --> 01:49:11,347
What?

1398
01:49:13,084 --> 01:49:14,325
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not heart attacks.

1399
01:49:16,046 --> 01:49:18,888
[SPEAKER_18]: In the first four months or so, I lost around 30 pounds.

1400
01:49:18,988 --> 01:49:20,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, from Mel, it would have sounded something like this.

1401
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:25,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Yo, dawg, in the first 40 months or so, dawg, I lost around 30 pounds, dawg.

1402
01:49:25,393 --> 01:49:26,154
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

1403
01:49:28,635 --> 01:49:29,436
[SPEAKER_18]: He's going to kick my ass.

1404
01:49:30,637 --> 01:49:33,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, because he did Randy Jackson to your idols.

1405
01:49:33,499 --> 01:49:34,800
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a joke, it's a joke, Jesus.

1406
01:49:35,861 --> 01:49:38,382
[SPEAKER_18]: In about six to eight months, I went from 280 to 230.

1407
01:49:39,623 --> 01:49:41,865
[SPEAKER_18]: I play nowadays to keep in shape more than anything.

1408
01:49:42,711 --> 01:49:43,231
[SPEAKER_18]: Very interesting.

1409
01:49:44,072 --> 01:49:53,478
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR fan Melody Haman, also known as SharksGirl on this program, also shed pounds while she played going from about 220 to 143 at her lowest weight.

1410
01:49:53,858 --> 01:49:56,900
[SPEAKER_18]: I never realized that she lost that much weight playing DDR.

1411
01:49:57,901 --> 01:49:58,501
[SPEAKER_18]: I never knew that.

1412
01:49:58,621 --> 01:49:59,922
[SPEAKER_18]: SharksGirl is like one of my best buds.

1413
01:50:00,042 --> 01:50:03,304
[SPEAKER_18]: I never knew that she went from 220 to 143 from DDR.

1414
01:50:03,644 --> 01:50:05,065
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I'm a bad friend.

1415
01:50:06,006 --> 01:50:07,327
[SPEAKER_18]: She should so fire me.

1416
01:50:09,008 --> 01:50:09,608
[SPEAKER_18]: I just didn't know.

1417
01:50:10,409 --> 01:50:10,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's great.

1418
01:50:12,537 --> 01:50:15,538
[SPEAKER_18]: She says, I'm significantly lighter than when I wasn't playing, she said.

1419
01:50:15,578 --> 01:50:18,479
[SPEAKER_18]: You're not just using your hands, you're actually getting up and doing something.

1420
01:50:19,779 --> 01:50:32,763
[SPEAKER_18]: With the obesity epidemic in America reaching epic proportions, I think it would have been better if they said biblical proportions, and video games, the internet and television accused of being among the culprits, entertainment that combines physical activity with technology could be the wave of the future.

1421
01:50:33,742 --> 01:50:42,446
[SPEAKER_18]: said SportWall founder and CEO Kathy Lamberti, we have to give them the computer game packaged with their physical fitness, otherwise they're not going to be interested.

1422
01:50:42,986 --> 01:50:43,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Kids have changed.

1423
01:50:43,827 --> 01:50:47,328
[SPEAKER_18]: They've been taught how to be entertained and seduced by technology.

1424
01:50:49,189 --> 01:50:50,550
[SPEAKER_18]: Seduced by technology.

1425
01:50:53,211 --> 01:50:54,371
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR is going to seduce you.

1426
01:50:54,391 --> 01:50:56,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know.

1427
01:50:56,552 --> 01:50:58,553
[SPEAKER_14]: I get it hard on every time I pirate movies.

1428
01:51:00,974 --> 01:51:02,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Technology sure knows how to seduce me.

1429
01:51:07,644 --> 01:51:08,784
[SPEAKER_18]: Mel had another quote in here.

1430
01:51:09,705 --> 01:51:14,165
[SPEAKER_18]: There's that stigma that people who play video games are slobs who just sit on the couch.

1431
01:51:14,766 --> 01:51:16,366
[SPEAKER_18]: I always thought that was true, actually.

1432
01:51:17,966 --> 01:51:22,487
[SPEAKER_18]: In DDR, it's more of an interactive experience where you're putting yourself into the game.

1433
01:51:22,527 --> 01:51:27,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I don't know about you guys, but I got the DDR for Xbox this week.

1434
01:51:27,808 --> 01:51:30,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, not this week, but a couple weeks ago, and I've been playing on Xbox Live.

1435
01:51:30,929 --> 01:51:35,030
[SPEAKER_18]: And my fat ass has been on the couch schooling people by playing on the controller, so...

1436
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,740
[SPEAKER_18]: and I've been having lots of fun.

1437
01:51:44,202 --> 01:51:54,446
[SPEAKER_18]: To date, Konami Digital Entertainment, which distributes DDR, has sold more than 6.5 million copies worldwide and 1 million in the United States.

1438
01:51:57,106 --> 01:51:58,047
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's see.

1439
01:51:58,127 --> 01:51:59,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Jason, you notice I had a quote in here too.

1440
01:51:59,927 --> 01:52:05,249
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a game that defies all the other games out there because the person has to get up and do the work.

1441
01:52:06,869 --> 01:52:08,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Scooby Ball Scooby Ball Scooby Ball

1442
01:52:38,155 --> 01:52:41,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, why don't you share with us what's going on in the sim scene these days?

1443
01:52:41,537 --> 01:52:43,678
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there's got to be some news these past few weeks.

1444
01:52:44,018 --> 01:52:45,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Turnabix is still going, right?

1445
01:52:45,499 --> 01:52:45,839
[SPEAKER_18]: What's up?

1446
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's still going.

1447
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:48,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1448
01:52:49,441 --> 01:52:52,022
[SPEAKER_14]: The last release I got was number four.

1449
01:52:53,663 --> 01:52:55,824
[SPEAKER_14]: And I haven't seen anything since then.

1450
01:52:55,904 --> 01:52:56,965
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I've looked.

1451
01:52:57,305 --> 01:52:58,606
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just nothing.

1452
01:52:59,847 --> 01:53:03,869
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if they're still voting or what the hell's going on, but...

1453
01:53:05,287 --> 01:53:07,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there's four sections for Tourney Mix.

1454
01:53:08,869 --> 01:53:12,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Checking right now, see if there's number five.

1455
01:53:12,692 --> 01:53:14,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, just bracket four still.

1456
01:53:14,853 --> 01:53:18,115
[SPEAKER_14]: So apparently bracket four rounds up the end of Tourney Mix five.

1457
01:53:20,917 --> 01:53:21,777
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what?

1458
01:53:22,018 --> 01:53:22,858
[SPEAKER_14]: No one cares.

1459
01:53:23,098 --> 01:53:26,120
[SPEAKER_14]: There's... Wasn't that many good stuff.

1460
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:32,984
[SPEAKER_14]: To be honest, it's still like the same 5% of the songs are decent and 2% are good and the rest suck.

1461
01:53:33,485 --> 01:53:33,885
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um,

1462
01:53:34,889 --> 01:53:37,690
[SPEAKER_14]: and some other interesting stuff if you're a TourneyMix fan.

1463
01:53:38,251 --> 01:53:46,615
[SPEAKER_14]: On DDRUK's forums, they've got in the music production thread DJ Damien's V-Rare CD that he put out.

1464
01:53:46,795 --> 01:53:49,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it's a zip file of all the songs that he's made.

1465
01:53:51,097 --> 01:53:52,118
[SPEAKER_14]: They're okay.

1466
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:59,102
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got, you know, your famous Art 2 and then, you know, the Legend of Art that were featured in TourneyMix 1, 2, and 4, I think.

1467
01:53:59,122 --> 01:53:59,242
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um...

1468
01:54:03,749 --> 01:54:04,169
[SPEAKER_14]: What else?

1469
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:06,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Just some other crap that he's done.

1470
01:54:07,152 --> 01:54:10,676
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want something to download on your board, there you go.

1471
01:54:12,618 --> 01:54:15,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Aside from that, really not too much going on.

1472
01:54:15,902 --> 01:54:17,524
[SPEAKER_14]: There is some interesting stuff, though.

1473
01:54:17,624 --> 01:54:23,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I noticed that since DDRUK has their set media machine, which is DDX, or Dance...

1474
01:54:24,242 --> 01:54:26,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance something or other, I don't know, whatever.

1475
01:54:27,085 --> 01:54:35,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, it's got internet rankings, which I'm assuming is probably something that's thrown into Stepmania now.

1476
01:54:35,091 --> 01:54:38,053
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, hey, look for internet rankings, it'll be coming soon.

1477
01:54:38,594 --> 01:54:41,596
[SPEAKER_14]: As well as extended light support, people are working on that right now.

1478
01:54:42,037 --> 01:54:46,460
[SPEAKER_14]: There's talks about using serial ports, maybe USB ports for lights.

1479
01:54:46,961 --> 01:54:50,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, parallel ports are, you know, supported, so...

1480
01:54:51,559 --> 01:54:53,801
[SPEAKER_14]: There's information on DDR Maniacs for that.

1481
01:54:54,401 --> 01:54:59,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, tons more sim files for download on, um, Bomani Style and their sim file database.

1482
01:55:00,166 --> 01:55:06,691
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of them suck, though, but, hey, you know, look at the rankings on the sides, um, to get an idea what might be good and what's not.

1483
01:55:07,571 --> 01:55:10,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, aside from that, really not too much stuff going on.

1484
01:55:10,554 --> 01:55:13,836
[SPEAKER_14]: No new alphas, um, for Stepmania released.

1485
01:55:14,076 --> 01:55:16,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's just been kinda slow.

1486
01:55:18,139 --> 01:55:19,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Slow news week.

1487
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:20,241
[SPEAKER_14]: No, um,

1488
01:55:20,971 --> 01:55:30,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Service Pack 6 for Ultramix, which we did not mention, because that is news and all.

1489
01:55:32,233 --> 01:55:34,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing yet, because it has not come out yet.

1490
01:55:36,514 --> 01:55:38,334
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty much all that's going on.

1491
01:55:38,574 --> 01:55:44,215
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a nice thread, though, on DDR Maniacs' Setmania theme boards.

1492
01:55:44,475 --> 01:55:47,616
[SPEAKER_14]: They're basically how-to guides to make your skin better, which is cool.

1493
01:55:49,009 --> 01:55:53,352
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just proves that you can make a sim that looks exactly like in the group.

1494
01:55:53,493 --> 01:55:56,135
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

1495
01:55:56,155 --> 01:55:58,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyways.

1496
01:55:59,137 --> 01:55:59,898
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of agree.

1497
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:03,882
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody in the chatroom said DJ Damien's kind of crap stuff.

1498
01:56:04,462 --> 01:56:07,184
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe it's just because I'm not a cool kid, but I don't get the joke.

1499
01:56:07,345 --> 01:56:10,808
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not funny, and it's kind of stupid to me.

1500
01:56:11,348 --> 01:56:12,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I guess it's just British.

1501
01:56:13,310 --> 01:56:14,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, Spice Girls, I get that.

1502
01:56:14,951 --> 01:56:15,992
[SPEAKER_18]: DJ Damien, I don't get it.

1503
01:56:17,932 --> 01:56:18,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Jamie.

1504
01:56:20,234 --> 01:56:21,955
[SPEAKER_31]: What, about him being crappy?

1505
01:56:22,175 --> 01:56:22,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1506
01:56:24,016 --> 01:56:27,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you picked up the microphone, so I thought you were going to say something.

1507
01:56:27,138 --> 01:56:27,838
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't get it.

1508
01:56:28,279 --> 01:56:28,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1509
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:31,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you heard his stuff?

1510
01:56:32,461 --> 01:56:32,561
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1511
01:56:32,601 --> 01:56:34,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Play Jamie a little bit of one of these songs.

1512
01:56:34,563 --> 01:56:35,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Play the best one.

1513
01:56:35,043 --> 01:56:35,803
[SPEAKER_18]: The best one?

1514
01:56:37,044 --> 01:56:37,805
[SPEAKER_18]: The best one.

1515
01:56:39,766 --> 01:56:40,707
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't wait to hear this.

1516
01:56:43,949 --> 01:56:47,271
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think this should be getting any airtime on the show, but since Loki brought it up...

1517
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:55,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, sure, Ballad of Tom Jones.

1518
01:56:56,181 --> 01:56:57,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's hear a little bit of this.

1519
01:57:01,604 --> 01:57:02,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Put it in the middle somewhere.

1520
01:57:04,626 --> 01:57:08,528
[SPEAKER_07]: The two of us would surely have ended up dead.

1521
01:57:08,988 --> 01:57:12,110
[SPEAKER_07]: You thought that from killing each other.

1522
01:57:12,130 --> 01:57:12,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1523
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:13,851
[SPEAKER_27]: Tom Jones, Tom Jones.

1524
01:57:13,891 --> 01:57:17,012
[SPEAKER_27]: You'll never know, but you saved my life.

1525
01:57:17,032 --> 01:57:18,173
[SPEAKER_27]: Tom Jones, Tom Jones.

1526
01:57:35,290 --> 01:57:36,470
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh god, that's horrible.

1527
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:38,491
[SPEAKER_18]: See, I don't get it.

1528
01:57:38,511 --> 01:57:39,451
[SPEAKER_31]: Why do you think he's good?

1529
01:57:40,011 --> 01:57:42,112
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't get it.

1530
01:57:42,292 --> 01:57:42,852
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what it is?

1531
01:57:42,932 --> 01:57:44,752
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the William Hung of DDR.

1532
01:57:44,932 --> 01:57:45,933
[SPEAKER_18]: That is exactly what it is.

1533
01:57:46,913 --> 01:57:49,734
[SPEAKER_29]: But William Hung is good compared to this guy.

1534
01:57:59,376 --> 01:58:01,377
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I don't know.

1535
01:58:01,497 --> 01:58:01,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever.

1536
01:58:02,386 --> 01:58:05,929
[SPEAKER_31]: The song makes... Listening to that made me angsty and full of rage.

1537
01:58:06,129 --> 01:58:08,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, then we'll have to get into the FUs very soon after we come back.

1538
01:58:08,991 --> 01:58:15,036
[SPEAKER_18]: But... But, um, we got, um... We've got a cage match winner to announce, boys and girls.

1539
01:58:16,177 --> 01:58:17,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you're excited to hear about this.

1540
01:58:18,218 --> 01:58:23,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight's cage match winner was the one and only... This should be a big surprise to you guys.

1541
01:58:24,183 --> 01:58:28,226
[SPEAKER_30]: Loki... BT with Kimo Sari.

1542
01:58:28,246 --> 01:58:29,287
[SPEAKER_31]: That's who I would have voted for.

1543
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:33,051
[SPEAKER_18]: You wouldn't have even voted for the own song you put in?

1544
01:58:33,571 --> 01:58:33,851
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

1545
01:58:34,271 --> 01:58:34,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1546
01:58:34,571 --> 01:58:37,352
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I have come very close to using that song before.

1547
01:58:37,572 --> 01:58:39,813
[SPEAKER_31]: Well... I thought that I might have, but it was another song.

1548
01:58:39,953 --> 01:58:44,614
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm going to be gone for two weeks, I'm going to give you guys such crap songs to play in cage match while I'm gone.

1549
01:58:44,654 --> 01:58:45,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't wait.

1550
01:58:45,595 --> 01:58:46,515
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll pick them for you, Rob.

1551
01:58:46,615 --> 01:58:46,875
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1552
01:58:47,355 --> 01:58:48,836
[SPEAKER_18]: I already have them lined up.

1553
01:58:49,736 --> 01:58:51,016
[SPEAKER_18]: I already have them lined up.

1554
01:58:52,037 --> 01:58:52,997
[SPEAKER_18]: So tune in next week.

1555
01:58:53,337 --> 01:58:54,157
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be there in spirit.

1556
01:58:55,158 --> 01:58:55,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1557
01:58:56,338 --> 01:58:56,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Just...

1558
01:58:58,342 --> 01:59:01,785
[SPEAKER_18]: When we come back from this next break, boys and girls, the FUs of the week.

1559
01:59:01,925 --> 01:59:03,426
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you've got some rants in you.

1560
01:59:04,767 --> 01:59:05,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Send them.

1561
01:59:05,928 --> 01:59:06,809
[SPEAKER_18]: What'd you say, Jamie?

1562
01:59:07,449 --> 01:59:08,390
[SPEAKER_31]: I made a request.

1563
01:59:09,431 --> 01:59:09,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1564
01:59:09,911 --> 01:59:13,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I thought you said, when I said, I know you've got some rants in you, I thought you said a ton.

1565
01:59:14,715 --> 01:59:16,236
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, a ton of those, too.

1566
01:59:18,297 --> 01:59:19,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1567
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:23,862
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah, we'll get to the FUs of the week.

1568
01:59:23,882 --> 01:59:25,283
[SPEAKER_18]: So send those in over private message.

1569
01:59:27,253 --> 01:59:28,273
[SPEAKER_18]: and we'll take care of that.

1570
01:59:28,774 --> 01:59:32,375
[SPEAKER_18]: In the meantime, more poppin' music songs this break, including one Jamie wants to hear.

1571
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:33,595
[SPEAKER_18]: She always wants to hear this song.

1572
01:59:33,935 --> 01:59:34,775
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what's sad, though?

1573
01:59:35,256 --> 01:59:39,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I lost my folder of the poppin' nine consumer songs.

1574
01:59:39,137 --> 01:59:39,437
[SPEAKER_30]: Have them.

1575
01:59:39,817 --> 01:59:42,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Good, because I need to get them for you, because I don't have Don't Cry Jesus anymore.

1576
01:59:42,178 --> 01:59:42,778
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll get them when I get them.

1577
01:59:42,838 --> 01:59:43,398
[SPEAKER_18]: You can send it to me.

1578
01:59:43,638 --> 01:59:45,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Because my desktop got erased.

1579
01:59:45,459 --> 01:59:47,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Imagine if Loki's desktop got erased.

1580
01:59:47,459 --> 01:59:51,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1581
01:59:51,801 --> 01:59:52,121
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't cry.

1582
01:59:54,654 --> 01:59:59,137
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back after some more poppin' music, starting off with Gatchaman and some more stuff in here.

1583
01:59:59,378 --> 02:00:01,419
[SPEAKER_18]: And when we come back, FUs of the Week, send them now!

1584
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:07,844
Who is it?

1585
02:00:07,884 --> 02:00:08,305
Who is it?

1586
02:00:08,345 --> 02:00:08,965
Who is it?

1587
02:00:09,085 --> 02:00:15,410
[SPEAKER_05]: A shadow dancing in the distance of the sky A shadow of white wings

1588
02:00:26,589 --> 02:00:27,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1589
02:00:58,539 --> 02:01:00,942
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1590
02:01:41,663 --> 02:01:42,384
Thank you for watching!

1591
02:02:28,024 --> 02:02:28,984
Thank you for watching.

1592
02:02:29,004 --> 02:02:29,684
See you next time.

1593
02:03:17,396 --> 02:03:18,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1594
02:04:33,070 --> 02:04:35,673
Thank you for watching!

1595
02:05:37,171 --> 02:05:38,672
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, did you hear about that show?

1596
02:05:39,192 --> 02:05:39,752
[SPEAKER_23]: What show?

1597
02:05:40,052 --> 02:05:45,534
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

1598
02:05:45,934 --> 02:05:47,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I've heard of that station.

1599
02:05:47,315 --> 02:05:47,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

1600
02:05:48,055 --> 02:05:50,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

1601
02:05:50,636 --> 02:05:52,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

1602
02:05:53,117 --> 02:05:54,077
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, you die.

1603
02:05:54,697 --> 02:05:55,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I, what?

1604
02:05:56,058 --> 02:06:00,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

1605
02:06:02,478 --> 02:06:03,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1606
02:06:03,758 --> 02:06:05,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen or DIE!

1607
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:12,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1608
02:06:12,460 --> 02:06:14,760
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week very shortly.

1609
02:06:17,841 --> 02:06:20,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Gosh, I'm not sure what else is going on in the money world right now.

1610
02:06:21,401 --> 02:06:23,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, you seem to be more on top of things than I am.

1611
02:06:24,962 --> 02:06:26,022
[SPEAKER_17]: What are you checking out there?

1612
02:06:26,962 --> 02:06:29,363
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, like I was saying earlier, their...

1613
02:06:30,592 --> 02:06:46,418
[SPEAKER_14]: DDRUK's DanceDX, and they're on their version 2 now, and I'm going to, in just one second here, link the chatroom to their gallery for this, which it's actually, it's a very well put together set menu machine, I might add.

1614
02:06:46,838 --> 02:06:54,601
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a lot of people working on it, and it's the way I wish Golfland would work, where you have more than one person working on it.

1615
02:06:55,404 --> 02:06:57,445
[SPEAKER_18]: What exactly is going on with that thing?

1616
02:06:57,685 --> 02:07:01,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Even our chatroom's curious, because it's been three weeks since we really had an update, and I know there's kind of some stuff going on.

1617
02:07:01,786 --> 02:07:06,187
[SPEAKER_18]: What exactly happened with that EX2 project you've been really heavily involved with?

1618
02:07:07,387 --> 02:07:08,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Keith broke the motherboard.

1619
02:07:09,048 --> 02:07:10,588
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much what it comes down to.

1620
02:07:11,249 --> 02:07:18,751
[SPEAKER_14]: And no, I'm not going to go buy a new motherboard, because as it was, I put more time and effort into it than was needed.

1621
02:07:18,771 --> 02:07:21,872
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what it sounds like he wants me to do, is get a new motherboard for it.

1622
02:07:21,892 --> 02:07:22,892
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, no, so...

1623
02:07:23,821 --> 02:07:24,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever happens, happens.

1624
02:07:25,262 --> 02:07:27,563
[SPEAKER_14]: They got their money out of it, I got my money out of it.

1625
02:07:28,444 --> 02:07:30,085
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no one's at a real loss.

1626
02:07:31,665 --> 02:07:45,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks for them because they rewired their whole cabinet, but you know... Someday I guess we can put a new motherboard in it, but I really... It's just a pain in the ass the way it was set up and things don't work that should work.

1627
02:07:46,714 --> 02:07:49,455
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just really annoying and real frustrating.

1628
02:07:49,475 --> 02:07:49,535
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

1629
02:07:51,711 --> 02:07:56,633
[SPEAKER_14]: I learned from it, and hopefully my next project won't be as bad.

1630
02:07:58,833 --> 02:08:00,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Any chance you'll do a cabinet for a different arcade?

1631
02:08:02,394 --> 02:08:03,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that's what the other project is.

1632
02:08:04,635 --> 02:08:10,036
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a cabinet for another arcade, it's a plug-and-play upgrade for any arcade.

1633
02:08:10,557 --> 02:08:11,977
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'm looking into right now.

1634
02:08:12,157 --> 02:08:18,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, taking all the stuff I've learned from this, and we'll apply it to any arcade, because guess what I found out?

1635
02:08:19,341 --> 02:08:22,143
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't need to license Statmania from them.

1636
02:08:22,363 --> 02:08:24,744
[SPEAKER_14]: It's free to sell, do whatever you want with it.

1637
02:08:25,505 --> 02:08:31,528
[SPEAKER_14]: As long as you keep the development team's credit in there, which that's already hard programmed into it.

1638
02:08:32,169 --> 02:08:40,814
[SPEAKER_14]: So, technically, yeah, I could go out there, make an upgrade for an arcade, and sell it, and make money off it.

1639
02:08:42,655 --> 02:08:45,597
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm looking into it.

1640
02:08:46,707 --> 02:08:48,989
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I wonder how many people are going to steal your idea right there.

1641
02:08:49,229 --> 02:08:49,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Huh?

1642
02:08:49,649 --> 02:08:50,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Check your legal channels.

1643
02:08:50,770 --> 02:08:50,991
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1644
02:08:51,671 --> 02:08:52,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Just cover your butt.

1645
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:55,935
[SPEAKER_18]: But I figure if they can get away with that Megamix thing.

1646
02:08:56,555 --> 02:08:57,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's what it is.

1647
02:08:57,616 --> 02:09:04,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have to check any legal channels because all I'm doing is providing the hardware and the program to run it.

1648
02:09:04,822 --> 02:09:05,983
[SPEAKER_14]: They made the program.

1649
02:09:06,203 --> 02:09:07,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I made the hardware.

1650
02:09:07,604 --> 02:09:09,145
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing I can get in trouble for.

1651
02:09:09,165 --> 02:09:11,247
[SPEAKER_31]: What do you mean?

1652
02:09:11,347 --> 02:09:12,088
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the program.

1653
02:09:13,229 --> 02:09:14,169
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all Stepmania.

1654
02:09:14,189 --> 02:09:15,270
[SPEAKER_14]: That's their licensing.

1655
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:16,171
[SPEAKER_14]: That's their problem.

1656
02:09:16,579 --> 02:09:18,660
[SPEAKER_14]: All I'm doing is making the hardware setup for it.

1657
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:21,622
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no way I can get in trouble for building a PC.

1658
02:09:22,162 --> 02:09:27,585
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, you know, they can try, but, you know, it's not going to work.

1659
02:09:28,005 --> 02:09:29,726
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's if I were to do it.

1660
02:09:31,046 --> 02:09:33,728
[SPEAKER_18]: And if the coppers ever come after me, Loki did it!

1661
02:09:33,988 --> 02:09:34,928
[SPEAKER_18]: He had the gun!

1662
02:09:35,349 --> 02:09:38,290
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Loki with a revolver in the conservatory.

1663
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:39,751
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw it with my own eyes.

1664
02:09:42,292 --> 02:09:43,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get on with the FUs of the week, shall we?

1665
02:09:45,037 --> 02:09:47,478
[SPEAKER_18]: What do we do during the FUs of the week, Miss Jamie?

1666
02:09:47,718 --> 02:10:03,944
[SPEAKER_27]: We bitch and moon.

1667
02:10:04,784 --> 02:10:06,344
[SPEAKER_30]: I really miss that music.

1668
02:10:06,845 --> 02:10:08,605
[SPEAKER_30]: Really, really miss that.

1669
02:10:08,685 --> 02:10:09,886
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm going to keep it for a while.

1670
02:10:11,606 --> 02:10:14,007
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway, my first FU of the week goes towards

1671
02:10:14,622 --> 02:10:20,348
[SPEAKER_31]: People who go 15 miles under the speed limit, when I'm wanting to go 10 over it.

1672
02:10:21,889 --> 02:10:24,031
[SPEAKER_31]: Damn them.

1673
02:10:25,693 --> 02:10:34,982
[SPEAKER_31]: Also, it goes to the Safeway over on Madison, like, on the way here, for not carrying IM's cat food.

1674
02:10:35,836 --> 02:10:36,997
[SPEAKER_31]: which is what I feed Shermie.

1675
02:10:38,538 --> 02:10:42,361
[SPEAKER_31]: A big F you goes to cat food in general to having their first product be wheat.

1676
02:10:42,901 --> 02:10:44,462
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, what cat?

1677
02:10:45,683 --> 02:10:49,106
[SPEAKER_31]: Have you ever seen a stray cat go up and want wheat?

1678
02:10:50,207 --> 02:10:54,150
[SPEAKER_31]: No, they're going to go after the open can of tuna that's sitting around by the trash can.

1679
02:10:54,990 --> 02:10:56,712
[SPEAKER_31]: They're going to go kill a bird or a squirrel.

1680
02:10:57,732 --> 02:10:59,794
[SPEAKER_31]: Rob, have you ever known of any cats that go after wheat?

1681
02:11:01,035 --> 02:11:01,735
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't say I have.

1682
02:11:02,035 --> 02:11:03,537
[SPEAKER_31]: Have you ever met a vegetarian cat?

1683
02:11:03,957 --> 02:11:04,677
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't say I have.

1684
02:11:04,838 --> 02:11:05,278
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay then.

1685
02:11:08,049 --> 02:11:14,412
[SPEAKER_31]: and Jeremy got really, really fat when I was feeding her the other kind of cat food that had meat.

1686
02:11:14,892 --> 02:11:19,074
[SPEAKER_31]: And then I switched her over to cat food that had meat as the first product.

1687
02:11:19,494 --> 02:11:21,775
[SPEAKER_31]: And lo and behold, she lost weight.

1688
02:11:21,855 --> 02:11:26,777
[SPEAKER_31]: And by the way, cats eat grass because they can puke it back up and get stuff out of their system.

1689
02:11:27,617 --> 02:11:29,238
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, that's why cats eat grass.

1690
02:11:29,458 --> 02:11:29,838
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1691
02:11:30,518 --> 02:11:32,459
[SPEAKER_31]: And I kid you not, watch a cat.

1692
02:11:32,659 --> 02:11:35,261
[SPEAKER_31]: They eat grass, then they hack it all back up.

1693
02:11:37,382 --> 02:11:38,862
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, any animal will do that.

1694
02:11:39,223 --> 02:11:40,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go eat grass and throw it up.

1695
02:11:41,204 --> 02:11:41,364
[SPEAKER_31]: Ew.

1696
02:11:42,564 --> 02:11:44,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go make mud pies, Jamie.

1697
02:11:44,725 --> 02:11:47,547
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, okay.

1698
02:11:50,188 --> 02:11:54,510
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway, another F you goes toward a lack of money.

1699
02:11:55,552 --> 02:12:20,261
[SPEAKER_31]: a lack of time, a big F you goes to distance, um, also, um, an F you goes towards stupid people, and I don't mean people who just don't understand, you know, people who, well, there's a, there's types of stupidity, the stupidity I'm referring to is lack of common sense, okay,

1700
02:12:20,916 --> 02:12:29,358
[SPEAKER_31]: For the people who should not be involved in any part of the gene pool, these are the people that I would like removed from my universe.

1701
02:12:32,299 --> 02:12:40,461
[SPEAKER_31]: Another F you goes toward myself for having all of these ideas for writing and just not being able to get them out of my head.

1702
02:12:40,661 --> 02:12:42,922
[SPEAKER_31]: I hate writer's block with an unholy passion.

1703
02:12:43,562 --> 02:12:44,642
[SPEAKER_31]: It's been driving me nuts.

1704
02:12:45,502 --> 02:12:48,523
[SPEAKER_31]: So an F you to writer's block.

1705
02:12:49,122 --> 02:12:51,303
[SPEAKER_31]: and Artist's Block, although I have started drawing again.

1706
02:12:51,644 --> 02:12:55,166
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm doing a commission drawing right now.

1707
02:12:57,007 --> 02:12:59,789
[SPEAKER_31]: Another FU goes toward my college.

1708
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:02,871
[SPEAKER_31]: But, okay, this is what I don't get.

1709
02:13:03,091 --> 02:13:05,032
[SPEAKER_31]: And this may be a little bit technical for some people.

1710
02:13:06,153 --> 02:13:16,259
[SPEAKER_31]: When you take out a student loan, if you're going for federal loans and you have to fill out your FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, so that your school will know how much...

1711
02:13:17,074 --> 02:13:20,136
[SPEAKER_31]: Your family makes, or through an incentive, how much you make.

1712
02:13:20,596 --> 02:13:27,019
[SPEAKER_31]: So I can understand that since they're doing a federal loan, they need to see how much you are going to be eligible for.

1713
02:13:27,579 --> 02:13:32,301
[SPEAKER_31]: But why on earth do I need to fill out a FAFSA for a private loan?

1714
02:13:33,282 --> 02:13:36,143
[SPEAKER_31]: I sort of see the reason behind it.

1715
02:13:36,203 --> 02:13:37,844
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just a big pain in the ass right now.

1716
02:13:38,504 --> 02:13:39,965
[SPEAKER_31]: So I've got to go out and...

1717
02:13:40,782 --> 02:13:48,627
[SPEAKER_31]: I've done my FAFSA already, I just have to wait on the school to get my student aid report so I can get my award letter, so I can apply for the loan, so I can get my laptop.

1718
02:13:49,327 --> 02:13:54,831
[SPEAKER_31]: I need a laptop because I'm going into database management.

1719
02:13:54,891 --> 02:14:01,074
[SPEAKER_31]: And another FU goes toward being really homesick lately.

1720
02:14:01,575 --> 02:14:08,539
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to go back home for a little while and not have the money to do it in a little while.

1721
02:14:11,070 --> 02:14:15,673
[SPEAKER_30]: and the rest of you guys for just being the busy time of year at work.

1722
02:14:16,153 --> 02:14:16,914
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's about it.

1723
02:14:17,794 --> 02:14:20,356
[SPEAKER_30]: But yeah, I'm really hungry.

1724
02:14:20,836 --> 02:14:20,976
[SPEAKER_23]: Aw.

1725
02:14:22,077 --> 02:14:22,617
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright then.

1726
02:14:23,317 --> 02:14:23,818
[SPEAKER_23]: Moving on.

1727
02:14:24,118 --> 02:14:25,279
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, your turn.

1728
02:14:25,539 --> 02:14:26,900
[SPEAKER_23]: What's pissing you off this week?

1729
02:14:28,501 --> 02:14:30,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot about this song.

1730
02:14:31,883 --> 02:14:32,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Um.

1731
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:34,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one.

1732
02:14:35,385 --> 02:14:37,146
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really know.

1733
02:14:37,186 --> 02:14:38,987
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, it's been so long.

1734
02:14:39,951 --> 02:14:43,814
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, of course, fuck you to the safe and sane fireworks.

1735
02:14:44,214 --> 02:14:53,100
[SPEAKER_14]: They're really lame, and when you have a firework that lasts shorter, you know, the match lighting lasts longer than the actual firework.

1736
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:57,142
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had orgasms that lasted longer than some of those fireworks, seriously.

1737
02:14:58,423 --> 02:15:00,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's just like really pathetic.

1738
02:15:00,525 --> 02:15:05,608
[SPEAKER_14]: You're like, wow, you know, lighting a candle would have been more exciting than those fireworks.

1739
02:15:06,311 --> 02:15:11,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So, that really sucks, but luckily we know how to get our money out of safe and sane fireworks.

1740
02:15:11,035 --> 02:15:12,836
[SPEAKER_14]: That's burning the packaging that they come in.

1741
02:15:14,937 --> 02:15:16,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So, hooray.

1742
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:21,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two goes to the heat.

1743
02:15:22,223 --> 02:15:22,984
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like it.

1744
02:15:23,344 --> 02:15:26,846
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been pretty hot.

1745
02:15:27,147 --> 02:15:28,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I like it being nice and cool out.

1746
02:15:29,168 --> 02:15:31,510
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, comfy Bay Area weather.

1747
02:15:32,250 --> 02:15:33,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't like this dry heat.

1748
02:15:33,851 --> 02:15:34,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks.

1749
02:15:34,872 --> 02:15:41,237
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, also, um... Just be glad that this is in the South where it's very humid.

1750
02:15:41,457 --> 02:15:50,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, of course, you know, after seeing Fahrenheit 9-11 again, and, uh, fuck Bush just because, you know, he's stupid.

1751
02:15:51,565 --> 02:15:57,369
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um... Really, I'm not that pissed off at stuff that much.

1752
02:15:57,905 --> 02:16:00,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you, the retarded people on Final Fantasy XI.

1753
02:16:00,448 --> 02:16:02,210
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's some really dumb people out there.

1754
02:16:02,290 --> 02:16:03,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess pretty much everyone.

1755
02:16:04,192 --> 02:16:06,014
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of dumb people everywhere.

1756
02:16:06,914 --> 02:16:08,876
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hate dumb people and when you would kill them.

1757
02:16:09,797 --> 02:16:13,661
[SPEAKER_14]: And fuck you, the goddamn DVR EX2 thing being broken again.

1758
02:16:13,701 --> 02:16:16,184
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, I can't fix that machine enough.

1759
02:16:16,685 --> 02:16:20,889
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I have to be at the point to where I say, you know, fuck it, I don't care.

1760
02:16:21,303 --> 02:16:31,272
[SPEAKER_14]: and once again, fuck you to Keith because that promise he made that I would get to dismantle the Beat Mania machine and take some of the parts for it because they were going to get rid of it anyways, well, he did it without me and threw the machine away.

1761
02:16:31,492 --> 02:16:32,152
[SPEAKER_14]: So, fuck him.

1762
02:16:34,494 --> 02:16:37,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um... Yeah, that's really all I have.

1763
02:16:38,218 --> 02:16:39,078
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just done.

1764
02:16:39,759 --> 02:16:44,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just... I don't know what the hell my PC, like, instantly restarted today.

1765
02:16:44,523 --> 02:16:50,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, when Ranma was going to log out of Final Fantasy, just the whole PC restarted, so now I have to figure out what's wrong with that.

1766
02:16:50,767 --> 02:16:52,668
[SPEAKER_14]: So all I did today was open the case up.

1767
02:16:52,788 --> 02:16:59,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I touched nothing inside, opened the case up because I noticed there was a lot of dust on the outside, and I wanted to see how much it, you know, collected on the inside.

1768
02:16:59,792 --> 02:17:04,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Opened it up, looked inside, closed case, done, and it goes and gets all fucked up, so...

1769
02:17:06,255 --> 02:17:09,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and fuck you the cool web search for hijacking Internet Explorer.

1770
02:17:10,977 --> 02:17:14,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Internet Explorer is completely useless for a while, so you know what?

1771
02:17:14,698 --> 02:17:16,178
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I'm using Firefox now.

1772
02:17:16,298 --> 02:17:17,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you, Microsoft.

1773
02:17:18,659 --> 02:17:19,159
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm done.

1774
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:23,260
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you have something you wanted to add, Jamie?

1775
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:23,481
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry.

1776
02:17:23,641 --> 02:17:25,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something in mind, too.

1777
02:17:26,221 --> 02:17:26,561
[SPEAKER_23]: Ugh.

1778
02:17:27,602 --> 02:17:28,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Spammers can go to hell.

1779
02:17:30,903 --> 02:17:31,183
[SPEAKER_18]: My turn.

1780
02:17:33,804 --> 02:17:36,065
[SPEAKER_18]: An F you to having the hiccups for two weeks.

1781
02:17:36,386 --> 02:17:37,366
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it wasn't that one.

1782
02:17:37,386 --> 02:17:37,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Three days.

1783
02:17:40,708 --> 02:17:42,088
[SPEAKER_18]: And that really sucked.

1784
02:17:42,909 --> 02:17:46,671
[SPEAKER_18]: And an F you to my work wanting to send me away for two weeks.

1785
02:17:48,852 --> 02:17:52,154
[SPEAKER_18]: My work wants to send me away for two weeks and thusly I'm going to miss all this cool stuff that was going on.

1786
02:17:52,454 --> 02:17:55,375
[SPEAKER_18]: My friend that's in Iraq right now is going to be home and I'm going to be gone.

1787
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,977
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to get tickets.

1788
02:17:58,837 --> 02:18:00,478
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, back it up.

1789
02:18:00,518 --> 02:18:02,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Shark Skrull was going to treat me to an Atlantis concert.

1790
02:18:03,283 --> 02:18:05,264
[SPEAKER_18]: and I don't get to go to that now because I'm not going to be here.

1791
02:18:06,465 --> 02:18:09,566
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go.

1792
02:18:10,106 --> 02:18:12,047
[SPEAKER_18]: And, yeah, so, sad.

1793
02:18:12,507 --> 02:18:13,128
[SPEAKER_18]: What else was I going to miss?

1794
02:18:13,148 --> 02:18:14,888
[SPEAKER_18]: There was something else big I'm missing, I forget.

1795
02:18:15,028 --> 02:18:17,670
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm missing this show twice in a row, but, you know, you got to do what you got to do.

1796
02:18:19,770 --> 02:18:23,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Real life sucks sometimes.

1797
02:18:23,732 --> 02:18:30,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Also an F you to Golfland and Scandia together for helping make Sacramento Arcades a big fat joke.

1798
02:18:31,196 --> 02:18:31,896
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate living here.

1799
02:18:33,194 --> 02:18:35,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, no, I really like living here, but as a gamer, it's pathetic.

1800
02:18:36,275 --> 02:18:36,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Honestly.

1801
02:18:36,696 --> 02:18:38,637
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no arcades in Sacramento.

1802
02:18:38,797 --> 02:18:38,997
[SPEAKER_18]: None.

1803
02:18:40,598 --> 02:18:41,398
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss the game room.

1804
02:18:41,498 --> 02:18:42,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss it so much.

1805
02:18:42,278 --> 02:18:43,439
[SPEAKER_18]: You know why I miss the game room?

1806
02:18:43,899 --> 02:18:46,240
[SPEAKER_18]: Because they didn't have ticket machines at the game room.

1807
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:47,481
[SPEAKER_18]: That is why I miss them.

1808
02:18:48,441 --> 02:18:50,002
[SPEAKER_31]: They were all about fighting games.

1809
02:18:51,917 --> 02:18:55,060
[SPEAKER_18]: I would rather have the fighting game crowd than the birthday crowd, enough said.

1810
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:56,081
[SPEAKER_30]: And they had victory.

1811
02:18:57,202 --> 02:18:57,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, they did.

1812
02:18:57,622 --> 02:18:59,184
[SPEAKER_18]: And they had pinball games too, which made me happy.

1813
02:18:59,844 --> 02:19:00,985
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, I can't stand it.

1814
02:19:01,346 --> 02:19:01,806
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had it.

1815
02:19:01,906 --> 02:19:02,627
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had my limit.

1816
02:19:02,967 --> 02:19:06,731
[SPEAKER_18]: I've reached my limit of putting up with kids and teenagers.

1817
02:19:07,131 --> 02:19:09,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking, like, 15, 16 year olds.

1818
02:19:09,754 --> 02:19:12,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I know a lot of 15, 16 year olds listen to this program.

1819
02:19:12,916 --> 02:19:17,621
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm not, I'm not trying to be generalizing, but I'm talking about those kids that probably pick on you at school.

1820
02:19:18,041 --> 02:19:20,565
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, those guys hang out at the arcade, too.

1821
02:19:21,025 --> 02:19:22,988
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're such asses.

1822
02:19:23,288 --> 02:19:25,051
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, my God.

1823
02:19:25,311 --> 02:19:28,515
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you to their parents for making them.

1824
02:19:29,637 --> 02:19:31,359
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish you would have aborted those childs.

1825
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:34,111
[SPEAKER_30]: Rob, do what I do.

1826
02:19:34,651 --> 02:19:35,511
[SPEAKER_30]: Have them thrown out.

1827
02:19:35,691 --> 02:19:42,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Keith would be able to, you know, fix the problems at Golf Land if it weren't for the kids, like, ripping shit off the games.

1828
02:19:42,654 --> 02:19:45,475
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, before it used to be ripping keys off the keyboard mania.

1829
02:19:45,515 --> 02:19:46,316
[SPEAKER_14]: And changing diapers.

1830
02:19:46,696 --> 02:19:47,956
[SPEAKER_14]: And changing diapers on them.

1831
02:19:48,396 --> 02:19:50,837
[SPEAKER_14]: And now it's ripping the cymbals off the drums.

1832
02:19:51,878 --> 02:19:53,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Or just chunks of the cymbals.

1833
02:19:53,819 --> 02:19:57,280
[SPEAKER_14]: But Golf Land's defense, they did add a subway, and that makes me happy.

1834
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:01,961
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't fucking go there to eat Subway.

1835
02:20:02,242 --> 02:20:06,785
[SPEAKER_18]: I go there to play DDR, not be harassed and get shit thrown at me.

1836
02:20:08,846 --> 02:20:10,367
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no arcades in this town anymore.

1837
02:20:10,387 --> 02:20:12,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Until I open my dream arcade.

1838
02:20:13,129 --> 02:20:17,432
[SPEAKER_31]: If I feel like just going somewhere to be a bitch, I'll just go to Golf Land and have people thrown out.

1839
02:20:17,452 --> 02:20:19,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, maybe we should just go there regularly and have people thrown out regularly.

1840
02:20:19,994 --> 02:20:21,075
[SPEAKER_31]: That makes me feel better.

1841
02:20:21,135 --> 02:20:23,096
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we should do it.

1842
02:20:24,057 --> 02:20:25,818
[SPEAKER_18]: We could have like a squad name or something.

1843
02:20:27,492 --> 02:20:28,412
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, let's move on.

1844
02:20:28,452 --> 02:20:30,633
[SPEAKER_31]: The Arcade Protection Agency.

1845
02:20:31,813 --> 02:20:32,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Got a small story about that.

1846
02:20:33,474 --> 02:20:34,634
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really small.

1847
02:20:34,855 --> 02:20:42,137
[SPEAKER_14]: There was, you know, our friend, Mr. Pirate Power, you know, that's in, I don't know, Toadie, I guess.

1848
02:20:43,237 --> 02:20:45,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to get him on the show sometime because he's actually pretty funny.

1849
02:20:45,638 --> 02:20:48,459
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he'd be pretty good for a guest on the show, but anyway.

1850
02:20:49,119 --> 02:20:56,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, so he was down at Golf Land with Prestige and stuff there and some stupid kid came up and was acting like an ass and they scared him and he ran out.

1851
02:20:56,382 --> 02:20:56,862
[SPEAKER_14]: That was funny.

1852
02:20:59,383 --> 02:21:00,363
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought there was more to the story.

1853
02:21:00,384 --> 02:21:03,845
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought you would have like how he was thrown out or what was said.

1854
02:21:06,206 --> 02:21:09,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Puppy's volunteering to sign up for the Arcade Ejection Squad.

1855
02:21:12,589 --> 02:21:13,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, moving on.

1856
02:21:14,770 --> 02:21:17,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, AES, the Arcade Ejection Squad.

1857
02:21:17,832 --> 02:21:18,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck up, you outta here!

1858
02:21:19,993 --> 02:21:21,674
[SPEAKER_31]: We should totally start a website.

1859
02:21:28,874 --> 02:21:29,735
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm loving this idea.

1860
02:21:30,736 --> 02:21:33,579
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to single-handedly save this arcade scene in this town.

1861
02:21:33,599 --> 02:21:34,379
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, moving on.

1862
02:21:34,619 --> 02:21:38,103
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, we did once by putting all these pictures of the broken machines on.

1863
02:21:38,623 --> 02:21:39,364
[SPEAKER_31]: That's very true.

1864
02:21:39,384 --> 02:21:40,925
[SPEAKER_18]: We ought to do that again.

1865
02:21:41,206 --> 02:21:41,906
[SPEAKER_18]: We ought to do that again.

1866
02:21:42,587 --> 02:21:45,370
[SPEAKER_18]: But this time we should send them, like, the media and stuff.

1867
02:21:46,871 --> 02:21:49,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, let's go to the chat room, FUs, shall we?

1868
02:21:51,688 --> 02:22:01,031
[SPEAKER_18]: VxJasonXV says, one simple FU, FU to having a job and not yet actually working, thus not having income.

1869
02:22:02,872 --> 02:22:05,033
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Angel says, only one FU this week.

1870
02:22:05,573 --> 02:22:11,115
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to say FU to one of my coworkers who thinks that he should control my schedule at work when he doesn't even have the authority to touch it.

1871
02:22:11,615 --> 02:22:13,676
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm scheduled until 10, leave it at 10.

1872
02:22:14,076 --> 02:22:17,057
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't stay a half hour even if you wanted me to, so get over it.

1873
02:22:17,397 --> 02:22:19,178
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I'll be out of that hellhole soon.

1874
02:22:19,258 --> 02:22:19,778
[SPEAKER_18]: That is all.

1875
02:22:19,858 --> 02:22:20,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Goodbye.

1876
02:22:21,121 --> 02:22:22,402
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, she's moving up here pretty soon.

1877
02:22:22,422 --> 02:22:22,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1878
02:22:23,382 --> 02:22:25,923
[SPEAKER_18]: She'll get out of the place she's in.

1879
02:22:26,984 --> 02:22:29,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we'll hear more local FUs, anyway.

1880
02:22:30,785 --> 02:22:39,729
[SPEAKER_18]: SharksGirl says, great, she says, FU to your work, my work, FU to Sky's work for making you go away so you miss our date.

1881
02:22:40,450 --> 02:22:41,790
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't be able to put out for her.

1882
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:46,632
[SPEAKER_18]: I promised I would put out because she bought the tickets and everything, so.

1883
02:22:46,732 --> 02:22:50,374
[SPEAKER_18]: She says she figures if nothing else, Mel's her default, but he just wouldn't appreciate it.

1884
02:22:51,943 --> 02:22:54,685
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure Mel would accept the putting out, though, huh?

1885
02:22:54,765 --> 02:22:55,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's raising her hand.

1886
02:22:55,746 --> 02:22:57,067
[SPEAKER_18]: You should talk to Jamie.

1887
02:22:59,449 --> 02:23:00,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't count me out yet, though.

1888
02:23:00,650 --> 02:23:03,372
[SPEAKER_18]: The way my work works, I'll be... Just you wait.

1889
02:23:03,592 --> 02:23:04,853
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't be gone until September.

1890
02:23:06,514 --> 02:23:07,815
[SPEAKER_18]: Locke has two FUs.

1891
02:23:08,555 --> 02:23:09,916
[SPEAKER_18]: One is a couple weeks old, and then the new one.

1892
02:23:10,377 --> 02:23:13,499
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one is this girl named Lauren, who I thought everything was going well with.

1893
02:23:13,539 --> 02:23:18,943
[SPEAKER_18]: After dating for a month, I got told that she was dating someone else by her best friend, and she wasn't going to even tell me.

1894
02:23:20,404 --> 02:23:21,025
[SPEAKER_18]: So F you there.

1895
02:23:21,045 --> 02:23:21,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

1896
02:23:22,446 --> 02:23:23,287
[SPEAKER_18]: High school drama.

1897
02:23:24,788 --> 02:23:26,109
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even think he's in high school, though.

1898
02:23:26,129 --> 02:23:27,009
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he's older than that.

1899
02:23:27,569 --> 02:23:28,030
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1900
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:28,350
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1901
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:29,491
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know the age of all our listeners.

1902
02:23:29,591 --> 02:23:31,612
[SPEAKER_30]: It's drama.

1903
02:23:32,553 --> 02:23:34,654
[SPEAKER_18]: We're in the old demographic here in studio.

1904
02:23:34,694 --> 02:23:35,995
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the interesting part.

1905
02:23:36,556 --> 02:23:41,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Locke also says, F you to people who cannot discuss politics without getting pissed off.

1906
02:23:42,439 --> 02:23:48,924
[SPEAKER_18]: And also those who believe that you are not allowed to have an opinion yourself and unless you agree with them completely in politics, that they won't talk to you.

1907
02:23:51,441 --> 02:23:53,142
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

1908
02:23:53,162 --> 02:24:00,065
[SPEAKER_31]: Anything that anyone has a strong opinion about, they get all close-minded about.

1909
02:24:01,105 --> 02:24:03,226
[SPEAKER_31]: Everyone has a right to an opinion, you know.

1910
02:24:08,271 --> 02:24:13,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Flerone says, F you Dr. Atkins, if I hear low carb or Atkins friendly, I swear I will break my TV.

1911
02:24:13,953 --> 02:24:21,016
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I bet half the people on Atkins who haven't read the books don't know that carb is short for carbohydrate or that fruits have them.

1912
02:24:22,136 --> 02:24:25,597
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, I doubt many know that all the fucking heart problems Atkins had when he died.

1913
02:24:27,178 --> 02:24:31,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, that was debatable because they said he also died from falling or something.

1914
02:24:31,259 --> 02:24:33,480
[SPEAKER_31]: No, the Atkins diet gives you gout.

1915
02:24:34,659 --> 02:24:36,240
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought you were going to say gas.

1916
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:37,180
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it gives you gas.

1917
02:24:37,220 --> 02:24:39,101
[SPEAKER_18]: But eating all that meat would give you a lot of gas.

1918
02:24:39,161 --> 02:24:46,284
[SPEAKER_31]: It also gives you bad breath and affects your hormones and will eventually give you cancer.

1919
02:24:46,324 --> 02:24:48,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, I have the miracle diet for you guys.

1920
02:24:48,725 --> 02:24:50,306
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to call it the Venata diet.

1921
02:24:50,726 --> 02:24:52,427
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to put this on all the packaging.

1922
02:24:52,707 --> 02:24:56,469
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to put this on all these packages, the Venata diet friendly thing.

1923
02:24:58,130 --> 02:25:01,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Eat less, exercise more.

1924
02:25:01,911 --> 02:25:02,472
[SPEAKER_29]: God.

1925
02:25:07,096 --> 02:25:07,957
[SPEAKER_31]: It's worked for me.

1926
02:25:07,977 --> 02:25:09,397
[SPEAKER_18]: It's hard work.

1927
02:25:10,458 --> 02:25:12,419
[SPEAKER_18]: John Fields says, F you to my father.

1928
02:25:13,379 --> 02:25:18,081
[SPEAKER_18]: And just so you know, when I say eat less, that doesn't mean you do the Mary-Kate Olsen thing and not eat at all.

1929
02:25:18,481 --> 02:25:19,882
[SPEAKER_18]: You just eat less.

1930
02:25:20,542 --> 02:25:23,824
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're eating a whole pie, eat half the pie.

1931
02:25:25,625 --> 02:25:28,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of not eating, do crack, just like the Olsen twins.

1932
02:25:29,046 --> 02:25:32,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's step two in Matt's great plan to get them naked.

1933
02:25:33,775 --> 02:25:38,657
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it is, it is what you eat as much as how much of it you eat.

1934
02:25:39,398 --> 02:25:42,299
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, just don't eat processed food.

1935
02:25:42,859 --> 02:25:49,962
[SPEAKER_31]: Go cook a meal, you know, get some, some, you know, steak, cook it on your Foreman Grill.

1936
02:25:50,623 --> 02:25:52,604
[SPEAKER_31]: Foreman Grill's awesome, you know.

1937
02:25:53,644 --> 02:25:57,606
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a matter of just eating real food.

1938
02:25:58,846 --> 02:26:00,067
[SPEAKER_31]: Look, I guarantee you.

1939
02:26:01,556 --> 02:26:10,118
[SPEAKER_31]: I challenge everybody, okay, for one week, you know, go grocery shopping and try and don't buy anything that has high-fructose corn syrup in it.

1940
02:26:10,858 --> 02:26:11,599
[SPEAKER_31]: Try doing it for a week.

1941
02:26:12,039 --> 02:26:19,641
[SPEAKER_31]: I guarantee you, everything that you normally get, or most of everything that you get, has that as either a primary or at least a middle ingredient on it.

1942
02:26:22,341 --> 02:26:22,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'm done.

1943
02:26:23,142 --> 02:26:23,502
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all right.

1944
02:26:23,702 --> 02:26:24,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Back to John Peel's FU.

1945
02:26:24,582 --> 02:26:24,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1946
02:26:25,575 --> 02:26:31,178
[SPEAKER_18]: FU to my father, fuck having to get a job, fuck having to pay $500 for a tiny scratch on a bumper that happened in an accident.

1947
02:26:31,218 --> 02:26:33,339
[SPEAKER_18]: My life worth is now down to only $1,000.

1948
02:26:33,379 --> 02:26:37,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, that's more than I've got today.

1949
02:26:38,401 --> 02:26:38,882
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

1950
02:26:40,002 --> 02:26:47,406
[SPEAKER_18]: EvilMaliki2DX says, FU goes to idiot tourists on July 4th who thought that standing and blocking my view was going to give them a better view of the fireworks.

1951
02:26:48,035 --> 02:26:51,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and F you to Fog for blocking out the fireworks in the first place.

1952
02:26:51,798 --> 02:26:55,381
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you to idiot drivers trying to run me over on my way back to the BART station.

1953
02:26:55,981 --> 02:26:58,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and F you to the idiot drunk driver that took Satoshi's life.

1954
02:27:04,328 --> 02:27:11,951
[SPEAKER_18]: Spaceboy says, neighbor kids suck, they touch your drums, then you tell them not to, and then tell their soccer mom.

1955
02:27:12,211 --> 02:27:14,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Then they come back and taunt you, then they get you in trouble.

1956
02:27:15,453 --> 02:27:18,574
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to throw them off my house headfirst.

1957
02:27:21,816 --> 02:27:27,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Misty says, this one goes to myself, because I lost my wallet and all the important shit that I was stupid enough to keep in there.

1958
02:27:28,763 --> 02:27:31,686
[SPEAKER_18]: I only hope I can find it in the landfill that is my room.

1959
02:27:32,326 --> 02:27:33,607
[SPEAKER_18]: I like how she calls it in the landfill.

1960
02:27:34,128 --> 02:27:38,131
[SPEAKER_18]: And lastly, Mel B of RTF has an FU.

1961
02:27:38,712 --> 02:27:42,055
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, FU to Richard Earl Sevitz.

1962
02:27:42,655 --> 02:27:46,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks a whole freaking lot for taking the lives of a local DDR and his mom.

1963
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:48,801
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure drinking before taking the wheel was worth it.

1964
02:27:49,361 --> 02:27:50,062
[SPEAKER_18]: You worthless fuck.

1965
02:27:52,554 --> 02:27:53,555
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1966
02:28:22,796 --> 02:28:25,098
[SPEAKER_18]: We always have a backup plan for how we're all going to get home.

1967
02:28:25,278 --> 02:28:26,599
[SPEAKER_18]: The fact that two of us live here helps.

1968
02:28:27,599 --> 02:28:30,902
[SPEAKER_31]: I had you pick me up to bring me here and I had Dan take me home.

1969
02:28:31,042 --> 02:28:31,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

1970
02:28:31,782 --> 02:28:37,786
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you know, if only everybody could be smart, then we wouldn't have this bullshit happening.

1971
02:28:38,027 --> 02:28:38,547
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what it is.

1972
02:28:38,627 --> 02:28:39,147
[SPEAKER_18]: It's bullshit.

1973
02:28:40,108 --> 02:28:40,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Shouldn't happen.

1974
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:43,450
[SPEAKER_14]: That is really sad.

1975
02:28:43,530 --> 02:28:44,391
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't hear about that.

1976
02:28:44,411 --> 02:28:46,432
[SPEAKER_31]: They just better nail this guy's ass to the wall.

1977
02:28:46,673 --> 02:28:47,413
[SPEAKER_31]: That's all I have to say.

1978
02:28:48,474 --> 02:28:50,755
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm almost positive he died too, but I'm not sure.

1979
02:28:50,876 --> 02:28:51,336
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure.

1980
02:28:54,861 --> 02:28:58,923
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want to get into some more Black Ops stuff, Maker of the Alcohol, Konami.

1981
02:29:07,608 --> 02:29:17,954
[SPEAKER_31]: I just have this thing, though, about the drunk drivers who live, that I am sort of glad that they live for one reason, because dead people can't suffer.

1982
02:29:18,594 --> 02:29:19,535
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't make them suffer.

1983
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:21,492
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a lot of guilt to have.

1984
02:29:21,993 --> 02:29:24,676
[SPEAKER_31]: That's not even the guilt that I care about.

1985
02:29:24,876 --> 02:29:28,199
[SPEAKER_31]: I care about sitting them down and making them suffer repeatedly.

1986
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,445
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think a lot of drunk drivers are necessarily bad people.

1987
02:29:33,725 --> 02:29:35,367
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't matter.

1988
02:29:35,987 --> 02:29:36,588
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I know, I know.

1989
02:29:36,848 --> 02:29:37,369
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't matter.

1990
02:29:37,749 --> 02:29:40,412
[SPEAKER_18]: They made a really horrible, bad...

1991
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:41,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Ignorant.

1992
02:29:41,570 --> 02:29:42,671
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an ignorant decision.

1993
02:29:42,691 --> 02:29:43,632
[SPEAKER_18]: They're ignorant people.

1994
02:29:43,652 --> 02:29:47,034
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that they need to be punished for it for the rest of their life.

1995
02:29:47,694 --> 02:30:01,823
[SPEAKER_31]: Whether they punish themselves or, you know, I think that if you are involved in a drunk driving accident and you were the drunk driver, you need to, for the rest of your life, have your driving privileges revoked.

1996
02:30:03,004 --> 02:30:04,025
[SPEAKER_31]: For the rest of your life.

1997
02:30:04,905 --> 02:30:08,107
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't care how goddamn inconvenient it makes it on you, you do not deserve to drive.

1998
02:30:08,127 --> 02:30:08,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Take the bus!

1999
02:30:09,468 --> 02:30:10,149
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what it's for!

2000
02:30:11,448 --> 02:30:15,089
[SPEAKER_18]: More people should take the bus anyway, not that I should talk, because I drive, but you know.

2001
02:30:18,131 --> 02:30:21,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I do have another... If I lived in a big city, I would take the subway.

2002
02:30:21,732 --> 02:30:21,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes?

2003
02:30:22,272 --> 02:30:23,833
[SPEAKER_31]: I actually do have another F you, by the way.

2004
02:30:23,853 --> 02:30:24,974
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, DarkSakura?

2005
02:30:25,814 --> 02:30:30,756
[SPEAKER_31]: I have an F you to the emissions commercials that they have on the radio here.

2006
02:30:31,716 --> 02:30:38,379
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I normally listen to the radio, but I have a big F you to the emissions one, saying that, you know, drive your car less.

2007
02:30:40,003 --> 02:30:44,026
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you know who the cause of the emissions problem is in this state?

2008
02:30:44,446 --> 02:30:45,627
[SPEAKER_31]: It's freaking industry.

2009
02:30:46,628 --> 02:30:53,153
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, car emissions are negligible in comparison to these unregulated factories that we have floating around.

2010
02:30:53,753 --> 02:30:55,435
[SPEAKER_31]: So, you know what all that is?

2011
02:30:56,576 --> 02:30:58,757
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my whole theory on how government works.

2012
02:30:59,318 --> 02:30:59,598
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay?

2013
02:30:59,618 --> 02:30:59,698
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

2014
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:01,100
[SPEAKER_31]: It's money.

2015
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:01,980
[SPEAKER_31]: It's lobbyists.

2016
02:31:03,901 --> 02:31:05,522
[SPEAKER_31]: We are run by corporations.

2017
02:31:06,202 --> 02:31:09,383
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's these corporations that control what legislature gets passed.

2018
02:31:10,563 --> 02:31:11,364
[SPEAKER_31]: So, anyway.

2019
02:31:12,264 --> 02:31:15,645
[SPEAKER_18]: We had one more FU come in to kind of try and bring the mood back up here a little bit.

2020
02:31:16,365 --> 02:31:26,749
[SPEAKER_18]: DDArcoholic says, FU to Comcast for deleting our connection to Japan TV because it was a mistake and finding out that to get it back it costs $24 a month just for that one channel.

2021
02:31:27,649 --> 02:31:29,290
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess that means we probably lost it too.

2022
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:29,930
[SPEAKER_18]: That makes me sad.

2023
02:31:31,269 --> 02:31:32,750
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, but that still makes me sad.

2024
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:33,611
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a cool network.

2025
02:31:34,652 --> 02:31:34,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh well.

2026
02:31:36,113 --> 02:31:36,613
[SPEAKER_18]: What can you do?

2027
02:31:36,993 --> 02:31:42,837
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that's the station that plays a lot of the current Dorama series that come on too.

2028
02:31:42,857 --> 02:31:43,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

2029
02:31:43,538 --> 02:31:44,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm almost positive it is.

2030
02:31:44,258 --> 02:31:46,180
[SPEAKER_31]: I was watching one in Berkeley that was called Sakura.

2031
02:31:48,982 --> 02:31:49,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh well.

2032
02:31:50,343 --> 02:31:52,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.

2033
02:31:53,585 --> 02:31:58,549
[SPEAKER_18]: When we come back, what we're going to do, we will do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2034
02:31:58,629 --> 02:32:00,030
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also want to show something off.

2035
02:32:01,328 --> 02:32:07,292
[SPEAKER_18]: This computer upgrade has helped us be capable of doing something else here on the show that we will be incorporating in the show in the future.

2036
02:32:08,152 --> 02:32:09,913
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're going to kind of try it out tonight.

2037
02:32:10,434 --> 02:32:12,015
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to show it to you guys when we come back.

2038
02:32:13,055 --> 02:32:13,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me for this break.

2039
02:32:14,474 --> 02:32:15,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Ask Orange Lounge

2040
02:36:36,243 --> 02:36:37,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Baby, it's all in gold

2041
02:38:39,710 --> 02:38:48,332
[SPEAKER_27]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

2042
02:38:54,673 --> 02:38:58,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

2043
02:38:59,774 --> 02:39:02,255
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in just a moment.

2044
02:39:02,810 --> 02:39:06,353
[SPEAKER_18]: But first I want to show off a new feature that we're going to have very soon on the show.

2045
02:39:06,533 --> 02:39:11,216
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just trying to think of ways to implement this in a non-trainwreck sort of way.

2046
02:39:11,717 --> 02:39:13,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yes, I hear a phone ringing.

2047
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:16,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

2048
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:18,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Orange Lounge?

2049
02:39:18,682 --> 02:39:19,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2050
02:39:19,662 --> 02:39:20,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have one question.

2051
02:39:21,364 --> 02:39:21,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2052
02:39:22,324 --> 02:39:23,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me now?

2053
02:39:23,585 --> 02:39:24,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I can hear you now.

2054
02:39:24,966 --> 02:39:25,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is this?

2055
02:39:26,207 --> 02:39:27,028
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Jason.

2056
02:39:27,268 --> 02:39:29,850
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, is this TVX JasonXV?

2057
02:39:30,697 --> 02:39:33,240
[SPEAKER_15]: You would be correct, sir.

2058
02:39:35,222 --> 02:39:36,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, how you doing?

2059
02:39:37,385 --> 02:39:38,606
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing pretty good.

2060
02:39:38,787 --> 02:39:39,267
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.

2061
02:39:39,327 --> 02:39:40,609
[SPEAKER_18]: This is exciting, isn't it?

2062
02:39:41,290 --> 02:39:42,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we can talk to our listeners.

2063
02:39:43,052 --> 02:39:44,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds nice and smooth to me.

2064
02:39:44,413 --> 02:39:47,417
[SPEAKER_18]: Just so you know, this is not a regular phone connection, is it?

2065
02:39:48,594 --> 02:39:50,476
[SPEAKER_15]: No, this is actually a digital connection.

2066
02:39:50,636 --> 02:39:52,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, this is an all-digital secure connection.

2067
02:39:52,798 --> 02:39:54,500
[SPEAKER_18]: We're using a program called Skype.

2068
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:56,641
[SPEAKER_18]: You can download it at Skype.org.

2069
02:39:56,701 --> 02:39:57,742
[SPEAKER_18]: It's completely free.

2070
02:39:57,762 --> 02:39:58,843
[SPEAKER_31]: You should spell it for everybody.

2071
02:39:59,063 --> 02:40:00,625
[SPEAKER_18]: S-K-Y-P-E.

2072
02:40:01,726 --> 02:40:05,229
[SPEAKER_18]: And when we get this running, which we will soon, you'll be able to call us.

2073
02:40:05,669 --> 02:40:13,796
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have a broadband connection, unfortunately those of you with a modem connection, it's going to be too much for your connections, you're not going to be able to do it, but if you have a broadband connection, you will be able to interact with us.

2074
02:40:13,936 --> 02:40:22,364
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're not sure in what capacity yet, we're probably going to have to control it somehow, but you will be able to call the show, and it'll be fun.

2075
02:40:22,704 --> 02:40:24,666
[SPEAKER_18]: And Jamie can yell at you in person, which will be great.

2076
02:40:25,246 --> 02:40:27,368
[SPEAKER_31]: And know your phone bill has nothing to do with this.

2077
02:40:27,782 --> 02:40:30,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, this is not an actual phone line.

2078
02:40:30,304 --> 02:40:34,687
[SPEAKER_31]: This is the same thing as sending an IM to somebody just verbally.

2079
02:40:34,787 --> 02:40:35,607
[SPEAKER_18]: This is voice chat.

2080
02:40:35,707 --> 02:40:36,888
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a voice chat program on that.

2081
02:40:36,928 --> 02:40:38,049
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like Xbox Live.

2082
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:42,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Except there's not people on it going, you know, Bitch, bitch, bitch, your mom, your mom.

2083
02:40:43,633 --> 02:40:44,913
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a controller cheater.

2084
02:40:45,093 --> 02:40:46,054
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a controller cheater.

2085
02:40:46,074 --> 02:40:46,594
[SPEAKER_15]: You're lame.

2086
02:40:47,335 --> 02:40:51,057
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's going to be cool is when they come out with iToyChat.

2087
02:40:52,258 --> 02:40:53,339
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still waiting for that.

2088
02:40:53,951 --> 02:40:56,814
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming, it's coming, so soon enough we'll have that.

2089
02:40:57,194 --> 02:40:59,576
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll be able to see your ugly mugs at the same time.

2090
02:41:02,458 --> 02:41:04,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we'll definitely have to do something with iToyChat in the future.

2091
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:06,442
[SPEAKER_31]: Jason needs to come back out and hang out with us again.

2092
02:41:08,123 --> 02:41:09,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an excellent... Hold on!

2093
02:41:09,925 --> 02:41:10,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, stop!

2094
02:41:10,585 --> 02:41:11,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop the show!

2095
02:41:11,546 --> 02:41:12,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an excellent idea.

2096
02:41:12,807 --> 02:41:15,850
[SPEAKER_14]: We could broadcast all of our shows over iToyChat.

2097
02:41:17,251 --> 02:41:17,391
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

2098
02:41:18,539 --> 02:41:19,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, come on.

2099
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:21,581
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's moderators on iToyChat.

2100
02:41:21,601 --> 02:41:22,781
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd probably get banned.

2101
02:41:24,442 --> 02:41:24,803
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

2102
02:41:24,843 --> 02:41:25,583
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see when it comes out.

2103
02:41:26,844 --> 02:41:27,064
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2104
02:41:27,084 --> 02:41:29,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thanks for calling, Jason, and helping us show off this new toy.

2105
02:41:30,266 --> 02:41:30,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2106
02:41:30,526 --> 02:41:32,287
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you for filling in for the show last week.

2107
02:41:32,307 --> 02:41:33,047
[SPEAKER_18]: That was very nice of you.

2108
02:41:33,687 --> 02:41:35,628
[SPEAKER_15]: It was very fun once I actually got underway.

2109
02:41:35,649 --> 02:41:36,609
[SPEAKER_18]: When are you going to do your own show?

2110
02:41:37,650 --> 02:41:39,971
[SPEAKER_15]: As soon as I actually have a definitive schedule.

2111
02:41:40,351 --> 02:41:40,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds good to me.

2112
02:41:41,792 --> 02:41:41,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2113
02:41:42,272 --> 02:41:42,552
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2114
02:41:42,572 --> 02:41:43,293
[SPEAKER_18]: You have a good one, Jason.

2115
02:41:43,313 --> 02:41:43,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for calling.

2116
02:41:44,293 --> 02:41:44,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Goodbye, sir.

2117
02:41:45,034 --> 02:41:45,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

2118
02:41:45,514 --> 02:41:45,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

2119
02:41:46,615 --> 02:41:46,895
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2120
02:41:46,915 --> 02:41:47,315
[SPEAKER_18]: That was fun.

2121
02:41:48,305 --> 02:41:52,227
[SPEAKER_18]: That's going to be a fun program to start using when we figure out how to do it.

2122
02:41:52,267 --> 02:41:54,308
[SPEAKER_18]: But get on board right now.

2123
02:41:55,128 --> 02:41:57,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Skype.org.

2124
02:41:58,169 --> 02:42:00,630
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, people are posting the link in the chat room.

2125
02:42:01,531 --> 02:42:05,812
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get a user account made just for Orange Lounge and figure something out.

2126
02:42:05,993 --> 02:42:07,093
[SPEAKER_18]: You did make one a while back, didn't you?

2127
02:42:07,833 --> 02:42:08,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Amy.

2128
02:42:08,594 --> 02:42:11,615
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to make a quick statement.

2129
02:42:12,051 --> 02:42:13,932
[SPEAKER_31]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2130
02:42:39,389 --> 02:42:39,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

2131
02:42:39,869 --> 02:42:43,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.

2132
02:42:43,652 --> 02:42:45,133
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to find my Ask Orange Lounge music.

2133
02:42:45,594 --> 02:42:48,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that we can actually do the music on beat, I can't find the damn music.

2134
02:42:49,337 --> 02:42:49,777
[SPEAKER_18]: It's horrible.

2135
02:42:51,038 --> 02:42:51,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Found it.

2136
02:42:51,518 --> 02:42:51,899
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

2137
02:42:52,619 --> 02:42:58,244
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to answer some questions that were sent to us by you for any of our hosts.

2138
02:42:58,284 --> 02:42:59,645
[SPEAKER_18]: You can ask us anything you want.

2139
02:42:59,685 --> 02:43:00,245
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind?

2140
02:43:00,265 --> 02:43:01,166
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you want us to talk about?

2141
02:43:01,206 --> 02:43:01,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

2142
02:43:07,911 --> 02:43:09,072
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

2143
02:43:09,682 --> 02:43:10,762
[SPEAKER_18]: Some stupid question.

2144
02:43:11,303 --> 02:43:14,544
[SPEAKER_18]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2145
02:43:15,364 --> 02:43:16,385
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what we'll learn.

2146
02:43:16,825 --> 02:43:18,225
[SPEAKER_18]: The questions are probably pretty dumb.

2147
02:43:18,706 --> 02:43:22,067
[SPEAKER_18]: But all I know is I feel great because now I can sing in sync.

2148
02:43:25,608 --> 02:43:28,390
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounded profane.

2149
02:43:29,170 --> 02:43:30,550
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one question!

2150
02:43:31,651 --> 02:43:35,993
[SPEAKER_18]: EvilNauki2DX, when is the next time you'll be in San Francisco?

2151
02:43:36,053 --> 02:43:37,933
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been over a year since I last seen you guys.

2152
02:43:38,334 --> 02:43:39,274
[SPEAKER_31]: When do you pay for the trip?

2153
02:43:41,326 --> 02:43:47,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I want to go to Dave & Buster's in Mopita, so I know it's not San Francisco, but I really want to go to DMV's again.

2154
02:43:47,171 --> 02:43:47,811
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh my god, I want to.

2155
02:43:48,332 --> 02:43:54,516
[SPEAKER_14]: A certain host has a certain birthday coming up with a certain power crash anniversary.

2156
02:43:54,536 --> 02:43:57,038
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that's like six weeks away.

2157
02:43:57,098 --> 02:43:57,739
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to go now.

2158
02:43:58,099 --> 02:44:00,221
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to go when I get back from East Coast.

2159
02:44:02,442 --> 02:44:04,884
[SPEAKER_31]: We should celebrate the return of Rob with booze.

2160
02:44:04,904 --> 02:44:05,004
[SPEAKER_31]: Booze.

2161
02:44:07,024 --> 02:44:10,187
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a going away party and a coming back party.

2162
02:44:11,067 --> 02:44:15,851
[SPEAKER_31]: What was that game that you played with the really gay name?

2163
02:44:17,071 --> 02:44:19,213
[SPEAKER_31]: It was right behind our table on my birthday.

2164
02:44:20,094 --> 02:44:20,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Flaming Fingers.

2165
02:44:20,954 --> 02:44:22,195
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, that was great.

2166
02:44:23,116 --> 02:44:23,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on.

2167
02:44:24,437 --> 02:44:25,557
[SPEAKER_31]: You should win on that again.

2168
02:44:26,098 --> 02:44:31,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, Dave and Busters is having an I Love the 90s viewing party all this week, says Shark Skrull.

2169
02:44:31,141 --> 02:44:31,822
[SPEAKER_31]: We need to go.

2170
02:44:31,862 --> 02:44:32,462
[SPEAKER_18]: What a cool...

2171
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,102
[SPEAKER_31]: Dead Air, fun.

2172
02:44:36,202 --> 02:44:39,727
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just sending a private message to a buddy.

2173
02:44:49,673 --> 02:44:52,295
[SPEAKER_18]: John Fields says, I know this really isn't Bimani.

2174
02:44:52,395 --> 02:44:52,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2175
02:44:52,976 --> 02:44:53,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Number two question.

2176
02:44:54,718 --> 02:44:59,682
[SPEAKER_18]: I know this isn't really Bimani related anyway, but did you see the end of season two of Red vs. Blue?

2177
02:44:59,782 --> 02:45:01,263
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you did, what did you think of it?

2178
02:45:01,464 --> 02:45:02,765
[SPEAKER_31]: I need to go watch those.

2179
02:45:02,785 --> 02:45:05,427
[SPEAKER_31]: I haven't watched anything since the last season of Red vs. Blue.

2180
02:45:07,849 --> 02:45:10,612
[SPEAKER_31]: Red vs. Blue is awesome.

2181
02:45:10,632 --> 02:45:11,072
[SPEAKER_18]: What is it?

2182
02:45:11,232 --> 02:45:11,893
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know.

2183
02:45:12,213 --> 02:45:14,035
[SPEAKER_31]: It's these funny movies that they did.

2184
02:45:15,830 --> 02:45:16,891
[SPEAKER_31]: Using the Halo engine.

2185
02:45:17,731 --> 02:45:18,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I have heard of that.

2186
02:45:19,032 --> 02:45:19,813
[SPEAKER_31]: They're great.

2187
02:45:19,853 --> 02:45:20,993
[SPEAKER_31]: I've got the first DVD.

2188
02:45:22,854 --> 02:45:23,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

2189
02:45:23,054 --> 02:45:24,935
[SPEAKER_31]: So she can just download all of them off the internet.

2190
02:45:24,955 --> 02:45:27,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Didn't Microsoft start actually paying them to do it?

2191
02:45:27,297 --> 02:45:29,158
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, they thought it was awesome.

2192
02:45:29,218 --> 02:45:29,978
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really cool.

2193
02:45:30,018 --> 02:45:38,023
[SPEAKER_31]: If you go into GameStop, their Xbox demos, the little cut scenes in between are the red versus blue guys.

2194
02:45:38,826 --> 02:45:39,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

2195
02:45:39,827 --> 02:45:44,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should talk more good things about Xbox and they'll hire us to do, you know, something.

2196
02:45:44,690 --> 02:45:46,571
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Ultramix is great.

2197
02:45:46,611 --> 02:45:49,233
[SPEAKER_18]: You should go buy an Xbox today and play it.

2198
02:45:49,273 --> 02:45:49,973
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so much fun.

2199
02:45:50,033 --> 02:45:54,296
[SPEAKER_31]: I wish everybody listening could see the expression on your face.

2200
02:45:55,777 --> 02:45:56,918
[SPEAKER_31]: You look constipated.

2201
02:45:58,519 --> 02:45:58,959
[SPEAKER_31]: It's great.

2202
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:01,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Number three question.

2203
02:46:04,110 --> 02:46:08,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Flairone wants to know, you guys always make a bunch of general comments about your work.

2204
02:46:08,634 --> 02:46:10,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Where do you guys work exactly?

2205
02:46:10,935 --> 02:46:11,756
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not telling.

2206
02:46:11,996 --> 02:46:15,839
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not going to tell exactly where we work, but we can tell what kind of work we do.

2207
02:46:16,279 --> 02:46:17,661
[SPEAKER_31]: I work for a student loan lender.

2208
02:46:18,681 --> 02:46:20,022
[SPEAKER_31]: A very big student loan lender.

2209
02:46:20,943 --> 02:46:25,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Owned by a very big bank.

2210
02:46:25,907 --> 02:46:28,549
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a corporate trainer for a very large health insurance company.

2211
02:46:30,378 --> 02:46:31,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Not very large, but somewhat big.

2212
02:46:32,019 --> 02:46:34,100
[SPEAKER_31]: I work in customer service.

2213
02:46:34,741 --> 02:46:36,482
[SPEAKER_18]: It's big in this state, but probably not where you live.

2214
02:46:36,982 --> 02:46:37,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Loki.

2215
02:46:37,802 --> 02:46:38,303
[SPEAKER_31]: Wait, one thing.

2216
02:46:38,823 --> 02:46:39,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2217
02:46:39,403 --> 02:46:41,124
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I am that phone voice.

2218
02:46:44,926 --> 02:46:47,688
[SPEAKER_14]: I sit and read the internet.

2219
02:46:49,749 --> 02:46:50,649
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I do.

2220
02:46:50,829 --> 02:46:51,830
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a jizz mopper.

2221
02:46:52,530 --> 02:46:53,811
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not a jizz mopper.

2222
02:46:54,011 --> 02:46:55,812
[SPEAKER_14]: I talk to stupid people.

2223
02:46:56,596 --> 02:47:02,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Mostly stupid people in the Midwest because they're extraordinarily stupid.

2224
02:47:02,979 --> 02:47:05,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially the people that work at video stores there.

2225
02:47:06,261 --> 02:47:07,502
God, they're so stupid.

2226
02:47:08,823 --> 02:47:09,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2227
02:47:12,685 --> 02:47:15,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, yeah, I work in the video industry.

2228
02:47:16,487 --> 02:47:17,887
[SPEAKER_14]: The movie industry.

2229
02:47:18,348 --> 02:47:19,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I get free movies.

2230
02:47:20,449 --> 02:47:22,490
[SPEAKER_31]: To answer John Fields real quick.

2231
02:47:22,670 --> 02:47:22,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

2232
02:47:23,985 --> 02:47:28,187
[SPEAKER_31]: The federal government doesn't freaking care where you work.

2233
02:47:29,107 --> 02:47:32,948
[SPEAKER_31]: You still have to fill out your FAFSA to get your student loans.

2234
02:47:33,088 --> 02:47:35,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if you work for the IRS, you still have to pay your taxes every year.

2235
02:47:35,969 --> 02:47:36,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

2236
02:47:36,330 --> 02:47:36,750
[SPEAKER_31]: Believe it or not.

2237
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:38,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it, I know.

2238
02:47:39,251 --> 02:47:47,554
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm going to be taking out my student loans through where I work because I'll, you know, not necessarily that I'll get a better deal on it, it's just I simply know how the processes are.

2239
02:47:48,134 --> 02:47:49,975
[SPEAKER_18]: You can go in there and tweak your account.

2240
02:47:50,035 --> 02:47:52,136
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I wouldn't do that.

2241
02:47:52,356 --> 02:47:53,256
[SPEAKER_31]: But you still...

2242
02:47:55,399 --> 02:48:03,406
[SPEAKER_31]: The FAFSA, if you've never done your own FAFSA, I recommend do it because it asks for all of this information.

2243
02:48:03,907 --> 02:48:06,049
[SPEAKER_31]: It looks for the crap on your income taxes.

2244
02:48:06,089 --> 02:48:07,450
[SPEAKER_31]: It doesn't give a shit where you work.

2245
02:48:08,171 --> 02:48:09,492
[SPEAKER_31]: It just asks how much money you made.

2246
02:48:12,355 --> 02:48:12,855
[SPEAKER_31]: And that is all.

2247
02:48:13,747 --> 02:48:27,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright Next question Next question Number four question Also from Flareon A Also, with that one promo where if you don't listen to Orange Lounge too often you get killed by an assassin through the computer Does it say seven days at the end?

2248
02:48:27,971 --> 02:48:32,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it does Yes If so, is that in reference to the crappy UPN series from years ago?

2249
02:48:32,333 --> 02:48:36,814
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it's The Ring Yeah, you need to rent The Ring Oh my god, you haven't seen that?

2250
02:48:36,854 --> 02:48:42,676
[SPEAKER_31]: That movie is so awesome I didn't see it until it came out on video Have you seen the Japanese one?

2251
02:48:43,894 --> 02:48:44,735
[SPEAKER_18]: I've not seen Ringu.

2252
02:48:44,775 --> 02:48:45,675
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard it's not as good.

2253
02:48:46,316 --> 02:48:48,418
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, no, it's a different type of movie.

2254
02:48:48,978 --> 02:48:49,438
[SPEAKER_31]: The U.S.

2255
02:48:49,538 --> 02:48:51,140
[SPEAKER_31]: one is more for scare.

2256
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:53,722
[SPEAKER_31]: The Japanese one is more suspense.

2257
02:48:55,483 --> 02:48:58,546
[SPEAKER_31]: And it also brings in this whole stupid psychic thing with it.

2258
02:48:59,146 --> 02:49:00,347
[SPEAKER_31]: But the book is really good.

2259
02:49:00,647 --> 02:49:01,468
[SPEAKER_31]: The book is really good.

2260
02:49:02,329 --> 02:49:02,589
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyway.

2261
02:49:04,210 --> 02:49:06,912
[SPEAKER_31]: I had this whole big fandom for The Ring going on for a while.

2262
02:49:08,153 --> 02:49:08,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2263
02:49:11,216 --> 02:49:11,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

2264
02:49:11,996 --> 02:49:12,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

2265
02:49:13,936 --> 02:49:14,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn, I thought that was a question.

2266
02:49:15,357 --> 02:49:15,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, here we go.

2267
02:49:15,777 --> 02:49:18,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Number five question from Jason.

2268
02:49:18,879 --> 02:49:21,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Which new consumer style do you want to see first?

2269
02:49:22,582 --> 02:49:30,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Gita Dora 5 and 4, Poppin' 10, 2DX8, or a new DDR?

2270
02:49:31,828 --> 02:49:32,888
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd have to say in order.

2271
02:49:33,629 --> 02:49:40,213
[SPEAKER_31]: I really want 2DX8, and then Gita Dora 5-4, and then Poppin'.

2272
02:49:41,263 --> 02:49:50,986
[SPEAKER_31]: Just because I, you know, well, I didn't buy Poppin' 9, which I probably should have, but Dan has just been going off wanting new Guitar Freaks Drum Mania.

2273
02:49:51,486 --> 02:49:57,928
[SPEAKER_31]: And I have two Guitar Freaks controllers and a Drum Mania controller collecting dust in my house.

2274
02:49:59,689 --> 02:50:07,511
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually put a new DDR at the top of my list, and then I would say 2DX8, Poppin' 10, Guitador 5-4.

2275
02:50:07,611 --> 02:50:09,992
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really collect the Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania at home.

2276
02:50:10,032 --> 02:50:11,052
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's good for other people

2277
02:50:11,522 --> 02:50:12,623
[SPEAKER_18]: I really want them all to come out.

2278
02:50:13,263 --> 02:50:13,824
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see.

2279
02:50:13,884 --> 02:50:14,945
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want a new DDR.

2280
02:50:15,005 --> 02:50:16,366
[SPEAKER_31]: I want a new Keyboard Mania.

2281
02:50:19,048 --> 02:50:19,809
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what I want.

2282
02:50:20,289 --> 02:50:21,350
[SPEAKER_31]: And another Pada Pada.

2283
02:50:25,533 --> 02:50:25,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2284
02:50:27,014 --> 02:50:27,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

2285
02:50:27,295 --> 02:50:29,196
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to get set up on something here.

2286
02:50:29,796 --> 02:50:30,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Puppy has a question.

2287
02:50:30,697 --> 02:50:31,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Number six question.

2288
02:50:32,833 --> 02:50:36,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you believe that my little brother got a job working at a TapX in my hometown?

2289
02:50:36,575 --> 02:50:37,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Because he did.

2290
02:50:37,376 --> 02:50:39,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Those things are starting to pop up everywhere.

2291
02:50:39,437 --> 02:50:40,358
[SPEAKER_31]: They seriously are.

2292
02:50:40,518 --> 02:50:42,299
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish one would open up near here.

2293
02:50:43,460 --> 02:50:47,843
[SPEAKER_31]: I went to the TapX down off of Sutterville.

2294
02:50:48,904 --> 02:50:50,405
[SPEAKER_31]: And they are really nice.

2295
02:50:50,445 --> 02:50:53,206
[SPEAKER_31]: They have a big widescreen TV and they let you change the channels on it.

2296
02:50:54,267 --> 02:50:56,449
[SPEAKER_31]: And then they have a PlayStation hooked up to it.

2297
02:50:57,049 --> 02:50:58,050
[SPEAKER_31]: A PS2 hooked up to it.

2298
02:50:58,090 --> 02:50:59,410
[SPEAKER_31]: So you can play whatever games they have there.

2299
02:50:59,651 --> 02:51:00,491
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually saw that.

2300
02:51:00,571 --> 02:51:01,472
[SPEAKER_18]: They have iToy Groove.

2301
02:51:02,316 --> 02:51:08,098
[SPEAKER_31]: and if you pay $5 a month, you can use their broadband service.

2302
02:51:08,979 --> 02:51:09,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's cool.

2303
02:51:09,339 --> 02:51:10,179
[SPEAKER_31]: They'll give you broadband.

2304
02:51:11,560 --> 02:51:12,980
[SPEAKER_31]: Wireless broadband, too, if you have a laptop.

2305
02:51:14,381 --> 02:51:14,761
[SPEAKER_31]: Pretty good, huh?

2306
02:51:14,801 --> 02:51:15,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

2307
02:51:17,502 --> 02:51:17,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2308
02:51:20,623 --> 02:51:22,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I think we'll go ahead and we'll try and do this.

2309
02:51:33,308 --> 02:51:34,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry about that guys, we dropped for just a second there.

2310
02:51:34,889 --> 02:51:36,870
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't drop, but our sound went out for a second there.

2311
02:51:36,890 --> 02:51:38,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I'm actually trying to set Skype back up.

2312
02:51:39,052 --> 02:51:41,834
[SPEAKER_18]: If you guys want to contact us on Skype, we'll open up the Skype lines.

2313
02:51:41,854 --> 02:51:43,355
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll take one call before the end of the show.

2314
02:51:43,655 --> 02:51:45,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything you want to talk about in regards to tonight's show.

2315
02:51:45,917 --> 02:51:48,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Username, Orange Lounge Radio.

2316
02:51:48,358 --> 02:51:51,160
[SPEAKER_18]: All one word, Orange Lounge Radio.

2317
02:51:52,861 --> 02:51:59,085
[SPEAKER_31]: And by the way, in answer to John Fields, it is $5 a month to use the broadband at their TapX.

2318
02:52:01,069 --> 02:52:05,030
[SPEAKER_18]: We did get another question real fast while we wait for a call to come through on the skyline.

2319
02:52:05,591 --> 02:52:08,332
[SPEAKER_18]: Black Lab wants to know, what is favorite Pokemon of you?

2320
02:52:11,113 --> 02:52:11,953
[SPEAKER_31]: Number seven question.

2321
02:52:13,534 --> 02:52:15,494
[SPEAKER_31]: I used to like Togepi a whole lot.

2322
02:52:18,115 --> 02:52:20,876
[SPEAKER_31]: But I liked Porygon because it made all the children have seizures.

2323
02:52:23,137 --> 02:52:24,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Jigglypuff was my favorite.

2324
02:52:25,078 --> 02:52:25,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

2325
02:52:29,560 --> 02:52:29,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

2326
02:52:30,888 --> 02:52:37,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, uh... My favorite would have to be... Heart Attack Squirrel.

2327
02:52:41,975 --> 02:52:46,999
[SPEAKER_31]: I liked in Evangelion Redeath how they had the giant, real, geek Pikachu battle.

2328
02:52:47,579 --> 02:52:48,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Fanboy Bebop.

2329
02:52:48,980 --> 02:52:49,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Penis!

2330
02:52:51,422 --> 02:52:57,426
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a fan animation that somebody did that instead of Pikachu was Fuckachu.

2331
02:52:59,367 --> 02:52:59,467
[SPEAKER_31]: And...

2332
02:53:01,543 --> 02:53:03,504
[SPEAKER_31]: It's actually about the human Pokemon, though.

2333
02:53:03,564 --> 02:53:05,645
[SPEAKER_31]: But I have to get it from my friend and show it to you.

2334
02:53:05,685 --> 02:53:06,205
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really funny.

2335
02:53:06,945 --> 02:53:11,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to see ReDeath and Fanboy Bebop again.

2336
02:53:11,327 --> 02:53:12,748
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to get a copy of Nescaflowne.

2337
02:53:13,008 --> 02:53:16,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't understand why these movies have not made their way onto the internet.

2338
02:53:16,549 --> 02:53:17,729
[SPEAKER_31]: Nescaflowne, yes.

2339
02:53:17,809 --> 02:53:18,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Nescaflowne.

2340
02:53:19,190 --> 02:53:20,370
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I've got Fanboy Bebop.

2341
02:53:21,151 --> 02:53:21,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

2342
02:53:21,951 --> 02:53:23,692
[SPEAKER_31]: That movie is awesome.

2343
02:53:24,792 --> 02:53:26,893
[SPEAKER_31]: I also have the cutscenes from Fanboy Bebop, too.

2344
02:53:27,673 --> 02:53:29,254
[SPEAKER_31]: With the It's Gendo scene.

2345
02:53:30,701 --> 02:53:31,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't they play those?

2346
02:53:31,502 --> 02:53:34,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought they played those at the very end, like after the credits.

2347
02:53:34,423 --> 02:53:34,843
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

2348
02:53:35,844 --> 02:53:38,465
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll have to find my tape.

2349
02:53:38,485 --> 02:53:42,947
[SPEAKER_31]: And I did have Jubei Powers, Japanese Man of Intercourse.

2350
02:53:43,467 --> 02:53:44,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I hated that.

2351
02:53:45,288 --> 02:53:46,448
[SPEAKER_31]: It had funny scenes.

2352
02:53:46,548 --> 02:53:48,569
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to make a Gendo movie.

2353
02:53:49,470 --> 02:53:51,731
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Gendo the movie.

2354
02:53:52,431 --> 02:53:54,092
[SPEAKER_31]: Did you hear what I snuck in on the pre-show?

2355
02:53:54,112 --> 02:53:54,152
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

2356
02:53:55,094 --> 02:53:55,975
[SPEAKER_31]: The Misato.

2357
02:53:56,715 --> 02:53:58,176
[SPEAKER_31]: I have two bestestes.

2358
02:53:58,896 --> 02:54:00,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Not one, but two.

2359
02:54:01,317 --> 02:54:09,302
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear they changed the dialogue in that because I thought there was one that was like a part that said shut up Shinzi and then they changed it to no.

2360
02:54:11,643 --> 02:54:14,804
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it looks like that as far as I've seen it because I saw it at Faname when they played it.

2361
02:54:16,785 --> 02:54:17,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh well.

2362
02:54:18,326 --> 02:54:19,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody likes us, oh well.

2363
02:54:21,032 --> 02:54:27,115
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think enough people have gotten Skype yet because we just said it like 10 minutes ago we're going to be using this and I don't think a lot of people even have this program yet.

2364
02:54:27,135 --> 02:54:28,435
[SPEAKER_31]: I have another parody you might like.

2365
02:54:28,655 --> 02:54:29,616
[SPEAKER_18]: But we'll see what happens, huh?

2366
02:54:30,116 --> 02:54:31,577
[SPEAKER_31]: Voltron hellbent for leather.

2367
02:54:33,438 --> 02:54:33,838
[SPEAKER_31]: What?

2368
02:54:36,379 --> 02:54:38,920
[SPEAKER_31]: It's really old but I'll have to copy it for you.

2369
02:54:41,441 --> 02:54:42,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys are crazy.

2370
02:54:46,966 --> 02:54:50,547
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we got some people saying they're going to call in, they're trying to install the program now.

2371
02:54:50,587 --> 02:54:57,229
[SPEAKER_18]: We've only got time to take like one or two calls, so if you don't get through this week, definitely we can do... Do we have any more waiting for us via private message?

2372
02:54:57,269 --> 02:55:00,591
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have any other questions waiting private message, so I'm just kind of... I have a message.

2373
02:55:00,951 --> 02:55:01,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2374
02:55:01,471 --> 02:55:02,891
[SPEAKER_31]: Why are we so damn cool?

2375
02:55:05,772 --> 02:55:07,333
[SPEAKER_18]: Haven't you missed doing the show, though?

2376
02:55:09,013 --> 02:55:12,335
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, I've missed... No, finally, we're getting a damn call.

2377
02:55:12,355 --> 02:55:13,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, I don't even know...

2378
02:55:21,892 --> 02:55:23,513
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know how to answer the damn call.

2379
02:55:23,574 --> 02:55:24,634
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not coming up on the screen.

2380
02:55:25,375 --> 02:55:27,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I just hung up on whoever was calling.

2381
02:55:27,857 --> 02:55:28,577
[SPEAKER_30]: We're sorry.

2382
02:55:28,837 --> 02:55:35,522
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to actually change something here on my options real fast because it's trying to... Holy crap, it's Zaku.

2383
02:55:37,023 --> 02:55:43,388
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to have it not switch... No, I'm trying to make sure it doesn't switch...

2384
02:55:44,636 --> 02:55:54,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'm actually going to disable calls for a second because I don't want people to call just yet because what it's doing, it's switching our input, which is fucking up our thing going out.

2385
02:55:54,282 --> 02:55:55,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'll fix it.

2386
02:55:55,783 --> 02:55:56,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, guys.

2387
02:55:56,704 --> 02:55:58,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, help me fill time.

2388
02:55:59,906 --> 02:56:00,646
[SPEAKER_31]: Fill time.

2389
02:56:00,846 --> 02:56:03,248
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I could rant.

2390
02:56:04,108 --> 02:56:04,188
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure.

2391
02:56:04,208 --> 02:56:05,389
[SPEAKER_31]: Or we could listen to the ferrets.

2392
02:56:08,746 --> 02:56:09,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I got it fixed.

2393
02:56:09,686 --> 02:56:10,447
[SPEAKER_18]: We can take a call now.

2394
02:56:10,527 --> 02:56:12,067
[SPEAKER_31]: I knew the ferret would get you motivated.

2395
02:56:12,087 --> 02:56:15,828
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason, the last person that called, I did not get the answer button when you called.

2396
02:56:15,928 --> 02:56:18,109
[SPEAKER_18]: So make sure we're on your buddy list, I guess.

2397
02:56:18,609 --> 02:56:19,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe, I don't know.

2398
02:56:21,970 --> 02:56:22,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, maybe you did.

2399
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:24,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if I can do it.

2400
02:56:25,411 --> 02:56:26,452
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're getting a call now.

2401
02:56:27,972 --> 02:56:28,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't answer it.

2402
02:56:30,713 --> 02:56:31,573
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not letting me answer it.

2403
02:56:34,534 --> 02:56:36,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let me see if I can change it from friends only.

2404
02:56:36,595 --> 02:56:36,935
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.

2405
02:56:37,659 --> 02:56:38,539
[SPEAKER_18]: There, I got it.

2406
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:38,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

2407
02:56:41,241 --> 02:56:41,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

2408
02:56:42,061 --> 02:56:42,822
[SPEAKER_18]: You're on Orange Lounge?

2409
02:56:43,622 --> 02:56:43,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2410
02:56:44,163 --> 02:56:44,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is this?

2411
02:56:45,743 --> 02:56:47,144
[SPEAKER_09]: It's EvilNaoki2DX.

2412
02:56:47,344 --> 02:56:48,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, EvilNaoki2DX!

2413
02:56:48,985 --> 02:56:50,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Naoki, whatever.

2414
02:56:50,566 --> 02:56:51,086
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

2415
02:56:51,727 --> 02:56:52,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm alright.

2416
02:56:52,287 --> 02:56:53,968
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my Ototo-chan.

2417
02:56:54,908 --> 02:56:55,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Onitan.

2418
02:56:56,449 --> 02:56:56,969
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

2419
02:56:58,550 --> 02:56:58,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Eh.

2420
02:57:00,291 --> 02:57:01,132
[SPEAKER_31]: How am I ever?

2421
02:57:03,333 --> 02:57:07,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything you wanted to say about tonight's show or a comment on anything we've talked about tonight?

2422
02:57:07,745 --> 02:57:10,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, you guys got the Skype thing up.

2423
02:57:10,747 --> 02:57:16,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell by my Winamp, it's kind of lagging behind, so it's starting to confuse me, so I put it on mute real quick.

2424
02:57:16,131 --> 02:57:17,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you're going to have to do that.

2425
02:57:17,452 --> 02:57:25,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Folks, when you do call in to the station, make sure you put your Winamp down, because there is about a 30-second delay between us talking to you and then, just like real radio.

2426
02:57:26,859 --> 02:57:27,760
[SPEAKER_18]: Except we don't dump the F1.

2427
02:57:27,780 --> 02:57:29,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello to DarklineXDI as well.

2428
02:57:29,561 --> 02:57:32,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say, well, what's up, and...

2429
02:57:34,164 --> 02:57:39,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully I will come up to Sacramento one day soon and actually be on the show live.

2430
02:57:40,345 --> 02:57:41,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitely, you've got to come be on the show live sometime.

2431
02:57:42,626 --> 02:57:43,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes, definitely.

2432
02:57:44,066 --> 02:57:44,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Any shoutouts?

2433
02:57:45,086 --> 02:57:48,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Any TRL style Carson Daly blessed shoutouts you want to give?

2434
02:57:50,047 --> 02:57:57,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to Angel and DarkLineXPI and anyone else who wants a shoutout, here's my shoutout.

2435
02:57:58,968 --> 02:57:59,769
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very kind of you.

2436
02:58:00,449 --> 02:58:01,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and Rob?

2437
02:58:01,669 --> 02:58:01,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?

2438
02:58:01,929 --> 02:58:02,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2439
02:58:02,904 --> 02:58:06,427
[SPEAKER_09]: When are you coming to my house in a French maid outfit?

2440
02:58:06,687 --> 02:58:09,650
[SPEAKER_09]: You promised me back at Replicon.

2441
02:58:09,790 --> 02:58:13,974
[SPEAKER_18]: When I can afford a French maid outfit, I will come in my French maid outfit.

2442
02:58:14,694 --> 02:58:15,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're so kind.

2443
02:58:15,735 --> 02:58:15,995
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

2444
02:58:16,136 --> 02:58:18,398
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I'm going to let you go so we can take one more call before we leave.

2445
02:58:18,418 --> 02:58:18,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2446
02:58:18,858 --> 02:58:19,378
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, bud.

2447
02:58:19,398 --> 02:58:20,059
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, see you guys later.

2448
02:58:20,179 --> 02:58:20,620
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, bye.

2449
02:58:21,300 --> 02:58:26,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, if anybody else wants to call in, any comment on any of tonight's topics, Skype line is open for you guys.

2450
02:58:26,284 --> 02:58:27,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Username, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2451
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:31,342
[SPEAKER_18]: SKYPE.org is the program you've got to get.

2452
02:58:31,382 --> 02:58:34,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Brand new thing we're rolling out tonight, the Skype line.

2453
02:58:34,724 --> 02:58:36,585
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll wait and see if anybody else wants to give us a call.

2454
02:58:36,605 --> 02:58:38,246
[SPEAKER_31]: That just sounds cool, the Skype line.

2455
02:58:38,366 --> 02:58:38,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

2456
02:58:39,406 --> 02:58:42,829
[SPEAKER_31]: It should be like 1-900-HOT-SKYPE.

2457
02:58:43,869 --> 02:58:44,470
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's very smart.

2458
02:58:44,490 --> 02:58:49,032
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what's kind of neat about this is supposedly we can dial out too using this thing.

2459
02:58:49,072 --> 02:58:50,613
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't know how well that works.

2460
02:58:51,314 --> 02:58:53,155
[SPEAKER_18]: We could try calling my cell phone and see what happens.

2461
02:58:55,296 --> 02:58:56,037
[SPEAKER_18]: We're getting a call.

2462
02:58:56,057 --> 02:58:56,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on.

2463
02:58:58,004 --> 02:58:58,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2464
02:58:59,926 --> 02:59:01,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, it's me, DarkLineXPI.

2465
02:59:01,908 --> 02:59:02,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Turn down your wind amp.

2466
02:59:04,250 --> 02:59:05,071
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, hold on.

2467
02:59:05,311 --> 02:59:05,732
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

2468
02:59:08,835 --> 02:59:09,836
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, it's down now.

2469
02:59:09,956 --> 02:59:10,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2470
02:59:10,837 --> 02:59:13,019
[SPEAKER_18]: You sound like you're calling us from a glass jar.

2471
02:59:14,721 --> 02:59:18,945
[SPEAKER_31]: He's hanging out with the tin can lady from Solo.

2472
02:59:19,966 --> 02:59:20,927
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess it's just my mic.

2473
02:59:21,934 --> 02:59:22,454
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all good.

2474
02:59:22,954 --> 02:59:25,395
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys will have plenty of time to play around with settings.

2475
02:59:25,815 --> 02:59:26,156
[SPEAKER_18]: What's up?

2476
02:59:26,196 --> 02:59:26,776
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind?

2477
02:59:26,796 --> 02:59:27,756
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of tonight's show?

2478
02:59:27,796 --> 02:59:28,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Any comments on anything?

2479
02:59:28,717 --> 02:59:30,077
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it's really good, actually.

2480
02:59:31,177 --> 02:59:31,998
[SPEAKER_18]: When aren't we good?

2481
02:59:32,078 --> 02:59:32,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn, we're good.

2482
02:59:32,978 --> 02:59:33,978
[SPEAKER_28]: We are so hot.

2483
02:59:34,699 --> 02:59:37,640
[SPEAKER_18]: We could do TRL on Originals Radio.

2484
02:59:38,260 --> 02:59:38,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Indeed.

2485
02:59:39,460 --> 02:59:41,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if we would want to, but we could.

2486
02:59:42,642 --> 02:59:44,962
[SPEAKER_31]: What's better than real radio?

2487
02:59:45,943 --> 02:59:47,563
[SPEAKER_18]: How can I get multiple calls there?

2488
02:59:47,583 --> 02:59:48,064
[SPEAKER_18]: That was weird.

2489
02:59:49,815 --> 02:59:54,678
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to have to play with the settings myself on this, and everything's still in beta, so we'll figure it out.

2490
02:59:54,738 --> 02:59:55,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else you wanted to say?

2491
02:59:55,639 --> 02:59:56,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Any shout-outs?

2492
02:59:57,200 --> 03:00:03,885
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I would like to make a shout-out to Rich, EvilNaoki2DX, and all of the 2DX community here in Vegas.

2493
03:00:05,346 --> 03:00:05,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Vegas!

2494
03:00:05,926 --> 03:00:07,267
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got to go back to Vegas someday.

2495
03:00:07,607 --> 03:00:09,389
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, when are you coming to Vegas?

2496
03:00:09,569 --> 03:00:10,429
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss gambling.

2497
03:00:10,649 --> 03:00:11,970
[SPEAKER_30]: We need to see Mara and Chun.

2498
03:00:12,291 --> 03:00:14,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, there's a lot of folks that listen to Vegas.

2499
03:00:14,532 --> 03:00:15,373
[SPEAKER_18]: When are you guys coming to Vegas?

2500
03:00:15,393 --> 03:00:17,514
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to go to the Adult Entertainment Expo.

2501
03:00:18,095 --> 03:00:18,515
[SPEAKER_31]: Ha ha ha!

2502
03:00:19,537 --> 03:00:21,838
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'll be down there for Adult Entertainment Expo sometime.

2503
03:00:22,239 --> 03:00:25,941
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, but we won't be there for Classic Gaming Expo because they moved that to San Jose.

2504
03:00:26,821 --> 03:00:28,882
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, oh, I definitely want to go to Classic Gaming Expo this year.

2505
03:00:28,942 --> 03:00:29,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

2506
03:00:29,383 --> 03:00:29,683
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

2507
03:00:30,023 --> 03:00:31,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're going to have to let you go.

2508
03:00:31,264 --> 03:00:32,044
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what, though?

2509
03:00:32,204 --> 03:00:37,267
[SPEAKER_18]: I just realized that you sent me that story about the American Idol style thing they're doing.

2510
03:00:37,627 --> 03:00:38,708
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah, I sent you that.

2511
03:00:38,788 --> 03:00:40,449
[SPEAKER_18]: And I totally forgot to bring it up tonight.

2512
03:00:40,489 --> 03:00:42,110
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll send it to Jamie to talk about next week.

2513
03:00:42,190 --> 03:00:43,331
[SPEAKER_28]: By the way, it's already gone.

2514
03:00:44,111 --> 03:00:44,571
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, is it?

2515
03:00:45,472 --> 03:00:45,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

2516
03:00:45,872 --> 03:00:47,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Well... They don't have the links.

2517
03:00:47,373 --> 03:00:47,893
[SPEAKER_18]: That sucks.

2518
03:00:48,153 --> 03:00:49,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well, it was worth a try.

2519
03:00:51,189 --> 03:00:52,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, thanks for calling in, dude.

2520
03:00:52,812 --> 03:00:53,794
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, my pleasure.

2521
03:00:54,255 --> 03:00:54,635
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye.

2522
03:00:54,776 --> 03:00:55,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

2523
03:00:55,798 --> 03:00:57,380
[SPEAKER_18]: See, this is pretty cool now that we can take calls.

2524
03:00:57,841 --> 03:00:58,402
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm liking this.

2525
03:00:59,785 --> 03:01:00,927
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's it.

2526
03:01:00,967 --> 03:01:02,951
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have to go ahead and close the Skype line for tonight.

2527
03:01:05,236 --> 03:01:06,336
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still trying to implement this.

2528
03:01:06,356 --> 03:01:06,896
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm doing DarkSakura email.

2529
03:01:33,712 --> 03:01:34,172
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll see what happens.

2530
03:01:34,212 --> 03:01:35,193
[SPEAKER_31]: Just wanted to make a mention.

2531
03:02:00,106 --> 03:02:01,927
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I guess that's it.

2532
03:02:02,567 --> 03:02:03,007
[SPEAKER_18]: We're done.

2533
03:02:03,927 --> 03:02:04,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, final thoughts.

2534
03:02:05,188 --> 03:02:06,088
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, your final thought.

2535
03:02:11,550 --> 03:02:14,090
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is Skype line.

2536
03:02:14,731 --> 03:02:16,791
[SPEAKER_30]: That sounds so hot, Rob.

2537
03:02:17,812 --> 03:02:18,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki's not here.

2538
03:02:18,712 --> 03:02:20,192
[SPEAKER_30]: Loki's final thought is potty.

2539
03:02:20,412 --> 03:02:22,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Loki's final thought is potty.

2540
03:02:23,633 --> 03:02:26,694
[SPEAKER_18]: And the final word of the show, I guess I'll have to give it to Jamie.

2541
03:02:26,714 --> 03:02:27,775
[SPEAKER_18]: There's really no one else here.

2542
03:02:32,153 --> 03:02:35,134
[SPEAKER_21]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2543
03:02:35,694 --> 03:02:39,036
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2544
03:02:39,656 --> 03:02:44,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to make love to you.

2557
03:03:26,348 --> 03:03:28,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn, bitch, you stupid fly.

2558
03:03:28,749 --> 03:03:31,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me pull up to that bumper and smack that monkey.

2559
03:03:31,809 --> 03:03:33,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn bitch, you stupid fly.

2560
03:03:34,111 --> 03:03:36,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pull up to your bumper and smack that monkey.

2561
03:03:37,554 --> 03:03:38,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Greeting old friends.

2562
03:03:39,435 --> 03:03:40,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, sir.

2563
03:03:40,737 --> 03:03:42,098
[SPEAKER_05]: What up, dog?

2564
03:03:42,918 --> 03:03:44,440
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, dog?

2565
03:03:45,681 --> 03:03:46,982
[SPEAKER_00]: May I borrow some money?

2566
03:03:47,642 --> 03:03:48,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, let me hold some ends.

2567
03:03:49,024 --> 03:03:50,785

2571
03:03:57,691 --> 03:03:58,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks anyway.

2572
03:03:59,312 --> 03:04:00,053

03:04:05,707 --> 03:04:06,227
[SPEAKER_12]: What up?

2576
03:04:06,928 --> 03:04:07,388
[SPEAKER_00]: What up?

2577
03:04:08,749 --> 03:04:11,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I admire your fashionable running shoes.

2578
03:04:11,812 --> 03:04:15,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherfucker.

2579
03:04:15,875 --> 03:04:19,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherfucker.

2580
03:04:20,819 --> 03:04:23,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a stuck-up white boy faking the funk.

2581
03:04:23,821 --> 03:04:24,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Bump that.

2582
03:04:25,082 --> 03:04:30,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't bullshitting on Front Street no more thanks to the Wake Up Crew's Ebonics language lesson.

2583
03:04:32,236 --> 03:04:40,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Available in a hood near you Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2584
03:05:16,874 --> 03:05:17,735
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we're back.

2585
03:05:17,835 --> 03:05:19,715
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.

2586
03:05:19,775 --> 03:05:20,176
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is.

2587
03:05:20,216 --> 03:05:22,776
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the part after the credits have come and gone.

2588
03:05:22,797 --> 03:05:24,737
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.

2589
03:05:24,757 --> 03:05:26,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Some more of you guys want to play on that for a minute.

2590
03:05:26,658 --> 03:05:28,379
[SPEAKER_31]: Damn, bitch, you stupid cat.

2591
03:05:28,399 --> 03:05:30,499
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a great fortune cookie message.

2592
03:05:30,699 --> 03:05:33,861
[SPEAKER_31]: Dan had that a long time ago, and I finally bothered to get it.

2593
03:05:34,001 --> 03:05:35,381
[SPEAKER_31]: I played it on my show once.

2594
03:05:36,682 --> 03:05:37,082
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.

2595
03:05:37,302 --> 03:05:37,662
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.

2596
03:05:39,329 --> 03:05:40,370
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we set up voicemail on it?

2597
03:05:40,410 --> 03:05:40,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Possibly.

2598
03:05:41,130 --> 03:05:45,552
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would be cool if we could, because then we'd just leave it up all day and people could send us their FUs with voice.

2599
03:05:48,734 --> 03:05:49,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

2600
03:05:49,094 --> 03:05:50,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe that's something they're going to do in a little bit.

2601
03:05:50,955 --> 03:05:51,255
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2602
03:05:54,457 --> 03:05:59,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so, um... We'll see if we get any calls.

2603
03:06:00,941 --> 03:06:01,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody loves us.

2604
03:06:01,701 --> 03:06:04,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, we're going to put details up on the website of exactly how you can call the show.

2605
03:06:07,264 --> 03:06:08,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Da-da-da-da-da-da-da...

2606
03:06:09,617 --> 03:06:12,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, is there anything else you guys wanted to add?

2607
03:06:14,523 --> 03:06:15,484
[SPEAKER_29]: What up, dog?

2608
03:06:18,047 --> 03:06:21,751
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to find a computer case with, like, very specific specifications.

2609
03:06:21,831 --> 03:06:28,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I need... It has to be, like, about 13 to 14 inches wide and about 17 inches long.

2610
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:29,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Height is not a...

2611
03:06:31,471 --> 03:06:32,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

2612
03:06:52,552 --> 03:06:59,916
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need to install pretty much just, well, I don't know, I might be able to do it in a normal case.

2613
03:07:01,037 --> 03:07:15,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I need enough room to install the extra ports for, because there's, on a normal DDR machine you've got like, you know, your standard, like a JAMMA cable and four other smaller 5-pin cables that get plugged in there.

2614
03:07:15,425 --> 03:07:18,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it needs more than just the JAMMA stuff.

2615
03:07:18,888 --> 03:07:33,477
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need to add those extra ports onto the PC, and then I need to have, like, the, um, there's a monitor, um, what was it, like a video, uh, converter card or something, that small little, um, PC board that I need to get.

2616
03:07:34,057 --> 03:07:46,285
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need to have that all inside a case, and it's just kind of, um, well, it's kind of tough to get a case a whole, all that, without heavily modding one or having to make one, so...

2617
03:07:47,864 --> 03:07:49,604
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I don't know.

2618
03:07:52,665 --> 03:07:57,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was waiting for somebody to call, but I guess it's not going to happen.

2619
03:07:57,726 --> 03:07:58,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess not.

2620
03:07:59,006 --> 03:07:59,386
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2621
03:08:00,187 --> 03:08:00,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well.

2622
03:08:01,487 --> 03:08:02,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought somebody said they were going to call.

2623
03:08:03,307 --> 03:08:07,848
[SPEAKER_14]: There was that one chick, Misty, that said... Well, yeah, but I didn't think she had a mic.

2624
03:08:07,888 --> 03:08:08,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me see.

2625
03:08:10,609 --> 03:08:10,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

2626
03:08:11,466 --> 03:08:13,408
[SPEAKER_18]: The person who's going to call us is having technical problems.

2627
03:08:13,428 --> 03:08:14,849
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess we'll just have to try again next week.

2628
03:08:15,870 --> 03:08:17,111
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you everybody for listening.

2629
03:08:17,311 --> 03:08:18,772
[SPEAKER_18]: I went ahead and closed the Skype line for now.

2630
03:08:19,853 --> 03:08:23,777
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to do a post-show tonight of... I don't know what music I want to do.

2631
03:08:23,817 --> 03:08:29,461
[SPEAKER_18]: How about... I like those compilations that I've been downloading recently.

2632
03:08:29,501 --> 03:08:30,823
[SPEAKER_18]: The Ministry of Sound stuff.

2633
03:08:31,483 --> 03:08:33,745
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you've got a lot of that on your computer, but I like it too.

2634
03:08:34,225 --> 03:08:35,446
[SPEAKER_14]: We should listen to the whole...

2635
03:08:37,045 --> 03:08:40,526
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole V-Rare CD for DJ Damien.

2636
03:08:40,586 --> 03:08:41,106
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we shouldn't.

2637
03:08:42,786 --> 03:08:43,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2638
03:08:44,227 --> 03:08:46,147
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I was just looking at an Alienware site.

2639
03:08:46,167 --> 03:08:48,667
[SPEAKER_14]: They have, like, small, mid-sized business computers.

2640
03:08:48,908 --> 03:08:51,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Who the fuck would buy Alienware computers for business?

2641
03:08:52,228 --> 03:08:56,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can't even look professional with this little alien head on there and shit.

2671
03:18:36,041 --> 03:18:40,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm passing my faces that I hardly know I'll ever see.
