In the game, dream all, six or seven

Higher than higher I'm burning like a fire

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Funny death of sunlight shining in her hair

132
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
When she leaves, you want to follow

133
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Worry where the dress is too tight

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,840
But you can't let her see you there

135
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,840
And she's a hot one, a hell of a young

136
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Tula tenorita

137
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,840

138
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Tula tenorita

139
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:56,840
I know she has a mind, she has an attitude Attitude, she takes on a solid tune

140
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,840
She sees you, believes you, feeling good over you

141
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Like you knew she wouldn't when she smiles It's like the sun shining on your face

142
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Rolling and stretching the lemonade

143
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,840
It's in the hot water, has it been young?

144
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,840

We are live.

156
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
You made a promo and didn't tell me.

157
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
You know what was going on last night?

158
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
I was playing with this new software program

159
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
because I've been looking for stuff for...

160
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Is it a promo?

161
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
You want to hear it one more time?

162
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,240
Hold on.

163
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,320
Orange Lounge Radio,

Imani Music,

165
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,080
and more.

166
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, I know. Shut up, Loki.

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,680
At least I put some effort out. I was like, what the hell was that?

168
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,160
OMG WTFBBQ. Well, okay, I've been playing with some new toys for diversion because...

169
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,800
Well, okay, let's back this up a little bit.

170
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,520
Obviously, you might have heard I got a new kind of computer thing going on. I

171
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,500
I finally put in the stuff that Squeenix gave me at E3 when I won the Ballista thing, and

172
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,100
I put them in a couple weeks ago, and of course that's what caused the show to not be here

173
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,940
a couple weeks ago, but it's given me some time to play with some new things, install

174
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,660
some new software that didn't run good before, and one of them is this mixing program that

175
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,020
I was thinking about using for Diversion, because I thought it would be really cool

176
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,220
to have the Bamani Music remixes mixing together, I thought it would be pretty cool.

177
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,000
But unfortunately the software had problems of its own, but it sounds really, really good

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,080
if you have, like, these short, like, ten-second promos, like, stringing the music together.

179
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,400
So I made a bunch of, like, just, well, not a bunch, but, like, three quickie little promos.

180
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,040
Little bumpers. Little bumpers, exactly. Little bumpers. Mini

181
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,460
bumpers. Not really promos, but mini bumpers. But since the Buggy Baby... Shut up. Rubber

182
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:21,240
Baggy... Baggy Bomani Bumpers. I don't know. Uh, so, I'll play some more of those tonight,

183
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,560
because now I, that program fuckin' sucked, because after about 30 minutes and all my

184
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,760
my audio starts skipping, so I can't use it. So now I have those little rubber baby

185
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,600
bimani bumpers and nothing to use them for. So, I'll play them tonight, because everybody

186
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,040
bitches that we never have new promos. So, you get those.

187
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:46,520
Alright, so, I guess we have to start this episode off with a bit of an apology.

188
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:53,920
Sorry, we had lives. Okay. Hold on, I'm finding some apology music here.

189
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,680
Cuz as you may or may not know, this is our first show. When was episode 101? I would have to get out a calendar to look...

190
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,240
What?

191
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,880
The 18th?

192
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,800
I can't find that song that quick.

193
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,040
Yeah, it was before my birthday. I remember that much.

194
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,960
What was it? No.

195
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,420
Yeah, it was the week before my birthday, so it would have been like the 18th or something, so gosh, we've got a lot of ground to cover.

196
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,340
But um...

197
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,640
Okay, so we're gonna play some apology music here. I'm just looking for it.

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,440
this is some nice little gothy apology music

199
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,060
dear listeners of orange lounge radio

200
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,200
we offer our condolences

201
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,680
and jamie's hairball

202
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,120
for not being live for the past two weeks

203
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,520
jamie offers her special condolences for not being here for the past three weeks

204
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,720
she's missed you all dearly

205
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
but my aim is improving

206
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
And she coughs up this hairball, especially for you.

207
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,520
It tastes like tri-tip.

208
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,200
You see, what we decided to do two weeks ago was for you,

209
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,920
the listener, we decided to upgrade our boards and studios

210
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,840
so that we could have faster and better audio for those of you guys.

211
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,080
And plus, I would have much less headache running the show.

212
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,840
So we let our tech master, Loki, I'm going to blame it on him,

213
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
upgrade the computer.

214
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Blame it on Squenix.

215
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,960
Microsoft.

216
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Well actually, I can't really blame it on Microsoft because we were using piratey copy.

217
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Oh, nope, he meant a pirate's treasure that we found.

218
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,960
A photocopy.

219
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Yes, a photocopy.

220
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,960
So basically, we started to upgrade the computer around 1 noon, thinking we'd have plenty of time to do it.

221
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,960
And how many times did we have to install different versions of Windows XP?

222
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,760
about six it requires because see Rob's computer is what we like to call an

223
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,960
industry old and it it did not like anything that you did to it it was very

224
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,800
cranky and so I ended up having to take one of my older hard drives a nice 40

225
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,880
gig master hard drive and re-ins you know put that in there and format it god

226
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,760
knows what was on that I'm sick of apology music every battle so yeah we

227
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,600
We ended up reinstalling a new hard drive before it even take for some reason, I don't

228
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
know why.

229
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,280
But we finally got it installed after the show.

230
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,400
Finally the system came up about three hours after the show was over.

231
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,520
By that time, our buddy VX JasonXV, for those of you guys that were listening, he ended

232
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,820
up taking over our station because I forgot that he had access to get in there and fuck

233
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,440
with our station, but I thought it was cool that he went in there and did a live thing.

234
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
It was cute.

235
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
He didn't fuck with our station.

236
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,600
No, that wasn't two weeks ago. He fondled it. That was last week, not two weeks ago.

237
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,080
Last week was the 4th of July, and we just took it off because. Yeah, you guys have to

238
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:56,200
face this. We have a national holiday dedicated to fire, and we're going to be here doing

239
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,320
a show for you all? No, we're going to be out setting things on fire. Illegal fireworks.

240
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,960
For last week, you do not have our apology, you get fire. Our leftover fire from last

241
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,240
week. This is smoke and ashes. It was not our intention to be gone two weeks in a row,

242
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,280
so we apologize. We know you've missed us. That's the excuse. That's what's going on.

243
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:23,620
I make no excuses. I stand by my decisions, dammit. I take full responsibility and accountability

244
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,720
for what I did, unlike those who are coming up in the upcoming presidential elections.

245
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,040
Vote for me. Also...

246
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,560
Unstable Jelly, Red vs. Blue owns you. Go watch it.

247
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,360
uh... it and right now jamie likes to talk back to our chat room so if you

248
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,280
want to get any detention you cannot

249
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,240
if you think you've ever broadcast on its broadcast on the tv screen here in

250
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,040

w w w dot org launch radio dot com click on chat all the good stuff there and

252
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,400
there's all the chatting boys and girls in the chair room that's the only way

253
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,440
you can participate in a match if used

254
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,880
by the way my friends

255
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,120
someone brought up to me that there is a working mac emulator now for a pc that

256
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,000
i'm going to be getting from a computer

257
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,440
Wait a minute, you just said working and Mac in the same sentence.

258
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,160
I'm going to try it out.

259
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm going to try it out.

260
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,000
Just for curiosity. I'm just giving our listeners a little help.

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
This is going to be interesting news. Now that I've apologized for being gone for

262
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,840
the past two weeks, I have some interesting news to tell you all.

263
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,580
I'm not going to be here for the next two weeks. Bye!

264
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,880
So, this show will be solely in the hands of DarkSakur and Loki.

265
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,380
I, I, yeah, dear God save us all, I fear for you all, and my apologies, but, um, if you

266
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,820
want to pay my rent and my bills, then, uh, I will be here every week for you. Otherwise,

267
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,240
I need to remain my company's bitch and go to strange places they tell me to go to, which,

268
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,180
uh, for the next two weeks will involve the East Coast.

269
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,520
Bring me back something Eastern.

270
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,280
I, I, I don't know if I should say where. I don't want stalker fans to find me. I'm

271
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,680
I'm not going to say exactly where, but I'll give a hint.

272
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,840
I'll give you a hint.

273
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,120
It's one letter off from California in the state of abbreviation.

274
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,200
OK.

275
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,000
It's one letter off from California in the state of abbreviation.

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,680
That's way nerdy.

277
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,800
It's an hour away from where Queer As Folk is set.

278
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,760
There's a good hint.

279
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,440
So I won't be here in the next two weeks.

280
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,520
Sorry, boys and girls.

281
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,520
How many times are we going to do this show from my house?

282
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,520
This is my house. If you don't like it, get the fuck out.

283
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
That'll be the theme of the next two weeks.

284
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,520
As long as people don't decide to abandon me for Ron Jeremy like they did last time.

285
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,520
You need to put the smack down.

286
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,520
No, this time I'll be abandoned for Mame.

287
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:56,520
I'll do what I can. If there's something I can do to help from millions of miles away, I will.

288
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,800
will. Actually, this is still all up in the air, because basically, I got told that I'm

289
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,880
taking this trip Friday, and I'll be leaving a week from today. So, everything's very last

290
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,000
minute here, and I'm wondering if it'll actually happen. So I may be here next week, but not

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,880
bloody likely. When the man tells you you go, you go. So, that's all you can do. Alright.

292
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,400
Why does it always have to be the man? Why can't it be the woman to tell you to do something?

293
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,600
because in this case it was a man that told me I'm going. Well, fuck you. My boss is a

294
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,320
woman, but her boss is a man, so. Okay, well then I retract that. I heard some great woman

295
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,320
jokes over the weekend, you wanna hear some? Sure. Alright, um, how do you fix a woman's

296
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:52,720
watch? What? You don't need to, there's a clock on the oven. I would throw this can

297
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,480
you but I'm still drinking from it and this root beer I value more than that

298
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:10,080
joke I wouldn't want the house getting dirty anyway moving right along here at

299
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,660
Orange Lounge radio we're equal opportunity offenders by the way moving

300
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,800
right along we usually start the show off with doing a little bit of how was

301
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
your day how was your week but seeing us we've been gone for a little while I

302
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
I think we're going to do some how was your day, how was your month.

303
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,800
So, Jamie, how was your day, how was your month?

304
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,800
My day was pretty good actually.

305
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,800
I woke up at 8.30 in the morning after having gone to bed around 4 a.m.

306
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,800
and I decided that, well today, Julie and I were going to go running.

307
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
So we went and we left, you know, on time.

308
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,800
For the first time, Julie was on time getting to my house.

309
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,100
We got out, we got to ARC, and it was all roped off.

310
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,340
ARC, by the way, is American River College for those people who don't know.

311
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,360
And so we're like, okay, so we'll go over to CSUS.

312
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,940
Forgot the Olympic trials were going on.

313
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,460
That's closed off, too.

314
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,260
Right here in Sacramento, we got the Olympians.

315
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,140
So I went to, we saw a limo there, I wanted to egg it, but anyway, so we went to Sac

316
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,060
City, forgetting that the track there was a stadium and all closed off because of whatever

317
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,220
zoning law or whatever. So we ended up running at Natomas High School. Now, Natomas High

318
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:31,380
School is really nice. It's a very new school, lots of amenities. One would think the track

319
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,940
would be paved. No, it's not. And with it being as hot as it was by the time we got

320
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,980
there, like around noon. Actually, no, it wasn't around noon, it was around 11, but

321
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,100
It was still fairly hot outside.

322
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
There was wind blowing.

323
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,700
The thing is that wind plus dirt equals dirt in your face.

324
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,700
So to clarify, you don't rely on DDR for your exercise.

325
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,980
You get out there on the track and run, on the dirt track.

326
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,220
Well, I'm trying to...

327
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,700
I have to get where I can run two miles.

328
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:12,800
So right now, what the plan was is walk the first lap to warm up and then run, walk two

329
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,360
more and then walk another and run walk two more and walk another until I can

330
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,760
get to where I can do the whole thing running the straight way walking the

331
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,620
curve and keep doing it like that because a friend of mine who ran track

332
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,380
told me that that's how they trained so I was like okay I'll do that I actually

333
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:38,700
made it a full mile doing the walk run I didn't stop and did my first lap walking

334
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,780
in my last lap walking actually I did another half of that lap do on a run

335
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:48,380
So I made it pretty well. I'm hoping that by the end of the month. I can actually at least run a mile

336
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,540
Or at least run two laps without feeling like my heart wants to explode I can breathe just fine though

337
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,380
No asthma. That's another thing about my my month

338
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,140
Starting what happened? I think it was the week before

339
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,620
Renfaire I'm

340
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,620
Thinking is either the one before or after

341
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,900
I had a pulmonary exam done to see if I to prove I didn't have asthma and

342
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:17,980
I don't have asthma. The way that one of the charts reads is that it has a scale of

343
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,960
one to ten and when you take in your first breath it goes up and then it pans

344
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:31,940
off as you exhale and six for the inhale part of that is about mid-average lung

345
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,100
capacity and I hit an eight out of ten so I apparently have really awesome

346
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,300
some fantastic lungs and so I'm all good and I don't have to you know keep the

347
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,860
inhaler anymore all it all it took was just losing some weight and so I've been

348
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,700
good with that and the Ren Faire was really fun I was in the chat room though

349
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,980
on that for that show because I was like just dead tired after the fair but they

350
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,380
didn't have mead anywhere I was pissed off and my bodice was too big so I

351
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,100
didn't have quite the you know lusty wench effect although some guy asked me

352
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,380
to pick up something off of the ground so that he could stare down my cleavage

353
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:14,780
so I took it as a compliment no I didn't I told him to pay me he didn't there was

354
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:22,300
this cute business adorable little kid there who was in like the ultimate um I

355
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,380
can't think of the word now he was in like sackcloth it was great just running

356
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,820
around in sackcloth the whole time he looked like he was having a good time

357
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,860
sackcloth burlap whatever I mean but I'm trying to think of the actual term the

358
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:44,700
peasant now is it and there was let's see what else

359
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,340
fourth of July was okay I was actually sick all day I was sick

360
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:57,900
practically all the weekend dope but I went to a barbecue at the home of some

361
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:06,460
friends of mine and Dan who are Atkinsing. So there's lots of meat everywhere. Meat everywhere.

362
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,260
No potato salad. Although someone did bring potato salad, but I didn't touch it.

363
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,060
They had sparklers there, but they had the old ones that are metal.

364
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,020
So those were fun. I was setting them on fire. You can't ever find those kind anymore.

365
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,460
was setting them on fire the whole night I was just all happy because I had fire

366
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:36,180
and I've been training somebody at work and I basically told that uh that I'm

367
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,980
gonna be sort of like I guess like the mentor from now on for a lot of people

368
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,380
for the new hires who come in so I was like I don't know what to think about

369
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:52,380
that because I like doing it you know I like passing on what I know and I like

370
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,860
the teaching aspect but sometimes I want my cubicle to myself you know that's

371
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:03,940
like my space it's your domain you want to be the master of your domain so but

372
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,420
other than that I mean it's it's really cool it's just been an interesting week

373
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:16,600
I missed my brother. My brother was in Alabama on the fourth weekend and I wanted to have

374
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,700
the money to go see him but I'm flat broke right now. Oh, what else did I do? I enrolled

375
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:29,820
in school. I'm going back to college. I'm going into database management and so I need

376
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,620
a laptop so that I can do my homework wherever I happen to be because half of my classes

377
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,460
are online. I decided to get a class that I'm not looking forward to out of the way

378
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,980
like right off the bat. I'm taking Business Law and I'm just going to take that one in

379
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,060
the classroom. I don't care. I want it out of the way. But they're making me take all

380
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:57,180
of the stupid prerequisites that I could test out of if I was able to miswork for it. But

381
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,620
I figure it's going to be an easy A and a good buffer against that Business Law class.

382
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,900
So I'm having to take like Intro to Windows and beginning

383
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,380
word processing and beginning Excel.

384
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,580
And next semester I'm taking like Access.

385
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,460
It's probably going to be around summer when I'm going

386
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,900
to have to start taking the crappy programming classes.

387
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,540
So that also is going to affect when I pump up the

388
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,780
volume is, because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.

389
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:34,920
I get out of class like at 6.45, but because it's also going to break into my gym time

390
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:41,380
on Wednesdays, I'm thinking about moving the show to another night in the week, or maybe

391
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:49,940
do two shows late night, because Monday, I figure if I move the show, then I'll start

392
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,580
running on Monday and Wednesday and do spin on Friday.

393
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,260
You can always have Tuesday back if you want.

394
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Okay.

395
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
That should be easiest.

396
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
And we can use the old promo again!

397
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,260
Yay!

398
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
Yay!

399
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Okay.

400
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,260
See, that works out for everybody.

401
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
That does work out.

402
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
You let me know when you want to do that.

403
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
I'm going to be gone for two weeks, so...

404
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
And then after I get back from my little work trip,

405
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,260
I should have an announcement on what's going to happen with Vanilla Sky.

406
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Why don't I just start it this week?

407
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Yeah, we'll figure something out.

408
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
That's fine.

409
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
I'll start doing it on Tuesdays.

410
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
Yeah, okay.

411
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
We can shuffle it around, yeah.

412
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
All right.

413
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
I'll do it two nights in a row.

414
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
I don't care.

415
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,260
Sure.

416
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,260
Yeah, okay.

417
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,260
I'll just go live all week.

418
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,260
Fun! Alright, yeah, the Jamie experience. We'll figure it out.

419
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
Everyone's going to get so sick of me.

420
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,260
We'll make an official announcement on the website when we figure out the scheduling stuff.

421
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,260
Oh, and the last bit of news. I have meat, and meat makes me happy.

422
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,260
Congratulations.

423
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Okay, I'm done.

424
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,260
All done? Alright. Um, Lucky, do you have anything you want to share? How was your week?

425
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,260
I'm sorry, how was your month? How was your day?

426
00:26:51,260 --> 00:27:02,260
Um, I played Final Fantasy, I burned things, I got, um, my hard drive loader working, I played Driver 3, um...

427
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,260
Huh?

428
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,260
I forgot to mention something, so I'm gonna have Rob mention it for me.

429
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Okay. Anyways, I saw Spider-Man 2. I saw, um, Fahrenheit 9-11 twice. I saw, um... I don't know, some other movie. But, um, I don't know, not much that really happened. What do I say every week? Nothing happened during the week. Multiply that times four, that was my month. You know? Or, you know, two weeks since half a month, I guess.

430
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:50,600
My fiancee, Nellie, who's been on the show a few times, she got a job at my work doing

431
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:57,100
a mailer room and she loves it, and I'm trying to think of what else I did.

432
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,440
Oh, today I put together the PC that's going to go in the cabinet that's been sitting here

433
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,800
for months, just collecting dust, so it will be functional soon.

434
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:17,480
So possibly the webcam will come back. Hooray. And then, um, what else? Um, there's other

435
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,640
things but I'll mention them later. I'm sure. Yeah. Oh, and once again the EX2 machine doesn't

436
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,920
work but I didn't have anything to do with that one. So, yeah.

437
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,680
Alright, my week and my month and my day.

438
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,640
You guys missed, I think, I don't think I, I think this happened after we were off air

439
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,460
for a little while, but I had the hiccups for like three days in a row.

440
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,620
That was really scary, because I thought like I was going to die or something.

441
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,460
I mean, seriously, like, I don't know if you've ever had hiccups, but usually they last, what,

442
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,740
like a half hour at the most.

443
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,420
I had it on and off for like 90 minute intervals for three days.

444
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,900
It was horrid.

445
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,660
So I finally had to go to the doctor, and I swear to God, my doctor was going to laugh

446
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,820
at me. Like, you got the hiccups? You coming in here because you got hiccups? Like, it's

447
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,860
been three days! It's not normal! I've got brain cancer! Because I went on to WebMD.com,

448
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,900
I swear to God, if you go on WebMD, and you type in like, hiccups, like reoccurring, it'll

449
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,080
tell you like, oh you might have brain cancer, you better go get checked out. It's not a

450
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,080
I went to the doctor and I'm like, Doctor, I think I have brain cancer. Why? Because I have hiccups.

451
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Oh God, what else happened besides that? Oh yeah, my birthday happened. God, that was a while now.

452
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Happy birthday, Rod!

453
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Thank you. Some of my friends threw me a surprise party, which was really cute.

454
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,080
And my cake said, Happy Birthday, Dr. Dick, which was really cute.

455
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,760
Yes, and I got this. I got the answer to the ferret here. I got this new little toy here.

456
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,160
What's this guy's name? Does he have a name? Uh, it's Trash Talkers, and this guy's name...

457
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Oh my God, I love...

458
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Marshall!

459
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I left your present at home.

460
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,160
And Marshall... Oh, that's not good. Marshall is this guy and he's wearing a lavender shirt

461
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,400
and lavender pants with a little rainbow flag on it. And let's see some of the things that

462
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Marshall has to say.

463
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,640
Ah, shit. You have to whack him in the head to get him to say something.

464
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:20,640
It's only kinky the first time! Come on! Oh my god! It's humongous! I can't fit all that in my mouth!

465
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
You can barely hear it.

466
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
I don't think our listeners can hear it at all.

467
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
That's great.

468
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
So that's my answer to the ferret.

469
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
So whenever you start up with a ferret...

470
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
Oh, there, I think his speaker's in the front here.

471
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
It's only kinky the first time.

472
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
It's only kinky the first time.

473
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
All right, anyway.

474
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Someone's done something in my purse.

475
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,640
So, uh, what else?

476
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I don't think I've played a single game of DDR.

477
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
No, I take that back.

478
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,280
hanging out with Navi, our pop music whore, I was hanging out with him on

479
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Friday and I beat a 31 on pop music that made me so happy like on the arcade

480
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,120
controller so I was all jazzed I know some of you out there are better but

481
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,960
don't hate I'm getting better but we actually played DDR like on an ignition

482
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,760
pad and everything we were playing DDR extreme at home and it was so great

483
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,880
because like I was still doing like really well and I also got DDR for my

484
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,520
Xbox those of you that were listening to episode 101 heard the confession that I

485
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,840
I bought an Xbox, and I've been playing DDR on Live a little bit, and I gotta say it's

486
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,440
very interesting to play DDR on Xbox Live, because people can talk on the microphones

487
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,640
and stuff, and I don't have a dance pad for Xbox, so I play with a controller, and man

488
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,960
do people on there hate on controller players, I don't care, I mean they can see I'm on a

489
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,640
controller when I join their game, if they don't like it, kick me.

490
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
I don't care.

491
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,920
You need to play Phantasy Star with me.

492
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,200
That's extra money.

493
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
That's more money.

494
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
any MMORPGs I'm playing?

495
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
PSO is nine dollars.

496
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
We'll see. Yeah, okay, so then I'd be on PSO.

497
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
And then they forget to charge you.

498
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
I'd be on PSO, then I'd be on Ragnarok,

499
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
cause Jamie found this free server

500
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
No, I didn't find it, Marintan found it.

501
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Oh sorry, Marintan found this free server that we've all been playing Ragnarok on now.

502
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
With the 60...

503
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
With the 60...

504
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
With the 60...

505
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah, 60 times experience

506
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
and like 30 times drops

507
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Yeah, something like that, it's crazy.

508
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,400
So, we've got that, the free Ragnarok server, and now, okay, Final Fantasy XI, when I reinstalled

509
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,280
everything for the computer, it broke. It was fucked up, my graphics were flickering,

510
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,000
it was screwed up beyond belief, and I was never going to be able to play Final Fantasy

511
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,360
XI again. Last night, it finally got fixed. Finally got fixed last night because the way

512
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,680
to fix it, I had to install some drivers that are two years old for my card, and now it

513
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,560
works. So, now I'm back on there. So that would be three MMORPGs that I'm wasting my

514
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,460
time with. I bitch enough about how I don't have enough time to play, like, real console

515
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,840
games. Like, I've been trying to play Mega Man collection, barely have any time. I finally

516
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,260
have sat down with Silent Hill 2, and I'm only about halfway through that, because I'm

517
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:03,460
so... I have video game ADD is basically what it boils down to. I sit down... This is especially

518
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,760
bad when I have emulation. I play a game for, like, literally, like, ten seconds, and then

519
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
I'm done with it, and I want to do another game.

520
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
So, yes, Jamie?

521
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,760
I just want to answer Angel's question real quick.

522
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,760
If you go on to, and this is sort of, I'm not meaning to plug my own stuff here, but

523
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,760
if you go to roleplay.darksacra.com, look in the Ragnarok online folder, you'll see

524
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,760
an announcement there posted regarding playing the free Ragnarok server.

525
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Anyway.

526
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Woo!

527
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,400
Yeah, so that was pretty much my week and my day or my month and my day really so

528
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,920
Did you play any Bahmani at all through this whole month Jamie? I did

529
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:53,460
And I'll be damned if I can remember what it was. I played some pop and music when we had the first dorama night

530
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,340
and

531
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,460
I played DDR. Did you? Amazing. Kamerick was in town

532
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,660
mm-hmm and

533
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,660
And we went to Fry's, and I played TDR at Fry's.

534
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Awesome.

535
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:23,660
I also bought, because it just came out a couple weeks ago, I bought the You Got Served, Taken to the Streets DVD, which is the instructional videos on how to do all the choreography, and I thought that was sweet.

536
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:23,660
Funny.

537
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:32,660
I haven't watched it yet, but I like the, uh, I actually bought, I was also probably one of the only people on the face of the earth that bought Darren's Dance Crews. I have that DVD also.

538
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:43,660
Just in case if I ever one these days decide, you know, I feel like getting in shape and doing freestyle. Just in case, if that dark day ever comes. I'll be ready.

539
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:51,540
Okay. All right. I think we're going to take a break, and then we're going to come back

540
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,260
and we're going to do some real Bhavani news, because we do have, we missed a lot of news

541
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,580
stories while we were gone, our little bit of downtime, so we're going to talk about

542
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:05,220
some of that. So we're going to take a break, and Jamie requested a Gradius break, so we're

543
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
going to do that.

544
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,580
That makes me go squeak.

545
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,340
So what is a Gradius break, Jamie?

546
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:15,740
Well, I guess it's not just Gradius, but it's of all of the games featuring the Vic Viper, I guess.

547
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,240
Oh, okay.

548
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,440
Sensation is from the second stage of Life Force, Salamander 2.

549
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,840
And Burning Heat was, of course, the first stage of Gradius 2.

550
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,540
And then the Gradius Full Option mix, which was all of the music from the first Gradius.

551
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,340
Alright, so we're going to do these songs, and then we'll do some...

552
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Chad was requesting some pop-in music, so we'll do that in a later break.

553
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,340
And, um, okay, some actual Bomani news when we come back.

554
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
We'll be back!

555
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,340
The

556
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,340
the

557
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,340
the

558
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,340
the

559
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,340
the

560
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,340
the

561
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,340
the

562
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:33,020
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

563
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,020
Nooooooo!

564
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,260
Just kidding.

565
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,820
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani Radio.

566
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,940
We are back live, Orange Lounge Radio episode 102 in progress.

567
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:52,080
Some folks out there tell me there might be a little bit of skipping going on with some of the stuff

568
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,420
we're playing.

569
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,220
We're using a new

570
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,380
encoder program tonight. It's actually not new, it's the one we used to use like a long

571
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,460
time ago between episodes like one and sixty.

572
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,420
but they updated it so it does the MP3 Pro thing now. If you guys don't hear us in stereo,

573
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:12,220
all you got to do is download the MP3 Pro codec and you'll hear us in stereo. But I

574
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,700
guess maybe it's causing things to skip a little bit if I do too much in the background,

575
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
so hmm.

576
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,820
It's not everyone that's getting it though.

577
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:26,700
Yeah, I don't know. Weird. We'll see. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. I don't know. Yeah,

578
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,000
I know. My computer is like now it's a 3.2 gigahertz machine now. I would think it has

579
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,680
enough juice in there to handle everything and not make things skip, but I don't know.

580
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,060
Technology amazes me some days. I don't know. We'll see. I can always try the new video

581
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,620
card. I think it has to do with when I have too much video going on. We'll see. We'll

582
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:51,100
see. We are back, Orange Lounge Radio. I wanted to talk about some stuff that's been going

583
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,940
on in the Bomani news scene while we've been gone for the past three weeks. First off,

584
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,880
this story kind of came out not too long after we had our last show

585
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,720
uh...

586
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,780
you probably all heard about this but we haven't had a chance to make fun of it

587
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,560
yet so i'm bringing it up again

588
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,640
uh... this

589
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,700
girl uh... i'm sure you've heard

590
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,840
but she had a heart attack or something like that while playing ddr

591
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,260
now that's a short story now really what it is

592
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,960
is that that's kind of what the media

593
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
says in all these headlines that

594
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,300
Oh my god, girl almost died playing DDR.

595
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,400
DDR kills teen.

596
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,340
Did they bring up that it was a pre-existing condition?

597
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,140
Of course not.

598
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,420
But here's the headline.

599
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,260
Heart condition strikes girl down in an arcade.

600
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,820
Now see, that's not so bad.

601
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,060
But then if you go on to GameSpot or something,

602
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,460
GameSpot's headline was something

603
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,660
like, girl gets heart problem while playing

604
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,740
DDR, something like that.

605
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,260
It's kind of like, it sort of infers

606
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,780
that DDR caused the problem.

607
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,060
DDR did not cause the problem.

608
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,300
You know, if she had been out running,

609
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,180
the same damn thing would have happened.

610
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,380
If she had been rollerblading, the same thing would have happened.

611
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,320
If she had been masturbating, the same thing would have happened.

612
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,220
I have heard of that, okay?

613
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,100
How's that for climax?

614
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,860
It's heart-stopping. Oh my god, I'm dead.

615
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,940
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

616
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,700
Stop it! Stop it!

617
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,940
God, I just came in my eye!

618
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,860
Uh, yeah.

619
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:31,860
If she had been eating a donut, that would have happened.

620
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,840
It's alright, it's alright.

621
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,880
Uh, let's listen to this lovely news story brought to us by the Omaha Channel

622
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,780
dot com. And hopefully you guys don't get a lot of skipping, but uh, let's

623
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:48,780
let's hear what happened to our friend here in uh... oma

624
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,820
outside the bellevue arcade has been up for nearly one week

625
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,940
get well soon kimber

626
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,260
fifteen-year-old is doing just that

627
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,840
i don't remember too much

628
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,800
yes loki

629
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,800
She's all, ooh yeah, donut. Stop it. Stop it.

630
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,680
You are very rude, Mr. Loki.

631
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,720
Alright, moving on.

632
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,720
...willson's hat last Tuesday explained to her several times.

633
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,140
Is that a midget playing DDR on the right side? It looks like a midget.

634
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,820
That's Tyler Gurden.

635
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,820
You know she was playing this game, Dance Dance Revolution, at the arcade with a friend.

636
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,820
She then fell to the floor.

637
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:50,820
Okay, well see she was playing I Do, I Do, I Do. That's what happened is that she heard that song and she was like,

638
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,820
Ah Christ, this song sucks. I'm gonna die.

639
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:02,820
We're being really horrible, you guys. Okay, we're not trying to be mean, but we accomplished, what, yes.

640
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,820
She played the song Broken My Heart.

641
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:17,820
That joke, oh give me a break, that joke is so used. That was like the first freaking thing he heard on every message board. First thing on every message board.

642
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,820
Oh god, what a crappy song!

643
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
I do, I do, I do.

644
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,820
I don't, I don't, I don't.

645
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,820
Let's see, let's continue with the news story here.

646
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:41,820
The arcade owners gave Kimber CPR, a police officer took over for them, and paramedics shocked Kimber several times with a defibrillator to get her heart working again.

647
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:45,820
Now how many times do you get to hear the word defibrillator in the news, huh?

648
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,820
That's such an awesome word.

649
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,820
Defibrillator. I challenge all of our listeners to use the word defibrillator in a sentence today.

650
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:57,820
Why don't you shove a defibrillator up your ass?

651
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,320
Because keep in mind that the media is typically too tight after

652
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,940
Well, I'm sorry nothing, okay hypertrophy cardiomyopathy

653
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,700
Yeah, I'll say that three times fast

654
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,820
Hydro wait, let's see if it hydrotrophy cardiomyopathy

655
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:20,160
I totally fucked that up. I know it totally sounds made up water. This is real

656
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,580
This is a real if you could have this and you could get this

657
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:27,580
No, he probably doesn't have it, and you probably can't catch it.

658
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,580
Moving on.

659
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,580
The walls around her heart are so thick, her heart wasn't getting the signals to beat.

660
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:41,580
You could be asleep, you could be walking, running, sitting down to eat, and it could hit you.

661
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,580
Sitting down to eat, it could hit you.

662
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,580
You know, it could have been that she's like,

663
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,580
Mungo needs food!

664
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,260
A translation for Spaceboy, who I guess is one of our new listeners?

665
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:55,760
Sure.

666
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,960
It's the paddle thing that they put on you and make it clear.

667
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,100
The question is, what is a defibrillator?

668
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,920
What is a defibrillator? Yes, if you ever watch like ER or something and you hear them go clear

669
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,700
and then they put those paddles on somebody and it goes

670
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,500
and then the body like bounces, that's a defibrillator.

671
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,020
I want to see someone that doesn't clear when that happens.

672
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,460
I want them to like be like, you're gonna be okay!

673
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,620
And then just get thrown back. That'd be great.

674
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,820
Defibrillators have always been...

675
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:27,820
Defibrillator has always been comedy gold, um, in movies like Naked Gun and stuff like

676
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,820
that, so, anyway, moving on.

677
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,340
I'm gonna bring you some comic books that Kimber's parents are just glad it hit her

678
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,340
when it did.

679
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:40,020
I mean, she was in the right place with all the right people around her.

680
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,700
I would just like to point something out there, though.

681
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,700
The mother says, what's so damn funny, Jamie?

682
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:54,460
The mother says, in this story, the mother says she was at the right place with all the

683
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,460
people needed around there to help her.

684
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,500
DDR almost kills a teen.

685
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,180
It murdered a teenager because she was playing a bad song and her heart just stopped.

686
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,860
DDR is bad for people.

687
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:10,220
Yet the mother says she was in the right place at the right time with all the right people

688
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,220
around her.

689
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:19,780
The truth is, they don't really want their daughter and they are hoping that she would

690
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,040
die so they can collect the insert- That is mean!

691
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
That is just mean!

692
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
First off- Rude!

693
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,040
So rude!

694
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,040
How old was she?

695
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,040
15.

696
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,500
First and foremost, her parents should have been doing their god damn job, okay?

697
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,500
They knew she had- Well now-

698
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,260
Now listen, they knew she had a heart condition, right?

699
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,060
No, I don't think they did.

700
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,060
Really?

701
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,060
I don't think so.

702
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,060
They don't say. You know, interestingly enough, they don't say, but I'm going to assume...

703
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,060
I heard that it was a known pre-existing condition.

704
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:53,060
Well, you know, people are going to say things in this situation.

705
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,060
Well, it's not even so. My question is, well...

706
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,060
You don't catch heart disease from playing DDR.

707
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,060
It's because there's something wrong with you, okay?

708
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,060
You have a condition.

709
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,060
I am almost positive. To be honest, I'm almost positive they did not know beforehand

710
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,940
beforehand because of the next part of this little article.

711
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,540
Kimber now has a pacemaker and will be on medication for the rest of her life, but she

712
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,880
should be out of the hospital soon, in fact hanging out with her friends and going to

713
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,320
the arcade.

714
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,320
So she's now on medication and she now has a pacemaker.

715
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,300
I'm assuming if they knew about the condition before they would have given her the pacemaker

716
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,300
before.

717
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:37,120
And the thing is that that's still not something that playing a game of DDR is going to cause.

718
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,560
And who is the maker of this pacemaker? Konami. I smell conspiracy.

719
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Konami doesn't make pacemakers. How do you know? It's Black Ops Konami.

720
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,260
Well they make casino games and a lot of people didn't know that, I mean.

721
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:59,800
Nintendo makes pachinko machines. They make pachinko machines, they could very

722
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,800
well make pacemakers. I might try the Dance Dance Revolution, but

723
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,840
thinking no yes this girl will be playing para para paradise for the rest

724
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:14,680
of her life God help everybody yes she'll be switching to pump it up

725
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:20,440
switching to techno motion her parents wanted to thank all of the people who

726
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,680
helped to revive her including the arcade owners the police officer and the

727
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,240
paramedics all of those rescuers have been checking up on her in the hospital

728
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,000
the heart problem is genetic yeah that's what we're told in fact her mother got

729
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,880
checked and has a mild form of it and the rest of the family is getting

730
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,560
checked out too. A simple echocardiogram can usually detect the disease.

731
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,640
Interesting, so it sounds like they didn't know about it because the mom's

732
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,400
getting checked now, they're all getting checked.

733
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,760
They're having this electrocardiogram to figure out who's got the heart condition.

734
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,920
But see, that shows right there. That right there

735
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,400
is proof that the doctors themselves don't think DDR did it, which of course

736
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,520
they're going to be smarter than them,

737
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,280
and checking it as a genetic condition.

738
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,680
What would happen if this story was

739
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,120
that girl gets heart attack from playing grand theft auto

740
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,240
that would be great i mean

741
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:14,240
the bullets are so real it struck my heart

742
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,360
alright that's the end of the story

743
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,040
i'm really

744
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,560
what if that poor girl is listening to us what if that poor girl is an orange lounge radio fan

745
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,080
and here we are making fun of her plight

746
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,000
making fun of the stupid people who don't understand it.

747
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Alright.

748
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,760
Just remember that Loki is an equal opportunity offender and we love everybody equally.

749
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,040
I just was laughing at something that DD Archaholic said in there that, you know, about the warning

750
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,360
because it's in Japanese.

751
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:53,320
The high intensity warning that's in Japanese.

752
00:52:53,320 --> 00:53:00,320
I'm so glad that the microphone can't pick Loki up right now, I am so glad.

753
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,400
I guess that's that for that story. Anything else you want to say about the girl with the

754
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,720
heart thing?

755
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,960
Please people,

756
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,900
if you think

757
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,360
if your heart kind of tingles sometimes,

758
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,120
or you think your heart might,

759
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,380
there's something non-normal about your heart, like you feel it

760
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:23,440
you know tingling a lot and you suddenly can't feel your arm someday

761
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,360
tingle not tinkle

762
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,520
if your heart tingles you've got a whole other problem okay

763
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,760
but if your heart's like tingling a little bit or your hand hurts or you know you

764
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,000
find that you're losing

765
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,240
uh... feeling in your leg when you're playing DDR

766
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,560
please go see a doctor okay if i can go to my doctor because i think i have the

767
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,300
hiccups for too long

768
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,960
you can go to your doctor because you might have a heart condition get that

769
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,600
little electrocardiogram

770
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,040
And please keep DDR out of the news for this kind of crap.

771
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,600
If the rest of your body is thick,

772
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,800
then you're probably your heart's going to be thick too.

773
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,320
My head is just large, as a bug said, unlike Loki's head.

774
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,120
One day, Loki, you are going to get

775
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,520
smited down from the heavens above

776
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,880
with some horrible, horrific story.

777
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,000
And everybody you've ever made fun of in the past

778
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:24,640
is going to be there to make fun of you. Whoo! Oh my God! Oh wait, that's ironic. No, I

779
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,560
keep telling people I'm going to die an ironic death. It'll be funny. Don't worry. I just

780
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,860
want to... I'll drown on an airplane or something. This is my disclaimer, that for everybody

781
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:40,760
who thinks that DDR was... You know, her playing DDR contributed to an aggravation of that

782
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:45,360
condition. But for anyone who thinks that DDR caused the condition, I'm laughing at

783
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,760
you and pointing my finger.

784
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,360
But it did. It's Devil Devil Revolution.

785
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,360
I hit Rob instead.

786
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,360
Give me my computer.

787
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:04,560
Alright. You guys are so insensitive. We should call ourselves Orange Lounge Insensitive Radio

788
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,960
because that's, that's what we are, you guys. Man.

789
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,960
Don't play DDR if you are 500 pounds and can't feel your arm.

790
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,320
No, play DDR. Please.

791
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:22,320
Yes, Loki. If you throw your arm, that's just gonna be disturbing.

792
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,960
I really don't know where to take the show from here. What?

793
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,440
Did her falling down and having a heart attack cause vibrations that disturb the

794
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,200
neighbors?

795
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,240
Just stop it. Just stop. Wait, wait, wait. Was she really overweight?

796
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,760
yes well I don't know it's got well I didn't see

797
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,680
she looked she looked healthy

798
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,680
did she pass her song?

799
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,360
did she perfect attack it? did she pass her song?

800
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,360
god damn

801
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:58,680
how many misses?

802
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:04,560
she was she was a shape that a lot of people are okay she's just

803
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:21,560
Everybody, no, I wouldn't say that. She didn't look, she didn't look to the point where it was, like, morbid, okay? She just looked healthy. Like, you know, she just, God. I'm gonna get letters from this.

804
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:30,560
I wish we never do get hate mail. We never do get hate mail. Yeah, I know. Moving on. I have chat rooms going, moving on! I agree, moving on.

805
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:45,560
This week we get a brand new Bomani game. I know we haven't talked about it a whole lot on this show, but, uh, Karaoke Revolution 2 is still slated to come out July 13th. So, uh, Jamie, there's something you can do while I'm gone.

806
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:52,560
Not just no, but hell no. I don't think. I was in band for a reason.

807
00:56:52,560 --> 00:57:01,440
season? If you look at the box art, it's interesting because it's red instead of blue, and it's

808
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,680
got all new songs in it, some new modes. We've talked about it enough before on this show,

809
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:12,760
but it is coming out relatively soon. Hopefully you got your pre-orders in. If you didn't,

810
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,640
well, yeah, you're not supporting Konami, and we won't have any more DDR ever again

811
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,960
thanks to you

812
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,460
moving on

813
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,700
also uh...

814
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,420
so we know character evolution to is coming out we still have extreme on the

815
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,240
way

816
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,120
we still have uh... do you also makes two on the way but what's going on in

817
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,180
japan

818
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,520
we haven't heard a whole lot about what's going blissful news yes beautiful

819
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,580
blissful news from japan we haven't heard of

820
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:45,080
no setup i'd quite the opposite loki we did get an announcement that eight style

821
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,080
is, in fact, on the way.

822
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,080
Airdstyle will be coming to the home.

823
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,580
You're talking about releasing more Guitar Freaks, also, I thought.

824
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,080
No, more Guitar Freaks.

825
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,580
I think that's just people starting rumors.

826
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,080
Would make me happy, but it's not going to happen.

827
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,580
Well, I thought that because it did so well,

828
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,580
they were going to look into their other games.

829
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,080
If they do, sign me up,

830
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,580
because I need more Guitarodile at home.

831
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:17,820
Yes, so basically their website says something to this effect, because 7th Style did better

832
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,360
than they thought it would do, they are going to go ahead and make an 8th style, and thank

833
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,660
you to all of you that helped make Konami Style a purchase to continue supporting the

834
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,660
project.

835
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:33,140
Details will be on the 2DX website, official website, konamistyle.com, and in the Konami

836
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:38,700
Style newsletter, you just have to wait, keep on helping them out and continuing the production

837
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,500
of BeatMania 2DX sequels. So it sounds like they might keep going, even after 8th style,

838
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,180
if 8th style does well. The question is, are we going to have to do any petitions this

839
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,900
time, or are we going to have to do any, you know, um...

840
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,060
God, I hope not. God, I hope not too. That was stupid. You remember, I went off on Konami

841
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,780
style on this show previously for having to make us do all those stupid questionnaires

842
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:03,660
and everything? Either make the game, or don't! Quit making us have to work. You're the ones

843
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:10,980
making money off it, you do the work. We're not going to fill out no damn petition. Geez.

844
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,500
Alright. You know what's funny is I still never did

845
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:19,620
buy Seven Style. I said I would buy Seven Style, but because my controller kind of sucks,

846
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:23,340
I haven't bothered with Seven Style. And now I'm like, I'm all about popin' music now.

847
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:29,500
I'm like, I need to get a popin' music arcade style, and da da da da da. We'll see. We'll

848
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:35,740
we'll see what happens. So hopefully 8 style does well too, and then we'll see a 9th style

849
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,500
in the future, but let's take it one step at a time, boys and girls. So we'll hopefully

850
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:50,220
see, hopefully we will see 8 style at the end of the year, but nothing confirmed yet.

851
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:55,260
Alright, let's see, do we want to do the cage match? Actually, let's go to a break, because

852
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:01,220
there's still more news stories I want to talk about before we come back. In this break,

853
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:08,060
I guess since we heard about 8 style, we'll play something from 2DX8 style. We'll play

854
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,960
this song. I like this one. And then we had a request from some pop music, so we'll work

855
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:18,340
that in there too. Some random pop music song. And when we come back, some more news and

856
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:24,060
all your favorite stuff, Orange Launch Radio, Cage Match on the way, FUs on the way, and

857
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:31,060
more exciting news. Yes. Yes, Jamie. Yes? Yes. Yes. All right. We'll be back.

858
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:34,060
I don't want to go back to the place where I was born

859
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:44,060
I don't want to go back to the place where I was born

860
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:19,080
dot com

861
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,900
welcome back to warren's laundry and i just don't propel all over now the

862
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,760
courts tangle in my chair and

863
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,600
everything's breaking rob well i'll take this moment to answer john field

864
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,420
sure i'm i want uh...

865
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:34,080
this time from and today because i've been looking for forever and my single

866
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,480
uh... but uh... sort of stepped on by somebody

867
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:43,320
ouch

868
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:51,320
Since some of you guys didn't seem to know those songs in the break, the songs in that

869
01:06:51,320 --> 01:07:00,520
break from 2DX8 style, Love is Orange by Orange Lounge, Yamato, Space Worship Yamato by Sousasaki

870
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:06,720
from Popin' Music 7, and then in Popin' Music 7 as well, we played a song by a group called

871
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:12,040
Komo Tomok, the genre is lonely in the song, Artemis.

872
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,700
So I know a lot of you guys may not be as familiar with the pop music songs.

873
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:20,300
So we'll play a few more for you guys tonight just because we can.

874
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,300
You are back...

875
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,500
I need you to pick up that soundtrack they have, though, of the Auto-Malo 1 and 2.

876
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,500
Oh yeah?

877
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,540
I came really close to it, it's really awesome.

878
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,540
Cool.

879
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,540
Alright.

880
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,420
We were talking about some Bahmani news before we went to the break, we were talking about

881
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,180
the girl who had the heart attack playing DDR, even though that was, well, it wasn't

882
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:41,540
really a heart attack, whatever it was, that was a couple weeks ago.

883
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:45,860
But as you may or may not know, we've been off the air for about three weeks.

884
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,940
Because of problems out of our control, but we're back.

885
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,940
You know what?

886
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,940
It's like a national holiday.

887
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:55,020
Real shows go off the air for like two months, and you still watch them.

888
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:00,220
So I don't think a two week break is too much to ask, people.

889
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:04,420
Anyway, I thought this was interesting, and I know Loki wants to talk about this.

890
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:08,140
You found something interesting on eBay this week, didn't you?

891
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,540
Yes, we have.

892
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:20,140
the same people behind the wonderful bootleg ddr megamix are back at it again with, for

893
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:27,980
those who don't know what ddr megamix is, my bad! God! I'm thinking I forget these things.

894
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:33,340
Now, ddr megamix is this really shitty bootleg that came out that basically was supposed

895
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:38,300
to have the songs from 4th, 5th and Xtreme in all in one cabinet, which would be pretty

896
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:43,220
cool. But no, all it was was DDR Extreme with really shitty graphics and glitched out shit

897
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:49,580
and the wonderful warning screen don't fall off with two giant Star Wars AT-STs in there.

898
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:55,900
So, um, that was really lame. So this new one now has come out and is being distributed

899
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:00,320
by some guy on the internet and it's also the same guy that's behind Megamix as I said

900
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:05,340
before. Now what's new about this is one, there's actual graphics, it's not like fucked

901
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:12,020
up graphics as before. There's actual, like, new graphics, which, stupid, who cares? And

902
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:19,840
the ability to speed up tempo of a song up to 20%, which is pretty lame. So it's Dance

903
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:27,180
Dance Revolution Extreme Plus with, yeah, just really shitty stuff. And they're selling

904
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:35,060
for $650. And there is the link in the chatroom. I love this ad. I just posted the link in

905
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:40,400
the chat room there. It has this running theme going through the game, and that is like torso

906
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:46,160
shots. And look at this, the logo, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus, is just the shot

907
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:52,760
of a boob, basically. It's the logo. Look at that. It's just a boob. That's the marquee.

908
01:09:52,760 --> 01:10:02,260
It's a boob. And then, oh sorry, it's a breast. It's a breast. And then you have that same

909
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:06,220
breast for light mode and then there's beginner mode which has a man breast

910
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:10,700
very nice man breast I must say and then on the heavy mode I don't know what the

911
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:16,940
fuck that is then you have like a god like Trinity for the matrix it's the

912
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,500
hermaphrodite

913
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:26,460
also let me read this ad for you guys because it's hilarious let me I will

914
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:31,540
read this my announcer voice here dad stands revolution extreme plus is

915
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:36,900
available now this is the latest upgrade for the DDR all new graphics with an

916
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:40,780
incredible speed upgrade we asked the players what they wanted and they said

917
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:48,020
speed it up speed it up speed it up so we did earnings results up by 40% is

918
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:51,860
that what everybody was saying speed it up speed it up speed it up I think they

919
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,820
were saying get rid of it faster no I think they were saying give us new songs

920
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:05,820
songs. Give us a new mix, new mix, new mix. Not crappy bootlegs, crappy bootlegs. I love

921
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:11,700
this, how you can bring up the screen and then you can speed up the song by 20%. There's

922
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:17,860
a little problem though with it. A few things that just didn't quite work out. Number one,

923
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:24,620
there is no heavy mode. There's beginner, light, standard. Heavy is only selectable

924
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:30,360
on, you know, the song select screen. Number two, if you speed up the song save by 20 percent,

925
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,180
okay, you're done with your game. Guess what? If the person doesn't set it back down to

926
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:40,280
normal, they're still on 20 percent. It just stays that way. It's really stupid. That should

927
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:47,020
be max 300 really fun. Yeah, actually there's an arcade already in Australia that has this

928
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:51,240
and they said, you know, it's not that bad. It's actually kind of fun to play the sped

929
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,340
up songs, but it's just a novelty, I think. You know, if they, see what I thought when

930
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:01,260
I first heard about DDR Extreme Plus, I thought it was, oh, someone's, you know, selling the

931
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:06,340
hacked version of DDR Extreme with the extra modifiers on it. See, now that's what I would

932
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,940
have done. If you're gonna hack it like this, you know, put those extra modifiers on there

933
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:14,580
as well. Here, I'm gonna simulate for you guys what this would sound like, okay? So

934
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,020
So here's a fast song already, all right, Waka Waka.

935
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,060
Oops, sorry, let me play this for you guys.

936
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,340
Okay, now let's see what it sounds like

937
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,020
if we were to up the volume, up the speed by 20%.

938
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,340
Now you know how hard this song is already, right?

939
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,180
Okay, here we go.

940
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:42,460
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

941
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:47,460
I would die trying to play this. This would give me a heart failure, okay?

942
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:52,460
They would have to get the defibrillators out for me on this crap.

943
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:58,460
It made the song sound a little better, though.

944
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:02,460
See, now... Alright.

945
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:06,460
This is really stupid. Arcade owners are actually...

946
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:10,460
The people that bought Megamix are ready to snatch this up for another $650.

947
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:16,460
That's how much Megamix was. $650 to get a really shitty version of DDR Extreme with crap graphics.

948
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:21,460
Arcade owners actually paid this, so there's obviously money in this.

949
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:25,460
And, now this is distributed through a company called Dakota Games.

950
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:32,460
Dakota Games is also known for another, um, hack that's Daytona CRX.

951
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:37,460
Which is, um, basically Daytona with Super Off-Road added to it.

952
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:48,460
Basically, it's the ability, which is kinda cool, it's the ability to, like, save profiles and you upgrade car parts and stuff to make your cars have more speed, more traction, etc.

953
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,460
Now that's a cool feature, it adds, you know, stuff to the game.

954
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:56,460
Now this, while it being a really shitty hack, it does add features to it, so...

955
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:07,460
It's a really, I wouldn't go spend $650 on it, but hey, whatever. I mean, at least it's not like Megamix, but it is still crap.

956
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:17,460
It's getting better though. They're starting to learn. They actually did something I didn't think, you know, of. So, more power to them, I guess.

957
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:24,660
I don't know what to think about this whole, like, we're going to do the tempo change and

958
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:28,100
change the game here. I think it would have been cool if they had to slow it down by 20%

959
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:33,820
mode. That would have been cool. Oh, now I've got to try it again to see what slowed down

960
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:44,340
20% would sound like. Yes, I do. You know you want to hear it. Jamie, what do you think

961
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:49,580
this would you ever play this game or is this just utter crap to you or what? I have two

962
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:58,020
words for this. Hell no. Why not? Because it's just stupid. If I want to play DDR, I

963
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:04,460
would go play like, you know, like Max 2 or Xtreme. I'd like to add that, you know the

964
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:09,780
arcade chain Tilt that's in, you know, arcades around malls throughout the United States?

965
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:14,780
We've upgraded all their machines to Megamix, so I guess we're going to upgrade to next.

966
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,780
Yeah, that's right.

967
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:21,780
Well, I knew there was a reason I don't go there. Also because it's in Florida Mall.

968
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,780
Yeah.

969
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:26,780
Let's see what Wakka-Lakka would sound like if they had a slow down feature.

970
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,780
Now maybe more of you could pass the song this way.

971
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,780
So here we go, we know the normal way.

972
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,780
If I can get it to play.

973
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,780
Okay.

974
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:40,780
Okay, now let's see what it'll be down 20%.

975
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,900
Now I can beat it!

976
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,780
Duh, duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh.

977
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:53,780
This is like training mode, kind of.

978
01:15:53,780 --> 01:16:00,780
I can't stand this song now.

979
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,740
J. Ramen the Demon.

980
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:10,740
See, we knew there was something to that Devil Devil Revolution thing going on.

981
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,740
Uh, Chat Room is letting you know that somebody who says they worked for Tilt

982
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:18,420
said they did not upgrade ALL the machines.

983
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,100
Well that still doesn't matter, you upgraded some of them, that still makes you stupid.

984
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:29,100
The tilt in my town of Berth was bought out by Namco, thank God, so it doesn't suck.

985
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,420
Alright.

986
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:58,260
Other news going on here, Mel B was in our chat room earlier, one of our buddies from

987
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:02,420
ddrspot.com, and he wanted us to share some information with you guys, or, well, you know,

988
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:05,820
he was telling us some stuff, and I said I'd pass it along.

989
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:11,340
I know ddrspot hasn't posted a lot of articles lately, but he did say this week, sometime

990
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:16,180
early in the week, they are going to post an interview with Akira Yumoka.

991
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,820
So that should be a very good read.

992
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:23,020
So check ddrspot.com the next couple days and wait for that.

993
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:30,100
Also, he's looking for, they scored an interview, DDR Spot also scored an interview with Naoki.

994
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,500
They're going to be doing an interview with Naoki in the next few days.

995
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:37,740
They are still looking to field questions, so Mel has said his email box is open to you

996
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:41,220
guys if you want to send him some questions.

997
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:45,400
I know this is ironic because the interview is for DDR Spot, but if you want to send Mel

998
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:49,640
an email. If you have a question for Naoki, Mel will consider all your questions. He won't

999
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,360
ask everything because if everybody sends a question, that interview is going to be

1000
01:17:52,360 --> 01:18:02,080
an hour long. But he'll consider all your stuff. Mel at DDRFreak.com is his email. So,

1001
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:07,640
just send that along if you have a question you would like to ask Naoki. Such as, you

1002
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:15,200
want some fashion tips? Who does his hair? Naoki Eye for the straight guy. How deep in

1003
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:27,800
the Punani, are you? Okay. See, the questions I want to ask, Mel isn't going to ask. I want

1004
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:36,960
to know if he ever really has boiktopolitary or if it's a purely professional relationship.

1005
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,640
I would love to have Nokia. I would give a lot of head to get any Bimani celebrity on

1006
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:48,880
the show, because then that means we've made it. That's a good idea. You know, we were

1007
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:55,320
supposed to have an interview with, you know, Jason Enos from Konami, but in typical Orange

1008
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:59,680
Lounge fashion, that all got fucked up. Yeah, and I missed my chance to go hang out with

1009
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:04,200
the man, thank you. Which is too bad, because it was, honestly guys, I hate to say this,

1010
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,840
it was a great interview, because Loki fucking asked, I can't believe you had the balls to

1011
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,520
to do this. Loki fucking asked him about Into the Groove, okay?

1012
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,360
They had a very good answer. He had a very good answer, and I wish I could

1013
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:20,480
remember it. It was using it to encourage the community

1014
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,480
to keep growing. Yeah. Something like that.

1015
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:32,020
It was something like that. He basically was welcoming the challenge, basically, which

1016
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:36,280
I thought was very professional. He's a good guy. I'm sad about what happened

1017
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:40,980
to the interview but

1018
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,340
yeah what he told us off air was hilarious no just kidding

1019
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:46,700
we thank him for taking the time to do the interview with us even though it

1020
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,220
never aired because uh...

1021
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:51,500
mistakes happen

1022
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:55,460
bad mistakes happen

1023
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,460
we could have brought back portal

1024
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:00,980
that's very true

1025
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:07,980
we could have merged with g_-four okay that that could have been what happened

1026
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:14,440
i wouldn't mind taka and taku naked in the same room

1027
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,940
in response to uh...

1028
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,960
jason in the chat room

1029
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:23,960
while uh... jamie lives out her fantasy over there perhaps... I'm not living out any fantasy

1030
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,320
you have another news story you wanna talk about or?

1031
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,180
okay fine logie

1032
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:35,180
Because I'm not quite on, you know, the pulse of all the new music games that come out,

1033
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:42,180
this one kind of slipped under my radar. It's a game called I Can Boogie, okay?

1034
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:49,180
Say that one more time, Loki. You're an ass, okay? It's called I Can Boogie, okay?

1035
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:55,180
It's basically, if you were to take Itoy Groove, put it in an arcade cabinet that looks something like Pump It Up,

1036
01:20:55,180 --> 01:21:11,180
So that's what you've got. And it looks pretty cool. We just got it down at one of our arcades in the Century 14 in Roseville, down near Sacramento. We got one of these things. I have yet to play it, but it sounds really cool. It looks kind of neat.

1037
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:17,180
It's got actual music from, you know, artists, no covers or anything, you know, hot stuff from Donna Summers.

1038
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:26,180
It's got, uh, what is it, um, something like Jan Jackson on there and, like, some other stuff.

1039
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,180
It's pretty good, though.

1040
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:34,180
Um, it just looks interesting because it uses a camera just like, you know, Itoygroove.

1041
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:39,180
So, if you've got one of these by you, because I also heard there's one at Dave & Buster's in Milpitas.

1042
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:46,420
you got one by you should check it out. So, yeah, that was all I had. And you can find

1043
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:53,380
that at, I believe, ikengroove.com. But you actually haven't gotten a chance to play this

1044
01:21:53,380 --> 01:22:04,420
yet. No, not yet. Not yet. All right. So they basically turned Itoy Groove into an arcade

1045
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:09,600
game. Somebody stole that idea and turned it into an arcade game. Interesting. Itoygroove,

1046
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,720
I wasn't that thrilled with Itoygroove. Like, it was cool for a day and then that was it.

1047
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:19,560
Like, I don't know, I don't know why that game just didn't do it for me. But, the thing

1048
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,900
is with this arcade game, it's like a cross between Itoygroove and Para Para. That's pretty

1049
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:29,580
much what it is. Because it's, I think, there's five points, like five sensors spots that

1050
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:34,780
that you have to hit, you know, depending on how the arrows come. And they've got, you

1051
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:40,340
know, pretty interesting stuff on there. That was, oh, that was the other thing, since someone

1052
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:45,820
mentioned DDR Karaoke Mix. There's actually one of those very, very, very rare arcade

1053
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:55,060
games being sold on Yahoo Auctions for $1600 at Karaoke Revolution Second Mix, or not Karaoke

1054
01:22:55,060 --> 01:23:00,840
revolution DDR karaoke mix second mix which I thought that was pretty sweet if

1055
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:06,360
I had that kind of no cash I would buy one but I don't so I already know what I

1056
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:12,920
want to get for my house my second mix upstream oh yeah you get the 2d x

1057
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,160
machine too that's what I want awesome but I probably you have the only one in

1058
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:22,640
the u.s. I think that's my well we said right off the bat when we buy our house

1059
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:28,420
We're getting a DDR machine, and I'm about I'm thinking of trying to get that in the I want to get an actual

1060
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:36,520
Second you know second style build a substream machine. You know the old style monitor and everything I know

1061
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:41,120
Yeah, if I can I doubt it would be that expensive for that particular machine

1062
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,120
Well good luck to you

1063
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:49,000
Alright, you guys want to have yourselves a cage match. We haven't had that one of these in a while. It feels like

1064
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Alright, there's going to be kind of a small twist in tonight's cage match.

1065
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:02,000
The twist in tonight's cage match is that we are cleaning the slate and we're not going to carry a winner over from the show three weeks ago

1066
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
because basically it's won for like three weeks now by default.

1067
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So we are wiping the slate clean and we're starting off with three brand new songs tonight in tonight's cage match.

1068
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,000
So, the way the cage match works, each host brings one song to the table.

1069
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
And we're going to play these songs, and then you're going to vote on your favorite in the chat room,

1070
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:28,000
and your song that you pick as your favorite will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

1071
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Bimani Music and More program, with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.

1072
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
That'll include the Cage Match winner from tonight. We'll go into rotation.

1073
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
And then it'll come back next week to compete again against two challengers.

1074
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
So, we get a clean slate tonight, so that means we're going to hear three new songs in full.

1075
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Cage Match kind of used to have this theme of songs that would be good for Bamani, like GDR2DX, but now it's kind of evolved into cool stuff, but looking at tonight's lineup, I'd say we're kind of going back to our roots here.

1076
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,000
All three of these songs look to be songs that will be made for Bamani, so this should be a fun Cage Match tonight.

1077
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
This is not mine.

1078
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So make sure you are in, well, I'm just looking at your artists and knowing their music.

1079
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:17,000
If you want to vote, remember you have to be in our chat room, orangelaungeradio.com, click on chat, and then you'll be able to place a vote.

1080
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:26,000
So here we go! First up tonight is Loki, and he's actually the one who won three weeks ago, but we couldn't even remember what song it was, so we're giving him a new song tonight.

1081
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
What song are you putting in the cage match tonight?

1082
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Well, I've put this artist in a few times now, and since they have a new song that's going to be in DDR Extreme, I thought, hey, let's take a song from another game, Need for Speed Underground.

1083
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And this is also featured in Tourney Mix 5, if anyone really gives a damn about that.

1084
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:53,000
But this is BT featuring Wildside with... I think it's Wildside or Wildstyle.

1085
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Okay, something... Wildside is the Irresistive Among band from Extreme, so I don't think it's that.

1086
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:07,800
It might be wild style, I think. Anyways, it's BT featuring wild style, um, and this is Kimo Sabe.

1087
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,800
Alright, here it is.

1088
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,800
That was in frequency.

1089
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,800
What's in frequency? Well, okay.

1090
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,800
It's either in frequency or amplitude, too.

1091
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,800
Well, here it is. Enjoy it. BT, Kimo Sabe, song number one.

1092
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:53,800
The whole Stone Stone foundation plus the planet with more control

1093
01:26:53,800 --> 01:27:00,800
The circle starts to form B-boys and B-girls start to swarm

1094
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,800
Especially from the beginning of the night you know

1095
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,800
Cause they like the song the hype is on

1096
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,800
What we came to do is uplift you Shift the whole party and straighten it

1097
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,800
You jump up to the ground in the front front to reach this is for the street

1098
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,300
Come on!

1099
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:11,800

1100
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,300

1101

1102

1103

49

1156
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,800
Trying to build up a mind-typical, cutting even, divinical, unidentical

1157
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,800
Which America's stereotype is typical

1158
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,800
That expectation was visible, make money residual

1159
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,800
Without fame, used physically

1160
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
We'll resurrect the Earth from Earth and push the dead

1161
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
Spread the bottle, cross the globe like they was down to scratch

1162
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,800
That's what we need, my mobility

1163
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,800
With the millennium, get it?

1164
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,800
And then when Jack steps out of perfect venom

1165
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,800
I'm venom, venom, I'm venom

1166
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,800
Buh-duh-buh-buh, creativity

1167
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,800
Buh-duh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh

1168
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,500
Well, now rock's a utility

1169
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,700
No soul foundation plus no plan to the neighbors

1170
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,800
More creative control to perfect

1171
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,300
Montana-Jackson, full effect

1172
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,300
Use the pull, I'm the effect

1173
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,800
That means you're never control the pack

1174
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,800
I'm a circle, stars are born

1175
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,800
Chillin' people's every girl star to swarm

1176
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,800
I'm all special from the getting of the night tomorrow

1177
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:18,800
Cause a light is the spark

1178
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,800
The light is the spark

1179
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,300
Come on

1180
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,800
Before he falls on the floor

1181
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,300
Before he falls on the floor

1182
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,300
Full Effect

1183
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,300
Full Effect

1184
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,300
Brothers caught in a lot and I wishin' they was like on top of the world

1185
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,300
Realize they were calm and refer to hip-hop as a girl

1186
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,300
Cause back in junior class my cats had bumped the tour

1187
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,300
Remember to face well cause I wish they met a sooner

1188
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,300
Fortunately I stepped two and it had to be a dope strategy

1189
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,300
She was leavin' to an academy

1190
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,300
Can I have your digits? I'm travelin' it's hard to get at me

1191
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,300
What's your major by the way? Modular Activity

1192
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,300
I slap, I trap, energy, backflip, I'm on abstract captivity

1193
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,300
When I rock creativity

1194
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,300
I bust positive vibes from the west to Maui

1195
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,300
Lupek is the antidote created in Cali

1196
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:26,340
Alrighty, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, BT with Kimo Sabe.

1197
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:30,060
is a part of the show where we go Simon Cowell on all these songs and we give

1198
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,880
our opinion but our opinion doesn't count it's your votes to do but we want

1199
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:43,360
to help you make that vote. Jamie. I like BT, it gets an 8. I just heard that song a whole lot.

1200
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:49,740
All right. Logie. It's my favorite song in tourney mix 5, so it gets a 10.

1201
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:55,260
Interesting um to be honest I'm just that BT just doesn't do it for me like

1202
01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:15,260
kostjamrh It's not gay enough, I think that's what it is.

1203
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:21,900
wild side i got excited but no it was wild child all right uh moving on song number two in tonight's

1204
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:27,020
cage mesh comes to us from jamie and i gotta say i'm a little bit surprised at her pick but let's

1205
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:34,140
let's see what's up my song has the power of cord behind it it's uh tracy lord let's say something

1206
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:39,820
i okay this is the thing is i went on a big downloading speed trying to find this one tracy

1207
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:44,540
Lord's song it's and if anyone knows what this is please tell me I'm in the

1208
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:48,360
chat room right now 7 a.m. it's one about this woman getting revenge on a

1209
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:56,620
cowboy it's I've not fallen angel it's not fallen angel I have a remix of a

1210
01:32:56,620 --> 01:33:07,460
Tracy Lord song done by Pollock and fold I heard I heard the song like when I was

1211
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:12,820
in college the first time that was like in 95 and the CD was about a year old

1212
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:17,060
then so if that helps anybody find the song for me but anyway this particular

1213
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:21,700
one this one is like it definitely has the power of porn behind it because this

1214
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:27,020
is like a song that someone would participate in nocturnal activities to

1215
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:34,060
oh my nocturnal activities all right let's hear it then

1216
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:41,180
song number two in tonight's cage match Tracy Lord say something enjoy

1217
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:31,060
It's summer up in a small cave

1218
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:49,820
I can see it all before me Here it comes now, it means nothing

1219
01:34:49,820 --> 01:35:00,820
Just take some space, just take some space How did you know I am only here among us?

1220
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:19,820
How did you know I am only here among us?

1221
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:32,820
Oh

1222
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:04,820
Some are ashamed of me

1223
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:13,820
I can see you fall before me

1224
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:17,820
Oh, please

1225
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,820
How did you know me?

1226
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:23,820
How did you know me?

1227
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:28,820
How did you know I am only here, mama

1228
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:33,120
Say something

1229
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:42,520
How did you know I am only here and I'm not going to say something?

1230
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:52,120
How did you know I am only here and I'm not going to say something?

1231
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:58,020
How did you know I am only here and I'm not going to say something?

1232
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:56,300
Song number two was right there. It was Tracy Lord's with Say Something. Say something about

1233
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:59,300
What about that song, Jamie?

1234
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:02,300
I like that song.

1235
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,300
I mean, I'm going to give it an 8. She's done better.

1236
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:08,300
Apparently she sucks live.

1237
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:14,300
Imagine that! Porn star-given music career who can't really sing without a studio.

1238
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:18,300
Dan said that he went to some show that was going on that had Moby and a bunch of people.

1239
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,300
This was a few years ago.

1240
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:25,300
He said that Moby got naked and tried scratching women.

1241
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:50,060
p0k3smot42o

1242
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,060
T.J. Control.

1243
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:56,060
Um, yeah, that's definitely a song to fuck to.

1244
01:38:56,060 --> 01:39:03,060
Um, I don't know if I could imagine it on our station regularly, but, um, it's unique.

1245
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:05,060
And it did get me a little horny. Just a little bit.

1246
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:07,060
Just kidding, just kidding.

1247
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:11,060
Because I was looking at that magazine you're looking at. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1248
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,060
Okay, there's your music line.

1249
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:15,060
You're listening to KTMi.

1250
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:20,060
I'm kidding. It was interesting. I give it like a seven and a half.

1251
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:22,060
Because Tracey Lords is pretty cool.

1252
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:29,060
I don't get the slow comparison though. They're both slow songs, but Kylie's way different.

1253
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:33,060
Anyway, so there you have it. Your votes count though, not ours.

1254
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,060
There is one more song you get to vote for, possibly, if you want to.

1255
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:43,060
And that's my pick. My pick is an artist that you've actually already heard on our station

1256
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:47,240
heard on our station because she was on a Dance Mania album and she used to be

1257
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,860
with a group you might have heard of them you know the spice girls you ever

1258
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:58,840
heard of the spice girls laughing that's right well sporty spice has a solo

1259
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,880
career believe it or not and she has some big dance hits I I too like Jamie

1260
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,820
went on a downloading spree this week and I was downloading all these British

1261
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:09,700
dance compilations and this song turned up all one of them and I kind of liked

1262
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:14,620
it so I'm gonna put in a nice cage match it's Melanie C and the song is yeah

1263
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:19,900
yeah yeah and it's the Shanghai surprise remix wasn't that the movie with Madonna

1264
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:27,220
and Sean Penn from like years ago Shanghai surprise I assure you this song

1265
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:31,440
is way better than the movie at least I think so all right the rest of you I

1266
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:39,060
don't care what you think but we'll see hopefully you'll like it the chat room

1267
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,060
the listeners don't even know what you're doing over there.

1268
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,060
I know, I'm not going to say any of this.

1269
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,060
You shouldn't, alright.

1270
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,060
Um, oh, here comes Loki.

1271
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:49,060
She's looking at Playgirl!

1272
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:52,060
Ewww!

1273
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:54,060
Okay, anyways.

1274
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,060
Stop ruining the cage match!

1275
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:58,060

Yet I'll never show Expect me not to disappear

1282
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:01,060
hands Yeah, yeah, yeah, get so inefficient

1283
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:04,560
Yeah, so inefficient, it's our decision

1284
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,060
We're gonna have a good time

1285
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:19,060
Oh, when there's pain in you

1286
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,060

Feel the energy tonight

1289
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,060
Treating the blues

1290
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:40,060
I feel it standing around

1291
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,060
Yeah, yeah

1292
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:44,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1293
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:46,060
I'm on a mission

1294
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:48,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1295
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:50,060
If you're with me raise your hand

1296
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1297
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:54,060
Got no intervention

1298
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:59,060
We're gonna have a good time, yeah, yeah, yeah

1299
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:03,060
Got a new religion, yeah, yeah, yeah

Gotta take me to the film, yeah, yeah, yeah

1301
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:10,060
Other expectations, we've got a vacation

1302
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,060
We're gonna have a good time

1303
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:20,060
Can't have a good time

1304
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:29,060
I've got desire

1305
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:33,060
I've been inspired

1306
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:36,060
I want so much higher

1307
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:40,060
Baby, I don't wanna come down

1308
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:44,060
All I want is to be excited

1309
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:47,060
So come on and get united

1310
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:52,060
No more needing to fight it

1311
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:55,060
If you're there, raise your hand, come on, raise your hand

1312
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:59,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on a mission

1313
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:03,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you're with me, raise your hand

1314
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:06,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so inefficient

1315
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:08,120
It's just a few decisions

1316
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,480
We're gonna have a good time

1317
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1318
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:13,960
Got a new religion

1319
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1320
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,460
Gotta take me where I am

1321
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1322
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,000
Got the expectation

1323
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,680
The clarification

1324
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,040
We're gonna have a good time

1325
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1326
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:28,380
I'm on a mission

1327
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1328
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,180
If you're with me raise your hands

1329
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:33,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1330
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:35,580
Got the inhibitions

1331
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:40,580
If something's dead, you're gonna have a good time

1332
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:55,940
Alrighty, song number three tonight, Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

1333
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:56,940
What did you think?

1334
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:57,940
Yeah Yeah Yeah?

1335
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:58,940
Or, oh, hell no.

1336
01:44:58,940 --> 01:44:59,940
Jamie?

1337
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:00,940
It gets a yeah.

1338
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:05,540
I mean, it could, don't get me wrong, it's just kind of generic, you know?

1339
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:10,340
So it gets a six, seven-ish, seven-ish.

1340
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:13,560
from janey lucky

1341
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:16,420
i've heard this summer before i don't know if it's another artist

1342
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:17,940
on the right

1343
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:20,220
but i don't like the flight

1344
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,320
i don't like melissa

1345
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,100
living there didn't is

1346
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:26,180
you'd pictures

1347
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:27,660
so uh...

1348
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:32,780
yeah i give it a yeah yeah yeah five

1349
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,580
i don't know to me that's on it

1350
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,800
itself reddish

1351
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:39,360
and it is like a song i would hear to soccer games seriously

1352
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:46,360
uh... and that still fits forty-five outside football

1353
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:51,360
uh... so i could hear that uh... so i give it like a

1354
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,920
i think i'll be fun to be here

1355
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,800
and i do it in part of it again lately

1356
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,000
all right now let's review of the uh... three songs before i open up the voting

1357
01:45:59,000 --> 01:45:59,760
lines

1358
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,240
here we go a review of the three times before tonight

1359
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,680
because it is up to you

1360
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:11,680
song number one BT featuring wild child Kimo Sabe

1361
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:21,800
song number two tonight Tracy Lords with Say Something

1362
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:27,300
If you hear them on my face, I'll say

1363
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:33,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so inefficient

1364
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:51,840
Just send Skye a message in the chatroom with your vote.

1365
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:58,040
Winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1366
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:01,880
Meanwhile, back to some of the news we missed the three weeks we were out.

1367
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:07,880
You know, another article that came out while we were gone was on the Fox News Channel.

1368
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:12,160
Fox News Channel, you guys know Fox News Channel? Home of the Bill O'Reilly show and all those

1369
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,760
fun conservative talk programs?

1370
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,760
If I didn't watch TV.

1371
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:16,760
Okay, well, I know you don't watch TV.

1372
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:17,760
I think I know, though.

1373
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,240
They're giving CNN a little bit of a run, because they have some talk programs that

1374
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:25,520
people for some reason like, but whatever, I won't hate right now. But actually they

1375
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:33,000
ran an article about DDR and a weight loss article. It's again another, isn't DDR great

1376
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,560
because people lost weight playing it, but this article quotes some friends of the show.

1377
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:44,280
Some buddies of Orange Launch Radio were quoted in this article and Mel B and Sharks Girl

1378
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:48,140
were both quoted in this article which I thought was cool. Yeah, so good for them. There's

1379
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:53,000
a link to it over there on a website. I'll kind of summarize for you guys. It's just

1380
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:59,400
kind of talking about how it breaks down how to play DDR, how DDR is played. Says the assistant

1381
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,360
editor at Wired magazine, you're literally controlling the game with your whole body

1382
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:06,940
and not just your fingertips. It's definitely a new genre that will probably get bigger.

1383
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:13,420
That will probably. It might get a little bigger.

1384
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:16,440
It might. Assuming it doesn't kill off its players with

1385
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:19,440
heart attack

1386
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,600
uh...

1387
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,960
uh... relatively new genre i don't know about you guys i've known about this

1388
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,720
game for

1389
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:31,320
damn near four years now i don't know that for us to you guys but

1390
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,240
that's not that new

1391
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:39,240
well i'm sorry but it's not old school like christ

1392
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:42,440
as like way old school man

1393
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:48,800
DDR is a lot better. He's probably talking about the history of time thing. That would

1394
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:54,640
be relatively new. You're right. Considering the entire history of time, it would be new.

1395
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:59,280
And considering that a lot of people who watch Fox News Channel are old people, it would

1396
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:05,720
make sense. Anyway, our buddy Mel Balthazar says he was drawn to DDR because he likes

1397
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:09,520
music-based games, but after a while he noticed an unexpected side benefit.

1398
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:18,040
in the first no not heart attacks in the first four months or so I lost around

1399
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:21,000
30 pounds actually it would it from Mel would have sounded something like this

1400
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,600
your dog in the first 40 months or so dog I lost around 30 pounds dog I'm just

1401
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:31,120
kidding I'm kidding he's gonna kick my ass well you know

1402
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:36,560
cuz he did Randy Jackson DRI don't it's a joke it's a joke Jesus in about six to

1403
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:42,840
months I went from 280 to 230. I play nowadays to keep in shape more than anything. Very

1404
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:49,380
interesting. Uh, DDR fan Melody Hommen, also known as SharksGirl on this program, uh, also

1405
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:54,980
shed pounds while she played going from about 220 to 143 at her lowest weight. I never realized

1406
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:59,340
that she lost that much weight playing DDR. I never knew that. SharksGirl's like one of

1407
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:06,060
my best buds. I never knew that she went from 220 to 143 from DDR. I know, I'm a bad friend.

1408
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:08,980
She should so fire me!

1409
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:10,440
I just didn't know.

1410
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,520
Well, that's great.

1411
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:16,120
She says, I'm significantly lighter than when I wasn't playing, she said. You're not just

1412
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:19,520
using your hands, you're actually getting up and doing something.

1413
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:25,960
With the obesity epidemic in America reaching EPIC proportions, I think it would have been better if they said biblical proportions,

1414
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:29,400
and video games, the internet and television accused of being among the culprits, entertainment that

1415
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:33,360
combines physical activity with technology could be the wave of the future.

1416
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:37,180
said sport wall founder and CEO Kathy Lamberti,

1417
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:40,640
we have to give them the computer game packaged with their physical fitness

1418
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,980
otherwise they're not going to be interested.

1419
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:46,520
Kids have changed, they've been taught how to be entertained and seduced

1420
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:49,080
by technology.

1421
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,360
Seduced by technology, that's...

1422
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,220
oooh...

1423
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:56,040
DDR is going to seduce you.

1424
01:50:56,040 --> 01:51:00,960
Yeah I know, I get it hard on every time I pirate movies.

1425
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:10,680
technology sir knows how to seduce me. Mel had another quote in here. There's that stigma

1426
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:15,200
that people who play video games are slobs who just sit on the couch. I always thought

1427
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:21,260
that was true actually. In DDR it's more of an interactive experience where you're putting

1428
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:26,960
yourself into the game. Now I don't know about you guys, but I got the DDR for Xbox this

1429
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,860
this week, well not this week, but a couple weeks ago, and I've been playing on Xbox Live,

1430
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:36,580
and my fat ass has been on the couch schooling people by playing on the controller, so, and

1431
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:47,760
I've been having lots of fun. To date, Konami Digital Entertainment, which distributes DDR,

1432
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:57,280
has sold more than 6.5 million copies worldwide and 1 million in the United States.

1433
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:01,740
And let's see, oh Jason Enos had a quote in here too, this is a game that defies all the

1434
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:08,440
other games out there because the person has to get up and do the work. Interesting. And

1435
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:14,720
then it talks about this other thing called the Scooby Ball. The Scooby Ball. The Scooby

1436
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:22,140
ball. It's DDR and the Scooby Ball. In Scooby Ball, kids play in a portable enclosed playground.

1437
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:26,100
Both music signals and voice prompts guide them to lighted targets which they hit with

1438
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:39,420
balls to score points. Scooby Ball. Go figure. Lucky, why don't you share with us what's

1439
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:43,380
going on in the sim scene these days? I know there's got to be some news these past few

1440
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:48,740
weeks. Well, Tournemix is still going, right? What's up? I think it's still going. I don't

1441
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:55,860
know. Last release I got was number four, and I haven't seen anything since then. I

1442
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:01,660
mean, I've looked. It's just nothing, but I don't know if they're like, you know, still

1443
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:09,180
voting or what the hell's going on, but yeah, there's four sections for Tournemix. Checking

1444
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:14,940
right now see if there's number five nope just bracket four still so

1445
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:21,440
apparently bracket four rounds up the end of tourney mix five but you know

1446
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:27,440
what no one cares there's yeah wasn't that many good stuff to be honest it's

1447
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:31,480
still like the same five percent of the songs are decent then two percent are

1448
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:37,260
good and the rest suck but um some other interesting stuff if you're a tourney mix

1449
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:49,260
On DDRUK's forums, they've got in the music production thread, DJ Damien's V-Rare CD that he put out. Basically, it's a zip file of all of his songs that he's made.

1450
01:53:49,260 --> 01:54:00,260
They're okay. They've got, you know, your famous Art Art 2, and then, you know, the Legend of Art that were featured in Turning Mix 1, 2, and 4, I think.

1451
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:10,260
And, um, what else? Ah, just some other crap that he's done. But if you, you know, want something to download on your board, there you go.

1452
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,420
There you go.

1453
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:15,980
Aside from that, really not too much going on.

1454
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:17,540
There is some interesting stuff, though.

1455
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:25,000
I noticed that since DDRUK has their StepMania machine, which is DDX, or Dance something

1456
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:31,240
or other, I don't know, whatever, anyways, it's got internet rankings, which I'm assuming

1457
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:36,760
is probably something that's thrown into StepMania now, so, you know, hey, look for internet

1458
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:40,760
that rankings will be coming soon. As well as extended light support, people are working

1459
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:46,880
on that right now. There's talks about using serial ports, maybe USB ports for lights.

1460
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:53,360
Right now, parallel ports are, you know, supported, so there's information on DDR Maniacs for

1461
01:54:53,360 --> 01:55:00,120
that. Tons more sim files for download on BomaniStyle and their sim file database. A

1462
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:04,840
lot of them suck though, but hey, you know, look at the rankings on the sides to get an

1463
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:10,220
idea what might be good and what's not. Aside from that, really not too much stuff going

1464
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:19,680
on. No new alphas for StepMania released. It's just been kind of slow. Slow news week.

1465
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:29,340
No service pack 6 stuff for, you know, Ultramix, which we did not mention. You know, because

1466
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:38,340
That is news and all. Nothing yet because it has not come out yet, and I don't know. That's pretty much all that's going on.

1467
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:48,340
There's a nice thread, though, on the DDRManiaX's setmania theme boards that they're basically how-to guides to make your skin better, which is cool.

1468
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:56,340
And it just proves that you can make a sim that looks exactly like In the Groove, so yeah.

1469
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:20,340
Anyways, I kind of agree. Somebody in the chat room said DJ Damien's kind of crap stuff. Maybe it's just because I'm not a cool kid, but I don't get the joke. It's not funny, and it's kind of stupid to me. Yeah, I guess it's just British. Like Spice Girls, I get that. DJ Damien, I don't get it. Yes, Jamie?

1470
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:22,340
About him being crabby?

1471
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:24,340
Yeah.

1472
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:26,340
Oh, you picked up the microphone, so I thought you were going to say something.

1473
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:28,340
I don't get it.

1474
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:30,340
Yeah. Have you heard his stuff?

1475
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:32,340
No.

1476
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:36,340
Play Jamie a little bit of one of these songs. Play the best one.

1477
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:38,340
The best one.

1478
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:40,340
The best one.

1479
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:42,340
I can't wait to hear this.

1480
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:47,340
I don't think this should be getting any airtime on the show, but since Loki brought it up...

1481
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:57,340
Sure. Ballad of Tom Jones. Let's hear a little bit of this.

1482
01:56:57,340 --> 01:57:02,340
Put it in the middle somewhere.

1483
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:08,340
Let's move up with your reach, I've ended up dead

1484
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:12,340
You thought that I'm killing each other

1485
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:17,340
You never know, I'll let you save my life

1486
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:19,340
I'm gonna throw up

1487
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:23,340
Show me the door, but now I'm on top, you fucks will fall

1488
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:26,340
Screw this shit, I'm done, making trash ain't fun

1489
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:29,340
And you're trying to make stuff, pick it up, you're up

1490
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,340
i remember that

1491
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:33,340
alright, turn off, turn off

1492
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,340
stop it

1493
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,340
oh god that's horrible

1494
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:39,340
see i don't, i don't get it

1495
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:41,340
why do you think he's good?

1496
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:43,340
i don't get it

1497
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:45,340
you know what it is? it's the william hung of ddr

1498
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:47,340
that is exactly what it is

1499
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:49,340
but william hung is good

1500
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:51,340
compared to this guy

1501
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:55,340
the new song from our other listener.

1502
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:24,340
Finally, this should be a big surprise to you guys.

1503
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:28,340
Loki, BT with Kimo Sari.

1504
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:31,340
That's who I would have voted for.

1505
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:33,340
You wouldn't have even voted for the own song you put in?

1506
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:37,340
No, because I have come very close to using that song before.

1507
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:40,340
I thought that I might have, but it was another song.

1508
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:43,340
If I'm going to be gone for two weeks, I'm going to give you guys such crap songs

1509
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:45,340
to play in cage match while I'm gone. I can't wait.

1510
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,340
I'll pick them for you, Rob.

1511
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:49,340
No, I already have them lined up.

1512
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:51,340
I already have them lined up.

1513
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,340
So tune in next week. I'll be there in spirit.

1514
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:56,340
Alright.

1515
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:58,340
Just...

1516
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:03,340
When we come back from this next break, boys and girls, the FUs of the week, I know you've got some rants in you.

1517
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:05,340
Um, send them...

1518
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:07,340
What'd you say, Jamie?

1519
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:08,340
I made a request.

1520
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:10,340
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, I thought you said...

1521
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:13,340
When I said, I know you got some rants in you, I thought you said, a ton.

1522
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:16,340
Yeah, a ton of those, too.

1523
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:24,460
Okay, um, so, uh, yeah, we'll, um, get to the FUs of the week, so send those in over

1524
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:27,380
a private message.

1525
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:28,820
And we'll take care of that.

1526
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:32,440
In the meantime, more pop and music songs this break, including one Jamie wants to hear.

1527
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:34,000
She always wants to hear this song.

1528
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,180
You know what's sad, though?

1529
01:59:35,180 --> 01:59:39,260
I lost my folder of the pop and nine consumer songs.

1530
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:40,260
Have them.

1531
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:41,260
Good, because I need to get them for you.

1532
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:42,260
Because I don't have Don't Cry Jesus anymore.

1533
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:43,260
I'll get it when I get home.

1534
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:44,260
You can send it to me.

1535
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,460
Because when I, my desktop got erased.

1536
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:48,040
Imagine if Loki's desktop got erased, that's what I mean.

1537
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,040
Rob!

1538
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,040
Rob!

1539
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:51,040
Rob!

1540
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,040
Rob!

1541
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:53,040
Rob!

1542
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,040
Rob!

1543
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:55,040
Rob!

1544
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,040
Don't cry!

1545
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:57,040
Alright, we'll be back after some more popin music.

1546
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:00,800
Start off with Gachimon and some more stuff in here and when we come back, FUs of the

1547
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:01,800
week!

1548
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:12,920
Send them now!

1549
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:14,840
Tare da, tare da, tare da, tare da, tare da

1550
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:18,120
Sora no kaneta ni no gojukage

1551
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:25,140
Uchiro itu basa no gachiman

1552
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:28,620
Niho shi o kage senroida seba

1553
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:32,020
Ihigaki ni o hito todida

1554
02:00:32,020 --> 02:00:35,720
TÅbe, tobe, tobe, gachiman

1555
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:38,720
Yukai, yukai, yukai, gachiman

1556
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:52,720
Jijuu wa ito-ji, Jijuu wa ito-ji, Oh gachama, gachama

1557
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:27,720
Get your man, get you, what he told you

1558
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:31,720
Get you, what he told you

1559
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:37,720
Go get your man, get your man

1560
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:33,720
But it ain't

1561
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:37,720
You think you can say it, girl, it ain't

1562
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:40,720
People be doin' what you can

1563
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:45,720
Trash hearts, livid me, I ain't cheatin' for none

1564
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:48,720
I don't like it, girl

1565
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:51,720
You're not a girl, you're found

1566
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:53,720
But it's true

1567
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:55,720
When you get down on your way

1568
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:58,720
Come along, you're in the sun on

1569
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:00,720
This is the end

1570
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:39,320
Hey, did you hear about that show?

1571
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,320
What show?

1572
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:43,560
Well, they play a lot of greats and money and video game music, but if you listen to

1573
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:45,600
it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

1574
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,320
Oh, I've heard of that station.

1575
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:48,320
Really?

1576
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,680
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

1577
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:53,320
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

1578
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:54,320
Well, you die.

1579
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:55,320
I what?

1580
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:56,320
Hey, wait!

1581
02:05:56,320 --> 02:06:00,120
Wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

1582
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:02,120
Aaaaaaahh!

1583
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:05,120
Orange Launch Radio, listen, or die!

1584
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:08,120
Stop it Dave!

1585
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:15,120
Welcome back to Orange Launch Radio, we're going to get into the FUs of the Week very shortly.

1586
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:21,120
Umm, gosh I'm not sure what else is going on in the mining world right now.

1587
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:24,120
Loki you seem to be more on top of things than I am.

1588
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:52,120
What is it you're checking out there? This is, uh, like I was saying earlier, their, um, DDR UK's Dance, um, with Dance DX, and they're on their version 2 now, and I'm gonna, in just one second here, uh, link the chat room to their gallery for this, which it's actually, it's a very well-put-together set-mania machine, I might add, and they have a lot of people working on it, and it's the way I wish, uh, Golf Land would work,

1589
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:55,480
work, where you have more than one person working on it.

1590
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:58,860
What exactly is going on with that thing? And even our chat room's curious, because

1591
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,140
it's been three weeks since we really had an update, and I know there's kind of some

1592
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:05,740
stuff going on. What exactly happened with that EX2 project you've been really heavily

1593
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:06,740
involved with?

1594
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:11,920
Keith broke the motherboard. That's pretty much what it comes down to. And no, I'm not

1595
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:16,960
going to go buy a new motherboard, because as it was, I put more time and effort into

1596
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:21,580
it than was needed. And that's what it sounds like he wants me to do, is get a new motherboard

1597
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:25,980
for it I'm like no so you know whatever happens happens they got their money out

1598
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:32,200
of it I got my money out of it so no one's at a real loss sucks for them

1599
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:37,720
because they rewired their whole cabinet but you know I you know someday I guess

1600
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:41,540
we can put any motherboard in it but I really it's just pain the ass the way it

1601
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:47,520
was set up and things don't work that should work it's just really annoying

1602
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:50,520
Any chance you'll do a cabinet for a different arcade?

1603
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:46,520
It's free to sell, do whatever you want with it. As long as you keep the development team's credit in there, which that's already hard programmed into it. So, technically, yeah, I could go out there, make an upgrade for an arcade and sell it and make money off of it. So, I'm looking into it.

1604
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,520
No, I wonder how many people are going to steal your idea right there.

1605
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:49,520
Check your legal channels.

1606
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:50,520
Huh?

1607
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:51,520
Check your legal channels.

1608
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:52,520
Yeah.

1609
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:53,520
Just cover your butt.

1610
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,520
But I figure if they can get away with that megamix thing.

1611
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:57,520
Here's what it is.

1612
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:02,520
I don't have to check any legal channels because all I'm doing is providing the hardware.

1613
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,520
And the program to run it.

1614
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:05,520
They made the program.

1615
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:07,520
I made the hardware.

1616
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:08,520
There's nothing I can get in trouble for.

1617
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:09,520
What about music?

1618
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:10,520
Licensing.

1619
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:11,520
What do you mean?

1620
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:12,520
That's the program.

1621
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:14,520
That's all StepMania.

1622
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:15,520
That's their licensing.

1623
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:19,680
their problem all I'm doing is making the hardware set up for it so there's no

1624
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:25,000
way I can get in trouble for building a PC that's you know they can try but you

1625
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:31,360
know it's not gonna work so that's that's if I were to do it and if the

1626
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:36,580
coppers ever come after me Loki did it he had the gun it was Loki with a

1627
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:42,840
revolver in the conservatory I saw it with my own eyes let's get on with the

1628
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:45,220
the FUs of the Week, shall we?

1629
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:48,220
What do we do during the FUs of the Week, Miss Jamie?

1630
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:55,220
We bit your moon.

1631
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:11,060
I really miss that music. I really, really miss that. I'm going to keep it for a while.

1632
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:18,060
Anyway, my first F.U. of the week goes toward people who go 15 miles under the speed limit

1633
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:23,060
when I'm wanting to go 10 over it. Damn them.

1634
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:37,060
Also, it goes to the Safeway over on Madison, like on the way here, for not carrying I.M.'s cat food, which is what I feed Sherman.

1635
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:42,060
A big effigy goes to cat food in general to having their first product be wheat.

1636
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:49,060
Okay, what cat? Have you ever seen a stray cat go up and want wheat?

1637
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:54,060
No, they're going to go after the open can of tuna that's sitting around by the trash can.

1638
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:57,060
They're going to go kill a bird or a squirrel.

1639
02:10:57,060 --> 02:11:00,060
Rob, have you ever known of any cats that go after wheat?

1640
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:02,060
I can't say I have.

1641
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:04,060
Have you ever met a vegetarian cat?

1642
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:05,060
I can't say I have.

1643
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:13,780
And Shermy got really, really fat when I was feeding her the other kind of cat food that

1644
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:14,980
had meat.

1645
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:19,540
And then I switched over to cat food that had meat as the first product.

1646
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:21,920
And lo and behold, she lost weight.

1647
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:26,980
And by the way, cats eat grass because they can puke it back up and get stuff out of their

1648
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:27,980
situation.

1649
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:28,980
Okay?

1650
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:29,980
That's why cats eat grass.

1651
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:30,980
Thank you.

1652
02:11:30,980 --> 02:11:31,980
And I kid you not.

1653
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:32,980
Watch cats.

1654
02:11:32,980 --> 02:11:40,580
grass then they hack it all back up yeah any animal will do that let's go eat grass and throw it up

1655
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:45,540
let's go make mud pies jamie yeah okay

1656
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:59,460
anyway um another fu goes toward a lack of money a lack of time a big fu goes consistent

1657
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:10,980
Also, an F.U. goes towards stupid people, and that don't mean people who just don't

1658
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:11,980
understand.

1659
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:17,140
You know, people who, well, there's types of stupidity.

1660
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:22,340
The stupidity I'm referring to is lack of common sense, okay, for the people who should

1661
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:25,700
not be involved in any part of the gene pool.

1662
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:31,700
These are the people that I would like removed from my universe.

1663
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:37,700
Another F.U. goes toward myself for having all of these ideas for writing

1664
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:40,700
and just not being able to get them out of my head.

1665
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:43,700
I hate writer's block with an unholy passion.

1666
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:45,700
It's been driving me nuts.

1667
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:48,700
So, an F.U. to writer's block.

1668
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:51,700
An artist's block, although I had started drawing again.

1669
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:53,700
I'm doing a commission drawing right now.

1670
02:12:53,700 --> 02:13:03,580
Another F.U. goes toward my college, but, okay, this is what I don't get, and this may

1671
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:06,240
be a little bit technical for some people.

1672
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:10,480
When you take out a student loan, if you're going for federal loans and you have to fill

1673
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:14,720
out your FAFSA, it's a free application for federal student aid, so that your school will

1674
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:20,320
know how much your family makes, or if you're an independent student, how much you make.

1675
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:25,640
So I can understand that since they're doing a federal loan, they need to see how much

1676
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:27,320
you are going to be eligible for.

1677
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:34,520
But why on earth do I need to fill out a FAFSA for a private loan, okay?

1678
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:38,560
I sort of see the reason behind it, it's just a big pain in the ass right now.

1679
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:43,000
So I got to go out and I've done my FAFSA already, I just have to wait on the school

1680
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,800
to get my student aid report so I can get my award letter, so I can apply for the loan

1681
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:49,180
so I can get my laptop.

1682
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:59,940
I need a laptop because I'm going into database management and another F.U. goes toward being

1683
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,460
really homesick lately.

1684
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:11,500
I just wanted to go back home for a little while and not have the money to do it in the

1685
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:18,500
you go to stores, just being the busy time you're at work, and that's about it. But yeah,

1686
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:19,500
I'm really hungry.

1687
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:20,500
Aww.

1688
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:21,500
Well.

1689
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:23,500
Alright then, moving on.

1690
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:26,500
Morkie, your turn. What's pissing you off this week?

1691
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:31,500
I forgot about this song.

1692
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:39,500
Um, number one, uh, I don't really know. It's like, it's been so long.

1693
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:43,500
First off, of course, Fuck You is a safe and sane firework.

1694
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:53,500
They're really lame, and when you have a firework that lasts shorter, you know, the matched lighting lasts longer than the actual firework.

1695
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:57,500
I've had orgasms that lasted longer than some of those fireworks, seriously.

1696
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:05,500
I mean, it's just like really pathetic. You're like, wow, you know, lighting a candle would have been more exciting than this firework.

1697
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:10,620
So, that really sucks, but luckily we know how to get our money out of Safe and Same

1698
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:20,620
Fireworks. That's burnt packaging that they come in. So, hooray. Number two goes to the

1699
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:29,260
heat. I don't like it. It's been pretty hot. I don't like it being nice and cool out. You

1700
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:34,260
comfy, Bay Area weather. Don't like this dry heat. Sucks.

1701
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:36,260
Um, also, um...

1702
02:15:36,260 --> 02:15:40,260
Just be glad that this isn't the South Shore. It's very humid.

1703
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:50,260
Also, of course, you know, after seeing Fahrenheit 9-11 again, and, uh, Buck Bush, just because, you know, he's stupid.

1704
02:15:50,260 --> 02:15:57,260
And, um, really, I'm not that pissed off at stuff that much.

1705
02:15:57,260 --> 02:16:09,260
Fuck you, the retarded people on Final Fantasy XI. I mean, there's some really dumb people out there. I guess pretty much everyone. There's a lot of dumb people everywhere. I really hate dumb people and many of the children.

1706
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:21,260
And fuck you, the goddamn DDREX2 thing being broken again. It's like, I can't fix that machine enough. And that's why I have to be at the point to where I say, you know, fuck it, I don't care.

1707
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:29,260
And once again, fuck you to Keith, because that promise he made that I would get to dismantle the BeatMania machine and take some of the parts for it, because you're gonna get rid of it anyways.

1708
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:32,260
Well, he did it without me and threw the machine away. So, fuck him.

1709
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:35,260
And, um...

1710
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:39,260
Yeah, that's really all I have. I'm- I'm just done.

1711
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:40,260
I- I'm just...

1712
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:44,260
And I don't know what the hell, my PC, like, instantly restarted today.

1713
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:50,260
Like, when, when I was gonna log out of Final Fantasy, just the whole PC restarted, so I had to figure out what's wrong with that.

1714
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:55,260
So all I did today was open the case up. I touched nothing inside, opened the case up

1715
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:58,260
because I noticed there was a lot of dust on the outside and I wanted to see how much

1716
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:03,260
it collected on the inside. Opened it up, looked inside, closed case done, and it goes

1717
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:10,260
and gets all fucked up, so. Oh, and fuck you to CoolWebSearch for hijacking Internet Explorer.

1718
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:15,260
Internet Explorer is completely useless for a while, so you know what, that's why I'm

1719
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:21,340
firebox now fuck you microsoft and i'm done

1720
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:23,420
did you have something you want to add jamie

1721
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:27,180
i happened to remind you

1722
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:30,460
spammers can go to hell

1723
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:33,180
my turn

1724
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:37,340
um an fu to having the hiccups for two weeks or not that no it wasn't that one

1725
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:42,620
three days um and uh that really sucked

1726
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:48,380
and uh... an f you to my work wanting to send me away for two weeks

1727
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:51,340
uh... my work must anyway for two weeks and that's the end of this all this

1728
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:52,380
stuff is going on

1729
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:55,980
my friend that's in iraq right now is going to be home and let me go on

1730
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:58,340
uh... i was going to get tickets

1731
02:17:58,340 --> 02:17:59,980
uh... well fight

1732
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:03,060
backed up sharks rose to treat me to elana's concert

1733
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:04,620
and i'll get to go to that now

1734
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:08,820
might be here

1735
02:18:08,820 --> 02:18:12,380
uh... and yeah so

1736
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:14,980
What else was I going to miss? There was something else big I'm missing, let's forget.

1737
02:18:14,980 --> 02:18:19,680
I'm missing this show twice in a while, but you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.

1738
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:22,880
Real life sucks sometimes.

1739
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:27,980
Also an FU to Golfland and Scandia together

1740
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:33,080
for helping make Sacramento Arcades a peak fat joke. I hate living here.

1741
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:36,180
Actually, no, I really like living here, but as a gamer, it's pathetic.

1742
02:18:36,180 --> 02:18:40,480
Honestly, there's no arcades in Sacramento. None.

1743
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:43,480
I miss the game room. I miss it so much. You know why I miss the game room?

1744
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:47,480
Because they didn't have ticket machines at the game room. That is why I miss them.

1745
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:50,480
They were all about fighting games.

1746
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:54,480
I would rather have the fighting game crowd than the birthday crowd, and that's sad.

1747
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:56,480
And they had victory.

1748
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:59,480
Yes, they did. And they had pinball games, too, which made me happy.

1749
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:02,480
I just, I can't stand it. I've had it. I've had my limit.

1750
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:06,480
I've reached my limit of putting up with kids and teenagers.

1751
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:11,960
fucking like 15 16 year olds like I know a lot of 15 16 year olds listen to this

1752
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:15,360
program and so I'm not I'm not trying to be generalizing but I'm talking about

1753
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:19,680
those kids that probably pick on you at school well those guys you hang out at

1754
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:26,400
the arcade too and they're such asses I mean my god I wanted an F you to their

1755
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:30,760
parents for making them I wish you would have aborted those

1756
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:32,760
child

1757
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:34,760
you know

1758
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:36,760
he could be able to

1759
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:38,760
fix the problems at

1760
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:40,760
golf land if it weren't for the kids like ripping

1761
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:42,760
shit off the game

1762
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:44,760
you know before you used to be ripping keys off the

1763
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:46,760
keyboard mania and changing diapers

1764
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:48,760
and changing diapers on them and now

1765
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:50,760
it's ripping the cymbals off the drums

1766
02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:52,760
or just chunks of

1767
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:54,760
the cymbals but

1768
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:56,760
golf lands defense they did at a subway

1769
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:58,760
and that makes me happy

1770
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:07,760
I don't fucking go there to eat Subway. I go there to play DDR, not be harassed and get the shit thrown at me. I'm just sick of it.

1771
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:10,760
There's no arcades in this town anymore.

1772
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:12,760
Till I open my dream arcade.

1773
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:16,760
If I feel like just going somewhere to be a bitch, I'll just go to Golf Land and have people thrown out.

1774
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:19,760
Well, maybe we should just go there regularly and have people thrown out regularly. That makes me feel better.

1775
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,760
Probably be wonders for my morale.

1776
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:26,760
I think we should do it. We could have like a squad name or something.

1777
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:28,760
Alright, let's move on.

1778
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,760
The arcade protection agency.

1779
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:32,760
Got a small story about that.

1780
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:34,760
It was really small.

1781
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:42,760
There was our friend, Mr. Pirate Power, that's in, I don't know, Toady, I guess.

1782
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:45,760
I want to get him on the show sometime because he's actually pretty funny.

1783
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:48,760
I think he'd be pretty good for a guest on the show, but anyway.

1784
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:51,760
Anyway, so he was down at Golf Land with prestige and stuff there,

1785
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:54,760
and some stupid kid came up on him just acting like an ass,

1786
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:56,760
They scared him and he ran out. That was funny.

1787
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:03,760
I thought there was more to this story. I thought you would have, like, how he was thrown out or what was said.

1788
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:09,760
I thought he was volunteering to sign up for the arcade ejection squad.

1789
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:13,760
Anyway, moving on.

1790
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:16,760
Yeah, AES. The Arcade Ejection Squad.

1791
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:18,760
Fuck up! Get out of here!

1792
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:27,760
We should totally start a website.

1793
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:30,760
I'm loving this idea.

1794
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:33,760
We're going to single-handedly save this arcade scene in this town.

1795
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:34,760
All right, moving on.

1796
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:37,760
Well, we did once by putting all of these pictures of the broken machines.

1797
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:39,760
That's very true.

1798
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:40,760
That's very true.

1799
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:41,760
We ought to do that again.

1800
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:42,760
We ought to do that again.

1801
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:45,760
But this time we should send them, like, the media and stuff.

1802
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:50,760
Anyway, let's go to the chat room, F.U.s, shall we?

1803
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:54,760
VxJasonXV says, one simple F.U.

1804
02:21:54,760 --> 02:22:01,760
F.U. to having a job and not yet actually working, thus not having income.

1805
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,760
DDR Angel says, only one F.U. this week.

1806
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:08,760
I'd like to say F.U. to one of my coworkers who thinks that he should control my schedule at work

1807
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:10,760
when he doesn't even have the authority to touch it.

1808
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:13,760
If I'm scheduled until 10, leave it at 10.

1809
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:17,260
I can't stay a half hour, even if you wanted me to, so get over it!

1810
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:20,760
At least I'll be out of that hellhole soon, that is all, goodbye.

1811
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:22,760
You know she's moving up here pretty soon.

1812
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:26,760
She'll get out of the, uh, place she's in.

1813
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:29,760
Then we'll hear more local FUs, anyway.

1814
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:34,760
Um, sharksgirl says, uh, great, she says, uh, F you to your work.

1815
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:39,760
My work. F you disguise work for making you go away so you miss our date.

1816
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:44,760
I won't be able to put out for her. I promised I would put out because she bought the tickets and everything, so.

1817
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:49,760
She says she figures if nothing else Mel's her default, but he just wouldn't appreciate it.

1818
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:54,760
I'm sure Mel would accept the putting out, though, huh?

1819
02:22:54,760 --> 02:22:59,760
Jamie's raising her hand. You should talk to Jamie.

1820
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:04,760
Don't count me out yet, though. The way my work works, just you wait. I won't be gone till September.

1821
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:09,760
Lach has two FUs, one is a couple weeks old and then the new one.

1822
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:13,760
Number one is this girl named Lauren who I thought everything was going well with.

1823
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:18,760
After dating for a month, I got told that she was dating someone else by her best friend and she wasn't going to even tell me.

1824
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:20,760
So FU there.

1825
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:22,760
High school drama.

1826
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:23,760
High school drama.

1827
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,760
I don't even think he's in high school though, I think he's older than that.

1828
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:29,760
I don't know the age of all our listeners.

1829
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:30,760
It's drama.

1830
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:36,060
I'm, I'm, we're in the old demographic here in the studio, that's the interesting part.

1831
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:41,560
Locke also says, F you to people who cannot discuss politics by, without getting pissed off.

1832
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:45,260
And also those who believe that you are not allowed to have an opinion yourself,

1833
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:49,060
and unless you agree with them completely in politics, that they won't talk to you.

1834
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:54,760
Replace politics with religion, and I had a frustrating experience like that the other day.

1835
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:58,260
You know what, if anything that anyone has a strong opinion about,

1836
02:23:58,260 --> 02:24:05,260
they get all closed-minded about. Everyone has a right to an opinion, you know.

1837
02:24:08,260 --> 02:24:12,980
Blair O'Nai says, F you Dr. Atkins. If I hear low-carb or Atkins-friendly, I swear I will

1838
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:17,300
break my TV. I mean, I bet half the people on Atkins who haven't read the books don't

1839
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:23,020
know that carb is short for carbohydrate or that fruits have them. Also, I doubt many

1840
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:26,780
know that all the fucking heart problems Atkins had when he died.

1841
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:33,340
What's that was debatable because they said he also that died from falling. No the active site gives you gout

1842
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:36,180
I thought you're gonna say yeah

1843
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:43,180
But eating all that meat with a lot of gas like that. It also gives you bad breath and affects your hormones and

1844
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:50,140
Like will eventually give you here. I have the miracle diet for you guys. Okay, we're gonna call it the banana diet

1845
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:52,340
Okay, and I want to put this on all the packaging

1846
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:56,300
We're gonna put this on like all these packages the banana diet friendly thing

1847
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:59,540
eat less

1848
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:01,740
exercise more

1849
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:08,760
John it's worked for me John

1850
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:12,220
John field says f you to my father

1851
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:17,700
But and just so you know when I say eat less that doesn't mean you do the Mary Kate Olsen thing and not eat at

1852
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:24,700
soft, you just eat less. If you're eating a whole pie, eat half the pie. Instead of

1853
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:30,940
not eating, do crackles, just like the Olsen twins. Cause that's step two in Matt's great

1854
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:37,940
plan to get them naked. No, it is, it is what you eat as much as how much of it you eat.

1855
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:46,500
You know, just don't eat processed food. Go cook a meal. You know, get some, some, you

1856
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:53,500
some, you know, steak, cook it on your Foreman Grill. Foreman Grill's awesome, you know.

1857
02:25:53,780 --> 02:26:00,780
It's a matter of just eating real food. Look, I guarantee you, I challenge everybody, okay,

1858
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:09,120
for one week, you know, go grocery shopping and try it. Don't buy anything that has high

1859
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:13,980
fructose corn syrup in it. Try doing it for a week. I guarantee you, everything that you

1860
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:18,820
normally get, or most of everything that you get, has that as either a primary or at least

1861
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,820
a middle ingredient on it.

1862
02:26:19,820 --> 02:26:20,820
Okay, I'm sorry.

1863
02:26:20,820 --> 02:26:27,500
That's alright. Back to John Fields' FU. FU to my father, fuck having to get a job, fuck

1864
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:31,660
having to pay $500 for a tiny scratch on a bumper that happened in an accident. My life

1865
02:26:31,660 --> 02:26:33,980
worth is now down to only $1,000.

1866
02:26:33,980 --> 02:26:38,540
Hey, that's more than I've got today.

1867
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:39,540
on

1868
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:44,720
Evo Maoki 2DX says F.U. goes to idiot tourists on July 4th who thought that standing and

1869
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:47,880
blocking my view was going to give them a better view of the fireworks

1870
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:51,640
Oh and F.U. goes to F.O.G. for blocking out the fireworks in the first place

1871
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:55,800
And F.U. to idiot drivers trying to run me over on my way back to the BART station

1872
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:58,800
Oh and F.U. to the idiot drunk driver that took Satoshi's life

1873
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:04,620
I think we have another F.U. to address that I'll get that at the end here

1874
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:10,020
boy says neighbor kids suck they touch your drums then you tell them not to and

1875
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:13,820
then tell their soccer mom then they come back and taunt you then they get

1876
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:20,380
you in trouble I want to throw them off my house headfirst

1877
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:25,460
misty says this one goes to myself because I lost my wallet and all the

1878
02:27:25,460 --> 02:27:29,740
important shit that I was stupid enough to keep in there I only hope I can find

1879
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:33,500
it in the landfill that is my room I like I should go through the landfill

1880
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:43,000
And lastly, Mel B of RTF has an FU. He says FU to Richard Earl Sevets. Thanks a whole

1881
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,500
freaking lot for taking the lives of a local DDR and his mom. I'm sure drinking before

1882
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:52,880
taking the wheel was worth it. You worthless fuck.

1883
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:57,460
Difficult times for the NorCal Bomani scene this week. I didn't know him personally, but

1884
02:27:57,460 --> 02:28:03,040
I know a lot of people in NorCal knew Satoshi was his online name and passed away in a drunk

1885
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:13,560
driving accident this week which is just a sad reminder about the effects of

1886
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:18,000
drunk driving so just remember if you're going to drink give a friend your keys

1887
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:22,840
please do not drive notice when we do our drunk shows here on orange lounge we

1888
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:25,760
always have a backup plan for how we're all going to get home the fact that two

1889
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:30,140
of us live here helps I had I had you pick me up to bring me here and I had

1890
02:28:30,140 --> 02:28:35,500
Dan take me home exactly I mean you know if if only everybody could be smart then

1891
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:39,340
we wouldn't have this bullshit happening and that's what it is it's bullshit

1892
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:46,180
shouldn't happen that is really sad I didn't better nail this guy's ass to the

1893
02:28:46,180 --> 02:28:50,660
wall that's all I have to say I'm almost positive he died too but I'm not sure

1894
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:57,840
I'm not sure but you want to get some more black ops stuff maker of the

1895
02:28:57,840 --> 02:29:13,240
I just have this thing, though, about the drunk drivers who live, that I am sort of

1896
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:19,280
glad that they live for one reason. Because dead people can't suffer. You can't make them

1897
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:20,280
suffer.

1898
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:22,400
That's a lot of guilt to have. I mean, a lot of...

1899
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:26,800
It's not even the guilt that I care about. I care about sitting them down and making

1900
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:32,600
them suffer repeatedly. I don't think a lot of drunk drivers are necessarily

1901
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:35,680
bad people. It doesn't matter.

1902
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:41,680
I know, I know, I know. It doesn't matter. They made a really horrible, bad, ignorant.

1903
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:43,280
It's an ignorant decision. They're ignorant people.

1904
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:47,880
I think that they need to be punished for it for the rest of their life.

1905
02:29:47,880 --> 02:29:55,200
Whether they punish themselves or, you know, I think that if you are involved in a drunk

1906
02:29:55,200 --> 02:30:00,520
driving accident and you were the drunk driver, you need to, for the rest of your life, have

1907
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:06,340
your driving privileges revoked. For the rest of your life. I don't care how God damn inconvenient

1908
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:08,300
it makes it on you, you do not deserve to drive.

1909
02:30:08,300 --> 02:30:13,380
Take the bus! That's what it's for! More people should take the bus anyway, not that I should

1910
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:15,220
talk because I drive, but you know.

1911
02:30:15,220 --> 02:30:19,100
Actually, I do have another-

1912
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:21,900
If I lived in a big city, I would take, like, the subway. Yes?

1913
02:30:21,900 --> 02:30:23,900
I actually do have another few, by the way.

1914
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:30,900
I have an F you to the emissions commercials that they have on the radio here.

1915
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:35,900
Because I normally listen to the radio, but I have a big F you to the emissions one.

1916
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:39,900
Saying that, you know, drive your car less. Blah, blah, blah.

1917
02:30:39,900 --> 02:30:43,900
Do you know who the cause of the emissions problem is in the state?

1918
02:30:43,900 --> 02:30:45,900
It's freaking industry.

1919
02:30:45,900 --> 02:30:52,900
You know, car emissions are negligible in comparison to these unregulated factories that we have floating around.

1920
02:30:52,900 --> 02:31:00,720
around. So, you know what all that is? It's my whole theory on how government works, okay?

1921
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:07,260
It's money. It's lobbyists. We are run by corporations. And it's these corporations

1922
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:12,380
that control what legislature gets passed. So, anyway.

1923
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:16,460
We had one more FU come in to kind of try and bring the mood back up here a little bit.

1924
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:21,060
D. Archaholic says, FU to Comcast for deleting our connection to Japan TV because it was

1925
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:27,600
a mistake and finding out that to get it back it cost $24 a month just for that one channel.

1926
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:32,180
I guess that means we probably lost it too, that makes me sad. I know, but that still

1927
02:31:32,180 --> 02:31:38,800
makes me sad, it was a cool network. Oh well. What can you do? I think that's the station

1928
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:44,220
that plays a lot of the current Dorama series that come on TV. Yep, I'm almost positive

1929
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:48,220
I was watching one in Berkeley that was called Sakura.

1930
02:31:48,220 --> 02:31:50,220
Oh well.

1931
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:53,220
Okay, so what we're going to do, we're going to take a break.

1932
02:31:53,220 --> 02:31:58,220
When we come back, what we're going to do, we will do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1933
02:31:58,220 --> 02:32:01,220
And I also want to show something off.

1934
02:32:01,220 --> 02:32:05,220
This computer upgrade has helped us be capable of doing something else here on the show

1935
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:08,220
that we will be incorporating in the show in the future.

1936
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:10,220
But we're going to kind of try it out tonight.

1937
02:32:10,220 --> 02:32:13,220
I'm going to show it to you guys when we come back.

1938
02:32:13,220 --> 02:32:14,700
Excuse me, front of the screen.

1939
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:17,700
Allow you to sing in sync with the song.

1940
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:19,000
That's one thing.

1941
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,000
We're going to do that.

1942
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,820
We're going to have Ask Orange Lounge with synced music, for one.

1943
02:32:22,820 --> 02:32:26,340
Send your questions over private message to Sky if you want to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1944
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:29,400
In the meantime, we've done a lot of pop and music stuff, so I think we need to get away

1945
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:32,860
from it and try some, how about some 2DX, I don't think we've played a single, oh, we

1946
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:36,020
did one 2DX song, that's not enough.

1947
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:37,020
You want to do Cracker?

1948
02:32:37,020 --> 02:32:38,020
I want to hear Cracker.

1949
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:39,020
All right, we'll do some Cracker.

1950
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:42,020
And when we come back, Asgore's Lounge!

1951
02:33:09,020 --> 02:33:11,020
You

1952
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:42,260

You must be, must be, you know that you're not the one that's lost

02:35:22,460 --> 02:35:29,460
You gotta kick the neck, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be

1967
02:35:29,460 --> 02:35:39,460
Can't make me feel that you're running with me, yeah

1968
02:35:39,460 --> 02:35:49,460
Can't make me feel that you're running with me, yeah

1969
02:35:49,460 --> 02:35:56,460
Whenever I'm fine

1970
02:35:56,460 --> 02:36:03,460
I'm not prepared to say

1971
02:36:03,460 --> 02:36:09,460
Whenever I'm fine

1972
02:36:09,460 --> 02:36:16,460
I'm not prepared to say

1973
02:36:16,460 --> 02:36:20,460
Whenever I fall

1974
02:36:23,460 --> 02:36:26,460
It makes me happy

1975
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:52,860
Baby, it's on the go Baby, it's on the go

1976
02:36:52,860 --> 02:37:03,860
Reachin' in the door, the lights do go, whoa Baby it's long, let's go, it's the light forever Can't wait till tomorrow

1977
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:33,860
I want you baby, maybe tonight I'll take you far away

1978
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:38,860
I'll see you dancing, shining like a jewel

1979
02:37:38,860 --> 02:37:45,860
Burning for love In the golden light of love inside you

1980
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:51,860
My breath I have and your precious fire for me

1981
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:56,860
Baby it's all in gold Reaching out the door to let you go

1982
02:37:56,860 --> 02:38:01,860
Baby it's all in gold Shine forever

1983
02:38:01,860 --> 02:38:05,860
Can't wait till tomorrow Baby it's all in gold

1984
02:38:05,860 --> 02:38:08,860
Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go

1985
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:11,860
Woah, baby, it's all just gold

1986
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:15,860
I'll shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow

1987
02:38:27,860 --> 02:38:30,860
I need you, baby

1988
02:38:30,860 --> 02:38:44,940
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1989
02:38:44,940 --> 02:38:49,060
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1990
02:38:49,060 --> 02:38:54,820
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1991
02:38:54,820 --> 02:38:58,340
Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio.

1992
02:38:58,340 --> 02:39:03,780
We're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in just a moment, but first I want to show

1993
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:06,500
off a new feature that we're going to have very soon on the show.

1994
02:39:06,500 --> 02:39:11,660
I'm just trying to think of ways to implement this in a non-Trainwreck sort of way.

1995
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:12,660
Oh yes!

1996
02:39:12,660 --> 02:39:13,660
I hear a phone ringing!

1997
02:39:13,660 --> 02:39:14,660
Hello?

1998
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:15,660
Hello, Orange Lounge?

1999
02:39:15,660 --> 02:39:16,660
Yes!

2000
02:39:16,660 --> 02:39:17,660
I just have one question.

2001
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:18,660
Yes!

2002
02:39:18,660 --> 02:39:19,660
Can you hear me now?

2003
02:39:19,660 --> 02:39:20,660
Yes, I can hear you now.

2004
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:21,660
Who is this?

2005
02:39:21,660 --> 02:39:22,660
This is Jason.

2006
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:23,660
Hi, Jason.

2007
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:25,660
Yes, I can hear you now. Who is this?

2008
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:27,660
This is Jason.

2009
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:30,660
Hi Jason. Is this TeVX JasonXV?

2010
02:39:30,660 --> 02:39:32,660
You would be correct, sir.

2011
02:39:34,660 --> 02:39:36,660
Oh, how you doing?

2012
02:39:36,660 --> 02:39:38,660
I'm doing pretty good.

2013
02:39:38,660 --> 02:39:40,660
That's good. This is exciting, isn't it?

2014
02:39:40,660 --> 02:39:42,660
Now we can talk to our listeners.

2015
02:39:42,660 --> 02:39:44,660
Sounds nice and smooth to me.

2016
02:39:44,660 --> 02:39:47,660
Just so you know, this is not a regular phone connection, is it?

2017
02:39:47,660 --> 02:39:48,660
Nope.

2018
02:39:48,660 --> 02:39:49,660
No, this is actually...

2019
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:50,660
This is a digital connection.

2020
02:39:50,660 --> 02:39:52,840
Yes, this is an all digital secure connection.

2021
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:54,940
We're using a program called Skype.

2022
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:56,740
You can download it at skype.org.

2023
02:39:56,740 --> 02:39:57,900
It's completely free.

2024
02:39:57,900 --> 02:39:58,900
You can spell it for everybody.

2025
02:39:58,900 --> 02:40:04,380
S-K-Y-P-E. And when we get this running, which we will soon,

2026
02:40:04,380 --> 02:40:05,660
you'll be able to call us.

2027
02:40:05,660 --> 02:40:07,620
If you have a broadband connection, unfortunately,

2028
02:40:07,620 --> 02:40:08,940
those of you with a modem connection,

2029
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:10,420
it's going to be too much for your connections.

2030
02:40:10,420 --> 02:40:11,020
You're not going to be able to do it.

2031
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:12,600
But if you have a broadband connection,

2032
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:14,180
you will be able to interact with us.

2033
02:40:14,180 --> 02:40:16,980
And we're not sure in what capacity yet.

2034
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:19,900
We're probably going to have to control it somehow.

2035
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:22,660
but you will be able to call the show and it'll be fun.

2036
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:25,180
And Jamie can yell at you in person, which will be great.

2037
02:40:25,180 --> 02:40:27,820
And you know your phone bill has nothing to do with this.

2038
02:40:27,820 --> 02:40:30,940
Yeah, this is not an actual phone line.

2039
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:34,820
This is the same thing as sending an IM to somebody just verbally.

2040
02:40:34,820 --> 02:40:35,740
This is voice chat.

2041
02:40:35,740 --> 02:40:37,320
It's just a voice chat program on that.

2042
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:40,820
It's like Xbox Live, except there's not people on it going,

2043
02:40:40,820 --> 02:40:43,660
you know, bitch, bitch, bitch, your mom, your mom.

2044
02:40:43,660 --> 02:40:45,100
You're a controller kiddo.

2045
02:40:45,100 --> 02:40:46,220
You're a controller kiddo.

2046
02:40:46,220 --> 02:40:47,380
You're lame.

2047
02:40:47,380 --> 02:40:49,700
You know what's going to be cool is when they come out

2048
02:40:49,700 --> 02:40:53,700
I'm still waiting for that.

2049
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:57,700
It's coming, it's coming, so soon enough we'll have that.

2050
02:40:57,700 --> 02:41:01,700
And then we'll be able to see your ugly mugs at the same time.

2051
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:05,700
Yeah, we'll definitely have to do something with itoychat in the future.

2052
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:09,700
You should need to come back out and hang out with us again.

2053
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:13,700
I have an excellent...hold on, wait, stop, stop the show! I have an excellent idea.

2054
02:41:13,700 --> 02:41:17,700
We can broadcast all of our shows over itoychat.

2055
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:23,700
Oh, come on! I think there's moderators on itoychat. We'd probably get banned.

2056
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:26,700
We'll see. We'll see when it comes out.

2057
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:29,700
Alright, well thanks for calling, Jason, and helping us show off this new toy.

2058
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:30,700
Thank you.

2059
02:41:30,700 --> 02:41:33,700
And thank you for filling in for the show last week. That was very nice of you.

2060
02:41:33,700 --> 02:41:35,700
It was very fun once I actually got underway.

2061
02:41:35,700 --> 02:41:37,700
When are you going to do your own show?

2062
02:41:37,700 --> 02:41:39,700
As soon as I actually have a definitive schedule.

2063
02:41:39,700 --> 02:41:41,700
Sounds good to me.

2064
02:41:41,700 --> 02:41:42,700
Yes.

2065
02:41:42,700 --> 02:41:43,700
Alright, you have a good one, Jason. Thanks for calling.

2066
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:44,700
Goodbye, sir.

2067
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:45,700
Later.

2068
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:46,700
Bye.

2069
02:41:46,700 --> 02:41:50,700
Alright, that was fun. That's going to be a fun program to start using when we figure

2070
02:41:50,700 --> 02:42:00,060
out how to do it. But get on board right now. Skype.org. Oh, so people are posting the link

2071
02:42:00,060 --> 02:42:04,340
in the chat room. We're going to get a user account made just for Orange Lounge and figure

2072
02:42:04,340 --> 02:42:08,500
something out. Oh yeah, you did make one a while back, didn't you? Yes, ma'am?

2073
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:16,180
I just wanted to make a quick statement. I apologize for going into the whole political

2074
02:42:16,180 --> 02:42:26,180
rant earlier. I try not to do it. I have my own elaborate conspiracy theory about all

2075
02:42:26,180 --> 02:42:28,980
of that, and if anyone would like to hear it, just PM me about it later. I won't bring

2076
02:42:28,980 --> 02:42:36,420
it up on the show again. I just wanted to mention.

2077
02:42:36,420 --> 02:42:44,340
Alright. Let's see. Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge. I'm trying to find my Ask

2078
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:48,060
Orange Lounge music now that we can actually do the music on beat I can't

2079
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:53,380

2080
02:42:53,380 --> 02:42:57,780
questions that were sent to you I'm sorry sent to us by you for any of our

2081
02:42:57,780 --> 02:43:00,700
hosts you can ask us anything you want what's on your mind what do you want to

2082
02:43:00,700 --> 02:43:03,420
talk about here we go

2083
02:43:07,020 --> 02:43:12,780
let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question what will we find out this week

2084
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:17,400
on orange lamp on trade do I don't know what we'll learn the questions are

2085
02:43:17,400 --> 02:43:21,740
probably pretty dumb but all I know is I feel great because now I can sing and

2086
02:43:21,740 --> 02:43:34,680
sink number one question evil Naoki to DX when is the next time you'll be in

2087
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:38,760
San Francisco it's been over a year since I last seen you guys when you pay

2088
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:45,560
for the trip? Actually, I want to, um, go to, like, Dave & Busters in Mopedis. I know

2089
02:43:45,560 --> 02:43:48,600
it's not San Francisco, but I really want to go to D&B again. Oh my god, I want to.

2090
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:54,600
A certain host has a certain birthday coming up with a certain power crash, um, anniversary.

2091
02:43:54,600 --> 02:43:59,680
You know, that's like six weeks away. I wanna go now. I wanna go when I get back from, uh,

2092
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:02,400
East Coast.

2093
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:06,640
We should celebrate the return of Rob with booze.

2094
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:10,320
I want a going away party and a coming back party.

2095
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:13,640
What was that game that you played that was the really

2096
02:44:13,640 --> 02:44:18,240
gay name? It was right behind our table

2097
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:22,360
on my birthday. Flaming finger. Yeah, that was great.

2098
02:44:22,360 --> 02:44:25,680
Alright, moving on. You should win on that again.

2099
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:30,360
Oh my god, Dave and Busters is having an I love the 90s viewing party all this week,

2100
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:31,360
says SharkSkrull.

2101
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:32,360
We need to go.

2102
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:33,360
What a cool.

2103
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:34,360
I said I'll be gone.

2104
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:35,360
Cry.

2105
02:44:35,360 --> 02:44:36,360
This week?

2106
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:39,840
Yeah, I love the 90s started today.

2107
02:44:39,840 --> 02:44:45,140
Beautiful.

2108
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:46,140
Dead air, fun.

2109
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:49,620
I was just sending a private message to a buddy.

2110
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:54,620
John Field says, I know this really isn't Bamani, oh I'm sorry, number two question!

2111
02:44:54,620 --> 02:44:58,820
I know this isn't really Bamani related anyway, but did you see the end of Season 2 of Red

2112
02:44:58,820 --> 02:44:59,820
vs. Blue?

2113
02:44:59,820 --> 02:45:01,420
And if you did, what did you think of it?

2114
02:45:01,420 --> 02:45:02,780
I need to go watch those.

2115
02:45:02,780 --> 02:45:07,940
I haven't watched anything since the last season of Red vs. Blue.

2116
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:10,700
Red vs. Blue is awesome.

2117
02:45:10,700 --> 02:45:11,700
What is it?

2118
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:12,700
I don't even know.

2119
02:45:12,700 --> 02:45:17,220
It's these funny movies that they did with using the Halo engine.

2120
02:45:17,220 --> 02:45:19,020
Oh, I have heard of that.

2121
02:45:19,020 --> 02:45:20,020
They're great.

2122
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:21,020
I've gotten the first DVD.

2123
02:45:21,020 --> 02:45:22,020
Oh.

2124
02:45:22,020 --> 02:45:27,020
Oh! So she can just download all of them off the internet. Didn't Microsoft, like, start actually paying them to do it?

2125
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:38,020
Yeah! They, like, thought it was awesome. Well, it's really cool. Um, if you go into GameStop, um, their Xbox demos, the little cutscenes in between are from our, uh, the Red vs. Blue guys.

2126
02:45:38,020 --> 02:45:44,020
Interesting. Maybe we should talk more good things about Xbox and they'll hire us to do, you know, something.

2127
02:45:44,020 --> 02:45:51,020
DDR UltraMix is great. You should go buy an Xbox today and play it. It's so much fun.

2128
02:45:51,020 --> 02:45:55,020
I wish everybody listening could see the expression on your face.

2129
02:45:55,020 --> 02:46:00,020
You looked constipated. It was great.

2130
02:46:00,020 --> 02:46:04,020
Number three question.

2131
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:08,020
Flair O'Nai wants to know, you guys always make a bunch of general comments about your work.

2132
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:11,020
Where do you guys work exactly?

2133
02:46:11,020 --> 02:46:12,020
I'm not telling.

2134
02:46:12,020 --> 02:46:15,540
Yeah, we're not going to tell exactly where we work, but we can tell what kind of work

2135
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:16,540
we do.

2136
02:46:16,540 --> 02:46:18,580
I work for a student loan lender.

2137
02:46:18,580 --> 02:46:23,140
A very big student loan lender, owned by a very big bank.

2138
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:24,260
Okay.

2139
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:30,500
I work for a, I'm a corporate trainer for a very large health insurance company.

2140
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:31,940
Not very large, but somewhat big.

2141
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:34,860
I work in customer service.

2142
02:46:34,860 --> 02:46:37,060
It's big in this state, but probably not where you live.

2143
02:46:37,060 --> 02:46:38,060
Uh, Logie.

2144
02:46:38,060 --> 02:46:39,060
Wait, one thing.

2145
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:40,060
Yes.

2146
02:46:40,060 --> 02:46:50,060
I sit and read the internet. That's all I do.

2147
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:52,060
He's a jizz mopper.

2148
02:46:52,060 --> 02:47:05,060
I am not a jizz mopper. I talk to stupid people. Mostly stupid people in the midwest because they're extraordinary stupid. Especially the people that work at video stores there.

2149
02:47:05,060 --> 02:47:19,060
God, they're so stupid. Yeah. Anyways, yeah, I work in the video industry. The movie industry. I get free movies.

2150
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:33,060
To answer John Fields real quick, the federal government doesn't freaking care where you work. You still have to fill out your FAFSA to get your student loan.

2151
02:47:33,060 --> 02:47:37,620
Even if you work for the IRS, you still have to pay your taxes every year, believe it or

2152
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:38,620
not.

2153
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:39,620
Damn it, I know.

2154
02:47:39,620 --> 02:47:43,620
And I'm going to be taking out my student loans through where I work because, you know,

2155
02:47:43,620 --> 02:47:47,300
not necessarily that I'll get a better deal on it, it's just I simply know how the processes

2156
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:48,300
are.

2157
02:47:48,300 --> 02:47:50,460
You go in there and tweak your account, no?

2158
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:55,480
No, I wouldn't do that, but you still...

2159
02:47:55,480 --> 02:48:02,340
The FAFSA, if you've never done your own FAFSA, I recommend do it because it asks for all

2160
02:48:02,340 --> 02:48:06,740
of this information, it looks for the crap on your income tax, and it doesn't give a

2161
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:13,420
shit where you work. It just asks how much money you made. And that is all.

2162
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:15,780
Alright. Next question.

2163
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:22,140
Next question. Number four question, also from Flareon A. Also, without one promo where

2164
02:48:22,140 --> 02:48:25,460
if you don't listen to Orange Lounge too often you get killed by an assassin through the

2165
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:28,700
computer, does it say seven days at the end? Yes, it does.

2166
02:48:28,700 --> 02:48:30,940
Yes. If so, is that in reference to the crappy

2167
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:06,940
which is really good. Anyway, I had this whole big fandom for the ring going on for a while.

2168
02:49:06,940 --> 02:49:15,940
Okay. Let's see, moving on. Damn, I thought that was a question. Oh, here we go. Number

2169
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:23,940
five question from Jason. Which new consumer style do you want to see first? GITADORA 5

2170
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:31,940
5.4, Poppin' 10, 2DX8, or a new DDR?

2171
02:49:31,940 --> 02:49:39,940
I'd have to say in order. I really want 2DX8, and then, um, guitar dota, um, 5.4, and then

2172
02:49:39,940 --> 02:49:45,940
Poppin'. Just because I, you know, well, I didn't buy Poppin' 9, which I probably should've,

2173
02:49:45,940 --> 02:49:52,940
but, um, Dan has just been goin' off wantin' new Guitar Freaks Drummania. And I have two

2174
02:49:52,940 --> 02:49:59,580
guitar freaks controller or is it a drum mania controller collecting dust in my house?

2175
02:49:59,580 --> 02:50:06,580
I actually put a new DDR at the top of my list and then I would say 2DX8, Popn10, Guitadora

2176
02:50:06,580 --> 02:50:10,460
5-4. I don't really collect the guitar freaks and drum mania at home. I think it's good

2177
02:50:10,460 --> 02:50:14,980
for other people. I really want them all to come out. So we'll see. But I want a new DDR

2178
02:50:14,980 --> 02:50:20,980
above everything else. I want a new keyboard mania! That's what I want. And another pada

2179
02:50:20,980 --> 02:50:29,980
Alright, sorry, I'm trying to get set up on something here.

2180
02:50:29,980 --> 02:50:30,980
Puppy has a question.

2181
02:50:30,980 --> 02:50:32,900
Number six question.

2182
02:50:32,900 --> 02:50:36,740
Would you believe that my little brother got a job working at a TAP-X in my hometown?

2183
02:50:36,740 --> 02:50:37,740
Because he did.

2184
02:50:37,740 --> 02:50:39,020
Those things are starting to pop up everywhere.

2185
02:50:39,020 --> 02:50:40,440
They seriously are.

2186
02:50:40,440 --> 02:50:43,380
I wish one would open up near here.

2187
02:50:43,380 --> 02:50:50,460
I went to the TAP-X down off of Sutterville and they are really nice.

2188
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:55,280
have a big widescreen TV and they let you change the channels on it, and then they have

2189
02:50:55,280 --> 02:50:59,000
a PlayStation hooked up to it, a PS2 hooked up to it, so you can play whatever games they

2190
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:12,000
have there. And, if you pay $5 a month, you can use their broadband service. A wireless

2191
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,360
take one call before the end of the show if you anything you want to talk about

2192
02:51:44,360 --> 02:51:49,960
in regards to tonight's show username orange lounge radio all one word orange

2193
02:51:49,960 --> 02:51:57,580
lounge radio and by the way in answer to John Fields it is $5 a month to use the

2194
02:51:57,580 --> 02:52:02,640
broadband at their at their tap X we do get another question real fast while we

2195
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:06,880
wait for a call to come through on the skyline black lab wants to know what is

2196
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:18,600
favorite Pokemon of you? Number seven question. I used to like Togepi a whole lot. But I liked

2197
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:25,560
Porygon because it made all the children have seizures. Jigglypuff was my favorite. Absolutely.

2198
02:52:25,560 --> 02:52:41,880
Um, man, um, my favorite would have to be Heart Attack Squirrel.

2199
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:47,640
I liked in Evangelion Redeath how they had the giant, real, geeky Pikachu battle.

2200
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:50,080
And then Fanboy Bebop Penis!

2201
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:58,080
There's a fan animation that somebody did that, instead of Pikachu, was Fuckachu.

2202
02:52:58,080 --> 02:53:06,080
And it's actually about the human Pokemon, though, but I have to get it from my friend and show it to you. It's really funny.

2203
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:12,080
I need to see Redeath and Fanboy Devop again. I need to get a copy of Nescaflowney.

2204
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:16,080
I can't understand why these movies have not made their way onto the internet.

2205
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:17,080
Nescaflowney, yes.

2206
02:53:17,080 --> 02:53:18,080
Nescaflowney.

2207
02:53:18,080 --> 02:53:25,920
Flonie well I've got fanboy bebop cool I have I also have the cutscenes from

2208
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:31,720
fanboy bebop to with the it's gendo scene didn't they play those I thought

2209
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:40,280
they play those at the very end like after the credits yeah I did have a jube

2210
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:45,480
powers international Japanese man of intercourse I hated that it was it has

2211
02:53:45,480 --> 02:53:52,440
funny scenes. They need to make a Gendo movie. The It's Gendo movie? It's Gendo the movie.

2212
02:53:52,440 --> 02:53:59,040
Did you hear what I snuck in on the pre-show? The Misato. Yeah. I have two breasteses. No.

2213
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:04,400
I won. The two. I swear they changed the dialogue in that because I thought there was one that

2214
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:11,960
was like a part that said shut up Shinzi and then they changed it to no. No. No it looks

2215
02:54:11,960 --> 02:54:16,960
It looks like that as far as I've seen it, because I saw it at Fanime when they played it.

2216
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:20,960
Oh well. Nobody likes this, oh well.

2217
02:54:20,960 --> 02:54:26,960
I don't think enough people have gotten Skype yet, because we just said it like ten minutes ago, we're going to be using this, and I don't think a lot of people even have this program yet.

2218
02:54:26,960 --> 02:54:28,960
I have another parody you might like.

2219
02:54:28,960 --> 02:54:29,960
But we'll see what happens, huh?

2220
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:32,960
Voltron Hellbent for Leather.

2221
02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:35,960
What?

2222
02:54:35,960 --> 02:54:40,960
It's really old, but I'll have to copy it for you.

2223
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:42,960
You guys are crazy.

2224
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:49,960
Alright, we got some people saying they're gonna call in, they're trying to install the program now.

2225
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:53,960
We only got time to take like one or two calls, so if you don't get through this week, um, definitely we can do-

2226
02:54:53,960 --> 02:54:56,960
Do we have any more waiting for us via private message?

2227
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:58,960
We don't have any other questions waiting private message, so I'm just gonna-

2228
02:54:58,960 --> 02:54:59,960
I have a message?

2229
02:54:59,960 --> 02:55:00,960
Yes.

2230
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:02,960
Why are we so damn cool?

2231
02:55:04,960 --> 02:55:06,960
Haven't you missed doing the show, though?

2232
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:09,960
Yes, I've missed-

2233
02:55:09,960 --> 02:55:14,960
No, finally, we're getting a damn call. Let's see, I don't even know...

2234
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:24,960
I don't even know how to answer the damn call. It's not coming up on the screen.

2235
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:27,960
I think I just hung up on whoever was calling.

2236
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:28,960
We're sorry.

2237
02:55:28,960 --> 02:55:32,960
I need to actually change something here in my options real fast because it's trying to...

2238
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:35,960
Holy crap, it's Zaku.

2239
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:56,960
I'm trying to have it not switch. No, I'm trying to make sure it doesn't switch. Hold on, I'm actually going to disable calls for a second, because I don't want people to call just yet, because what it's doing is switching our input, which is fucking up our thing going out. Hold on, I'll fix it. Sorry, guys.

2240
02:55:56,960 --> 02:55:58,960
Amy, help me fill time.

2241
02:55:59,960 --> 02:56:01,960
Fill time? Well...

2242
02:56:01,960 --> 02:56:03,960
I could rant.

2243
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:05,960
Or we could listen to the ferret.

2244
02:56:05,960 --> 02:56:09,960
Okay, I got it fixed. We can take a call now.

2245
02:56:09,960 --> 02:56:11,960
I knew the ferret would get you motivated.

2246
02:56:11,960 --> 02:56:15,960
For some reason, the last person that called, I did not get the answer button when you called.

2247
02:56:15,960 --> 02:56:17,960
So make sure we're on your buddy list, I guess.

2248
02:56:17,960 --> 02:56:19,960
Maybe? I don't know.

2249
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:22,960
Oh, maybe you did.

2250
02:56:22,960 --> 02:56:24,960
Let's see if I can do it.

2251
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:26,960
Okay, we're getting a call now.

2252
02:56:27,960 --> 02:56:28,960
I can't answer it!

2253
02:56:30,960 --> 02:56:31,960
It's not letting me answer it.

2254
02:56:33,960 --> 02:56:35,960
Okay, let me see if I can change it from friends only.

2255
02:56:35,960 --> 02:56:36,960
There we go!

2256
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:37,960
There, I got it.

2257
02:56:37,960 --> 02:56:38,960
Hello?

2258
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:41,960
Hello?

2259
02:56:41,960 --> 02:56:42,960
You're on Orange Lounge?

2260
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:43,960
Yes.

2261
02:56:43,960 --> 02:56:44,960
Who is this?

2262
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:46,960
It's, uh, the Evil Naoki 2DX.

2263
02:56:46,960 --> 02:56:48,960
Hello, Evil Naoki 2DX! Naoki.

2264
02:56:48,960 --> 02:56:49,960
Yes, hello.

2265
02:56:49,960 --> 02:56:50,960
How you doin'?

2266
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:51,960
I'm alright.

2267
02:56:51,960 --> 02:56:53,960

2275
02:57:18,740 --> 02:57:21,720
station make sure you put your wind up down because there is about a 30-second

2276
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:22,540
delay between

2277
02:57:22,540 --> 02:57:25,460
us talking to you and then just like real radio

2278
02:57:25,460 --> 02:57:29,660

2284
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:58,620
Um, just to Angel and, uh, DarklineXVI and anyone else who wants a shoutout, here's my shoutout.

2285
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:00,620
That's very kind of you.

2286
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:01,620
Oh, and, uh, Rob?

2287
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:02,620
Yes.

2288
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:07,620
When are you coming to my house in a French maid outfit?

2289
02:58:07,620 --> 02:58:09,620
Promise me back at Reticon.

2290
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:14,620
When I can afford a French maid outfit, I will come in my French maid outfit.

2291
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:15,620
Oh, you're so kind.

2292
02:58:15,620 --> 02:58:16,620
I know.

2293
02:58:16,620 --> 02:58:17,620
Alright, I'm gonna let you go so we can take one more call before we leave.

2294
02:58:17,620 --> 02:58:19,620
no more call before we leave. Okay. Alright. Take care, bud.

2295
02:58:19,620 --> 02:58:21,040
See you guys later. Thanks, bye.

2296
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:24,800
Okay, if anyone else wants to call in a comment on any of tonight's topics,

2297
02:58:24,800 --> 02:58:26,160
Skype-Line is open for you guys.

2298
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:31,460
Username orange-lounge-radio-skype.org is the program you gotta get.

2299
02:58:31,460 --> 02:58:34,700
Brand new thing we're rolling out tonight, the Skype line.

2300
02:58:34,700 --> 02:58:36,620
So we'll wait and see if anybody else wants to give us a call.

2301
02:58:36,620 --> 02:58:38,600
That just sounds cool, the Skype line. I know.

2302
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:44,540
It should like be like 1-900-HOT-SKYPE. I think it's very smart.

2303
02:58:44,540 --> 02:58:48,780
You know what's kind of neat about this is supposedly we can dial out, too, using this

2304
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:52,740
thing, but I don't know how well that works. We could try calling my cell phone and see

2305
02:58:52,740 --> 02:58:53,740
what happens.

2306
02:58:53,740 --> 02:58:58,820
Alright, we're getting a call. Hold on. Orange Lounge Radio.

2307
02:58:58,820 --> 02:59:01,900
Hello, it's me, Darkline XBI.

2308
02:59:01,900 --> 02:59:02,900
Turn down your wing amp.

2309
02:59:02,900 --> 02:59:05,300
Oh, hold on.

2310
02:59:05,300 --> 02:59:06,300
That's right.

2311
02:59:06,300 --> 02:59:09,860
Okay, it's down now.

2312
02:59:09,860 --> 02:59:13,180
Alright. You sound like you're calling us from a glass jar.

2313
02:59:13,180 --> 02:59:19,180
He's hanging out with the tin can lady from Solo.

2314
02:59:19,180 --> 02:59:21,180
I got to adjust my mic.

2315
02:59:21,180 --> 02:59:24,180
It's all good. You guys will have plenty of time to play around with setting stuff.

2316
02:59:24,180 --> 02:59:28,180
What's up? What's on your mind? What do you think of tonight's show? Any comments on anything?

2317
02:59:28,180 --> 02:59:30,180
It's really good, actually.

2318
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:32,180
When aren't we good? Damn, we're good.

2319
02:59:32,180 --> 02:59:34,180
We are so hot.

2320
02:59:34,180 --> 02:59:37,180
We could do TRL on Orgeland's radio.

2321
02:59:37,180 --> 02:59:39,180
Indeed.

2322
02:59:39,180 --> 02:59:42,180
I don't know if we would want to, but we could, so...

2323
02:59:42,180 --> 02:59:46,180
What's better than real radio?

2324
02:59:46,180 --> 02:59:50,180
How can I get multiple calls there? That was weird.

2325
02:59:50,180 --> 02:59:54,180
I'm gonna have to play with the settings myself on this end. Everything's still in beta, so we'll figure it out.

2326
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:58,180
Anything else you want to say? Any shout-outs?

2327
02:59:58,180 --> 03:00:02,180
Well, I would like to make a shout-out to Rich, Evil Naoki, 2DX, and all of the

2328
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:06,180
2DX community here in Vegas.

2329
03:00:06,180 --> 03:00:10,180
Oh, Vegas! I gotta go back to Vegas someday.

2330
03:00:10,180 --> 03:00:12,180
We need to see Maron-chan.

2331
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:14,180
Yeah, there's a lot of folks that listen to us.

2332
03:00:14,180 --> 03:00:15,180
Why do you guys come into Vegas?

2333
03:00:15,180 --> 03:00:17,180
We need to go to the Adult Entertainment Expo.

2334
03:00:19,180 --> 03:00:22,180
Yeah, we'll be down there for Adult Entertainment Expo sometime.

2335
03:00:22,180 --> 03:00:26,180
Yeah, but we won't be there for Classic Gaming Expo because they moved that to San Jose.

2336
03:00:26,180 --> 03:00:28,180
Yeah, oh, I definitely want to go to Classic Gaming Expo this year.

2337
03:00:28,180 --> 03:00:29,180
Oh, yeah.

2338
03:00:29,180 --> 03:00:30,180
We'll see.

2339
03:00:30,180 --> 03:00:31,180
All right, we're going to have to let you go.

2340
03:00:31,180 --> 03:00:32,180
You know what, though?

2341
03:00:32,180 --> 03:00:37,180
I just realized that you sent me that story about the American Idol style thing they're doing.

2342
03:00:37,180 --> 03:00:38,180
Oh, yeah, I sent you that.

2343
03:00:38,180 --> 03:00:42,180
And I totally forgot to bring it up tonight. I'll send it to Jamie to talk about next week.

2344
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:44,180
By the way, it's already gone.

2345
03:00:44,180 --> 03:00:45,180
Oh, is it?

2346
03:00:45,180 --> 03:00:47,180
Yeah. They don't have the links.

2347
03:00:47,180 --> 03:00:51,180
That sucks. All right, well, it was worth a try.

2348
03:00:51,180 --> 03:00:52,180
All right, thanks for calling in, dude.

2349
03:00:52,180 --> 03:00:53,180
Yeah, my pleasure.

2350
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:54,180
Take it easy.

2351
03:00:54,180 --> 03:00:55,180
Bye.

2352
03:00:55,180 --> 03:00:56,180
Bye.

2353
03:00:56,180 --> 03:00:59,180
See, this is pretty cool now that we can take calls. I'm liking this.

2354
03:00:59,180 --> 03:01:05,180
All right, that's it. We're going to have to go ahead and close the Skype line for tonight.

2355
03:01:05,180 --> 03:01:09,040
And supposedly you can call actual phone numbers, we'll see how that works later.

2356
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:11,300
But we're going to end the show for now, because we're running over a little bit.

2357
03:01:11,300 --> 03:01:14,300
Maybe we'll take a call in the afterbirth or something, that'd be fun.

2358
03:01:14,300 --> 03:01:15,300
Maybe.

2359
03:01:15,300 --> 03:01:16,300
Maybe.

2360
03:01:16,300 --> 03:01:18,100
Alright, but we've got to end the show, so goodnight everybody, thank you very much for

2361
03:01:18,100 --> 03:01:21,660
listening, thank you for supporting Orange Lawn's radio, please help us out, listen to

2362
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:24,000
our Bomani Music and More program, whore up our ratings.

2363
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,140
And send us money.

2364
03:01:25,140 --> 03:01:29,060
Listen to Jamie's show, which will be on- Oh, oh, oh, oh, that reminds me.

2365
03:01:29,060 --> 03:01:30,060
Yes.

2366
03:01:30,060 --> 03:01:34,500
I'm still trying to implement this, I'm doing Dark Sakura email, sort of like Strong Bad

2367
03:01:34,500 --> 03:01:41,960
email but not. And so, I'm taking either private messages to me on orangechallengeradio.com

2368
03:01:41,960 --> 03:01:50,420
as darksacra or to darksacra at gmail.com. Go ahead and send me your email and I will

2369
03:01:50,420 --> 03:01:56,860
answer them on the show and totally berate you, but not really. We'll see what happens.

2370
03:01:56,860 --> 03:02:00,220
Just wanted to make a mention.

2371
03:02:00,220 --> 03:02:11,580
Okay, um, I guess that's it. We're done. Oh god, final thoughts. Jamie, your final thought.

2372
03:02:11,580 --> 03:02:14,420
My final thought is Skype Line.

2373
03:02:14,420 --> 03:02:18,020
That sounds so hot, Rob.

2374
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:19,020
Loki's not here.

2375
03:02:19,020 --> 03:02:20,340
Loki's final thought is potty.

2376
03:02:20,340 --> 03:02:25,900
Yeah, Loki's final thought is potty. And the final word of the show, I guess I'll have

2377

2381
03:02:57,900 --> 03:03:01,900
And now today's Ebonics language lesson.

2382
03:03:01,900 --> 03:03:02,900
Meeting girls.

2383
03:03:02,900 --> 03:03:05,900
My, you're a lovely young lady.

2384
03:03:05,900 --> 03:03:08,900
Damn, you's a fine motherf***er.

2385
03:03:08,900 --> 03:03:11,900
Damn, you's a fine motherf***er.

2386
03:03:11,900 --> 03:03:13,900
Let's go for a ride, shall we?

2387
03:03:13,900 --> 03:03:17,900
Hey baby, jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.

2388
03:03:17,900 --> 03:03:22,900
Hey baby, let's jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.

2389
03:03:22,900 --> 03:03:24,240
You are beautiful.

2390
03:03:24,240 --> 03:03:26,360
I would like to make love to you.

2391
03:03:26,360 --> 03:03:28,780
Damn bitch, you stupid fly.

2392
03:03:28,780 --> 03:03:31,820
Let me pull up to that bumper and smack that monkey.

2393
03:03:31,820 --> 03:03:34,060
Damn bitch, you stupid fly.

2394
03:03:34,060 --> 03:03:37,540
Let me pull up to your bumper and smack that monkey.

2395
03:03:37,540 --> 03:03:39,460
Greeting old friends.

2396
03:03:39,460 --> 03:03:40,660
Hello, sir.

2397
03:03:40,660 --> 03:03:42,900
What up, dog?

2398
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:45,660
What up, dog?

2399
03:03:45,660 --> 03:03:47,660
May I borrow some money?

2400
03:03:47,660 --> 03:03:50,860
Hey, let me hold some ends. I'll hit you back on the first, my brother.

2401
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:55,360
Hey, let me hold some ends. I will hit you back on the first, my brother.

2402
03:03:55,360 --> 03:03:58,560
You don't have it? Thanks anyway.

2403
03:03:58,560 --> 03:04:01,860
F*** you!

2404
03:04:01,860 --> 03:04:05,260
Making new friends. Hello, sir.

2405
03:04:05,260 --> 03:04:11,460
What up? What up? I admire your fashionable running shoes.

2406
03:04:11,460 --> 03:04:15,360
Drop them Nike's off your ass before I blast you, motherf***er!

2407
03:04:15,360 --> 03:04:20,360
Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherfucker!

2408
03:04:20,360 --> 03:04:24,360
I used to be a stuck-up white boy faking the funk. Bump that!

2409
03:04:24,360 --> 03:04:31,360
I ain't bullshitting on Front Street no more, thanks to the Wake Up Crew's Ebonics language lesson.

2410
03:04:31,360 --> 03:04:34,360
Available in a hood near you!

2411
03:04:34,360 --> 03:05:02,360
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2412
03:05:04,360 --> 03:05:20,760
Alright, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio, the after birth, here it is, this is the part

2413
03:05:20,760 --> 03:05:24,720
after the credits have come and gone, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line

2414
03:05:24,720 --> 03:05:27,160
some more, you guys want to play on that for a minute, so we'll...

2415
03:05:27,160 --> 03:05:28,360
Damn bitch, you stupid...

2416
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:31,080
That was a great fortune cookie message, I mean not that...

2417
03:05:31,080 --> 03:05:33,920
I hadn't had that a long time ago and I finally bothered to get it.

2418
03:05:33,920 --> 03:05:36,640
I played it on my show once.

2419
03:05:36,640 --> 03:05:39,280
That's good, I like it.

2420
03:05:39,280 --> 03:05:43,220
Can we set up voicemail on it? Possibly. I think it would be cool if we could, because then we just leave it up

2421
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:48,420
all day and people could send us their refuse with voice.

2422
03:05:48,420 --> 03:05:54,360
Maybe, maybe it's something they're going to do in a little bit, I don't know.

2423
03:05:54,360 --> 03:05:57,660
Alright, so we'll see if

2424
03:05:57,660 --> 03:06:00,880
we get any calls.

2425
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:04,880
Nobody loves us. Actually, we're going to put details up on the website of exactly how you can call the show.

2426
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:08,880
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.

2427
03:06:08,880 --> 03:06:12,880
Otherwise, is there anything else you guys wanted to add?

2428
03:06:12,880 --> 03:06:16,880
What up, dog?

2429
03:06:16,880 --> 03:06:20,880
I need to find a computer case with, like, very specific

2430
03:06:20,880 --> 03:06:24,880
specifications. Like, I need...it has to be, like, about, eh, 13

2431
03:06:24,880 --> 03:06:28,880
to 14 inches wide and about 17 inches long.

2432
03:06:28,880 --> 03:06:41,880
Height is not a factor. But I'm looking at the micro ATX cases, and they're like, they're too small, and the normal ATX cases are too big. It's just I can't win.

2433
03:06:41,880 --> 03:06:59,880
Um, but I don't know, maybe if I could find an ATX case that was, you know, really, uh, short, that might work, but, um, I just, basically what I'm doing is I need to install, um, pretty much just, um, I don't know, I might be able to do it in a normal case.

2434
03:06:59,880 --> 03:07:06,040
Um, cause I need enough room to install the extra, um, ports for, cause there's, on a

2435
03:07:06,040 --> 03:07:10,960
normal DDR machine you've got like, you know, um, your standard, like a JAMA cable and four

2436
03:07:10,960 --> 03:07:16,840
other smaller, um, five pin cables that get plugged in there, cause it needs more than

2437
03:07:16,840 --> 03:07:18,920
just the JAMA, um, stuff.

2438
03:07:18,920 --> 03:07:24,620
So I need to add those extra ports onto the PC, and then I need to have, like, the, um,

2439
03:07:24,620 --> 03:07:32,860
There's a monitor, like a video converter card or something, a small PC board that I

2440
03:07:32,860 --> 03:07:34,120
need to get.

2441
03:07:34,120 --> 03:07:37,100
So I need to have that all inside a case.

2442
03:07:37,100 --> 03:07:44,860
And it's just kind of tough to get a case to hold all that without having to mod one

2443
03:07:44,860 --> 03:07:52,860
or having to make one, so yeah, I don't know.

2444
03:07:52,860 --> 03:07:57,860
Well, I was waiting for somebody to call, but I guess it's not going to happen.

2445
03:07:57,860 --> 03:07:59,860
Guess not. I don't know.

2446
03:07:59,860 --> 03:08:00,860
Oh, well.

2447
03:08:00,860 --> 03:08:02,860
I thought somebody said they were going to call.

2448
03:08:02,860 --> 03:08:04,860
There was that one chick, Misty, that said...

2449
03:08:04,860 --> 03:08:08,860
Well, yeah, but I didn't think she had a mic. Let me see.

2450
03:08:08,860 --> 03:08:10,860
Oh.

2451
03:08:10,860 --> 03:08:14,860
Well, the person who was going to call us is having technical problems, so I guess we'll just have to try again next week.

2452
03:08:14,860 --> 03:08:18,860
Thank you, everybody, for listening. I went ahead and closed the Skype line for now.

2453
03:08:18,860 --> 03:08:22,020
um... and we're gonna do a post show tonight

2454
03:08:22,020 --> 03:08:25,220
uh... but i don't know what music i wanna do. How about um...

2455
03:08:25,220 --> 03:08:27,560
I like this uh...

2456
03:08:27,560 --> 03:08:31,500
those compilations that I've been downloading recently, the Ministry of Sound stuff

2457
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:35,580
I know you've got a lot of that on your computer, but I like it too. We should listen to the whole

2458
03:08:35,580 --> 03:08:37,000
uh...

2459
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:38,860
the whole v-rare CD

2460
03:08:38,860 --> 03:08:39,640
for

2461
03:08:39,640 --> 03:08:44,260
E.A. Damion. Uh, no we shouldn't.

2462
03:08:44,260 --> 03:08:48,220
You know, I was just looking at Alienware's site. They have like small, mid-sized business

2463
03:08:48,220 --> 03:08:53,340
computers? Who the fuck would buy Alienware computers for business? I mean, you can't

2464
03:08:53,340 --> 03:08:57,860
even look professional with this little alien head on there and shit. I don't know, I guess

2465
03:08:57,860 --> 03:09:06,940
it beats cow print or whatever. All right, we will see you guys later. Thanks a lot for

2466
03:09:06,940 --> 03:09:10,940
listening. Enjoy this random mix of stuff mixed together by Ministry Sound. There's

2467
03:09:10,940 --> 03:09:13,780
a lot of good DDR sounding stuff in here and stuff you've probably heard in a cage match

2468
03:09:13,780 --> 03:09:17,800
before. Have a great night, you guys. Thanks for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge

2497
03:13:37,900 --> 03:13:47,900
Can you tell, tell me how to convince you Please come back

2498
03:13:47,900 --> 03:13:54,900
I won't let you down, I won't let you down

2499
03:13:58,900 --> 03:14:06,900
I can't let you go, why can't you stay?

2500
03:14:06,900 --> 03:14:12,900
I still wonder why

2501
03:14:12,900 --> 03:14:30,900
I can't let you go. Why can't you stay? Give it one more try. I can't let you go.

2502
03:14:30,900 --> 03:14:44,900
I can't let you go

2503
03:14:44,900 --> 03:15:12,900
And I hope, one day you will forgive me If I could, I would turn back time

2504
03:15:12,900 --> 03:15:28,900
Would you know that I'm thinking about you If you knew, would you change your mind, would you change your mind?

2505
03:15:28,900 --> 03:15:40,900
I can't let you go, why can't you stay?

2506
03:15:40,900 --> 03:15:50,900
I still wonder why, I can't let you go

2507
03:15:50,900 --> 03:16:00,900

03:16:18,900 --> 03:16:20,900
Oh

2510
03:18:18,900 --> 03:18:32,900
Where am I now, I am looking but can't see ahead

2511
03:18:32,900 --> 03:18:38,900
Lost in this space, there's a voice calling out in my head

2512
03:18:38,900 --> 03:18:46,900
I'm passing my faces that I have been known never seen

2513
03:18:46,900 --> 03:18:52,900
Keep on looking and asking where have you been

2514
03:18:53,900 --> 03:18:59,900
I'm falling away, I am lost in the wilderness

2515
03:19:00,900 --> 03:19:06,900
I'm falling away on the wind I'm afraid

2516
03:19:07,900 --> 03:19:13,900
I'm travelling through, riding high into paradise

2517
03:19:13,900 --> 03:19:21,900
And all I can see is wilderness

2518
03:19:21,900 --> 03:19:28,900
I'm falling away, I am lost in a wilderness

2519
03:19:28,900 --> 03:19:35,900
I'm falling away on the wing of a friend

2520
03:19:35,900 --> 03:19:42,900
I'm traveling through, riding high into paradise

2521
03:19:42,900 --> 03:19:48,900
And all I can see is wilderness

2522
03:19:50,900 --> 03:19:56,900
I'm falling away, I am lost in the wilderness

2523
03:19:57,900 --> 03:20:03,900
I'm falling away, all the way back away

2524
03:20:04,900 --> 03:20:10,900
I'm traveling through, riding high, if you have to die

2525
03:20:10,900 --> 03:20:16,900
And all I can see, it will remain

2526
03:20:16,900 --> 03:20:45,900
And all I can do is will the man

2527
03:21:15,900 --> 03:21:17,900
Happyness

2528
03:21:17,900 --> 03:21:19,900
And loneliness

2529
03:21:19,900 --> 03:21:21,900
be happy
