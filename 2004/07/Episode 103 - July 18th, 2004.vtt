WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Miss forensic files really badly. I'll go through withdrawal and

00:04.080 --> 00:07.440
I miss and like everyone's now telling me that that uh

00:07.880 --> 00:13.320
At least five six people have told me that Stargate shows pretty good. So I downloaded the first episode of the

00:14.360 --> 00:18.760
Atlantis one I've got that downloading and I love Iron Chef

00:18.760 --> 00:21.520
So I've been trying to download as much Iron Chef as possible

00:21.520 --> 00:25.800
I have the liver battle and the caviar battle and the broccoli battle. They made

00:25.800 --> 00:34.340
broccoli ice cream. Oh, I need more Iron Chef. I even have one of the US ones the

00:34.340 --> 00:39.760
egg battle which I actually need to watch just to see how bad it is and I'm

00:39.760 --> 00:44.020
actually the other thing I'm downloading right now is like a Paint Shop Pro 8

00:44.020 --> 00:55.700
beta, I think. Speaking of TV, I've been watching a TV show I've been keeping up

00:55.700 --> 01:00.740
on. TV Nihon has been so gracious to have been fan-subbing these for us, but the

01:00.740 --> 01:04.940
Sailor Moon live-action show has got to be one of the greatest things ever, oh my

01:04.940 --> 01:10.380
god. Julie's been downloading it. It's hilarious. Even with the plushies. Oh my god, yeah, it's

01:10.380 --> 01:27.380
My girlfriend, who doesn't even like, you know, Rice Princess, she doesn't even, she hates Sailor Moon with a passion, but she loves this show because it's just so cheesy, like, they never, when they're fighting, instead of them fighting, they just do cartwheels around each other, and that's supposedly, we will defeat you with our cartwheels.

01:27.380 --> 01:30.380
That's almost how it is on the show itself, you know, they do the...

01:30.380 --> 01:33.700
I find it so funny that Usagi is supposed to be so

01:33.700 --> 01:37.820
clumsy, yet she can do all these elaborate poses. Yeah, all these crazy, like, cartwheels and

01:37.820 --> 01:39.220
backflips and stuff, and

01:39.220 --> 01:42.460
it's just crazy. It's so funny, too. And they, and

01:42.460 --> 01:46.220
for people who do like Sailor Moon, if there's anybody who likes Sailor Moon,

01:46.220 --> 01:51.020
like, they rewrote the script, so it's still kinda fresh and new. I mean, they have

01:51.020 --> 01:53.260
some elements from the cartoon, the original, but

01:53.260 --> 01:56.620
it kinda adds a little more, and a little more adult.

01:56.620 --> 01:59.620
Not really adult, but I guess more mature humor.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.620
I mean, there's no sex or anything.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.620
Darn.

02:04.620 --> 02:09.620
You know, we need the Haruka material action.

02:09.620 --> 02:13.620
Sailor Neptune.

02:13.620 --> 02:17.620
All right. We're going to go to a break, because we haven't been to a break for a little while now.

02:17.620 --> 02:20.620
Oh, actually, I'm sorry. We should ask Lanky Saldo since he's here.

02:20.620 --> 02:25.620
How was your week and how was your day since we were just finishing that segment up?

02:25.620 --> 02:46.620
Jeez, same as always, except I just got some new crack from Irene. I downloaded the Harry Potter game, The Prisoner of Azkaban, and she's, you know, it's so childish, but you know, for a fan, like as big of a fan as she is of Harry Potter, you know, she has to play it, so it's funny.

02:46.620 --> 02:50.920
And it's like really skipping and stuff during the dialogue, so it's so funny it'll be talking and it'll be like,

02:50.920 --> 02:51.920
What's up Harry?

02:51.920 --> 02:56.120
And it's like, it's great, it's funny.

02:56.120 --> 03:02.120
And I just bought a new graphic card, on the way here I bought a new Radeon that's gonna like,

03:02.120 --> 03:05.120
make me be able to play Halo or something, you know.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.120
Isn't your old card better than my current card?

03:08.120 --> 03:14.120
It's about the same level, I mean, yours is like basically the Nvidia equivalent of mine, but

03:14.120 --> 03:20.120
I got the new Radeon 9800, well not new, but the 9800, it's like the second best, you know, you can get.

03:20.120 --> 03:23.120
Cuz I was gonna be like, gimme!

03:23.120 --> 03:32.120
Nah, with all the problems you just went through with your gravity card, I think you should probably stick with the one you just, you know, you just finally fixed it so you can play your stupid Final Fantasy XI game.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
Yeah!

03:33.120 --> 03:36.120
Yeah, yeah! How do you like them apples?

03:36.120 --> 03:39.120
I think we need to go to a break right now.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.120
Cuz I need to have a word with Brad.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.120
Anyway, yeah, we're going to go to a break.

03:43.120 --> 03:48.120
When we come back, we'll talk about some of the monies, if we can dig any up.

03:48.120 --> 03:55.120
And of course the Cage Match, of course the FUs of the Week, Ask Orange Lounge, and the Skype Line!

03:55.120 --> 03:58.800
this when we come back from this break featuring more dance maniacs music

03:58.800 --> 04:05.800
because that's what I feel like hearing.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.800
Happy New Year!

05:58.800 --> 06:13.800
Happy month, happy month, yeah

08:13.800 --> 08:28.300
If I let life stink like it's leather-

08:34.300 --> 08:37.620
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

08:38.180 --> 08:37.820
Nooooooooooooooooo

08:40.220 --> 08:17.600
Just kidding IRR

08:17.600 --> 08:37.960
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

08:37.960 --> 08:38.960
No!

08:38.960 --> 08:41.160
Just kidding.

08:41.160 --> 08:47.240
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

08:47.240 --> 08:55.520
Welcome back boys and girls, Orange Lounge Radio, here we are, episode number 103.

08:55.520 --> 09:01.520
I wasn't supposed to be here tonight, but I was granted a reprieve, and I get to leave

09:01.520 --> 09:05.360
tomorrow instead, so I'm hoping to check out some interesting things while I'm on the east

09:05.360 --> 09:06.360
coast.

09:06.360 --> 09:11.280
We'll have to see.

09:11.280 --> 09:15.040
Loki had to do some surgery on the microphone here to get it to work right, but it's great

09:15.040 --> 09:16.040
now.

09:16.040 --> 09:20.320
jonas is fondling loki's cock

09:20.320 --> 09:23.360
oh my god did you just put loki's cock in your mouth?

09:23.360 --> 09:30.200
jonas what the hell is that?

09:30.200 --> 09:36.480
watch out or his cock will bite you, his cock is a real pecker

09:36.480 --> 09:41.480
I don't have a fan with that too.

09:41.480 --> 09:46.480
Let's not have fun with the cock.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.480
The only one you should have fun with is your own.

09:49.480 --> 09:54.480
So wait, you said you saw something local on DDR this week in the news?

09:54.480 --> 09:58.480
What did your mom say about it? I didn't see it either, I heard about it though.

09:58.480 --> 10:03.480
She basically said, DDR was on the news, they said something about people losing weight playing the game.

10:03.480 --> 10:11.360
So it was a generic interview piece that every news channel has done?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.160
Was Tonya in it?

10:13.160 --> 10:14.160
No.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.160
That's a shocker.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.160
Alright.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.440
So everything, it's just basically the same story that's been going around ever since

10:19.440 --> 10:22.160
the Associated Press thing picked it up, huh?

10:22.160 --> 10:23.160
Alright.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.160
Interesting.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.160
What?

10:25.160 --> 10:26.160
Yes?

10:26.160 --> 10:27.480
Okay, this is bullshit.

10:27.480 --> 10:33.000
The media and parents and stuff, they don't fucking care about our video games until somebody

10:33.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah, we don't make fun of them for being crack whores.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
So we don't make fun of them for being crack whores?

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Okay, what does that have to do with anything?

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Anyway, sorry, I digress.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
It's alright. I don't know, it's just the old

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
TV saying of if it bleeds, it leads, you know? If it's not

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
like a really horrible, depressing story

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
or, you know, causing violence to the streets or whatever

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
Then, you know, it's one of those pieces that save for the end of the newscast to make you feel good.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
It's an uplifting story at the end, you know.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Happy!

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Fat man, fat no more, thanks to video game. Who would have thought?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Nobody watches the news that long anyways.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
They watch the first ten minutes for all the bloody headlines and then after that they wait until sports and they're done.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
I just figured it out.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
You know how like, so they get, you know, lean, they lose weight and they get in shape

11:59.000 --> 12:01.520
from playing this game, but then, what's the deal?

12:01.520 --> 12:05.680
Konami's not releasing any more DDRs, so people are going to get bored of DDR, hold on, hold

12:05.680 --> 12:08.280
on, people are going to get bored of DDR, and they're going to stop playing and they're

12:08.280 --> 12:12.240
going to get fat again, and then they're going to sue Konami because they didn't come out

12:12.240 --> 12:16.320
with any new DDRs just like they sue like McDonald's for not, you know, for making people

12:16.320 --> 12:17.320
fat.

12:17.320 --> 12:23.280
Careful, technicality though, I know you mean no new DDR arcade, but every news story has

12:23.280 --> 12:27.000
focused on the DDR home version almost all the time but the home versions and

12:27.000 --> 12:30.640
they are coming out with two of them this summer so are not the summer but

12:30.640 --> 12:35.880
this fall so you know you can't say that too much well I can cuz I don't like it

12:35.880 --> 12:44.680
the arcade DDR was the pinnacle moment for DDR stapler wait I want my stapler

12:44.680 --> 12:49.680
Okay, Loki, yes, you have something to say.

12:49.680 --> 12:57.200
Okay, I saw another video this week of In the Groove, and I have to say it doesn't look

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
that bad.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.200
What?

12:59.200 --> 13:00.200
This coming from you?

13:00.200 --> 13:03.840
It doesn't look, well here's the problem, no, here's the thing though, here's the thing

13:03.840 --> 13:09.080
though, is before I saw early shots of In the Groove, and they've developed a lot further

13:09.080 --> 13:14.060
since, no, when I saw it, it actually looks pretty decent, wouldn't mind it actually coming

13:14.060 --> 13:18.580
into an arcade except, you know, I mean, look at what the options are out there right now.

13:18.580 --> 13:23.300
You have two fucking bootlegs floating around. One's a miscolored DDR Extreme and the other

13:23.300 --> 13:29.180
one's like a DDR Extreme with like this overclocking on it, which is stupid. But, you know, I'd

13:29.180 --> 13:34.580
rather play in the groove than that shit. So, you know, hey, bring it in. Don't spend

13:34.580 --> 13:39.740
the $650 on these bootlegs and bring in the groove. I mean, it actually doesn't look that

13:39.740 --> 13:43.980
bad. The interface is pretty nice. I like what they've done with it so far.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.580
This is a real change of heart. If this is your first time listening to Orange on its

13:46.580 --> 13:50.820
Radio, honestly, Loki would have never, ever said this before. So this is why I'm like

13:50.820 --> 13:54.520
shocked. I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. Now, I understand why there

13:54.520 --> 14:00.420
are some songs in there that the difficulty is way fucking hard. But you know what? There's

14:00.420 --> 14:05.100
enough songs in there also that are pretty easy. So, it's just stuff to challenge people.

14:05.100 --> 14:08.100
And it just looked very interesting, that's all.

14:08.100 --> 14:13.100
I would still rather have a new Konami DDR.

14:13.100 --> 14:18.100
Well, okay, yeah. But at the moment, since there is no Konami DDR on the horizon, I'll take this.

14:18.100 --> 14:21.100
It's kinda like, it's like, can you go give me...

14:21.100 --> 14:25.100
Hey, can you go to the fridge and give me a soda? All we got's diet.

14:25.100 --> 14:28.100
Man. Alright, I'll drink it anyway.

14:28.100 --> 14:34.100
No, it's more like, uh, your choices are George W. Bush or John McCain. What you gonna have?

14:34.100 --> 14:36.100
You mean John Kerry?

15:04.100 --> 15:10.100
On that note, I think we're going to go ahead and get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.100
How about the cage match?

15:14.100 --> 15:17.100
The way the cage match works for those of you who haven't listened before,

15:17.100 --> 15:20.100
you've got to be in our chat room to participate, orangehonestradio.com.

15:20.100 --> 15:24.100
You pick a winner, three songs, each host brings one to the table.

15:24.100 --> 15:28.100
You get to hear a clip of last week's winner, because you already heard it last week.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.100
And then you get to hear two new songs in the entirety, you vote for your favorite.

15:31.100 --> 15:36.140
favorite. That favorite goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.

15:36.140 --> 15:41.460
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the Monty Music and More program. Okay, so let's get right

15:41.460 --> 15:48.260
into it. Last week's winner was brought to the table by Loki, and it's BT. And the song

15:48.260 --> 15:51.980
is called Kimo Sabe, and we figured out it is in one of those other, uh, harmonics games.

15:51.980 --> 15:57.020
It's an amplitude. It's an amplitude. Alright, so here it is, song number one, a clip of

15:57.020 --> 16:02.500
this BT Kimo Sabe enjoy

16:57.020 --> 16:58.020
B-4-C-4 on the floor

16:58.020 --> 16:59.020
B-4-C-4 on the floor

16:59.020 --> 17:00.020
Full effect

17:00.020 --> 17:13.020
Brothers caught in a lot and I wishin' they was like on top of the world

17:13.020 --> 17:15.020
Realize they were calm and refer to hip-hop as a girl

17:15.020 --> 17:17.020
Cause back in junior class my cats had bumped into a bump

17:17.020 --> 17:19.020
Remember to face well cause I wish I met a Sula

17:19.020 --> 17:21.020
Fortunately I stepped to her and it had to be a dope strategy

17:21.020 --> 17:22.020
She was leavin' to an academy

17:22.020 --> 17:23.020
Can I have your digits?

17:23.020 --> 17:24.020
I travel and it's hard to get at me

17:24.020 --> 17:25.020
What's your major by the way?

17:25.020 --> 17:30.020
I snap out, drop energy, backflip a non-abstract captivity when I rock creativity

17:30.020 --> 17:34.020
I bust positive vibes from the west to Maui, Lou Pack is the antidote created in Cali

17:34.020 --> 17:37.020
Cuz once the circle starts to swarm, b-boys and b-girls start to swarm

17:37.020 --> 17:40.020
Especially by the beginning of the night tomorrow, cuz they like to song

17:40.020 --> 17:42.020
The hype is on, it's all we want

17:42.020 --> 17:46.020
Can't you tell what's up, lift? You, chill, nobody's asleep, lift

17:46.020 --> 17:50.020
You, chill up, it's a lot of the funk from the beat that's before the street, come on buddy

17:50.020 --> 17:53.020
Can't you tell what's up, lift? You, chill, nobody's asleep, lift

18:53.020 --> 19:04.060
all right that was song number one in tonight's cage match a clip of last

19:04.060 --> 19:10.180
week's winner BT with Kimo Sabe all right let's get into song number two

19:10.180 --> 19:16.180
tonight song number two is my pick and I decided you know what I'd like to win a

19:16.180 --> 19:20.860
cage match before I leave town so I picked an artist that I usually tend to

19:20.860 --> 19:24.420
win this with and you know what I do really like this song a lot it's my

19:24.420 --> 19:29.380
favorite by her that I think I've heard to date so let's hear it for Kylie's

19:29.380 --> 19:34.220
sister Danni this is Danni Minogue with her latest single I begin to wonder

19:34.220 --> 19:41.220
enjoy song number two in tonight's stage match. Shut up. Here we go, here it is.

20:04.220 --> 20:07.220
Places I've never been before

20:07.220 --> 20:09.720
And every day it's the same thing

20:09.720 --> 20:11.720
Different faces with no name

20:11.720 --> 20:15.220
Places I've never been before

20:15.220 --> 20:18.220
And now

20:18.220 --> 20:20.220
We get into wonder

20:20.220 --> 20:22.720
And the dream makes me crazy

20:22.720 --> 20:25.720
And now

20:25.720 --> 20:27.720
We get into wonder

20:27.720 --> 20:30.720
The dream was ever to be safe and

20:30.720 --> 20:32.720
It's every place and day

20:32.720 --> 20:38.220
Different places you'll meet, places I've never been before

20:38.220 --> 20:46.220
And every day you'll sleep dead, different places you'll meet, places I've never been before

20:54.220 --> 20:58.220
And every time I think I'm breaking free, these thoughts return to trouble me

20:58.220 --> 21:01.220
Hanging on to love has left me empty

21:02.220 --> 21:04.220
You're a sinner but you told me you're a saint

21:04.220 --> 21:06.220
Too fast I tripped and lost my way

21:06.220 --> 21:09.220
Can't believe what's happened to me, is it fair?

21:09.220 --> 21:11.220
Cause every day is the same day

21:11.220 --> 21:13.220
Different faces, no names

21:13.220 --> 21:16.220
Faces I've never seen before

21:17.220 --> 21:19.220
And every day is the same day

21:19.220 --> 21:21.220
Different faces, no names

21:21.220 --> 21:24.220
Faces I've never seen before

21:54.220 --> 21:57.220
And I'm never busy for more

21:58.220 --> 22:00.220
Walking down the street

22:00.220 --> 22:02.220
I call your name

22:02.220 --> 22:04.220
All the time you led me astray

22:05.220 --> 22:07.220
Making love to you

22:07.220 --> 22:09.220
I do the same

22:09.220 --> 22:12.220
But now I know you're blind to me

22:13.220 --> 22:15.220
I'll never see you

22:15.220 --> 22:18.220
I'll wait so please be blind

22:18.220 --> 22:19.220
So I was over you

22:19.220 --> 22:21.220
Really over you

22:21.220 --> 22:23.220
No time to sleep

22:23.220 --> 22:25.720
I love that

22:25.720 --> 22:28.220
Well, I'm not over you

22:29.220 --> 22:32.220
And that I

22:32.220 --> 22:34.720
Be feeding them one another

22:34.720 --> 22:37.220
I can't keep me breathing

22:37.220 --> 22:40.220
And that I

22:40.220 --> 22:42.220
Be feeding them one another

22:42.220 --> 22:45.220
They want them to be safe there

22:45.220 --> 22:47.220
Every day is busy

22:47.220 --> 22:49.220
Every season's busy

22:49.220 --> 22:52.220
Things that I've never been before

22:52.220 --> 23:00.220
And every day, and every day, and every day, there's no need for places that I've never been before

23:00.220 --> 23:06.220
And I begin to wonder

23:30.220 --> 23:35.820
Yeah, besides the fact that it was really boring, it was really boring.

23:35.820 --> 23:38.820
So yeah, um, a five.

23:38.820 --> 23:41.520
Five. Uh, Jamie?

23:41.520 --> 23:48.320
I've heard that song before. It's pretty repetitive. It's not bad.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.820
So he gets a seven.

23:49.820 --> 23:53.620
He gets a seven. All right, moving on. Erin.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.920
Erin gives it half a one.

23:56.920 --> 23:57.920
Alright fine, lanky style then.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.920
Just before she coughs up the microphone, I'm gonna get some sick now.

23:59.920 --> 24:03.920
Um, yeah, of course I've heard that. Every time I was driving in the car with you, but...

24:03.920 --> 24:07.920
No, it's not a bad song. I think it's pretty poppy. Like, most of Danny Minnow's stuff, but...

24:07.920 --> 24:11.920
Personally, I have to say, I like, put the needle on it a lot better. A lot better.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.920
So I'll give that a 7.

24:14.920 --> 24:15.920
Alright, um...

24:19.920 --> 24:21.920
Jonas, your thoughts on that one?

24:21.920 --> 24:25.920
I begin to wonder why I'm gonna give this a 7 out of 10.

24:25.920 --> 24:32.840
me too oh my god I just noticed your hat says you're fired is that an apprentice

24:32.840 --> 24:37.240
hat or something that's so funny all right all right now it's Aaron's turn

24:37.240 --> 24:42.240
um well it was not that great I'm sorry to say it was kind of boring to the

24:42.240 --> 24:45.680
point where I took my testicles put on my headphones and started listening to

24:45.680 --> 24:55.400
music so all right okay so on a scale of one to ten? Probably like four. Four all right low-key it was

24:55.400 --> 25:02.400
It was on the Ministry of Sound compilation, and it was by the...

25:25.400 --> 25:26.600
The Lost Brothers.

25:26.600 --> 25:32.400
The Lost Brothers. I like this song because the song was in The Lost Boys, which is like one of my all-time ever favorite movies.

25:32.400 --> 25:37.900
And actually, it's actually like real samples. It's not like somebody covering it, so it's very well done.

25:37.900 --> 25:46.400
And I will never, ever, hardly ever say that any, you know, song that I like that much is well done. So, yeah.

25:47.400 --> 25:51.400
All right, then judge for yourself. Here it is. If you love the 80s, you'll love this.

25:51.400 --> 25:56.400
The Lost Brothers, Cry Little Sister, Jamie's pick, enjoy.

26:21.400 --> 26:26.400
I'll be there, I'll be there

26:26.400 --> 26:31.400
I'll be there, I'll be there

26:31.400 --> 26:49.400
I'll pick you up

26:49.400 --> 26:58.400
I'll need you now

27:03.400 --> 27:08.400
I'll need you now

27:08.400 --> 27:10.400
Little sister

27:10.400 --> 27:14.400
Love shall not fall

27:14.400 --> 27:17.400
Come, come say your prayers

27:17.400 --> 27:20.960
Love me like a rock

27:20.960 --> 27:24.280
I can't be sist

27:24.280 --> 27:27.560
Love me like a rock

27:27.560 --> 27:29.560
I love you

27:29.560 --> 27:31.400
That's what I feel, real

27:31.400 --> 27:34.120
All the little things

27:34.120 --> 27:36.600
Love me like a rock

27:36.600 --> 27:38.280
I'm still sist

27:38.280 --> 27:41.720
Love me like a rock

27:41.720 --> 27:45.200
I'm gonna show you real

27:45.200 --> 27:49.200
I'm with you right in front of the wall

27:49.200 --> 27:52.200
I'm sharing many secrets

27:52.200 --> 27:59.200
I'm with you right in front of the wall

29:29.200 --> 29:59.080
all right hey quiet in studio all right house on number three in tonight's

29:59.080 --> 30:03.080
cage match that was uh... lost brothers with cry little sister sorry about the

30:03.080 --> 30:05.560
ending there it starts to fade into another track is on one of those

30:05.560 --> 30:08.240
nonstop dance compilations so you have to disregard like the last twenty

30:08.240 --> 30:10.400
seconds of track

30:10.400 --> 30:13.800
otherwise that was uh... cry little sister let's see what everybody here

30:13.800 --> 30:15.160
thought of that jamie

30:15.160 --> 30:18.240
of course is nowhere near as good as the original songs because i can listen to

30:18.240 --> 30:19.960
the original on repeat

30:19.960 --> 30:23.080
endless for days in years and months everything

30:23.080 --> 30:26.680
i give that one and nine it it's well done i would like for them to do a

30:26.680 --> 30:27.600
longer one

30:27.600 --> 30:31.000
actually had the lyrics in it you know but that one was still pretty good it's

30:31.000 --> 30:36.040
enough to get that little bit of nostalgia pulled up in me and think of

30:36.040 --> 30:42.240
who was it Jason Patrick with those shades yes and that hair yes and keeper

30:42.240 --> 30:51.480
hahaha all right right on all right Loki fucking cut myself on a wire anyways

30:51.480 --> 30:59.480
Alright, um, that was okay. Um, I'd give it a 7 as well. It was just... okay.

30:59.480 --> 31:03.480
Alright. Uh, lanky style.

31:03.480 --> 31:08.480
It was pretty good. It's a standard club song, you know, so I'd give it a 7.

31:08.480 --> 31:14.480
Um, who else? Puppy. We can get over to Puppy.

31:14.480 --> 31:20.480
You know, I wasn't really paying attention to the song because I was making some pineapple soda.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.960
you make keeper southerland cry

31:22.960 --> 31:26.240
keeper southerland was awesome in twenty four and i love that show

31:26.240 --> 31:30.920
but he was also in the last voice

31:30.920 --> 31:36.400
i haven't uh... because the box office season two has been out for a while

31:36.400 --> 31:38.640
oh yeah the song um...

31:38.640 --> 31:42.840
it didn't really catch much of my attention anyways

31:42.840 --> 31:44.000
it seems kinda

31:44.000 --> 31:45.800
mellow and

31:45.800 --> 31:47.480
just because

31:47.480 --> 31:51.480
I don't feel like favoring one song or the other. I'll give this one a 5 too.

31:51.480 --> 31:57.480
Alright. Uh, Aaron. VHG.

31:57.480 --> 32:08.480
Nah, wasn't anything special. It was alright. It'd be something I would listen to if I were driving, per se, but beyond that, I wouldn't really listen to otherwise, so I'd give it, like, a 6.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.480
Jodas?

32:10.480 --> 32:13.480
Uh, I'll give it a 7.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.480
Alrighty. Same reason.

32:15.480 --> 32:18.780
i kind of have to agree with jamie that it's it's just not as good as the

32:18.780 --> 32:23.220
original but i honestly wouldn't put in the same ballpark this year is also

32:23.220 --> 32:26.440
great that one doesn't have a lyrics and that

32:26.440 --> 32:31.240
it's okay i get the point about it's kind of it makes you think that when i

32:31.240 --> 32:35.840
hear that song i think about how i want to hear the original basically out

32:35.840 --> 32:37.200
that's how it goes for me

32:37.200 --> 32:42.560
so i give it a i'd give the original attended a give that a six

32:42.560 --> 32:43.820
here we go guys

32:43.820 --> 32:47.300
uh... here's a clip of those three songs you can vote for one more time song

32:47.300 --> 32:49.820
number one tonight uh... bt

32:49.820 --> 32:56.820
kimosabe

32:56.900 --> 33:03.900
song number two tonight danny minnow i begin to wonder

33:03.900 --> 33:20.900
And song number three tonight, Lost Brothers, Cry Little Sister.

33:20.900 --> 33:27.700
Alright, now you can start placing your vote, but if you're undecided, we'll try this out

33:27.700 --> 33:28.700
tonight.

33:28.700 --> 33:33.100
I'm going to allow a listener to come through on the Skyblind and try to get people to vote

33:33.100 --> 33:36.620
for the one they think ought to win. I don't know if anybody will bite on this, but as

33:36.620 --> 33:41.900
long as we have this new feature, we'll try it out and see if anyone wants to persuade

33:41.900 --> 33:47.780
people that they need to vote for a particular song. So, you can place vote now, but if you're

33:47.780 --> 33:51.180
undecided, why don't you see what one of our random callers has to say if somebody decides

33:51.180 --> 33:53.780
to have some balls to call in. We'll see.

33:53.780 --> 33:59.780
The Night Rider does his Ren Faire video.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.780
The Night Rider.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.780
I'm going to be in front of it because it's kind of a good series.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.780
It's just about a lot of fun.

34:15.780 --> 34:19.540
Wait, wait, your mic's not on over there.

34:19.540 --> 34:20.540
Your mic's not on.

34:20.540 --> 34:21.540
How's that?

34:21.540 --> 34:22.540
Yeah, much better.

34:22.540 --> 34:30.540
People in Ren Faire garb on a motorcycle.

34:30.540 --> 34:37.260
This has got to be the biggest piece of crap I've ever looked at.

34:37.260 --> 34:42.260
This movie, okay, this movie has a scene where this guy's just driving down the middle of

35:12.260 --> 35:17.260
I guess that makes sense, because his musical career is really going far.

35:17.260 --> 35:22.260
People suck for not calling the skype line.

35:22.260 --> 35:27.260
That's alright. They'll have chances later. Nobody liked any of those songs, I guess, but we'll see.

35:27.260 --> 35:31.260
We are getting some votes, so we'll tally those up during the next break and let you know who won.

35:31.260 --> 35:34.260
In the meantime, let's go back and talk about some new DDR news.

35:34.260 --> 35:39.260
Hey, this just came up today, you guys. This is interesting, I think.

35:39.260 --> 35:50.300
Um, Alloy Magazine is having a DDR sweepstakes, Alloy Magazine by the way is one of those

35:50.300 --> 35:57.420
like girly magazines like Seventeen and Cosmo, yeah, VHD's like oh god, in fact if we, if

35:57.420 --> 36:07.980
we go to, prepare to be really sad, oh, it's cause um, we, we, like, my sister Nais has

36:07.980 --> 36:11.180
subscription to one of those girlie magazines, and every once in a while they send you, like,

36:11.180 --> 36:14.140
free subscriptions to other magazines, or send you a free

36:14.140 --> 36:17.460
trial issue of another magazine, and one of them was Alloy.

36:17.460 --> 36:20.740
So they're those, like, girlie clothing magazines, basically.

36:20.740 --> 36:25.740
Yeah, it's a clothing line. It's basically like a catalog.

36:25.740 --> 36:30.500
You know, because, because, you know, the coolest, yeah, the coolest girls order their,

36:30.500 --> 36:33.900
their, their clothes through catalogs without trying them on first, you know.

36:33.900 --> 36:39.060
Here are the top stories right now on Alloy.com

36:39.060 --> 36:45.220
Which fairy tale fox is dreamier? Chad Michael Murray and Hugh Dancy duke it out

36:45.220 --> 36:49.820
Who? Yeah I know. So they're these dream kids I guess

36:49.820 --> 36:53.780
and it says hey get your movie on this weekend

36:53.780 --> 36:58.180
Get your movie on. And right on the front page there there's

36:58.180 --> 37:02.340
gossip about Colin Farrell and where Will Smith changed their naughty ways

37:02.340 --> 37:07.660
how about who cares all right well this is why we care because alloy.com is

37:07.660 --> 37:14.220
right now having a you got served take it to the streets contest and you guys

37:14.220 --> 37:19.100
are saying what the fuck does this have to do with DDR well if you win the grand

37:19.100 --> 37:25.220
prize you win a PlayStation 2 a dance dance revolution prize package with two

37:25.220 --> 37:30.660
dance pads and the game a way got 32 inch TV now that's the reason to win

37:30.660 --> 37:38.860
right there. And the copy of the new Take it to the Streets DVD. Hey, and five first

37:38.860 --> 37:44.280
place winners get a copy of the Take it to the Streets DVD and DDR Max 2 games. So if

37:44.280 --> 37:48.880
you still don't have DDR Max 2, you could try and win it here on Alloy.com. I would

37:48.880 --> 37:53.000
just look in between the Who's Dreamier polls. If it weren't for the fact that they had to

37:53.000 --> 37:59.440
include the movie you got served anywhere in this contest, it'd be worth entering. Take

37:59.440 --> 38:02.880
Take it to the Streets is where they show the choreography, it's like Darren's Dance

38:02.880 --> 38:03.880
Crews.

38:03.880 --> 38:07.200
Which I own both of those, sadly enough.

38:07.200 --> 38:13.200
That's depressing, but hold on, I'm confused, okay, you got served Take it to the Streets,

38:13.200 --> 38:14.640
it's not gonna buy you, or is it?

38:14.640 --> 38:19.160
Okay, anyway, sorry, she's talking about the Knight Riders movie, whatever, anyway, so,

38:19.160 --> 38:24.880
is it a DDR tournament, or a freestyle dance?

38:24.880 --> 38:28.680
What kind of contest is this, give me some information, are people really dancing, or

38:28.680 --> 38:31.080
Oh, oh, how do you enter the You Got Served contest?

38:31.080 --> 38:34.380
No, what is it doing? Is it a sweepstakes?

38:34.380 --> 38:37.080
Yeah, this is a sweepstakes, the hour that Conk's having, yes.

38:37.080 --> 38:37.680
I thought they were...

38:37.680 --> 38:39.180
It's not like a tournament or anything, it's just a sweepstakes.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.880
I thought it was a competition.

38:40.880 --> 38:41.780
Okay, whatever. Anyway.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.180
All you do, basically...

38:43.180 --> 38:45.180
Oh my god, I'll enter it, cuz I want the TV.

38:45.180 --> 38:48.380
How do you enter now? You just, you give them your information.

38:48.380 --> 38:50.380
That's it. You give them your mailing address and stuff,

38:50.380 --> 38:53.180
so they'll probably send you copies of their crappy magazine,

38:53.180 --> 38:55.480
and you have a chance to win a WEGA.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.480
What a deal.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.240
Do I get to tell them how I feel about the movie you got served?

38:59.240 --> 39:03.200
If you want, because I got some things to say.

39:03.200 --> 39:09.120
Yeah, well, everyone got served, but we got served a big pile of crap.

39:09.120 --> 39:14.280
Are you going to serve you got served?

39:14.280 --> 39:24.720
I'll serve chicken with a side of vegetables, thank you.

39:24.720 --> 39:29.720
Dancing movies are really just cheesy all together. Like, who remembers Lombada?

39:29.720 --> 39:31.720
Save the Rainforest!

39:31.720 --> 39:32.720
Yup.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.720
Breakin' was awesome.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.720
Breakin' was awesome.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.720
Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.720
I have those.

39:40.720 --> 39:46.720
How about The Sound of Music? That was pretty sweet.

39:46.720 --> 39:51.720
Those dances they did, whoa, that was off the chains for a shizzle.

39:51.720 --> 39:55.720
I used to love the Do Not Take Us Away To Concentration Camps dance.

39:55.720 --> 40:02.720
The do not take us away to concentration camps dance, that was great.

40:02.720 --> 40:07.600
That was, that dance was just like, awesome.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.600
I was moved.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.600
In my pants.

40:09.600 --> 40:10.600
You got served, Hitler!

40:10.600 --> 40:11.600
Oh my god.

40:11.600 --> 40:12.600
Wow.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.600
You got served, Hitler.

40:13.600 --> 40:14.600
You seriously need to have your own microphone attached.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.600
That, you know what?

40:15.600 --> 40:28.280
okay you got served Hitler that you know it that was just you were right that was

40:28.280 --> 40:39.600
moving as in bowel movement um you know this whole okay I want you to tell me

40:39.600 --> 40:44.440
your mate this whole like you got served contest being on alloy calm kind of got

40:44.440 --> 40:48.840
me thinkin' earlier today. It reminded me of a post from LiveJournal, one of my buddies

40:48.840 --> 40:52.080
LiveJournal, I'm not going to embarrass them on the air because they might be listening,

40:52.080 --> 40:56.120
but somebody was asking me in their LiveJournal today because they're having problems where

40:56.120 --> 40:59.400
they're not gay but they're getting a lot of guys hitting on them because they've got

40:59.400 --> 41:04.660
like that, they've got that metro, they've got that metrosexual thing going on, so like

41:04.660 --> 41:11.420
people assume the guy's gay, and he's like, you know, I'm a DDR player, does that make

41:11.420 --> 41:19.800
me gay. And that kind of just had me thinking about this stigma that DDR has with the fact

41:19.800 --> 41:23.460
that if you're playing DDR, then you're either metrosexual or you're all the way gay.

41:23.460 --> 41:30.280
If you play DDR, you gay. Why is that? Can somebody please explain that to me? I've seen

41:30.280 --> 41:39.040
some real guys I would not consider gay at all. In fact, they're not really gay or straight,

41:39.040 --> 41:43.280
They're just ugly, and I've seen them playing DDR.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.000
Well, well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.400
G-Dog plays DDR, doesn't he?

41:47.400 --> 41:50.400
Moving on.

41:50.400 --> 41:54.520
There's our new joke for the season.

41:54.520 --> 41:59.280
I think that one of the reasons why people, like, what's

41:59.280 --> 42:00.080
the word I'm looking for?

42:00.080 --> 42:03.480
They tie it in with gayness or whatever,

42:03.480 --> 42:06.440
is because a lot of freaking gay people play DDR.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.320
For one.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.320
Wait a minute, wait a minute though.

42:09.320 --> 42:16.320
For the longest time, I was the only gay guy playing DDR in this town. You know it, you know it.

42:16.320 --> 42:29.320
At the time, yes, you were the only outwardly gay person playing. Everybody else was just a closet homosexual.

42:29.320 --> 42:34.600
too though because a lot of people see you know they're a little late in seeing

42:34.600 --> 42:38.320
DDR and finding it out and stuff and what they see for the first time is some

42:38.320 --> 42:43.320
guy out there playing it's raining men and you know that kind of just screams

42:43.320 --> 42:51.520
he loves the cock I don't know what to say I mean also they're gamer geeks that

42:51.520 --> 42:56.400
play the game and they're usually they have that stigma since that's the word

42:56.400 --> 43:02.840
we're using today, of people who don't get out of their house and don't get with girls

43:02.840 --> 43:07.240
and stuff, you know, because gamer geeks don't have lives, so, well that is true. But anyway,

43:07.240 --> 43:11.560
you see what I'm saying? You know what, I still find it very funny just how many guys

43:11.560 --> 43:16.680
in the Bay Area were playing Pata Pata. I guess, by the way you guys, I guess we dropped

43:16.680 --> 43:21.240
for like half a second, I don't know what happened, but, I don't know what the fuck

43:21.240 --> 43:26.320
that was about. Yeah, seriously, it was amazing how many guys played Pata Pata Pata Dice

43:26.320 --> 43:30.000
compared to girls cuz when I played there were like three girls playing

43:30.000 --> 43:34.240
including me and the rest were all guys well that's that's just that bad thing

43:34.240 --> 43:38.560
about there not being as many girl gamers as there were guy gamers. The funny thing was watching how many guys

43:38.560 --> 43:43.800
played deluxe and oceladio yeah well that okay now that's another reason why

43:43.800 --> 43:48.040
people think they're gay because of that doing the deluxe dance and there

43:48.040 --> 43:53.200
were those are like the two songs I kind of just didn't touch after a while I was

43:53.200 --> 43:56.200
Just like, fuck it, I'm not playing those songs.

43:56.200 --> 43:59.620
And for some people, and I know a few people listening actually haven't seen any of these on

43:59.620 --> 44:00.820
Pada Pada,

44:00.820 --> 44:05.020
Deluxe has a move where you put one hand out to one side, and the other hand out to the other side,

44:05.020 --> 44:06.820
and then you shake your butt.

44:06.820 --> 44:10.540
And your hands are kind of in a faggish motion.

44:10.540 --> 44:12.780
Your hands are held vertically.

44:12.780 --> 44:18.620
Yeah, and then, but to be more accurate, you should be pointing it down like this.

44:18.620 --> 44:20.160
And then there's Osole Meo.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.180
Where you do the little teacup looking dance.

44:22.180 --> 44:27.400
uh... the old building you know how you can you're at the end of the article

44:27.400 --> 44:30.400
i'd like to call it the clock block

44:30.400 --> 44:33.560
you know you're swatting something away from your butt because you know

44:33.560 --> 44:36.880
well i don't know if you have a young lady and pointed out to the side like

44:36.880 --> 44:39.840
you're waiting in the other one waiting at your ad like i don't want you you're

44:39.840 --> 44:44.160
ugly you over there you're pretty attractive i'd rather be i'd rather be

44:44.160 --> 44:46.780
flooded and we need to run away exactly

44:46.780 --> 44:49.400
it's robert faces

44:49.400 --> 44:50.880
shut up

44:50.880 --> 44:52.420
anyway

44:52.420 --> 44:56.940
but my point is is that this whole like alloy dot com thing this isn't helping

44:56.940 --> 44:58.680
this image at all

44:58.680 --> 45:04.500
cuz like i'm looking at this page going this is the gayest thing i've ever seen

45:04.500 --> 45:08.840
like yeah seriously i'm just i'm waiting for like madonna to start playing

45:08.840 --> 45:11.800
and uh... you know liza manelli worse

45:11.800 --> 45:16.720
what madonna remixed by thunder kiss if madonna ends up in the next d r

45:16.720 --> 45:23.720
you are going to start sucking cock is this is going to happen

45:23.900 --> 45:24.820
i'm kidding

45:24.820 --> 45:28.660
i'm sorry to hear what we shouldn't be stereotypical it's not nice but you know

45:28.660 --> 45:32.820
everybody else's everybody outside of the scene is rob

45:32.820 --> 45:33.900
but

45:33.900 --> 45:35.340
what what

45:35.340 --> 45:39.940
uh... but but but but but but what we ever been nice

45:39.940 --> 45:42.420
i guess i just have a question for all the straight guys in the room which is

45:42.420 --> 45:43.700
everybody to me

45:43.700 --> 45:47.000
we have a great have any of you straight guys

45:47.000 --> 45:49.180
any straight guys in the room

45:49.180 --> 45:50.520
have you ever

45:50.520 --> 45:53.900
not been called a while playing d r

45:53.900 --> 45:56.380
and

45:56.380 --> 45:58.220
have ever had not called gay

45:58.220 --> 46:01.020
abit i i think you're still

46:01.020 --> 46:02.540
well

46:02.540 --> 46:04.240
yeah

46:04.240 --> 46:08.240
raise a question you all of the called a at least once while playing the art

46:08.240 --> 46:11.040
you never got gay

46:11.040 --> 46:13.920
You've been called feminist?

46:13.920 --> 46:17.160
You weren't called feminist? What did you do? Did you, like,

46:17.160 --> 46:23.160
buy tickets to the Lillifair and start blasting Ani DeFranco and...

46:24.080 --> 46:29.320
and started joining Greenpeace and shit? What?

46:29.320 --> 46:30.680
Okay,

46:30.680 --> 46:34.360
for the whole time I was in India, I was never called gay,

46:34.360 --> 46:37.880
but someone was calling me a feminist or something like that.

46:37.880 --> 46:48.880
Wow, a lot of our chatters saying the same thing. I always, a lot of straight guys I talk to always say that they've got this experience where some asshole called them gay while playing DDR at least once. I know you've gotten it.

46:48.880 --> 46:53.880
I have not, but most of the times I've been, there's been no one around when I play.

46:53.880 --> 46:59.880
Remember, we're from Sacramento, Rob. Like, not the Bay Area, where it's a little more accepted.

46:59.880 --> 47:06.000
There's also, keep in mind, there's the Roseville Children, as I like to call them, who are

47:06.000 --> 47:09.840
the people that I have kicked out on a regular basis every time I go.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.440
It's that crowd that's more...

47:12.440 --> 47:17.560
I had a group of mid to early 20-year-olds, a bunch of them, a bunch of them with one

47:17.560 --> 47:21.400
girl trying to impress this girl, and they were calling me gay, and they were like, he

47:21.400 --> 47:23.120
grabbed my hand.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
Who's gay now?

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
Come on.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.120
He grabbed my hand?

47:26.120 --> 47:27.120
Oh yeah, I had that happen before.

47:27.120 --> 47:29.040
He tried to pull me off the machine, and I'm like, no.

47:29.040 --> 47:36.040
Yeah, he's like, oh my ass is screaming for some action. I'm like, uh, get away. I'm trying,

47:38.880 --> 47:45.340
get away and let me play It's Raining Man. Oh God, I was, speaking of that, I remember

47:45.340 --> 47:50.740
playing random ball with some dude. He was, he's gay, and it ended up being It's Raining

47:50.740 --> 47:55.780
Man. He was like. He was grabbing your ass while he was playing? Yeah, he was grabbing

47:55.780 --> 48:02.340
my ass. I was just sure it was intentional, but I felt a pinch. Hey man, just be flattered.

48:02.340 --> 48:11.340
Just nod your head, smile, you know. He's like, ahh, I don't like this. Yeah, effeminate

48:11.340 --> 48:15.600
would be the word. What's that? Which is practically the same. We all know that Jonas was trying

48:15.600 --> 48:20.760
to say effeminate, but it was funnier that he said feminists. Yeah, I knew he was trying

48:20.760 --> 48:22.760
I play DDR for women everywhere!

48:22.760 --> 48:24.760
I was gonna say...

48:24.760 --> 48:25.760
I was like, whoa.

48:25.760 --> 48:29.760
I'm gonna get up on this DDR machine and burn my bra!

48:31.760 --> 48:36.760
Now if you wanna see real gay, just look at the dynamite rave hand-planned knee-drop routine.

48:36.760 --> 48:37.760
Oh, that's a different type of gay.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.760
That's not gay.

48:39.760 --> 48:43.760
Yeah, and if you yell at me, I'm gonna take out my bloody tampon and throw it at you.

48:43.760 --> 48:49.760
And by the way, gay is not a negative thing, so stop using it like it is.

48:49.760 --> 48:55.040
it like it is. Thank you. Thank you. Okay? You people suck ass. You people are the...

48:55.040 --> 49:03.640
Who's gay now? You are the one that is gay. You are the one who are the balllickers. Seriously,

49:03.640 --> 49:09.600
for all the people who go, oh, that's so gay, you people are the hemorrhoid on the butt

49:09.600 --> 49:15.160
of social progress. I say that's so gay all the time. But you know what, though? You say

49:15.160 --> 49:19.720
it in relation to things that may be associated with gay things. But see, I feel like I have

49:19.720 --> 49:23.500
have an authority on it you know like I I have a wand and I can deem things I

49:23.500 --> 49:31.040
could say this day it's gay no okay Robin is immediate gay friends they

49:31.040 --> 49:37.520
constantly say like terms that would be used to describe a homosexual male in

49:37.520 --> 49:45.360
negative connotations you fucking faggot things like that I love you too see and

49:45.360 --> 49:59.360
That's how we say, you know, hello and stuff. It's like, it's like another group of people we know who use another word that is, yeah.

49:59.360 --> 50:05.360
Anyway, I'm going away from this topic, but here, have a, have a microphone, faggot.

50:05.360 --> 50:15.600
Anyway, I'm going to burn my bra right here on behalf of drag queens everywhere.

50:15.600 --> 50:16.600
No, I'm kidding.

50:16.600 --> 50:17.600
I'm kidding.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.600
All right.

50:18.600 --> 50:19.600
You guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

50:19.600 --> 50:20.600
No.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.600
Well, too bad.

50:21.600 --> 50:22.600
You get to hear.

50:22.600 --> 50:23.600
Don't play to my talk.

50:23.600 --> 50:24.600
All right.

50:24.600 --> 50:27.600
Tonight's cage match winner.

50:27.600 --> 50:31.080
By the way, the Skyblind is open.

50:31.080 --> 50:35.560
If you want to comment on homosexuality and DDR and all that stuff, uh, this guy blinds

50:35.560 --> 50:36.560
open.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.600
I can't wait to hear this one.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.920
Tonight's cage match winner is, um, I'm Very Happy.

50:41.920 --> 50:43.920
This song won.

50:43.920 --> 50:50.160
Of course you are, it's your song.

50:50.160 --> 50:54.760
Danny Manero wins tonight's cage match in a very close vote, so, uh, all three songs

50:54.760 --> 50:59.440
pretty well represented tonight, so, uh, that was a mercy thing, but the point is, is that

50:59.440 --> 51:03.760
that I want leaving. So now I don't have to pick a song for next week. It's great. Works

51:03.760 --> 51:08.320
out nice. Thank you guys. We needed the violin music playing in the background. And I'm going

51:08.320 --> 51:17.320
to Pennsylvania for two weeks and we're over on my song. Oh, my poor heart. And I have

51:17.320 --> 51:27.600
like a heart disease. What? And I never learned to read. Be quiet. Hey Rob, at least you're

51:27.600 --> 51:33.000
white okay so it's okay to go to Pennsylvania. You won't have to be threatened by all the

51:33.000 --> 51:39.000
hicks over there. What in the hell does that mean? Excuse me, hicks, where? Pennsylvania.

51:39.000 --> 51:45.480
Okay, never mind. I'm sorry, I hear hick and all of a sudden I'm thinking like, okay, what's

51:45.480 --> 51:52.480
you saying about... Look, on the outside I may be white, but on the inside... You're

51:52.480 --> 51:56.480
on the inside, you're a black woman, a repressed black woman

51:56.480 --> 52:00.480
on the inside, on the inside I am

52:00.480 --> 52:04.480
blood and guts, just like you

52:04.480 --> 52:08.480
on the outside

52:08.480 --> 52:12.480
oh, we're getting a call, I should actually answer the skype line

52:12.480 --> 52:16.480
once in a while, hi you're on orange lounge

52:16.480 --> 52:20.480
hello, hello can you hear us

52:20.480 --> 52:25.480
lounge. Wow, we're already getting prank calls. No. Okay, call her.

52:25.480 --> 52:28.480
Is your refrigerator running? You better touch it.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.480
Call, are you there? Yeah.

52:30.480 --> 52:35.480
Oh, hey, there you are. What's up? Who's this?

52:35.480 --> 52:37.480
Turn off your BitTorrent. Yeah.

52:37.480 --> 52:40.480
Turn off your BitTorrent. Turn off your, uh.

52:40.480 --> 52:42.480
Stop downloading the porn.

52:42.480 --> 52:44.480
Hey, what's up? You there?

52:44.480 --> 52:49.480
I have no torrent. Okay. What's up?

52:49.480 --> 52:50.880
Not much, man.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.480
Yeah, I think it's a lot of lag.

52:52.480 --> 52:57.480
Hey, I gotta let you go, dude, because you got a lot of lag going on here, so try calling us back a little later.

52:57.480 --> 52:58.480
Maybe it'll clear up.

52:58.480 --> 52:59.480
Take care.

52:59.480 --> 53:00.480
Thank him for the call.

53:00.480 --> 53:01.480
What was that?

53:01.480 --> 53:02.480
I didn't catch it.

53:02.480 --> 53:06.480
I see the name on Skype, but the names on Skype are different than the chatroom names, so...

53:06.480 --> 53:09.480
Can you guys all turn off your bit torrents?

53:09.480 --> 53:11.480
He said he didn't have any torrents running.

53:11.480 --> 53:12.480
It was just a bad connection.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.480
You know what, though?

53:13.480 --> 53:16.480
Apparently our show dropped earlier, so it might even be us.

53:16.480 --> 53:17.480
I don't know.

53:17.480 --> 53:18.480
It might have something to do with it.

53:18.480 --> 53:22.480
I have. I'll leave the Skyplane open a little bit longer though. Somebody else wants to give it a call.

53:22.480 --> 53:26.480
Let's call in and talk about the topic.

53:26.480 --> 53:30.480
Change of subject? Alright. Back to dick and fart jokes.

53:30.480 --> 53:34.480
Okay, no actually we can take a break. Actually I do want to play this

53:34.480 --> 53:38.480
because I haven't even heard this yet but apparently Loki did a new remix

53:38.480 --> 53:42.480
last night and I didn't even know about it. So what's up Loki?

53:42.480 --> 53:46.480
Tell us about your newest remix. We're going to play it. I was bored and I saw

53:46.480 --> 53:50.680
someone made some stupid remix and it's not even really a remix that they made it was

53:50.680 --> 53:57.080
like I know it wasn't max remix it was like I heard the other day insertion and ecstasy

53:57.080 --> 54:02.160
and they sounded the same so I decided to mix them together and it sounded like crap

54:02.160 --> 54:07.680
so but that got me thinking I was like hey ecstasy I haven't used ecstasy yet and I was

54:07.680 --> 54:11.300
working on something before and that just wasn't going anywhere so I plugged ecstasy

54:11.300 --> 54:17.780
in, and played that around. It's okay. My remixes are starting to become average now.

54:17.780 --> 54:21.700
Like the DDR song? Yes, the DDR song, Ecstasy.

54:21.700 --> 54:29.060
So Mike, this is like an average remix now. It's like, I worked on it for a couple hours

54:29.060 --> 54:31.860
and I was just like, eh. It's a mediocre remix.

54:31.860 --> 54:36.940
It's mediocre. It's okay. There's parts that are cool. It's just like bad transitions in

54:36.940 --> 54:42.220
in a few spots that I have to...it's really...the song I was working with was hard. But this

54:42.220 --> 54:46.120
is kind of a tribute song to the song that got me into techno in the first place, Fourteen

54:46.120 --> 54:50.860
Hours to Save the Earth by Tomski, so it's a remix between that. It's Ecstasy, the Fourteen

54:50.860 --> 54:51.820
Hours Club Mix.

54:51.820 --> 54:56.060
Interesting. Alright, we're gonna check this out and then we'll be back. And we'll talk

54:56.060 --> 54:57.060
about more stuff. We'll be back.

54:57.060 --> 55:04.060
back.

56:27.060 --> 56:28.060
Hey!

56:28.060 --> 56:29.060
Hey!

56:29.060 --> 56:30.060
Hey!

56:30.060 --> 56:31.060
Hey!

56:31.060 --> 56:32.060
Hey!

57:32.060 --> 57:39.060
For up to the minute Romani and Gaming News, we'll be right back.

58:02.060 --> 58:20.020
All right, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio, and that was Tomski versus Decomplex, remixed

58:20.020 --> 58:23.700
by Loki there, Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.

58:23.700 --> 58:24.700
What did you guys think of that?

58:24.700 --> 58:26.420
I thought it was pretty good.

58:26.420 --> 58:30.160
You know what, I gotta be honest with you, I think out of all of your songs, everything

58:30.160 --> 58:35.580
You have remixed. I think that is the one I would want to listen to more than anything else. Well, no

58:35.580 --> 58:36.900
I like I like a lot of his stuff

58:36.900 --> 58:40.660
But I think I could see myself listening to that like a lot like I really like that

58:40.660 --> 58:41.100
I mean

58:41.100 --> 58:42.520
I love ecstasy to begin with

58:42.520 --> 58:46.660
But I love like the last minute and a half of the song with the other song mix now

58:46.660 --> 58:51.120
I love how it makes you like feel good when people touch you you like, oh wait wrong. I

58:51.760 --> 58:56.440
I seriously, I think that is a better ecstasy remix than the one that was a max

58:56.440 --> 58:58.440
Oh, way better. That one on Max 2 sucks.

58:59.440 --> 59:02.440
I cannot believe that Konami isn't calling you.

59:02.440 --> 59:05.440
I mean, I realize that you're taking commercial songs and fusing them together.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.440
Shh. Don't tell them the secret.

59:07.440 --> 59:08.440
Okay, well, you know.

59:08.440 --> 59:10.440
But I still think even with...

59:10.440 --> 59:11.440
I know, I'm kidding.

59:11.440 --> 59:16.440
I still think even your, like, Silent Hill remix you had earlier where you're kind of remixing it on top of itself and stuff,

59:16.440 --> 59:19.440
and with enough public domain samples out there, honestly,

59:19.440 --> 59:21.440
because we know in a lot of DDR songs they're using public domain samples.

59:21.440 --> 59:25.600
Oh yeah, well I, they're public domain or they're just, they're like sample kids from

59:25.600 --> 59:30.280
acid, I swear to God they are, because I listen to so much techno music and stuff that they're

59:30.280 --> 59:34.880
like, wait a second, that's that song. In fact, one Easy to Dancer song, which is called

59:34.880 --> 59:41.040
like, uh, oh man, I can't remember the name of it, it's like a long mega mix of like trance

59:41.040 --> 59:47.360
stuff. It's all commercial songs! No credit to them! I'm like, you completely ripped them

59:47.360 --> 59:52.900
off great you know but seriously you should get your stuff out there as much

59:52.900 --> 59:55.640
as you can because I think it's really good here's the thing and I think you

59:55.640 --> 01:00:00.020
know all these remix contests out there like but my cells in a remix contest

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.880
which I might feel later that DDR maniacs a remix contest and these other

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.880
ones I can't enter them because I'm not making my music with um was it uh

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.400
whatever that one program is you know what they can't be loose I'm not making

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.400
How can they tell? How can they tell what program you're using?

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.400
Because it doesn't sound like MIDI. That's what they like. They like MIDI.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.400
I honestly think you should just send it in anyway, and if they say no, they say no.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.400
But honestly, that is better than half the stuff that was in...

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.400
almost all the stuff that was in the Milmati Style Remix Conda's last one.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.400
I just don't have... that right there is below my standards right there.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:40.400
It's okay, it's nice, I like the parts in it, but I can't stand, you know,

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.440
like non perfect transitions and stuff like that it's just like you're just a

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.500
perfectionist you did that in one evening yeah I did that about three

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.040
hours or a couple hours I I just sat down I was listening to this really

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:57.500
shitty it was it sounded like someone just had two songs playing back to back

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.160
and they just didn't even really remix them on top of each other with acid they

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:06.320
just kind of faded one into the other or faded one in on top of the other one it

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.840
just didn't sound right honestly if somebody is going to reject your song

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.840
from a remix contest because the program you use, they are being ignorant. That is so ignorant.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.840
Well, because you understand that, you know, mash mixes are not real remixes.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.840
Okay, but that's because people fucking did Paranoia Cowgirl, okay? That's why.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840
You didn't...

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.840
What's funny though is I'd like them to tell that, you know, the people that mash mixes aren't real mixes since...

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.840
Oh, wait a second, because I do think Acid, the site that actually, you know, produces the Acid 4.0 and stuff like that,

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.840
stuff like that. Guess what? They have a whole remix contest section. Guess what? It's actually

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:46.480
recognized by many artists like BT and David Bowie. Wasn't he giving away a car for some

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.460
mashup contest? Actually, no. Not only that, but the mash mixes were going to be featured

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:58.360
on his CD. I guess that's not very important. But hey, go ahead. Play with Fruity Loops

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:02.040
because you're better than I am because you know how to program instruments in MIDI. You

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:07.040
You know what, so what. I don't care. So I'm, you know, not programming shit, but you know what that is.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.040
Not to say that all the Fruity Loops remix stuff sucks, because there is some good stuff.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.040
No, there's really good stuff. There's really good stuff out there, but there's also bad stuff too.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:21.040
That is really good too, and I think we need to recognize that mash mixes can be good when they're not stupid, basically.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040
Let me just put it this way.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.040
When they're not mash insert bambis on here.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.040
Yeah, everybody out there uses samples, whether you guys wanna, you know, recognize that or not.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.320
and you know what it's just that's the way it is people

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.200
but you can put you can program your own like you know

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:42.800
um you can like remix you know you can like actually you know

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.040
add you know synth on top of this stuff that's what I need to learn see once I

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.240
learn the Fruity Loop stuff

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.680
I'll be able to do that much more with it yeah I think you should keep working at it

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.720
honestly because seriously I think if you were just

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.400
if somebody were to give you money and say take a week

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.800
and take a DDR song and put in public domain stuff and originals that you can come up with and prove your loops,

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.600
you would have an awesome DDR song.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.600
Well, here's the situation, though. If you were to actually, like, say, Konami went to,

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.800
I want you to remix this song. What they'll give you is they'll give you, like, this song,

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.600
all the samples that were in it and all the arrangements that are in it, like, basically the 8-track, the digital track,

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.400
it's a lot easier to work with raw, you know, tracks than just, you know, everything in the composition,

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.400
so it's a lot harder to do it that way.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:37.400
That's why when, you know, Pumpknight gave me stuff to remix, it would be an EJ, he gave me all the samples that he used, and the arrangements they had, so you can just go in there, rearrange it, and add your own stuff into it, and it's a lot easier and sounds better.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.400
That's, you know, they're not gonna just say, oh, we want you to take something that was on the soundtrack and remix it, so.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
though.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.560
Yeah, whatever, but, yeah.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.860
Honestly, if you were to send that in a contest and they were to reject it for any reason...

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:56.640
I mean, if they were to say, well, we don't want commercial songs or something, if that

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.560
were the reason, then whatever, but if they were to say they're rejecting it because it's

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.480
a match mix, they're being stupid.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.120
They're stupid and their contest doesn't deserve your attention anyway.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.100
I just don't care.

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:25.100
I want to hear what their stuff was in there, because if it's any good, that's cool, but there's stuff that sucks too, you know?

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:32.100
I mean, I don't know. Here's the thing though. I don't consider it a remix if you remake the song in Fruity Loops.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:42.100
If you take like Synth and just basically remake the song, it sounds the same but it's a little different because you didn't quite get the right, you know, samples.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.100
That's not a remix. That's just stupid.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.100
Whatever.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:54.500
Well, all right keep working at it. That's some good stuff. I really I personally really really really like that one. I think you're you're you're

01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:00.920
Waving your hand at it too much going. It sucks. I was really good personally. All right

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:08.420
Skypline is open if you have it if you have a comment on that remix or comment on anything

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:11.580
We've talked about during this show so far really we'll get around to that

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.740
We're gonna get to the F use a little bit and no sorry. You will not be able to do your F use over Skype

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.380
We haven't the segments too long as it is. We need to not make it any longer. So

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:26.380
Yeah, you can still send those in over private message. We'll be doing that later

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.100
Okay

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.620
In fact, if you want to send in your F use of the week

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.740
You can go ahead and start sending those in now over private message

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.260
We'll start taking those because we're gonna get to that segment pretty soon. But first I did want to

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:41.440
Allow Loki to talk about we've been talking about remix contest, but what's going on in the sim scene?

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.740
I know there's some somewhat big news

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.740
Really? I sure as hell don't know what it is.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:50.740
Well, what about the announcement from the Phoon Team?

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.740
Oh yeah, Phoon Mix Plus. That's going to be coming out in August.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.740
So look for that. That should be cool.

01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.740
The other thing that I thought was interesting about Phoon Mix

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:04.740
is I found this site, which is the group that actually did it.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.740
Silly Walker. That's the site.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.740
And they're basically just like the verse systems. They're awesome.

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.740
But I can't order their music because it's not in English.

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:16.500
and you know it's all through these Dodinci sites and stuff like that

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.740
they're all in Japanese and I can't order through them so that sucks but

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:23.980
they have a ton of cool shit and they're the ones behind

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:31.540
DDR food mix so it's really cool and yeah so food mix plush should be coming

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:35.580
out they didn't really say what's gonna be in it probably just some additional

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.940
songs and whatnot but hey it's cool well actually there might be some additional

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:45.940
original songs, and edit steps, because I know they had edit steps on their website, so that'd be kind of neat.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:51.940
Um, and Turning Mix 5, I have no fucking clue what's going on with that, so let's take a look-see here.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:57.940
Um, last thing I heard, they were in, like, sway votes, or public sway votes, or something like that.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.940
And I have no idea what they're doing, semi-finals, finals.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.940
What the fuck is a sway vote?

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:13.940
In the semi-finals, they just finished that. Now they're on finals. Let's see what we can vote on. Oh, I have to be logged in. Fuck that.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:23.940
Okay, so, yeah, they're in finals. I have no idea who won, what's going on, but all I know is Kimo Sabe did not make it in there, and that makes me sad.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.940
Did that Just Like Naoki song make it in there?

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:32.940
Actually, here's the songs that were considered in the semi-finals.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:37.940
Like, let's see, we've got Domo Domo Domo, the KCP remix, so...

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.940
Whatever that is. Just like Naoki.

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.940
Roppongi Canyon, it looks like it was.

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:50.940
Yeah. Let's see, Lemmings, and Pear Pear All Stars, One More Lovely.

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.340
there was a look at

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:54.940
look at the heaven halloween

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.220
kick your a by art style

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.420
uh...

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:02.380
then we have party for you holy night makes stronger uh...

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:06.300
joju uh... coca-roll no pushing the law

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.460
nari nari

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.740
whatever that is on the

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:15.700
crap konichiwa another body got told up another kick here and i think this is

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:19.480
semi files right here i think that that file so kick your a

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.240
one more lovely r u

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.840
you know it's kind of sad it's always a remix of like a baumanni song

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.840
you know what i'm saying it's always like

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.840
i want a super hard song that's like you know ooh it's something like baumanni ruler used to do

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.520
didn't the rules say that it has to be like patable?

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.400
did the rules say it has to be like patable?

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.440
yeah they're just being such

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.860
dumbass idiots

01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:43.960
so that's what's going on there uh... interesting as far as other stuff um...

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.560
really that's been slow on all the like sites

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:54.560
I haven't really found any new, like, really good sim files or anything. I've just been, um, playing what I had.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:02.560
Um, there are some really cool tutorials, though, on DDRMania X, especially stuff to make your skin look more like in the groove, which is kind of neat.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:11.560
They have, like, you know, the little, um, uh, what was it, the, uh, how, how well you did, and, you know, the little graph there, just, like, in BeatMania.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:21.560
They have how you can put that in your sim, how to make a combo bar, which is kind of neat, and some other stuff that will really help out your skins.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:30.560
So just look for those, they're really good tutorials. And that's pretty much all with that.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:41.040
Alrighty. Again, if you guys are just tuning in, because I know more people are starting

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.200
to tune into the show as we go along here, we do have this new feature where you can

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:52.920
call into the show www.skype.com, S-K-Y-P-E dot com, and you download the program over

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:57.080
there and you can add the username Orange Launch Radio, all one word, to your list.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:01.680
and if you have a broadband connection, you can actually call us and it's just like a

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.600
phone call except it doesn't cost you anything, it doesn't cost me anything because it's all

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:13.220
over our internet connection. So, do give us a call. It's fun. So, but do make sure

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.480
you close your torrents and have the maximum bandwidth possible before calling because

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:24.040
otherwise it messes up. Okay, so I guess since nobody is calling in on the Skype right now,

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.040
Now maybe we'll go to another break, then we're gonna come back and do the FUs.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.040
Sounds good to me.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.040
Yes, Jamie, you have a thought?

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.040
No, I just wanted the microphone because it comforts me.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.040
Why does having the microphone comfort you?

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.040
I don't know. It just does!

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:49.040
I'm happy because I'm in fourth in line to get the Megamix from GTA III for Rise FM, which has the song I'm looking for.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.040
Neo The One by Slider.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.040
Uh, I got a call on the Skype line. What's up? You're on Orange Lounge.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.040
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.040
You're at least trying to be.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.040
Please say something.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.040
Is it us that slides really fast?

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040
Hello, yes, I am here.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.040
You there? Richie? Again?

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040
No.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040
Yeah.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040
How you doing? What's up?

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040
Uh, it's not calling again.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040
Okay.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040
I just want to haggle over here.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:21.040
Well, that's alright. Nobody else wants to call in, so we've got you.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.920

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.440

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.840
i think looking to me because i think you should like

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.560
you know like to be done for life

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.080
uh... oc remix whatever i think they're i think they're really great you know

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:38.880
it's like

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.760
you know what

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.000
he's doing with you know it's like

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.360
songs in display

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.640
going like a whole new way

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.080
hey richie speak a little bit louder so we can hear you kiss sorry that's right

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:48.640
now

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.820
yes i can hear you know

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:54.320
Yeah, I'm just saying that, yeah, Loki should submit some of his stuff to OC Remix.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.320
I think it sounds professional, really.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:03.320
I mean, I had one of my teachers at my school listen to some of Loki's remixes,

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.320
and he was wondering, hey, do you know who this guy is?

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.820
And I was saying, oh, it's a friend of mine from Sacramento.

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:14.320
He just does this for fun. He's all saying he should go, you know, he should do acts.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.320
We're having a hard time hearing you.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.320
He's sounding very mumbling.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.820
I'm going to relay your question over to Loki because I can hear it okay.

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:23.820
Loki, it sounds like he's playing it for some folks at school, and you're famous! You're getting famous!

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.820
And they seem to like it.

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.820
OC Remix, would you ever consider sending something like that?

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:31.820
I would if I didn't use some other commercial songs.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.820
That's the problem.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.820
That's the thing that's stopping you, huh?

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.820
Oh yeah, it's true, it's true.

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:35.820
Have you thought about-

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.820
Can you hear me better now, or is my mic still like-

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.820
I can hear you a little better now. That's better.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:40.820
There you go.

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.820
Let's see, other than that, well, I mean, keep up the good work, Loki.

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.820
I'm looking forward to any new remixes you might have.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:47.820
No?

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.540
Keep up the good work. Yeah. Remix more stuff. Okay. Thanks for calling, Richie.

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.580
Yeah, no problemo. See you guys later. See ya.

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:58.300
Don't worry about hogging up all the air time there, Richie, because the other

01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.500
folks are just pussies.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:04.100
Don't want to call. It's a new thing. I mean, I can't expect everybody to get on board the first week.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.260
It's new. Yeah, it's new.

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.780
Well, that's all right, because you shouldn't have Winamp going while you're trying to call in

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.180
anyway. It sounds really bad.

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:23.180
So, Loki, have you thought about trying to, um, maybe do something with public domain samples?

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:32.180
I thought about it. I'm starting to go more that way anyways, cause like, with this song even, I used a lot of those BT public domain samples that I got.

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:39.180
Didn't you say there was something, didn't you do one a while back where you remixed a song with other video game samples or something?

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:45.180
So that's the kind of thing OCRemix would eat up, if it was video game music mixed with other video game music, I think.

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:55.180
I don't think I did. The only song that's sort of like, just a bunch of different songs was that Dynamis one, which was like kind of eh, you know.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.180
Uh, I could just, I don't know.

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:03.180
I'm pretty much like, I like this stuff, um,

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:07.180
if I learned how to do, like, DMS files or something like that, you know, that'd be kickass.

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:11.180
It's just really, I don't have a lot of music theory and stuff, I never took the classes,

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:15.180
don't know shit about, I mean, I understand, you know, you know, structure of a song

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:19.180
and stuff, it just... Didn't they say that a Kiryamoka couldn't even read music

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:23.180
when he started? I don't know. I could've sworn I read that on some bad site. It's probably, it's just like, I just need to

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:29.200
to have like, cause I need like a, you know, some of the set stuff, like, you know, scales

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.820
and stuff like that, cause really if you listen to a lot of songs, they're the same scales,

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:36.800
it's the same structure, they're very simple, they just use really elaborate samples, that's

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:43.060
all it is. So, I mean, pretty much every single fucking trance song, you always have a four

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:46.560
on the floor, and then you have some beat that's going at, you know, in twelfth notes,

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:53.120
and that's it. It's every single, yeah, it's every single, you know, trance song out there

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:59.160
pretty much. I tried last night to make another Revenge Neo song. It didn't turn out very

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:07.360
well. That was like, I tried, what was it, I was mixing that one Revenge song from Poppin'

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:16.040
Music. It was the, I can't even, the one that sounds sort of like Exotic Ethnic but not.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.320
I tried mixing it with Exotic Thick, and that really sucked. It did not sell well at all.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.760
So, I don't know. I want to get some, like, sample kits and stuff. I'm just kind of weary

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:35.520
to do that, because I have, like, 30,000 public domain samples on, like, about 20 CDs or so,

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:43.780
20 plus CDs, and I don't use any of them. I use about two. Two out of those. So, I don't

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:51.780
I don't know, I just have to kind of go through and look at all those samples again, because I had them all ripped to my hard drive, and it just took up too much space, so, I don't know.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:59.780
Alright, well, what we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, the FUs of the week. We're going to get ranty.

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:10.780
The chat room's getting mad at me because I'm calling them all pussies, and they're like, Skype doesn't work out, yeah, I'll have Aaron call you a pussy instead.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:19.780
or she'll barf up along. No, actually, but some of them, I guess Skype only works on Windows XP, I guess, so that messes some people up.

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.780
And why don't you have Windows XP?

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:28.780
Well, you know, some people don't. You know, there's Macs, Linux, some people still want to use ME, whatever.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:36.780
If you have a Mac, okay. If you have Linux, okay. But if you're using any other kind of former Windows, why don't you have Windows XP?

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:41.540
challenging somebody on their operating system though is such a nerd war. You're

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.500
just waiting

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:46.500
to get lashed at for challenging someone on their operating system.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.260
Here comes the chat room. Here they come. There is by the way a certain build we start off with

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.220
Windows 3.11 build up through to 2000

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:57.060
but you take I think 3.11 upgrade that

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:01.180
to NT, upgrade that to 2000. It's supposed to be the most secure

01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:04.700
way to run Windows. Much more secure than XP.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:09.220
there and I know a lot of people who do it that way anyway

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:17.180
will still run anyway okay so and you remember what happened you know but I

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:20.940
see that we've got a ton of people on our Skype list so I know that there's

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:28.660
more people than just one calling in so it's alright that's alright that's alright

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:35.480
we're gonna go you just like saying the word pussy don't you Aaron I love this

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:43.640
show all right we'll be back we'll be back with the F use of the week which

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.440
you can send over a private message but please no F used to Brad for his

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.160
operating system rant because I just don't want to go there tonight all right

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:58.160
We'll be back.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:44.160
I'm the easement of the circle, magic tree I told your daughter, can't take off her weave

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:21.160
If you still look down there and pray, yeah

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:51.160
How can I know what to think is? How do I know what's going on?

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:58.160
Don't make it hard to believe it Don't make it hard to go on

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:05.160
Put a little faith in me now Put a little trust in me somehow

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.160
Cause when I hold you I'm half a pound

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.160
Cause it's more than a feeling

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:15.160
In my mind, in my dream

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:18.160
You will love me to be somebody

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.160
Just in my heart and I can feel

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:27.160
You will take me to recovery

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.160
I wanna make you love me for forever

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:38.880
All of me, all of me

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:42.300

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:53.180
Oh, yeah, yeah

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:25.180
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.180
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.180
No!

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.180
Do we care what people think of us?

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.180
No!

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.180
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.180
Yes!

01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:44.180
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:49.180
We are back, Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are, episode number 103.

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:54.180
You know what, Rob? Pretty soon we'll get to use the other promo again.

01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:58.180
I know, because Pump Up The Volume is doing it. When are you officially moving that?

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:03.180
Well, I start school August 16th, but I think I have an orientation the week before,

01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:07.180
so it's probably going to be either the first or second week in August.

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:10.180
Alright, but this week you can hear Pump Up The Volume what night?

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:12.180
Monday. Monday is Sunday.

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:16.180
And what happens on Monday night at 7 and 7.30?

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:20.180
Well, actually I've started my pre-show a whole lot earlier now because I usually just get bored.

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:24.180
Pre-show's been now starting about 6.45.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:28.180
6.45 to 7 o'clock. And then around 7.30

01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:32.180
I start the normal show and it's supposed to end at 10.30, but sometimes I just stay

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:36.180
bored and keep going. You're basically just a radio whore. I'm such a whore.

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:40.180
So what do you do on that show? It's supposedly a request show, but nobody ever

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:52.260
request anything anymore except Dark Knight. Angel does sometimes when she's there. If

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:57.660
you hang out in our chat room, like many of you are right now, you can request to spend

01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:02.340
any song that you want to listen to. I've got access now to more music so my library

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:09.800
will just be growing. So, in fact, I'm also, I've been trying to start a segment on my

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:16.460
show that's Dark Sakura email, much in the vein of Strong Bad email, where I answer your

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:22.960
email. Will you talk with a voice like this? I'm not going to be doing the... Dear Dark

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:28.320
Sakura. No, I'm kidding. I'm not going to be talking in the Strong Bad voice. You take

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:34.000
some stuff, add some more stuff, and answer the email. I'm not going to be doing that,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:45.000
no. So, just send me a private message on our forums. Hint, hint, hint at orangejonesradio.com.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.680
But really you can do anything with our forums. Because nobody uses them for anything. Or

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:58.040
shoot me an email to darksakra at gmail.com. Because you can send it right to me. Or you

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:07.720
We can send it to our other email at orangeonsradio.yahoo.com.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.720
And I prefer having mp3s to OGGs, thank you.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.700
I can use them, but I can't play them on the station.

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:21.400
Tuesday nights is Diversion, the Orange Ons Radio remix show, which will not be live for

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.160
the next couple of weeks because I'm not going to be in town, but do enjoy the great music

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160
on there.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.080
and bump up the playlist a little bit before I leave town.

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.800
And there's some really good stuff.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:31.660
Awesome music.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.280
Some more people have been tuning in lately and just

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.920
hearing what a great show that is.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.640
If you like Loki's remixes, there's tons of very talented

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.240
people just like them out there remixing with Monty songs.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.800
And we like to give all those songs a place to be heard.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.400
So the version's that place.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.880
7 o'clock Tuesday nights here on the station.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:49.640
Wednesday nights are empty right now, but I hope to have

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.060
an announcement about Vanilla Sky when I

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:53.520
get back from my trip.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.520
yes lanky style

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.400
he's picking his nose that's alright

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.460
remember

01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:02.680
you can pick your friends

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:04.780
you can pick your nose

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.040
but if you pick your friend's nose you're a big gross

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.760
you're

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.200
paraplegic and they need their nose picked

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.620
god damn it i'm doing them a favor

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.700
anyway if you need to

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:21.160
this is what squeezers are for okay

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:27.260
I don't care about the handicap. I just want to make that clear.

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:31.040
You have a fetish for picking the nose of paraplegics. That's it.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:36.040
When did this show derail that quickly? That's what I want to know.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:43.040
When? How about episode two, when I wasn't here?

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.840
uh...

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.040
how about on that uh... bar train

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.120
uh...

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.400
moving on there's actually some actual other bamani news going on this weekend

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.180
as bamani news that doesn't involve california do we have high money action

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:03.040
california

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:06.560
california

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.560
this is uh... lows

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.900
lows is a big theater chain

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.640
I don't know if they have any Lowe's here in California.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.640
I don't know.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.280
I know what Lowe's is.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.880
No it's not Lowe's hardware store, it's Lowe's theater chain.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.520
They are hosting an ultimate film fan contest and for whatever reason being an ultimate

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:32.080
film fan involves lots of Sony Playstation 2 video games.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:40.500
Because they will be having these local events going on where you can play Karaoke Revolution

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:48.340
Volume 2 and, get this, DDR Extreme before it comes out.

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:51.100
Before it comes out, you'll be able to play DDR Extreme.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.940
And these are all happening on the East Coast.

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:58.840
It's going from Texas to Michigan to Jersey to New York, Massachusetts, Washington, that's

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.860
about the closest it's going to get to here, Ohio, New York, Maryland, and Illinois.

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:07.540
This is running from July through September, so if you live in one of those areas, you

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:12.300
You want to get a jump on Extreme and you want to check it out and see what it's all

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:19.140
about, definitely check out this Lowes Film Fan thing going on and you can play Extreme

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:20.140
before anyone else.

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:24.840
Of course Karaoke Revolution Volume 2, that's already out, so, but, I mean, you can play

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:25.840
it here if you want.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.940
I think they left California out on purpose.

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:28.940
Maybe.

01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:29.940
Oh.

01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:36.540
I'm getting a news flash here, actually, right now.

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:40.780
Mel B is sending us something, our buddy from ddrspot.com, check them out, they're going

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.620
to have some interviews up this week, you're going to want to see.

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:47.820
But Mel B wants me to pass this along.

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:54.400
There will be a Konami booth at Comic Con in San Diego this week, Thursday through Sunday.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:01.380
At the booth will be the most recent demos of DDR Extreme and UltraMix 2 for PS2 and

01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:02.380
Xbox.

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:05.420
So, what do you think that's going to mean we're going to have next week?

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:21.420
New song list. So if you want to check out what some of the new songs on these demos are going to be, Thursday through Sunday, Comic Con, San Diego, Konami will also be doing contests and giveaways.

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:26.420
Fabulous prizes. California doesn't miss out completely.

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:30.920
You know, I want to know, why do people always leave out my home state with this?

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.920
We need DDR contests in Alabama.

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:33.920
We do?

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.920
Yes.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.920
People in the South play DDR too.

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.920
Skype line's open if you have a comment.

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.920
Okay, we're going to leave out the Wayne's World jokes.

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.920
Alright.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.920
All of us!

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:51.420
Well, we'll get into the FUs here a little bit, but

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:55.920
I still am trying to figure out why a movie theater would just randomly have DDR,

01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.000
Then I kind of think back to the Metreon, how they have the DDR- what?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
What is Brad saying over there? What?

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.520
We were making a joke about people calling so I was

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:10.400
breaking into the Blondie song and I was doing the whole

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.120
sex line thing.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.880
Pick up the phone! Does that only air in this area?

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.600
Or is that a nationwide commercial? It's nationwide. It's been on

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:26.520
on TV forever. It's always on during Jerry Springer. I just...

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:31.680
I love when the sci-fi channel used to do Saturday Night Anime

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.720
and then they changed it to Saturday morning anime and they always used to

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.960
play those commercials between

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.120
like in the commercial break you know so they got anime which is considered

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.500
cartoons you know over here.

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:43.520
Alright we got a call. We got a call. Hey! Don't interrupt me!

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:47.160
They can hold. They can hold. Okay I'm finished.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.640
Alright, we got a caller.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.920
You're on Orange Lounge. I hope I'm not interrupting.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:58.160
No, it's alright. It's cool. Who's that? Hello again, Sky. It's me,

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.400
Siggy. Hi, Siggy. How you doing? Yeah. Got a comment?

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:05.520
Well, just a random stuff. You know, in case you have any

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.320
problems, you know, problems pronouncing Japanese titles or Japanese names, you

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.300
know, don't hesitate to call me.

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:15.200
Which, by the... Um, you could ask me, but they never do.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.560
Yeah, but you see, you're never here, so I'm just kidding. Excuse you!

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.560
I'm just kidding. I just wanted to get the glare.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:27.560
I think it's much funnier to hear Rob destroy the Japanese language.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:31.560
Yeah, isn't it funnier to hear me stumble through it, though? I think that's why Jamie doesn't bother

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:35.560
to step in and correct me, because it's so much funnier when I fuck it up.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.560
At least you're finally saying Sakura right, sort of. Sakura?

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.560
Sakura? Sakura. Dark Sakura?

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.560
Dark says... Wait a minute, actually...

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:56.240
I've been studying Japanese since I was 9 years old so all I can say is my accent is

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:59.080
already 95% accurate.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.920
Do you actually have Japanese in your blood or have you just been otaku since birth?

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:05.480
Well actually I learned it by accident.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.440
How did that work?

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:16.040
Back in the Philippines where I was actually born there were a few channels and then one

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:20.840
One of them is a Japanese learning show, and then I'll learn how to speak Japanese.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.480
That's where I got my accent and my grammar.

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.480
Interesting.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:26.480
Hmm.

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.480
All right.

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.480
Cool.

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.480
Shiba Rashi.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:35.300
Anything else you want to comment on besides your offer to correct me when I screw up,

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:36.300
which is quite often?

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:40.440
Well, it's not really a screw up, but it's just, you know, if you're having fun.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:41.440
Yeah, it is.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.440
Oh, Rob.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.440
He's so funny.

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.440
He's so white.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:51.440
Alright, thanks for calling, Siggy.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.520
We will hear from you later take care

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:04.040
I think I have that old promo

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.660
hold on here we go here's how wide and I think it's in this promo

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:13.560
Hello out there

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.060
This is Rob, but you might know me in the online world as Skye.

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:21.560
On June 23rd at 7pm Pacific Time, join DarkSakura and I for the...

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:25.060
I don't remember that!

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.060
Did I fuss?

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.560
You totally fussed!

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.060
I totally fussed at you for that!

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:38.060
...at 7pm Pacific Time, join DarkSakura and I for the Orange Lounge.

01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:43.060
Also, that's actually grammatically incorrect because you don't use and I, it would be in me.

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:45.060
Whatever

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:52.100
You're going the grammar police man, I'm double

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:57.780
As an object it was two years ago. Give me a break

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:03.400
It was when I was a radio amateur Kansai

01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:08.420
Dude Kansai Ben is like so hot

01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:09.700
I told them ski.

01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.700
Yeah, ski.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:12.420
Yeah, just call me ski.

01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:13.420
That pisses me off enough.

01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:14.420
No, I'm kidding.

01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:15.420
It doesn't piss me off.

01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:19.340
Actually, yeah, because somebody I really like still calls me ski to this day, so I

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:20.340
just learned to deal with it.

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:21.340
It's cool.

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:22.340
Gee!

01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:23.340
Shut up.

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:26.820
I didn't say it was you, Aaron.

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:32.380
Okay, the difference in Kansai is like, I'm trying to be like, if it's so saying like

01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:37.820
Like Nani Desuka, you'd say Nani Atenka, something like that.

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:41.420
It's a different dialect of Japanese.

01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:42.420
Arigato?

01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:43.420
Arigato.

01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:50.820
You say arigato like we say arigato.

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:53.580
Right.

01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.580
Sony Chiba is the man.

01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:58.500
What did he say?

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.960
Okay, he's like, what did he say after that?

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:02.800
Very good.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.100
Okay, I think what we need to do

01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:13.920
is go into the FUs of the week.

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:14.760
What do you guys think?

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.200
Woohoo, my favorite part.

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.800
All right, remember, we only have a half hour show left,

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.880
so let's try to keep this a relatively good length here.

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.100
So here we go.

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:31.700
Uh, here we go, we're going to start it off, uh, Dark Sakura, are you ready?

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:33.280
Yeah, I'm ready to be randy.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.820
Dark Sakura, are you ready to go?

01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:37.420
Okay, you can eat, where's the ferret?

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:41.500
Alright, what do we do during the FUs of the week?

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.500
We throw paper towels at Rob.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:36:03.740
Hey, I need that ferret! Don't wipe it on your... F you to wiping the ferret on your

01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:08.260
ass, okay? Go ahead and rob now.

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:09.260
Oh, eh.

01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.260
Give me that.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.260
Anyway...

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:17.260
You get that ferret thrown at your head and rob you from under his head.

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:20.260
F.U. time. Let's do it.

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:23.260
F.U. to all you people for distracting me. Okay.

01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:24.260
Oh, okay.

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:28.260
Hahahaha.

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:31.260
Oh. Those people.

01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:37.260
Anyway, um, F.U. to distracting me because I've been so easily distracted all day.

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:44.960
And as you to being fatigued all damn day. I'm trying to go out and spend a day with my fiancee, you know

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.940
Spending money which I consider highly romantic because money is the way to win my heart

01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:55.940
Sex has nothing to do with it. It's money

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.840
No money is the mean

01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:04.560
And sex is just the stuff that happens

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.720
sex is what you get when you give me money

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.800
hey are you saying that I am a whore?

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.120
I didn't say anything you just did

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:20.160
it robs the whore

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.800
yeah that's the story of my life anyway

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.120
I'm really not that shallow by the way but still we were going out

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.240
we were going laserdisc hunting today because I found

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:33.800
the beauty and the beast work in progress laserdisc which goes for like

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:40.360
a hundred something dollars on eBay for ten bucks last night and I was going

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:46.280
going back to buy more leggings tonight anyway I was getting so tired and Dan's

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:51.920
like let's go to the Tower books so I can sit in this chair and read a book

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:58.080
about Pac-Man merchandise for an hour while his poor poor poor suffering

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.480
fiance has to go to the bathroom and there's no public bathroom at Tower

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:07.000
books. Okay Dan hurry up. Okay Dan hurry up. Okay Dan hurry up. Okay Dan hurry up. And

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.480
finally I'm like get your ass out of the chair. I have to go to the bathroom. So, it wasn't

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:22.480
really like that, but, but we, yeah it was the poultry emergency. I was about to do the

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:31.480
dance. Anyway, um, another F.U. goes toward, um, like people who, SUV drivers in general.

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:37.080
There are, I have to say, a few people out there who know how to responsibly drive their

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.040
vehicle and then there's everybody else who ruins it for the few who do.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.900
You people do not need to be driving a vehicle that big, okay?

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:51.400
That's why I want my freaking rebuilt Humvee with an assault rifle built onto it so I can

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:57.040
gun your asses down and drive over you in my armored vehicle and not have you all in

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:07.540
my way and I will stay in my lane and abide by the speed limit okay and my gun

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:12.820
will be on a torrent yeah so I can get the people who are trying to get behind

01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:17.020
me oh you tell game ass you're dead to you the

01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:25.740
road okay I just need my own road okay I need the Jetsons car so that I don't

01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:31.140
have to deal with traffic I need my own jet Rob I want a jet maybe that's why

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:38.520
I'll make a note of that another F you goes toward my schedule for being so

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.300
damn busy this week that I haven't been able to get to the gym as much as I

01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:47.760
wanted to I supposed to go running today I was up so late last night another F you

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:53.920
goes to insomnia because I have it really bad another F you goes toward

01:39:53.920 --> 01:40:01.300
money for not having much of it distance for it existing and not being able to go

01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:06.640
where I want to go or see who I want to see or do what I want to do another SU

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.380
goes toward the general attitude in this state because I'm getting really sick of

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:14.620
it and I really really need to just get back to Alabama for a week so that I can

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:18.500
be around people who were relatively polite and have good manners at least to

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:26.480
your face um I just it's just been kind of a and it's gonna be a crap yeah

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.440
another SU to peak season at my job all of you people who are trying to go to

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:36.280
school and I guess that's including me you know try calling your financial aid

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.640
office instead of calling me first even though they probably don't know what

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:47.480
they're doing yeah and a big SU goes to a RC's financial aid office learn the

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:53.100
freaking student aid process and tell it to other people. If one of you is going to say

01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:57.260
something to somebody, make sure all of you are saying the same thing. Instead of one

01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:03.420
person saying thing A, one person saying thing B, just stay on the right page. Stay on the

01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:12.020
same page. At least be consistent with your information. And that's really, I guess, about

01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:19.460
it. I've gotten the angst out. They're currently sitting over there molesting the ferrets furiously

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:24.900
in a stroking manner. And I think the ferret likes it. And I bet Rob doesn't know what

01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:31.060
I just said. Yes, because I was saying goodbye to Brad because he's leaving. Bye, Brad. Bye.

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:38.740
Meanwhile, Loki's cock is just stiff and erect. Half hour show, Jamie. Half hour left in the

01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:40.540
the show jimmy and i'm going to try

01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:44.420
i think that i think that i think that you are going to be sorry i think you

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:45.780
are right

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:51.780
moving on uh... logy's turn

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:55.260
after that

01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:56.080
okay

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.300
uh... anyway uh...

01:41:58.300 --> 01:41:59.380
like you too

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.740
uh...

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:03.600
to radio shack because

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.340
like if the computers break and you start to panic party must be there to

01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:11.840
know how to fix things. Yeah, I thought that's what Radio Shack was. Just fix things, sell

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:18.560
me satellite dishes and cell phones. Oh, and batteries. Um, so you suck. And, f you to

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:23.660
stupid SUV drivers because you suck and you can't drive your SUV, you think it's like

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:29.660
a race car or like a highly maneuverable car or a car that will just, you know, let go

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:35.500
of the wheel and it will drive in the lane. No, it's not a compact car. Sorry, it's no,

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:41.180
not a um... it just sucks. Don't drive an SUV if you don't have kids or if you're driving

01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:46.380
alone. You should have another car for driving when you're alone. It should be a one person

01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:51.020
car. Not this car that can hold 50 people. You don't see bus drivers driving buses around

01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:55.100
aimlessly without anyone in there in parking and compact spaces. I do not expect you to

01:42:55.100 --> 01:43:00.700
be doing the same. So please, do not park your SUVs in compact spaces. I don't like

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:04.700
And those stupid fuckers that park on the line.

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.700
Just because your tire is on the line does not count.

01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:08.700
It needs to be in the line.

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:12.700
You know, I can't open my door when you're on the line and the person next to me is on the line.

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:17.700
Or over the line because your SUV is too big and you're parking in a compact space.

01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:21.700
God you people are so stupid you won't walk the extra few feet because

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:29.700
OH MY GOD all that SUV driving has gotten me tired and if I have to stand this heat for any longer I'm gonna die!

01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:40.700
I'm also fucking stupid kids with laser pointers in movie theaters. You're not funny. And no, you cannot destroy the robots with laser pointers. It just does not work.

01:43:40.700 --> 01:44:01.700
Also, um, fuck you to the stupid previews before movies, because, you know, that's just the lane of my movie watching time, and I really don't want to see another preview for The Manchurian Candidates. I will not see that movie. It's a remake. If I wanted to see the movie, I'd watch the original, not with Denzel Washington.

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:13.380
And finally, finally, finally, um, fuck you to the goddamn people at round table, because

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:17.980
I go there to get a lunch buffet, and they have to be jackasses and go, I DON'T WANNA

01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:21.980
MAKE PIZZAS FOR THE BUFFET, WELL DON'T OFFER A BUFFET IF YOU DON'T WANNA MAKE PIZZAS FOR

01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:26.260
THE BUFFET, AND THEN YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SPAR- HEY, I'M GONNA MAKE A VEGETARIAN PIZZA,

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:32.720
I have to wait, you know, forever for them to make god damn pizzas. Just pop in a couple

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:38.580
pepperonis, they take less than a few seconds to make, okay? And stop whining. I mean, I

01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:44.980
swear to god, it's not like, you know, you're going to be there forever. And I'm done. Alright,

01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:54.820
moving on, my turn. My nephew goes to stress, especially before this trip, I have to take

01:44:54.820 --> 01:45:00.180
by myself. I have a hard time going to the bathroom by myself, let alone having to travel

01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:04.020
back to the East Coast. Don't give me a funny look when I say that, Aaron. Girls go to the

01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:05.500
bathroom together all the time.

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.500
Oh, interesting.

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:17.380
You know, I just, I don't, I'm really distressed about the trip, and yeah, but, you know, what

01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:23.900
can you do? And I nephew to the fact I'm going to miss all the good TV shows while I'm gone,

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:27.940
because I do watch all my TV through BitTorrent, and I'm not going to be able to do that while

01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:31.720
I'm out. After the fact, I wasn't able to get a laptop for my trip, so I will have absolutely

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:36.760
nothing to do at night except masturbate. But that's alright, because I'm going to get

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:43.760
a lot of that done. But Aaron, I can safely say I won't be thinking of you when I do it.

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:50.580
So allow me to be the first DDR male to tell you that. I will not be thinking of you when

01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:57.580
and I masturbate.

01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:01.940
Oh, sometimes I wish Loki was

01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:05.360
my touch 24-7.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:12.700
I'll be thinking of that comment right there, yeah.

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:15.180
It's a good thing he didn't hear a dark circle.

01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:19.680
And uh, I had other FUs, but I forget what they were, so I guess I'll just, you know, move on.

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:21.180
Oh...

01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:24.680
Um...

01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:26.680
I guess that's it. Alright, moving on.

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.180
Let's hear from other folks in our studio right now. We'll start it off with...

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:32.680
Violent Hyper Girl.

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.680
Hi! Okay. Um...

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.680
FU to, uh, stupid fanboys who publicly post on forums saying they want to have sex with me.

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.360
Please give it to yourself. It's a fucking public fall

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:52.800
Jesus desperate people do it if you want sex that badly go find a whore

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.520
Or something and not to my routine

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:12.680
my CVPL routine does not constitute as porn or masturbation fodder

01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:21.480
okay um f you yeah it's actually it should actually be illegal because i was under 18

01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:33.040

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:43.400
shower? It doesn't kill you to take like ten minutes out of the day to shower, okay? That's

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:48.560
why people go to cons, is to not shower. You're talking about the lobby boys, the ones who

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:57.260
sleep in the lobby, right? Or even the people in hotel rooms! I mean, like, showers! There's

01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:04.040
showers! Okay. Yeah, at least one. You're not gonna shower for all four days. At least

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:11.400
shower for one of the days.

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:16.040
For those who didn't hear Jamie's comment, she said, it's Anime Expo. What are they gonna

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:27.640

But yeah, please, don't suffocate us.

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:09.760
Another F.U. goes out to physics, for obvious reasons, I don't have to really state why.

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.880
Yeah, just physics.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:17.340
F.U. goes out to being sick, but I honestly kind of don't care because I was helping out

01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:22.980
a friend who was sick, so I knew what I was putting myself out in front of, so I kind

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:32.980
of accept the responsibility for getting myself sick. So yeah. And um, let's see, I can't

01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:37.980
really think of anything else other than the fanboy issue which I could go off on for hours

01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:44.980
We have 10 minutes left on the show, so you're not going to do that.

01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:45.980
Oh.

01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:46.980
Yeah.

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:47.980
But, uh, yeah.

01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.980
We can move on.

01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:49.980
Moving on.

01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:50.980
Jonas.

01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:53.980
Oh, let me touch the cock first.

01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:58.980
Okay, I was talking about that.

01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:06.980
Okay, the first SD goes to Inzuma of 469 for almost screwing my tournament up in June 25th

01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:10.980
Who the hell do you think you are trying to control my tournament?

01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:12.980
Who the hell do you think you are saying,

01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:14.980
OOH THE PET PEDO DOESN'T WORK!

01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:17.980
Well get used to their fucking pads,

01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:20.980
these are the best damn pads out there in Sacramento,

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:22.980
in case you haven't been there Sky.

01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:24.980
I haven't.

01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:26.980
Okay?

01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:29.980
And quit your whining about,

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:32.980
for one and a half hours you delayed the whole tournament,

01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:34.980
everyone was bitching at me.

01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:41.300
up those pads are so squeaky clean that i can see aaron's image in them oh yeah oh yeah

01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:43.540
oh yeah right there

01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:56.740
oh man okay the next empty goes to this bitch at work

01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:05.300
Well not, well it's like some b**** customer who's saying, oh you're a freakin, I'm a good

01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:09.740
woman and you're just a f****** worker just getting minimum wage, who the f*** do you

01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:13.560
think you are calling me a low class person?

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:18.140
First of all, second of all we kicked everybody out of the trap because, this is the German

01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:22.860
Repairer's Island as I work there, this, first of all your kids can't drive for s***, it

01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:29.420
no bumping and you're killing my ass trying to get me fired well fuck you

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:34.420
I'm gonna kick your ass if I have a chance I have a whip on my car all

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:45.380
spiked up in braids. Does it have braids Aaron? They could. They could eh? How long is the whip?

01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:50.380
Damn! Okay, and I'll get another ask you guys too.

01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:56.380
Sony spiked up my freakin' strawberry daiquiri drink.

01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:01.380
You put a hell of vodka in it!

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:04.380
No, I mean, there's no strawberry daiquiri in it.

01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:07.380
They put like, it's a nasty type of vodka in it.

01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:12.380
I know it's kind of, it's not the Smirnoff version, it's like some other vodka.

01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:15.060
Actively split that I'm in front of my parents and stuff

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:17.740
While eating a delicate dinner during the cruise

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.420
FU to my skin because when one side is hella dark and the other is hella light

01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:25.500
No matter how many times I go to the pool it still remains the same thing

01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:30.820
Oh really

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:34.100
Okay, I'm gonna heat it up a little bit

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:37.580
Yeah

01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:41.820
Time be wasted for my other FUs. I'll continue the FUs next week

01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:42.820
Alright, puppy.

01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:43.820
I said two weeks.

01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:44.820
Two weeks, sorry.

01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:45.820
Yeah, don't forget next week.

01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:46.820
We won't be here.

01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:47.820
Puppy.

01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:48.820
Okay.

01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:53.020
Okay, since time is short, I'll make this quick.

01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:58.380
Fuck school, fuck my car, fuck funerals, fuck the funeral across the street, fuck the number

01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:06.740
zero when it's alone, and fuck mold, and fuck my refrigerator.

01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:07.740
That's all.

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:14.460
Alright, let's get to our chat room FUs then. Here we go. Started off with Dark Knight.

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:18.880
Dark Knight says, let me start with a big FU and that's for my car to go kerplunk on

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:22.500
me. Ended up having to catch a ride to work for the weekend. Another for being a broke

01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:25.300
ass mofo and finally work, that is all.

01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:33.500
DDR Angel says, FU to Skype for freezing while trying to run on my system. FU to QRO for

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:36.980
giving me sprite errors and other continuous errors spontaneously while I'm trying to play.

01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:43.500
I want to play F you to feeling like I'm fully packed but then thinking I'm still going to forget something man

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:48.800
I guess I'm done and I can sympathize with thinking you're packed when you're not because I'm having that same problem right now

01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:55.060
Good power says F you to this horrible retainer. I can't say anything coherently when I have it on

01:53:55.420 --> 01:54:01.620
You know what too bad you had braces you have the retainer now deal with it. We all had to yep

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:04.620
Let's do it. I stopped wearing my retainer after three months.

01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:07.620
And look at me now!

01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:11.620
I got all three of my teeth!

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:14.620
Flairone says, F you to the official PS2 headset.

01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:18.620
I got karaoke revolution this weekend and the headphones are crappy.

01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:23.620
The Xbox headset is actually decently sturdy.

01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:26.620
I actually thought the KR1 was a little better, but...

01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.620
Potato potato.

01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:38.620
VX JasonXV says, my one and only FU. FU to people who show up almost an hour after the tournament was scheduled to start, and starting about one and a quarter hours late.

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:47.620
Oh, and Rai-chan is passing one along too. FU to other girls who repeatedly try to hang all over your boyfriend, even more so when it's right in front of you.

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:55.620
Then that's when, you know, you just shake your hand, and ask them what the five fingers said to the face.

01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:56.620
That's hot.

01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:59.320
Uh, Evil Naoki 2DX says,

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.620
F you to Noria for singing Sylvia Drive.

01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:04.420
That song's been in my head for the past four days.

01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:08.020
Oh, and one F you to commercials before movies.

01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:09.020
I agree.

01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:10.720
F you to the 20.

01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:13.220
Fuck that shit.

01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:16.220
Fuck the 20.

01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:18.020
I got 20 for you right here.

01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:19.720
Uh, John Field says,

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:23.020
I guess my only F you is that connection was too short.

01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:31.020
Oh, and F.U. to claiming that Mega Man Anniversary Collection has remixed music when all it's using are the music tracks from Power Fighter slash Battles.

01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:34.020
Oh, interesting. It does have remixed music.

01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:36.020
I thought it was the overclocked one.

01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:40.020
There wasn't much remixed. Like, if you change it to the F.U. mode, it's all remixed music.

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:43.020
Interesting.

01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:46.220
Alright, that's all the FUs right now.

01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:50.180
Some folks wanted to comment on some convention things you were talking about, Aaron, so I'm

01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:53.220
going to open the Skype line back up since we only have a few minutes left in the show

01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:54.300
anyway.

01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:57.620
Maybe some folks have comments on who knows what else.

01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:01.500
So we're just going to kind of finish up the show with a little bit of that.

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:04.300
Yeah, I think there was some Anime Expo commentaries.

01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:06.380
Somebody wanted to add.

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:12.260
I've never, I've only ever been to like one anime convention in my entire life, you know.

01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:14.260
There was an Anime Expo, it was a little one.

01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:16.260
Alright, here it is. It's Richie. Richie wants to...

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:20.260
Richie's back on the Skype line. He wants to talk to us about an Anime Expo story.

01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:24.260
I think that Aaron brought up. So, what's up, Richie?

01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:28.260
Hey, uh, nothing much. Just a couple of, uh...

01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:31.260
World Stories from AnimeCon this year.

01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:33.260
Um...

01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:35.260
Well, yeah, just...

01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:38.260
Okay, what'd you want to tell us about?

01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:40.260
Um...

01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:45.460
Hey buddy, you're skipping up a little bit there, um, uh, stop your torrents and stop

01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:46.860
your Winamp for a second.

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:47.860
See if that helps.

01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:49.180
I don't know what the hell is wrong with my connection.

01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.180
Alright.

01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:51.180
We can hear you now.

01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:52.180
What's up?

01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:53.180
Okay.

01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.220
Um, well I just want to say that, yeah, a lot of the guys there didn't know what the

01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:58.620
hell the concept of a shower meant, so it stinks like high heaven over there.

01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:02.540
At least my roommates still were like, they would shower every day and stuff, don't worry

01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:03.540
about it.

01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:07.860
And other than that, well, other than, you know, like, stinky idiots, you get the drunken

01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:13.540
idiots too who ruin everything. I don't know if you've heard about this, but on Saturday

01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:16.500
night, Sunday morning, we had to close down the convention center.

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:20.820
I was there. That was the toilet. I didn't remember what happened, right?

01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:27.620
Yeah. What happened that night, for people who don't know, in the arcade in the Fanime

01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:32.740
2004 convention, somebody decided to blow up the toilet and it ended up flooding that

01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:36.280
whole second floor of the convention center, so they had to close the arcade down, which

01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:41.280
Which is almost the only thing to do in the middle of the night, save for the video rooms.

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:44.280
Yeah, and if I can add to that.

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:49.280
I was staffing the arcade during that shift, so they had me pull Khan Security.

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.280
You remember how tired I looked, Aaron?

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:58.280
Yeah, they took all the arcade workers, and what they did was they made them work security

01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:01.280
to make sure nobody went into the upper areas.

01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:03.280
And you saw how tired I was.

01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.780
When I was up, I was listening to Nami Tamaki for like, how many hours straight.

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:13.780
Yeah, actually at Fatime 2, they played the same Nami Tamaki CD for all four days.

01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:20.280
All four days, it was hell. I mean, I was starting to sing along to it, and it was just crazy.

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:26.780
Other than that though, oh, and if I could put in a plug for another con that's coming up,

01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:31.780
We have the Chinatown Anime Fair in San Francisco. It's coming up September 11th and 12th.

01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:37.780
It's $10 to be registered. Go over to JTAF.com to pre-reg.

01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:44.780
It's going to be pretty cool. Check out the site. We've got a few guests of honor you might want to check out.

01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:46.780
Hope to see you all there.

01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:49.780
Alright, sounds good. We've got to get going Richie, but thanks for the call.

01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.780
Yeah, no problem. I'll see you guys later.

01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:52.780
Take care, bud.

01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:57.260
Alright, so that's about it, we've got to start wrapping up the show here, let's go

01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:00.740
around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Jonas.

01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:04.460
Uh, can you cover up to the later on?

01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:05.460
Okay, Erin.

01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:11.300
Oh, well, the thing, oh I just wanted to add one thing that really, really sucked about

01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:17.140
Anime Expo, was that, I guess since the cons have been held there for so long, that they

01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:21.660
knew about, they well knew about the BO, so what they did was they turned the AC on really,

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:26.380
really high. So if you walk through the convention center tonight, it was like, at least like

01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:28.380
sixty-five degrees in there, if not lower.

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:32.880
No sweat, no BS. Final thought from Puppy.

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:38.980
Uh, yeah, I, Loki's cock really is big, isn't it?

01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:45.420
Jonas, do or die, final thought. Uh, it tastes very good, too.

01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:48.980
Loki, final thought. I'm taking that cock back to work, and I'm

01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:53.980
I'm leaving it there.

01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:57.340
My final thought is, listen to the Bimani Music Amore program.

01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:01.360
We need people to whore up our listening hours because our ratings have been dropping and

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.920
that makes me sad.

02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:05.020
Jamie, final thought?

02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:08.580
Tastes great, less filling.

02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:11.220
Last word of the show, Erin really wants it, so why not?

02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:12.560
I don't know what it is.

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:15.060
One word that sums it all up.

02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:17.060
Aaron, what is tonight's...

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:19.060
Well, hold on, I gotta make sure our outro's ready to go.

02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.060
Aaron, what is tonight's...

02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:23.060
Final word?

02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:25.060
Movies!

02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:28.060

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:52.060
I have not had sex in almost two years.

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:57.060
And I think once you hate two years, you automatically get your virginity back.

02:00:57.060 --> 02:01:00.060
You get to start over. And I'm about to.

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:03.060
What is wrong with me? I don't understand.

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:09.060
I'm just going to have to trick somebody into doing it.

02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:12.060
Use trickery.

02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:17.060
I'm going to have to cover with leaves and hope somebody falls in.

02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:32.060
That's going to be the only way.

02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:35.060
I think I would be really hot if I didn't talk. That's my problem.

02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:39.060
I just have a big mouth and I just say the wrong things, but I don't know.

02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:43.060
Like, it's weird. I try. I have one pickup line which never works.

02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:44.060
This is what I do.

02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:47.060
If I'm at a club and I see a guy that I like, I'll smile.

02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:49.060
And if he smiles back, I feel comfortable.

02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:52.060
And when I feel really comfortable, I'll walk over and I'll say,

02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:54.060
Stick it in!

02:01:54.060 --> 02:02:11.100
So, um, as you know by now, I'm Korean.

02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:16.580
I don't have a store or anything.

02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:26.980
Well, not anymore.

02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:27.980
I look very Korean.

02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:29.540
I have very typically Korean features.

02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:35.300
I look like one of those girls that you would see in a Korean grocery store on a calendar

02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:37.300
holding a box of soy milk.

02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:55.780
Drink by the toy, it's good for you I have a Korean name, my Korean name is Moran

02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:59.300
which is a pretty name but you have to understand I've heard my mother scream it from across

02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:16.320
the hills. I'm sure you can relate. When I get famous enough, I want to have my own fragrance

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:23.840
and have it be called Moran and have the ads be old Asian women coming out of French doors

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.440
like in the Eggo East ad.

02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:37.640
Don't you think that's sexy?

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:39.680
It's just, it's so hot.

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:47.120
My mother is convinced that everybody in show business does drugs.

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:51.120
She's like, oh, you cannot go to the club because they take the drone.

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.120
The people, they take the cocaine.

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:02.120
And then they take the D. What is it? The D? The L? The D? The D?

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:05.120
Mom, it's LSD. How do you know that?

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.120
My mother has a problem with blind intersections.

02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:18.120
She will sit there for a very long time and rant.

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:21.120
They never give you a chance!

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:42.120
So since I was about 10 years old, almost all of my friends have been gay men.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:48.120
And my mother would give me phone messages from them when they would call me when I lived at home.

02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:53.120
Um... Scott called...

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:59.120
IS HE THE GAY?!

02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:04.120
Well, God, Mom, I don't know if he's THE gay.

02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:08.120
That's a lot of pressure to be THE gay.

02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:10.120
All of that resting on one guy.

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:16.120
He has to do the parade all by himself.

02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:28.120
I'm here. I'm queer.

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:31.120
I guess I'm the only one.

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:38.880
My parents are very conservative, but surprisingly gay-positive.

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:42.560
In the late 70s, we owned a bookstore in San Francisco on Polk Street, which then was a

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:43.960
huge gay mecca.

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:48.160
And my mother, for some reason, was in charge of the gay pornography section.

02:05:48.160 --> 02:06:00.320
So every day she would walk over there, I don't know why we have this room.

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:16.360
job.

02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:19.920
The most harrowing experience I ever had with my mother was one time I wanted to go see

02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:23.220
this movie with my friends and she would not let me go with my friends, she had to come

02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:31.760
with me. So I had to go see The Wall with my mom. Halfway through the movie somebody

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:41.020
actually passed her a joint. What is this? I don't know why they give this to me. That's

02:06:41.020 --> 02:07:02.860
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:16.060
I'm going to go buy popcorn. That's like that's like one of her first ones. That was long

02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:21.220
But seriously that was like one of her best bits right there. Seriously. It's it's the greatest

02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:28.220
That's what I would play for anybody who wants to know what Margaret shows all about cuz that just sums it all up right in

02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:32.100
There okay, we are in the afterbirth and we'll open up the skype line for any calls

02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:34.960
I think there were a couple people that missed the chance to call during the show

02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:38.140
So we'll give a chance right now if they want to call in guess what you can't talk to me. Bye

02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:39.140
Bye.

02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:40.140
Oh, are you leaving?

02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:41.140
I'm leaving.

02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:42.140
Alright.

02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:43.140
Bye, Jamie.

02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:44.140
Bye.

02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:45.140
Thanks for coming, of course, as always.

02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:46.140
Bye.

02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:47.140
So, studio, studio dark.

02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:48.140
I feel all warm.

02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:50.380
We're going to be in studio dark Sakura next week, right?

02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:56.540
Shut up, Rob, if we can fit people in there because there's a bunch of boxes.

02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:58.340
Jamie's got a lot of boxes.

02:07:58.340 --> 02:07:59.340
Okay.

02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:04.500
We've been, we had to take all of the boxes out of Dan's mom's garage when she moved.

02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:05.500
Uh-huh.

02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:07.340
So we have them all piled up in the upstairs room.

02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:11.340
The downstairs is taken up by pole position cabinets for the main machine.

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:17.340
So, we'll have to be creative. People are going to have to sit on boxes and sit on the floor, but we'll be able to do it.

02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:19.340
Well, I'm going to miss everybody next week.

02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:21.340
I'll miss you too, but my aim is improving.

02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:28.340
Shut up. I wish I had Skype in Pennsylvania. Well, not that you've got the Skype thing set up, but we'll get it set up sometime.

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:31.340
Not on the show, but I can't get it to work with the broadcaster I use.

02:08:31.340 --> 02:08:34.340
Yeah, that's the only reason we can do it now is because I'm using a different broadcaster.

02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:37.340
I might have to show me how to do that. I might have to work that out someday.

02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:42.340
But I like the other broadcaster because I can talk over music where my sound card doesn't normally let me do that.

02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:43.340
Right on.

02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:45.340
Stupid piece of crap, Vio.

02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:47.340
Anyway, I'm going. Bye.

02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:49.340
Bye-bye. Have a good one.

02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:53.340
So, well, nobody's calling in on the Skyplane. I thought somebody was going to, but I guess not.

02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:55.340
Well, too bad.

02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:57.340
Yeah, too bad. Too bad's so sad.

02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:59.340
It's all right. Yeah, Logie.

02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:03.340
I'm just glad I got to talk to Mel. That was nice.

02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:05.340
He's a good man. He's a good guy to chat with.

02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:07.340
Oh! Finally, we're getting a call!

02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:10.340
Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge.

02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:12.340
Hey Sky, this is John Fields.

02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:13.340
Hey, what's up?

02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:19.340
Not much. Um, I'd just like to say a couple of words. I went to my first...

02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:22.340
Alright, that's it. That was a couple of words. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. What's up?

02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:29.340
I went to my first anime convention this weekend, actually. It was held right on my campus, actually.

02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:33.340
Really? And what was that all about?

02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:37.340
It was Kineticon, and it was a really fun experience

02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:41.340
but I think I kind of blew it on the anime because I really didn't actually go to see any

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:45.340
screenings. I was stuck playing video games the whole time.

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:49.340
What kind of video games are going on there?

02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:53.340
I actually got to play Papa Music for the first time there.

02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:57.340
How'd you like it? It was a very fun game.

02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:01.940
me when I pick up the controller and play it at home or something like that.

02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:03.820
It's a fun game to have. You should pick it up.

02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:06.300
Alright. Alright, thanks for calling. Take care.

02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:10.220
Okay. Talk during the show sometime. Sure, no problem.

02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:15.740
Alright, later. I had to, we missed a call in there, cause I forget, cause I, well sometimes

02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:20.040
like even if we're, there's no call waiting or anything and I can't conference thing or

02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:24.420
anything so I have to remember to put it back in do not disturb or else like everybody will

02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:27.780
we'll call it once, which is of course what always happens, you sit there and you wait

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:34.180
forever. Remember guys, if you want to call, just get on the skype line and give us a call,

02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:39.340
and then like everybody will call it once. It's crazy. Oh well, what can you do? I'll

02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:44.500

Do you want to ask Puppy how he thinks of, uh...

02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:01.020
You're gonna ask me that again?

02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:03.020
Hey, you requested it.

02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:05.020
No, I didn't. You just...

02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:07.020
Yes, you did. She specifically said that.

02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:09.020
When did she say that?

02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:12.020
Check her last, uh... LJ post.

02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:14.020
Ooh, LJ drama.

02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:16.020
Ha ha ha.

02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:19.020
He's one of... one of our friends, so...

02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:27.740
Hey, there's a good segue for me to plug the LiveJournal community, Orange Lounge, all

02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:29.020
one word right there.

02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:34.620
And no drama on our community, unfortunately, but if you look at like the Friends page with

02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:38.100
all our members, you can get plenty of drama from all their journals.

02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:39.100
It's fabulous.

02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:42.540
It's really good for killing time to read up on LiveJournal drama.

02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:43.540
Yeah.

02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:47.380
Alright, well thanks for giving the show a call.

02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:48.380
Later Doric.

02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:49.380
Let's show some time.

02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:50.380
Alright.

02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:51.380
Later.

02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:52.380
Later.

02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:53.380
See, Skype is fun.

02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:54.380
Click.

02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:57.380
Yeah, I like the little clicky noise it makes when we hang up on people.

02:12:57.380 --> 02:13:02.740
Alright, I guess that's it.

02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:03.740
We're out of here.

02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:05.460
I'm kind of done with tonight's show.

02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:06.940
I'll leave this open a few more minutes.

02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:10.620
I know Angel was really trying to get through and I don't know what happened, but yeah.

02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:20.420
I'll be uploading my two new remixes, the XC-1 and the Room of Angels one, probably

02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:24.700
tonight actually, for other reasons.

02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:27.100
You want to be able to let our listeners download it, right?

02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:29.260
That's the number one reason.

02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:31.500
They can listen to it before everyone else.

02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:32.500
Exactly.

02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:35.540
Alright, I'm going to set up a post-show here right now.

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:38.980
You know, this was really popular last week, we played some stuff from the Ministry of

02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:42.720
sound compilation, the annual. So I'm going to do that again, except we only got through

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:45.720
disc one last week, so I'm just going to go ahead and start it off with disc two tonight.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:52.200
Excuse me. Who are you turning into? I know, I'm turning into Aaron here. Ooh, double your

02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:58.040
pleasure. Anyway guys, thank you so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio,

02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:03.740

02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:07.740

The sun's shining, the sun's shining The sun's shining

02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:55.740
