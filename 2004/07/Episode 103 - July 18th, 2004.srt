1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:02,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss forensic files really badly.

2
00:00:02,204 --> 00:00:03,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I go through withdrawal.

3
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:11,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And I miss, and like everyone's now telling me that at least five, six people have told me that Stargate show's pretty good.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So I downloaded the first episode of the Atlantis one.

5
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:16,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got that downloading.

6
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:21,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love Iron Chef, so I've been trying to download as much Iron Chef as possible.

7
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:25,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the liver battle and the caviar battle and the broccoli battle.

8
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:26,622
[SPEAKER_07]: They made broccoli ice cream.

9
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,163
[SPEAKER_07]: You both have like...

10
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:31,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, I need more Iron Chef.

11
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I even have one of the U.S.

12
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:36,835
[SPEAKER_07]: ones, The Egg Battle, which I actually need to watch just to see how bad it is.

13
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:45,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm actually, the other thing I'm downloading right now is like a PaintShop Pro 8 beta, I think.

14
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,952
[SPEAKER_23]: Speaking of TV, I've been watching a TV show I've been keeping up on.

15
00:00:56,816 --> 00:01:04,402
[SPEAKER_23]: TV Nihon has been so gracious to be fansubbing these for us, but the Sailor Moon live action show has got to be one of the greatest things ever.

16
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:06,763
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, it's freaking hilarious.

17
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:08,745
[SPEAKER_23]: Even with the plushies!

18
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:11,547
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, yeah, it's in the, like, it's everything.

19
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:16,108
[SPEAKER_23]: My girlfriend, who doesn't even like, you know, Rice Princess, she doesn't even, she hates Sailor Moon with a passion.

20
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:19,349
[SPEAKER_23]: But she loves this show because it's just so cheesy.

21
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:27,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, they never, when they're fighting, instead of them fighting, they just do cartwheels around each other, and that supposedly, we will defeat you with our cartwheels.

22
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:33,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's almost how it is on the show itself, you know, they do the, I find it so funny that Usagi is supposed to be so...

23
00:01:33,954 --> 00:02:03,213
[SPEAKER_23]: Clumsy yet she can do all these elaborate poses All these crazy cartwheels and backflips and stuff It's just crazy It's so funny too And for people who do like Sailor Moon If there's anybody who likes Sailor Moon I've watched all of it They rewrote the script so it's still kind of fresh and new I mean they have some elements from the cartoon, the original But it kind of adds a little more And a little more adult Not really adult but I guess more mature humor I mean there's no sex or anything Darn

24
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,949
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we need the Haruka Michiru action.

25
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune.

26
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:14,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

27
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:17,933
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to a break because we haven't been to a break for a little while now.

28
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:19,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:23,797
[SPEAKER_04]: We should ask Lanky Saldo, since he's here, how was your week and how was your day since we were just finishing that segment up?

30
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:26,198
[SPEAKER_23]: Jeez.

31
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:32,101
[SPEAKER_23]: Same as always, except I just got some new crack from Irene.

32
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:46,431
[SPEAKER_23]: I downloaded the Harry Potter game, The Prisoner of Azkaban, and she's, you know, it's so childish, but, you know, for a fan, like, as big of a fan she is of Harry Potter, you know, she has to play it, so, it's funny.

33
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:51,795
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's, like, really skipping and stuff during the dialogue, so it's so funny, it'll be talking, and it'll be like, what's up, Harry?

34
00:02:53,737 --> 00:02:56,019
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's, like, it's great, it's funny.

35
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,883
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just bought a new graphic card on the way here, I bought a new Radeon that's gonna, like,

36
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:03,419
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:32,649
[SPEAKER_23]: With all the problems you just went through with your graphic card, I think you should probably stick with the one you just, you know, you just finally fixed it so you can play your stupid Final Fantasy XI game.

38
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:33,990
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, yeah.

39
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,391
[SPEAKER_23]: How do you like them apples?

40
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:38,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to go to a break right now.

41
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:40,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I need to have a word with Brad.

42
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:43,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, yeah, we're going to go to a break.

43
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:47,782
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back, we'll talk about some Bomani news, if we can dig any up.

44
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:50,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, the cage match.

45
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:55,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the FUs of the week, Ask Orange Lounge, and the Skype line.

46
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:59,778
[SPEAKER_04]: All this when we come back from this break featuring more Dance Maniacs music, because that's what I feel like hearing.

47
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,418
Thank you for watching!

48
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:55,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching.

49
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:56,679
[SPEAKER_15]: See you next time.

50
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:24,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

51
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,502
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:26,367
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I, I, I, I

53
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:12,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

54
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:37,640
[SPEAKER_04]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

55
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,982
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

56
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:40,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

57
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

58
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:44,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

59
00:08:47,186 --> 00:08:48,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, boys and girls.

60
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

61
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:51,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are.

62
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode number 103.

63
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't supposed to be here tonight, but I was granted a reprieve.

64
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not supposed to be here today.

65
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:05,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to leave tomorrow instead, so I'm hoping to check out some interesting things while I'm on the East Coast.

66
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:06,959
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to see.

67
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:15,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki had to do some surgery on the microphone here to get it to work right, but it's great now.

68
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Jonas is fondling Loki's cock.

69
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, did you just put Loki's cock in your mouth?

70
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:24,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonas, what the hell is that?

71
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,024
[SPEAKER_23]: Watch out or his cock will bite you.

72
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:33,445
[SPEAKER_23]: His cock's a real pecker.

73
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I was having fun with that too.

74
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not have fun with the cock.

75
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:48,796
[SPEAKER_24]: The only one you should have fun with is your own.

76
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:54,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So you said, Loki, you said you saw something local on DDR this week in the news.

77
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:56,449
[SPEAKER_04]: What did your mom say about it?

78
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:57,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see it either.

79
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:58,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about it though.

80
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,090
[SPEAKER_03]: She basically said DDR was on the news.

81
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,231
[SPEAKER_03]: They said something about people losing weight playing the game.

82
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:09,814
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a generic interview piece that every news channel has done.

83
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Was Tanya in it?

84
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:14,577
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a shocker.

85
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:15,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

86
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:21,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything, it's just basically the same story that's been going around ever since that Associated Press thing picked it up, huh?

87
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:22,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

88
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:23,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

89
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:24,804
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

90
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:25,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

91
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:27,166
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, this is bullshit.

92
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:37,414
[SPEAKER_23]: The media and parents and stuff, they don't fucking care about our video games until somebody goes and kills somebody and then blames it on Grand Theft Auto or something, you know.

93
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:40,056
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, we don't make fun of them for being crack whores.

94
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:41,897
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, what does that have to do with anything?

95
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:42,677
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

96
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:44,137
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, yeah, sorry, I just wanted to

97
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:08,930
[SPEAKER_23]: I digress.

98
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:10,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's alright.

99
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:16,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just the old TV saying of if it bleeds, it leads, you know?

100
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:30,918
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not like a really horrible, depressing story, or causing violence in the streets or whatever, then, you know, it's one of those pieces that's saved for the end of the newscast to make you feel good.

101
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:34,979
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an uplifting story at the end, you know?

102
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:38,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Fat man fat no more thanks to video game.

103
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:39,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought?

104
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:42,426
[SPEAKER_24]: Nobody watches the news that long anyways.

105
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:51,509
[SPEAKER_24]: They've watched the first ten minutes for all the bloody headlines, and then after that they wait until sports and they're done.

106
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,489
[SPEAKER_23]: I just figured it out.

107
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:01,211
[SPEAKER_23]: So they get lean, they lose weight, and they get in shape from playing this game, but then what's the deal?

108
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:02,992
[SPEAKER_23]: Konami's not releasing any more DDRs.

109
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:04,692
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you were going to get bored of DDR...

110
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:05,534
[SPEAKER_23]: Hold on, hold on.

111
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:16,602
[SPEAKER_23]: People are going to get bored of DDR, and they're going to stop playing, and they're going to get fat again, and then they're going to sue Konami, because they didn't come out with any new DDRs, just like they sue, like, McDonald's for not, you know, for making people fat.

112
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Careful.

113
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Technicality, though.

114
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:25,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you mean no new DDR arcade, but every news story has focused on the DDR home version.

115
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:34,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost all of them are talking about the home versions, and they are coming out with two of them this summer, or not this summer, but this fall, so, you know, you can't say that too much.

116
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:35,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't, because I don't like it.

117
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:39,826
[SPEAKER_23]: The arcade DDR was the pinnacle moment for DDR.

118
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:40,767
[SPEAKER_23]: Stapler.

119
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:41,548
[SPEAKER_23]: Wait.

120
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I want my stapler back.

121
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:47,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Loki, yes, you have something to say.

122
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:49,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

123
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:57,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw another video this week of In The Groove, and I have to say, it doesn't look that bad.

124
00:12:57,992 --> 00:12:58,352
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

125
00:12:58,692 --> 00:12:59,652
[SPEAKER_03]: This coming from you?

126
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,352
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look... Well, here's the problem.

127
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:03,173
[SPEAKER_03]: No, here's the thing, though.

128
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:03,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, though.

129
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:10,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It's before I saw early shots of In The Groove, and they've developed a lot further since when I saw it.

130
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:12,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually looks pretty decent.

131
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:15,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't mind it actually coming into an arcade, except, you know...

132
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:18,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, look at what the options are out there right now.

133
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,345
[SPEAKER_03]: You have two fucking bootlegs floating around.

134
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:26,910
[SPEAKER_03]: One's a miscolored DDR Extreme, and the other one's like a DDR Extreme with like this overclocking on it, which is stupid.

135
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:32,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'd rather play in the groove than that shit.

136
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:33,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, hey, bring it in.

137
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:38,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't spend $650 on these bootlegs and bring in the groove.

138
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it actually doesn't look that bad.

139
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:41,662
[SPEAKER_03]: The interface is pretty nice.

140
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:44,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I like what they've done with it so far.

141
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:09,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just looked very interesting, that's all.

142
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I would still rather have a new Konami DDR.

143
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:18,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, yeah, but at the moment, since there is no Konami DDR on the horizon, I'll take this.

144
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, it's like, can you go give me, hey, can you go to the fridge and give me a soda?

145
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:24,825
[SPEAKER_04]: All we got's diet.

146
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:27,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, alright, I'll drink it anyway.

147
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:33,891
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it's more like, your choices are George W. Bush or John McCain, which you'd rather have.

148
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:39,376
[SPEAKER_23]: John Kerry, I'm sorry, that was last fucking election or whatever, wasn't it?

149
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:42,118
[SPEAKER_23]: You just totally lost it.

150
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:45,719
[SPEAKER_23]: Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, either one sucks to me.

151
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Jamie wants to say, where's the other mic over there?

152
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:51,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Jamie.

153
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:57,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a funny bumper sticker day since you mentioned that.

154
00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:01,005
[SPEAKER_07]: It said Clinton, he did it between two Bushes.

155
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,804
[SPEAKER_04]: On that note, I think we're going to go ahead and get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

156
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:11,886
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the cage match?

157
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:18,793
[SPEAKER_04]: The way the cage match works, for those of you guys who haven't listened before, you've got to be in our chat room to participate.

158
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,795
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLawnRadio.com, you pick a winner.

159
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:23,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Three songs, each host brings one to the table.

160
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:27,741
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to hear a clip of last week's winner, because you already heard it last week.

161
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:30,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get to hear two new songs in the entirety.

162
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:31,435
[SPEAKER_04]: You vote for your favorite.

163
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:37,216
[SPEAKER_04]: That favorite goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live.

164
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,876
[SPEAKER_04]: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with the Monty Music and More program.

165
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:41,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let's get right into it.

166
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:46,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week's winner was brought to the table by Loki, and it's BT.

167
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:52,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And the song is called Kimo Sabe, and we figured out it is in one of those other harmonics games.

168
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:53,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in Amplitude.

169
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:55,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so here it is.

170
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one, a clip of this.

171
00:15:57,935 --> 00:16:00,600
[SPEAKER_04]: BT, Kimo Sabe, enjoy.

172
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,885
I rock creativity, I bust positive vibes from the west to Maui

173
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:06,548
Pull it back.

174
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

175
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:08,246
[SPEAKER_04]: A clip of last week's winner, BT with Kimo Sabe.

176
00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:10,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into song number two tonight.

177
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two is my pick.

178
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:39,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And I decided, you know what, I'd like to win a cage match before I leave town So I picked an artist that I usually tend to win this with And you know what, I do really like this song a lot It's my favorite by her that I think I've heard to date So let's hear it for Kylie's sister, Dani This is Dani Minogue with her latest single, I Begin To Wonder Enjoy, song number two in tonight's cage match Shut up Here we go, here it is

179
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:54,178
Thank you for watching!

180
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:36,434
[SPEAKER_15]: And every time I think I'm breaking free, these thoughts return to trouble me, hanging on

181
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:23,014
You're a sinner but you told me you're a saint Too fast I tripped and lost my way Can't believe what's happened to me, baby Cause everyday is the same day Different faces, no names Places I've never been before And everyday is the same thing Different faces, no names Places I've never been before

182
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:45,050
[SPEAKER_15]: All this time you led me astray Making love to you, I do

183
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:24,721
I'm really over you No time to think, I love death

184
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

185
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,664
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

186
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:21,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny Minow with I Begin to Wonder, and I'm wondering what you guys thought of that song.

187
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with, who's got the mic?

188
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:24,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy, what did you think of that?

189
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:30,206
[SPEAKER_24]: It really does sound like one of her sister's songs.

190
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:35,687
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, besides the fact that it was really boring, it was really boring.

191
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:38,328
[SPEAKER_24]: So yeah, a five.

192
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:39,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Five.

193
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:40,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie?

194
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:42,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard that song before.

195
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:46,709
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty repetitive.

196
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:47,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad.

197
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:48,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a 7.

198
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,110
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a 7.

199
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

200
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron.

201
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:54,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron gives it half a lung.

202
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:57,492
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, fine.

203
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:58,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Lanky style then.

204
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,113
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, of course I've heard that.

205
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:04,174
[SPEAKER_23]: Every time I'm driving in the car with you.

206
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:05,034
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not a bad song.

207
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:07,715
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's pretty poppy, like most of Danny Minow's stuff, but

208
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:10,759
[SPEAKER_23]: Personally, I have to say I put the needle on it a lot better.

209
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:11,719
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot better.

210
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,080
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'll give that a 7.

211
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:21,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, um... Jonas, your thoughts on that one?

212
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:25,229
[SPEAKER_13]: I begin to wonder why I'm gonna give this a 7 out of 10.

213
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.

214
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I just noticed your hat says you're fired.

215
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an apprentice hat or something?

216
00:24:34,535 --> 00:24:35,376
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.

217
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:35,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright.

218
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:37,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's Aaron's turn.

219
00:24:37,882 --> 00:24:41,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, it was not that great, I'm sorry to say.

220
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:46,291
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of boring to the point where I took my testicle, put on my headphones, and started listening to music, so.

221
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, okay.

222
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:49,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So, on a scale of 1 to 10?

223
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:51,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably like 4.

224
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:52,257
[SPEAKER_04]: 4, alright.

225
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:53,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Loki?

226
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:55,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

227
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an easygoing, like, club song.

228
00:24:57,982 --> 00:24:58,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it like a 7.

229
00:24:58,743 --> 00:25:00,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

230
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:06,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I give it a 9, because it made me very gay, as in happy.

231
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:08,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I like that song.

232
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:15,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, song number 3 tonight is Jamie's Pick, and Jamie, you want to introduce your song?

233
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:16,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is she?

234
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,471
[SPEAKER_04]: There she is, here she comes.

235
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:25,420
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on the administrative sound compilation, and it was by the... By the, what is it?

236
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,541
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lost Brothers.

237
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:27,382
[SPEAKER_07]: The Lost Brothers.

238
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:32,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the song because the song was in The Lost Boys, which is like one of my all-time ever favorite movies.

239
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:35,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, it's actually like real samples.

240
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,830
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like somebody covering it, so it's very well done.

241
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:44,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will never, ever, hardly ever say that any, you know, song that I like that much is well done.

242
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:46,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

243
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:49,235
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then judge for yourself.

244
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:49,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

245
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:51,599
[SPEAKER_04]: If you love the 80s, you'll love this.

246
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,323
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lost Brothers, Cry Little Sister.

247
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:55,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's pick.

248
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:55,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

249
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,279
Thanks for watching!

250
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,810
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

251
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, quiet in the studio.

252
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:57,591
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

253
00:29:57,891 --> 00:29:59,811
[SPEAKER_04]: That was song number three in tonight's cage match.

254
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:02,392
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Lost Brothers with Cry Little Sister.

255
00:30:02,672 --> 00:30:03,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the ending there.

256
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:09,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts to fade into another track because I'm one of those nonstop dance compilations, so you have to disregard the last 20 seconds of that track.

257
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:12,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, that was Cry Little Sister.

258
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what everybody here thought of that.

259
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:14,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie.

260
00:30:15,228 --> 00:30:22,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course it's nowhere near as good as the original song because I can listen to the original on repeat, endless for days and years and months and everything.

261
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I give that one a 9.

262
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:25,671
[SPEAKER_07]: It's well done.

263
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:30,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have liked for them to do a longer one that actually had the lyrics in it, you know, but that one was still pretty good.

264
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:42,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It's enough to get that little bit of nostalgia pulled up in me and think of, who was it, Jason Patrick with those shades and that hair and Kiefer.

265
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:43,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Young.

266
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:45,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

267
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh, Loki.

268
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:50,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking cut myself on a wire.

269
00:30:51,162 --> 00:30:53,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, that was okay.

270
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:56,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'd give it a seven as well.

271
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:58,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just okay.

272
00:30:59,407 --> 00:30:59,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

273
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:01,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, LankyStyle.

274
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:03,951
[SPEAKER_23]: It was pretty good.

275
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:07,793
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a standard club song, you know, so I'd give it a seven.

276
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:10,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, who else?

277
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:10,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy.

278
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:11,796
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get over to Puppy.

279
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:11,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

280
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:17,528
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I wasn't really paying attention to the song, so I was drinking some pineapple soda.

281
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:22,390
[SPEAKER_04]: You make Kiefer Sutherland cry.

282
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,092
[SPEAKER_24]: Kiefer Sutherland was awesome in 24, and I loved that show, yeah.

283
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:27,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was also in Lost Boys.

284
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:28,953
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

285
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:29,714
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh.

286
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:34,396
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't, uh, they've had the, the box office season 2's been out for a while.

287
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:37,698
[SPEAKER_24]: But, oh yeah, oh yeah, the song, um.

288
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:42,464
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't really catch much of my attention anyways.

289
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:44,704
[SPEAKER_24]: It seemed kind of mellow.

290
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:50,785
[SPEAKER_24]: Just because I don't feel like favoring one song over the other, I'll give this one a 5.2.

291
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:54,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Erin, VHG.

292
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, it wasn't anything special.

293
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:01,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It was alright.

294
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:06,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be something I would listen to if I were driving, per se, but beyond that, I wouldn't really listen to it otherwise, so I'd give it a 6.

295
00:32:08,871 --> 00:32:09,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonas.

296
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,263
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it a 7.

297
00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:13,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Same reasons.

298
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:22,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of have to agree with Jamie that it's just not as good as the original, but I honestly wouldn't even put it in the same ballpark.

299
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:25,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the original is so great, that one doesn't have the lyrics.

300
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:27,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

301
00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:34,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the point about it's kind of, it makes you think, when I hear that song, I think about how I want to hear the original.

302
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:36,904
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically how it goes for me.

303
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:40,345
[SPEAKER_04]: So I give the original a 10 and I give that a 6.

304
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:41,325
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

305
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, guys.

306
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a clip of those three songs you can vote for one more time.

307
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:50,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one tonight, BT, Kimo Sabe.

308
00:32:56,905 --> 00:33:00,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two tonight, Danny Minow, I Begin to Wonder.

309
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three tonight, Lost Brothers, Cry Little Sister.

310
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:25,201
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, now you can start placing your vote.

311
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:28,043
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're undecided, we'll try this out tonight.

312
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:34,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to allow a listener to come through on the Skype line and try to get people to vote for the one they think ought to win.

313
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:43,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anybody will bite on this, but as long as we have this new feature, we'll try it out and see if anyone wants to persuade people that they need to vote for a particular song.

314
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can place vote now.

315
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:48,749
[SPEAKER_04]: NightRiders NightRiders NightRiders

316
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:18,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, your mic's not on over there.

317
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:19,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mic's not on.

318
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,329
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?

319
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:20,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, much better.

320
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:25,070
[SPEAKER_07]: People in Renfair garb on a motorcycle.

321
00:34:30,432 --> 00:34:35,133
[SPEAKER_07]: This has got to be the biggest piece of crap I've ever looked at.

322
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:53,982
[SPEAKER_03]: This movie, okay, this movie has a scene where this guy's just driving down the middle of this free, uh, middle of this highway going, he's all, ahhh, ahhh, they're going down the highway, ahhh, they show like out in the distance or something, ahhh, all of a sudden, vroom, gets hit by like a semi-truck.

323
00:34:57,284 --> 00:35:01,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I want them to do a new Knight Rider series, without David Hasselhoff.

324
00:35:04,512 --> 00:35:05,173
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

325
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:06,934
[SPEAKER_07]: David Hasselhoff is loved in Germany.

326
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:09,155
[SPEAKER_03]: He owns the rights for Knight Rider.

327
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,536
[SPEAKER_03]: He bought them, so.

328
00:35:12,138 --> 00:35:13,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess that makes sense.

329
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's going to call through on the skyline.

330
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,220
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a bunch of pussies.

331
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,560
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

332
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,802
[SPEAKER_07]: People suck for not calling the Skype line.

333
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:22,522
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

334
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:23,924
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll have chances later.

335
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:26,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody liked any of those songs, I guess, but we'll see.

336
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:29,988
[SPEAKER_04]: We are getting some votes, so we'll tally those up during the next break and let you know who won.

337
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:33,511
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, let's go back and talk about some new DDR news.

338
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:34,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this just came up today, guys.

339
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:37,874
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting, I think.

340
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:46,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Alloy Magazine is having a DDR sweepstakes.

341
00:35:48,709 --> 00:36:03,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Alloy Magazine, by the way, is one of those, like, girly magazines, like, Seventeen, and Cosmo, yeah, VHG's like, oh god, in fact, if we, if we go to, prepare to be really sad.

342
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:17,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's cause, um, we, we, like, my sister and I used to have a subscription to one of those girly magazines, and every once in a while they send you, like, free subscriptions to other, or send you a free trial issue of another magazine, and one of them was Alloy.

343
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:18,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like,

344
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:27,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Here are the top stories right now on Alloy.com Which fairy tale fox is dreamier, Chad Michael Murray and Hugh Dancy duke it out?

345
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:45,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Who?

346
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:46,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

347
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,683
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're these dream kids, I guess.

348
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:53,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says, hey, get your movie on this weekend.

349
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:56,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your movie on.

350
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:02,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And right on the front page there, there's gossip about Colin Farrell and where Will Smith changed their naughty ways.

351
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:04,293
[SPEAKER_07]: How about who cares?

352
00:37:04,633 --> 00:37:04,874
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

353
00:37:04,914 --> 00:37:06,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, well, this is why we care.

354
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:12,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Alloy.com is right now having a You Got Served Take It to the Streets contest.

355
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:12,539
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

356
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:16,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys are saying, what the fuck does this have to do with DDR?

357
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:29,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you win the grand prize, you win a PlayStation 2, a Dance Dance Revolution prize package with two dance pads and the game, a Vega 32-inch TV.

358
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's the reason to win right there.

359
00:37:31,136 --> 00:37:33,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it for the Vega for 2DX.

360
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:33,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

361
00:37:34,078 --> 00:37:37,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And the copy of the new Take It to the Streets DVD.

362
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:42,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, and five first place winners get a copy of the Take It to the Streets DVD and DDR Max 2.

363
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:48,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Game, so if you still don't have DDR Max 2, you can try and win it here on Alloy.com.

364
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:51,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look in between the Who's Dreamier polls.

365
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:57,863
[SPEAKER_24]: If it weren't for the fact that they had to include the movie You Got Served anywhere in this contest, it'd be worth entering.

366
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:03,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Take It to the Streets is where they show the choreography, it's like Darren's Dance Cruise.

367
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:05,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I own both of those, sadly enough.

368
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:08,828
[SPEAKER_23]: That's depressing, but hold on, I'm confused.

369
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:11,649
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, it's You Got Served, Take It to the Streets,

370
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:14,405
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not going to buy you, or is it?

371
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:15,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, anyway, sorry.

372
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:17,266
[SPEAKER_23]: She's talking about the Knight Riders movie, whatever.

373
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:22,788
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, so, is it a DDR tournament or a freestyle dance?

374
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:24,289
It's a contest.

375
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:25,969
[SPEAKER_23]: What kind of contest is this?

376
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:26,990
[SPEAKER_23]: Give me some information.

377
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,610
[SPEAKER_23]: Are people really dancing?

378
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how do you enter the You Got Served contest?

379
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,572
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what is it doing?

380
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:34,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is it a sweepstakes?

381
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:37,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is a sweepstakes.

382
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:39,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a tournament or anything.

383
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:40,135
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a sweepstakes.

384
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:41,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, whatever.

385
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:45,230
[SPEAKER_07]: All you do, basically... Oh my god, I'll enter it, because I want the TV.

386
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,150
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you enter now?

387
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,231
[SPEAKER_04]: You just... You give them your information.

388
00:38:48,432 --> 00:38:48,792
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

389
00:38:48,852 --> 00:38:54,815
[SPEAKER_04]: You give them your mailing address and stuff, so they'll probably send you copies of their crappy magazine, and you have a chance to win a Wega.

390
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:56,116
[SPEAKER_04]: What a deal.

391
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:58,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I get to tell them how I feel about the movie you got served?

392
00:38:59,398 --> 00:38:59,958
[SPEAKER_23]: If you want.

393
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:01,379
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I got some things to say.

394
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everyone got served, but we got served... Yeah, a big pile of crap.

395
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to serve you got served?

396
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll serve chicken with a side of vegetables.

397
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:18,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

398
00:39:24,808 --> 00:39:27,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancing movies are really just cheesy all together.

399
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, who remembers Lombada?

400
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Save the Rainforest.

401
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

402
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:35,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Break-In was awesome.

403
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:38,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Break-In 2, Electric Boogaloo.

404
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:45,265
[SPEAKER_23]: How about the sound of music?

405
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,366
[SPEAKER_23]: That was pretty sweet.

406
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:49,608
[SPEAKER_23]: Those dances they did, whoa, that was off the chains.

407
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:55,892
[SPEAKER_03]: For a shizzle.

408
00:39:56,232 --> 00:40:00,716
[SPEAKER_03]: The, uh, do not take us away to concentration camps dance.

409
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:01,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.

410
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:06,039
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, that, that dance was just, like, awesome.

411
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,241
[SPEAKER_23]: I was moved.

412
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:09,702
[SPEAKER_23]: In my pants.

413
00:40:10,162 --> 00:40:10,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god.

414
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:15,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

415
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:18,111
[SPEAKER_03]: You got served, Hitler.

416
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:30,854
[SPEAKER_07]: That, you know what, that was just, you were right, that was moving, as in bowel movement.

417
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:36,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

418
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:39,872
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this whole... Okay, I want to change the topic for a minute.

419
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:45,354
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole, like, You Got Served contest being on Alloy.com kind of got me thinking earlier today.

420
00:40:45,414 --> 00:40:49,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me of a post from LiveJournal, one of my buddies LiveJournal.

421
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:51,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to embarrass them on the air because they might be listening.

422
00:40:51,897 --> 00:41:05,882
[SPEAKER_04]: But somebody was asking me in their LiveJournal today because they're having problems where they're not gay, but they're getting a lot of guys hitting on them because they've got, like, that... They've got that metrosexual thing going on, so, like, people assume the guy's gay.

423
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:06,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like...

424
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,833
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm a DDR player.

425
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:11,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make me gay?

426
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:13,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

427
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:23,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of just had me thinking about this stigma that DDR has with, like, the fact that if you're playing DDR, then you're either metrosexual or you're all the way gay.

428
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:25,426
[SPEAKER_05]: If you play DDR, you gay.

429
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:26,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

430
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Can somebody please explain that to me?

431
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't totally see... I've seen some real...

432
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:36,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, guys I would not consider gay at all.

433
00:41:36,856 --> 00:41:39,798
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they're not really gay or straight, they're just ugly.

434
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen them playing DDR.

435
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:45,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

436
00:41:45,063 --> 00:41:46,564
[SPEAKER_06]: G-Dog plays DDR, doesn't he?

437
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:47,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, moving on.

438
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:52,749
[SPEAKER_07]: There's our new joke for the season.

439
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:59,975
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that one of the reasons why people, you know, like... What's the word I'm looking for?

440
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:00,235
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, they...

441
00:42:01,712 --> 00:42:07,677
[SPEAKER_23]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, though.

442
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:14,502
[SPEAKER_04]: For the longest time, I was the only gay guy playing DDR in this town.

443
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:15,803
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it, you know it.

444
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:26,551
[SPEAKER_23]: At the time, yes, you were the- No, you were the only outwardly gay person playing.

445
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,653
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody else was just a closet homosexual.

446
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:31,887
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's the word we're using today Of people who

447
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:05,521
[SPEAKER_23]: who don't get out of their house and don't get with girls and stuff, you know, because gamer geeks don't have lives, so.

448
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:06,622
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, that is true.

449
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:07,282
[SPEAKER_23]: But anyway.

450
00:43:08,623 --> 00:43:09,163
[SPEAKER_23]: You see what I'm saying?

451
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:09,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

452
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:13,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I still find it very funny just how many guys in the Bay Area were playing Patapata.

453
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, by the way, you guys, I guess we dropped for like half a second.

454
00:43:17,826 --> 00:43:21,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what happened, but... I don't know what the fuck that was about.

455
00:43:22,388 --> 00:43:27,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, seriously, it was amazing how many guys played Patapata Paradise compared to girls.

456
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:28,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when I played, there were like

457
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:32,255
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 girls playing, including me, and the rest were all guys.

458
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:36,899
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, that's just that bad thing about there not being as many girl gamers as there are guy gamers.

459
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:41,302
[SPEAKER_07]: The funny thing was watching how many guys played Deluxe and Oh Sole Mio.

460
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:42,343
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, yeah.

461
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:45,865
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, now that's another reason why people think they're gay, because of that.

462
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:47,687
[SPEAKER_23]: Doing the Deluxe dance.

463
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:52,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And those were like the two songs I kind of just didn't touch after a while.

464
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:54,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just like, fuck it, I'm not playing those songs.

465
00:43:56,232 --> 00:44:06,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some people, and I know a few people listening actually haven't seen any of these on Patapata, Deluxe has a move where you put one hand out to one side, and the other hand out to the other side, and then you shake your butt.

466
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:10,002
[SPEAKER_23]: And your hands are kind of in a faggish motion.

467
00:44:10,903 --> 00:44:13,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Your hands are held vertically.

468
00:44:13,405 --> 00:44:18,268
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, but to be more accurate, you should be pointing it down like this.

469
00:44:18,629 --> 00:44:19,829
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there's Oh Sole Mio.

470
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you do the little teacup-looking dance.

471
00:44:22,422 --> 00:44:27,023
[SPEAKER_23]: The Oso de Mio has... You fan your ass as you walk to the other side.

472
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:28,823
[SPEAKER_23]: I like to call it the cock block.

473
00:44:30,403 --> 00:44:38,845
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, you're swatting something away from your butt because, you know... You have one hand pointed out to the side like you're waving and the other one waving at your ass.

474
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:40,185
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, like, I don't want you, you're ugly.

475
00:44:40,465 --> 00:44:41,185
[SPEAKER_23]: You over there.

476
00:44:41,465 --> 00:44:42,305
[SPEAKER_23]: You're pretty attractive.

477
00:44:42,385 --> 00:44:45,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I grab this one and wave this one away.

478
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:46,446
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

479
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:47,606
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Robert Faces.

480
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:49,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

481
00:44:50,907 --> 00:44:51,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

482
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:58,123
[SPEAKER_04]: But my point is, is that this whole, like, Alloy.com thing, this isn't helping, this image, at all.

483
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:02,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, I'm looking at this page going, this is the gayest thing I've ever seen.

484
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:11,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, seriously, I'm just, I'm waiting for, like, Madonna to start playing, and, uh, you know, Liza Minnelli.

485
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:13,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Even worse, Madonna remixed by Thundercast.

486
00:45:13,968 --> 00:45:18,209
[SPEAKER_04]: If Madonna ends up in the next DDR, you all are going to start sucking cock.

487
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:19,269
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically what's going to happen.

488
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:24,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

489
00:45:24,845 --> 00:45:25,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally kidding.

490
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:27,526
[SPEAKER_04]: We shouldn't be stereotypical.

491
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:28,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not nice.

492
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:29,666
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know everybody else is.

493
00:45:29,966 --> 00:45:31,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody outside of this scene is.

494
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,068
[SPEAKER_07]: When have we ever been nice?

495
00:45:40,228 --> 00:45:43,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a question for all the straight guys in the room, which has everybody but me.

496
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:44,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have a question.

497
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:48,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Have any of you straight guys, any of you straight guys in the room,

498
00:45:49,195 --> 00:45:52,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever not been called gay while playing DDR?

499
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:54,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you talking to me?

500
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Have I ever been not called gay?

501
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:00,803
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, Danny, you're so hetero!

502
00:46:00,984 --> 00:46:01,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you, hetero!

503
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:03,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of my arcade, you hetero!

504
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:04,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me rephrase the question.

505
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:07,528
[SPEAKER_04]: You all have been called gay at least once while playing DDR?

506
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:09,150
[SPEAKER_04]: You've never been called gay?

507
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:12,532
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been called feminists?

508
00:46:13,953 --> 00:46:14,694
[SPEAKER_04]: You were called feminists?

509
00:46:14,914 --> 00:46:15,474
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you do?

510
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:16,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you, like...

511
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:33,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy tickets to the Lilith Fair and start blasting Ani DiFranco and... And started joining Greenpeace and shit, what... Okay, for the whole time I've been playing DDR, I was never called gay.

512
00:46:34,315 --> 00:46:37,538
[SPEAKER_13]: But someone was calling me a feminist or something like that.

513
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:40,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not, but most of the times I've been, there's been no one around when I've played.

514
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,451
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you remember... Not the Bay Area, where it's a little more accepted.

515
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:05,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's also, keep in mind, keep in mind, there's the Roseville Children, as I like to call them.

516
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,774
[SPEAKER_07]: The people that I have kicked out on a regular basis every time I go?

517
00:47:09,114 --> 00:47:09,414
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

518
00:47:09,734 --> 00:47:13,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that crowd that's more... Well, no, I had a group of, like, uh...

519
00:47:14,142 --> 00:47:16,303
[SPEAKER_23]: Mid to early 20 year olds, a bunch of them.

520
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:22,486
[SPEAKER_23]: A bunch of them with one girl trying to impress this girl and they were calling me gay and they were like, he grabbed my hand.

521
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:23,647
[SPEAKER_23]: Who's gay now?

522
00:47:23,747 --> 00:47:24,087
[SPEAKER_23]: Come on.

523
00:47:24,347 --> 00:47:29,850
[SPEAKER_23]: He grabbed my hand and tried to pull me off the machine and I'm like, no, you gay.

524
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:35,332
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, he's like, oh my ass is screaming for some action.

525
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:37,033
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm like, uh, get away.

526
00:47:38,794 --> 00:47:40,415
[SPEAKER_23]: Get away and let me play It's Ready Men.

527
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:43,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh god, that was a...

528
00:47:44,025 --> 00:47:47,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of that, I remember playing Random All with some dude.

529
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:51,129
[SPEAKER_13]: He's gay, and it ended up being It's Raining Men.

530
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:55,311
[SPEAKER_13]: He was like... He was grabbing your ass when he was playing?

531
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he was grabbing my ass.

532
00:47:56,612 --> 00:48:00,434
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't sure if it was intentional, but... Hey man, just be flattered.

533
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:04,036
[SPEAKER_21]: Just nod your head, smile, you know.

534
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:05,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, just kidding.

535
00:48:05,937 --> 00:48:07,358
[SPEAKER_21]: He's like, ah, I don't like this.

536
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:11,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, effeminate would be the word.

537
00:48:13,244 --> 00:48:14,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is practically the same.

538
00:48:14,304 --> 00:48:19,468
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that Jonas was trying to say effeminate, but it was funnier that he said feminists.

539
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:21,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I knew he was trying to say effeminate.

540
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I play DDR for women everywhere!

541
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:25,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, I was like, whoa.

542
00:48:26,314 --> 00:48:29,516
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to get up on this DDR machine and burn my bra!

543
00:48:32,178 --> 00:48:36,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Now if you want to see real gay, just look at the dynamite rave hand plant knee drop routine.

544
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:38,323
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a different type of gay.

545
00:48:38,343 --> 00:48:39,284
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not gay.

546
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:43,691
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, and if you yell at me, I'm going to take out my bloody tampon and throw it at you.

547
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:50,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, gay is not a negative thing, so stop using it like it is.

548
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:51,416
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, thank you.

549
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,457
[SPEAKER_07]: You people suck ass.

550
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's gay now?

551
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,541
[SPEAKER_20]: You are the one that is gay.

552
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,723
[SPEAKER_07]: You are the ball lickers.

553
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:10,702
[SPEAKER_07]: But seriously, for all the people who go, oh, that's so gay, you people are the hemorrhoid on the butt of social progress.

554
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:13,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I say that's so gay all the time.

555
00:49:14,383 --> 00:49:18,645
[SPEAKER_07]: You say it in relation to things that may be associated with gay things.

556
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,806
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, I feel like I have an authority on it.

557
00:49:21,387 --> 00:49:23,428
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I have a wand and I can deem things.

558
00:49:23,448 --> 00:49:25,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I can say, this, gay.

559
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:26,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gay.

560
00:49:27,116 --> 00:49:39,105
[SPEAKER_23]: No, okay, Rob and his immediate gay friends, they constantly say, like, terms that would be used to describe a homosexual male in negative connotations.

561
00:49:39,405 --> 00:49:40,646
[SPEAKER_23]: You fucking faggot!

562
00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:41,527
[SPEAKER_23]: Things like that.

563
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:43,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you too!

564
00:49:44,929 --> 00:49:45,189
[SPEAKER_23]: See?

565
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:47,991
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's how we say, you know, hello and stuff.

566
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:52,695
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like... It's like another...

567
00:49:55,086 --> 00:49:58,608
[SPEAKER_23]: Group of people we know who use another word that is, yeah.

568
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:04,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, I'm going away from this topic, but here, have the microphone, faggot.

569
00:50:05,913 --> 00:50:06,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

570
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:15,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to burn my bra right here on behalf of drag queens everywhere.

571
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:15,999
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

572
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

573
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,602
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you guys want to hear who won tonight's case match?

574
00:50:20,182 --> 00:50:20,482
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

575
00:50:20,963 --> 00:50:21,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, too bad.

576
00:50:21,843 --> 00:50:22,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to hear.

577
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:24,525
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

578
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very happy this song won.

579
00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:29,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you are.

580
00:50:29,524 --> 00:50:29,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your song.

581
00:50:50,168 --> 00:50:53,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny Manero wins tonight's cage match in a very close vote.

582
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:56,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So all three songs pretty well represented tonight.

583
00:50:57,313 --> 00:50:58,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a mercy thing right there.

584
00:50:58,794 --> 00:51:00,095
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point is that I won.

585
00:51:01,195 --> 00:51:02,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I don't have to pick a song for next week.

586
00:51:03,077 --> 00:51:03,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

587
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:04,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It works out nice.

588
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:04,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys.

589
00:51:04,998 --> 00:51:07,059
[SPEAKER_07]: We needed the violin music playing in the background.

590
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:13,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to Pennsylvania for two weeks in front of my song.

591
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:15,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my poor heart.

592
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:23,170
[SPEAKER_05]: and I have a heart disease and I never learned to read!

593
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:24,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Be quiet.

594
00:51:24,991 --> 00:51:28,474
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey Rob, at least you're white, okay?

595
00:51:28,614 --> 00:51:30,375
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's okay for you to go to Pennsylvania.

596
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,457
[SPEAKER_23]: You won't have to be threatened by all the hicks over there.

597
00:51:33,497 --> 00:51:34,958
[SPEAKER_23]: What in the hell does that mean?

598
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:36,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, hicks where?

599
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Pennsylvania.

600
00:51:40,586 --> 00:51:41,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, never mind.

601
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:56,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I hear hick and all of a sudden I'm thinking like, okay, what you saying about... Look, on the outside I may be white, but on the inside... You're a black woman, a repressed black woman.

602
00:51:56,556 --> 00:51:59,018
[SPEAKER_04]: On the inside... Hey girl, yeah.

603
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:02,260
[SPEAKER_04]: On the inside I am blood and guts, just like you.

604
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:06,283
[SPEAKER_05]: On the outside...

605
00:52:08,064 --> 00:52:10,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're getting a call.

606
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:13,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I should actually answer the Skype line once in a while.

607
00:52:13,106 --> 00:52:14,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge.

608
00:52:15,086 --> 00:52:15,586
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want?

609
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:16,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

610
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:20,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, can you hear us?

611
00:52:20,288 --> 00:52:20,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge.

612
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:22,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, we're already getting prank calls.

613
00:52:23,709 --> 00:52:24,069
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

614
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:25,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, call her.

615
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your refrigerator running?

616
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,110
[SPEAKER_04]: You better catch it.

617
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:29,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Call you there?

618
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:30,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

619
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:31,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, there you are.

620
00:52:31,912 --> 00:52:32,252
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

621
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:32,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

622
00:52:35,438 --> 00:52:37,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn off your BitTorrent!

623
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn off your BitTorrent!

624
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn off your, uh... Stop downloading the port!

625
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:42,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up?

626
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:44,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You there?

627
00:52:44,582 --> 00:52:45,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no torrent.

628
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:45,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

629
00:52:46,403 --> 00:52:46,723
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

630
00:52:49,984 --> 00:52:50,685
[SPEAKER_24]: Not much, man.

631
00:52:51,225 --> 00:52:52,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's a lot of lag.

632
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:57,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I gotta let you go, dude, because you got a lot of lag going on here, so try calling us back a little later.

633
00:52:57,468 --> 00:52:58,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll clear up.

634
00:52:58,808 --> 00:52:59,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

635
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:00,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the call.

636
00:53:01,717 --> 00:53:02,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't catch it.

637
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:06,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I see the name on Skype, but the names on Skype are different than the chatroom names, so.

638
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Chuck, I'll call you back later, dude.

639
00:53:10,262 --> 00:53:11,582
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he didn't have any torrents running.

640
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:12,403
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a bad connection.

641
00:53:12,703 --> 00:53:13,183
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

642
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently our show dropped earlier, so it might even be us.

643
00:53:16,765 --> 00:53:17,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

644
00:53:17,065 --> 00:53:18,146
[SPEAKER_07]: That might have something to do with it.

645
00:53:18,286 --> 00:53:18,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have.

646
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:21,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave the Skype line open a little bit longer, though.

647
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:22,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else wants to give it a call.

648
00:53:23,128 --> 00:53:26,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's call in and talk about the topic.

649
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:27,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Change the subject?

650
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

651
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:30,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to dick and fart jokes.

652
00:53:31,337 --> 00:53:33,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, no, actually, we can take a break.

653
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:41,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I do want to play this, because I haven't even heard this yet, but apparently, Loki did a new remix last night, and I didn't even know about it.

654
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:42,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what's up, Loki?

655
00:53:42,746 --> 00:53:43,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about your newest remix.

656
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:44,367
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play it.

657
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:50,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I was bored, and I saw someone made some stupid remix, and it's not even really a remix that they made.

658
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:53,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like... I know it wasn't Max Remix.

659
00:53:53,215 --> 00:53:58,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, I heard the other day Insertion and Ecstasy, and they sounded the same!

660
00:53:58,599 --> 00:53:59,920
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided to mix them together.

661
00:54:00,939 --> 00:54:21,550
[SPEAKER_03]: and it sounded like crap, so, but, that got me thinking, I was like, hey, Ecstasy, I haven't used Ecstasy yet, and I was working on something before, and that just wasn't going anywhere, so I plugged Ecstasy in, and played that around, it's okay, my remixes are starting to become average now, and, yes, the DDR song, Ecstasy.

662
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:26,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is like an average remix now.

663
00:54:26,323 --> 00:54:29,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked on it for a couple hours and I was just like, eh.

664
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:31,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mediocre remix.

665
00:54:31,745 --> 00:54:32,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mediocre.

666
00:54:33,066 --> 00:54:33,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

667
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:34,787
[SPEAKER_03]: There's parts that are cool.

668
00:54:35,207 --> 00:54:41,910
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just like bad transitions in a few spots that I have to... It's really... The song I was working with was hard.

669
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:45,352
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is kind of a tribute song to the song that got me into techno in the first place.

670
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,981
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 Hours to Save the Earth by Tomski, so it's a remix between that.

671
00:54:49,121 --> 00:54:51,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.

672
00:54:51,923 --> 00:54:52,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

673
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:56,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to check this out, and then we'll be back, and we'll talk about more stuff.

674
00:54:56,786 --> 00:54:57,166
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

675
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:23,581
[SPEAKER_04]: For up to the minute Ramadian gaming news, discussion forums, and for access to the chat room, visit our website at orangeloungeradio.com Alright, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio, and that was Tomski vs. D-Complex, remixed by Loki there, Ecstasy, the 14 hours club mix.

676
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:24,341
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you guys think of that?

677
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:25,082
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was pretty good.

678
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:26,796
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

679
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:27,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to be honest with you.

680
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:34,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I think out of all of your songs, everything you've remixed, I think that is the one I would want to listen to more than anything else.

681
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:39,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I like a lot of his stuff, but I think I could see myself listening to that a lot.

682
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:40,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like that.

683
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:46,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I love Ecstasy to begin with, but I love the last minute and a half of the song with the other song mixed in.

684
00:58:46,896 --> 00:58:49,618
[SPEAKER_23]: I love how it makes you feel good when people touch you.

685
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:51,860
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, wait, wrong ecstasy.

686
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:56,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously... I think that is a better ecstasy remix than the one that was in Max 2.

687
00:58:56,624 --> 00:58:57,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, way better.

688
00:58:57,384 --> 00:58:58,725
[SPEAKER_04]: That one on Max 2 sucks.

689
00:58:59,346 --> 00:59:02,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot believe that Konami isn't calling you.

690
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:05,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I realize that you're taking commercial songs and fusing them together.

691
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:06,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Shh!

692
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:07,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell him the secret.

693
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:07,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, you know.

694
00:59:08,673 --> 00:59:10,074
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still think even with...

695
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:11,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm kidding.

696
00:59:11,835 --> 00:59:22,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think, even your, like, Silent Hill remix you had earlier, where you're kind of remixing it on top of itself and stuff, and with enough public domain samples out there, honestly, because we know in a lot of DDR songs they're using public domain samples.

697
00:59:22,204 --> 00:59:22,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

698
00:59:22,785 --> 00:59:31,412
[SPEAKER_03]: They're public domain, or they're just, they're like sample kits from Acid, I swear to God they are, because I listen to so much techno music and stuff that you're like, wait a second, that's that song.

699
00:59:31,472 --> 00:59:35,716
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, one Easy to Dancer song, which is called, like, uh...

700
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, I can't remember the name of it.

701
00:59:39,197 --> 00:59:41,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a long mega mix of like trance stuff.

702
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,006
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all commercial songs!

703
00:59:44,687 --> 00:59:45,609
[SPEAKER_03]: No credit to them!

704
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you completely ripped them off!

705
00:59:48,114 --> 00:59:49,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, you know?

706
00:59:49,296 --> 00:59:50,037
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously?

707
00:59:51,294 --> 00:59:52,535
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

708
01:00:09,602 --> 01:00:10,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever that one program is.

709
01:00:10,842 --> 01:00:11,342
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

710
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Fruity Loose!

711
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:14,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not making my song with Fruity Loose!

712
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,963
[SPEAKER_03]: How can they tell?

713
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,564
[SPEAKER_04]: How can they tell what program you're using?

714
01:00:16,604 --> 01:00:18,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it doesn't sound like MIDI.

715
01:00:18,424 --> 01:00:19,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they like.

716
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:20,065
[SPEAKER_04]: They like MIDI.

717
01:00:20,185 --> 01:00:22,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think you should just send it in anyway.

718
01:00:22,825 --> 01:00:23,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they say no, they say no.

719
01:00:24,046 --> 01:00:30,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, that is better than half the stuff that was in... Almost all the stuff that was in the Balmati Star Remix Contest last month.

720
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:35,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't have... Like, that right there is below my standards right there.

721
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:36,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

722
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:36,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

723
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:43,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, I like the parts in it, but I can't stand non-perfect transitions and stuff like that.

724
01:00:43,634 --> 01:00:44,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're just a perfectionist.

725
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:46,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But you did that in one evening.

726
01:00:47,116 --> 01:00:49,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did that in about three hours or a couple hours.

727
01:00:50,099 --> 01:01:03,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I just sat down, I was listening to this really shitty... It sounded like someone just had two songs playing back-to-back and they just... They didn't even really remix them on top of each other with acid, they just kind of faded one into the other.

728
01:01:04,426 --> 01:01:06,187
[SPEAKER_03]: or faded one in on top of the other one.

729
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:07,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It just didn't sound right.

730
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:12,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, if somebody is going to reject your song from a remix contest because of the program you used, they are being ignorant.

731
01:01:13,052 --> 01:01:13,892
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so ignorant.

732
01:01:13,912 --> 01:01:17,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because you understand that, you know, mash mixes are not real remixes.

733
01:01:17,615 --> 01:01:21,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but that's because people fucking did Paranoia Cowgirl, okay?

734
01:01:21,777 --> 01:01:22,418
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why.

735
01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:36,042
[SPEAKER_03]: What's funny, though, is I'd like them to tell the people that mash mixes aren't real mixes since, oh, wait a second, because I do think Acid, the site that actually produces the Acid 4.0 and stuff like that, guess what?

736
01:01:36,062 --> 01:01:37,803
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a whole remix contest section.

737
01:01:37,843 --> 01:01:38,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

738
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:43,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually recognized by many artists like BT and David Bowie.

739
01:01:43,624 --> 01:01:47,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, David Bowie, wasn't he giving away a car for some mashup contest?

740
01:01:47,605 --> 01:02:01,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, his, um, yeah, it was not only that, but his, um, the mash mixes were gonna be featured on his CD, so, you know, I guess that's not very important, you know, but hey, go ahead, play with Fruity Loops, because you're better than I am, because you know how to program instruments in MIDI.

741
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:02,466
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

742
01:02:02,506 --> 01:02:03,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So what?

743
01:02:03,147 --> 01:02:03,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

744
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:06,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not programming shit, but you know what?

745
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:10,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say that all the Fruity Loops remix stuff sucks, because there is some good stuff.

746
01:02:10,612 --> 01:02:13,294
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really good stuff out there, but there's also bad stuff too.

747
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:20,960
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really good too, and I think we need to recognize that mash mixes can be good when they're not stupid, basically.

748
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:21,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just put it this way.

749
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:25,203
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're not mash, insert Bambi song here.

750
01:02:25,403 --> 01:02:29,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody out there uses samples, whether you guys want to recognize that or not.

751
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:32,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know what, it's just, that's the way it is.

752
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:44,780
[SPEAKER_03]: People, but, you can program your own, like, you know, um... You can, like, remix, you know, you can, like, actually, you know, add, you know, synth on top of this stuff.

753
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,701
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need to learn.

754
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:48,924
[SPEAKER_03]: See, once I learn the Fruity Loop stuff, I'll be able to do that much more with it.

755
01:02:49,164 --> 01:02:52,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you should keep working at it, honestly, because, seriously, I think if you were just...

756
01:02:53,428 --> 01:03:03,536
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody were to give you money, and say, take a week, and take a DDR song, and put in public domain stuff, and original stuff, you would have an awesome DDR song.

757
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:05,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the situation, though.

758
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:08,761
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were to actually, like, say, Konami went to, I want you to remix this song.

759
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:15,547
[SPEAKER_03]: What they'll give you is they'll give you, like, this song, all the samples that were in it, and all the arrangements that were in it, like, basically the 8-track, the digital track.

760
01:03:16,147 --> 01:03:23,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot easier to work with raw, you know, tracks than just, you know, everything in a composition, so it's a lot harder to do it that way.

761
01:03:24,355 --> 01:03:37,607
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why, like, when, you know, Punk Knight gave me stuff to remix, it would be an EJ, he'd give me all the samples that he used and the arrangements they had, so you can just go in there, rearrange it, and add your own stuff into it, and it's a lot easier and sounds better.

762
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:42,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, they're not gonna just say, oh, we want you to take something that was on the soundtrack and remix it, so...

763
01:03:43,956 --> 01:03:44,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't care.

764
01:03:44,496 --> 01:03:47,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear the stuff from the, what was it, the DDROSX

765
01:04:14,379 --> 01:04:17,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what the hell the... OSC or whatever.

766
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:19,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to hear what their stuff was in there.

767
01:04:19,863 --> 01:04:21,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it's any good, you know, that's cool.

768
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:24,926
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's stuff that sucks too, you know.

769
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

770
01:04:27,288 --> 01:04:28,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing though.

771
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:32,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't consider it a remix if you remake the song in Fruity Loops.

772
01:04:32,772 --> 01:04:41,898
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take like synth and just basically remake the song, it sounds the same but it's a little different because you didn't quite get the right samples.

773
01:04:42,538 --> 01:04:43,399
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a remix.

774
01:04:44,073 --> 01:04:46,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

775
01:04:56,044 --> 01:04:57,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Waving your hand at it too much, going, eh, it sucks.

776
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was really good, personally.

777
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:00,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

778
01:05:03,188 --> 01:05:10,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Skype line is open if you have a comment on that remix, or comment on anything we've talked about during this show so far, really.

779
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:11,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get around to that.

780
01:05:12,294 --> 01:05:17,057
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get to the FUs in a little bit, and no, sorry, you will not be able to do your FUs over Skype.

781
01:05:17,857 --> 01:05:19,358
[SPEAKER_04]: The segment's too long as it is.

782
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:20,779
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to not make it any longer.

783
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:21,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh,

784
01:05:22,984 --> 01:05:23,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Foon Team

785
01:05:51,283 --> 01:05:52,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was it.

786
01:06:14,687 --> 01:06:15,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Dojinshi Sites

787
01:06:29,901 --> 01:06:31,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Food Mix Plus should be coming out.

788
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:34,542
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't really say what's going to be in it.

789
01:06:34,562 --> 01:06:38,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably just some additional songs and whatnot, but hey, it's cool.

790
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:45,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, there might be some additional songs and edit steps, because I know they had edit steps on their website, so that'd be kind of neat.

791
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:51,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tourney Mix 5, I have no fucking clue what's going on with that, so let's take a look-see here.

792
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:56,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Last thing I heard, they were in like sway votes or public sway votes or something like that.

793
01:06:57,982 --> 01:07:00,683
[SPEAKER_03]: and I have no idea what they're doing, semifinals, finals.

794
01:07:00,703 --> 01:07:02,083
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is a sway vote?

795
01:07:02,463 --> 01:07:07,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, okay, semifinals, they just finished that, um, now they're on, um, finals.

796
01:07:09,645 --> 01:07:13,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what we can vote on, um, oh, I have to be logged in, fuck that.

797
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:16,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, um, so, yeah, they're in finals.

798
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:23,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea who won, what's going on, but all I know is Kimo Sabe did not make it, and that makes me sad.

799
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:24,848
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

800
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that Just Like Naoki song make it in there?

801
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:32,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, here's the songs that were considered in the semifinals.

802
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:38,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's see, we've got Domo Domo Domo, the KCP remix, so... Whatever that is.

803
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:40,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Like Naoki.

804
01:07:41,309 --> 01:07:43,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Roppongi Canyon, it looks like it was.

805
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:48,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Lemmings, I think, and Pear Pear All Stars, One More Lovely...

806
01:07:51,010 --> 01:08:18,975
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Look at the Heaven, Halloween, Speedy Mix, Kick Your A by Archowl Then we have Party for You, Holy Night Mix, Stronger, Yoju, Kokoro no Bushi Niwa, Nari Nari, whatever that is, I don't know Some like crap Konnichiwa, Arigato Another Kick Your A, I think this is semi-finals right here I think this is semi-finals, so Kick Your A

807
01:08:19,602 --> 01:08:20,923
[SPEAKER_03]: One More Lovely, R.E.U.

808
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:25,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's kind of sad that it's always a remix of like a Bomani song that, you know what I mean?

809
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:25,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

810
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:31,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always like, I want a super hard song that's like, you know, ooh, it's something like what Money Ruler used to do.

811
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:34,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't the rules say that it has to be like catapult?

812
01:08:34,956 --> 01:08:35,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, whatever.

813
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:36,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

814
01:08:37,138 --> 01:08:39,160
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just being such dumbass idiots.

815
01:08:39,878 --> 01:08:41,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what's going on there.

816
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:42,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

817
01:08:42,139 --> 01:08:46,862
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as other stuff, really, that's been slow on all the, like, sites.

818
01:08:48,222 --> 01:08:51,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't really found any new, like, really good sim files or anything.

819
01:08:51,664 --> 01:08:53,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been playing what I had.

820
01:08:56,306 --> 01:09:03,010
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some really cool tutorials, though, on DDR Mania X, especially stuff to make your skin look more, like, in the groove, which is kind of neat.

821
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,872
[SPEAKER_03]: They have, like, you know, the little, what was it, the...

822
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:11,860
[SPEAKER_03]: How well you did, and you know the little graph there, just like in Beatmania.

823
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:19,646
[SPEAKER_03]: They have how you can put that in your sim, how to make a combo bar, which is kind of neat, and some other stuff.

824
01:09:20,026 --> 01:09:21,527
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll really help out your skins.

825
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:26,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So just look for those, they're really good tutorials.

826
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:30,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much all with that.

827
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:34,149
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

828
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:34,989
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

829
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,802
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually call us, and it's just like a phone call, except it doesn't cost you anything, it doesn't cost me anything, because it's all over our internet connection.

830
01:10:06,262 --> 01:10:08,643
[SPEAKER_04]: So, do give us a call.

831
01:10:09,303 --> 01:10:10,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

832
01:10:12,644 --> 01:10:17,486
[SPEAKER_04]: But do make sure you close your torrents and have the maximum bandwidth possible before calling, because otherwise it messes up.

833
01:10:20,326 --> 01:10:26,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I guess, since nobody is calling in on the Skype right now, maybe we'll go to another break, then we're going to come back and do the FUs.

834
01:10:28,109 --> 01:10:28,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good to me.

835
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:31,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Jamie, you have a thought?

836
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,977
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just wanted the microphone because it comforts me.

837
01:10:35,717 --> 01:10:37,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does having the microphone comfort you?

838
01:10:38,057 --> 01:10:38,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

839
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:40,158
[SPEAKER_07]: It just does!

840
01:10:41,058 --> 01:10:51,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy because I'm in fourth in line to get the Megamix from GTA 3 for Rise FM, which has the song I'm looking for, Neo the One by Slider.

841
01:10:53,701 --> 01:10:54,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a call on the Skype line.

842
01:10:54,841 --> 01:10:55,161
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

843
01:10:55,181 --> 01:10:55,861
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on Orange Lounge.

844
01:10:59,614 --> 01:11:01,115
[SPEAKER_04]: You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

845
01:11:02,335 --> 01:11:03,256
[SPEAKER_07]: You're at least trying to be.

846
01:11:03,816 --> 01:11:04,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Please say something.

847
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:07,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it us that slides really bad?

848
01:11:07,218 --> 01:11:08,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, I am here.

849
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:09,059
[SPEAKER_04]: You there?

850
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:09,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Richie?

851
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:10,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Again?

852
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:11,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

853
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:12,621
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

854
01:11:12,641 --> 01:11:12,981
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

855
01:11:13,001 --> 01:11:15,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had to call in again.

856
01:11:15,962 --> 01:11:16,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

857
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:17,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to hug up all the air.

858
01:11:17,903 --> 01:11:18,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's all right.

859
01:11:19,324 --> 01:11:21,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody else wants to call in, so we've got you.

860
01:11:21,825 --> 01:11:23,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still have that torrent going?

861
01:11:24,006 --> 01:11:24,446
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't.

862
01:11:24,687 --> 01:11:24,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

863
01:11:25,087 --> 01:11:26,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can hear you a little clearer now.

864
01:11:26,547 --> 01:11:26,728
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

865
01:11:26,748 --> 01:11:27,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a comment on something?

866
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:30,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say something about remixes and stuff.

867
01:11:30,939 --> 01:11:36,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Loki's remixes, I think you should, like, you know, like, submit them to, like, OC Remix or whatever.

868
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:48,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're really great, you know, it's like, you know, what he's doing with, you know, it's like, certain, like, songs and just, like, throwing, like, a whole new, like... Hey, Richie, speak a little bit louder so we can hear you, because... Sorry, can you hear me now?

869
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I can hear you now.

870
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:54,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying that, yeah, Loki should submit some of his stuff to OC Remix.

871
01:11:54,506 --> 01:11:58,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it sounds professional, really.

872
01:11:58,149 --> 01:12:05,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like, I had one of my teachers at my school listen to some of Loki's remixes, and he was wondering, hey, do you know who this guy is?

873
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:07,238
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was saying, oh, it's...

874
01:12:08,171 --> 01:12:08,331
[SPEAKER_09]: OC Remix

875
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you ever consider sending something like that?

876
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:31,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I would if I didn't use some other commercial songs.

877
01:12:31,654 --> 01:12:32,755
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing that's stopping you, huh?

878
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:34,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, it's true, it's true.

879
01:12:34,236 --> 01:12:34,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you thought about it?

880
01:12:34,816 --> 01:12:35,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me better now?

881
01:12:35,937 --> 01:12:38,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is my mic still like... I can hear you a little better now.

882
01:12:38,619 --> 01:12:39,080
[SPEAKER_04]: That's better.

883
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:39,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

884
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:39,981
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

885
01:12:40,781 --> 01:12:43,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see, other than that, well, I mean, keep up the good work, Loki.

886
01:12:43,784 --> 01:12:46,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward to any new remixes you might have.

887
01:12:46,186 --> 01:12:48,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

888
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:48,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the good work.

889
01:12:48,808 --> 01:12:48,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

890
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Remix more stuff.

891
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:50,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

892
01:12:50,669 --> 01:12:51,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for calling, Richie.

893
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:52,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no problem at all.

894
01:12:53,353 --> 01:12:53,833
[SPEAKER_09]: See you guys later.

895
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:23,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, have you thought about trying to maybe do something with public domain samples?

896
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:25,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought about it.

897
01:13:25,241 --> 01:13:34,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to go more that way anyways, because with this song even, I used a lot of those BT public domain samples that I got.

898
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:39,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you do one a while back where you remixed a song with other video game samples or something?

899
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:45,506
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of thing OC Remix would eat up, if it was video game music mixed with other video game music, I think.

900
01:13:46,034 --> 01:13:47,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I did.

901
01:13:47,114 --> 01:13:57,517
[SPEAKER_03]: The only song that's sort of like just a bunch of different songs was that Dynamis one, which was like kind of eh, you know.

902
01:13:57,778 --> 01:13:59,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I could just, I don't know.

903
01:14:00,338 --> 01:14:01,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much like, I like the stuff...

904
01:14:03,382 --> 01:14:07,323
[SPEAKER_03]: If I learned how to do, like, DMS files or something like that, you know, that'd be kick-ass.

905
01:14:07,923 --> 01:14:10,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, really, I don't have a lot of music theory and stuff.

906
01:14:10,504 --> 01:14:19,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I never took the classes, don't know shit about... I mean, I understand, you know, structure of a song and stuff, it just... Didn't they say that Akira Yamaoka couldn't even read music when he started?

907
01:14:19,926 --> 01:14:20,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

908
01:14:20,286 --> 01:14:21,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I could've sworn I read that on some fan site.

909
01:14:21,646 --> 01:14:27,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably... It's like, I just need to have, like... Because I need, like, you know, some of the set stuff.

910
01:14:28,368 --> 01:14:29,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, scales and stuff like that.

911
01:14:29,808 --> 01:14:32,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, really, if you listen to a lot of songs, they're the same scales.

912
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:37,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same structure, they're very simple, they just use really elaborate samples, that's all it is.

913
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:46,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, pretty much every single fucking trance song, you always have a four on the floor, and then you have some beat that's going at, you know, 12th notes, and that's it.

914
01:14:47,379 --> 01:14:53,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It's every single, yeah, it's every single, you know, trance song out there, pretty much.

915
01:14:54,845 --> 01:14:59,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried last night to make another Revenge Neo song, and it didn't turn out very well.

916
01:14:59,588 --> 01:15:05,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like, I tried, what was it, I was mixing that one, um, Revenge song from, uh,

917
01:15:07,053 --> 01:15:15,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Poppin' Music, it was the one that sounds sort of like Exotic Ethnic, but not.

918
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried mixing it with Exotic Ethnic, and that really sucked.

919
01:15:19,443 --> 01:15:20,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It did not sound well at all.

920
01:15:21,464 --> 01:15:22,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

921
01:15:23,306 --> 01:15:25,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get some sample kits and stuff.

922
01:15:26,008 --> 01:15:32,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of weary to do that, because I have 30,000 public domain samples on about

923
01:15:34,385 --> 01:15:38,068
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 CDs or so, 20 plus CDs, and I don't use any of them.

924
01:15:38,228 --> 01:15:39,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I use about two.

925
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:41,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Two out of those.

926
01:15:42,692 --> 01:15:43,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

927
01:15:44,053 --> 01:15:49,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to kind of go through and look at all those samples again, because I had them all ripped to my hard drive and it just took up too much space.

928
01:15:50,137 --> 01:15:50,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

929
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, what we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, the F use of the week.

930
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:58,664
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get ranty.

931
01:15:59,705 --> 01:16:02,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room's getting mad at me because I'm calling them all pussies, and they're like,

932
01:16:04,566 --> 01:16:05,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Skype doesn't work out.

933
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:07,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll have Aaron call you a pussy instead.

934
01:16:11,091 --> 01:16:12,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Or she'll barf up along.

935
01:16:12,532 --> 01:16:17,975
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, but some of them, I guess Skype only works on Windows XP, I guess.

936
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:19,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So that messes some people up.

937
01:16:20,157 --> 01:16:21,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And why don't you have Windows XP?

938
01:16:22,338 --> 01:16:24,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, some people don't.

939
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's Macs, Linux.

940
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:28,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people still want to use ME, whatever.

941
01:16:29,463 --> 01:16:30,984
[SPEAKER_23]: If you have a Mac, okay.

942
01:16:31,264 --> 01:16:32,465
[SPEAKER_23]: If you have Linux, okay.

943
01:16:32,485 --> 01:16:32,565
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

944
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:36,813
[SPEAKER_23]: But if you're using any other kind of form of Windows, why don't you have Windows XP?

945
01:16:37,574 --> 01:16:41,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Challenging somebody on their operating system, though, is such a nerd war.

946
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:45,260
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just waiting to get lashed at for challenging someone on their operating system.

947
01:16:46,821 --> 01:16:47,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes the chat room.

948
01:16:47,581 --> 01:16:48,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Here they come.

949
01:16:48,022 --> 01:16:52,545
[SPEAKER_07]: There is, by the way, a certain build where you start off with Windows 3.11, build up through to 2000.

950
01:16:53,646 --> 01:16:59,110
[SPEAKER_07]: But you take, I think, 3.11, upgrade that to NT, upgrade that to 2000.

951
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:02,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be the most secure way to run Windows.

952
01:17:03,462 --> 01:17:04,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Much more secure than XP.

953
01:17:05,563 --> 01:17:07,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a lot of people who do it that way.

954
01:17:08,384 --> 01:17:09,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway... Everything will still run.

955
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:24,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway... Okay, so... And you remember what happened, you know... But I see that we've got a ton of people on our Skype list, so I know that there's more people than just the one calling in, so... It's alright.

956
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:26,609
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

957
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:27,829
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

958
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:32,271
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna go... You just like saying the word pussy, don't you, Erin?

959
01:17:32,551 --> 01:17:33,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And boobies.

960
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:35,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this show.

961
01:17:36,227 --> 01:17:36,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

962
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:38,089
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the other word?

963
01:17:38,329 --> 01:17:39,049
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

964
01:17:40,931 --> 01:17:45,835
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back with the FUs of the week, which you can send over a private message.

965
01:17:46,715 --> 01:17:50,819
[SPEAKER_04]: But please no FUs to Brad for his operating system rant, because I just don't want to go there tonight.

966
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:51,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

967
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:52,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

968
01:20:56,741 --> 01:20:57,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

969
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:25,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

970
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:27,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to be staffed by Hollywood?

971
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:27,471
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

972
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:31,272
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we care what people think of us?

973
01:22:31,892 --> 01:22:33,753
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

974
01:22:33,793 --> 01:22:35,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

975
01:22:35,694 --> 01:22:38,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes!

976
01:22:39,776 --> 01:22:41,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Extreme Babani Radio.

977
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

978
01:22:45,218 --> 01:22:46,819
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back, Orange Lounge Radio.

979
01:22:46,839 --> 01:22:47,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are, episode number 103.

980
01:22:48,099 --> 01:22:49,219
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Rob?

981
01:22:50,982 --> 01:22:53,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty soon we'll get to use the other promo again.

982
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, because Pump Up the Volume is doing it.

983
01:22:56,446 --> 01:22:57,787
[SPEAKER_04]: When are you officially moving that?

984
01:22:58,327 --> 01:23:07,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I start school August 16th, but I think I have an orientation the week before, so it's probably going to be either the first or second week in August.

985
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but this week you can hear Pump Up the Volume what night?

986
01:23:10,455 --> 01:23:11,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Monday!

987
01:23:11,316 --> 01:23:12,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Monday, Sunday.

988
01:23:12,657 --> 01:23:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens on Monday night at 7 and 7.30?

989
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:20,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I actually have started my pre-show a whole lot earlier now because I usually just get bored.

990
01:23:22,007 --> 01:23:24,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Pre-show's been now starting about 6.45.

991
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:27,189
[SPEAKER_07]: 6.45 to 7 o'clock.

992
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:29,610
[SPEAKER_07]: And then around 7.30 I start the normal show.

993
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:33,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's supposed to end at 10.30, but sometimes I just stay bored and keep going.

994
01:23:33,231 --> 01:23:34,552
[SPEAKER_04]: You're basically just a radio whore.

995
01:23:34,992 --> 01:23:35,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm such a whore.

996
01:23:36,313 --> 01:23:37,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you do on that show?

997
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:42,135
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposedly a request show, but nobody ever requests anything anymore except Dark Knight.

998
01:23:44,136 --> 01:23:45,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And Angel does sometimes when she's there.

999
01:23:48,618 --> 01:23:48,818
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

1000
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:58,616
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you hang out in our chat room, like many of you are right now, you can request or spend any song that you want to listen to.

1001
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:03,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got access now to more music, so my library will just be growing.

1002
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:14,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in fact, I've been trying to start a segment on my show that's DarkSakura email, much in the vein of StrongBad email.

1003
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I answer your email.

1004
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Will you talk with a voice like this?

1005
01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:23,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to be doing the... Dear DarkSakura.

1006
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:24,142
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm kidding.

1007
01:24:24,202 --> 01:24:26,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to be talking in the strong bad voice.

1008
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:33,064
[SPEAKER_07]: As you take some stuff, add some more stuff, and answer the email.

1009
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:34,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to be doing that, no.

1010
01:24:35,585 --> 01:24:41,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just send me a private message on our forums.

1011
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:42,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Hint, hint, hint.

1012
01:24:43,386 --> 01:25:03,741
[SPEAKER_07]: at orangechallengeradio.com or shoot me an email to darksakura at gmail.com because you can send it right to me or you can send it to our other email at orangechallengeradio at yahoo.com

1013
01:25:07,507 --> 01:25:10,670
[SPEAKER_07]: and I prefer having MP3s to OGGs, thank you.

1014
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:13,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I can use them, but I can't play them on the station.

1015
01:25:15,594 --> 01:25:19,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday nights is Diversion, the Orange Launch Radio remix show.

1016
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:23,292
[SPEAKER_04]: which will not be live for the next couple weeks because I'm not going to be in town.

1017
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:25,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But do enjoy the great music on there.

1018
01:25:25,434 --> 01:25:29,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make sure to try and bump up the playlist a little bit before I leave town.

1019
01:25:29,176 --> 01:25:30,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some really good stuff.

1020
01:25:30,877 --> 01:25:31,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome music.

1021
01:25:31,718 --> 01:25:34,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more people have been tuning in lately and just hearing what a great show that is.

1022
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:38,702
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Loki's remixes, there's tons of very talented people just like them out there.

1023
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:42,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Remixing Mamani songs and we like to give all those songs a place to be heard.

1024
01:25:42,826 --> 01:25:44,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So Diversion is that place.

1025
01:25:44,648 --> 01:25:46,110
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 o'clock Tuesday nights here on the station.

1026
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:52,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Wednesday nights are empty right now but I hope to have an announcement about Vanilla Sky when I get back from my trip.

1027
01:25:53,558 --> 01:25:54,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Lanky Style?

1028
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:57,796
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just picking his nose, that's all right.

1029
01:25:57,816 --> 01:25:58,557
[SPEAKER_07]: He's picking his nose.

1030
01:25:58,637 --> 01:25:58,997
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1031
01:25:59,437 --> 01:26:11,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, you can pick your friends, you can pick your nose, but if you pick your friend's nose, you're a big, gross, paraplegic, and they need their nose picked.

1032
01:26:12,202 --> 01:26:13,983
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, I'm doing them a favor.

1033
01:26:15,723 --> 01:26:16,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1034
01:26:16,163 --> 01:26:21,545
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you need to, this is what tweezers are for, okay?

1035
01:26:21,985 --> 01:26:23,026
[SPEAKER_04]: More interesting things.

1036
01:26:23,406 --> 01:26:24,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care about the handicapped.

1037
01:26:25,067 --> 01:26:25,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make that clear.

1038
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,643
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a fetish for picking the nose of paraplegics.

1039
01:26:30,123 --> 01:26:30,543
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1040
01:26:30,843 --> 01:26:33,484
[SPEAKER_04]: When did this show derail that quickly?

1041
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:34,525
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

1042
01:26:35,405 --> 01:26:35,825
[SPEAKER_08]: When?

1043
01:26:36,946 --> 01:26:39,907
[SPEAKER_08]: How about episode two when I wasn't here?

1044
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:45,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1045
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:48,530
[SPEAKER_07]: How about on that Bart train?

1046
01:26:53,143 --> 01:26:58,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, there's some actual other Bomani news going on this week, and it's Bomani news that doesn't involve California.

1047
01:26:58,825 --> 01:27:00,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have hot Bomani action?

1048
01:27:01,146 --> 01:27:01,846
[SPEAKER_04]: California!

1049
01:27:03,027 --> 01:27:03,747
[SPEAKER_04]: California!

1050
01:27:06,508 --> 01:27:08,189
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Lowe's.

1051
01:27:08,589 --> 01:27:10,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Lowe's is a big theater chain.

1052
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:12,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they have any Lowe's here in California.

1053
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:13,171
[SPEAKER_04]: California!

1054
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:15,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what Lowe's is.

1055
01:27:16,212 --> 01:27:18,593
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not Lowe's Hardware Store, it's Lowe's Theater Chain.

1056
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:30,465
[SPEAKER_04]: They are hosting a Ultimate Film Fan Contest, and for whatever reason, being an Ultimate Film Fan involves lots of Sony PlayStation 2 video games.

1057
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:40,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they will be having these local events going on where you can play Karaoke Revolution Vol.

1058
01:27:41,128 --> 01:27:46,350
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 and, get this, DDR Extreme before it comes out.

1059
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:50,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Before it comes out, you'll be able to play DDR Extreme.

1060
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:52,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are all happening on the East Coast.

1061
01:27:52,831 --> 01:28:03,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going from Texas to Michigan to Jersey to New York, Massachusetts, Washington, that's about the closest it's going to get to here, Ohio, New York, Maryland, and Illinois.

1062
01:28:03,697 --> 01:28:05,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is running from July through September.

1063
01:28:05,658 --> 01:28:12,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you live in one of those areas, you want to get a jump on Extreme and you want to check it out and see what it's all about.

1064
01:28:14,335 --> 01:28:16,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1065
01:28:44,501 --> 01:28:46,563
[SPEAKER_04]: But Mel B wants me to pass this along.

1066
01:28:47,704 --> 01:28:53,728
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a Konami booth at Comic-Con in San Diego this week, Thursday through Sunday.

1067
01:28:54,349 --> 01:29:01,054
[SPEAKER_04]: At the booth will be the most recent demos of DDR Extreme and Ultramix 2 for PS2 and Xbox.

1068
01:29:01,995 --> 01:29:04,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think that's going to mean we're going to have next week?

1069
01:29:06,518 --> 01:29:07,239
[SPEAKER_04]: New song list!

1070
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:08,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, new song list.

1071
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to check out what some of the new songs on these demos are going to be,

1072
01:29:14,865 --> 01:29:30,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thursday through Sunday, Comic Con, San Diego Konami will also be doing contests and giveaways So California doesn't miss out completely You know, I wonder though, why do people always leave out my home state with this?

1073
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,043
[SPEAKER_07]: We need DDR contests in Alabama We do?

1074
01:29:34,383 --> 01:29:39,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes People in the South play DDR too Skype line's open if you have a comment

1075
01:29:42,535 --> 01:29:44,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're going to leave out the Wayne's World jokes.

1076
01:29:46,378 --> 01:29:46,738
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1077
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:59,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll get into the FUs here a little bit, but I still am trying to figure out why a movie theater would just randomly have DDR, but then I kind of think back to the Metreon, how they have the DDR.

1078
01:29:59,728 --> 01:29:59,948
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1079
01:30:01,149 --> 01:30:02,550
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Brad saying over there?

1080
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:02,890
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1081
01:30:03,891 --> 01:30:05,972
[SPEAKER_07]: We were making a joke about people calling.

1082
01:30:06,032 --> 01:30:11,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone was breaking into the Blondie song, and I was doing the whole sex line thing.

1083
01:30:13,255 --> 01:30:16,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick up the phone!

1084
01:30:16,436 --> 01:30:17,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that only air in this area?

1085
01:30:17,937 --> 01:30:19,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that a nationwide commercial?

1086
01:30:19,277 --> 01:30:20,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nationwide.

1087
01:30:20,758 --> 01:30:22,979
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been on TV forever.

1088
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always on during Jerry Springer.

1089
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,801
[SPEAKER_23]: Pick up the phone!

1090
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:33,623
[SPEAKER_23]: I love when the Sci-Fi Channel used to do Saturday Night Anime, and then they changed it to Saturday Morning Anime.

1091
01:30:33,963 --> 01:30:37,285
[SPEAKER_23]: And they always used to play those commercials in the commercial breaks.

1092
01:30:37,505 --> 01:30:40,386
[SPEAKER_23]: So they got Anime, which is considered cartoons over here.

1093
01:30:40,777 --> 01:30:41,677
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we got a call.

1094
01:30:41,917 --> 01:30:42,377
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a call.

1095
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:43,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, don't interrupt me.

1096
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:44,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish?

1097
01:30:44,378 --> 01:30:44,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish?

1098
01:30:44,738 --> 01:30:45,138
[SPEAKER_04]: They can hold.

1099
01:30:45,158 --> 01:30:45,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish?

1100
01:30:45,438 --> 01:30:45,898
[SPEAKER_04]: They can hold.

1101
01:30:46,578 --> 01:30:47,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm finished.

1102
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1103
01:30:49,539 --> 01:30:50,199
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a caller.

1104
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,680
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on Orange Lounge.

1105
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:53,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I'm not interrupting.

1106
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,180
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's all right.

1107
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:55,621
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.

1108
01:30:55,641 --> 01:30:56,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's that?

1109
01:30:56,661 --> 01:30:57,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello again, Sky.

1110
01:30:57,681 --> 01:30:58,541
[SPEAKER_10]: It's me, Siggy.

1111
01:30:58,821 --> 01:30:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Siggy.

1112
01:30:59,321 --> 01:30:59,762
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

1113
01:31:00,242 --> 01:31:00,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1114
01:31:00,862 --> 01:31:01,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a comment?

1115
01:31:01,994 --> 01:31:03,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, just the random stuff.

1116
01:31:03,815 --> 01:31:11,258
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, in case you have any problems pronouncing Japanese titles or Japanese names, you know, don't hesitate to call me.

1117
01:31:11,398 --> 01:31:15,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, by the way... You could ask me, but they never do.

1118
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you see, you're never here.

1119
01:31:17,001 --> 01:31:17,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just kidding.

1120
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:19,362
[SPEAKER_23]: Excuse you!

1121
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:20,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1122
01:31:22,299 --> 01:31:23,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get the glare.

1123
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,222
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's much funnier to hear Rob destroy the Japanese language.

1124
01:31:26,242 --> 01:31:29,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, isn't it funnier to hear me stumble through it, though?

1125
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:34,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's why Jamie doesn't bother to step in and correct me, because it's so much funnier when I fuck it up.

1126
01:31:35,228 --> 01:31:37,770
[SPEAKER_07]: At least you're finally saying Sakura right, sort of.

1127
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:38,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakura?

1128
01:31:39,511 --> 01:31:41,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you can shut up.

1129
01:31:41,713 --> 01:31:47,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura says... Wait a minute, actually... Wait a minute, hold on.

1130
01:31:48,137 --> 01:31:51,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been studying Japanese since I was nine years old, so...

1131
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:58,469
[SPEAKER_10]: All I can say is my accent is already 95% accurate.

1132
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:02,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you actually have Japanese in your blood, or have you just been otaku since birth?

1133
01:32:02,692 --> 01:32:04,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, I learned it by accident.

1134
01:32:05,414 --> 01:32:07,555
[SPEAKER_10]: How'd that work?

1135
01:32:08,296 --> 01:32:18,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in the Philippines, where I was actually born, there were a few channels, and then one of them is a Japanese learning show.

1136
01:32:19,311 --> 01:32:20,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Learn how to speak Japanese.

1137
01:32:20,632 --> 01:32:24,613
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where I got my accent and my grammar.

1138
01:32:25,613 --> 01:32:26,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1139
01:32:28,134 --> 01:32:28,414
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1140
01:32:28,654 --> 01:32:31,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

1141
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:35,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to comment on besides your offer to correct me when I screw up, which is quite often?

1142
01:32:35,936 --> 01:32:37,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not really a screw up.

1143
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:40,418
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, you know, if you're having fun.

1144
01:32:40,578 --> 01:32:41,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it is.

1145
01:32:42,018 --> 01:32:43,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Rob, he's so funny.

1146
01:32:43,519 --> 01:32:44,479
[SPEAKER_13]: He's so white.

1147
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,100
Yes, he is.

1148
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:49,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello out there.

1149
01:32:49,141 --> 01:32:49,361
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Rob.

1150
01:32:49,381 --> 01:32:53,103
[SPEAKER_13]: But you might know me in the online world as Sky.

1151
01:33:17,225 --> 01:33:22,207
[SPEAKER_04]: On June 23rd at 7pm Pacific Time, join DarkSakura and I for the Orange Lounge.

1152
01:33:22,328 --> 01:33:29,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, that's actually grammatically incorrect because you don't use and I, it would be and me.

1153
01:33:29,591 --> 01:33:29,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1154
01:33:47,867 --> 01:33:49,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

1155
01:33:49,148 --> 01:33:50,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Here come the grammar police.

1156
01:33:50,568 --> 01:33:52,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I'm double busted tonight.

1157
01:33:52,869 --> 01:33:55,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I am like, because it's used as an object and not as a subject.

1158
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:57,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It was two years ago.

1159
01:33:57,151 --> 01:33:57,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a break.

1160
01:34:00,312 --> 01:34:02,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It was when I was a radio amateur.

1161
01:34:02,633 --> 01:34:08,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Kansai... Oh, dude, Kansai Ben is like so hot.

1162
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:11,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Just call me Ski.

1163
01:34:11,137 --> 01:34:12,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just call me Ski.

1164
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:13,477
[SPEAKER_04]: That pisses me off enough.

1165
01:34:13,538 --> 01:34:13,938
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

1166
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:14,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't piss me off.

1167
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:15,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Arigatou

1168
01:34:43,206 --> 01:34:44,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Arigato.

1169
01:34:45,588 --> 01:34:48,991
[SPEAKER_05]: You say arigato like we say arigato.

1170
01:34:52,093 --> 01:34:53,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1171
01:34:53,594 --> 01:34:55,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonny Chiba is the man.

1172
01:34:57,237 --> 01:34:57,797
[SPEAKER_22]: What did he say?

1173
01:34:57,817 --> 01:34:58,618
[SPEAKER_22]: I forget.

1174
01:34:58,658 --> 01:35:01,160
[SPEAKER_22]: He's like... What did he say after that?

1175
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,922
[SPEAKER_22]: Very good!

1176
01:35:03,942 --> 01:35:04,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, um...

1177
01:35:10,743 --> 01:35:13,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we need to do is go into the FUs of the week.

1178
01:35:13,864 --> 01:35:14,624
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

1179
01:35:15,024 --> 01:35:15,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Woohoo!

1180
01:35:15,484 --> 01:35:16,085
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite part!

1181
01:35:16,185 --> 01:35:22,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, remember, we only have a half hour show left, so let's try to keep this a relatively good length here.

1182
01:35:22,867 --> 01:35:23,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.

1183
01:35:27,368 --> 01:35:28,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, we're going to start it off.

1184
01:35:30,089 --> 01:35:31,149
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, are you ready?

1185
01:35:31,789 --> 01:35:33,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm ready to be ranty.

1186
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,470
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you ready to go?

1187
01:35:34,918 --> 01:35:36,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you can... Where's the ferret?

1188
01:35:37,521 --> 01:35:38,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, what... Ow.

1189
01:35:39,503 --> 01:35:41,305
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we do during the F-U's of the week?

1190
01:35:41,405 --> 01:35:42,967
[SPEAKER_08]: We throw paper towels at Rob.

1191
01:35:48,873 --> 01:35:50,094
[SPEAKER_15]: I already did.

1192
01:35:58,376 --> 01:35:59,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I need that ferret.

1193
01:36:00,157 --> 01:36:05,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't wipe it on your... F you to wiping the ferret on your ass, okay?

1194
01:36:06,881 --> 01:36:07,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw it at Rob now.

01:36:08,862 --> 01:36:09,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, eh.

01:36:10,383 --> 01:36:10,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me that.

01:36:10,903 --> 01:36:11,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1198
01:36:12,604 --> 01:36:14,005
[SPEAKER_08]: You get that ferret thrown at your head.

1199
01:36:14,906 --> 01:36:18,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob gets a ferret thrown at his head.

01:36:18,188 --> 01:36:19,008
[SPEAKER_04]: F you time.

01:36:19,188 --> 01:36:19,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.

01:36:20,849 --> 01:36:22,710
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to all you people for distracting me.

1203
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:23,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:23,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, ferrets.

01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:55,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Those people Anyway, F you to distracting me Because I've been so easily distracted all day And F you to being fatigued all damn day I'm trying to go out and spend a day with my fiance You know, spending money, which I consider highly romantic Because money is the way to win my heart Sex has nothing to do with it, it's money

1206
01:36:57,941 --> 01:37:00,083
[SPEAKER_07]: No, money is a meme.

1207
01:37:01,944 --> 01:37:04,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And sex is just the stuff that happens.

1208
01:37:06,928 --> 01:37:08,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Sex is what you get when you give me money.

1209
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:11,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, are you saying that I am a whore?

1210
01:37:13,352 --> 01:37:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say anything, you just did.

1211
01:37:19,156 --> 01:37:20,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Rob's the whore, that's it.

1212
01:37:20,698 --> 01:37:22,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the story of my life, anyway.

1213
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:26,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really not that shallow, by the way, but still.

1214
01:37:26,318 --> 01:37:37,347
[SPEAKER_07]: We were going out, we were going laser disc hunting today, because I found the Beauty and the Beast Work in Progress laser disc, which goes for like a hundred something dollars on eBay, for ten bucks last night.

1215
01:37:39,268 --> 01:37:42,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was going back to buy more laser discs, and I

1216
01:37:44,232 --> 01:38:00,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I was getting so tired, and Dan's like, let's go to Tower Books, so I can sit in this chair and read a book about Pac-Man merchandise for an hour, while his poor, poor, poor suffering fiance has to go to the bathroom.

1217
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:02,837
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's no public bathroom at Tower Books.

1218
01:38:03,497 --> 01:38:08,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm here, okay Dan, hurry up, okay Dan, hurry up, okay Dan, hurry up, okay Dan, hurry up, and finally I'm like, get your ass out of the chair!

1219
01:38:08,918 --> 01:38:11,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go to the bathroom.

1220
01:38:12,019 --> 01:38:12,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1221
01:38:13,166 --> 01:38:18,971
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't really like that, but we... Yeah, it was the Pulte emergency.

1222
01:38:20,232 --> 01:38:21,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I was about to do the dance.

1223
01:38:22,755 --> 01:38:31,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, another FU goes toward people who... SUV drivers in general.

1224
01:38:32,028 --> 01:38:41,133
[SPEAKER_07]: There are, I have to say, a few people out there who know how to responsibly drive their vehicle and then there's everybody else who ruins it for the few who do.

1225
01:38:41,973 --> 01:38:45,335
[SPEAKER_07]: You people do not need to be driving a vehicle that big, okay?

1226
01:38:45,675 --> 01:38:57,481
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I want my freakin' rebuilt Humvee with an assault rifle built onto it so I can gun your asses down and drive over you in my armored vehicle and not have you all in my way.

1227
01:38:59,882 --> 01:39:01,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will stay in my lane

1228
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:04,037
[SPEAKER_07]: and abide by the speed limit.

1229
01:39:04,837 --> 01:39:05,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1230
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:09,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And my gun will be on a torrent, yeah?

1231
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:13,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can get the people who are trying to get behind me.

1232
01:39:14,303 --> 01:39:15,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, you tailgate my ass, you're dead too.

1233
01:39:16,965 --> 01:39:19,226
[SPEAKER_07]: The road, okay, I just need my own road, okay?

1234
01:39:23,168 --> 01:39:27,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I need the Jetson's car so that I don't have to deal with traffic.

1235
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:29,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I need my own jet.

1236
01:39:29,352 --> 01:39:30,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I want a jet.

1237
01:39:30,613 --> 01:39:31,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's why I want a jet.

1238
01:39:31,413 --> 01:39:32,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a note of that.

1239
01:39:35,479 --> 01:39:42,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Another F you goes toward my schedule for being so damn busy this week that I haven't been able to get to the gym as much as I wanted to.

1240
01:39:42,745 --> 01:39:43,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I was supposed to go running today.

1241
01:39:44,786 --> 01:39:46,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I was up so late last night.

1242
01:39:47,228 --> 01:39:50,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Another F you goes to insomnia because I have it really bad.

1243
01:39:51,892 --> 01:39:59,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Another F you goes toward money for not having much of it, distance for it existing, and

1244
01:40:00,589 --> 01:40:04,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Not being able to go where I want to go, or see who I want to see, or do what I want to do.

1245
01:40:05,955 --> 01:40:18,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Another F you goes toward the general attitude in this state, because I'm getting really sick of it, and I really, really need to just get back to Alabama for a week so that I can be around people who are relatively polite and have good manners, at least to your face.

1246
01:40:21,966 --> 01:40:28,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, it's just been kind of a, and it's going to be a crap, yeah, another FU to peak season at my job.

1247
01:40:29,069 --> 01:40:37,852
[SPEAKER_07]: All of you people who are trying to go to school, and I guess that's including me, you know, try calling your financial aid office instead of calling me first.

1248
01:40:39,013 --> 01:40:41,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though they probably don't know what they're doing.

1249
01:40:42,074 --> 01:40:45,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and a big FU goes to ARC's financial aid office.

1250
01:40:46,872 --> 01:40:51,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Learn the freaking student aid process and tell it to other people.

1251
01:40:52,295 --> 01:40:56,517
[SPEAKER_07]: If one of you is going to say something to somebody, make sure all of you are saying the same thing.

1252
01:40:56,857 --> 01:41:02,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of one person saying thing A, one person saying thing B, just stay on the right page.

1253
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:03,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay on the same page.

1254
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,761
[SPEAKER_07]: At least be consistent with your information.

1255
01:41:08,382 --> 01:41:12,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really, I guess, about it.

1256
01:41:12,464 --> 01:41:13,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten the angst out.

1257
01:41:15,306 --> 01:41:15,886
[SPEAKER_07]: They're currently...

1258
01:41:16,710 --> 01:41:22,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the ferret likes it.

1259
01:41:24,013 --> 01:41:25,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bet Rob doesn't know what I just said.

1260
01:41:26,214 --> 01:41:27,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because I was saying goodbye to Brad.

1261
01:41:28,155 --> 01:41:28,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, bye Brad.

1262
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:30,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1263
01:41:31,216 --> 01:41:36,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, Loki's cock is just stiff and erect.

1264
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:37,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Half hour show, Jamie.

1265
01:41:38,052 --> 01:41:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Half hour left in the show, Jamie.

1266
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:39,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm done?

1267
01:41:40,133 --> 01:41:40,393
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1268
01:41:40,553 --> 01:41:43,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said I was done and you were ignoring me.

1269
01:41:43,474 --> 01:41:44,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I think.

1270
01:41:44,075 --> 01:41:44,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So, F you.

1271
01:41:44,615 --> 01:41:44,955
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1272
01:41:45,796 --> 01:41:47,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, uh, Logie's turn.

1273
01:41:47,616 --> 01:41:52,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I forgot about that song.

1274
01:41:53,219 --> 01:41:55,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Any... Okay.

1275
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:59,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, anyways, um, fuck you too, um...

1276
01:42:01,738 --> 01:42:06,162
[SPEAKER_03]: to RadioShack because like if the computers break down you start to panic.

1277
01:42:06,282 --> 01:42:08,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you supposed to be there to know how to fix things?

1278
01:42:09,084 --> 01:42:10,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I thought that's what RadioShack was.

1279
01:42:10,786 --> 01:42:13,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fix things, sell me satellite dishes and cell phones.

1280
01:42:14,029 --> 01:42:14,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and batteries.

1281
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:23,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you suck and F you to stupid SUV drivers because you suck and you can't drive your SUV.

1282
01:42:23,077 --> 01:42:27,581
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's like a race car or like a highly maneuverable car or...

1283
01:42:28,081 --> 01:42:31,487
[SPEAKER_03]: A car that will just, you know, let go of the wheel and it will drive in the lane.

1284
01:42:31,547 --> 01:42:33,491
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a compact car.

1285
01:42:33,991 --> 01:42:36,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, it's no, not a, um...

1286
01:42:37,682 --> 01:42:38,202
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sucks.

1287
01:42:38,542 --> 01:42:41,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't drive an SUV if you don't have kids or if you're driving alone.

1288
01:42:41,963 --> 01:42:44,444
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have another car for driving when you're alone.

1289
01:42:44,804 --> 01:42:46,384
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be a one person car.

1290
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Not this car that can hold 50 people.

1291
01:42:48,965 --> 01:42:54,126
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see bus drivers driving buses around aimlessly without anyone in there and parking in compact spaces.

1292
01:42:54,226 --> 01:42:56,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not expect you to be doing the same.

1293
01:42:56,607 --> 01:42:59,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, do not park your SUVs in compact spaces.

1294
01:43:00,108 --> 01:43:00,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like you.

1295
01:43:01,898 --> 01:43:04,120
[SPEAKER_03]: and those stupid fuckers that park on the line.

1296
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because your tire's on the line does not count.

1297
01:43:07,182 --> 01:43:08,463
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be in the line.

1298
01:43:08,963 --> 01:43:13,086
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can't open my door when you're on the line and the person next to me is on the line.

1299
01:43:13,467 --> 01:43:17,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Or over the line because your SUV's too big and you're parking in a compact space.

1300
01:43:18,590 --> 01:43:20,351
[SPEAKER_20]: God, you people are so stupid.

1301
01:43:20,392 --> 01:43:30,219
[SPEAKER_20]: You won't walk the extra few feet because, oh my god, all that SUV driving has gotten me tired and if I have to stand this heat for any longer, I'm gonna die!

1302
01:43:32,237 --> 01:43:34,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, fuck you to stupid kids with laser pointers in movie theaters.

1303
01:43:35,258 --> 01:43:35,899
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not funny.

1304
01:43:36,499 --> 01:43:38,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, you cannot destroy the robots with laser pointers.

1305
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:40,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It just does not work.

1306
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:54,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, fuck you to stupid previews before movies, because, you know, that's just delaying my movie-watching time, and I really don't want to see another preview for The Manchurian Candidate.

1307
01:43:55,127 --> 01:43:56,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not see that movie.

1308
01:43:56,668 --> 01:43:57,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a remake.

1309
01:43:57,448 --> 01:43:59,529
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wanted to see the movie, I'd watch the original.

1310
01:44:00,069 --> 01:44:01,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Not with Denzel Washington.

1311
01:44:05,867 --> 01:44:19,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, finally, finally, um, fuck you to the goddamn people at Roundtable, because I go there to get a lunch buffet, and they have to be jackasses and go, I don't want to make pizzas for the buffet!

1312
01:44:19,656 --> 01:44:22,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't offer a buffet if you don't want to make pizzas for the buffet!

1313
01:44:22,898 --> 01:44:26,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you think you're so smart, I'm gonna make a vegetarian pizza!

1314
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:27,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, I'm cool!

1315
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:31,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to wait, you know, forever for them to make goddamn pizzas.

1316
01:44:31,809 --> 01:44:33,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pop in a couple pepperonis.

1317
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:35,830
[SPEAKER_03]: They take less than a few seconds to make, okay?

1318
01:44:37,011 --> 01:44:37,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And stop whining.

1319
01:44:38,231 --> 01:44:40,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I swear to God, it's not like, you know, you're gonna be there forever.

1320
01:44:41,792 --> 01:44:42,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm done.

1321
01:44:44,613 --> 01:44:45,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1322
01:44:45,513 --> 01:44:45,953
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

1323
01:44:49,954 --> 01:44:52,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, my FU goes to stress.

1324
01:44:52,802 --> 01:44:55,983
[SPEAKER_04]: especially before this trip I have to take by myself.

1325
01:44:56,364 --> 01:45:01,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a hard time going to the bathroom by myself, let alone having to travel back to the East Coast.

1326
01:45:01,946 --> 01:45:03,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give me a funny look when I say that, Aaron.

1327
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:07,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls go to the bathroom together all the time.

1328
01:45:09,249 --> 01:45:10,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.

1329
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:11,230
[SPEAKER_04]: You know...

1330
01:45:12,173 --> 01:45:17,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I don't, I'm really distressed about the trip, and yeah, but, you know, what can you do?

1331
01:45:19,155 --> 01:45:28,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to the fact that I'm going to miss all the good TV shows while I'm gone, because I do watch all my TV through BitTorrent, and I'm not going to be able to do that while I'm out.

1332
01:45:28,477 --> 01:45:34,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to the fact that I wasn't able to get a laptop for my trip, so I will have absolutely nothing to do at night, except masturbate.

1333
01:45:34,898 --> 01:45:37,879
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's alright, because I'm going to get a lot of that done, so...

1334
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:43,726
[SPEAKER_04]: But Aaron, I can safely say I won't be thinking of you when I do it.

1335
01:45:46,108 --> 01:45:49,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So allow me to be the first CDR male to tell you that.

1336
01:45:49,431 --> 01:45:51,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not be thinking of you when I masturbate.

1337
01:45:51,353 --> 01:45:53,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sometimes I wish Loki was my Doug 24-7.

1338
01:46:05,376 --> 01:46:07,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be thinking of that comment right there, yeah.

1339
01:46:07,878 --> 01:46:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.

1340
01:46:12,802 --> 01:46:14,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing you didn't hear it, DarkSakura.

1341
01:46:15,304 --> 01:46:19,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had other FUs, but I forget what they were, so I guess we'll just move on.

1342
01:46:25,432 --> 01:46:25,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it.

1343
01:46:26,073 --> 01:46:26,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1344
01:46:27,854 --> 01:46:30,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear from other folks in our studio right now.

1345
01:46:30,156 --> 01:46:32,398
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with ViolentHyperGirl.

1346
01:46:33,839 --> 01:46:34,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi!

1347
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:34,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1348
01:46:35,482 --> 01:46:40,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, F you to the stupid fanboys who publicly post on forums saying they want to have sex with me.

1349
01:46:40,924 --> 01:46:41,524
[SPEAKER_06]: PLEASE!

1350
01:46:41,704 --> 01:46:42,765
[SPEAKER_06]: KEEP IT TO YOURSELF!

1351
01:46:42,825 --> 01:46:45,006
[SPEAKER_06]: IT'S A FUCKING PUBLIC FORUM!

1352
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:46,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus.

1353
01:46:47,307 --> 01:46:48,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Desperate people.

1354
01:46:49,688 --> 01:46:53,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, if you want sex that badly, go find a whore!

1355
01:46:57,110 --> 01:46:59,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Or go masturbate or something!

1356
01:46:59,511 --> 01:47:00,872
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to my routine!

1357
01:47:07,996 --> 01:47:12,838
[SPEAKER_06]: My CBDL routine does not constitute as porn or masturbation fodder.

1358
01:47:15,219 --> 01:47:22,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It should actually be illegal because I was under 18 at the time.

1359
01:47:22,522 --> 01:47:23,482
Pedophiles!

1360
01:47:27,164 --> 01:47:30,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Second F you goes to Audio Taco at AX.

1361
01:47:30,765 --> 01:47:31,505
[SPEAKER_06]: You smell.

1362
01:47:31,825 --> 01:47:32,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Please shower.

1363
01:47:34,313 --> 01:47:42,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't kill you to take like 10 minutes out of the day to shower, okay?

1364
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:45,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why people go to cons, is to not shower.

1365
01:47:46,623 --> 01:47:49,645
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about the lobby boys, the ones who sleep in the lobby, right?

1366
01:47:51,667 --> 01:47:53,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even the people with hotel rooms, I mean like...

1367
01:47:55,310 --> 01:48:00,994
[SPEAKER_06]: For those who didn't hear Jamie's comment, she said, it's Anime Expo, what are they going to miss?

1368
01:48:01,034 --> 01:48:01,555
[SPEAKER_06]: The sucking?

1369
01:48:20,017 --> 01:48:25,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, you have no chance with any girl, Japanese or Asian or white.

1370
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,281
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't fucking shower.

1371
01:48:29,001 --> 01:48:32,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you know, you might raise your chances just a little bit.

1372
01:48:32,623 --> 01:48:33,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little fucking bit.

1373
01:48:34,704 --> 01:48:37,365
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, now, last fan of Akana, I saw boob.

1374
01:48:39,646 --> 01:48:40,867
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that from?

1375
01:48:41,007 --> 01:48:44,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Real boob, not fake boob, not drawn boob, real boob.

1376
01:48:44,709 --> 01:48:45,969
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that from?

1377
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:46,750
[SPEAKER_13]: My boob.

1378
01:48:48,339 --> 01:48:50,841
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that from the fat Mai that was walking around?

1379
01:48:57,905 --> 01:49:00,447
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, please, don't suffocate us.

1380
01:49:03,169 --> 01:49:06,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Another SU goes out to physics, for obvious reasons.

1381
01:49:06,251 --> 01:49:07,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to really state why.

1382
01:49:08,993 --> 01:49:10,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just physics.

1383
01:49:11,695 --> 01:49:18,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Another SU goes out to being sick, but I honestly kind of don't care because I was helping out a friend who was sick.

1384
01:49:19,957 --> 01:49:25,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I knew what I was putting myself out in front of, so I kind of accepted the responsibility for getting myself picked.

1385
01:49:26,983 --> 01:49:27,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1386
01:49:30,246 --> 01:49:40,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, let's see, I can't really think of anything else other than the fanboy issue, which I could go off on for hours and hours at a time.

1387
01:49:41,715 --> 01:49:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but, uh, yeah, I think we can move on.

1388
01:49:48,937 --> 01:49:49,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, Jonas.

1389
01:49:49,918 --> 01:49:52,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, let me touch the car first.

1390
01:49:56,917 --> 01:49:59,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm sorry about that, I'm sorry about that.

1391
01:49:59,579 --> 01:50:07,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the first F he goes to in Zuma of 469 for almost screwing my tournament up in June 25th and the 26th.

1392
01:50:08,343 --> 01:50:10,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Who the hell do you think you are trying to control my tournament?

1393
01:50:11,465 --> 01:50:14,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Who the hell do you think you are saying, ooh, the pet detailer doesn't work?

1394
01:50:15,567 --> 01:50:18,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, get used to the fucking pads.

1395
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:22,771
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the best damn pads out there in Sacramento, in case you haven't been there, Sky.

1396
01:50:23,812 --> 01:50:24,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't.

1397
01:50:25,203 --> 01:50:25,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1398
01:50:27,664 --> 01:50:32,827
[SPEAKER_13]: And quit your whining about for one and a half hours you delayed the whole tournament.

1399
01:50:32,867 --> 01:50:34,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone was bitching at me.

1400
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:39,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Those pads are so squeaky clean that I can see Aaron's image in them.

1401
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:40,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

1402
01:50:41,091 --> 01:50:41,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

1403
01:50:42,711 --> 01:50:43,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, right there.

1404
01:50:43,652 --> 01:50:43,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.

1405
01:50:43,972 --> 01:50:47,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jonas.

1406
01:50:52,680 --> 01:51:01,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the next interview goes to this bitch at work, well not, well it says some bitch customer, who's saying, OI!

1407
01:51:01,444 --> 01:51:08,588
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a freakin', I'm a good woman and you're just a fuckin' worker just getting minimum wage.

1408
01:51:08,788 --> 01:51:12,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Who the fuck do you think you are calling me a low-class person?

1409
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:19,933
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, second of all, we kicked everybody out of the track because, this is during my previous island as I worked there, this,

1410
01:51:20,666 --> 01:51:22,527
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, your kids can't drive for shit.

1411
01:51:22,547 --> 01:51:23,888
[SPEAKER_13]: This has no bumping.

1412
01:51:24,589 --> 01:51:26,650
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're accusing my ass trying to get me fired?

1413
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:28,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, fuck you.

1414
01:51:30,293 --> 01:51:32,495
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm gonna kick your ass if I have the chance.

1415
01:51:32,515 --> 01:51:36,278
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a whip on my car, all spiked up in braids.

1416
01:51:37,999 --> 01:51:39,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it have braids, Aaron?

1417
01:51:41,722 --> 01:51:42,502
[SPEAKER_13]: They could, eh?

1418
01:51:42,862 --> 01:51:43,543
[SPEAKER_13]: How long is the whip?

1419
01:51:46,448 --> 01:51:46,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn!

1420
01:51:47,589 --> 01:51:56,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and I'll give another F you guys to someone who spiked up my freakin' strawberry daiquiri drink.

1421
01:51:57,255 --> 01:52:02,479
[SPEAKER_13]: You put a hell of vodka in it!

1422
01:52:02,499 --> 01:52:07,142
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I mean, there's no strawberry daiquiri in it, they put like some nasty type of vodka in it.

1423
01:52:07,522 --> 01:52:11,384
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's kind of, it's not the Smirnoff version, it's like some other vodka.

1424
01:52:11,404 --> 01:52:15,187
[SPEAKER_13]: I accidentally spit that out in front of my parents and stuff.

1425
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:29,808
[SPEAKER_13]: while eating a delicate dinner during the cruise and I see to my skin because when one side is hella dark and the other is hella white no matter how many times I go to the pool it still remains the same thing oh really?

1426
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:34,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm kind of heated up a little bit.

1427
01:52:36,303 --> 01:52:40,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, FU for time being wasted for my other FUs.

1428
01:52:40,365 --> 01:52:41,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll continue the FUs next week.

1429
01:52:41,986 --> 01:52:42,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Puppy.

1430
01:52:43,307 --> 01:52:44,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I said two weeks, two weeks, sorry.

1431
01:52:44,587 --> 01:52:46,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't forget next week won't be here.

1432
01:52:48,049 --> 01:52:48,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy.

1433
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:49,130
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1434
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:51,551
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, since time is short, I'll make this quick.

1435
01:52:52,912 --> 01:53:01,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck school, fuck my car, fuck funerals, fuck the funeral across the street, fuck the number zero when it's alone, and, um,

1436
01:53:03,255 --> 01:53:06,499
[SPEAKER_24]: Suck the mold, and fuck my refrigerator.

1437
01:53:06,599 --> 01:53:06,899
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all.

1438
01:53:06,919 --> 01:53:10,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get to our chatroom FUs then.

1439
01:53:10,823 --> 01:53:11,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1440
01:53:12,084 --> 01:53:13,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Started off with Dark Knight.

1441
01:53:14,487 --> 01:53:18,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says, let me start with a big FU, and that's for my car to go kerplunk on me.

1442
01:53:19,072 --> 01:53:21,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Ended up having to catch a ride to work for the weekend.

1443
01:53:21,554 --> 01:53:25,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Another for being a broke-ass mofo, and finally work, that is all.

1444
01:53:27,951 --> 01:53:31,732
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Angel says, F you to Skype for freezing while trying to run on my system.

1445
01:53:32,252 --> 01:53:37,093
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to QRO for giving me sprite errors and other continuous errors spontaneously while I'm trying to play.

1446
01:53:38,413 --> 01:53:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play.

1447
01:53:39,793 --> 01:53:43,294
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to feeling like I'm fully packed but then thinking I'm still going to forget something.

1448
01:53:43,354 --> 01:53:44,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Meh, I guess I'm done.

1449
01:53:44,514 --> 01:53:48,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can sympathize with thinking you're packed when you're not because I'm having that same problem right now.

1450
01:53:50,415 --> 01:53:52,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Vid Palace says, F you to this horrible retainer.

1451
01:53:53,016 --> 01:53:55,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say anything coherently when I have it on.

1452
01:53:55,865 --> 01:53:56,425
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1453
01:53:56,545 --> 01:53:56,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad.

1454
01:53:57,026 --> 01:53:57,786
[SPEAKER_06]: You had braces.

1455
01:53:57,926 --> 01:53:58,887
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the retainer now.

1456
01:53:59,327 --> 01:54:00,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Deal with it.

1457
01:54:00,247 --> 01:54:01,028
[SPEAKER_06]: We all had to.

1458
01:54:01,428 --> 01:54:01,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1459
01:54:02,028 --> 01:54:02,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw it.

1460
01:54:02,449 --> 01:54:04,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I stopped wearing my retainer after three months.

1461
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:05,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at me now.

1462
01:54:07,952 --> 01:54:09,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I got all three of my teeth.

1463
01:54:12,114 --> 01:54:15,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Flerone says, F you to the official PS2 headset.

1464
01:54:15,395 --> 01:54:18,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I got Karaoke Revolution this weekend and the headphones are crappy.

1465
01:54:18,917 --> 01:54:21,659
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox headset is actually decently sturdy.

1466
01:54:24,215 --> 01:54:28,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually thought the KR one was a little better, but, you know, potato potato.

1467
01:54:28,919 --> 01:54:31,220
[SPEAKER_04]: VXJasonXV says, my one and only FU.

1468
01:54:31,701 --> 01:54:38,506
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to people who show up almost an hour after the tournament was scheduled to start and starting about one and a quarter hours late.

1469
01:54:39,086 --> 01:54:40,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Rychan is passing one along too.

1470
01:54:41,128 --> 01:54:44,250
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to other girls who repeatedly try to hang all over your boyfriend.

1471
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:46,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more so when it's right in front of you.

1472
01:54:47,713 --> 01:54:54,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Then that's when, you know, you just take your hand and ask them what the five fingers said to the face

1473
01:54:55,748 --> 01:54:56,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hot.

1474
01:54:58,029 --> 01:55:01,670
[SPEAKER_04]: EvilNowQ2DX says, F you to Noria for singing Sylvia Drive.

1475
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:03,871
[SPEAKER_04]: That song's been in my head for the past four days.

1476
01:55:04,591 --> 01:55:07,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and one F you to commercials before movies.

1477
01:55:08,113 --> 01:55:08,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1478
01:55:09,293 --> 01:55:09,733
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the 20.

1479
01:55:10,773 --> 01:55:11,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that shit.

1480
01:55:13,374 --> 01:55:14,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the 20.

1481
01:55:16,295 --> 01:55:17,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I got 20 for you right here.

1482
01:55:18,389 --> 01:55:22,611
[SPEAKER_04]: John Field says, I guess my only FU is that connection was too short.

1483
01:55:23,272 --> 01:55:31,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and FU to claiming that Mega Man Anniversary Collection has remixed music when all it's using are the music tracks from Power Fighters slash Battles.

1484
01:55:31,195 --> 01:55:32,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, interesting.

1485
01:55:33,196 --> 01:55:33,897
[SPEAKER_24]: It does have remixed music.

1486
01:55:34,397 --> 01:55:36,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was the overclocked one.

1487
01:55:36,318 --> 01:55:37,559
[SPEAKER_24]: There was a bunch of remixes.

1488
01:55:37,619 --> 01:55:39,580
[SPEAKER_24]: If you change it to Navi mode, it's all remixed music.

1489
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:41,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1490
01:55:43,826 --> 01:55:45,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's all the FUs right now.

1491
01:55:46,128 --> 01:55:49,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks wanted to comment on some convention things you were talking about, Aaron.

1492
01:55:50,011 --> 01:55:53,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to open the Skype line back up since we only have a few minutes left in the show anyway.

1493
01:55:54,135 --> 01:55:56,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some folks have comments on who knows what else.

1494
01:55:57,558 --> 01:56:00,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to kind of finish up the show with a little bit of that.

1495
01:56:01,801 --> 01:56:03,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think there was some Anime Expo commentaries.

1496
01:56:04,063 --> 01:56:05,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody wanted to add.

1497
01:56:06,485 --> 01:56:10,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only ever been to like one anime convention in my entire life.

1498
01:56:10,609 --> 01:56:10,909
[SPEAKER_24]: Ditto.

1499
01:56:12,179 --> 01:56:13,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't Anime Expo, it was a little one.

1500
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:14,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here it is.

1501
01:56:14,601 --> 01:56:15,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Richie.

1502
01:56:15,221 --> 01:56:17,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Richie wants to... Richie's back on the Skype line.

1503
01:56:17,983 --> 01:56:22,607
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to talk to us about an Anime Expo story I think that Aaron brought up.

1504
01:56:22,667 --> 01:56:23,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's up, Richie?

1505
01:56:25,069 --> 01:56:26,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, nothing much.

1506
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:30,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a couple of horror stories from AnimeCon this year.

1507
01:56:30,073 --> 01:56:37,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... Well, yeah, just... Okay, what do you want to tell us about?

1508
01:56:38,339 --> 01:56:38,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1509
01:56:40,171 --> 01:56:42,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, buddy, hey, buddy, you're skipping up a little bit there.

1510
01:56:44,294 --> 01:56:46,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop your torrents and stop your Winamp for a second.

1511
01:56:46,795 --> 01:56:47,296
[SPEAKER_04]: See if that helps.

1512
01:56:47,336 --> 01:56:49,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the hell's wrong with my connection.

1513
01:56:49,217 --> 01:56:49,517
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1514
01:56:50,058 --> 01:56:50,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you now.

1515
01:56:50,818 --> 01:56:51,138
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1516
01:56:51,278 --> 01:56:51,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1517
01:56:51,999 --> 01:56:58,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just want to say that, yeah, a lot of the guys there didn't know what the hell the concept of a shower meant, so it stinks like high heaven over there.

1518
01:56:58,483 --> 01:57:01,545
[SPEAKER_09]: At least my roommates still were like... Sorry.

1519
01:57:01,585 --> 01:57:02,326
[SPEAKER_09]: ...every day and stuff.

1520
01:57:02,346 --> 01:57:02,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry about it.

1521
01:57:03,701 --> 01:57:09,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And other than that, well, other than, you know, like, stinky idiots, you get drunken idiots, too, who ruin everything.

1522
01:57:09,904 --> 01:57:18,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you heard about this, but, uh, on Saturday night, Sunday morning, we had to close down the convention center, because, uh... I was there, that, I was there.

1523
01:57:18,767 --> 01:57:20,888
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the toilet, didn't you remember what happened, right?

1524
01:57:21,028 --> 01:57:30,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, somebody, somebody, what happened that night, for people who don't know, um, in the arcade, in, uh, the Fanime 2004 convention, somebody decided to, like, blow up the toilet.

1525
01:57:31,710 --> 01:58:00,332
[SPEAKER_06]: and ended up flooding that whole second floor of the convention center so they had to close the arcade down which is like almost the only thing to do in the middle of the night save for like the video rooms yeah and uh if I can add to that I was staffing the arcade during that shift so like they had me pull they had me pull con security you remember you remember how tired I looked Erin yeah they took all the arcade um workers and uh what they did was that they made them work security to make sure nobody went into the upper area

1526
01:58:01,718 --> 01:58:03,139
[SPEAKER_09]: and you saw how tired I was.

1527
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:07,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I was up listening to Nami Tamaki for like how many hours straight.

1528
01:58:07,681 --> 01:58:13,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, actually at Fatime too, they played the same Nami Tamaki CD for all four days.

1529
01:58:13,845 --> 01:58:14,645
[SPEAKER_09]: All four days.

1530
01:58:14,725 --> 01:58:15,225
[SPEAKER_09]: It was hell.

1531
01:58:15,305 --> 01:58:17,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I was starting to sing along to it.

1532
01:58:18,047 --> 01:58:19,028
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crazy.

1533
01:58:19,048 --> 01:58:21,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that though...

1534
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:30,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and if I could put in a plug for another con that's coming up, Chinatown Anime Fair in San Francisco is coming up September 11th and 12th.

1535
01:58:31,567 --> 01:58:32,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten bucks to be registered.

1536
01:58:33,208 --> 01:58:36,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Go over to JTAF.com to pre-reg.

1537
01:58:36,231 --> 01:58:38,372
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be pretty cool.

01:58:40,414 --> 01:58:41,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out the site.

1539
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:44,217
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a few guests of honor you might want to check out.

1540
01:58:45,038 --> 01:58:45,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And hope to see you all there.

1541
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:48,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

1542
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:49,641
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to get going, Richie, but thanks for the call.

1543
01:58:49,961 --> 01:58:50,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no problem.

1544
01:58:50,602 --> 01:58:51,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll see you guys later.

1545
01:58:51,403 --> 01:58:51,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, bud.

1546
01:58:52,577 --> 01:58:55,340
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that's about it.

1547
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,801
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to start wrapping up the show here.

1548
01:58:57,041 --> 01:59:00,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Jonas.

1549
01:59:04,328 --> 01:59:05,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Erin.

1550
01:59:06,389 --> 01:59:16,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, the thing, oh, I just wanted to add one thing that really, really sucked about Anime Expo was that I guess since the con's been held there for so long,

1551
01:59:17,834 --> 01:59:22,517
[SPEAKER_06]: They well knew about the BO, so what they did was they turned the AC on really, really high.

1552
01:59:23,217 --> 01:59:28,521
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you walked through the convention center at night, it was at least 65 degrees in there, if not lower.

1553
01:59:30,602 --> 01:59:31,383
[SPEAKER_24]: No sweat, no BO.

1554
01:59:31,443 --> 01:59:32,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thought from Puppy.

1555
01:59:34,745 --> 01:59:38,887
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, Loki's cock really is big, isn't it?

1556
01:59:38,947 --> 01:59:41,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonas, do or die, final thought.

1557
01:59:41,189 --> 01:59:42,210
[SPEAKER_13]: It tastes very good, too.

1558
01:59:45,231 --> 01:59:45,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, final thought.

1559
01:59:46,952 --> 01:59:49,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking that cock back to work and I'm leaving it there.

1560
01:59:53,975 --> 01:59:57,296
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is listen to the Bomani Music and More program.

1561
01:59:57,316 --> 02:00:02,478
[SPEAKER_04]: We need people to whore up our listening hours because our ratings have been dropping and that makes me sad.

1562
02:00:03,839 --> 02:00:04,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, final thought?

1563
02:00:05,060 --> 02:00:06,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Tastes great, less filling.

1564
02:00:08,345 --> 02:00:09,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Last word of the show.

1565
02:00:09,547 --> 02:00:11,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Erin really wants it, so why not?

1566
02:00:12,531 --> 02:00:14,614
[SPEAKER_04]: One word that sums it all up.

1567
02:00:15,235 --> 02:00:17,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Erin, what is tonight's... Well, hold on.

1568
02:00:17,618 --> 02:00:19,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to make sure our outro is ready to go.

1569
02:00:19,401 --> 02:00:22,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Erin, what is tonight's final word?

1570
02:00:22,906 --> 02:00:23,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Movies!

1571
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:28,361
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1572
02:00:28,922 --> 02:00:32,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1573
02:00:32,865 --> 02:00:38,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

1574
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:44,755
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

1575
02:00:45,375 --> 02:00:48,838
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1576
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:51,661
[SPEAKER_19]: I have not had sex in almost two years.

1577
02:00:52,896 --> 02:00:55,837
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think once you hit two years, you automatically get your virginity back.

1578
02:00:58,158 --> 02:00:59,078
[SPEAKER_19]: You get to start over.

1579
02:00:59,499 --> 02:01:00,159
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm about to.

1580
02:01:00,299 --> 02:01:01,319
[SPEAKER_19]: What is wrong with me?

1581
02:01:01,399 --> 02:01:02,280
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't understand.

1582
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:06,842
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just going to have to trick somebody into doing it.

1583
02:01:09,302 --> 02:01:10,163
[SPEAKER_19]: Use trickery.

1584
02:01:12,684 --> 02:01:15,505
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to have to cover with leaves and hope somebody falls in.

1585
02:01:29,056 --> 02:01:30,317
[SPEAKER_19]: That's going to be the only way!

1586
02:01:32,458 --> 02:01:34,460
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I would be really hot if I didn't talk.

1587
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:35,340
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my problem.

1588
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,582
[SPEAKER_19]: I just have a big mouth and I just say the wrong things.

1589
02:01:37,682 --> 02:01:38,823
[SPEAKER_19]: But, I don't know.

1590
02:01:39,323 --> 02:01:40,004
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, it's weird.

1591
02:01:40,044 --> 02:01:40,564
[SPEAKER_19]: I try.

1592
02:01:40,744 --> 02:01:43,086
[SPEAKER_19]: I have one pickup line, which never works.

1593
02:01:43,366 --> 02:01:43,987
[SPEAKER_19]: This is what I do.

1594
02:01:44,327 --> 02:01:46,809
[SPEAKER_19]: If I'm at a club and I see a guy that I like, I'll smile.

1595
02:01:46,929 --> 02:01:48,510
[SPEAKER_19]: And if he smiles back, I feel comfortable.

1596
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:53,133
[SPEAKER_19]: And when I feel really comfortable, I'll walk over and I'll say, Stick it in!

1597
02:02:06,781 --> 02:02:09,802
[SPEAKER_19]: So, as you know by now, I'm Korean.

1598
02:02:11,123 --> 02:02:12,524
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have a store or anything.

1599
02:02:22,368 --> 02:02:23,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, not anymore.

1600
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:27,890
[SPEAKER_19]: I look very Korean.

1601
02:02:27,910 --> 02:02:29,531
[SPEAKER_19]: I have very typically Korean features.

1602
02:02:29,591 --> 02:02:33,573
[SPEAKER_19]: I look like one of those girls that you would see in a Korean grocery store on a calendar.

1603
02:02:35,228 --> 02:02:36,829
[SPEAKER_19]: Holding a box of soy milk.

1604
02:02:41,392 --> 02:02:42,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Drink by the soy.

1605
02:02:42,432 --> 02:02:43,533
[SPEAKER_17]: It's good for you.

1606
02:02:53,078 --> 02:02:53,979
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a Korean name.

1607
02:02:54,179 --> 02:02:59,962
[SPEAKER_19]: My Korean name is Moran, which is a pretty name, but you have to understand I've heard my mother scream it from across the hills.

1608
02:03:00,783 --> 02:03:01,123
[SPEAKER_19]: Moran!

1609
02:03:05,396 --> 02:03:06,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Moran!

1610
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:09,180
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

1611
02:03:11,482 --> 02:03:12,543
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure you can relate.

1612
02:03:14,325 --> 02:03:25,437
[SPEAKER_19]: When I get famous enough, I want to have my own fragrance and have it be called Moran and have the ads be old Asian women coming out of French doors like in the Ego East ad.

1613
02:03:27,319 --> 02:03:27,539
[SPEAKER_19]: Moran!

1614
02:03:36,423 --> 02:03:37,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't you think that's sexy?

1615
02:03:37,604 --> 02:03:39,686
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, it's so hot.

1616
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:46,972
[SPEAKER_19]: My mother is convinced that everybody in show business does drugs.

1617
02:03:48,033 --> 02:03:51,176
[SPEAKER_19]: She's like, oh, you cannot go to the club because they take the drugs.

1618
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:57,902
[SPEAKER_19]: The people, they take the cocaine.

1619
02:03:59,363 --> 02:04:01,786
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they take the D, what is it, the D, the L, the D, the D.

1620
02:04:03,070 --> 02:04:04,111
[SPEAKER_19]: Mom, it's LSD.

1621
02:04:04,371 --> 02:04:05,071
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you know that?

1622
02:04:13,055 --> 02:04:15,316
[SPEAKER_19]: My mother has a problem with blind intersections.

1623
02:04:15,376 --> 02:04:18,318
[SPEAKER_19]: She will sit there for a very long time and rant.

1624
02:04:18,838 --> 02:04:20,519
[SPEAKER_15]: They never give you a chance!

1625
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:41,761
[SPEAKER_19]: So since I was about 10 years old, almost all of my friends have been gay men.

1626
02:04:43,161 --> 02:04:47,422
[SPEAKER_19]: And my mother would give me phone messages from them when they would call me when I lived at home.

1627
02:04:49,142 --> 02:04:51,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Scott called.

1628
02:04:53,723 --> 02:04:54,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Is he the gay?

1629
02:04:55,063 --> 02:04:56,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Is he the gay?

1630
02:04:59,969 --> 02:05:02,191
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, godmom, I don't know if he's THE gay.

1631
02:05:04,854 --> 02:05:06,896
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a lot of pressure to be THE gay.

1632
02:05:08,558 --> 02:05:09,919
[SPEAKER_19]: All of that resting on one guy.

1633
02:05:12,502 --> 02:05:15,545
[SPEAKER_19]: He has to do the parade all by himself.

1634
02:05:25,766 --> 02:05:26,427
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here!

1635
02:05:26,947 --> 02:05:27,788
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm queer!

1636
02:05:29,889 --> 02:05:30,910
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I'm the only one.

1637
02:05:35,113 --> 02:05:38,476
[SPEAKER_19]: My parents are very conservative, but surprisingly gay positive.

1638
02:05:38,816 --> 02:05:43,480
[SPEAKER_19]: In the late 70s, we owned a bookstore in San Francisco on Polk Street, which then was a huge gay mecca.

1639
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:47,362
[SPEAKER_19]: And my mother, for some reason, was in charge of the gay pornography section.

1640
02:05:53,214 --> 02:05:56,983
[SPEAKER_19]: So every day as we walk over there, I don't know why we have this booth!

1641
02:06:16,303 --> 02:06:22,785
[SPEAKER_19]: The most harrowing experience I ever had with my mother was one time I wanted to go see this movie with my friends and she would not let me go with my friends.

1642
02:06:22,825 --> 02:06:23,525
[SPEAKER_19]: She had to come with me.

1643
02:06:24,005 --> 02:06:28,326
[SPEAKER_19]: So I had to go see The Wall with my mom.

1644
02:06:30,447 --> 02:06:33,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Halfway through the movie, somebody actually passed her a joint.

1645
02:06:36,749 --> 02:06:37,529
[SPEAKER_17]: What is this?

1646
02:06:37,949 --> 02:06:40,730
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why they give this to me.

1647
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:42,170
[SPEAKER_17]: That's so... I... I...

1648
02:06:59,028 --> 02:07:02,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

1649
02:07:03,391 --> 02:07:10,756
That's what I would play for anybody who wants to know what Margaret Cho is all about because that just sums it all up right in there.

1650
02:07:28,877 --> 02:07:32,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we are in the afterbirth, and we'll open up the Skype line for any calls.

1651
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:36,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there were a couple people that missed the chance to call during the show, so we'll give them a chance right now if they want to call in.

1652
02:07:36,724 --> 02:07:37,244
[SPEAKER_07]: But guess what?

1653
02:07:37,284 --> 02:07:38,005
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't talk to me.

1654
02:07:38,045 --> 02:07:38,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1655
02:07:38,845 --> 02:07:39,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, why?

1656
02:07:39,086 --> 02:07:39,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You leaving?

1657
02:07:39,526 --> 02:07:39,886
I'm leaving.

1658
02:07:40,126 --> 02:07:40,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye, Jamie.

1659
02:07:40,907 --> 02:07:41,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1660
02:07:41,487 --> 02:07:42,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming, of course, as always.

1661
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:47,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Studio Dark... I feel a little warm.

1662
02:07:47,412 --> 02:07:50,175
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be in Studio Dark Sakura next week, right?

1663
02:07:50,275 --> 02:07:51,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up, Rob.

1664
02:07:52,156 --> 02:07:54,859
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can fit people in there, because there's a bunch of boxes.

1665
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:57,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's got a lot of boxes.

1666
02:07:58,442 --> 02:08:04,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we've been, we had to take all of the boxes out of Dan's mom's garage when she moved.

1667
02:08:04,585 --> 02:08:04,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

1668
02:08:05,005 --> 02:08:06,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have them all piled up in the upstairs room.

1669
02:08:07,226 --> 02:08:10,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And the downstairs is taken up by pole position cabinets for the main machine.

1670
02:08:11,388 --> 02:08:11,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

1671
02:08:11,708 --> 02:08:13,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we'll have to be creative.

1672
02:08:13,369 --> 02:08:16,871
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to have to sit on boxes and sit on the floor, but we'll be able to do it.

1673
02:08:17,071 --> 02:08:18,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm going to miss everybody next week.

1674
02:08:18,792 --> 02:08:20,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll miss you too, but my aim's improving.

1675
02:08:20,753 --> 02:08:21,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1676
02:08:22,693 --> 02:08:24,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had Skype in Pennsylvania.

1677
02:08:24,994 --> 02:08:27,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not that you've got the Skype thing set up, but we'll get it set up sometime.

1678
02:08:27,775 --> 02:08:31,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Not on the show, but I can't get it to work with the broadcaster I use.

1679
02:08:31,436 --> 02:08:33,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the only reason we can do it now is because I'm using a different broadcaster.

1680
02:08:33,977 --> 02:08:35,217
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to show me how to do that.

1681
02:08:35,257 --> 02:08:37,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have to work that out someday.

1682
02:08:37,718 --> 02:08:41,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the other broadcaster because I can talk over music where my sound card doesn't normally let me do that.

1683
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid piece of crap, Vio.

1684
02:08:45,601 --> 02:08:46,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm going.

1685
02:08:46,261 --> 02:08:46,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1686
02:08:46,735 --> 02:08:47,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye!

1687
02:08:47,535 --> 02:08:47,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one!

1688
02:09:10,936 --> 02:09:12,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey Sky, this is John Fields.

1689
02:09:12,697 --> 02:09:13,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up?

1690
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:14,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much.

1691
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:18,122
I'd just like to say a couple of words.

1692
02:09:18,202 --> 02:09:19,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to my first... Alright, that's it.

1693
02:09:20,024 --> 02:09:20,684
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a couple of words.

1694
02:09:20,804 --> 02:09:21,285
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

1695
02:09:21,345 --> 02:09:21,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

1696
02:09:21,685 --> 02:09:22,005
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1697
02:09:24,047 --> 02:09:26,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to my first anime convention this weekend, actually.

1698
02:09:27,230 --> 02:09:29,351
[SPEAKER_11]: It was held right on my campus, actually.

1699
02:09:30,592 --> 02:09:30,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1700
02:09:31,653 --> 02:09:32,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was that all about?

1701
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:41,896
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Kineticon, and it was a really fun experience, but I think I kind of blew it on the anime, because I really didn't actually go to see any screenings.

1702
02:09:41,976 --> 02:09:44,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I was stuck playing video games the whole time.

1703
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:47,401
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of video games were going on there?

1704
02:09:48,641 --> 02:09:51,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually got to play Papa Music for the first time there.

1705
02:09:53,625 --> 02:09:54,266
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you like it?

1706
02:09:54,846 --> 02:09:56,027
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a very fun game.

1707
02:09:56,167 --> 02:10:01,271
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes me want to pick up the controller and play it at home or something like that.

1708
02:10:01,849 --> 02:10:02,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun game to have.

1709
02:10:02,870 --> 02:10:03,411
[SPEAKER_04]: You should pick it up.

1710
02:10:04,653 --> 02:10:05,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thanks for calling.

1711
02:10:05,554 --> 02:10:05,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1712
02:10:07,156 --> 02:10:08,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Call during the show sometime.

1713
02:10:08,798 --> 02:10:09,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, no problem.

1714
02:10:09,859 --> 02:10:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1715
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:14,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We missed a call in there.

1716
02:10:14,102 --> 02:10:17,364
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no call waiting.

1717
02:10:17,384 --> 02:10:20,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's no call waiting or anything and I can't conference thing or anything.

1718
02:10:20,346 --> 02:10:24,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to remember to put it back in Do Not Disturb or else everybody will call at once.

1719
02:10:25,330 --> 02:10:26,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is of course what always happens.

1720
02:10:26,831 --> 02:10:28,172
[SPEAKER_04]: You sit there and you wait forever.

1721
02:10:29,332 --> 02:10:35,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember guys, if you want to call, just get on the Skype line and give us a call and then everybody will call at once.

1722
02:10:36,818 --> 02:10:37,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

1723
02:10:37,802 --> 02:10:38,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well, what can you do?

1724
02:10:39,543 --> 02:10:44,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave it up in a few more minutes, and then I'm going to pull the plug for... We got the time.

1725
02:10:45,565 --> 02:10:45,885
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1726
02:10:46,885 --> 02:10:48,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished the wiring on my main cabinet.

1727
02:10:50,566 --> 02:10:54,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning, all I got to do is plug shit together, and we'll be good to go.

1728
02:10:56,208 --> 02:10:57,268
[SPEAKER_24]: And the TV, and yeah.

1729
02:10:59,029 --> 02:11:02,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I think we are going to... Oh, here comes another call.

1730
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:04,731
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

1731
02:11:05,882 --> 02:11:06,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1732
02:11:06,462 --> 02:11:06,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1733
02:11:06,782 --> 02:11:07,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Ton!

1734
02:11:07,742 --> 02:11:08,022
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh no.

1735
02:11:08,783 --> 02:11:09,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey?

1736
02:11:09,023 --> 02:11:09,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

1737
02:11:10,263 --> 02:11:10,583
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1738
02:11:10,623 --> 02:11:11,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1739
02:11:12,183 --> 02:11:12,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, hi.

1740
02:11:13,763 --> 02:11:14,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1741
02:11:15,624 --> 02:11:16,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, crap.

1742
02:11:16,624 --> 02:11:16,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1743
02:11:17,284 --> 02:11:21,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, first rule of radio, turn down the radio when you're on the radio.

1744
02:11:22,285 --> 02:11:22,745
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

1745
02:11:22,965 --> 02:11:23,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, oops.

1746
02:11:23,945 --> 02:11:24,545
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all learning.

1747
02:11:24,585 --> 02:11:26,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's amateur radio on our end.

1748
02:11:26,626 --> 02:11:27,926
[SPEAKER_04]: We expect it to be on your end too.

1749
02:11:27,966 --> 02:11:28,326
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1750
02:11:29,246 --> 02:11:29,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Eh, nothing much.

1751
02:11:30,026 --> 02:11:31,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Just wanted to say hi.

1752
02:11:31,166 --> 02:11:31,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is this?

1753
02:11:32,607 --> 02:11:33,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Ton Dork.

1754
02:11:34,841 --> 02:11:35,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Dork!

1755
02:11:35,562 --> 02:11:36,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Dork.

1756
02:11:36,883 --> 02:11:43,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, the Skype doesn't let me type four characters in my name, so I had to type Mr. Urkel, which is my LJ name.

1757
02:11:44,969 --> 02:11:46,090
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good name, though.

1758
02:11:46,110 --> 02:11:47,191
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a dork.

1759
02:11:47,431 --> 02:11:47,791
[SPEAKER_24]: It fits.

1760
02:11:48,512 --> 02:11:49,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it fits.

1761
02:11:49,473 --> 02:11:49,813
[SPEAKER_24]: It works.

1762
02:11:49,833 --> 02:11:50,474
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, well, hey.

1763
02:11:50,934 --> 02:11:51,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's up?

1764
02:11:51,314 --> 02:11:53,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a comment on anything for tonight's show or anything?

1765
02:11:54,617 --> 02:11:55,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

1766
02:11:55,958 --> 02:11:59,401
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to ask Puppy how he thinks of Destiny.

1767
02:11:59,441 --> 02:12:00,582
[SPEAKER_24]: You're asking me that again?

1768
02:12:01,461 --> 02:12:02,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, you requested it.

1769
02:12:03,262 --> 02:12:03,963
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I didn't.

1770
02:12:04,303 --> 02:12:05,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you did.

1771
02:12:05,243 --> 02:12:06,704
[SPEAKER_12]: She specifically said that.

1772
02:12:07,705 --> 02:12:08,665
[SPEAKER_12]: When did she say that?

1773
02:12:09,706 --> 02:12:11,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Check her last LJ post.

1774
02:12:13,048 --> 02:12:14,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, LJ drama.

1775
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:18,371
[SPEAKER_24]: One of our friends.

1776
02:12:20,912 --> 02:12:21,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, LJ drama.

1777
02:12:21,773 --> 02:12:22,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a good chance.

1778
02:12:22,733 --> 02:12:25,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there's a good segue for me to plug the LiveJournal.

1779
02:12:25,956 --> 02:12:27,477
[SPEAKER_04]: LiveJournal Community, Orange Lounge.

1780
02:12:27,678 --> 02:12:28,518
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word right there.

1781
02:12:28,919 --> 02:12:31,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And no drama on our community, unfortunately.

1782
02:12:31,861 --> 02:12:37,947
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at the friends page with all our members, you can get plenty of drama from all their journals.

1783
02:12:38,087 --> 02:12:38,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fabulous.

1784
02:12:39,408 --> 02:12:42,090
[SPEAKER_24]: It's really good for killing time to read up on LiveJournal drama.

1785
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:42,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1786
02:12:44,012 --> 02:12:44,392
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1787
02:12:44,432 --> 02:12:45,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for giving the show a call.

1788
02:12:47,255 --> 02:12:47,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, Dork.

1789
02:12:47,835 --> 02:12:49,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, call during the show sometime.

1790
02:12:49,897 --> 02:12:50,698
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1791
02:12:50,838 --> 02:12:51,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1792
02:12:52,139 --> 02:12:52,920
[SPEAKER_04]: See you Skype is fun.

1793
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:53,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Click.

1794
02:12:53,919 --> 02:12:56,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like the little clicky noise it makes when we hang up on people.

1795
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:58,060
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1796
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:00,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it.

1797
02:13:02,621 --> 02:13:03,221
[SPEAKER_04]: We're out of here.

1798
02:13:03,821 --> 02:13:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of done with tonight's show.

1799
02:13:05,521 --> 02:13:06,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave this open a few more minutes.

1800
02:13:07,042 --> 02:13:09,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Angel was really trying to get through, and I don't know what happened, but yeah.

1801
02:13:10,762 --> 02:13:23,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be uploading my two new remixes, the Ecstasy one and the Room of Angels one, probably tonight, actually, for other reasons.

1802
02:13:24,657 --> 02:13:26,958
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be able to let our listeners download it, right?

1803
02:13:27,018 --> 02:13:28,318
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the number one reason.

1804
02:13:28,758 --> 02:13:30,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, they can listen to it before everyone else.

1805
02:13:31,219 --> 02:13:31,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1806
02:13:32,839 --> 02:13:34,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm going to set up a post-show here right now.

1807
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:37,480
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this was really popular last week.

1808
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:40,561
[SPEAKER_04]: We played some stuff from the Ministry of Sound Compilation, the annual.

1809
02:13:40,581 --> 02:13:43,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to do that again, except we only got through disc one last week.

1810
02:13:43,802 --> 02:13:45,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to just go ahead and start it off with disc two tonight.

1811
02:13:46,923 --> 02:13:47,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.

1812
02:13:49,503 --> 02:13:50,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm turning into Aaron here.

1813
02:13:51,894 --> 02:13:54,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so lovely when it's sunny
