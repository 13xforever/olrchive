05:04.780 --> 05:05.280
Why?

Something in my throat there.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.060

05:30.340 --> 05:31.340
I kind of like gummy bears.

05:31.340 --> 05:34.340
That makes me sad.

05:34.340 --> 05:38.340
Also joining us tonight we have a couple of special guests.

05:50.340 --> 05:51.340

05:51.340 --> 05:53.340
Don't you have anything else to do on Sunday night?

05:53.340 --> 05:57.340
Villages to burn and convenient stores to rob.

05:57.340 --> 06:00.340
Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not thinking of you like that.

06:05.340 --> 06:06.340

06:06.340 --> 06:10.340

Alright, sounds good.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.340

06:53.340 --> 06:55.340
We'll be sharing that with you guys tonight.

06:55.340 --> 07:01.340
And um, I guess all that and whatever else we can come up with to fill the next three hours.

07:01.340 --> 07:04.340
But first, we're gonna do a little bit of a break.

10:40.260 --> 11:05.660

11:05.660 --> 11:27.820

12:59.820 --> 13:04.820
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, this lovely October evening.

13:04.820 --> 13:09.820
I'm so tired today, I don't know if I've got three hours' worth in me.

13:09.820 --> 13:16.920
It's going to be like squeezing the sponge to get the last little drop out.

13:16.920 --> 13:17.920
But I will do it.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.920
For the listeners, I will force myself.

13:19.920 --> 13:23.120
And if you don't do it for them, we'll force you.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
That's right.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.680
We're going to start off tonight's show, we start off every week playing a little bit

13:27.680 --> 13:32.000
of how was your week, how was your day, a chance for you to catch up with us and our

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
personal lives.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.280
You can be nosy and invade our personal lives.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.920
And we'll start by opening up the file on Jamie.

13:38.920 --> 13:47.060
week was all busy crap busy busy busy crap lots of stress and yeah that's

13:47.060 --> 13:53.000
pretty much my week I'm sorry no no no specifics you want to get no it was

13:53.000 --> 13:59.800
busy and it's gonna be even busier next week and I'll see Tuesday when I came

13:59.800 --> 14:05.160
home the the business that uh was gonna cause me to cancel the show all right

14:05.160 --> 14:10.160
Didn't happen? And I was all stressing out? Well, you know about that. You told me.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.160
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:12.160 --> 14:18.160
I thought it was something else. See, I'm so confused. I have so many things going on right now that I'm just...

14:18.160 --> 14:20.160
It's like spaghetti.

14:20.160 --> 14:28.160
Well, at any rate, I just had bucket that night and had dinner with Dan and had a nice time and relaxed.

14:28.160 --> 14:33.160
But I'm still stressed as hell, so it's going to be that way until after Halloween.

14:33.160 --> 14:39.980
I it's exactly how I feel yeah all right well I guess that does it for Jamie's

14:39.980 --> 14:49.240
week let's talk to Loki you want to talk to us about your week yeah didn't really

14:49.240 --> 14:53.400
do a whole month a lot of stuff oh what'd I do this week oh yeah I played

14:53.400 --> 15:00.200
leisure suit Larry all week that's pretty much what I did and other than

15:00.200 --> 15:04.320
I played a little bit of Final Fantasy this weekend and and then

15:05.640 --> 15:10.160
What else did I do? I don't know just kind of hung out

15:11.320 --> 15:13.320
trying to stay out of the weather and

15:16.280 --> 15:18.240
Yeah

15:18.240 --> 15:22.920
Pretty much all that happened. Oh, and I bought an Arazuka yesterday because I was at the mall

15:22.920 --> 15:27.820
I had money. I didn't want to buy a game because I'm just gonna rent it and

15:27.820 --> 15:32.420
and so you know I couldn't leave empty-handed

15:32.420 --> 15:37.820
so I got an airzooka instead. Virgin didn't have any echo image

15:37.820 --> 15:41.260
of course why was I even looking because... WHAT?!

15:41.260 --> 15:44.500
explain what an airzooka is for those listeners that don't know

15:44.500 --> 15:48.540
it's a giant thing that shoots a ring of air at you

15:48.540 --> 15:55.540
it's like a giant um... I don't know, it looks like a giant tube with a big elastic thing at the end

15:55.540 --> 16:00.540
Elastic thing at the end you pull it back and then creates like you know how if you've heard the blows of smoke rings

16:00.640 --> 16:05.040
Well, it does the same thing creates like a shockwave of air that goes up there about 10 feet

16:05.040 --> 16:11.100
And it's supposed to be harmless and you can like shoot it at animals and stuff and all that fun stuff

16:12.340 --> 16:18.420
That's when Arizona is this giant thing that I waste a lot of well not a lot of money, but I wasted money on and

16:18.420 --> 16:28.420
And, yeah, that's pretty much all that's been going down this week. It's been pretty boring. Pretty boring.

16:28.420 --> 16:35.420
Oh yeah, that's right. Oh wait, I already talked about my trip though, didn't I? Yeah, I think I did.

16:35.420 --> 16:42.420
Yeah, so. Okay, yeah, that's pretty boring. Oh, and I saw the Grudge. That was cool.

16:42.420 --> 16:47.420
Yeah, I'll talk about The Grudge in a little bit, because I saw it too.

16:47.420 --> 16:53.420
But first, we'll talk to Arcadian, Bradley, and talk to him about his week, because I know he had a fun week.

16:53.420 --> 16:58.420
Oh yes, I did. And it started off really, really fucking shitty.

16:58.420 --> 17:08.420
I thought two miles from leaving this apartment last week, the fucking Folsom Police Department stops me, god damn motherfuckers, and says, oh...

17:08.420 --> 17:09.420
After leaving this show.

17:09.420 --> 17:15.740
Yes, right after leaving the show. Two miles away, the fucking guy pulls me over, and says,

17:15.740 --> 17:20.620
Oh, you don't, your registration's out of date, so it's over six months, so we gotta tow it.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.100
Fuck you. Don't!

17:23.900 --> 17:26.300
Really fucking sucks. At least he didn't get me for speeding, because

17:26.940 --> 17:31.580
it was right at a fucking place where it goes from 50 to 40, and he couldn't bust me for that,

17:31.580 --> 17:36.540
but he didn't. And so, he goes to tow it away, he says, Do you have money? I say, Yeah, I do.

17:36.540 --> 17:41.900
I went down to the thing and called Rob down to the and so he came and picked me up and took me home

17:42.580 --> 17:43.980
Thank you, Rob

17:43.980 --> 17:47.780
No problem because I was I was dropping off angel anyway, so we're down

17:47.780 --> 17:52.620
Yeah, so sure they can pull you over for fucking you know expired registration

17:52.620 --> 17:55.020
But they never catch anybody that runs the fucking red lights

17:55.300 --> 18:02.900
Makes the goddamn left turn when there's a right turn only Lane and fucking just blatantly you know drives like assholes

18:02.900 --> 18:08.320
Now they just totally forget that. Oh, but yeah, they can pull me over when they think that I made an illegal

18:09.200 --> 18:14.720
With that I blew through the light and swerved around someone they say even though I made a legal left turn on a green

18:15.200 --> 18:20.340
That's the Folsom PD for you. Oh and also takes two officers for every fucking stop. Yep

18:20.340 --> 18:26.060
You think you can pull someone over and they just bring their back up because they have that many officers doing nothing

18:26.260 --> 18:29.100
Yeah, they did that and Rob mentions a yo

18:29.100 --> 18:33.400
I saw two people and he actually drive actually past me when I was stopped and God forbid

18:33.400 --> 18:38.720
There's actually an accident there cuz then they'd get like six cars over there. I remember one time that we were sitting in

18:39.600 --> 18:44.060
Subway and my friend accidentally because they were waving at us and stuff. They weren't paying attention

18:44.060 --> 18:50.960
They had it in the wrong gear and accidentally rear they hit it in reverse and like backed into a car

18:50.960 --> 18:55.920
And it took six cop cars to come to the Taco Bell to take down this report

18:55.920 --> 19:00.920
And it just frustrated the hell out of me.

19:00.920 --> 19:01.920
Yeah, bitches.

19:01.920 --> 19:05.920
Well, then once I got home I called my manager and he said,

19:05.920 --> 19:10.920
You better get it out tomorrow because those fees for the tow yards go up

19:10.920 --> 19:14.920
astronomically so they can take away your car after a number of days.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.920
They'll take away your car, put a lien on it, sell it off.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.920
So you want to get it out tomorrow.

19:19.920 --> 19:20.920
Uh-huh.

19:20.920 --> 19:27.920
So, after that, I had to wait until like 4am in the morning, called my mom on the east

19:27.920 --> 19:33.640
coast and asked her to put in some money in my account and she did it for me.

19:33.640 --> 19:38.660
So in the morning I called my coworker and she drove me over to the Carmichael DMV and

19:38.660 --> 19:46.320
10 minutes after they opened I paid $319 and got my registration and temporary tags so

19:46.320 --> 19:48.220
I could get a smog check.

19:48.220 --> 19:53.400
And so from there, since the bus wasn't coming for 30 minutes, I decided, oh, I'll just go

19:53.400 --> 19:57.880
ahead and start walking towards ARC, the American River College.

19:57.880 --> 20:02.960
That took about, by 45 minutes later, I was there, even though my foot was hurting in

20:02.960 --> 20:06.000
the beginning, but it didn't hurt after a while, so that was okay.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.460
But after that, I took a bus from there to Greenback, then from there to Orangevale where

20:11.460 --> 20:16.160
the thing was, the cohort, and it says, hey, okay, let's see if we can get it out.

20:16.160 --> 20:20.760
Oh, you have to go to Folsom PD and get them to release it.

20:20.760 --> 20:24.160
So you have to go there and show them that you've got your registration and everything.

20:24.160 --> 20:29.960
So after that, I didn't know about the buses to there, so I started walking towards Folsom.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.460
And I missed the bus that came next, so I said, ah, let's go ahead and walk.

20:33.460 --> 20:37.160
So I walked another mile and a half down the hill, which wasn't too bad.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.960
It was a nice day out and so on.

20:40.960 --> 20:45.660
Then from there, I walked across the bridge because I missed the bus there.

20:45.660 --> 20:50.240
I kind of just went on and then said, nah, I'll just go walk a bit farther.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.840
So here comes the stupid part.

20:51.840 --> 20:57.200
There's a, I've got like a little, the person at the tow yard set gave me a map, which is

20:57.200 --> 21:03.200
a, you should go to Natoma Boulevard, or Natoma Street, but I thought it was Natoma Street,

21:03.200 --> 21:06.040
and I thought it was like a right turn, so I, when I went to Natoma Street, I went and

21:06.040 --> 21:09.800
turned to the right, and thought, oh, the levers are going up, and I didn't think to

21:09.800 --> 21:13.280
go left and see if there was something up that way, I just went down this, kept going

21:13.280 --> 21:16.880
down this road miles and miles didn't ask where any directions or anything

21:16.880 --> 21:21.800
until I got to the end basically to a big cross street that's the lady that's

21:21.800 --> 21:25.920
the lady of the apartment there apartment complex says where's the

21:25.920 --> 21:31.280
chosen PD said it's Natoma there's no Natoma Street you did it she didn't say

21:31.280 --> 21:34.680
that of course she was fighting it was crazy it's crazy guy walking away the

21:34.680 --> 21:40.560
long way so after that I watched to walk back to the next bus stop that took me

21:40.560 --> 21:46.000
to the top of the street and they had to walk like half a mile or so down to the PD. They

21:46.000 --> 21:51.400
said, oh, okay, here we go, give me a ticket and say, okay, oh, we got to pay $20. Oh,

21:51.400 --> 21:56.600
fuck, got to go across the street, get money out of the bank. Oh, my God. Then walked back

21:56.600 --> 22:01.160
across the street, paid the money, then got to go back to the thing. So walked back down

22:01.160 --> 22:07.040
to Riley and then got on a bus, which was good. The bus took me almost there, then paid

22:07.040 --> 22:11.140
875 bucks to the fucking tow yard and got it out and yay

22:11.720 --> 22:16.660
Then I went back to work for like three and a half hours and then made it up the rest of the basically made up my

22:17.080 --> 22:19.080
whole week and

22:19.320 --> 22:24.280
That was it for that tough lesson learned everybody out there register your car

22:24.640 --> 22:30.760
Yeah, don't fucking drive in Folsom and don't ever come our way and in other news

22:30.760 --> 22:35.120
I got keys to work so I can stay late and lock up the place if I

22:35.120 --> 22:37.680
otherwise, after everyone else has left.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.880
But if you want to make, you know, if you want to run through red lights and make illegal

22:40.880 --> 22:47.420
left turns, Folsom's where it's at, because no one gives a shit.

22:47.420 --> 22:53.960
Not broke now, because Mother gave me enough money so that I could do that, do that and

22:53.960 --> 22:54.960
a little bit of extra money.

22:54.960 --> 22:59.400
Which is helpful, because I could go and get a new tear mat, because my other one has a

22:59.400 --> 23:04.800
hole in it that's been poking me in the foot for, like, three or four months, and go to

23:04.800 --> 23:11.040
the mall of wart, the mart of walls and buy stuff. That's what I did today before coming

23:11.040 --> 23:12.040
here.

23:12.040 --> 23:19.560
Alright, wow, well, interesting week there. Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week

23:19.560 --> 23:20.560
went.

23:20.560 --> 23:29.960
Well, not much really. Just school and work. Although, my instructor is becoming quite

23:29.960 --> 23:37.600
of a flake he almost canceled class on Monday yeah well I suppose he has his

23:37.600 --> 23:47.760
own reasons um played a little katamari to Masi and other stuff this week maybe

23:47.760 --> 23:54.920
like a couple hours worth of f11 which is not as bad as you guys but hey it's

23:54.920 --> 24:04.280
something I also spent some time with well what one-third of Orange Lounge not

24:04.280 --> 24:09.760
the host of course the other people that usually come here last night and spent

24:09.760 --> 24:14.680
an hour waiting to get into dinner

24:15.240 --> 24:20.600
yeah I can talk had dinner and watched movies and stuff last night that was

24:20.600 --> 24:27.680
pretty cool which I don't get to do that often so that was kind of fun and that's

24:27.680 --> 24:34.040
about it pretty much all right something else dad but I think you're gonna talk

24:34.040 --> 24:38.560
about it okay okay I'll I'll talk about my weekend my

24:38.560 --> 24:43.720
week in my weekend um pretty much this week was you know pretty nothing too

24:43.720 --> 24:47.760
wonderful or exciting about me because I did two live show this week and I ended

24:47.760 --> 24:51.760
filling in for Jamie on Tuesday just because we didn't have a repeat to run

24:51.760 --> 24:54.960
and I was bored so I said what the hell so I did that Tuesday and of course I

24:54.960 --> 24:59.440
had the regular show on Wednesday and then Thursday I hung out my friend and

24:59.440 --> 25:03.120
pretty much nothing interesting happened till Friday when I went and saw a grudge

25:03.120 --> 25:07.680
with Loki and his girlfriend and my buddy Christopher we went to this

25:07.680 --> 25:11.440
theater my god it was packed not only was the theater packed but it was packed

25:11.440 --> 25:15.240
full of high schoolers because apparently these movies really appealed

25:15.240 --> 25:18.740
to the high schoolers and boy do we make a mistake going on opening night with all these

25:18.740 --> 25:22.800
high schoolers in there because every scary part of the movie and there was a lot the

25:22.800 --> 25:29.960
movie was pretty scary every scary part every all the girls like and like even it's I don't

25:29.960 --> 25:33.960
want to ruin it but there's this one part where the screaming became almost rhythmic

25:33.960 --> 25:41.940
it was like it was really funny I can't if you've seen the movie you probably could figure

25:41.940 --> 25:46.340
out what part i'm talking about but this is one part where it just was rhythmic it was so funny

25:46.340 --> 25:51.860
um but then there was this guy in the back of the theater he was being really annoying and you know

25:51.860 --> 25:58.100
the type i'm talking about he's like that high school jock type he's sitting there like making

25:58.100 --> 26:02.340
those noises because apparently other high school jock types find those kinds of noises funny

26:02.340 --> 26:07.060
and they're girlfriends or whatever so he was kind of mocking how everybody else was getting scared

26:07.060 --> 26:12.740
everybody. Oh my God! I want my mommy! And apparently this is funny when somebody does

26:12.740 --> 26:17.620
this. Never mind that it's a sold out theater and he's getting on everybody else's nerves

26:17.620 --> 26:21.400
in the theater and just bugging the hell out of all of us. You can just feel the tension.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.100
Like everybody just wanted to turn around and punch this guy in the face. Am I right

26:24.100 --> 26:29.900
Loki? Uh, sure. Okay. So finally, I don't know what came over me, but I just turned

26:29.900 --> 26:33.380
in. Mind you, this is right at the climax of the movie towards the end of the movie.

26:33.380 --> 26:36.760
still yelling and screaming he's been doing it for five minutes I turn around

26:36.760 --> 26:40.940
I look right at him and I yell in the crowded theater I sell I said would the

26:40.940 --> 26:44.540
guy with the little penis in the back row please shut the hell up and

26:44.540 --> 26:50.300
everybody burst into applause and started laughing and thought was kind of

26:50.300 --> 26:54.620
cool and then he shut up so he knew who he was by the way I addressed him by

26:54.620 --> 26:59.960
being the small penis guy so my advice to you don't be afraid to shout it out

26:59.960 --> 27:02.500
if people are distracting the movie because chances are everybody else

27:02.500 --> 27:05.980
around you is finding them distracting too, and they'll back you up. They're just being

27:05.980 --> 27:11.320
chicken. They don't want to say anything. So I can credit my couple years, oh God, several

27:11.320 --> 27:15.160
years experience with Rocky Horror Picture Show for making me unafraid to yell back at

27:15.160 --> 27:19.640
a movie. So, speaking of which, I ended up going to see a local production of the Rocky

27:19.640 --> 27:24.680
Horror Show, which the movie is based on. They did a little bit of the play here in

27:24.680 --> 27:29.640
Sacramento, and it was pretty nice. Rice Princess, she's been out, you know, she's usually on

27:29.640 --> 27:32.520
Wednesday nights outside the box she's been out of the loop for a couple weeks

27:32.520 --> 27:36.240
because she's been doing costuming for this show so I kind of went to see how

27:36.240 --> 27:39.720
that all worked out the costumes were very nice as was choreography a little

27:39.720 --> 27:44.080
thing I wanted to mention about it was the Broadway version the one that they

27:44.080 --> 27:48.600
played on a Broadway in 2000 hmm so that's where the different people were

27:48.600 --> 27:51.400
talking about well this isn't how the original play was because it actually

27:51.400 --> 27:55.560
was the redo for Broadway yeah original Brian went back into the strip for

27:55.560 --> 28:05.560
I recognize it because I have the 2000 recording, and it was the same thing.

28:05.560 --> 28:15.560
Very good. So, it was a good show. I liked it. Too bad it's over, so I can't really recommend it to anyone else because it's done now.

28:15.560 --> 28:19.560
Today was the last show, so if you haven't seen it yet, too bad.

28:19.560 --> 28:23.560
And besides, a lot of you aren't in Sacramento anyway, so this means nothing to you.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.140
but it is a good play if it comes to your town you should check it out it's

28:26.140 --> 28:27.780
pretty funny how people can yell back

28:27.780 --> 28:31.140
even at the actors even when it's not a movie and then other than that I've just

28:31.140 --> 28:33.860
been doing a lot of rehearsal because there is going to be another production

28:33.860 --> 28:35.180
of the movie soon

28:35.180 --> 28:39.340
which I'm involved with so I've just been very tired going to rehearsal

28:39.340 --> 28:42.700
some things like that and Jamie knows where I'm coming from with that certainly

28:42.700 --> 28:47.660
Amen. I'm just glad I don't have to do prop crew this time around

28:47.660 --> 28:53.260
I mean I like doing prop crew and that's all cool. I'm doing lighting and that means I'm going to just sit on my butt playing with light switches

28:53.260 --> 28:55.260
It's a good job. It's an easy job. It's good.

28:55.260 --> 28:56.260
Yeah, you know, I don't mind...

28:56.260 --> 28:58.260
You have a lot of control in that little box.

28:58.260 --> 29:00.260
I don't mind the running about, you know...

29:00.260 --> 29:02.260
If someone makes you mad, you just turn the light off.

29:02.260 --> 29:05.260
Well, I don't really mind doing the running about, putting stuff up on...

29:05.260 --> 29:06.260
You know, it was fun.

29:06.260 --> 29:08.260
But I was exhausted last time I did it.

29:08.260 --> 29:12.260
And, you know what, I'm just going to sit back because I'm stressed enough.

29:12.260 --> 29:15.260
So, after next week, it's just going to be so tired.

29:15.260 --> 29:19.260
Which, by the way, reminds me, you guys, next week is Halloween.

29:19.260 --> 29:24.860
And so, on Halloween night, it's not looking like we're going to have a live show, you guys, just so you know.

29:24.860 --> 29:27.560
Because it's Halloween and people want to go out and do Halloween stuff,

29:27.560 --> 29:29.960
we actually don't think there's enough listener base,

29:29.960 --> 29:32.660
because you guys will probably all want to go out and do your own things for Halloween.

29:32.660 --> 29:36.160
So, what I think we might do next weekend,

29:36.160 --> 29:41.860
we might do some type of very scary marathon of old Orange Lounge episodes.

29:41.860 --> 29:43.860
We might fit that in next week, so...

29:43.860 --> 29:45.560
That means we definitely get to hear Loki sing.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.960
Yeah, that means episode 69 for sure would be in there,

29:47.960 --> 29:52.400
because that has to be one of the scariest episodes we ever did so we're

29:52.400 --> 29:58.280
gonna work something out where we do a marathon of old episodes so that's

29:58.280 --> 30:03.400
pretty much it for my week of my day nobody had anything remotely DDR related

30:03.400 --> 30:09.080
in their week at all it's just yes angel I was at fries and I met one of our

30:09.080 --> 30:18.160
local freestylers? No. Prestige. Oh, okay. I've never heard. What, is Fry's the place

30:18.160 --> 30:24.400
to play DDR in town now? Because I know that, um, what's, what's his name online? I can't

30:24.400 --> 30:29.400
remember. Islander. I don't, I know his real name. I can't remember his name online. Islander

30:29.400 --> 30:33.000
plays a lot at Fry's from what I hear. He plays a lot of DDR at Fry's because I guess

30:33.000 --> 30:36.800
it's near his work. And then I guess Prestige goes there. You're going there and you're

30:36.800 --> 30:41.920
playing DDR. Fries must be the place to be now all of a sudden. What happened to, well

30:41.920 --> 30:45.080
I mean I know what happened to Golfland and all the arcades in town, but it's kind of

30:45.080 --> 30:48.800
sad when a department store becomes the main DDR hangout in town.

30:48.800 --> 30:54.600
Well, I was just shopping for geek stuff and well, he was there and so we just started

30:54.600 --> 31:00.800
playing DDR for like 15 minutes and like eyeing the employees that work there because, you

31:00.800 --> 31:06.520
know, I guess they don't see a lot of people that can actually play the game all day long.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.800
So, that was pretty, uh, pretty cool.

31:09.800 --> 31:14.160
He's pretty good. I liked watching him more than I liked playing myself, but

31:14.160 --> 31:17.360
they had Xtreme up, and so,

31:17.360 --> 31:20.880
we were playing that. It was fun.

31:20.880 --> 31:25.320
Good times, good times. So,

31:25.320 --> 31:29.560
it's getting sad, but there's just, you have to understand, there's really not a

31:29.560 --> 31:33.160
whole lot of reason for us to go out and play DDR in this town anymore, because

31:33.160 --> 31:33.920
really,

31:33.920 --> 31:37.480
Nobody's really gotten anything new in

31:37.480 --> 31:42.000
six months at least. When did Golf, I'm sorry, when did Guitar Freaks

31:42.000 --> 31:47.360
9, 10 come out? What the hell version do they have anyway? 9?

31:47.360 --> 31:50.440
I could give a shit after

31:50.440 --> 31:54.880
5 really. They actually still have the same 8th Guitar Freaks, 8th Mix, where they put in

31:54.880 --> 32:00.040
Drum Man, or Percussion Freaks, 9th Mix. That's it. Percussion Freaks, 9th Mix,

32:00.040 --> 32:03.400
and Guitar Freaks, 8th Mix, which makes no sense at all.

32:03.400 --> 32:07.560
Yeah, but that's the last new Bomani this town saw anyway.

32:07.560 --> 32:11.800
Except the step mania machine, but that thing was broken so fast that it

32:11.800 --> 32:15.980
you know, never really got to stick around.

32:15.980 --> 32:19.680
So really I think at this point a lot of us are just sitting and

32:19.680 --> 32:23.080
waiting in anticipation of Ultramix 2, because that's gonna be the

32:23.080 --> 32:27.320
next big story. I actually did play DDR Extreme the other day though, it's still

32:27.320 --> 32:31.280
it's still really fun to me. So that's one thing I guess I could say for it is

32:31.280 --> 32:33.260
that I was playing on the ignition pad trying to

32:33.260 --> 32:36.940
work some of my fat ass off because I've got a show to do next week.

32:36.940 --> 32:40.220
... makes popin' music and 2DX8 also.

32:40.220 --> 32:43.220
Absolutely, it's gonna be definitely a huge week,

32:43.220 --> 32:47.980
November 18th, when festival and popin' music 10 and all that fun stuff,

32:47.980 --> 32:51.820
2DX8 style come out too. Oh, you know we had a trailer. There was a trailer for

32:51.820 --> 32:56.420
2DX8 style that came out not too long ago, and we completely forgot to mention it last week.

32:56.420 --> 33:00.040
So I'm gonna make sure to bring it up tonight. In fact, I'm gonna do that right now.

33:00.040 --> 33:05.960
If I can find that, here it is. Here's some audio here from a new preview that is out

33:05.960 --> 33:11.480
for 2DX8 style, and I'll show this here in studio. Of course, you hear a little bit of

33:11.480 --> 33:21.480
Guadeca there. And it just shows the Konami logos here. And it says, ooh, 2DX8 style!

33:21.480 --> 33:26.160
And it's showing a lot of the screenshots in the game and all these videos. You see,

33:26.160 --> 33:33.660
alien world and a bunch of Japanese text something 50 and something 80 I'm sure

33:33.660 --> 33:40.080
somebody in our chat room can translate that there new song

33:40.080 --> 33:54.080
It's a very nice clip there of a Santa song.

33:54.080 --> 33:58.080
This is a new song as well.

33:58.080 --> 34:06.080
Yeah, it's definitely an LED song.

34:06.080 --> 34:11.240
look at that and it says there November 18 and had some clips from the new

34:11.240 --> 34:14.800
videos in there as well so I don't even remember where I got that I think

34:14.800 --> 34:17.580
somebody sent it to me so I would totally pass along where you guys could

34:17.580 --> 34:25.680
get it except I don't remember they said 50 new songs over 80 songs in total and

34:25.680 --> 34:29.880
they're confirming in our chat room Dark Lion XVI says the last song is Nebula

34:29.880 --> 34:34.240
Grasp Grasper was that last song you heard a little clip of there and I the

34:34.240 --> 34:38.040
But the one before that was the Santa song that's in the new pop music as well, right?

34:38.040 --> 34:41.740
The one that she sang at Tokyo Game Show.

34:41.740 --> 34:43.420
Correct me if I'm wrong.

34:43.420 --> 34:45.420
I could be.

34:45.420 --> 34:47.420
I don't know.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.420
Alright.

34:49.420 --> 34:53.680
Also in bemoning news this week, we got a little bit of bemoning news.

34:53.680 --> 34:56.300
The box art for Ultramix 2 came out.

34:56.300 --> 34:59.320
You might have seen this at your local store, actually.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.520
And the interesting thing about the box art, though, is that it has a little thing in there

35:02.520 --> 35:07.080
that talks about how it features dance hits. Like, remember how DDR Max said,

35:07.080 --> 35:11.980
ooh, this features dance hits from Darude and Aurora and all the bands that were in there,

35:11.980 --> 35:16.800
and then Max 2 was, ooh, it's Kylie Minogue. Well, this one says, featuring dance hits by

35:16.800 --> 35:22.160
Delirium. We knew that after all, right? Elvis, we knew that. Rubbernecking. Freestylers,

35:22.160 --> 35:26.640
which isn't ringing a bell with me, so I don't think we know about what this song is,

35:26.640 --> 35:29.840
and they've tried to do research, I think, over on the DDR Freak thread,

35:29.840 --> 35:33.840
But nobody's come up with what song that could be yet, so maybe we'll hear more about that later

35:34.000 --> 35:36.600
But we have the Commodores which we know is a brick house

35:37.560 --> 35:41.680
Nucleus which is jam on it. We talked about that before Captain Jack I

35:42.380 --> 35:46.220
Believe the dream a dream booty mix was confirmed previously and now

35:46.900 --> 35:49.660
Jason Nevins presents Holly James well

35:50.440 --> 35:57.080
Guess what Jason Nevins and Holly James? They only ever did one song together, so that pretty much

35:57.080 --> 36:06.160
no I did that song was just announced recently so anyway we're going to go

36:06.160 --> 36:10.320
ahead and play that song for you guys right now it's Jason Nevins and Holly

36:10.320 --> 36:15.080
James and the song is called I'm in heaven and we'll play that for you guys

36:15.080 --> 36:20.720
now this hasn't been confirmed but it's kind of one of those things where it's

36:20.720 --> 36:26.680
like well unless it's a remix or something like that who knows so we're

36:26.680 --> 36:30.880
gonna play that for you guys right now. The assumed radio edit would be the

36:30.880 --> 36:34.100
version they'd use in DDR because we haven't heard if it's a remix again. It's

36:34.100 --> 36:39.600
kind of unconfirmed but at the same time when it's on the box art, you know, duh. So

36:39.600 --> 36:46.600
So here it is, Jason Evans with Holly James, I'm in Heaven.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.600
I'm in heaven with you

37:15.600 --> 37:19.600
I'm in heaven with you

37:23.600 --> 37:26.600
Don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel

37:27.600 --> 37:30.600
When these feelings I have really are for real

37:31.600 --> 37:34.600
The time is right for this, a love to shine the moon through

37:34.600 --> 37:38.600
But you gotta tell me what you wanna do

37:38.600 --> 37:43.600
I'm in heaven with you

37:46.600 --> 37:51.600
I'm in heaven with you

37:53.600 --> 37:58.600
I'm in heaven with you

37:58.600 --> 38:06.600
I'm in heaven with you

38:06.600 --> 38:24.600
I'm in heaven with you

38:24.600 --> 38:28.600
Every time you're near, I start to lose control

38:28.600 --> 38:32.600
When the thought of you hits my very soul

38:32.600 --> 38:35.600
When you're lying in my bed, right next to me

38:35.600 --> 38:39.600
That's when it starts to feel, feel like ecstasy

38:39.600 --> 38:44.600
I'm in heaven with you

38:47.600 --> 38:51.600
I'm in heaven with you

38:56.600 --> 38:59.600
I'm in heaven with you

38:59.600 --> 39:23.600
I'm in heaven with you

39:53.600 --> 40:17.560
I'm in heaven with you I'm in heaven with you

40:17.560 --> 40:21.560
All you want from me, all you want from me

40:21.560 --> 40:25.560
You'll never make it through

40:25.560 --> 40:27.560
All you want from me

40:55.560 --> 41:01.200
public service announcements from Orange Lounge Radio.

41:01.200 --> 41:07.480
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and that was a song that has not been confirmed

41:07.480 --> 41:12.280
yet it pretty much has by the box art. I'm in Heaven, Jason Evans featuring Holly James.

41:12.280 --> 41:17.200
What do you guys think of that? Pretty cool. Yeah, did you realize that that's actually

41:17.200 --> 41:22.240
a former Cage Match winner from this program? I remember that song. Yes, Loki, Loki picked

41:22.240 --> 41:25.200
that song a while back or at least I don't know if it was necessarily that

41:25.200 --> 41:29.580
mix I think it was one of your white label mixes very close that was it oh my

41:29.580 --> 41:35.520
bad okay so that was it so now Jamie you had picked delirium after all in a cage

41:35.520 --> 41:41.360
match once yeah Loki you picked that one which was in a cage match one I want a

41:41.360 --> 41:50.480
song in ultra man it's not fair no oh yeah we'll see all right maybe one day

41:50.480 --> 41:51.480
Chicks are for kids.

41:51.480 --> 41:52.480
All right.

41:52.480 --> 41:56.360
Maybe one day.

41:56.360 --> 42:00.540
So what we want to do now, I actually want to go ahead and give somebody a call here

42:00.540 --> 42:01.540
on the Skype line.

42:01.540 --> 42:04.540
We tried to get him on the show here last week, but unfortunately the connection was

42:04.540 --> 42:08.560
really bad, so everybody keep your fingers crossed that the connection is a little bit

42:08.560 --> 42:09.560
better tonight.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.560
Somebody's got their fingers crossed.

42:10.560 --> 42:11.560
Yes?

42:11.560 --> 42:14.480
Okay, so hopefully he's there, and I don't embarrass myself here on the radio, but we're

42:14.480 --> 42:19.040
going to go ahead and give this a try here.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.040
I hope it works.

42:20.040 --> 42:31.440
One ringy dingy, two ringy dingys, three ringy dingys, four ringy dingys, god I hope he's

42:31.440 --> 42:32.440
there.

42:32.440 --> 42:35.480
That'd be pretty funny.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
Hello!

42:36.480 --> 42:37.480
Hello.

42:37.480 --> 42:38.480
Hi!

42:38.480 --> 42:39.480
Is this frequency?

42:39.480 --> 42:42.880
Oh no, the connection's still kind of shy.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.360
Can you hear me okay?

42:44.360 --> 42:53.560
Oh no, we're still having a problem hearing him, he's very choppy, you only hear a couple

42:53.560 --> 42:58.000
seconds here and there, and then that's it.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Are you...

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I hear you falling.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.320
Oh, there you go, I can kind of hear him.

43:04.320 --> 43:09.120
You might have something with your mic sensitivity settings, I'm wondering if it's the mic sensitivity

43:09.120 --> 43:11.880
because I heard like a little bit there.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.880
Hold the mic up nice and...

43:13.880 --> 43:14.880
Hello?

43:14.880 --> 43:15.880
Hi.

43:15.880 --> 43:16.880
Yeah.

43:16.880 --> 43:23.400
Okay, so, I'm going to try and do a conversation here.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.520
How are you doing this evening, frequency?

43:25.520 --> 43:26.520
I'm doing okay.

43:26.520 --> 43:33.360
I just woke up from that one weekend, you know, sort of back to earlier.

43:33.360 --> 43:37.100
All right, so tell us a little bit about this tournament that just happened on the East

43:37.100 --> 43:38.100
Coast recently.

43:38.100 --> 43:40.980
I was kind of curious about what went on there, because we don't get to talk a whole lot about

43:40.980 --> 43:44.740
East Coast events on the show, so I'm kind of curious what went on with this tournament.

43:44.740 --> 43:55.740
Well, I think that last one was not so good, but it's not for me, because I ended up trying.

43:55.740 --> 44:00.740
You know what, I'm sorry, the connection for some reason, we're not getting them for some

44:00.740 --> 44:05.740
reason. I'm only hearing like little bits and pieces of you, so gosh, I'm really sorry.

44:05.740 --> 44:10.580
I guess what we're going to have to do, maybe we can try giving you a call later in the

44:10.580 --> 44:13.160
the show I have another idea I'm gonna try getting back to you a little bit

44:13.160 --> 44:19.160
later frequency I have another idea okay all right take care bud bye bye ah what

44:19.160 --> 44:24.360
a bummer what a bummer I do have another idea though but I'm gonna I can't get to

44:24.360 --> 44:29.840
it till the next break but that that does give me an idea okay so I guess we

44:29.840 --> 44:33.080
have to shift gears here I darn cuz I have a lot of good questions I want to

44:33.080 --> 44:36.160
ask them too and we don't get East Coast people on this show a whole lot but

44:36.160 --> 44:40.480
But that's alright, we'll give it a try later.

44:40.480 --> 44:44.520
Well moving on, I guess we could talk about other news going on.

44:44.520 --> 44:47.720
Didn't you find some news about Pump It Up that was going on this week, Loki?

44:47.720 --> 44:51.280
You got really bored and you found out that Pump It Up actually had some news going on?

44:51.280 --> 44:53.880
Yeah, there was two things going on.

44:53.880 --> 44:59.920
Number one being, there's another release that's coming out in November, I believe,

44:59.920 --> 45:03.600
and that would be Pump It Up Exceed on the JPS2.

45:03.600 --> 45:07.920
So that's going to be coming out, god damn it, dude our connection is fucking sucking

45:07.920 --> 45:08.920
tonight.

45:08.920 --> 45:13.200
Anyways, yeah, so Pump It Up Exceed, it's going to be coming out, it's going to be arcade

45:13.200 --> 45:19.440
perfect, so there's going to be 100 plus songs, it's going to be coming out one week before

45:19.440 --> 45:22.720
all the DDR stuff.

45:22.720 --> 45:28.120
There's rumors though that it's going to be coming out also for the US PS2 and the Xbox

45:28.120 --> 45:37.020
later on. Also, they've added a few different modes in there. They have a mode that's kind

45:37.020 --> 45:43.620
of like where you just watch videos, the background videos and that type of thing. And also, supposedly,

45:43.620 --> 45:51.940
the PC version USB pads that shipped with the old version, Premiere, I think actually

45:51.940 --> 45:57.260
are going to be working with the PS2 version. So, that should be pretty interesting. Looks

45:57.260 --> 46:07.940
pretty cool so far. Other than that, starting, looks like this coming week in Korea at Animero

46:07.940 --> 46:13.900
headquarters will be beta testing for Pump It Up Exceed 2, which they haven't really

46:13.900 --> 46:19.140
released any details on that. I'm sure that will be coming next week as stuff leaks out

46:19.140 --> 46:24.220
from the beta test location. So that's your Pump It Up news.

46:24.220 --> 46:32.220
Exciting. I think it's very strange that Pump It Up could possibly come to the U.S.

46:32.220 --> 46:39.220
And then they're also saying, they're rumouring that In The Groove could be coming to the home versions as well, so it's going to be very interesting.

46:39.220 --> 46:44.220
I doubt that one, but I do too, but they're saying it, so I guess I should acknowledge it.

46:44.220 --> 46:51.220
I doubt that but no seriously McSeed though is doing extremely well like in

46:51.220 --> 46:55.100
some of the other countries that you know non English countries like Mexico

46:55.100 --> 47:01.940
is fucking hot over there and I couldn't I mean why not try releasing it over here

47:01.940 --> 47:05.780
see how it does because I'm sure I mean most of the stuff they've got is in

47:05.780 --> 47:08.660
house artists anyways so you're not really you know gonna lose money on

47:08.660 --> 47:13.060
licensing as far as music goes really there's not much to lose there I mean

47:13.060 --> 47:17.700
other than you know oh you have to make some new pads or something but I think

47:17.700 --> 47:21.060
you'd do pretty well over here you know give it a shot I mean it can't be any

47:21.060 --> 47:24.580
worse than like say you know Britney's dance beat and all that crap I mean at

47:24.580 --> 47:30.940
least it's a step above all that stuff so you know hey why not I think it'd be

47:30.940 --> 47:33.460
very interesting if they did give pumping up a home release for this

47:33.460 --> 47:38.980
reason because DDR they've kind of stopped doing the arcade thing and I

47:38.980 --> 47:43.860
think especially with DDR or I'm sorry with Konami USA they've kind of given up

47:43.860 --> 47:48.700
on doing the arcade thing there's not going to be a new arcade mix unless hell

47:48.700 --> 47:52.620
freezes over so basically it is possibility but very low chance low low

47:52.620 --> 47:56.540
low chance so basically they've pretty much stuck to the home versions and I

47:56.540 --> 47:59.580
think everybody understands that the home versions are where they make their

47:59.580 --> 48:03.660
money and Konami of America they push the home versions it's their bread and

48:03.660 --> 48:08.140
butter for DDR they see the future of DDR being these home versions and that's why

48:08.140 --> 48:11.460
they never really threw a fit over the import mixes at least as far as I can

48:11.460 --> 48:16.860
tell because the import mixes of DDR arcade kind of serve as promotion for

48:16.860 --> 48:21.460
the home versions so everything works out everybody you know gets their share

48:21.460 --> 48:25.520
well now if pump it up ends up coming up for the home coming out for the home

48:25.520 --> 48:29.620
versions was Konami gonna take issue to that is there anything they can do about

48:29.620 --> 48:33.620
it me I don't know I mean there were those rumors a while back that and Amira

48:33.620 --> 48:38.220
Konami might have had it out in court and that's why you know I don't know

48:38.220 --> 48:41.460
it's a bunch of rumors going on out there you think Konami would take issue

48:41.460 --> 48:44.700
that what do you think would happen anybody have thought Loki I'd especially

48:44.700 --> 48:50.060
be curious what you think you I seem to have a strong opinion I don't know if

48:50.060 --> 48:53.240
they're legally able to bring it over here actually because of the whole

48:53.240 --> 48:59.060
lawsuit thing earlier but then I don't know if they're you can't really I mean

48:59.060 --> 49:02.300
I'm sure the DDR hasn't gone after you know Konami hasn't gone after any of

49:02.300 --> 49:10.940
these other games that have similar rhythm type things with them, I'm sure it'll be fine.

49:10.940 --> 49:15.140
I mean, it'd be pretty cheap if they just went after them, if they started doing well.

49:15.140 --> 49:19.400
I mean, oh yeah, well now that they're doing well, I guess, yeah, we have a problem with

49:19.400 --> 49:27.460
it now. But, yeah, I don't know. To be honest, I really don't know. But, here's the thing,

49:27.460 --> 49:33.940
here's my concern okay about in the groove coming to the home console first

49:33.940 --> 49:39.700
off I don't think it's gonna happen only because one it's gonna be hard I mean

49:39.700 --> 49:44.380
making a console games a little harder than making you know just the arcade you

49:44.380 --> 49:47.300
know ports and stuff cuz I mean hell anyone can hook up a PC to an arcade

49:47.300 --> 49:51.940
machine it's not that hard now I'm programming for the home console is a

49:51.940 --> 49:56.100
little different well if it's fucking hard enough they have 11 12 footers in

49:56.100 --> 50:00.100
in the arcade, how the fuck do you even play that on a softpad? That's never gonna work.

50:00.100 --> 50:04.100
So, that's my concern right there. I don't think it's ever gonna happen. I mean, it...

50:04.100 --> 50:08.100
I'm sure they'd like to see it happen, but feasibly, I don't think it's gonna happen.

50:08.100 --> 50:12.100
Very interesting thought. Anybody else

50:12.100 --> 50:16.100
have a thought on In the Groove coming out for home, or what Pump It Up may

50:16.100 --> 50:20.100
do for DDR? Well, Pump It Up actually did have a home

50:20.100 --> 50:24.100
release on PC. That's right, I forgot about that. Was that in the US, though?

50:24.100 --> 50:31.060
Well, yeah, actually, Red Octane sells it, and I don't think they sell the import DDRs,

50:31.060 --> 50:32.060
or do they? I could be wrong.

50:32.060 --> 50:33.060
Yeah, I saw that too.

50:33.060 --> 50:34.060
Oh, do they?

50:34.060 --> 50:35.060
I think so.

50:35.060 --> 50:39.060
Huh. I'm not sure. Yeah, I completely forgot about that. You're right, Pump It Up did have

50:39.060 --> 50:44.620
a previous home release on the PC. Not that the dance market on PC is very lucrative,

50:44.620 --> 50:49.420
I believe the folks that created DDRPC found that out the hard way. You know, I saw those

50:49.420 --> 50:52.100
games going for like $10 a pop at Fry's not too long ago.

50:52.100 --> 50:58.820
go. Interesting. Do you think... I think I got mine for about the same. Do you think

50:58.820 --> 51:02.860
that Pump It Up coming out for the home version would help DDR? Or do you think it's going

51:02.860 --> 51:10.220
to hurt it? You know, I think that after they compare, but I don't know. It can depend.

51:10.220 --> 51:14.900
There's different factors to consider. I think the biggest turn off is that you'd have to

51:14.900 --> 51:20.260
get a whole other dance pad for Pump It Up. Because, although it would be very easy, you

51:20.260 --> 51:23.880
would think with the ignition pad you could just use the buttons the XO

51:23.880 --> 51:28.000
circle square which are in the corners but there's no center button there's not

51:28.000 --> 51:31.840
the center doesn't do anything on those pads as far as I know so it you're kind

51:31.840 --> 51:35.560
of screwed there the pump it up pads not only do you have the corner buttons they

51:35.560 --> 51:40.680
do have the up down left right buttons also because those are for song select

51:40.680 --> 51:48.760
stuff they use those so yeah so theoretically any DDR pad that has all

51:48.760 --> 51:53.380
the corner buttons would work except the official Konami ones because they don't have triangle

51:53.380 --> 51:56.420
and what's the other one that's missing? They don't have triangle and square on the back

51:56.420 --> 52:00.240
like most of the other pads do except all the other pads are missing that center button.

52:00.240 --> 52:03.900
So now you've got to have a whole new dance pad if you want to play Pump It Up at home.

52:03.900 --> 52:06.460
And how many people are that obsessed with Pump It Up where they're going to spend all

52:06.460 --> 52:11.180
the money on that? And how many stores are going to pick up those Pump It Up pads for

52:11.180 --> 52:16.140
commercial sale? Because, you know, you find those third party pads in every little store

52:16.140 --> 52:24.060
that sells video games now. Well, you never know. I mean, it could possibly. It could.

52:24.060 --> 52:29.680
The possibility's there, but how successful can it be when it's so limited, when Konami

52:29.680 --> 52:36.600
kind of has a grip on it as it is? I don't know. It'd be interesting. Alright, I guess

52:36.600 --> 52:39.960
what we're going to do now is we're going to take another break. When we come back,

52:39.960 --> 52:43.520
we'll hopefully have everything set up so we can try calling Frequency again. That'll

52:43.520 --> 52:47.780
be very cool if not I guess we'll have ourselves a cage match that'll be some

55:30.840 --> 55:32.840
Get to pressure!

55:32.840 --> 55:35.840
You've had the time to rest

55:35.840 --> 55:37.840
which is coming to an end

55:37.840 --> 55:39.840
and we start again!

55:39.840 --> 55:53.840
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency, the radical M.C.X. wish he got the level of peace

55:53.840 --> 55:55.840
One, two, three, fire!

58:23.840 --> 58:27.840
All our friends, we've got to make a message to take care of you.

58:27.840 --> 58:29.840
We're gonna get there

59:27.840 --> 59:47.840
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

59:47.840 --> 59:51.240
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

59:51.240 --> 59:55.200
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More

59:55.200 --> 59:56.200
program.

59:56.200 --> 59:57.200
Can we talk about that?

59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.700
subject will ever be taboo. Well I was thinking maybe we should move pump up

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.820
the volume from Tuesday nights. Except of course the subject that was just under

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:10.700
discussion. Okay well what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:16.740
attack music we play on the station? I collect your fucking head. Just like this

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:22.660
fucker here. Oh my god why did you do that to Loki? The

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.660
The alcoholic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:33.660
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:41.660
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.660
You know what I never understood, Jamie, is why does your voice sound so different in that promo?

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:51.660
I don't know. I was taking just these voice acting lessons and decided to sound like Lucy Liu.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.660
Oh, I see. Maybe it was something like that.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.660
I think I did pretty well, don't you?

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.660
I think so. I think so.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.660
Now, I got this new thing for Skype that allows us to dial phone numbers,

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.660
so I'm going to try this real fast. I'm going to do a test.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.660
I hate to do this live on air, but damn it, I want this to happen.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:10.660
Ooh, it worked.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.660
What the hell do you want?

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.660
I think it worked. Hello? Can you hear me on this thing?

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.660
Yeah, there's a delay, but that's cool.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.660
I'm on my phone and I'm here.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.660
You need to hang up. We don't want any.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.660
Alright, I'm hanging up on him. Cool, it worked.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.660
Okay, so hopefully we can do that and make it work.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:32.660
It's a little quiet, but maybe I can tweak the volume settings in there and get it to work.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.660
Would you like to take a survey?

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:38.660
You're crazy.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.660
No, no, I'm not crazy.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:48.020
slightly strange Loki's the crazy one with his portal to hell and all that

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.620
all right how's it going there look you're trying to figure out what that

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.660
freestyler song could be huh you're trying to do research there what were

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.540
you doing there earlier you're hacking that master file thing that I don't even

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.040
I can't even remember what the hell this thing is.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.040
It's the master song list, I was looking at it, from...

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.040
Where does that come from, the master song list?

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.040
Well this is from, it's a document that,

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.040
or it's a file that's in,

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.540
well this one's in the DDR Extreme USA CD, or DVD.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.540
So I was looking to see,

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.040
cause there's a few songs in there,

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.040
I see some from the new,

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.040
new Dancing Stage game that's gonna be coming out,

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.040
and then there's a few that I didn't recognize.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.040
So I was just seeing if I could figure it out,

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:42.040
Cause I'm in here, remember we, you know, reported a few weeks back about Superstar.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.040
That's in there.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.040
So, um, you know, just stuff like that.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.040
So I was just seeing if it might be in there.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.040
Cause it might be. You never know.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040
What is that you're...

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.040
No, I found out, I had the microphone in my lap and people can hear me being IM'd.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040
I'm sure.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040
My bad.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:13.040
Alright, I guess what we're going to do is go into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match for this week.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.040
You want to change your song? Do you have a new one?

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.040
Yeah, um, hold on a second.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.040
Alright, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match tonight.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:40.040
Last week in the Orange Lawn's Radio Cage Match, Echo Image won for the fourth week in a row, meaning they are retired.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.040
Goodbye. You're gone. You're out of here.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:52.040
But let's have one more moment to remember the Echo Image, the very first song ever to be retired in the Orange Lawn's Radio Cage Match here.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:58.500
Let me feel if the song here the song was called come back and here's a little bit of come back for you to remember this

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.500
song by

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:19.100
Alright, that's enough of the song.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.820
You've heard enough of it over the past four weeks.

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:28.460
Alright, so you get three brand new songs in their entirety tonight, each host bringing

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:34.460
one song to the table. And who's going to go first tonight? I guess I will. Why not?

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.980
I never get to go first because I hardly ever win this thing. So, I'm going to go first

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:44.300
tonight. I'm going to play my song. And, whoops, that's not the song I'm doing. My song is

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:51.300
a song by Ian Van Dow, who is the guy who did Will Eye from DDR Max 2. And he has a

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:56.120
new song out. And the song is called Reason. And that's going to be my cage match pick

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:03.120
for tonight. So, enjoy Reason by Ian Vandal, my pick. Song number one tonight.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:37.120
Do you think it's time to realize Where is the love?

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:46.120
Are we gonna stay together Or is it time to say goodbye?

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.120
Where is the love?

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:55.920
Give me a reason to hold on to what we've got

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:02.720
Must be a reason to hold on to what we've got

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.320
Time has come to set things right

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:13.120
Is it worth another fight?

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:18.320
Tell me the truth

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:22.320
Is there something on your mind?

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.320
Tell me what you hide inside

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:30.320
Tell me the truth

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.320
Give me a reason

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.320
To hold on to what we've got

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.320
Must be a reason

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.320
To hold on to what we've got

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.320
Give me a reason

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.320
To hold on to what we've got

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.320
Must be a reason

01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:00.320
To hold on to what we've got

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.320
Are there things that I should know

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.320
Will you stay or will you go

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:14.320
Where is the love

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.320
Tell me, is there hope inside?

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.320
Gotta read between the lines

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320
Where is the love?

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:55.000
Give me a reason, hold on to what we've got It must be a reason, hold on to what we've

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Give me a reason, hold on to what we've got

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Might be a reason, hold on to what we've got

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Give me a reason

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Alright that was song number one in tonight's cage match

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.500
That was Ian Bandau with Reason. Let's go around and see if they had a reason to like or hate this song in the studio. Jamie!

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.500
It's fancy.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:54.500
Again, I'm really burned on tonight. But it's not bad. I mean, I've heard it before.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500
It's a 7. 7 now.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.500
I actually thought Jamie would give it a lower score because I remember her saying she was sick of trance.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.500
But dammit, I'm out of songs.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
That's a new one that I happen to like.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
Bradley, what'd you think?

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500
I think it was pretty good. I'll give it an 8.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.500
Fair enough.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.500
Loki!

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:16.500
I'm not sick of trance, but I'm sick of Ian VanDahl, so I think it's a 6.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:23.500
I like it. It's happy. It's not my favorite Ian VanDahl song, but I think it is worthy of a cage match title.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500
I give it an 8.5.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:29.500
Uh, Ian VanDahl's cool. I'll give it an 8.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:35.420
Alright, let's go on to song number two which is coming to us courtesy of the

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:40.480
lovely Dark Sacra. Dark Sacra what did you pick for us tonight? Well I need to

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:44.340
find the name of the song again because I remembered that you had it because you burned my CD. Let me give you a

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:49.500
hint the song is called everybody wants you to emerge. That's it it's a mix of

01:09:49.500 --> 01:10:04.660
emerged by fisher spooner and I had picked out like this remix of buster

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:12.540
move I saw that when you sent the file over earlier I was in my car and emerges

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:18.420
on my and this comes from the queer eye for the straight guy soundtrack right

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:22.580
yeah and every song on there is a good DDR song whether you love or hate the

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:27.940
show it's got a great bouncy soundtrack to it so let's see if this enough I

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:32.100
don't like the opening song yeah that's kind of weird I know the opening song is

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:43.180
like too gay but the rest of it's really good all right oh you should you should

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:46.260
have heard the thing on Tuesday I did a whole did you hear oh I did a whole

01:10:46.260 --> 01:11:10.260
On the test thingy, and I need that by the way, I remember being in Mobile and my friend's little Honda thing, just listening to the station play all those poppy dancey stuff like that, and then all of a sudden they'd be like letting me play what I was going to be having, and then they'd go back to the 90's.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:15.680
If for some reason heaven forbid Orange Moms Radio ever went belly up and we weren't doing this show anymore

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.680
I think I would have to start an early 90s dance music station

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.200
Maybe we just want to start one anyway, compete with ourselves

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:30.500
Hey, there's somebody out there that I know we're trying to negotiate with somebody out there to do a new show on our network

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:34.180
And they're thinking of ideas for the show. There's a great one right there

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.020
there and I know you like that kind of music person in San Diego they have an

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:44.100
80s and 90s radio station it's the best of both decades

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:51.660
all right popular when I get Grand Theft Auto tomorrow all right anyway anyway

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.820
we're getting way off subject we're getting way off subject we have

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:58.980
something let's go to Fisher Spooner versus Billy Splier with everybody wants

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:05.980
to emerge. Enjoy.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:33.980
Need to be merged from nothing

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:40.980
You don't need to step away

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:48.980
You don't need to be merged from nothing

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:55.980
You don't need to step away

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:39.980
Everybody wanna die, I wanna die

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:47.980
You don't need to be merged from nothing

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:31.980
Everybody wanna fall in love with you

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:34.980
Feels good

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:38.980
Looks good

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.980
Sounds good

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.980
Looks good

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.980
Feels good too

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.980
Everybody wanna fall in love with you

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:33.980
Everybody wants one, everybody wants one

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.980
Everybody wants you

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:47.540
Song number two in tonight's cage match. Fisher, Spooner versus Billy Swire. Everybody wants

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:53.060
you to emerge. Let's emerge our decisions on that song. Jamie.

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:59.060
You know, I really like that mix of it. It wasn't quite what I had remembered it to be,

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:03.060
But I still like it. So it gets an A from me.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:07.060
One of these days I'm going to bring you this old song.

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.060
I was going to say, it samples an old song in there.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:14.060
Because I've heard that old song at the raids before and I'm almost positive.

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:18.060
Well, Emergent is really cool. The song itself.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:23.060
I really like that mix because it's a lot different than the original.

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.060
Okay. Alright, let's go on. Bradley.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:31.820
I had no idea what the hell they were saying, and it filled me with eh, so I gave it a five.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.540
Luggy!

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.220
I second the eh.

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:38.020
It was just like...

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.620
It got annoying.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.860
Sorry.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:47.740
Actually, when I heard that song, I kind of thought, this might be like a Guitar Freaks fun song.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:50.740
It's kind of funky, I like it.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.220
Man, that'll be funky.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.420
I think that was pretty cool. Um, seven and a half.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:04.220
Alright. Remember, our votes don't mean shit. It's your votes in the chat room that really decide this.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.620
You got one more song that you can pick from.

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.220
God help us all, it's Loki's.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.420
Ah, man. Well, I have a few things that'll win you over already.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.820
Not trans, and short.

01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:23.820
The other thing I forgot to mention that I did this week was saw Team America World Police.

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:27.820
And this is America Fuck Yeah

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:57.820
Now you have some answer to America

01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:58.820
Fuck yeah!

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.820
So lick my butt and start throwing my phone, America

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.820
Fuck yeah!

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:08.820
What you gonna do when we come for you now?

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:11.820
It's a dream that we all share

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.820
It's a hope for tomorrow

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.820
Fuck yeah!

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.820
Together

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:20.820
Fuck yeah!

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:21.820
Promise

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:22.820
Fuck yeah!

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:32.820
Fuck yeah, baseball, fuck yeah, NFL, fuck yeah, rock and roll, fuck yeah, internet, fuck yeah, slavery, fuck yeah, fuck yeah

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:49.740
Summer, fuck yeah, Dizzy World, fuck yeah, porno, fuck yeah, Valium, fuck yeah, Reebok, fuck yeah,

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:45.140
Alright, gotta love Loki, song number 3 is a nice cage match from the Team America World

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:46.140
Police soundtrack.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.300
America, fuck yeah, fuck yeah, or fuck no, Jamie.

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:55.300
It would be a humorous song for about 10 minutes and then they'd get over it.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.300
Um...

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.300
It gets sick.

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:01.300
I don't know, I had no desire to see the movie, so...

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.300
Fair enough, Arcadian.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.300
Fuck maybe!

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.300
Uh...

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.300
I'd give it like a 7-7-1-5.

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.300
Alright, Loki.

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:13.300
I'd give it a 10.

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:18.300
I was specifically instructed by my girlfriend not to sing the song any longer, so...

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:23.300
I hope you don't sing that while you're trying to have sex.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:28.300
Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! That's beyond!

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:33.300
I give that song the same score I'd give the movie a 4. Angel.

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:38.300
No, a 4 out of 10.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:43.300
Um, it was okay. I was just listening to the movie last night.

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:49.300
Um, five and a half.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:52.300
Go see what?

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:58.300
You could go see a good movie instead. Probably.

01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.300
Seriously?

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:04.300
If you're gonna go see a movie, go see The Grudge, but go on a school night where the kiddies can't go.

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.300
Alright.

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:09.460
You've heard what we think, now it's time to hear what you think.

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.740
You're gonna decide tonight's winner from three brand new songs

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.660
while Loki throws pens at me in anger of my score.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.540
All right, let's hear a clip from all three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:23.420
Song number one you can vote for tonight is Reason by Ian Van Dow.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:41.620
Song number two in tonight's cage match is Fisher Spooner vs. Billy Squier, Everybody

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:42.620
Wants You To Emerge

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:59.860
And song number three in tonight's cage match from the Team America World Police soundtrack

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:00.860
America Fuck Yeah

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:09.860
Yeah, it's a dream that we all share. It's a whole new world. Fuck yeah!

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:25.860
Place votes now. Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your votes. Song number one, song number two, or Skye number three. Song number three, your votes can decide it all.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:32.380
Now, you know the scary thing though about that Fuck Yeah song is it's actually, if you

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:36.820
took out the lyrics, it kind of sounds like a Guitar Freak song. It really does.

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.300
Yeah. Like an old one.

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:42.180
Wait, wait, we're losing you there. Adjust the bottom mic there.

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:49.180
Oh, yeah, yeah. Especially with the speeding up, like, bass drum part, kick drum or whatever.

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:54.020
Just like the little synthesizers and everything kind of make it...

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.340
yeah yeah it makes it it gives it that sound

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:01.240
alright you know what it sounds like PBR

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:05.300
like the end of PBR that's what it sounds like kind of

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:08.380
god I haven't heard limousine in a long long time

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:13.380
limousine! strong bad

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:17.140
oh boy oh boy I can't believe that

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:20.540
this is the first time we've had to retire a song you know we've been doing

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:23.700
the cage match for almost two years now that's the first time we've had to

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.740
retire song we actually haven't done the cage match since episode 1 it was

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.940
something we added to the show when we went three hours on episode 20 I think

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:36.380
because the show only used to be two hours all right all right we're gonna do

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.540
now we're gonna try and get that connection that we had earlier we were

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.260
trying to get frequency for the East Coast on the phone you guys I'm sure you

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:46.980
know this guy if you're on DDR freaked around the money style I think these

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:50.420
amount on both those sites and he's definitely out there if you're on the

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.740
East Coast you definitely definitely know this guy is so we're gonna give him

01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:56.900
a call because we want to ask him some questions that were kind of spawned from last week's

01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:00.100
show. So let's have a look and see if we can get frequency on the show.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:07.300
Hello. Hi, is this frequency? Yes, it is. Hey, how are you doing? I'm doing okay. Good.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:10.980
Oh, I'm so happy we can finally hear you a lot better. It's going to be unfortunately

01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:15.260
a little bit quiet to our listeners, but that's kind of the best that we have to do right

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:20.100
now. But at least we can hear you fine here in studio, so that's the important thing.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:24.100
Alright, so, how you doing? How was your week?

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:28.100
Um, the week was fine, um, you know, no problems there.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:36.100
So, oh, look at that, the guy next door, that's great.

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:41.100
The guy next door has a ham radio and I like to interfere with all the electronics in my house.

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:45.100
I think it's just the forces don't want you to come on this show.

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.100
I guess so.

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.100
I guess is what it is, oh well.

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:54.060
So, as I was trying to ask you earlier before Skype was cutting us off, you went to a tournament

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:55.380
this past weekend.

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:58.220
Tell us a little bit about this tournament, because we're here on the West Coast, we don't

01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:01.360
know anything about what's going on in the East Coast, and that needs to change.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.140
So inform us on what was going on with this East Coast tournament.

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:11.660
The East Coast tournament was, the tournament itself wasn't really a good tournament, in

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.660
my opinion.

01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:21.180
of itself just ran wrong and things weren't properly organized and things like that.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:26.700
And we, you know, after the entire thing was done with, we, you know, realized what the

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.740
problems were and we're going to fix those for the next years and things like that.

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:35.860
But as publicity for DDR, it skyrocketed.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.380
Yeah, now this is, now we actually had a caller last week, Zaku called in, he said something

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:44.940
about the crowds that had come to the DDR tournament were bigger than the ones for what,

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.380
the Blue Man Group and who else did he say?

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:52.860
Yes, it's literally, you could literally pick any exhibition there. Blue Man Group was there

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:56.860
for an hour and Ludacris and some other Def Jam artists were there for an hour, for a

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.780
little while. Opie and Anthony were there for a little while.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.660
I'm sorry, Opie and Anthony was the only one you mentioned.

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:05.180
They're hacks anyway. No, I'm kidding.

01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:11.180
So they were all there, but we still had a crowd no matter what.

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:17.180
These people, when they came, they had a crowd for a little while, and then when the people left,

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:20.180
there was no crowd at the other people's booths anymore.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:26.180
Because these people were representing on XM radio and other things,

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:30.180
like O.B. Anthony was at XM radio for like an hour or something like that.

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:36.180
Obviously they had a crowd for a little while, you know, but you know, you can only stay so long and listen to Anthony, I guess.

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:44.680
But yeah, everyone was, everyone just stayed and watched people step on arrows all day. It was amazing. It was truly amazing.

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.680
Even Perfect Attack?

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:54.180
Yeah, more so than Freestyle, actually. There was a lot of people watching Perfect Attack that, you know, were just like, wow, this is amazing how they do that.

01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:59.020
You know, and half the people are like, even though they don't know what they're doing,

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.860
they still want to know how they do that.

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:12.060
But publicity-wise, Sami, the person who put these women together, and myself, made a whole

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:16.300
bunch of contacts on Thursday because the press was the people who allowed it on Thursday.

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:19.340
I was going to say, I bet a lot of press was at this event.

01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.260
Yeah, we had a lot of press.

01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:31.260
So does this mean we can be looking forward to seeing DDR in the news any time soon, or in the press? Some big stuff?

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:39.260
Maybe not in the news and the press. There's already been enough stuff in the news and the press that it's in the wrong angle.

01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.260
That's true. I guess that's very true.

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:52.260
The problem is that the angle is weight loss. Everyone likes that weight loss angle and everyone jumps on that. I was at Fox News a couple weeks ago.

01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:56.260
I was actually going to ask you about that, the Fox News thing.

01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:02.260
I'll tell you exactly what happened. What they did was on Friday night I get a call from these people.

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:07.260
And I'm like, yeah, sure, I'll come in. They just want DDR. I'm like, okay, I can do DDR.

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:15.260
So I come in next day, because that's when they want me to interview live next day, with no preparation.

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:25.260
I'm sitting in the briefing room, not getting briefs. I was actually sitting next to the person who was interviewing me, and I had absolutely no idea until I was actually called in.

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:29.260
And when I got into the studio, the first thing the girl says is,

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:31.260
Well, you're not a kid.

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:36.260
And I'm like, No, sorry, someone should have probably informed you about something too.

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.600
they thought they were getting a twelve-year-old what yeah

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.960
and i do have a thought

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.400
they thought well you're always going to come in and

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.200
doing interview i remember that because we were watching the clip here in studio

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.380
during a show about a month ago and we were you know having a little fun with

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:52.460
how kind of bad the interviewer was the person who's ever you know

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.640
and it sounded like she was talking down to you like a lot of the questions he

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.540
was asking i i remember did she say at one point the interview

01:28:58.540 --> 01:28:59.400
gosh you're

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.820
how old are you

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.420
yes well you know

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:05.340
you know i was twenty one but the thing that got me the most of what you what

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:12.100
said, you're part of the DDR freaks, and I'm like, are you serious? Are you serious? Are

01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:13.860
you really, what are you doing to me right now?

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:16.200
It's obvious they hadn't done any research.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:21.140
So like, I mean, I'm doing it for DDR, you know, to get the publicity up there for it,

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:26.420
so even though it's just the wrong angle for it, I mean, I tried to jump onto, you know,

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:30.380
the competition thing, she just tossed it right off of that, so regardless, they're

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:33.380
They're not ready for it.

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.380
But, you know, upcoming now.

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.380
Wait, actually, I have a quick question for you.

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:39.380
I have a quick question for you, though, before we change the subject.

01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:41.380
Do you think that part of that might be Konami's fault?

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:46.380
Because Konami's kind of going the weight loss angle with this?

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:50.380
Um, Konami hasn't done much.

01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:54.380
I'll tell you right now, they haven't done much in the publicity of DER.

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.380
They, um, you know, and they don't really need to.

01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:03.020
too, because it just so happens that mixes keep selling, whole mixes at least, keep selling.

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:12.020
Yeah, it just happens. People see these dance mats in the game stores and are like, oh,

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:15.860
what does that go with? And they go with this D.P.R. game and they buy it, they take it

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:19.100
home, and there's a lot of people who actually play at home and they just don't know about

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:25.780
the community behind it and its competition and how big this can really be. So Konami

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:30.980
really actually doesn't do much but this upcoming year you might see some stuff coming out.

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.980
Interesting, so I guess other little things you probably can't talk about?

01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:40.420
I can talk about them, it's just a lot of the stuff is, you know, works.

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:43.820
You don't want to say anything and then not have it happen, basically?

01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:51.460
I'll say what we want to do, I'll say what we're planning, first off, Sammy and I have

01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:55.620
a meeting with Ziff Davis Media tomorrow at 11am.

01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:00.020
Now aren't Ziff Davis Media the folks that run G4 Tech TV?

01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.020
They might be.

01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:07.180
I'm not too sure about the whole business, but I know that these are the people who put

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:15.100
together the actual convention last weekend, and they got Microsoft and XM and Intel and

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:20.600
Best Buy and all those other companies to come down and exhibit their stuff.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:26.600
So they were so interested in our place that they want us to set up the next year's tournament

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:35.180
now with sponsors and they want all these companies that came to the convention to help

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:41.140
sponsor us in whatever way possible and we're looking at a really big grand prize at the

01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.940
end of it.

01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:49.180
No real dollar amount has been set but we're looking at something huge, something enough

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:52.300
to get, like, many more people to end up coming out.

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:56.500
And, wait, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is coming off the heels of a $1,000 grand

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:57.500
prize tournament, correct?

01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:58.500
Yes.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.500
And you guys are talking about something bigger.

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.500
Right.

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:01.500
Wow.

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.500
Very nice.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:09.220
So, I mean, the $1,000 is actually put up by Sammy, but if we have people who, you know,

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:12.980
like Microsoft, who want to put up some crazy amount of money, you know, especially when

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:17.620
the swarm is going to end up happening later on next year, that people, you know, by the

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:23.340
time this actually ends up happening, hopefully through all the publicity that we get, people

01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:29.020
understand that, you know, DDR is out there, it's a big thing, you know, that's what we're

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.020
looking to do.

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:36.120
Another meeting I have coming up soon is with Fuse TV, I don't know if you guys get that

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.120
out there.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.540
Uh, they used to be much music, right?

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:41.060
Weren't they much music, and then they turned into Fuse?

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:42.380
I think that sounds about right.

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.380
I think it's a subscription channel out here.

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:45.380
Yeah.

01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:46.380
But I've heard of them.

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:51.380
We have, I have a producer contact that I actually made, and he absolutely adores the game.

01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:57.380
He just found it on Thursday when he showed up, and he absolutely adores the game when he first saw it.

01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:03.380
So I have a meeting with him in a couple of weeks, and we're going to pitch an idea, both together,

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:07.380
to Fuse about a weekly DDR show.

01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.380
A weekly DDR show?

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:10.380
Weekly.

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:14.380
Not some kind of DDR special, you're talking about like a weekly DDR show?

01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:23.380
Right, exactly. We're looking, we're probably looking at, like, the only idea was that, so far, that I've had was a weekly tournament, and...

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:28.380
Is this the OMG DDR game show that people have talked about for years?

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:30.380
I've never heard of that, actually, but, uh...

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:37.380
I see these threads occasionally on the message board where they're like, OMG, DDR game show type thing, could DDR be a game show?

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:41.620
i i don't maybe it's just that it was it's couple years ago and i'm

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.380
i don't know it just seems like i've seen these kind of ideas going around

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.060
before where people are like

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:50.100
omg they should have a ddr tv show and stuff and now you're saying that

01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.800
that's exactly what you're going to go pitch in a couple weeks

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:57.180
it's probably not going to end up being a game show it's going to be

01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:59.020
something like uh...

01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:03.380
uh... do you remember i don't even know if you guys had this out here do you guys

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:07.180
remember when they had this thing called the wmca championships

01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:09.980
it was a martial arts championship that used to

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:15.340
televised on MTV, and they had all these characters, and they had the locker room scene where people get mad at each other.

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:21.540
I actually remember this. It was a lot like the WWF, except it was karate. I do remember seeing a couple episodes of this.

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.460
It used to be on channel 31, remember?

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:25.320
I believe,

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:29.160
probably it wasn't the same channel here, but you know, I think I want to do something

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.940
similar to that, you know, like

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.700
tournaments end up meeting like the real world and MTV kind of thing.

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:40.580
You know, so like it gets, they kind of like, so you know the players, you know, and I'm

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:46.460
not going to like, like, I don't know, force them with like, uh, acting because these are

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:51.700
DVR players, they're not all actors, so like, we can't like pick and choose our players

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:52.700
either.

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.620
We want to, you know, showcase some good players.

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:57.100
In other words, you're not going to ham it up like wrestling.

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:00.700
Yeah, we're not going to, we're going to, you know, we're probably going to show how

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:05.740
the people train and maybe do some interviews and maybe some little cute skits in there but a lot of

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:10.540
it's going to be ended uh in my you know my thing we're going to actually just end up doing like

01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:15.180
a weekly tournament you know like red team versus blue team you know try to ham it up for a little

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:19.580
while maybe like a battle box kind of thing where every like month we end up doing a championship

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:23.500
for every few months or something like that and they get some kind of crazy trophy that we like

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:29.420
you know pass around interesting but do you guys do you guys think you would run into any resist

01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:32.420
Do you guys think you would run into any resistance from Konami?

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:08.720
If we have this contact here, which we obviously do, we can usually get the okay to do a lot of stuff, you know?

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.920
And that's what we're going to end up trying to do.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.520
We're going to try to push DDR, just because of the love of the game.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.020
We're not even getting paid to do this, you know?

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:21.520
We're just pushing the game to show it out, you know, get it out there and to the public.

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.420
And we want to see more people in competition get this thing mainstreamed.

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:28.620
And my personal goal is for it to be as big as the sporting events that are out there.

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:33.980
You know the Yankees and the Red Sox that were out you know last week everyone was watching that on the East Coast at least

01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:38.760
I don't know what you guys doing out there a little bit a little bit. You know so like I want to have that so

01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:44.540
DER comes up you know on the television maybe ESPN or whatever and everyone knows

01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:51.540
You know what a great is and how many how many greats the JSB gets on this song and everyone knows the stats and that knows

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:52.660
You know

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:59.280
The players you know and roots for their favorite team like the new york blue impulse versus the california trip machines or whatever

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.420
That's what we're looking to do. That's a hell of a goal, but that's a neat goal

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:07.980
Yeah, that's that's that's loki you look like you want to say something here

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:14.180
That's what we're pushing for and I want to expect that there's gonna be a huge jump in publicity in this next coming year

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:15.940
I hope so, but like you know

01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:20.500
I don't know it seems like it's gonna be about as popular as extreme or extreme dodgeball

01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:28.500
It might end up being looking like that, at least for this first year coming.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:38.500
But with a lot of the more context that we're getting, especially Konami, it looks like there might be more push for it.

01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:49.500
Considering it's a new genre of video game, it's already a sport in Norway, so it's got potential.

01:37:49.500 --> 01:38:04.500
It reminds me though of like that webcomic that's 10k commotion or whatever, it's just like you know with all the DDR drama and then you have the teams competing in a giant like tournament thing, it just seems a lot like that. Now if that's a bad idea, I think that's a pretty cool idea.

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:12.500
Well you know there's drama everywhere, there's drama in celebrities and stuff like that so it's not going to be you know more common.

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:22.500
I'll tell you what, if you ever want to take the DDR drama angle with this show, like Degrassi DDR League or whatever, I could give you pages and pages of real life fire drama.

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:26.500
No, don't worry, I already have pages and pages. I think just about everyone knows I have pages and pages.

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:35.500
You know, getting out of the tournament last week, a lot of the people actually ended up thanking Sammy for putting together the tournament, blah, blah, blah.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:40.500
And, to tell you the truth, Sammy screwed up a lot of the things about the tournament.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:47.500
And there were a lot of things that if he was more prepared, he would have actually ended up doing better work with it.

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.500
And I ended up trying to fix a lot of it behind the scenes and things like that.

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:54.500
And a lot of people don't even remember me being there.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:39:02.500
It's annoying at one extent and it's not too bad at another because I kind of don't want to be attached to the tournament

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:07.300
of the tournament being actually too bad, and I'm more attached to what happened otherwise.

01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:14.780
But I mean, there was this one incident during freestyle where Team Element from upstate

01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:22.140
New York came in to do the routine, obviously, to dive, and what happened was they went up

01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:27.180
for the first time, and Sammy wasn't ready with the camera.

01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.340
So Sammy says, wait, wait, wait, and tells one of the other staff members to reset the

01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:34.940
machine while they're mid-play. Well, not mid-play, but they actually were gotten to

01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:39.940
about 10 seconds of the routine. So Sammy goes, oh, I didn't know they started, right?

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:43.180
That would have been fine. Don't worry about it. Just start up again. So they're like,

01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:47.620
okay, fine. So they start up again. And the problem here was that they forgot mirror.

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:51.340
And we actually ended up forgetting to put event mode on, but that wouldn't have mattered

01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:56.620
if they, if they wouldn't have failed. So what happened was they ended up actually failing

01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:00.020
halfway through the song, you know, the fail, fail screen comes up because they forgot to

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.220
to put mirror on.

01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:02.380
Bummer.

01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:03.540
You know?

01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:05.060
So then they go ahead and they're like,

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:05.880
oh, what the fuck?

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.700
You know, we had it right the first time,

01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.700
blah, blah, blah, and then we're like,

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:10.820
okay, you know what, just go again

01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:11.900
and we'll figure out something later.

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:13.700
So they went again, they finished their routine,

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:16.660
you know, and we figured out, you know,

01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:17.940
I was, right in the beginning,

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.500
I said they're disqualified.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:24.500
And the reason I said that was because

01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:25.700
when you do a routine,

01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:28.620
everything about the routine is routine.

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:34.180
When you put options on, when you put your clothes on, when you do the routine, everything

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.580
is routine.

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:40.500
There's no real excuse of not putting an option on.

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:44.580
So you're saying the second they turn the machine over to you, it's routine time?

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:45.580
Right, exactly.

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:51.420
Once you have the option of choosing a song, making your options, blah blah blah, it's

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:56.580
routine to you and it's part of the routine that's going to come out and show it to us.

01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:57.580
You know what?

01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:00.840
I can see why you're coming from that angle though, because a lot of what you just talked

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:05.380
to us about, about this DDR TV show and stuff, you kind of were talking a little bit about

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:08.400
kind of the hype behind it a little bit too.

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:11.800
So I think, and we don't see this enough in freestyle, at least I don't see it enough

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.760
out here, but there's not often a lot of build up to these routines.

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.360
The routine is only the minute and a half, but yet they'll give you three minutes to

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:23.040
do something, yet people usually just choose to do something for a minute and a half, even

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.360
though they could probably have a lot more fun with it.

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.360
There's also a lot of the problem that people just aren't prepared for freestyle anymore.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:32.360
There's no real big pot for freestyle anymore.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:35.360
You know, everyone wants the expert tech, no one really freestyles,

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.360
no one really thinks they're good at freestyle,

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.360
people think they're good at freestyle and they really aren't.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.360
You know, it's just like, there's not a lot of people that jump out there,

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:47.360
get the job done, you know, and look awesome doing it.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.360
At least out here I've seen it.

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:55.360
People just don't put themselves together and make a good routine.

01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:01.360
To tell you the truth, when I did the Sports World Tournament two years back for Drifting Away,

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.360
I actually was planning to do insertion for a month.

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:12.360
I did this routine for about three, three and a half weeks, putting together every step, every arrow,

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:15.360
had a move to it, blah, blah, blah.

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:19.840
And at the end of it all, about three or four days before the competition, I scrapped the

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:20.840
whole thing.

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:26.280
I don't even know why, I think I just got sick of it or whatever, and I ended up doing

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280
drifting away.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:34.480
The day before, I literally slapped together, won the whole tournament, and that was the

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.480
story about that.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:40.800
Well, you know, the practice of building the other routine, though, probably kind of helped

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.480
in making the second routine, right?

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:45.520
Did you end up taking elements of your insertion routine?

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:51.040
Well, I don't know, like, there was more leeway with drifting away.

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:56.960
Drifting away's Trick Little, No Freeze has no arrows for the first half of it, so you'll

01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.080
see me get off the pad and do whatever for a while and, you know, like I had more freedom

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.080
to do what I wanted.

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.720
With insertion, there was a whole lot of arrows.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:07.760
I just loved the saw insertion, but the problem was there was so many arrows, you know, there

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.960
was a lot of stuff to work with and there was a big risk of me failing and, you know,

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:17.780
I don't like the total big risk of failing, you know, at least back when I was actually

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:18.780
competing.

01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:23.560
Although I might be competing soon because of the tournament last week.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:31.880
What happened was Sketch and Pfizer had a first place routine and it was a phenomenal

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:37.240
routine and they got inspired through a lot of my stuff but I kinda got inspired to go

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:41.820
ahead and beat their routine with something that I'll come out with later, and I have

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:47.200
ideas in my head that are jumping around, and I can't really tell, not because I don't

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:54.200
want to, but because I'm not sure when I'm going to compete. But I want it to be in any

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:59.160
place that we're going to tape it and show it online, unlike the dropout freestyle that's

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:03.280
still sitting on my side and no one knows what it looks like, not even me.

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.440
Very interesting.

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:14.440
So that's my plans. It's a lot of DDR publicity, and I guess some freestyle on a personal note.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.440
Well, I know we've been taking up a lot of your time here, but I do have one other question I want to ask you,

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:24.440
because it has to do with something that the caller last week had brought up about hearing something about,

01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:27.440
and I don't know if you can confirm or deny this, but he had said something about,

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:34.800
something about DDR maybe going out on tour with a rap artist. Is this a load of crap,

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.800
or what is it?

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:40.440
Well, actually, before we go to that, I'll tell you one thing that's on Thursday. Spike

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.800
TV came up to us and said, is it DDR Machine for Rent? And we're like, well, yeah, because

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:51.720
it's DDR Machine Rentals. That's why the company was obviously Sammy's. And they go, oh, because

01:44:51.720 --> 01:45:03.720
We have this video game award show that happens in California at that point.

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:06.720
We talked about this on one of our other shows, the Spike Lee's first annual show.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.720
Right, they want the DVR machine at the after party.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:16.720
But the problem is it's kind of out of the range because obviously that's the west coast,

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:22.680
coast and the east coast and it's a very long haul for that DVR machine, you know, on Sammy's

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:26.600
own because Sammy only has like a coverage range and then outside the coverage range

01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:33.920
there's a lot of, you know, money involved to try to get it out of that.

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:38.800
But on to the rap artist, so basically what happened was we were in the middle of the

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:45.080
tour months on Saturday and Ludacris and the F-Damn label were there and someone noticed

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.600
it like obviously because it was actually probably on the other side of the screen

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.680
that like ludicrous is probably on the other side of the curtain from where we were

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:58.760
and i actually ended up seeing them but someone a representative from their production label came up

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.640
specifically to me because i looked like i knew i was doing and they're like and they then they

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:11.000
asked me um is this you know for rent or is there even a possibility of taking the machine onto arm

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000
And, uh, you know, I was like, wow, you know, you want to have this thing on tour?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
That's pretty cool, you know, you can talk to Sammy, you know.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:30.000
So the person from Ludacris, uh, production label is asking for the DDR machine to be on tour with them sometime next spring or summer.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Interesting. Now what I'd be curious about though, is it on tour?

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Cause you know how sometimes the big celebrities with a rock and roll lifestyle, or in this case rap lifestyle,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.440
they've got all the stuff that they have in their trailer stuff. Is this DDR machine

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.600
for him to be using in his posse, or is it something he wants to have out there?

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:50.160
I have no idea what he wants to do with it. It's just the fact, you know, it's just kind of funny that he wants it,

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.360
you know. That's the thing that, like, you know,

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.160
you know, jumps on it. Like, I mean, Sammy has that contact information. I don't know what they're doing with that.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:02.240
Yeah, because when I think about famous pairs, I don't really envision Ludacris and DDR, but

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:06.200
whatever floats your boat. You know what? You're going to see a lot of stupid stuff soon.

01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:11.280
I'm going to tell you right now, there's going to be people in the sporting industry playing

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.280
DDR.

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:15.440
I'm positive it's just going to happen once it gets picked.

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:19.440
Good, we need more stuff to make fun of here on our little program, so bring on all the

01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.440
silly stuff.

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:24.720
Oh yeah, there will be plenty of silly stuff coming, I'm sure of it.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:31.280
But like I said, people will know once the show, if it actually ends up happening, the

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.600
weekly show, people will know.

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:36.920
We'll both be on DDR Freak and be Mani-style because I obviously am both affiliated with

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:43.520
both sites, so you will find out through both of those sites that something will be going

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:51.520
down at any point in time, whether it be the 2005 huge tournament or the DDR show or Ludacris

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.360
getting the machine for a tour or whatever.

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:59.680
You're going to find out one way or another through those sites.

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.580
And as we have in the past, we will go ahead and steal the news and post it on our own

01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:06.420
site and post a link back to the site we stole it from.

01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:07.420
Of course.

01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:10.980
They can always check orangelounge.com too, or orangeloungeradio.com because we always

01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:12.860
put that information up as well.

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:17.380
But definitely a lot of very interesting stuff it sounds like you got coming up in the future,

01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:18.380
so...

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:26.900
Yeah, I'll expect something good is going to happen next year, you know, and there's

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:36.260
And even talk, I don't even know if I want to say this, because of the media that we've

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:41.300
received and the call from Hinabi that we also got, you know, this big uproar that actually

01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:47.820
happened in only a week or so, we have the possibility of requesting a new arcade mix.

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:51.660
I'm jumping out of my seat!

01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:53.860
Yeah, right?

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:57.100
well people are now like the people who people are like down there like wait a

01:48:57.100 --> 01:49:01.020
minute wait what do you want to play arcade mix honestly listen here it is

01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:04.580
though this you know I don't think here's the thing I'm scared of this

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:10.340
being wolf it's not definite okay it's not something that's like well okay

01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:15.280
we're really doing this it's a possibility because America's now

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:20.780
finding out about DDR and it's a real big you know thing now that you know

01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:24.900
after this convention that happened, the public's like,

01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:26.020
wow, DDR?

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.460
Oh, wow, this is an amazing game.

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.180
Oh, wow, let's put this thing on TV.

01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:31.180
And then we're going to push it, push it, push it.

01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:33.700
And they're going to be bootleg illegal mixes.

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.060
Yeah, right.

01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:38.700
Well, because Konami's going to notice this, obviously,

01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:43.660
because they called us, we hope they're going to help us out

01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:46.340
and show us, here, look, we got a new arcade mix for you.

01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.500
How does that sound?

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:49.740
Interesting.

01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:51.600
let's go look at it

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.120
but he has to be a part of it

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.440
but that what he is convinced over here it's not gonna happen

01:49:58.440 --> 01:49:59.140
you know what

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:00.600
proven wrong what

01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.960
all of what you know

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.600
that were like gave up on thinking that the whole of the car out of the world

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.600
so i could always

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.700
you know i hope that the mail becomes out

01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:11.480
and that there's obviously people out there all of the like goals

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:12.680
that fast

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.880
no that

01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:17.960
like the high-quality to tell it i don't know it

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:19.280
so we're we're

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:24.000
me and Sammy, because of the levels of the game, want, you know, to push for the new

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.120
arcade mix to come out because, you know, like the USA stuff is kind of like, you know,

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:35.560
like sleepy and put together badly and, you know, Spell of Marvelous is with two L's and,

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:41.240
you know, things like that. So, like, we want to see a new arcade mix put together and even,

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:46.720
you know, if it ends up being like a home version, you know, like 6ix was, you know,

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:51.720
There's still something else that's not in the group.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.720
Definitely.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.720
Here's my advice to you though.

01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:00.720
If Konami is going to do it, make sure Hawaii is involved.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.720
Because if...

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:02.720
Hawaii?

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:04.720
If Konami Hawaii, the folks that did Ultramix 2.

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.720
Oh my god, no.

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:08.720
Oh my god, you've got to be kidding me. You're not a fan of Ultramix 2?

01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:09.720
Let me tell you right now.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:10.720
Yeah?

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:14.720
When Ultramix 1 came out, I thought it was all tournaments.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:23.720
I thought Tornamix decided to go ahead and put together a mix from Hawaii and send it out to people.

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:30.720
Looking at where he said he'd go, when the thing speeds up to 280 bpm for absolutely no reason.

01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:38.720
You have all these songs in here that are quickening. Is it six footer? How do you do that?

01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:43.720
How do you put steps quickening as a six footer?

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:50.720
You know, like, how do you do that? So with Elzerix 2 coming out, you know, and what's

01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:54.920
on there? Is Maximizer on there? Is that what's on there?

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:59.200
No, that's on DDR Extreme. See, I was going to say, here's the other half of that. Okay,

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.840
now if KOJ does it, then you're going to have Marvelous with two Ls, and you're going to

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:06.000
have Karaoke Revolution crossovers. So it's kind of like Damned if you do Damned if you

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:06.320
do.

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:13.320
It's just that they need to be aware of what, you know, the people who want the game want.

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:36.320
You know, I understand that they're trying to get another group of people, the people who play K-rev, you know, if they do get that in the long versions like that, or, you know, they're trying to get a different group of people putting U.S. songs in there like Move Your Feet and, you know, Afrika Bambaataa's songs, and, you know, they're trying to get, you know, the U.S. into their U.S. mixes.

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:56.320
But it's not up to that, it's up to good songs like in the arcade extreme, and good stepcharts, and things like that that push for people to play that are real hardcore players and people that aren't even hardcore players that even actually end up playing.

01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:01.320
I mean, the regular public doesn't understand that this mix has faults to it.

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:06.320
They just play the game, they see arrows, and obviously once they get into it, then they'll realize.

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:16.320
And that's all they want to really go for. If they actually end up getting the shit together, then this could be ending up being good.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:29.320
And if we have some kind of affiliation with Konami, I mean if I have an affiliation with Konami at any point in time where I could say what we should put on a mix, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:34.680
very good but you know I can I cannot you know I can't see another you know

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:42.040
home version song with some stupid step chart that looks like it's yes please no

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:46.520
hand plants in DER please no I'm playing what's like to go an entire different

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.680
show right now with you next week talking about how much I hate in the

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:52.840
groove well actually we're not gonna be on next week but I would love to have

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:56.320
like I could totally go on for hours and hours about how much I hate it but I

01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:01.320
I would love to have you back on the show sometime and we can dish on In The Groove.

01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:06.320
I actually was on the East Coast not that long ago and I got to go to it on the break and I got to check it out.

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:10.320
And if I could sum it up in one word, interesting.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:15.320
Interesting, that's good, that's good. Interesting is definitely a good word for it.

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:21.320
But yeah, to tell you the truth, I know I'm on all these big forums and everything,

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:27.720
But if you see me on itgfreak.com, you'll see me flaming everyone.

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:28.720
All I do is flame.

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.160
Actually, I think I just registered just to flame the group.

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:34.880
See, now you're just adding back into this DDR drama, the drama thing that you were talking

01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:35.880
about earlier.

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:36.880
Degrassi was here.

01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:39.600
Yeah, that's all I do, because you know what?

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:41.600
They really didn't care.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.400
I can almost tell that they didn't care.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.280
Or the people out there that are like, oh, I can make arrows and put arrows to the song

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:53.620
and no one cares what they look like and, you know, it's really frustrating to look

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:59.280
at that and have this be put out to, you know, arcades and have people play it, you know,

01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:04.820
or at least attempt to play it. I mean, once it first came out, it just, it didn't have

01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:09.300
a lot of, well it had a lot of like, wow, another, you know, dancing game, but now no

01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:11.500
one's playing it anymore over here at least.

01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:14.660
Interesting. Well, we'll get more of your thoughts on In the Groove a little later.

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:18.260
We've taken up like over a half hour of your time. Thank you very much for being on the

01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:22.980
show tonight. Keep in touch with us. Don't forget about us when you're off doing all

01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:25.900
these projects and stuff. You're welcome back on the show anytime to give us an update on

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:28.900
what's going on. And best of luck to you, man. Sounds exciting.

01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:29.900
All right, baby. All right.

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:30.900
Talk to you. Have a good one.

01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:31.900
Have a good night.

01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:32.900
Later.

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:33.900
Bye.

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:34.900
Bye.

01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:40.100
Wow. Lots of interesting stuff in that interview. Lots and lots of interesting stuff. I didn't

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:43.700
realize what the hell they're cooking up over there on the East Coast. Don't we feel out

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:48.080
of the loop now over here on the west that's very interesting so what guy how

01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.660
can we sum up that whole thing for people that joined us halfway through

01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:53.020
that interview there because we've been talking to frequency about past half

01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:57.980
hour there but what DDR going on tour with Ludacris next spring we don't know

01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:02.980
to what extent what do you say he's talking to Fuse TV about some type of

01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:10.340
DDR show that right now could could not be pitched with a WWE ish element or

01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:13.940
actually I wasn't the analogy is what do you say that the karate show fighting

01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:17.940
yeah yeah the the fighting show but he was saying maybe like a battle bots

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:20.660
type of thing where it's like a tournament very interesting you see what

01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:25.500
happens with that lots of producer contacts apparently at that DDR could be

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:28.540
showing up a lot in the media in the next few months and it won't be about

01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:34.220
weight loss and that's great and the more exposure the DDR gets in the media

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:37.820
the more material we have to make fun of here on this show so we're definitely

01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:40.860
definitely looking forward to it. And then of course at the end there he's talking about

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:45.920
if this gets big enough, don't wet your pants, but maybe a new arcade mix. But that's way,

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:49.940
way off in the distance. Don't get excited just yet. But honestly, dreaming about new

01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:54.020
arcade mixes is sometimes what keeps shows like this going. Because if we knew the game

01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:55.700
was dead, would we be here right now?

01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:00.380
I remember when we used to have new DDR.

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.060
It's already feel like getting to that point.

01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:05.960
I remember when Max came out.

01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:13.440
You know, that show sounds like it needs, like, wacky, uh, very informative, um, commentators

01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:20.400
on that. Some people with, like, radio experience, and some DDR experience, and, and just, you

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:26.600
know, something, someone that's been in the community for a while. Hmm, who could that

01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.600
be?

01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:33.440
We're trying to whore yourself out to everybody, Loki. Seriously. Alright, damn, you know what,

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:37.440
I need a break. Thanks to frequency for spending, that was like, looking at the little timer

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:42.640
going on, that was over 30 minutes of chat. Yeah. I think a break is a good call. Yeah,

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:45.640
Jamie appreciates it too, because she's got a lot of work on her poster done over there,

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:49.000
right? My posters are done. There you go. They're done. No, I was listening to you.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.640
No, I know you were, I know you were. It's just, I have this thing at work, where I have

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:58.960
ten posters done, and I've got five done. No worries. And I need a moment to tally up

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:03.160
those cage match votes, as it is. So we're going to tally up the cage match votes, and

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:07.160
We're going to take ourselves a nice little break here, because damn, we need a break after that.

01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:11.160
So we're going to do a break here of some, how about some 2DX songs?

01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:16.160
I'm going to do a couple 2DX songs. We'll start it off with one of my...

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:20.160
Let's do one we haven't heard in a while here. I'm going to do one from 2DX Fist Style.

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.160
I'm going to do the Cube first, then we'll do Get On Beat. I'll try to get that in there too.

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:27.160
And we'll be back in a little bit. We're going to do the FUs of the Week.

01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:32.160
We're going to let you know who won the cage match, and who knows what else when we come back.

01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:39.160
that. Alright, we'll get to Loki as well when we come back.

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:26.960
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:28.960
One

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:30.960
Two

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:32.960
Three

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.960
Four

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:36.960
Five

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:38.960
Six

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:40.960
Seven

01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:42.960
Eight

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:44.960
Nine

01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:46.960
Ten

01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:48.960
Nine

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:50.960
Ten

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.960
Nine

01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:54.960
Nine

02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.960
Uh, yeah, I was just playing.

02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:34.960
Hey guys, hope you're doing well, and I'll see you guys in the next video.

02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:03.960
whoa

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:09.960
whoa

02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:14.960
whoa

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:19.960
whoa

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:26.960
whoa

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:33.960
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:40.960
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:48.960
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:53.960
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming

02:05:53.960 --> 02:06:22.200
Hi, this is Mel B. of RTF.

02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:27.200
or an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melody can join us on all the fun together.

02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:32.200
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:36.200
and still the fun is just as great. It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:41.200
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:44.200
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We gotta get Mel back on the show at some point.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:47.200
You know, he was gonna be here a couple weeks ago, but something came up, so...

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:51.200
We gotta get him back on the show. We gotta get all our favorites back on the show.

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:53.200
We'll have our people go get him.

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:56.200
Yeah, we'll have our people talk to their people, etc, etc.

02:06:56.200 --> 02:07:00.200
So, there's some other news going out there in the music and rhythm game world.

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:04.200
We've just spent the past half-hour edition on DDR, but there are other games going on out there.

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:07.200
One thing I wanted to talk about, Tycho Drummaster, actually.

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:11.200
We've kind of mentioned this a couple times in the past few weeks.

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:14.200
Tycho Drummaster is going to have its release on Tuesday, we're hearing.

02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:16.200
Angel, you've been kind of reading about this one.

02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:18.200
Are you planning on picking this game up?

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:22.200
Yep, I'm going to try to pick it up.

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:26.200
One of the sites I usually frequent to buy games says that

02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:30.200
the illicit price is $69.99

02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:34.200
for PS2, obviously, you guys know that.

02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:38.200
However, it doesn't state that there's going to be a controller included like they did with

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:42.200
Donkey Konga for the GameCube.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:46.200
For $69.99, there damn well better be.

02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:51.860
one obviously so I'm 49.99 is the most I've ever heard them charging for video

02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:55.580
game and that's for top shelf games like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas things like

02:07:55.580 --> 02:08:01.620
that right hey but Rob you remember how much I played for Samba de Amigo back in

02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:07.100
the day paid 80 bucks for the US controller and what was the game 50 bucks

02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:12.460
for the game back in the day I think the only game I've seen more expensive to

02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:16.820
import was Para Para back when it was at its height when it was at its peak.

02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:23.620
My DDR second mix on Dreamcast when Dan bought it for me, the game was $75 and he spent $80

02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:34.300
on my dance pad and I sort of acquired somebody else's dance pad.

02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:40.500
Now if Namco is smart, they've got one song in Taiko Drum Master, they can be riding the

02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:43.420
wave of success off of one of their other games right now.

02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:51.940
That's right, Katamari Damacy, the Katamari on the Rocks theme, is in Taiko Drum Master,

02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:52.940
so who knows.

02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:55.420
See, now that little green guy, I bet you anything that little green guy is going to

02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:58.660
become a little spokesman for Namco, it's just...

02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.540
Nah, they're almost going to have Pac-Man.

02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:03.700
Well, yeah, of course, they've got their staple.

02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:05.180
The Namco's a pretty good company.

02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:06.300
The little OG?

02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:11.840
allowed to have more than one mascot just like Nintendo's got Mario and Link

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:17.420
Luigi and who the hell else they have and they got a ton of people. Not Mario, Wario!

02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:21.780
You finally got a chance to get your own copy of Kana Maridamashi this week

02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:27.220
right? Yeah. Yeah so did you were you playing it at all or you said you were

02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:31.700
watching? I was playing it some I played like at 3 a.m. I was like okay these mushrooms are

02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:35.100
tripping me out I'm going to bed. Are you see now I've talked about this a little

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.940
a little bit on Wednesdays outside the box with Rice Princess and Linky Style, but since

02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:41.220
we have a different crowd here, I gotta ask you guys, do you think that this game's jumping

02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:45.300
the shark a little bit? Like, and it's not the game itself, the game itself, wonderful,

02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:49.780
awesome game, but it's kinda like, it feels like it's become the internet's latest, like,

02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:54.220
mail-forward type thing, where it's like, it's really funny, but you're gonna get sick

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:58.060
of it, like, in a month. It's like, shut up about that goddamn ball rolling game already.

02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:08.620
I don't know. Nope. I'm sorry, but, you know, it is human nature to love smashing things

02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:14.940
with a ball. Rolling over stuff has been with us ever since the automobile. Since the automobile

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:20.180
can smash objects, like small squirrels and stuff, it's been our desire to find those

02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:24.700
small objects to roll over. And the fact that the ball is sticky and holds more objects

02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:32.380
to make an even larger ball that's even better that was beautiful I think I like

02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:41.740
running over buildings and picking up cows and the stupid dog that keeps

02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:46.460
trying to run into you okay I was in this one part where this dog kept like

02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:53.760
trying to butt into me so I ran over the dog later on and that was gratifying now

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:57.120
Now see in our chat room, here we go, we have one that says, I'm sick of it already.

02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:59.240
This is like Super Monkey Ball!

02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:00.240
Come on!

02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:01.600
Now see, Super Monkey Ball I never got into.

02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.160
Monkey Ball is cool.

02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:05.560
It's cute and all, but I never got into it.

02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:07.120
It's like the Parappa for this generation.

02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.960
Generation, what am I saying?

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:09.960
This year, you know?

02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:15.120
Because you know how Parappa hit and then kind of flew over, we're going to have like,

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.840
you know, Katamari Damacy 2 is coming out, and then there's going to be like, I think

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:18.840
a theme.

02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:24.600
There should be like, like Katamari Party.

02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:27.280
Mario Party, just with the little prince.

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:33.640
Uh, I was gonna say that, uh, the game's got its little cult following now, so it's kinda funny, but, um,

02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:39.400
I was gonna mention that VGCatch jumped on, jumped on it as soon as it got, you know, the game got released.

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:47.360
Uh, for those of you that don't know what VGCatch is, it took them quite a while, actually, to get on it.

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:53.360
Anyway, I was gonna say, VGCatch is a, like, online comic for video games and stuff. Anyway, yeah.

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:59.360
Interesting. Alright, uh, okay, let's get back on topic to talking about rhythm and music games here.

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:02.360
Loki had some things he wanted to talk about with you guys, some news that's going on.

02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:08.360
Now you, I guess there's some remix contests going on that just finished up. What happened with remixing?

02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:18.360
Both DDR, it's like DDR Remix, which is just DDR Maniac's contest, which didn't have quite a turn out as.

02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:22.360
But my sales remix contest 1.5 or whatever that was.

02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:26.360
But anyways, there was some pretty cool stuff that came out of those.

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:34.360
First I'll talk about the DDR Maniacs 1, the remix competition, because it's actually not done.

02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:46.360
They're not done. They're in voting right now, but they have the songs that were out there, so I'm going to play a few of these here. Actually, let me adjust my volume here.

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:56.360
There was actually only four people that entered this, which is kind of a little sad, a little, a little sad.

02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:05.360
There was two by, you know, you might recognize DJ Potato. I'm trying to find these here. What do I have?

02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:14.360
Didn't we have DJ Potato on the show a while back? Oh no, I know what it was. His interview with Thomas Howard. Didn't we air some of that a while back?

02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:19.940
a while back. Yeah, okay, yeah, sure we know who Digipotato is. Okay, so we had, we had

02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:25.320
some of those. I'm trying to think, let me look this up real quick. There was only five

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:32.040
entries. Two of them were his. They were actually, and I can play them for you guys, it was actually

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:37.400
some work that he did, sort of, kind of, with the Bemani Rock album, but not, it's just

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:47.120
piano and saxophone sort of remixes of, what the hell? What the hell was that? Yeah, give

02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:54.040
us a little clip of one of these songs here. Okay, well let's see here. We'll start off

02:13:54.040 --> 02:14:02.680
with, let's see how these are old. Oh, I know, I know. Okay, we're going to start off with

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:10.440
they had one of kind lady he actually a few of these he has like d2r 1998 kind

02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:15.560
lady there was another one too I can't remember what it was off hand but um

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:26.720
anyways let's see here okay this one right here is gonna be they're like DJ

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:36.100
a potato, a piano, a concentrato. Or is that? What? Shut up. Okay. I don't need your fancy

02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:43.240
English, English talk, okay? Shut up. It's Italian. Whatever. European. We do not formally

02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.340
recognize the European nations, okay? I just want you to know that. They do not exist to

02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:53.340
me. And you're psychotic with your English. Can I show you, I believe I think it's Italy

02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:58.020
right now is number three in our list of nations who's listening to this program when I was

02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:04.020
last looking at the geo-rankings. Watch your dirty little mouth, Loki. Whatever. Anyways,

02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:09.300
I was reading that quick, okay? I'm under pressure here. Anyway, this is DJ Potato featuring

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:16.300
Tony Miller, which I believe he's on sax.

02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:47.300
I like it. Keep in mind, I played saxophone for like twelve years.

02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:52.300
You're listening to KOLR Smooth Jazz.

02:15:52.300 --> 02:16:19.300
So that was that. Anyways, so, um, anyways, yeah, that was a few of the, that was one of the songs that was in there. There were some other remixes, but not a lot. Um, however, the Bomani style remix competition was a little different. There was quite a bit there. Um, I saved some of these really kickass ones on here, cause there was a few that were like, and even the judges said, what the hell is this? But, you know, there's always gonna be something like that.

02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:36.300
So, um, some of the ones I like to point out which were pretty cool, um, let's see here, um, some of them you've heard before on this show, uh, Clunk Clunk 2004, now that was, um, D.M. Ashura, and that was pretty sweet.

02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:56.300
Anyways, that one. And then we've got my personal favorite, Dazed and Destroyed. I loved this one before when there was only a clip of the song, but that's the whole thing.

02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:04.300
The second half is kinda, eh, it's okay, but I mean, it's pretty well done for, it's a remake of Hysteria, so pretty sweet.

02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:32.020
It's a really cool song, trust me on that.

02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:35.020
and he's making Bitter Beer Face.

02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:42.020
It's different. It's different, and it's well produced.

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:47.020
Well produced, maybe, but it sure isn't even a challenge. I'm worried.

02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:27.820
They sort of had an R&B version of Rainbow Flyer.

02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:37.820
Rainbow Flyer, the polychromatic allogum mix, let's see here, we've also got, but the winner,

02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:44.820
The winner of it all was Sextantbike with V1.

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:06.420
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same contest you were complaining about

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:11.960
out because they wouldn't allow fusion mixes and what won the damn contest now

02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:15.760
this was it's a little different now it's just they didn't want people just

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:21.660
using acid to throw two songs on top of each other however there were some songs

02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:26.400
in there that were two songs thrown on top of each other how that got in is

02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:30.780
beyond me because I specifically remembered in the rules that that's why

02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:36.280
I didn't enter. But whatever. I don't care. Contest is over. It's a little late.

02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:44.280
But anyways, so yeah, that was that. Um, you can find all these songs under the, um, music production forum on Bamai Style.

02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:49.280
There's a whole list of songs you can listen to, good and bad, and they're all on there. Pretty cool.

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:53.780
Um, one of the other songs that came out this week also was a remix of Vandy Angel by D'Amatura,

02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:56.780
because he can do no wrong, it seems like, with these.

02:19:56.780 --> 02:19:59.780
So anyways, I thought I'd play a little bit of that, because that's pretty sweet also.

02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:14.780
But, yeah, it's just, you know, a cool, like, long, trans universe, and it's just a trans song, so.

02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:20.780
But anyways, that was out. You can also find that in the Music Production Forum.

02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:25.780
Or you could listen to Monday Nights Diversion, the Orange Songs Radio Remake Show,

02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:32.780
because we'll definitely be adding some of these songs into our rotation there on Monday Nights from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:38.780
Now, and the other thing I wanted to mention, and we mentioned this way back in the show a while ago,

02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:44.780
about, what was it, it was DJ Potato's Bomani Rock album that was going to be coming out.

02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:50.900
me coming out. I have a few full tracks, actually, from that. So, there's a few I'd like to just

02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:57.300
preview real quick, and we'll also be throwing those in to rotation as well. Max 300.

02:20:57.300 --> 02:21:24.780
Alright, alright, alright, it's well done, don't get me wrong, but no more max.

02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:29.340
I need it! No more!

02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:32.340
The damn song keeps breeding, it's worse than Tribbles.

02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:39.340
This one is the one I like, Fear Train.

02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:58.960
This one is a little harder to find, I believe this was in the 2DX form, there's like a sample

02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:03.660
thing from the Bomani Rock album, you can find that also on Bomani style.

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:07.280
And that's pretty much all that's like music news.

02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:16.280
Now, there's a little other thing I read because we're talking about, you know, new arcade mixes and the set mania machine and in the groove and all that kind of stuff that kind of coincides with this.

02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:29.280
Now, for those who frequent the DDRUK.com site, you'll know that they created a set mania machine called DDX or Dance Dance X or whatever it is.

02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:40.640
Um, it's basically a StepMania arcade, um, game that they scanned. It looks really nice, and it was being played in a Namco, um, I think it was like a Namco cyberstation somewhere in England.

02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:44.280
And anyways, um, that's getting pulled out of there.

02:22:44.280 --> 02:23:12.760
Um, because- not because of like, you know, licensing issues and stuff, but it felt the same fate that the, um, Golf Land machine was, and that is, it's not being fixed by them, and it's just falling apart, and damaged, and so, it's- no, just, everyone out there know that problems with little kids trashing shit, it's worldwide. So, you know, there are bad parents everywhere.

02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:22.680
Oh, and you told me that it happened during break. I was hoping it was going to be a legal issue story, so we could have a little fun with that, but you're just saying some fucking punks ruined the machine.

02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:23.980
That's it.

02:23:23.980 --> 02:23:25.440
That is it. Sorry.

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:31.280
How boring! I wanted somebody to get sued! That would have been exciting.

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.980
So no plans to bring it back?

02:23:32.980 --> 02:23:35.380
They're just going to let it rot?

02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:43.580
Unfortunately, because what it was is, it was some guy's machine that he actually had brought there and let him, you know, use it and they would pay him some money.

02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:48.680
Well, they didn't pay him any money, and they trashed the machine, so he's getting pissed.

02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:56.080
But anyways, we will get a lawsuit story out of this after all! Hooray!

02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:02.180
Anyways, the other thing I wanted to talk about was, there was a bootleg that came out a few weeks ago, Dance Dance King.

02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:12.780
It looked like a really crappy bootleg machine from China that featured gold colored pads and stuff,

02:24:12.780 --> 02:24:19.520
and had, um, what else? Oh, and it's basically a second, er, second mix, um, consumer style

02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:27.400
machine that was running from, um, a PlayStation. Literally, a PS1 was inside this cabinet.

02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:32.840
And that was quite interesting. I happened to contact these people. They want to, now,

02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:40.720
it wasn't their idea, they say, to, you know, bring this, um, you know, bootleg over here,

02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:45.240
But the guy wants to make a legitimate mix that was kind of interesting. I thought

02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:48.920
Good luck

02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:52.880
So yeah, that's all the

02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:55.960
Miscellaneous baumannii stuff has been going on this week

02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:01.680
Next week. I have no idea. What's gonna be going on because I'll be playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:05.600
So Lester's baumannii in San Andreas

02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:08.600
I have no idea what's going on.

02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:10.600
Fair enough, because we're not having a show next Sunday, remember?

02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:13.600
It's Halloween, and we're giving all the people a night off so you can go trick-or-treating.

02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:16.600
We will have a marathon of old Orange Honest Radio episodes, though.

02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:20.600
A very scary Orange Honest Radio marathon for you guys next Sunday.

02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:21.600
I don't know how long that's going to run.

02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:25.600
Stay tuned to the website for details and when your show's there.

02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:28.600
You know, Nelly almost got me the bi-karaoke revolution, too.

02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:30.600
Then my wits came about me and I said,

02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:38.880
me I said fuck no I am NOT playing that game fair enough actually I want to ask

02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:42.040
you about this right chance at me a private message is she linked me to this

02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.600
thread over on freak that's showing this I don't know if you've seen this but it

02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:52.720
is a step mania computer put inside an 80s era ghetto blaster and they've got

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:57.460
the step mania logo painted over the speakers and this is actually computer

02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:00.360
it looks like a boombox in the front but look at the side that's a little

02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:03.360
You see this, Jamie? Look at that. Old school.

02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:06.360
That makes me think of the Nintendo computer.

02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:09.360
You remember when they were building a Nintendo out of laptop parts?

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:12.360
I'm sorry, building a computer out of a Nintendo shell and laptop parts.

02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:15.360
Yeah, it's the nice case mod.

02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:18.360
I thought of doing one like that, but putting it in Dreamcast.

02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:23.360
I still want one built out of a tool kit. A tool watch.

02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:25.360
Is that kind of thing hard to do?

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:31.180
do? When it comes to technical stuff, I don't know shit. I know how to put a radio station

02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:35.680
on the internet, but that's about it. So, Loki, tell me about, is this hard to do?

02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:41.140
Not if you have a Dremel tool. It's pretty much, even since that boombox was so big that

02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:47.060
they probably wouldn't even need to get a micro-ITX board. The micro-ITX ones that they

02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:53.900
have now are really small. They're only, I think the specifications for that are 15,

02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:57.660
I want to say, I think it's 17 centimeters by 17 centimeters.

02:26:57.660 --> 02:27:03.140
And looking at that, it looks like that is a micro ITX board in there.

02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:09.380
Yeah, so it's a micro ITX board, looks like a hard drive, power supply and everything.

02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:15.820
Looks like they've got the, it looks like they had a P4 version that was in there.

02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:17.880
I don't really know if that's the thing.

02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:21.960
They might have just added a fan to that just so it's cooled off a little bit more.

02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:25.820
I don't know. It's hard to tell by the picture. It looks like it could be a regular-sized

02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:30.080
motherboard, but I'm thinking it's probably a micro-ITX.

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:33.100
I like how they have the hard drive on top. That's very interesting. The hard drive's

02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:35.900
like separate from everything else. It's kind of interesting. I don't know if that's just

02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:41.920
the way they open it up or what. But look at this. It says it also includes a sound-sensitive

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:49.940
blue LED rod that kind of goes with the beat. But those little things go a long way in ghetto

02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:56.420
fabulousness don't they don't you think it's awesome I still wanted to do I

02:27:56.420 --> 02:28:01.220
wanted to make like a mini portable console system for like you know step

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:06.580
mania emulation games and just like a not really like almost like a laptop but

02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:12.740
not huh I'm never gonna do that though because I start too many projects all

02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:15.620
right well we're gonna go to a break when we come back from this break we got

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:18.580
to do the F use of the week don't you know oh but shouldn't I announce the

02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:21.780
winner of the orange launch radio cage match before we get to that because that was about

02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:26.780
an hour ago that we had the cage match. Tonight's winner of the orange launch radio cage match

02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:36.500
is Ian Vandal with Reason. So there you have it. Just because Loki picks a funny one doesn't

02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:45.660
mean he wins it. So too bad. I'm glad I haven't won that in at least a while. So at least

02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:51.300
a month I know that much so cool well we'll be hearing that one again next

02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:56.740
week along with two other lovely new songs oh no not next week oh yeah by

02:28:56.740 --> 02:29:00.860
default it's gonna win for two weeks now so we'll be back in two weeks to try and

02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:04.900
to throw in Ian Vandal in the meantime we're gonna take a break for right now

02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:07.580
when we come back we're gonna do the F use of the week in this break well I

02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:11.420
figured we did some DDR some 2dx how about some popin music specifically I

02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:17.900
I dug through my Papa Music 9 folder for some songs, and we're gonna kick it off with Ryu

02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:24.980
and Noria with Shining. Enjoy. Huh? I thought there was an extra letter in there. My bad.

02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:27.980
Ryu, I'm white. Forgive me. We'll be back.

02:30:54.980 --> 02:30:56.980
That's not easy

02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:00.980
That's not easy

02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:02.980
That's not easy

02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:36.980

02:32:48.980 --> 02:32:50.980
Thank you for watching.

02:32:50.980 --> 02:32:58.940
Even if you don't believe in me, you're gonna find me in no other place

02:32:58.940 --> 02:33:02.940
I don't know why,

02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:00.940
I

02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:40.220
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:44.140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:50.900
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:56.000
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and believe it or not we're coming into the home

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:03.000
stretch of the show, but no show would be complete without a little bit of angst.

02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:09.000
And that means it's time for the FUs of the week. Jamie, why do we have to do these FUs

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
of the week every single week?

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:18.000
because we're full of angst.

02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:31.680
First F.U. goes to my laundry

02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:37.320
for not being dry yet until damp.

02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:40.560
Another F.U. goes toward being exhausted, drained,

02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:50.280
worn out, you name it. F.U. to stress. Big F.U. to stress. F.U. to people in minivans

02:36:50.280 --> 02:37:04.560
who drive 30 in a 50 mile an hour zone. And just stupidity. And uh, distance, time, money.

02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:11.560
I don't really have anything specific.

02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:18.560
Alright, then we'll move on to Loki.

02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:20.560
Um...

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:26.680
First off, you know, it's, like, every week, you know, fucking the drivers, cause,

02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:37.680
God, they're so awful and fulsome. I just don't know what it is. They just don't pay attention to any of the stop signs, lights, road signs, nothing. They just... stupid.

02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:45.680
So, fuck you then. Um, fuck you to my car, because the engine light came on the other day, and I don't know why.

02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:54.680
Well, actually, I do know why, because it was out of coolant, but I fixed that, and I hope it doesn't break down, because, you know, I need good karma around my car.

02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:59.180
I don't want to have to, like, have it break. That would suck.

02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:07.180
Um, then on more personal notes, and, you know, I apologize to any of the people that are listening for my work,

02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:10.680
because I think there might be one or two. Maybe one.

02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:17.680
Anyways, um, what do you do, um, BPD for firing, uh, Nelly from The Mill Room?

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:23.680
It's really funny because I do know the reasons behind it, and it was really stupid why they did it.

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.720
and there's a lot of people there that have done a lot worse and are still there and it's just

02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:33.920
retarded so but whatever she's probably gonna end up getting something better in the long run so

02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:38.320
that's cool but there's just a lot of people i have lots of respect for from that and that sucks

02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:47.760
then finally uh just uh i'm sorry fuck you to the rain because uh

02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:51.360
wet outside and i can't work on my cabinet not that i would work on my cabinet anyways if it

02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:58.360
it wasn't raining. I'm just tired, that's it.

02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:04.920
Alright, I'm going back to my old F.U. song, because the new one,

02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:09.920
William Hung, just wasn't working out, so I'm going back to my old song.

02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:16.060
Why aren't we just talking about how we didn't really care for this song, Jamie?

02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:19.560
Why don't you pick another one?

02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:23.420
I'm feeling uncreative tonight because I just like the fact that it goes all things keep

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:31.040
getting better and you know it's the FUs of the week.

02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:36.320
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, no maybe later.

02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:38.600
I know you need to have the Veruca Salt song.

02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:39.600
Ooh I like Veruca Salt.

02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:41.600
I won't do that.

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:44.640
Maybe I'll have to do that, that would be cute.

02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:49.320
I'm never that angsty though and honestly to be honest this week is much different.

02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:53.520
I'm just, I'm gonna say F you to the fact that I've been really insanely busy this week

02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:56.720
and I haven't had time to do all the things that I want to do and F you to the fact that

02:39:56.720 --> 02:39:59.720
I haven't been able to hang out with certain people as much as I would like to be able

02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:04.360
to because of the fact that, you know, they're working and I'm working and I got the radio

02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:07.600
stuff and et cetera, et cetera, so that kind of sucks.

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:11.680
There needs to be more hours in the day and then people shouldn't have to work as much

02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:13.320
and then keep the same salary.

02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:18.480
I realize I'm living in La La Land but I really don't have anything realistic this week.

02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:22.960
actually been a pretty decent week it's really busy except F you to the people

02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:26.760
that went saw the grudge at 930 on Friday night in Roseville because you

02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:31.080
all were too damn loud and F you to that guy I had to yell at in the middle of the

02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:36.000
movie although that did make me feel really good I think getting the applause

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.440
like that when I told that guy to shut the hell up felt really really good

02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:45.720
there's just not a lot of rushes like that you get in the world so if you do

02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:51.320
that movie as well for making people scream. People were too damn loud with that movie

02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:54.720
and it was giving me a headache. Oh, F you to the fact, I know why, F you to the fact

02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:59.040
that the projectionist or something, the film was damaged or the projection was going on

02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:05.120
because for 20 goddamn minutes the movie was bouncing up and down like it was shaking.

02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:08.120
Like imagine if you were trying to watch something on a projection screen and it was shaking

02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:11.640
like an earthquake. I swear to God it was giving me a headache after like one minute

02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:15.720
having to watch it like that. And we go and complain. Loki actually went in and complained

02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:20.720
and what do they tell you? Uh, yeah, it's only gonna do that for 20 minutes. Uh, we

02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:27.040
got the defective reel from the studio, but hey, we're getting a new one that replaces

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:34.040
soon. Sorry. Uh-uh. No. Fuck you and your fucking bitch-ass whore-cunt for fucking making

02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:41.480
me pay 9.25 plus a $1.25 Fandango fee, because I don't like fucking lines at your movie theater.

02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:47.160
theater. Fuck you for making me pay that. I want a perfect god damn theater experience.

02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:51.920
You know what? You should ask for the manager. I know. I should write a letter and complain.

02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:57.600
Do it. I just might. You should ask for the manager's boss then. They all asked for just

02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:06.600
I didn't. I did. Who knew? I had this rage pent up in me and I forgot all about it. I

02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:11.440
pushed it to the back of my mind and you people brought it out of me. RAGE! I got a free ticket.

02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:18.080
it for complaining about them turning on the light at the end of the credits for the Matrix.

02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:22.440
I'll write a nasty letter. Because you know what, I can't, I think I had one other bad

02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:25.560
experience at theater and I can't remember what it was, but I bet if I went through the

02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:30.880
F.U. archives of the show I could find it. Mention the three magic words. Better Business

02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:37.800
Bureau. Or I'll mention these magic words. Fuck you whore for making me pay so much money

02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:40.920
for going to see a sub-par production.

02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:43.160
I want everything in pristine condition.

02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:45.240
You're gonna, it's highway robbery.

02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:47.400
No wonder people pirate your goddamn movies.

02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:50.280
Here's my thing, okay, it was playing

02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:53.000
on like six to eight screens in there.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.280
Take out the bad film, play it less.

02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:00.360
Oh my God, five screens, how will we survive?

02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:02.880
I mean, seriously, just play it less.

02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:05.240
Play another, I'm sure more people

02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:08.240
I wanted to see a shark's tail, so go ahead and play that instead.

02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:12.240
I mean, they could have easily taken this out of rotation, but instead they were like,

02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:14.240
Ah, fuck it, no one's gonna care.

02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:20.240
Alright.

02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:25.240
Let's move on and go to the other angsty folks in our studio right now.

02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:27.240
We'll start it off with DDR Angel.

02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:30.240
Nice attempt to burp, Ryan.

02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:32.240
Haha, it's okay.

02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:37.420
Um, just a few just being tired today. I don't even know what's up. Everybody seems tired today

02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:42.720
I don't know just there's no reason for it. I shouldn't be tired, but I am

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:47.560
Again if you did the flaky instructor that I've got

02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:52.600
But whatever he's still deciding the whole class every once in a while

02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:56.400
Maybe he'll get over it and realize. Oh wait. I haven't job

02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:02.400
Um, that's about it. I'm, like, not angsty. What the hell?

02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:09.400
You're not really ever that angsty, Angel. I've only seen you angsty here one time, and it took an act of God to make you angsty?

02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:14.400
Alright. Bradley, Arcadian42, what's on your mind?

02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:18.400
Of course, fuck you to, uh, FolsomPD and...

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:19.400
Surprise!

02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:26.400
Yes, fuck you to all that and all, fuck you to me for getting myself into that, in that

02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:32.680
situation and all the decisions and delays and everything that caused it and yeah, so

02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:39.680
forth. Uh, what else? Uh, fuck you to having to make up all that time, but at least my

02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:44.680
but at least my work is nice and they'll let me make up time

02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:49.680
fuck you to the honey back ribs or whatever

02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:54.680
the new thing at Applebee's for sucking

02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:59.680
not honey, it's like honey barbecue ribs

02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:04.680
actually it was a rib thing but it sucked

02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:08.680
It was a new rib thing, but it sucked.

02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:12.680
It was like, bleh.

02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:17.680
But at least it was free, because it was the free lunch day at work.

02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.680
So at least I didn't have to pay that money for it.

02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:26.680
And, uh, yeah.

02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:31.680
Actually, just R.O.D. for the TV.

02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:38.160
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, of which I haven't gotten very many tonight,

02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:41.920
surprisingly enough, so if they don't get in in the next 30 seconds or so, they're probably

02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:45.640
not getting read, but that's alright, we have a few.

02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:52.780
Ry Chan says, F you to friends borrowing things and not returning them. F you to people that

02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:57.880
drive in the fast lane and are going 15 miles an hour under the speed limit. F you to loners.

02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.880
F you to people that continue to try to use you for all your worth and can't take a hint when I say no.

02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:06.880
Oh, and F you to taking a frisbee to the lip.

02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:08.880
Ow. Ow.

02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:11.880
What, Loki?

02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:14.880
If you're not a dog, you can't catch it with your mouth.

02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:17.880
I don't think, something tells me she wasn't trying to do that.

02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:19.880
You know what, though? You know what's a lot safer?

02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:22.880
What were those things that are like, frisbees? Did they go for the, uh, robies?

02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:23.880
What were those things called?

02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:26.880
Yeah, it's like throwing a giant saw blade at your head.

02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:28.880
That's the best thing ever.

02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:30.880
The Nerf ones, the plastic ones.

02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:35.880
Yeah, the Nerf ones are the best ones because it just feels like you're throwing like a fish at you or something like that.

02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:39.880
But yeah, the Robies are fucking dangerous because they go faster and they're like more streamlined.

02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:43.880
Like seriously, it's like a saw blade getting thrown at you.

02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:46.880
But they're awesome, you can throw them on the park.

02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:48.880
Alright.

02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.880
Didn't they have a Robies that were shaped in like strange shapes too, like diamonds and stuff?

02:46:53.880 --> 02:47:09.880
I only heard half of tonight's show. Unacceptable. Fired. That's fine. He does good news for

02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:17.500
the website. Jazz says F you to the fact that the projection people didn't turn off the

02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:21.640
lights for like 15 minutes into the movie and the fact that the grudge was more funny

02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:29.320
even scary and the rest of my audience agreed. I thought the grudge was scary, I don't know

02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:34.880
if the grudge was really scary. But that's it, he reminded me of the other thing. When

02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:39.800
I went and saw, I think it was, I want to say it was Kill Bill 2 over there, they didn't

02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:44.000
turn off the goddamn lights. That's what it was, it was Kill Bill 2. Yeah, when I went

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:47.560
and saw Kill Bill 2, they didn't turn off the goddamn lights for like 15 minutes. And

02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:51.280
you would think such a little thing would not be so annoying, but it was really, really

02:47:51.280 --> 02:48:00.560
annoying. Thank you Jazz for reigniting that angst within me. Lastly, Poto says F you to

02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:08.640
writing a paper on two hours of sleep. Aww. Aww. I remember being such a procrastinator

02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:11.640
like that, still am. I remember staying up all night. I'm doing my paper during my lunch

02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:17.960
break tomorrow, and it's due tomorrow night. Amen to that. Alright. I'm not going to class

02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:28.400
I guess what we should do, let's open up the skype line because for god's sake we haven't

02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:32.680
had it open the whole show except for that long chat we had with frequency, basically

02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:37.280
frequency took all your skype time tonight ladies and gentlemen, no I'm kidding, we'll

02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:42.240
open it up a little bit for the folks to talk to us on skype, so skype's open, if you want

02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:47.120
more information on skype head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact

02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:50.720
with us. We definitely would like your feedback to anything we've talked about during tonight's

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:54.840
show, including lots of stuff that we had talked to Frequency about earlier, as well

02:48:54.840 --> 02:49:00.080
as, you know, other news, the Bomani remix contests, and machines breaking down, and

02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:03.480
kids in arcades, and projectionists that don't know how to tromp the goddamn light when the

02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:08.560
movie starts. Anyway, sorry. Getting a little bit off tangent there. Also, we will accept

02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:12.920
your Ask Orange Lounge questions over private messages chat if you guys have anything you

02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:16.120
want to ask us. We only have a couple minutes left, so we're not going to make an official

02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:18.620
segment but if you have some questions you'd like us to address go ahead and

02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:23.040
send those in I'd also like to add that everything Sam Raimi touches turns to

02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:29.280
gold and his car ends up in all of his movies damn it I didn't look for it in

02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:32.720
the garage but I don't know if that really counts because he just produced

02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:37.680
the movie this car might be in there I I'm being told right now in our chat

02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:45.080
room that right now our very show is being played inside a truck stop awesome

02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:50.080
So we'd like to give a big YEE-HAW to all our truckin' buddies down there.

02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:53.080
No, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding. Please don't beat me up.

02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:58.080
No, but I guess we have somebody listening on a network over at the truck stop right now.

02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:01.080
I want to go to the truck stop. They have good food.

02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:03.080
I want hash food. They have good food over at the truck stop.

02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:04.080
Oh my God, Bob. Let's go get food.

02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:07.080
Do they have riblets? I want riblets. I don't think they have riblets.

02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:12.080
But I need to be watching my weight because I have a performance to do on Saturday.

02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:14.780
Oh, come on, eat healthy food, get some fitness with it.

02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:17.580
I gotta work early tomorrow. If I didn't have to work early tomorrow, I would totally do it.

02:50:17.580 --> 02:50:19.580
I can, I have to work at 6.30.

02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:22.580
What? Sorry.

02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:27.580
Anyway, we're supposed to watch the language, because we're being broadcast to the truck stop right now, so...

02:50:27.580 --> 02:50:28.580
You know.

02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:30.580
Don't give in to me!

02:50:30.580 --> 02:50:34.580
Alright, I'll keep the mic away from Logie, if that's the case.

02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:42.020
Oh, I didn't even check the Skype thing to see if anybody called. Nope! Still wide open

02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:44.780
there. Well, I guess nobody wants to call us tonight. That's fine. That's fine. We'll

02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:48.540
just talk to ourselves. We'll amuse ourselves here. That's fine. Any big Halloween plans

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:53.300
for you, Loki? Just having a get-together over here. We're gonna watch Shaun of the

02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:58.900
Dead because I got my lovely promo copy of that, and that's gonna rock. Shaun of the

02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:03.820
Dead. I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try because the people are gonna have alcohol. I'm gonna

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:07.820
I tried to slip in one of my bad movies in there, but I don't think they're gonna go for it.

02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:11.820
No one wants to watch my bad movies, and that makes me sad.

02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:15.820
I spend good money on those, and goddamnit, if, you know,

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:19.820
no one wants to watch, uh, was it, uh, Blood Sisters of Lesbian Sin,

02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:23.820
you know, who will?

02:51:23.820 --> 02:51:27.820
I'll watch it. Just to see what the hell it is.

02:51:27.820 --> 02:51:31.820
I have a question. How many people are coming to this get-together?

02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:40.660
don't know. Where are they all going to fit? Uh, I don't know. Interesting, very- Sit on

02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:49.620
the floor, goddammit, because I'm taking language! Gosh darn it! Much better, much better. Alright.

02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:57.300
Uh, Bradley, you have any exciting Halloween plans? Nope. Sit on my ass at home, do nothing.

02:51:57.300 --> 02:51:59.300
Sounds like a plan to me.

02:51:59.300 --> 02:52:01.300
You know what I'm doing?

02:52:01.300 --> 02:52:03.300
That's a fabulous idea. Let's take out the airazooka.

02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:07.300
You can put candy in it and it launches the candy.

02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:11.300
I've got like three days of Halloween because we're doing the big thing at work.

02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:13.300
I have my catgirl costume.

02:52:13.300 --> 02:52:18.300
And then I'm having Rocky on Saturday.

02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:24.300
And probably Sunday I'm just going to sit around and watch Interview with the Vampire on laserdisc.

02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:26.300
There you go.

02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:31.220
Of course, if you're in the Sacramento area, you should definitely check out furtherindignities.org

02:52:31.220 --> 02:52:34.140
for the information on a Halloween tradition.

02:52:34.140 --> 02:52:38.020
Rocky Orpix show is going to be in UC Davis and several of your buddies from Warren's

02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:40.860
Knowledge Radio are involved with that because that was the thing we did before we played

02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:42.780
DDR and did this show.

02:52:42.780 --> 02:52:44.500
And it's still going on.

02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:48.100
So check that out if you're in the area.

02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:52.220
Also what else I want to say, oh, remember the follow up from last week.

02:52:52.220 --> 02:52:56.220
Remember we were talking about, in case you guys weren't listening last week, but we were

02:52:56.220 --> 02:53:02.140
We were talking about how we were going to do DDR on the big screen at some point.

02:53:02.140 --> 02:53:05.500
We were going to take that same movie screen and possibly have a Bimani night in the movie

02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:09.500
theater and possibly do a live taping of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:11.100
Outlook is very good on that.

02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:14.740
We're hoping to get some help from other friends of ours within the Bimani community to kind

02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:16.260
of make that a success.

02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:20.960
But just like the TV show thing that had come up earlier, we're having a hard time figuring

02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:24.340
out exactly what we're going to do besides a live episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:26.340
Let's set the ferret on fire!

02:53:28.340 --> 02:53:30.340
He said, let's set a virgin on fire.

02:53:31.340 --> 02:53:33.340
Let's set a virgin's pants on fire.

02:53:36.340 --> 02:53:38.340
Let's set the ferret on fire, that's what we need to do.

02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:41.340
My babies! Where's my babies?

02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:43.340
I don't even know where the ferrets are.

02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:44.340
Do you want to be my baby?

02:53:44.340 --> 02:53:46.340
No, I won't have to be your baby, you have to get out and get it.

02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:50.340
No, don't do it, don't be your slave.

02:53:50.340 --> 02:53:52.340
Don't be your slave!

02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:54.340
Let's let people go!

02:53:57.340 --> 02:54:03.340
Okay, that's one suggestion that's come up, is that Katamari Damacy gets played on the big screen.

02:54:03.340 --> 02:54:04.340
Okay.

02:54:04.340 --> 02:54:07.340
Somehow, we'll have to have some kind of little contest.

02:54:07.340 --> 02:54:10.340
Oh, they have two player mode. We could have a Katamari Damacy tournament or something.

02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:12.340
He can play as the cousins.

02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:15.340
There you go. I'm liking this so far. I'm liking it.

02:54:17.340 --> 02:54:18.340
Alright.

02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:22.340
I got choir people that go da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:26.340
We'll get the UC Davis choir in on it. That'll be fun.

02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:30.340
Alright, we're gonna take a real quick break.

02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:34.340
We're gonna do a one-song break, then we're gonna come back and wrap up the show.

02:54:34.340 --> 02:54:38.340
What song should we do here in this break? Let's do...

02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:42.340
Well, we did pop and we didn't do a Guitar Freak song.

02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:45.340
What?

02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:49.340
Loki wants to play his remix again. Fine. Fair enough. That makes for a good one song break.

02:54:49.340 --> 02:54:53.340
Tell us one more time about your remix that you didn't enter into any contest because you...

02:54:53.340 --> 02:54:56.340
I don't know. You don't enter contests or something?

02:54:56.340 --> 02:55:00.340
Well, this is just my newest one. It's the preview one off of the next album,

02:55:00.340 --> 02:55:06.340
which I was trying today to upload my new album, and fucking A, it will not work, okay?

02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:09.340
Language! Language!

02:55:09.340 --> 02:55:11.340
Yes, I am speaking English.

02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:26.340
Okay, anyways, um, so, Golly Gee Willikers, it would not, you know, upload to the, to the, um, server, and, um, so yeah, I couldn't make it available for people to download, and that made me sad.

02:55:26.340 --> 02:55:40.340
Um, and you said it sucks, okay, that's what I want to say. But anyways, this is, um, Paranoid Revolution, um, be sure you put in the one that's just Revolution and MP3, because I changed it a few times.

02:55:40.340 --> 02:55:50.340
Alright, alright.

02:56:10.340 --> 02:56:17.340
paranoia revolution. Enjoy, and we'll be back to wrap up the show after this.

02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:54.340
Now that I'm prepared to bust back

02:57:54.340 --> 02:58:04.340
Now that I'm prepared to bust back

02:59:04.340 --> 02:59:19.580
Now, it's Paranoia Revolution here on Orange Lounge Radio, remixed by our very own Noki.

02:59:19.580 --> 02:59:20.580
You know what I realized?

02:59:20.580 --> 02:59:27.420
The bass line in that kind of reminds me of Tsugaru, like it has the same rhythm, listen

02:59:27.420 --> 02:59:28.420
to it towards the end.

02:59:28.420 --> 02:59:32.300
actually has the part you know in paranoia is where it's all where it's all

02:59:32.300 --> 02:59:38.100
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo has that throughout the whole thing yeah

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:45.220
so it's like a was it a 12th notes and then like some fourth oh it's pretty

02:59:45.220 --> 02:59:48.500
cool it's just it's a little bit um tweaked off of that that's in the

02:59:48.500 --> 02:59:52.900
background I know for most of it obviously cuz I made it but um I don't

02:59:52.900 --> 03:00:11.900
Now, that's all that's done on the second thing right now, but they'll all be available to download, along with my nice cover art and whatnot, and you can put together your own CD, like I did in the studio, because, like hell, if I'm gonna make more and, like, you know, send them out to people, I just don't do that.

03:00:11.900 --> 03:00:19.420
Alright, well, we've got to wrap up the show here, so we've got to go around and get everybody's

03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:20.420
final thought.

03:00:20.420 --> 03:00:21.820
We'll start off with DDR Angel.

03:00:21.820 --> 03:00:24.740
DDR Angel, what is your final thought?

03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:35.240
Um, Katamari Damacy, because I can't stop playing.

03:00:35.240 --> 03:00:38.180
Final thought from Bradley.

03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:40.180
You go last, right?

03:00:40.180 --> 03:00:55.180
I have none at the moment. They're gone, they're gone, they're gone, they're gone.

03:00:55.180 --> 03:01:01.180
Alright, Loki your final thought. There's gonna be too many games I gotta buy this week.

03:01:01.180 --> 03:01:09.180
I got Neo Contra and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and actually maybe not. I wasn't gonna get Tony Hawk's Underground 2,

03:01:09.180 --> 03:01:13.180
Maybe I might get that, but Need for Speed Underground 2, no.

03:01:13.180 --> 03:01:15.180
DarkSakura, your final thought?

03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:22.180
I have games to play, like I have Katamari Damacy now, I have Sims 2, and you know what?

03:01:22.180 --> 03:01:31.180
Real life is taking up all my time, so I've had to focus on school, everything, so...

03:01:31.180 --> 03:01:37.180
There is a world outside of video games, not much one, and it usually sucks, but there is one.

03:01:37.180 --> 03:01:41.380
Alright, my final thought is, don't forget to listen to our other shows on Monday night,

03:01:41.380 --> 03:01:44.860
Diversion, the Orange Mountains Radio Remix show, Tuesday night, pump up the volume with

03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:49.420
Dark Sakura, 7 o'clock Pacific Time, and, oh I'm sorry, 7 o'clock for pre-show, 7.30

03:01:49.420 --> 03:01:55.640
for show, and Wednesday nights on Orange Mountains Radio, Outside the Box, with a special Grand

03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:57.420
Theft Auto San Andreas update!

03:01:57.420 --> 03:02:00.940
Yes, very special Grand Theft Auto San Andreas update.

03:02:00.940 --> 03:02:03.860
That's the show on the station where we talk about the other games, other than the stomp

03:02:03.860 --> 03:02:05.900
your feet and tap your fingers games.

03:02:05.900 --> 03:02:09.860
So we'll get to all that on Wednesday, and Tuesday, Jamie I'm sure will have another

03:02:09.860 --> 03:02:15.760
fun show, and Monday remixes, Thursday Orange Islands Radio Rewind, another night of programming

03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.960
is coming to Orange Islands Radio soon, that's all I have to say, and also the Long Versions

03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:27.240
program is gonna launch hopefully sometime this week, but like next week at the latest.

03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:31.880
So we're gonna have a Long Version program that's gonna be at lunchtime for an hour.

03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:34.880
Rob, real quick question here, uh, in the studio.

03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:38.880
Um, what about the, um, see here spot thing?

03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:40.880
Eh, okay, never mind.

03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:42.880
Nothing to see here, move along. Oh, and,

03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:47.880
should mention, when you're, um, you know, not listening to Orange Knowledge Radio,

03:02:47.880 --> 03:02:50.880
New South Park coming to Comedy Central.

Hooray, hooray, okay.

03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:55.880
The last word of this show, I'm gonna give it to Loki.

03:02:55.880 --> 03:02:59.880
Loki, the last word of tonight's show, one word that sums it all up for our listeners.

03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:01.880
I can't do it alone.

03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:02.880
Fuck yeah!

03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:08.880

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:31.880
Whenever my life gets me so down, I know I can go down.

03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:34.880
Down, down, down, where the fun never ends.

03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:39.880
As long as the music keeps playing, you know what I'm saying.

03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:44.880
I know that I can find a friend.

03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:47.880
Shut up the roundhouse.

03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:54.880
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:40.520
I thought that was a gospel song at first, and then I realized what it was. I didn't

03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:43.720
realize they sung the theme around us like that. I thought they actually had a little

03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:45.560
synthesized thing.

03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:48.000
No, because the show fucking rocked

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.760
and then they took it off air like they do everything that's good on Nickelodeon.

03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:55.620
They need to have Nick retro with the old

03:04:55.620 --> 03:04:59.400
shows like Salute Your Shorts, you know,

03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:00.900
fucking

03:05:00.900 --> 03:05:03.040
Hey Dude and all that stuff.

03:05:03.040 --> 03:05:06.680
They need to put that back on air because they've got like, you know, the stupid

03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:08.400
noggin crap with like

03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:12.000

03:05:20.920 --> 03:05:25.640

03:05:25.640 --> 03:05:27.760

03:05:35.720 --> 03:05:38.380
show is fabulous

03:05:38.380 --> 03:05:40.760
at first a reason it makes me think

03:05:40.760 --> 03:05:43.240
yet god yes you can sit on television why

03:05:43.240 --> 03:05:47.120

03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:51.900

03:05:51.900 --> 03:05:58.380
and we also

03:05:58.380 --> 03:06:02.120
you know this never get that the fact that

03:06:02.120 --> 03:06:05.080
I'll come back one.

03:06:05.080 --> 03:06:06.840
Exactly.

03:06:06.840 --> 03:06:10.280
Thank God for the internet, because I'm hoping more and more old-school you can't do that

03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:14.040
on television episodes start showing up, because I found a couple online once, or somebody

03:06:14.040 --> 03:06:15.040
gave me some.

03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:16.040
I don't remember what it was.

03:06:16.040 --> 03:06:17.040
Did you give me some?

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:18.040
Angel gave me some.

03:06:18.040 --> 03:06:19.040
Oh, so great.

03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:20.040
I need to get more.

03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:21.040
That show was so freaking fabulous.

03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:23.200
I get my Ouija board back this week.

03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:26.240
Dude, the dungeon scenes of you can't do that on television.

03:06:26.240 --> 03:06:27.240
That's all I gotta say.

03:06:27.240 --> 03:06:30.560
Or the arcades.

03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:38.460
all about barf that kind of rocks poor guy I think isn't he dead poor guy he

03:06:38.460 --> 03:06:44.000
was awesome so underappreciated and peewee you know fucking peewees play out

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:47.440
seems to come back I don't care if he's a fucking pervert and child molester you

03:06:47.440 --> 03:06:51.220
know what this is this is a conversation I was having my friend the other day

03:06:51.220 --> 03:06:54.400
we're talking about Michael Jackson okay yeah the guy's really fucked up yeah

03:06:54.400 --> 03:06:58.400
okay maybe he slept with some children yeah that does not make his music bad

03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:04.400
Just because someone's a child molester does not mean that they cannot make bad, or make good music.

03:07:04.400 --> 03:07:09.400
It's just like Pee Wee Herman. Okay, so he's into child pornography and all this stuff.

03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:15.400
Does not mean the show was bad. You, people are confusing the art with the person.

03:07:15.400 --> 03:07:20.400
I don't go around, you know, saying, you know, I don't like that music because that guy's an alcoholic.

03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:25.400
You know, I don't like that music because I don't like the sound of it. Not, I don't like the person.

03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:30.400
People need to separate the person from the music. That's what I think.

03:07:30.400 --> 03:07:38.400
Some comments from the chat room. Danger Mouse and Count Ducula.

03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:41.400
Yeah, Count Ducula.

03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:43.400
Duck Man needs to come back.

03:07:43.400 --> 03:07:45.400
Yeah, Duck Man, definitely.

03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:49.400
Alright. Yeah, enough memory lane stuff.

03:07:49.400 --> 03:07:53.400
Coming to DVDs soon, Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Full House.

03:07:53.400 --> 03:07:58.400
For all you sick pedophiles out there like the Olsen twins.

03:07:59.400 --> 03:08:02.400
When do I get my Golden Girls DVDs? When are those out?

03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:03.400
They're already out.

03:08:03.400 --> 03:08:05.400
What? What?

03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:06.400
I need Wonder Woman.

03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:10.400
Bitch, what? What? My Golden Girls DVDs are already out and I don't have them? What?

03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:14.400
I think they come out Tuesday, or I think they're already out. They were coming out in October.

03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:52.080
Alright, that's it we're going to pull the plug on the show now and we're going to go

03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:54.360
to tonight's post show.

03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:59.360
You guys seem to like the Dance Mania stuff, so we're going to do Dance Mania X7 tonight.

03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:03.480
There's a lot of fun songs on here, including some fourth mix songs, if you can believe

03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:04.480

03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:08.840
