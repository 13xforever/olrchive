254605	254845	Also...
255888	256108	What?
257589	258871	The mic doesn't pick you up for some reason.
258911	258971	Ah!
258991	261132	There you go, now we can hear you.
262233	264075	I'm actually in a good mood.
264115	264415	Good!
264836	266677	You looked really pooped earlier today.
267118	273583	Good, and I'm still tired, and I still got some of the crap to do, but... I feel exhausted right now.
275465	277987	Given what you were doing earlier, though, I wouldn't blame you.
278827	280589	Well, maybe we'll share that with our listeners a little later.
280629	280969	Hold on, wait.
281249	281610	Wait, wait.
281970	282891	I have something to share with listeners.
282951	284092	Okay.
288343	293348	Yes, burping wars and more on tonight's episode.
293368	297732	Oh, but first, it's very, very sparkling water.
297792	298853	I don't think you like this stuff.
299874	300895	Yeah, I don't drink soda.
300996	304439	I drink Crystal Geyser sparkling mineral water.
304879	305220	Why?
305300	307242	Because I like to feign this diet I'm on.
307302	310645	Anyway, also joining us as always,
311638	315020	The third wheel of our program, our tech master, Loki.
318662	319182	Oh, excuse me.
319722	320623	Something in my throat there.
321884	323324	Anyways, hi.
324225	325225	Get the dick out of your mouth.
325285	326426	It's time to start the show.
329828	330708	I like gummy bears.
331149	332009	That makes me sad.
334110	337292	Also joining us tonight, we have a couple of special guests.
337967	339808	They like to come to this show quite often here.
339828	341828	I'm trying to get them a mic here.
342828	343769	DDR Angel's here.
343829	346549	Hiya.
346730	347150	Here again.
347250	349370	I'm starting to become a regular.
349410	349830	Be afraid.
350591	352411	Don't you have anything else to do on Sunday night?
352431	357573	Don't you have villages to burn and convenience stores to rob?
357593	359333	Hey, I'm an angel.
359433	360713	I'm not speaking to you like that.
360934	361074	Yes!
367076	368776	Yeah, this is the show needed.
368816	370677	Loki went and bought an Arashuka this week.
372517	377278	Also joining us, say hello to RKDN42, also known as Bradley.
379218	380158	Alright.
380658	382119	You have a car this week, right?
382739	383379	Oh, good to hear.
383419	383639	Alright.
387380	387660	Alright.
388900	390160	I think your mic might be cut out.
390180	390740	Grab the bottom.
393761	394601	Why am I not hearing it?
396064	396624	Oh, hello then.
396684	397945	Hello, hello, hello.
397985	400086	That was weird.
400106	401226	Yes, I have a car now.
402226	402847	Very strange.
403187	405348	And we'll get to tell the whole story after the break.
405448	407628	Alright, sounds good.
408009	409249	A little bit of Imani news.
410450	413891	Somebody made an oopsie and we figured out one new Ultramix 2 song.
413911	415391	So we'll be sharing that with you guys tonight.
415972	421114	And I guess all that and whatever else we can come up with until the next three hours.
421494	424595	But first, we're going to do a little bit of a break.
426274	428236	And what kind of music should we do in this break?
428316	433280	I feel like doing some 5K Beatmania stuff.
433320	434341	So let's start off with this.

783082	784602	This lovely October evening.
785682	786842	I'm so tired today.
787942	790023	I don't know if I've got three hours worth in me.
790483	795044	It's going to be like squeezing the sponge to get the last little drop out.
796843	797443	But I will do it.
797783	799944	For the listeners, I will force myself.
801325	802766	And if you don't do it for them, we'll force you.
802966	804546	That's right.
804586	808588	We're going to start off tonight's show as we start off every week playing a little bit of How was your week?
808688	809329	How was your day?
809369	812830	A chance for you to catch up with us and our personal lives.
812870	815051	You can be nosy and invade our personal lives.
815151	817952	And we'll start by opening up the file on Jamie.
818873	821294	My week was all busy crap.
821934	823255	Busy, busy, busy crap.
824035	824676	Lots of stress.
825356	825616	And yeah.
826943	827843	That's pretty much my week.
828564	829264	Oh, I'm sorry.
829904	831365	No specifics you want to give?
832125	832346	No.
832826	833446	It was busy.
833926	835467	And it's going to be even busier next week.
836287	846432	And, let's see, Tuesday when I came home, the business that was going to cause me to cancel the show didn't happen.
847213	847473	Oh, no.
847493	848393	And I was all stressing out.
848453	849394	Well, you know about that.
849554	850014	You told me.
850494	851495	Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right.
851535	851915	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
852976	854376	I thought it was something else.
854536	860498	See, I have so many things going on right now that I'm just... It's like spaghetti.
860898	873261	At any rate, I just said fuck it that night and had dinner with Dan and had a nice time and relaxed, but I'm still stressed as hell, and it's going to be that way until after Halloween.
874121	875782	It's exactly how I feel.
876022	876362	Yeah.
878171	880172	Alright, well, I guess that does it for Jamie's week.
880972	882633	Let's talk to Loki.
882733	883794	You want to talk to us about your week?
887015	891137	Yeah, I didn't really do a whole lot of stuff.
891317	892218	What did I do this week?
892698	894859	Oh yeah, I played Leisure Suit Larry all week.
895299	896480	That's pretty much what I did.
898321	903163	And other than that, I played a little bit of Final Fantasy this weekend.
904064	906785	And then, what else did I do?
907717	910278	I don't know, just kind of hung out.
911259	912919	Just trying to stay out of the weather.
914600	920183	And, yeah, that's pretty much all that happened.
920303	923064	Oh, and I bought an Airzooka yesterday because I was at the mall.
923844	924505	I had money.
925045	927626	I didn't want to buy a game because I'm just going to rent it.
928787	934229	And so, you know, I couldn't leave empty-handed, so I got an Airzooka instead.
936070	937691	Virgin didn't have any echo image.
938472	939993	Of course, why was I even looking?
940053	940474	Because...
940754	941194	What?!
941875	944437	Explain what an airzooka is for those listeners that don't know.
946238	948460	It's a giant thing that shoots a ring of air at you.
950041	960669	It's like a giant, um... I don't know, it looks like a giant tube with a big elastic thing at the end and you pull it back and it creates like... You know how if you were to blow smoke rings?
961050	961890	Well, it does the same thing.
961910	965133	It creates like a shockwave of air that goes up through about ten feet.
965996	971417	And it's supposed to be harmless, and you can, like, shoot at it, animals and stuff, and all that fun stuff.
972738	973918	That's what an Arizuka is.
973998	978239	It's this giant thing that I wasted a lot of, well, not a lot of money, but I wasted money on.
979739	985421	And, um, yeah, that's pretty much all that's been going down this week.
985461	986481	It's been pretty boring.
987421	988381	Pretty boring.
990502	990942	Oh, yeah.
991902	992382	That's right.
992862	994723	Wait, I already talked about my trip, though, didn't I?
994883	995563	Yeah, I think I did.
998473	1001434	Oh, and I saw The Grudge.
1002274	1002735	That was cool.
1005136	1007677	Yeah, I'll talk about The Grudge in a little bit, because I saw it too.
1008477	1013159	But first, we'll talk to Arcadian, Bradley, and talk to him about his week, because I know he had a fun week.
1013819	1014740	Oh yes, I did.
1015920	1018261	And it started off really, really fucking shitty.
1018281	1022203	About two miles from leaving this apartment last week,
1022711	1026812	The fucking Folsom Police Department stops me, goddamn motherfuckers.
1027672	1029472	After leaving this show.
1029572	1031032	Yes, right after leaving the show.
1031072	1040674	Two miles away, a fucking guy pulls me over and says, Oh, your registration's out of date, so it's over six months, so we gotta tow it.
1041834	1042414	Fuck you.
1042874	1043214	Don't!
1043755	1044895	It really fucking sucks.
1044935	1052096	At least he didn't get me for speeding, because it was right at a fucking place where it goes from 50 to 40, and he could have busted me for that, but he didn't.
1053248	1055849	and so he went away and said, do you have money?
1055869	1056689	I said, yeah, I do.
1056709	1058849	I went down to the thing and called Rob.
1060430	1061990	And so he came and picked me up and took me home.
1062930	1063490	Thank you, Rob.
1064431	1068311	No problem, because I was dropping off Angel anyway, so we're done.
1068712	1075093	So sure, they can pull you over for fucking expired registration, but they never catch anybody that runs a fucking red light.
1075640	1083078	makes a goddamn left turn when there's a right turn only lane and fucking just blatantly drives like assholes.
1083138	1083780	You know, they just...
1084431	1086332	I saw two people, and Rob actually passed me when I was stopped
1112802	1114763	And it just frustrated the hell out of me.
1114783	1115044	Yeah, bitches.
1142708	1155154	Well, then, once I got home, I called my manager, and he said, You better get it out tomorrow, because those fees for the tow yards go up astronomically, so they can take away your car after a number of days.
1155174	1157455	They'll take away your car, put a lien on it, sell it off.
1159035	1160416	So you want to get it out tomorrow.
1161476	1166339	So, after that, I went and called... So I had to wait until like 4 a.m.
1166359	1171421	in the morning, called my mom on the East Coast, and asked her to put in some money in my account, and she... She...
1173606	1200944	So, in the morning I called my co-worker and she drove me over to the Carmichael DMV and 10 minutes after they opened I paid $319 and got my registration and temporary tag so I can get a smog check and so from there, since the bus wasn't coming for 30 minutes I decided, oh, I'll just go ahead and start walking towards ARC, the American River College that took about 45 minutes later I was there
1201846	1205148	Even though my foot was hurting in the beginning, but it didn't hurt after a while, so that was okay.
1205828	1212172	But, after that, I took a bus from there to Greenback, then from there to Orangevale, where the thing was.
1212732	1215874	The co-worker says, hey, okay, let's see if we can get it out.
1216114	1220096	No, you have to go to Folsom PD and get them to release it.
1220776	1224098	So you have to go there and show them that you got your registration and everything.
1224178	1231362	So, after that, I didn't know about the buses there, so I started walking towards Folsom, and I missed the bus that came next.
1232059	1233319	So I said, ah, let's go ahead and walk.
1233440	1237141	So I walked another mile and a half down the hill, which wasn't too bad.
1237181	1240522	It was a nice day out and so on.
1240962	1245504	Then from there, I walked across the bridge because I missed the bus there.
1245784	1249766	I kind of just went on and then said, nah, let's go walk a bit farther.
1250206	1251326	So here comes the stupid part.
1251727	1256629	There's a, I got like a little, the person at the tow yards that gave me a map.
1257089	1260290	They said, you should go to Natoma Boulevard or Natoma Street.
1261169	1264431	I thought it was Natomas Street, and I thought it was like a right turn.
1264471	1268574	So when I went to Natomas Street, I went to turn to the right, and thought, oh, the levers are going up.
1268694	1271496	And I didn't think to go left and see if there was something up that way.
1271956	1274878	I just went down this, kept going down this road miles and miles.
1275379	1280622	Didn't ask any directions or anything until I got to the end, basically to a big cross street.
1280642	1283304	That's the lady, last lady of the apartment there.
1283324	1286486	Apartment company says, uh, where's the Pilsner PD?
1286546	1290509	I said, it's Natomas, there's no Natomas Street, you idiot.
1290984	1291705	She didn't say that, of course.
1291725	1292925	She was probably thinking it was crazy.
1293266	1295287	This crazy guy walking away, the long way.
1296108	1299610	So, after that, I walked back to the next bus stop.
1300170	1305934	That took me to Entomba Street, and I had to walk, like, half a mile or so down to the PD.
1306014	1310918	They said, oh, okay, here we go, give me a ticket, and say, okay, oh, you gotta pay $20.
1311498	1311959	Ah, fuck.
1312079	1314140	Gotta go across the street, get money out of the bank.
1314360	1315641	Oh my god!
1315941	1319604	Then walked back across the street, paid the money, then gotta go back to the bank.
1320202	1324745	So I walked back down to Riley, and then got on a bus, which was good.
1325525	1331249	The bus took me almost there, then paid $175 to the fucking tow yard, and got it out, and yay.
1332130	1335612	Then I went back to work for like three and a half hours, and then made it up the rest of the week.
1336012	1340815	Basically made up my whole week, and that was it for that.
1341355	1343237	Tough lesson learned, everybody out there.
1343337	1344517	Register your car!
1345798	1346959	Don't fucking drive in Folsom.
1347982	1348843	Stay far away.
1349723	1357229	And in other news, I got keys to work so I can stay late and lock up the place after everyone else has left.
1357689	1364374	If you want to run through red lights and make illegal left turns, Folsom's where it's at because no one gives a shit.
1367236	1374741	I'm not broke now because Mother gave me enough money so that I could do that and a little bit of extra money.
1375691	1383258	Which is helpful because I can go and get a new chair mat because my other one has a hole in it that's been poking me in the foot for like three or four months.
1383918	1388542	Then go to the Mall of Wart, the Mart of Walls and buy stuff.
1389243	1392966	That's what I did today before coming here.
1394547	1397010	Alright, wow, well, interesting week there.
1397870	1399812	Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week went.
1401069	1405050	Well, uh, not much really, um, just school and work.
1406630	1410612	Although, um, my instructor's becoming quite a flake.
1412252	1413572	He almost canceled class on Monday.
1415813	1418073	Nah, well, I suppose he has his own reasons.
1419234	1419354	Um...
1420769	1425970	Played a little Karamari Damasi and other stuff this week.
1427630	1435352	Maybe like a couple hours worth of FFXI, which is not as bad as you guys, but hey, it's something.
1436512	1441893	I also spent some time with, well, what, one-third of Orange Lounge?
1444213	1447374	Not the hosts, of course, the other people that usually come here.
1448044	1452806	Last night and spent an hour waiting to get into dinner.
1456848	1457248	I can talk.
1457428	1460389	Had dinner and watched movies and stuff last night.
1460429	1461029	That was pretty cool.
1461930	1464631	Which I don't get to do that often, so that was kind of fun.
1467072	1468772	And that's about it, pretty much.
1472134	1472414	Alright.
1472434	1475635	I have something else to add, but I think you're going to talk about it, so I'll let you bring that up.
1475855	1477716	Okay, I'll talk about my weekend.
1478516	1479217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1497003	1507188	And then Thursday, I hung out with my friend and pretty much nothing interesting happened until Friday when I went and saw The Grudge with Loki and his girlfriend and my buddy Christopher.
1507228	1508109	We went to this theater.
1508149	1509329	My God, it was packed.
1509750	1516093	Not only was the theater packed, but it was packed full of high schoolers because apparently these movies really appeal to the high schoolers.
1516333	1522756	Boy, did we make a mistake going on opening night with all these high schoolers in there because every scary part of the movie, and there was a lot.
1522796	1523677	The movie was pretty scary.
1524217	1524877	Every scary part.
1525398	1525998	All the girls were like,
1528007	1534010	And like, even, it's, I don't want to ruin it, but there's this one part where the screaming became almost rhythmic.
1534050	1539413	It was like, It was really funny.
1539433	1545276	I can't, if you've seen the movie, you probably could figure out what part I'm talking about, but this is one part where it just was rhythmic.
1545296	1545997	It was so funny.
1548203	1572901	But then there was this guy in the back of the theater, he was being really annoying, and you know the type I'm talking about, he's like that high school jock type, he's sitting there going, like making those noises, because apparently other high school jock types find those kinds of noises funny, and their girlfriends or whatever, so he was kind of mocking how everybody else was getting scared, like, oh my god, I want my mommy, and apparently this is funny when somebody does this.
1573351	1579795	Never mind that it's a sold out theater and he's getting on everybody else's nerves in the theater and just bugging the hell out of all of us.
1579815	1583657	You can just feel the tension, like everybody just wanted to turn around and punch this guy in the face.
1583777	1584317	Am I right, Loki?
1585458	1586198	Uh, sure.
1586418	1595523	Okay, so finally, I don't know what came over me, but I just turned, and mind you, this is right at the climax of the movie, towards the end of the movie, he's still yelling and screaming, he's been doing it for five minutes.
1596315	1599737	I turn around, I look right at him, and I yell in the crowded theater.
1600097	1604359	I said, with the guy with the little penis in the back row, please shut the hell up.
1605099	1607380	And everybody burst into applause and started laughing.
1609661	1610541	And so that was kind of cool.
1610601	1611262	And then he shut up.
1611782	1615684	So he knew who he was by the way I addressed him, by being the small penis guy.
1616972	1625380	My advice to you, don't be afraid to shout it out if people are distracting the movie, because chances are everybody else around you is finding them distracting too, and they'll back you up.
1625480	1626501	They're just being chicken.
1626741	1627622	They don't want to say anything.
1628062	1635549	So I can credit my couple years, God, several years experience with Rocky Horror Picture Show for making me unafraid to yell back at a movie.
1636670	1641174	Speaking of which, I ended up going to see a local production of the Rocky Horror Show, which the
1641874	1642374	Broadway version
1663641	1665762	The one that they played on Broadway in 2000.
1667183	1673347	So that's where the difference... People were talking about, well, this isn't how the original play was because it actually was the redo for Broadway.
1673847	1676829	Yeah, Richard O'Brien went back and did the script for Broadway.
1677409	1680150	I recognize it because I have the 2000 recording.
1681231	1683192	And it was the same thing.
1686034	1686374	Very good.
1688995	1690596	So it was a good show.
1691137	1691657	I liked it.
1692338	1692678	DarkSakura.com
1710263	1716684	And then other than that, I've just been doing a lot of rehearsal because there is going to be another production of the movie soon, which I'm involved with.
1716824	1720185	So I've just been very tired going to rehearsals and things like that.
1720245	1722586	And Jamie knows where I'm coming from with that, certainly.
1724326	1724686	Amen.
1725586	1727587	I'm just glad I don't have to do prop crew this time around.
1728127	1729947	I mean, I like doing prop crew and that's all cool.
1730147	1731007	But I'm doing lighting.
1731027	1733268	That means I'm going to just sit on my butt playing with the light switches.
1733508	1734588	It's an easy job.
1734648	1734968	It's good.
1735268	1735628	Yeah.
1735948	1738409	You have a lot of control in that little box.
1738914	1740195	I don't mind the running about.
1740215	1741895	If someone makes you mad, you just turn the light off.
1741915	1751720	Well, I don't really mind doing the running about, putting stuff up on, you know, it was fun, but I was exhausted last time I did it, and you know what, I'm just going to sit back because I'm stressed enough.
1752355	1755577	So, after next week, it's just going to be so tired.
1755637	1758799	Which, by the way, reminds me, you guys, next week is Halloween.
1759499	1764022	And so, on Halloween night, it's not looking like we're going to have a live show, you guys.
1764062	1764622	Just so you know.
1764962	1767424	Because it's Halloween and people want to go out and do Halloween stuff.
1767724	1769965	We actually don't think there's enough listener base.
1769985	1772647	Because you guys will probably all want to go out and do your own things for Halloween.
1773649	1781411	What I think we might do next weekend, we might do some type of very scary marathon of old Orange Lounge episodes.
1781931	1783292	We might fit that in next week.
1783932	1785512	That means we definitely get to hear Loki sing.
1785712	1790334	Yeah, that means episode 69 for sure would be in there because that has to be one of the scariest episodes we ever did.
1792274	1795495	We're going to work something out where we do a marathon of old episodes.
1797782	1799784	So that's pretty much it for my week and my day.
1800084	1804267	Nobody had anything remotely DDR related in their week at all.
1804828	1806449	It's just... Yes, Angel.
1807390	1811073	I was at Fry's and I met one of our local freestylers.
1812454	1812875	Prestige.
1814396	1814996	Oh, okay.
1815016	1819700	I've never heard... What, is Fry's the place to play DDR in town now?
1819740	1824224	Because I know that... What's his name online?
1824244	1824664	I can't remember.
1824685	1825105	Islander.
1826944	1828765	I know his real name, I can't remember his name online.
1829145	1831266	Islander plays a lot at Fry's, from what I hear.
1831326	1835668	He plays a lot at DDR at Fry's, because I guess it's near his work, and then I guess Prestige goes there.
1835988	1837609	You're going there, and you were playing DDR?
1838129	1840690	Fry's must be the place to be now, all of a sudden.
1840770	1848334	What happened to... Well, I mean, I know what happened to Golfland and all the arcades in town, but it's kind of sad when a department store becomes the main DDR hangout in town.
1849894	1855577	Well, I was just shopping for geek stuff, and, well, he was there, and so we just started playing DDR for, like,
1856229	1856969	Good times, good times.
1884818	1898724	So, it's getting sad, but you have to understand there's really not a whole lot of reason for us to go out and play DDR in this town anymore because really, nobody's really gotten anything new in six months at least.
1898784	1904086	When did Guitar Freaks 9, 10 come out?
1905487	1906927	What the hell version do they have anyway, 9?
1909145	1911226	I could give a shit after five, really.
1911266	1918231	They actually still have the same Guitar Freaks 8th Mix where they put in Percussion Freaks 9th Mix, I think.
1918251	1918651	That's it.
1918691	1924934	Percussion Freaks 9th Mix and Guitar Freaks 8th Mix, which makes no sense at all.
1924954	1927456	But that's the last new Bomani this town saw, anyway.
1928156	1935881	Except the Statmania machine, but that thing was broken so fast that it never really got to stick around.
1936600	1944128	So really, I think at this point a lot of us are just sitting and waiting in anticipation of Ultramix 2 because that's going to be the next big story.
1944729	1947212	I actually did play DDR Extreme the other day though.
1947432	1948493	It's still really fun to me.
1949034	1956842	So that's one thing I guess I could say for it is that I was playing on the ignition pad trying to work some of my fat ass off because I've got a show to do next week.
1957563	1982258	Poppin' Music and 2DX8 also Absolutely, it's going to be definitely a huge week, November 18th When Festival and Poppin' Music 10 and all that fun stuff, 2DX8 style come out too Oh, you know we had a trailer, there was a trailer for 2DX8 style that came out not too long ago And we completely forgot to mention it last week So I'm going to make sure to bring it up tonight In fact, I'm going to do that right now If I can find that, here it is
1983294	1988937	Here's some audio here from a new preview that is out for 2DX8Style, and I'll show this here in studio.
1990397	1993059	Of course, you hear a little bit of Guideca there.
1995800	1997461	And it just shows the Konami logos here.
1999722	2001322	It says, ooh, 2DX8Style!
2003003	2005744	And it's showing a lot of the screenshots from the game and all these videos.
2005784	2009106	You see, like, Alien World and a bunch of Japanese text.
2009646	2011087	Something 50 and something 80 here.
2013393	2015854	I'm sure somebody in our chat room can translate that there.
2017675	2018236	New song!
2018636	2023598	Very nice clip there of a Santa song.
2023618	2024599	This is a new song as well.
2024619	2025880	Yeah, it's definitely an LED song.
2045894	2046535	Ooh, look at that.
2046855	2048336	And it says there, November 18th.
2050177	2052399	And it had some clips from the new videos in there as well, so.
2053300	2054641	I don't even remember where I got that.
2054661	2055682	I think somebody sent it to me.
2055742	2058864	So I would totally pass along where you guys could get it, except I don't remember.
2059945	2063147	They said 50 new songs over 80 songs in total.
2065649	2070973	And they're confirming in our chatroom, DarkLionXVI says the last song is Nebula Grasper.
2071294	2072895	Was that last song you heard a little clip of there?
2073826	2078011	And the one before that was the Santa song that's in the new poppin' music as well, right?
2078031	2081055	The one that she sang at Tokyo Game Show?
2081716	2082517	Correct me if I'm wrong.
2083538	2084079	I could be.
2085541	2086041	I don't know.
2088224	2088604	Alright.
2089225	2092289	Also on Bomani News this week, we have a little bit of Bomani News.
2093669	2096210	The box art for Ultramix 2 came out.
2096290	2098651	You might have seen this at your local store, actually.
2099251	2105673	And the interesting thing about the box art, though, is that it has a little thing in there that talks about how it features dance hits.
2105713	2111995	Like, remember how DDR Max said, Ooh, this features dance hits from Darude and Aurora and all the bands that were in there.
2112015	2113836	And the Max 2 was, Ooh, it's Kylie Minogue.
2114196	2115076	Well, this one says...
2115751	2119074	Featuring dance hits by Delirium, we knew that after all, right?
2119274	2141435	Elvis, we knew that, Rubberneckin' Freestylers, which isn't ringing a bell with me So I don't think we know about what this song is And they've tried to do research, I think over on the DDR Freak thread But nobody's come up with what song that could be yet So maybe we'll hear more about that later But we have the Commodores, which we know is Brick House Nucleus, which is jam on it, we talked about that before Captain Jack
2142593	2145494	I believe the Dream of Dream booty mix was confirmed previously.
2145994	2149094	And now, Jason Nevins presents Holly James.
2149534	2151375	Well, guess what?
2151895	2155615	Jason Nevins and Holly James, they only ever did one song together.
2155775	2161396	So, that pretty much, no, that song was just announced recently.
2162677	2167957	So, anyway, we're going to go ahead and play that song for you guys right now.
2168017	2170938	It's Jason Nevins and Holly James.
2171684	2201020	and the song is called I'm in Heaven and we'll play that for you guys now this hasn't been confirmed but it's kind of one of those things where it's like well unless it's a remix or something like that who knows so we're going to play that for you guys right now the assumed radio edit would be the version they'd use in DDR because we haven't heard if it's a remix again it's kind of unconfirmed but at the same time when it's on the box art you know duh so here it is Jason Evans
2201601	2202874	With Holly James, I'm in Heaven.
2231003	2258226	I don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel When these feelings I have really are for real The time is right for this, a love to shine on through But you gotta tell me what you wanna do
2276936	2280478	I'm in heaven with you I'm in heaven with you Heaven with you
2305220	2315295	Every time you're near, I start to lose control When the thought of you, hits my very soul When you're lying in my bed, right next to me
2337145	2339487	I'm in heaven with you Only one for me
2359258	2360540	Thanks for watching!
2399697	2400898	I'm in heaven with you
2435627	2443494	Warning, Orange Lounge Radio's Monty Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.
2444114	2454182	We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.
2455123	2458746	A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
2461148	2463170	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2464119	2469001	And that was a song that has not been confirmed, yet it pretty much has by the box art.
2469081	2472283	I'm in Heaven, Jason Evans, featuring Holly James.
2472303	2473143	What did you guys think of that?
2475224	2475524	Pretty cool.
2475724	2479326	Yeah, did you realize that that's actually a former Cage Match winner from this program?
2479886	2480687	I remember that song.
2481027	2483068	Yes, Loki picked that song a while back.
2483428	2485689	Or at least, I don't know if it was necessarily that mix.
2485789	2487470	I think it was one of your white label mixes.
2488230	2488610	Very close.
2488631	2489231	Oh, that was it?
2489371	2489871	Oh, my bad.
2490431	2491172	Okay, so that was it.
2491252	2491632	So now...
2492697	2496179	Jamie, you had picked Delirium After All in a cage match once.
2497359	2497579	Yeah.
2498040	2500621	Loki, you picked that one, which was in a cage match once.
2501021	2502702	I want a song in Ultramax.
2502762	2503623	It's not fair.
2505363	2505744	No.
2506724	2507144	Oh, yeah.
2507184	2507585	We'll see.
2508305	2508605	All right.
2508725	2509245	Sorry, Rob.
2509946	2510506	Maybe one day.
2510626	2511286	Chicks are for kids.
2511667	2511967	All right.
2512427	2513007	Maybe one day.
2516354	2521355	So, what we want to do now, I actually want to go ahead and give somebody a call here on the Skype line.
2521395	2525216	We tried to get him on the show here last week, but unfortunately the connection was really bad.
2525316	2529177	So, everybody keep your fingers crossed that the connection is a little bit better tonight.
2529197	2530498	So, everybody's got their fingers crossed, yes?
2530518	2535839	Okay, so hopefully he's there and I don't embarrass myself here on the radio, but we're going to go ahead and give this a try here.
2539120	2539840	I hope it works.
2543441	2545722	One ringy dingy, two ringy dingys.
2547423	2548283	Three ringy dingies.
2550144	2550944	Four ringy dingies.
2550984	2551624	God, I hope he's there.
2554224	2555105	That would be pretty funny.
2555345	2555705	Hello?
2556945	2558345	Hi, is this frequency?
2561246	2562826	Oh no, the connection's still kind of shy.
2562846	2563726	Can you hear me okay?
2567447	2569648	Oh no, we're still having a problem hearing him.
2569688	2572128	He's very choppy.
2572848	2576049	You only hear a couple seconds here and there, and then that's it.
2577992	2579493	I hear you fine.
2579553	2580294	Oh, there you go.
2580374	2581074	I can kind of hear him.
2583156	2583937	He says he can hear us okay.
2584257	2587059	You might have something with your mic sensitivity settings.
2587159	2590782	I'm wondering if it's the mic sensitivity because I heard like a little bit there.
2591403	2595506	Can you hold the mic up nice and... Hi.
2599169	2599329	Yeah.
2599889	2603372	Okay, so I'm going to try and do a conversation here.
2603392	2604833	How are you doing this evening, Frequency?
2605654	2606294	I'm doing okay.
2606434	2607235	I just woke up from nap.
2613323	2617746	All right, so tell us a little bit about this tournament that just happened on the East Coast recently.
2617786	2624151	I was kind of curious about what went on there, because we don't get to talk a whole lot about East Coast events on the show, so I'm kind of curious what went on with this tournament.
2628734	2634658	It was not so good, but not the main thing.
2635239	2635779	You know what?
2635879	2636200	I'm sorry.
2636920	2640863	The connection, for some reason, we're not getting them for some reason.
2640883	2643305	I'm only hearing little bits and pieces of you.
2643845	2645826	So, gosh, I'm really sorry.
2645927	2650830	I guess what we're going to have to do, maybe we can try giving you a call later in the show.
2650850	2651510	I have another idea.
2651530	2653692	I'm going to try getting back to you a little bit later, Frequency.
2653712	2654553	I have another idea, okay?
2655753	2655974	All right.
2656014	2656454	Take care, bud.
2657335	2657695	Bye-bye.
2658916	2659556	Ah, what a bummer.
2659596	2660036	What a bummer.
2662398	2665020	I do have another idea, though, but I can't get to it until the next break.
2665506	2666827	But that does give me an idea.
2667947	2670989	Okay, so, I guess we have to shift gears here.
2671329	2678532	Darn, because I have a lot of good questions I want to ask them too, and we don't get East Coast people on this show a whole lot, but that's alright, we'll give it a try later.
2680353	2681874	Well, moving on.
2682654	2684135	I guess we could talk about other news going on.
2684375	2687416	Didn't you find some news about Pump It Up that was going on this week, Loki?
2687896	2691018	You got really bored and you found out that Pump It Up actually had some news going on?
2691897	2693198	Yeah, there's two things going on.
2693738	2699562	Number one being, there's another release that's coming out in November, I believe.
2699823	2702765	And that would be Pump It Up Exceed on the JPS2.
2703545	2704686	So that's going to be coming out.
2704946	2705607	God damn it.
2706287	2708308	Dude, our connection is fucking sucking tonight.
2708348	2712391	Anyways, yeah, so Pump It Up Exceed, it's going to be coming out.
2712411	2713632	It's going to be arcade perfect.
2714673	2716254	So there's going to be 100 plus songs.
2717148	2721470	It's going to be coming out one week before all the DDR stuff.
2722591	2728914	There's rumors, though, that it's going to be coming out also for the US PS2 and the Xbox later on.
2729995	2736058	Also, they've added a few different modes in there.
2736138	2740440	They have a mode that's kind of like where you just watch videos, the background videos, that type of thing.
2741204	2754776	and also supposedly the PC version USB pads that shipped with the old version, Premiere, I think actually are going to be working with the PS2 version.
2754856	2757038	So that should be pretty interesting.
2757138	2758279	Looks pretty cool so far.
2759820	2765886	Other than that, starting, looks like this coming week in Korea...
2766585	2775250	at Animero headquarters will be beta testing for Pump It Up Exceed 2, which they have really, really insane details on that.
2775290	2780453	I'm sure that will be coming next week as stuff leaks out from the beta test location.
2782394	2783675	So that's your Pump It Up news.
2786137	2786777	Exciting.
2788880	2792121	I think it's very strange that Pump It Up could possibly come to the U.S.
2792541	2798663	And then they're also saying, they're rumoring that In The Groove could be coming to the home versions as well, so it's going to be very interesting.
2799263	2804265	I doubt that one, but I do too, but they're saying it, so I guess I should acknowledge it.
2805445	2805905	I doubt that.
2806786	2816509	But, no, seriously, McSeed, though, is doing extremely well, like in some of the other countries that, you know, non-English countries like Mexico is fucking hot over there.
2817389	2817529	And, um,
2818792	2820673	I couldn't, I mean, why not?
2820973	2822675	Try releasing it over here, see how it does.
2823115	2830540	Because I'm sure, I mean, most of the stuff they've got is in-house artists anyway, so you're not really, you know, going to lose money on licensing as far as music goes.
2831380	2832761	Really, there's not much to lose there.
2832781	2838785	I mean, other than, you know, oh, you have to make some new pads or something, but I think you'd do pretty well over here.
2839145	2839866	You know, give it a shot.
2839906	2844049	I mean, it can't be any worse than, like, say, you know, Britney's Dance Beat and all that crap.
2844409	2847611	I mean, at least it's a step above all that stuff, so, you know, hey, why not?
2850592	2873082	I think it would be very interesting if they did give Pump It Up a home release for this reason, because DDR, they've kind of stopped doing the arcade thing, and I think especially with DDR, or I'm sorry, with Konami USA, they've kind of given up on doing the arcade thing, there's not going to be a new arcade mix unless hell freezes over, so basically it is a possibility, but very low chance, low, low, low chance.
2874022	2879965	So basically they've pretty much stuck to the home versions, and I think everybody understands that the home versions are where they make their money.
2880396	2882378	and Konami of America, they push the home versions.
2883138	2884559	It's their bread and butter for DDR.
2884619	2898551	They see the future of DDR being these home versions, and that's why they never really threw a fit over the import mixes, at least as far as I can tell, because the import mixes of DDR Arcade kind of serve as promotion for the home versions.
2898771	2899992	So everything works out.
2900052	2901533	Everybody gets their share.
2901934	2905116	Well, now if Pump It Up ends up coming out for the home versions...
2906775	2908316	Was Konami going to take issue to that?
2908436	2909737	Is there anything they can do about it?
2909757	2910457	I mean, I don't know.
2910517	2918282	I mean, there were those rumors a while back that Andomero and Konami might have had it out in court, and that's why, you know, I don't know.
2918322	2919863	It's a bunch of rumors going on out there.
2920604	2921785	You think Konami would take issue with that?
2921805	2922525	What do you think would happen?
2923446	2924026	Anybody have a thought?
2924106	2925727	Loki, I'd especially be curious what you think.
2925747	2926908	You always seem to have a strong opinion.
2929630	2936134	I don't know if they're legally able to bring it over here, actually, because of the whole lawsuit thing earlier, but I don't know.
2936154	2936314	They're
2937188	2947353	You can't really... I mean, DDR hasn't gone after... Konami hasn't gone after any of these other games that have similar rhythm type things with them.
2947833	2949274	I'm sure it'll be fine.
2950995	2955097	I mean, it'd be pretty cheap if they just went after them if they started doing well.
2955197	2959759	I mean, oh yeah, well, now that they're doing well, I guess, yeah, we have a problem with it now.
2960319	2962760	But, yeah, I don't know.
2963060	2965862	To be honest, I really don't know.
2966262	2966382	But,
2967595	2973740	Here's my concern, okay, about Indie Groove coming to the home console.
2973760	2979085	First off, I don't think it's going to happen, only because, one, it's going to be hard.
2979105	2985050	I mean, making a console game is a little harder than making, you know, just the arcade, you know, ports and stuff.
2985070	2987713	Because, I mean, hell, anyone can hook up a PC to an arcade machine.
2987773	2988533	It's not that hard.
2989114	2992577	Now, programming for the home console is a little different.
2993510	2996011	Well, if it's fucking hard enough, they have 11 12-footers in the arcade.
2996031	2998271	How the fuck are you going to play that on a softpad?
2998411	2999232	That's never going to work.
3000032	3001472	So that's my concern right there.
3001492	3002813	I don't think it's ever going to happen.
3002953	3007474	I mean, I'm sure they'd like to see it happen, but feasibly, I don't think it's going to happen.
3010335	3011495	Very interesting thought.
3011775	3016857	Anybody else have a thought on In the Groove coming out for home or what Pump It Up may do for DDR?
3017113	3021198	Well, Pump It Up actually did have a home release on PC.
3021358	3022680	That's right, I forgot about that.
3022960	3023981	Was that in the U.S., though?
3026796	3031397	Well, yeah, actually, Red Octane sells it, and I don't think they sell the import DDRs, or do they?
3031457	3032257	I could be wrong.
3032277	3032877	Yeah, I saw that too.
3033377	3033717	Oh, do they?
3033917	3034177	I think so.
3034217	3034517	Huh.
3034677	3036178	I'm not sure.
3036698	3038198	Yeah, I completely forgot about that.
3038218	3041519	You're right, Pump It Up did have a previous home release on the PC.
3042059	3044659	Not that the dance market on PC is very lucrative.
3044719	3047980	I believe the folks that created DDR PC found that out the hard way.
3048800	3052201	You know, I saw those games going for like $10 a pop at Fry's not too long ago.
3054181	3054601	Interesting.
3055903	3057825	I think I got mine for about the same.
3058366	3063170	Do you think that Pump It Up coming out for the home version would help DDR, or do you think it's going to hurt it?
3066033	3068976	You know, I think that after they compare, but I don't know.
3069316	3069997	It can depend.
3070097	3071518	There's different factors to consider.
3072619	3076823	I think the biggest turnoff is that you have to get a whole other dance pad for Pump It Up.
3077303	3077684	Because...
3078704	3087307	Although it would be very easy, you would think, with the ignition pad, you could just use the buttons, the X, O, circle, square, which are in the corners, but there's no center button.
3087647	3092409	The center doesn't do anything on those pads, as far as I know, so you're kind of screwed there.
3093109	3101092	The pump-it-up pads not only do have the corner buttons, they do have the up, down, left, right buttons also, because those are for song select stuff.
3101872	3102452	They use those.
3102872	3104453	So, yeah.
3106107	3120032	So theoretically, any DDR pad that has all the corner buttons would work, except the official Konami ones, because they don't have triangle and square in the back like most of the other pads do, except all the other pads are missing that center button.
3120052	3123633	So, now you're going to have a whole new dance pad if you want to play Pump It Up at home.
3123973	3126954	And how many people are that obsessed with Pump It Up where they're going to spend all the money on that?
3127915	3132016	And how many stores are going to pick up those Pump It Up pads for commercial sale?
3132316	3133037	I don't know.
3133057	3134458	It'd be interesting.
3156109	3158330	Alright, I guess what we're going to do now is we're going to take another break.
3158690	3163392	When we come back, we'll hopefully have everything set up so we can try calling frequency again.
3163412	3164232	That'll be very cool.
3164892	3167173	If not, I guess we'll have ourselves a cage match.
3167213	3168094	That'll be some fun.
3168614	3172195	And we'll talk about some more DDR, Bomani, when we come back.
3172235	3178537	In this break, let's do... Well, you know what I kind of want to do, if I can find the music?
3179158	3180498	Let's do some DDR Disney.
3182019	3182619	We play fire.
3183376	3184557	Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
3184637	3189979	Let's see if I can find the directory that has all my random stuff in it.
3190819	3192560	Oh, shoot, not all the Disney stuff's in here.
3197322	3198223	Okay, we'll see what we can do.
3198483	3199603	Oh, I do have the Mickey Mouse March.
3199683	3202245	Okay, well, we have enough to do a break.
3202265	3203065	We'll be back after this.
3213098	3213958	Thank you for watching!
3242117	3255706	Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse, forever let's go, I wanna hide, hide, hide, hide Come along and sing a song and join the juggling, M-I-C-K-Y-M-U-S-E Come along and sing a song and join the juggling, M-I-C-K-Y-M-U-S-E Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse, we have fun with Mickey Mouse
3289850	3290191	Fire!
3330093	3331394	One, two, three, FIRE!
3360125	3360926	Thanks for watching!
3388973	3389535	and many more.
3464157	3465037	and many more.
3581568	3590926	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
3591654	3595756	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
3595776	3596736	Can we talk about that?
3597016	3599378	No subject will ever be taboo.
3599658	3603279	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
3603819	3606361	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
3606861	3612203	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
3612763	3614044	I collect your fucking head.
3616013	3617514	Just like this fucker here.
3619696	3622277	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
3622577	3625940	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
3626880	3633325	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
3634545	3638308	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
3638328	3645373	You know what I never understood, Jamie, is why does your voice sound so different in that promo?
3646633	3647213	I don't know.
3647293	3651716	I was taking these voice acting lessons and decided to sound like Lucy Liu.
3652176	3652496	I see.
3652756	3653537	Maybe it was something like that.
3653737	3654817	I think I did pretty well, don't you?
3655838	3656278	I think so.
3656418	3656778	I think so.
3658259	3663001	Now, I got this new thing for Skype that allows us to dial phone numbers, so I'm going to try this real fast.
3663021	3663822	I'm going to do a test.
3663882	3667063	I hate to do this live on air, but damn it, I want this to happen.
3668704	3669284	Ooh, it worked.
3671606	3672646	What the hell do you want?
3674587	3675127	I think it worked.
3675227	3676228	Hello, can you hear me on this thing?
3677298	3678839	Yeah, there's a delay, but that's cool.
3679739	3681580	I'm on a phone, and I'm here.
3681800	3682761	You need to hang up.
3682801	3683401	We don't want any.
3683541	3684382	Alright, I'm hanging up on him.
3684482	3685162	Cool, it worked.
3685262	3686643	Okay, so maybe... Telemarket Loki.
3686883	3688684	Hopefully we can do that and make it work.
3688744	3692406	It's a little quiet, but maybe I can tweak the volume settings in there and get it to work.
3692887	3694488	Would you like to take a survey?
3697449	3700491	You're crazy.
3700731	3701992	No, I'm not crazy.
3702652	3703753	I'm slightly strange.
3703813	3706094	Loki's the crazy one with his portal to hell and all that.
3715336	3715776	All right.
3716516	3717477	How's it going there, Loki?
3717497	3720478	You're trying to figure out what that Freestyler song could be, huh?
3720538	3721838	You're trying to do research there.
3722498	3723339	What were you doing there earlier?
3723359	3728480	You were hacking that master file thing that... I don't even... I can't even remember what the hell this thing is.
3728981	3732001	It's the master song list.
3732662	3734222	I was looking at it.
3734462	3735283	Where does that come from?
3735843	3742105	Well, this is from... It's a document that... Or it's a file that's in... Well, this one is in the DDR Extreme USA...
3743547	3744448	CD or DVD.
3744548	3747089	So I was looking to see, because there's a few songs in there.
3747109	3752111	I see some from the new Dancing Stage game that's going to be coming out.
3752211	3753872	Then there's a few that I didn't recognize.
3753892	3755973	So I was just seeing if I could figure it out.
3756013	3761716	Because in here, remember we reported a few weeks back about Superstar?
3762236	3762797	That's in there.
3763497	3765858	So, you know, just stuff like that.
3766038	3767739	So I was just seeing if it might be in there.
3768479	3769040	Because it might be.
3769540	3769900	You never know.
3774295	3779438	What is that you're... No, I found out... I had the microphone in my lap and people can hear me being IM'd.
3780479	3780859	I'm sure.
3784261	3784641	My bad.
3786282	3786682	Alright.
3787143	3792666	I guess what we're going to do is go into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match for this week.
3794487	3795488	You want to change your song?
3795508	3796108	Do you have a new one?
3796468	3798409	Yeah, um... Hold on a second.
3802512	3802612	Okay.
3802632	3802732	Okay.
3805733	3808034	Alright, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match tonight.
3814138	3819780	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Echo Image won for the fourth week in a row, meaning they are retired.
3820301	3823202	Goodbye, you're gone, you're out of here.
3824063	3832147	But let's have one more moment to remember the Echo Image, the very first song ever to be retired in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match here.
3832187	3832407	Let me...
3834489	3839050	The song was called Come Back, and here's a little bit of Come Back for you to remember this song by.
3839070	3858115	Alright, that's enough of the song.
3859016	3860656	You've heard enough of it over the past four weeks.
3863991	3869714	Alright, so you get three brand new songs in their entirety tonight, each host bringing one song to the table.
3871836	3873297	And who's going to go first tonight?
3873357	3874057	Yes, I will.
3874097	3874437	Why not?
3874457	3876459	I never get to go first because I hardly ever win this thing.
3876519	3878320	So, I'm going to go first tonight.
3878360	3879500	I'm going to play my song.
3879520	3882042	And, whoops, that's not the song I'm doing.
3883726	3896635	My song is a song by Ian Van Dow, who is the guy who did Will I from DDR Max 2, and he has a new song out, and the song is called Reason, and that's going to be my cage match pick for tonight.
3896716	3901059	So, enjoy Reason by Ian Van Dow, my pick, song number one tonight.
3939366	3944569	Together, or is it time to say goodbye?
3945970	3947151	Where is the love?
3949412	3967684	Give me a reason To hold on to what we've got There must be a reason To hold on to what we've got Time has come to set things right
3968852	3974423	is it worth another fight tell me the truth
4004557	4008079	Thank you for watching!
4029938	4031160	Where is the love?
4035104	4038288	Tell me, is there hope inside?
4038969	4044816	Gotta read between the lines Where is the love?
4076998	4077423	Thank you.
4113289	4116131	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
4116211	4118854	That was Ian Van Dow with Reason.
4118914	4122236	Let's go around and see if they had a reason to like or hate this song in the studio.
4122296	4122616	Jamie!
4123857	4124598	It's chancy.
4126700	4130002	Um, again, I'm really burned on chant.
4130803	4131723	But it's not bad.
4132524	4134826	I mean, I've heard it before.
4135647	4136427	Um, just seven.
4136988	4137448	Seven and a half.
4138802	4143084	I actually thought Jamie would give it a lower score, because I remember her saying she was sick of Trance, but dammit, I'm out of songs!
4144705	4145966	That's a new one that I happen to like.
4146426	4147166	Bradley, what'd you think?
4147426	4148607	I thought it was pretty good, I'd give it an 8.
4149868	4150288	Fair enough.
4150588	4150888	Loki?
4152189	4156471	I'm not sick of Trance, but I'm sick of Ian Vandell, so I think it's a 6.
4158753	4164036	I like it, it's happy, it's not my favorite Ian Vandell song, but I think it is worthy of a cage match title, I'd give it an 8.5.
4166332	4167452	Uh, Infant Doll's cool.
4167872	4168873	Uh, I'll give it an 8.
4170693	4170913	Alright.
4171833	4177055	Let's go on to song number 2, which is coming to us courtesy of the lovely DarkSakura.
4177535	4179395	DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?
4179735	4183816	Well, I need to find the name of the song again because I remembered that you had it because you burned my CD.
4183916	4184656	Let me give you a hint.
4184776	4187497	The song is called Everybody Wants You to Emerge.
4187877	4188297	That's it.
4188417	4191258	It's a mix of Emerge by Fisher Spooner and, uh...
4192099	4202184	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4221673	4225874	Whether you love or hate the show, it's got a great bouncy soundtrack to it.
4225934	4229216	So, let's see if this... Basically enough, I don't like the opening song.
4230016	4231076	Yeah, that's kind of weird, huh?
4231096	4233957	I know, the opening song is like too gay, but the rest of it's really good.
4234357	4237378	Yeah, it's like 90s pop dance, you know?
4237518	4237839	Alright.
4238039	4244241	Like, I feel like... Oh, you should have heard the thing on Tuesday.
4244301	4247022	I did a whole... Did you hear... Oh, I did a whole block of 90s dance.
4248354	4250899	I'm detesting you, I heard.
4251079	4253323	And I need that, by the way.
4253523	4258972	I remember being in Mobile and my friend's little Honda thing...
4260645	4269909	If for some reason, heaven forbid, Orange Moms Radio ever went belly up and we weren't doing this show anymore, I think I would have to start an early 90s dance music station.
4269929	4270389	That would be rad.
4281010	4282471	Maybe we just ought to start one anyway.
4282491	4283872	Compete with ourselves.
4284832	4290615	Hey, there's somebody out there that I know we're trying to negotiate with somebody out there to do a new show on our network.
4291195	4293136	But they're thinking of ideas for the show.
4293236	4294497	There's a great one right there.
4294597	4296338	And I know you like that kind of music, person.
4296918	4300220	In San Diego, they have an 80s and 90s radio station.
4300800	4302281	It's the best of both decades.
4305062	4305362	Alright.
4307023	4310085	Popular when I get Grand Theft Auto tomorrow.
4310973	4312695	All right, anyway, anyway, we're getting way off subject.
4313035	4314016	We're getting way off subject.
4314637	4315157	Way off subject.
4315177	4319481	Let's go to Fisher Spooner versus Billy Splyer with Everybody Wants to Emerge.
4319561	4319942	Enjoy.
4319962	4325587	All right.
4347233	4351991	You don't need to be much.
4352967	4366455	From nothing you don't need to step away You don't need to emerge From nothing you don't need to step away Step away
4382963	4384369	Thanks for watching!
4420548	4432974	You don't need to emerge from nothing You don't need to turn away Just one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more Everybody love me
4470530	4476475	Feels good, looks good, sounds good, looks good, feels good too Feels good, looks good
4494022	4495366	Thanks for watching!
4543268	4546869	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Fisher Spooner vs. Billy Squire.
4547009	4548410	Everybody wants you to emerge.
4549390	4552611	Let's emerge our decisions on that song.
4552631	4552911	Jamie.
4553451	4556972	You know, I really like that mix of it.
4557152	4560333	It wasn't quite what I had remembered it to be, but I still like it.
4560813	4562514	So it gets an A from me.
4563734	4565735	What do you think I'm going to bring you next time?
4567631	4573274	I was going to say, it samples an old song in there, because I've heard that old song at the raids before, I'm almost positive.
4574495	4582300	Well, Emergence is really cool, the song itself, but I mean, I really like that mix, because it's a lot different than the original.
4583381	4583701	Okay.
4584141	4584841	Alright, let's go on.
4584881	4585202	Bradley.
4586162	4589324	I had no idea what the hell they were saying, and it filled me with, eh.
4589344	4591065	So I give it a five.
4592026	4592366	Loki.
4592386	4594567	I second the, eh.
4595308	4596368	It was just like, it...
4598112	4598732	It got annoying.
4599812	4602093	Sorry.
4603013	4606954	Actually, when I heard that song, I kind of thought, this might be like a Guitar Freaks fun song.
4607014	4608194	It's kind of funky.
4608234	4608714	I like it.
4610235	4611475	It was funky.
4611575	4611895	Seven.
4612515	4612795	Angel.
4612815	4615036	That was pretty cool.
4616836	4617356	Seven and a half.
4618976	4619296	All right.
4619677	4621437	Remember, our votes don't mean shit.
4621517	4624117	It's your votes in the chat room that really decide this.
4624498	4626458	You got one more song that you can pick from.
4627506	4629067	God help us all, it's Loki's.
4631668	4632468	Ah, man.
4632868	4635409	Well, I have a few things to win you over already.
4636050	4637690	Not trance, and short.
4638931	4643033	The other thing I forgot to mention I did this week was saw Team America World Police.
4644673	4647755	And this is America, Fuck Yeah.
4651796	4654978	Team America
4659457	4662239	America, fuck yeah!
4662359	4668042	Coming again to save the motherfucking day, yeah America, fuck yeah!
4668082	4674546	Freedom is the only way, yeah Terrorists, your game is through Cause now you have some answer to America, fuck yeah!
4674586	4678989	So lick my butt and suck on my bone America, fuck yeah!
4679049	4681970	What you gonna do when we come for you now?
4699142	4711366	Together, Fuck Yeah, Ramon, Fuck Yeah, The Gap, Fuck Yeah, Baseball, Fuck Yeah, NFL, Fuck Yeah, Rock and Roll, Fuck Yeah, Internet, Fuck Yeah, Levering, Fuck Yeah, Fuck Yeah.

4740064	4747513	Liberty, White Slip, The Atomos, Band-Aid, Las Vegas, Christmas, Immigrant, Popeye, Democrat, Republican, Republican, Bull
4779631	4780152	All right.
4780732	4781532	Gotta love Loki.
4781613	4783253	Song number three in tonight's cage match.
4784274	4786015	From the Team America World Police soundtrack.
4786055	4787276	America, fuck yeah.
4787356	4788857	Fuck yeah or fuck no, Jamie?
4791058	4798262	It would be a humorous song for about ten minutes and then if you don't write... It gets fixed.
4799463	4799743	I don't know.
4799763	4801084	I have no desire to see the movie.
4802104	4802444	Fair enough.
4802484	4802965	Arcadian.
4804666	4805266	Fuck maybe.
4807802	4808702	I give it like a 7.5.
4808843	4811143	Alright, Loki.
4812823	4813583	I give it a 10.
4813683	4819644	I was specifically instructed by my girlfriend not to sing the song any longer, so I give it a 10.
4821325	4823285	I hope you don't sing that while you're trying to have sex.
4824045	4824725	Fuck yeah!
4824745	4825845	Fuck yeah!
4826325	4827226	That's beyond!
4830886	4833887	I give that song the same score I'd give the movie, a 4.
4834747	4834987	Angel.
4836798	4838379	No, a four out of ten.
4840421	4841982	Um, it was okay.
4842002	4843903	I was just going to see the movie last night.
4843923	4844984	That's what's important.
4846125	4847926	Um, five and a half.
4849347	4850007	Go see what?
4852369	4853950	You could go see a good movie instead.
4854210	4854691	Probably.
4858293	4858833	Seriously?
4859474	4862796	If you're going to go see a movie, go see The Grudge, but go on a school night where the kiddies can't go.
4862816	4863236	Alright.
4864858	4865118	Alright.
4866260	4869381	You've heard what we think, now it's time to hear what you think.
4869401	4875183	You're going to decide tonight's winner from three brand new songs while Loki throws pens at me in anger of my score.
4875623	4878464	Alright, let's hear a clip from all three songs you can vote for tonight.
4878544	4883346	Song number one you can vote for tonight is Reason by Ian Van Dow.
4885006	4891969	Time has come to set things right.
4892829	4895270	Is it worth another fight?
4896127	4902710	And song number two in tonight's cage match is Fisher Spooner vs. Billy Squire, Everybody Wants You To Emerge.
4916056	4920878	And song number three in tonight's cage match from the Team America World Police soundtrack, America, Fuck Yeah.
4933305	4935446	Place vote now.
4935566	4938488	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
4938548	4942610	Song number one, song number two, or Sky number three.
4943030	4944031	Song number three.
4944111	4945752	Your votes can decide it all.
4948013	4955277	Now, you know the scary thing, though, about that Fuck Yeah song is it's actually, if you took out the lyrics, it kind of sounds like a Guitar Freak song.
4955437	4956077	It really does.
4957978	4958799	Like an old one.
4959873	4960953	Wait, we're losing you there.
4961174	4962054	Adjust the bottom mic there.
4962334	4962814	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4962954	4963174	There we go.
4963214	4967256	Especially with the speeding up, like, bass drum part.
4968596	4969556	Or kick drum or whatever.
4969937	4974778	Just like the little synthesizers and everything kind of make it... Yeah.
4974858	4977219	Yeah, it makes it... It gives it that sound.
4978520	4978840	All right.
4978860	4979960	You know what it sounds like?
4979980	4980560	It sounds like PBR.
4980600	4981241	It's like PBR.
4981301	4982881	Like, the end of PBR, that's what it sounds like.
4983301	4983761	Kind of.
4983781	4984422	It sounds like PBR.
4985950	4988351	God, I haven't heard Limousine in a long, long time.
4988551	4989632	Limousine!
4990012	4990432	Strong bad.
4993834	4994875	Oh, boy, oh, boy.
4996075	4999517	I can't believe that this is the first time we've had to retire a song.
4999577	5004420	You know we've been doing the cage match for almost two years now, and that's the first time we've had to retire a song?
5004720	5006581	We actually haven't done the cage match since episode one.
5006621	5011003	It was something we added to the show when we went three hours on episode 20, I think?
5011123	5012564	Because the show only used to be two hours.
5013745	5013965	All right.
5015776	5019277	All right, what we're going to do now, we're going to try and get that connection that we had earlier.
5019357	5022437	We were trying to get frequency from the East Coast on the phone.
5022477	5023998	You guys, I'm sure you know this guy.
5024078	5028419	If you're on DDR Freak, if you're on Bomani Style, I think he's a mod on both those sites.
5028519	5030099	And he's definitely out there.
5030119	5032239	If you're on the East Coast, you definitely, definitely know who this guy is.
5032259	5037300	So we're going to give him a call because we want to ask him some questions that were kind of spawned from last week's show.
5037340	5040021	So let's have a look and see if we can get frequency on the show.
5041201	5041621	Hello?
5042081	5042961	Hi, is this frequency?
5043602	5044162	Yes, it is.
5044382	5045582	Hey, how are you doing?
5046075	5046455	I'm doing okay.
5046475	5047216	Fantastic.
5047236	5048277	The week was fine.
5048357	5048897	No problems there.
5048917	5049357	Oh, look at that.
5049377	5050738	There's an appearance from the guy next door.
5050758	5051098	That's great.
5075737	5081060	The guy next door has a ham radio, and I'd like to interfere with all the electronics in my house.
5081080	5082160	I guess so.
5105098	5112243	The East Coast Tournament was... The tournament itself wasn't really a good tournament, in my opinion.
5112383	5120868	A lot of the stuff just ran wrong and things weren't properly organized and things like that.
5121088	5130535	And we, after the entire thing was done with, we realized what the problems were and we're going to fix those for the next years and things like that.
5130635	5134157	But as publicity for DDR...
5135023	5135824	It's skyrocketed.
5136424	5138845	Yeah, now this is... Now, we actually had a caller last week.
5138905	5139726	Zachu called in.
5139786	5151953	He said something about the crowds that had come to the DDR tournament were bigger than the ones for, what, the Blue Man Group and... Yeah, it's literally... You could literally pick any exhibition there.
5151993	5157417	Blue Man Group was there for an hour, and Ludacris and some other Def Jam artists were there for a little while.
5158277	5159838	Opie and Anthony were there for a little while.
5159858	5160178	Oh, that's right.
5160198	5161339	Opie and Anthony was the other one he mentioned.
5162554	5163495	They're hacks anyway.
5163555	5163955	No, I'm kidding.
5181024	5190268	because these people were representing, I don't know, XM Radio and other, you know, like Opie Ante was at XM Radio for like an hour or something like that.
5190308	5196150	Obviously, they had a crowd for a little while, you know, but, you know, you can only stay so long and listen to Opie Ante, I guess.
5197230	5203113	But, yeah, everyone was, everyone just stayed and watched people step on arrows all day.
5203133	5203793	It was amazing.
5203893	5204693	It was truly amazing.
5204773	5205654	Even Perfect Attack?
5206514	5206714	Yeah.
5207473	5209434	More so than Freestyle, actually.
5209454	5214137	There was a lot of people watching Perfect Attack that were just like, wow, this is amazing how they do that.
5215317	5220320	And half the people are like, even though they don't know what they're doing, they still want to know how they do that.
5220700	5231026	But publicity-wise, Sammy, the person who put these two women together, and myself made them up.
5231568	5236112	A whole bunch of contacts on Thursday because the press was the people who were allowed on Thursday.
5236352	5239175	I was going to say, I bet a lot of press was at this event.
5239475	5240756	Yeah, we had a lot of press.
5243959	5248482	So does this mean we can be looking forward to seeing DDR in the news anytime soon?
5248522	5249123	Or in the press?
5249403	5250424	Some big stuff?
5252165	5254347	Maybe not in the news and the press.
5254988	5258711	There's already been enough stuff in the news and the press that it's in the wrong angle.
5259321	5260101	That's true.
5260421	5261442	I guess that's very true.
5262082	5262382	Okay.
5263043	5266784	The problem is that the angle is way lost.
5266844	5270005	Everyone likes that way lost angle, and everyone jumps on that.
5270065	5271866	I was at Fox News a couple weeks ago.
5272186	5276208	I was actually going to ask you about that, the Fox News thing.
5276408	5277609	I'll tell you exactly what happened.
5277629	5282170	What they did was, on Friday night, I get a call from these people.
5282791	5284331	And I'm like, yeah, sure, I'll come in.
5284351	5285512	They just want DDR.
5285552	5286972	I'm like, okay, I could do DDR.
5287473	5288253	So I come in.
5289171	5293516	Uh, next day, because that's when they want me for the interview, live, next day.
5293776	5294016	Right.
5294056	5298421	With no preparation, uh, I'm sitting in the briefing room, not getting briefs.
5298841	5304146	I was actually sitting next to the person who was interviewing me, and I had absolutely no idea, until, like, I was actually called in.
5304947	5305207	Wow.
5305408	5310072	And once, when I got into the studio, the first thing the girl says is, well, you're not a kid.
5311133	5312695	And I'm like, no, sorry.
5313533	5315473	Someone should have probably informed you about something, too.
5316234	5317694	They thought they were getting a 12-year-old?
5318134	5322995	Yeah, they thought a 12-year-old was going to end up coming in and doing an interview.
5323095	5334377	I remember that, because we were watching the clip here in studio during a show about a month ago, and we were having a little fun with how bad the interviewer was, the person who was interviewing you, and it sounded like she was talking down to you.
5334817	5340078	A lot of the questions she was asking, I remember, didn't she say at one point in the interview, gosh, how old are you?
5340822	5350207	Yeah, I was 21, but the thing that got me the most was when she said, you're part of the DDR freaks, and I'm like... Yeah, that bug does too.
5350347	5351087	Are you serious?
5351407	5352528	Are you serious?
5352628	5353708	What are you doing to me right now?
5353808	5355329	It's obvious they hadn't done any research.
5356170	5368856	So, like, I mean, I'm doing it for DDR, you know, to get the publicity up there for it, so even though it's just the wrong angle for it, I mean, I tried to jump onto, you know, the competition thing, she just tossed it right off of that, so...
5369795	5371136	Regardless, they're not ready for it.
5371616	5371856	Right.
5373337	5376938	But, you know, upcoming now... Wait, actually, I have a quick question for you.
5376958	5378479	I have a quick question for you, though, before we change the subject.
5378719	5381580	Do you think that part of that might be Konami's fault?
5381740	5383901	Because Konami's kind of going the way Los Angles with this?
5386983	5389203	Um... Konami hasn't done much.
5390644	5391444	I'll tell you right now.
5391564	5394306	They haven't done much in the publicity of DER.
5394466	5394706	They...
5395706	5402987	and they don't really need to because it just so happens that mixes keep selling, home mixes at least, keep selling.
5403407	5404508	Word of mouth is a powerful thing.
5405108	5406968	Yeah, it just happens.
5408448	5412449	People see these dance mats in the game stores and they're like, oh, what does that go with?
5412509	5416090	And they go with this DPR game and they buy it and take it home.
5416110	5423651	And there's a lot of people who actually play at home and they just don't know about the community behind it and its competition and how big this can really be.
5424858	5430703	So, Konami really actually doesn't do much, but this upcoming year, you might see some stuff coming out.
5431023	5431383	Interesting.
5431403	5433465	So I guess other little things you probably can't talk about?
5435026	5442271	I can talk about them, it's just that a lot of the stuff is, you know... You don't want to say anything and then not have it happen?
5443492	5446395	I'll say what we want to do, I'll say what we're planning.
5447135	5447495	Cool.
5447716	5448236	First off...
5449315	5456100	First off, Sammy and I have a meeting with Ziff Davis Media tomorrow at 11 a.m.
5456160	5458782	Aren't Ziff Davis Media the folks that run G4 Tech TV?
5459943	5460563	They might be.
5460623	5463626	I'm not too sure about the whole business.
5464406	5470491	But I know that these are the people who put together the actual convention last weekend.
5470711	5471111	Ah, okay.
5471732	5477976	And they got Microsoft and XM and Intel and Best Buy and all those other companies to come down and, you know...
5479088	5480729	and so on.
5480929	5488792	They were so interested in our place that they want us to set up the next year's tournament now with sponsors.
5491374	5497196	They want all these companies that came to the convention to help sponsor us in whatever way possible.
5497616	5501558	We're looking at a really big grand prize at the end of it.
5502879	5505440	No real dollar amount has been set.
5506082	5512087	We're looking at something huge, something enough to get many more people to end up coming out.
5513308	5517492	Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is coming off the heels of a $1,000 grand prize tournament, correct?
5517992	5518193	Yes.
5518253	5519414	And you guys are talking about something bigger?
5520214	5520454	Right.
5520675	5520915	Wow.
5521856	5523677	Very nice.
5523717	5530423	The $1,000 was actually put up by Sammy, but if we have people like Microsoft who want to put up
5530914	5531194	and so on.
5550807	5555071	Another meeting I have coming up soon is with Fuse TV.
5555091	5556573	I don't know if you guys get that out there.
5557293	5558654	They used to be Much Music, right?
5558694	5559415	Weren't they Much Music?
5559755	5560756	And then they turned into Fuse?
5561177	5562398	I think that sounds about right.
5562438	5563919	I think it's a subscription channel out here.
5564700	5564980	Yeah.
5565180	5565781	But I've heard of them.
5565801	5570104	So, I have a producer contact that I actually made.
5570245	5571666	He absolutely adores the game.
5571706	5574328	He just found it on Thursday when he showed up.
5574949	5576430	And he absolutely adores the game.
5577483	5587570	I have a meeting with him in a couple of weeks and we're going to pitch an idea, both together, to Fuse about a weekly DDR show.
5588211	5589732	A weekly DDR show?
5589972	5590893	Weekly, right.
5590913	5594475	Not some kind of DDR special you're talking about like a weekly DDR show?
5595056	5596517	Right, exactly.
5596737	5602881	We're probably looking at, like the only idea was that so far that I've had was a weekly tournament.
5604124	5607966	Is this the OMG DDR game show that people have talked about for years?
5609007	5610187	I've never heard of that, actually.
5611568	5617231	I see these threads occasionally on the message board where they're like, OMG DDR game show type thing, could DDR be a game show?
5617971	5632278	Maybe it's just that it's a couple years ago, and I'm... I don't know, it just seems like I've seen these kind of ideas going around before where people are like, OMG, they should have a DDR TV show and stuff, and now you're saying that that's exactly what you're going to go pitch in a couple weeks.
5633774	5635975	It's probably not going to end up being a game show.
5636055	5642920	It's going to be something like... Do you remember... I don't even know if you guys have this out here.
5642940	5646662	Do you guys remember when they had this thing called the WMCA Championships?
5647222	5648723	It was a martial arts championship.
5650006	5651346	I actually remember this.
5651386	5653247	It was a lot like the WWF, except it was karate.
5653267	5654667	I do remember seeing a couple episodes of this.
5654687	5655988	It used to be on Channel 31, remember?
5656008	5657948	I think I want to do something similar to that.
5657968	5661969	You know, like, porno ends up meeting the real world in MTV kind of thing.
5676309	5676950	and many more.
5697714	5724375	Yeah, we're not gonna, we're gonna, you know, we're probably gonna show how people train, and maybe do some interviews, and maybe some little cute skits in there, but a lot of it's gonna be in the, uh, in my, you know, my thing, we're gonna actually just end up doing, like, a weekly tournament, you know, like Red Team vs. Blue Team, you know, try to ham it up for a little while, maybe like a BattleBots kind of thing, where every, like, month we end up doing a championship, or every few months or something like that, and they get some kind of crazy trophy that we, like, you know, pass around.
5724755	5725276	Interesting.
5725296	5726377	Do you guys think...
5729545	5731766	Do you guys think you would run into any resistance from Konami?
5732926	5734067	Funny you bring that up.
5734427	5741830	Sammy actually got a call last week from someone from Konami who happens to actually end up being the VP.
5743951	5748813	The VP is very, very interested in sponsoring the tournament in 2005.
5749514	5750494	Interesting.
5750894	5755096	Yes, and considering now that we have this contact here, which is going to be...
5755842	5756483	and many more.
5773069	5775991	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5800009	5809855	EDR comes up on the television, maybe ESPN or whatever, and everyone knows what a great is and how many greats a JSB gets on this song.
5809875	5819361	Everyone knows the stats and knows the players and roots for their favorite team, like the New York Blue Impulse versus the California Trip Machines or whatever.
5820742	5821642	That's what we're looking to do.
5821802	5824584	That's a hell of a goal, but that's a neat goal.
5826465	5828026	Loki, you look like you want to say something here.
5828851	5829791	That's what we're pushing for.
5830431	5834192	I want to expect that there's going to be a huge jump in publicity in this next coming year.
5834492	5835132	I hope so.
5835372	5836673	But, like, you know, I don't know.
5836733	5844054	It seems like it's going to be about as popular as Extreme Dodgeball or, you know, everything like that.
5844454	5848155	It might end up being looking like that, at least for this first year coming.
5848815	5858097	But with a lot of the more context that we're getting, you know, especially Konami, it looks like there might be more push for it.
5859144	5869293	You know, considering it's a new genre of video game, it's already a sport in Norway, you know, so it's got potential.
5870114	5874618	It reminds me though of like that webcomic that's 10K Commotion or whatever.
5875098	5879943	It's just like, you know, with all the DDR drama and then you have the teams competing in a giant like tournament thing.
5880243	5882005	It just, it seems a lot like that.
5882165	5884567	Not that it's a bad idea, I think it's a pretty cool idea.
5885461	5887322	Well, you know, there's drama everywhere.
5887342	5893123	There's drama in Sublubrities and stuff like that, so it's not going to be, you know, more common.
5893363	5902226	I'll tell you what, if you ever want to take the DDR drama angle with this show, like Degrassi DDR League or whatever, I could give you pages and pages of real-life fire drama.
5902246	5903786	No, no, I don't have pages and pages.
5903926	5907107	I think just about everyone knows I have pages and pages.
5907127	5909288	You know, getting out of the tournament last week, I, you know...
5910094	5915236	A lot of the people actually ended up thanking, you know, Sammy for putting together the tournament, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5915796	5920157	And to tell you the truth, Sammy screwed up a lot of things about the tournament.
5920637	5926879	And there were a lot of things that if he was more prepared, he would have actually ended up, you know, doing a better work with it.
5927279	5930820	You know, and I ended up trying to fix a lot of the behind-the-scenes and things like that.
5931360	5933261	And a lot of people don't even remember me being there.
5933721	5937522	You know, and it's annoying to one extent, and it's not...
5938171	5946256	Too bad in another, because, you know, I kind of don't want to be attached to the tournament, because of the tournament being actually too bad, and I'm more attached to what happened otherwise.
5947116	5959383	But, I mean, there was this one incident during freestyle where a team element from upstate New York came in to do the routine, obviously, to DICE.
5960584	5965967	And what happened was, they went up for the first time, and Sammy wasn't ready with the camera.
5967142	5972964	So Sammy says, wait, wait, wait, and tells one of the other staff members to reset the machine while they're at mid-play.
5973185	5976206	Well, not mid-play, but they actually got into about 10 seconds of the routine.
5977606	5979907	So Sammy goes, oh, I didn't know they started already.
5979927	5980608	That would have been fine.
5980648	5981248	Don't worry about it.
5981668	5982368	Just start up again.
5982728	5983829	So they're like, OK, fine.
5983989	5984909	So they start up again.
5985089	5987190	And the problem here was that they forgot Mirror.
5987811	5989971	And we actually ended up forgetting to put Event Mode on.
5990392	5992713	But that wouldn't have mattered if they wouldn't have failed.
5993833	5996134	So what happened was they ended up actually failing
5996661	6000782	Halfway through the song, you know, the fail screen comes up because they forgot to put Mirror on.
6001122	6001502	Bummer.
6002302	6002583	You know.
6003483	6011805	So then they go ahead and they're like, oh, what the fuck, you know, we had it right the first time, blah blah blah, and then we're like, okay, you know, we'll just go again and we'll figure out something later.
6011845	6019307	So they went again, they finished their routine, you know, and we figured out, you know, I was, right in the beginning, I said they're disqualified.
6019467	6023648	And the reason I said that was because
6024508	6027631	When you do a routine, everything about the routine is routine.
6028552	6035798	When you put options on, when you put your clothes on, when you do the routine, everything is routine.
6035879	6040563	There's no real excuse of not putting an option on.
6040583	6044246	So you're saying the second they turn the machine over to you, it's routine time?
6044927	6046148	Right, exactly.
6046248	6050312	Once you have the option of choosing a song, making your options, blah, blah, blah, blah,
6051354	6056421	It's routine to you, and it's part of the routine that's going to come out on the show to us.
6056541	6056921	You know what?
6057622	6066174	I can see why you're coming from that angle, though, because a lot of what you just talked to us about, about this DDR TV show and stuff, you kind of were talking a little bit about kind of the hype
6066554	6070756	There's also a lot of the problem that people just aren't prepared for freestyle anymore.
6089639	6092241	There's no real big pot for freestyle anymore.
6092481	6094322	You know, everyone wants the expert tech.
6094383	6095643	No one really freestyles.
6095703	6097665	No one really thinks they're good at freestyle.
6097765	6099146	People think they're good at freestyle.
6099206	6099987	They really aren't.
6100367	6107092	You know, it's just like, there's not a lot of people that jump out there, get the job done, you know, and look awesome doing it.
6107332	6108893	At least out here I've seen it.
6109253	6115418	You know, people just, you know, don't put themselves together and make a good routine.
6115970	6126157	To tell you the truth, when I did the Sports World Tournament two years back for Drifting Away, I actually was planning to do insertion for a month.
6126577	6133942	I did this routine for about three, three and a half weeks, putting together every step, every arrow, how to move to a blah, blah, blah.
6135363	6140266	And at the end of it all, about three or four days before the competition, I scrapped the whole thing.
6140907	6141007	Okay.
6141690	6146953	I don't even know why, I think I just got sick of it, or whatever, and I ended up doing Drifting Away.
6147673	6155177	The day before, I literally slapped together, won the whole tournament, and that was the story about that.
6155197	6162380	Well, you know, the practice of building the other routine, though, probably kind of helped in making the second routine, right?
6162420	6164501	Did you end up taking elements of your insertion routine?
6166762	6168083	Well, I don't know, like,
6168587	6170728	There was more leeway with drifting away.
6170768	6172429	Drifting away is such a trickle, no freeze.
6172449	6175250	It has no arrows for the first half of it.
6176810	6180072	You'll see me get off the pad and do whatever for a while.
6180092	6182473	I had more freedom to do what I wanted with insertion.
6182493	6183693	There was a whole lot of arrows.
6183753	6187375	I just loved the saw insertion, but the problem was there were so many arrows.
6187435	6191916	There was a lot of stuff to work with, and there was a big risk of me failing.
6191976	6198239	I don't like the total big risk of failing, at least back when I was actually competing.
6198658	6203060	Well, no, I might be competing soon because of the tournament last week.
6203441	6212306	What happened was Sketch and Visor had a first place routine, and it was a phenomenal routine.
6212426	6221391	They got inspired through a lot of my stuff, but I kind of got inspired to go ahead and beat their routine with something that I'll come out with later.
6221511	6225713	And I have ideas in my head that are jumping around, and I can't really tell...
6226638	6230599	Not because I don't want to, but because I'm not sure when I'm going to compete.
6231960	6241743	But I want it to be in a place that we're going to tape it and show it online, unlike the dropout freestyle that's still sitting on my side and no one knows what it looks like, not even me.
6243044	6244144	Very interesting.
6244945	6246485	So that's my plans.
6247225	6253808	It's a lot of video publicity and I guess some freestyle on a personal note.
6253828	6254328	Okay.
6255100	6272325	Well, I know we've been taking up a lot of your time here, but I do have one other question I want to ask you, because it has to do with something that the caller last week had brought up, about hearing something about, and I don't know if you can confirm or deny this, but he had said something about DDR maybe going out on tour with a rap artist.
6273085	6275486	Is this a load of crap, or what is it?
6276186	6279927	Well, actually, before we go to that, I'll tell you one thing that's up on Thursday.
6279967	6282488	Spike TV came up to us and said,
6282907	6284368	said, is it DDR Machine for Rentals?
6284388	6289231	And we're like, well, yeah, because DDR Machine Rentals, that's one of the companies that was obviously Sammy's.
6289431	6289691	Right.
6290491	6301978	And they go, oh, because we have this video game award show that happens in California.
6302198	6302678	That's right.
6303679	6307181	We talked about this on one of our other shows, the Spike TV's first annual show, yeah.
6307301	6309982	Right, they want the DDR Machine at the after party.
6310763	6311043	Oh, okay.
6311730	6320732	Yeah, so, but the problem is it's kind of out of the range, and, you know, because obviously that's the west coast, and the east coast, and it's a very long haul for that DVR machine.
6321032	6321332	Right.
6321352	6332214	You know, on Sammy's own, because Sammy only has like a coverage range, and outside the coverage range is a lot of, a lot of, you know, money involved to try to get it out of that.
6332514	6333174	Absolutely.
6333754	6340835	But on to the rap artists, so basically what happened was, we were in the middle of the tour month, out of a ludicrous and
6341434	6343415	and the film label were there.
6343515	6348698	And someone noticed it, obviously, because it was actually probably on the other side of the screen.
6349698	6352340	Like, ludicrous, it was probably on the other side of the curtain from where we were.
6352920	6354301	And I actually ended up seeing them.
6354341	6371009	But someone, a representative from their production label, came up specifically to me, because it looked like I was doing, and they're like, and they asked me, is this, you know, for rent, or is there even a possibility of taking the machine on tour?
6372009	6376875	and uh... you know, I was like, wow, you know, you want to have this thing on tour?
6376975	6379238	That's pretty cool, you know, you can talk to Sammy.
6379719	6382823	You know, so the person from Ludacris...
6384410	6389693	production label is asking for the DDR Machine to be on tour with them sometime next spring or summer.
6390133	6390793	Interesting.
6391273	6393434	Now, what I'd be curious about, though, is it on tour?
6393454	6400538	Because you know how sometimes the big celebrities with their rock and roll lifestyle, or in this case, rap lifestyle, they've got all the stuff that they have in their trailer and stuff.
6400578	6405480	Is this DDR Machine for him to be using in his posse, or is it something he wants to have out there?
6406081	6407541	I have no idea what he wants to do with it.
6407601	6411043	It's just the fact, you know, it's just kind of funny that he wants it, you know.
6412123	6413264	That's the thing that, like, you know,
6413843	6418085	You know, jumped on it, like, I mean, Sammy has that contact information, I don't know what they're doing with that.
6418205	6423628	Yeah, because when I think about famous pairs, I don't really envision Ludacris and DDR, but whatever floats your boat.
6424128	6428010	You know what, you're going to see a lot of stupid stuff soon, I'm going to tell you right now.
6429050	6435233	There's going to be people in the sporting industry playing DDR, I'm positive, it's just going to happen once it gets big.
6435593	6440035	Good, we need more stuff to make fun of here on our little program, so bring on all the silly stuff.
6440616	6443077	Oh yeah, there'll be plenty of silly stuff coming, I'm sure of it.
6444542	6452624	But like I said, people will know once the show, if it actually ends up happening, the weekly show, people will know.
6452644	6457465	We'll both be on DVR Freak and be MontyStyle because I obviously am both affiliated with both sites.
6458185	6467667	So you will find out through both of those sites that something will be going down at any point in time, whether it be the 2005 huge tournament or, you know,
6470491	6471032	and so on.
6494042	6497163	Definitely a lot of very interesting stuff it sounds like you've got coming up in the future.
6497183	6502163	Yeah, I'll expect something good is going to happen next year.
6506684	6512385	There's even talk, I don't even know if I want to say this, people are probably going to jump out of their seats.
6512985	6522647	Because of the media that we've received and this call from Konami that we also got, this big uproar that actually happened in only a week or so,
6524099	6527581	We have the possibility of requesting a new arcade mix.
6529221	6530542	I'm jumping out of my seat!
6531803	6532323	You're right.
6533764	6534564	No, we're okay.
6534604	6538346	People are now like, the people are like, now they're like, wait a minute, wait, what did he just say?
6538386	6539106	A new arcade mix?
6539286	6541908	Honestly, here it is, though.
6542108	6542948	You know what, though?
6543048	6543608	Here's the thing.
6543748	6545369	I'm scared of this being wolf.
6546150	6547850	It's not definite, okay?
6547950	6551172	It's not something that's like, wow, okay, we're really doing this.
6551612	6553133	It's a possibility because...
6554539	6565661	America's now finding out about DDR, and it's a real big thing now that at this convention that happened, the public's like, wow, DDR?
6566041	6567321	Oh, wow, this is an amazing game.
6567501	6569142	Oh, wow, let's put this thing on TV.
6569162	6570682	We're going to push it, push it, push it.
6571202	6572982	And they're going to be bootleg illegal mixes.
6573723	6574683	Yeah, right?
6575083	6580844	Well, because Konami's going to notice this, obviously, because they called us, they're going to...
6581914	6586059	We hope they're going to help us out and show us, here, look, we got a new arcade mix for you.
6586079	6587020	You know, how does that sound?
6588582	6589183	Interesting.
6590725	6593308	Loki is convinced it's not going to happen.
6594109	6594489	What's that?
6594669	6596572	Loki is convinced over here it's not going to happen.
6597933	6598975	Well, you know what?
6599155	6599775	Prove him wrong.
6600598	6608323	Some of us gave up on thinking that another one was going to come out, and some of us were like, I hope there's something else that comes out.
6608783	6616527	And then there's obviously people out there that are still steadfast, and I know Extreme 2 is coming, I know it's coming.
6617948	6627934	So me and Sammy, because of the love of the game, want to push for the new arcade mix to come out, because the USA stuff is kind of like...
6630023	6636485	Sleepy, and PutTogetherBadly, and Spell of Marvelous is with two L's, and things like that.
6636585	6649968	So we want to see a new arcade mix put together, and even if it ends up being a home version like Six Fix was, still something else that's not in the group.
6649988	6650228	Definitely.
6650408	6653349	Here's my advice to you, though.
6657225	6661329	If Konami's going to do it, make sure Hawaii's involved.
6661509	6662489	Hawaii?
6662550	6664431	Konami Hawaii, the folks that did Ultramix 2.
6665012	6665692	Oh my god, no.
6666133	6667253	Oh my god, you've got to be kidding me.
6667274	6668374	You're not a fan of Ultramix 2?
6669075	6669936	Let me tell you right now.
6670536	6674560	When Ultramix 1 came out, I thought it was all Tornamix.
6675300	6683287	I thought Tornamix decided to go ahead and put together a mix from Hawaii and send it out to people.
6684609	6698059	Looking at Ready Steady Go, when the thing speeds up to 280 BPM for absolutely no reason, you have all these songs in here that, you know, Quickening is a six-footer?
6698099	6698880	How do you do that?
6699480	6701702	How do you put Quickening as a six-footer?
6702442	6703043	I'll give you that.
6703103	6703603	I'll give you that.
6703623	6706065	You got a good point.
6706105	6707986	How do you do that?
6708046	6712409	So with Ultramix 2 coming out, what's on there?
6712449	6713390	Is Maximizer on there?
6714311	6716333	No, that's on DDR Extreme.
6716493	6718775	So I was going to say, here's the other half of that.
6719095	6724359	Okay, now if KOJ does it, then you're going to have Marvelous with two L's, and you're going to have Karaoke Revolution crossovers.
6724660	6726741	So it's kind of like Damned if you do, Damned if you don't.
6727582	6733106	It's just that they need to be aware of what, you know, the people who want the game want.
6733287	6742394	You know, I understand that they're trying to get another group of people, the people who play K-Round, you know, if they do get the long versions like that, or...
6743072	6746314	You know, they're trying to get a different group of people putting U.S.
6746354	6752356	songs in there like Move Your Feet and, you know, Afrika Bambaataa's songs.
6752937	6754978	You know, they're trying to get, you know, the U.S.
6755038	6755718	into their U.S.
6755778	6758619	mixes, but it's not up to that.
6758679	6768284	It's up to, you know, good songs like In the Arcade Extreme and good step charts and things like that that, you know,
6770285	6776268	Push for people to play that are real hardcore players and people that aren't even hardcore players that are even actually into playing.
6776308	6780990	I mean, the regular public doesn't understand that this mix, you know, has faults to it.
6781330	6781550	Right.
6781610	6781950	That's very true.
6781970	6785972	They just play the game, they see arrows, and, you know, obviously once they get into it, they'll realize.
6786492	6789173	But, you know, and that's all they want to really go for.
6789213	6795676	If they actually end up getting the shit together, you know, then this will actually, you know, could be ending up being good.
6796449	6808794	If we have some kind of affiliation with Konami, I mean, if I have an affiliation with Konami at any point in time where I can say what we should put on a mix, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
6809915	6810355	Very good.
6812156	6823320	I can't see another home version song with some stupid step chart that looks like it's from... Yes, please, no hand plants in DER.
6823480	6824601	Please, no hand plants.
6825174	6829916	Listen, I can go on an entire different show right now with you next week talking about how much I hate In The Groove.
6830136	6840499	Well, actually, we're not going to be on next week, but I would love to have... Well, regardless, I could totally go on for hours and hours about how much I hate it, but... I would love to have you back on the show sometime and we can dish on In The Groove.
6841099	6841419	Oh, man.
6841519	6845901	Because I actually... I was on the East Coast not that long ago and I got to go to In On The Break and I got to check it out.
6846721	6849402	And if I could sum it up in one word, interesting.
6850142	6850602	Interesting.
6850702	6851183	That's good.
6851263	6851723	That's good.
6852123	6852223	Um...
6852774	6854215	Interesting is definitely a good word for it.
6855595	6866581	But yeah, to tell you the truth, I know I'm on all these big forums and everything, but if you see me on itgfreak.com, you'll see me flaming everyone.
6867774	6868715	All I do is flame.
6868735	6870936	I actually, I think I just registered just to flame me in the group.
6871317	6875760	See, now you're just adding back into this DDR drama, the drama thing that you were talking about earlier.
6876601	6878342	Yeah, that's all I do, because you know what?
6878482	6880503	They just, they really didn't care.
6880864	6883966	I can almost tell that they didn't care.
6884386	6890711	Or the people out there that they're like, oh, I can make arrows and, you know, put arrows to the song, and no one cares what they look like.
6892052	6895835	You know, it's really frustrating to look at that and have this be put out to...
6897113	6900335	You know, arcades and have people play it, you know, or at least attempt to play it.
6901095	6911001	I mean, when it first came out, it just, it didn't have a lot of, well, it had a lot of, like, wow, another, you know, dancing game, but now no one's playing it anymore over here.
6911421	6912061	Interesting.
6912081	6914222	Well, we'll get more of your thoughts on In the Groove a little later.
6914582	6916784	We've taken up, like, over a half hour of your time.
6916864	6918805	Thank you very much for being on the show tonight.
6920225	6920946	Keep in touch with us.
6921026	6924028	Don't forget about us when you're off doing all these projects and stuff.
6924048	6926629	You're welcome back on the show anytime to give us an update on what's going on.
6927048	6927968	and best of luck to you, man.
6928289	6928769	Sounds exciting.
6928789	6929149	All right, baby.
6929549	6929829	All right.
6930169	6930550	Talk to you.
6930590	6931130	Have a good one.
6931470	6931690	Later.
6931810	6931990	Bye.
6932210	6932450	Bye.
6933411	6933931	Wow.
6934992	6937353	Lots of interesting stuff in that interview.
6938053	6939374	Lots and lots of interesting stuff.
6939874	6942935	I didn't realize what the hell they're cooking up over there on the East Coast.
6943015	6945396	Don't we feel out of the loop now over here on the West?
6945456	6946717	That's very interesting.
6947117	6951299	So, Guy, how can we sum up that whole thing for people that joined us halfway through that interview there?
6951319	6953420	Because we've been talking to Frequency for about the past half hour there.
6954421	6957605	DDR going on tour with Ludacris next spring.
6957645	6958967	We don't know to what extent.
6959447	6960068	What did he say?
6960108	6967758	He's talking to Fuse TV about some type of DDR show that right now could, could not be pitched.
6968177	6971339	with a WWE-ish element, or actually that wasn't the analogy.
6971359	6971779	What did he say?
6971799	6973100	The karate show.
6973120	6975481	The ultimate fighting championship.
6975521	6976582	Yeah, the fighting championship.
6976602	6979643	He was saying maybe like a BattleBots type of thing, where it's like a tournament.
6979683	6981204	Very interesting to see what happens with that.
6981784	6984386	Lots of producer contacts apparently at that.
6984786	6989248	DDR could be showing up a lot in the media in the next few months, and it won't be about weight loss.
6990969	6991770	And that's great.
6992130	6994251	And the more exposure that DDR gets in the media...
6994696	6996777	I remember when we used to have new DDR Max came out
7025855	7033762	You know, that show sounds like it needs like wacky, very informative commentators on that.
7033962	7043711	Some people with like radio experience and some DDR experience and just, you know, someone that's been in the community for a while.
7044753	7047214	Hmm, who could that be?
7047234	7050616	Quit trying to whore yourself out to everybody, Loki.
7051276	7051936	Seriously.
7052457	7053417	Alright, damn, you know what?
7053457	7053957	I need a break.
7054437	7059880	Thanks to Frequency for spending... That was like... Looking at the little timer going on there, that was over 30 minutes of chat.
7059940	7060340	Yeah.
7060720	7062321	I think a break is a good call.
7062381	7065763	Yeah, Jamie appreciates it too, because she's got a lot of work on her poster done over there, right?
7065783	7066463	My posters are done.
7067143	7067604	There you go.
7067624	7068084	They're done.
7068224	7069624	No, I was listening... No, I know you were.
7069644	7070025	I know you were.
7070345	7070705	It's just...
7072003	7076786	I have this thing at work, but I have to have ten posters done, and I've got five done.
7077106	7077526	No worries.
7077626	7080668	And I need a moment to tally up those cage match votes, since it is.
7080728	7086551	So we're going to tally up the cage match votes, and just take ourselves a nice little break here, because, damn, we need a break after that.
7086611	7090613	So we're going to do a break here of some, um, how about some 2DX songs?
7090653	7093334	I want to do a couple, a couple 2DX songs.
7093354	7097336	We'll start it off with one of my, let's do one we haven't heard in a while here.
7097356	7099237	I'm going to do one from 2DX Fifth Style.
7099857	7100978	I'm going to do the cube first.
7101451	7102331	and then we'll do Get On Beat.
7102532	7103632	I'll try to get that in there too.
7104092	7105273	And we'll be back in a little bit.
7105293	7106313	We're going to do the FUs of the Week.
7107294	7112336	We're going to let you know who won the cage match and who knows what else when we come back.
7112776	7114997	Alright, we'll get to Loki as well when we come back.
7201884	7202725	Thanks for watching!
7258445	7259767	Thank you for watching!
7293484	7295266	Thanks for watching!
7346793	7353957	Oh, yeah, I was just playing.
7354017	7355017	Uh, hey, guys, don't say me.
7355037	7355718	Don't say my name.
7355738	7356298	Don't say my name.
7392952	7394114	Thanks for watching!
7464031	7464873	Thanks for watching!
7521772	7522953	Thank you for watching!
7579983	7581604	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
7581904	7586847	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
7587567	7593691	But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
7594011	7595932	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
7596492	7600795	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
7601255	7602796	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7602816	7604397	We gotta get Mel back on the show at some point.
7604417	7606538	You know, he was gonna be here a couple weeks ago, but something came up.
7606698	7608239	So, we gotta get him back on the show.
7609127	7610548	We need all our favorites back on the show.
7611749	7612890	We'll have our people go get them.
7613070	7615752	Yeah, we'll have our people talk to their people, etc., etc.
7616993	7619995	So, there's some other news going out there in the music and rhythm game world.
7620035	7624138	We've just spent the past half hour edition on DDR, but there are other games going on out there.
7624539	7627541	One thing I wanted to talk about, Taiko Drum Master, actually.
7627581	7631044	We've kind of mentioned this a couple times in the past few weeks.
7631504	7634546	Taiko Drum Master is going to have its release on Tuesday, we're hearing.
7634646	7636308	Angel, you've been kind of reading about this one.
7636328	7637889	Are you planning on picking this game up, or...?
7638894	7640535	Yep, I'm going to try to pick it up.
7642455	7652119	One of the sites I usually frequent to buy games says that the listed price is $69.99, and for PS2, obviously, you guys know that.
7654080	7660923	However, it doesn't state that there's going to be a controller included, like they did with Donkey Konga for the GameCube.
7661203	7663504	For $69.99, there damn well better be.
7663864	7664724	I hope so, yeah.
7665745	7667826	There should be one, obviously, so...
7669533	7675818	$49.99 is the most I've ever heard them charging for a video game, and that's for top-shelf games like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, things like that.
7676879	7677079	Right.
7677379	7681923	Hey, but Rob, you remember how much I played for Samba de Amigo back in the day?
7682844	7688468	Paid $80 for the US controller and, what was the game, $50 for the game?
7689689	7690229	Back in the day.
7690730	7695053	I think the only game I've seen more expensive to import was Parapara back when it was at its height.
7696762	7704606	My DDR2 mix on Dreamcast, when Dan bought it for me, the game was $75, and he spent $80 on my dance pad.
7706387	7707067	Damn!
7707648	7711590	And I sort of acquired somebody else's dance pad.
7714211	7723196	Now, if Namco's smart, they've got one song in Taiko Drum Master, they can be riding the wave of success off of one of their other games right now.
7726854	7731815	Katamari Damacy, the Katamari on the Rocks theme, is in Taiko Drum Master.
7732696	7738117	See, now that little green guy, I bet you anything that little green guy is going to become a little spokesman for Namco.
7739677	7742018	Katamari Damacy is a huge thing.
7742378	7743638	Of course, they've got their staple.
7743658	7744899	The Namco is a pretty good company.
7746189	7754574	They're allowed to have more than one mascot, just like Nintendo's got Mario, and Link, Luigi, and who the hell else?
7754674	7757176	Not Mario, Wario!
7758356	7762099	You finally got a chance to get your own copy of Kanamari Damashii this week, right?
7763239	7763499	Yeah.
7763700	7764000	Yeah.
7764400	7767582	So, were you playing it at all, or you said you were watching?
7768206	7769107	I was playing at some.
7769147	7770108	I played, like, at 3 a.m.
7770248	7772230	I was like, okay, these mushrooms are tripping me out.
7772270	7772730	I'm going to bed.
7786343	7791187	But it's kind of like, it feels like it's become the internet's latest mail-forward type thing.
7791207	7795070	Where it's like, it's really funny, but you're going to get sick of it in a month.
7795090	7798132	It's like, shut up about that goddamn ball-rolling game already.
7800354	7800754	I don't know.
7801515	7801655	Nope.
7803925	7809190	I'm sorry, but, you know, it is human nature to love smashing things with a ball.
7809970	7813393	Rolling over stuff has been with us ever since the automobile.
7814214	7821580	Since the automobile can smash objects like small squirrels and stuff, it's been our desire to find those small objects to roll over.
7822381	7827205	And the fact that the ball is sticky and holds more objects to make an even larger ball, that's even better.
7829827	7831549	That was beautiful, I think.
7832139	7842863	I like running over buildings, and picking up cows, and the stupid dog that keeps trying to run into you.
7843723	7850646	Okay, I was in this one part where this dog kept trying to butt into me, so I ran over the dog later on, and that was gratifying.
7853727	7857008	Now see, in our chat room, here we go, we have one that says, I'm sick of it already.
7857328	7859769	It's just like Super Monkey Ball, come on!
7859869	7861410	Now see, Super Monkey Ball I never got into.
7862082	7863003	Monkey Ball is cool.
7863063	7864304	It's cute and all, but I never got into it.
7865465	7867306	It's like the Parappa for this generation.
7868006	7868867	Generation, what am I saying?
7868887	7869748	This year, you know?
7870208	7873450	Because you know how Parappa hit and then kind of blew over?
7873470	7878314	We're going to have like, you know, Katamari Damacy 2 is coming out, and then there's going to be like, I think a theme.
7878935	7881336	There should be like, like Katamari Party.
7884659	7886220	Mario Party, just with the little prince.
7887763	7892306	I was going to say that the game's got its little cult following now, so it's kind of funny.
7893707	7898951	I was going to mention that VGCats jumped on it as soon as the game got released.
7900292	7903334	For those of you that don't know what VGCats is... It took them quite a while, actually, to get on it.
7904615	7911680	Yeah, but... Anyway, I was going to say VGCats is an online comic for video games and stuff.
7911920	7913882	Interesting.
7913942	7914322	Interesting.
7914844	7918847	Alright, okay, let's get back on topic to talking about rhythm and music games here.
7919288	7922270	Loki had some things he wanted to talk about with you guys, some news that's going on.
7922631	7926354	Now you, I guess there's some remix contests going on that just finished up.
7926414	7927755	What happened with remixing?
7928607	7942213	Both DDR, it's like DDR Remix, which is just DDR Maniacs' contest, which didn't have quite a turnout as, but my sales, Remix Contest 1.5 or whatever that was.
7943374	7945735	But anyways, there's some pretty cool stuff that came out of those.
7947075	7954819	First I'll talk about the DDR Maniacs 1, the Remix competition, because it's actually not done.
7955139	7957220	They're in voting right now, but they have the...
7959520	7963623	The songs that were out there, so I'm going to play a few of these here.
7963643	7966044	Actually, let me adjust my volume here.
7967225	7975551	There was actually only four people that entered this, which is kind of a little sad.
7975591	7976151	A little sad.
7977492	7981795	There was two by, you know, you might recognize DJ Potato.
7982395	7984497	I'm trying to find these here.
7984637	7985257	What do I have?
7985918	7986038	Um...
7988732	7988992	DJ Potato
8004278	8005678	There was only five entries.
8005718	8006999	Two of them were his.
8007039	8010860	They were actually... And I can play them for you guys.
8011320	8024144	It was actually some work that he did, sort of, kind of, with the Bomani Rock album, but not... It's just a piano and saxophone sort of remixes of... What the hell?
8025404	8026204	What the hell was that?
8026544	8030845	Yeah, give us a little clip of one of these songs here.
8031886	8032786	Okay, well, let's see here.
8032806	8032846	Um...
8033527	8037548	We'll start off with... Let's see, these are old.
8040288	8041048	Oh, I know, I know.
8041688	8044529	Okay, we're going to start off with... They had one of Kind Lady.
8045309	8046809	He actually did a few of these.
8046849	8048690	He has, like, D2R 1998.
8050270	8053350	Kind Lady, there was another one, too.
8053390	8056591	I can't remember what it was offhand, but... Anyways.
8057891	8058851	Let's see here.
8061212	8062272	Okay, this one...
8063675	8073558	Right here is going to be DJ Potato Piano Concentrato Shut up!
8074378	8077599	I don't need your fancy English-English talk, okay?
8078340	8079260	It's Italian!
8080060	8080560	Whatever.
8081281	8081781	European.
8082121	8085802	We do not formally recognize European nations, okay?
8085842	8086862	I just want you to know that.
8087203	8088563	They do not exist to me.
8090066	8091467	and your psychotic little universe.
8123437	8124438	Anyways.
8124458	8127199	Keep in mind, I played saxophone for like 12 years.
8127419	8129420	You're listening to KOLR Smooth Jazz.
8153154	8155977	So that was that.
8156818	8162023	Anyways, that was one of the songs that was in there.
8162043	8164065	There were some other remixes, but not a lot.
8165366	8168850	However, the Bomani Style remix competition was a little different.
8169050	8169911	There was quite a bit there.
8170571	8177078	I saved some of these really kick-ass ones on here because there were a few that were like, and even the judges said, what the hell is this?
8177634	8179415	But, you know, there's always going to be something like that.
8179495	8183277	So, some of the ones I'd like to point out, which were pretty cool.
8185039	8185739	Let's see here.
8186639	8188521	Some of them you've heard before on this show.
8188921	8189341	Klunk Klunk 2004.
8189681	8193784	Now, that was DM Ashura.
8195145	8196125	And that was pretty sweet.
8203149	8205951	Okay, anyways, that one.
8206351	8206712	And then...
8207950	8212256	We've got my personal favorite, Dazed and Destroyed.
8212576	8216321	I loved this one before when it was only a clip of the song, but that's the whole thing.
8216742	8224052	The second half is kind of, eh, it's okay, but I mean, it's pretty well done for, um, it's a remix of Hysteria, so, pretty sweet.
8249645	8251648	It's a really cool song, trust me with that.
8251728	8254271	And he's making bitter beer face.
8254391	8255052	It's different.
8257935	8261179	It's different, and it's well-produced.
8261239	8266085	Well-produced maybe, but of course they can speak to each other.
8266105	8266386	I don't know.
8267765	8269266	BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY
8296005	8299168	I'm trying to think of some really cool ones that are out there.
8299188	8301810	They sort of had an R&B version of Rainbow Flyer.
8307694	8321204	Rainbow Flyer, the polychromatic algorithmic... Let's see here, we've also got... But the winner, the winner of it all was Saxon Pike with V1.
8327034	8342388	No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
8343249	8349655	Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same contest you were complaining about because they wouldn't allow fusion mixes and what won the damn contest?
8351880	8354442	Now, this was a little different now.
8354682	8358804	They didn't want people just using acid to throw two songs on top of each other.
8360005	8364468	However, there were some songs in there that were two songs thrown on top of each other.
8365148	8371372	How that got in is beyond me, because I specifically remembered in the rules that that's why I didn't enter.
8372052	8372573	But whatever.
8373213	8373673	I don't care.
8373693	8375054	The contest is over.
8375514	8376075	It's a little late.
8376615	8378136	But anyway, so yeah, that was that.
8378696	8379957	You can find all these songs online.
8380638	8389005	Under the music production forum on MyStyle, there's a whole list of songs you can listen to, good and bad, and they're all on there, pretty cool.
8389285	8396471	One of the other songs that came out this week also was a remix of Vanity Angel by DM Asura, because he can do no wrong, it seems like, with these.
8396811	8399914	So anyways, I thought I'd play a little bit of that, because that's pretty sweet also.
8409835	8415237	But, yeah, it's just, you know, cool, like, long, trance, universal, and trance songs, so.
8416577	8418698	But anyways, that was out.
8418718	8420919	You can also find that in the Music Production Forum.
8422159	8433103	Or you could listen to Monday Nights, Diversion, the Orange Sons Radio Remix Show, because we'll definitely be adding some of these songs into our rotation there on Monday nights from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
8434406	8445229	Now, and the other thing I wanted to mention, and we mentioned this way back in the show a while ago, about, what was it, it was DJ Potato's Bomani Rock album that was going to be coming out.
8445709	8448349	I have a few full tracks, actually, from that.
8449330	8455731	So, there's a few I'd like to just preview real quick, and we'll also be throwing those in to rotation as well.
8455751	8456011	Max 300.
8456411	8456691	Max 300.
8475157	8480019	All right, all right, all right.
8480919	8484401	It's well done, don't get me wrong, but no more Macs.
8484841	8485421	I mean it.
8485681	8486462	No more.
8486482	8489783	Samsung keeps breeding.
8489823	8490743	It's worse than Tribbles.
8492344	8493524	This one's the one I like, Peer Drain.
8493564	8495325	I can't go on.
8504113	8514737	This one is a little harder to find.
8516098	8517819	I believe this was in the 2DX forum.
8517839	8520760	There's like a sample thing from the Bomani Rock album.
8521260	8522700	You can find that also on Bomani Style.
8525100	8527223	That's pretty much all that's like music news.
8527263	8536034	Now, there's a little other thing I read because we're talking about, you know, new arcade mixes and the Step Mania machine and in the groove and all that kind of stuff that kind of coincides with this.
8536875	8537596	Now, for those who...
8538706	8548813	Frequent the DDRUK.com site, you'll know that they created a Setmania machine called DDX, or Dance Dance X, or whatever it is.
8549834	8554077	It's basically a Setmania arcade game that they skinned.
8554117	8560161	It looks really nice, and it was being played in a Namco, I think it was like a Namco cyberstation somewhere in England.
8560781	8561362	And anyways...
8562836	8565237	That's getting pulled out of there.
8565357	8572701	Not because of licensing issues and stuff, but it fell the same fate that the Golf Land Machine was.
8572921	8580685	And that is, it's not being fixed by them, and it's just falling apart and damaged.
8583727	8591370	Everyone out there know that problems with little kids trashing shit, it's worldwide.
8591410	8592611	There are bad parents everywhere.
8594352	8596294	Oh, and you told me that it happened during break.
8596354	8602462	I was hoping it was going to be a legal issues story so we could have a little fun with that, but you're just saying some fucking punks ruined the machine.
8602722	8603102	That's it.
8604023	8604604	That is it.
8604724	8605085	Sorry.
8605505	8606486	How boring!
8606787	8608449	I wanted somebody to get sued.
8608709	8609870	That would have been exciting.
8611392	8612534	So no plans to bring it back?
8612974	8614135	They're just going to let it rot?
8615390	8617911	Maybe we will get a lawsuit story out of this after all.
8617931	8618111	Hooray!
8636505	8642187	Anyways, the other thing I wanted to talk about was there was a bootleg that came out a few weeks ago, Dance Dance King.
8642307	8654853	It looked like a really crappy bootleg machine from China that featured gold colored pads and stuff and had, what else?
8654993	8663456	Oh, and it's basically a second mix consumer style machine that was running from a PlayStation machine.
8664068	8666630	Literally, a PS1 was inside this cabinet.
8667591	8668912	And that was quite interesting.
8669313	8671014	I happened to contact these people.
8671114	8682964	They want to... Now, it wasn't their idea, they say, to bring this bootleg over here, but the guy wants to make a legitimate mix.
8683625	8685366	That was kind of interesting, I thought.
8687288	8688589	Good luck!
8691291	8696638	So yeah, that's all the miscellaneous Bomani stuff that's been going on this week.
8697259	8701764	Next week, I have no idea what's going to be going on because I'm going to be playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
8704007	8707992	So unless there's Bomani in San Andreas, I have no idea what's going on.
8708905	8713768	Fair enough, because we're not having a show next Sunday, remember, it's Halloween, and we're giving all the people a night off so you can go trick-or-treating.
8713808	8720633	We will have a marathon of old Orange Lounge Radio episodes, though, a very scary Orange Lounge Radio marathon for you guys next Sunday.
8720653	8721974	I don't know how long that's going to run.
8722314	8724976	Stay tuned to the website for details and when your shows will air.
8726156	8729398	You know, Nelly almost got me to buy Karaoke Revolution 2.
8729539	8732080	Then my wits came about me, I said, fuck no!
8732621	8733841	I am not buying that game.
8737404	8737804	Fair enough.
8738371	8739311	Actually, I want to ask you about this.
8739411	8740872	Rai Chan sent me a private message.
8741332	8744373	She linked me to this thread over on Freak that's showing this.
8744413	8751775	I don't know if you've seen this, but it is a Stepmania computer put inside an 80s era ghetto blaster.
8752315	8755936	And they've got the Stepmania logo painted over the speakers.
8756276	8757497	And this is actually a computer.
8757537	8759397	It looks like a boombox in the front, but look at the side.
8759417	8760037	Look at that.
8760057	8760718	It's a little computer.
8760778	8761518	You see this, Jamie?
8761538	8762398	Look at that.
8763018	8763378	Old school.
8763398	8765059	That makes me think of the Nintendo computer.
8766172	8768694	You remember when they were building a Nintendo out of laptop parts?
8769174	8772136	I'm sorry, building a computer out of a Nintendo shell and laptop parts.
8772757	8774778	Yeah, it's the nice case mod.
8775899	8778461	I thought about doing one like that, but putting it in a Dreamcast.
8778541	8782123	I still want one built out of a toolkit, a toolbox.
8784285	8785726	Is that kind of thing hard to do, Loki?
8785766	8789629	Now, when it comes to technical stuff, I don't know shit.
8789889	8792611	I know how to put a radio station on the internet, but that's about it.
8793011	8795773	So, Loki, tell me about, is this hard to do?
8796758	8797858	Not if you have a Dremel tool.
8797999	8804561	It's pretty much, even since that boombox was so big, that they probably wouldn't even need to get a micro ITX board.
8805001	8809083	The micro ITX ones that they have now are really small.
8809163	8817227	I think the specifications for that are 15, I think it's 17 centimeters by 17 centimeters.
8817607	8822909	And looking at that, it looks like that is a micro ITX board in there.
8823376	8828318	Yeah, so it's a micro-ITX board, looks like a hard drive, power supply and everything.
8829479	8835661	It looks like they had a P4 version that was in there.
8835881	8837302	I don't really know if that's the thing.
8837822	8841544	They might have just added a fan to that just so it's cooled off a little bit more.
8842024	8842364	I don't know.
8842504	8843645	It's hard to tell by the picture.
8844125	8848967	It looks like it could be a regular-sized motherboard, but I'm thinking it's probably a micro-ITX.
8850114	8851735	I like how they have the hard drive on top.
8851855	8852576	That's very interesting.
8852596	8854437	The hard drive's like separate from everything else.
8854517	8855197	It's kind of interesting.
8855277	8857579	I don't know if that's just the way they open it up or what.
8857979	8859100	But look at this.
8859140	8864683	It says it also includes a sound-sensitive blue LED rod that kind of goes with the beat.
8867665	8871468	But those little things go a long way in ghetto fabulousness, don't they?
8871568	8872148	Don't you think?
8873969	8874630	It's awesome.
8875330	8876231	I still wanted to do...
8876584	8891052	I wanted to make like a mini portable console system for like, you know, Stepmania emulation games and just like a, not really, like almost like a laptop but not, I don't know, I'm never going to do that though because I start too many projects.
8892739	8894240	Alright, well we're going to go to a break.
8894260	8897421	When we come back from this break, we've got to do the FUs of the week, don't you know?
8897622	8900763	Oh, but shouldn't I announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match before we get to that?
8901023	8904665	Because that was about an hour ago that we had the Cage Match.
8904725	8912289	Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match is Ian Van Dahl with Reason.
8913470	8914390	So there you have it.
8914770	8917071	Just because Loki picks a funny one doesn't mean he wins it.
8918292	8919993	So, too bad!
8921710	8921990	I'm glad.
8922030	8924912	I haven't won that in at least a while.
8924992	8926113	So, at least a month.
8926333	8927153	I know that much.
8928614	8929875	So, cool.
8929975	8934218	Well, you'll be hearing that one again next week along with two other lovely new songs.
8935439	8936279	Oh, no, not next week.
8936319	8938360	Oh, yeah, by default it's going to win for two weeks now.
8938440	8942243	So, we'll be back in two weeks to try and dethrone Ian Vandal.
8943447	8944387	Ryu, I'm white, forgive me, we'll be back

9312834	9314195	Thank you for watching!
9335034	9343576	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
9343616	9349917	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
9350877	9357058	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and believe it or not, we're coming into the home stretch of the show.
9357799	9359879	But no show would be complete...
9361437	9363058	Without a little bit of angst.
9364258	9366459	And that means it's time for the FUs of the week.
9367139	9370020	Jamie, why do we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?
9370600	9373161	Because we're full of angst.
9379824	9381084	Oh, this is bad.
9381744	9383465	Here is justice.
9383505	9385886	Here is punishment.
9385946	9388487	Here is... This is fucked up!
9389407	9391088	First thing I do goes to my laundry...
9391636	9395397	for not being dry yet, it's still damp.
9396518	9402020	Another FU goes toward being exhausted, drained, worn out, you name it.
9403380	9406781	FU to stress, big FU to stress.
9407522	9413444	FU to people in minivans who drive 30 in a 50 mile an hour zone.
9418650	9422950	and Distance, Time, Money.
9424591	9426431	I don't really have anything specific.
9431352	9433553	Alright, then we'll move on to Loki.
9440574	9445275	First off, you know, it's like every week, you know, fuck you the drivers, because
9446673	9448774	God, they're so awful and wholesome.
9448854	9449915	I just don't know what it is.
9449955	9455699	They just don't pay attention to any of the stop signs, lights, road signs, nothing.
9455739	9457680	They're just stupid.
9458600	9459741	So, fuck you, Zeb.
9459761	9465545	Fuck you to my car, because the engine light came on the other day, and I don't know why.
9465565	9474830	Well, actually, I do know why, because it was out of coolant, but I fixed that, and I hope it doesn't break down, because, you know, I need good karma around my car.
9475050	9476071	I don't want to have to, like...
9477169	9478069	Have it great.
9478089	9479370	That would suck.
9480891	9489634	Then on more personal notes, and I apologize to any people that are listening from my work, because I think there might be one or two.
9489934	9490535	Maybe one.
9490915	9498138	Anyways, fuck you to BPD for firing Nelly from the mailroom.
9498198	9504100	It's really funny because I do know the reasons behind it, and it was really stupid why they did it.
9504360	9506421	There's a lot of people there that have done a lot worse
9507245	9519297	and are still there, and it's just retarded, so, but whatever, she's probably going to end up getting something better in the long run, so that's cool, but there's just a lot of people I have lost respect for from that, and that sucks.
9520438	9532049	Then finally, just, I'm sorry, fuck you to the rain, because it's wet outside and I can't work on my cabinet, not that I would work on my cabinet anyways if it wasn't raining.
9534546	9539191	I'm just tired, that's it.
9541433	9547579	Alright, I'm going back to my old FU song, because the new one, William Hung, just wasn't working out, so I'm going back to my old song.
9547599	9556027	Weren't we just talking about how we didn't really care for this song, Jamie?
9557088	9557368	And yet...
9557862	9558942	Why don't you pick another one?
9559163	9560903	Nah, I'm feeling uncreative tonight.
9561143	9564064	Because I just like the fact that it goes, all things keep getting better.
9564865	9566225	And, you know, it's the FUs of the week.
9566285	9566906	I don't wanna.
9566966	9567966	I don't wanna.
9568006	9568766	No, maybe later.
9579001	9588665	I'm never that angsty though, and honestly, to be honest, this week is much different.
9589385	9599950	I'm just, I'm going to say F you to the fact that I've been really insanely busy this week, and I haven't had time to do all the things that I want to do, and F you to the fact that I haven't been able to hang out with certain people as much as I would like to be able to.
9600486	9605190	Just because of the fact that, you know, they're working, and I'm working, and I got the radio stuff, etc., etc., so...
9607076	9607757	That kind of sucks.
9607777	9609338	There needs to be more hours in the day.
9609458	9613021	And then people shouldn't have to work as much and then keep the same salary.
9613422	9618186	I realize I'm living in La La Land, but I really don't have anything realistic this week.
9618426	9619867	It's actually been a pretty decent week.
9619887	9620768	Just really busy.
9621729	9627894	Except F you to the people that went and saw The Grudge at 9.30 on Friday night in Roseville because you all were too damn loud.
9628915	9631437	And F you to that guy I had to yell at in the middle of the movie.
9631577	9633199	Although that did make me feel really good.
9634059	9639543	I mean, just getting the applause like that when I told that guy to shut the hell up felt really, really good.
9639583	9641984	There's just not a lot of rushes like that you get in the world, so.
9643905	9647788	Just, you know, F you to that movie as well for making people scream and stuff.
9649966	9652027	People were too damn loud with that movie and it was giving me a headache.
9652147	9664674	Oh, F you to the fact, I know why, F you to the fact that the projectionist or something, the film was damaged or the projection was going on because for 20 goddamn minutes the movie was bouncing up and down like it was shaking.
9665014	9668796	Like imagine if you were trying to watch something on a projection screen and it was shaking like an earthquake.
9669076	9672678	I swear to God it was giving me a headache after like one minute of having to watch it like that.
9672998	9676520	And we go and complain, Loki actually went in and complained and what did they tell you?
9677527	9680350	Uh, yeah, it's only going to do that for 20 minutes.
9680751	9687698	We got the defective reel from the studio, but hey, we're getting a new one to replace it soon.
9688318	9688659	Sorry.
9689179	9689539	Uh-uh.
9689939	9690239	No.
9690299	9701782	Fuck you and your fucking bitch-ass whore cunt for fucking making me pay $9.25 plus a $1.25 Fandango fee because I don't like fucking lines at your movie theater.
9702322	9703782	Fuck you for making me pay that.
9704142	9707123	I want a perfect goddamn theater experience.
9707183	9707803	You know what?
9707943	9709223	You should have asked for the manager.
9709403	9709883	I know.
9710024	9711644	I should write a letter and complain.
9711824	9712124	Do it.
9712664	9713645	I just might.
9714446	9718330	You should ask for the manager's boss then.
9721613	9722153	Who knew?
9722354	9726297	I had this rage pent up in me and I forgot all about it.
9726337	9729060	I pushed it to the back of my mind and you people brought it out of me.
9729801	9730501	Rage!
9730641	9736547	I got a free ticket for complaining about them turning on the lights at the end of the credits for Matrix.
9738068	9739229	I'll write a nasty letter.
9739829	9740990	Because you know what?
9741330	9744332	I think I had one other bad experience at theater and I can't remember what it was.
9744613	9747535	But I bet if I went through the FU archives of the show I could find it.
9747595	9749316	Mention the three magic words.
9750017	9752518	Better business bureau.
9752618	9754520	I mentioned these magic words.
9755080	9760823	Fuck you, whore, for making me pay so much money for going to see a subpar production.
9760924	9762825	I want everything in pristine condition.
9764065	9765146	It's highway robbery.
9765226	9767147	No wonder people pirate your goddamn movies.
9768468	9769669	Here's my thing, okay?
9769689	9772550	It was playing on like six to eight screens in there.
9772951	9775672	Take out the bad film, play it less.
9776293	9778174	Oh my God, five screens.
9778374	9779835	How will we survive?
9780335	9782636	I mean, seriously, just play it less.
9782656	9783437	Play another...
9784386	9787908	I'm sure more people want to see a shark's tail, so go ahead and play that instead.
9788368	9794111	I mean, they could have easily taken this out of rotation, but instead they're like, ah, fuck it, no one's going to care.
9799034	9799514	All right.
9801275	9805077	Let's move on and go to the other angsty folks in our studio right now.
9805117	9807278	We'll start it off with DDR Angel.
9808739	9809940	I actually have to burp right now.
9809960	9810360	That's okay.
9812862	9817644	Um, just, FU to just being tired today, I don't even know what's up, everybody seems tired today.
9819445	9822786	Um, I don't know, just, there's no reason for it, I shouldn't be tired, but I am.
9823486	9824166	FU to that.
9824747	9836991	Um, again, FU to the flaky instructor that I've got, because that sucks, but, whatever, he's still deciding to hold class every once in a while, maybe he'll get over it and realize, oh wait, uh, I have a job to do.
9838572	9841773	Um, that's about it, I'm like, not 80, what the hell.
9843456	9845119	You're not really ever that angsty, Angel.
9845159	9846901	I've only seen you angsty here one time.
9847242	9849245	And it took an act of God to make you angsty.
9851228	9851548	Alright.
9852069	9854473	Bradley, Arcadian42, what's on your mind?
9855489	9859270	Of course, fuck you to, uh, Folsom PD, and... Surprise!
9859430	9872933	Yes, uh, Fakira, and all that, and all, fuck you to me for getting myself into that, and that situation, and all the decisions, and delays, and everything that caused it, and, yeah, so forth.
9874653	9882535	Uh, what else, uh, fuck you to having to make up all that time, but at least my work is nice and will let me make up time.
9882555	9884615	Let me in, let me in
9885051	9893074	Fuck you to the honey-backed ribs or whatever the new thing at Applebee's for sucking.
9894134	9894694	Woo!
9895694	9896075	No, honey.
9896275	9900036	It's like honey... honey barbecue ribs.
9900916	9903477	Oh, it's actually a rib thing, but it sucked.
9903957	9908158	Riblets are good, but it's like a new rib thing, but it sucked.
9909239	9910039	It was like, bleh.
9912250	9917416	Yeah, but at least it was free, because it was the free lunch day at work.
9919198	9921721	So at least I didn't have to pay that money for it.
9923463	9925705	And, uh, yeah.
9928268	9930471	Actually, just ROD for the DVD, but...
9931593	9943560	Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, of which I haven't gotten very many tonight, surprisingly enough, so if they don't get in in the next 30 seconds or so, they're probably not getting read, but that's alright, we have a few.
9945737	9951562	Raichan says, F you to friends borrowing things and not returning them.
9952222	9956305	F you to people that drive in the fast lane and are going 15 miles an hour under the speed limit.
9957046	9957747	F you to loners.
9958067	9962791	F you to people that continue to try to use you for all your worth and can't take a hint when I say no.
9963731	9966494	Oh, and F you to taking a frisbee to the lip.
9967214	9968835	Ow, ow.
9971217	9971798	What, Loki?
9972098	9974360	Said you're not a dog, you can't catch it with your mouth.
9976336	9977937	Something tells me she wasn't trying to do that.
9978538	9979158	You know what, though?
9979178	9979999	You know what's a lot safer?
9980059	9980779	What were those things?
9980799	9982300	They're like frisbees, but they go further.
9982520	9982981	Robies?
9983061	9984041	What were those things called?
9984462	9986843	Yeah, it's like throwing a giant saw blade at your head.
9987103	9988765	That's the best thing ever.
9988785	9990085	No, the Nerf ones, the plastic ones.
9990105	9995289	Yeah, the Nerf ones are the best ones because it just feels like you're throwing a fish at you or something like that.
9995789	10000072	But yeah, the Robies are fucking dangerous because they go faster and they're more streamlined.
10000092	10003094	Seriously, it's like a saw blade getting thrown at you.
10004844	10006265	But they're awesome, you can throw them in the car.
10007606	10008087	Alright.
10008967	10012110	Didn't they have aerobies that were shaped in, like, strange shapes, too?
10012170	10013831	Like, diamonds and stuff?
10014071	10015713	Right, right.
10017334	10020617	DarkTetsuya says, F you to my cold, and F you to my computer.
10020777	10022478	I only heard half of tonight's show.
10023039	10023779	Unacceptable!
10025421	10025841	Fired!
10025861	10027162	No, that's fine, that's fine.
10029164	10030585	He does good news for the website, so...
10033990	10043793	Jazz says, F you to the fact that the projection people didn't turn off the lights for like 15 minutes into the movie and the fact that the grudge was more funny than scary and the rest of my audience agreed.
10044534	10046014	I thought the grudge was scary.
10046975	10050896	I thought the grudge was really scary.
10051956	10052677	But that's it.
10052777	10054077	He reminded me of the other thing.
10054778	10061160	When I went and saw, I think it was, I want to say it was Kill Bill 2 over there, they didn't turn off the goddamn lights.
10062062	10062683	That's what it was.
10062703	10063343	It was Kill Bill 2.
10063383	10067106	Yeah, when I went and saw Kill Bill 2, they didn't turn off the goddamn lights for like 15 minutes.
10067406	10071650	And you would think such a little thing would not be so annoying, but it was really, really annoying.
10072190	10075212	Thank you, Jazz, for reigniting that angst within me.
10078035	10083119	Lastly, Poto says, F you to writing a paper on two hours of sleep.
10086161	10086341	Aww.
10087002	10089144	I remember being such a procrastinator like that.
10089184	10089564	Still am.
10090214	10093495	I'm doing my paper during my lunch break tomorrow, and it's due tomorrow night.
10093755	10094456	Amen to that.
10096296	10096576	Alright.
10096876	10098297	I'm not going to class tomorrow.
10099237	10099637	Oh, wait.
10100878	10101958	I'm not going to class ever.
10103319	10103599	Yep.
10104539	10104839	Alright.
10105419	10112102	I guess what we should do, let's open up the Skype line, because for God's sake, we haven't had it open the whole show except for that long chat we had with Frequency.
10112142	10115603	Basically, Frequency took all your Skype time tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
10116323	10116843	No, I'm kidding.
10117124	10120926	We'll open it up a little bit for the folks to talk to us on Skype.
10120946	10121687	So Skype's open.
10121967	10127430	If you want more information on Skype, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
10127811	10143941	We definitely would like your feedback to anything we've talked about during tonight's show, including lots of stuff that we had talked to Frequency about earlier, as well as, you know, other news, the Bomani Remix Contest, and machines breaking down, and kids in arcades, and projectionists that don't know how to tromp the goddamn light when the movie starts.
10144002	10144422	Anyway, sorry.
10144882	10146063	Getting a little bit off tangent there.
10147620	10153583	Also, we will accept your Ask Orange Lounge questions over private message and chat if you guys have anything you want to ask us.
10154183	10159046	We only have a couple minutes left, so we're not going to make it an official segment, but if you have some questions you'd like us to address, go ahead and send those in.
10159886	10163388	I'd also like to add that everything Sam Raimi touches turns to gold.
10165729	10167330	And his car ends up in all of his movies.
10167890	10173352	Damn it, I didn't look for it in the garage, but I don't know if that really counts because he just produced the movie.
10173572	10174453	His car might be in there.
10176294	10182296	I'm being told right now in our chat room that right now our very show is being played inside a truck stop.
10183436	10183977	Awesome!
10185977	10189618	So we'd like to give a big yee-haw to all our trucking buddies down there.
10189638	10190079	No, I'm kidding.
10190099	10190959	I'm totally kidding.
10191539	10192459	Please don't beat me up.
10193860	10198161	No, but I guess we have somebody listening on a network over at the truck stop right now.
10198181	10198881	I think that's pretty awesome.
10198901	10199822	I want a good truck stop.
10199862	10200682	They have good food.
10200762	10201382	I want hashbrown.
10201402	10202743	They have good food over at the truck stop.
10202763	10203403	Oh my god, let's go get food.
10204127	10204807	I want riblets.
10205067	10205908	I want riblets.
10206128	10206988	I don't think they have riblets.
10207349	10212031	But I need to be watching my weight because I have a performance to do on Saturday.
10212051	10212591	Oh, come on.
10212811	10213872	Eat healthy food.
10213892	10214792	Get some spinach with it.
10214832	10215612	I've got to work early tomorrow.
10215632	10217313	If I didn't have to work early tomorrow, I would totally do it.
10217813	10218854	I have to work at 6.30.
10221855	10222196	Sorry.
10222836	10226418	Anyway, we're supposed to watch the language because we're being broadcast at the truck stop right now.
10226518	10227918	So, you know.
10230862	10234384	Alright, I'll keep the mic away from Loki, if that's the case.
10238026	10240267	Oh, I didn't even check the Skype thing to see if anybody called.
10240347	10242068	Nope, still wide open there.
10242128	10243849	Well, I guess nobody wants to call us tonight, that's fine.
10244329	10247231	That's fine, we'll just talk to ourselves, we'll amuse ourselves here, that's fine.
10247511	10249032	Any big Halloween plans for you, Loki?
10250555	10251877	Just having a get-together over here.
10251917	10255983	We're going to watch Shaun of the Dead because I got my lovely promo copy of that.
10256964	10258046	And that's going to rock.
10258366	10258907	Shaun of the Dead.
10258927	10259949	I'm going to try.
10259969	10263374	I'm going to try because the people are going to have alcohol.
10263394	10267119	I'm going to try to slip in one of my bad movies in there, but I don't think they're going to go for it.
10267890	10270673	No one wants to watch my bad movies, and that makes me sad.
10271294	10281885	I spend good money on those, and goddammit, if, you know, no one wants to watch, uh, what is it, uh, Blood Sisters of Lesbian Sin, you know, who will?
10282325	10282866	I'll watch it.
10283146	10283486	I'll watch it.
10283506	10284107	Come on, make a plan for it.
10284127	10285328	Just to see what the hell it is.
10285708	10286369	I have a question.
10286429	10287931	How many people are coming to this get-together?
10291427	10292868	I don't know.
10293408	10294628	Where are they all going to fit?
10296348	10297889	I don't know.
10299089	10299829	Interesting.
10300389	10303530	Sit on the floor, goddammit, because I'm taking... Language!
10306051	10306951	Gosh darn it!
10307711	10308891	Much better, much better.
10309271	10309591	All right.
10310451	10312152	Bradley, you have any exciting Halloween plans?
10312752	10313032	Nope.
10315473	10316553	Sit on my ass at home.
10316753	10317133	Do nothing.
10317526	10318206	Sounds like a plan of me.
10318226	10319227	You know what I'm doing.
10319247	10320167	I want to see the Arizuka kids.
10321188	10322308	That's a fabulous idea.
10322348	10323469	Let's take out the Arizuka.
10324189	10326290	We can put candy in it and it launches the candy.
10327731	10331012	I've got like three days of Halloween because we're doing the big thing at work.
10331592	10332973	I have my cat girl costume.
10334434	10338095	And then I'm having Rocky on Saturday.
10339156	10344038	And probably Sunday I'm just going to sit around and watch Interview with a Vampire on Laserdisc.
10344505	10345726	There you go.
10367859	10370721	Also, what else I wanted to say?
10370741	10372041	Oh, remember the follow-up from last week?
10372061	10382066	Remember we were talking about, in case you guys weren't listening last week, but we were talking about how we were going to do DDR on the big screen at some point.
10382106	10388810	We were going to take that same movie screen and possibly have a Bomani night in the movie theater and possibly do a live taping of Orange Lounge Radio.
10389270	10390691	Outlook is very good on that.
10391031	10395633	We're hoping to get some help from other friends of ours within the Bomani community to kind of make that a success.
10396073	10397154	But just like the
10397774	10399835	TV show thing that had come up earlier.
10399875	10404456	We're having a hard time figuring out exactly what we're going to do besides a live episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10404476	10405597	But we want there to be more to it.
10406957	10407237	What?
10407257	10410278	I said let's set a virgin on fire.
10411319	10412739	Get set a virgin's pants on fire.
10415400	10415800	Oh boy.
10416320	10417521	Let's set the ferret on fire.
10417541	10418341	That's what we need to do.
10419542	10420082	My baby's.
10420422	10421202	Where's my baby?
10421282	10421682	I don't know.
10421702	10422623	He's funny enough.
10422663	10423723	I don't even know where the ferrets are.
10423743	10424983	Do you want to see my baby?
10425003	10425764	No, I don't want to see your baby.
10425784	10426504	You have to get out and get it.
10428490	10429310	No, don't do it.
10429330	10430391	Don't be your slave.
10430511	10431691	Don't be your slave.
10433231	10433671	Let my people go.
10433691	10436772	You've got to play Katamari Damacy on the big screen.
10437332	10443274	Okay, that's one suggestion that's come up, is that Katamari Damacy gets played on the big screen.
10444034	10444374	Okay.
10444654	10447075	Somehow, we'll have to have some kind of little contest.
10447275	10448195	Oh, they have two-player mode.
10448215	10450236	We can have a Katamari Damacy tournament or something.
10450356	10451736	You can play as the cousins.
10452296	10452756	There you go.
10453317	10454437	I'm liking this so far.
10454517	10454997	I'm liking it.
10457723	10470447	Alright, we're going to take a real quick break.
10470467	10473708	We're going to do a one song break, then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.
10475089	10476869	What song should we do here in this break?
10476909	10482391	Let's do... Well, we did pop in, we didn't do a guitar freak song.
10482771	10482951	What?
10484864	10485024	Language!
10485064	10485284	Language!
10485545	10485825	Language!
10485845	10486025	Language!
10513959	10526012	So, golly gee willikers, it would not, you know, upload to the, to the, um, server, and, um, so yeah, I couldn't make it available for people to download, that made me sad.
10526713	10530737	Um, and you said it sucks, okay, that's what I want to say.
10531318	10535042	But anyways, this is, um, Paranoia Revolution, um,
10535444	10565136	be sure you put in the one that's just Revolutions and MP3 because I changed it a few times because I just did not like the middle of it so I had to tweak it a little bit more but CDTemp Loki okay anyways so yeah here it is and it's glory and stuff and it'll be available for download soon I'm sure just have to get it to upload
10568264	10569646	All righty, here we go.
10570627	10571667	Paranoia Revolution.
10572388	10575171	Enjoy, and we'll be back to wrap up the show after this.
10603545	10604186	DarkSakura.com
10754838	10758959	It's Paranoia Revolution here on Orange Lounge Radio, remixed by our very own Loki.
10759499	10760240	You know what I realized?
10760280	10762780	The bass line in that kind of reminds me of Suguru.
10765861	10766821	Like it has the same rhythm.
10767241	10768082	Listen to it towards the end.
10768982	10773623	Actually, it has the part, you know in Paranoia where it's all... Has that throughout the whole thing.
10777385	10783933	Um, yeah, so it's like a, what is it, uh, 12th notes and then, um, like some 4th.
10784113	10785394	Oh, it's pretty cool.
10785434	10787837	It's just, it's a little bit, um, tweaked off of that.
10787877	10791201	That's in the background, I know, for most of it, obviously, because I made it.
10791722	10793003	But, um, I don't know.
10793444	10796347	That's all that's done on the second thing right now.
10797338	10799180	DDR Angel, what is your final thought?
10827168	10829249	Katamari Damacy, because I can't stop playing.
10834950	10837991	Final thought from Bradley.
10838131	10838851	You go last, right?
10839231	10840011	Arcadian42?
10845953	10846493	Thoughts?
10849934	10850594	I have none at the moment.
10851824	10854725	DarkSakura, your final thought?
10875600	10882144	I have games to play, like I have Katamari Damacy now, I have Sims 2, and you know what?
10883404	10885185	Real life is taking up all my time.
10886246	10896151	So I've had to focus on school, everything, so there is a world outside of video games, not much one, and it usually sucks, but there is one.
10898103	10917047	Alright, and my final thought is, don't forget to listen to our other shows on Monday night, Diversion, Orange Zones Radio Remix Show, Tuesday night, Pump Up the Volume with DarkSakura, 7 o'clock Pacific Time, and, oh, I'm sorry, 7 o'clock for pre-show, 7.30 for show, and Wednesday nights on Orange Zones Radio, Outside the Box, with a special Grand Theft Auto San Andreas update!
10917625	10920206	Yes, very special Grand Theft Auto San Andreas update.
10920747	10925710	That's the show on this station where we talk about the other games, other than the stomp your feet and tap your fingers games.
10925850	10931933	So, we'll get to all that on Wednesday, and Tuesday, Jamie, I'm sure, will have another fun show, and Monday, remixes.
10932333	10933994	Thursday, Orange Sounds Radio Rewind.
10934915	10937736	Another night of programming is coming to Orange Sounds Radio soon, that's all I have to say.
10938637	10941539	Also, the Long Versions program is going to launch...
10942523	10946984	Hopefully, sometime this week, but like next week at the latest.
10947184	10951085	So, we're going to have a long version program that's going to be at lunchtime for an hour.
10952706	10954846	Rob, real quick question here in the studio.
10955186	10959767	What about the, um, CK or something?
10959787	10960548	Eh, okay, never mind.
10961388	10962388	Nothing to see here, move along.
10962528	10970110	Oh, and, should mention, when you're, um, you know, not listening to Orange Knowledge Radio, New South Park coming to Comedy Central.
10971653	10972554	Hooray, hooray.
10972714	10976056	Okay, the last word of this show, I'll give it to Loki.
10976157	10977478	Loki, the last word of tonight's show.
10977598	10979499	One word that sums it all up for our listeners.
10979519	10981621	I can't do it in one word.
10981641	10982141	Fuck yeah!
10983382	10988246	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
10989067	10993230	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.
10993911	11006037	For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
11030865	11034371	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11067432	11074239	Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, the part after the credits have faded to black, etc., etc.
11075460	11080245	I thought that was a gospel song at first, and then I realized what it was.
11080305	11082367	I didn't realize they sung the theme around us like that.
11082387	11084589	I thought they actually had a little synthesized thing.
11085630	11091376	No, because the show fucking rocked, and then they took it off air like they do everything that's good on Nickelodeon.
11091789	11120440	they need to have Nick Retro with, you know, the old, um, shows like Salute Your Shorts, you know, um, fuckin', uh, Hey Dude, and all that stuff, you know, they need to put that back on there, cause they've got, like, you know, this stupid, uh, Noggin crap with, like, you know, Daria's cool and stuff, but Degrassi, oh my god, it's like, what the hell, I don't even know what's up with that show, that show's got some weird shit on there, it's like, uh,
11120967	11125931	Fucking Melrose Place meets High School.
11127813	11131676	Jamie's yelling from the back, remember Seventeen, that show on Nickelodeon?
11132256	11132516	Ha!
11133837	11134718	Ha ha ha!
11135839	11136720	Show was fabulous.
11138641	11142624	For some reason it makes me think... God, yes, you can't do that on television.
11142725	11145006	Why can't we have reruns if you can't do that on television?
11145026	11145827	Turkey TV!
11147188	11147969	Turkey TV.
11148289	11150351	Pinwheel, today's special...
11151969	11176046	And we all Oh well You know, we'll just never get that stuff back He'll just die He'll come back when Exactly Thank God for the internet Because I'm hoping more and more old school You can't do that on television episodes Start showing up Because I found a couple online once Or somebody gave me some I don't remember what it was Did you give me some?
11176146	11180929	Angel gave me some Oh, so great I need to get more That show was so freaking fabulous
11183257	11184558	Dude, the dungeon scenes.
11184818	11186099	Oh, you can't do that on television.
11186139	11186859	That's all I gotta say.
11187019	11187620	Or the arcades.
11190481	11191622	It's all about barf.
11192462	11193583	That guy rocks.
11194724	11195104	Poor guy.
11195124	11196165	I think, isn't he dead?
11196185	11197225	Probably.
11197505	11198106	Poor guy.
11198406	11199146	He was awesome.
11199186	11200307	So underappreciated.
11201994	11204795	And PeeWee, you know, fucking PeeWee's play out seems to come back.
11204895	11207015	I don't care if he's a fucking pervert and child molester.
11207395	11207915	You know what?
11208475	11211256	This is a conversation I was having with my friend the other day.
11211276	11212656	We're talking about Michael Jackson, okay?
11212936	11214237	Yeah, the guy's really fucked up.
11214277	11216017	Yeah, okay, maybe he slept with some children.
11216057	11218377	Yeah, that does not make his music bad.
11219258	11224659	Just because someone's a child molester does not mean that they cannot make good music.
11225079	11226219	Just like PeeWee Herman.
11226519	11229320	Okay, so he's into child pornography and all this stuff.
11229420	11230980	Does not mean the show was bad.
11232051	11234073	Some comments from the chatroom Danger Mouse and Count Ducula
11261653	11263055	Duckman needs to come back.
11263475	11264636	Yeah, Duckman, definitely.
11265818	11266118	Alright.
11266959	11269141	Yeah, enough memory lane stuff.
11269522	11273186	Coming to DVDs soon, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Full House.
11274006	11277751	For all you sick pedophiles out there like the Olsen twins.
11279492	11280974	When do I get my Golden Girls DVDs?
11280994	11281575	When are those out?
11282676	11283557	They're already out.
11283837	11284077	What?
11284598	11284838	What?
11285478	11286259	I need Wonder Woman.
11286299	11286779	Bitch, what?
11286899	11287160	What?
11287360	11289962	My Golden Girls DVDs are already out and I don't have them?
11290182	11290462	What?
11290922	11293524	I think they come out Tuesday or I think they're already out.
11293544	11294545	They were coming out in October.
11296506	11297607	Stop the presses!
11300229	11301991	Oh my god, I must get this.
11307194	11310417	Sorry, but you know, Golden Girls was like the best TV show ever.
11313148	11313889	I'm so excited.
11314989	11316771	Says it ships November 23rd.
