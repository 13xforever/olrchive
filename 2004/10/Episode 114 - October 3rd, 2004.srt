00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:54,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

12

17
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:40,794
[SPEAKER_18]: You're tuned in to the internet's most diverse radio station of all things B-Money.

[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:48,380

[SPEAKER_18]: Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, DarkSakura.

21
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:52,843
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

22
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:29,555
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a brand new webcam angle, just for tonight, because it's only the three of us, so there's no guests to focus on, so... Extreme webcam action.

23
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:38,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you get to see Loki and me this time on the webcam, the whole show, and our really dirty work area, which I'm almost embarrassed to have on the cam, but I don't care.

24
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,803
[SPEAKER_18]: Let the world know, I don't care.

25
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:43,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't put my feet on the webcam anymore.

26
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:47,967
[SPEAKER_18]: You could still get your... Oh, we do have a guest after all.

27
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,808
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh!

28
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:49,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh!

29
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:52,733
[SPEAKER_18]: That's alright, we'll keep the webcam angled this way, that's right.

30
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Say hello to Arcadian42, Bradley just showed up.

31
00:04:58,996 --> 00:04:59,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

32
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:05,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we appreciate Arcadian's presence, even though we did think we were going to have a guest-free show, but that's alright.

33
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:13,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well, we certainly have some Bomani news to talk about tonight, believe it or not, and randomness.

34
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,184
[SPEAKER_18]: I assure you there's plenty of randomness tonight.

35
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:15,705
[SPEAKER_18]: You okay?

36
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:16,865
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate jalapenos!

37
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:17,746
[SPEAKER_24]: Why am I eating them?

38
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:22,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Jamie is starting off the show in her traditional manner by eating.

39
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:24,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I haven't had dinner, okay?

40
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any food at my house.

41
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,012
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally porked out before tonight's show.

42
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:31,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I ate so much food, I just... I've had low-carb chocolate truffles.

43
00:05:32,694 --> 00:05:33,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Three of them.

44
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:34,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And half a deviled egg.

45
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:38,178
[SPEAKER_18]: I had skinny crust pizza from Roundtable.

46
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:41,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that I'm on a diet or anything, I just really like the skinny crust pizza.

47
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I like New York pizza, which is pretty much very similar.

48
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:45,042
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very skinny crusty.

49
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,769
[SPEAKER_18]: We're about to watch Loki fall to his certain death.

50
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:50,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe his portal to hell will open up.

51
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:51,730
[SPEAKER_09]: And take him home to his people.

52
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,232
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some news that we missed last week because Extreme was the big news last week.

53
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,233
[SPEAKER_18]: We even have some news we kind of missed that I want to get to.

54
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:39,450
[SPEAKER_18]: and I know I want to get pissed off at some point tonight I actually have something I'm kind of pissed off about I want to rant about later and well I'm sure you guys are feeling some anger too so we'll definitely have an FU of the week segment cage match and all your favorite stuff when we come back from this break featuring some music from DDR Extreme USA but songs that have already been in DDR before but they're fun songs we're playing them again in Extreme USA so enjoy

55
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,127
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I just can be the babysitter all night.

57
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:05,511
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so cool.

58
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:09,553
[SPEAKER_18]: So, come be disciplined by DarkSakura in our charity.

59
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:10,293
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you want it.

60
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:15,875
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like you said in the very first episode of Orange Ones Radio.

61
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:16,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll never forget this.

62
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:20,157
[SPEAKER_18]: You were ranting about parents at Golfland.

63
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:21,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

64
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,320
[SPEAKER_18]: And you said, I remember the quote, you said something like, if you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

65
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Parents don't want me to do their job.

66
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:31,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be a scary mom.

67
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:36,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, we got the new Ultramix 2 song.

68
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:38,189
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll play that for you at some point tonight.

69
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:39,790
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a previous Cage Match winner.

70
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:43,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it was picked by DarkSakura.

71
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:45,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute.

72
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:47,177
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we'll be back.

73
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,578
Thank you for watching!

74
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:26,725
Here we go, here we go, here we go

75
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,490
Thanks for watching!

76
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:38,995
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to rock!

77
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:24,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on the air.

78
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,627
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, whatever happened to Step Squad?

79
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,388
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't heard you talk about them in a while, Jamie.

80
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't hardly heard from anybody lately.

81
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,072
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, I've been so busy that it's hard to keep up with anyone.

82
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:58,338
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to explain what Step Squad is, because we have a lot of new people that only started listening a couple months ago, and we started giving, you know, exclusive hints and stuff.

83
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:02,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Now people start listening to us, so explain for those that don't know what Step Squad is all about.

84
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:12,354
[SPEAKER_09]: StepSquad was established to sort of combat some of the, I guess, more negative aspects of the whole DDR team business that was going on.

85
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,595
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically just people who were... Owned you!

86
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:16,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Owned you more!

87
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:19,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I pwned you.

88
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Pwned!

89
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:24,017
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so stupid.

90
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:27,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway... Let me back up for Adley.

91
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:29,576
[SPEAKER_09]: He said no.

92
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:42,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, it was more or less just an attempt to show some of the more positive aspects of a group of people who would, I guess, embody those type of... What the hell are you doing?

93
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:44,085
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

94
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:52,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, it was supposed to be more or less the whole positive aspect of what a DDR community could be like.

95
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:57,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I haven't hardly, though, heard from anybody because we're all

96
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Busy, busy people.

97
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:07,659
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to school and having no life and... Okay, that cover is scaring me.

98
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:15,484
[SPEAKER_09]: That's... Okay, everybody needs to go on to OrangeOnRadio.com and look at the webcam.

99
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:17,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Because... I can't see it.

100
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:18,185
It's fucking dark.

101
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:19,866
[SPEAKER_09]: I said it's dark.

102
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:20,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Stupid cam.

103
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:21,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Stupid eye toy.

104
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:22,788
No, it's not the cam.

105
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:24,829
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fucking uploading fine.

106
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,150
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just something on the website and that's...

107
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:30,323
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't finished the damn thing yet.

108
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:33,824
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all of the energy that you're putting into it while you're making it.

109
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:35,525
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell's wrong with my computer?

110
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:36,685
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the resolution on your monitor.

111
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:37,305
[SPEAKER_16]: My goddamn monitor sucks.

112
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:37,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes it does.

113
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:37,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

114
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:00,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I can't go up any higher.

115
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:02,358
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to get a new monitor.

116
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,620
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't need to get a new monitor, I just need to turn the gamma up.

117
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, fine, I'll do it anyways.

118
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:08,744
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

119
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:13,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you were talking?

120
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:17,171
[SPEAKER_09]: No one was paying attention, so I just stopped.

121
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,915
[SPEAKER_09]: It was about Step Squad and how cool we are.

122
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:26,395
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a sequel to a classic Orange Lounge Radio inside joke coming up.

123
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:46,338
[SPEAKER_09]: My week consisted of work and school.

124
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:46,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, guess what?

125
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:47,098
[SPEAKER_18]: I have no life.

126
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:17,858
[SPEAKER_09]: All I do is go to work and all I do is go to school and go to the track and go to the gym.

127
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:26,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to spin and I was so happy because I was so pissed off and mad at the world on Friday that I went to spin and had a fun time.

128
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Worked out all that aggression.

129
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,301
[SPEAKER_09]: But nothing really major happened this week.

130
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting Sims 2, which is going to make me happy and I'll have even less free time.

131
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:46,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also training somebody at work.

132
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:56,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got a few, actually a few more changes in mind in my chosen field.

133
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Different things at work going on.

134
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:04,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really going to go into too much detail about it, but there may be some changes afoot the next couple of months.

135
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:06,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

136
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to a party last night.

137
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,355
[SPEAKER_09]: You know me, I'm such the party girl.

138
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:17,457
[SPEAKER_09]: But I ended up, because I was just going to go hang out and do whatever.

139
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:18,237
[SPEAKER_18]: What was the occasion?

140
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:19,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Random.

141
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:20,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Just random party?

142
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:23,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, oh my god, we're bored, let's have a party.

143
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:24,679
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that works.

144
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:27,880
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was over at Iguana Girl's house.

145
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,401
[SPEAKER_09]: And oh my god, Moo is female.

146
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:37,166
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't know what gender Moo was, because iguanas take a year before... Oh, I was like, who the hell's Moo?

147
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:38,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Moo is her iguana.

148
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:39,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

149
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:40,489
[SPEAKER_09]: But Moo's now in the big cage.

150
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And Moo is very happy and cute and female.

151
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:44,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

152
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:45,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is going to be fun when she starts laying eggs.

153
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:48,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they lay eggs like chickens.

154
00:17:50,857 --> 00:17:52,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, um...

155
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:56,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I decided that because everybody was having... Oh my god, that was so creepy.

156
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:57,127
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

157
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,689
[SPEAKER_09]: The webcam, he had it pointed down the hall and it turned red.

158
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,469
[SPEAKER_09]: It made me think of Silent Hill 4.

159
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:04,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to what I was saying.

160
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:09,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I just decided that I was going to participate and, you know, not be a pooper.

161
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:14,476
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had 12 jello shots.

162
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember kids, Orange Lounge Radio wants you to drink responsibly.

163
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't drive.

164
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,552
[SPEAKER_18]: I called Dan and said... See, that's the classic double standard I love about this culture.

165
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:32,493
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always, you know, be sure that if you drive, you drink responsibly.

166
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:34,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, if you didn't drive, get fucked up.

167
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:35,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody cares.

168
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:36,814
[SPEAKER_18]: You just get fucked up.

169
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:37,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your liver.

170
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:41,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Once you got your keys in the bowl, you can get fucked up.

171
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:43,576
[SPEAKER_09]: My keys were in my purse.

172
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:44,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew better.

173
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But I ended up having 12 Jell-O shots because it was all low-carb stuff.

174
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:51,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So vodka is low-carb.

175
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:56,388
[SPEAKER_09]: We had it with sugar-free jello, so I had 12 of them.

176
00:18:57,108 --> 00:19:02,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I have this thing for vodka, I don't feel it until after I'm done with it.

177
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:16,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I also had a couple glasses of this cranberry vodka beverage, and then this cranberry and orange liqueur beverage, and something else, and lots of meat.

178
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:20,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in happy booze meat heaven.

179
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:23,695
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

180
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:28,137
[SPEAKER_18]: That is so like a quintessential quote for you now.

181
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:30,058
[SPEAKER_18]: I was in happy booze meat heaven.

182
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

183
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Please somebody note the date and time.

184
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:36,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

185
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:39,483
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our archivist in the chat room.

186
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:40,143
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be at 6.50.

187
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:40,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

188
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:44,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Our archivist is in the chat room, so we'll let her handle it.

189
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:45,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, could you write that down for the next intro?

190
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:46,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

191
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:55,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I also put some more thought into, I'm actually, one of my classes I finished all the homework for.

192
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:56,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very happy.

193
00:19:57,153 --> 00:20:00,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Another one, I have one more week of assignments and I'm done with that class.

194
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:04,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Hallelujah, praise the Lord, no more databases.

195
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:07,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I spent four hours freaking working on a database today.

196
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:09,826
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucks.

197
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:14,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was also chatting with people too, which I thought was more important than doing my homework.

198
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,670
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was really it.

199
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go ahead and try to get the other one done Thursday ahead of time.

200
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go ahead and get it out of the way.

201
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop putting it off.

202
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:26,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Although procrastination is pretty fun.

203
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:30,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, that was my week, my day.

204
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:32,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah!

205
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:35,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I passed out at 11.30 and woke up at 6.30 in the morning.

206
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:37,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And guess what?

207
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:38,775
[SPEAKER_18]: You sound like me at a party.

208
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:47,122
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just decided I was randomly sleepy and I just laid... I mean, I actually did consciously go to bed.

209
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:50,985
[SPEAKER_09]: And then next thing I know, it's 6 in the morning.

210
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:54,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I am wide awake and not hungover.

211
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,809
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I don't think I would even drink so badly.

212
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you should have went to church today.

213
00:20:59,351 --> 00:20:59,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Bite me.

214
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, I don't know.

215
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:10,072
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, I ended up wide awake, not in the least hungover.

216
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:13,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's when I ate that chocolate.

217
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:30,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that I would have, I think that I would not drink as wildly as I do on the rare times that I do because I don't have any consequences other than my liver going, I just don't get hungover.

218
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming from a long line of beer drinking, you know.

219
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:40,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Not me, I don't like beer.

220
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, somebody else talk, I'm tired.

221
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:46,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, fine, we'll move on to somebody else's weekend day.

222
00:21:46,864 --> 00:21:49,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

223
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:53,129
[SPEAKER_16]: My week was okay, I was mainly hobbling around still.

224
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,292
[SPEAKER_16]: A little better now, my toe is...

225
00:21:57,998 --> 00:21:58,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Epsom salts

226
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:14,724
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

227
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:39,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Literally, you know what the movie's about.

228
00:22:40,012 --> 00:22:42,112
[SPEAKER_16]: You've already seen the entire story in the movie.

229
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:50,075
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I watched Ju-On, which is, for those who don't know it, the Japanese version of the movie coming out called The Grudge.

230
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,776
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you've seen that movie, then you've seen The Grudge already.

231
00:22:55,497 --> 00:23:00,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's pretty much, from what I've seen in the trailers, exactly the same shots.

232
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:00,738
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

233
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say something about that.

234
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:10,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the trailer for Ringu and The Ring had all the same identical scenes, and there was a lot different about the movies.

235
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:18,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the only thing that's going to be different, I think, is one, it's probably going to be linear, because Ju-on was fucking hard to follow.

236
00:23:18,294 --> 00:23:19,536
[SPEAKER_16]: It just kept skipping around.

237
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:21,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, what the hell is going on here?

238
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:29,745
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, my only complaint about it is, how can people be that dumb to walk into a haunted house, like, constantly?

239
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:35,489
[SPEAKER_16]: They're like, yeah, so we know that every single person that's gone through this house has disappeared, so I'm gonna go inside that house!

240
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:37,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Save on the, uh, tax.

241
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:45,255
[SPEAKER_16]: And then at the very end of the movie, they, like, show something that's kinda, I guess, would be, like, a way to ward off whatever it is.

242
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:50,438
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, like, not even 30 seconds later, another ghost comes.

243
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:56,496
[SPEAKER_16]: and the woman doesn't do the thing that wore it off the first one and then she disappears.

244
00:23:57,137 --> 00:24:00,685
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, how can you not see that?

245
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:02,397
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

246
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,586
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

247
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:55,605
[SPEAKER_16]: This is quite weird.

248
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:59,467
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um... So, that was a cool movie.

249
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:04,810
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, other than that, I got, um... I don't know, I played more Final Fantasy.

250
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,552
[SPEAKER_16]: And I bought some new CDs.

251
00:25:07,592 --> 00:25:10,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought, um... Stephen Lynch's CD.

252
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:11,554
[SPEAKER_16]: He's funny.

253
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:15,597
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, um... BT, 10 years in the... What was it?

254
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:20,119
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like, um... 10 years... Oh, 10 years in the life.

255
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was, um...

256
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:32,245
[SPEAKER_16]: like a compilation of his best works plus some new stuff I haven't heard of BT and remixes that he did including Crystal Method remix that he did and that was kind of cool.

257
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:37,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, really not all that much went on.

258
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:44,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a little bit of movies and hobbling and still didn't finish the device.

259
00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:45,448
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm working on it.

260
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:48,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I got Sims 2 and I was torturing Sims.

261
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:49,269
[SPEAKER_16]: That was fun.

262
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:51,970
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing about that game though is that um

263
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:54,706
[SPEAKER_16]: It has really slow fires.

264
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:59,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I started a fire in my kitchen and it took it about two days to finally get across the kitchen.

265
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:08,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, it's cool because the fire department can't come even though I have smoke detectors because I have a motor around my house and there's no way in or out.

266
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:19,434
[SPEAKER_16]: But, if you're interested in what I thought about The Sims 2, you can check out my review on OrangeLoungeRadio.com which we have reviews for other games on there too.

267
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:34,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, actually, Jason and I are talking about plans to try and expand the reviews section a little later, too, because I want to do a full review of DDR Extreme, although I am going to have a mini-review of DDR Extreme showing up in the very near future somewhere else.

268
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,589
[SPEAKER_18]: So, maybe we'll talk about that later, I don't know.

269
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:39,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else you want to share about your weekend today?

270
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Um... I don't think so.

271
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,011
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's it.

272
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:48,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Bradley, how was your week?

273
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:48,472
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your day?

274
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:51,493
[SPEAKER_17]: It was pretty boring, uh,

275
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,337
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

276
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:24,410
[SPEAKER_17]: And then after that, not much.

277
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:25,991
[SPEAKER_17]: This weekend didn't do very much.

278
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:28,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Did my state taxes?

279
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:28,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh boy.

280
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:34,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you can wait until October if you don't owe anything.

281
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:36,359
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's about it.

282
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:37,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Right on.

283
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Exciting.

284
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,601
[SPEAKER_18]: My week and my day.

285
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:43,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Like Jamie, I was kind of a party animal this weekend.

286
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:45,765
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to a party Friday night.

287
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:50,783
[SPEAKER_18]: My friend John had a birthday, so I went over to his house for a birthday party, and I went with a bunch of my friends.

288
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:54,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, I didn't really get a chance to drink a whole lot.

289
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:59,427
[SPEAKER_18]: I did like a shot or two, but I didn't get quite as comfortable as Jamie did at the party she went to.

290
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:00,408
[SPEAKER_18]: But it was a good time.

291
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:02,089
[SPEAKER_18]: I met a lot of really nice new people.

292
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:05,050
[SPEAKER_18]: I met this one girl who was really into anime.

293
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:10,813
[SPEAKER_18]: She seemed like she'd be somebody who might like this show, so hopefully I remembered to plug the show with her, but I don't remember.

294
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:28,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, and just, you know, a lot of cool people there, and we just had a good time laughing, hanging out, and then yesterday I actually decided to drive to my old hometown, I lived there for three years, where I went to school, in Chico, California, which is about an hour northeast.

295
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:56,948
[SPEAKER_18]: about an hour and a half north of Sacramento where this show is based which is a little college town there really isn't anything in Chico, California except a college and retired people so it's this interesting mix of people but I had myself a good time I never really enjoyed the place while I lived there but now that I'm just a visitor I actually have a lot of fun every time I go I went to this bar and I actually got a little drunk which wasn't a good idea since I had driven so I had to wait around until like

296
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,021
[SPEAKER_18]: 2, 3am so I could sober up.

297
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:03,864
[SPEAKER_18]: But we went to this bar and I just danced like crazy.

298
00:29:03,924 --> 00:29:04,564
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what it was.

299
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:06,486
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just totally dancing like crazy.

300
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,047
[SPEAKER_18]: Flailing my arms about and jumping.

301
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:13,110
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I saw this guy and this girl were dancing next to me.

302
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:21,775
[SPEAKER_18]: And the girl at one point hopped up on the guy's shoulders and the guy was doing all these dirty things to the girl and then the girl started leaning back.

303
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:25,017
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a really bad scene out of the pool scene in Showgirls.

304
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I was just

305
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,780
[SPEAKER_04]: The way you were describing that...

306
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,774
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember they played Sandstorm, was one song they played, and I was like, I'll dance into that.

307
00:29:55,814 --> 00:29:59,937
[SPEAKER_18]: And they had played Better Off Alone, which isn't a DDR song, but it really should be, you know.

308
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:00,798
[SPEAKER_15]: It's classic.

309
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:01,198
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

310
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:04,061
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I was just having a good time, so.

311
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:11,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that I actually dance like DDR because that really is not the point.

312
00:30:14,218 --> 00:30:15,359
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, it's still kind of fun.

313
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,260
[SPEAKER_18]: And I guess that's really it.

314
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,981
[SPEAKER_18]: I just kind of partied a lot this weekend.

315
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:25,004
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going out tonight to a club again, so I'm kind of being a little... But tonight I'm going back to the goth club.

316
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:28,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I had a lot of fun last time I was there, so I'm going again tonight.

317
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to go act all morbid and... Yes.

318
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:33,569
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to paint my nails black and look like I have dead eyes.

319
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:34,069
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm kidding.

320
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,090
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just going to go have fun.

321
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:36,851
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

322
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:41,135
[SPEAKER_09]: You should go to the goth club and wear like yellow.

323
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:43,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I should.

324
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:47,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Go dress like a cheerleader or something.

325
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, they'd probably think that was cool.

326
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:53,184
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd be the evil cheerleader.

327
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:53,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

328
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:55,245
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, it's funny.

329
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:59,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I know you don't like going to dance clubs, but if you like dance clubs, you would like this one.

330
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:04,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'd have to go sometime just to stand in the corner and look, you know, evil.

331
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:06,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well that's what a lot of people do, actually, yeah.

332
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:08,455
[SPEAKER_09]: You just stand there looking for it.

333
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:10,557
[SPEAKER_18]: You fit right in, I swear, you fit right in.

334
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:15,721
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the prerequisite for being goth, you have to be able to stand around and look bored.

335
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:18,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And wear lots of black.

336
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:22,907
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's how it was with all the people I hung out with.

337
00:31:23,387 --> 00:31:28,572
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember the goth club, that's where the big hairy guy in the corset wanted to have sex with me.

338
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:30,233
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

339
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,280
[SPEAKER_18]: We're bears.

340
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Grr.

341
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:37,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, it's because I thought of this movie I saw on Thursday.

342
00:31:37,303 --> 00:31:38,904
[SPEAKER_18]: I went and saw a movie called A Dirty Shame.

343
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:43,047
[SPEAKER_18]: And for those that know me well at all, I'm a huge John Waters fan.

344
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:44,668
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't know who John Waters is, you should.

345
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:46,510
[SPEAKER_18]: He directed Hairspray.

346
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Hairspray.

347
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, back before it was a musical.

348
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,993
[SPEAKER_18]: But, like, Hairspray is, like, very tame for his movies.

349
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:54,555
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm talking movies like Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom, Desperate Living.

350
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:55,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are all the ones I really like.

351
00:31:55,736 --> 00:31:56,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't seen Serial Mom.

352
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you should.

353
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Serial Mom's a wonderful movie.

354
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:03,047
[SPEAKER_18]: But he has a new movie in theaters called The Dirty Shame, and it's a total sex comedy.

355
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:03,687
[SPEAKER_18]: It's NC-17.

356
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:07,010
[SPEAKER_18]: It is just absolutely perverse.

357
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:09,652
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know why I was thinking of that movie just now, but I was.

358
00:32:10,753 --> 00:32:18,660
[SPEAKER_18]: I do recommend it, even though, seriously, the last 30 minutes of the film, whoever wrote the script was so coked up that it makes absolutely no sense.

359
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:21,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Just being honest with you.

360
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:27,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, on that note, let's go back to our show.

[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, Skype line will be open up a little bit later.

[SPEAKER_18]: Click on interact with us if you want to interact with the show.

364
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:41,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, as promised a little bit earlier, I have the sequel to an inside joke.

365
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:43,603
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is actually one of our new inside jokes.

366
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:51,185
[SPEAKER_18]: But do you remember a couple weeks ago when we had a little bit of a flub up from Tom Brokaw and he was doing the bukake thing?

367
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:51,585
Mmm...

368
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:57,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it actually came to my attention.

369
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,209
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually in the intro.

370
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,831
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually came to my attention at the party I was at on Friday.

371
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:05,612
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason, you know, I was talking about the Bukkake.

372
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:06,573
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how it came up.

373
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:09,574
[SPEAKER_18]: But somebody told me, said, hey Rob, you know what?

374
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:11,975
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not the first time he's done that.

375
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:15,157
[SPEAKER_18]: He actually flubbed up once before and they told me where to go.

376
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,498
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is old news.

377
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:21,760
[SPEAKER_18]: This flub up is like a year old, but I swear it's twice as funny.

378
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:23,190
[SPEAKER_18]: So listen to this.

379
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,552
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little bit long, but listen carefully.

380
00:33:25,993 --> 00:33:27,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Listen carefully for the mistake.

381
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:36,419
[SPEAKER_01]: The president's trip to Ohio today was a bold effort to cash in on his wartime popularity as he tries to push through his tax cuts.

382
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,900
[SPEAKER_01]: The key component, and what the president insists, is a job stimulus program.

383
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:44,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.

384
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:55,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And as NBC's David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cuts are the answer.

385
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:02,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you hear that?

386
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:04,245
[SPEAKER_24]: My God.

387
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:05,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, one more time.

388
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,066
[SPEAKER_24]: Rob's over there doing the little schoolgirl giggle.

389
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,266
[SPEAKER_14]: One more time, one more time.

390
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:21,249
[SPEAKER_01]: The president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts... Tax cunts?

391
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:22,529
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so funny.

392
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,790
[SPEAKER_18]: It's funny when serious news people make big mistakes like that.

393
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,190
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean...

394
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,141
[SPEAKER_03]: You would find that funny.

395
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:34,903
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, how many times do you hear the word cunt on the nightly news?

396
00:34:34,983 --> 00:34:35,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

397
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,965
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is not convinced of tax cuts?

398
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:46,312
[SPEAKER_18]: That absolutely has nothing to do with Bomani and it has nothing to do with video gaming whatsoever.

399
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,914
[SPEAKER_24]: It has to do with Rob having a giggle fit.

400
00:34:49,094 --> 00:34:50,295
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really fucking funny.

401
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I've thought of that phrase several times today.

402
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:54,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I'll just be sitting there.

403
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:58,781
[SPEAKER_18]: I was sitting there at dinner earlier today and I was just eating and then suddenly I just had these images.

404
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:00,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is not convinced of tax cuts?

405
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:02,707
[SPEAKER_18]: And I started giggling.

406
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:07,729
[SPEAKER_18]: God bless the internet.

407
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,271
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll post that sound file on our forums a little later, just like I did the Bukkake thing.

408
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:17,132
[SPEAKER_15]: That was beautiful.

409
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:25,916
[SPEAKER_19]: See, what did I tell you, chat room?

410
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:26,676
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you think?

411
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:28,516
[SPEAKER_19]: Was that better than Bukkake?

412
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:29,837
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they think so.

413
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:33,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm getting a lot of ha-ha-has, so I guess they like that.

414
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,713
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like a year old, but I had never heard of that.

415
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,854
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it was new to me, so I figured it would be new to you guys, too.

416
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:39,515
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't hear about that.

417
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:40,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe you guys did, I don't know.

418
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:43,457
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people in the world who do not pay attention to the news.

419
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:44,697
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I know.

420
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:46,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

421
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:57,283
[SPEAKER_18]: And in case you don't know what a cunt is, because it looks like someone in our chatroom doesn't know, a cunt is a euphemism for a lady's

422
00:35:59,623 --> 00:35:59,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

423
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:00,523
[SPEAKER_26]: Anatomy.

424
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:01,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Anatomy.

425
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:02,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Take that as you will.

426
00:36:02,684 --> 00:36:02,984
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

427
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,545
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's change topics really quick here before I get into stuff too far.

428
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:11,345
[SPEAKER_18]: And actually, we will do a Bomani-related piece here.

429
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:14,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, Ultramix 2.

430
00:36:14,526 --> 00:36:16,626
[SPEAKER_18]: There's some brand new news on Ultramix 2 this week.

431
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,747
[SPEAKER_18]: A brand new song was revealed.

432
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:21,187
[SPEAKER_18]: And the band is Delirium.

433
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,048
[SPEAKER_18]: And the song is called After All.

434
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:24,368
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's remixed...

435
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:29,707
[SPEAKER_18]: It's remixed by a couple guys who did a really popular song in 7th style.

436
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:31,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I did do that in a cage match.

437
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:34,869
[SPEAKER_18]: And you actually, yeah, you put this song in a cage match one time.

438
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:35,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I won the cage match with it.

439
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:41,730
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the really interesting thing is now this is the first, now where was the Orange Lounge Radio cage match based on?

440
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,351
[SPEAKER_18]: We originally said it was like songs that we want to hear in DDR.

441
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:51,353
[SPEAKER_18]: And lo and behold, we have our very first cage match winning song that is now in a DDR game.

442
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm prophetic.

443
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm prophetic.

444
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:53,801
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm prophetic.

445
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:54,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm prophetic.

446
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:55,222
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm prophetic.

447
00:37:23,612 --> 00:37:24,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody knows that song.

448
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:25,236
[SPEAKER_18]: You like that song, right?

449
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:26,039
[SPEAKER_18]: The one from 2DX?

450
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,545
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, those guys, Svensson and Ghislaine, remixed...

451
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:31,310
[SPEAKER_18]: A Delirium song, and it's going to be in DDR Ultimate's tune.

452
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,011
[SPEAKER_18]: We are going to play it.

453
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,032
[SPEAKER_18]: The clue stumped everybody for a long, long time.

454
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:36,513
[SPEAKER_18]: But actually, I'm really proud.

455
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:39,955
[SPEAKER_18]: One of our news guys, Dark Tetsuya, was the one that finally solved the clue.

456
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:43,657
[SPEAKER_18]: And the way he figured it out was, finally, he did a Google search.

457
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:49,220
[SPEAKER_18]: There were these two guys on the picture that Jason Enos had posted in the DDR Freak thread.

458
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,181
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, not Jason.

459
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:50,781
[SPEAKER_18]: What am I thinking?

460
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:51,081
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

461
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:54,803
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody that worked at the company or somebody there had posted in the DDR Freak thread.

462
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:55,304
[SPEAKER_18]: What am I thinking?

463
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:55,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

464
00:37:56,716 --> 00:38:00,417
[SPEAKER_18]: about these two guys that were like gay guys or something.

465
00:38:00,897 --> 00:38:03,478
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody was like... Thunderpuss?

466
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:05,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was like, who are these?

467
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,120
[SPEAKER_18]: They're like gay guys or something like that, right?

468
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,522
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody was assuming that the guys were gay, and they were totally wrong.

469
00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:17,163
[SPEAKER_18]: They just happened to be Svensson and Geelan, but nobody thought to search for Svensson and Geelan.

470
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:19,764
[SPEAKER_18]: So, very interesting, huh?

471
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:22,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

472
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:28,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it's kind of funny because I didn't even realize it when I was doing the show a couple weeks ago.

473
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,215
[SPEAKER_09]: And I played another version I have of After All.

474
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:38,281
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually on the Delirium's best, I think it was.

475
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:41,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is it.

476
00:38:41,645 --> 00:38:43,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that both versions are on here.

477
00:38:47,235 --> 00:38:53,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, no, it's not on this one, but it's on another Delirium CD that I have that has both versions of it.

478
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're going to play that song for you guys.

479
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:04,700
[SPEAKER_18]: And after that, we'll play, I guess we'll play the whole Beauty of Silence so you guys can hear it.

480
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:27,787
[SPEAKER_18]: and then we'll come back with the show but I know you guys may not have all heard this song yet sometimes people look to us to play the new Ultramix 2 songs for you guys so we're going to play it for you guys right now and when we come back there's more news about Ultramix 2 I want to get into this is on everybody's mind this week and I have a lot I want to say about it too as well so here we go this is Delirium with After All

481
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:29,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Spencer and GhilaMix, new for Ultramix 2.

482
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:30,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy!

483
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:49,722
Thanks for watching!

484
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,369
Thank you for watching!

485
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:32,282
and more.

486
00:43:06,597 --> 00:43:08,338
Thanks for watching!

487
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:33,955
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

488
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:33,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Gaming Radio.

489
00:44:33,406 --> 00:44:38,390
[SPEAKER_18]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

490
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:42,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio.

491
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,837
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

492
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:48,618
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awful.

493
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:50,839
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to beat that joke in the ground.

494
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Just you wait.

495
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,062
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awful.

496
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:55,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.

497
00:44:56,144 --> 00:44:56,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Beautiful.

498
00:44:58,345 --> 00:44:59,526
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Honest Radio.

499
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:03,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Hope you enjoyed that little sneak peek there at Delirium with After All.

500
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Gonna be in Ultramix 2.

501
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:09,050
[SPEAKER_18]: How many more songs they have to announce for Ultramix 2 still?

502
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:09,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Like what, like 150?

503
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,671
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't, like how many songs?

504
00:45:11,831 --> 00:45:15,473
[SPEAKER_18]: There's an ungodly amount of songs they still haven't even told us for Ultramix 2.

505
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:17,834
[SPEAKER_18]: At least, at least like what, 40?

506
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:19,515
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, I don't even remember.

507
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:22,036
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't been, I haven't been doing my math very well, so.

508
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:26,473
[SPEAKER_18]: But there's a lot of new songs still coming for Ultramix 2, and that's just the beginning.

509
00:45:26,853 --> 00:45:29,655
[SPEAKER_18]: I really like that song, and I can't wait to play it in Ultramix 2.

510
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:31,616
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you gotta be excited about that one, Jamie.

511
00:45:33,618 --> 00:45:34,999
[SPEAKER_18]: You called it, in a way.

512
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:35,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

513
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:36,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so awesome.

514
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:40,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

515
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:43,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, Ultramix 2 news this week.

516
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:43,845
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a...

517
00:45:46,104 --> 00:45:55,867
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a video posted on the internet, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of this by now, but if you haven't, run on over to our website, orangeloungeradio.com, and it's the second story down on our site right now.

518
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:58,188
[SPEAKER_18]: It talks about the Ultramix 2 quad mode video.

519
00:45:58,608 --> 00:45:59,068
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

520
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:03,509
[SPEAKER_18]: A video was posted on the internet that shows quad mode in action.

521
00:46:04,669 --> 00:46:05,170
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, excuse me.

522
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:06,190
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a little burpy today.

523
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:13,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and quad mode is that mode now on DDR that you have not one, not two, not three, but four dance pads all lined up in a row, and you're dancing...

524
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:16,177
[SPEAKER_18]: Back and forth across all four dancepads.

525
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:18,859
[SPEAKER_18]: And this video was posted on the internet of this mode.

526
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:21,340
[SPEAKER_18]: And you probably haven't seen this yet, DarkSakura, have you?

527
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:21,841
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

528
00:46:22,181 --> 00:46:22,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me show you this.

529
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:34,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Because actually, what really is causing up a storm here, it has nothing to do really with the quad mode itself, but it has everything to do with how the game actually looks.

530
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,330
[SPEAKER_18]: So you definitely want to check this out here.

531
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if we can get the video up here...

532
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I gotta give it a minute, it's gonna load up here.

533
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:49,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless I saved it to the desktop or something.

534
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:55,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, it takes just as long to copy it over as it would to download it, so I'm stuck now.

535
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, it's coming, it's coming, hold on.

536
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:09,262
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, this is definitely generating a lot of buzz in the DDR community right now, because we really haven't heard a whole lot about Ultramix 2 outside of Songlist.

537
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:13,725
[SPEAKER_18]: And the game's only like, what, six weeks away, supposedly, from what we've heard?

538
00:47:13,805 --> 00:47:14,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Six weeks away from release?

539
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, here we go, here it is.

540
00:47:15,886 --> 00:47:16,467
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's the video.

541
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:20,369
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me, uh... It's a clip of Ride on the Lights.

542
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:32,658
[SPEAKER_18]: So look at that, there's all these brand new videos, there's like a motorcycle thing that's all brand new, everything looks like futuristic, like all these new videos.

543
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:37,399
[SPEAKER_18]: And then of course, you know, quad mode pretty much looks the way you would expect it to.

544
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,581
[SPEAKER_18]: But Rage has a new model, look at that, Rage looks completely different, like he's got like really poofy hair.

545
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:46,862
[SPEAKER_18]: He looks like me in the morning, kind of, with that hair.

546
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,823
[SPEAKER_19]: and his motions are much different.

547
00:47:51,863 --> 00:47:54,985
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw this though at E3 that all of the characters had new models.

548
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:56,927
[SPEAKER_19]: And now he's doing like cartwheels and stuff.

549
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Like totally different dances.

550
00:47:58,768 --> 00:47:59,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

551
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:02,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Well no, we saw it at E3.

552
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:04,552
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw Emi's hoochie model.

553
00:48:04,953 --> 00:48:07,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, but the thing is that actually this video shows you.

554
00:48:07,214 --> 00:48:08,075
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be the other video.

555
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:10,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me bring... Yeah, if I bring up the other video...

556
00:48:11,545 --> 00:48:16,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I still don't get pantsless rage They need hoochified characters for download I'm telling ya

557
00:48:40,605 --> 00:48:45,408
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to hire a model of Mr. Spanky.

558
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Look, Emi's back to normal there.

559
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:49,892
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a three-player mode.

560
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:56,937
[SPEAKER_18]: And you see multiple dancers kind of going at one time there.

561
00:48:56,957 --> 00:49:01,741
[SPEAKER_18]: You've got Afro, and you've got Rage and Emi all dancing in this one.

562
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:03,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Like a three-player dance mode.

563
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:05,698
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all doing ballet.

564
00:49:06,518 --> 00:49:09,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we need to like stop coloring them up in seconds.

565
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:19,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of all these little insane little... Anyway, you can kind of get a... I can't see Emi.

566
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:19,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't see Emi?

567
00:49:19,746 --> 00:49:20,147
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, hold up.

568
00:49:20,547 --> 00:49:20,967
[SPEAKER_18]: There's Emi.

569
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:22,348
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, it's her fourth mix.

570
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:23,028
[SPEAKER_26]: She spun by.

571
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:24,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's her fourth mix costume.

572
00:49:27,351 --> 00:49:27,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Kind of see her.

573
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:29,072
[SPEAKER_18]: She's got a little hat and stuff.

574
00:49:30,444 --> 00:49:32,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she did be Hoochie Fighter, that's cool.

575
00:49:32,324 --> 00:49:32,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so.

576
00:49:33,365 --> 00:49:40,286
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave her just like this utter Hoochie version of the 4th Mix outfit, and that was just kind of wrong.

577
00:49:41,787 --> 00:49:46,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It was not, you would think it's cool.

578
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:51,769
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway, lots of reaction in the Bomani community going on to those videos now.

579
00:49:53,303 --> 00:50:01,669
[SPEAKER_18]: I usually don't talk about certain posts on certain websites, but there was one post that really just got my panties in a bunch, to be honest.

580
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:10,596
[SPEAKER_18]: And this guy came out of the blue and just started dogging on the quad mode video saying, those steps are horrible.

581
00:50:11,784 --> 00:50:12,925
[SPEAKER_18]: And we all know this would happen.

582
00:50:14,025 --> 00:50:18,686
[SPEAKER_18]: We've told Sigurd, we've told Mel, when they were here on the show before, we said, you know what, people are going to hate the steps.

583
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:22,207
[SPEAKER_18]: We hate to say it to you guys, but that's the first thing people are going to bag on when Ultimix 2 comes out.

584
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:23,788
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sure the steps are great.

585
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:27,149
[SPEAKER_18]: They're awesome, but there's always going to be somebody that doesn't like the steps.

586
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:33,830
[SPEAKER_18]: And sure enough, this guy comes out of the woodwork and just starts dogging on the steps, saying they're horrible for a standard mode.

587
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,511
[SPEAKER_13]: What are they doing?

588
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:37,351
[SPEAKER_18]: All this bullshit.

589
00:50:38,192 --> 00:50:38,932
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just thinking...

590
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:41,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Get a load of this guy, you know, whatever.

591
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody's welcome to their opinion.

592
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:51,548
[SPEAKER_19]: But then, I found out, after some more posts went by, that this guy had done some of the step charts for In The Groove.

593
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,391
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sitting here going...

594
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Who the fuck are you?

595
00:50:57,229 --> 00:50:58,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Get off your high horse.

596
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,111
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, seriously.

597
00:50:59,572 --> 00:51:01,614
[SPEAKER_18]: I talked about In The Groove here last week on the show.

598
00:51:01,834 --> 00:51:02,855
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a nice game.

599
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:04,677
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a cute alternative to DDR.

600
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:07,540
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a replacement for DDR, but it's something else fun to play.

601
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,123
[SPEAKER_18]: But the steps are not all that, okay?

602
00:51:10,243 --> 00:51:15,549
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, they've got some neat new ideas, but they're no better or worse than what we got right now.

603
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:16,450
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, God.

604
00:51:17,093 --> 00:51:18,414
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just kind of like, God, get over yourself.

605
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:36,001
[SPEAKER_18]: I just think that's in poor taste, because when you're representing a company like that, especially when you've got all these questionable legal issues going around, for you to go and start dogging on the enemy game, I mean, it just makes you look like you had a vendetta from the start, your opinions don't mean shit, and it just makes your whole game look shitty.

606
00:51:36,061 --> 00:51:42,064
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there was a point earlier this week where I was like, I'm going to come on Sunday's show, I'm going to take back everything nice I said about In The Groove, because that guy's pissed me off.

607
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,305
[SPEAKER_18]: I've calmed down a little bit since then.

608
00:51:44,345 --> 00:51:46,626
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to take back everything nice I said about In The Groove, but

609
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,000
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, seriously, what a lack of class.

610
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I take back everything nice you said about this?

611
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:53,241
[SPEAKER_18]: You can say whatever you want.

612
00:51:53,261 --> 00:51:53,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I take it back for Rob.

613
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:00,865
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kind of surprised there's no reaction from our chat room.

614
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:02,545
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought half of them were following what was going on.

615
00:52:02,565 --> 00:52:03,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

616
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:06,667
[SPEAKER_09]: We still got people fixated on you talking about getting your panties in a bunch.

617
00:52:09,228 --> 00:52:10,629
[SPEAKER_18]: You know.

618
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:11,789
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of this, Loki?

619
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:14,951
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you're kind of more sim scene oriented than us.

620
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:15,651
[SPEAKER_18]: So what did you think of this?

621
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,641
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I didn't read the post.

622
00:52:19,562 --> 00:52:21,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably for the best, to be honest, probably for the best.

623
00:52:22,545 --> 00:52:25,287
[SPEAKER_16]: I just hate people bitching about shit that they haven't seen yet.

624
00:52:25,847 --> 00:52:27,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, they're so awful!

625
00:52:27,629 --> 00:52:28,549
[SPEAKER_16]: The game's not out yet.

626
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,511
[SPEAKER_16]: But I can tell!

627
00:52:30,871 --> 00:52:32,032
[SPEAKER_16]: I have ESP!

628
00:52:32,973 --> 00:52:33,793
[SPEAKER_16]: That's like, god.

629
00:52:33,813 --> 00:52:35,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because they're psycho and have ESP.

630
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:44,982
[SPEAKER_16]: If only he knew, if only he knew, I can't say, if only he knew, he couldn't really say anything, because it's just, you know...

631
00:52:45,731 --> 00:52:46,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

632
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:03,378
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

633
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:24,271
[SPEAKER_18]: to get this game done for us.

634
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:26,752
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's just totally disrespectful.

635
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:35,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Honestly, if this guy had nothing to do with the other game, I don't think it would be such a big deal because you could just write it off as, well, there's always going to be one heckler.

636
00:53:35,314 --> 00:53:42,675
[SPEAKER_18]: But the fact that he represents, because he worked with this other game, he therefore represents that other game, it just shows an utter lack of class.

637
00:53:42,715 --> 00:53:44,916
[SPEAKER_18]: It just disgusts me.

638
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:51,477
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not even a fact that he represents the other game because, I mean, let's just say he was the guy that was doing the art for the backgrounds for, like, you know, their...

639
00:53:52,077 --> 00:53:53,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Game, you know, songs or whatever.

640
00:53:53,517 --> 00:53:54,478
[SPEAKER_16]: That wouldn't even be so bad.

641
00:53:54,518 --> 00:53:57,078
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's the guy that did some of the step charts.

642
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's even worse.

643
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:02,720
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm getting told in the chat room, hey, don't put in the groove down because of one guy.

644
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,360
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what?

645
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said, I was going to come in here and say a lot of nasty things about it, but I decided not to.

646
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:10,122
[SPEAKER_18]: But here's the problem.

647
00:54:10,642 --> 00:54:19,624
[SPEAKER_18]: When this guy who works on the game can't show any class at all, or any sense of respect at all for what's going on, you know, on the other half of the fence...

648
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:23,967
[SPEAKER_18]: It does bring the whole image of everybody on the staff down.

649
00:54:24,047 --> 00:54:26,028
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sure there's some wonderful people that work on the game.

650
00:54:26,048 --> 00:54:27,049
[SPEAKER_18]: There's wonderful people that play the game.

651
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:27,929
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no doubt about that.

652
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:31,072
[SPEAKER_18]: But one bad apple is can't spoil a barrel.

653
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:40,939
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like if anybody out there that uses an orange lounge banner in their signature, I would expect that you're not a fucking asshat in your post because you're kind of representing our station.

654
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:44,241
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you were starting to be an asshole in your post, I would call you on it.

655
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:44,782
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say, you know what?

656
00:54:44,802 --> 00:54:46,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't use our banner anymore if you're going to act like an ass.

657
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Luckily, nice people use our banner, so we don't have that problem.

658
00:54:49,835 --> 00:54:55,499
[SPEAKER_18]: But when you're representing another company, I'm sorry, but when you act like an ass, it makes everybody look like an ass.

659
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:00,583
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

660
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,545
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I completely agree.

661
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:05,407
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I have the reason why I don't say where I work.

662
00:55:07,548 --> 00:55:08,149
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously.

663
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:11,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know how I am outside of work.

664
00:55:11,952 --> 00:55:15,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be seen as a representative of my company when I'm not associated with it.

665
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:16,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, me too.

666
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:17,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Same thing.

667
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:22,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So none of us have ever said exactly where we work for it, except for Loki, but he doesn't care.

668
00:55:22,474 --> 00:55:23,794
[SPEAKER_16]: He doesn't care what you think of his company.

669
00:55:25,554 --> 00:55:32,335
[SPEAKER_16]: To be honest, I don't think anyone would even know about how to get on internet radio at my work, let alone be able to figure things out.

670
00:55:33,256 --> 00:55:36,436
[SPEAKER_16]: They're like, where do you guys broadcast on the internet?

671
00:55:36,756 --> 00:55:37,436
[SPEAKER_16]: You can do that?

672
00:55:38,557 --> 00:55:40,437
[SPEAKER_09]: There's radio on the internet?

673
00:55:40,577 --> 00:55:41,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Holy crap.

674
00:55:41,479 --> 00:55:42,099
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the internet?

675
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:53,305
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you know, when I went to Vegas as part of the DDR Freak moderator trip, there were these guys there who were like fanboys who were following us around everywhere.

676
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:56,486
[SPEAKER_09]: And I still wanted to turn around and say, don't you have lives?

677
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:57,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Go home.

678
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:01,209
[SPEAKER_09]: But because I was a representative of DDR Freak, I didn't say that.

679
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:02,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just tolerant.

680
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,631
[SPEAKER_09]: And we actually ended up losing them.

681
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:12,332
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know that, and you know what, does the guy have valid points?

682
00:56:12,572 --> 00:56:20,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, but the problem is that it was a total attitude problem, just a total, it wouldn't take, you know, could dish it out, but couldn't take it back.

683
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,323
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm spending way too much time on this topic, to be honest.

684
00:56:23,443 --> 00:56:32,372
[SPEAKER_18]: It really doesn't deserve this much time, but that just really, I just want you guys to think out there, you know, if you're representing a certain, you know, game, stop being an idiot.

685
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:36,644
[SPEAKER_18]: And that even goes for just any old DDR player, somebody playing DDR at the arcade.

686
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:41,926
[SPEAKER_18]: If you start acting like an ass, you make every player that plays DDR look like an ass.

687
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:43,527
[SPEAKER_18]: So show a little bit of respect.

688
00:56:44,888 --> 00:56:49,990
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's just like, I kind of frown at some people, certain people that play Soul Calibur II in the area, because they're kind of assholes.

689
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:57,214
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, and I'm sure, you know, it's a great game, I own it on GameCube, but, you know, it kind of brings the whole fanbase down a little bit when a couple people look like asses.

690
00:56:57,654 --> 00:56:59,575
[SPEAKER_16]: And don't get me started on the initial D, people.

691
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna second that.

692
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:07,992
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not even gonna go there.

693
00:57:09,753 --> 00:57:11,414
[SPEAKER_18]: That's actually probably a much better example.

694
00:57:11,434 --> 00:57:12,835
[SPEAKER_18]: I can think of more examples for that.

695
00:57:14,036 --> 00:57:14,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

696
00:57:15,216 --> 00:57:19,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I play this racing game, so I have a really awesome car that's stored on a piece of paper.

697
00:57:23,662 --> 00:57:25,544
[SPEAKER_18]: I like in the groove, don't get me wrong.

698
00:57:27,345 --> 00:57:31,508
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, not just that, but, you know, initial D as well, you know.

699
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:33,429
Yeah.

700
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:35,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

701
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:37,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we beat that into the ground.

702
00:57:37,146 --> 00:57:38,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we did beat that into the ground.

703
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:38,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I have ice cream.

704
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:40,147
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, I wanted to get that out of my system.

705
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:41,307
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been sitting on that all week.

706
00:57:42,268 --> 00:57:42,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you feel better?

707
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,008
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot, actually.

708
00:57:44,088 --> 00:57:45,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you feel spiritually cleansed?

709
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:45,689
[SPEAKER_18]: I do.

710
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:47,190
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

711
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:52,092
[SPEAKER_18]: I would go so far as to welcome that guy on our show if he wants to present a dissenting opinion.

712
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:52,712
[SPEAKER_18]: Go for it.

713
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:55,293
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd love to hear it.

714
00:57:55,373 --> 00:57:56,373
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love to debate.

715
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:58,074
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be just like the presidential debate.

716
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:02,785
[SPEAKER_18]: But seriously, it's just one step chart.

717
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:07,949
[SPEAKER_18]: On a mode that really, I mean honestly, quad mode, it's cute and all, but it really isn't that important.

718
00:58:08,269 --> 00:58:11,892
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I want to see what the rest of the game looks like, to be honest.

719
00:58:11,912 --> 00:58:15,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's look at some singles and doubles and how, I mean honestly...

720
00:58:16,218 --> 00:58:19,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Out... Regardless of how you feel about the step chart, look at this.

721
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:24,805
[SPEAKER_18]: All new backgrounds, a whole new song, a whole new interface, the characters look differently.

722
00:58:25,386 --> 00:58:26,287
[SPEAKER_18]: No more Hoochie Emmy.

723
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:29,990
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there's so... You could throw the step chart out completely and there's so many good things about it.

724
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:31,931
Yeah.

725
00:58:33,152 --> 00:58:35,154
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very pissed off that they got rid of Hoochie Emmy.

726
00:58:35,214 --> 00:58:36,055
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes me sad.

727
00:58:36,535 --> 00:58:37,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe she's an Easter egg.

728
00:58:38,397 --> 00:58:39,278
[SPEAKER_16]: She's not an Easter egg.

729
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:39,618
[SPEAKER_16]: They just...

730
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:43,801
[SPEAKER_16]: You're making the poor CG woman look like a hoochie.

731
00:58:43,902 --> 00:58:46,924
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it might hurt her artificial feelings.

732
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Who cares if it didn't look right?

733
00:58:51,647 --> 00:58:54,309
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, some things just aren't right, but they happen.

734
00:58:55,149 --> 00:58:56,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Like the Olsen twins acting.

735
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,712
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just not right, but it happens.

736
00:59:00,953 --> 00:59:08,779
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, if we want to get down on someone that sucks at steps, holy crap, who about the people that made that stupid fucking hands and feet mode?

737
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:12,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are some shitty steps right there, that's what I gotta say.

738
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,371
[SPEAKER_16]: That's who you should be mad at.

739
00:59:16,272 --> 00:59:17,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Screw quad mode.

740
00:59:17,152 --> 00:59:19,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Quad mode's difficult because it's four pads.

741
00:59:19,714 --> 00:59:23,017
[SPEAKER_16]: And the feet mode, man, they did not... Screw you.

742
00:59:23,157 --> 00:59:24,578
[SPEAKER_18]: I kinda like hands and feet mode.

743
00:59:24,618 --> 00:59:25,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Screw you.

744
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:35,306
[SPEAKER_18]: You can actually... From what I hear, you can actually go in and change the difficulty, but for whatever reason, they made it kind of, like, almost impossible to find where to change... Like, I just found out about this the other day.

745
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:35,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Like...

746
00:59:36,374 --> 00:59:38,876
[SPEAKER_18]: It's almost impossible to figure out where you've got to go.

747
00:59:38,936 --> 00:59:40,077
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not obvious, in other words.

748
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:40,658
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not possible.

749
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:42,780
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not obvious where it is to change the difficulty.

750
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Tina.

751
00:59:45,142 --> 00:59:46,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, shut up, Tina.

752
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:46,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody cares.

753
00:59:49,065 --> 00:59:50,846
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate banner ads that have sound in them.

754
00:59:50,947 --> 00:59:52,208
[SPEAKER_18]: I absolutely hate them.

755
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,169
[SPEAKER_18]: And that banner is all over the internet right now.

756
00:59:54,229 --> 00:59:55,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not do feedback?

757
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:57,212
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a feedback thread.

758
00:59:57,941 --> 00:59:59,462
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, I'm not even talking about this.

759
00:59:59,523 --> 01:00:02,605
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just using this to get that one video that I lost all of a sudden.

760
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:05,608
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's on like a million other sites, too.

761
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:08,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Tina can go to hell.

762
01:00:10,012 --> 01:00:11,053
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how I feel about Tina.

763
01:00:12,835 --> 01:00:17,799
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to get to this other video, but for some reason I keep trying to pull it up and it doesn't work.

764
01:00:17,899 --> 01:00:19,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I know why, because I've got to use the other program to do it.

765
01:00:20,802 --> 01:00:21,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me...

766
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:32,677
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to load up another video that came out this week, and it actually has to do for DDR Festival.

767
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:37,679
[SPEAKER_18]: A brand new video came out for DDR Festival, and it shows something kind of interesting going on.

768
01:00:38,759 --> 01:00:40,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, what was the name of that?

769
01:00:40,759 --> 01:00:41,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that this thing?

770
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:42,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, here it is.

771
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,201
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the DDR Festival teaser.

772
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:47,661
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, obviously, we're on the radio.

773
01:00:47,701 --> 01:00:50,562
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys can't see it, but I'll tell you what's kind of going on here.

774
01:00:51,764 --> 01:00:54,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay little fireworks because it's a festival, hooray.

775
01:00:55,367 --> 01:00:55,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Obvious, right?

776
01:00:56,868 --> 01:00:57,869
[SPEAKER_18]: There's Maximizer.

777
01:01:00,751 --> 01:01:05,015
[SPEAKER_18]: And look at that, a brand new character select screen that has your characters.

778
01:01:05,055 --> 01:01:06,696
[SPEAKER_18]: There's rhythm, there's blues, and look at that.

779
01:01:07,257 --> 01:01:10,920
[SPEAKER_18]: One, two, three outfits for every character now that you can pick right there.

780
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Some people are calling that customizable characters.

781
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:15,664
[SPEAKER_18]: I call that three outfits a character, but whatever.

782
01:01:18,366 --> 01:01:19,287
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a new guy there.

783
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:20,668
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a guy named Drum.

784
01:01:21,158 --> 01:01:22,859
[SPEAKER_18]: So do you think he'll have a partner named Bass?

785
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:23,540
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

786
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:24,541
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

787
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:28,624
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's a little bit of the song list.

788
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:35,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty much what you'd expect.

789
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,591
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a clip from You're Not Here.

790
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:42,015
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit of the party mode there, but it's all in Japanese, which makes sense.

791
01:01:44,677 --> 01:01:46,719
[SPEAKER_18]: There's that Feed the Dog and Bunny mode.

792
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,642
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's some of the members from V4U playing on the iToy.

793
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:02,678
[SPEAKER_18]: And it looks much better than the eye toy actually does.

794
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:11,502
[SPEAKER_18]: You should see, like in this video, the B4U chicks, they totally are like par-a-par-ing some of these hands and feet things on eye toy.

795
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:14,763
[SPEAKER_18]: And I love Noria, she's such a crack hoe.

796
01:02:21,826 --> 01:02:24,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that, look, she's like totally par-a-par-ing to clear the screen there.

797
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:26,868
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so cute.

798
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:29,581
[SPEAKER_18]: There's Mission Mode, you know that's coming back.

799
01:02:39,348 --> 01:02:42,010
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a little clip of Your Rain, that video, we all know that song.

800
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:47,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Funk Boogie.

801
01:02:50,537 --> 01:02:53,919
[SPEAKER_18]: So, no big surprises there about DDR Festival.

802
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:57,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Not right now.

803
01:02:57,382 --> 01:02:57,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

804
01:02:57,932 --> 01:02:57,992
[SPEAKER_18]: D.D.R.

805
01:02:58,012 --> 01:02:58,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Festival

806
01:03:09,608 --> 01:03:10,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Mission Modes in Japanese

807
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,211
[SPEAKER_16]: They have better mixes anyways, get that

808
01:03:57,938 --> 01:03:58,579
[SPEAKER_18]: Euromix, Jamelia, Superstar

809
01:04:11,002 --> 01:04:12,483
[SPEAKER_18]: I've played it on my show a couple times.

810
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:14,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, my spin instructor loves that song.

811
01:04:14,263 --> 01:04:14,784
[SPEAKER_18]: She adopted it.

812
01:04:14,824 --> 01:04:15,324
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get it.

813
01:04:15,344 --> 01:04:17,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have an eye toy, so I don't really give a crap about the eye toy modes, but...

814
01:04:34,577 --> 01:04:38,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to play a game and watch myself flail around stupidly.

815
01:04:39,378 --> 01:04:39,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So no.

816
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:41,058
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll get it.

817
01:04:41,218 --> 01:04:42,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get it for stuff.

818
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,299
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, you know what, personally, I think I'm actually going to pass on it.

819
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:49,019
[SPEAKER_18]: I really don't see the point for me getting it because I can't read Japanese.

820
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,780
[SPEAKER_18]: I already have all the songs minus like three or four or whatever, how many songs haven't been in DDR yet.

821
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,981
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, there hasn't really been anything to really sell me on it yet.

822
01:04:57,261 --> 01:05:01,982
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's one of those things I'll pick up later as a collector thing, like when it's come down in price a little bit maybe.

823
01:05:02,062 --> 01:05:03,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Like try to get it when it's like...

824
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,903
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit discounted before it becomes a collector's item and everything.

825
01:05:06,943 --> 01:05:11,065
[SPEAKER_18]: But as much as I want to support DDR and all, there's too much shit to buy in the U.S.

826
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:11,266
[SPEAKER_09]: right now.

827
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:12,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I already know what else my money is going for.

828
01:05:12,686 --> 01:05:14,607
[SPEAKER_18]: And Ultramix 2 is coming out like the same week.

829
01:05:14,647 --> 01:05:16,428
[SPEAKER_18]: And honestly, my money is going there first.

830
01:05:16,448 --> 01:05:17,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I have other imports to get.

831
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:24,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to get 2DX8 style and Bujingai.

832
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:25,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the U.S.

833
01:05:25,893 --> 01:05:26,553
[SPEAKER_09]: version is ass.

834
01:05:29,284 --> 01:05:32,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I guess we're going to open up the Skype line because you know what?

835
01:05:32,425 --> 01:05:34,125
[SPEAKER_18]: We've talked about a lot of different things here.

836
01:05:34,165 --> 01:05:38,206
[SPEAKER_18]: We've kind of talked about Quad Mode and Ultramix 2 a little bit and a little bit of the controversy there.

837
01:05:38,246 --> 01:05:39,646
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about DDR Festival.

838
01:05:40,206 --> 01:05:41,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Just curious if you guys have any comments.

839
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:45,627
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, if you don't know what the Skype line is all about, visit www.orangezonsradio.com.

840
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:50,808
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on Interact With Us and you can see the details right there on how to use the Skype line.

841
01:05:50,828 --> 01:05:53,509
[SPEAKER_18]: It allows you to call our show without having a phone.

842
01:05:54,113 --> 01:06:02,020
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually think I'm going to buy the feature to allow us to call out so we can do some phone interviews later with some big name DDR celebs.

843
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:02,841
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be kind of fun.

844
01:06:04,563 --> 01:06:06,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you can actually call phone numbers using this little tab right here.

845
01:06:06,985 --> 01:06:10,468
[SPEAKER_18]: But you have to pay for credits, but I'm thinking about it.

846
01:06:10,608 --> 01:06:11,168
[SPEAKER_18]: I might do that.

847
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:11,629
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

848
01:06:12,904 --> 01:06:14,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think it's a neat idea for Skype.

849
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:22,108
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're kind of giving a minute for the buffer to catch up because it takes a minute before you guys actually hear what we say here in studio.

850
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,229
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want you guys to be able to call into the Skype line.

851
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:25,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Loki.

852
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:29,432
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to point out to Rob here.

853
01:06:29,972 --> 01:06:31,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Three-way and four-way.

854
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:32,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I'm not mentioning what else.

855
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:34,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, hopefully we get those soon.

856
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:35,615
[SPEAKER_18]: I just hope they're not fakes.

857
01:06:36,695 --> 01:06:38,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki might have something really good to play for you guys later.

858
01:06:38,696 --> 01:06:39,957
[SPEAKER_18]: I just hope to God they're not fakes.

859
01:06:40,987 --> 01:06:42,508
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that thing you were showing me earlier today?

860
01:06:42,528 --> 01:06:49,754
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess it's a couple months old, but somebody had actually written a whole document, like an FAQ, on how to make fake Bomani songs or something like that.

861
01:06:49,934 --> 01:06:51,536
[SPEAKER_18]: How to make fake test location songs.

862
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:55,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is another thing that I think is in completely poor taste.

863
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:56,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't get me started.

864
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:01,144
[SPEAKER_18]: You're just preying on poor people that are just looking to get excited about a new game.

865
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:03,646
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, you know... But whatever.

866
01:07:06,768 --> 01:07:08,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you're showing me it's somewhere in here.

867
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:08,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Some little...

868
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:13,753
[SPEAKER_18]: Some little guide on how to write a fake Bomani song.

869
01:07:13,773 --> 01:07:17,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I just had to do just running something through a bunch of filters and all this other garbage.

870
01:07:17,976 --> 01:07:19,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yay, we're getting a call.

871
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:19,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to the Sky Blind.

872
01:07:20,097 --> 01:07:21,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

873
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Sky, it's El Mollet again.

874
01:07:25,321 --> 01:07:26,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Mollet, how you doing?

875
01:07:27,122 --> 01:07:28,483
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy with the coolest name ever.

876
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:29,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, what's on your mind?

877
01:07:31,925 --> 01:07:35,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you mentioned DDR Festival and I have some choice words for DDR Festival.

878
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:38,309
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a feeling I know what's coming, but go for it.

879
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:40,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, first of all,

880
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:54,082
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know a lot of US mixes have been accused of being half-assed, like just piling things one on top of the other and not having a lot of balance to them.

881
01:07:55,243 --> 01:08:08,947
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Festival as probably a perfect example of being a half-assed mix, just as far as the Konami originals are concerned.

882
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:23,251
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if it's so much a half-assed mix, it's just the fact that for once, I think it's just the tables are turned, and we got something kind of new before Japanese did, so this game coming out for them is kind of like when we got DDR USA.

883
01:08:23,752 --> 01:08:24,392
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell was that?

884
01:08:24,412 --> 01:08:26,294
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just a rehashed thing, you know?

885
01:08:26,354 --> 01:08:27,935
[SPEAKER_18]: There really wasn't anything special about it.

886
01:08:28,095 --> 01:08:38,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll take the half-assed comment back and I'll go with rehashed, but half-assed was the first thing that I thought of, only because, and the way the Konami originals include it,

887
01:08:39,284 --> 01:09:08,247
[SPEAKER_12]: uh... thus far anyway none of them have appeared uh... have not appeared on a USA mix yet none of them I mean the fact of the matter is the entire Konami original selection you can find them on United States mixes already right but but for the for the standard you know person living in Japan who you know has a casual passing interest in DDR it is going to be something new to them so you know of course

888
01:09:08,703 --> 01:09:15,967
[SPEAKER_18]: But for us, for the import fans, for us, it's no big deal unless we don't have an Xbox or don't have a US PS2, you know?

889
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:17,648
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty much it.

890
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:23,131
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Japanese gamer, it's something nice because they get more songs that they don't have on their PS2s yet.

891
01:09:23,171 --> 01:09:25,732
[SPEAKER_12]: For the American importer, it's kind of a letdown.

892
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:29,114
[SPEAKER_19]: But for us fucking obsessive collectors, it's kind of a letdown.

893
01:09:30,654 --> 01:09:33,656
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, we have to kind of face the fact that we're in the minority.

894
01:09:34,496 --> 01:09:35,277
[SPEAKER_18]: And Konami...

895
01:09:35,848 --> 01:09:39,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Konami, they're getting three games for their buck here, really.

896
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:46,194
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we all kind of know that Konami of Japan actually were the ones that did the interface that Konami USA keeps getting criticized for.

897
01:09:46,654 --> 01:09:49,976
[SPEAKER_18]: But basically, Konami of Japan made this interface and they got three games out of it.

898
01:09:50,016 --> 01:09:53,098
[SPEAKER_18]: They got the one in Europe, they got our game, they got their new festival.

899
01:09:53,138 --> 01:09:55,159
[SPEAKER_18]: So hey, I'm sure it worked out great for them.

900
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:56,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, definitely.

901
01:09:56,812 --> 01:09:57,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Very easy to develop.

902
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:02,896
[SPEAKER_12]: You come up with a basic skeleton and then you plug in the insides.

903
01:10:03,277 --> 01:10:11,583
[SPEAKER_18]: For me, I just think it's kind of neat to kind of have the tables turned for once and we're getting something new and it's kind of like, oh, well, we don't need the Japanese mix now.

904
01:10:12,123 --> 01:10:13,824
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't need to support that.

905
01:10:13,905 --> 01:10:19,789
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the same damn argument that we heard three years ago when it was USA was getting the sloppy seconds, you know?

906
01:10:20,269 --> 01:10:20,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

907
01:10:20,609 --> 01:10:25,073
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still some people who are going to spin this into Japan's favor.

908
01:10:26,986 --> 01:10:34,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's comedy gold for all those people that were dogging on Extreme before saying it wasn't Japanese enough.

909
01:10:34,392 --> 01:10:35,873
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it is just comedy gold.

910
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:45,300
[SPEAKER_18]: It's totally just desserts for those people that just said, you know, it's crap, it's USA, just America ruined DDR.

911
01:10:45,901 --> 01:10:46,681
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not really.

912
01:10:49,123 --> 01:10:51,365
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the direction they wanted to move in, but

913
01:10:52,102 --> 01:10:59,887
[SPEAKER_18]: America, in fact, I would go so far as to say that Hawaii, which is an American state, last time I checked, is going to revolutionize CD-R.

914
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:08,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no question about that, especially when you're getting 50 songs that are completely new and never been seen before.

915
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:12,835
[SPEAKER_12]: You never see that unless you're talking about a brand new Japanese arcade mix.

916
01:11:13,197 --> 01:11:16,319
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go so far as to make a prediction here on the program.

917
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:21,723
[SPEAKER_18]: That when Ultramix 2 comes out, about a couple weeks after Ultramix 2, it is going to be so huge.

918
01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:29,429
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to be so... There are going to be those detractors, like people that work for In The Groove or whatever, that are going to be out there going, ah, this game sucks.

919
01:11:29,829 --> 01:11:36,074
[SPEAKER_18]: But for the most part, 90% of the scene is going to just love this game and say this is everything DDR should have been.

920
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:38,696
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm saying that there are going to be freaking riots everywhere.

921
01:11:40,327 --> 01:11:43,890
[SPEAKER_18]: and petitions for Konami of Hawaii to do an arcade mix.

922
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:47,533
[SPEAKER_18]: The Konami of Hawaii should be given all the rights to do a new arcade mix.

923
01:11:48,874 --> 01:11:50,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I would go so far as to say that.

924
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:53,638
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're going to be forgiven for DDRPC.

925
01:11:53,658 --> 01:11:55,319
[SPEAKER_18]: I think most people have already forgiven them for it.

926
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:00,003
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just a chance for them to get their feet wet and we've all managed to look past it now.

927
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:04,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultramix had some problems, but for the most part it was different, it was new.

928
01:12:06,808 --> 01:12:07,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultramix 2 is going to blow it all away.

929
01:12:10,009 --> 01:12:19,672
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely agree about Ultramix, too, especially with the song list is pretty much half revealed by now, and it just blows everything out of the water.

930
01:12:19,932 --> 01:12:21,013
[SPEAKER_18]: And now just the videos this week.

931
01:12:21,033 --> 01:12:22,813
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of the videos that came out this week?

932
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:26,955
[SPEAKER_12]: The Rage Remodel kicks ass.

933
01:12:27,675 --> 01:12:28,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

934
01:12:28,915 --> 01:12:31,936
[SPEAKER_18]: And the backgrounds and the videos looked awesome.

935
01:12:31,956 --> 01:12:33,497
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very impressed with the movies.

936
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:35,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy did I get screwed!

937
01:13:05,336 --> 01:13:07,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other thoughts on your mind, Mr. Mullet?

938
01:13:38,465 --> 01:13:40,586
[SPEAKER_12]: No, after that long voice thing.

939
01:13:40,846 --> 01:13:41,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's fine.

940
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:43,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we appreciate your perspective as always.

941
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:45,147
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

942
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a wonderful day.

943
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:47,408
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

944
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:48,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, bye-bye.

945
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:51,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

946
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:53,990
[SPEAKER_18]: The other line was ringing.

947
01:13:55,671 --> 01:13:58,512
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure we'll get a return call there.

948
01:13:58,532 --> 01:13:59,252
[SPEAKER_18]: We can pick that up.

949
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:05,233
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to interact with the show, www.oransonsradio.com and click on interact with us.

950
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:06,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Here comes a call.

951
01:14:06,094 --> 01:14:07,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, you're on Oransons Radio.

952
01:14:10,275 --> 01:14:10,956
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, who's this?

953
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,638
[SPEAKER_19]: You're breaking up really, really badly.

954
01:14:15,718 --> 01:14:16,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, hi, how you doing?

955
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:16,998
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

956
01:14:17,058 --> 01:14:17,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you're...

957
01:14:27,808 --> 01:14:31,071
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate to do this, but I gotta let you go because we can't hear you at all.

958
01:14:31,111 --> 01:14:32,612
[SPEAKER_19]: You're really breaking up bad.

959
01:14:32,672 --> 01:14:33,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Double check your connection.

960
01:14:34,653 --> 01:14:36,375
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really, really breaking up there.

961
01:14:36,435 --> 01:14:40,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't understand you, so we'll try that again later.

962
01:14:40,498 --> 01:14:41,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we'll get a better connection.

963
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:45,922
[SPEAKER_18]: That's kind of one of the downsides of having to take the calls online is that when you get the packet lost and all that crap.

964
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,883
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki, you downloading porn over there?

965
01:14:47,903 --> 01:14:49,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that why it's so choppy?

966
01:14:49,465 --> 01:14:49,885
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just kidding.

967
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:51,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

968
01:14:52,027 --> 01:14:54,128
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess we better disable the skyline for a little bit.

969
01:14:54,629 --> 01:14:56,450
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll let it get a little better there.

970
01:14:57,032 --> 01:15:04,738
[SPEAKER_18]: and we'll go to a break because I want to get to the Orange Lingerie Cage Match and some other Bimani news that came out this week for sure.

971
01:15:04,758 --> 01:15:06,099
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have other favorite segments.

972
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and we'll open up the skyline a little bit again later.

973
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:21,472
[SPEAKER_18]: In this break we're going to hear some music from, I don't know, some Japanese mixes, some Japanese songs that are popular in DDR because Jamie really wanted to hear Ninzaburro or...

974
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:24,949
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell is the other name of Ninzaburro?

975
01:15:24,989 --> 01:15:25,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's called the Ninzaburro.

976
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:26,751
[SPEAKER_08]: The theme of Furuhata.

977
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:28,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Furuhata theme.

978
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:28,933
[SPEAKER_18]: I couldn't even remember that.

979
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:30,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is from the show, Furuhata Ninzaburro.

980
01:15:30,736 --> 01:15:31,096
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

981
01:15:31,396 --> 01:15:36,082
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to play some of these songs, and then we will be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

982
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:36,763
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

983
01:15:55,171 --> 01:15:56,174
and many more.

984
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:31,815
Thank you for watching!

985
01:18:44,564 --> 01:18:48,265
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, one, two, three, come on!

986
01:18:48,305 --> 01:18:53,026
We are a simulation, a simulation, a simulation

987
01:20:27,185 --> 01:20:28,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

988
01:20:28,766 --> 01:20:30,928
[SPEAKER_18]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

989
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:37,652
[SPEAKER_18]: I was a little bit of awkward silence there.

990
01:20:37,692 --> 01:20:38,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, guys.

991
01:20:38,813 --> 01:20:40,994
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

992
01:20:41,835 --> 01:20:47,599
[SPEAKER_18]: I just got distracted by the chat room while I was trying to queue up the last bit of playlist thing there, and I got too distracted.

993
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:49,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't spam our chat room.

994
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

995
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:56,900
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot to mention that actually I was up this morning.

996
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:01,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I was up until 5.30 last night, and I got up this morning at about 11.30 or so.

997
01:21:02,301 --> 01:21:04,142
[SPEAKER_18]: I started playing Ultramix all morning.

998
01:21:04,202 --> 01:21:10,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I swear to God, I was playing Ultramix for like two hours today online on the dance, playing against other people thing.

999
01:21:11,004 --> 01:21:19,046
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think in one day, I raised my ranking on the ranking board from 999, which is basically as low as you can get.

1000
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:21,427
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to get a certain amount of points or you can never crack that number.

1001
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:26,209
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I raised it up all the way to like 640-something in a day's work.

1002
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:31,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Which isn't that many points, but for some reason today, Ultramix is still popular.

1003
01:21:31,852 --> 01:21:39,796
[SPEAKER_18]: I was in a lot of four-person matches, and the people were kind of picking a lot of light songs, and were kind of struggling a little bit.

1004
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:47,340
[SPEAKER_18]: My only complaint about Ultramix Online is that, god damn, people keep picking the same damn songs.

1005
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Like the default song that comes up when you want to pick a song to battle against somebody is .59, right?

1006
01:21:54,665 --> 01:21:56,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Tengoku, if you want to call it that, too.

1007
01:21:56,847 --> 01:22:03,833
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the default song, and so, of course, like a million matches get started with that song because people don't know how to change it, and it's just kind of like, I'm so sick of this song.

1008
01:22:04,193 --> 01:22:12,279
[SPEAKER_18]: And then for some reason today, there was this one person, I swear to God, every match he or she created, I think it might have been a she, every match she was creating, Secret Rendezvous was her song.

1009
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:12,960
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, ugh.

1010
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,001
[SPEAKER_18]: It just kind of sucks because there's not a whole lot of people on Ultramix.

1011
01:22:17,021 --> 01:22:22,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually there's only a couple groups of people playing, so you're kind of stuck with whatever songs you can actually find.

1012
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you start off and pick something different?

1013
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:27,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, wow, it's not like every time you start a game with, do that thing!

1014
01:22:29,247 --> 01:22:30,168
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, now it's not true.

1015
01:22:30,288 --> 01:22:34,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Just today I played Shiny Disco Balls and DXY in games, okay?

1016
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:35,631
[SPEAKER_18]: So just, you know, shut your mouth.

1017
01:22:36,471 --> 01:22:37,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Woohoo, DXY.

1018
01:22:37,932 --> 01:22:39,212
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody else will pick do that thing.

1019
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,673
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to show do that thing a little love.

1020
01:22:40,793 --> 01:22:41,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody loves do that thing.

1021
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:44,643
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1022
01:22:45,745 --> 01:22:45,945
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

1023
01:22:46,065 --> 01:22:46,706
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you pointing at?

1024
01:22:48,087 --> 01:22:51,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Loki wants me to talk about this story, speaking of songs.

1025
01:22:52,152 --> 01:22:54,234
[SPEAKER_18]: We just posted this to our website.

1026
01:22:54,695 --> 01:22:58,939
[SPEAKER_18]: Even though this isn't directly Bimani-related, it's kind of Bimani-related.

1027
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,786
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the ladies from the Weather Girls, Izora Rhodes, she was one half of the Weather Girls, she died.

1028
01:23:05,406 --> 01:23:05,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's cool.

1029
01:23:05,726 --> 01:23:07,568
[SPEAKER_18]: It was from Bridget Jones' Diary, which had a pretty...

1030
01:23:34,099 --> 01:23:35,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty well-received soundtrack, from what I remember.

1031
01:23:40,025 --> 01:23:44,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Moment of silence, please, for one half of the Weather Girls, Yzora Rhodes.

1032
01:23:48,193 --> 01:23:49,334
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, there we go.

1033
01:23:50,915 --> 01:23:53,638
[SPEAKER_18]: And a little clip for us to remember.

1034
01:23:54,419 --> 01:23:54,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

1035
01:24:12,572 --> 01:24:13,533
[SPEAKER_04]: It's raining now

1036
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:40,817
[SPEAKER_18]: For every song like It's Raining Men, you get a song like Daikin Kai, which is kind of, you know, it's kind of rocking and mannish, I guess.

1037
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:43,199
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a very testosterone-y song, I think.

1038
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,022
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, I quit bitchin'.

1039
01:24:45,162 --> 01:24:46,503
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's all the taku stuff.

1040
01:24:47,204 --> 01:24:47,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1041
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:49,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Which makes me happy.

1042
01:24:50,087 --> 01:24:50,688
[SPEAKER_18]: So shut your mouth.

1043
01:24:51,823 --> 01:24:52,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you a hint.

1044
01:24:52,343 --> 01:24:55,826
[SPEAKER_08]: The Do That Thing video is kind of what clues you into the fact that that song's a little gay.

1045
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:55,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Tessa.

1046
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:30,902
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm being teased by the listeners.

1047
01:25:31,002 --> 01:25:31,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't like that.

1048
01:25:32,723 --> 01:25:38,426
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm supposed to be proving some kind of fake power over them, and I don't like being teased.

1049
01:25:38,606 --> 01:25:40,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, is your journalistic integrity being breached?

1050
01:25:41,087 --> 01:25:41,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1051
01:25:42,768 --> 01:25:45,070
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm being breached, and I don't like it.

1052
01:25:48,111 --> 01:25:49,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have more Bimani news.

1053
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:50,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, sure we do.

1054
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:54,006
[SPEAKER_18]: I was actually going to queue up the cage match, but if you want to talk... Okay, cage match.

1055
01:25:54,246 --> 01:25:55,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, let's do it more by my mind.

1056
01:25:55,566 --> 01:26:02,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Since you brought it up... You're the one talking about testosterone and bringing it up.

1057
01:26:02,108 --> 01:26:03,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Testosterony.

1058
01:26:04,829 --> 01:26:05,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Loki.

1059
01:26:06,109 --> 01:26:08,510
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to make a little side note here.

1060
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:13,851
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone's interested in looking for, like, a nice DDR pad, our friend at

1061
01:26:15,223 --> 01:26:21,910
[SPEAKER_16]: The local golf land is selling off his Solo 2000 arcade stage, if you want it.

1062
01:26:22,591 --> 01:26:22,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1063
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:23,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1064
01:26:24,653 --> 01:26:27,056
[SPEAKER_16]: So he's selling that for anybody that's interested.

1065
01:26:29,078 --> 01:26:30,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how you can get a hold of him.

1066
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:31,541
[SPEAKER_16]: He's on...

1067
01:26:32,028 --> 01:26:54,341
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Freak as Kundoggy, K-U-N-D-O-G-G-Y So just, um, you might be able to PM him and ask him The stage is fucking heavy, it is 200 pounds It's a real solo pad, I saw it in a pre-modified phase No, it hasn't been modified yet No, it hasn't been modified at all Yeah, he hasn't really done anything with it yet Just in case you're interested and have a lot of cash Do you have an idea of how much he's charging for it?

1068
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:59,084
[SPEAKER_18]: No I'll pay a dollar Put it on eBay

1069
01:26:59,938 --> 01:27:05,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, as long as you're doing miscellaneous Orange Honest Radio announcements, I do want to say happy birthday to our cam whore, Misty.

1070
01:27:05,882 --> 01:27:06,563
[SPEAKER_18]: It's her birthday today.

1071
01:27:07,023 --> 01:27:08,464
[SPEAKER_08]: We also had a weekend a few days ago.

1072
01:27:08,884 --> 01:27:09,305
[SPEAKER_08]: A weekend.

1073
01:27:10,065 --> 01:27:10,686
[SPEAKER_08]: A birthday.

1074
01:27:10,706 --> 01:27:11,847
[SPEAKER_08]: A few days ago.

1075
01:27:11,867 --> 01:27:13,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm horrible with birthdays.

1076
01:27:13,508 --> 01:27:14,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Shark's Girl.

1077
01:27:14,849 --> 01:27:16,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, Shark's Girl's birthday was a couple days ago.

1078
01:27:17,671 --> 01:27:20,012
[SPEAKER_18]: She got to go play with dolphins on her birthday.

1079
01:27:20,232 --> 01:27:20,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1080
01:27:21,013 --> 01:27:21,714
[SPEAKER_18]: That was very nice.

1081
01:27:21,754 --> 01:27:22,794
[SPEAKER_08]: They were so cute.

1082
01:27:23,014 --> 01:27:24,536
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to have her back on the show to talk about it.

1083
01:27:24,836 --> 01:27:24,976
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

1084
01:27:24,996 --> 01:27:25,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

1085
01:27:26,058 --> 01:27:26,338
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1086
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:28,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1087
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:32,342
[SPEAKER_18]: Bomani News, before we get to the cage match, since Jamie decided to delay the cage match here.

1088
01:27:33,143 --> 01:27:34,804
[SPEAKER_09]: You were the one who decided, okay?

1089
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:36,245
[SPEAKER_18]: I just like ruffling your feathers.

1090
01:27:37,145 --> 01:27:39,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Dance Mania EX8 is on the way out.

1091
01:27:39,367 --> 01:27:42,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, Dance Mania being the series that a lot of DDR songs come from.

1092
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:51,495
[SPEAKER_18]: Dance Mania EX8 is on the way, and it's going to have some lovely tracks on it, including... Oh.

1093
01:27:52,496 --> 01:27:54,377
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'll do the... God, it...

1094
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:57,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Distract the show here so I can do a ban

1095
01:28:17,013 --> 01:28:20,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Erotic with Gotta Get It Groovin', the remix of that's going to be on this CD.

1096
01:28:20,734 --> 01:28:22,094
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to think of other DDR bands, you know.

1097
01:28:22,595 --> 01:28:27,256
[SPEAKER_18]: 2 Unlimited, Maximum Overdrive, the Horny Horns vocal radio edit.

1098
01:28:27,316 --> 01:28:28,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Horny Horns.

1099
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:31,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's That Girl, doing a cover of Burnin' Up by Madonna.

1100
01:28:32,857 --> 01:28:40,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Extreme with Upside Jump, Atomic Kittens, going to do Ladies Night, which is actually... Yeah, with Curtis Mantronic doing a remix.

1101
01:28:40,959 --> 01:28:43,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is actually a previous Cage Match pick of ours.

1102
01:28:44,727 --> 01:28:45,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe.

1103
01:28:45,347 --> 01:28:48,189
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that remix is, but I know that song was, because I picked it.

1104
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:51,612
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was.

1105
01:28:51,652 --> 01:28:52,673
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell is that song?

1106
01:28:52,993 --> 01:28:55,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Strictly Business, I think.

1107
01:28:58,111 --> 01:29:01,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, we've got... I saw there was another one on here I want to mention.

1108
01:29:01,453 --> 01:29:02,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Wild Side.

1109
01:29:02,154 --> 01:29:02,734
[SPEAKER_18]: You know Wild Side.

1110
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:05,116
[SPEAKER_18]: They did Here's This Little Moment and My Sweet Darling.

1111
01:29:05,136 --> 01:29:06,597
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going to have Superstar.

1112
01:29:07,098 --> 01:29:13,002
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know if that has anything to do with any other versions of that song, but that's going to be on DanceMedia EX8.

1113
01:29:13,022 --> 01:29:13,943
[SPEAKER_18]: So look for that soon.

1114
01:29:14,143 --> 01:29:15,584
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you can't find it, that's all right.

1115
01:29:15,604 --> 01:29:16,205
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be speedy.

1116
01:29:16,545 --> 01:29:19,727
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll play it on Orange Laundry as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.

1117
01:29:20,408 --> 01:29:21,269
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who I miss?

1118
01:29:21,629 --> 01:29:21,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Who?

1119
01:29:22,309 --> 01:29:23,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I miss the Olivia Project.

1120
01:29:24,271 --> 01:29:24,711
[SPEAKER_19]: I do, too.

1121
01:29:24,771 --> 01:29:26,913
[SPEAKER_09]: All those lovely Olivia Newton-John, you know...

1122
01:29:27,853 --> 01:29:28,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1123
01:29:43,846 --> 01:29:44,706
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all home versions.

1124
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:50,189
[SPEAKER_18]: Which kind of reminds me of an important question I want to ask on our LiveJournal community later this week.

1125
01:29:50,649 --> 01:29:53,530
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you're not a member of our LiveJournal community, you should join it.

1126
01:29:53,751 --> 01:29:59,253
[SPEAKER_18]: www.livejournal.com and it's username orange lounge is our username.

1127
01:29:59,713 --> 01:30:07,997
[SPEAKER_18]: So for those of you guys that are on the LiveJournal, you sometimes get to see secret little posts and you get to be in the know on some things and you get reminded every Tuesday night to pump up the volume is on.

1128
01:30:08,413 --> 01:30:10,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because, well, okay.

1129
01:30:10,674 --> 01:30:12,495
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's a great promotional too, it really is.

1130
01:30:12,535 --> 01:30:14,516
[SPEAKER_18]: And people seem to like having the reminders.

1131
01:30:14,837 --> 01:30:18,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I usually post on there what the marathon's going to be in case people go, oh, that sucks.

1132
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:20,300
[SPEAKER_09]: But usually I don't want them to listen anyway.

1133
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:24,122
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit of a warning, what's going to be played.

1134
01:30:24,722 --> 01:30:25,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1135
01:30:25,162 --> 01:30:25,622
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cool.

1136
01:30:26,723 --> 01:30:28,184
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's a good way to keep tabs on what's going on.

1137
01:30:29,867 --> 01:30:37,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes there's a lot of things that they're not quite appropriate to be posted on the front page of our site, but they're things we want to kind of clue the fans in on.

1138
01:30:38,751 --> 01:30:42,153
[SPEAKER_24]: For a picture, rather than a compromising position, here's the link.

1139
01:30:43,214 --> 01:30:48,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1140
01:30:48,937 --> 01:30:57,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, Echo Image made its return to the cage match with a song called Come Back, and it was Loki's pick for the cage match.

1141
01:30:58,397 --> 01:30:59,498
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what, though?

1142
01:30:59,739 --> 01:31:04,043
[SPEAKER_18]: It may be a tricky night tonight because Shane, I noticed, quit out of our chat room earlier in the show.

1143
01:31:04,383 --> 01:31:07,406
[SPEAKER_18]: So he's not going to be here to persuade you all to vote for Echo Image.

1144
01:31:07,486 --> 01:31:10,209
[SPEAKER_18]: So, could be competitive tonight.

1145
01:31:10,569 --> 01:31:11,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Could be.

1146
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:17,336
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a lot of good songs tonight, but will an old favorite, or I should say a new old favorite of the show, will it win?

1147
01:31:17,396 --> 01:31:17,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knows?

1148
01:31:18,197 --> 01:31:19,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight's song number one.

1149
01:31:19,638 --> 01:31:21,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, the way the cage match works, you get to hear...

1150
01:31:22,262 --> 01:31:25,645
[SPEAKER_18]: 3 songs, you get to hear a clip of last week's winner and 2 new songs in their entirety.

1151
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:29,048
[SPEAKER_18]: The song that wins goes into rotation all week long on Orange Laundry.

1152
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:34,113
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the Monty Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we are not.

1153
01:31:35,215 --> 01:31:35,495
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1154
01:31:36,356 --> 01:31:36,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool?

1155
01:31:37,036 --> 01:31:37,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool!

1156
01:31:37,637 --> 01:31:39,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, here's a clip of last week's winner.

1157
01:31:39,178 --> 01:31:41,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Echo Image, song number 1 you can vote for tonight with Come Back.

1158
01:31:41,941 --> 01:31:42,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Come Back.

1159
01:32:04,324 --> 01:32:05,525
Thank you for watching!

1160
01:33:04,617 --> 01:33:05,578
Thanks for watching!

1161
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:25,791
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, song number one in the cage match with Echo Image with Comeback.

1162
01:33:25,811 --> 01:33:28,452
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, we're noticing that our chat room seems kind of dead tonight.

1163
01:33:30,132 --> 01:33:33,493
[SPEAKER_18]: We have just as many listeners as we usually do, but our chat room seems a little bit dead.

1164
01:33:33,513 --> 01:33:34,314
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there's a few people.

1165
01:33:34,354 --> 01:33:38,635
[SPEAKER_16]: That new show, that new drama that everyone's going to be talking about on Monday about Horny Housewives.

1166
01:33:38,715 --> 01:33:40,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, don't get me started.

1167
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:40,956
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we're trying to think.

1168
01:33:41,156 --> 01:33:45,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, seriously, that's what we think about, like, when the night seems kind of slow or a little bit dead.

1169
01:33:45,697 --> 01:33:47,538
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of like, is there something else going on tonight?

1170
01:33:47,578 --> 01:33:48,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, were the Oscars on tonight or something?

1171
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:53,865
[SPEAKER_18]: They're watching the news They're watching replays of the debate They're playing Silent Hill 4 I don't remember

1172
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,336
[SPEAKER_18]: You decided to go with an old favorite, too.

1173
01:34:11,376 --> 01:34:14,916
[SPEAKER_18]: You decided to use Loki's own tricks on him, and you went with an old favorite.

1174
01:34:14,936 --> 01:34:15,837
[SPEAKER_18]: You went with Enflo.

1175
01:34:16,037 --> 01:34:16,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1176
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:19,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I just picked a random Enflo song because I couldn't think of anything else.

1177
01:34:19,418 --> 01:34:22,639
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so here's the random Enflo song that Jamie decided on.

1178
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:23,739
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called You Said.

1179
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:26,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this from their Astro album?

1180
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,781
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's from... I don't remember the name of the album.

1181
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:31,641
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1182
01:34:31,761 --> 01:34:35,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's from the last one before the Astro Magic.

1183
01:34:36,585 --> 01:34:37,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, fair enough.

1184
01:34:37,266 --> 01:34:39,008
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, here it is for you guys to give it a try.

1185
01:34:39,709 --> 01:34:41,831
[SPEAKER_18]: See if you like this one enough to give it your vote tonight.

1186
01:34:41,891 --> 01:34:43,874
[SPEAKER_18]: It is MFlow with You Said.

1187
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:45,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's picking tonight's cage match.

1188
01:34:45,235 --> 01:34:45,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy!

1189
01:35:53,746 --> 01:35:55,507
Thank you for watching.

1190
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,507
See you next time.

1191
01:37:06,914 --> 01:37:08,135
Thank you for watching!

1192
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:22,389
Thank you for watching!

1193
01:39:25,689 --> 01:39:26,451
Thanks for watching!

1194
01:40:15,979 --> 01:40:20,023
[SPEAKER_18]: All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Mflow with You Said.

1195
01:40:20,463 --> 01:40:23,666
[SPEAKER_18]: And now we will say what we thought of that song, starting with Jamie.

1196
01:40:25,088 --> 01:40:25,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that song.

1197
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:32,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I was listening to some Mflow earlier today while I was doing my homework, and that song, I was just sort of like, huh.

1198
01:40:33,876 --> 01:40:34,337
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh,

1199
01:40:35,057 --> 01:40:46,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I give it an 8 overall, I mean, because it's good, it's solid, I mean... It just sort of stuck out in my head today, and it was better than what I was going to pick, because I don't think that many of our listeners would be quite prepared for Rammstein.

1200
01:40:47,007 --> 01:40:48,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Out of hell with what the listeners think.

1201
01:40:48,608 --> 01:40:49,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'll hit loser.

1202
01:40:49,469 --> 01:40:50,209
[SPEAKER_18]: It's our show.

1203
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:52,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Bradley, what'd you think?

1204
01:40:53,252 --> 01:40:53,792
[SPEAKER_17]: It was alright.

1205
01:40:54,253 --> 01:40:57,335
[SPEAKER_17]: I started liking it a little bit better as it went on, though, so I'll give it a 7.5.

1206
01:40:58,116 --> 01:40:58,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Loki?

1207
01:41:00,858 --> 01:41:01,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Lame.

1208
01:41:01,759 --> 01:41:02,519
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

1209
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:03,000
[SPEAKER_16]: It...

1210
01:41:03,519 --> 01:41:06,000
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked the other song much better, Astro Sexy.

1211
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:10,823
[SPEAKER_16]: This was not Astro Sexy, and I didn't like it, so it gets a 5.

1212
01:41:12,544 --> 01:41:16,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it kind of sounded like elevator music, but good elevator music.

1213
01:41:16,326 --> 01:41:19,288
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, like, I would hope that they would play that in an elevator someday while I'm in it.

1214
01:41:19,568 --> 01:41:20,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it was okay.

1215
01:41:20,628 --> 01:41:22,809
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a little bit long, but it was a pretty good song.

1216
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:24,771
[SPEAKER_18]: I listened to it, especially in an elevator.

1217
01:41:25,211 --> 01:41:26,812
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, I give it like a 7.5 as well, I think.

1218
01:41:26,832 --> 01:41:28,733
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm on the same page as Bradley.

1219
01:41:29,293 --> 01:41:32,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, uh, let's move on to song number 3 in tonight's cage match.

1220
01:41:34,286 --> 01:41:45,992
[SPEAKER_18]: I picked it, and it's by an artist called Karma Club, and I actually never heard of them until I just randomly downloaded this song on iTunes, but I was kind of like, huh, this kind of reminds me of, like, SmileDK, like, but American.

1221
01:41:46,192 --> 01:41:48,813
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Loki says he hates it already.

1222
01:41:48,873 --> 01:41:49,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you be the judge.

1223
01:41:50,654 --> 01:41:53,956
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a song called Lucky Star, and the group is Karma Club.

1224
01:41:54,016 --> 01:41:56,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy, it's my pick for tonight's game match.

1225
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:38,532
Thank you for watching!

1226
01:43:02,919 --> 01:43:09,924
Last night as I lay dreaming This strangest kind of feeling Revealed its secret meaning And now I know

1227
01:43:35,185 --> 01:43:36,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1228
01:44:28,925 --> 01:44:30,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1229
01:45:13,821 --> 01:45:37,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Na na na na na Na na na na na No matter where you are, you are my lucky star Na na na na na Na na na na na Na na na na na Na na na na na No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

1230
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:47,153
[SPEAKER_18]: It's too happy.

1231
01:45:47,213 --> 01:45:48,934
[SPEAKER_18]: I've heard it before.

1232
01:45:48,974 --> 01:45:49,515
[SPEAKER_18]: It gets extreme.

1233
01:46:18,095 --> 01:46:23,777
[SPEAKER_18]: It gets an S. It gets an S. All right.

1234
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:24,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Bradley.

1235
01:46:25,698 --> 01:46:29,459
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a generic pop song over a dance beat.

1236
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:29,459
5.5.

1237
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:30,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki.

1238
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:32,961
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just like, no.

1239
01:46:33,661 --> 01:46:33,861
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1240
01:46:34,481 --> 01:46:34,941
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1241
01:46:35,041 --> 01:46:35,982
[SPEAKER_16]: It gets a 1.

1242
01:46:36,182 --> 01:46:36,362
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1243
01:46:38,402 --> 01:46:40,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, I hope it wins extra bad now.

1244
01:46:40,683 --> 01:46:41,003
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1245
01:46:41,624 --> 01:46:42,464
[SPEAKER_18]: I give it like a...

1246
01:46:43,086 --> 01:46:46,187
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we just need to admit that Echo Image is going to win again.

1247
01:47:16,031 --> 01:47:22,355
[SPEAKER_18]: And song number two in tonight's cage match, Mflow with You Said.

1248
01:47:23,216 --> 01:47:28,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three in tonight's cage match was Lucky Star by Karma Club.

1249
01:47:55,457 --> 01:47:55,817
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1250
01:47:55,897 --> 01:47:58,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Place vote now in our chat room.

1251
01:47:58,818 --> 01:48:05,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote for either MFlow or Karma Club.

1252
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:06,960
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1253
01:48:08,121 --> 01:48:10,721
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll be looking for your votes there in our chat room.

1254
01:48:11,782 --> 01:48:12,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Meanwhile...

1255
01:48:14,190 --> 01:48:16,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my gosh, iTunes just crashed my whole damn computer.

1256
01:48:17,352 --> 01:48:21,374
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're, no, we're okay, we're still up, we're still up and running, but just iTunes crashed, it was kind of scary.

1257
01:48:22,035 --> 01:48:28,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, um, meanwhile, I noticed Loki's looking on a site about, that has to do with some other Bomani news that came out this week.

1258
01:48:29,419 --> 01:48:36,203
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess there's this guy, and he does a lot of music for other video games that I don't really play, but apparently a lot of you people know him, and he's kind of popular.

1259
01:48:36,263 --> 01:48:38,525
[SPEAKER_18]: His name's Jesper Kyd, K-Y-D, right?

1260
01:48:38,625 --> 01:48:38,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

1261
01:48:39,301 --> 01:48:42,562
[SPEAKER_18]: and he does a lot of songs for other video games.

1262
01:48:42,582 --> 01:48:44,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have a little clip of some Jesper Kidd songs here?

1263
01:48:45,182 --> 01:48:50,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Jesper Kidd has announced he's going to be doing three songs for DDR Ultramix 2, which is kind of nice.

1264
01:48:50,643 --> 01:48:55,704
[SPEAKER_18]: So, alright, we're trying to find a little clip of a Jesper Kidd song to play for you guys here.

1265
01:48:57,164 --> 01:48:59,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if we can get a little... Just anything.

1266
01:49:00,385 --> 01:49:02,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Just play us anything so we can get a feel for what this guy sounds like.

1267
01:49:07,106 --> 01:49:07,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh.

1268
01:49:07,326 --> 01:49:07,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh.

1269
01:49:11,069 --> 01:49:13,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, maybe we'll get that industrial music you've been looking for, Jamie.

1270
01:49:14,871 --> 01:49:18,432
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, stuff that's very similar to, like, Quake-type music, you know?

1271
01:49:18,492 --> 01:49:20,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Very, that dark industrial type stuff.

1272
01:49:20,753 --> 01:49:23,774
[SPEAKER_16]: This stuff right here is from Freedom Fighters, the game.

1273
01:49:23,814 --> 01:49:24,795
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the main theme.

1274
01:49:26,055 --> 01:49:27,136
[SPEAKER_16]: This is another fight for freedom.

1275
01:49:27,156 --> 01:49:27,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I want that.

1276
01:49:27,636 --> 01:49:28,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1277
01:49:37,392 --> 01:49:38,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, there's those.

1278
01:49:38,673 --> 01:49:42,616
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I was mentioning, or going to mention actually from his website here.

1279
01:49:42,716 --> 01:49:44,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me get to him again.

1280
01:49:46,078 --> 01:49:49,160
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to add real fast the three songs that he has announced for Ultramix 2.

1281
01:49:49,781 --> 01:49:51,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Istanbul Cafe is one.

1282
01:49:52,043 --> 01:49:53,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Red Room is another song.

1283
01:49:53,303 --> 01:49:57,947
[SPEAKER_18]: And then this other interesting one, 59 Kid Konami Mix.

1284
01:49:57,987 --> 01:50:00,669
[SPEAKER_18]: And kind of the question now is, is that a remix of .59?

1285
01:50:02,130 --> 01:50:02,550
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it is.

1286
01:50:03,311 --> 01:50:03,911
[SPEAKER_18]: And how do you know this?

1287
01:50:06,112 --> 01:50:07,112
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't say.

1288
01:50:08,112 --> 01:50:08,732
[SPEAKER_16]: But yes, it is.

1289
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:11,273
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't even know one way or the other.

1290
01:50:11,293 --> 01:50:13,873
[SPEAKER_18]: You know something I don't, then, because I didn't know if this was a remix or not.

1291
01:50:14,313 --> 01:50:20,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Because a certain person mentioned something about a, I don't know, .59 remix.

1292
01:50:22,915 --> 01:50:24,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, then I guess it is a .59 remix.

1293
01:50:24,855 --> 01:50:25,395
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't know!

1294
01:50:26,616 --> 01:50:29,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, hooray, we get a .59 remix by some random video game guy.

1295
01:50:29,796 --> 01:50:30,356
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll be fun.

1296
01:50:31,356 --> 01:50:31,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1297
01:50:32,657 --> 01:50:33,217
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't know?

1298
01:50:34,457 --> 01:50:34,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

1299
01:50:37,463 --> 01:50:37,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1300
01:50:39,705 --> 01:50:40,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1301
01:50:41,546 --> 01:50:43,368
[SPEAKER_18]: We will... What are we going to do?

1302
01:50:43,388 --> 01:50:44,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to take a break?

1303
01:50:44,228 --> 01:50:46,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to talk about more Bomani news, or what?

1304
01:50:47,491 --> 01:50:48,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's break stuff.

1305
01:50:48,812 --> 01:50:49,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's break stuff.

1306
01:50:49,552 --> 01:50:50,353
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, you know what?

1307
01:50:50,373 --> 01:50:51,674
[SPEAKER_18]: We did have a request.

1308
01:50:51,974 --> 01:50:54,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody wanted to hear that Jamilia song, Superstar.

1309
01:50:54,956 --> 01:50:55,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, somebody did.

1310
01:50:56,197 --> 01:50:57,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that was you, wasn't it?

1311
01:50:57,158 --> 01:50:58,739
[SPEAKER_24]: Somebody sitting in this big green chair.

1312
01:50:58,759 --> 01:50:59,300
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I thought.

1313
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:06,205
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think the other folks thought it was a good idea as well, so... We'll play that for you guys.

1314
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:12,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Um... No, we're not going to play Never Ending Story.

1315
01:51:12,827 --> 01:51:17,355
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to play, uh... We're going to play, uh... Where the hell is it?

1316
01:51:19,799 --> 01:51:20,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Where is it?

1317
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:20,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's in here.

1318
01:51:21,081 --> 01:51:21,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1319
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:25,031
[SPEAKER_18]: There it is.

1320
01:51:25,211 --> 01:51:25,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do this.

1321
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:27,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, this is great radio, you guys.

1322
01:51:27,154 --> 01:51:28,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

1323
01:51:28,115 --> 01:51:30,018
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually the full version because I don't have a DDR edit.

1324
01:51:30,659 --> 01:51:33,262
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you're going to be getting DDR Festival, you'll be playing this song.

1325
01:51:33,302 --> 01:51:37,387
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you're lucky enough to be getting the DDR Europe mixes, you've probably already been playing this song.

1326
01:51:37,447 --> 01:51:38,589
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Jumilia with Superstar.

1327
01:51:38,629 --> 01:51:40,812
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have the cage match winner when we come back from this.

1328
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:49,152
[SPEAKER_04]: People always talk about All the things they're wrong about Write it on a piece of paper

1329
01:52:12,864 --> 01:52:39,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a feeling I'll see you later There's something about this Let's keep it moving And if it's good, yes, just get something cooking Cause I really wanna rock with you I'm feeling some connection to the things you do I don't know what it is That makes me feel like this I don't know who you are

1335
01:55:19,955 --> 01:55:22,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Oops, that's what I get for not queuing a promo up after that.

1336
01:55:22,075 --> 01:55:24,776
[SPEAKER_18]: We just come back cold right there after that song.

1337
01:55:24,836 --> 01:55:25,476
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamelia with Superstar.

01:55:26,496 --> 01:55:26,816
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1340
01:55:27,817 --> 01:55:31,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to Orange Challenge Radio or not.

1341
01:55:33,518 --> 01:55:33,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Lovely.

1342
01:55:34,118 --> 01:55:34,978
[SPEAKER_18]: It was very lovely.

1343
01:55:35,038 --> 01:55:35,838
[SPEAKER_18]: I enjoyed that very much.

1344
01:55:37,058 --> 01:55:38,278
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1345
01:55:38,318 --> 01:55:39,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Better, better, better one.

1346
01:55:39,259 --> 01:55:39,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1347
01:55:39,799 --> 01:55:42,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to Orange Challenge Radio or I'll put fire ants in your shoes.

1348
01:55:43,419 --> 01:55:44,240
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, that's a good one.

1349
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:45,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1350
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:45,880
[SPEAKER_18]: I love that.

1351
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:46,280
[SPEAKER_18]: That was nice.

1352
01:55:46,741 --> 01:55:52,148
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we're back and it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1353
01:55:53,650 --> 01:55:59,518
[SPEAKER_18]: And in tonight's cage match, boys and girls, it's a big surprise, a huge surprise.

1354
01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:02,391
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1355
01:56:24,048 --> 01:56:27,131
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a tie in tonight's cage match, believe it or not.

1356
01:56:27,771 --> 01:56:33,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Which means someone's going to be breaking the tie, so let's find out what two songs the tie is between.

1357
01:56:33,836 --> 01:56:44,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one is... Echo Image.

1358
01:56:46,547 --> 01:56:49,589
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is song number one that is tied in tonight's cage match.

1359
01:56:49,629 --> 01:56:52,752
[SPEAKER_18]: And song number two that is tied in tonight's cage match...

1360
01:56:54,745 --> 01:56:55,925
[SPEAKER_18]: is Lucky Star.

1361
01:56:59,486 --> 01:57:01,326
[SPEAKER_09]: So... A bunch of Enflo haters.

1362
01:57:01,746 --> 01:57:05,367
[SPEAKER_18]: That means, yes, unfortunately, Enflo not feeling the love tonight.

1363
01:57:05,427 --> 01:57:08,668
[SPEAKER_18]: But somebody better be feeling the love from Jamie pretty soon here.

1364
01:57:09,408 --> 01:57:10,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's got to break the tie.

1365
01:57:10,448 --> 01:57:17,250
[SPEAKER_18]: The Orange Lounge rules state that when there is a tie in the cage match, the host who didn't end up in the tie gets to break the tie.

1366
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:18,030
[SPEAKER_18]: And, Jamie?

1367
01:57:19,210 --> 01:57:20,390
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on who's going to pay me.

1368
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:22,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I accept bribes, you know.

1369
01:57:23,511 --> 01:57:24,311
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll show you my boob.

1370
01:57:25,253 --> 01:57:25,833
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1371
01:57:27,714 --> 01:57:28,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1372
01:57:28,275 --> 01:57:29,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane, who should I pick?

1373
01:57:31,096 --> 01:57:32,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what he's going to say.

1374
01:57:34,438 --> 01:57:36,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you want to get something new in there for once?

1375
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:41,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Aren't we a little sick, Echo?

1376
01:57:41,641 --> 01:57:43,582
[SPEAKER_09]: We just don't like happy poppy trees.

1377
01:57:45,103 --> 01:57:45,903
[SPEAKER_18]: But look at it this way.

1378
01:57:45,943 --> 01:57:47,084
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll lose next week for sure.

1379
01:57:50,782 --> 01:57:58,446
[SPEAKER_09]: See, if Echo Image wins again, then I can put in Rammstein and blow out everybody's speakers, and that would win.

1380
01:58:00,967 --> 01:58:01,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you really want Rob to win?

1381
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:04,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, too bad, you won.

1382
01:58:08,471 --> 01:58:11,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, reverse, alright, fine, then buy a tie vote.

1383
01:58:11,433 --> 01:58:13,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I did it for Shane, okay?

1384
01:58:14,174 --> 01:58:16,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I did it because Shane is my dunk fan.

1385
01:58:17,762 --> 01:58:18,102
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1386
01:58:18,122 --> 01:58:18,942
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my dunk buddy.

1387
01:58:18,962 --> 01:58:20,263
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a good cliffhanger, Jamie.

1388
01:58:20,523 --> 01:58:21,563
[SPEAKER_18]: I applaud you for that one.

1389
01:58:21,723 --> 01:58:22,823
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because I'm awesome.

1390
01:58:23,623 --> 01:58:25,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody wishes they were cool like me.

1391
01:58:25,324 --> 01:58:26,644
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1392
01:58:26,784 --> 01:58:30,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Echo Image wins a nice cage match by a whopping... Oh, that's so sweet.

1393
01:58:32,325 --> 01:58:34,245
[SPEAKER_18]: You had their hearts racing for a minute there.

1394
01:58:38,046 --> 01:58:44,448
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what's going to happen the minute that that song gets bumped out of the cage match is that somebody's going to put in that never-ending story make.

1395
01:58:44,468 --> 01:58:46,168
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll have Echo Image for the rest of our lives.

1396
01:58:47,932 --> 01:58:49,833
[SPEAKER_18]: I already know Loki's planning on doing it.

1397
01:58:51,234 --> 01:58:51,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Liar.

1398
01:58:53,596 --> 01:58:54,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1399
01:58:56,197 --> 01:58:57,078
[SPEAKER_18]: More Bomani news.

1400
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,160
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a couple other Bomani games.

1401
01:58:59,741 --> 01:59:01,181
[SPEAKER_18]: They've kind of slipped under the cracks.

1402
01:59:01,221 --> 01:59:03,621
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't talked about them a whole lot.

1403
01:59:03,681 --> 01:59:06,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Tokyo Game Show happened this last week.

1404
01:59:06,462 --> 01:59:07,802
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about DDR Festival.

1405
01:59:07,902 --> 01:59:09,303
[SPEAKER_18]: They had a new movie that showed there.

1406
01:59:09,423 --> 01:59:10,963
[SPEAKER_18]: It showed the character customization.

1407
01:59:10,983 --> 01:59:13,144
[SPEAKER_18]: It showed us a little more what was going on with DDR Festival.

1408
01:59:13,924 --> 01:59:21,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Also coming out was some more information on Poppin' Music and Beatmania 2DX.

1409
01:59:21,566 --> 01:59:26,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Apparently they had some folks that were actually doing a performance there at Tokyo Game Show.

1410
01:59:26,943 --> 01:59:27,384
[SPEAKER_18]: VJTA-K Slake

1411
01:59:49,031 --> 01:59:56,995
[SPEAKER_18]: and LED vs. Slake was performing, which kind of gives you a hint that, gee, I wonder if there's going to be an 8th consumer style song like that.

1412
01:59:57,656 --> 02:00:04,059
[SPEAKER_18]: And, let's see, there was a song called Human Scramble from the anime A Human Crossing.

1413
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:11,202
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess it was something performed by Aki Asahina.

1414
02:00:14,124 --> 02:00:14,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1415
02:00:15,064 --> 02:00:15,725
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm so white.

1416
02:00:15,765 --> 02:00:16,925
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, boys and girls.

1417
02:00:17,766 --> 02:00:18,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Try that.

1418
02:00:18,948 --> 02:00:21,449
[SPEAKER_18]: Aki Asahina No, I'm going to have the 8th style

1419
02:00:38,311 --> 02:00:45,997
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a group called Guzzle that performed, and they did a song called The Bottom of Same Sky and a song called Egoist, which is going to be in Poppin' Music 10.

1420
02:00:46,978 --> 02:00:51,182
[SPEAKER_18]: And the full version of Egoist is going to show up on the Poppin' Music 10 Limited Edition.

1421
02:00:51,742 --> 02:00:57,787
[SPEAKER_18]: So lots of fun news there for Poppin' Music 10 and 2DX8 style as well.

1422
02:00:57,847 --> 02:01:04,433
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Sana and Togo were there, and they performed a song called Custom Made Girl Not For Sale.

1423
02:01:05,543 --> 02:01:06,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Dude, that's awesome.

1424
02:01:06,664 --> 02:01:07,886
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the best song name ever.

1425
02:01:07,966 --> 02:01:12,051
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds very much like a poppin' music song, but we don't really know which way it's going yet.

1426
02:01:12,712 --> 02:01:17,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And then a song called Everyday Lovely Day, which is going to be on the Poppin' Music 10 consumer style.

1427
02:01:17,838 --> 02:01:22,064
[SPEAKER_18]: And then a remixed version by LED is going to be in 2DX8 style.

1428
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:31,900
[SPEAKER_18]: So lots of new stuff coming out on these two soundtracks, Poppin' Music 10 and 2DXA Style, as well as in the games that are coming out November 18th.

1429
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,800
[SPEAKER_09]: We love LED.

1430
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:33,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1431
02:01:34,021 --> 02:01:35,782
[SPEAKER_09]: We love LED and groovy.

1432
02:01:36,743 --> 02:01:38,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Why does this stuff all have to come out at the same time?

1433
02:01:38,824 --> 02:01:39,344
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the problem.

1434
02:01:39,364 --> 02:01:40,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I got no money.

1435
02:01:40,165 --> 02:01:40,605
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Poe.

1436
02:01:41,005 --> 02:01:44,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they want to get as much money from us as possible.

1437
02:01:44,147 --> 02:01:45,488
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to suck us dry.

1438
02:01:45,949 --> 02:01:46,429
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess so.

1439
02:01:46,589 --> 02:01:50,132
[SPEAKER_09]: They want all of our money to belong to Konami of Japan.

1440
02:01:51,233 --> 02:01:51,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess so.

1441
02:01:52,113 --> 02:01:52,954
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a corporate plot.

1442
02:01:54,215 --> 02:01:54,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Conspiracy.

1443
02:01:55,916 --> 02:02:01,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know that K-Set's using all the money to build a giant robot.

1444
02:02:01,701 --> 02:02:02,941
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using it to build Metal Gear.

1445
02:02:03,822 --> 02:02:04,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1446
02:02:06,084 --> 02:02:06,624
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1447
02:02:08,045 --> 02:02:09,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, okay.

1448
02:02:09,226 --> 02:02:10,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, gotcha.

1449
02:02:12,209 --> 02:02:13,670
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to think of any other Bomani news.

1450
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:18,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I'm going to go over to Loki, since we haven't heard from him in a little bit, and ask Loki, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

1451
02:02:19,912 --> 02:02:20,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Surely there must be something.

1452
02:02:21,912 --> 02:02:22,873
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure there is.

1453
02:02:24,453 --> 02:02:25,413
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what that is.

1454
02:02:26,634 --> 02:02:27,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me look.

1455
02:02:28,246 --> 02:02:35,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, other than TDR Maniacs being fucking slow as hell, let's see here.

1456
02:02:35,854 --> 02:02:46,865
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I mentioned last week that Alpha 24 came out, not that anyone cares why they're up to Alpha 24 is beyond me, but they are, so, yeah.

1457
02:02:47,766 --> 02:02:47,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

1458
02:02:48,905 --> 02:02:53,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, there's a poll, I think, still going on for what characters should be ripped next.

1459
02:02:54,308 --> 02:02:58,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Since the 5th Mix character is almost completely ripped for use with Step Mania.

1460
02:02:59,230 --> 02:03:01,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Some themes are being worked on right now.

1461
02:03:01,211 --> 02:03:06,114
[SPEAKER_16]: The DDR9 Red, which is obviously a rip-off of 2DX Red's theme.

1462
02:03:06,734 --> 02:03:11,797
[SPEAKER_16]: And Transmakina 5, which a lot of people that are out there in the sim world know about.

1463
02:03:13,038 --> 02:03:13,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Also...

1464
02:03:14,708 --> 02:03:18,271
[SPEAKER_16]: There's, of course, Technofiend still being worked on.

1465
02:03:18,471 --> 02:03:19,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Really nice right now.

1466
02:03:20,473 --> 02:03:22,194
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, that's just basic theme stuff.

1467
02:03:22,855 --> 02:03:33,463
[SPEAKER_16]: DDRUK will have Ultramix Pack 6 and the DDR Extreme US tracks as soon as their downloads come back up.

1468
02:03:34,484 --> 02:03:36,526
[SPEAKER_16]: The Extreme tracks, I know, are almost done.

1469
02:03:36,626 --> 02:03:38,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultramix Pack 6 are done.

1470
02:03:38,427 --> 02:03:40,289
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just waiting to be uploaded or...

1471
02:03:41,395 --> 02:03:42,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't fire them!

1472
02:03:42,195 --> 02:03:50,057
[SPEAKER_16]: I never hold a remix contest I'd say I'd have a few judges and they would have to be local so I can yell at them

1473
02:04:11,021 --> 02:04:14,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Fire the goddamn judges and set some deadlines next time.

1474
02:04:14,364 --> 02:04:15,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

1475
02:04:15,145 --> 02:04:17,367
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, sorry, but, you know.

1476
02:04:17,647 --> 02:04:22,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, they also had their server thing where they got a new server recently, so, you know, there's that.

1477
02:04:22,731 --> 02:04:24,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, alright, alright.

1478
02:04:25,194 --> 02:04:25,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine, whatever.

1479
02:04:25,994 --> 02:04:27,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Beggars can't be choosers, I guess.

1480
02:04:27,636 --> 02:04:28,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can.

1481
02:04:29,858 --> 02:04:31,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Any exciting remixes, though?

1482
02:04:31,319 --> 02:04:33,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you played some of them a couple weeks ago when I wasn't here, huh?

1483
02:04:34,082 --> 02:04:34,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, alright.

1484
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:40,594
[SPEAKER_18]: I just found out, just, just found out just now, there's a good chance I'm not going to be here next week.

1485
02:04:41,554 --> 02:04:41,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1486
02:04:42,255 --> 02:04:43,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, something's going on.

1487
02:04:43,797 --> 02:04:44,357
[SPEAKER_18]: You know about it.

1488
02:04:45,939 --> 02:04:46,559
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you playing?

1489
02:04:48,421 --> 02:04:49,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, way to go.

1490
02:04:50,043 --> 02:04:54,527
[SPEAKER_18]: There's something going on, I'll tell you off air, but you actually already know about it, you just probably forgot it was next Sunday.

1491
02:04:54,708 --> 02:04:54,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1492
02:04:54,888 --> 02:04:55,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1493
02:04:58,226 --> 02:04:59,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, now she makes O-Face.

1494
02:04:59,527 --> 02:05:00,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes.

1495
02:05:00,187 --> 02:05:01,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I may not be here either.

1496
02:05:02,449 --> 02:05:05,690
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll probably have a pre-taped show next week for you guys.

1497
02:05:05,710 --> 02:05:08,352
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to go to Golfland and do a show again.

1498
02:05:08,552 --> 02:05:10,653
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I kind of want to do a show from the ghetto.

1499
02:05:11,573 --> 02:05:12,654
[SPEAKER_09]: That means going to Scandia.

1500
02:05:12,694 --> 02:05:14,575
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be fun, to do a show from the ghetto.

1501
02:05:15,335 --> 02:05:16,456
[SPEAKER_09]: In the ghetto.

1502
02:05:16,796 --> 02:05:17,196
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1503
02:05:18,497 --> 02:05:19,417
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1504
02:05:19,457 --> 02:05:22,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that our last one we did at Golfland was funny when they almost threw us out.

1505
02:05:22,739 --> 02:05:23,640
[SPEAKER_18]: That was pretty funny.

1506
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:24,280
[SPEAKER_18]: I would kind of...

1507
02:05:26,623 --> 02:05:28,505
[SPEAKER_09]: until we said, but we're promoting you.

1508
02:05:28,565 --> 02:05:29,286
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good idea.

1509
02:05:29,326 --> 02:05:33,650
[SPEAKER_18]: We could go to Golf Line and play the new Step Mania machine, although I hear it kind of sucks, and that's not Loki's fault.

1510
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:35,412
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just the fact that the computer inside sucks.

1511
02:05:37,534 --> 02:05:45,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the only way it sucks is the fact that it has a default skin with no movies, but other than that, the pads do suck, and that's not my fault at all.

1512
02:05:45,161 --> 02:05:46,723
[SPEAKER_16]: That's their shit, you know.

1513
02:05:47,583 --> 02:05:53,128
[SPEAKER_16]: I tried, hey, my original computer specifications worked very well with video and all that shit.

1514
02:05:53,448 --> 02:05:59,073
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, you know what, when someone else does the job for you, it just doesn't quite come out how you wanted it.

1515
02:06:01,475 --> 02:06:05,559
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I just don't care because I wasn't going to spend any more time nor money on that.

1516
02:06:05,959 --> 02:06:15,187
[SPEAKER_16]: However, what has come to my attention, and I plan on doing this, I have to come up with $200 though, is, um, apparently...

1517
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:17,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Channel Beat's having a sale.

1518
02:06:19,053 --> 02:06:19,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

1519
02:06:19,974 --> 02:06:20,735
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what that means?

1520
02:06:21,015 --> 02:06:24,099
[SPEAKER_16]: That means I get my parts for my cabinet.

1521
02:06:24,820 --> 02:06:28,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Those parts being my Dance Maniac sensors, which drop from $59 a piece to $29 a piece.

1522
02:06:29,706 --> 02:06:30,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

1523
02:06:34,981 --> 02:06:39,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Arcade Perfect, Dance Maniac Sensors, and all the other shit.

1524
02:06:39,363 --> 02:06:43,926
[SPEAKER_16]: I just have to figure out if I can use those sensors or not, because I don't know if it connects to an Airface board.

1525
02:06:45,246 --> 02:06:46,867
[SPEAKER_09]: You can always make modifications for Airface.

1526
02:06:46,887 --> 02:06:48,868
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure I could get to work.

1527
02:06:50,409 --> 02:06:53,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Break out a ballpoint pen and some paper clips.

1528
02:06:53,831 --> 02:06:59,254
[SPEAKER_16]: What I found out that's very interesting, and it does tie in with Step Mania...

1529
02:06:59,915 --> 02:07:02,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Stepmania's license agreement, basically.

1530
02:07:02,637 --> 02:07:09,462
[SPEAKER_16]: You can take Stepmania, modify it how you want, as far as theme, whatever.

1531
02:07:09,742 --> 02:07:11,043
[SPEAKER_16]: Put your own songs in it.

1532
02:07:12,324 --> 02:07:13,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Create your own theme.

1533
02:07:14,245 --> 02:07:15,146
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can sell it.

1534
02:07:15,586 --> 02:07:16,927
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can make money off of it.

1535
02:07:17,448 --> 02:07:20,410
[SPEAKER_16]: And all you have to do is just say, powered by Stepmania or whatever.

1536
02:07:21,431 --> 02:07:22,131
[SPEAKER_16]: That got me thinking.

1537
02:07:22,431 --> 02:07:24,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Wouldn't that be cool to make a new arcade game?

1538
02:07:26,494 --> 02:07:26,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1539
02:07:27,075 --> 02:07:27,375
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1540
02:07:27,944 --> 02:07:30,166
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make something like Dance Maniacs.

1541
02:07:30,286 --> 02:07:33,748
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to at least do it for my cabinet itself.

1542
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:35,169
[SPEAKER_09]: The waving the hands game.

1543
02:07:35,409 --> 02:07:41,793
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I want to do something across with Dance Maniacs and... Is it like Technomotion?

1544
02:07:41,893 --> 02:07:43,954
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not necessarily like Technomotion.

1545
02:07:44,014 --> 02:07:52,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Dance Maniacs and Para Para, which basically would be... It would sort of be like Para Para, but it would have top and bottom sensors in a way.

1546
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:53,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Make the country line dancing game.

1547
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:55,681
[SPEAKER_16]: No, God, you're getting line dancing.

1548
02:07:55,701 --> 02:07:56,422
[SPEAKER_16]: That's retarded.

1549
02:07:56,742 --> 02:08:03,503
[SPEAKER_16]: What I want to do, though, is I want to have infrared sensors, because you can actually do some sensors where they have different trigger points, you know, below a certain level.

1550
02:08:03,623 --> 02:08:06,404
[SPEAKER_16]: So I basically have, like, you know, up to waist, high, or whatever.

1551
02:08:06,744 --> 02:08:19,387
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be one set of five sensors, and then above that would be another set, but without those stupid, you know, actual things in front of you, so you don't keep hitting them with your hand, and then have, you know, cool, like, techno trance stuff to go with it.

1552
02:08:19,767 --> 02:08:20,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Do mocap dance.

1553
02:08:21,423 --> 02:08:31,534
[SPEAKER_16]: and be awesome but that's what I want to do at least but who knows I just have to see because I have the only problem with the buy enough channel beat you have to spend a $200 minimum ouch

1554
02:08:33,993 --> 02:08:54,345
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I can buy the Dance Maniac sensors, that's gonna be about, you know, say I buy three, or no, four of them, that's gonna be, you know, a good, you know, $120, and I still have $80 left that I have to spend on that, so I can maybe buy another sensor and some miscellaneous crap, and then, you know, maybe set up this weird dance thing or whatever.

1555
02:08:56,106 --> 02:08:57,186
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, I don't know.

1556
02:08:58,447 --> 02:09:00,548
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it'd be cool, but, you know, what do I know?

1557
02:09:02,229 --> 02:09:03,350
[SPEAKER_09]: You could buy a turntable.

1558
02:09:04,818 --> 02:09:11,363
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't buy turntables off there, and I would buy the turntables to RK Perfect Blends if they sold them, but they don't, and that pisses me off.

1559
02:09:11,423 --> 02:09:21,210
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, where the fuck, if something breaks on your Bomani cabinet, or whatever, where the fuck do you buy the parts that aren't listed on Channel B?

1560
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:22,130
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I want to know.

1561
02:09:22,350 --> 02:09:27,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that a lot of them, you have to order them from the Japanese distributors, like from Konami.

1562
02:09:27,714 --> 02:09:31,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I want to order the exact turntable parts.

1563
02:09:34,085 --> 02:09:34,505
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

1564
02:10:00,109 --> 02:10:00,490
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1565
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:01,711
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll just see.

1566
02:10:01,871 --> 02:10:03,614
[SPEAKER_16]: I just need to finish my cabinet first.

1567
02:10:04,054 --> 02:10:06,637
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to stop taking on extra projects.

1568
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:10,462
[SPEAKER_16]: See, the problem is right now... Well, I'm focusing.

1569
02:10:10,963 --> 02:10:12,405
[SPEAKER_16]: My fucking iPack's broken.

1570
02:10:12,465 --> 02:10:17,431
[SPEAKER_16]: My old iPack 2 is broken, I think, because it's been flipping out weird when I hook up the...

1571
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:42,502
[SPEAKER_16]: DancePads to it, and so I bought a new one that's coming, uh, IPAC, uh, what is it, Value Edition V or something like that, which, oddly enough, has more sensors, um, than, uh, the IPAC 2, and it's USB only, but I'm, that's coming this week, and so once I get that, then I'll be able to work on my cabinet again, because... I think that you need to open your gate to hell.

1572
02:10:45,031 --> 02:10:46,233
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to do that later.

1573
02:10:46,393 --> 02:10:49,717
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to finish that too, but I need to get this stuff done.

1574
02:10:49,998 --> 02:10:58,449
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to get my cabinet stuff done because the weather is going to be turning for the worse and I won't be able to work on it during the winter because it's raining like a bitch and I have my wood.

1575
02:10:58,469 --> 02:11:02,895
[SPEAKER_16]: So what I want to do is I want to fucking sit down, get a friend to help me, and just

1576
02:11:03,348 --> 02:11:11,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Chop up all that wood that I've got out there to like, you know, nice two foot by four foot sections so I can actually, you know, finish that.

1577
02:11:12,614 --> 02:11:15,055
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we're not calling it Loki motion because that's retarded.

1578
02:11:16,116 --> 02:11:16,776
[SPEAKER_24]: I liked it.

1579
02:11:17,296 --> 02:11:18,317
[SPEAKER_24]: That was cute.

1580
02:11:18,777 --> 02:11:20,138
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cute, but it's retarded.

1581
02:11:20,618 --> 02:11:21,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki motion.

1582
02:11:21,979 --> 02:11:22,760
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki motion.

1583
02:11:25,321 --> 02:11:26,282
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw my comment.

1584
02:11:26,322 --> 02:11:27,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too Kylie.

1585
02:11:30,064 --> 02:11:31,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, I'm done.

1586
02:11:32,358 --> 02:11:33,880
[SPEAKER_16]: So, what else are we going to talk about?

1587
02:11:33,940 --> 02:11:35,121
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to get pissed off.

1588
02:11:35,201 --> 02:11:35,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1589
02:11:36,983 --> 02:11:40,066
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to ask for a minute, what the fuck is wrong with everybody tonight?

1590
02:11:40,126 --> 02:11:43,609
[SPEAKER_18]: And not you guys, but I'm like, God, it's like, is it something in the air?

1591
02:11:43,809 --> 02:11:45,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Is everybody on their period?

1592
02:11:45,331 --> 02:11:46,412
[SPEAKER_18]: What is going on tonight?

1593
02:11:46,933 --> 02:11:49,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, it's just like, everything is dead tonight.

1594
02:11:49,896 --> 02:11:53,179
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, are we being invaded by aliens?

1595
02:11:53,299 --> 02:11:54,100
[SPEAKER_19]: What is going on?

1596
02:11:55,621 --> 02:11:56,622
[SPEAKER_19]: Is our show old?

1597
02:11:56,982 --> 02:11:58,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Have we jumped the shark?

1598
02:11:58,603 --> 02:12:00,123
[SPEAKER_09]: We did not jump the shark, okay?

1599
02:12:00,143 --> 02:12:02,825
[SPEAKER_09]: If we were going to jump the shark, it would have been when we let Loki sing.

1600
02:12:03,965 --> 02:12:04,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree.

1601
02:12:09,808 --> 02:12:10,868
[SPEAKER_18]: People need to wake up.

1602
02:12:12,349 --> 02:12:12,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

1603
02:12:13,809 --> 02:12:15,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sleepy too, Rob.

1604
02:12:15,610 --> 02:12:16,150
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

1605
02:12:16,911 --> 02:12:21,713
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying everybody's dead, but it's just like, God, I mean, seriously, tonight's kind of like deader than usual.

1606
02:12:21,753 --> 02:12:21,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1607
02:12:22,926 --> 02:12:24,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1608
02:12:24,928 --> 02:12:25,668
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

1609
02:12:26,969 --> 02:12:28,630
[SPEAKER_18]: I know just the thing to perk people up.

1610
02:12:28,730 --> 02:12:30,131
[SPEAKER_18]: I know just the thing.

1611
02:12:30,271 --> 02:12:31,331
[SPEAKER_18]: I know just the thing.

1612
02:12:31,392 --> 02:12:31,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob.

1613
02:12:31,812 --> 02:12:35,774
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all.

1614
02:12:36,194 --> 02:12:37,015
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me feel better.

1615
02:12:39,136 --> 02:12:44,940
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like a schoolgirl combined with Dr. Evil, but you know.

1616
02:12:46,521 --> 02:12:48,882
[SPEAKER_24]: It's very cute, Rob.

1617
02:12:49,363 --> 02:12:49,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cute.

1618
02:12:50,956 --> 02:12:56,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Some people are saying that they're trying to call us and they can't get through because I'm being a bitch and haven't opened the Skype line, huh?

1619
02:12:57,479 --> 02:13:00,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I turned it off, but I turned it back on just now, so that's fine.

1620
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:08,183
[SPEAKER_18]: If somebody wants to call us and tell us that, you know... If someone wants to pick up the pace a little bit... Call us or we'll play Let Them Move.

1621
02:13:08,283 --> 02:13:08,783
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we will not.

1622
02:13:09,063 --> 02:13:10,884
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I wouldn't even do that.

1623
02:13:11,404 --> 02:13:16,066
[SPEAKER_18]: I would do that if, like, nobody was... I don't know, if I really wasn't getting something my way.

1624
02:13:16,086 --> 02:13:16,466
[SPEAKER_09]: The 1-900-HOT-POOP.

1625
02:13:21,128 --> 02:13:22,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yay, we're getting a call.

1626
02:13:22,189 --> 02:13:22,810
[SPEAKER_18]: See, that's how it works.

1627
02:13:23,130 --> 02:13:24,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, you're on Orange Ones Radio.

1628
02:13:25,192 --> 02:13:25,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1629
02:13:25,913 --> 02:13:26,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

1630
02:13:26,413 --> 02:13:26,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

1631
02:13:27,494 --> 02:13:28,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1632
02:13:28,996 --> 02:13:29,596
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

1633
02:13:30,257 --> 02:13:34,461
[SPEAKER_07]: If I try to turn it down on the 365, it turns everything else down.

1634
02:13:35,261 --> 02:13:35,622
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-oh.

1635
02:13:36,743 --> 02:13:39,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So, see, if I mute it, then it mutes you guys.

1636
02:13:40,186 --> 02:13:40,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

1637
02:13:40,446 --> 02:13:42,208
[SPEAKER_07]: So I suppose maybe I should just stop it?

1638
02:13:43,769 --> 02:13:44,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear us okay?

1639
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:44,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1640
02:13:45,151 --> 02:13:46,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can hear you guys now.

1641
02:13:46,592 --> 02:13:47,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

1642
02:13:47,112 --> 02:13:47,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1643
02:13:47,532 --> 02:13:48,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we can hear you fine.

1644
02:13:48,393 --> 02:13:51,154
[SPEAKER_18]: You're like one of the most clear callers we've ever had call the show.

1645
02:13:51,754 --> 02:13:52,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

1646
02:13:52,275 --> 02:13:56,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just got my headset a couple days ago.

1647
02:13:56,257 --> 02:13:58,198
[SPEAKER_07]: So I finally decided to call and say hello.

1648
02:13:58,298 --> 02:13:59,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Kudos to your internet connection.

1649
02:13:59,779 --> 02:14:00,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Now tell us who you are.

1650
02:14:01,119 --> 02:14:01,980
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Raichan.

1651
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:02,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Raichan!

1652
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:03,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi!

1653
02:14:03,981 --> 02:14:04,721
[SPEAKER_18]: A new caller.

1654
02:14:04,841 --> 02:14:06,562
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't get a lot of girls calling the show.

1655
02:14:07,022 --> 02:14:08,223
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm glad that Raichan could call.

1656
02:14:08,243 --> 02:14:11,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we had Misty, and I think Irene called a few while back.

1657
02:14:11,264 --> 02:14:13,145
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, we don't get a whole lot in comparison.

1658
02:14:13,526 --> 02:14:14,226
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's up, Raichan?

1659
02:14:14,907 --> 02:14:15,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, not a whole lot.

1660
02:14:15,708 --> 02:14:18,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to call you guys before, just as you guys went to the break.

1661
02:14:19,271 --> 02:14:22,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, when we were talking about DDR Festival and Quad Mode and all that stuff.

1662
02:14:23,134 --> 02:14:23,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1663
02:14:23,794 --> 02:14:24,375
[SPEAKER_18]: What was on your mind?

1664
02:14:25,195 --> 02:14:28,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just the whole, I'm one of those import only.

1665
02:14:28,478 --> 02:14:30,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have US versions at all.

1666
02:14:30,319 --> 02:14:31,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any reason for that?

1667
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:38,986
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it just because you bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 first and then... Two years ago, when my first boyfriend and I broke up.

1668
02:14:39,447 --> 02:14:39,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-huh.

1669
02:14:40,341 --> 02:14:45,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I had him, he owed me money, so I bought a Japanese PS2 with what he owed me.

1670
02:14:45,264 --> 02:14:45,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, you know what?

1671
02:14:46,385 --> 02:14:52,209
[SPEAKER_18]: I inherited a 3rd and 4th style out of a previous relationship, so isn't that the best way to get new stuff?

1672
02:14:52,909 --> 02:14:53,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

1673
02:14:55,511 --> 02:14:57,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of my DDRs actually do come from other people.

1674
02:14:59,093 --> 02:14:59,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1675
02:15:01,094 --> 02:15:02,655
[SPEAKER_07]: My 3rd mix I bought for myself.

1676
02:15:02,775 --> 02:15:06,297
[SPEAKER_07]: My 4th my mom bought for me in exchange for doing housework.

1677
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:08,659
[SPEAKER_07]: 5th mix Jason bought for me.

1678
02:15:10,213 --> 02:15:19,157
[SPEAKER_07]: 6th Mix my brother got me for Christmas, 7th I bought for myself just before a tournament, Extreme my second boyfriend got for me.

1679
02:15:19,297 --> 02:15:19,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow!

1680
02:15:20,458 --> 02:15:20,838
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

1681
02:15:21,398 --> 02:15:23,419
[SPEAKER_19]: I want people to start buying me my Bimani.

1682
02:15:23,459 --> 02:15:24,440
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do I have to buy it?

1683
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:27,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Loki did buy DDR Extreme, so there's that.

1684
02:15:27,802 --> 02:15:31,524
[SPEAKER_07]: The festival will be a gift from somebody, too, whenever that finally comes.

1685
02:15:31,564 --> 02:15:31,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow!

1686
02:15:31,884 --> 02:15:33,725
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where you have the collection to rival mine.

1687
02:15:34,935 --> 02:15:38,277
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Rai Chan actually has her collection posted.

1688
02:15:38,537 --> 02:15:40,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it public on the internet somewhere where we can see it?

1689
02:15:40,899 --> 02:15:43,420
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in my live journal user info.

1690
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:43,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1691
02:15:44,401 --> 02:15:45,141
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want me to take it.

1692
02:15:45,161 --> 02:15:46,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to say that on the air?

1693
02:15:46,162 --> 02:15:47,423
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if you want to say it on the air.

1694
02:15:47,443 --> 02:15:48,363
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter to me.

1695
02:15:49,284 --> 02:15:50,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'll post a link in the chat room.

1696
02:15:51,585 --> 02:15:52,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, there you go.

1697
02:15:52,205 --> 02:15:53,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way.

1698
02:15:53,866 --> 02:15:56,008
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can actually take a look at Rai Chan's Bomani collection.

1699
02:15:56,048 --> 02:15:57,449
[SPEAKER_19]: It's quite impressive.

1700
02:15:58,149 --> 02:15:59,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Her Bomani penis is quite large.

1701
02:16:02,031 --> 02:16:02,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um...

1702
02:16:03,559 --> 02:16:05,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I got rid of my pop-up music controller.

1703
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:06,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I sold it to Angel.

1704
02:16:07,221 --> 02:16:12,203
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I still have seven, which I'll give to Jason, and then nine, most likely, I'll sell.

1705
02:16:12,603 --> 02:16:13,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll buy it from you.

1706
02:16:14,283 --> 02:16:15,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1707
02:16:16,044 --> 02:16:18,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a pop-up music controller and a pop-up music.

1708
02:16:18,886 --> 02:16:26,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I sold my controller recently, so I still have 7 and 9 sitting around just because I didn't know anyone else to sell it to.

1709
02:16:26,850 --> 02:16:28,590
[SPEAKER_18]: I've borrowed that controller too, which is funny.

1710
02:16:28,630 --> 02:16:33,453
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to sell any pop of music you have that you want to sell, you've got to buy it right here, because I need pop of music.

1711
02:16:33,473 --> 02:16:34,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, cool.

1712
02:16:35,334 --> 02:16:42,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, boy, not only do you get people to buy your new stuff for you, but you get people to buy your old shit too, I mean, god.

1713
02:16:44,162 --> 02:16:48,627
[SPEAKER_07]: and Jason wants me to post a picture of him and I, which I'll go find the link to.

1714
02:16:49,148 --> 02:16:50,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Aww, he wants to be mushy.

1715
02:16:51,210 --> 02:16:55,495
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a picture of him and I both with our entire Bimani collections.

1716
02:16:55,895 --> 02:16:57,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that is so nauseatingly cute.

1717
02:16:58,158 --> 02:16:59,760
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of his chicken hat?

1718
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:03,504
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of the chicken hat picture I took at E3?

1719
02:17:05,433 --> 02:17:08,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you saw that I used that as one of my LiveJournal user pictures.

1720
02:17:09,074 --> 02:17:10,715
[SPEAKER_18]: I just had to bring that up because I love that picture.

1721
02:17:10,975 --> 02:17:12,356
[SPEAKER_07]: We were like, you have to wear the chicken hat.

1722
02:17:13,316 --> 02:17:13,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Hug the cow.

1723
02:17:15,397 --> 02:17:16,037
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

1724
02:17:16,858 --> 02:17:17,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1725
02:17:17,958 --> 02:17:19,619
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to come up and visit us next.

1726
02:17:19,759 --> 02:17:22,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, did you and Jason actually meet through Bomani?

1727
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:25,701
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Freak and LiveJournal, pretty much.

1728
02:17:25,841 --> 02:17:27,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, that's kind of cool.

1729
02:17:28,062 --> 02:17:28,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at that.

1730
02:17:28,522 --> 02:17:30,023
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Freak brings people together.

1731
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:33,304
[SPEAKER_18]: It not only tears people apart, but it brings them together as well.

1732
02:17:33,939 --> 02:17:34,319
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1733
02:17:34,619 --> 02:17:38,141
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the internet is a good place to meet people.

1734
02:17:38,221 --> 02:17:39,922
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the internet gets a bad rap sometimes.

1735
02:17:40,182 --> 02:17:41,283
[SPEAKER_18]: It can't be a good place to meet people.

1736
02:17:41,303 --> 02:17:42,184
[SPEAKER_09]: I met Dan online.

1737
02:17:42,484 --> 02:17:42,924
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

1738
02:17:43,064 --> 02:17:43,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Through fandom.

1739
02:17:45,986 --> 02:17:47,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything else you want to comment on, Ryachan?

1740
02:17:48,547 --> 02:17:52,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, just calling to say hi since I finally have everything set up.

1741
02:17:52,349 --> 02:17:55,471
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, hello and thank you for the call and enjoy DER Festival when it comes out.

1742
02:17:55,531 --> 02:17:58,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Let us know how it is since none of us are probably even going to bother to get it.

1743
02:17:58,773 --> 02:17:59,973
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to have to be our reviewer.

1744
02:18:00,754 --> 02:18:01,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1745
02:18:01,174 --> 02:18:01,514
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1746
02:18:02,074 --> 02:18:02,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thank you guys.

1747
02:18:03,126 --> 02:18:03,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, take care.

1748
02:18:04,627 --> 02:18:04,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Bye.

1749
02:18:05,068 --> 02:18:05,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for the call.

1750
02:18:05,748 --> 02:18:06,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that was so nice.

1751
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:11,153
[SPEAKER_19]: We got some comments in the chat room that she's clearer than we are.

1752
02:18:12,454 --> 02:18:13,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Her microphone's better than ours.

1753
02:18:14,156 --> 02:18:15,777
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to know what kind of microphone she's got.

1754
02:18:15,958 --> 02:18:16,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

1755
02:18:17,539 --> 02:18:19,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, Chen, you're going to have to send me an email.

1756
02:18:20,562 --> 02:18:25,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you ever want to send me an email, if you're a stalker fan and want to send me an email, that's fine.

1757
02:18:25,386 --> 02:18:28,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a good place to go.

1758
02:18:30,543 --> 02:18:34,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I guess we're going to close up the Skype line because I want to do a break because we've got to come back.

1759
02:18:34,544 --> 02:18:36,624
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to do the FUs of the week.

1760
02:18:36,945 --> 02:18:37,805
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our favorite part.

1761
02:18:37,825 --> 02:18:38,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1762
02:18:38,025 --> 02:18:38,645
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got to do them.

1763
02:18:38,985 --> 02:18:41,145
[SPEAKER_18]: So send your FUs in now.

1764
02:18:41,285 --> 02:18:44,186
[SPEAKER_18]: And in this break, we're going to hear some keyboard mania music.

1765
02:18:45,506 --> 02:18:48,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I knew that would be the first word out of your mouth, Jamie.

1766
02:18:49,707 --> 02:18:50,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I love sensation.

1767
02:18:50,728 --> 02:18:51,988
[SPEAKER_18]: It's play sensation.

1768
02:18:52,028 --> 02:18:54,068
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's the first thing I have queued up for you.

1769
02:18:54,568 --> 02:18:55,189
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we go.

1770
02:18:55,209 --> 02:18:56,549
[SPEAKER_18]: A whole break of keyboard mania music.

1771
02:18:56,569 --> 02:18:56,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

1772
02:18:56,889 --> 02:18:57,269
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

1773
02:20:38,619 --> 02:20:40,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1774
02:25:18,769 --> 02:25:19,569
We are back.

1775
02:25:19,589 --> 02:25:26,571
What the hell are you laughing at over there?

1776
02:25:49,794 --> 02:25:50,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing is funny!

1777
02:25:51,936 --> 02:25:56,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm laughing at DJ Nostalgia's icon on DDR Maniacs.

1778
02:25:56,238 --> 02:26:05,244
[SPEAKER_16]: It's this little stick figure trying to pick up a flower to give it to the female stick figure, but the flower keeps moving, so then he finally gets pissed off and kicks the flower and it hits the chick in the head and she runs off.

1779
02:26:06,305 --> 02:26:06,645
[SPEAKER_24]: Funny.

1780
02:26:08,706 --> 02:26:09,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Hilarious.

1781
02:26:10,307 --> 02:26:11,268
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I have to say.

1782
02:26:12,629 --> 02:26:17,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well, the theme of tonight has kind of been like being dead, I guess, because...

1783
02:26:18,416 --> 02:26:19,256
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys have all been dead.

1784
02:26:19,636 --> 02:26:24,478
[SPEAKER_18]: So we decided we're going to pick things up a little bit with some good old-fashioned FUs.

1785
02:26:25,358 --> 02:26:28,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, why do we have to do some good old-fashioned FUs anyway?

1786
02:26:28,259 --> 02:26:33,501
[SPEAKER_09]: We are full of angst and anger, and if we don't let it out, we'll explode and destroy half of the world.

1787
02:26:33,521 --> 02:26:41,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is bad.

1788
02:26:41,804 --> 02:26:42,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is justice.

1789
02:26:49,033 --> 02:26:49,773
[SPEAKER_09]: My first F.U.

1790
02:26:49,793 --> 02:26:54,315
[SPEAKER_09]: of the evening goes to the driver of this Volkswagen Passat that was in front of me.

1791
02:26:54,776 --> 02:27:06,721
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, I normally, you know, give the thumbs up to good German engineering, but these are cars that are meant to be driven at 100 miles an hour on the Autobahn, not 25 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone.

1792
02:27:07,881 --> 02:27:09,242
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

1793
02:27:09,642 --> 02:27:10,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Another F.U.

1794
02:27:10,282 --> 02:27:18,606
[SPEAKER_09]: goes to me for drinking so much vodka last night and, you know, I will say whatever is on my mind while I am drunk.

1795
02:27:20,132 --> 02:27:29,803
[SPEAKER_09]: and I got very blirty, so F you to my lack of restraint while I'm intoxicated.

1796
02:27:30,844 --> 02:27:38,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Another F you goes toward this particular

1797
02:27:38,780 --> 02:27:44,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Bit of software that I've acquired that requires a certain thing to make said software work.

1798
02:27:45,364 --> 02:27:46,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I can't use it.

1799
02:27:46,725 --> 02:27:54,429
[SPEAKER_09]: A big, humongous, whopping F you goes to freaking PaintShop Pro 8 for not letting me change the size of my brush.

1800
02:27:55,089 --> 02:28:06,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I want to go and do little fine detailed work and go edit out backgrounds and stuff so that I can have transparencies and a stupid brush will not let me change the damn size of it.

1801
02:28:06,716 --> 02:28:06,916
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's

1802
02:28:07,990 --> 02:28:09,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Photoshop is ass, okay?

1803
02:28:09,471 --> 02:28:12,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not like Photoshop, even though I'm going to have to take a class in it.

1804
02:28:12,933 --> 02:28:19,176
[SPEAKER_09]: But that means that I'm going to have to go back to using PaintShop Pro 7, except PaintShop Pro 8 has some really good filters in it.

1805
02:28:21,037 --> 02:28:32,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And also FU to the potential class I have to take in Photoshop, even though I don't care for Photoshop all that much, except it does have also really nice filters, and I like the way it does layers better.

1806
02:28:33,784 --> 02:28:35,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And FU goes toward...

1807
02:28:37,664 --> 02:29:05,113
[SPEAKER_09]: another thing about PaintShot Pro 8 for not letting me freaking rotate my text in a curve the way I want to it's doing some weird vector thing that's really pissing me off so that means that I have to do 10 sideshow posters for Halloween by hand I have to ink them and then color them on the computer at least I can do some neat stuff to it and make it look cool once I have drawn it and scanned it

1808
02:29:05,609 --> 02:29:07,930
[SPEAKER_09]: And at least I don't have to do some heavy shading on it either.

1809
02:29:07,970 --> 02:29:09,110
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all primary colors.

1810
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:11,291
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just my hand's going to be falling off.

1811
02:29:11,351 --> 02:29:14,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have other drawings I really, really want to work on too.

1812
02:29:15,452 --> 02:29:21,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So as it stands, I'm just going to have to, I guess, find some time.

1813
02:29:21,953 --> 02:29:24,094
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I've done all the homework for one of my classes.

1814
02:29:25,194 --> 02:29:36,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, and another F you toward not having my Copic markers anymore, because I finally, three of my Copic markers dried out, and that means I have to go pay another 20 bucks to get another set.

1815
02:29:37,102 --> 02:29:42,766
[SPEAKER_09]: So... And also, just an F you to the color Copics for being so damn expensive anyway.

1816
02:29:43,606 --> 02:29:48,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, true, you're paying for quality and alcohol-based ink, but... Ugh, so expensive.

1817
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:52,812
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm retracting an F you this week to Dell.

1818
02:29:53,413 --> 02:29:54,934
[SPEAKER_18]: Whoa, is that a first?

1819
02:29:55,805 --> 02:29:56,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I could go on before.

1820
02:29:56,645 --> 02:29:57,665
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish I could go on before.

1821
02:30:25,851 --> 02:30:27,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will make me a happy bunny.

1822
02:30:29,593 --> 02:30:30,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy happy bunny.

1823
02:30:31,074 --> 02:30:32,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And one final FU.

1824
02:30:32,695 --> 02:30:34,035
[SPEAKER_09]: To my happy bunny t-shirt.

1825
02:30:35,156 --> 02:30:37,917
[SPEAKER_09]: And my happy bunny t-shirt had pink fuzzy fur on him.

1826
02:30:38,397 --> 02:30:40,839
[SPEAKER_09]: And now he looks like he's got a goatee over his belly.

1827
02:30:41,539 --> 02:30:44,981
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because it's like the bottom of his mouth is like by his belly.

1828
02:30:45,521 --> 02:30:48,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So he looks like he's just got bad chest hair.

1829
02:30:49,583 --> 02:30:51,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And like the rest of them is rub all raw.

1830
02:30:52,865 --> 02:30:54,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Another FU goes to Rob's cell phone.

1831
02:30:55,914 --> 02:30:58,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be on silent while we're on the show.

1832
02:30:59,115 --> 02:31:00,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1833
02:31:00,516 --> 02:31:01,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1834
02:31:02,357 --> 02:31:02,937
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

1835
02:31:03,317 --> 02:31:03,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm spent.

1836
02:31:05,178 --> 02:31:08,499
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's move on to Loki and see what he's pissed off about this time.

1837
02:31:11,080 --> 02:31:18,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, first off, I'm going to be pissed off at my toe because I just squeezed it really hard in this big, pussy, clump thing.

1838
02:31:19,243 --> 02:31:24,425
[SPEAKER_16]: I was, but I need to let it dry out because before, you know, with a band-aid, it just stays wet.

1839
02:31:24,878 --> 02:31:25,498
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have any gauze.

1840
02:31:25,818 --> 02:31:32,721
[SPEAKER_16]: So anyway, so, um, yeah, I squeezed this big clump of whatever out, because it looked like it was pussying a little bit, so I was like seeing how bad it was.

1841
02:31:33,302 --> 02:31:38,784
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, but it wasn't that, it was like some of the gauze that was left over from the other thing I hadn't pulled out.

1842
02:31:38,944 --> 02:31:40,565
[SPEAKER_16]: It was in the hole where they...

1843
02:31:41,573 --> 02:31:43,934
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1844
02:32:11,249 --> 02:32:13,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you to Denios for sucking.

1845
02:32:13,450 --> 02:32:17,593
[SPEAKER_16]: I never realized how many cell phone case booths there could be in one place.

1846
02:32:18,273 --> 02:32:24,938
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I didn't really need a cell phone case or a new faceplate because there's tons of those faceplate booths.

1847
02:32:25,298 --> 02:32:28,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Nor did I need any used underwear or samurai swords.

1848
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:34,664
[SPEAKER_16]: I swear to God, this place is like, we have power tools, we have bungee cords, and we have samurai swords.

1849
02:32:35,944 --> 02:32:36,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Where the hell does that fit in?

1850
02:32:37,915 --> 02:32:38,696
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just weird.

1851
02:32:38,816 --> 02:32:41,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I bought some Korean pop CDs there.

1852
02:32:43,319 --> 02:32:46,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's cool, but that was the only, like, cool thing that was there.

1853
02:32:46,462 --> 02:32:47,182
[SPEAKER_09]: I walked around that.

1854
02:32:47,402 --> 02:32:48,823
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, it's not the same anymore.

1855
02:32:48,863 --> 02:32:51,605
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, we went at around 2 to 3 o'clock.

1856
02:32:51,625 --> 02:32:56,489
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that is not very early, but it's not late in the day.

1857
02:32:56,549 --> 02:33:00,252
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, and there was already half the people that already packed up and left.

1858
02:33:00,973 --> 02:33:06,156
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, they were closing the fucking, you know, food vending booths down at 3, and they closed at 5.

1859
02:33:07,819 --> 02:33:08,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck, two hours early?

1860
02:33:08,979 --> 02:33:10,120
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a little ridiculous.

1861
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:12,040
[SPEAKER_16]: But whatever, so they were doing that.

1862
02:33:12,841 --> 02:33:14,781
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was really lame and a waste of my time.

1863
02:33:15,081 --> 02:33:19,523
[SPEAKER_16]: But, also, fuck you to Shark's Tale, because it was kind of lame.

1864
02:33:20,203 --> 02:33:22,964
[SPEAKER_16]: But I went and saw it for free, so that wasn't that lame.

1865
02:33:23,184 --> 02:33:26,245
[SPEAKER_16]: But it just still sucked, and it was a waste of my time.

1866
02:33:29,046 --> 02:33:33,347
[SPEAKER_16]: And, finally, just, you know...

1867
02:33:34,198 --> 02:33:34,838
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really know.

1868
02:33:34,939 --> 02:33:39,081
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a lot more stuff earlier this week, and I just cannot remember it for the life of me now.

1869
02:33:39,502 --> 02:33:42,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you to Goddamn Roundtable today.

1870
02:33:42,644 --> 02:33:45,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, now, I bought a personal pizza and Twizz.

1871
02:33:45,525 --> 02:33:46,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Their Twizz are fucking huge!

1872
02:33:47,046 --> 02:33:49,128
[SPEAKER_16]: If I knew they were fucking huge, I would have just bought the Twizz.

1873
02:33:49,628 --> 02:33:51,509
[SPEAKER_16]: But not only that, they didn't cook them all the way through.

1874
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:58,634
[SPEAKER_16]: They were damn good, so I ate them all, but I had to take a very bad shit when I got home.

1875
02:33:59,775 --> 02:34:00,615
[SPEAKER_09]: That's beautiful.

1876
02:34:01,156 --> 02:34:01,376
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

1877
02:34:02,213 --> 02:34:27,132
[SPEAKER_16]: or at least it felt like it did, it wasn't, it was just, you know, it's just, you know, one of those things like, urgent, emergency, you know, that's not a feeling I want to have after, you know, eating at Roundtable, because I love Roundtable, and I was just, it was ironic because I was telling a story about how I used to make twists out of large pizza skins that were like a good, you know, three feet long when you're done with them, which is awesome, but, I don't know, they were still good though, but, um,

1878
02:34:28,493 --> 02:34:29,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how it'll work, but I want something new.

1879
02:34:29,794 --> 02:34:30,695
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to give an FU.

1880
02:34:57,202 --> 02:35:23,472
[SPEAKER_18]: to that person I was already giving FUs to earlier who just made themselves look like an ass I want to give an FU to myself for having a little bit too much to drink last night and kind of forcing myself to stay in Chico until really late although actually I had a really good time so I have absolutely nothing to be bitching about but I need to learn to say no to drinking a lot better because I'm going to get myself in trouble sometimes what?

1881
02:35:24,053 --> 02:35:25,233
[SPEAKER_10]: just say no I know

1882
02:35:26,691 --> 02:35:38,699
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I want to give an FU to Unnecessary Drama and people that get off on perpetuating other people's drama.

1883
02:35:39,119 --> 02:35:43,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I think I've had a pretty good week, all things considered, to be honest.

1884
02:35:43,282 --> 02:35:46,284
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't have a whole bunch to give FUs to.

1885
02:35:47,945 --> 02:35:51,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, FU to people that make fun of my name on Ultramix.

1886
02:35:51,547 --> 02:35:55,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I freaking join games on Ultramix and people go, huh, it's Greenski.

1887
02:35:56,872 --> 02:36:00,313
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, it's green sky, but since you don't know how to read, I'll forgive you.

1888
02:36:01,673 --> 02:36:05,193
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's just like, you know... And then I go and kick your ass.

1889
02:36:05,894 --> 02:36:10,054
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're like, you know, you just tell me I'm on a controller or something, even though I'm not.

1890
02:36:10,454 --> 02:36:11,815
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually on a dance pad.

1891
02:36:12,275 --> 02:36:16,896
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, um... Just in general, retards.

1892
02:36:17,376 --> 02:36:19,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Not actual people who are actually retarded.

1893
02:36:19,236 --> 02:36:22,537
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there's nothing they can do about it, but I mean people who act retarded and they have no reason to be.

1894
02:36:23,717 --> 02:36:24,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it FU-related?

1895
02:36:26,215 --> 02:36:28,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Loki has something F you related.

1896
02:36:31,619 --> 02:36:33,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you to Bush because you look like an idiot during the debate.

1897
02:36:33,961 --> 02:36:34,241
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

1898
02:36:37,043 --> 02:36:37,483
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on.

1899
02:36:39,044 --> 02:36:39,385
[SPEAKER_19]: Bradley.

1900
02:36:42,227 --> 02:36:42,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

1901
02:36:42,827 --> 02:36:55,116
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing I really have to say is fuck you to have to go another month being frugal because even with my pay raise I gotta pay off bills and stuff so I can't really do very much for the next month but I will.

1902
02:36:55,816 --> 02:36:56,296
[SPEAKER_17]: That's about it.

1903
02:36:57,517 --> 02:36:57,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that was quick.

1904
02:36:59,098 --> 02:36:59,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Fair enough.

1905
02:36:59,639 --> 02:37:03,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to the chatroom and see what our chatroom has to bitch about this time.

1906
02:37:04,883 --> 02:37:08,565
[SPEAKER_18]: El Mullitz wants to say an F you to the chatroom for being so dead.

1907
02:37:08,645 --> 02:37:09,386
[SPEAKER_18]: Not my fault.

1908
02:37:10,146 --> 02:37:13,809
[SPEAKER_18]: An F you to idiots who claim you're a company fanboy for liking their games.

1909
02:37:13,889 --> 02:37:17,392
[SPEAKER_18]: And on behalf of DarkSakura, an F you to Cosmo Magazine.

1910
02:37:17,432 --> 02:37:18,032
[SPEAKER_18]: She knows why.

1911
02:37:18,412 --> 02:37:20,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's... Oh my god, that's the one I forgot.

1912
02:37:21,363 --> 02:37:24,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Beyond Paradise Beyond the Garbage Dump

1913
02:37:47,884 --> 02:37:52,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Beyond Sequel Matter or something, I don't know.

1914
02:37:53,508 --> 02:38:02,334
[SPEAKER_18]: OtakuRat says, F you to working 11 hours on 3 hours of sleep.

1915
02:38:02,354 --> 02:38:04,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Jazz says, F you to elderly drivers.

1916
02:38:05,757 --> 02:38:08,939
[SPEAKER_18]: For the love of God, stop driving 10 miles an hour under the speed limit.

1917
02:38:09,452 --> 02:38:12,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, F you to the people who plaster their cars with political stickers.

1918
02:38:12,874 --> 02:38:14,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Has anyone noticed these people suck ass at driving?

1919
02:38:14,895 --> 02:38:19,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, buddy, I just put a political sticker on my car this week, so F you!

1920
02:38:19,538 --> 02:38:20,359
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you put on there?

1921
02:38:20,719 --> 02:38:21,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Carrie Edwards sticker.

1922
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:25,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm just gonna refrain from talking.

1923
02:38:25,262 --> 02:38:27,523
[SPEAKER_18]: My mother put a Carrie Edwards sticker on my car, actually.

1924
02:38:27,703 --> 02:38:28,904
[SPEAKER_18]: And she put it on crooked.

1925
02:38:28,924 --> 02:38:30,885
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, neither of them are worthy of my vote.

1926
02:38:30,925 --> 02:38:32,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm voting for Silver Cat again.

1927
02:38:32,126 --> 02:38:38,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I don't want Bush to win, and I actually kind of like Carrie, especially after the debate, so we'll just leave it at that.

1928
02:38:38,730 --> 02:38:38,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh...

1929
02:38:39,771 --> 02:38:45,437
[SPEAKER_18]: Jazz says one more thing, F you to a certain in the groove step file creator for being such an elitist bastard.

1930
02:38:45,477 --> 02:38:48,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, where did I hear that one earlier tonight?

1931
02:38:48,561 --> 02:38:54,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Nith says, F you to all computer image editor programs for not having a way of making a decent spiral.

1932
02:38:55,969 --> 02:38:56,349
[SPEAKER_18]: Fair enough.

1933
02:38:56,870 --> 02:38:57,911
[SPEAKER_18]: Any ideas on that?

1934
02:38:59,373 --> 02:38:59,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

1935
02:39:00,385 --> 02:39:02,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't ever had to make a spiral, so.

1936
02:39:03,307 --> 02:39:07,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, actually, yeah, you can do one in PaintShop Pro using the, uh, the twist.

1937
02:39:08,531 --> 02:39:13,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you, uh, do a straight line from the center and then, uh, do the twist warp and that should work.

1938
02:39:13,375 --> 02:39:15,837
[SPEAKER_09]: You can save it as a, as a paintbrush and paint.

1939
02:39:16,717 --> 02:39:17,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Drawing tips from Jamie.

1940
02:39:18,579 --> 02:39:19,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1941
02:39:19,980 --> 02:39:24,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, VXJasonXV says, F you to a lack of sleep and making me sleep through almost all the show.

1942
02:39:25,364 --> 02:39:27,225
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I woke up to my girlfriend's voice, though.

1943
02:39:27,245 --> 02:39:27,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

1944
02:39:27,806 --> 02:39:27,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

1945
02:39:29,642 --> 02:39:34,445
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to the people who randomly bash other people they don't even know and probably do it only because they don't like me.

1946
02:39:34,746 --> 02:39:35,426
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know what?

1947
02:39:35,626 --> 02:39:38,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I can prevent his ability to connect to that IRC network.

1948
02:39:38,668 --> 02:39:39,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Insert evil laugh here.

1949
02:39:39,769 --> 02:39:42,231
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm laughing too because I know exactly what he's talking about.

1950
02:39:42,411 --> 02:39:47,114
[SPEAKER_18]: And when this person gets banned from anywhere, it's good news.

1951
02:39:47,194 --> 02:39:48,555
[SPEAKER_18]: I just told Jamie what it was.

1952
02:39:48,595 --> 02:39:50,357
[SPEAKER_18]: I was doing sign language to Jamie.

1953
02:39:53,101 --> 02:39:55,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I have choice words that I'm not going to say.

1954
02:39:55,382 --> 02:39:55,722
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1955
02:39:55,762 --> 02:39:56,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've said them.

1956
02:39:56,442 --> 02:39:58,143
[SPEAKER_18]: She'll say them on commercial break, I'm sure.

1957
02:39:58,203 --> 02:39:59,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's been my time.

1958
02:40:01,464 --> 02:40:03,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, oh yeah, he says.

1959
02:40:04,365 --> 02:40:09,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, to expand on my first one, F you to sleep, making you not do anything.

1960
02:40:09,827 --> 02:40:10,608
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to go shopping.

1961
02:40:11,788 --> 02:40:17,470
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't know how many times I've needed to go shopping, and then I'm like, mm, sleep.

1962
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:19,891
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't end up shopping, and then I wonder why I'm hungry.

1963
02:40:21,533 --> 02:40:25,621
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Angel says F you to fellow students in a class that Magus and I are taking.

1964
02:40:25,682 --> 02:40:27,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost called him Magus.

1965
02:40:29,589 --> 02:40:32,014
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a total Tom Brokaw moment, I swear.

1966
02:40:33,243 --> 02:40:35,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but Rob, there's a difference.

1967
02:40:36,165 --> 02:40:38,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Brokaw gets paid, you know, a few million a year.

1968
02:40:40,088 --> 02:40:42,490
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't get paid for the show.

1969
02:40:42,691 --> 02:40:43,031
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

1970
02:40:44,632 --> 02:40:49,656
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to fellow students in the class that... I mean, I've been horribly bad on my speech tonight.

1971
02:40:49,796 --> 02:40:51,317
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how many things I've said.

1972
02:40:51,377 --> 02:40:57,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, where my mind was just in three different places and I ran them all together and just said things I didn't mean to say.

1973
02:40:57,923 --> 02:40:58,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God.

1974
02:40:58,903 --> 02:41:00,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigh.

1975
02:41:02,148 --> 02:41:05,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel says, F you to fellow students in the class that Magus and I are taking.

1976
02:41:06,151 --> 02:41:07,132
[SPEAKER_18]: You asked for our help.

1977
02:41:07,212 --> 02:41:07,952
[SPEAKER_18]: We gave it to you.

1978
02:41:08,012 --> 02:41:09,453
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not our fault you didn't get it.

1979
02:41:09,974 --> 02:41:11,174
[SPEAKER_18]: We never said you were stupid.

1980
02:41:11,234 --> 02:41:17,039
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't put words in our mouths to make us look bad when we are trying to be diligent students, just like the rest of the class.

1981
02:41:17,179 --> 02:41:17,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Grr.

1982
02:41:18,500 --> 02:41:19,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I feel better.

1983
02:41:23,803 --> 02:41:26,825
[SPEAKER_18]: For a pretty dead chat room, that was a very ranty evening of FUs.

1984
02:41:26,946 --> 02:41:29,167
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of am surprised.

1985
02:41:30,388 --> 02:41:31,509
[SPEAKER_09]: They're restoring it, Rob.

1986
02:41:31,529 --> 02:41:31,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1987
02:41:33,115 --> 02:41:41,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from break, since we've got a few minutes left in the show, and that's how we always buy ourselves some time, is we do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1988
02:41:42,501 --> 02:41:42,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

1989
02:41:45,683 --> 02:41:47,164
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we did Elmullet's like first.

1990
02:41:47,525 --> 02:41:48,785
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that was CDR Angel who was last.

1991
02:41:49,926 --> 02:41:50,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1992
02:41:50,547 --> 02:41:50,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1993
02:41:51,647 --> 02:41:52,408
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go to a break.

1994
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:56,827
[SPEAKER_18]: In this break, 2DX music, because I want to hear Love is Dreaminess.

1995
02:41:57,148 --> 02:41:57,829
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll be back.

1996
02:41:57,910 --> 02:42:00,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, we'll just make an LED break.

1997
02:42:00,355 --> 02:42:00,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Hell with it.

1998
02:42:00,655 --> 02:42:01,537
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do LED music.

1999
02:42:01,557 --> 02:42:03,341
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back after this LED break.

2000
02:42:03,681 --> 02:42:03,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

2001
02:42:17,742 --> 02:42:19,203
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2002
02:44:20,729 --> 02:44:23,770
You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience.

2003
02:44:23,831 --> 02:44:24,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the whole Earth.

2004
02:44:25,031 --> 02:44:26,012
Yes, the whole Earth.

2005
02:45:18,035 --> 02:45:21,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You are already dead!

2006
02:47:31,215 --> 02:47:35,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

2007
02:47:35,596 --> 02:47:37,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

2008
02:47:37,377 --> 02:47:37,737
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

2009
02:47:40,117 --> 02:47:41,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we care what people think of us?

2010
02:47:43,858 --> 02:47:43,958
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

2011
02:47:43,998 --> 02:47:45,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

2012
02:47:45,899 --> 02:47:48,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

2013
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,880
[SPEAKER_22]: Extreme Babani Radio.

2014
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:54,761
[SPEAKER_22]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

2015
02:47:55,296 --> 02:47:56,597
[SPEAKER_18]: Xtreme Radio I have a question, Rob.

2016
02:48:24,238 --> 02:48:25,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, should I start the music first?

2017
02:48:26,159 --> 02:48:26,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, start the music.

2018
02:48:26,900 --> 02:48:27,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2019
02:48:34,004 --> 02:48:36,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2020
02:48:37,446 --> 02:48:40,707
[SPEAKER_19]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

2021
02:48:41,168 --> 02:48:44,270
[SPEAKER_19]: That is if we even get any questions anyway.

2022
02:48:44,790 --> 02:48:47,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Because even though people are listening, we already put them to sleep.

2023
02:48:50,782 --> 02:48:53,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear Orange Lounge... Yes, DarkSakura, your question.

2024
02:48:53,823 --> 02:48:55,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we so cool?

2025
02:48:57,705 --> 02:48:59,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, because I'm here.

2026
02:49:00,466 --> 02:49:01,687
[SPEAKER_09]: The air conditioner's cranked up.

2027
02:49:02,948 --> 02:49:04,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get to our first listener question.

2028
02:49:05,889 --> 02:49:13,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Jason, MrVXJasonXV himself says, Does anyone remember seeing Katamari Damase... Damse?

2029
02:49:13,652 --> 02:49:14,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Damase?

2030
02:49:14,233 --> 02:49:14,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Damase!

2031
02:49:15,455 --> 02:49:17,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Katamari Damacy at E3.

2032
02:49:17,216 --> 02:49:18,976
[SPEAKER_18]: I've read reports about it, but I didn't see it.

2033
02:49:19,536 --> 02:49:23,197
[SPEAKER_18]: I just beat the game yesterday, and it's one of the greatest I've ever played.

2034
02:49:23,698 --> 02:49:24,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Has anyone else played it?

2035
02:49:25,318 --> 02:49:26,859
[SPEAKER_18]: I have never heard of this game in my entire life.

2036
02:49:26,879 --> 02:49:27,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of this game.

2037
02:49:28,139 --> 02:49:28,339
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

2038
02:49:28,819 --> 02:49:29,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of that game.

2039
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:33,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki has a question.

2040
02:49:34,141 --> 02:49:39,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that the one where you, like, roll over shit, where you have this giant ball of crap that you roll over shit with?

2041
02:49:39,142 --> 02:49:39,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that is it.

2042
02:49:40,123 --> 02:49:43,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Where they spoofed it in, um, a penny arcade?

2043
02:49:43,844 --> 02:49:43,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh...

2044
02:49:45,009 --> 02:49:47,610
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to play it because it looks funny.

2045
02:49:48,450 --> 02:49:49,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that is the game.

2046
02:49:50,471 --> 02:49:51,692
[SPEAKER_16]: The giant ball of shit game.

2047
02:49:52,052 --> 02:49:53,633
[SPEAKER_09]: The giant ball of shit game.

2048
02:49:55,053 --> 02:49:55,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Looks fun.

2049
02:49:56,814 --> 02:49:59,635
[SPEAKER_18]: I will post a link to the official website here.

2050
02:50:00,516 --> 02:50:02,316
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember this game at all.

2051
02:50:02,376 --> 02:50:03,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it a Japanese game?

2052
02:50:04,077 --> 02:50:05,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh no, it looks like an English game.

2053
02:50:05,758 --> 02:50:08,299
[SPEAKER_17]: It was released for like 15 bucks at Fry's.

2054
02:50:08,739 --> 02:50:09,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

2055
02:50:09,519 --> 02:50:10,420
[SPEAKER_17]: And then sold out.

2056
02:50:10,480 --> 02:50:12,080
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really cool and everything.

2057
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:13,501
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never played it though.

2058
02:50:14,987 --> 02:50:16,588
[SPEAKER_19]: How have I never heard of this game?

2059
02:50:18,008 --> 02:50:18,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Weird.

2060
02:50:20,489 --> 02:50:21,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's Namco.

2061
02:50:22,150 --> 02:50:22,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it is.

2062
02:50:23,130 --> 02:50:24,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, anything by Namco is good.

2063
02:50:25,131 --> 02:50:25,731
[SPEAKER_18]: That's weird.

2064
02:50:25,891 --> 02:50:29,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Namco back in the day... Why have I never... I guess I'm just out of it.

2065
02:50:29,613 --> 02:50:31,613
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not cool anymore is basically what it boils down to.

2066
02:50:31,633 --> 02:50:32,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.

2067
02:50:32,093 --> 02:50:33,114
[SPEAKER_18]: A giant ball of shit.

2068
02:50:33,154 --> 02:50:33,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that.

2069
02:50:35,015 --> 02:50:35,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

2070
02:50:35,335 --> 02:50:37,476
[SPEAKER_09]: I would kill for a giant ball of shit.

2071
02:50:38,436 --> 02:50:39,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to more questions.

2072
02:50:39,656 --> 02:50:42,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Not shit, but stuff.

2073
02:50:42,657 --> 02:50:43,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Stuff, yeah.

2074
02:50:43,158 --> 02:50:44,098
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a giant ball of stuff.

2075
02:50:44,841 --> 02:50:47,622
[SPEAKER_17]: You wouldn't really want a ball of shit rolling over you.

2076
02:50:47,642 --> 02:50:48,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it would kind of suck.

2077
02:50:49,784 --> 02:50:50,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Get everything messy.

2078
02:50:51,084 --> 02:50:52,505
[SPEAKER_18]: They're calling it a sleeper hit.

2079
02:50:52,985 --> 02:50:54,326
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a budget sleeper hit.

2080
02:50:54,906 --> 02:50:56,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, kind of like what Incredible Crisis was.

2081
02:50:58,288 --> 02:51:06,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Brack2000 has a question, and I don't know if I want to ask his question, to be honest, but I guess I will, because I do that.

2082
02:51:06,512 --> 02:51:08,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Brack2000 wants to know, where's the ferret at?

2083
02:51:09,274 --> 02:51:09,834
[SPEAKER_18]: It's on the floor.

2084
02:51:11,495 --> 02:51:12,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Where should it be?

2085
02:51:12,056 --> 02:51:13,457
[SPEAKER_17]: It needs to stay there.

2086
02:51:13,737 --> 02:51:15,218
[SPEAKER_17]: In the fireplace where he belongs.

2087
02:51:15,758 --> 02:51:17,260
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have a fireplace, Rob.

2088
02:51:17,280 --> 02:51:19,161
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a fireplace in my place.

2089
02:51:20,302 --> 02:51:21,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to the retarded love.

2090
02:51:22,643 --> 02:51:24,565
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel has a question to all the hosts.

2091
02:51:24,905 --> 02:51:26,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Want me to make new promos?

2092
02:51:26,807 --> 02:51:27,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, we'll take donations.

2093
02:51:28,928 --> 02:51:29,529
[SPEAKER_18]: What are we going to say?

2094
02:51:29,909 --> 02:51:31,570
[SPEAKER_18]: No, don't give us free stuff.

2095
02:51:31,870 --> 02:51:33,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't do work for us.

2096
02:51:33,672 --> 02:51:34,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Please don't.

2097
02:51:34,652 --> 02:51:37,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course we want people to make fun of us.

2098
02:51:37,174 --> 02:51:37,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie.

2099
02:51:38,135 --> 02:51:38,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Question for Jamie.

2100
02:51:38,675 --> 02:51:39,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut that damn thing up.

2101
02:51:39,456 --> 02:51:39,596
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2102
02:51:40,362 --> 02:51:45,185
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you think the best way to get my stamina up for DDR besides playing DDR itself?

2103
02:51:45,245 --> 02:51:45,845
[SPEAKER_18]: I want options.

2104
02:51:46,606 --> 02:51:47,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this Angel?

2105
02:51:47,786 --> 02:51:48,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2106
02:51:49,107 --> 02:51:49,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Start walking.

2107
02:51:50,948 --> 02:51:51,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, walking.

2108
02:51:51,869 --> 02:51:52,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Start walking.

2109
02:51:53,214 --> 02:51:55,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Do things that get your heart going.

2110
02:51:56,336 --> 02:51:58,397
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole thing is that DDR is cardio.

2111
02:51:59,418 --> 02:52:09,083
[SPEAKER_09]: And no matter how good you get your legs in shape, if you're breathing, if your lungs can't keep up with it, you should go to spin with me, Angel.

2112
02:52:09,203 --> 02:52:11,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a membership at my gym and go to spin with me.

2113
02:52:11,284 --> 02:52:13,465
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll get your cardio built up.

2114
02:52:13,665 --> 02:52:15,527
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still debating getting a membership at that gym, too.

2115
02:52:15,587 --> 02:52:16,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I guarantee you.

2116
02:52:17,648 --> 02:52:17,768
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

2117
02:52:18,453 --> 02:52:19,394
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to be buff.

2118
02:52:41,906 --> 02:52:44,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is no way in hell I can run two miles, okay?

2119
02:52:44,448 --> 02:52:46,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I can barely run a quarter of the track.

2120
02:52:47,429 --> 02:52:51,171
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're working on getting in shape to do the mud run next year.

2121
02:52:51,752 --> 02:52:54,753
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to come work out with us, you're welcome to do it.

2122
02:52:54,973 --> 02:53:05,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would help build up your stamina because we're doing run walks on the track and running the stairs and doing sit-ups and push-ups and all kinds of stuff.

2123
02:53:07,260 --> 02:53:08,421
[SPEAKER_18]: You're starting a fitness club.

2124
02:53:08,914 --> 02:53:09,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, kind of.

2125
02:53:09,534 --> 02:53:14,235
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about doing something like Orange Lounge Fitness.

2126
02:53:14,595 --> 02:53:15,736
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cute.

2127
02:53:16,376 --> 02:53:17,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Meanwhile, I'm on the DDR diet.

2128
02:53:20,657 --> 02:53:23,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Rule number one of Run Club.

2129
02:53:23,277 --> 02:53:25,178
[SPEAKER_16]: No one talks about Run Club!

2130
02:53:26,418 --> 02:53:26,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

2131
02:53:28,639 --> 02:53:29,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on with Angel's question.

2132
02:53:29,959 --> 02:53:31,379
[SPEAKER_18]: There's also a question for Loki here.

2133
02:53:31,539 --> 02:53:32,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Is your new remix done?

2134
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:34,360
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't even know he was working on a new remix.

2135
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:38,721
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, okay, what's the status of Loki remixes?

2136
02:53:38,741 --> 02:53:39,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Is anything on the plate?

2137
02:53:40,061 --> 02:53:41,182
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll reword her question.

2138
02:53:41,202 --> 02:53:43,303
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought that was a plan.

2139
02:53:44,344 --> 02:53:45,544
[SPEAKER_16]: There was stuff being done.

2140
02:53:46,265 --> 02:53:47,145
[SPEAKER_16]: This is news to me.

2141
02:53:47,545 --> 02:53:53,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe she was asking, like I was thinking, have we renamed your last remix yet?

2142
02:53:53,428 --> 02:53:55,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, I went with my name.

2143
02:53:56,070 --> 02:53:56,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Which was?

2144
02:53:57,971 --> 02:53:58,831
[SPEAKER_16]: What did I name that?

2145
02:54:00,745 --> 02:54:06,471
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was Radical Faith, The Final Judgment Mix or something like that.

2146
02:54:07,492 --> 02:54:08,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think that's what I called it.

2147
02:54:08,713 --> 02:54:10,515
[SPEAKER_15]: There you have it.

2148
02:54:11,816 --> 02:54:16,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, am I allowed to use the controller when playing Ultra Mix against you because my converter is being buggy?

2149
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:18,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's fine.

2150
02:54:18,182 --> 02:54:19,363
[SPEAKER_18]: You can play controller against me.

2151
02:54:19,463 --> 02:54:20,744
[SPEAKER_18]: But, here's the thing.

2152
02:54:21,104 --> 02:54:29,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't fucking go picking like Can't Stop Falling In Love, Speed Mix, followed by Paranoia Rebirth, and then Eternal, and then fucking like every 9-footer in the game back-to-back.

2153
02:54:30,333 --> 02:54:31,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Because remember, I'm on a dance pad.

2154
02:54:31,774 --> 02:54:32,855
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to be playing fucking...

2155
02:54:34,011 --> 02:54:36,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Santa Milete Light No, I'm kidding.

2156
02:54:36,052 --> 02:54:37,793
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, just within reason.

2157
02:54:37,833 --> 02:54:39,614
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as the songs are within reason, I don't really care.

2158
02:54:39,634 --> 02:54:41,035
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as we're just playing to have fun.

2159
02:54:41,055 --> 02:54:45,137
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm playing against somebody for fun, then yeah, we can, you know, use whatever you want.

2160
02:54:45,177 --> 02:54:46,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I'll play on the controller.

2161
02:54:46,338 --> 02:54:50,420
[SPEAKER_18]: We should just keep playing against each other on the controller like a bunch and then rack up a bunch of points.

2162
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:51,200
[SPEAKER_18]: That would actually be fun.

2163
02:54:52,821 --> 02:54:54,822
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually have an idea how we're going to get ourselves in the top 100.

2164
02:54:54,922 --> 02:54:57,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh... Ah, damn.

2165
02:54:58,684 --> 02:54:59,545
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't want to cheat.

2166
02:54:59,645 --> 02:55:01,046
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I want to do it honestly.

2167
02:55:01,246 --> 02:55:02,226
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do it honestly.

2168
02:55:02,627 --> 02:55:03,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Hehehehe.

2169
02:55:04,180 --> 02:55:12,022
[SPEAKER_18]: El Mullet says, if any of you had to pick an old school video game character as your favorite of all time, who would you pick?

2170
02:55:12,942 --> 02:55:13,423
[SPEAKER_08]: For what?

2171
02:55:14,063 --> 02:55:16,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Your favorite old game... Oh, I'm sorry.

2172
02:55:16,063 --> 02:55:21,205
[SPEAKER_18]: If you had to pick an old school video game character as your favorite of all time.

2173
02:55:23,005 --> 02:55:24,306
[SPEAKER_09]: The chick from The Guardian Legend.

2174
02:55:25,886 --> 02:55:29,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Richter Belmont from Dracula X. Hmm.

2175
02:55:30,376 --> 02:55:38,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because he walks around with his Ryu haircut and his headband with a whip being all badass vampire hunter, that's kind of cool.

2176
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:41,861
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of hot.

2177
02:55:43,302 --> 02:55:48,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I would have to say either the Dark Queen from Battletoads or Chun-Li.

2178
02:55:50,345 --> 02:55:51,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Super Joe.

2179
02:55:53,427 --> 02:55:54,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Joe?

2180
02:55:54,928 --> 02:55:55,608
[SPEAKER_16]: By On Commando.

2181
02:55:56,138 --> 02:55:57,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that's cool.

2182
02:55:57,658 --> 02:56:00,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you blow up Hitler at the end of that game, only it's not Hitler.

2183
02:56:04,060 --> 02:56:09,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Or, um, like, a random Mega Man 2 boss, because the Mega Man bosses are cool.

2184
02:56:09,301 --> 02:56:11,922
[SPEAKER_09]: You would so be, uh, Quickman.

2185
02:56:12,942 --> 02:56:14,382
[SPEAKER_18]: There is no Rainbow Man.

2186
02:56:14,442 --> 02:56:14,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to hell.

2187
02:56:17,703 --> 02:56:18,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, uh, Misty.

2188
02:56:18,983 --> 02:56:21,384
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know what the hell happened to episode 111.

2189
02:56:21,964 --> 02:56:23,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you delete it or something?

2190
02:56:23,064 --> 02:56:25,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been looking forward to hearing it on Rewind Pal-

2191
02:56:26,630 --> 02:56:28,831
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's 1.12 that never got recorded.

2192
02:56:28,871 --> 02:56:42,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, 1.12 is gone, but there was a small mistake that happened this week where something got updated and didn't get saved, which caused you to hear the same episode for the third week in a row, and I apologize for that.

2193
02:56:43,717 --> 02:56:44,618
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know what?

2194
02:56:45,158 --> 02:56:46,778
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a suggestion for you in the chatroom.

2195
02:56:46,899 --> 02:56:47,279
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2196
02:56:47,399 --> 02:56:48,039
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn.

2197
02:56:48,159 --> 02:56:49,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Ride2000 said you should be Hardman.

2198
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:50,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Every day.

2199
02:56:58,741 --> 02:57:00,562
[SPEAKER_18]: No, episode 111 exists.

2200
02:57:00,622 --> 02:57:04,485
[SPEAKER_18]: And in fact, to prove it, I will play a random moment from episode 111.

2201
02:57:05,026 --> 02:57:06,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's a random moment from episode 111.

2202
02:57:07,748 --> 02:57:08,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bash Bin Laden.

2203
02:57:09,269 --> 02:57:11,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Goddamn Bush family, forgive Bin Laden.

2204
02:57:12,311 --> 02:57:14,493
[SPEAKER_00]: President Bush should be killed and his entire family.

2205
02:57:14,513 --> 02:57:16,194
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't for them, Osama wouldn't live.

2206
02:57:16,775 --> 02:57:17,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, wonderful.

2207
02:57:17,455 --> 02:57:18,316
[SPEAKER_18]: A Dark Child moment.

2208
02:57:18,356 --> 02:57:19,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Just what I wanted.

2209
02:57:20,438 --> 02:57:22,519
[SPEAKER_18]: That had nothing to do with video games at all.

2210
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:23,440
[SPEAKER_24]: Play another clip.

2211
02:57:23,460 --> 02:57:25,402
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell's wrong with our show?

2212
02:57:25,542 --> 02:57:25,822
What the hell?

2213
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,403
[SPEAKER_16]: We need the random episode clip button.

2214
02:57:29,603 --> 02:57:34,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like Conan has the random clips of Walker Texas Ranger.

2215
02:57:35,089 --> 02:57:38,072
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to have... We need to do that.

2216
02:57:38,753 --> 02:57:40,094
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that would be awesome.

2217
02:57:40,114 --> 02:57:40,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Play another random.

2218
02:57:40,915 --> 02:57:42,437
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going through old episodes.

2219
02:57:42,617 --> 02:57:43,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, fine.

2220
02:57:43,598 --> 02:57:45,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's another random clip of episode 111.

2221
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:46,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Of other stuff.

2222
02:57:47,042 --> 02:57:47,903
[SPEAKER_18]: I was kind of surprised.

2223
02:57:48,807 --> 02:57:54,271
[SPEAKER_18]: One vote over Echo Image and one vote, or I'm sorry, two votes over DM Assure.

2224
02:57:54,291 --> 02:57:56,653
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a very, very close cage match tonight.

2225
02:57:56,693 --> 02:57:57,774
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell was I talking about?

2226
02:57:57,834 --> 02:57:59,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Tune in Thursday to find out.

2227
02:57:59,535 --> 02:58:00,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Cage match!

2228
02:58:00,796 --> 02:58:01,737
[SPEAKER_18]: And we know it's a cage match.

2229
02:58:02,858 --> 02:58:03,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2230
02:58:04,699 --> 02:58:06,861
[SPEAKER_18]: So the episode exists, I just suck.

2231
02:58:09,983 --> 02:58:10,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2232
02:58:11,824 --> 02:58:12,385
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um...

2233
02:58:13,496 --> 02:58:13,896
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

2234
02:58:13,936 --> 02:58:14,977
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all the questions we got.

2235
02:58:14,997 --> 02:58:16,838
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's fine because it's time to wrap up the show.

2236
02:58:16,878 --> 02:58:19,640
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to close the old Orange Lounge Radio mailbag.

2237
02:58:24,763 --> 02:58:25,764
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was us closing the bag.

2238
02:58:26,184 --> 02:58:27,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, did we ever check the email?

2239
02:58:27,205 --> 02:58:28,606
[SPEAKER_18]: The old school Yahoo email?

2240
02:58:29,626 --> 02:58:31,848
[SPEAKER_18]: I check it once in a great while.

2241
02:58:33,469 --> 02:58:34,449
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll open it up right now.

2242
02:58:40,478 --> 02:58:42,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Like an F you for something Loki said.

2243
02:58:42,818 --> 02:58:43,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see what messages we got.

2244
02:58:44,019 --> 02:58:47,699
[SPEAKER_18]: We said, good news, weight loss, 14% reduction of fat.

2245
02:58:48,119 --> 02:58:49,320
[SPEAKER_24]: Have bigger cock.

2246
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:51,740
[SPEAKER_18]: Something makes me cry when I am moved.

2247
02:58:53,820 --> 02:58:56,041
[SPEAKER_18]: And another one that says, happy face.

2248
02:58:56,121 --> 02:58:58,441
[SPEAKER_18]: My sister used to tell me life is full of happiness.

2249
02:59:00,542 --> 02:59:01,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing in the goddamn email.

2250
02:59:02,762 --> 02:59:04,823
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't even get a penis enlargement, Neil?

2251
02:59:05,043 --> 02:59:07,323
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know, something makes me cry when I am moved.

2252
02:59:08,953 --> 02:59:09,913
[SPEAKER_18]: I was reading some webcomic, Rob.

2253
02:59:09,933 --> 02:59:17,517
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember which one it was, the someone accepting spam mail because they hate the world and want more to come.

2254
02:59:38,274 --> 02:59:39,215
[SPEAKER_09]: That was completely random.

2255
02:59:41,438 --> 02:59:42,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go check my laundry.

2256
02:59:42,759 --> 02:59:43,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, sounds good.

2257
02:59:43,701 --> 02:59:44,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we're going to wrap up the show.

2258
02:59:44,762 --> 02:59:45,583
[SPEAKER_18]: Come back, come back, come back.

2259
02:59:46,063 --> 02:59:47,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you have to give us your final thought.

2260
02:59:48,246 --> 02:59:48,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2261
02:59:50,329 --> 02:59:50,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Do it.

2262
02:59:51,069 --> 02:59:51,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Final thought.

2263
02:59:52,637 --> 02:59:54,418
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can't hear my thoughts.

2264
02:59:54,599 --> 02:59:58,862
[SPEAKER_09]: None of you are... None of you are psycho and have ESPN.

2265
02:59:58,962 --> 03:00:01,804
[SPEAKER_18]: Then just tell them to tune in Tuesday since we didn't do the plug.

2266
03:00:01,844 --> 03:00:03,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do a radio show on Tuesday.

2267
03:00:04,506 --> 03:00:06,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And listen on... I never knew that.

2268
03:00:06,688 --> 03:00:08,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob... Rob... What?

2269
03:00:08,229 --> 03:00:08,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob... What?

2270
03:00:08,929 --> 03:00:10,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob... What?

2271
03:00:10,791 --> 03:00:12,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Twice in one show, damn.

2272
03:00:13,052 --> 03:00:13,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob...

2273
03:00:15,365 --> 03:00:18,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I do pump up the volume on Tuesday night.

2274
03:00:19,008 --> 03:00:26,454
[SPEAKER_09]: If you tune in at 7 o'clock, sometimes a little bit earlier, you can listen to the pre-show.

2275
03:00:26,474 --> 03:00:28,035
[SPEAKER_09]: 7.30 starts the real show.

2276
03:00:28,876 --> 03:00:32,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be a request show, but that hasn't really happened all that much anymore.

2277
03:00:32,339 --> 03:00:33,920
[SPEAKER_09]: People, you know, sometimes make requests.

2278
03:00:34,340 --> 03:00:38,043
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said I'd choose to marathon things, and the marathon for this week will be Rammstein.

2279
03:00:38,944 --> 03:00:43,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm probably going to throw in, like, old video game music, because I feel like it.

2280
03:00:45,583 --> 03:00:46,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So, tune in.

2281
03:00:46,884 --> 03:00:49,626
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if I get bored again like I did last week, I'll go till midnight.

2282
03:00:50,146 --> 03:00:54,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I played Eddie Izzard and a bunch of other stuff afterwards.

2283
03:00:55,049 --> 03:00:59,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, no, last week actually was the 80s marathon, which I actually do those every couple of months.

2284
03:01:00,532 --> 03:01:03,494
[SPEAKER_09]: So, be thinking of what you want to listen to, though.

2285
03:01:03,774 --> 03:01:04,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play whatever.

2286
03:01:05,836 --> 03:01:14,001
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are part of our LiveJournal community, Orange Lounge LiveJournal, you can also put in there things that you'd like to hear on the show.

2287
03:01:23,266 --> 03:01:27,050
[SPEAKER_16]: I was thinking of weird things to make remixes of earlier today.

2288
03:01:27,451 --> 03:01:33,958
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things I downloaded, which I gotta mess around with because I think it'd be funny, is to make a dance remix to the Shaft theme.

2289
03:01:35,520 --> 03:01:36,601
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that would work.

2290
03:01:36,954 --> 03:01:37,474
[SPEAKER_16]: I got you a record.

2291
03:01:37,514 --> 03:01:38,755
[SPEAKER_16]: I got you, what was that group?

2292
03:01:38,775 --> 03:01:39,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Guitar... Wolf.

2293
03:01:39,095 --> 03:01:39,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Guitar Wolf.

2294
03:02:03,724 --> 03:02:04,786
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a bunch of records.

2295
03:02:05,006 --> 03:02:14,977
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to go through my big pile of mid-90s R&B and I need to figure out what I want to keep and what I want to get rid of because I'm trying to take that big pile I have that's just sitting there.

2296
03:02:16,214 --> 03:02:24,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I have one record now, one left.

2297
03:02:24,757 --> 03:02:30,598
[SPEAKER_09]: All my other ones are in Alabama, but Dan and I actually bought Weird Al's Even Worse on vinyl.

2298
03:02:30,898 --> 03:02:36,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I need to like just, because there's a lot of records out there, I need to figure out how to mix on vinyl.

2299
03:02:36,200 --> 03:02:39,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And once I do that, then I'll be probably more opted to...

2300
03:02:40,001 --> 03:02:42,264
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll make you a database I just need to know how to learn how to mix

2301
03:02:57,677 --> 03:02:58,578
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty much what I need to do.

2302
03:02:58,878 --> 03:03:01,379
[SPEAKER_16]: I can do parties, you know, where you just crossfade shit over.

2303
03:03:01,420 --> 03:03:02,460
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a piece of cake.

2304
03:03:02,900 --> 03:03:08,544
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's a matter of, like, you know, being an actual true DJ and being able to beatmatch and stuff and mix that way.

2305
03:03:08,564 --> 03:03:14,308
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a little different than being a wedding DJ where you just play 80s shit and crossfade over.

2306
03:03:14,328 --> 03:03:17,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, this is the sequel to The Wedding Singer's The Wedding DJ.

2307
03:03:19,191 --> 03:03:23,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, seriously, I could DJ, like, really shitty, like, adult parties and stuff, you know?

2308
03:03:24,275 --> 03:03:24,735
[SPEAKER_16]: But, like,

2309
03:03:25,567 --> 03:03:31,893
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't really actually be able to do cool professional DJ stuff and mix shit together.

2310
03:03:33,554 --> 03:03:35,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now I have a program that helps me with that.

2311
03:03:35,576 --> 03:03:40,280
[SPEAKER_16]: I can do it visually, but I can't do it audio.

2312
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:42,541
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a problem.

2313
03:03:44,203 --> 03:03:44,903
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my final thought.

2314
03:03:46,965 --> 03:03:47,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Bradley, you have a final thought?

2315
03:03:49,547 --> 03:03:53,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Since I don't have very much to say, I'll just read random words from the posters on the wall.

2316
03:03:54,898 --> 03:03:56,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Redundant, nicer, yummy, pin-up action.

2317
03:03:58,060 --> 03:03:58,521
[SPEAKER_18]: Very nice.

2318
03:03:59,261 --> 03:04:03,404
[SPEAKER_18]: And my final thought is, I'm trying to keep this short because I have somewhere else to be right now.

2319
03:04:03,444 --> 03:04:05,646
[SPEAKER_18]: So, thank you very much for listening, everybody.

2323
03:04:10,189 --> 03:04:13,232
[SPEAKER_09]: My final word of the show is vodka.

03:04:14,352 --> 03:04:19,236

2335
03:07:03,274 --> 03:07:04,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Filling up a post-show?

2336
03:07:04,775 --> 03:07:05,456

03:07:08,259 --> 03:07:09,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, shit.

2338
03:07:10,521 --> 03:07:17,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what I've been doing lately is I've been downloading some music, because, you know, I did buy stuff.

2339
03:07:17,937 --> 03:07:18,877
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought music.

2340
03:07:19,017 --> 03:07:26,680
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyways, this is one of the songs that I bought the other day, which is from BT.

2341
03:07:26,740 --> 03:07:31,301
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're just going to kill time by playing a BT song because it'll be fun.

2342
03:07:31,401 --> 03:07:32,602
[SPEAKER_16]: And everybody loves BT.

2343
03:07:32,642 --> 03:07:33,442
[SPEAKER_16]: BT rocks.

2344
03:07:33,762 --> 03:07:36,063

03:07:37,442 --> 03:07:37,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy!

2348
03:07:57,281 --> 03:07:58,361
[SPEAKER_16]: A little bit different from BT.

2349
03:07:58,642 --> 03:07:59,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, actually, no, screw that.

2350
03:07:59,962 --> 03:08:00,622
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not playing that one.

2351
03:08:00,962 --> 03:08:01,103
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2352
03:08:01,723 --> 03:08:01,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Better.

2353
03:08:01,963 --> 03:08:10,646
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do the Crystal Method, Keep Hope Alive, BT's Creatine Method mix, and we're going to play a little bit of that because that's seven minutes long and we don't need to play the whole thing.

2354
03:08:10,746 --> 03:08:10,886
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

2355
03:08:27,874 --> 03:08:28,135

Thanks for watching!

2358
03:11:32,222 --> 03:11:32,862
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was fun.

2359
03:11:34,884 --> 03:11:35,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it was.

2360
03:11:35,964 --> 03:11:40,427
[SPEAKER_18]: I have kind of a special treat for you guys tonight for some real post-show music.

2361
03:11:40,447 --> 03:11:44,749
[SPEAKER_18]: We're actually going to be doing a whole bunch of music for my personal MP3 collection.

2362
03:11:45,310 --> 03:11:46,010
[SPEAKER_18]: That should be fun.

2363
03:11:46,751 --> 03:11:47,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Right?

2364
03:11:47,631 --> 03:11:47,911
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

2365
03:11:48,652 --> 03:11:49,052
[SPEAKER_18]: Say yes.

2366
03:11:50,623 --> 03:11:52,144
[SPEAKER_18]: Because everybody loves my taste in music.

2367
03:11:52,204 --> 03:11:53,525
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but there's a lot of fun stuff in here.

2368
03:11:54,105 --> 03:11:55,185
[SPEAKER_18]: So I hope you guys enjoy it.

2369
03:11:55,926 --> 03:11:57,987
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still trying to get the last few songs in here.

2370
03:11:58,087 --> 03:12:06,951
[SPEAKER_18]: But I did want to say, definitely keep checking out our website over at www.orangelandredo.com Next week's show, very good chance that it's going to be taped next week.

2371
03:12:07,052 --> 03:12:11,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Because some of us have other things we are already committed to for next weekend.

2372
03:12:12,314 --> 03:12:15,396
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're not going to be able to probably be here live on Sunday night.

2373
03:12:15,416 --> 03:12:17,357
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll probably have some kind of tape show going on.

2374
03:12:17,997 --> 03:12:46,445
[SPEAKER_18]: look for details on our website also I forgot to mention this during the show but that Akira Yamaoka contest we're going to have to delay another week because there's some stuff going on we just want to make sure we do the damn thing right so we need to delay for another week so sorry guys and that's about it all the details on that will be coming to the website very soon as well and that's going to be very cool and yes Loki

2375
03:12:47,805 --> 03:12:54,248
[SPEAKER_16]: and soon, or maybe a little later on, we will be doing more contests and more giveaways.

2376
03:12:54,828 --> 03:12:56,169
[SPEAKER_16]: The prize being anime movies.

2377
03:12:56,509 --> 03:12:56,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

2378
03:12:57,270 --> 03:13:01,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I have like fucking ten plus cases of anime movies in my closet I need to get rid of.

2379
03:13:02,792 --> 03:13:04,013
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a lot of anime.

2380
03:13:04,053 --> 03:13:06,074
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have like another two cases at work.

2381
03:13:06,654 --> 03:13:08,975
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, there'll be anime giveaways.

2382
03:13:11,816 --> 03:13:13,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, she watched the book and matches.

2383
03:13:14,838 --> 03:13:15,358
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, the

2384
03:13:15,796 --> 03:13:18,138
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll be, uh, we'll figure out some stuff with that later.

2385
03:13:18,398 --> 03:13:20,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe, uh, I don't know, we'll figure stuff out.

2386
03:13:21,541 --> 03:13:24,243
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, too bad I don't have any more porn to give away.

2387
03:13:25,444 --> 03:13:26,085
[SPEAKER_16]: That I don't have.

2388
03:13:27,126 --> 03:13:29,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember your Make Edit Get Porn contest?

2389
03:13:29,548 --> 03:13:30,889
[SPEAKER_16]: That was, like, the best thing ever.

2390
03:13:31,910 --> 03:13:42,659
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the greatest contest ever, and I remember who won it, and it was great because, you know, when he, um, came over, it was, like, all, like, kinda, here, put it in the bag, put it in the bag.

2391
03:13:44,727 --> 03:13:54,790
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was like a whole 50 tapes of, you know, Playboy and softcore porn.

2392
03:13:55,431 --> 03:13:56,231
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was great.

2393
03:13:57,011 --> 03:14:00,172
[SPEAKER_16]: But MakeEditGetPorn, that was a contest that was wonderful.

2394
03:14:00,192 --> 03:14:08,135
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll have to do something similar like that one day, you know, MakeRemixGetPorn or, you know, something like that.

2395
03:14:09,356 --> 03:14:09,916
[SPEAKER_16]: But, later.

2396
03:14:10,016 --> 03:14:10,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Later.

2397
03:14:11,431 --> 03:14:14,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that would be bigger than any remix contest out there right now.

2398
03:14:14,612 --> 03:14:16,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Make remix get porn.

2399
03:14:16,113 --> 03:14:19,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell me that would not be humongously popular in the Bomani scene.

2400
03:14:19,654 --> 03:14:20,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on.

2401
03:14:20,314 --> 03:14:20,934
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got to do it.

2402
03:14:22,675 --> 03:14:23,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of the Bomani scene is under 18.

2403
03:14:25,876 --> 03:14:26,756
[SPEAKER_16]: But, yeah.

2404
03:14:28,337 --> 03:14:30,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Make edit get softcore porn?

2405
03:14:32,638 --> 03:14:33,538
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still under 18.

2406
03:14:33,578 --> 03:14:33,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2407
03:14:39,093 --> 03:14:40,094
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be interesting.

2408
03:14:40,134 --> 03:14:40,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Make remix, get porn.

2409
03:14:40,874 --> 03:14:41,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I'm ready for a post show now.
