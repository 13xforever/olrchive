Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words,

9
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:50,360
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity, Orange Lounge may contain plenty of b-b-b-cocky.

10
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,920
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

11
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
In this episode...

12
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,400

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,700
We are live!

16
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:33,640
And this is episode number 114 for this October the 3rd of 2004.

17
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:41,940
You're tuned in to the Internet's most diverse radio station of all things, B-Imani.

18
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
My name is Rob Roberts.

19
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,980
You might know me as Sky.

20
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,020
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

21
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,020
farm.

22
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,020
Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, Starks, after all.

23
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
You know what?

24
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,020
When you were trying to think of a description, you don't want to know the things that just went through my head.

25
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,020
What went through your head? I want to know.

26
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
You know what went through my head?

27
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,020
Nerves, blood, brain matter, that went through my head.

28
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,020
Oh my!

29
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,020
And in that corner, futzing with our webcam or something, our tech massa Loki.

30
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Yes, I am futzing as you call it with the webcam.

31
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,740
We actually have an extra special treat for our listeners tonight.

32
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,220
We have a brand new webcam angle, just for tonight, because it's only the three of us,

33
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,940
so there's no guests to focus on.

34
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,780
So you get to see Loki and me this time on the webcam, the whole show, and our really

35
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,140
dirty work area, which I'm almost embarrassed to have on the cam, but I don't care.

36
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
Let the world know!

37
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,140
I don't care.

38
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,180
I can't put my feet on the webcam anymore.

39
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,180
You could still get to, oh, we do have a guest after all.

40
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
Hi!

41
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
Oh!

42
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,340
That's alright, we'll keep the webcam angle this way, that's right.

43
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,180
Say hello to Arcadian42, Bradley just showed up.

44
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,900
Hi.

45
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,580
Oh, we appreciate Arcadian's presence, even though we did think we were going to have

46
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,500
a guest free show, but that's alright.

47
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,340
Alright, well we certainly have some Bimani news to talk about tonight, believe it or

48
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
not, and randomness.

49
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,460
I assure you there's plenty of randomness tonight.

50
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,460
You okay?

51
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460
I hate jalapenos.

52
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,860
Why am I eating them?

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,620
Yes, Jamie is starting off the show in her traditional manner by eating tonight.

54
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,580
Hey, I haven't had dinner, okay?

55
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,180
We don't have any food at my house.

56
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,500
I totally porked out before tonight's show.

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,820
I ate so much food, I just...

58
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,780
I've had low-carb chocolate truffles.

59
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,780
Three of them.

60
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,380
And half a double bag.

61
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,500
I had skinny crust pizza from Round Table.

62
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,660
Not that I'm on a diet or anything, I just really like the skinny crust pizza.

63
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,660
I like New York pizza, which is pretty much very similar, very skinny crust.

64
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,660
God, Loki's going to kill himself trying to rig his webcam.

65
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Maybe his portal to hell will open up.

66
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Maybe. Alright. And take him home to his people.

67
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,660
Lots of randomness tonight. I know I've

68
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,660
got a couple random things I want to talk about, and who knows what else.

69
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,660
We have some news that we missed last week, because Extreme was the big news last week.

70
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,100
news we kind of miss that I want to get to and I know I want to get pissed off

71
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,520
at some point tonight actually I have something I'm kind of pissed off about I

72
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,320
want to rant about later and well I'm sure you guys are feeling some anger too

73
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,600
so we'll definitely have a nephew of the week segment cage match and all your

74
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,940
favorite stuff when we come back from this break featuring some music from

75
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,480
DDR extreme USA but songs have already been in DDR before but they're fun songs

76
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,800
we're playing them again in Extreme USA so enjoy and we'll be back won't we Dark

80
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,000

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,840
there with a keyboard in her lap the whole time ever since look you got that

82
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
wireless keyboard.

83
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Dude, this thing is awesome.

84
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,380
I just can be the babysitter all night, that's so cool.

85
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,520
So come be disciplined by DarkSakura on our channel.

86
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,400
You know you want it.

87
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,160
It's just like you said in the very first episode of Orange on the Radio, I'll never

88
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,600
forget this, is that you were ranting about parents at Golfland, and you said, I remember

89
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,640
the quote, you said something like, if you're not going to do your job, god damn it, I will.

90
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,640
The parents don't want me to do their job.

91
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
I would be a scary mom.

92
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Alright.

93
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Also, we've got the new Ultra Mix 2 song.

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
We'll play that for you at some point tonight.

95
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
And it's a previous Cage Match winner.

96
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,640
I believe it was picked by Dark Sakura.

97
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Huh?

98
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute.

99
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,080
all right we'll be back

100
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
The mic will sing soon as I touch it

101
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,140
Dude, it's smooth and easy like

102
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,140
So we might get hyped to hear tonight

103
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Be nice, relax, and see from the back

104
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,640
If you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap

105
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
That can smack this mouth whoops if they jack

106
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,140
You're gonna suck no crap

107
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,140
Giving a little bit of heart and soul as we do it

108
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,140
Till you in your ear hole, huh

109
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,140
I ain't going out like a sucker

110
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,140
And if you think so, poison pucker up

111
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,640
And chip the butter that's lyricist

112
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,140
Blow the mic word up this groove

113
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,640
That can soothe you

114
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Now it's time to do it!

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,120

Whoa, whoa, whoa, now here we go.

Start the party, start the show.

So pick yourself high in the line, but don't stare, it's party time.

Kiss you like

121
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Can't get why you just won't care

122
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Every woman, every man

123
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Huh, huh, huh, huh

124
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Get up, get up, get up, get up

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
You wanna kick the jam, man?

126

You wanna kick the jam, kick the jam, kick the jam, man?

127
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800

128

Don't try to stop me, don't let up and go Don't block me, don't beat me, don't block

Don't try to stop me, don't let up and yell

133
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Don't watch me

134
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Carving like a nutcracker, crushes a nut

135
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
This is survival for my rival when I'm on the cut

136
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm staying in your memory like the date of your birth

137
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Back then you're like Gatorade when I'm quitching my curve

138
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm the back of the ladder and you're the stable

139
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I'll catch you like my DJ cuts a record on the table

140
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I wanna fly, get off the battleground, you're no map for the gods

141
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I could beat you down like a star, I'll put you in a muggle

142
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I'll break you in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle

143
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,100
and I'll murder your style, I'm the one doing the same, yeah, you are a tribe

144
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,540
I'm conducting, arranged, putting all my in place,

145
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
Form a line such as so you can bleed your key

146
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,040
I wanna rock!

147
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,360
So beat, just rock me, don't try to stop me

148
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,780
Don't wait up in, yo, don't clock me up deep

149
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,780
Just rock me, don't try to stop me, yo

150
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:39,540
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on the air.

151
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,640
And uh, whatever happened to Step Squad?

152
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
I haven't heard you talk about them in a while, Jamie.

153
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,000
I haven't heard, hardly heard from anybody lately, it's just, I, you know, I've been

154
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,560
so busy that it's hard to keep up with anyone.

155
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
I talked to, uh...

156
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,920
You have to explain what Step Squad, because we have a lot of new people that only started

157
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,400
listening a couple months ago and we started giving, you know, exclusive hints and stuff,

158
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,400
now people start listening to us, so explain for those that don't know what Step Squad

159
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
is all about.

160
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,100
squad was established to sort of combat some of the I guess more negative

161
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,720
aspects of the whole DDR team business that was going on. It's basically just people who

162
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:32,000
were... Owned Stu! Owned Stu more. I pwn you. Pwned! That's so stupid. Anyway, anyway it was more or

163
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,620
less just an attempt to to you know show more the some of the more positive

164
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,000
aspects or group of people who would I guess embody those type of what the hell

165
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,700
are you doing God anyway it was supposed to be more or less the whole positive

166
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:56,300
aspect of what a DDR community could be like anyway I haven't hardly though

167
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,100
heard from anybody because we're all busy busy people and I'm going to school

176
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
It's the resolution on your monitor.

177
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
My goddamn monitor sucks.

178
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Yes it does.

179
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I know.

180
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Hey, I can't go up any higher.

181
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Uh, how to fix that?

182
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
You need to get a new monitor.

183
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I don't need to get a new monitor, I just need to turn the gamma up.

184
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Degas it.

185
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Oh, fine, I'll do it anyways.

186
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
That's fine.

187
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Okay.

188
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
You were talking?

189
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
No one was paying attention, so I just stopped.

190
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,000
It was about Step Squad and how cool we are.

191
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,200
Give me the damn mic.

192
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,800
Damn, he's like hoarding the mic over here. I'm not gonna let Rob have it. We can't have a show

193
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,360
tonight.

194
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,960
No, Rob, you don't get to talk. Alright.

195
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,960
We're gonna get duct tape for you. Yeah. Anyway, I have to tease

196
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,400
something. I'm gonna tease something. We have a sequel

197
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,400
to a classic Orange Lounge Radio inside joke

198
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,520
coming up a sequel we're all about the internet yes remember sequels they

199
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
always have a bigger budget

200
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,720
and they're always much better just kidding they're actually over the

201
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,400
television

202
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,280
you should the third one usually ends up better yeah well we do have the sequel

203
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,680
in a minute after how was your week how was your day of course

204
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,880
we start off all episodes of Warren's Laundrio Dark Sakura how was your week how was your day

205
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,040
my week consisted of work and school

206
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,360
because guess what I have no life

207
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,360
All I do is go to work and all I do is go to school and go to the track and go to the gym.

208
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:26,360
I went to spin and I was so happy because I was so pissed off and mad at the world on Friday that I went to spin and had a fun time.

209
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Worked out all that aggression.

210
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,360
But nothing really major happened this week.

211
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,360
I'm getting Sims 2, which is going to make me happy and I'll have even less free time.

212
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I'm also training somebody at work, and I've got a few more changes in mind in my chosen field.

213
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Different things at work going on. I'm not really going to go into too much detail about it,

214
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,360
but there may be some changes afoot in the next couple of months.

215
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,360
alright I went to a party last night

216
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,840
you know me I'm such the party girl

217
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,080
but I ended up because I was just gonna go

218
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,360
hang out and do whatever. What was the occasion?

219
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,480
Random. Just random party? It was like

220
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,800
oh my god we're bored. Let's have a party. Alright it works.

221
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,920
But I was over at Iguana Girl's house

222
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,640
and oh my god moo is female. We didn't know what gender moo was

223
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Because iguanas take a year before you get to the other side of the room.

224
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,720
what I was saying I just decided that I was gonna participate and you know not

225
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,220
be a pooper so I had 12 jello shots

226
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,120
remember kids orange lawns radio wants you to drink responsibly I didn't drive

227
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,980
I called I called Dan oh wait it see that that's that's the classic double

228
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,840
standard I love about this culture it's always you know be sure that if you

229
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,560
drive you drink responsibly now if you didn't drive get fucked up nobody cares

230
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,960
you just get fucked up it's your liver once you got your keys in the ball you

231
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,040
can get fucked up my keys are in my purse I knew better but I ended up

232
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:53,040
having 12 jello shots because it was all low-carb stuff so vodka is low-carb so I

233
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,960
had we had it with the sugar-free jello so I had 12 of them because I have this

234
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:05,640
thing for vodka I don't feel it until after I'm done with it um I also had a

235
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,120
couple glasses of this cranberry vodka beverage and then this cranberry and

236
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:19,640
orange liqueur beverage and something else and lots of meat I was in happy

237
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:28,640
boos meet heaven. What? That is so like a quintessential quote for you now. I was in

238
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:38,100
happy boos meet heaven. Okay. Please somebody note the date and time. Thank you. We have

239

240
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,200

241
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:54,000
you anyway I also put some more thought into my I'm actually one of my classes I

242
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,920
finished all the homework for I'm very happy another one I have one more week

243
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,640
of assignments and I'm done with that class hallelujah praise the Lord no more

244
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,320
databases I spent four hours freaking working on a database today it's up

245
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,040
cheese well I was also chatting with people to which I thought was more

246
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,200
important than doing my homework but that was that was really it I'm gonna go

247
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,320
ahead and try to get the other one done Thursday ahead of time just go ahead and

248
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,240
get it out of the way stop putting it off although procrastination is pretty

249
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:34,960
fun anyway that was my week my day oh yeah I passed out at 1130 and woke up at

250
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,280
630 in the morning and guess what you sound like me at a party no I I just I

251
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,360
I just decided I was randomly sleepy and I actually did consciously go to bed.

252
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,840
And then next thing I know, it's six in the morning.

253
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,480
I am wide awake and not hungover.

254
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,880
See, I don't think I would even drink so badly.

255
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,760
We should have went to church today.

256
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Bite me!

257
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,280
Excuse me, I don't know.

258
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,040
But no.

259
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:14,840
I ended up wide awake not in the least hungover and then that's when I ate that chocolate.

260
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,920
I don't think that I would have, I think that I would not drink as wildly as I do on the

261
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:27,560
rare times that I do because I don't have any consequences other than my liver going

262
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
woo alcohol.

263
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,920
I just don't get hungover.

264
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:39,960
from you coming from a long line of beer drinking you know not me I don't like

265
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,200
beer oh my god somebody else talk I'm tired all right fine we'll move on to

266
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,560
somebody else's weekend day okay how was your week how was your day my week was

267
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:58,240
okay I was mainly hobbling around still a little better now my toe is kind of

268
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,440
ugly looking at although I do think that somehow there's like an infection under

269
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:12,380
my cuticle cuz it's still kind of poofy and a little bit of pussy and so yeah

270
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,860
I'll probably do that but I mean other than that no it doesn't really hurt my

271
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,880
other toe hurts now though because the nails kind of long on it and I just

272
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,100
accidentally kicked into the desk and that's not fun but no this week I saw a

273
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:31,860
ton of movies I saw sharks tail because it was free and that was okay and then I

274
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,260
I saw The Forgotten, which, if anyone's seen the trailer, you know what the movie's about.

275
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,740
Literally, you know what the movie's about. You've already seen the entire recording of

276
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,840
the movie. And then I watched Ju-On, which is, for those who don't know it, the Japanese

277
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,480
version of the movie coming out called The Grudge. And if you've seen that movie, then

278
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,560
you've seen The Grudge already, because it's pretty much, from what I've seen on the trailers,

279
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,300
exactly the same shot. You know what? I have to say something about that. Now, the trailer

280
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,060
for Ringu and the Ring had all the same identical scenes, and there was a lot different about

281
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,260
movies. Well, the only thing that's going to be different, I think, is one, it's probably

282
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,540
going to be linear, because Ju-On was fucking hard to follow. He just kept skipping around

283
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,320
and was like, what the hell? That's just Japanese cinema. What the hell is going on here? But,

284
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,880
My only complaint about it is, how can people be that dumb to walk into a haunted house

285
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
like constantly?

286
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,840
They're like, yeah, so we know that every single person that's gone through this house

287
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,640
has disappeared, so I'm gonna go inside that house!

288
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Save on the, uh, tax.

289
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,560
And then at the very end of the movie, they like show something that's kinda, I guess

290
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,600
would be like a way to ward off whatever it is.

291
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,240
And then like, not even 30 seconds later, another ghost comes, and the woman doesn't

292
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,480
do the thing that ward off the first one

293
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,440
and then she disappears

294
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,200
oh how can you not see that

295
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,660
uh... then i watch battlefield baseball which is fucking awesome

296
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,620
it's like shaolin sakur with baseball but it is crazy because

297
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,760
the main character doesn't play baseball anymore because he killed

298
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,880
his father with

299
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,160
his fast pitch it was so fast it went through him

300
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:24,640
and kill them and then they sung a song about it. That was the best thing. Best thing ever.

301
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,560
But it's great though because there's like people that are getting impaled on shit. There's

302
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,720
like this whole team that look like they're full of zombies or whatever but they're not.

303
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,160
They're just these really weird people. And this guy that looks like the mask with, or

304
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,440
he looks like an Australian version of the mask. He's on the other team with like the

305
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,440
the head coach and there's this, like all these people keep getting killed, oh there's

306
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,040
this one guy who keeps getting killed throughout the movie and every time he comes back as

307
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,840
a different person with the same haircut. It's just quite weird. But um, so that was

308
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,240
a cool movie. And then other than that I got um, I don't know, I played my Final Fantasy

309
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,960
And I bought some new CDs. I bought Steven Lynch's CD, and he's funny.

310
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:34,280
And then BT, Ten Years in the Life, and that was a compilation of his best works, plus some new stuff I haven't heard of BT, and remixes that he did, including a Crystal Method remix that he did, and that was kinda cool.

311
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:45,280
And other than that, really not all that much went on, just a little bit of movies, and hobbling, and still didn't finish the device, working on it.

312
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Oh, and I got Sims 2 and I was torturing Sims. That was fun.

313
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:59,280
The only thing about that game, though, is that it has really slow fires. Like, I started a fire in my kitchen, and it took it about two days to finally get across the kitchen.

314
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,080
because you know it's cool because the fire department can't come even though I

315
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,220
have smoke detectors because I have a moat around my house and there's no way

316
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:13,460
in or out but if you're interested in what I thought about the sims 2 you can

317
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,820
check out my review on orangesonsradio.com which we have reviews for other

318
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,380
games on there too. Yeah actually Jason and I are talking about plans to try and

319
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,660
expand the review section a little later too because I want to do a full review

320
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,100
of DDR Extreme, although I am going to have a mini-review of DDR Extreme showing up in

321
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,300
the very near future somewhere else, so maybe we'll talk about that later, I don't know.

322
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:43,220
Anything else you want to share about your weekend today?

323
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,420
I don't think so, no, that's it.

324
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,620
Alright, Bradley, how was your week, how was your day?

325
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:57,620
It was pretty boring, it worked, finally submitted my last thing for temp, worked,

326
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,020
So now I'm permanent in the company, finally.

327
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,920
Woo-hoo!

328
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Yay.

329
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,420
Ooh, clap, clap, clap.

330
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,620
Then Wednesday, listen to the debate, mostly,

331
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,020
because it was like the first time I turned on my TV

332
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,140
to actually watch TV in, like, 33 months.

333
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,580
And it was on every channel.

334
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,080
What?

335
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,420
And it was on every channel.

336
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,220
Something like that.

337
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,740
It was, like, behind me, and I was listening to it most

338
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,420
while I was playing on the computer.

339
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,820
And then after that, not much.

340
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,340
This weekend, it didn't do very much.

341
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:34,740
Did my state taxes, oh boy, woohoo, cuz again wait like till October if you don't owe anything

342
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,740
and that's about it, right on, exciting.

343
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,540
My week and my day, like Jamie I was kind of a party animal this weekend, I went to

344
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,220
a party Friday night, my friend John had a birthday so I went over to his house for a

345
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,660
birthday party and I went with a bunch of my friends, unfortunately I didn't really

346
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,220
get a chance to drink a whole lot, I did like a shot or two but I didn't get quite as

347
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,820
comfortable as Jamie did at the party she went to, but it was a good time. I met a lot

348
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,720
of really nice new people. I met this one girl who was really into anime, like she seemed

349
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,660
like she'd be somebody who might like this show, so hopefully I remembered to plug the

350
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,580
show with her, but I don't remember. Anyway, and just, you know, a lot of cool people there,

351
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:21,580
and we just had a good time laughing, hanging out, and then yesterday I actually decided

352
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,720
to drive to my old hometown. I lived there for three years, where I went to school in

353
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,000
in Chico, California, which is about an hour north, about an hour and a half north of Sacramento

354
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,160
where this show is based, which is a little college town. There really isn't anything

355
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,840
in Chico, California except a college and retired people, so it's this interesting mix

356
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,600
of people. But I had myself a good time. I never really enjoyed the place while I lived

357
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,260
there, but now that I'm just a visitor, I actually have a lot of fun every time I go.

358
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,100
I went to this bar and I actually got a little drunk, which wasn't a good idea since I had

359
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,980
driven so I had to like wait around till like 2 or 3 a.m. so I could sober up but

360
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,700
we went to this bar and I just danced like crazy I don't know what it was I

361
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,180
was just totally dancing like crazy like flailing my arms about and jumping and

362
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,220
then like I saw this like this guy and this girl were dancing next to me and

363
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,740
the girl at one point like hopped up on the guy's shoulders and the guy was like

364
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,220
doing all these dirty things to the girl then the girl started like leaning back

365
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:28,260
like it was a really bad scene like out of the pool scene in showgirls seriously

366
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,460
that's what it looked like was the pool scene in showgirls but like on a dance

367
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,060
floor it was something you would see in like an 80s dance from that film or

368
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,540
something I don't know but they were getting cheers and stuff we were like

369
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,800
right next to him so it's kind of weird and you know I don't know how often you

370
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,260
guys go to dance clubs but it is it still humors me to this day when they

371
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,940
play like DDR music in dance clubs I don't know why that is but I find it

372
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,380
really humorous and like I remember they played sandstorm was one song they play

373
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,020
and I was like I'll dance into that and they had played better off alone which

374
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,500
isn't a DDR song but it really should be you know yeah so I was having a good

375
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:13,380
time so not that I actually dance like DDR because that really is not the point

376
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,060
but you know it's still kind of fun and I guess that's really it I just kind of

377
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,140
partied a lot this weekend and I'm going out tonight to a club again so I'm kind

378
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,260
of being a little but tonight I'm going back to the goth club so I cuz I had a

379
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,740
lot of fun last time I was there so I'm going again tonight yes I'm gonna paint

380
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,660
my nails black and look like I've done I know I'm kidding I I I'm just gonna go

381
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:40,700
have fun so you should go back tomorrow after work the goth club and we're like

382
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:47,440
yellow maybe I should go dress like a cheerleader or something actually they

383
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,340
probably think that was cool

384
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,220
give you the evil cheerleader maybe I don't know it's funny you should you

385
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,560
should well I know you you don't like going to dance clubs but if if you like

386
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,360
dance clubs you would like this one maybe I'd have to go sometimes just to

387
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,560
stand in the corner and look you know evil yeah well that's what a lot of

388
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,160
of people do, actually, yeah. You just stand there looking bored. I swear, you just sit

389
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,000
right in. That's like the prerequisite for being goth, you have to be able to stand around

390
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,320
and look bored. And wear lots of black. At least that's how it was with all the people

391
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,280
I hung out with. I remember the goth club, that's where the big hairy guy in the corset

392
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,960
wanted to have sex with me.

393
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,400
What?

394
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,640
We're bears, grrrr.

395
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,160
I thought this movie I saw on Thursday, I went and saw a movie called A Dirty Shame

396
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,400
and for those that know me well at all, I'm a huge John Waters fan. If you don't know

397
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,920
who John Waters is, you should.

398
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,840
He directed Hairspray. Yeah, back before it was a musical but

399
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,920
like Hairspray is like very tame for his movies. I'm talking movies like Pink Flamingos,

400
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,640
Serial Mom, Desperate Living, those are all the ones I really like.

401
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,520
Yeah, I haven't seen Serial Mom.

402
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,400
Oh, you should. Serial Mom's a wonderful movie.

403
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,000
But he has a new movie in theaters called The Dirty Shame, and it's a total sex comedy.

404
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,440
Like, it's NC-17, it is just absolutely perverse.

405
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,000
And I don't know why I was thinking of that movie just now, but I was.

406
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,480
I do recommend it, even though, seriously, like, the last 30 minutes of the film,

407
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,960
whoever wrote the script was, like, so coked up that, like, it makes absolutely no sense.

408
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:29,000
just being honest with you. Okay, on that note, let's go back to our show www.orensonsradio.com

409
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,520
click on chat if you want to join the chat room and of course Skype line will be open

410
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,920
up a little bit later. Click on interact with us if you want to interact with the show.

411
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,040
Now, as promised a little bit earlier, I have the sequel to an inside joke and this is actually

412
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,960
one of our new inside jokes but do you remember a couple weeks ago when we had a little bit

413
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:56,800
of a flub up from Tom Brokaw and he was doing the bukkake thing. Well, it actually came

414
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,860
to my attention. It's actually in the intro. It actually came to my attention at the party

415
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,920
I was at on Friday. For some reason, you know, I was talking about the bukkake thing. I don't

416
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,600
know how it came up. But somebody told me, he said, hey Rob, you know what? That's not

417
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,760
the first time he's done that. He actually flubbed up once before and they told me where

418
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,440
to go. So this is old news. This flub up is like a year old, but I swear it's twice as

419
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,680
funny. So listen to this. It's a little bit long, but listen carefully. Listen carefully

420
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,200
for the mistake.

421
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,320
The President's trip to Ohio today was a bold effort to cash in on his wartime popularity

422
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,200
as he tries to push through his tax cuts. The key component in what the President insists

423
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,240
is a job stimulus program.

424
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.

425
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,640
And as NBC's David Gregory reports tonight,

426
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,400
the president took his message right

427
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,040
to a powerful Ohio Republican

428
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,840
who is not convinced the tax cuts are the answer.

429
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Did you hear that?

430
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,960
My God.

431
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,800
Hold on one more time.

432
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,240
The cops over there doing the little schoolgirl giggle.

433
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,380
one more time over time report tonight the president took his message right to

434
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,960
a powerful ohio republican

435
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,440
who is not convinced the tax cuts

436
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,560
tax cuts

437
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,560
it's funny when serious news people make big mistakes like that i mean

438
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,740
i mean how many times do you hear the word cut on the nightly news seriously

439
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,740
Who has not convinced the tax concert.

440
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,740
That absolutely has nothing to do with Bomani and it has nothing to do with video gaming whatsoever.

441
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,740
It has to do with Rob having a giggle fit.

442
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,740
It's really fucking funny. Like I've thought of that phrase several times today.

443
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,740
Like I'll just be sitting there. I was sitting there at dinner earlier today and I was just eating and then suddenly I just had these images.

444
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,740
Who has not convinced the tax concert.

445
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:10,960
and I started giggling God bless the internet I'll post that sound file on

446
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,720
our forums a little later just like I did the bukkake thing so huh that was

447
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:25,600
beautiful what what what what what what what what what see what I tell you chat

448
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,560
room what do you think was that better than bukkake I think they think so I'm

449
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,000
getting a lot of ha ha ha's so I guess they like that. That's like a year old but I had

450
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,680
never heard of that. I mean it was new to me so I figured it would be new to you guys

451
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,000
too. I didn't hear about that. Maybe you guys did, I don't know.

452
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,760
There are people in the world who do not pay attention to the news.

453
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:52,760
I know, I know. Alright. And in case you don't know what a cunt is, cause it looks like someone

454
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:02,000
in our chat room doesn't know. A cunt is a euphemism for a lady's, um, yeah, anatomy.

455
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Take that as you will. Alright. Let's change topics really quick here before I get into

456
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:14,520
stuff too far. And actually we will do a Bamani related piece here. Actually, Ultramix 2,

457
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,560
there was some brand new news on Ultramix 2 this week. A brand new song was revealed

458
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,800
And the band is Delirium, and the song is called After All, and it's remixed by a couple

459
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,040
guys who did a really popular song in 7th style.

460
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,600
I did do that in a cage match.

461
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,080
And you actually put this song in a cage match one time.

462
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,980
This is the really interesting thing, is now this is the first, now where was the Orange

463
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,840
Lawns Radio cage match based on?

464
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,920
We originally said it was like songs that we want to hear in DDR, and lo and behold,

465
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,120
We have our very first cage match winning song that is now in a DDR game.

466
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
We swear we didn't blow-

467
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
I'm prophetic.

468
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
Huh?

469
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
I'm prophetic.

470
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Yeah.

471
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
We didn't blow anybody at Konami.

472
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
We didn't blow anybody at Konami.

473
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
No, we considered it very strongly.

474
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Yeah.

475
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
We did.

476
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
We did think about it.

477
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
But.

478
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Yeah.

479
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Anyway.

480
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
I want to cue this up.

481
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,740
A little clip of the beauty of silence.

482
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,680
You guys probably know this song.

483
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,040
It's hoarded out all the time on 7th and 8th style.

484
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
But here it is.

485
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:27,120
Everybody knows that song. You like that song, right? The one from 2DX? Well, those guys,

486
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,360
Svensson and Gielen, remixed a Delirium song and it's going to be in DDR Ultimate 2 and

487
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,800
we are going to play it. The clue stumped everybody for a long, long time, but actually

488
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,300
I'm really proud. One of our news, our news guy, Dark Tetsuya, was the one that finally

489
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,420
solved the clue and the way he figured it out was finally he did a Google

490
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,340
search there were these two guys on the picture that Jason Enos had posted in

491
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,060
the DDR freak thread or no I'm sorry not Jason what am I thinking I'm sorry

492
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,540
somebody that worked at the company or somebody there had posted the DDR freak

493
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:00,060
thread when I thinking about like these two guys that were like gay guys or

494
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,760
something and everybody was like yeah I was like who are these they're like gay

495
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,840
guys or something like that right and like everybody was assuming that the

496
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,760
guys were gay and they were totally wrong they just happened to be Spenson

497
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,200
and Guilin but nobody thought to search for Spenson and Guilin so very

498
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,160
interesting huh all right actually it's kind of funny because I didn't even I

499
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,560
didn't even realize it when I was doing the show a couple weeks ago uh-huh and I

500
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:36,300
played another version I have of after all it's actually on the the delirium

501
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:45,080
best I think it was I think this is it I think that both versions are on here

502
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,560
okay no it's not on this one but it's on another delirium CD that I have that has

503
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,360
both versions of it

504
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:02,200
Alright, we're going to play that song for you guys, and after that we'll play, I guess

505
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,080
we'll play the whole beauty of silence so you guys can hear it, and then we'll come

506
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,040
back with the show, but I know you guys may not have all heard this song yet, sometimes

507
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,040
people look to us to play the new UltraMix 2 songs for you guys, so we're going to play

508
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,240
it for you guys right now, and when we come back, there's more news about UltraMix 2 I

509
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,400
want to get into, this is on everybody's mind this week, and I have a lot I want to say

510
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,940
about it too as well. So, here we go, this is Delirium with After All.

511
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,940
Mensing Gila Mix, new for Ultramix 2, enjoy!

512
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,580
Because there's a light in me

513
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,940
And all these things are mine

514
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,700
Come to watch, it's a mess in my sight

515
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,380
No good to give, no meaning to leave

516
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,060
I'm missing you girl tonight

517
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,380
Everything will start all

518
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,380
And we'll all be shaking, still be safe, oh

519
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:33,380
As the woman said, he turned away from her goal She said she wouldn't run, that would be the call

520
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,380
For all these years, it'd still be single...

521
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:47,380
As the woman said, she turned away from her goal She said she wouldn't run, that would be the call

522
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:55,380
She knows I'm waiting in the rain

523
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:02,380
Nothing's left but a dream of silence

524
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,380
And so all she sees now is the sun

525
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,380
The scene is young, she's upside down

526
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,380
With pictures behind her closed eyes

527
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,380
I'll shine you into my own

528
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,380
After all these decades, every day, oh

529
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:42,380
As the morning shakes turn away from her bones

530
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,380
Said she wouldn't cry, that's what she just knows

531
00:41:46,380 --> 00:42:00,380
As the morning shakes turn away from her bones

532
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,380
That she wouldn't cry, that would be a crime

533
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,380
And we'd all be shaking, still be saying no

534
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,380
As we'd all be shaking away from her

535
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,380
That she wouldn't cry, that would be a lie

536
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:26,380
Music

537
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,380
Music

538
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:40,380
Music

539
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:39,380
Gaming radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

540
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:52,780
I'm going to beat that joke in the ground, just you wait.

541
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,540
That was awful.

542
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,360
Beautiful.

543
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,540
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

544
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:04,860
Hope you enjoyed that little sneak peek there at Delirium with After All.

545
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,380
Going to be in UltraMix 2.

546
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,180
How many more songs they have to announce for UltraMix 2 still?

547
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,180
Like what?

548
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,180
Like 150?

549
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,180
I don't know.

550
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,180
Like how many songs?

551
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,780
There's an ungodly amount of songs they still haven't even told us for UltraMix 2.

552
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,260
At least, at least like what, 40?

553
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,260
I don't know.

554
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,260
I don't even remember.

555
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,420
I haven't been, I haven't been doing my math very well, so.

556
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,460
But there's a lot of new songs still coming for UltraMix 2, and that's just the beginning.

557
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,660
I, I really like that song, and I can't wait to play it in UltraMix 2.

558
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,940
I know you gotta be excited about that one, Jamie.

559
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,300
You, you, you called it, in a way.

560
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,300
I did.

561
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:46,600
awesome all right also Ultramix 2 news this week there was a there was a video

562
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,840
posted on the internet and I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of this by

563
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,120
now but if you haven't run on over to a website orange lounge radio.com and it's

564
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,420
the second story down on our site right now it talks about the Ultramix 2 quad

565
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,480
mode video that's right the video was posted on the internet that shows quad

566
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,760
mode in action oh excuse me I'm a little burpee today yeah and quad mode is that

567
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,760
mode now on DDR that you have not one not two not three but four dance pads

568
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,920
all lined up in a row and you're dancing back and forth across all four dance

569
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,800
pads and this video is posted on the internet of this mode yeah you you

570
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,760
probably haven't seen this yet dark sagra have you let me show you this

571
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,740
because actually what really is causing up a storm here it has nothing to do

572
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,360
really with the quad with the quad mode itself but it has everything to do with

573
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:39,140
and how the game actually looks. So you definitely want to check this out here. Let's see if

574
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:48,140
we can get the video up here. Oh, I gotta give it a minute. It's gonna load up here.

575
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:53,020
Unless I saved it to the desktop or something. Yeah, well, it takes just as long to copy

576
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:58,940
it over as I would to download it, so I'm stuck now. Alright, it's coming, it's coming,

577
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:05,740
hold on. But yeah, this is definitely generating a lot of buzz in the DDR community right now,

578
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,660
because we really haven't heard a whole lot about Ultramix 2, but outside of Songlist.

579
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,960
And the game's only like, what, six weeks away, supposedly, from what we've heard, six

580
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,220
weeks away from release? Okay, here we go, here it is. Here's the video. Let me... It's

581
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:26,940
clip a ride on the light so look at that there's all these brand new videos

582
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,540
there's like a motorcycle thing that's all brand new everything looks like

583
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,540
futuristic like all these new videos and then of course you know quad mode pretty

584
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:41,700
much looks the way you would expect it to but the rage has a new model look at

585
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,060
that rage looks completely different like he's got like really poofy hair he

586
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:51,300
looks like me in the morning kind of with that hair and his motions are much

587
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,860
different we saw this 33 that all of the models and now he's doing like

588
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:01,100
cartwheels and stuff like totally different dances yeah well no we saw it

589
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:06,340
at at a e3 and we saw Emmys Hucci model right but the thing is is that actually

590
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,700
this video shows you it might be the other video let me bring yeah if I bring

591
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:14,420
up the other video she's been de Hucci five because a bunch of people fussed

592
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,620
about it at e3 we do not want who GM I actually from what I understand when I

593
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,540
was told is that actually because of a lot of the e3 feedback they did kind of

594
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,180
reevaluate what they had done with Emmy and they changed her back and so in this

595
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,860
other video I'm going to pull up you can actually see and if you want download

596
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,340

mister spanky

601
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:54,300
look at me back to normal there this is a three-player mode

602
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,080
you feel a multiple dancers kind of going at one time there

603
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,500
afro and you've got uh... rage and emi all dancing in this one three-player

604
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,580
dance mode

605
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,300
doing ballet

606
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,460
uh...

607
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,460
coloring them up and suck your teeth.

608
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,460
One hundred combos!

609
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,460
I can't see Emi.

610
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,460
Oh, it's her fourth mix costume.

611
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,460
One hundred combos!

612
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,460
Yeah, she may be a hoochie fighter. That's cool.

613
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:38,020
so they gave her just like this utter Uchi version of like the fourth

614
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:43,140
mix outfit and that was just kind of wrong it was not you would think it's

615
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:51,260
cool so anyway lots of reaction in the baumanni community going on to those

616
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:57,980
videos now I usually don't talk about certain posts on certain websites but

617
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,820
there was one post that really just got my panties in a bunch to be honest and

618
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,820
And this guy came out of the blue and just started

619
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:10,820
dogging on the quad mode video saying, those steps are horrible!

620
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,580
They're bad, and we all know this would happen. I've, we've told

621
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,700
Seagurd, we've told Mel when they were here on the show before we said you know what

622
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,820
people are gonna hate the steps.

623
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,420
We had to say it to you guys, that's the first thing people are going to bag on when Ultra Mix 2 comes out, and

624
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,540
I'm sure the steps are great, they're awesome, but there's always going to be somebody that doesn't like

625
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,500
the steps. And sure enough, this guy comes out of the woodwork and just starts

626
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,900
dogging on the steps saying they're horrible for a standard mode what are they doing with all these

627
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:41,300
crowds like all this bullshit and i'm just thinking get a load of this guy you know whatever

628
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:48,020
you know everybody's welcome to their opinion but then i found out after some more posts went by

629
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:55,620
that this guy had done some of the step charts for in the group and i'm sitting here going who

630
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,300
the fuck are you get off your high horse I mean seriously I talked about in the

631
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,580
groove here last week on the show it's a nice game it's a cute alternative to DDR

632
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,100
it's not a replacement for DDR but it's something else fun to play but the steps

633
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,500
are not all that okay I mean they're they've got some neat new ideas but

634
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,540
they're no better or worse than what we got right now I mean God it's kind of

635
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,180
like God get over yourself I just think doesn't poor taste because when you when

636
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,660
you're representing a company like that especially when you've got all these

637
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,220
questionable legal issues going around for you to go and start dogging on the

638
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,060
enemy game I mean it just makes you look like you had a vendetta from the start

639
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,020
your opinions me don't mean shit and it just makes your whole game look shitty I

640
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,780
mean there was a point earlier this week I was like I'm gonna come on Sunday show

641
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,380
I'm gonna take back everything nice I said about in the group because that

642
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,900
guy's pissed me off I've calmed down a little bit since then I'm not gonna take

643
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:49,460
back everything nice I said about in the group but I mean seriously what a lack

644
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,020
of class. Can I take back everything nice you said about anything? You can say whatever

645
00:51:53,020 --> 00:52:00,380
you want. I take it back for Rob. I'm kind of surprised there's no reaction from our

646
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,580
chat room. I thought half of them were following what was going on. I don't know. We've still

647
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:11,100
got people fixated on you talking about getting your panties in a bunch. You know. What did

648
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,260
you think of this, Loki? I mean, you're kind of more Sim scene oriented than us, so what

649
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,260
What did you think of this?

650
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,260
I don't know. I didn't read the post.

651
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,260
Probably for the best. To be honest, probably for the best.

652
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,260
I just hate people bitching about shit that they haven't seen yet.

653
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,260
Oh my god! They're so awful!

654
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,260
The game's not out yet.

655
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,260
I know.

656
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,260
But I can tell! I have ESP!

657
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,260
That's like, god.

658
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,260
That's because they're psycho and have ESP.

659
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:40,260
If only he knew. If only he knew, I can't say.

660
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,260
If only he knew, he couldn't really say anything.

661
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:52,180
just you know yeah anyway but what's interesting is that you know I I don't

662
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,700
even know it's almost like they're just looking for an excuse to dog on these

663
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,260
people who work their ass off on you know putting this given this game

664
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:04,180
together we all know damn well that KDA folks were doing the steps this time

665
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,540
because they wanted to make it right what they did from Ultramix one they

666
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,980
knew that they screwed up the steps so they wanted DDR fans to do the steps and

667
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,220
and some people are jealous that they weren't the ones doing it so they're

668
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,420
taking the first step

669
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,920
chance they can to just dog on what's going on and these guys work their ass off

670
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,580
they were working like 12, 14 hour days that would make you cry

671
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,980
in to get this game done for us and you know it just I think it's just totally

672
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,260
disrespectful and just

673
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,180
I honestly if this guy had nothing to do with the other game

674
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,080
I don't think it would be such a big deal because you just ride it off as well you know there's

675
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,220
always gonna be one heckler

676
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,160
but the fact that he represents because he worked with this other game he

677
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,960
therefore represents that other game

678
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,960
It just shows an utter lack of class. It just makes me, like, it just disgusts me.

679
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:53,460
It's not even a fact that he represents the other game, because, I mean, let's just say he was the guy that was doing the art for the backgrounds for, like, you know, their game, you know, songs or whatever.

680
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,960
That wouldn't even be so bad, but it's the guy that did some of the step charts, okay? That's even worse.

681
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,960
And I'm getting told in the chatroom, hey, don't put in the groove down because of one guy, and you know what? I...

682
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,460
I don't... like I said, I was gonna come in here and say a lot of nasty things about it, but I decided not to, but here's the problem.

683
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,060
when this guy who works on the game can't show any class at all

684
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,220
or any sense of respect at all for what's going on

685
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:22,260
you know on the other half of the fence, it does bring the whole image

686
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,580
of everybody on the staff down and I'm sure there's some wonderful people that

687
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,060
work on the game, there's wonderful people that play the game, there's no doubt about that

688
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,260
but one bad apple is can spoil a barrel

689
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,980
it's just like if anybody out there that uses an orange lounge banner in

690
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,780
their signature

691
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,060
I would expect that you're not a fucking asshat in your post

692
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,180
because you're kind of representing our station and if you were starting to be

693
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,140
an asshole in your post I would call you on it I'd say you know what don't use our

694
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,900
banner anymore if you're gonna act like an ass

695
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,180
luckily nice people use our banner so we don't have that problem but

696
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,900
when you're representing another you know company I'm sorry but when you act

697
00:54:53,900 --> 00:55:00,260
like an ass it makes everybody look like an ass

698
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,180
anyway

699
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,540
no I completely agree that's why I have to reason why I don't say where I work

700
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:15,540
No, seriously. Because I know how I am outside of work. I don't want to be seen as a representative of my company when I'm not associated with it.

701
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,540
Right. Me too. Same thing.

702
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:21,540
So, none of us have ever said exactly where we work for it, except for Loki, but he doesn't care.

703
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,540
He doesn't care what you think of his company.

704
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:31,540
To be honest, I don't think anyone would even know about how to get on internet radio at my work, let alone, you know, be able to figure things out.

705
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:37,140
figure things out and they're like there's where do you guys broadcast on the internet you can do

706
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:43,380
that but it's like when there's radio on the internet holy crap what's the internet it's like

707
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:50,500
you know when um when i went to vegas um as part of the ddr freak moderator trip there were these

708
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,900
guys here who were like fanboys who were following us around everywhere and i still wanted to turn

709
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:00,500
around and say don't you have lives go home but because i was a representative of ddr freak i

710
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:09,620
didn't say that I was just tolerant we actually ended up losing so you know

711
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,260
that and you know what does the guy have valid points I don't know but the

712
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,660
problem is is that it was a total like attitude problem just it wouldn't take

713
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,620
you know could dish it out but couldn't take it back I'm spending I'm spending

714
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,300
way too much time on this topic to be honest it really doesn't deserve this

715
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,260
much time but that just really I just want you guys to think out there you

716
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,500
know if you're representing a certain you know game stop being an idiot and

717
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,060
that even goes for just any old DDR player somebody playing DDR at the

718
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,020
arcade if you start acting like an ass you make every player that looks like

719
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:45,260
plays DDR make look like an ass so show a little bit of respect I mean it's just

720
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,620
like I kind of frown at some people that certain people to play Soulcalibur 2 in

721
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,380
the area because they're kind of assholes I mean and it's I'm sure you

722
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,900
know it's a great game I own it on GameCube but you know it kind of brings the

723
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,900
whole fan base down a little bit when a couple people look like asses and don't

724
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,900
Don't get me started on the initial D, people.

725
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,900
I'm going to second that.

726
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,900
I'm not even going to go there.

727
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,900
That's actually probably a much better example. I can think of more examples for that.

728
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:19,900
Hi, I play this racing game, so I have a really awesome car that's stored on a piece of paper.

729
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,900
I like in the groove, don't get me wrong.

730
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,460
I mean not well not not just that but you know initial D as well, you know

731
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,540
Anyway, I think we beat that into the ground. Yeah, we did beat I have ice cream

732
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,280
I just I wanted to get that out of my system. I've been sitting on that all week

733
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,460
Do you feel better a lot actually do you feel spiritually? I do

734
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,900
You know what? I would I would go so far as to welcome that guy on our show if he wants to present a

735
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,180
dissenting opinion go for it

736
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:57,140
I'd love to hear it I would love to debate it would be just like the

737
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,220
presidential debate

738
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,540
you sir but seriously

739
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,940
it's just one step chart on a mode that really I mean honestly quad mode it's

740
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,060
cute and all but it really isn't that important

741
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:12,060
I mean I want to see what the rest of the game looks like to be honest let's

742
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,180
look at some singles and doubles and how

743
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:19,940
I mean honestly out regardless how you feel about the step chart look at this

744
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,620
all new backgrounds a whole new song a whole new interface

745
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,060
characters look differently no more hoochie emi I mean there's so

746
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,060
you could throw the steps right out completely and there's so many good things about it

747
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:36,140
I'm very pissed off that they got rid of hoochie emi that makes me sad

748
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,660
maybe she's an easter egg she's not an easter egg they just

749
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,860
there you're making the poor CG woman look like a hoochie

750
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,980
no it might hurt her artificial feelings

751
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,980
Who cares if it didn't look right?

752
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,980
I mean, some things just aren't right, but they happen.

753
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,980
Like the Olsen twins acting. That's just not right, but it happens.

754
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:02,980
Um, but yeah, if we want to get down on someone that sucks

755
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,980
at steps, holy crap, who about the people that made that

756
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,980
stupid fucking hands and feet mode? Those are some shitty steps right there.

757
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,980
That's what I gotta say. That's who you should be mad at.

758
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:20,380
at it. Screw quad mode. Quad mode's difficult because it's four pads. Hands and feet mode,

759
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:26,780
man, they did not... Screw you. I kind of like hands and feet mode. Screw you. You can

760
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,740
actually... From what I hear, you can actually go in and change the difficulty, but for whatever

761
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,340
reason, they made it kind of like almost impossible to find where to change... Like, I just found

762
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,100
out about this the other day. Like, it's almost impossible like to figure out where you gotta

763
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,580
go to... You know, it's not obvious, in other words. It's not possible. It's not obvious

764
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,620
Where it is to change difficulty, but it's just kind of like...

765
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,940
Hi, my name is Tina.

766
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,940
Ah, shut up Tina, nobody cares.

767
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:52,420
I hate banner ads that have sound in them, I absolutely hate them.

768
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,180
And that banner is all over the internet right now.

769
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,340
So why not do feedback?

770
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,820
There's a feedback thread.

771
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,460
No, no, I'm not even talking about this.

772
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,540
I'm just using this to get that one video that I lost all of a sudden.

773
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,700
But it's on like a million other sites too.

774
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,980
Tina can go to hell.

775
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,760
That's how I feel about Tina.

776
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:17,260
I want to get to this other video, but for some reason I keep trying to pull it up and

777
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,260
it doesn't work.

778
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,860
Oh, I know why, because I've got to use the other program to do it.

779
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:26,660
Let me, um, doo doo doo doo doo, let's see, uh, I want to load up another video that came

780
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:33,920
out this week, and it actually has to do for, uh, uh, DDR Festival.

781
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,160
A brand new video came out for DDR Festival, and it shows something kind of interesting

782
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
going on.

783
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,860
uh... let's see what was the name of that

784
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,460
that this thing

785
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,400
i hear it is this is the idea are festival trade

786
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,600
now obviously we're on the radio you guys can't see it but i'll tell you

787
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,840
what's kinda going on here

788
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,880
a little fireworks

789
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,320
festival array

790
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,920
obviously

791
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,760
there's maximize

792
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,960
and look at that a brand new character select screen

793
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,020
that has your characters there's written there's blues and look at that

794
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:11,020
One, two, three outfits for every character now that you can pick right there.

795
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:16,020
Some people are calling that customizable characters. I call that three outfits a character, but whatever.

796
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,020
There's a new guy there. There's a guy named Drum.

797
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:25,020
So do you think he'll have a partner named Bass? I don't know. We'll see.

798
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,020
And there's a little bit of the song lip.

799
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:39,020
pretty much what you'd expect there's a clip from you're not here a little bit

800
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:45,100
of the party mode there but it's all in Japanese which makes sense there's that

801
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:49,700
feed the dog and bunny mode and there are some of the members from be for you

802
01:01:49,700 --> 01:02:06,940
playing on the iToy. And it looks much better than the iToy actually does. You should see,

803
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:10,460
like in this video, the B4U chicks, they totally are like paraparing some of these hands and

804
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,820
beat things on itoy

805
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:19,820
and i love noria she's such a cracko

806
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:26,260
look at that look she's like totally par par-ing to clear the screen there

807
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,660
it's so cute

808
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:34,660
there's mission mode you know that's coming back

809
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:47,260
There's a little clip of your reign in that video, we all know that song.

810
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,500
Bunk Boogie.

811
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:59,140
So no big surprises there about DDR Festival, not right now, anyway no big surprises there

812
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:05,020
about DER Festival, honestly. Basically the three outfits a character thing, that's kind

813
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:10,340
of new and that's kind of cute. There's probably a whole assload of characters as well. But

814
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,900
to be honest, this is kind of a chance for those of you guys that don't have a US machine

815
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:19,220
to get to experience the iToy modes and basically everything that's in Extreme USA. So if you

816
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,180
only have a Japanese machine, which I do, I only have a Japanese PS2. If I didn't live

817
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,940
with Loki, I wouldn't have access to an American PS2. So I only have a Japanese PS2, so this

818
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,940
This would kind of be my option to kind of play a lot of the songs, really, so...

819
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,940
Too bad Mission Mode's in Japanese, because you can't figure out what the fuck to do.

820
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,940
Exactly, so I don't know how this...

821
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,940
You know there's going to be FAQs up on that one in no time.

822
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,940
Oh, there'll be FAQs up on it in no time, but...

823
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,940
I'm not sure how much I would desire to own this game personally.

824
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,940
There's really not a whole lot new in it.

825
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,940
I mean, I already own the Xbox.

826
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:50,940
But, you know, there's, you know, if you don't own an Xbox,

827
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,940
you know, it's your first chance to play some of those songs, and...

828
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,580
I want the fucking European one. They have better mixes anyways. Get that.

829
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:01,300
Well actually there is going to be a song from EuroMix in there. Jameleah with

830
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,020
Superstar.

831
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:05,660
I like that. Which I know best from the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy soundtrack actually.

832
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:09,620
So. Yep. Um. We should probably, we should

833
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:12,820
play that at some point. Okay we'll play that song at some point.

834
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:17,100
I bet some people want to hear that for DDR festival and you know. I played it on my show a couple times.

835
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:21,380
Yeah, it's a good song. Oh my god, my spin instructor loves that song. She adopted it.

836
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:25,940
So, I don't know, what do you think about DDR Festival? You own a Japanese and American

837
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,460
PS2. Is this something you're kind of interested in getting at all, you think, Jamie?

838
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:34,500
I'll get it. I don't have an iToy, so I don't really give a crap about the iToy modes, but

839
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:40,860
I'm not going to play a game and watch myself flail around stupidly. So, no. But I'll get

840
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,700
it. I'll get it for stuff.

841
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,060
I think, you know what, personally, I think I'm actually going to pass on it. I really

842
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:49,780
don't see the point for me getting it, because I can't read Japanese. I already have all

843
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:53,460
the songs minus like three or four whatever how many songs have been in DDR

844
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,140
yet I just there hasn't really been anything to really sell me on it yet I

845
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,340
think it's one of those things I'll pick up later it's a collector thing like

846
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,980
when it's come down in price a little bit maybe like try to get it when it's

847
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,620
like a little bit discounted before it becomes a collector's item and

848
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:10,340
everything but as much as I want to support DDR and all there's too much

849
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:14,700
shit to buy in the US right now. I already know what else my money's going for. And UltraMix 2 is coming out like the same week and

850
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,460
And honestly, my money's going there first.

851
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,060
I have other imports to get.

852
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:23,840
I have to get 2DX8 style.

853
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,840
And blue jingai.

854
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:29,340
Because the US version is ass.

855
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,840
Alright I guess we're going to open up the skype line because you know what, we've talked

856
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,180
about a lot of different things here.

857
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:38,180
We've kind of talked about quad mode in Ultramix 2 a little bit and a little bit of the controversy

858
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,180
there.

859
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,180
We talked about DER festival.

860
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,040
Just curious if you guys have any comments, again if you don't know what the skype line

861
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:48,440
it's all about, visit www.orangesonsradio.com, click on interact with us, and you can see

862
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,720
the details right there on how to use the Skype line. It allows you to call our show

863
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,040
without having a phone. I actually think I'm going to buy the feature to allow us to call

864
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,460
out so we can do some phone interviews later with some big name DDR celebs. That'd be kind

865
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,460
of fun.

866
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,460
Do you actually call phone numbers?

867
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,200
Yeah, you can actually call phone numbers using this little tab right here, but you

868
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,400
have to pay for credits, but you know, I'm thinking about it. I might do that. We'll

869
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,240
see yeah I think it's a neat idea for Skype so we're kind of giving a minute

870
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,280
for the buffer to catch up because it takes it takes a minute before you guys

871
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,480
actually hear what we say here in studio so I want you guys to be able to call

872
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:29,400
into the Skype line yes looky I just was liking one the point out to Rob here

873
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,680
three away and four way now I'm not mentioning well oh hopefully we get

874
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,600
those so I just hope they're not fakes look you might have something really

875
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,160
good to play for you guys later I just hope that God they're not fakes what was

876
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,560
that thing you were showing me earlier today I guess it's a couple months old

877
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,720
but somebody had actually written a whole document like an FAQ on how to

878
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,920
make fake Bahmani songs something like that how to make fake test location songs

879
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,720
which is another thing that I think is in completely poor taste don't get me

880
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,840
started you're just preying on poor people that are just looking to get

881
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:05,560
excited about a new game it's like you know but whatever

882
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,120
you're sure yeah you're showing me it's somewhere in here or something some

883
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,800
little uh...

884
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,140
some little guide on how to write a fake

885
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,960
the money so i just had to do

886
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,820
is running something through a bunch of filters and also the garbage

887
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,080
uh... yeah we're getting a call let's go to skype line

888
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,940
hello you are an orange launch radio

889
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,140
it's going to tell them all of the game a moment how you doing

890
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,040
the guy with the calls for dinner

891
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,900
hey what's on your mind

892
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,280
well you mentioned the art festival and i have some choice words forty-year

893
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,740
festival. I have a feeling I know it's coming but go for it. Well first of all I

894
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:47,460
mean I know a lot of mix of US mixes have been accused of being you know like

895
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:53,100
half-assed like just piling things one on top of the other and not having a lot

896
01:07:53,100 --> 01:08:01,500
of balance to them. I see festival as probably the a perfect example of being

897
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:09,420
a half-assed mix just as far as the Konami Originals are concerned I don't

898
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:13,300
know if it's so much a half-assed mix it's just the fact that for once I think

899
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,500
it's just the tables are turned and we got something kind of new before

900
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:22,020
Japanese did so this game coming out for them is kind of like when we got like

901
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:26,440
DDR USA what the hell was that it was just a rehash thing you know there

902
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,140
really wasn't anything special about it maybe I'll take the half-assed comment

903
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:34,660
back and I'll go with rehash, but half-ass was the first thing that I thought of, only

904
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:43,780
because on the way of the Konami originals included, thus far anyway, none of them have

905
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:50,980
not appeared on a USA mix yet.

906
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:56,860
The fact of the matter is, the entire Konami original selection, you can find them on United

907
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,820
States mixes already.

908
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:07,820
But for the standard person living in Japan who has a casual passing interest in DDR, it is going to be something new to them, so, you know.

909
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,820
Oh, of course.

910
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:15,820
But for us, for the import fans, for us, it's no big deal unless we don't have Xbox or don't have a US PS2, you know?

911
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:22,820
So that's pretty much it. For the Japanese gamer, it's something nice because they get more songs that they don't have on their PS2s yet.

912
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:25,820
For the American importer, it's kind of a letdown.

913
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:30,660
But for us fucking obsessive collectors, it's kind of a letdown.

914
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:34,380
But you know, we have to kind of face the fact that we're in the minority.

915
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:39,580
And Konami, they're getting three games for their buck here, really.

916
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:43,260
I mean, we all kind of know that Konami of Japan actually were the ones that did

917
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,660
the interface that Konami USA keeps getting criticized for.

918
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:49,880
But basically, Konami of Japan made this interface, and they got three games out

919
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,040
of it.

920
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,140
They got the one in Europe, they got our game, they got their new festival.

921
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,740
So hey, I'm sure it worked out great for them.

922
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,780
Oh, yeah, definitely.

923
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:57,900
Very easy to develop.

924
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,500
You come up with a basic skeleton,

925
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,180
and then you plug in the insides.

926
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,140
For me, I just think it's kind of neat to kind of have the tables turned

927
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:06,660
for once.

928
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,940
And we're getting something new.

929
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:12,100
And it's kind of like, oh, well, we don't need the Japanese mix now.

930
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,620
We don't need to support that.

931
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:16,100
It's kind of, it's the same damn argument

932
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,520
that we heard three years ago when it was USA was getting the sloppy seconds,

933
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,020
you know?

934
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,520
Exactly.

935
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,220
It's in reverse now.

936
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:25,180
still some people who are going to spin this into Japan's favor

937
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:29,200
and it's I I think it is I I think it's comedy

938
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:33,060
gold for all those people that were dogging on extreme before saying it

939
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:36,700
wasn't Japanese enough I think it is just comedy gold it's totally

940
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:41,320
it's totally just desserts for those people that just said you know it's

941
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,440
crap it's USA just the America ruined DDR

942
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,040
no not really the direction in DDR right

943
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,960
this is the direction they wanted to move in but America in fact

944
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,260
I in fact I would go so far as to say that Hawaii which is an American state

945
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:58,160
last time I checked

946
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,960
is going to revolutionize CDR so no question about that

947
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:06,120
especially when you're getting 50 songs that are completely new

948
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,280
and never been seen before you never before you never see that unless you're

949
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,040
talking about a brand new Japanese arcade mix

950
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,360
I'm gonna go I'm gonna go so far as to make a prediction here on the program

951
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,200
that when Ultramix 2 comes out, about a couple weeks after Ultramix 2,

952
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,280
it is going to be so huge, and it's going to be so...

953
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,160
there are going to be those detractors, like people that work for In the Groove or

954
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,480
whatever, that are going to be out there going, ah, this game sucks.

955
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:34,560
But for the most part, 90 percent of the scene is going to just love this game and

956
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,120
say this is everything DDR should have been,

957
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:41,360
and I'm saying that there are going to be freaking riots and petitions

958
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,200
for Konami of Hawaii to do an arcade mix. The Konami of Hawaii should be given all

959
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:51,860
the rights to do a new arcade mix. I would go so far as to say that. I think they're

960
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:55,620
going to be forgiven for DDRPC. I think most people have already forgiven them for it.

961
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:59,600
It was just a chance for them to get their feet wet, and we've all managed to look past

962
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,180
it now. UltraMix had some problems, but for the most part it was different. It was new.

963
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:09,920
And now UltraMix II is going to blow it all away.

964
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,480
I definitely agree about UltraMix II, especially with the song list is pretty much half revealed

965
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,000
by now, and it just blows everything out of the water.

966
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,500
And now just the videos this week, what did you think of the videos that came out this

967
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,500
week?

968
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:28,980
The Rage remodel kicks ass.

969
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,860
And the backgrounds and the videos looked awesome.

970
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,040
I was very impressed with the movies.

971
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,040
Very impressed.

972
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,180
You know to be honest though, there's a part of me that's like, why did they bother to

973
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,920
show this game at E3?

974
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,900
Because it looked nothing like what they've got now.

975
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,460
kind of like it's like they played a trick on us it's like that e3 thing was

976
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:51,140
a total waste it was just a chance to say we're working on something and now

977
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:54,420
you know this game is just looking incredible but it's so funny because

978
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:59,980
even I at e3 said Ultramix to you know don't don't waste your breath you know

979
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:05,980
it doesn't look like the right thing but boy did I get screwed yeah definitely

980
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:09,700
the first thing yeah I'll agree with you the first thing is I go when I saw

981
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:13,380
Ultramix to say no they got a nice selection of Konami originals that may

982
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,380
may or may not make it in the game. It looks good so far.

983
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,380
Yeah, they got that point battle thing.

984
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:23,380
You know those Konami originals? Well, they're in there and that's all the old stuff you're getting.

985
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,380
Yeah. And by the way, there's 70 songs.

986
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:29,380
Exactly.

987
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,380
Any other thoughts on your mind, Mr. Mullet?

988
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,380
No, after that long voice thing.

989
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,380
Well, we appreciate your perspective, as always.

990
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,380
No problem.

991
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,380
Have a wonderful day.

992
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,380
You too.

993
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,380
Alright, bye-bye.

994
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:49,380
Bye.

995
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:53,380
The other line was ringing.

996
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:58,380
I'm sure we'll get a return call there.

997
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,380
We can pick that up.

998
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:03,380
If you want to interact with the show, www.orangelandsradio.com

999
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,380
and click on interact with us.

1000
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,380
Here comes a call.

1001
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,380
Hello, you're on Orangelandsradio.

1002
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,380
Hello, who's this?

1003
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:18,480
who's this you're breaking up really really badly try again okay hi how you

1004
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:29,900
doing you know what oh yeah I hate to do this but I gotta let you go because we

1005
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,240
can't hear you at all you're really breaking up bad double-check your

1006
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:38,200
connection just it's really really breaking up there I can't understand you

1007
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,700
So, we'll try that again later. Maybe we'll get a better connection.

1008
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:46,200
That's kind of why the downside of having to take the calls online is that when you get the packet lost and all that crap.

1009
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,200
Loki, are you downloading porn over there? Is that why it's so choppy? I'm just kidding.

1010
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:54,200
Alright, I guess we better disable the Skyblind for a little bit.

1011
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,700
We'll let it get a little better there.

1012
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:00,700
And, we'll go to a break.

1013
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,700
Because I want to get to the Orange Laundry cage match and some other Bimani news that came out this week for sure.

1014
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,200
We also have other favorite segments.

1015
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,600
Yes, and we'll open up the Skyline a little bit again later.

1016
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,480
In this break we're going to hear some music from,

1017
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:17,000
I don't know, some Japanese mixes, some Japanese songs that are popular

1018
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,320
in DDR, because Jamie really wanted to hear

1019
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,920
Ninzaburo, or, what the hell is the other name of Ninzaburo? I always called it Ninzaburo.

1020
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,920
The theme of Furuhata. Thank you, Furuhata theme, I couldn't even remember that.

1021
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:34,760
Which is from the show, Furuhata Ninzaburo. That's right. So we're going to play some of these songs, and then we will be back with more

1022
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,760
Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back.

1023
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:37,560
But it's always been the fast lane, like the yellow, you can't stop me

1024
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,260
I've seen so many blood stains, so many times with these brains

1025
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,260
To help people see what's high, I'm sitting here like the sky

1026
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,260
Keep it real, you ain't gonna lie, that a lot of people ain't survived

1027
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:49,260
This is your life, no kidding, look at her, and stay with the pain

1028
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,260
It's a puppy fish, yeah!

1029
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:46,260
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!

1030
01:18:46,260 --> 01:19:11,620
You're out of situation, motivation, situation You're out of motivation, situation, motivation

1031
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,620
Oh, you have to run

1032
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:17,620
Oh, you have to run

1033
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:20,620
Oh, you have to run

1034
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:24,620
Oh, you have to run

1035
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,620
Dance, come see me, chance

1036
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:31,620
Get the freedom, that's who the beat them moves

1037
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,620
So fit the groove

1038
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,620
Come on, dance

1039
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,620
Jump, come on, let's jump

1040
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:36,620
Let's get the beat, let's groove

Let's move your feelin', come!

1042
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:09,620
How you doin'? How you feelin', baby?

1043
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:30,620
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1044
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,620
said.

1045
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:38,860
I was a little bit of awkward silence there, sorry guys.

1046
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:41,500
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1047
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:45,660
I just got distracted by the chat room while I was trying to queue up the last bit of playlist

1048
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:47,660
thing there and I got too distracted.

1049
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:50,820
Yeah, don't stay on our chat room.

1050
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:58,980
I forgot to mention that actually I was up this morning, well I was up til 5.30 last

1051
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:03,380
night and I got up this morning at about 1130 or so I started playing ultra mix

1052
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,860
like all morning I swear to God I was playing ultra mix for like two hours

1053
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:11,380
today online on the dance you know playing against other people thing and I

1054
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:17,260
think in one day I raised my ranking on the ranking board from 999 which is you

1055
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,180
know basically as low as you can get like you have to get a certain amount of

1056
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,780
points where you can ever crack that number I think I raised it up all the

1057
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:28,700
way to like 640 something in a day's work so which isn't that many points but

1058
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,840
I just for some reason today Ultramix is like still popular

1059
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,700
I was in a lot of four-person matches and the people were kind of picking a lot of light songs

1060
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,640
And we're kind of kind of struggling a little bit

1061
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:47,120
But you know my only complaint about Ultramix online is that god damn people keep picking the same damn songs

1062
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,340
Like the default song that comes up when you want to pick a song to battle against somebody is

1063
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:58,640
0.59 right Tengoku if you want to call it that too. That's the default song and so of course

1064
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:01,600
like a million matches get started with that song because people don't know how

1065
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,640
to change it and it's kind of like I'm so sick of this song and then for some

1066
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,000
reason today there was this one person I swear to God every match he or she

1067
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,320
created I think it might have been a she every match she was creating secret

1068
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:16,120
rendezvous was her song it's like it kind of sucks there's not a whole lot of

1069
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:19,440
people on Ultramix usually there's only a couple groups of people playing so

1070
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:24,960
you're kind of stuck with whatever songs you can actually find yeah wow it's not

1071
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,960
It's not like every time you start a game with DO THAT THING!

1072
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:34,960
Okay, now it's not true. Just today, I played Shiny Disco Balls and DXY in games, okay?

1073
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,960
So, just, you know, shut your mouth.

1074
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:37,960
Woohoo, DXY!

1075
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,960
Nobody else will pick Do That Thing. I have to show Do That Thing a little love.

1076
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,960
Everybody loves Do That Thing.

1077
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,960
What? What? What are you pointing at?

1078
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,960
Dead people!

1079
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,960
Oh, oh, Loki wants me to talk about this story, speaking of songs.

1080
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:57,680
We just posted this to our website, even though this isn't like directly Bimani related, it's

1081
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,000
kind of Bimani related.

1082
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,640
One of the ladies from the Weather Girls, Yzora Rhodes, she was one half of the Weather

1083
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,440
Girls, she died this week.

1084
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:10,080
And the Weather Girls, of course, if you didn't know, they did the song, It's Raining Men,

1085
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:15,400
which was covered in a more very infamous Max 2 song by Jerry Halliwell, aka Ginger Spice,

1086
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,580
which by the way, was one of the other DDR songs I heard at the club last night was Jerry

1087
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,940
Halliwell's version of It's Raining Men and I don't think I've ever heard that

1088
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:27,540
at a club in my life and I don't think I've ever seen a dance floor so gay.

1089
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:32,660
They played it one time at Dave & Buster's. Oh that's cool. It was from Bridget Jones Diary

1090
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:38,300
which had a pretty pretty well-received soundtrack from what I remember but...

1091
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:46,500
Moment of silence please for one half the weather girls, Yzora Rhodes.

1092
01:23:46,500 --> 01:24:16,260
Alright, there we go, alright, and a little clip for us to remember, bye.

1093
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:20,040
I don't care how you feel about that song, you can't deny it's a good DDR song.

1094
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,040
It's great for DDR.

1095
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,560
It really is.

1096
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:26,400
Sure it makes the game look a little fruity, but you know what?

1097
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,400
The song rocks.

1098
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,400
You know what?

1099
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,360
I don't think that people can help but look fruity on DDR.

1100
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:36,920
For every song like It's Raining Men, you get a song like Daikinkai, which is kind of,

1101
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:41,160
you know, it's kind of rocking and mannish, I guess.

1102
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,040
It's a very testosterone-y song, I think.

1103
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,040
So you know, equippage.

1104
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:51,880
there's all the tacos stuff yeah which makes me happy so shut your mouth yeah

1105
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:55,560
we should take all of those people actually go play pata pata excellent

1106
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:59,840
point for a moment in our chat room I'm still trying to figure out how songs are

1107
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,820
gay without the ability to come out and tell us I'm wondering how songs have a

1108
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:11,160
gender preference do you like dude like you know boy songs go chat up other boy

1109
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:19,160
I'll give you a hint. The Do That Thing video is kind of what clues you in to the fact that that song's a little gay.

1110
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,160
Testostaroni.

1111
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,160
Yes.

1112
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,160
Is that the new San Francisco machine?

1113
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,160
Yes. Ding, ding. Testostaroni.

1114
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,160
That was pretty funny.

1115
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:38,160
I'm being teased by the listeners. I don't like that. I'm supposed to be proving some kind of fake power over them, and I don't like being teased.

1116
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:41,160
Rob, is your journalistic integrity being breached?

1117
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,160
Yes. I'm being breached.

1118
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,160
You're being breached.

1119
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,160
And I don't like it.

1120
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,160
So we have more Bimani news.

1121
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
Uh, sure we do.

1122
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,160
I was actually going to queue up the cage match, but if you want to talk-

1123
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,160
Okay, cage match.

1124
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:59,160
Well, then let's do more Bimani, since you brought it up.

1125
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,160
You're the one talking about testosterone and bringing it up.

1126
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,160
Testosterone-y.

1127
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,160
Yes, Logie?

1128
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:22,160
I'd like to make a little side note here, if anyone's interested in looking for like a nice DDR pad, our friend at, um, the local Golf Land is selling off his Solo 2000 arcade stage, if you want it.

1129
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,160
Really?

1130
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:30,160
Yes. So he's selling that for anybody that's interested, um, I don't know how you can get ahold of him.

1131
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:39,160
Uh, he's on DDR Freak as Koon Doggy. K-U-N, uh, Doggy. So, just, um, you might be able to PM him and ask him.

1132
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:42,160
The Sage is fucking heavy, it is 200 pounds, so.

1133
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,160
It's a real solapad, I saw it.

1134
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,160
It's a real thing, so.

1135
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,160
It's a modified Sage.

1136
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,160
No, it hasn't been modified.

1137
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,160
No, it hasn't been modified at all.

1138
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:52,160
Yeah, he hasn't really done anything with it yet. Just in case you're interested and have a lot of cash.

1139
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,160
Does he have an idea of how much he's charging for it?

1140
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,160
No.

1141
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,160
I'll pay a dollar.

1142
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,160
Haha, put it on eBay.

1143
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:07,160
Also, as long as we're doing miscellaneous Orange Honest Radio announcements, I do want to say happy birthday to our cam whore, Misty. It's her birthday today.

1144
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:12,160
We also had a weekend a few days ago. A weekend. A birthday. A few days ago.

1145
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:17,160
Ooh, I'm horrible with birthdays. Oh, Sharks Girl. Of course, Sharks Girl's birthday was a couple days ago.

1146
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:20,160
She got to go play with dolphins on her birthday.

1147
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,160
I know.

1148
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,160
That was very nice.

1149
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,160
They were so cute.

1150
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,160
I want to have her back on the show to talk about it. Cool.

1151
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:31,240
Alright, um, let's see, uh, Bamani News, before we get to the cage match, since Jamie decided

1152
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,240
to delay the cage match here.

1153
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,080
You were the one who decided, okay.

1154
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,680
I just like ruffling your feathers.

1155
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:41,080
Uh, Dance Mania EX8 is on the way out, of course Dance Mania being the series that a

1156
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:46,600
lot of DDR songs come from, uh, Dance Mania EX8 is on the way, and it's gonna have some

1157
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:56,040
lovely tracks on it, including, oh, hold on, I'll do the band, god, distract the show

1158
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:03,040
here so I can do a ban. We're banning somebody for being a stupid butt. Alright. Ah, thank

1159
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,840
you, now I got that. What a waste of time. If you should blame anybody, you should blame

1160
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,760
the butt head who came in the chat room. Why do you have to do that when I've got other

1161
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:19,080
things going on, Mr. Spammerguy? Alright, anyway. Erotic, with Gotta Get It Groovin',

1162
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,000
the remix of that is going to be on this CD. I'm trying to think of other DDR bands you

1163
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Two Unlimited, Maximum Overdrive, the Horny Horns vocal radio edit.

1164
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Horny Horns.

1165
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Who's That Girl, doing a cover of Burnin' Up by Madonna.

1166
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Extreme with Upside Jump, Atomic Kittens, gonna do Ladies Night, which is actually...

1167
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
With Curtis Mantronic.

1168
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Yeah, with Curtis Mantronic doing a remix.

1169
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Which is actually a previous Cage Match pick of ours, I believe.

1170
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I don't think that remix is, but I know that song was, because I picked it.

1171
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I think it was.

1172
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Oh, what the hell is that song? Simply, or Strictly Business, I think.

1173
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Also, we've got, I saw there was another one on here I wanted to mention. Oh, Wildside.

1174
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
You know Wildside. They did Ears is the Woman and My Sweet Darling. They're going to have Superstar.

1175
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And I don't know if that has anything to do with any other versions of that song, but that's going to be on Dance Media EX8.

1176
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So look for that soon, and if you can't find it, that's alright.

1177
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It's going to be speedy.

1178
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
We'll play it on Orange Laundrio as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.

1179
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You know who I miss? Actually, I miss the Olivia project.

1180
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I do too.

1181
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
All those lovely Olivia Newton-John, you know, remakes.

1182
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
It's cool stuff.

1183
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I know.

1184
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I'm sad.

1185
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Especially Xanadu.

1186
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,000
What makes me really sad is it almost seems irrelevant to be posting on Dance Mania albums anymore.

1187
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Because it's like, I doubt we're gonna see a new DDR, you know?

1188
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It's just kinda like, it's sad. The whole thing's just sad.

1189
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It's all home versions.

1190
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,480
Which kind of reminds me of an important question I want to ask on our Live Journal community

1191
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,680
later this week.

1192
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:56,280
So if you're not a member of our Live Journal community, you should join at www.livejournal.com

1193
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,740
and its username, OrangeLounge, is our username.

1194
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:02,940
So for those of you guys that are on the Live Journal, you sometimes get to see secret little

1195
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:06,840
posts and you get to be in the know on some things, and you get reminded every Tuesday

1196
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,480
night to pump up the volume is on.

1197
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,480
Yeah, because...

1198
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,480
Well, okay...

1199
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,480
No, it's a great promotional tour, it really is, and people seem to like having reminders,

1200
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:18,480
I usually post on there what the marathon is going to be in case you go, oh, that sucks.

1201
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,480
I usually don't want them to listen anyway.

1202
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,480
A little bit of a warning what's going to be played.

1203
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,480
Yeah. That's cool.

1204
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,480
No, it's a good way to keep tabs on what's going on.

1205
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:33,480
Sometimes there's a lot of things that, they're not quite appropriate to be posted on the front page of our site,

1206
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,480
but they're things we want to kind of, uh, clue the fans in on, so.

1207
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,480
For a picture, rather than a compromising position.

1208
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,480
Oh, shut up.

1209
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,480
Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1210
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:55,480
Last week, in the Orange Mountain Studio cage match, Echo Image made its return to the cage match with a song called Come Back.

1211
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:58,480
And it was Loki's pick for the cage match.

1212
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:04,480
And you know what though? It may be a tricky night tonight because Shane, I noticed, quit out of our chat room earlier in the show.

1213
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,480
So he's not going to be here to persuade you all to vote for Echo Image.

1214
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,480
So, could be competitive tonight.

1215
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,480
Could be.

1216
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:15,440
of good songs tonight but will an old favorite or I should say a new old

1217
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,800
favorite of the show will it win who knows tonight's song number one oh the

1218
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,520
way the cage match works you get to hear three songs you get to hear a clip of

1219
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,160
last week's winner and two new songs in their entirety the song that wins goes

1220
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:30,720
into rotation all week long on Orange Laundry is the money music amor program

1221
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:35,600
which plays 24 hours a day seven days a week when we are not all right

1222
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,280
cool all right here's a clip of last week's winner echo image song number one

1223
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:47,280
you can vote for tonight with Come Back.

1224
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:14,280
Fall back to me

1225
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,280
I'm lying here waiting

1226
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:22,280
I'm waiting face to see

1227
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:28,280
My heart's searching into you

1228
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:32,280
You hear me calling

1229
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:38,280
Know the way I feel, the way I feel

1230
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,280
To see me fall down

1231
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:49,280
Realize what I feel, singing to you

1232
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,280
Hear me talking

1233
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:59,280
Know the way I feel, the way I feel

1234
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:25,780
All right, song number one in the cage match with Echo Image with Come Back.

1235
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:28,580
And you know, we're noticing that our chat room seems kind of dead tonight.

1236
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:31,880
considering we don't have we have just as many listeners as we usually do but

1237
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,000
our chat room seems a little bit dead I mean there's a few people that new show

1238
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
that new drama that everyone's gonna be talking about on Monday about horny

1239
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,600
housewife Oh God we can be started you know we're trying to think like seriously

1240
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,960
that's what we think about like when when when the night seems kind of slow

1241
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,360
or a little bit dead it's kind of like is there something else going on tonight

1242
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,640
like where the Oscars on tonight huh I have a hard time believing they're all

1243
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,640
sitting at home watching Desperate Housewives.

1244
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,640
They're watching Replays of the Debate.

1245
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,640
Alright, anyway.

1246
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,640
Moving on.

1247
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,640
They're playing Silent Hill 4.

1248
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,640
Let's get on to song number 2 tonight in a cage match.

1249
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,640
It is Jamie's pick. Jamie, tell us about your pick tonight.

1250
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,640
I don't remember.

1251
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,640
I'll tell you.

1252
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,640
You decided to go with an old favorite too.

1253
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,640
You decided to use Loki's own tricks on him and you went with an old favorite.

1254
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,640
You went with M-Flow.

1255
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,640
Oh yeah, I just picked a random M-Flow song because I couldn't think of anything else.

1256
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:23,640
Alright, so here's the random Enflow song that Jamie decided on, it's called You Said.

1257
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,640
Is this from their astro album?

1258
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:30,640
No, it's from the... I don't remember the name of the album.

1259
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,640
Alright.

1260
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,640
I think it's from the last one before the astromantic.

1261
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,640
Alright, fair enough. Well here it is for you guys to give it a try.

1262
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,640
See if you like this one enough to give it your vote tonight.

1263
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,640
It is Enflow with You Said.

1264
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,640
Jamie's picking my escape the match enjoy

1265
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:40,140
She said that you would never let me go You said that you would be for everything

1266
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:49,380
Unni, oe ga jiki da kute, juwa ki wo tote

1267
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:54,220
Wijake le do wa wa naze ga

1268
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:57,820
Tame nai ogo e chan ano hikara

1269
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:03,260
Anata wa tote, yeah yeah yeah yeah

1270
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:44,800
You will always be the ground You say that you will never let me go

1271
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,020
You say that you will be my everything

1272
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,020
Oh

1273
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,020
Oh

1274
01:38:49,020 --> 01:39:12,980
And you will never let me go I say that you will be my everything

1275
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:20,540
Alrighty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Emplo, with You Said.

1276
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:25,020
And now we will say what we thought of that song, starting with Jamie.

1277
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,280
I like that song.

1278
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:31,020
I was listening to some Emplo earlier today while I was doing my homework.

1279
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:33,940
And that song, I was just sort of like, huh.

1280
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:39,500
So yeah, I give it an 8 overall, I mean, because it's good, it's solid, I mean, it just sort

1281
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:47,000
I just stuck out my head today, and this is better than what I was going to pick, because I don't think that many of our listeners would be quite prepared for the wrong stuff.

1282
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
How the hell is what the listeners think?

1283
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Okay, I'll hit lose as lucky as you please.

1284
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Bradley, what'd you think?

1285
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It was alright. I started liking it a little bit better as it went on though, so I'll give it a 7.5.

1286
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Uh, Logie?

1287
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Lame. That's all I had to say. I liked the other song much better, Astro Sexy. This was not Astro Sexy, and I didn't like it, so it gets a 5.

1288
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:19,000
It kind of sounded like elevator music, but good elevator music. I mean, I would hope that they would play that in an elevator someday while I'm in it.

1289
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:29,000
It was okay. It was a little bit long, but it was a pretty good song. I listened to it, especially in an elevator. I give it a 7.5 as well, I think. I think I'm on the same page as Bradley.

1290
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,760
Alright, let's move on to song number three in tonight's cage match

1291
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:40,240
I picked it and it's by an artist called karma Club and I actually never heard of him until I just randomly download this song

1292
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:46,320
On iTunes, but I was kind of like, huh? This kind of reminds me of like smile DK like but American so

1293
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,840
Look, he says he hates it already. Well, you be the judge

1294
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:56,840
This is a song called Lucky Star, and the group is Karma Club. Enjoy, it's my pick for tonight's game match.

1295
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:33,840
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

1296
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,840
Last night as I lay dreaming

1297
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,840
This strangest kind of feeling

1298
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:44,840
Revealed its secret meaning

1299
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,840
And now I know

1300
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:50,240
I've never ever been to paradise

1301
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,840
I've never ever seen no angel sigh

1302
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,840
No, never ever let this magic die

1303
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,840
No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

1304
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:19,840
Last night as I lay dreaming

1305
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,840
This strange, just kind of feeling

1306
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,840
Reveals its secret meaning

1307
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:39,840
And now I know I've never ever been to paradise I've never ever seen no angel's eyes No never ever let this magic die

1308
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:43,840
No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

1309

I've never ever been to paradise No, never ever let this magic die

1313
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:43,840
And now I know I've never ever been to paradise

1314
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:50,840
I've never ever seen no angel sighs No, never ever let this magic die

1315
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:54,840
No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

1316
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,840
Where have I been to paradise?

1317
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,840
I've never ever seen no angels die

1318
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,840
No never ever let this magic die

1319
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:09,840
No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

1320

Na na na na na

1323
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:55,840
The song number three in tonight's cage match, that was Lucky Star by a band called Karma Club there.

1324
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:58,840
Alright, let's go around and see what everybody thought of that song.

1325
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:01,840
Bradley, we'll start with you since Jamie's just returning.

1326
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,840
Oh, you're back now. Okay, never mind.

1327
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,840
Alright, Jamie. Alright, what did you think of that?

1328
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,840
It was too happy.

1329
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:10,840
Okay. I've heard it before.

1330
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:13,840
Yeah, a lot of people in our chat room had heard it before, they said.

1331
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,840
I think it was the first time I heard it today.

1332
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,840
Ehh, seven.

1333
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:20,840
I guess it's, yeah, something.

1334
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,840
It gets an S.

1335
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:22,840
It gets a...

1336
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:23,840
Alright.

1337
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,840
Uh, Bradley?

1338
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:27,840
It's a generic pop song over a dance beat.

1339
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,840
Uh, 5.5.

1340
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,840
Uh, Logie?

1341
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,840
It's just like, no.

1342
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:33,840
No.

1343
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,840
No, it gets a one.

1344
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:36,840
No.

1345
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,840
Oh god, I hope it wins.

1346
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:40,840
Extra bad now.

1347
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,840
Alright, uh, I give it like a...

1348
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,840
Like a nine, because it's happy.

1349
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:50,840
And it's a total DDR song. It is a total DDR song. Can't deny that. It's a total DDR song. What?

1350
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,840
I think we just need to admit it. Echo Image is gonna win again.

1351
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,840
Well, we will find out. Let's review the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1352
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:03,540
Tonight, we have song number one, last week's champion,

1353
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:04,860
Ego Emojis will come back.

1354
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:19,860
And song number two in tonight's cage match,

1355
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:22,220
M-Flow with You Said.

1356
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:41,060
And song number three in tonight's cage match was Lucky Star by Karma Club.

1357
01:47:52,220 --> 01:48:02,060
Alright, place vote now in our chat room. Send a private message to Sky with your vote

1358
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:09,500
for either Mflow or Karma Club or Echo Image. Alright, so we'll be looking for your votes

1359
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:17,340
there in our chat room. Meanwhile, oh my gosh iTunes just crashed my whole damn computer.

1360
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:20,280
I think we're, no we're okay, we're still up, we're still up and running but just iTunes

1361
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:26,400
crashed, it was kind of scary. Alright, meanwhile, I noticed Loki's looking on a site about,

1362
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:30,020
that has to do with some other Bomani news that came out this week. I guess there's this

1363
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:34,180
guy and he does a lot of music for other video games that I don't really play, but apparently

1364
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:38,540
a lot of you people know him and he's kind of popular. His name is Jesper Kidd, K-Y-D,

1365
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:43,460
right? And he does a lot of songs for other video games. Do you have a little clip of

1366
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:47,140
some Jesper Kidd songs here? Because Jesper Kidd has announced he's going to be doing

1367
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:53,140
three songs for DR Ultramix 2, which is kind of nice. So, alright, we're trying to find

1368
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:57,780
a little clip of a Jesper Kids song to play for you guys here. Let's see if we can get

1369
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:02,780
a little, just anything. Just play us anything so we can get a feel for what this guy sounds

1370
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:14,780
like. Ooh. Well, maybe we'll get that industrial music you've been looking for, Jamie. He does

1371
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:20,780
He does stuff that's very similar to, like, Quake-type music, you know, very, that dark industrial-type stuff.

1372
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:25,780
This stuff right here is from, uh, Freedom Fighters, that game, that's the main theme.

1373
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:27,780
This is another one, Fight for Three.

1374
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:29,780
I want that, that's cool.

1375
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:42,180
Anyways, there's those. But what I was mentioning, or going to mention actually from his website

1376
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:48,260
here. Let me get to him again. I want to add real fast the three songs that he has announced

1377
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:53,900
for Ultramix 2. Istanbul Cafe is one. Red Room is another song. And then this other

1378
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:59,520
interesting one 5 9 or 59 kid Konami mix and kind of the question now is is that

1379
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:07,200
a remix of dot 5 9 question mark yes it is and how do you know this I can't say

1380
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:11,440
but yes it is oh well I didn't I didn't even know one where the other you know

1381
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,560
something I don't think is I don't know if this was a remix or not because a

1382
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:21,960
certain person mentioned something about a I don't know point five nine remix

1383
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,600
Alright, then I guess it is a 0.59 remix. I didn't know!

1384
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:30,480
Well, hooray! We get a 0.59 remix by some random video game guy. That'll be fun.

1385
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:33,400
Alright. I didn't know.

1386
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:37,360
Shit.

1387
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,080
Alright. Alright.

1388
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:45,160
Uh, we will, uh, what are we gonna do? We gonna take a break? Are we gonna, uh,

1389
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:48,400
talk about more Bobani news, or what? Let's break stuff.

1390
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:54,400
Let's break stuff. Actually, you know what? We did have a request. Somebody wanted to hear that Jamelia song, Superstar.

1391
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,400
Yeah, somebody did.

1392
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:56,400
Yeah, that was you, wasn't it?

1393
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,400
Somebody sitting in this big green chair.

1394
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,400
That's what I thought. But I think the other folks thought it was a good idea as well, so...

1395
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,400
We'll play that for you guys.

1396
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:12,920
No, we're not going to play Say I've Never Done a New Story.

1397
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:17,840
We're going to play, uh, uh, we're going to play, uh, where the hell is it?

1398
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,840
Where is it?

1399
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,840
Oh, here, it's in here.

1400
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,840
Alright.

1401
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,320
Uh, there it is.

1402
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,320
Let's do this.

1403
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,320
Wow, this is great radio, you guys.

1404
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:28,320
Alright, we'll be back after this.

1405
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:31,040
It's actually the full version, because I don't have a DDR edit, but if you're going

1406
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,400
to be getting DDR Festival, you'll be playing this song, and if you're lucky enough to be

1407
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,900
begin the DDR Europe mixes. You've probably already been playing the song. It's Jamelio

1408
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:44,900
with Superstar, we'll have the cage match winner when we come back from this.

1409
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:11,900
Why did I want a piece of paper?

1410
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:15,900
Got a feeling I'll see you later

1411
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:19,900
There's something about this that's keeping moving

1412
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,900

I'm still in some connection to this thing you do

I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this

01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:39,900
I don't know who you are

1417
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:44,900
But you must be some kind of superstar

1418
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:49,900
Cause you got a lot to do no matter where you are

1419
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,900

01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:07,900
Still with all the problems later Bad boys aren't their best behavior

1422
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:12,900
There's something about you That keep it moving

1423
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:19,900
And if it's the last you hear something cooking Cause I really wanna laugh at you

1424
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:25,900
I'm still in some connection to the things you do

1425
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:29,900
I don't know what it is that makes me feel crazy

1426
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,900
I don't know who you are

1427
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:36,900
But you must be some kind of stupid love

1428
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:41,900
Cause you gotta have a view no matter where you are

1429
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,900
You do it one day

1430
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,900
I like the way you're movin'

1431
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,900
You do it one day

1432
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:49,900
I just get into the movin' then

01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:52,900
You do it one day

1434
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,900
If you just put it in the paper

1435
01:53:54,900 --> 01:54:06,900
Just got that feeling, I'll see you later Make you move, can't we get a little closer?

01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:21,900
I don't know what it is

1439
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:24,900
That makes me feel like this

1440
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:25,900
Don't know

1441
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:30,900
Gotta be, gotta be a superstar

1442
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:33,900

How don't you wanna be

1444
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:37,900
I don't know what it is

1445
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:39,900
That makes me feel like this

1446
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,900
I don't know who you are

1447
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:45,900
But you must be some kind of superstar

1448
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:58,400
No matter where you are, you can be who you are

1449
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,400
You can be who you are because you've got a life in you

1450
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:04,400
No matter where you are, you can be who you are

1451
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:09,400
You can be who you are, you can be who you are

1452
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:13,400
You can't be all that way, you can't be

1453
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:43,040
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or I'll put fire ants in your shoes.

1454
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,040
Ooh, that's a good one.

1455
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,040
I love that, that was nice.

1456
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:51,640
Alright, we're back and it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage

1457
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:53,800
Match.

1458
01:55:53,800 --> 01:56:01,480
And in tonight's cage match, boys and girls, it's a big surprise, a huge surprise, actually

1459
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:06,840
first I want to say though, is that actually this is like the lowest participating cage

1460
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:10,520
thing we've had a long long time like probably since we started the segment so

1461
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:13,560
only a few both saying I don't know what's going on people are like dead I

1462
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:17,360
think we've we've resorted to being that thing that's on in the background I

1463
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:22,680
think it's what's happened to us yeah scary anyway um tonight we have a

1464
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:28,160
surprise we have a tie in tonight's cage match believe it or not which means

1465
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:32,680
someone's gonna be breaking the tie so let's find out what two songs the tie is

1466
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:43,800
between song number one is echo image

1467
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:49,960
so that is a song number one that is tied in tonight's cage match and song

1468
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:54,360
number two that is tied in tonight's cage match

1469
01:56:54,360 --> 01:57:04,380
lucky star so a bunch of inflow haters that means yes unfortunately him flow

1470
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,860
not feeling loved tonight but somebody's better be feeling the love from Jamie

1471
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:10,780
pretty soon here Jamie's got to break the tie the orange

1472
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:14,700
ons rules state that when there is a tie in the cage match the host who didn't

1473
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:20,580
end up in the tie gets to break the tie and Jamie it depends who's gonna pay me

1474
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:28,500
I accept bribes you know I'll show you my boob that's okay I don't know Shane

1475
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:35,640
who should I pick I know what he's gonna say don't don't you want to get

1476
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:41,160
something new in there for once aren't we a little thick echo image like you're

1477
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:46,880
saying we just don't like happy but look at it this way it'll lose next week for

1478
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:57,040
for sure. See, if Echo Image wins again, then I can put in Ramstein and blow out everybody's

1479
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:08,800
speakers, and that would win. Do you really want Ram to win? Well, too bad, you won. Yeah,

1480
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:15,040
reverse, alright, fine, and by a tie vote. I did it for Shane, okay? I did it because

1481
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,040
Shayne is my dunk fan.

1482
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,040
Alright.

1483
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:19,040
He's my dunk buddy.

1484
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:20,440
I was a good cliffhanger, Jayme.

1485
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:21,880
I applaud you for that one.

1486
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:23,880
That's because I'm awesome.

1487
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,880
Everybody wishes they were cool like me.

1488
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:26,880
Alright.

1489
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,040
Echo Image wins an Ice Cage match by Wapink.

1490
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:32,400
Aww, that's so sweet.

1491
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:38,120
You had their hearts racing for a minute there.

1492
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:41,220
And you know what's going to happen the minute that that song gets bumped out of the cage

1493
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:44,560
match is that somebody's going to put in that never-ending story mix.

1494
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:49,300
love echo image for the rest of our lives I already know Loki's planning on

1495
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:58,420
doing it liar all right more Bahmani news you know there's a couple other

1496
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:01,540
Bahmani games we've kind of they've kind of slipped under the cracks we haven't

1497
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:05,140
talked about them a whole lot but you know Tokyo game show happened this last

1498
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:08,660
week and it kind of you know we talked about DDR festival they had a new movie

1499
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:11,300
that showed there and it showed like the character customization and kind of

1500
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:15,300
showed us a little more what was going on with DDR Festival. Well, also, coming out

1501
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:22,540
was some more information on Pop'n Music and BeatMania 2DX, and apparently they had some

1502
01:59:22,540 --> 01:59:27,980
folks that were actually kind of doing a performance there at Tokyo Game Show, and no, unfortunately,

1503
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:31,900
we don't have clips, but what I thought was interesting is that L.E.D. was actually at

1504
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:36,100
the show, which is kind of, I had heard these rumors, yeah, but I heard these rumors he

1505
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:40,380
wasn't with Konami anymore, but here he is, showing up at Tokyo Game Show, helping promote,

1506
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:42,600
So I think he's back or something.

1507
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:49,180
And then they actually had VJ, TA-K was there, and Slake!

1508
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:53,440
And LED vs. Slake was performing, which kind of gives you a hint that, gee, I wonder if

1509
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:57,820
there's going to be an 8th consumer style song like that.

1510
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:04,160
And let's see, there was a song called Human Scramble from the anime A Human Crossing.

1511
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:07,940
I guess it was something performed by Aki...

1512
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:16,580
Aki Asahina, let me see, gimme gimme gimme, I don't know, I'm so white, I'm sorry boys

1513
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:23,900
and girls, try that, Aki Asahina, Asahina, so I was kinda right, alright, and it's gonna

1514
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:28,620
be a song called, there's also a song called Dance With Me, Tell Me More, and Tell Me More

1515
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:32,940
is gonna be on the 2DX8 style limited edition, so, ooh, that's right, cause I'm ordering

1516
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:39,420
that. Yeah, so, you know, that probably gives you an indication. There's a group called

1517
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:43,880
Guzzle that performed, and they did a song called The Bottom of Same Sky, and a song

1518
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:48,880
called Egoist, which is going to be in Poppin' Music 10. And the full version of Egoist is

1519
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:54,540
going to show up on the Poppin' Music 10 limited edition. So, lots of fun news there for Poppin'

1520
02:00:54,540 --> 02:01:01,760
Music 10 and 2DX8 style as well. And then Sana and Togo were there, and they performed

1521
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:07,400
a song called Custom Made Girl Not For Sale. Dude, that's awesome. That's the best song

1522
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:11,000
name ever. It sounds very much like a pop and music song, but we don't really know which

1523
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,520
way it's going yet. And then a song called Everyday Lovely Day, which is going to be

1524
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:20,560
on the pop and music 10, consumer style. And then a remixed version by LED is going to

1525
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:27,880
be in 2DX8 style. So lots of new stuff coming out on these two soundtracks, pop and music

1526
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:31,880
and 2DX8 styles as well as in the games that are coming out November 18th.

1527
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:32,880
We love LED.

1528
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:33,880
Yes.

1529
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:35,880
We love LED and groovy.

1530
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:40,880
Why does this stuff all have to come out at the same time? That's the problem. I got no money. I'm po.

1531
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:45,880
Because they want to get as much money from us as possible. They want to suck us dry.

1532
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:46,880
I guess so.

1533
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:50,880
They want all of our money to belong to Konami of Japan.

1534
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:51,880
I guess so.

1535
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,880
It's a corporate plot.

1536
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:55,880
Conspiracy.

1537
02:01:55,880 --> 02:02:01,640
Because, you know that K-Set's using all the money to build a giant robot?

1538
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,640
They're using it to build Metal Gear.

1539
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:04,640
Hm.

1540
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:07,640
I don't know.

1541
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:11,140
Right, okay. Alright, gotcha.

1542
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:13,640
Uh, trying to think of any other Bimani news.

1543
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:17,140
Actually, I'm going to go over to Loki, since we haven't heard from him in a little bit, and ask Loki.

1544
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:19,780
Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

1545
02:02:19,780 --> 02:02:21,780
Surely there must be something.

1546
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:24,080
I'm sure there is.

1547
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:46,080
but I don't know what that is. Let me look. Now, other than TDR Maniacs being fucking slow as hell, let's see here. I think I mentioned last week that Alpha24 came out, not that anyone cares. Why they're up to Alpha24 is beyond me, but they are.

1548
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:59,080
So, yeah. Other than that, there's a poll, I think, still going on for what characters should be ripped next, since the Fifth Mix characters are almost completely ripped for use with StepMania.

1549
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:12,080
Some themes are being worked on right now. The DDR9 Red, which is obviously a rip-off of 2DX Red's theme, and Transmokina 5, which a lot of people that are out there in the Sim world know about.

1550
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:19,580
Also, there's, of course, you know, Techno Fiends still being worked on. Really nice right now.

1551
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:22,280
But, you know, that's just basic theme stuff.

1552
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:33,580
DDR UK will have Ultramix Pack 6 and the DDR Extreme US tracks as soon as their downloads come back up.

1553
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:40,080
The Extreme tracks, I know, are almost done. Ultramix Pack 6 are done. They're just waiting to be uploaded.

1554
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:59,080
So fire them!

1555
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:17,080
Fire the goddamn judges and set some deadlines next time! Seriously, I mean, sorry, but, you know.

1556
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:22,080
Well, they also had their server thing where they got a new server recently, so, you know, there was that.

1557
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:27,080
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright. Fine, whatever, beggars can't be choosers, I guess.

1558
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:29,080
Yeah, we can.

1559
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:35,080
Any exciting remixes, though? Oh, you played some of them a couple weeks ago when I wasn't here, huh? Yeah, alright.

1560
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:39,840
I'm just found out just just found out just now there's a good chance I'm not

1561
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:46,160
gonna be here next week yeah something's going on you know about it what are you

1562
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:52,400
playing yeah way to go there's something going on I'll tell you off-air but you

1563
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:57,640
actually already know about it you just probably forgot it was next Sunday yeah

1564
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:02,880
oh whoa now she makes old face oh yeah I'm probably not be here either so we'll

1565
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,880
We'll probably have a pre-taped show next week for you guys, I think that's what we're going to have to do.

1566
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,880
We need to go, like, to Golf Land and do a show again.

1567
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:10,880
That's why I kind of want to do a show from the ghetto.

1568
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,880
That means going to Scandia.

1569
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,880
I think that would be fun to do a show from the ghetto.

1570
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,880
In the ghetto?

1571
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:18,880
We'll see.

1572
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:22,880
I don't know, I thought that our last one we did at Golf Land was funny when they almost threw us out.

1573
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:24,880
That was pretty funny. I would kind of...

1574
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,880
We could go play the StepMania machine the next day.

1575
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,880
Until we said, but we're promoting you.

1576
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:35,880
It's a good idea. We could go to Golf Land and play the new Step Media Machine, although I hear it kinda sucks, and that's not Loki's fault. It's just the fact that the computer inside sucks.

1577
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:46,880
Well, the only way it sucks is the fact that it has a default skin with no movies, but other than that, the pads do suck, and that's not my fault at all. That's their shit, you know?

1578
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:52,880
I tried, hey, my original computer specifications worked very well with video and all that shit.

1579
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:58,880
It's just, you know what, when someone else does the job for you, it just doesn't quite come out how you wanted it.

1580
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:04,880
You know, I just don't care because I wasn't going to spend any more time nor money on that.

1581
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:11,880
However, what has come to my attention, and I plan on doing this, I have to come up with $200 though,

1582
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:20,440
though, is, um, apparently, Channel Beat's having a sale. Uh oh. And you know what that

1583
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:27,120
means? That means I get my parts for my cabinet. Those parts being my Dance Maniac sensors

1584
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:35,360
dropped from $50 a piece to now, or $59 a piece to $29 a piece. Awesome. So, arcade

1585
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:40,700
perfect Dance Maniac sensors and all the other shit. I just have to figure out if I can use

1586
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:45,100
those sensors or not because I don't know if it connects to an Airface board and uh yeah.

1587
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:49,500
You can always make modifications for your face. I'm sure I could get to work even you know even

1588
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:55,740
if I just had to. Break out a ballpoint pen and some uh paper clips you know. But you know what

1589
02:06:55,740 --> 02:07:00,780
I found out that's very interesting and it does tie in with StepMania. StepMania is license

1590
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:09,580
agreement basically. You can take StepMania modify it how you want as far as theme whatever

1591
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:12,940
put your own songs in it create your own

1592
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:16,980
theme and you can sell it and you can make money off of it

1593
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:20,500
and all you have to do is just say powered by set mania or whatever

1594
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:24,340
that got me thinking well wouldn't it be cool to make a new arcade game

1595
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:27,460
hmm I don't know

1596
02:07:27,460 --> 02:07:31,620
I want to make something like dance maniacs I want to at least do it for

1597
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:35,300
you know my cabinet itself the waving the hands game

1598
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:38,740
no I want to do something across like with dance maniacs and

1599
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:43,680
What was it? Is it like Technomotion? No, not necessarily like Technomotion.

1600
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:47,380
Dance Maniacs and Para Para,

1601
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:51,400
which basically would be, it would sort of be like Para Para, but it would have top

1602
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:54,060
and bottom sensors in a way. Make the country line dancing game.

1603
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:57,980
No, not country line dancing. That's retarded. What I want to do now is I want to have

1604
02:07:57,980 --> 02:08:01,220
infrared sensors, because you can actually do some sensors where they have different trigger

1605
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:02,020
points, you know,

1606
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:06,540
below a certain level. So I basically have, like, you know, up to waist high or whatever.

1607
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:19,540
That'd be one set of five sensors, and then, um, above that'd be another set, but without those stupid, you know, actual, um, things in front of you, so you don't keep hitting them with your hand, and then have, you know, cool, like, technotran stuff to go with it.

1608
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:21,040
Do mocap dance.

1609
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:25,540
It'd be awesome, but, um, that's what I wanna do, at least, but, who knows?

1610
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:32,540
I, just have to say, cause I have, the only problem with the buy-off channel beat, you have to spend a $200 minimum.

1611
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:33,540
Ouch.

1612
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:54,540
So, you know, I can buy the Dance Maniac sensors. That's gonna be about, you know, say I buy three, or no, four of them. That's gonna be, you know, a good, you know, $120, and I still have $80 left that I have to spend on that, so I can maybe buy another sensor and some miscellaneous crap, and then, you know, maybe set up this weird dance thing or whatever.

1613
02:08:55,540 --> 02:09:00,540
It's just, I don't know. I think it'd be cool, but, you know, what do I know?

1614
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:03,540
You could buy a turntable.

1615
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:34,020
turntable parts.

1616
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:36,900
Rip up an arcade-style controller?

1617
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:39,740
Not worth the $500 you'd have to spend mine.

1618
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:44,140
I'm still pissed off about my order, because I had everything. I had my

1619
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:47,180
friend living in Tokyo who was going to have

1620
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:50,460
my arcade controller delivered to her apartment.

1621
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:55,340
But no. They had to reject my credit card. Thank you, Konami.

1622
02:09:55,340 --> 02:10:00,020
Yeah, it's just... I don't know. But...

1623
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:03,980
I don't know. We'll just see. I just need to finish my cabinet first.

1624
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:07,080
I need to stop taking on extra projects.

1625
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:10,700
But I... See, the problem is right now... Focus. I have... Well, I'm focusing.

1626
02:10:10,700 --> 02:10:14,340
Just my fucking iPad's broken. My old iPad 2 is broken,

1627
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:19,600
I think, because it's been flipping out weird when I hook up the, um,

1628
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:22,980
dance pads to it, and so I bought a new one that's coming.

1629
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:28,060
Uh, iPad, uh, what is it? Value Edition V, or something like that, which

1630
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:41,060
Oddly enough, it has more sensors than the iPad 2, and it's USB only, but that's coming this week, and so once I get that, then I'll be able to work on my cabinet again, because-

1631
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:45,060
I think that you need to open your gate to hell.

1632
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:50,060
I'm gonna do that later. I have to finish that too, but I need to get this stuff done.

1633
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:52,500
I want to get my cabinet stuff done because the weather is going to be turning for the

1634
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:56,820
worse and I won't be able to work on it during the winter because it's raining like a bitch

1635
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:58,500
and you know I have my wood.

1636
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:03,260
So what I want to do is I want to fucking sit down, get a friend to help me, and just

1637
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:08,420
chop up all that wood that I've got out there to like you know nice two foot by four foot

1638
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:12,660
sections so I can actually you know finish that.

1639
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:15,940
No we're not calling it low key motion because that's retarded.

1640
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:17,380
I liked it.

1641
02:11:17,380 --> 02:11:18,860
That was cute.

1642
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:25,220
cute but it's retarded low-key motion low-key motion

1643
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:29,940
I saw my comment to Kylie

1644
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:32,740
anyway I'm done so

1645
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:36,740
well we can talk about you get pissed off yeah

1646
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:40,160
I I just wanna ask for a minute what the fuck is wrong with everybody tonight and

1647
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:40,940
not you guys

1648
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:44,380
but I'm like God it's like is it something in the air is everybody on

1649
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:46,780
their period what is going on tonight

1650
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:50,280
Like, it's just like, we're, everything is dead tonight. It's like...

1651
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:51,280
It's because people...

1652
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:54,280
Are we being invaded by aliens? What is going on?

1653
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:55,280
Now...

1654
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:58,280
Is our show old? Have we jumped the shark?

1655
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:02,780
We did not jump the shark, okay? If we were gonna jump the shark, it would have been when we let Loki sing.

1656
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:04,280
I agree.

1657
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:10,780
People need to wake up.

1658
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:13,280
Seriously.

1659
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,280
But I'm sleepy too, Rob.

1660
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:16,280
I know.

1661
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:21,280
I'm not saying everybody's dead, but it's just like God. I mean, seriously, tonight's kind of like, deader than usual.

1662
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:24,280
We have people in our chatroom and we love and adore them.

1663
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:29,280
I know. I know. I know just the thing to perk people up. I know just the thing.

1664
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:30,280
I know just the thing.

1665
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:33,280
Who has not convinced the tax concert.

1666
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:35,280
Rob, first of all.

1667
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,280
That made me feel better.

1668
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:41,280
I swear, you do the whole little schoolgirl...

1669
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:45,060
it's like a schoolgirl combined with dr. evil but you know

1670
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:48,480
it's very cute

1671
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:53,840
some people are saying they're trying to call us and they can't get through

1672
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:56,480
because I'm being a bitch and haven't opened the sky plane huh

1673
02:12:56,480 --> 02:13:00,360
yeah I turned off but I turned it back on just now so

1674
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:03,960
that's fine if somebody wants to call us and tell us that you know

1675
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:08,160
someone wants to pick up the pace a little bit call us or we'll play let them move

1676
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:08,880
no we will not

1677
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:13,160
No, I wouldn't even do that. I would do that if like nobody was...

1678
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:16,440
I don't know, if I really wasn't getting something my way.

1679
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:20,680
Yeah, 1-900, hot.

1680
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:24,360
Alright. Oh yay, we're getting a call. See, that's how it works. Hi, you're on Ornson's Radio.

1681
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:27,760
Hello? Hello? Hi!

1682
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:34,480
I'm sorry, um, if I try to turn it down on the 365, it turns everything else down.

1683
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:43,480
So, see if I mute it, then it mutes you guys, so I suppose maybe I should just stop it?

1684
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:44,480
Can you hear us okay?

1685
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:46,480
Yeah, I can hear you guys now.

1686
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:47,480
Yay!

1687
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:48,480
Yeah, we can hear you fine.

1688
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:51,480
You're like one of the most clear callers we've ever had call the show.

1689
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:58,480
Seriously, well I just got my headset a couple days ago, so I finally decided to call and say hello.

1690
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:00,480
Kudos to your internet connection, now tell us who you are.

1691
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:01,480
This is Rai-Chan.

1692
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:02,480
Hi Rai-Chan!

1693
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:03,480
Hi!

1694
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:06,700
a new caller we don't get a lot of girls calling the show

1695
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:10,400
so I'm glad the right check call we have we have misty and I think Irene called

1696
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,520
a few while back but you know we don't get a whole lot

1697
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:16,440
in comparison so what's up right here not a whole lot I tried to call you guys

1698
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:18,880
before just as you guys went to the break

1699
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,560
oh you were talking about DVR festival in quad mode and all that stuff

1700
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:25,600
yep what was on your mind me I'll just

1701
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:30,160
the whole I'm one of those import only I don't have us versions at all

1702
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:35,660
Is there any reason for that? Is it just because you bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 first, and then...

1703
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:39,160
Two years ago, um, when my first boyfriend and I broke up.

1704
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:39,660
Uh-huh.

1705
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:45,160
Um, I had him, he owed me money, so I bought a Japanese PS2 with what he owed me.

1706
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:50,160
Hey, you know what? I inherited a third and fourth style out of a previous relationship, so...

1707
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:52,660
Isn't that the best way to get new stuff?

1708
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:54,160
Of course!

1709
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:58,660
Most, most of, most of my DDRs actually do come from other people.

1710
02:14:58,660 --> 02:15:05,660
My third mix I bought for myself, my fourth my mom bought for me in exchange for doing

1711
02:15:05,660 --> 02:15:12,660
housework, fifth mix Jason bought for me, sixth mix my brother got me for Christmas,

1712
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:18,820
seventh I bought for myself just before a tournament, extreme my second boyfriend got

1713
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:19,820
for me.

1714
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:20,820
Wow!

1715
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:21,820
You know what?

1716
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:23,500
I want people to start buying me my bimani.

1717
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,740
Why do I have to buy it?

1718
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:27,740
Well, Loki did buy DDR Extreme, so there's that.

1719
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:31,740
Festival will be a gift from somebody too, whenever that finally comes.

1720
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:34,740
That's where you have the collection Derival Mine.

1721
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:40,740
Yeah, Rai-Chan actually has her collection posted. Is it public on the internet somewhere?

1722
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:43,740
It's in my LiveJournal user info.

1723
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:46,740
Do you want to say that on the air? I don't know.

1724
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:50,740
That doesn't matter to me. Actually, I'll post a link in the chatroom.

1725
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:52,740
Oh, there you go.

1726
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:53,740
Either way.

1727
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:56,740
and you can actually take a look at right chance momani collection is quite

1728
02:15:56,740 --> 02:16:00,140
impressive her momani penis is quite large

1729
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:03,820
well I

1730
02:16:03,820 --> 02:16:06,780
got rid of my pop music controller I sold it to angel

1731
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:12,300
however I still have seven which I'll give to Jason and then nine most likely I'll sell

1732
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:14,100
I'll buy it from you

1733
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:15,940
okay

1734
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:19,220
I have a pop music controller and a pop music

1735
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:22,660
yeah I sold my controller recently so I

1736
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:26,660
I still have 7 and 9 sitting around just because I didn't know anyone else to sell it to.

1737
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:28,660
I've borrowed that controller too, which is funny.

1738
02:16:28,660 --> 02:16:33,660
If you want to sell any pop music you have that you want to sell, you've got to buy it right here, because I need pop music.

1739
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:34,660
Alright, cool.

1740
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:42,660
Wow, boy! Not only do you get people to buy your new stuff for you, but you get people to buy your old shit too, I mean, God!

1741
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:48,660
And Jason wants me to post the picture of him and I, which I'll go find the link to.

1742
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:50,660
Aww, he wants to be mushy.

1743
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:55,660
We have a picture of him and I both with our entire Bimani collections.

1744
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:57,660
Oh, that is so nauseatingly cute.

1745
02:16:57,660 --> 02:16:59,660
What did you think of his chicken hat?

1746
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:03,660
What did you think of the chicken hat picture I took at E3?

1747
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:08,660
Well, you saw that I used that as one of my LiveJournal user pictures.

1748
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:10,660
I just had to bring that up because I love that picture.

1749
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:11,660
We were like, you have to wear the chicken hat.

1750
02:17:12,660 --> 02:17:13,660
Hug the cow.

1751
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:15,660
It was great.

1752
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:17,660
Let's see.

1753
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:19,660
You need to come up and visit us next.

1754
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:22,660
Wait, did you and Jason actually meet through Bamani?

1755
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:25,660
Um, DDR Freak and LiveJournal pretty much.

1756
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:30,660
Wow, that's kinda cool. Look at that, DDR Freak brings people together.

1757
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:33,660
It not only tears people apart, but it brings them together as well.

1758
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:34,660
There you go.

1759
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:37,660
You know, the internet is a good place to meet people.

1760
02:17:37,660 --> 02:17:41,660
I think the internet gets a bad rap sometimes. It can't be a good place to meet people.

1761
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:42,660
I met Dan online.

1762
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:43,660
There you go.

1763
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:45,660
Through fandom.

1764
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:48,660
Uh, anything else you want to comment on, right, Chan?

1765
02:17:48,660 --> 02:17:52,260
I'm not really just calling to say hi since I finally have everything set up.

1766
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:55,660
Well hello and thank you for the call and enjoy DER Festival when it comes out.

1767
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:58,860
Let us know how it is since none of us are probably even going to bother to get it.

1768
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:00,260
You're going to have to be our reviewer.

1769
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:01,260
Okay.

1770
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:02,260
All right.

1771
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:03,260
All right.

1772
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:04,260
Thank you guys.

1773
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:05,260
All right.

1774
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:06,260
Take care.

1775
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:07,260
Bye.

1776
02:18:07,260 --> 02:18:08,260
Bye.

1777
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:09,260
Thanks for the call.

1778
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:10,260
Oh, that was so nice.

1779
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:11,260
Yay.

1780
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:12,260
We got some comments in the chat room that she's clearer than we are.

1781
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:14,180
Her microphone's better than ours.

1782
02:18:14,180 --> 02:18:16,260
We need to know what kind of microphone she's got.

1783
02:18:16,260 --> 02:18:17,260
Seriously.

1784
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:20,180
Ryan Chen, you're going to have to send me an email.

1785
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:23,820
Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, if you ever want to send me an email, if you're a stalker

1786
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:28,120
fan and want to send me an email, that's fine, Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a good place

1787
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:29,120
to go.

1788
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,780
Okay, I guess we're going to close up the Skype line because I want to do a break because

1789
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:36,740
we've got to come back and we have to do the FUs of the week.

1790
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:37,740
That's our favorite part.

1791
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:39,060
I know, we've got to do them.

1792
02:18:39,060 --> 02:18:44,660
So send your FUs in now and in this break we're going to hear some keyboard mania music.

1793
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:48,960
Yeah, I knew that would be the first word out of your mouth, Jamie.

1794
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:54,200
I love sensation. It's play sensation, so it's the first thing I have queued up for you.

1795
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:57,200
So here we go, a whole break of keyboard mania music. Enjoy, we'll be back.

1796
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:58,200
the

1797
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:02,200
the

1798
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:06,200
the

1799
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:10,200
the

1800
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:14,200
the

1801
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:18,200
the

1802
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:22,200
the

1803
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:46,800
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1804
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:47,800
We are back.

1805
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:50,000
What the hell are you laughing at over there?

1806
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,920
Nothing is funny.

1807
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:56,240
I'm laughing at DJ Nostalgia's icon on DJ Remaniacs.

1808
02:25:56,240 --> 02:25:58,200
It's this little stick figure trying to pick up a flower

1809
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:00,360
to give it to the female stick figure,

1810
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:01,520
but the flower keeps moving.

1811
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:03,480
So then he finally gets pissed off and kicks the flower,

1812
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:06,320
and it hits the chick in the head, and she runs off.

1813
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:08,680
Funny.

1814
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:10,440
Hilarious.

1815
02:26:10,440 --> 02:26:12,600
That's all I have to say.

1816
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:14,360
All right, well, the theme of tonight

1817
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:17,560
has kind of been like being dead, I guess,

1818
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:19,620
because you guys have all been dead.

1819
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:24,620
So, we decided we're going to pick things up a little bit with some good old-fashioned FUs.

1820
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:28,620
Jamie, why do we have to do some good old-fashioned FUs anyway?

1821
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:33,620
We are full of angst and anger, and if we don't let it out, we'll explode and destroy half of the world.

1822
02:26:33,620 --> 02:26:54,060
My first epi of the evening goes to the driver of this Volkswagen Passat that was in front

1823
02:26:54,060 --> 02:26:55,060
of me.

1824
02:26:55,060 --> 02:27:00,740
First of all, I normally give the thumbs up to good German engineering, but these are

1825
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:04,800
cars that are meant to be driven at 100 miles an hour on the Autobahn, not 25

1826
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:11,780
miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone. Another SU goes to me for drinking so

1827
02:27:11,780 --> 02:27:17,920
much vodka last night and you know I will say whatever is on my mind while I

1828
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:25,880
am drunk and I got very flirty so SU to my lack of restraint while I'm

1829
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:40,000
while I'm intoxicated. Another F.U. goes toward this particular bit of software that I've

1830
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:46,080
acquired that requires a certain thing to make said software work. So now I can't use

1831
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:52,200
it. A big, humongous, whopping F.U. goes to freakin' PaintShop Pro 8 for not letting

1832
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:59,480
me change the size of my brush because I want to go and do little fine detailed work and

1833
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:04,720
go edit out backgrounds and stuff so that I can have transparencies and a stupid brush

1834
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:06,920
will not let me change the damn size of it.

1835
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:09,440
Photoshop is ass, okay?

1836
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:14,080
I do not like Photoshop, even though I'm going to have to take a class in it, but that means

1837
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:17,280
that I'm going to have to go back to using PaintShop Pro 7, except PaintShop Pro 8

1838
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:23,820
it has some really good filters in it but um and also if you to the potential

1839
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:28,100
class I have to take in Photoshop even though I don't care for Photoshop all

1840
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:31,560
that much except it does have also really nice filters and I like the way

1841
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:38,500
it does layers better but and if you goes toward another thing about Paint

1842
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:43,060
Shop Pro 8 for not letting me freaking rotate my text in a curve the way I want

1843
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:48,940
too. It's doing some weird vector thing that's really pissing me off. So that means that

1844
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:56,940
I have to do 10 sideshow posters for Halloween by hand. I have to ink them and then color

1845
02:28:56,940 --> 02:29:03,340
them on the computer. At least I can do some neat stuff to it and make it look cool once

1846
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:07,700
I have drawn it and scanned it. And at least I don't have to do some heavy shading on it

1847
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:11,420
either. It's all primary colors, but it's just my hand's going to be falling off. And

1848
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:15,560
And I have other drawings I really, really want to work on too.

1849
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:21,840
So as it stands, I'm just going to have to, I guess, find some time.

1850
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:25,120
At least I've done all the homework for one of my classes, but.

1851
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:32,080
Oh yeah, and another F.U. toward not having my Copic markers anymore, because I finally,

1852
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:35,240
three of my Copic markers dried out, and that means I have to go pay another twenty bucks

1853
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:38,920
to get another set, so.

1854
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:43,560
And also just an F.U. to the Color Copics for being so damn expensive anyway.

1855
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:49,720
I mean, true, you're paying for quality and alcohol-based ink, but, ugh, so expensive.

1856
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:53,200
And I'm retracting an F.U. this week to Dell.

1857
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:57,280
Whoa, is that a first, that you're retracting an F.U.?

1858
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,280
Oh, alright.

1859
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:02,960
Because I was all pissed off because I didn't think Dell was sending my computer, my laptop.

1860
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:08,600
And then I got the notice yesterday, they weren't going to ship my laptop until like

1861
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:10,020
mid-october

1862
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:12,380
my laptop shipped thursday

1863
02:30:12,380 --> 02:30:14,780
so next week i will be here with my laptop well if

1864
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:15,740
if i'm here next week

1865
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:17,360
i'll be here with my laptop

1866
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:20,640
yeah we're probably not gonna be here next week but yeah we have obligations

1867
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:21,540
but um...

1868
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:23,060
regardless

1869
02:30:23,060 --> 02:30:25,840
i'm gonna have my laptop

1870
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:29,600
and that will make me a happy bunny

1871
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:31,040
happy happy bunny

1872
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:32,680
a one final f u

1873
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:35,100
to my happy bunny t-shirt

1874
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:38,380
and my happy bunny t-shirt had pink fuzzy fur on it

1875
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:41,460
And now he looks like he's got a goatee over his belly.

1876
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:43,940
It's cause it's like the bottom of his mouth

1877
02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:45,540
is like by his belly.

1878
02:30:45,540 --> 02:30:47,980
So he looks like he's just got

1879
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:49,540
bad chest hair.

1880
02:30:49,540 --> 02:30:52,820
And like the rest of them is rub all raw.

1881
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:55,840
Another F you goes to Rob's cell phone.

1882
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:59,140
It should be on silent while we're on the show.

1883
02:30:59,140 --> 02:31:02,300
Sorry. Yeah.

1884
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:05,060
And that's it. I'm spent.

1885
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:11,060
Let's move on to Loki and see what he's pissed off about this time.

1886
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:15,060
Well, first off I'm gonna be pissed off at my toe because I just

1887
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:16,860
squeezed it really hard in this big

1888
02:31:16,860 --> 02:31:19,160
pussy clump thing

1889
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:20,780
I was, but

1890
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:24,880
I need to let it dry out because before, you know, with a band-aid it just stays wet.

1891
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,540
I don't have any gauze.

1892
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:30,380
So anyways, I squeezed this big clump of whatever out because it looked like it was

1893
02:31:30,380 --> 02:31:33,980
pussying a little bit so I was like seeing how bad it was.

1894
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:38,980
But it wasn't that, it was like some of the gauze that was left over from the other thing I hadn't pulled out.

1895
02:31:38,980 --> 02:31:44,980
It was in the hole where they pulled the nail out, and that didn't feel too good.

1896
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:48,980
But it feels better now that it's full of Neosporin.

1897
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:52,980
And the other side's doing the same thing, so I think I gotta squeeze a little harder there, but that's kinda gross.

1898
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:55,980
Anyways, um, so fuck you that, cause that sucks.

1899
02:31:55,980 --> 02:32:00,980
Um, fuck you to stupid people yesterday, I swear to God, everyone was trying to kill me.

1900
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:07,980
And it's because the really shitty drivers out there driving too slow, not looking when they change lanes, and just, you know, blatantly trying to kill me.

1901
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:10,980
So fuck you because you failed, I'm still here.

1902
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:17,980
Fuck you to denios for sucking. I never realized how many cell phone case booths there could be in one place.

1903
02:32:17,980 --> 02:32:28,980
I mean, I didn't really need a cell phone case, or a new faceplate because there's tons of those faceplate booths, nor did I need any used underwear, or samurai swords! I swear to God!

1904
02:32:28,980 --> 02:32:34,580
to god this is places like we have power tools we have bungee cords and we have samurai swords

1905
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:41,460
where the hell did that fit in that's just weird hey i thought i bought some korean pop speed either

1906
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:47,380
okay that's cool but that was the only like cool thing that was there i walked around that it's

1907
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:52,900
just it's not the same anymore it's like we win it around two to three o'clock i mean that is not

1908
02:32:52,900 --> 02:32:58,900
very early but it's not late in the day I mean and there was already half the

1909
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:02,560
people that already packed up and left in fact they were closing the fucking

1910
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:07,480
you know food vending booths down at three and they closed at five like what

1911
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:11,620
the fuck two hours early that's a little ridiculous but whatever so they were

1912
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:17,400
doing that and that was really lame and wasted my time but also fuck you to

1913
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:21,920
shark's tail because it was kind of lame but I went and saw it for free so that

1914
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:27,720
wasn't that lame but it just still sucked and I it was a waste of my time

1915
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:36,440
and finally just you know I don't really know I have a lot more stuff earlier this

1916
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:41,160
week and I just cannot remember it for the life of me now fuck you to goddamn

1917
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:46,000
roundtable today okay now I bought a personal pizza and twist their twist are

1918
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,700
fucking huge if I knew they're fucking huge I would just bought the twist but

1919
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:53,260
not only that they didn't cook them all the way through they were damn good so I

1920
02:33:53,260 --> 02:34:02,580
ate them all but I had to take a very bad shit when I got home so at least it

1921
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:06,140
felt like it it wasn't it was just you know it's just you know one of those

1922
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:11,180
things like urgent emergency you know that's not a feeling I want to have

1923
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:15,340
after you know eating at round table cuz I love round table and I was it was

1924
02:34:15,340 --> 02:34:18,140
ironic because I was telling a story about how I used to make twists out of

1925
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:22,460
large pizza skin that were like a good you know three feet long when you're done with

1926
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:29,260
them which is awesome but i don't know they're still good though but um except for that Nephew

1927
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:33,820
Comedy Central we're playing Dogma yet again my god i don't like need to see that movie anymore

1928
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:43,500
it's just at least you have cable trust me you're not missing anything and i'm done

1929
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:49,500
I'm trying out a new F.U. song tonight. I don't know how it'll work, but I want something new.

1930
02:34:51,500 --> 02:34:53,500
You're not allowed to have anything you love.

1931
02:34:54,500 --> 02:35:03,500
I would like to give an F.U. to that person I was already giving F.U.s to earlier who just made themselves look like an ass.

1932
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:10,500
I want to give an F.U. to myself for having a little bit too much to drink last night

1933
02:35:10,500 --> 02:35:13,500
and kind of forcing myself to stay in Chico until really late.

1934
02:35:13,500 --> 02:35:16,500
Although actually I had a really good time so I have absolutely nothing to be bitching about

1935
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:21,500
but I need to learn to say no to drinking a lot better.

1936
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,500
Because I'm going to get myself in trouble some time. What?

1937
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:25,500
Just say no.

1938
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:34,500
And then I want to give an F.U. to Unnecessary Drummer and people that get off on perpetuating other people's trauma.

1939
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:46,500
And I really, actually I think I had like a pretty good week, all things considered, to be honest, so I don't have like a whole bunch to give F.U.s to.

1940
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:51,500
Oh! F you to people that make fun of my name on Ultramix.

1941
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:54,500
Like, I freakin' join games on Ultramix and people are like,

1942
02:35:54,500 --> 02:35:56,500
It's Green Ski!

1943
02:35:56,500 --> 02:36:01,500
First of all, it's Green Sky, but since you don't know how to read, I'll forgive you.

1944
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:05,500
But, it's just like, you know, and then I go and kick your ass.

1945
02:36:05,500 --> 02:36:10,500
And you're like, you know, you just tell me I'm on a controller or something, even though I'm not.

1946
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:12,500
I'm actually on a dance pad.

1947
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:19,460
And um, just in general, retards. Not actual people who are actually retarded, I mean there's

1948
02:36:19,460 --> 02:36:23,300
nothing they can do about it, but I mean people who act retarded and they have no reason to

1949
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:31,980
be. Is it, is it F you related? Okay, Loki has something F you related. Fuck you in the

1950
02:36:31,980 --> 02:36:37,220
bush because you look like an idiot during the debate, that's all.

1951
02:36:37,220 --> 02:36:41,220
What's going on, Bradley?

1952
02:36:41,220 --> 02:36:48,220
The only thing I really have to say is fuck you to have to go another month being frugal.

1953
02:36:48,220 --> 02:36:54,220
Even with my pay raise, I gotta pay off bills and stuff, so I can't really do very much for next month.

1954
02:36:54,220 --> 02:36:57,220
But, oh well. That's about it.

1955
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:04,220
Oh, that was quick. Fair enough. Let's go to the chat room and see what our chat room has to bitch about this time.

1956
02:37:04,220 --> 02:37:09,500
Elle Mulletz wants to say an F you to the chat room for being so dead not my fault

1957
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:13,780
and F you to idiots who claim you're a company fanboy for liking their games

1958
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:15,340
and on behalf of DarkSakura

1959
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:18,940
an F you to Cosmo Magazine she knows why.

1960
02:37:18,940 --> 02:37:23,740
Oh my god that's the one I forgot? I opened up Cosmo to read the crappy

1961
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:27,780
sex tips they put in there because they're hilarious because you know they're not realistic at all

1962
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:31,700
and like I'm assaulted by what's the name of this rainbow

1963
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:39,700
out of the ass or something, perfume. It's beyond paradise. And it smells like beyond

1964
02:37:39,700 --> 02:37:50,380
Hades is what it smells like. Okay, thank you. Beyond the garbage dump. Beyond fecal

1965
02:37:50,380 --> 02:37:57,620
matter or something, I don't know. Otaku Rat says, F you to working 11 hours on 3 hours

1966
02:37:57,620 --> 02:38:01,720
sleep

1967
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:05,720
uh... jazz says f you to elderly drivers

1968
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:09,980
for the love of god stop driving ten miles an hour and speed limit also f

1969
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:13,300
you to the people who plaster their cars with political stickers as anyone

1970
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:15,580
notices people stuck out the driving day

1971
02:38:15,580 --> 02:38:16,220
buddy

1972
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:20,700
i'd put a political sticker on my car this week so if you know

1973
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:25,140
kerry edwards sticker

1974
02:38:25,140 --> 02:38:29,140
My mother put a Carrie Edward sticker on my car, actually, and she put it on crooked.

1975
02:38:29,140 --> 02:38:32,140
You know what, neither of them are worthy of my vote. I'm voting for Phil Bikat again.

1976
02:38:32,140 --> 02:38:38,140
Well, I don't want Bush to win, and I actually kind of like Carrie, especially after the debate, so we'll see the tech.

1977
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:45,140
Jazz says, one more thing, F you to a certain in-the-groove step-file creator for being such an elitist bastard.

1978
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:48,140
Hey, where did I hear that one earlier tonight?

1979
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:54,480
This says f you to all computer image editor programs for not having a way of making a decent spiral

1980
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:58,020
Fair enough any ideas on that. I

1981
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:02,420
Don't I haven't ever had to make a spiral so

1982
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:10,900
Actually, yeah, you can do one in PaintShop Pro using the the twist like you do a straight line from the center

1983
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:15,340
And then do the twist warp and that should work you can save it as a paintbrush

1984
02:39:15,340 --> 02:39:16,340
What do you think?

1985
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:17,340
A drawing tip from Jeannie.

1986
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:24,760
Uhh VXJ's next V says F you to a lack of sleep and making me sleep through almost all the

1987
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:25,760
show.

1988
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:28,160
At least I woke up from my girlfriend's voice though.

1989
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:33,080
F you to the people who randomly bash other people they don't even know and probably do

1990
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:34,640
it only because they don't like me.

1991
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:35,640
But you know what?

1992
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:39,200
I can prevent his ability to connect to that IRC network.

1993
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:42,540
And I'm laughing too because I know exactly what he's talking about.

1994
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:47,140
And when this person gets banned from anywhere, it's good news.

1995
02:39:47,140 --> 02:39:48,540
I just told Jamie what it was.

1996
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:50,540
I was doing sign language to Jamie.

1997
02:39:50,540 --> 02:39:51,540
Oh!

1998
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:56,540
I have choice words that I'm not going to say because I've said them.

1999
02:39:56,540 --> 02:39:58,540
She'll say them on commercial break, I'm sure.

2000
02:39:58,540 --> 02:39:59,540
Yeah.

2001
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:00,540
Amen, Rai-chan.

2002
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:08,820
Also, oh yeah, he says, oh yeah, to expand on my first one, F you to sleep, making you

2003
02:40:08,820 --> 02:40:09,820
not do anything.

2004
02:40:09,820 --> 02:40:11,820
I need to go shopping.

2005
02:40:11,820 --> 02:40:18,060
You don't know how many times I've needed to go shopping, and then I'm like, hmm, sleep.

2006
02:40:18,060 --> 02:40:21,580
And then I don't end up shopping, and then I wonder why I'm hungry.

2007
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:25,660
DDR Angel says, F you to fellow students in the class that Magus and I are taking.

2008
02:40:25,660 --> 02:40:29,620
I almost called him Magus.

2009
02:40:29,620 --> 02:40:33,260
That was a total Tom Brokaw moment, I swear.

2010
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:36,260
Yeah, but Rob, there's a difference.

2011
02:40:36,260 --> 02:40:39,940
Tom Brokaw gets paid a few million a year.

2012
02:40:39,940 --> 02:40:42,700
and you don't get paid for the show.

2013
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:44,540
I know.

2014
02:40:44,540 --> 02:40:46,620
F you to fellow students in the class that...

2015
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:49,780
I mean, I've been horribly bad on my speech tonight.

2016
02:40:49,780 --> 02:40:51,380
I don't know how many things I've said,

2017
02:40:51,380 --> 02:40:54,660
like where my mind was just in three different places

2018
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:56,460
and I ran them all together

2019
02:40:56,460 --> 02:40:58,340
and just said things I didn't mean to say.

2020
02:40:58,340 --> 02:40:59,180
Oh, God.

2021
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:03,980
Angel says F you to fellow students

2022
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:06,180
in the class that Magus and I are taking.

2023
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:07,220
You asked for our help.

2024
02:41:07,220 --> 02:41:08,060
We gave it to you.

2025
02:41:08,060 --> 02:41:10,020
It's not our fault you didn't get it.

2026
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:11,380
We never said you were stupid.

2027
02:41:11,380 --> 02:41:15,940
Don't put words in our mouths to make us look bad when we are trying to be diligent students

2028
02:41:15,940 --> 02:41:17,820
just like the rest of the class.

2029
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:18,820
Grrr.

2030
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:23,860
Okay, I feel better.

2031
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:26,900
For a pretty dead chat room, that was a very ranty evening of FUs.

2032
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:30,420
I kind of am surprised.

2033
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:32,060
They were storing it, Rob.

2034
02:41:32,060 --> 02:41:33,060
Yes.

2035
02:41:33,060 --> 02:41:37,900
Alright, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from break, since

2036
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:40,660
We got a few minutes left in the show and that's how we always buy ourselves some time

2037
02:41:40,660 --> 02:41:42,300
is to do some Askorn's Lounge.

2038
02:41:42,300 --> 02:41:43,300
Huh?

2039
02:41:43,300 --> 02:41:44,300
No.

2040
02:41:44,300 --> 02:41:47,180
No, we did El Molot's like first.

2041
02:41:47,180 --> 02:41:49,300
No, that was CDR Angel who was last.

2042
02:41:49,300 --> 02:41:50,300
Okay.

2043
02:41:50,300 --> 02:41:51,300
Alright.

2044
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:53,300
We're gonna do a break.

2045
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:57,220
In this break, 2DX music, because I want to hear Love is Dreaminess.

2046
02:41:57,220 --> 02:41:58,220
So we'll be back.

2047
02:41:58,220 --> 02:42:00,380
Actually, we'll just, you know what, we'll just make it an LED break.

2048
02:42:00,380 --> 02:42:01,380
Hell with it.

2049
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:02,380
We're gonna do LED music.

2050
02:42:02,380 --> 02:42:04,380
We'll be back after this LED break.

2051
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:05,380
Enjoy.

2052
02:42:35,380 --> 02:42:39,520
La la la la la la la la la la

2053
02:44:05,380 --> 02:44:29,380
You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience, he has the whole Earth.

2054
02:46:59,380 --> 02:47:26,380
Thanks for watching and see you next time!

2055
02:47:29,380 --> 02:47:35,380
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

2056
02:47:35,380 --> 02:47:37,380
Do we want to be staffed by Hollywood?

2057
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:39,380
No!

2058
02:47:39,380 --> 02:47:41,380
Do we care what people think of us?

2059
02:47:41,380 --> 02:47:43,380
No!

2060
02:47:43,380 --> 02:47:45,380
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

2061
02:47:45,380 --> 02:47:47,380
Yeah!

2062
02:47:49,380 --> 02:47:54,380
Extreme Babani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

2063
02:47:54,380 --> 02:47:58,380
You know that promo is so old that DDR Extreme wasn't even out at that time.

2064
02:47:58,380 --> 02:48:03,660
time. And then when it was announced that the name was DDR Extreme, I was kind of

2065
02:48:03,660 --> 02:48:07,540
laughing at that promo because I called it like a long time ago. Extreme Radio.

2066
02:48:07,540 --> 02:48:14,300
Extreme! All right. We're gonna do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge. Even

2067
02:48:14,300 --> 02:48:18,060
though we've only got one freaking question so far, I guess we'll have a one

2068
02:48:18,060 --> 02:48:22,780
question night then if that's the way you guys want to have it. Fine by me. I have a

2069
02:48:22,780 --> 02:48:29,140
a question Rob okay should I start the music first or yeah all right

2070
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:38,700
let's ask orange lounge some stupid question what will we find out tonight

2071
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:45,140
on orange lounge radio that is if we even get any questions anyway because

2072
02:48:45,140 --> 02:48:50,860
As even though people are listening, we already put them to sleep.

2073
02:48:50,860 --> 02:48:57,940
Dear Orange Lounge, Why are we so cool?

2074
02:48:57,940 --> 02:49:00,180
Well, because I'm here.

2075
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:02,660
Since the air conditioner is cranked up.

2076
02:49:02,660 --> 02:49:05,340
Let's get to our first listener question.

2077
02:49:05,340 --> 02:49:12,860
Jason, Mr. VXJ6V himself says, Does anyone remember seeing Katamari Damacy?

2078
02:49:12,860 --> 02:49:26,860
I've read reports about it, but I didn't see it. I just beat the game yesterday, and it's one of the greatest I've ever played. Has anyone else played it? I've never heard of this game in my entire life.

2079
02:49:26,860 --> 02:49:27,860
I've never heard of this game.

2080
02:49:27,860 --> 02:49:28,860
What?

2081
02:49:28,860 --> 02:49:29,860
I've never heard of that game.

2082
02:49:29,860 --> 02:49:54,620
p0k3smot42o

2083
02:49:54,620 --> 02:49:58,740
that's fun I will post a link to the official

2084
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:03,980
website here I don't remember this game at all is it a Japanese game or is this

2085
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:07,580
oh no looks like an English game it just I was released for like fifteen bucks at

2086
02:50:07,580 --> 02:50:08,380
fries or

2087
02:50:08,380 --> 02:50:12,140
really? something like that and then sold out and it's like really cool and everything

2088
02:50:12,140 --> 02:50:16,740
huh I've never played it though how have I never heard of this game?

2089
02:50:16,740 --> 02:50:20,860
weird that's kinda

2090
02:50:20,860 --> 02:50:21,860
Well, it's Namco.

2091
02:50:21,860 --> 02:50:22,860
Yeah, it is.

2092
02:50:22,860 --> 02:50:24,860
Dude, anything by Namco is good.

2093
02:50:24,860 --> 02:50:25,860
That's weird.

2094
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:26,860
Namco, back in the day...

2095
02:50:26,860 --> 02:50:28,220
Why have I, like, never...

2096
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:29,580
I guess I'm just out of it.

2097
02:50:29,580 --> 02:50:31,700
I'm not cool anymore is basically what it boils down to.

2098
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:32,700
Look at that!

2099
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:33,700
A giant ball of shit.

2100
02:50:33,700 --> 02:50:34,700
Look at that.

2101
02:50:34,700 --> 02:50:35,700
Wow.

2102
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:38,540
I would kill for a giant ball of shit.

2103
02:50:38,540 --> 02:50:39,540
Let's get to more questions.

2104
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:40,540
I just would.

2105
02:50:40,540 --> 02:50:41,540
I'd hit my left foot.

2106
02:50:41,540 --> 02:50:42,540
Not shit, but stuff.

2107
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:43,540
Stuff, yeah.

2108
02:50:43,540 --> 02:50:44,880
It's a giant ball of stuff.

2109
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:47,860
You wouldn't really want a ball of shit rolling over you.

2110
02:50:47,860 --> 02:50:49,860
Yeah, it would kinda suck.

2111
02:50:49,860 --> 02:50:54,260
everything must be they're calling it a sleeper hit it's a budget sleeper hit

2112
02:50:54,260 --> 02:51:00,340
oh kind of like when incredible crisis was brack 2000 has a question and I

2113
02:51:00,340 --> 02:51:04,860
don't know if I want to ask his question to be honest but I guess I will cuz I

2114
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:09,580
you know I do that brack 2000 wants to know where's the ferret at it's on the

2115
02:51:09,580 --> 02:51:17,380
floor where should be need to stay there in the fireplace where he belongs I have

2116
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:19,380
I have a fireplace in my place.

2117
02:51:20,380 --> 02:51:22,380
Listen to the retarded love.

2118
02:51:22,380 --> 02:51:24,380
Angel has a question to all the hosts.

2119
02:51:24,380 --> 02:51:26,380
Want me to make new promos?

2120
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:28,380
Hey, we'll take donations.

2121
02:51:28,380 --> 02:51:31,380
What are we gonna say? No, don't give us free stuff.

2122
02:51:31,380 --> 02:51:34,380
Don't do work for us. Please don't.

2123
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:36,380
Of course we want people to make money.

2124
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:38,380
Uh, Jamie. Question for Jamie.

2125
02:51:38,380 --> 02:51:40,380
Shut that damn thing up.

2126
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:43,380
What do you think the best way to get my stamina up for DDR

2127
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:46,380
besides playing DDR itself? I want options.

2128
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:54,940
Is this Angel? Yeah. Um, start walking. Yeah, walking. Start walking. Do things that get your heart

2129
02:51:54,940 --> 02:52:02,300
going. Um, the whole thing is that DDR is cardio and no matter how, you know, good you get your

2130
02:52:02,300 --> 02:52:07,740
legs in shape, if you're breathing, if your lungs can't keep up with it, you know, you should go to

2131
02:52:07,740 --> 02:52:12,940
spin with me, Angel. Get a membership at my gym and go to spin with me. That'll get your cardio

2132
02:52:12,940 --> 02:52:16,420
built up. Yeah, I'm still debating getting a membership of that gym too. I guarantee

2133
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:21,960
you, but um, I want to be buff. If you can, if you can get to the track on Mondays

2134
02:52:21,960 --> 02:52:25,720
and Wednesdays at seven o'clock, and actually I wanted to bring this up

2135
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:31,300
anyway, for anyone in the area who wants to work, work out, get in better shape,

2136
02:52:31,300 --> 02:52:36,140
Anita, DD Archaholic and I are working on getting ready for the mud run at

2137
02:52:36,140 --> 02:52:40,360
Mater Field next year, which is they have a five mile and a two mile obstacle

2138
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:45,260
horse and there is no way in hell I can run two miles okay I can barely run a

2139
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:50,680
quarter of the track but we're working on getting in shape to do the mud run

2140
02:52:50,680 --> 02:52:54,880
next year and if you want to come work out with us you're welcome to do it and

2141
02:52:54,880 --> 02:52:59,100
that would help build up your stamina because we're we're doing run walks on

2142
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:04,420
the track and running the stairs and doing sit-ups and push-ups and all kinds

2143
02:53:04,420 --> 02:53:08,540
the stuff. You're starting a fitness club?

2144
02:53:08,540 --> 02:53:13,060
Yeah, kinda. We were talking about doing the, doing something like

2145
02:53:13,060 --> 02:53:16,340
orange lounge fitness. That's cute. We really were thinking about that.

2146
02:53:16,340 --> 02:53:21,620
Meanwhile, I'm on the DDR diet. Rule number one

2147
02:53:21,620 --> 02:53:25,300
of run club. No one talks about run club!

2148
02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:31,580
Sorry. Moving on with Angel's question, there's also a question for Loki here. Is

2149
02:53:31,580 --> 02:53:32,940
your new remix done?

2150
02:53:32,940 --> 02:53:34,940
I didn't even know he was working on a new remix.

2151
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:39,940
Yeah, well, okay. What's the status of Loki remixes? Anything on the plate?

2152
02:53:39,940 --> 02:53:41,940
I'll reword her question.

2153
02:53:41,940 --> 02:53:46,940
I thought that was planned. There was stuff being done. This is news to me.

2154
02:53:46,940 --> 02:53:52,940
Maybe she was asking, like I was thinking, have we renamed your last remix yet?

2155
02:53:52,940 --> 02:53:55,940
Oh, yeah, I went with my name.

2156
02:53:55,940 --> 02:53:57,940
Which was?

2157
02:53:57,940 --> 02:53:59,940
What did I name that?

2158
02:53:59,940 --> 02:54:19,940
Rob, am I allowed to use the controller when playing Ultra Mix against you because my converter is being buggy? Yeah, it's fine. You can play controller against me. But, here's the thing. Don't fucking go picking like, can't stop falling in love speed mix, followed by paranoid rebirth and then eternal, and then fucking like every nine footer in the game back to back.

2159
02:54:19,940 --> 02:54:23,540
here's the thing don't fucking go picking like can't stop falling in love

2160
02:54:23,540 --> 02:54:27,460
speed mix followed by paranoid rebirth and then eternal

2161
02:54:27,460 --> 02:54:30,420
and then fucking like every nine footer in the game back to back because

2162
02:54:30,420 --> 02:54:33,860
remember i'm on a dance pad you're gonna be playing fucking

2163
02:54:33,860 --> 02:54:38,020
santa maletti light no i'm kidding but you know just within reason as long as

2164
02:54:38,020 --> 02:54:39,780
the songs are within reason i don't really care

2165
02:54:39,780 --> 02:54:43,060
as long as we're just playing half by if i'm playing against somebody for fun

2166
02:54:43,060 --> 02:54:45,860
then yeah we can you know use whatever you want maybe i'll play on the

2167
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:48,020
controller let's just keep playing against each

2168
02:54:48,020 --> 02:54:50,540
other on the controller like a bunch and then rack up a bunch of points that

2169
02:54:50,540 --> 02:54:54,500
would actually be fun. I actually have an idea how we're gonna get ourselves in

2170
02:54:54,500 --> 02:55:00,940
the top hundred. Ah damn. No I don't want to cheat anyway. I want to do it honestly.

2171
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:07,180
We'll do it honestly. Hee hee hee. L Mullet says if any of you had to pick an old

2172
02:55:07,180 --> 02:55:12,300
school video game characters your favorite of all time, who would you pick?

2173
02:55:12,300 --> 02:55:21,300
Or what? Your favorite old-school video game character is your favorite of all time.

2174
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:29,300
The chick from The Guardian Legend. Actually, Richter Belmont from Dracula X.

2175
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:38,300
Just because he walks around with his Ryu haircut and his headband with a whip being all badass vampire hunter. That's kind of cool.

2176
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:47,540
cool. That's kind of hot. Um, I would have to say either the Dark Queen from Battletoads

2177
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:58,620
or Chun-Li. Super Joe. Super Joe. Bionic Commando. Dude, that's cool. Because you blow up Hitler

2178
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:08,240
at the end of that game, only it's not Hitler. Or, um, like, a random Mega Man 2 boss, because

2179
02:56:08,240 --> 02:56:14,400
the Mega Man bosses are cool. You would so be, uh, Quick Man. There is no Rainbow Man,

2180
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:22,020
go to hell. Alright, uh, Misty. I wanna know what the hell happened to Episode 111, did

2181
02:56:22,020 --> 02:56:27,260
you delete it or something? I've been looking forward to hearing it on Rewind Pout. No,

2182
02:56:27,260 --> 02:56:29,060
That's 1-12 that never got recorded.

2183
02:56:29,060 --> 02:56:36,660
Actually 1-12 is gone, but there was a small mistake that happened this week where something

2184
02:56:36,660 --> 02:56:41,060
got updated and didn't get saved, which caused you to hear the same episode for the third

2185
02:56:41,060 --> 02:56:42,060
week in a row.

2186
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:43,940
And I apologize for that.

2187
02:56:43,940 --> 02:56:44,940
But you know what?

2188
02:56:44,940 --> 02:56:46,940
We have a suggestion for you in the chatroom.

2189
02:56:46,940 --> 02:56:47,940
What?

2190
02:56:47,940 --> 02:56:48,940
God damn.

2191
02:56:48,940 --> 02:56:54,820
Ride2000 said you should be hard man.

2192
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:55,820
Every day.

2193
02:56:55,820 --> 02:57:02,820
no episode 111 exist and in fact to prove it I will play a random moment

2194
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:06,940
from episode 111 here's a random moment from episode 111

2195
02:57:06,940 --> 02:57:11,940
I'll bash bin Laden. God damn Bush family for giving bin Laden by

2196
02:57:11,940 --> 02:57:16,220
President Bush to be killed his entire family if it wasn't for them Osama wouldn't live

2197
02:57:16,220 --> 02:57:19,100
Wow wonderful a dark child moment just what I wanted

2198
02:57:19,100 --> 02:57:22,620
that had nothing to do with video games at all

2199
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:27,060
What the hell is wrong with our show?

2200
02:57:27,060 --> 02:57:33,720
We need the random episode clip button, just like Conan has the random clips of walker

2201
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:35,120
texas ranger.

2202
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:40,800
We need to have, we need to do that, I think that would be awesome.

2203
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:45,260
I'm not going through old episodes, alright fine, here's another random clip of episode

2204
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:46,260
111.

2205
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:52,080
other stuff I was kind of surprised one vote over echo image and one vote oh or

2206
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:56,940
I'm sorry two votes over DMS sure it was a very what the hell was I know what the

2207
02:57:56,940 --> 02:58:01,220
hell was I talking about to noon Thursday to find out and we know it's a

2208
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:13,620
cage mansion all right so the episode exists I just suck all right and that's

2209
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:16,300
That's it, that's all the questions we got, and that's fine because it's time to wrap

2210
02:58:16,300 --> 02:58:17,300
up the show.

2211
02:58:17,300 --> 02:58:24,820
So we're gonna close the old, uh, Orange Lounge radio mail bag.

2212
02:58:24,820 --> 02:58:25,820
And that was us closing the bag.

2213
02:58:25,820 --> 02:58:27,220
Oh, did we ever check the email?

2214
02:58:27,220 --> 02:58:28,820
The old school Yahoo email?

2215
02:58:28,820 --> 02:58:40,540
Uh, I check it, I check it once in a great while, but I'll open it up right now.

2216
02:58:40,540 --> 02:58:42,380
Like an F-you for something Loki said.

2217
02:58:42,380 --> 02:58:46,060
uh... let's see what messages we got we said uh... good news weight loss

2218
02:58:46,060 --> 02:58:48,600
fourteen-percent reduction of fat

2219
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:49,500
bigger cock

2220
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:53,700
uh... something makes me cry when i am moved

2221
02:58:53,700 --> 02:58:57,820
and uh... another one of his happy face my sister used to tell me life is full

2222
02:58:57,820 --> 02:58:59,060
of happiness

2223
02:58:59,060 --> 02:59:00,500
uh...

2224
02:59:00,500 --> 02:59:02,780
nothing in the god damn you know

2225
02:59:02,780 --> 02:59:05,020
you didn't even get a penis enlargement now?

2226
02:59:05,020 --> 02:59:08,980
i want to know if something makes me cry when i moved

2227
02:59:08,980 --> 02:59:11,840
an answer worthy of your acceptance

2228
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:15,220
I guess it's a...

2229
02:59:15,220 --> 02:59:18,860
Look at this! They have to put all these dashes in here and stuff so the spam filters

2230
02:59:18,860 --> 02:59:19,420
don't get it.

2231
02:59:19,420 --> 02:59:23,220
Why do you people bother? That's what I want to know.

2232
02:59:23,220 --> 02:59:27,300
Of course, since I clicked it, they'll probably send me a million emails now.

2233
02:59:27,300 --> 02:59:30,340
I was reading some web comic, Rob.

2234
02:59:30,340 --> 02:59:33,400
I don't remember which one it was, the someone accepting spam mail because they

2235
02:59:33,400 --> 02:59:35,460
hate the world

2236
02:59:35,460 --> 02:59:38,300
and want more to come.

2237
02:59:38,300 --> 02:59:41,460
That was completely random.

2238
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:42,740
I'm gonna go check my laundry.

2239
02:59:42,740 --> 02:59:46,140
Alright, sounds good actually. Well, we're gonna wrap up the show. Come back, come back, come back.

2240
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:50,340
Because you have to give us your final thought.

2241
02:59:50,340 --> 02:59:52,640
Do it. Final thought.

2242
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:56,660
But you can't hear my thoughts.

2243
02:59:56,660 --> 02:59:58,980
None of you are psycho and have ESPN.

2244
02:59:58,980 --> 03:00:04,380
Then just tell them to tune in Tuesday since we didn't do the vlogs. Yes, I do a radio show on Tuesday.

2245
03:00:04,380 --> 03:00:05,860
I never do that.

2246
03:00:05,860 --> 03:00:10,900
Rob. Rob. What? Rob. What? Rob. What? Rob.

2247
03:00:10,900 --> 03:00:22,300
I do pump up the volume on Tuesday night if you tune in at 7 o'clock, sometimes a little

2248
03:00:22,300 --> 03:00:24,740
bit earlier.

2249
03:00:24,740 --> 03:00:28,060
You can listen to the pre-show, 7.30 starts the real show.

2250
03:00:28,060 --> 03:00:32,520
It's supposed to be a request show, but that doesn't really happen all that much anymore.

2251
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:34,380
People sometimes make requests.

2252
03:00:34,380 --> 03:00:39,020
So I said I'd choose to marathon things, and the marathon for this week will be Rammstein.

2253
03:00:39,020 --> 03:00:45,640
And then I'm probably going to throw in old video game music because I feel like it.

2254
03:00:45,640 --> 03:00:46,640
So tune in.

2255
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:51,200
If I get bored again like I did last week, I'll go until midnight because I played Eddie

2256
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:54,400
Izzard and a bunch of other stuff afterwards.

2257
03:00:54,400 --> 03:01:01,600
No, last week actually was the 80s marathon, which I actually do those every couple months.

2258
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:03,680
Be thinking of what you want to listen to though.

2259
03:01:03,680 --> 03:01:05,160
I'll play whatever.

2260
03:01:05,160 --> 03:01:14,160
If you are part of our LiveJournal community, the Orange Lounge LiveJournal, you can also put in there things that you'd like to hear on the show.

2261
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:20,160
Alright. Let's see. Loki, your final thought.

2262
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:27,160
My final thought was, I was thinking of weird things to make remixes of earlier today.

2263
03:01:27,160 --> 03:01:34,160
One of the things I downloaded, which I gotta mess around with because I think it'd be funny, is to make a dance remix of the Shaft theme.

2264
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:38,000
Dude, that'd be... I don't know if that would work, but it's just something to play with.

2265
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:42,840
I was just downloading random white label remixes and stuff, and that was just kind of fun.

2266
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:46,720
Just because I was waiting for my, um, Simple Minds

2267
03:01:46,720 --> 03:01:51,080
Don't You Forget About Me remixes to download.

2268
03:01:51,080 --> 03:01:54,880
Do you ever use your record player anymore?

2269
03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:59,080
No, but oddly enough I still buy records. I got you a record. I got you...

2270
03:01:59,080 --> 03:02:02,080
What was that group? Guitar... Wolf.

2271
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:06,000
guitar wolf yeah I have a bunch of records I need to go through my big

2272
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:11,160
pile of mid 90s R&B and I need to figure out what I want to keep and what I want

2273
03:02:11,160 --> 03:02:14,440
to get rid of because I'm trying to like take that big pile I have it just

2274
03:02:14,440 --> 03:02:18,560
sitting there probably getting warped because you know I have stuff on top of

2275
03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:23,460
the records and I need to like throw a ton of shit away I have one record now

2276
03:02:23,460 --> 03:02:27,680
one left all my other ones are in Alabama but I Dan and I actually bought

2277
03:02:27,680 --> 03:02:33,600
weirdos even worse on vinyl well I need to like just because there's a lot of

2278
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:36,920
records out there I need to figure out how to mix on vinyl and once I do that

2279
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:41,240
then I'll be before it probably more opted to play with the records and stuff

2280
03:02:41,240 --> 03:02:45,120
it's just it's hard because I don't know my record selection very well that's why

2281
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:49,940
I need to like lower it so I you know I can you know know what songs mix well

2282
03:02:49,940 --> 03:02:54,240
together I'll make you a database it's just it's hard I don't even know how I

2283
03:02:54,240 --> 03:03:14,240
I just need to learn how to mix. That's pretty much what I need to do. I can do parties where you just crossfade shit over. That's a piece of cake. But it's a matter of being an actual true DJ and being able to beat match and stuff and mix that way. That's a little different than being a wedding DJ where you just play 80s shit and crossfade over.

2284
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:19,240
Oh my god, this is the sequel to the wedding singers, the wedding DJ.

2285
03:03:19,240 --> 03:03:24,240
Like, seriously, I could DJ, like, really shitty, like, adult parties and stuff, you know?

2286
03:03:24,240 --> 03:03:30,240
But, like, you know, I can't really, you know, actually be able to do, you know, cool professional DJ stuff.

2287
03:03:30,240 --> 03:03:33,240
Like, and mix shit together.

2288
03:03:33,240 --> 03:03:36,240
Right now I have a program that helps me with that, you know?

2289
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:42,240
Because I can do it visually, but I can't do it audio. So, that's a problem.

2290
03:03:42,240 --> 03:03:44,240
Anyways.

2291
03:03:44,240 --> 03:03:46,240
That's my final thought.

2292
03:03:46,240 --> 03:03:48,240
Bradley, you have a final thought?

2293
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:54,240
Since I don't have very much to say, I'll just read random words from the posters on the wall.

2294
03:03:54,240 --> 03:03:57,240
Redundant, nicer, yummy, pin-up, action.

2295
03:03:57,240 --> 03:04:03,240
Very nice. And my final thought is, I'm trying to keep this short because I have somewhere else to be right now.

2296
03:04:03,240 --> 03:04:07,240
So, thank you very much for listening, everybody. Have a great night. Final word of the show.

2297
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:09,240
Jamie, you always want it, so there you go.

2298
03:04:09,240 --> 03:04:13,240
My final word of the show is Vodka.

2299
03:04:13,240 --> 03:04:19,240
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2300
03:04:19,240 --> 03:04:24,240

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2303
03:05:02,240 --> 03:05:10,240
Do we ever do to these guys That made them so vile of you?

2304
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:22,240
Ooh, but you know I'm yours Ooh, and I know you're mine

2305
03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:50,240
I don't care what they say about us anyway, I don't care about us anymore.

2306
03:05:50,240 --> 03:05:58,240
I don't care about that.

2307
03:05:58,240 --> 03:06:17,240
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2308
03:06:28,240 --> 03:06:56,640
Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, in progress.

2309
03:06:56,640 --> 03:07:01,640
I'm trying to queue up a post-show, so I'm gonna give the mic to Loki and give him the responsibility of filling up a post-show.

2310
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:05,640
Filling up a post-show? God dammit.

2311
03:07:07,640 --> 03:07:09,640
Well, shit.

2312
03:07:10,640 --> 03:07:14,640
Well, what I've been doing lately is I've been downloading some music.

2313
03:07:15,640 --> 03:07:18,640
I did buy stuff. I bought music.

2314
03:07:19,640 --> 03:07:23,640
Anyways, this is one of the songs that I bought the other day.

2315
03:07:23,640 --> 03:07:33,640
Um, which is from BT. So we're just gonna kill time by playing a BT song because it'll be fun, and everybody loves BT. BT rocks.

2316
03:07:33,640 --> 03:07:40,640
And um, so this one right here will be a possible cage match winner, um, a little later.

2317
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:47,640
But anyways, this is right here, Loving You More, the seven inch edit. For those who don't know that's just like short radio edits.

2318
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:58,640
But here's Lovin' You More, BT starring Vincent, uh, Vincent, uh, Covello. Enjoy! A little bit different from BT.

2319
03:07:58,640 --> 03:08:02,640
Oh, actually, no, screw that. We're not playing that one. No. Better.

2320
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:10,640
We're gonna do the Crystal Method, Keep Hope Alive, BT's Create A Tin Method mix, and we're gonna play a little bit of that because that's seven minutes long and we don't need to play the whole thing.

2321
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:12,640
So...

2322
03:09:10,640 --> 03:09:13,640
Going home, going home

2323
03:10:10,640 --> 03:10:38,640
Let us stop the dead men's hope Let us stop the dead men's hope

2324
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:38,120
and that was fun yes it was I have kind of a special treat for you guys tonight

2325
03:11:38,120 --> 03:11:42,280
for some real post show music we're actually me doing a whole bunch of music

2326
03:11:42,280 --> 03:11:49,760

2327
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:53,240
because everybody loves my taste of music no but there's a lot of fun stuff

2328

2334
03:12:17,320 --> 03:12:24,040

2335
