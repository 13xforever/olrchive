03:41.900 --> 03:42.900

Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

03:47.980 --> 03:48.980
farm.

03:48.980 --> 03:51.980
Say hello to Ms. Jamie Summers, you know her better, Stark's background.

03:51.980 --> 03:57.980
You know what? When you were trying to think of a description, you don't want to know the things that just went through my head.

03:57.980 --> 03:59.980
What went through your head? I want to know.

03:59.980 --> 04:01.980
You know what went through my head?

04:01.980 --> 04:05.980
Nerves, blood, brain matter, that went through my head.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.980
Oh my!

04:07.980 --> 04:13.980
And in that corner, futzing with our webcam or something, our tech master, Loki.

04:13.980 --> 04:19.040
I am busting as you call it with the webcam.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.720
We actually have an extra special treat for our listeners tonight.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.120
We have a brand new web cam angle just for tonight because it's only the three of us

04:26.120 --> 04:27.960
so there's no guests to focus on.

04:27.960 --> 04:34.760
So you get to see Loki and me this time on the web cam the whole show and our really

04:34.760 --> 04:40.160
dirty work area which I'm almost embarrassed to have on the cam but I don't care.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.160
Let the world know.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.160

05:09.720 --> 05:13.880

06:10.360 --> 06:14.640

06:53.560 --> 06:57.040
assuming this role as the chat room liaison I know she kind of likes to sit

06:57.040 --> 06:59.880
there with a keyboard in her lap the whole time ever since Loki got that

06:59.880 --> 07:00.880
wireless keyboard.

07:00.880 --> 07:01.880
Dude, this thing is awesome.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.880
Okay.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.880
I just can be the babysitter all night.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.380
That's so cool.

07:06.380 --> 07:09.520
So come be, come be disciplined by Dark Sakura in our channel.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.400
You know you want it.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.160
It's just like you said in the very first episode of Orange on the Radio, I'll never

07:16.160 --> 07:22.600
forget this, is that you were ranting about parents at Golfland and you said, I remember

07:22.600 --> 07:26.640
the quote, you said something like, if you're not going to do your job, god damn it, I will.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.640
The parents don't want me to do their job.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.640
I would be a scary mom.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.640
Alright.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.640
Also, we've got the new Ultra Mix 2 song.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.640
We'll play that for you at some point tonight.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.640
And it's a previous Cage Match winner.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.640
I believe it was picked by Dark Sakura.

07:42.640 --> 07:43.640
Huh?

07:43.640 --> 07:45.640
Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.080
all right we'll be back

08:15.640 --> 08:17.640
The mic will sing soon as I touch it

08:17.640 --> 08:19.140
Dude, it's smooth and easy like

08:19.140 --> 08:21.140
So we might get hyped to hear tonight

08:21.140 --> 08:23.140
Be nice, relax, and see from the back

08:23.140 --> 08:25.640
If you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap

08:25.640 --> 08:27.640
That can smack this mouth whoops if they jack

08:27.640 --> 08:29.140
You're gonna suck no crap

08:29.140 --> 08:31.140
Giving a little bit of heart and soul as we do it

08:31.140 --> 08:33.140
Till you in your ear hole, huh

08:33.140 --> 08:35.140
I ain't going out like a sucker

08:35.140 --> 08:37.140
And if you think so, poison pucker up

08:37.140 --> 08:38.640
And chip the butter that's lyricist

08:38.640 --> 08:40.140
Blow the mic word up this groove

08:40.140 --> 08:41.640
That can soothe you

08:41.640 --> 08:43.640
Now it's time to do it!

10:11.640 --> 10:13.640
Every woman, every man

10:41.640 --> 10:48.640
We can jam, we can jam, we can jam now

11:11.640 --> 11:18.640
Don't try to stop me, don't wait up and go Don't block me, don't block me, don't try

11:18.640 --> 11:23.640
to stop me Don't wait up and go, don't block me

11:23.640 --> 11:28.640
Carving like a nutcracker crushes a nut This is the vibe before my rifle when I'm

11:28.640 --> 11:30.640
on the cut I'm sitting in your memory like a date of

11:30.640 --> 11:32.640
your birth Back then you're like Gatorade when I'm

11:32.640 --> 11:34.640
quitching my girls I'm the back of the ladder and you're the

11:34.640 --> 11:36.640
fable I'll cut you like my DJ cuts a record on the

11:36.640 --> 11:38.640
table I wanna rock you, I wanna rock you

11:38.640 --> 11:40.780
I'll cut you like my DJ cuts a record on the table

11:40.780 --> 11:42.160
I wanna rock, get off the battleground

11:42.160 --> 11:44.200
You're no Max but a God if I could beat you down

11:44.200 --> 11:46.160
Crack a soul, I put you in a muggle

11:46.160 --> 11:48.260
I'll break it in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle

11:48.260 --> 11:49.880
I'll rip your rhymes then I'll murder your style

11:49.880 --> 11:51.960
I'm the one doing the slam, yeah, your artyle

11:51.960 --> 11:53.840
I'm confessing, arranging, putting it all in place

11:53.840 --> 11:55.760
Form a line, suck a... so you can bleed your cake

11:55.760 --> 11:56.780

11:59.600 --> 12:01.760
Don't kick, don't rock me

12:01.760 --> 12:03.740
Don't try to stop me

12:03.740 --> 12:06.040
Don't wait up, baby, yo

12:06.040 --> 12:08.040
Don't clock me to beat

12:08.040 --> 12:37.800
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on the air.

12:37.800 --> 12:44.800
And, uh, whatever happened to Step Squad? I haven't heard you talk about them in a while, Jamie.

12:44.800 --> 12:50.800
I haven't heard, hardly heard from anybody lately. It's just, I, you know, I've been so busy that it's hard to keep up with anyone.

12:50.800 --> 12:57.800
You have to explain what Step Squad, because we have a lot of new people that only started listening a couple months ago and we started giving, you know, exclusive hints and stuff.

12:57.800 --> 13:02.800
Now people start listening to us, so explain for those that don't know what Step Squad is all about.

13:02.800 --> 13:12.800
StepSquad was established to sort of combat some of the, I guess, more negative aspects of the whole DDR team business that was going on.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.800
Especially just people who were...

13:14.800 --> 13:15.800
Owned Stu!

13:15.800 --> 13:17.800
Owned Stu more!

13:17.800 --> 13:19.800
I pwn you.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.800
Pwned!

13:21.800 --> 13:24.800
That sounds so stupid.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.800
Anyway, um...

13:26.800 --> 13:28.800
Did I put it back on Bradley?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.800
He said no.

13:30.800 --> 13:40.800
It was more or less just an attempt to show some of the more positive aspects or group of people who would, I guess, embody those type of...

13:40.800 --> 13:42.800
What the hell are you doing?

13:42.800 --> 13:44.800
God.

13:44.800 --> 13:52.800
Anyway, it was supposed to be more or less the whole positive aspect of what a DDR community could be like.

13:52.800 --> 13:58.960
Anyway, um, I haven't hardly, though, heard from anybody, because we're all busy, busy

13:58.960 --> 14:07.560
people, and I'm going to school, and having no life, and, okay, that cover is scaring

14:07.560 --> 14:08.560
me.

14:08.560 --> 14:16.520
That's, okay, everybody needs to go onto orangeongeradio.com and look at the webcam, because-

14:16.520 --> 14:19.320
I can't see it, it's dark.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.320
I said it's dark.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.320
Stupid cam.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.320
Stupid eye toy.

14:22.320 --> 14:27.660
it's fucking uploading fine it's just something on the website and that's all

14:27.660 --> 14:32.880
dark it's the ghost of orange lounge radio it's that portal to hell God it's

14:32.880 --> 14:36.480
not the portal to hell the things not fucking done the coils are right here

14:36.480 --> 14:43.080
not doing you summon the evil energy and it's possess the website I haven't

14:43.080 --> 14:46.800
finished the damn thing yet it's all of the energy that you're putting into it

14:46.800 --> 14:51.480
while you're making it yours what the hell's wrong my computer on your monitor

14:51.480 --> 14:53.980
My god damn monitor sucks.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.480
Yes it does.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.980
I know.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.480
Hey, I can't go up any higher.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.480
Uh, how to fix that?

15:01.480 --> 15:02.480
You need to get a new monitor.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.480
I don't need to get a new monitor, I just need to turn the gamma up.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.980
Degas it.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.980
Oh, fine, I'll do it anyways.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.480
That's fun.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.980
Okay.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.480
You were talking?

15:14.480 --> 15:17.480
I- I know I was paying attention, so I just stopped.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.020
It was about Step Squad and how cool we are.

15:21.020 --> 15:25.220
Give me the damn mic.

15:25.220 --> 15:29.380
Damn, he's like hoarding the mic over here. I'm not gonna let Rob have it. We can't have a show tonight.

15:29.380 --> 15:32.980
No, Rob, you don't get to talk. Alright.

15:32.980 --> 15:36.940
We're gonna get duct tape for you. Yeah. Anyway, I have to tease

15:36.940 --> 15:40.420
something. I'm gonna tease something. We have a sequel

15:40.420 --> 15:43.980
to a classic Orange Lounge Radio inside joke coming up.

15:43.980 --> 15:49.260
a sequel. We are all about the inside jokes. Yes, remember, sequels, they always have a bigger

15:49.260 --> 15:49.900
budget

15:49.900 --> 15:53.700
and they're always much better. Just kidding, they're actually always a lot worse.

15:53.700 --> 15:57.300
The third one usually ends up better. Yeah. Well, we do have the sequel

15:57.300 --> 16:01.500
in a minute. After, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, of course, the way we start off

16:01.500 --> 16:04.900
all episodes of Warren's Laundrio. Dark Sakura, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

16:04.900 --> 16:08.020
My week consisted of work and school

16:08.020 --> 16:11.380
because, guess what, I have no life.

16:11.380 --> 16:17.380
All I do is go to work and all I do is go to school and go to the track and go to the gym.

16:17.380 --> 16:26.380
I went to spin and I was so happy because I was so pissed off and mad at the world on Friday that I went to spin and had a fun time.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.380
Worked out all that aggression.

16:28.380 --> 16:33.380
But nothing really major happened this week.

16:33.380 --> 16:39.380
I'm getting Sims 2, which is going to make me happy and I'll have even less free time.

16:39.380 --> 16:50.460
I'm also training somebody at work and I've got a few actually a few more

16:50.460 --> 16:59.740
changes in mind in my chosen field. Different things at work going on. I'm not

16:59.740 --> 17:02.860
really going to go into too much detail about it but there there may be some

17:02.860 --> 17:08.740
changes a foot the next couple of months all right I went to a party last night

17:08.740 --> 17:14.420
you know me I'm such the party girl who but I ended up because I was just gonna

17:14.420 --> 17:21.180
go hang out and do whatever was the occasion random just random party it was

17:21.180 --> 17:26.060
like oh my god we're bored let's have a party all right it works but I had I was

17:26.060 --> 17:32.740
over at an iguana girls house and oh my god moo is female we didn't know what

17:32.740 --> 17:36.980
gender moo was because iguanas take a year oh I was like who the hell's moo

17:36.980 --> 17:42.540
moo is her iguana okay but moo is now in the big cage and moo is very happy and cute and

17:42.540 --> 17:48.100
female okay which is going to be fun when she starts laying eggs because they

17:48.100 --> 17:55.100
lay eggs like chickens anyway I decided that because everybody was having to oh

17:55.100 --> 17:58.980
my god that was so creepy what the webcam he had it pointed down the hall

17:58.980 --> 18:06.140
it turned red it made me think of Silent Hill 4. That's what I was saying. I just decided

18:06.140 --> 18:17.900
that I was going to participate and you know not be a pooper so I had 12 jello shots. Remember

18:17.900 --> 18:24.020
kids Orange Lawn's radio wants you to drink responsibly. I didn't drive. I called Dan

18:24.020 --> 18:28.040
and... Oh well you didn't. See that's the classic double standard I love about this

18:28.040 --> 18:32.360
culture it's always you know be sure that if you drive you drink responsibly

18:32.360 --> 18:36.960
now if you didn't drive get fucked up nobody cares you just get fucked up it's

18:36.960 --> 18:42.960
your liver once you got your keys in the bowl you can get fucked up my keys are

18:42.960 --> 18:48.320
in my purse I knew better but I ended up having 12 jello shots because it was all

18:48.320 --> 18:55.360
low carb stuff so vodka is low carb so I had we had it with the sugar-free jello

18:55.360 --> 19:01.620
so I had 12 of them. Because I have this thing for vodka, I don't feel it until after I'm

19:01.620 --> 19:09.900
done with it. Um, I also had a couple glasses of this cranberry vodka beverage, and then

19:09.900 --> 19:18.820
this cranberry and orange liqueur beverage, and something else, and lots of meat. I was

19:18.820 --> 19:27.860
in happy boos meet heaven what that is so like a quintessential quote for you

19:27.860 --> 19:35.820
now I was in happy boos meet heaven okay please somebody note the date and time

19:35.820 --> 19:42.780
thank you we have our archivists in the chat room thank you our archivist is in

19:42.780 --> 19:45.380
the chat room so she will let her handle yeah could you write that down for the

19:45.380 --> 19:53.080
next intro thank you anyway I also put some more thought into my I'm actually

19:53.080 --> 19:57.500
one of my classes I finished all the homework for I'm very happy another one

19:57.500 --> 20:02.300
I have one more week of assignments and I'm done with that class hallelujah

20:02.300 --> 20:06.680
praise the Lord no more databases I spent four hours freaking working on a

20:06.680 --> 20:12.580
database today it's such ease well I was also chatting with people too which I

20:12.580 --> 20:16.620
thought was more important than doing my homework but that was that was really it

20:16.620 --> 20:19.620
I'm gonna go ahead and try to get the other one done Thursday ahead of time

20:19.620 --> 20:25.140
just go ahead and get it out of the way stop putting it off although

20:25.140 --> 20:33.620
procrastination is pretty fun anyway that was my week my day oh yeah I passed

20:33.620 --> 20:38.220
out at 1130 and woke up at 630 in the morning and guess what you sound like me

20:38.220 --> 20:44.400
at a party no I I just I just decided I was randomly sleepy and I just played I

20:44.400 --> 20:49.680
just I mean I actually did consciously go to bed and then next thing I know it's

20:49.680 --> 20:55.960
six in the morning I am wide awake and not hungover see I don't think I would

20:55.960 --> 20:59.000
even drink so we should have went to church today

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
bite me

21:01.080 --> 21:02.880
Excuse me. I don't know

21:02.880 --> 21:04.880
but no, I

21:04.880 --> 21:06.880
I ended up

21:07.240 --> 21:10.280
wide awake not in the least hungover and

21:11.040 --> 21:13.040
Then I that's when I ate that chocolate

21:13.920 --> 21:18.720
it I see I don't think that I would have I think that I would not drink as

21:19.560 --> 21:21.880
Wildly as I do on the rare times that I do

21:22.720 --> 21:24.720
Because I don't have any

21:24.720 --> 21:28.720
Consequences other than my liver going, whoo, alcohol.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.720
I just don't get hungover.

21:32.720 --> 21:36.720
Coming from a long line of beer drinking.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.720
You know. Not me, I don't like beer.

21:40.720 --> 21:44.720
Oh my god, somebody else talk. I'm tired.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.720
Alright, fine. We'll move on to somebody else's weekend day.

21:48.720 --> 21:52.720
How was your week? How was your day?

21:52.720 --> 22:00.640
still a little better now my toe is kind of ugly looking and although I do think

22:00.640 --> 22:05.880
that somehow there's like an infection under my cuticle because it's still kind

22:05.880 --> 22:14.260
of poofy and a little bit of pussy and so yeah probably to do that but I mean

22:14.260 --> 22:17.120
other than that no it doesn't really hurt my other toe hurts now though

22:17.120 --> 22:20.520
because the nails kind of long on it and I just accidentally kicked into the desk

22:20.520 --> 22:43.520
And that's not fun. But no, this week I saw a ton of movies. I saw Shark's Tale, because it was free, and that was okay. And then I saw The Forgotten, which, if anyone's seen the trailer, you know what the movie's about. Literally, you know what the movie's about. You've already seen the entire story of the movie.

22:43.520 --> 23:00.520
And then I watched Ju-On, which is, for those who don't know it, the Japanese version of the movie coming out called The Grudge, and if you've seen that movie, then you've seen The Grudge already, because it's pretty much, from what I've seen in the trailers, exactly the same shots.

23:00.520 --> 23:10.520
You know what? I have to say something about that. Now, the trailer for Ringu and The Ring had all the same identical scenes, and there was a lot different about movies.

23:10.520 --> 23:18.520
Well, the only thing that's going to be different, I think, is one, it's probably going to be linear, because Ju-On was fucking hard to follow.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.520
I just kept skipping around, I was like, what the hell?

23:20.520 --> 23:21.520
That's just Japanese cinnamon.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.520
What the hell is going on here?

23:22.520 --> 23:29.520
But, um, my only complaint about it is, how can people be that dumb to walk into a haunted house, like, constantly?

23:29.520 --> 23:35.520
They're like, yeah, so we know that every single person that's gone through this house has disappeared, so I'm going to go inside that house!

23:35.520 --> 23:37.520
Save on the, uh, tax.

23:37.520 --> 23:56.520
And then at the very end of the movie they like show something that's kinda, I guess would be like a way to ward off whatever it is, and then like not even 30 seconds later another ghost comes, and the woman doesn't do the thing that ward off the first one, and then she disappears.

23:56.520 --> 24:03.440
it's like oh how can you not see that famous then I watched battlefield

24:03.440 --> 24:07.240
baseball which is fucking awesome it's like Shaolin soccer it's like Shaolin

24:07.240 --> 24:10.920
soccer with baseball but it's crazy because the one the main character

24:10.920 --> 24:15.080
doesn't play baseball anymore because he killed his father with his fast pitch it

24:15.080 --> 24:19.080
was so fast they went through him and killed him and then they sung a song

24:19.080 --> 24:25.200
about it that was the best thing the best thing ever but it's great though

24:25.200 --> 24:30.040
because there's like people that are getting impaled on shit and just like

24:30.040 --> 24:33.140
there's like this whole team that looked like they're full of zombies or whatever

24:33.140 --> 24:36.160
but they're not they're just these really weird people and this guy that

24:36.160 --> 24:41.240
looks like the mask with or he looks like an Australian version of the mask

24:41.240 --> 24:45.580
he's on the other team was like the head coach and there's this I mean all these

24:45.580 --> 24:49.200
people keep getting killed oh there's this one guy keeps getting killed

24:49.200 --> 24:53.080
throughout the movie and every time he comes back as a different person with

24:53.080 --> 25:00.360
the same haircut it's just quite weird but um so that was a cool movie and then

25:00.360 --> 25:07.480
other than that I got um I played my Final Fantasy and I bought some new CDs

25:07.480 --> 25:15.440
I bought Stephen Lynch's CD and he's funny and then BT 10 years in the was

25:15.440 --> 25:23.360
it was like 10 years, oh 10 years in the life and that was like a compilation of

25:23.360 --> 25:27.740
his best works plus some new stuff I haven't heard of BT and remixes they did

25:27.740 --> 25:34.760
including crystal method remix they did and that was kind of cool and other than

25:34.760 --> 25:41.200
that really not all that much went on just a little bit movies and hobbling

25:41.200 --> 25:46.960
and still didn't finish the device working on it oh I got Sims 2 and I was

25:46.960 --> 25:53.200
torturing Sims that was fun the only thing about that game though is that it

25:53.200 --> 25:57.520
has really slow fires like I started a fire in my kitchen it took it about two

25:57.520 --> 26:02.560
days to finally get across the kitchen because you know it's cool because you

26:02.560 --> 26:05.120
know the fire department can't come even though I have smoke detectors because I

26:05.120 --> 26:10.840
have a motor on my house and there's no way in or out but if you're interested

26:10.840 --> 26:17.800
what I thought about The Sims 2, you can check out my review on OrangeZoundsRadio.com, which

26:17.800 --> 26:23.240
we have reviews for other games on there too. Yeah, actually Jason and I are talking about

26:23.240 --> 26:27.120
plans to try and expand the review section a little later too, because I want to do a

26:27.120 --> 26:31.640
full review of DDR Extreme, although I am going to have a mini review of DDR Extreme

26:31.640 --> 26:36.200
showing up in the very near future somewhere else, so maybe we'll talk about that later,

26:36.200 --> 26:38.200
I don't know.

26:38.200 --> 26:43.200
Anything else you want to share about your weekend today?

26:43.200 --> 26:44.200
I don't think so.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.200
No, that's it.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.200
Alright, Bradley, how was your week?

26:48.200 --> 26:49.200
How was your day?

26:49.200 --> 26:52.200
It was pretty boring.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.200
It worked.

26:53.200 --> 27:00.200
I finally submitted my last thing for temp work, so now I'm permanent in the company,

27:00.200 --> 27:01.200
finally.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.200
Woohoo!

27:02.200 --> 27:03.200
Yay.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.200
Clap, clap, clap.

27:04.200 --> 27:13.200
Then Wednesday I listened to the debate mostly because it was like the first time I turned on my TV to actually watch TV in like 33 months.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.200
And it was on every channel.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.200
What?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.200
And it was on every channel.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.200
Something like that.

27:17.200 --> 27:22.200
Well it was like behind me and I was listening to it while I was playing on the computer.

27:22.200 --> 27:27.200
And then after that, not much. This weekend didn't do very much.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.200
Did my state taxes, oh boy.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.200
Woohoo!

27:30.200 --> 27:34.240
because you can wait like till October if you don't owe anything

27:34.240 --> 27:37.840
and that's about it. Right on.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.120
Exciting. My week and my day.

27:41.120 --> 27:45.240
Like Jamie I was kind of a party animal this weekend. I went to a party

27:45.240 --> 27:49.160
Friday night. My friend John had a birthday so I went over to his house for a

27:49.160 --> 27:50.840
birthday party and I went with a bunch of my friends.

27:50.840 --> 27:55.000
Unfortunately I didn't really get a chance to drink a whole lot. I did like a shot or two

27:55.000 --> 27:56.080
but I didn't get quite

27:56.080 --> 27:59.560
as comfortable as Jamie did at the party she went to.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.560
But it was a good time. I met a lot of really nice new people.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.560
I met this one girl who was really into anime.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.560
She seemed like she'd be somebody who might like this show, so...

28:08.560 --> 28:11.560
Hopefully I remembered to plug the show with her, but I don't remember.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.560
Anyway, and just, you know, a lot of cool people there,

28:14.560 --> 28:17.560
and we just had a good time, laughing, hanging out.

28:17.560 --> 28:23.560
And then, yesterday, I actually decided to drive to my old hometown.

28:23.560 --> 28:27.560
I lived there for three years, where I went to school in Chico, California,

28:27.560 --> 28:31.500
north about about an hour and a half north of Sacramento where this show is

28:31.500 --> 28:35.720
based which is a little college town there really isn't anything in Chico

28:35.720 --> 28:41.980
California except a college and retired people so it's this interesting mix of

28:41.980 --> 28:45.940
people but I had I had myself a good time I never really enjoyed the place

28:45.940 --> 28:48.940
while I lived there but now that I'm just a visitor I actually have a lot of

28:48.940 --> 28:53.580
fun every time I go I went to this bar and I actually got a little drunk which

28:53.580 --> 28:56.940
wasn't a good idea since I had driven so I had to like wait around so like

28:56.940 --> 29:03.900
to 3 a.m. so I could sober up. But we went to this bar and I just danced like crazy.

29:03.900 --> 29:07.380
I don't know what it was, I was just totally dancing like crazy, like flailing my arms

29:07.380 --> 29:12.500
about and jumping. And then like, I saw this like, this guy and this girl were dancing

29:12.500 --> 29:17.060
next to me, and the girl at one point like hopped up on the guy's shoulders, and the

29:17.060 --> 29:20.680
guy was like doing all these dirty things to the girl, and then the girl started like

29:20.680 --> 29:25.020
leaning back. Like it was a really bad scene, like out of the pool scene in Showgirls.

29:25.020 --> 29:29.020
my god I was just the way you were describing that seriously that's what it looked like

29:29.020 --> 29:33.340
was the pool scene in showgirls but like on a dance floor it was something you'd see in

29:33.340 --> 29:37.180
like an 80s dance film or something I don't know but they were getting cheers and stuff

29:37.180 --> 29:40.700
we were like right next to them so it's kind of weird and you know I don't know how often

29:40.700 --> 29:45.700
you guys go to dance clubs but it is it still humors me to this day when they play like

29:45.700 --> 29:50.260
DDR music in dance clubs I don't know why that is but I find it really humorous and

29:50.260 --> 29:55.060
I remember they played Sandstorm was one song they played and I was like all

29:55.060 --> 29:58.860
dancing to that and they had played Better Off Alone which isn't a DDR song

29:58.860 --> 30:07.980
but it really should be you know yeah so I was having a good time so not that I

30:07.980 --> 30:14.620
actually dance like DDR because that really is not the point but you know

30:14.620 --> 30:19.380
it's still kind of fun and I guess that's really it I just kind of partied

30:19.380 --> 30:22.200
go out this weekend and I'm going out tonight to a club again so I'm kind of

30:22.200 --> 30:26.300
being a little but tonight I'm going back to the goth club so I cuz I had a

30:26.300 --> 30:29.640
lot of fun last time I was there so I'm going again tonight to go act all

30:29.640 --> 30:33.820
morbid and yes I'm gonna paint my nails black and look like I've done I know I'm

30:33.820 --> 30:39.220
kidding I I I'm just gonna go have fun so you should go cuz I have tomorrow off

30:39.220 --> 30:44.460
work the goth club and we're like yellow maybe I should go dress like a

30:44.460 --> 30:47.940
a cheerleader or something? No, you should get like... Actually, they probably think

30:47.940 --> 30:55.180
that was cool. I'll give you the evil cheerleader. Maybe. I don't know, it's funny. You should,

30:55.180 --> 30:59.140
you should, well, I know you don't like going to dance clubs, but if you like dance clubs,

30:59.140 --> 31:03.420
you would like this one. Maybe I'd have to go sometimes just to stand in the corner and

31:03.420 --> 31:07.980
look, you know, evil. Yeah, well, that's what a lot of people do, actually, yeah. They just

31:07.980 --> 31:11.220
stand there looking forward. You'd fit right in, I swear, you'd fit right in. That's, that's

31:11.220 --> 31:16.220
That's like the prerequisite for being goth. You have to be able to stand around and look bored.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.220
And wear lots of black.

31:20.220 --> 31:23.220
At least that's how it was with all the people I hung out with back then.

31:24.220 --> 31:29.220
I remember the goth club. That's where the big hairy guy in the corset wanted to have sex with me.

31:30.220 --> 31:31.220
What?

31:32.220 --> 31:34.220
We're bears. Grrr.

31:35.220 --> 31:39.220
Actually, it's because I saw this movie on Thursday. I went and saw a movie called A Dirty Shame.

31:39.220 --> 31:43.060
And for those that know me at well at all, I'm a huge John Waters fan.

31:43.060 --> 31:45.020
If you don't know who John Waters is, you should.

31:45.020 --> 31:46.500
He directed Hairspray.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.100
Hairspray.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.460
Yeah, back before it was a musical.

31:48.460 --> 31:51.060
But Hairspray is very tame for his movies.

31:51.060 --> 31:54.580
I'm talking movies like Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom, Desperate Living.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.580
Those are all the ones I really like.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.700
Yeah, I haven't seen Serial Mom.

31:57.700 --> 31:58.420
Oh, you should.

31:58.420 --> 31:59.460
Serial Mom's a wonderful movie.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.460
But he has a new movie in theaters called The Dirty Shame.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.100
And it's a total sex comedy.

32:03.100 --> 32:04.260
Like it's NC-17.

32:04.260 --> 32:07.580
It is just absolutely perverse.

32:07.580 --> 32:10.140
And I don't know why I was thinking of that movie just now, but I was.

32:10.140 --> 32:14.580
I do recommend it, even though, seriously, in the last 30 minutes of the film,

32:14.580 --> 32:21.060
whoever wrote the script was so coked up that it makes absolutely no sense.

32:21.060 --> 32:24.660
Just being honest with you.

32:24.660 --> 32:29.100

to an inside joke and this is actually one of our new inside jokes but do you

32:43.860 --> 32:45.540
remember a couple weeks ago

32:45.540 --> 32:50.780
we had a little bit of a flub up from Tom Brokaw and he was doing the bukkake

32:50.780 --> 32:51.280
thing

32:51.280 --> 32:54.640
well

32:54.640 --> 32:59.760
it actually came to my attention it's actually in the intro, I guess you forgot about it, it actually came to my

32:59.760 --> 33:02.660
attention at the party I was at on Friday for some reason

33:02.660 --> 33:06.660
you know I was talking about the bukkake I don't know how it came up

33:06.660 --> 33:09.660
but somebody told me said hey Rob you know what

33:09.660 --> 33:12.900
that's not the first time he's done that he actually

33:12.900 --> 33:15.900
flubbed up once before they told me where to go so I get

33:15.900 --> 33:19.100
so this is old news this is like this flub up is like a year old

33:19.100 --> 33:24.340
but I swear it's twice as funny so listen to this it's a little bit long

33:24.340 --> 33:27.500
but listen carefully listen carefully for the mistake

33:27.500 --> 33:34.300
The president's trip to Ohio today was a bold effort to cash in on his wartime popularity

33:34.300 --> 33:36.860
as he tries to push through his tax cuts.

33:36.860 --> 33:41.140
The key component in what the president insists is a job stimulus program.

33:41.140 --> 33:45.380
Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.

33:45.380 --> 33:49.780
And as NBC's David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a

33:49.780 --> 33:55.780
A powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts are the answer.

33:55.780 --> 34:02.780
Did you hear that?

34:02.780 --> 34:04.780
Oh my god.

34:04.780 --> 34:05.780
Hold on one more time.

34:05.780 --> 34:07.780
I was over there doing the little schoolgirl giggle.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.780
One more time, one more time.

34:09.780 --> 34:17.780
The President took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts are the answer.

34:17.780 --> 34:21.780
tax cunts.

34:21.780 --> 34:23.780
You're so funny.

34:23.780 --> 34:27.780
It's funny when serious news people make big mistakes like that.

34:27.780 --> 34:29.780
I mean...

34:29.780 --> 34:31.780
You would find that funny.

34:31.780 --> 34:35.780
I mean, how many times do you hear the word cunt on the nightly news? Seriously.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.780
Who is not convinced it's tax cunts.

34:41.780 --> 34:45.780
That absolutely has nothing to do with Vomani and it has nothing to do with video gaming whatsoever.

34:45.780 --> 34:51.460
whatsoever it's just really it's really fucking funny like I thought of that

34:51.460 --> 34:54.820
phrase several times today like I'll just be sitting there I was sitting

34:54.820 --> 34:58.140
there at dinner earlier today and I was just eating and then suddenly I just had

34:58.140 --> 35:06.940
these images who is not convinced the tax concert and I started giggling god

35:06.940 --> 35:12.100
bless the internet I'll post that sound file on our forums a little later just

35:12.100 --> 35:21.060
I did the bukkake thing so huh that was beautiful what what what what what but

35:21.060 --> 35:27.260
what what what see what I tell you chat room what do you think was that better

35:27.260 --> 35:32.220
than bukkake I think they think so I'm getting a lot of ha ha ha so I guess

35:32.220 --> 35:35.900
they like that and that's like a year old but I had never heard of that I mean

35:35.900 --> 35:39.460
was new to me so I figured it'd be new to you guys too I didn't hear about that

35:39.460 --> 35:41.020
But maybe you guys did, I don't know.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.780
There are people in the world who do not pay attention to the news.

35:43.780 --> 35:44.780
I know.

35:44.780 --> 35:45.780
I know.

35:45.780 --> 35:46.780
Alright.

35:46.780 --> 35:53.100
And in case you don't know what a cunt is, because it looks like someone in our chat

35:53.100 --> 36:02.020
room doesn't know, a cunt is a euphemism for a lady's anatomy.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.020
Take that as you will.

36:03.020 --> 36:04.020
Alright.

36:04.020 --> 36:08.860
Let's change topics really quick here before I get into stuff too far.

36:08.860 --> 36:13.760
And actually we will do a Bamani related piece here.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.860
Actually Ultramix 2, there was some brand new news on Ultramix 2 this week.

36:16.860 --> 36:23.340
A brand new song was revealed and the band is Delirium and the song is called After All

36:23.340 --> 36:29.580
and it's remixed, it's remixed by a couple guys who did a really popular song in 7th

36:29.580 --> 36:30.580
style.

36:30.580 --> 36:31.580
I did do that in a cage match.

36:31.580 --> 36:36.060
And you actually, yeah, you put this song in a cage match one time.

36:36.060 --> 36:39.660
is a really interesting thing is now this is the first or it now where was

36:39.660 --> 36:43.140
the orange launch radio cage match based on we originally said it was like songs

36:43.140 --> 36:48.420
that we want to hear in DDR and lo and behold we have our very first cage match

36:48.420 --> 36:55.340
winning song that is now in a DDR game I swear we didn't blow huh yeah we didn't

36:55.340 --> 37:00.500
blow anybody at Konami we didn't blow like anybody very strongly yeah we did

37:00.500 --> 37:07.940
We did think about it, but yeah. Anyway, I want to cue this up, a little clip of

37:07.940 --> 37:11.380
The Beauty of Silence. You guys probably know this song. It's hoarded out all the

37:11.380 --> 37:15.460
time on 7th and 8th style, but here it is.

37:22.860 --> 37:26.620
Everybody knows that song. You like that song, right? The one from 2DX? Well, those

37:26.620 --> 37:30.820
Those guys, Svensson and Gielen, remixed a Delirium song, and it's going to be in DDR

37:30.820 --> 37:31.820
Ultimate 2.

37:31.820 --> 37:32.820
We are going to play it.

37:32.820 --> 37:36.620
The clue stumped everybody for a long, long time, but actually, I'm really proud, one

37:36.620 --> 37:40.520
of our news, our news guy, Dark Tetsuya, was the one that finally solved the clue.

37:40.520 --> 37:44.120
And the way he figured it out was, finally, he did a Google search.

37:44.120 --> 37:48.220
There were these two guys on the picture that Jason Enos had posted in the, um, DDR Freak

37:48.220 --> 37:52.220
thread, or, not, I'm sorry, not Jason, what am I thinking, I'm sorry, somebody that worked

37:52.220 --> 37:57.940
at the company or somebody there had posted a DDR Freak thread, what am I thinking, about

37:57.940 --> 38:03.900
these two guys that were gay guys or something. And everybody was like... Thunderpuss? Yeah,

38:03.900 --> 38:10.060
was like, who are these? They're gay guys or something like that, right? And everybody

38:10.060 --> 38:14.260
was assuming that the guys were gay, and they were totally wrong, they just happened to

38:14.260 --> 38:19.180
be Svensson and Guilin, but nobody thought to search for Svensson and Guilin. So, very

38:19.180 --> 38:25.120
interesting huh all right actually it's kind of funny because I didn't even I

38:25.120 --> 38:29.520
didn't even realize it when I was doing the show a couple weeks ago uh-huh and I

38:29.520 --> 38:37.600
played another version I have after all it's actually on the the delirium best I

38:37.600 --> 38:47.560
think it was I think this is it I think that both versions are on here okay no

38:47.560 --> 38:53.560
No, it's not on this one, but it's on another Delirium CD that I have that has both versions of it.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.560
Alright, we're going to play that song for you guys.

38:59.560 --> 39:04.560
And after that we'll play, I guess we'll play the whole beauty of silence so you guys can hear it.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.560
And then we'll come back with the show.

39:07.560 --> 39:10.560
But I know you guys may not have all heard this song yet.

39:10.560 --> 39:14.560
Sometimes people look to us to play the new UltraMix II songs for you guys.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.560
So we're going to play it for you guys right now.

39:16.560 --> 39:20.140
And when we come back, there's more news about Ultramix 2 I want to get into.

39:20.140 --> 39:23.060
This is on everybody's mind this week, and I have a lot I want to say about it too as

39:23.060 --> 39:24.060
well.

39:24.060 --> 39:28.100
So here we go, this is Delirium with After All.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.100
Mensing Gila Mix, new for Ultramix 2, enjoy!

39:58.100 --> 40:04.100
It becomes very exciting to see the noises of my eyes

40:04.100 --> 40:07.100
As I wash each other's hands inside

40:07.100 --> 40:11.100
No good to give, no meaning to lose

40:11.100 --> 40:15.100
The misting of the night

40:15.100 --> 40:19.100
Everything runs out

40:19.100 --> 40:25.100
And all these headaches, everything goes

40:55.100 --> 41:02.700
Nothing's left, but it's we who started it

41:02.700 --> 41:06.500
And so all she sees now is her son

41:06.500 --> 41:10.100
Pushing her young, she's upside down

41:10.100 --> 41:13.700
The pictures behind her closed eyes

41:13.700 --> 41:18.700
Sign you in to find the hero's home

41:31.700 --> 41:36.700
After all these decades, every day I know

41:37.700 --> 41:42.700
After all these decades, every way I come home

41:42.700 --> 41:46.700
Said she wouldn't cry, that would be just love

41:49.700 --> 41:54.700
I can only say things to be said, no

41:55.700 --> 42:00.700
I can only say, turn away from her

42:00.700 --> 42:03.700
Said she wouldn't cry, that would be just love

42:03.700 --> 42:08.700
I can only say, things to be said, no

42:08.700 --> 42:14.700
As we won't be shaken away from her

42:14.700 --> 42:18.700
That she wouldn't cry, that would be a crime

44:14.700 --> 44:38.700
Gaming radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

44:38.700 --> 44:40.700
Uh, buj- uh, bukkawky.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.700
Orange Lounge Radio.

44:42.700 --> 44:48.700
We are back here on Orange Long's radio. That was awful.

44:48.700 --> 44:52.100
I'm gonna beat that joke in the ground. Just you wait.

44:52.100 --> 44:56.700
That was awful. Beautiful.

44:56.700 --> 45:01.700
We are back here on Orange Long's radio. Hope you enjoyed that little sneak peek there at

45:01.700 --> 45:06.000
Delirium with After All. Gonna be in UltraMix 2.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.500
How many more songs they have to announce for UltraMix 2 still? Like what? Like 150?

45:10.500 --> 45:16.100
I don't like how many songs there's an ungodly amount of songs. They still haven't even told us for Ultramix 2 at least

45:16.660 --> 45:22.060
At least like what 40? I don't know. I don't even remember. I haven't been I haven't been doing my math very well, so

45:22.860 --> 45:26.260
There's a lot of new songs still coming for Ultramix 2, and that's just the beginning

45:26.260 --> 45:29.620
I I really like that song and I can't wait to play it in Ultramix 2

45:29.620 --> 45:31.620
I know you got to be excited about that one Jamie

45:32.460 --> 45:36.580
You you you called it in a way. I'm so awesome

45:36.580 --> 45:48.140
All right. Also, UltraMix II news this week. There was a video posted on the Internet,

45:48.140 --> 45:51.020
and I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of this by now, but if you haven't, run on

45:51.020 --> 45:55.500
over to our website, orangeloungeradio.com, and it's the second story down on our site

45:55.500 --> 46:00.060
right now. It talks about the UltraMix II quad mode video. That's right. A video was

46:00.060 --> 46:05.860
posted on the Internet that shows quad mode in action. Oh, excuse me. I'm a little burpy

46:05.860 --> 46:09.820
you today yeah and quad mode is that mode now on DDR that you have not one

46:09.820 --> 46:13.020
not two not three but four dance pads all lined up in a row and you're

46:13.020 --> 46:18.020
dancing back and forth across all four dance pads and this video was posted on

46:18.020 --> 46:20.820
the internet of this mode yeah you knew you probably haven't seen this yet Dark

46:20.820 --> 46:26.140
Saga have you let me show you this because actually what really is causing

46:26.140 --> 46:29.820
up a storm here it has nothing to do really with the quad with the quad mode

46:29.820 --> 46:35.440
itself but it has everything to do with how the game actually looks so you

46:35.440 --> 46:38.440
You definitely want to check this out here.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.560
Let's see if we can get the video up here.

46:43.560 --> 46:44.880
Oh, I got to give it a minute.

46:44.880 --> 46:48.160
It's going to load up here.

46:48.160 --> 46:51.080
Unless I saved it to the desktop or something.

46:51.080 --> 46:53.560
Yeah, well, it takes just as long to copy it over as it

46:53.560 --> 46:54.840
would to download it.

46:54.840 --> 46:58.000
So I'm stuck now.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
All right, it's coming, it's coming.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.240
Hold on.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.760
But yeah, this is definitely generating a lot of buzz in

47:04.760 --> 47:06.980
DDR community right now because we really haven't heard a whole lot about

47:06.980 --> 47:12.240
Ultramix tube outside of song list and the game's only like what six weeks away

47:12.240 --> 47:15.080
supposedly from what we've heard six weeks away from release okay here we go

47:15.080 --> 47:24.400
here it is here's the video let me uh it's a clipper right on the light so

47:24.400 --> 47:28.800
look at that there's all these brand new videos there's like a motorcycle thing

47:28.800 --> 47:32.120
that's all brand new everything looks like futuristic like all these new

47:32.120 --> 47:36.360
videos and then of course you know quad mode pretty much looks the way you

47:36.360 --> 47:42.320
would expect it to but the rage has a new model look at that rage looks

47:42.320 --> 47:45.620
completely different like he's got like really poofy hair he looks like me in

47:45.620 --> 47:52.080
the morning kind of with that hair and his motions are much different we saw

47:52.080 --> 47:56.560
this 33 that all of the other battles and now he's doing like cartwheels and

47:56.560 --> 48:03.620
stuff like totally different dances yeah well no we saw it at at a e3 and we saw

48:03.620 --> 48:07.300
Emmys Hucci model right but the thing is is that actually this video shows you it

48:07.300 --> 48:11.820
might be the other video let me bring yeah if I bring up the other video she's

48:11.820 --> 48:17.380
been D Hucci 5 because a bunch of people fussed about it at e3 we do not want

48:17.380 --> 48:20.500
Hucci Emmys I actually from what I understand when I was told is that

48:20.500 --> 48:24.300
actually because of a lot of the e3 feedback they did kind of reevaluate

48:24.300 --> 48:27.660
What they had done with Emmy and they changed her back and so in this other video

48:27.660 --> 48:31.580
I'm going to pull up you can actually see and if you want download these videos yourselves orange on serie calm

48:31.580 --> 48:34.340
We have a link right there on the front page still don't get pencils rage

48:35.100 --> 48:38.980
They need hoochie fight characters for download. I'm telling you. I

48:39.540 --> 48:43.640
Know I want to hire a rez monitor or model of

48:44.520 --> 48:46.520
Mr. Spanky

48:46.520 --> 48:51.520
Look, Emi's back to normal there. This is a three-player mode.

48:51.520 --> 48:56.520
And you see multiple dancers kind of going at one time there.

48:56.520 --> 49:01.520
You got Afro and you got Rage and Emi all dancing in this one.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.520
Like a three-player dance mode.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.520
They're all doing ballet.

49:06.520 --> 49:09.520
They need to stop coloring them up in second place.

49:09.520 --> 49:12.520
Yeah, it's kind of all these little insane little...

49:12.520 --> 49:18.080
Anyway, you can kind of get a...

49:18.080 --> 49:19.080
I can't see Emi.

49:19.080 --> 49:20.080
You can't see Emi?

49:20.080 --> 49:21.080
Wait, hold up.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.080
There's Emi.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.080
Oh, it's her fourth mix.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.080
She's fun by.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.080
Her fourth mix.

49:25.080 --> 49:26.080
Yeah, it's her fourth mix costume.

49:26.080 --> 49:27.920
You can kind of see her.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.400
She's got a little hat and stuff.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.760
Yeah, she did be a hoochie fighter.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.760
That's cool.

49:32.760 --> 49:33.760
Yeah, so.

49:33.760 --> 49:38.680
They gave her just like this utter hoochie version of like the fourth mix outfit and

49:38.680 --> 49:41.800
that was just kind of wrong.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.760
It was not, you would think it's cool.

49:43.760 --> 49:46.560
Yes, I would.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.960
So anyway, lots of reaction in the Bomani community

49:49.960 --> 49:51.680
going on to those videos.

49:51.680 --> 49:56.560
Now, I usually don't talk about certain posts

49:56.560 --> 49:58.440
on certain websites, but there was

49:58.440 --> 50:01.200
one post that really just got my panties in a bunch,

50:01.200 --> 50:02.240
to be honest.

50:02.240 --> 50:04.880
And this guy came out of the blue

50:04.880 --> 50:08.880
and just started dogging on the quad mode video saying,

50:08.880 --> 50:11.160
those steps are horrible.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.120
And we all know this would happen.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.440
We've told Seagurd, we've told Mel, when they were here on the show before, we said, you

50:17.440 --> 50:18.440
know what?

50:18.440 --> 50:19.440
People are going to hate the steps.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.400
We had to say it to you guys, but that's the first thing people are going to bag on when

50:21.400 --> 50:22.400
Ultramix 2 comes out.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.140
And I'm sure the steps are great.

50:24.140 --> 50:27.560
They're awesome, but there's always going to be somebody that doesn't like the steps.

50:27.560 --> 50:31.580
And sure enough, this guy comes out of the woodwork and just starts dogging on the steps

50:31.580 --> 50:33.960
saying they're horrible for a standard mode.

50:33.960 --> 50:38.260
What are they doing with all these crosshairs and all this bullshit.

50:38.260 --> 50:42.060
And I'm just thinking, get a load of this guy, you know, whatever, you know, everybody's

50:42.060 --> 50:43.900
welcome to their opinion.

50:43.900 --> 50:49.780
But then I found out that after some more posts went by that this guy had done some

50:49.780 --> 50:53.460
of the step charts for In the Groove.

50:53.460 --> 50:57.380
And I'm sitting here going, who the fuck are you?

50:57.380 --> 50:58.380
Get off your high horse.

50:58.380 --> 51:01.940
I mean, seriously, I talked about In the Groove here last week on the show.

51:01.940 --> 51:02.940
It's a nice game.

51:02.940 --> 51:04.860
It's a cute alternative to DDR.

51:04.860 --> 51:07.660
It's not a replacement for DDR, but it's something else fun to play.

51:07.660 --> 51:10.220
The steps are not all that, okay?

51:10.220 --> 51:12.360
I mean, they've got some neat new ideas,

51:12.360 --> 51:15.620
but they're no better or worse than what we got right now.

51:15.620 --> 51:18.480
I mean, God, this is kinda like, God, get over yourself.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.020
I just think that's in poor taste,

51:20.020 --> 51:23.260
because when you're representing a company like that,

51:23.260 --> 51:24.500
especially when you've got

51:24.500 --> 51:26.580
all these questionable legal issues going around,

51:26.580 --> 51:29.400
for you to go and start dogging on the enemy game,

51:29.400 --> 51:30.780
I mean, it just makes you look like

51:30.780 --> 51:32.440
you had a vendetta from the start,

51:32.440 --> 51:34.420
your opinions don't mean shit,

51:34.420 --> 51:36.060
and it just makes your whole game look shitty.

51:36.060 --> 51:42.060
I mean, there was a point earlier this week where I was like, I'm going to come on Sunday's show, I'm going to take back everything nice I said about in the group, because that guy's pissed me off.

51:42.060 --> 51:50.060
I've calmed down a little bit since then. I'm not going to take back everything nice I said about in the group. But, I mean, seriously, what a lack of class.

51:50.060 --> 51:52.060
Can I take back everything nice you said about in the group?

51:52.060 --> 51:53.060
You can say whatever you want.

51:53.060 --> 51:54.060
I take it back for Rob.

51:59.060 --> 52:02.060
I'm kind of surprised there's no reaction from our chat room. I thought half of them were following what was going on.

52:02.060 --> 52:07.060
I don't know. We've still got people fixated on you talking about getting your panties in a bunch.

52:10.060 --> 52:16.060
What did you think of this, Loki? I mean, you're kind of more Sim scene oriented than us, so what did you think of this?

52:16.060 --> 52:18.060
I don't know. I didn't read the post.

52:19.060 --> 52:22.060
Probably for the best. To be honest, probably for the best.

52:22.060 --> 52:25.060
I just hate people bitching about shit that they haven't seen yet.

52:25.060 --> 52:27.060
Oh my god, they're so awful!

52:27.060 --> 52:29.060
The game's not out yet.

52:29.060 --> 52:32.260
But I can tell! I have ESP!

52:32.260 --> 52:37.380
That's like, God, if only he knew,

52:37.380 --> 52:41.380
if only he knew, I can't say, if only he knew,

52:41.380 --> 52:45.140
he couldn't really say anything, because it's just, you know...

52:45.140 --> 52:48.380
Yeah, anyway, but what's interesting is that,

52:48.380 --> 52:54.580
you know, I don't even know, it's almost like they're just looking for an excuse

52:54.580 --> 52:54.940
to

52:54.940 --> 52:58.620
dog on these people who work their ass off on, you know,

52:58.620 --> 53:03.900
giving this game together. We all know damn well that KDA folks were doing the steps this

53:03.900 --> 53:07.900
time because they wanted to make it right. What they did from UltraMix 1, they knew that

53:07.900 --> 53:11.880
they screwed up the steps, so they wanted DDR fans to do the steps, and some people

53:11.880 --> 53:15.740
are jealous that they weren't the ones doing it, so they're taking the first step chance

53:15.740 --> 53:19.140
they can to just dog on what's going on, and these guys worked their ass off. They were

53:19.140 --> 53:24.660
working like 12, 14 hour days that would make you cry to get this game done for us, and

53:24.660 --> 53:30.660
You know, it's just I think it's just totally disrespectful and just I honestly if this guy had nothing to do with the other game

53:30.660 --> 53:33.680
I don't think it would be such a big deal because you just write it off as well

53:33.680 --> 53:39.020
You know, there's always gonna be one heckler but the fact that he represents because he worked with this other game

53:39.020 --> 53:42.540
He therefore represents that other game. It just shows an utter lack of class

53:42.540 --> 53:44.900
It just makes me like just it just disgusts me

53:44.900 --> 53:47.560
It's not even a fact that he represents the other game because I mean

53:47.560 --> 53:51.220
Let's just say he was the guy that was doing the art for the backgrounds for like, you know

53:51.220 --> 53:54.700
their game you know songs or whatever that wouldn't even be so bad but it's

53:54.700 --> 53:59.740
the guy that did some of the step charts okay that's even worse and I'm getting

53:59.740 --> 54:02.860
told in the chat room hey don't put in the group down because of one guy and

54:02.860 --> 54:07.840
you know what I I don't like I said I was gonna come in here and say a lot of

54:07.840 --> 54:11.580
nasty things about it I decide not to but here's the problem when this guy who

54:11.580 --> 54:16.860
works on the game can't show any class at all or any sense of respect at all

54:16.860 --> 54:21.300
for what's going on you know on the other half of the fence it does bring

54:21.300 --> 54:24.820
the whole image of everybody on the staff down and I'm sure there's some

54:24.820 --> 54:26.900
wonderful people that work on the game there's wonderful people to play the

54:26.900 --> 54:31.380
game there's no doubt about that but one bad apple is can spoil a barrel it's

54:31.380 --> 54:35.080
just like if anybody that out there that uses an orange lounge banner in their

54:35.080 --> 54:39.360
signature I would expect that you're not a fucking asshat in your post because

54:39.360 --> 54:42.260
you're kind of representing our station and if you were starting to be an

54:42.260 --> 54:45.100
asshole in your post I would call you on I'd say you know what don't use our

54:45.100 --> 54:48.420
banner anymore if you're gonna act like an ass. Luckily nice people use our

54:48.420 --> 54:51.560
banner so we don't have that problem. But when you're representing another, you

54:51.560 --> 54:55.180
know, company, I'm sorry, but when you act like an ass it makes everybody look like

54:55.180 --> 54:57.380
an ass.

54:59.540 --> 55:06.620
Anyway. No, I completely agree. That's why I have the reason why I don't say where I work.

55:06.620 --> 55:12.700
No, seriously. Because I know how I am outside of work. I don't want to be seen

55:12.700 --> 55:15.900
as a representative of my company when I'm not associated with it.

55:15.900 --> 55:17.100
Right, me too. Same thing.

55:17.100 --> 55:22.300
So none of us have ever said exactly where we work for it, except for Loki, but he doesn't care.

55:22.300 --> 55:23.740
He doesn't care what you think of his company.

55:25.340 --> 55:29.580
To be honest, I don't think anyone would even know about how to get on internet radio at my work,

55:29.580 --> 55:34.380
let alone, you know, be able to, you know, figure things out. And they're like, there's,

55:34.380 --> 55:37.340
where do you guys broadcast on the internet? You can do that?

55:38.140 --> 55:39.260
But it's like when-

55:39.260 --> 55:42.260
There's radio on the internet? Holy crap! What's the internet?

55:42.260 --> 55:53.260
It's like, you know, when I went to Vegas as part of the DDR Freak moderator trip, there were these guys here who were like fanboys who were following us around everywhere.

55:53.260 --> 55:57.260
And I still wanted to turn around and say, don't you have lives? Go home.

55:57.260 --> 56:03.260
But because I was a representative of DDR Freak, I didn't say that. I was just tolerant.

56:03.260 --> 56:07.260
And we actually ended up losing him.

56:07.260 --> 56:10.920
so you know that and you know what

56:10.920 --> 56:14.400
does the guy have valid points I don't know but the problem is that it was a

56:14.400 --> 56:15.900
total like attitude problems

56:15.900 --> 56:19.200
so it wouldn't take you know could dish it out but couldn't take it back

56:19.200 --> 56:23.340
I'm spending way too much time on this topic to be honest

56:23.340 --> 56:26.900
it really doesn't deserve this much time but that just really I just want you

56:26.900 --> 56:27.620
guys to think

56:27.620 --> 56:30.640
out there you know if you're representing a certain you know game

56:30.640 --> 56:35.420
stopping an idiot and that even goes for just any old DDR player somebody playing

56:35.420 --> 56:36.740
DDR at the arcade

56:36.740 --> 56:43.740
If you start acting like an ass, you make every player that looks like- plays DDR make- look like an ass, so show a little bit of respect.

56:44.740 --> 56:49.740
I mean, it's just like, I kind of frown at some people that- certain people that play Soul Calibur 2 in the area, because they're kind of assholes.

56:49.740 --> 56:56.740
I mean, and it's- I'm sure, you know, it's a great game, I own it on GameCube, but, you know, it kind of brings the whole fanbase down a little bit when a couple people look like asses.

56:56.740 --> 56:59.740
And don't get me started on the initial D, people.

56:59.740 --> 57:12.740
I'm gonna second that. I'm not even gonna go there. That's actually probably a much better example. I can think of more examples for that.

57:12.740 --> 57:19.740
Hi, I play this racing game so I have a really awesome car that's stored on a piece of paper.

57:19.740 --> 57:30.160
I like in the groove don't get me wrong I mean not well not not just that but you

57:30.160 --> 57:37.480
know initial D as well you know anyway I think we beat that into the ground yeah

57:37.480 --> 57:40.140
we did beat I have ice cream I just I wanted to get that out of my system

57:40.140 --> 57:44.240
I've been sitting on that all week do you feel better a lot actually do you

57:44.240 --> 57:48.920
feel spiritually I do you know what I would I would go so far as to welcome

57:48.920 --> 57:54.560
Welcome that guy on our show, if he wants to present a dissenting opinion, go for it.

57:54.560 --> 58:00.840
I'd love to hear it. I would love to debate. It would be just like the presidential debate.

58:00.840 --> 58:05.540
But seriously, it's just one step chart. On a mode that really, I mean honestly, quad

58:05.540 --> 58:10.440
mode, it's cute and all, but it really isn't that important. I mean, I want to see what

58:10.440 --> 58:13.800
the rest of the game looks like, to be honest. Let's look at some singles and doubles and

58:13.800 --> 58:19.640
how I mean honestly out regardless of how you feel about the step chart look

58:19.640 --> 58:23.680
at this all new backgrounds a whole new song a whole new interface the

58:23.680 --> 58:27.560
characters look differently no more hoochie me I mean there's so you could

58:27.560 --> 58:33.200
throw the step chart out completely and there's so many good things about it I'm

58:33.200 --> 58:37.160
very pissed on that they got rid of who she me that makes me sad maybe she's an

58:37.160 --> 58:42.480
Easter egg she's not an Easter egg they just here you're making the poor CG

58:42.480 --> 58:47.920
woman look like a hoochie no it might hurt her artificial feelings right who

58:47.920 --> 58:53.820
cares if it didn't look right I mean some things just aren't right but they

58:53.820 --> 59:01.080
happen like the Olsen twins acting that's just not right but it happens but

59:01.080 --> 59:05.840
yeah if we want to get down on someone that sucks at steps holy crap who about

59:05.840 --> 59:09.840
the people that made that stupid fucking heads and feet mode those are some

59:09.840 --> 59:15.120
shitty steps right there that's what I gotta say that's who you should be mad

59:15.120 --> 59:20.340
at screw quad mode quad modes difficult because it's four pads and the feet mode

59:20.340 --> 59:26.640
man they did not screw you I kind of like hands and feet mode screw you you

59:26.640 --> 59:30.000
can actually from what I hear you can actually go in and change the difficulty

59:30.000 --> 59:33.200
but for whatever reason they made it kind of like almost impossible to find

59:33.200 --> 59:36.480
where to change like I just found out about this the other day like it's

59:36.480 --> 59:39.200
almost impossible like to figure out where you got to go to you know it's not

59:39.200 --> 59:42.280
obvious in other words it's not possible it's not obvious where it is to change

59:42.280 --> 59:45.960
difficulty but it's just kind of like hi my name is Tina I shut up you know

59:45.960 --> 59:52.360
nobody cares I hate banner ads that have sound in them I absolutely hate them and

59:52.360 --> 59:56.560
that banner is all over the internet right why not do feedback there's

59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.200
feedback thread no no I'm not even talking about this I'm just using this

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.800
to get that one video that I lost all of a sudden but it's on like a million

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:13.100
another site so just Tina can go to hell that's how I feel about Tina I want to

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:17.280
get to this other video but for some reason I keep trying to pull it up and

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.040
it doesn't work oh I know why because I got to use the other program to do it

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:26.800
let me do to do to do let's see I want to load up another video that came out

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:35.000
this week and it actually has to do for DDR festival a brand new video came out

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.120
for DDR festival and it shows something kind of interesting going on let's see

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.840
what was the name of that is that this thing ah here it is this is the DDR

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.120
festival teaser now obviously we're on the radio you guys can't see it but I'll

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.440
tell you what's kind of going on here yay little you know fireworks because

01:00:53.440 --> 01:01:00.440
Festival, hooray, obviously. There's Maximizer.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.680
And look at that, a brand new character select screen

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.800
that has your characters. There's rhythm, there's blues, and look at that.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.960
One, two, three outfits for every character now,

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.720
that you can pick right there. Some people are calling that customizable characters. I call

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.080
that

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.320
three outfits a character, but whatever.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.880
There's a new guy there. There's a guy named Drum. So do you think he'll have a

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880
partner named Bass?

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.880
I don't know. We'll see.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.880
And there's a little bit of the song lip.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.880
Pretty much what you'd expect. There's a clip from You're Not Here.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.880
A little bit of the party mode there, but it's all in Japanese, which makes sense.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.880
There's that Feed the Dog and Bunny mode.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.880
And there are some of the members from B4U playing on the itoy.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.880
And it looks much better than the itoy actually does.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:11.880
You should see, like in this video, the B4U chicks, they totally are like paraparing some of these hands of B things on itoy.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.880
And I love Noria, she's such a cracko.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.880
Look at that, look, she's like totally par-par-ing to clear the screen there.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.880
It's so cute.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.880
There's Mission Mode, you know that's coming back.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:47.200
There's a little clip of your reign in that video, we all know that song.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:58.560
Bunk Boogie. So, no big surprises there about DDR Festival. Not right now. Anyway, no big

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:04.520
surprises there about DDR Festival, honestly. Basically, the three outfits of character

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.120
thing, that's kind of new and that's kind of cute. There's probably a whole assload

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.800
of characters as well. But, to be honest, this is kind of a chance for those of you

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:17.400
guys that don't have a US machine to get to experience the iToy modes and

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.280
basically everything that's in Extreme USA, so if you only have a Japanese

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.360
machine, which I do, I only have a Japanese PS2. If I didn't live with

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.360
Loki, I wouldn't have access to an American PS2, so I only have a Japanese

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.200
PS2, so this would kind of be my option to kind of play a lot of the songs

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:33.400
really, so. You've had mission modes in Japanese, because you can't figure out what the fuck to do.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:41.440
Exactly, so I don't know how this... You know there's going to be FAQs up on that one in no time. There'll be FAQs up on it in no time, but I'm not sure how much I would

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.260
desire to own this game personally there's really not a whole lot new in it

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:50.260
I mean I already own the Xbox but you know there's you know if you don't own

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.260
an Xbox you know it's your first chance to play some of those songs and I want

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:58.020
the fucking European one they have better mixes anyways get that well

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.380
actually there is gonna be a song from a euro mix in there a Jamila with

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.660
superstar which I know best from the queer eye for the straight guy

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:11.580
soundtrack actually so yep um we should probably we should play that well okay

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.580
we'll play that song at some point I bet some people want to hear that for DDR

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.660
festival and you know I played it on my show a couple times yeah it's a good

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:23.660
song oh my god my spin instructor loves that song she adopted it so I don't know

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.380
what do you think about the ER festival you own a Japanese and American PS2 is

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.820
this something you're kind of interested in getting it all you think Jamie I get

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.620
it I don't have an i-toy so I don't really give a crap about the i-toy

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:42.620
I'm not going to play a game and watch myself flail around stupidly, so no. But I'll get it. I'll get it for stuff.

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:48.620
I think, you know what, personally, I think I'm actually going to pass on it. I really don't see the point for me getting it because I can't read Japanese.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:56.620
I already have all the songs minus like three or four or whatever, how many songs have been in DDR yet. I just, there hasn't really been anything to really sell me on it yet.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:00.340
on it yet. I think it's one of those things I'll pick up later as a collector thing, like

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:04.120
when it's come down in price a little bit, maybe. Like, try to get it when it's a little

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:08.120
bit discounted before it becomes a collector's item and everything, but as much as I want

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.200
to support DDR and all, there's too much shit to buy in the U.S. right now.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.720
I already know what else my money's going for.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.280
And UltraMix 2 is coming out like the same week, and honestly, my money's going there

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.280
first.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:25.780
I have other imports to get. I have to get 2DX8 style and BlueJing guy, because the U.S.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:32.020
version is asked. All right, I guess we're gonna open up the Skype line because you

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.620
know what we've talked about a lot of different things here we've kind of

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.580
talked about quad mode and Ultramix 2 a little bit and a little bit of the

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:41.080
controversy there we talked about DER festival just curious if you guys have

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.940
any comments again if you don't know what the Skype line is all about visit

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:48.580
www.orangelandradar.com click on interact with us and you can see the

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:51.940
details right there on how to use the Skype line it allows you to call our

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:56.380
show without having a phone. I actually think I'm gonna buy the feature to allow

01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:01.480
us to call out so we can do some phone interviews later with some big-name DDR

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:05.840
celebs, so it'd be kind of fun. Yeah, you can actually call phone numbers using

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.580
this little tab right here, but you have to pay for credits, but you know, I'm

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.900
thinking about it. I might do that. We'll see. Yeah, I think it's a neat idea for

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.740
Skype, so we're kind of giving a minute for the buffer to catch up because it

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.820
takes, it takes a minute before you guys actually hear what we say here in studio

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:25.000
So I want you guys to be able to call into the skype line. Yes, looky

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:32.100
I just was liking one to point out to Rob here three away and four away now. I'm not to mention well

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.480
Hopefully we get those so hi. I just hope they're not fakes

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.860
Look, you might have something really good to play for you guys later. I just hope that God they're not fakes

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.420
What was that thing? You were showing me earlier today?

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:46.420
I guess it's a couple months old, but somebody had actually written a whole document like an FAQ on how to

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:52.940
to make fake Bahmani songs or something like that. How to make fake test location songs.

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:56.300
Which is another thing that I think is in completely poor taste. Don't get me started.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:01.300
You're just preying on poor people that are just looking to get excited about a new game.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:11.180
It's like, you know. But whatever. Yeah, you're showing me somewhere in here, some little

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:16.000
guide on how to write a fake Bahmani song. I just had to do, just running something through

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.080
a bunch of filters and also the garbage. Yay, we're getting a call. Let's go to the Skyline.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:26.240
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, Sky, it's Elmo Litigan. Hey, Mowat, how you

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:32.040
doing? The guy with the coolest name ever. Pretty good. Hey, what's on your mind? Well,

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.880
you mentioned DDR Festival and I have some choice words for DDR Festival. I have a feeling

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:45.320
I know it's coming, but go for it. Well, first of all, I mean, I know a lot of U.S. mixes

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:52.200
been accused of being you know like half-assed like just piling things one on top of the other

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:58.200
and not having a lot of balance to them uh-huh i see festival as probably the

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:07.000
a perfect example of being a half-assed mix just as far as the uh konami originals

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.920
are concerned i don't know if it's so much a half-assed mix it's just the fact that for once

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.800
I think it's just the tables are turned and we got something kind of new before Japanese did so

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:24.200
This game coming out for them is kind of like when we got like DDR USA. What the hell was that?

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.760
It was just a rehash thing. You know, there really wasn't anything special about it

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:31.320
Maybe I'll take a half-assed comment back and I'll go with rehash

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:38.440
But half-assed was the first thing that I thought of only because on the way of the Konami originals included

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:46.440
thus far, anyway. None of them have appeared, have not appeared on a USA mix yet, and none

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:55.760
of them, I mean, the fact of the matter is, the entire Konami original selection, you

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.560
can find them on United States mixes already.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:04.440
Right, but for the standard, you know, person living in Japan who, you know, has a casual

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.720
passing interest in DDR, it is going to be something new to them, so, you know.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.720
Of course.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.800
But for us, for the import fans, for us, it's no big deal unless we don't have Xbox or don't

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.920
have a US PS2, you know?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920
That's pretty much it.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.280
For the Japanese gamer, it's something nice because they get more songs that they don't

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.220
have on their PS2s yet.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.960
For the American importer, it's kind of a letdown.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.880
But for us fucking obsessive collectors, it's kind of a letdown.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.600
But you know, we have to kind of face the fact that we're in the minority.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.040
And Konami, they're getting three games for their buck here, really.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.000
We all kind of know that Konami of Japan actually were the ones that did the interface that

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.800
Konami USA keeps getting criticized for.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.040
But basically, Konami of Japan made this interface and they got three games out of it.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.200
They got the one in Europe, they got our game, they got their new festival.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.600
So hey, I'm sure it worked out great for them.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.020
Oh yeah, definitely.

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.020
Very easy to develop.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:03.320
You come up with a basic skeleton and then you plug in the insides.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.880
For me, I just think it's kind of neat to have the tables turned for once, and we're

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.160
getting something new, and it's kind of like, oh, well, we don't need the Japanese mix now.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.800
We don't need to support that.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.000
It's the same damn argument that we heard three years ago when USA was getting the sloppy

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
seconds, you know?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Exactly.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.300
There's still some people who are going to spin this into Japan's favor.

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:32.980
I think it's comedy gold for all those people that were dogging on Extreme before saying

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:38.860
it wasn't Japanese enough. I think it is just comedy gold. It's totally, it's totally just

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:44.100
desserts for those people that just said, you know, it's crap. It's USA, just the America

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:53.740
ruined DDR. No, not really. This is the direction they wanted to move in. America, in fact,

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:58.280
I would go so far as to say that Hawaii, which is an American state, last time I checked,

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.980
is going to revolutionize CDR. No question about that, especially when you're

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.680
getting 50 songs

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.440
that are completely new and never been seen before.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.980
You never see that unless you're talking about a brand new Japanese

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:15.660
arcade mix. I'm gonna go so far as to make a prediction here

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.420
on the program that when UltraMix 2 comes out, about a couple weeks after

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:20.380
UltraMix 2,

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.700
it is going to be so huge and it's going to be so...

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.140
There are going to be those detractors, like people that work for In the Groove or

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:30.380
whatever that are going to be out there going on this game sucks but for the

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:35.060
most part 90% of the scene is going to just love this game and say this is

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.620
everything DDR should have been and I'm saying that there are going to be

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:44.780
freaking riots and petitions for Konami of Hawaii to do an arcade mix the

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:49.040
Konami of Hawaii should be given all the rights to do a new arcade mix I would

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.860
go so far as to say that I think they're going to be forgiven for DDR PC I think

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.360
most people have already forgiven them for it. It was just a chance for them to get their

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:03.160
feet wet, and we've all managed to look past it now. UltraMix had some problems, but you

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.520
know, for the most part it was different, it was new. And now UltraMix 2 is going to

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.960
blow it all away.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:15.520
I definitely agree about UltraMix 2, especially with the song list is pretty much half revealed

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.040
by now, and it just blows everything out of the water.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.540
And now just the videos this week, what did you think of the videos that came out this

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:31.820
week. The rage remodel kicks ass. Yeah. And the backgrounds and the videos looked awesome.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:37.540
I was very impressed with the movies. Very impressed. You know to be honest though, there's

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:41.300
a part of me that's like, why did they bother to show this game at E3? Because it looked

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:46.160
nothing like what they've got now. It's kind of like they played a trick on us. It's like

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.820
that E3 thing was a total waste. It was just a chance to say we're working on something

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:53.820
And now, you know, this game is just looking incredible.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:58.620
But it's so funny because even I at E3 said UltraMix 2, you know,

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.340
don't waste your breath, you know, it doesn't look like the right thing.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:05.300
But boy, did I get screwed.

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:05.980
Yeah, definitely.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:08.180
The first thing, yeah, I'll agree with you.

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.220
The first thing is like when I saw UltraMix 2, it's like, oh, they got a nice

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.900
selection of Konami originals that may or may not make it in the game.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:15.820
It looks good so far.

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.180
Yeah, they got that point battle thing.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:23.180
Well, you know those Konami originals? Well, they're in there, and that's all the old stuff you're getting.

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:26.180
Yeah. And by the way, there's 70 songs.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.180
Exactly.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.180
Any other thoughts on your mind, Mr. Mullet?

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.180
No, after that long voice thing.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.180
That's fine. Well, we appreciate your perspective as always.

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.180
No problem.

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.180
Have a wonderful day.

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.180
You too.

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:57.980
you too. Alright, bye bye. Bye. The other line was ringing. I'm sure we'll get a return

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:03.980
call there. We can pick that up. If you want to interact with the show, www.orangelandsradio.com

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:10.380
and click on interact with us. Here comes a call. Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:18.480
who's this you're breaking up really really badly try again okay hi how you

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:29.900
doing you know what oh yeah I hate to do this but I gotta let you go because we

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.240
can't hear you at all you're really breaking up bad double-check your

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.200
connection just it's really really breaking up there I can't understand you

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.700
So, we'll try that again later. Maybe we'll get a better connection.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:46.200
That's kind of why the downside of having to take the calls online is that when you get the packet lost and all that crap.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.200
Loki, are you downloading porn over there? Is that why it's so choppy? I'm just kidding.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.200
Alright, I guess we better disable the Skyblind for a little bit.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.700
We'll let it get a little better there.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:15:00.700
And, we'll go to a break.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:04.700
Because I want to get to the Orange Laundry cage match and some other Bimani news that came out this week for sure.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.200
We also have other favorite segments.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.600
Yes, and we'll open up the Skyline a little bit again later.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.480
In this break we're going to hear some music from,

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:17.000
I don't know, some Japanese mixes, some Japanese songs that are popular

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.320
in DDR, because Jamie really wanted to hear

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.920
Ninzaburo, or, what the hell is the other name of Ninzaburo? I always called it Ninzaburo.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.920
The theme of Furuhata. Thank you, Furuhata theme, I couldn't even remember that.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.760
Which is from the show, Furuhata Ninzaburo. That's right. So we're going to play some of these songs, and then we will be back with more

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.760
Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:31.840
Feel the heat of operations, all these streets, no situation

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.840
Got great complications, party people livin' life

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.840
But it's always getting the fast lane, like the yellow, you can't up that lane

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.840
I've seen so many blood stains, so many times with these brains

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.840
People see what's high, I say they look like the sky

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.840
Keepin' real and waiting lies, hella party people at five

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.840
This is your life, no key games, listen up and stay with the pain

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.840
Yeah, yeah!

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:45.840
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.840
Let's roll, ah, you, let's roll

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.840
Dance, complete the chant

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Get the feeling, let's do the beat then move

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:31.840
So feel the groove

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.840
Come on, dance

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.840
Jump, come on, let's jump

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:38.840
Come on, let's dance, there's got to be less of your feeling, come on!

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.840
You ready to roll

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.840
How you feelin' baby?

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.840
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:37.840
I was a little bit of awkward silence there, sorry guys.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:47.840
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. I just got distracted by the chatroom while I was trying to queue up the last bit of playlist thing there and I got too distracted.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.840
Don't spam our chatroom.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:57.940
I forgot to mention that actually I was I was up this morning you know while I

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.880
was up till 530 last night and I got up this morning at about 1130 or so I

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:05.080
started playing Ultramix like all morning I swear to God I was playing

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:09.760
Ultramix for like two hours today online on the dance you know playing against

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:15.140
other people thing and I think in one day I raised my ranking on the ranking

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:19.320
board from 999 which is you know basically as low as you can get like you

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.600
have to get a certain amount of points where you can never crack that number I

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:27.120
think I raised it up all the way to like 640 something in a day's work so which

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:31.440
isn't that many points but I just for some reason today Ultramix is like still

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.400
popular I was in a lot of four-person matches and the people were kind of

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.600
picking a lot of light songs and we're kind of kind of struggling a little bit

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.520
but you know my only complaint about Ultramix online is that god damn people

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:50.760
keep picking the same damn songs like the default song that comes up when you

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:55.280
want to pick a song to battle against somebody's 0.59 right Tengoku if you

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.840
want to call it that too that's the default song and so of course like a

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.640
million matches get started with that song because people don't know how to

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:04.920
change it it's kind of like I'm so sick of this song and then for some reason

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.440
today there was this one person I swear to God every match he or she created I

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.700
think it might have been a she every match she was creating secret rendezvous

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:16.180
a wizard song. It's like, ugh. It just kind of sucks because there's not a whole lot of

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.740
people on Ultramix. Usually there's only a couple groups of people playing, so you're

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.980
kind of stuck with whatever songs you can actually find.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.100
Why don't you start off and pick something different?

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:29.380
Yeah, wow, it's not like every time you start a game with, do that thing!

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:34.400
Okay, now it's not true. Just today, I played shiny disco balls and DXY in games, okay?

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.420
So just, you know, shut your mouth.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.140
Woohoo, DXY!

01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:41.060
Nobody else will pick do that thing. I have to show do that thing a little love. Everybody

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:48.940
let's do that thing what what what are you pointing it oh oh Loki wants me to

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:54.820
talk about this story speaking of songs we just posted this to our website even

01:22:54.820 --> 01:23:00.000
though this isn't like directly Bahmani related it's kind of Bahmani related one

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.500
of the ladies from the weather girls Yzora Rhodes she was one half of the

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:07.760
weather girls she died this week and the weather girls of course if you didn't

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.880
know they did the song it's raining men which was covered in a more very

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.760
infamous max 2 song by Jerry Halliwell aka ginger spice which by the way was

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.040
one of the other DDR songs I heard at the club last night was Jerry Halliwell

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:23.760
version of its raining men and I don't think I've ever heard that at a club in

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:31.320
my life and I don't think I've ever seen a dance floor so gay oh that's cool it

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.320
was from Bridget Jones diary which had a pretty pretty well-received soundtrack

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:43.000
from what I remember but moment of silence please for one half the weather

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:52.360
girls Yuzora Rhodes all right there we go all right and a little a little clip

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:59.360
for us to remember. Bye.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:19.800
I don't care how you feel about that song, you can't deny it's a good DDR song.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:25.720
that's great for DDR. It really is. Sure, it makes the game look a little fruity, but

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:28.880
you know what? The song rocks. You know what? I don't think that people can help but look

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:35.960
fruity on DDR. For every song like It's Raining Men, you get a song like Daikonkai, which

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:42.760
is kind of, you know, it's kind of rocking and mannish, I guess. It's a very Testosterone-y

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.640
I think. So, you know, I quit pitching. And there's all the, there's all the

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:52.600
taco stuff. Yeah. Which makes me happy. So shut your mouth. Yeah, we should take all

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.780
of those people, you know, make them go play Pada Pada. Excellent point from Mollet in our chat

01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:01.740
room. I'm still trying to figure out how songs are gay without the ability to

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:07.900
come out and tell us. I'm wondering how songs have a gender preference. Do you

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:12.500
like to, like, you know, boy songs go chat up other boy songs? I'll give you a hint.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:19.500
The Do That Thing video is kind of what clues you into the fact that that song's a little gay.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.500
Testostaroni!

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.500
Is that the new San Francisco tree?

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.500
Testostaroni.

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:32.500
I'm being teased by the listeners. I don't like that.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:38.500
I'm supposed to be proving some kind of fake power over them, and I don't like being teased.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.000
Rob, is your journalistic integrity being breached?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.700
Yes. I'm being breached.

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:48.100
You're being breached. And I don't like it.

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.600
So, we have more Bimani news. Uh, sure we do.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.600
I was actually going to queue up the cage match, but if you want to talk- Okay, cage match! Well then, let's do more Bimani news.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.200
Since you brought it up.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.700
You're the one talking about testosterone and bringing it up. Testosterone-y.

01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.420
Yes, Logi.

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:39.700
I've been a doggy so you might be able to PM him and ask him.

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:42.700
The Sage is fucking heavy. It is 200 pounds.

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.700
It's a real solo pad. It's a real thing.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.700
It hasn't been modified at all.

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.700
Yeah, he hasn't really done anything with it yet.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.700
Just in case you're interested and have a lot of cash.

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:54.700
Does he have an idea of how much he's charging for it?

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:55.700
No.

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.700
I'll pay a dollar.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.700
Put it on eBay.

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:02.700
Also, as long as we're doing miscellaneous Orange Honest Radio announcements,

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:06.940
to say happy birthday to our cam whore, Misty. It's her birthday today.

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:12.180
We also had a weekend a few days ago. A weekend. A birthday. A few days ago.

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:15.940
Ooh, I'm horrible with birthday. Oh, it's Sharks Girl. Of course, Sharks Girl's birthday

01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:20.100
was a couple days ago. She got to go play with dolphins on her birthday.

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.700
I know. That was very nice.

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:24.220
They were so cute. I want to have her back on the show to talk

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:30.520
about it. Cool. All right. Let's see. Bamani news before we get to the cage match, since

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.520
Jamie decided to delay the cage match here.

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.520
You were the one who decided, okay?

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.520
I just like ruffling your feathers.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.520
Uh, Dance Mania EX8 is on the way out.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.520
Of course Dance Mania being the series that a lot of DDR songs come from.

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:48.520
Uh, Dance Mania EX8 is on the way, and it's gonna have some lovely tracks on it, including...

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.520
Um, band?

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.520
Oh. Hold on, I'll do the band. God.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.520
Distract the show here so I can do a band.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.240
We're banning somebody for being a stupid butt.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:06.240
Alright. Uh, thank you, now I got that in your ear. What a waste of time.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.600
If you should blame anybody, you should blame the butt head who came in the chat room.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.120
Why do you have to do that when I've got other things going on, Mr.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.840
Spammerguy? Alright, anyway. Erotic with Gotta Get It Groovin', the remix of that's

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.160
gonna be on this CD. I'm trying to think of other DDR bands, you know.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.700
2 Unlimited, Maximum Overdrive, The Horny Horns

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:29.860
Vocal Radio Edit, Horny Horns, Who's That Girl?

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:34.700
Doing a cover of Burnin' Up by Madonna, Extreme with Upside Jump,

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:40.500
Atomic Kitten's gonna do Ladies Night, with Curtis Mantronic doing a remix,

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:43.720
which is actually a previous Cage Match pick of ours,

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.500
I believe. I don't think that remix is, but I know that song was,

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.980
because I picked it.

01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:54.060
Oh, what the hell is that song? Simply,

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.060
Or Strictly Business, I think.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:00.060
Uh, also we've got, um...

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.060
I saw there was another one on here I wanted to mention. Oh, Wildside!

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:05.060
You know Wildside. They did Ears is the Woman and My Sweet Darlin'.

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:07.060
They're gonna have Superstar.

01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:11.060
And I don't know if that has anything to do with any other versions of that song, but, uh...

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.060
That's gonna be on Dance Media EX8.

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.060
So look for that soon, and if you can't find it, that's alright.

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.060
It's gonna be speedy.

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:20.060
We'll play it on Orange L'Anterio as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:21.060
You know who I miss, actually?

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:22.060
Who?

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.060
I miss the Olivia project.

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:24.560
I do too.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.060
All those lovely Olivia Newton-John remakes.

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.060
It's cool stuff.

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:30.060
I know.

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:31.060
I'm sad.

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:32.060
Especially Xanadu.

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:37.060
What makes me really sad is it almost seems irrelevant to be posting on Dance Mania albums anymore.

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:41.060
Because it's like, I doubt we're going to see a new DDR, you know?

01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.060
It's just kind of like, it's sad. The whole thing's just sad.

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:46.060
It's all home versions.

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:50.060
Which kind of reminds me of an important question I want to ask on our LiveJournal community later this week.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:56.300
So, if you're not a member of our LiveJournal community, you should join at www.livejournal.com

01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:59.760
and its username, OrangeLounge, is our username.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:03.440
So for those of you guys that are on the LiveJournal, you sometimes get to see secret little posts

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:07.120
and you get to be in the know on some things, and you get reminded every Tuesday night the

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:08.320
pump up the volume is on.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320
Yeah, because...

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320
Well, okay...

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.400
No, it's a great promotional tour, it really is, and people seem to like having reminders,

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.400
because sometimes it's hard...

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:18.400
I usually post on there what the marathon's going to be in case you go, oh, that sucks.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:24.200
usually don't let them listen anyway. A little bit of a warning what's going to be played.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.400
Yeah. That's cool. No, it's a good way to keep tabs on what's going on.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.920
Sometimes there's a lot of things that, they're not quite appropriate to be posted on the

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.120
front page of our site,

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.400
but they're things we want to kind of, uh, clue the fans in on.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.960
For a picture, rather than a compromising position.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:45.400
Oh, shut up. Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:56.120
Last week, Echo Image made its return to the cage match with a song called Come Back, and

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:58.880
it was Loki's pick for the cage match.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.880
You know what though?

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:03.280
It may be a tricky night tonight, because Shane, I noticed, quit out of our chat room

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.000
earlier in the show, so he's not going to be here to persuade you all to vote for Echo

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Image.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.160
So, could be competitive tonight.

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.160
Could be.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.560
We got a lot of good songs tonight, but will an old favorite, or I should say a new old

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.400
favorite of the show, will it win?

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.400
Who knows?

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.400
Tonight's song number one.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:23.380
Oh, the way the cage match works, you get to hear three songs, you get to hear a clip

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:26.320
of last week's winner and two new songs in their entirety.

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:29.000
The song that wins goes into rotation all week long on Orange Laundry.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.440
It's the Bemani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week, when

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.440
we are not.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.440
All right.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.440
Cool?

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.080
All right, here's a clip of last week's winner.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:46.080
Echo Image, song number one you can vote for tonight, with Come Back.

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.080
And fall back to me

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.080
I'm lying here waiting

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:21.080
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:28.080
Feel my heart reaching out to you

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.080
You hear me calling

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:39.080
Know the boy, I know the way, I know

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:43.080
She'll see me fall down

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:50.080
Real wide, but I'm still singing to you

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.080
She'll see me fall down

01:32:53.080 --> 01:33:00.080
Know the boy, I know the way, I know

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:05.080
But she'll keep me wild, wild, wild

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:10.080
It's always the same, same, same

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:25.880
All right, song number one in the cage match with Echo Image with Come Back.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.560
And you know, we're noticing that our chat room seems kind of dead tonight.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.560
It's considering...

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.560
We're taking a nap.

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.360
We have just as many listeners as we usually do, but our chat room seems a little bit dead.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.360
I mean, there's a few of you.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.400
This is that new show, that new drama that everyone's going to be talking about on Monday

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.400
about horny housewives.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.400
Oh, God.

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.200
can be started and we're trying to think like seriously that's what we think

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.640
about like when when when the night seems kind of slow or a little bit dead

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.880
it's kind of like is there something else going on tonight like where the

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:53.080
Oscars on tonight huh I have a hard time believing they're all sitting at home

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.960
watching desperate housewives of the debate all right anyway moving on

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.040
they're playing Silent Hill 4 let's get on to a song number two tonight in a

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:08.640
cage match it is Jamie's pick Jamie tell us about your pick tonight I'll tell you

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:15.640
You decided to go with an old favorite too. You decided to use Loki's own tricks on him, and you went with an old favorite. You went with Enflow.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.640
Oh yeah, I just picked a random Enflow song because I couldn't think of anything else.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:25.640
Alright, so here's the random Enflow song that Jamie decided on. It's called You Said. Is this from their Astro album?

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:30.640
No, it's from... I don't remember the name of the album.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.640
Alright.

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:35.640
I think it's from the last one before the Astromantic.

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.140
Alright, fair enough. Well, here it is for you guys to give it a try.

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:43.080
See if you like this one enough to give it your vote tonight. It is MFLO with

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:50.080
you said, Jamie's picking my escape the match. Enjoy!

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:38.200
You said that you would not let me go You said that you would be for everything

01:35:38.200 --> 01:36:03.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:46.560
I will always be the one who will never let me go

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.560
Say that you will be my everything

01:36:52.560 --> 01:37:00.560
I will always be the one who will never let me go

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:26.040
So if you told me, oh, shit and shit, that I'm missing better, oh, I ain't shit, yeah.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.880
Say that you will never let me go

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.080
Say that you will be my everything

01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:07.080
Wanna always be around

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.760
Say that you will never let me go

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.840
Say that you will be my everything

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.780
Say that you will always be around

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:20.620
Say that you will never let me go

01:39:50.620 --> 01:40:20.580
All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Emplo with You Said.

01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:25.060
Now we will say what we thought of that song, starting with Jamie.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:26.320
I like that song.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.680
I was listening to some Unflow earlier today while I was doing my homework.

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.900
And that song, I was just sort of like, huh.

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:39.100
So yeah, I give it an 8 overall, because it's good, it's solid.

01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.740
It just sort of stuck out my head today.

01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:42.740
And it's better than what I was going to pick,

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:45.260
because I don't think that many of our listeners

01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:46.940
would be quite prepared for wrong stuff.

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.540
Out of hell with what the listeners think.

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:49.660
OK, I'll hit lose if I get it.

01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:57.660
It was alright. It started a little bit better as it went on though, so I'll give it a 7.5.

01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:59.660
Logie

01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:32.300
on the same page as Bradley. Alright, let's move on to song number three in tonight's

01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:38.580
Caves Match. I picked it, and it's by an artist called Karma Club, and I actually never heard

01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:42.420
of him until I just randomly downloaded this song on iTunes, but I was kind of like, huh,

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:48.340
this kind of reminds me of, like, Smile DK, like, but American, so. Look, he says he hates

01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:53.340
it already. Well, you be the judge. This is a song called Lucky Star, and the group is

01:41:53.340 --> 01:42:00.340
Karma Club. Enjoy. It's my pick for tonight's game match.

01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:33.340
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:37.340
Last night as I lay dreaming

01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:44.340

Okay. I've heard it before. Yeah, a lot of people in our chat room had heard it before, they said. I think it was the first time I heard it today.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.480

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.480
Alright. Bradley?

01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:17.320
there in our chat room. Meanwhile, oh my gosh, iTunes just crashed my whole damn computer.

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.260
I think we're, no, we're okay, we're still up, we're still up and running, but just iTunes

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:26.040
crashed, it was kind of scary. All right, meanwhile, I noticed Loki's looking on a site

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:29.860
about, that has to do with some other Bomani news that came out this week. I guess there's

01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:33.820
this guy and he does a lot of music for other video games that I don't really play, but

01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:37.940
apparently a lot of you people know him and he's kind of popular. His name's Jesper Kidd,

01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:43.340
KYD, right? And he does a lot of songs for other video games. Do you have a little clip

01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:46.980
of some Jesper Kidd songs here? Because Jesper Kidd has announced he's going to be doing

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:53.100
three songs for D.E.R. Ultramix 2, which is kind of nice. Alright, we're trying to find

01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:57.780
a little clip of a Jesper Kidd song to play for you guys here. Let's see if we can get

01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:02.780
a little. Just anything. Just play as anything so we can get a feel for what this guy sounds

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:13.780
like. Ooh. Maybe we'll get that industrial music you've been looking for, Jamie. He does

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:19.780
stuff that's very similar to, like, Quake-type music, you know? Very, that dark industrial

01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:24.780
type stuff. This stuff right here is from Freedom Fighters, that game. That's the main

01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:31.780
This is another fight for three. I want that, that's cool.

01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:41.220
Anyways, there's those. But what I was mentioning, or gonna mention actually,

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:45.140
from his website here. Let me get to him again.

01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:49.260
I want to add real fast the three songs that he has announced for Ultramix 2.

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:53.900
Istanbul Cafe is one, Red Room is another song, and then this other

01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:54.640
interesting one,

01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:00.360
59 or 59 kid Konami mix and kind of the question now is is that a remix of dot

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:08.400
five nine question mark yes it is and how do you know this I can't say but yes

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:11.500
it is oh well I didn't I didn't even know one way or the other you know

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:14.600
something I don't think is I don't know if this was a remix or not because a

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:22.000
certain person mentioned something about a I don't know point five nine remix

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.600
Alright, then I guess it is a 0.59 remix. I didn't know!

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:30.480
Well, hooray! We get a 0.59 remix by some random video game guy. That'll be fun.

01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.400
Alright. I didn't know.

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.400
Shit.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.080
Alright. Alright.

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:45.160
Uh, we will, uh, what are we gonna do? We gonna take a break? Are we gonna, uh,

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.400
talk about more Bonboni news, or what? Let's break stuff.

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:54.400
Let's break stuff. Actually, you know what? We did have a request. Somebody wanted to hear that Jamelia song, Superstar.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.400
Yeah, somebody did.

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:56.400
Yeah, that was you, wasn't it?

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.400
Somebody sitting in this big green chair.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.400
That's what I thought. But I think the other folks thought it was a good idea as well, so...

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.400
We'll play that for you guys.

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:12.920
No, we're not going to play Say I've Never Done a New Story.

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:17.840
We're going to play, uh, uh, we're going to play, uh, where the hell is it?

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.840
Where is it?

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.840
Oh, here, it's in here.

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:23.840
Alright.

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.320
Uh, there it is.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.320
Let's do this.

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.320
Wow, this is great radio, you guys.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.320
Alright, we'll be back after this.

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.040
It's actually the full version, because I don't have a DDR edit, but if you're going

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:34.400
to be getting DDR Festival, you'll be playing this song, and if you're lucky enough to be

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:37.900
begin the DDR Europe mixes. You've probably already been playing the song. It's Jamelio

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:44.900
with Superstar, we'll have the cage match winner when we come back from this.

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:11.900
Why did I want a piece of paper?

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:15.900
Got a feeling I'll see you later

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.900
There's something about this that's keeping moving

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:23.900
And if it's good enough to get something cooking

01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:26.900
Then I really wanna rock with you

01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:32.900
I'm still in some connection to this thing you do

01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:37.900
I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:39.900
I don't know who you are

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:44.900

01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:49.900

Still with all the problems later Bad boys aren't their best behavior

01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:12.900
There's something about you That keep it moving

01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:19.900
And if it's the last you hear something cooking Cause I really wanna laugh at you

01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:25.900
I'm still in some connection to the things you do

01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:29.900
I don't know what it is that makes me feel crazy

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:31.900
I don't know who you are

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:36.900
But you must be some kind of stupid love

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:41.900
Cause you gotta have a view no matter where you are

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.900

I like the way you're movin'

01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.900

I just get into the movin' then

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:52.900
You do it one day

01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:54.900

I don't know what it is

01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:24.900
That makes me feel like this

01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:25.900
Don't know

01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:30.900

But you must be some kind of superstar

01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:27.900
I'm going to take a promo!

01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:31.900
Listen to Orange Challenge Radio or not.

01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:33.900
How was that?

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:35.900
It was very lovely. I enjoyed that very much.

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.900
Okay, better, better, better.

01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:42.900
Listen to Orange Challenge Radio or I'll put fire ants in your shoes.

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:44.900
Ooh, that's a good one.

01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:46.900
Alright, I love that. That was nice.

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:52.900
Alright, uh, we're back and it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:55:52.900 --> 01:56:00.900
And, in tonight's cage match, boys and girls, it's a big surprise, a huge surprise.

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:08.900
Actually, first I want to say though, is that actually this is like the lowest participating cage match thing we've had in a long, long time.

01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:12.200
probably since we started the segment so only a few votes I don't know what's

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:16.040
going on people are like dead I think we've we've resorted to being that thing

01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:21.140
that's on in the background I think it's what's happened to us yeah scary anyway

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:26.840
um tonight we have a surprise we have a tie in tonight's cage match believe it

01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:31.480
or not which means someone's gonna be breaking the tie so let's find out what

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:47.480
two songs the tie is between song number one is echo image so that is a song

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.360
number one that is tied in tonight's cage match and song number two that is

01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:57.680
tied in tonight's cage match lucky star

01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.960
So, a bunch of M-Flow haters.

01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:06.720
That means, yes unfortunately M-Flow not feeling the love tonight, but somebody's better be

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.600
feeling the love from Jamie pretty soon here.

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.600
Jamie's gotta break the tie.

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:15.080
The Orange Lawns rules state that when there is a tie in the cage match, the host who didn't

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:17.680
end up in the tie gets to break the tie.

01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:18.680
And Jamie?

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:21.020
It depends on who's gonna pay me.

01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:23.520
I accept bribes, you know.

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:25.440
I'll show you my boob.

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.640
That's okay.

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:34.640
I don't know. Shane, who should I pick? I don't know what he's going to say.

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:39.200
Don't you want to get something new in there for once?

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:45.300
Aren't we a little sick, Echo Image? We just don't like happy Poppy Train.

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:50.920
But look at it this way, it'll lose next week for sure.

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:56.120
See, if Echo Image wins again, then I can put in Rammstein

01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:03.960
out everybody's speakers and that would win. Do you really want Rob to win? Well too bad

01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:14.360
you won. Yeah reverse alright fine then by a tie vote. I did it for Shane okay. I did

01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:19.800
it because Shane is my dunk fan. Alright. He's my dunk buddy. I was a good cliffhanger

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.600
Jamie. I applaud you for that one. Just because I'm awesome. Everybody wishes they were cool

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:28.120
like me all right uh echo image wins that's a nice cage

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:33.080
match by a whopping oh that's so sweet did you see what you had their hearts

01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:36.200
racing for a minute there

01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:40.760
and you know what's going to happen the minute that that song gets bumped out of

01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:43.240
the cage match is that somebody's going to put in that

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:47.720
never-ending story makes we'll have echo image for the rest of our lives

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:50.720
I already know Loki's planning on doing it.

01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:52.720
Liar.

01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:54.720
Alright.

01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:57.720
More Bomani news.

01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:00.720
You know, there's a couple other Bomani games where they've kinda slipped under the cracks.

01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:02.720
We haven't talked about them a whole lot.

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:05.720
But, you know, Tokyo Game Show happened this last week, and it kind of...

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.720
You know, we talked about DDR Festival.

01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:10.720
They had a new movie that showed there, and it showed the character customization.

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:13.720
It kinda showed us a little more what was going on with DDR Festival.

01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:21.920
also coming out was some more information on Pop'n Music and Beatmania 2DX, and apparently

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:26.300
they had some folks that were actually kind of doing a performance there at Tokyo Game

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:30.680
Show, and no unfortunately we don't have clips, but what I thought was interesting is that

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:35.360
L.E.D. was actually at the show, which is kind of, I had heard these rumors, yeah, but

01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:38.400
I heard these rumors he wasn't with Konami anymore, but here he is, showing up at Tokyo

01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:43.380
Game Show, helping promote, so I think he's back or something, and then they actually

01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:49.180
We had VJ, TA-K was there, and, uh, SLAKE!

01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:53.300
And, uh, LED vs. SLAKE was performing, which kind of gives you a hint that, gee, I wonder

01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:57.820
if there's gonna be a, uh, uh, 8th consumer style song like that.

01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:04.140
And, uh, let's see, uh, there was a song called Human Scramble from the anime A Human Crossing,

02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:08.640
I guess it was, uh, something performed by, uh, Aki...

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:09.640
As...

02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:10.640
Let me see.

02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.640
Asahina?

02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:12.640
Gimme gimme gimme.

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:18.640
I don't know. I'm so white. I'm sorry, boys and girls. Try that.

02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:19.640
Aki Asahina.

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:21.640
Asahina? So I was kind of right.

02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:22.640
Yeah.

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:27.640
All right. And it's going to be a song called, there's also a song called Dance With Me, Tell Me More.

02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:31.640
And Tell Me More is going to be on the 2DX8 style limited edition, so.

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:33.640
Ooh, that's right, because I'm ordering that.

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.640
Yeah, so, you know, that probably gives you an indication.

02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.640
No, I'm going to have that 8 style.

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:40.760
There's a group called Guzzle that performed

02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:44.240
and they did a song called The Bottom of Same Sky and a song called

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.760
Egoist which is going to be in Poppin' Music 10 and the full version of Egoist

02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:52.320
is going to show up on the Poppin' Music 10 limited edition. So

02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:55.700
lots of fun news there for Poppin' Music 10 and

02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:58.840
2DX8 style as well. And then Sana

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:04.000
and Togo were there and they performed a song called Custom Made Girl Not For

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:04.600
Sale.

02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:07.880
That's awesome. That's the best song name ever.

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:11.440
It sounds very much like a pop music song but we don't really know which way it's

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.160
going yet.

02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:15.720
And then a song called Every Day Lovely Day which is going to be on the

02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:16.480
pop music

02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.100
10 consumer style and then a remixed version by LED

02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:24.880
is going to be in 2DX8 style. So lots of new stuff coming out on these

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:30.760
two soundtracks. Pop music 10 and 2DX8 style as well as in the games that are

02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:31.240
coming out

02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:32.240
November 18.

02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:33.240
We love LED.

02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:34.240
Yes.

02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:36.760
We love LED and groovy.

02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.920
Why does this stuff all have to come out at the same time?

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:39.920
That's the problem.

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:40.920
I got no money.

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:41.920
I'm po.

02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:44.200
Because they want to get as much money from us as possible.

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:45.560
They want to suck us dry.

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:46.620
I guess so.

02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:51.200
They want all of our money to belong to Konami of Japan.

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.200
I guess so.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.200
It's a corporate plot.

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:54.200
Conspiracy.

02:01:54.200 --> 02:02:00.560
conspiracy because you know the case that's using all the money to build a

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:08.920
giant robot they're using it to build Metal Gear hmm I don't know right okay

02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:13.640
all right gotcha ah try anything any other Bemani news

02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.360
actually I'm gonna go over to Loki since we haven't heard from him a little bit

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:20.960
and ask Loki Loki what's going on in the sim scene surely there must be something

02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:27.960
I'm sure there is. I don't know what that is. Let me look.

02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:39.960
Other than TDR Maniacs being fucking slow as hell, let's see here. I think I mentioned last week that Alpha24 came out, not that anyone cares.

02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:45.960
Why they're up to alpha 24 is beyond me, but they are.

02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:53.960
Other than that, there's a poll still going on for what characters should be ripped next.

02:02:53.960 --> 02:03:00.960
Since the 5th mix character is almost completely ripped for use with StepMania, some themes are being worked on right now.

02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:05.960
The DDR9 Red, which is obviously a rip off of 2DX Red's theme.

02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:11.960
and Trans Machina 5, which a lot of people that are out there in the Sim world know about.

02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:19.960
Also, there's of course, you know, Techno Fiend still being worked on. Really nice right now.

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:33.960
But you know, that's just basic theme stuff. DDR UK will have Ultramix Pack 6, and the DDR Extreme US tracks as soon as their downloads come back up.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:47.960
Um, the Extreme tracks I know are almost done, UltraMix Pack 6 are done, they're just waiting to be uploaded, or waiting for the, uh, whatever to be fixed, so that stuff's, um, coming, and...

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:57.960
Really, other than that, Bomani style, the remix contest, they're still judging, because some of the judges are slacking off, and so that's still going.

02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.340
So fire them!

02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:05.260
So hopefully soon, but this is why, you know, I never hold a remix contest where, I mean,

02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:09.100
I'd say I'd have like, you know, a few judges, and they'd have to be local so I could yell

02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:11.220
at them.

02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:14.620
Fire the god damn judges and set some deadlines next time!

02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:15.620
Seriously!

02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:16.680
I mean, sorry!

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.680
But, you know.

02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:21.620
Well, they also had their server thing where they got a new server recently, so, you know,

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:22.620
there was that.

02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:23.620
Alright, alright, alright.

02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:24.620
Alright.

02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:25.620
Fine, whatever.

02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:27.420
Bakers can't be choosers, I guess.

02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:29.420
Yeah, we can.

02:04:57.420 --> 02:04:59.320
Yeah. Oh, oh, now she makes O-Face.

02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:01.120
Oh, yes. I may not be here either.

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:05.320
So, we'll probably have a pre-taped show next week for you guys.

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:06.420
I think that's what we're gonna have to do.

02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:08.420
We need to go, like, to Goughland and do a show again.

02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:10.720
That's why I kinda wanna do a show from the ghetto.

02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:12.720
That means going to Scandia.

02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.720
I think that would be fun to do a show from the ghetto.

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:16.720
In the ghetto?

02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:17.720
We'll see.

02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:19.120
Alright, uh...

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:22.320
I don't know. I thought that our last one we did at Goughland was funny when they almost threw us out.

02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:24.320
That was pretty funny. I would kinda...

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:28.520
until we said, but we're promoting you.

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:31.400
That's a good idea. We could go to Golf Land and play the new StepMania machine, although

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.640
I hear it kind of sucks, and that's not Loki's fault. It's just the fact that the computer

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.640
inside sucks.

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:41.840
Well, the only way it sucks is the fact that it has a default skin with no movies, but

02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:46.520
other than that, the pads do suck, and that's not my fault at all. That's their shit, you

02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:53.380
know. I tried, hey, my original computer specifications worked very well with video and all that shit.

02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:59.060
It's just, you know what, when someone else does the job for you, it just doesn't quite come out how you wanted it.

02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:05.580
You know, I just don't care because I wasn't going to spend any more time nor money on that.

02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:17.940
However, what has come to my attention, and I plan on doing this, I have to come up with $200 though, is, um, apparently, Channel Beat's having a sale.

02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:22.500
Uh oh! And you know what that means? That means I get my

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:27.140
parts for my cabinet. Those parts being my Dance Maniac sensors.

02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:31.320
Dropped from fifty dollars a piece to now- or fifty nine dollars a piece to

02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:32.660
twenty nine dollars a piece.

02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:35.900
Awesome. So, arcade perfect

02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:39.140
Dance Maniac sensors and all the other shit.

02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:43.140
I just have to figure out if I can use those sensors or not because I don't know if it connects to an

02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:44.060
Airface board.

02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:48.200
Uh, yeah. You can always make modifications for your face. I'm sure I could get to work.

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:52.400
Even, you know, even if I just had... Break out a ballpoint pen and some, uh,

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:55.440
paper clips, you know. But, you know,

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:59.360
what I found out that's very interesting, and it does tie in with StepMania,

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:03.440
StepMania's license agreement, basically, you can

02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:07.620
take StepMania, modify it how you want, as far as

02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:11.080
theme, whatever. Put your own songs in it,

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:17.080
Create your own theme, and you can sell it. And you can make money off of it.

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:21.080
And all you have to do is just say, powered by setmania or whatever.

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:26.080
And that got me thinking, well wouldn't it be cool to make a new arcade game?

02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:30.080
Hmm, I don't know. I want to make something like Dance Maniacs.

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:33.080
I want to at least do it for, you know, my cabinet itself.

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:35.080
The waving the hands game.

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:40.080
No, I want to do something across like with Dance Maniacs and, um, what was it?

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.080
Was it like Technomotion?

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:44.080
No, not necessarily like Technomotion.

02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:52.080
Dance Maniacs and Para Para, which basically would be, it would sort of be like Para Para, but it would have top and bottom sensors in a way.

02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:54.080
Make the country line dancing game.

02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:56.080
No, not country line dancing, that's retarded.

02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:03.080
What I want to do now is I want to have infrared sensors, because you can actually do some sensors where they have different trigger points, you know, below a certain level.

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:07.040
level so I basically have like you know up to waist high or whatever that'd be

02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:10.980
one set of five sensors and then above that be another set but without those

02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:15.740
stupid you know actual things in front of you so you don't keep hitting them

02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:19.180
with your hand and then have you know cool like techno trance stuff to go with

02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:24.500
it do mocap dance and be awesome but that's what I want to do at least but

02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:29.900
who knows I just have to see because I have the only problem with the buy-off

02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:36.140
channel beat you have to spend a $200 minimum so you know I can buy the dance

02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:40.500
maniac sensors that's like going to be about you know say I buy three or no

02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:45.820
four of them that's gonna be you know good you know $120 and I still have $80

02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:48.820
left I have to spend on that so I can maybe buy another sensor and some

02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:53.860
miscellaneous crap and then you know maybe set this weird dance thing or

02:08:53.860 --> 02:09:00.860
or whatever. It's just, I don't know. I think it'd be cool, but, you know, what do I know?

02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:06.660
You could buy a turntable. I have, you can't buy turntables off there, and I would buy

02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:11.020
the turntables, the RK Perfect ones if they sold them, but they don't, and that pisses

02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:15.420
me off. I would need to, it's like, where the fuck, if something breaks on your, you

02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:20.500
know, Bimani cabinet, or whatever, where the fuck do you buy the parts that aren't listed

02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:24.000
on channel B. That's what I want to know. I think that a lot of them, you have to order

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.660
them from the Japanese distributors, like uh, like from Konami. Cause I want to like

02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:36.640
order the exact turntable parts. Rip up an arcade-style controller? No. Not worth the

02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:40.740
500 bucks you'd have to spend on it. No, not worth the 500 dollars, no fuck that. I'm still

02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:46.620
pissed off about my order, cause I had everything, I had my, my friend living in Tokyo who was

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:52.540
gonna have my arcade controller delivered to her apartment. But no, they had to reject

02:09:52.540 --> 02:10:01.540
my credit card. Thank you, Konami. Yeah, it's just, I don't know. But, I don't know. We'll

02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:05.900
just see. I just need to finish my cabinet first. I need to, I need to stop taking on

02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:10.980
extra projects. But I, see the problem is right now. Focus. I have, well I'm focusing,

02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:16.180
my fucking I-Pak's broken. My old I-Pak 2 is broken, I think, because it's been flipping

02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:22.980
out weird when I hook up the dance pads to it and so I bought a new one that's coming

02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:31.980
I pack value edition V or something like that which oddly enough has more sensors than the

02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:38.660
I pack 2 and it's USB only but that's coming this week and so once I get that then I'll

02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:42.220
be able to work on my cabinet again because I think that you need to open your gate to

02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:49.300
hell. I'm gonna do that later. I have to finish that too, but I need to get this

02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:51.860
stuff done. I want to get my cabinet stuff done because the weather is gonna

02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:55.020
be turning for the worse, and I won't be able to work on it during the winter

02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:59.120
because it's raining like a bitch, and you know, I have my wood. So what I want

02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:04.060
to do is I want to fucking sit down, get a friend to help me, and just chop up all

02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:08.260
that wood that I've got out there too. Like, you know, nice two foot by four

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:13.420
foot sections so I can actually you know finish that no we're not calling it

02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:20.140
Loki motion because that's retarded that was cute it's cute but it's retarded

02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:24.740
Loki motion Loki motion

02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:29.140
you saw my comment it's too Kylie

02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:36.220
anyways I'm done so what else we gonna talk about you get pissed off yeah I

02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:41.800
I just want to ask for a minute. What the fuck is wrong with everybody tonight and not you guys, but I'm like God

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:46.140
It's like is it something in the air is everybody on their period what is going on tonight?

02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:50.160
Like it's just like we're everything is dead tonight. It's like

02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:53.920
Are we being invaded by aliens? What is going on?

02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:59.800
Now is our show old have we jumped the shark we did not jump the shark

02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.960
Okay, if we were gonna jump the shark it would have been when we let Loki sing. I

02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:09.760
I agree.

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.000
People need to wake up. Seriously.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.200
But I'm sleepy too, Rob. I know.

02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:20.120
They're all undressing me. I'm not saying everybody's dead, but it's just like, God, I mean, seriously,

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:24.640
tonight's kind of like deader than usual. We have people in our chat room and we love and adore them.

02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:28.640
I know. We think that they're... I know just the thing to perk people up.

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.640
I know just the thing. I know just the thing.

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:32.640
Who is not convinced of tax concepts.

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.640
Rob!

02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:36.640
First of all.

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.640
That made me feel better.

02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:40.640
I swear you do the whole little schoolgirl...

02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:44.640
It's like a schoolgirl combined with Dr. Evil, but you know.

02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:48.640
It's very cute, Rob.

02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:50.640
Very cute.

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:52.640
Some people are saying that they're trying to call us

02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:54.640
and they can't get through because I'm being a bitch

02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.640
and haven't opened the Skyplane, huh?

02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:01.000
Yeah, I turned it off, but I turned it back on just now, so that's fine.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.000
If somebody wants to call us and tell us that, you know,

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.800
if someone wants to pick up the pace a little bit.

02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.960
Call us or we'll play Let Them Move. No, we will not. No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even do that.

02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.480
I would do that if like nobody was, I don't know, if I really wasn't getting

02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:16.480
something my way.

02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.480
Call 1-900-HOT.

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.360
Alright. Oh yay, we're getting a call. See, that's how it works. Hi, you're on Orange Ons Radio.

02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:27.800
Hello? Hello? Hi!

02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:34.440
I'm sorry, um, you're, if I try to turn it down on the 365, it turns everything else down.

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.520
Uh oh. So,

02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.760
see, if I mute it, then it mutes you guys. Uh oh.

02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:44.600
So I suppose maybe I should just stop it? Can you hear us okay?

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:49.440
Yeah, I can hear you guys now. Yay! Okay. Yeah, we can hear you fine. You're like one of the most clear

02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:51.240
callers we've ever had called a show.

02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:58.240
Well, I just got my headset a couple days ago, so I finally decided to call and say

02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:59.240
hello.

02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:00.240
Kudos to your internet connection.

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:01.240
Now tell us who you are.

02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:02.240
This is Rai-Chan.

02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:03.240
Hi Rai-Chan.

02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:04.240
Hi.

02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:05.240
A new caller.

02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:08.840
We don't get a lot of girls calling the show, so I'm glad that Rai-Chan could call.

02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.160
We have Misty, and I think Irene called a few a while back, but we don't get a whole

02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:13.600
lot in comparison.

02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:14.600
So what's up Rai-Chan?

02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:15.600
Oh, not a whole lot.

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.040
I tried to call you guys before, just as you guys went to the break.

02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:22.560
Oh, when we were talking about DDR Festival and quad mode and all that stuff.

02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:26.360
Yep. What was on your mind? Oh, just the whole...

02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.200
I'm one of those import only. I don't have US versions at all.

02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:35.640
Is there any reason for that? Is it just because you bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 first and then...

02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:39.040
Two years ago when my first boyfriend and I broke up.

02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:43.000
I had him, he owed me money, so I bought

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.080
a Japanese PS2 with what he owed me. Hey, you know what?

02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:50.760
inherited a third and fourth style out of a previous relationship so isn't that

02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:58.080
the best way to get new stuff? Of course. Most of my DDRs actually do come from other people.

02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:05.700
Wow! My third mix I bought for myself. My fourth my mom bought for me in exchange for doing

02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:11.880
housework. Fifth mix Jason bought for me. Sixth mix my brother got me for

02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:18.280
For Christmas, the seventh I bought for myself just before a tournament, Extreme, my second

02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:19.720
boyfriend got for me.

02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:20.720
Wow!

02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:21.720
You know what?

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:23.520
I want people to start buying me my bimani.

02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:24.720
Why do I have to buy it?

02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:27.560
Well, Loki did buy DDR Extreme, so there's that.

02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:31.680
The festival will be a gift from somebody too, whenever that finally comes.

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:32.680
Wow!

02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:34.640
That's where you have the collection Derival Mine.

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.580
Yeah, Rai-chan actually has her collection posted.

02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:41.000
Is it public on the internet somewhere, where we can see it?

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.000
It's in my LiveJournal user info, which, if you want me to take a look at it...

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Do you want to say that on the air? I don't know.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
That doesn't matter to me. Actually, I'll post a link in the chatroom.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Oh, there you go.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Either way.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.000
And you can actually take a look at Raichan's Bomani collection. It's quite impressive.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Her Bomani penis is quite large.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Well, um, I got rid of my Papa Music controller. I sold it to Angel.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.500
However, I still have seven, which I'll give to Jason, and then nine most likely I'll sell.

02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:14.000
I'll buy it from you.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.500
Okay.

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:18.500
I have a Poppa Music controller and a Poppa Music.

02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:24.500
Um, yeah. I sold my controller recently, so I still have seven and nine sitting around

02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:26.500
just because I didn't know anyone else to sell it to.

02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:28.500
I borrowed that controller too, which is funny.

02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:32.500
If you want to sell any Poppa Music you have that you want to sell, you've got to buy it right here

02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:33.500
because I need Poppa Music.

02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:35.000
Alright. Cool.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.320
Wow, boy! Not only do you get people to buy

02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.240
your new stuff for you, but you get people to buy your old shit, too. I mean,

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:48.320
God! And Jason wants me to post a picture of him and I, which I'll go find the link to.

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:53.400
Aww, he wants to be mushy. We have a picture of him and I both

02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:57.880
with our entire Bimani collections. Oh, that is so nauseatingly cute.

02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:01.560
What did you think of his chicken hat?

02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:05.560
What did you think of the chicken hat picture I took at E3?

02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:09.560
Well you saw that I used that as one of my LiveJournal user pictures.

02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:13.560
I just had to bring that up because I love that picture. We were like, you have to wear the chicken hat.

02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:17.560
Hug the cow.

02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:21.560
You need to come up and visit us next. Wait, did you and Jason actually meet

02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:25.560
through Bamani? Um, DDR Freak and LiveJournal pretty much.

02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:29.560
Wow, that's kind of cool. Look at that, DDR Freak brings people

02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:32.560
It not only tears people apart, but it brings them together as well.

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:33.560
There you go.

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:35.560
You know, the internet is a good place to meet people.

02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:40.560
I think the internet gets a bad rap sometimes. It can't be a good place to meet people.

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:41.560
I met Dan online.

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:42.560
There you go.

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:43.560
Through fandom.

02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:47.560
Anything else you want to comment on, Rychan?

02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:51.560
Not really, just calling to say hi since I finally have everything set up.

02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:54.560
Well, hello and thank you for the call and enjoy DR Festival when it comes out.

02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:58.560
Let us know how it is since none of us are probably even going to bother to get it.

02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:05.560
to be our reviewer. Okay. Alright. Thank you guys. Alright, take care. Bye. Thanks for

02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.480
the call. Oh, that was so nice. We got some comments in the chatroom that she's clearer

02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:15.320
than we are. Her microphone's better than ours. We need to know what kind of microphone

02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:20.760
she's got. Seriously. Right, Chenny, you're going to have to like send me an email. Rob

02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:24.160
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. If you ever want to send me an email, if you're a stalker fan

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:28.100
wants to send me an email, that's fine. Rob at OrangeLongeRider.com. It's a good place

02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:33.140
to go. Okay, I guess we're gonna close up the Skype line because I want to do a

02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:37.060
break because we got to come back. We have to do the FUs of the week. That's

02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:41.940
our favorite part. We got to do them. So send your FUs in now and in this break

02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:47.260
we're gonna hear some keyboard mania music. Yeah, I knew that would be the

02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:53.200
first word out of your mouth, Jamie. I love sensation. Play sensation. So it's the first thing I have

02:18:53.200 --> 02:19:00.200
queued up for ya. So here we go, a whole break of keyboard mania music. Enjoy, we'll be back.

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:26.300
.

02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:29.300
.

02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:32.400
.

02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:35.440
.

02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:38.440
.

02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:41.440
.

02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:44.480
.

02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:47.480
.

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:50.520
.

02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:46.800
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:47.800
We are back.

02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:50.000
What the hell are you laughing at over there?

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:55.580
is funny. I'm laughing at DJ Nostalgia's icon. On DJ

02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:58.520
Armaniacs, it's this little stick figure trying to pick up a flower to give it to

02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.880
the, you know, female stick figure, but the flower keeps moving so then he

02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:04.580
finally gets pissed off and kicks the flower and it hits the chick in the head

02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:14.000
and she runs off. Funny. Hilarious. That's all I have to say. Alright, well, the theme of

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.000
tonight has kind of been like being dead, I guess, because you guys have all been

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:22.760
dead so we decided we're gonna pick things up a little bit with some good

02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:27.960
old-fashioned f-u's Jamie why do we have to do some good old-fashioned f-u's

02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:32.000
anyway you're full of angst and anger and if we don't let it out will explode

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:49.040
didn't destroy half of the world.

02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:54.040
My first epi of the evening goes to the driver of this Volkswagen Passat that was in front

02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:55.040
of me.

02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.720
First of all, I normally give the thumbs up to good German engineering, but these are

02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:04.800
cars that are meant to be driven at 100 miles an hour on the Autobahn not 25

02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:11.800
miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone. Another SU goes to me for drinking so

02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:17.920
much vodka last night and you know I will say whatever is on my mind while I

02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:25.880
am drunk and I got very flirty so SU to my lack of restraint while I'm

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:40.000
while I'm intoxicated. Another F.U. goes toward this particular bit of software that I've

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:46.080
acquired that requires a certain thing to make said software work. So now I can't use

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:52.200
it. A big, humongous, whopping F.U. goes to freakin' PaintShop Pro 8 for not letting

02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:59.480
me change the size of my brush because I want to go and do little fine detailed work and

02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:04.720
go edit out backgrounds and stuff so that I can have transparencies and a stupid brush

02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:06.920
will not let me change the damn size of it.

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:09.440
Photoshop is ass, okay?

02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:14.080
I do not like Photoshop, even though I'm going to have to take a class in it, but that means

02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:17.280
that I'm going to have to go back to using PaintShop Pro 7, except PaintShop Pro 8

02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:23.820
it has some really good filters in it but um and also if you to the potential

02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:28.100
class I have to take in Photoshop even though I don't care for Photoshop all

02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:31.560
that much except it does have also really nice filters and I like the way

02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:38.500
it does layers better but and if you goes toward another thing about Paint

02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:43.060
Shop Pro 8 for not letting me freaking rotate my text in a curve the way I want

02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:48.940
too. It's doing some weird vector thing that's really pissing me off. So that means that

02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:56.940
I have to do 10 sideshow posters for Halloween by hand. I have to ink them and then color

02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:03.340
them on the computer. At least I can do some neat stuff to it and make it look cool once

02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:07.700
I have drawn it and scanned it. And at least I don't have to do some heavy shading on it

02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:11.420
either. It's all primary colors, but it's just my hand's going to be falling off. And

02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:15.560
And I have other drawings I really, really want to work on too.

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:21.840
So as it stands, I'm just going to have to, I guess, find some time.

02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:25.120
At least I've done all the homework for one of my classes, but.

02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:32.080
Oh yeah, and another F.U. toward not having my Copic markers anymore, because I finally,

02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:35.240
three of my Copic markers dried out, and that means I have to go pay another twenty bucks

02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:38.920
to get another set, so.

02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:43.560
And also just an F.U. to the Color Copics for being so damn expensive anyway.

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:49.720
I mean, true, you're paying for quality and alcohol-based ink, but, ugh, so expensive.

02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:53.200
And I'm retracting an F.U. this week to Dell.

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:57.280
Whoa, is that a first, that you're retracting an F.U.?

02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:58.280
Oh, alright.

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:02.960
Because I was all pissed off because I didn't think Dell was sending my computer, my laptop.

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:08.600
And then I got the notice yesterday, they weren't going to ship my laptop until like

02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:10.020
mid-october

02:30:10.020 --> 02:30:12.380
my laptop shipped thursday

02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:14.780
so next week i will be here with my laptop well if

02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:15.740
if i'm here next week

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.360
i'll be here with my laptop

02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:20.640
yeah we're probably not gonna be here next week but yeah we have obligations

02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:21.540
but um...

02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:23.060
regardless

02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:25.840
i'm gonna have my laptop

02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:29.600
and that will make me a happy bunny

02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:31.040
happy happy bunny

02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:32.680
a one final f u

02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:35.100
to my happy bunny t-shirt

02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:38.380
and my happy bunny t-shirt had pink fuzzy fur on it

02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:41.460
And now he looks like he's got a goatee over his belly.

02:30:41.460 --> 02:30:43.940
It's cause it's like the bottom of his mouth

02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:45.540
is like by his belly.

02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:47.980
So he looks like he's just got

02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:49.540
bad chest hair.

02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:52.820
And like the rest of them is rub all raw.

02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:55.840
Another F you goes to Rob's cell phone.

02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:59.140
It should be on silent while we're on the show.

02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:02.300
Sorry. Yeah.

02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:05.060
And that's it. I'm spent.

02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:11.060
Let's move on to Loki and see what he's pissed off about this time.

02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:15.060
Well, first off I'm gonna be pissed off at my toe because I just

02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:16.860
squeezed it really hard in this big

02:31:16.860 --> 02:31:19.160
pussy clump thing

02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:20.780
I was, but

02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:24.880
I need to let it dry out because before, you know, with a band-aid it just stays wet.

02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:26.540
I don't have any gauze.

02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:30.380
So anyways, I squeezed this big clump of whatever out because it looked like it was

02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:33.980
pussying a little bit so I was like seeing how bad it was.

02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:38.980
But it wasn't that, it was like some of the gauze that was left over from the other thing I hadn't pulled out.

02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:44.980
It was in the hole where they pulled the nail out, and that didn't feel too good.

02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:48.980
But it feels better now that it's full of Neosporin.

02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:52.980
And the other side's doing the same thing, so I think I gotta squeeze a little harder there, but that's kinda gross.

02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.980
Anyways, um, so fuck you that, cause that sucks.

02:31:55.980 --> 02:32:00.980
Um, fuck you to stupid people yesterday, I swear to God, everyone was trying to kill me.

02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:07.980
And it's because the really shitty drivers out there driving too slow, not looking when they change lanes, and just, you know, blatantly trying to kill me.

02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:10.980
So fuck you because you failed, I'm still here.

02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:17.980
Fuck you to denios for sucking. I never realized how many cell phone case booths there could be in one place.

02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:28.980
I mean, I didn't really need a cell phone case, or a new faceplate because there's tons of those faceplate booths, nor did I need any used underwear, or samurai swords! I swear to God!

02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:34.580
to god this is places like we have power tools we have bungee cords and we have samurai swords

02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:41.460
where the hell did that fit in that's just weird hey i thought i bought some korean pop speed either

02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:47.380
okay that's cool but that was the only like cool thing that was there i walked around that it's

02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:52.900
just it's not the same anymore it's like we win it around two to three o'clock i mean that is not

02:32:52.900 --> 02:32:58.900
very early but it's not late in the day I mean and there was already half the

02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:02.560
people that already packed up and left in fact they were closing the fucking

02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:07.480
you know food vending booths down at three and they closed at five like what

02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:11.620
the fuck two hours early that's a little ridiculous but whatever so they were

02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:17.400
doing that and that was really lame and wasted my time but also fuck you to

02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:21.920
shark's tail because it was kind of lame but I went and saw it for free so that

02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:27.720
wasn't that lame but it just still sucked and I it was a waste of my time

02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:36.440
and finally just you know I don't really know I have a lot more stuff earlier this

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:41.160
week and I just cannot remember it for the life of me now fuck you to goddamn

02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:46.000
roundtable today okay now I bought a personal pizza and twist their twist are

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:49.700
fucking huge if I knew they're fucking huge I would just bought the twist but

02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:53.260
not only that they didn't cook them all the way through they were damn good so I

02:33:53.260 --> 02:34:02.580
ate them all but I had to take a very bad shit when I got home so at least it

02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:06.140
felt like it it wasn't it was just you know it's just you know one of those

02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:11.180
things like urgent emergency you know that's not a feeling I want to have

02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:15.340
after you know eating at round table cuz I love round table and I was it was

02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:18.140
ironic because I was telling a story about how I used to make twists out of

02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:22.460
large pizza skin that were like a good you know three feet long when you're done with

02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:29.260
them which is awesome but i don't know they're still good though but um except for that Nephew

02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:33.820
Comedy Central we're playing Dogma yet again my god i don't like need to see that movie anymore

02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:43.500
it's just at least you have cable trust me you're not missing anything and i'm done

02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:49.500
I'm trying out a new F.U. song tonight. I don't know how it'll work, but I want something new.

02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:53.500
You're not allowed to have anything you love.

02:34:54.500 --> 02:35:03.500
I would like to give an F.U. to that person I was already giving F.U.s to earlier who just made themselves look like an ass.

02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:10.500
I want to give an F.U. to myself for having a little bit too much to drink last night

02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:13.500
and kind of forcing myself to stay in Chico until really late.

02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:16.500
Although actually I had a really good time so I have absolutely nothing to be bitching about

02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:21.500
but I need to learn to say no to drinking a lot better.

02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.500
Because I'm going to get myself in trouble some time. What?

02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:25.500
Just say no.

02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:34.500
And then I want to give an F.U. to Unnecessary Drummer and people that get off on perpetuating other people's trauma.

02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:46.500
And I really, actually I think I had like a pretty good week, all things considered, to be honest, so I don't have like a whole bunch to give F.U.s to.

02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:51.500
Oh! F you to people that make fun of my name on Ultramix.

02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:54.500
Like, I freakin' join games on Ultramix and people are like,

02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:56.500
It's Green Ski!

02:35:56.500 --> 02:36:01.500
First of all, it's Green Sky, but since you don't know how to read, I'll forgive you.

02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:05.500
But, it's just like, you know, and then I go and kick your ass.

02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:10.500
And you're like, you know, you just tell me I'm on a controller or something, even though I'm not.

02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:12.500
I'm actually on a dance pad.

02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:19.460
And um, just in general, retards. Not actual people who are actually retarded, I mean there's

02:36:19.460 --> 02:36:23.300
nothing they can do about it, but I mean people who act retarded and they have no reason to

02:36:23.300 --> 02:36:31.980
be. Is it, is it F you related? Okay, Loki has something F you related. Fuck you in the

02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:37.220
bush because you look like an idiot during the debate, that's all.

02:36:37.220 --> 02:36:41.220
What's going on, Bradley?

02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:48.220
The only thing I really have to say is fuck you to have to go another month being frugal.

02:36:48.220 --> 02:36:54.220
Even with my pay raise, I gotta pay off bills and stuff, so I can't really do very much for next month.

02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:57.220
But, oh well. That's about it.

02:36:57.220 --> 02:37:04.220
Oh, that was quick. Fair enough. Let's go to the chat room and see what our chat room has to bitch about this time.

02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:09.500
Elle Mulletz wants to say an F you to the chat room for being so dead not my fault

02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:13.780
and F you to idiots who claim you're a company fanboy for liking their games

02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:15.340
and on behalf of DarkSakura

02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:18.940
an F you to Cosmo Magazine she knows why.

02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:23.740
Oh my god that's the one I forgot? I opened up Cosmo to read the crappy

02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:27.780
sex tips they put in there because they're hilarious because you know they're not realistic at all

02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:31.700
and like I'm assaulted by what's the name of this rainbow

02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:39.700
out of the ass or something, perfume. It's beyond paradise. And it smells like beyond

02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:50.380
Hades is what it smells like. Okay, thank you. Beyond the garbage dump. Beyond fecal

02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:57.620
matter or something, I don't know. Otaku Rat says, F you to working 11 hours on 3 hours

02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:01.720
sleep

02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:05.720
uh... jazz says f you to elderly drivers

02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:09.980
for the love of god stop driving ten miles an hour and speed limit also f

02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:13.300
you to the people who plaster their cars with political stickers as anyone

02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:15.580
notices people stuck out the driving day

02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:16.220
buddy

02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:20.700
i'd put a political sticker on my car this week so if you know

02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:25.140
kerry edwards sticker

02:38:25.140 --> 02:38:29.140
My mother put a Carrie Edward sticker on my car, actually, and she put it on crooked.

02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:32.140
You know what, neither of them are worthy of my vote. I'm voting for Phil Bikat again.

02:38:32.140 --> 02:38:38.140
Well, I don't want Bush to win, and I actually kind of like Carrie, especially after the debate, so we'll see the tech.

02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:45.140
Jazz says, one more thing, F you to a certain in-the-groove step-file creator for being such an elitist bastard.

02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:48.140
Hey, where did I hear that one earlier tonight?

02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:54.480
This says f you to all computer image editor programs for not having a way of making a decent spiral

02:38:55.580 --> 02:38:58.020
Fair enough any ideas on that. I

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:02.420
Don't I haven't ever had to make a spiral so

02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:10.900
Actually, yeah, you can do one in PaintShop Pro using the the twist like you do a straight line from the center

02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:15.340
And then do the twist warp and that should work you can save it as a paintbrush

02:39:45.340 --> 02:39:50.340
It's banned from anywhere. It's good news. I just told Jamie what it was. I was doing sign language to Jamie.

02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:55.340
Oh! I have choice words that I'm not going to say.

02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:56.340
I think I've said them.

02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:58.340
She'll say them on commercial break, I'm sure.

02:39:58.340 --> 02:40:00.340
Yeah, amen, Rai-chan.

02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:11.340
Also, oh yeah, he says, oh yeah, to expand on my first one, F you to sleep, making you not do anything. I need to go shopping.

02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:15.500
You don't know how many times I've like needed to go shopping and then I

02:40:16.060 --> 02:40:19.740
I'm like I'm asleep and I don't end up shopping and then I wonder why I'm hungry

02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:26.900
DDR angel says f you to fellow students in the class that maggots maggots and I are taking almost called a maggots

02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:31.900
That was a total Tom Brokaw moment, I swear

02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:39.020
Tom Brokaw gets paid, you know a few million a year and

02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:42.620
and you don't get paid for the show?

02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:46.500
I know. F you to fellow students in the class that...

02:40:46.500 --> 02:40:50.420
I mean, I've been horribly bad on my speech tonight. I don't know how many

02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:51.980
things I've said, like where

02:40:51.980 --> 02:40:55.220
like my mind was just in like three different places and I've like

02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:58.940
ran them all together and just said things I didn't mean to say. Oh God.

02:40:58.940 --> 02:41:05.940
Angel says F you to fellow students in the class that Magus and I are taking.

02:41:05.940 --> 02:41:09.540
You asked for our help. We gave it to you. It's not our fault. You didn't get it.

02:41:09.540 --> 02:41:13.140
We never said you were stupid. Don't put words in our mouths and make us look bad

02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:17.740
when we are trying to be diligent students, just like the rest of the class. Grrr.

02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:23.740
Okay, I feel better.

02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:27.140
For a pretty dead chat room, that was a very ranty evening of FUs.

02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:31.440
I kind of am surprised. They were storing it, Rob.

02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:37.120
Yes. Alright, uh, we're gonna do some Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from break,

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:39.800
since, uh, you know, we got a few minutes left in the show, and that's how we always

02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:42.440
buy ourselves some time, is to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:45.600
Huh?

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:49.840
No, we did Elle Mullet's, like, first. No, that was CDR Angel, who was last.

02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.180
Okay. Alright. We're gonna do a break.

02:41:53.180 --> 02:41:57.040
In this break, 2DX music, because I wanna hear Love Is Dreaminess.

02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.240
So we'll be back. Actually, we'll just, you know what, we'll just make it an LED break.

02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:07.240
Hell with it. We're going to do LED music. We'll be back after this LED break. Enjoy.

02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:34.240
I'm just so full of love that I can't decide

02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:39.200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:38.240
When you're up in the middle of the road, you ain't in my life

02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:41.240
I ain't living in my life

02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:44.560
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go

02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:13.240
Here we go again!

02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:20.240
It's time to kill everybody, people!

02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:24.240
You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience.

02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:26.240
Yes, the whole Earth.

02:45:56.240 --> 02:45:58.240
Oh

02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:00.240
I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying

02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:50.240
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:55.240
Extreme Bimani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:26.080
have it? Fine by me, but I... I have a question, Rob. Okay, should I start the music first, or...

02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:29.120
Yeah, start the music. All right.

02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:38.720
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out tonight

02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:45.160
on Orange Lounge Radio? That is, if we even get any questions anyway, because

02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:50.800
Because even though people are listening, we already put them to sleep.

02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:57.800
Dear Orange Lounge, Why are we so cool?

02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:00.240
Well, because I'm here.

02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:05.840
Let's get to our first listener question.

02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:12.880
Jason himself says, Does anyone remember seeing Katamari Damacy?

02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:26.880
I've read reports about it, but I didn't see it. I just beat the game yesterday, and it's one of the greatest I've ever played. Has anyone else played it? I've never heard of this game in my entire life.

02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:27.880
I've never heard of this game.

02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:28.880
What?

02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:29.880
I've never heard of that game.

02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:54.640
p0k3smot42o

02:49:54.640 --> 02:50:01.600
that's fun I will post a link to the official website here I don't remember

02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:04.720
this game at all is it a Japanese game or is this oh no it looks like an

02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:09.040
English game it's just I was released for like 15 bucks at fries or really

02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:12.120
something like that and then sold out and it's like really cool and everything

02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:20.560
huh I've never played it though how have I never heard of this game weird that's

02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:21.560
Oh, it's Namco!

02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:22.560
Yeah, it is.

02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:24.560
Dude, anything by Namco is good.

02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:25.560
That's weird.

02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:26.560
Namco, back in the day...

02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:27.560
Why have I, like, never...

02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:29.560
I guess I'm just out of it.

02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:31.560
I'm not cool anymore is basically what it boils down to.

02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:32.560
Look at that!

02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:33.560
A giant ball of shit.

02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:34.560
Look at that.

02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:35.560
Wow.

02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:38.560
I would kill for a giant ball of shit.

02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:40.560
Let's get to more questions and some more...

02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:42.560
Not shit, but stuff.

02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:43.560
Stuff, yeah.

02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:44.560
It's a giant ball of stuff.

02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:47.560
You wouldn't really want a ball of shit rolling over you.

02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:49.560
Yeah, it would kind of suck.

02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:54.280
everything must be they're calling it a sleeper hit it's a budget sleeper hit

02:50:54.280 --> 02:51:00.360

you, but um, I want to be buff. If you can, if you can get to the track on Mondays

02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:25.720
and Wednesdays at seven o'clock, and actually I wanted to bring this up

02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:31.320
anyway, for anyone in the area who wants to work, work out, get in better shape,

02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:35.840
Anita, Dee Dee Archaholic and I are working on getting ready for the mud

02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:39.920
run at Mater Field next year, which is, they have a five mile and a two mile

02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:44.680
obstacle course and there is no way in hell I can run two miles okay I can

02:52:44.680 --> 02:52:50.280
barely run a quarter of the track but we're working on getting in shape to do

02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:54.400
the mud run next year and if you want to come work out with us you're welcome to

02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:58.560
do it and that would help build up your stamina because we're we're doing run

02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:02.560
walks on the track and running the stairs and doing sit-ups and push-ups

02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:09.680
and all kinds of stuff. You're starting a fitness club? Yeah, kind of. We were

02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:15.000
talking about doing the, doing something like Orange Lounge Fitness. That's cute.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:23.060
We really were thinking about it. Meanwhile, I'm on the DDR diet. Rule number one of Run Club.

02:53:23.060 --> 02:53:30.360
No one talks about Run Club! Sorry. Moving on with Angel's question, there's also a

02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:33.780
question for Loki here is your new remix done I didn't even know he was working

02:53:33.780 --> 02:53:39.180
on new remix yeah well okay uh what's the status of Loki remixes anything on

02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:42.820
the plate I'll reword her question I thought I was

02:53:42.820 --> 02:53:48.900
playing there was stuff being done this is news to me she was asking like I was

02:53:48.900 --> 02:53:56.140
thinking have we renamed your last remix yet oh yeah I went with my name which

02:53:56.140 --> 02:54:05.860
was. What did I name that? I think it was, was it Radical Faith, the Final Judgment mix

02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:12.060
or something like that? Yeah, I think that's what I called it. There you have it. Rob,

02:54:12.060 --> 02:54:15.820
am I allowed to use the controller when playing UltraMix against you because my converter

02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:20.340
is being buggy? Yeah, that's fine, you can play controller against me. But, here's the

02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:24.780
thing, don't fucking go picking like can't stop falling in love speed mix followed by

02:54:54.780 --> 02:55:01.500
100. Ah, damn. No, I don't want to cheat, anyway. I want to do it honestly. We'll do

02:55:01.500 --> 02:55:08.000
it honestly. Hee hee hee hee. El Mullet says, if any of you had to pick an old-school video

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:13.000
game character as your favorite of all time, who would you pick?

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.460
For what? Your favorite old-school... Oh, I'm sorry.

02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:23.080
If you had to pick an old-school video game character as your favorite of all time.

02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:30.960
The chick from the Guardian Legend. Actually, Richter Belmont from Dracula X. Just because

02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:37.120
he walks around with his, you know, Ryu haircut and his headband with a whip being all badass

02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:43.260
vampire hunter. That's kind of cool. That's kind of hot.

02:55:43.260 --> 02:55:50.620
I would have to say either the Dark Queen from Battletoads or Chun-Li.

02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:53.720
Super Joe.

02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:54.720
Super Joe.

02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:55.720
Bionic Commando.

02:55:55.720 --> 02:56:04.140
Dude, that's cool, because you blow up Hitler at the end of that game, only it's not Hitler.

02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:09.080
Or um, like a random Mega Man 2 boss, because the Mega Man bosses are cool.

02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:12.280
You would so be uh, Quick Man.

02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:17.740
There is no Rainbow Man, go to hell.

02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:22.580
Alright Misty, I want to know what the hell happened to episode 111, did you delete it

02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:23.580
or something?

02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:25.180
I've been looking forward to hearing it on Rewind Pout.

02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:26.660
I've never recorded it.

02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:29.060
No, that's 112 that never got recorded.

02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:36.660
Actually 112 is gone, but there was a small mistake that happened this week where something

02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:41.060
got updated and didn't get saved, which caused you to hear the same episode for the third

02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:42.060
week in a row.

02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:43.940
And I apologize for that.

02:56:43.940 --> 02:56:44.940
But you know what?

02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:47.180
We have a suggestion for you in the chatroom.

02:56:47.180 --> 02:56:54.180
right 2000 said you should be hard man

02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:59.420
everyday

02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:04.000
episode 111 exists and in fact to prove it I will play a random moment

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:07.780
from episode 111 here's a random moment from episode 111

02:57:07.780 --> 02:57:09.460
I'll bash bin Laden

02:57:09.460 --> 02:57:10.260
god damn

02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:12.660
bush family forgive him bin Laden

02:57:12.660 --> 02:57:16.900
president bush should be killed his entire family if it wasn't for them Osama wouldn't live

02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:21.420
wonderful a dark child moment just what I wanted that had nothing to do with

02:57:21.420 --> 02:57:28.660
video games at all what the hell's wrong with our show we need the random episode

02:57:28.660 --> 02:57:34.220
clip button just like Conan has the random you know clips of Walker Texas

02:57:34.220 --> 02:57:42.420
Ranger we need to have we need to do that I'm not going through old episodes

02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:45.720
Alright, fine. Here's another random clip of episode 111.

02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:48.520
Other stuff? I was kind of surprised.

02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:54.320
One vote over Echo Image, and one vote over, or I'm sorry, two votes over DM Ashura.

02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:56.620
It was a very, very close cage match tonight.

02:57:56.620 --> 02:57:59.420
What the hell was I talking about? Tune in Thursday to find out!

02:57:59.420 --> 02:58:00.620
Cage match!

02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:02.620
No, we know it's a cage match.

02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:04.620
Alright.

02:58:04.620 --> 02:58:09.620
So the episode exists, I just suck.

02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:11.620
Alright.

02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:13.460
and uh...

02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:16.100
that's it that's all the questions we got that's fine because it's time to

02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:19.220
wrap up the show so we're gonna close the old uh... orange lounge radio mail

02:58:19.220 --> 02:58:24.620
bag

02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:26.060
and i was a close in the back

02:58:26.060 --> 02:58:29.300
or do we ever check the email the old school yahoo email

02:58:29.300 --> 02:58:32.700
uh... i'd check it i'd check it once in a great while

02:58:32.700 --> 02:58:39.700
but i'll open it up right now

02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:42.700
Like an F-you for something Loki said.

02:58:42.700 --> 02:58:47.700
Uh, let's see what messages we got. We said, uh, good news, weight loss, 14% reduction of fat.

02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:49.700
Have bigger cock.

02:58:49.700 --> 02:58:53.700
Uh, something makes me cry when I am moved.

02:58:53.700 --> 02:58:58.700
And, uh, another one that says happy face. My sister used to tell me life is full of happiness.

02:58:58.700 --> 02:59:00.700
Awww.

02:59:00.700 --> 02:59:02.700
Nothing in the goddamn email.

02:59:02.700 --> 02:59:04.700
You didn't even get a penis enlargement now?

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:08.700
I want to know what it is. Something makes me cry when I am moved.

02:59:08.700 --> 02:59:10.700
An answer worthy of your acceptance.

02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:12.700
I guess it's a...

02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:18.700
Look at this, they have to put all these dashes in here and stuff so the spam filters don't get it.

02:59:18.700 --> 02:59:21.700
Why do you people bother? That's what I want to know.

02:59:22.700 --> 02:59:23.700
I was reading some...

02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:25.700
Of course since I clicked it they'll probably send me a million emails now.

02:59:25.700 --> 02:59:27.700
I was reading some web comic, Rob.

02:59:29.700 --> 02:59:33.700
I don't remember which one it was, the someone accepting spam mail because they hate the world.

02:59:34.700 --> 02:59:35.700
And want more to come.

02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:42.700
more to come. That was completely random. I'm gonna go ship my laundry. Alright, sounds

02:59:43.180 --> 02:59:46.300
good actually. Well, we're gonna wrap up the show. Come back, come back, come back. Cause

02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:53.300
you have to give us your final thought. Okay. Do it. Final thought. But you can't hear my

02:59:53.740 --> 02:59:59.560
thoughts. None of you are, none of you are psycho and have ESPN. Then just tell them

02:59:59.560 --> 03:00:04.700
to tune in Tuesday since we didn't do the vlog. Yes, I do a radio show on Tuesday. I

03:00:04.700 --> 03:00:22.300
I do pump up the volume on Tuesday night if you tune in at 7 o'clock, sometimes a little

03:00:22.300 --> 03:00:29.180
bit earlier. You can listen to the pre-show, 730 starts the real show. It's supposed to

03:00:29.180 --> 03:00:32.940
be a request show, but that doesn't really happen all that much anymore. People, you

03:00:32.940 --> 03:00:37.260
to make requests. So it said I choose to marathon things and the marathon for this week will

03:00:37.260 --> 03:00:43.320
be Rammstein. And then I'm probably going to throw in like old video game music because

03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:48.780
I feel like it. So tune in. You know, if I get bored again like I did last week I'll

03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:55.220
go till midnight because I played Eddie Izzard and a bunch of other stuff afterwards. Last

03:00:55.220 --> 03:01:00.580
week, no last week actually was the 80s marathon which I actually do those every couple months.

03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:04.580
Be thinking of what you want to listen to though, I'll play whatever.

03:01:04.580 --> 03:01:14.580
If you are part of our LiveJournal community, the Orange Lounge LiveJournal, you can also put in there things that you'd like to hear on the show.

03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:20.580
Alright. Let's see. Loki, your final thought?

03:01:20.580 --> 03:01:34.580
Uh, my final thought was, I was thinking of weird things to make remixes of earlier today, and one of the things I downloaded, which I gotta mess around with because I think it'd be funny, is to make a dance remix of the Shaft theme.

03:01:34.580 --> 03:01:35.580
Dude, that'd be-

03:01:35.580 --> 03:01:38.080
I don't know if that would work, but it's just something to play with.

03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:43.080
I was just downloading random white label remixes and stuff and that was just kind of fun.

03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:51.080
Just because I was waiting for my Simple Minds Don't You Forget About Me remixes to download.

03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:55.080
Do you ever use your record player anymore?

03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:57.580
No, but oddly enough I still buy records.

03:01:57.580 --> 03:02:01.580
I got you a record. I got you, what was that group? Guitar?

03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:02.580
Wolf.

03:02:02.580 --> 03:02:03.580
Guitar Wolf.

03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:22.580
Yeah, I have a bunch of records. I need to go through my big pile of mid-90s R&B, and I need to figure out what I want to keep and what I want to get rid of, because I'm trying to, like, take that big pile I have that's just sitting there, probably getting warped, because, you know, I have stuff on top of the records, and I need to, like, throw a ton of shit away.

03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:30.580
I have one record now. One left. All my other ones are in Alabama, but Dan and I actually bought Weird Al's Even Worse on vinyl.

03:02:30.580 --> 03:02:34.180
Well, I need to like just because there's a lot of records out there

03:02:34.180 --> 03:02:38.820
I need to figure out how to mix on vinyl and once I do that then I'll be before probably more

03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:44.440
Opted to play with the records and stuff. It's just it's hard because I don't know my record selection very well

03:02:44.460 --> 03:02:50.260
That's why I need to like lower it. So I you know, I can you know know what songs mix well together

03:02:52.020 --> 03:02:54.780
It's just it's hard. I don't even know how I would date it

03:02:54.780 --> 03:02:58.580
You know, I just need to know how to learn how to mix that's pretty much what I need to do

03:02:58.580 --> 03:03:02.580
I can do parties, you know, where you just crossfade shit over. That's- that's a piece of cake.

03:03:02.580 --> 03:03:08.580
But it's a matter of, like, you know, being an actual true DJ and being able to beatmatch and stuff and mix that way.

03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:13.580
That's a little different than being a wedding DJ where you just play 80s shit and crossfade over.

03:03:13.580 --> 03:03:17.580
Oh my god, this is the sequel to the wedding singers, the wedding DJ.

03:03:18.580 --> 03:03:23.580
Like, seriously, I could- I could DJ, like, really shitty, like, adult parties and stuff, you know?

03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:32.580
But, like, you know, I can't really, you know, actually be able to do, you know, cool professional DJ stuff. Like, and mix shit together.

03:03:32.580 --> 03:03:41.580
Right now I have a program that helps me with that, you know. Because I can do it visually, but I can't do it audio. So, that's a problem.

03:03:41.580 --> 03:03:45.580
Anyways. That's my final thought.

03:03:45.580 --> 03:03:48.580
Uh, Bradley, you have a final thought?

03:03:48.580 --> 03:03:54.580
Since I don't have very much to say, I'll just read random words from the posters on the wall.

03:03:54.580 --> 03:03:57.580
Redundant, nicer, yummy, pin-up, action.

03:03:57.580 --> 03:04:03.580
Very nice. And my final thought is, I'm trying to keep this short because I have somewhere else to be right now.

03:04:03.580 --> 03:04:09.580
So, thank you very much for listening, everybody. Have a great night. Final word of the show. Jamie, you always want it, so there you go.

03:04:09.580 --> 03:04:13.580
My final word of the show is vodka.

03:04:13.580 --> 03:04:19.580
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:24.580

03:05:02.580 --> 03:05:06.580
Never due to these guys

03:05:06.580 --> 03:05:10.580
They've made them so violent

03:05:10.580 --> 03:05:16.580
Ooh, but you know I'm yours

03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:22.580
Ooh, and I know you're mine

03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:29.580
And that's for all time

03:05:29.580 --> 03:05:42.580
Oh, ee, oh, I look just like Buddy Holly Oh, oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore

03:05:42.580 --> 03:05:48.580
I don't care what they say about us anyway

03:05:48.580 --> 03:05:57.580
I don't care about that.

03:05:57.580 --> 03:06:17.260
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:06:27.580 --> 03:06:56.620
Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, in progress.

03:06:56.620 --> 03:07:01.360
I'm trying to queue up a post-show so I'm gonna give the mic to Loki and give him the responsibility of filling up a post-show

03:07:03.020 --> 03:07:05.420
Filling up a post-show god damn it

03:07:07.900 --> 03:07:09.900
Well shit

03:07:10.100 --> 03:07:13.800
Well what I've been doing lately is I've been downloading some music

03:07:14.140 --> 03:07:18.660
Cuz you know I I did buy stuff. Yeah, I bought I bought music

03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:23.380
But um anyways, this is one of the songs that I bought the other day

03:07:23.380 --> 03:07:33.380
So we're just gonna kill time by playing a BT song because it'll be fun. And everybody loves BT. BT rocks.

03:07:33.380 --> 03:07:39.380
So this one right here will be a possible cage match winner a little later.

03:07:39.380 --> 03:07:45.060

03:07:45.060 --> 03:07:51.060
those who don't know, that's just like short radio edits. But here's Loving You More, BT

03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:58.820
starring Vincent, uh, Vincent, uh, Cavello. Enjoy. A little bit different from BT. Oh,

03:07:58.820 --> 03:08:02.980

03:08:02.980 --> 03:08:07.780
Crystal Method, Keep Hope Alive, BT's Create A Tin Method mix, and we're gonna play a little

03:08:07.780 --> 03:08:14.780
bit of that because that's seven minutes long and we don't need to play the whole thing.

03:08:37.780 --> 03:08:39.780
Oh

03:09:07.780 --> 03:09:09.780

Let us stop the dead men's hope Let us stop the dead men's hope

03:10:37.780 --> 03:10:38.280
Oh!

03:11:07.780 --> 03:11:37.400
and that was fun yes it was I have kind of a special treat

03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:41.260
for you guys tonight for some real post show music. We're actually going to be doing a

03:11:41.260 --> 03:11:50.720
whole bunch of music for my personal MP3 collection. That should be fun, right? Right? Say yes.

03:11:50.720 --> 03:11:54.140
Because everybody loves my taste of music. No, but there's a lot of fun stuff in here,

03:11:54.140 --> 03:11:58.160
so I hope you guys enjoy it. I'm still trying to get like the last few songs in here, but

03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:03.220
I did want to say, definitely keep checking out our website over at www.orangelaundrator.com.

03:12:03.220 --> 03:12:08.580
Next week's show, very good chance that it's going to be taped next week because some of

03:12:08.580 --> 03:12:12.860
us have other things we are already committed to for next weekend, so we're not going to

03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:16.380
be able to probably be here live on Sunday night, so we'll probably have some kind of

03:12:16.380 --> 03:12:18.060
tape show going on.

03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:20.060
Look for details on our website.

03:12:20.060 --> 03:12:26.140
Also, I forgot to mention this during the show, but that Akira Yomoka contest, we're

03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:29.500
going to have to delay another week because there's some stuff going on.

03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:32.620
We have to, we just want to make sure we do the damn thing right.

03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:36.220
So uh, we need to delay for another week, so sorry guys.

03:12:36.220 --> 03:12:38.420
And um, that's about it.

03:12:38.420 --> 03:12:42.620
All the details on that will be coming to the website very soon as well, and uh, that's

03:12:42.620 --> 03:12:44.100
going to be very cool.

03:12:44.100 --> 03:12:47.900
And um, yes, Loki.

03:12:47.900 --> 03:12:54.860
And soon, or maybe a little later on, we will be doing more contests and more giveaways.

03:12:54.860 --> 03:12:56.740
The prize being anime movies.

03:12:56.740 --> 03:12:57.740
Why?

03:12:57.740 --> 03:13:01.140
Because I have like fucking ten plus cases of anime movies in my closet that you need

03:13:01.140 --> 03:13:06.500
to get rid of. And that's a lot of anime. And I have, like, another two cases at work.

03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:13.660
So, um, there'll be, uh, anime giveaways. Ah, ha ha ha, she watches a book and matches.

03:13:13.660 --> 03:13:19.460
But, yeah, that'll be, uh, we'll figure out some stuff with that later. Maybe, uh, I don't

03:13:19.460 --> 03:13:25.560
know, we'll figure stuff out. So, yeah, too bad I don't have any more porn to give away.

03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:26.560
That I don't have.

03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:31.560
Remember your Make Edit Get Porn contest? That was like the best thing ever.

03:13:56.560 --> 03:14:00.920
uh... but make it a good point that was a contest that was wonderful uh...

03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:02.580
what do you something similar like that

03:14:02.580 --> 03:14:04.520

I don't want to work on this.

03:14:57.380 --> 03:15:00.020

Make remix, get porn.

03:15:03.260 --> 03:15:10.000
