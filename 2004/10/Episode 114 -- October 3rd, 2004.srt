You're tuned in to the Internet's most diverse radio station of all things, Beyamani.

23
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,900
My name is Rob Roberts.

24
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,040
You might know me as Sky.

25
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,980
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

26
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,980
farm.

27
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,980
Say hello to Ms. Jamie Summers, you know her better, Stark's background.

28
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,980
You know what? When you were trying to think of a description, you don't want to know the things that just went through my head.

29
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,980
What went through your head? I want to know.

30
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
You know what went through my head?

31
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,980
Nerves, blood, brain matter, that went through my head.

32
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,980
Oh my!

33
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,980
And in that corner, futzing with our webcam or something, our tech master, Loki.

34
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,040
I am busting as you call it with the webcam.

35
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,720
We actually have an extra special treat for our listeners tonight.

36
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,120
We have a brand new web cam angle just for tonight because it's only the three of us

37
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,960
so there's no guests to focus on.

38
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,760
So you get to see Loki and me this time on the web cam the whole show and our really

39
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,160
dirty work area which I'm almost embarrassed to have on the cam but I don't care.

40
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Let the world know.

41
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
I don't care.

42
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,160
my feet on the webcam anymore you could you could still get oh we do have a

43
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,320
guest after all oh that's all right we'll keep the webcam angle this way

44
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:01,400
that's right say hello to Arcadian 42 Bradley just showed up all right oh we

45
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,520
appreciate Arcadian's presence even though we did think we were gonna have

46
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,720
a guest free show but that's all right all right well we certainly have some

47
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,880
bimonos to talk about tonight believe it or not and randomness I assure you

48
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,640
there's plenty of randomness tonight you okay yes Jamie is starting off the show

49
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,200
in her traditional manner by eating I totally forked out for tonight's show I

50
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,040

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,480
them and half a double bag I had skinny crust pizza from round table not not

52
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,640
that I'm on a diet or anything I just really like the skinny crust pizza like

53
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,200
I like New York pizza which is pretty much very similar very skinny crust

54
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,320
god Loki's gonna kill himself trying to rig the webcam really certain death you

58
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,360
because Extreme was the big news last week we even have some news we kind of

59
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,640
missed that I want to get to and I know I want to get pissed off at some point

60
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,080

70
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,880
there with a keyboard in her lap the whole time ever since Loki got that

71
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
wireless keyboard.

72
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Dude, this thing is awesome.

73
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Okay.

74
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
I just can be the babysitter all night.

75
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,380
That's so cool.

76
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,520
So come be, come be disciplined by Dark Sakura in our channel.

77
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,400
You know you want it.

78
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,160
It's just like you said in the very first episode of Orange on the Radio, I'll never

79
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,600
forget this, is that you were ranting about parents at Golfland and you said, I remember

80
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,640
the quote, you said something like, if you're not going to do your job, god damn it, I will.

81
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,640
The parents don't want me to do their job.

82
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
I would be a scary mom.

83
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Alright.

84
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Also, we've got the new Ultra Mix 2 song.

85
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
We'll play that for you at some point tonight.

86
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
And it's a previous Cage Match winner.

87
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,640
I believe it was picked by Dark Sakura.

88
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Huh?

89
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute.

90
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,080
all right we'll be back

91
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
The mic will sing soon as I touch it

92
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,140
Dude, it's smooth and easy like

93
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,140
So we might get hyped to hear tonight

94
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Be nice, relax, and see from the back

95
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,640
If you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap

96
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
That can smack this mouth whoops if they jack

97
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,140
You're gonna suck no crap

98
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,140
Giving a little bit of heart and soul as we do it

99
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,140
Till you in your ear hole, huh

100
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,140
I ain't going out like a sucker

101
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,140
And if you think so, poison pucker up

102
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,640
And chip the butter that's lyricist

103
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,140
Blow the mic word up this groove

104
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,640
That can soothe you

105
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Now it's time to do it!

106
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Every woman, every man

107
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:48,640
We can jam, we can jam, we can jam now

108
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Don't try to stop me, don't wait up and go Don't block me, don't block me, don't try

109
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,640
to stop me Don't wait up and go, don't block me

110
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Carving like a nutcracker crushes a nut This is the vibe before my rifle when I'm

111
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
on the cut I'm sitting in your memory like a date of

112
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
your birth Back then you're like Gatorade when I'm

113
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
quitching my girls I'm the back of the ladder and you're the

114
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
fable I'll cut you like my DJ cuts a record on the

115
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
table I wanna rock you, I wanna rock you

116
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,780
I'll cut you like my DJ cuts a record on the table

117
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,160
I wanna rock, get off the battleground

118
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,200
You're no Max but a God if I could beat you down

119
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,160
Crack a soul, I put you in a muggle

120
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,260
I'll break it in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle

121
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,880
I'll rip your rhymes then I'll murder your style

122
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm the one doing the slam, yeah, your artyle

123
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm confessing, arranging, putting it all in place

124
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,760
Form a line, suck a... so you can bleed your cake

125
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,780
I wanna rock, rock

126
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,600
I wanna rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock

127
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
Don't kick, don't rock me

128
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,740
Don't try to stop me

129
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,040
Don't wait up, baby, yo

130
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Don't clock me to beat

131
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:37,800
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on the air.

132
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,800
And, uh, whatever happened to Step Squad? I haven't heard you talk about them in a while, Jamie.

133
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,800
I haven't heard, hardly heard from anybody lately. It's just, I, you know, I've been so busy that it's hard to keep up with anyone.

134
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,800
You have to explain what Step Squad, because we have a lot of new people that only started listening a couple months ago and we started giving, you know, exclusive hints and stuff.

135
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Now people start listening to us, so explain for those that don't know what Step Squad is all about.

136
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:12,800
StepSquad was established to sort of combat some of the, I guess, more negative aspects of the whole DDR team business that was going on.

137
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Especially just people who were...

138
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Owned Stu!

139
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Owned Stu more!

140
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I pwn you.

141
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Pwned!

142
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,800
That sounds so stupid.

143
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Anyway, um...

144
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Did I put it back on Bradley?

145
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
He said no.

146
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:40,800
It was more or less just an attempt to show some of the more positive aspects or group of people who would, I guess, embody those type of...

147
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
What the hell are you doing?

148
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
God.

149
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Anyway, it was supposed to be more or less the whole positive aspect of what a DDR community could be like.

150
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,960
Anyway, um, I haven't hardly, though, heard from anybody, because we're all busy, busy

151
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:07,560
people, and I'm going to school, and having no life, and, okay, that cover is scaring

152
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
me.

153
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,520
That's, okay, everybody needs to go onto orangeongeradio.com and look at the webcam, because-

154
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,320
I can't see it, it's dark.

155
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
I said it's dark.

156
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Stupid cam.

157
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Stupid eye toy.

158
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,660
it's fucking uploading fine it's just something on the website and that's all

159
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,880

160
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480

161
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,080

162
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,800
finished the damn thing yet it's all of the energy that you're putting into it

163
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,480
while you're making it yours what the hell's wrong my computer on your monitor

164
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,980
My god damn monitor sucks.

165
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,480
Yes it does.

166
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,980
I know.

167
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,480
Hey, I can't go up any higher.

168
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Uh, how to fix that?

169
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
You need to get a new monitor.

170
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
I don't need to get a new monitor, I just need to turn the gamma up.

171
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,980
Degas it.

172
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Oh, fine, I'll do it anyways.

173
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,480
That's fun.

174
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,980
Okay.

175
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,480
You were talking?

176
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,480
I- I know I was paying attention, so I just stopped.

177
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,020
It was about Step Squad and how cool we are.

178
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,220
Give me the damn mic.

179
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,380
Damn, he's like hoarding the mic over here. I'm not gonna let Rob have it. We can't have a show tonight.

180
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,980
No, Rob, you don't get to talk. Alright.

181
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,940
We're gonna get duct tape for you. Yeah. Anyway, I have to tease

182
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,420
something. I'm gonna tease something. We have a sequel

183
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,980
to a classic Orange Lounge Radio inside joke coming up.

184
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,260
a sequel. We are all about the inside jokes. Yes, remember, sequels, they always have a bigger

185
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,900
budget

186
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,700
and they're always much better. Just kidding, they're actually always a lot worse.

187
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,300
The third one usually ends up better. Yeah. Well, we do have the sequel

188
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,500
in a minute. After, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, of course, the way we start off

189
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,900
all episodes of Warren's Laundrio. Dark Sakura, How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

190
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,020
My week consisted of work and school

191
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,380
because, guess what, I have no life.

192
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,380
All I do is go to work and all I do is go to school and go to the track and go to the gym.

193
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:26,380
I went to spin and I was so happy because I was so pissed off and mad at the world on Friday that I went to spin and had a fun time.

194
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Worked out all that aggression.

195
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,380
But nothing really major happened this week.

196
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,380
I'm getting Sims 2, which is going to make me happy and I'll have even less free time.

197
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:50,460
I'm also training somebody at work and I've got a few actually a few more

198
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:59,740
changes in mind in my chosen field. Different things at work going on. I'm not

199
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,860
really going to go into too much detail about it but there there may be some

200
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,740
changes a foot the next couple of months all right I went to a party last night

201
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,420
you know me I'm such the party girl who but I ended up because I was just gonna

202
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:21,180
go hang out and do whatever was the occasion random just random party it was

203
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,060
like oh my god we're bored let's have a party all right it works but I had I was

204
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:32,740
over at an iguana girls house and oh my god moo is female we didn't know what

205
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,980
gender moo was because iguanas take a year oh I was like who the hell's moo

206
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,540
moo is her iguana okay but moo is now in the big cage and moo is very happy and cute and

207
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,100
female okay which is going to be fun when she starts laying eggs because they

208
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:55,100
lay eggs like chickens anyway I decided that because everybody was having to oh

209
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,980
my god that was so creepy what the webcam he had it pointed down the hall

210
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:06,140
it turned red it made me think of Silent Hill 4. That's what I was saying. I just decided

211
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:17,900
that I was going to participate and you know not be a pooper so I had 12 jello shots. Remember

212
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,020
kids Orange Lawn's radio wants you to drink responsibly. I didn't drive. I called Dan

213
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,040
and... Oh well you didn't. See that's the classic double standard I love about this

214
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,360
culture it's always you know be sure that if you drive you drink responsibly

215
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,960
now if you didn't drive get fucked up nobody cares you just get fucked up it's

216
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,960
your liver once you got your keys in the bowl you can get fucked up my keys are

217
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,320
in my purse I knew better but I ended up having 12 jello shots because it was all

218
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:55,360
low carb stuff so vodka is low carb so I had we had it with the sugar-free jello

219
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,620
so I had 12 of them. Because I have this thing for vodka, I don't feel it until after I'm

220
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:09,900
done with it. Um, I also had a couple glasses of this cranberry vodka beverage, and then

221
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:18,820
this cranberry and orange liqueur beverage, and something else, and lots of meat. I was

222
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:27,860
in happy boos meet heaven what that is so like a quintessential quote for you

223
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:35,820
now I was in happy boos meet heaven okay please somebody note the date and time

224
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,780

226
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:53,080
next intro thank you anyway I also put some more thought into my I'm actually

227
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,500
one of my classes I finished all the homework for I'm very happy another one

228
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,300
I have one more week of assignments and I'm done with that class hallelujah

229
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,680
praise the Lord no more databases I spent four hours freaking working on a

230
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,580
database today it's such ease well I was also chatting with people too which I

231
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,620
thought was more important than doing my homework but that was that was really it

232
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,620
I'm gonna go ahead and try to get the other one done Thursday ahead of time

233
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,140
just go ahead and get it out of the way stop putting it off although

234
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:33,620
procrastination is pretty fun anyway that was my week my day oh yeah I passed

235
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,220
out at 1130 and woke up at 630 in the morning and guess what you sound like me

236
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,400
at a party no I I just I just decided I was randomly sleepy and I just played I

237
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,680
just I mean I actually did consciously go to bed and then next thing I know it's

238
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,960
six in the morning I am wide awake and not hungover see I don't think I would

239
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,000
even drink so we should have went to church today

240
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
bite me

241
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,880
Excuse me. I don't know

242
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
but no, I

243
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
I ended up

244
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,280
wide awake not in the least hungover and

245
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Then I that's when I ate that chocolate

246
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,720
it I see I don't think that I would have I think that I would not drink as

247
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,880
Wildly as I do on the rare times that I do

248
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Because I don't have any

249
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Consequences other than my liver going, whoo, alcohol.

250
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,720
I just don't get hungover.

251
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,720
Coming from a long line of beer drinking.

252
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
You know. Not me, I don't like beer.

253
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Oh my god, somebody else talk. I'm tired.

254
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Alright, fine. We'll move on to somebody else's weekend day.

255
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,720
How was your week? How was your day?

256
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,640
still a little better now my toe is kind of ugly looking and although I do think

257
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,880
that somehow there's like an infection under my cuticle because it's still kind

258
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:14,260
of poofy and a little bit of pussy and so yeah probably to do that but I mean

259
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,120
other than that no it doesn't really hurt my other toe hurts now though

260
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,520
because the nails kind of long on it and I just accidentally kicked into the desk

261
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:43,520
And that's not fun. But no, this week I saw a ton of movies. I saw Shark's Tale, because it was free, and that was okay. And then I saw The Forgotten, which, if anyone's seen the trailer, you know what the movie's about. Literally, you know what the movie's about. You've already seen the entire story of the movie.

262
00:22:43,520 --> 00:23:00,520
And then I watched Ju-On, which is, for those who don't know it, the Japanese version of the movie coming out called The Grudge, and if you've seen that movie, then you've seen The Grudge already, because it's pretty much, from what I've seen in the trailers, exactly the same shots.

263
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:10,520
You know what? I have to say something about that. Now, the trailer for Ringu and The Ring had all the same identical scenes, and there was a lot different about movies.

264
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Well, the only thing that's going to be different, I think, is one, it's probably going to be linear, because Ju-On was fucking hard to follow.

265
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
I just kept skipping around, I was like, what the hell?

266
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
That's just Japanese cinnamon.

267
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
What the hell is going on here?

268
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,520
But, um, my only complaint about it is, how can people be that dumb to walk into a haunted house, like, constantly?

269
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,520
They're like, yeah, so we know that every single person that's gone through this house has disappeared, so I'm going to go inside that house!

270
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Save on the, uh, tax.

271
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:56,520
And then at the very end of the movie they like show something that's kinda, I guess would be like a way to ward off whatever it is, and then like not even 30 seconds later another ghost comes, and the woman doesn't do the thing that ward off the first one, and then she disappears.

272
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,440
it's like oh how can you not see that famous then I watched battlefield

273
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,240
baseball which is fucking awesome it's like Shaolin soccer it's like Shaolin

274
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,920
soccer with baseball but it's crazy because the one the main character

275
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,080
doesn't play baseball anymore because he killed his father with his fast pitch it

276
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,080
was so fast they went through him and killed him and then they sung a song

277
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,200
about it that was the best thing the best thing ever but it's great though

278
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,040
because there's like people that are getting impaled on shit and just like

279
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,140
there's like this whole team that looked like they're full of zombies or whatever

280
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,160
but they're not they're just these really weird people and this guy that

281
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,240
looks like the mask with or he looks like an Australian version of the mask

282
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,580
he's on the other team was like the head coach and there's this I mean all these

283
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,200
people keep getting killed oh there's this one guy keeps getting killed

284
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,080
throughout the movie and every time he comes back as a different person with

285
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:00,360
the same haircut it's just quite weird but um so that was a cool movie and then

286
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:07,480
other than that I got um I played my Final Fantasy and I bought some new CDs

287
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:15,440
I bought Stephen Lynch's CD and he's funny and then BT 10 years in the was

288
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,360
it was like 10 years, oh 10 years in the life and that was like a compilation of

289
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,740
his best works plus some new stuff I haven't heard of BT and remixes they did

290
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:34,760
including crystal method remix they did and that was kind of cool and other than

291
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,200
that really not all that much went on just a little bit movies and hobbling

292
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,960
and still didn't finish the device working on it oh I got Sims 2 and I was

293
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,200
torturing Sims that was fun the only thing about that game though is that it

294
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,520
has really slow fires like I started a fire in my kitchen it took it about two

295
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,560
days to finally get across the kitchen because you know it's cool because you

296
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,120
know the fire department can't come even though I have smoke detectors because I

297
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,840
have a motor on my house and there's no way in or out but if you're interested

298
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:17,800
what I thought about The Sims 2, you can check out my review on OrangeZoundsRadio.com, which

299
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:23,240
we have reviews for other games on there too. Yeah, actually Jason and I are talking about

300
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,120
plans to try and expand the review section a little later too, because I want to do a

301
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,640
full review of DDR Extreme, although I am going to have a mini review of DDR Extreme

302
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,200
showing up in the very near future somewhere else, so maybe we'll talk about that later,

303
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I don't know.

304
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Anything else you want to share about your weekend today?

305
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I don't think so.

306
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
No, that's it.

307
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Alright, Bradley, how was your week?

308
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
How was your day?

309
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
It was pretty boring.

310
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
It worked.

311
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I finally submitted my last thing for temp work, so now I'm permanent in the company,

312
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
finally.

313
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Woohoo!

314
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Yay.

315
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Clap, clap, clap.

316
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Then Wednesday I listened to the debate mostly because it was like the first time I turned on my TV to actually watch TV in like 33 months.

317
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
And it was on every channel.

318
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
What?

319
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
And it was on every channel.

320
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Something like that.

321
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Well it was like behind me and I was listening to it while I was playing on the computer.

322
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
And then after that, not much. This weekend didn't do very much.

323
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Did my state taxes, oh boy.

324
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Woohoo!

325
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,240
because you can wait like till October if you don't owe anything

326
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,840
and that's about it. Right on.

327
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,120
Exciting. My week and my day.

328
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,240
Like Jamie I was kind of a party animal this weekend. I went to a party

329
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,160
Friday night. My friend John had a birthday so I went over to his house for a

330
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,840
birthday party and I went with a bunch of my friends.

331
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,000
Unfortunately I didn't really get a chance to drink a whole lot. I did like a shot or two

332
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,080
but I didn't get quite

333
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,560
as comfortable as Jamie did at the party she went to.

334
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,560
But it was a good time. I met a lot of really nice new people.

335
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,560
I met this one girl who was really into anime.

336
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,560
She seemed like she'd be somebody who might like this show, so...

337
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Hopefully I remembered to plug the show with her, but I don't remember.

338
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Anyway, and just, you know, a lot of cool people there,

339
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,560
and we just had a good time, laughing, hanging out.

340
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,560
And then, yesterday, I actually decided to drive to my old hometown.

341
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,560
I lived there for three years, where I went to school in Chico, California,

342
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,500
north about about an hour and a half north of Sacramento where this show is

343
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,720
based which is a little college town there really isn't anything in Chico

344
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,980
California except a college and retired people so it's this interesting mix of

345
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,940
people but I had I had myself a good time I never really enjoyed the place

346
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,940
while I lived there but now that I'm just a visitor I actually have a lot of

347
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,580
fun every time I go I went to this bar and I actually got a little drunk which

348
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,940
wasn't a good idea since I had driven so I had to like wait around so like

349
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:03,900
to 3 a.m. so I could sober up. But we went to this bar and I just danced like crazy.

350
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,380
I don't know what it was, I was just totally dancing like crazy, like flailing my arms

351
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,500
about and jumping. And then like, I saw this like, this guy and this girl were dancing

352
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,060
next to me, and the girl at one point like hopped up on the guy's shoulders, and the

353
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,680
guy was like doing all these dirty things to the girl, and then the girl started like

354
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,020
leaning back. Like it was a really bad scene, like out of the pool scene in Showgirls.

355
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,020
my god I was just the way you were describing that seriously that's what it looked like

356
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,340
was the pool scene in showgirls but like on a dance floor it was something you'd see in

357
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,180
like an 80s dance film or something I don't know but they were getting cheers and stuff

358
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,700
we were like right next to them so it's kind of weird and you know I don't know how often

359
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,700
you guys go to dance clubs but it is it still humors me to this day when they play like

360
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,260
DDR music in dance clubs I don't know why that is but I find it really humorous and

361
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,060
I remember they played Sandstorm was one song they played and I was like all

362
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,860
dancing to that and they had played Better Off Alone which isn't a DDR song

363
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:07,980
but it really should be you know yeah so I was having a good time so not that I

364
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,620
actually dance like DDR because that really is not the point but you know

365
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,380
it's still kind of fun and I guess that's really it I just kind of partied

366
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,200
go out this weekend and I'm going out tonight to a club again so I'm kind of

367
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,300
being a little but tonight I'm going back to the goth club so I cuz I had a

368
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,640
lot of fun last time I was there so I'm going again tonight to go act all

369
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,820
morbid and yes I'm gonna paint my nails black and look like I've done I know I'm

370
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:39,220
kidding I I I'm just gonna go have fun so you should go cuz I have tomorrow off

371
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,460
work the goth club and we're like yellow maybe I should go dress like a

372
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,940
a cheerleader or something? No, you should get like... Actually, they probably think

373
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:55,180
that was cool. I'll give you the evil cheerleader. Maybe. I don't know, it's funny. You should,

374
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,140
you should, well, I know you don't like going to dance clubs, but if you like dance clubs,

375
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,420
you would like this one. Maybe I'd have to go sometimes just to stand in the corner and

376
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,980
look, you know, evil. Yeah, well, that's what a lot of people do, actually, yeah. They just

377
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,220
stand there looking forward. You'd fit right in, I swear, you'd fit right in. That's, that's

378
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,220
That's like the prerequisite for being goth. You have to be able to stand around and look bored.

379
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
And wear lots of black.

380
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,220
At least that's how it was with all the people I hung out with back then.

381
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,220
I remember the goth club. That's where the big hairy guy in the corset wanted to have sex with me.

382
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,220
What?

383
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,220
We're bears. Grrr.

384
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Actually, it's because I saw this movie on Thursday. I went and saw a movie called A Dirty Shame.

385
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,060
And for those that know me at well at all, I'm a huge John Waters fan.

386
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,020
If you don't know who John Waters is, you should.

387
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,500
He directed Hairspray.

388
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,100
Hairspray.

389
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,460
Yeah, back before it was a musical.

390
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,060
But Hairspray is very tame for his movies.

391
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,580
I'm talking movies like Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom, Desperate Living.

392
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
Those are all the ones I really like.

393
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,700
Yeah, I haven't seen Serial Mom.

394
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,420
Oh, you should.

395
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,460
Serial Mom's a wonderful movie.

396
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
But he has a new movie in theaters called The Dirty Shame.

397
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,100
And it's a total sex comedy.

398
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,260
Like it's NC-17.

399
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,580
It is just absolutely perverse.

400
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,140
And I don't know why I was thinking of that movie just now, but I was.

401
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,580
I do recommend it, even though, seriously, in the last 30 minutes of the film,

402
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:21,060
whoever wrote the script was so coked up that it makes absolutely no sense.

403
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,660
Just being honest with you.

404
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,100
OK, on that note, let's go back to our show, www.orangehonestradio.com.

408
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,460
as promised a little bit earlier I have the sequel

409
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,860
to an inside joke and this is actually one of our new inside jokes but do you

410
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,540
remember a couple weeks ago

411
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,780
we had a little bit of a flub up from Tom Brokaw and he was doing the bukkake

412
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,280
thing

413
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,640
well

414
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,760
it actually came to my attention it's actually in the intro, I guess you forgot about it, it actually came to my

415
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,660
attention at the party I was at on Friday for some reason

416
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,660
you know I was talking about the bukkake I don't know how it came up

417
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,660
but somebody told me said hey Rob you know what

418
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,900
that's not the first time he's done that he actually

419
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,900
flubbed up once before they told me where to go so I get

420
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,100
so this is old news this is like this flub up is like a year old

421
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,340
but I swear it's twice as funny so listen to this it's a little bit long

422
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,500
but listen carefully listen carefully for the mistake

423
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:34,300
The president's trip to Ohio today was a bold effort to cash in on his wartime popularity

424
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,860
as he tries to push through his tax cuts.

425
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,140
The key component in what the president insists is a job stimulus program.

426
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,380
Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.

427
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,780
And as NBC's David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a

428
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,780
A powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts are the answer.

429
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:02,780
Did you hear that?

430
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,780
Oh my god.

431
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
Hold on one more time.

432
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,780
I was over there doing the little schoolgirl giggle.

433
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,780
One more time, one more time.

434
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:17,780
The President took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts are the answer.

435
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,780
tax cunts.

436
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,780
You're so funny.

437
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,780
It's funny when serious news people make big mistakes like that.

438
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,780
I mean...

439
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
You would find that funny.

440
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,780
I mean, how many times do you hear the word cunt on the nightly news? Seriously.

441
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,780
Who is not convinced it's tax cunts.

442
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,780
That absolutely has nothing to do with Vomani and it has nothing to do with video gaming whatsoever.

443
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,460
whatsoever it's just really it's really fucking funny like I thought of that

444
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,820
phrase several times today like I'll just be sitting there I was sitting

445
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,140
there at dinner earlier today and I was just eating and then suddenly I just had

446
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:06,940
these images who is not convinced the tax concert and I started giggling god

447
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:12,100
bless the internet I'll post that sound file on our forums a little later just

448
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:21,060
I did the bukkake thing so huh that was beautiful what what what what what but

449
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:27,260
what what what see what I tell you chat room what do you think was that better

450
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,220
than bukkake I think they think so I'm getting a lot of ha ha ha so I guess

451
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,900
they like that and that's like a year old but I had never heard of that I mean

452
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,460
was new to me so I figured it'd be new to you guys too I didn't hear about that

453
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,020
But maybe you guys did, I don't know.

454
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,780
There are people in the world who do not pay attention to the news.

455
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
I know.

456
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
I know.

457
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
Alright.

458
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:53,100
And in case you don't know what a cunt is, because it looks like someone in our chat

459
00:35:53,100 --> 00:36:02,020
room doesn't know, a cunt is a euphemism for a lady's anatomy.

460
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
Take that as you will.

461
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
Alright.

462
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,860
Let's change topics really quick here before I get into stuff too far.

463
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,760
And actually we will do a Bamani related piece here.

464
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,860
Actually Ultramix 2, there was some brand new news on Ultramix 2 this week.

465
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:23,340
A brand new song was revealed and the band is Delirium and the song is called After All

466
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:29,580
and it's remixed, it's remixed by a couple guys who did a really popular song in 7th

467
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
style.

468
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
I did do that in a cage match.

469
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,060
And you actually, yeah, you put this song in a cage match one time.

470
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,660
is a really interesting thing is now this is the first or it now where was

471
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,140
the orange launch radio cage match based on we originally said it was like songs

472
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,420
that we want to hear in DDR and lo and behold we have our very first cage match

473
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:55,340
winning song that is now in a DDR game I swear we didn't blow huh yeah we didn't

474
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,500
blow anybody at Konami we didn't blow like anybody very strongly yeah we did

475
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:07,940
We did think about it, but yeah. Anyway, I want to cue this up, a little clip of

476
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,380
The Beauty of Silence. You guys probably know this song. It's hoarded out all the

477
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,460
time on 7th and 8th style, but here it is.

478
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,620
Everybody knows that song. You like that song, right? The one from 2DX? Well, those

479
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,820
Those guys, Svensson and Gielen, remixed a Delirium song, and it's going to be in DDR

480
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,820
Ultimate 2.

481
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,820
We are going to play it.

482
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,620
The clue stumped everybody for a long, long time, but actually, I'm really proud, one

483
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,520
of our news, our news guy, Dark Tetsuya, was the one that finally solved the clue.

484
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,120
And the way he figured it out was, finally, he did a Google search.

485
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,220
There were these two guys on the picture that Jason Enos had posted in the, um, DDR Freak

486
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,220
thread, or, not, I'm sorry, not Jason, what am I thinking, I'm sorry, somebody that worked

487
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:57,940
at the company or somebody there had posted a DDR Freak thread, what am I thinking, about

488
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,900
these two guys that were gay guys or something. And everybody was like... Thunderpuss? Yeah,

489
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:10,060
was like, who are these? They're gay guys or something like that, right? And everybody

490
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,260
was assuming that the guys were gay, and they were totally wrong, they just happened to

491
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,180
be Svensson and Guilin, but nobody thought to search for Svensson and Guilin. So, very

492
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:25,120
interesting huh all right actually it's kind of funny because I didn't even I

493
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,520
didn't even realize it when I was doing the show a couple weeks ago uh-huh and I

494
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:37,600
played another version I have after all it's actually on the the delirium best I

495
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:47,560
think it was I think this is it I think that both versions are on here okay no

496
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,560
No, it's not on this one, but it's on another Delirium CD that I have that has both versions of it.

497
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
Alright, we're going to play that song for you guys.

498
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,560
And after that we'll play, I guess we'll play the whole beauty of silence so you guys can hear it.

499
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,560
And then we'll come back with the show.

500
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,560
But I know you guys may not have all heard this song yet.

501
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Sometimes people look to us to play the new UltraMix II songs for you guys.

502
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
So we're going to play it for you guys right now.

503
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,140
And when we come back, there's more news about Ultramix 2 I want to get into.

504
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,060
This is on everybody's mind this week, and I have a lot I want to say about it too as

505
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,060
well.

506
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,100
So here we go, this is Delirium with After All.

507
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Mensing Gila Mix, new for Ultramix 2, enjoy!

508
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:04,100
It becomes very exciting to see the noises of my eyes

509
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,100
As I wash each other's hands inside

510
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,100
No good to give, no meaning to lose

511
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,100
The misting of the night

512
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Everything runs out

513
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,100
And all these headaches, everything goes

514
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:02,700
Nothing's left, but it's we who started it

515
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,500
And so all she sees now is her son

516
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,100
Pushing her young, she's upside down

517
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,700
The pictures behind her closed eyes

518
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Sign you in to find the hero's home

519
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,700
After all these decades, every day I know

520
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,700
After all these decades, every way I come home

521
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Said she wouldn't cry, that would be just love

522
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,700
I can only say things to be said, no

523
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,700
I can only say, turn away from her

524
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Said she wouldn't cry, that would be just love

525
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,700
I can only say, things to be said, no

526
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:14,700
As we won't be shaken away from her

527
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,700
That she wouldn't cry, that would be a crime

528
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Gaming radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

529
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Uh, buj- uh, bukkawky.

530
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,700
Orange Lounge Radio.

531
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:48,700
We are back here on Orange Long's radio. That was awful.

532
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,100
I'm gonna beat that joke in the ground. Just you wait.

533
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,700
That was awful. Beautiful.

534
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,700
We are back here on Orange Long's radio. Hope you enjoyed that little sneak peek there at

535
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,000
Delirium with After All. Gonna be in UltraMix 2.

536
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,500
How many more songs they have to announce for UltraMix 2 still? Like what? Like 150?

537
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:16,100
I don't like how many songs there's an ungodly amount of songs. They still haven't even told us for Ultramix 2 at least

538
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:22,060
At least like what 40? I don't know. I don't even remember. I haven't been I haven't been doing my math very well, so

539
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,260
There's a lot of new songs still coming for Ultramix 2, and that's just the beginning

540
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,620
I I really like that song and I can't wait to play it in Ultramix 2

541
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,620
I know you got to be excited about that one Jamie

542
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,580
You you you called it in a way. I'm so awesome

543
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:48,140
All right. Also, UltraMix II news this week. There was a video posted on the Internet,

544
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,020
and I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of this by now, but if you haven't, run on

545
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,500
over to our website, orangeloungeradio.com, and it's the second story down on our site

546
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,060
right now. It talks about the UltraMix II quad mode video. That's right. A video was

547
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,860
posted on the Internet that shows quad mode in action. Oh, excuse me. I'm a little burpy

548
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,820
you today yeah and quad mode is that mode now on DDR that you have not one

549
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:13,020
not two not three but four dance pads all lined up in a row and you're

550
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,020
dancing back and forth across all four dance pads and this video was posted on

551
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,820
the internet of this mode yeah you knew you probably haven't seen this yet Dark

552
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:26,140
Saga have you let me show you this because actually what really is causing

553
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,820
up a storm here it has nothing to do really with the quad with the quad mode

554
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:35,440
itself but it has everything to do with how the game actually looks so you

555
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,440
You definitely want to check this out here.

556
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,560
Let's see if we can get the video up here.

557
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,880
Oh, I got to give it a minute.

558
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,160
It's going to load up here.

559
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,080
Unless I saved it to the desktop or something.

560
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,560
Yeah, well, it takes just as long to copy it over as it

561
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,840
would to download it.

562
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,000
So I'm stuck now.

563
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
All right, it's coming, it's coming.

564
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,240
Hold on.

565
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,760
But yeah, this is definitely generating a lot of buzz in

566
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,980
DDR community right now because we really haven't heard a whole lot about

567
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:12,240
Ultramix tube outside of song list and the game's only like what six weeks away

568
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,080
supposedly from what we've heard six weeks away from release okay here we go

569
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:24,400
here it is here's the video let me uh it's a clipper right on the light so

570
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,800
look at that there's all these brand new videos there's like a motorcycle thing

571
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,120
that's all brand new everything looks like futuristic like all these new

572
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,360
videos and then of course you know quad mode pretty much looks the way you

573
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:42,320
would expect it to but the rage has a new model look at that rage looks

574
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,620
completely different like he's got like really poofy hair he looks like me in

575
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:52,080
the morning kind of with that hair and his motions are much different we saw

576
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,560
this 33 that all of the other battles and now he's doing like cartwheels and

577
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:03,620
stuff like totally different dances yeah well no we saw it at at a e3 and we saw

578
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,300
Emmys Hucci model right but the thing is is that actually this video shows you it

579
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,820
might be the other video let me bring yeah if I bring up the other video she's

580
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:17,380
been D Hucci 5 because a bunch of people fussed about it at e3 we do not want

581
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,500
Hucci Emmys I actually from what I understand when I was told is that

582
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,300
actually because of a lot of the e3 feedback they did kind of reevaluate

583
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,660
What they had done with Emmy and they changed her back and so in this other video

584
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,580
I'm going to pull up you can actually see and if you want download these videos yourselves orange on serie calm

585
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,340
We have a link right there on the front page still don't get pencils rage

586
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,980
They need hoochie fight characters for download. I'm telling you. I

587
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,640
Know I want to hire a rez monitor or model of

588
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,520
Mr. Spanky

589
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Look, Emi's back to normal there. This is a three-player mode.

590
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,520
And you see multiple dancers kind of going at one time there.

591
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,520
You got Afro and you got Rage and Emi all dancing in this one.

592
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
Like a three-player dance mode.

593
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,520
They're all doing ballet.

594
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,520
They need to stop coloring them up in second place.

595
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,520
Yeah, it's kind of all these little insane little...

596
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,080
Anyway, you can kind of get a...

597
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,080
I can't see Emi.

598
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
You can't see Emi?

599
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
Wait, hold up.

600
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,080
There's Emi.

601
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,080
Oh, it's her fourth mix.

602
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
She's fun by.

603
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,080
Her fourth mix.

604
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,080
Yeah, it's her fourth mix costume.

605
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,920
You can kind of see her.

606
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,400
She's got a little hat and stuff.

607
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,760
Yeah, she did be a hoochie fighter.

608
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
That's cool.

609
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Yeah, so.

610
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,680
They gave her just like this utter hoochie version of like the fourth mix outfit and

611
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,800
that was just kind of wrong.

612
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,760
It was not, you would think it's cool.

613
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,560
Yes, I would.

614
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,960
So anyway, lots of reaction in the Bomani community

615
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,680
going on to those videos.

616
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,560
Now, I usually don't talk about certain posts

617
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,440
on certain websites, but there was

618
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,200
one post that really just got my panties in a bunch,

619
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,240
to be honest.

620
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,880
And this guy came out of the blue

621
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,880
and just started dogging on the quad mode video saying,

622
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,160
those steps are horrible.

623
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,120
And we all know this would happen.

624
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,440
We've told Seagurd, we've told Mel, when they were here on the show before, we said, you

625
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,440
know what?

626
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
People are going to hate the steps.

627
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,400
We had to say it to you guys, but that's the first thing people are going to bag on when

628
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,400
Ultramix 2 comes out.

629
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,140
And I'm sure the steps are great.

630
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,560
They're awesome, but there's always going to be somebody that doesn't like the steps.

631
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,580
And sure enough, this guy comes out of the woodwork and just starts dogging on the steps

632
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,960
saying they're horrible for a standard mode.

633
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,260
What are they doing with all these crosshairs and all this bullshit.

634
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,060
And I'm just thinking, get a load of this guy, you know, whatever, you know, everybody's

635
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,900
welcome to their opinion.

636
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,780
But then I found out that after some more posts went by that this guy had done some

637
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,460
of the step charts for In the Groove.

638
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,380
And I'm sitting here going, who the fuck are you?

639
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,380
Get off your high horse.

640
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,940
I mean, seriously, I talked about In the Groove here last week on the show.

641
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,940
It's a nice game.

642
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,860
It's a cute alternative to DDR.

643
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,660
It's not a replacement for DDR, but it's something else fun to play.

644
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,220
The steps are not all that, okay?

645
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,360
I mean, they've got some neat new ideas,

646
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,620
but they're no better or worse than what we got right now.

647
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,480
I mean, God, this is kinda like, God, get over yourself.

648
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,020
I just think that's in poor taste,

649
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,260
because when you're representing a company like that,

650
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,500
especially when you've got

651
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,580
all these questionable legal issues going around,

652
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,400
for you to go and start dogging on the enemy game,

653
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,780
I mean, it just makes you look like

654
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,440
you had a vendetta from the start,

655
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,420
your opinions don't mean shit,

656
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,060
and it just makes your whole game look shitty.

657
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:42,060
I mean, there was a point earlier this week where I was like, I'm going to come on Sunday's show, I'm going to take back everything nice I said about in the group, because that guy's pissed me off.

658
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:50,060
I've calmed down a little bit since then. I'm not going to take back everything nice I said about in the group. But, I mean, seriously, what a lack of class.

659
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
Can I take back everything nice you said about in the group?

660
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,060
You can say whatever you want.

661
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,060
I take it back for Rob.

662
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,060
I'm kind of surprised there's no reaction from our chat room. I thought half of them were following what was going on.

663
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:07,060
I don't know. We've still got people fixated on you talking about getting your panties in a bunch.

664
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:16,060
What did you think of this, Loki? I mean, you're kind of more Sim scene oriented than us, so what did you think of this?

665
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,060
I don't know. I didn't read the post.

666
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,060
Probably for the best. To be honest, probably for the best.

667
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:25,060
I just hate people bitching about shit that they haven't seen yet.

668
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,060
Oh my god, they're so awful!

669
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,060
The game's not out yet.

670
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,260
But I can tell! I have ESP!

671
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:37,380
That's like, God, if only he knew,

672
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,380
if only he knew, I can't say, if only he knew,

673
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:45,140
he couldn't really say anything, because it's just, you know...

674
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,380
Yeah, anyway, but what's interesting is that,

675
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:54,580
you know, I don't even know, it's almost like they're just looking for an excuse

676
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:54,940
to

677
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,620
dog on these people who work their ass off on, you know,

678
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:03,900
giving this game together. We all know damn well that KDA folks were doing the steps this

679
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,900
time because they wanted to make it right. What they did from UltraMix 1, they knew that

680
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,880
they screwed up the steps, so they wanted DDR fans to do the steps, and some people

681
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,740
are jealous that they weren't the ones doing it, so they're taking the first step chance

682
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,140
they can to just dog on what's going on, and these guys worked their ass off. They were

683
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:24,660
working like 12, 14 hour days that would make you cry to get this game done for us, and

684
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:30,660
You know, it's just I think it's just totally disrespectful and just I honestly if this guy had nothing to do with the other game

685
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,680
I don't think it would be such a big deal because you just write it off as well

686
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,020
You know, there's always gonna be one heckler but the fact that he represents because he worked with this other game

687
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,540
He therefore represents that other game. It just shows an utter lack of class

688
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,900
It just makes me like just it just disgusts me

689
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,560
It's not even a fact that he represents the other game because I mean

690
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,220
Let's just say he was the guy that was doing the art for the backgrounds for like, you know

691
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,700
their game you know songs or whatever that wouldn't even be so bad but it's

692
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,740
the guy that did some of the step charts okay that's even worse and I'm getting

693
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,860
told in the chat room hey don't put in the group down because of one guy and

694
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:07,840
you know what I I don't like I said I was gonna come in here and say a lot of

695
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,580
nasty things about it I decide not to but here's the problem when this guy who

696
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:16,860
works on the game can't show any class at all or any sense of respect at all

697
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:21,300
for what's going on you know on the other half of the fence it does bring

698
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,820
the whole image of everybody on the staff down and I'm sure there's some

699
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,900
wonderful people that work on the game there's wonderful people to play the

700
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:31,380
game there's no doubt about that but one bad apple is can spoil a barrel it's

701
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,080
just like if anybody that out there that uses an orange lounge banner in their

702
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,360
signature I would expect that you're not a fucking asshat in your post because

703
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,260
you're kind of representing our station and if you were starting to be an

704
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,100
asshole in your post I would call you on I'd say you know what don't use our

705
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,420
banner anymore if you're gonna act like an ass. Luckily nice people use our

706
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,560
banner so we don't have that problem. But when you're representing another, you

707
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,180
know, company, I'm sorry, but when you act like an ass it makes everybody look like

708
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,380
an ass.

709
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:06,620
Anyway. No, I completely agree. That's why I have the reason why I don't say where I work.

710
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:12,700
No, seriously. Because I know how I am outside of work. I don't want to be seen

711
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,900
as a representative of my company when I'm not associated with it.

712
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,100
Right, me too. Same thing.

713
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:22,300
So none of us have ever said exactly where we work for it, except for Loki, but he doesn't care.

714
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,740
He doesn't care what you think of his company.

715
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:29,580
To be honest, I don't think anyone would even know about how to get on internet radio at my work,

716
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:34,380
let alone, you know, be able to, you know, figure things out. And they're like, there's,

717
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,340
where do you guys broadcast on the internet? You can do that?

718
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,260
But it's like when-

719
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,260
There's radio on the internet? Holy crap! What's the internet?

720
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:53,260
It's like, you know, when I went to Vegas as part of the DDR Freak moderator trip, there were these guys here who were like fanboys who were following us around everywhere.

721
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,260
And I still wanted to turn around and say, don't you have lives? Go home.

722
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:03,260
But because I was a representative of DDR Freak, I didn't say that. I was just tolerant.

723
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:07,260
And we actually ended up losing him.

724
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,920
so you know that and you know what

725
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,400
does the guy have valid points I don't know but the problem is that it was a

726
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,900
total like attitude problems

727
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,200
so it wouldn't take you know could dish it out but couldn't take it back

728
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,340
I'm spending way too much time on this topic to be honest

729
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,900
it really doesn't deserve this much time but that just really I just want you

730
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,620
guys to think

731
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,640
out there you know if you're representing a certain you know game

732
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,420
stopping an idiot and that even goes for just any old DDR player somebody playing

733
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,740
DDR at the arcade

734
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:43,740
If you start acting like an ass, you make every player that looks like- plays DDR make- look like an ass, so show a little bit of respect.

735
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:49,740
I mean, it's just like, I kind of frown at some people that- certain people that play Soul Calibur 2 in the area, because they're kind of assholes.

736
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:56,740
I mean, and it's- I'm sure, you know, it's a great game, I own it on GameCube, but, you know, it kind of brings the whole fanbase down a little bit when a couple people look like asses.

737
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,740
And don't get me started on the initial D, people.

738
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:12,740
I'm gonna second that. I'm not even gonna go there. That's actually probably a much better example. I can think of more examples for that.

739
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:19,740
Hi, I play this racing game so I have a really awesome car that's stored on a piece of paper.

740
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:30,160
I like in the groove don't get me wrong I mean not well not not just that but you

741
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:37,480
know initial D as well you know anyway I think we beat that into the ground yeah

742
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,140
we did beat I have ice cream I just I wanted to get that out of my system

743
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,240
I've been sitting on that all week do you feel better a lot actually do you

744
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,920
feel spiritually I do you know what I would I would go so far as to welcome

745
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,560
Welcome that guy on our show, if he wants to present a dissenting opinion, go for it.

746
00:57:54,560 --> 00:58:00,840
I'd love to hear it. I would love to debate. It would be just like the presidential debate.

747
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,540
But seriously, it's just one step chart. On a mode that really, I mean honestly, quad

748
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:10,440
mode, it's cute and all, but it really isn't that important. I mean, I want to see what

749
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,800
the rest of the game looks like, to be honest. Let's look at some singles and doubles and

750
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:19,640
how I mean honestly out regardless of how you feel about the step chart look

751
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,680
at this all new backgrounds a whole new song a whole new interface the

752
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,560
characters look differently no more hoochie me I mean there's so you could

753
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:33,200
throw the step chart out completely and there's so many good things about it I'm

754
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,160
very pissed on that they got rid of who she me that makes me sad maybe she's an

755
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:42,480
Easter egg she's not an Easter egg they just here you're making the poor CG

756
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,920
woman look like a hoochie no it might hurt her artificial feelings right who

757
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,820
cares if it didn't look right I mean some things just aren't right but they

758
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:01,080
happen like the Olsen twins acting that's just not right but it happens but

759
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:05,840
yeah if we want to get down on someone that sucks at steps holy crap who about

760
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,840
the people that made that stupid fucking heads and feet mode those are some

761
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:15,120
shitty steps right there that's what I gotta say that's who you should be mad

762
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:20,340
at screw quad mode quad modes difficult because it's four pads and the feet mode

763
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:26,640
man they did not screw you I kind of like hands and feet mode screw you you

764
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,000
can actually from what I hear you can actually go in and change the difficulty

765
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,200
but for whatever reason they made it kind of like almost impossible to find

766
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,480
where to change like I just found out about this the other day like it's

767
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,200
almost impossible like to figure out where you got to go to you know it's not

768
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,280
obvious in other words it's not possible it's not obvious where it is to change

769
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,960
difficulty but it's just kind of like hi my name is Tina I shut up you know

770
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:52,360
nobody cares I hate banner ads that have sound in them I absolutely hate them and

771
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,560
that banner is all over the internet right why not do feedback there's

772
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,200
feedback thread no no I'm not even talking about this I'm just using this

773
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,800
to get that one video that I lost all of a sudden but it's on like a million

774
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:13,100
another site so just Tina can go to hell that's how I feel about Tina I want to

775
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,280
get to this other video but for some reason I keep trying to pull it up and

776
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,040
it doesn't work oh I know why because I got to use the other program to do it

777
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:26,800
let me do to do to do let's see I want to load up another video that came out

778
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:35,000
this week and it actually has to do for DDR festival a brand new video came out

779
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,120
for DDR festival and it shows something kind of interesting going on let's see

780
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,840
what was the name of that is that this thing ah here it is this is the DDR

781
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:49,120
festival teaser now obviously we're on the radio you guys can't see it but I'll

782
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,440
tell you what's kind of going on here yay little you know fireworks because

783
01:00:53,440 --> 01:01:00,440
Festival, hooray, obviously. There's Maximizer.

784
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,680
And look at that, a brand new character select screen

785
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,800
that has your characters. There's rhythm, there's blues, and look at that.

786
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,960
One, two, three outfits for every character now,

787
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,720
that you can pick right there. Some people are calling that customizable characters. I call

788
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,080
that

789
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,320
three outfits a character, but whatever.

790
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,880
There's a new guy there. There's a guy named Drum. So do you think he'll have a

791
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
partner named Bass?

792
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,880
I don't know. We'll see.

793
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,880
And there's a little bit of the song lip.

794
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,880
Pretty much what you'd expect. There's a clip from You're Not Here.

795
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,880
A little bit of the party mode there, but it's all in Japanese, which makes sense.

796
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,880
There's that Feed the Dog and Bunny mode.

797
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,880
And there are some of the members from B4U playing on the itoy.

798
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,880
And it looks much better than the itoy actually does.

799
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:11,880
You should see, like in this video, the B4U chicks, they totally are like paraparing some of these hands of B things on itoy.

800
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,880
And I love Noria, she's such a cracko.

801
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,880
Look at that, look, she's like totally par-par-ing to clear the screen there.

802
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
It's so cute.

803
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
There's Mission Mode, you know that's coming back.

804
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:47,200
There's a little clip of your reign in that video, we all know that song.

805
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:58,560
Bunk Boogie. So, no big surprises there about DDR Festival. Not right now. Anyway, no big

806
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:04,520
surprises there about DDR Festival, honestly. Basically, the three outfits of character

807
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,120
thing, that's kind of new and that's kind of cute. There's probably a whole assload

808
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:12,800
of characters as well. But, to be honest, this is kind of a chance for those of you

809
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,400
guys that don't have a US machine to get to experience the iToy modes and

810
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,280
basically everything that's in Extreme USA, so if you only have a Japanese

811
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,360
machine, which I do, I only have a Japanese PS2. If I didn't live with

812
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,360
Loki, I wouldn't have access to an American PS2, so I only have a Japanese

813
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,200
PS2, so this would kind of be my option to kind of play a lot of the songs

814
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,400
really, so. You've had mission modes in Japanese, because you can't figure out what the fuck to do.

815
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:41,440
Exactly, so I don't know how this... You know there's going to be FAQs up on that one in no time. There'll be FAQs up on it in no time, but I'm not sure how much I would

816
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,260
desire to own this game personally there's really not a whole lot new in it

817
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:50,260
I mean I already own the Xbox but you know there's you know if you don't own

818
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:54,260
an Xbox you know it's your first chance to play some of those songs and I want

819
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:58,020
the fucking European one they have better mixes anyways get that well

820
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,380
actually there is gonna be a song from a euro mix in there a Jamila with

821
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,660
superstar which I know best from the queer eye for the straight guy

822
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:11,580
soundtrack actually so yep um we should probably we should play that well okay

823
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,580
we'll play that song at some point I bet some people want to hear that for DDR

824
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,660
festival and you know I played it on my show a couple times yeah it's a good

825
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:23,660
song oh my god my spin instructor loves that song she adopted it so I don't know

826
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,380
what do you think about the ER festival you own a Japanese and American PS2 is

827
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,820
this something you're kind of interested in getting it all you think Jamie I get

828
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:32,620
it I don't have an i-toy so I don't really give a crap about the i-toy

829
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:42,620
I'm not going to play a game and watch myself flail around stupidly, so no. But I'll get it. I'll get it for stuff.

830
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:48,620
I think, you know what, personally, I think I'm actually going to pass on it. I really don't see the point for me getting it because I can't read Japanese.

831
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:56,620
I already have all the songs minus like three or four or whatever, how many songs have been in DDR yet. I just, there hasn't really been anything to really sell me on it yet.

832
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:00,340
on it yet. I think it's one of those things I'll pick up later as a collector thing, like

833
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:04,120
when it's come down in price a little bit, maybe. Like, try to get it when it's a little

834
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:08,120
bit discounted before it becomes a collector's item and everything, but as much as I want

835
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,200
to support DDR and all, there's too much shit to buy in the U.S. right now.

836
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,720
I already know what else my money's going for.

837
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,280
And UltraMix 2 is coming out like the same week, and honestly, my money's going there

838
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,280
first.

839
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:25,780
I have other imports to get. I have to get 2DX8 style and BlueJing guy, because the U.S.

840
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:32,020
version is asked. All right, I guess we're gonna open up the Skype line because you

841
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,620
know what we've talked about a lot of different things here we've kind of

842
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,580
talked about quad mode and Ultramix 2 a little bit and a little bit of the

843
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:41,080
controversy there we talked about DER festival just curious if you guys have

844
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,940
any comments again if you don't know what the Skype line is all about visit

845
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:48,580
www.orangelandradar.com click on interact with us and you can see the

846
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:51,940
details right there on how to use the Skype line it allows you to call our

847
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:56,380
show without having a phone. I actually think I'm gonna buy the feature to allow

848
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:01,480
us to call out so we can do some phone interviews later with some big-name DDR

849
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,840
celebs, so it'd be kind of fun. Yeah, you can actually call phone numbers using

850
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,580
this little tab right here, but you have to pay for credits, but you know, I'm

851
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,900
thinking about it. I might do that. We'll see. Yeah, I think it's a neat idea for

852
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,740
Skype, so we're kind of giving a minute for the buffer to catch up because it

853
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,820
takes, it takes a minute before you guys actually hear what we say here in studio

854
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:25,000
So I want you guys to be able to call into the skype line. Yes, looky

855
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:32,100
I just was liking one to point out to Rob here three away and four away now. I'm not to mention well

856
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,480
Hopefully we get those so hi. I just hope they're not fakes

857
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:39,860
Look, you might have something really good to play for you guys later. I just hope that God they're not fakes

858
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,420
What was that thing? You were showing me earlier today?

859
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,420
I guess it's a couple months old, but somebody had actually written a whole document like an FAQ on how to

860
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:52,940
to make fake Bahmani songs or something like that. How to make fake test location songs.

861
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:56,300
Which is another thing that I think is in completely poor taste. Don't get me started.

862
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:01,300
You're just preying on poor people that are just looking to get excited about a new game.

863
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:11,180
It's like, you know. But whatever. Yeah, you're showing me somewhere in here, some little

864
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:16,000
guide on how to write a fake Bahmani song. I just had to do, just running something through

865
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,080
a bunch of filters and also the garbage. Yay, we're getting a call. Let's go to the Skyline.

866
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:26,240
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, Sky, it's Elmo Litigan. Hey, Mowat, how you

867
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:32,040
doing? The guy with the coolest name ever. Pretty good. Hey, what's on your mind? Well,

868
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,880
you mentioned DDR Festival and I have some choice words for DDR Festival. I have a feeling

869
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:45,320
I know it's coming, but go for it. Well, first of all, I mean, I know a lot of U.S. mixes

870
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:52,200
been accused of being you know like half-assed like just piling things one on top of the other

871
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:58,200
and not having a lot of balance to them uh-huh i see festival as probably the

872
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:07,000
a perfect example of being a half-assed mix just as far as the uh konami originals

873
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,920
are concerned i don't know if it's so much a half-assed mix it's just the fact that for once

874
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,800
I think it's just the tables are turned and we got something kind of new before Japanese did so

875
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:24,200
This game coming out for them is kind of like when we got like DDR USA. What the hell was that?

876
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,760
It was just a rehash thing. You know, there really wasn't anything special about it

877
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,320
Maybe I'll take a half-assed comment back and I'll go with rehash

878
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:38,440
But half-assed was the first thing that I thought of only because on the way of the Konami originals included

879
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:46,440
thus far, anyway. None of them have appeared, have not appeared on a USA mix yet, and none

880
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:55,760
of them, I mean, the fact of the matter is, the entire Konami original selection, you

881
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,560
can find them on United States mixes already.

882
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:04,440
Right, but for the standard, you know, person living in Japan who, you know, has a casual

883
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,720
passing interest in DDR, it is going to be something new to them, so, you know.

884
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,720
Of course.

885
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,800
But for us, for the import fans, for us, it's no big deal unless we don't have Xbox or don't

886
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,920
have a US PS2, you know?

887
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
That's pretty much it.

888
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,280
For the Japanese gamer, it's something nice because they get more songs that they don't

889
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,220
have on their PS2s yet.

890
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,960
For the American importer, it's kind of a letdown.

891
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,880
But for us fucking obsessive collectors, it's kind of a letdown.

892
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,600
But you know, we have to kind of face the fact that we're in the minority.

893
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:40,040
And Konami, they're getting three games for their buck here, really.

894
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:44,000
We all kind of know that Konami of Japan actually were the ones that did the interface that

895
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,800
Konami USA keeps getting criticized for.

896
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,040
But basically, Konami of Japan made this interface and they got three games out of it.

897
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,200
They got the one in Europe, they got our game, they got their new festival.

898
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,600
So hey, I'm sure it worked out great for them.

899
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,020
Oh yeah, definitely.

900
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,020
Very easy to develop.

901
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:03,320
You come up with a basic skeleton and then you plug in the insides.

902
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,880
For me, I just think it's kind of neat to have the tables turned for once, and we're

903
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,160
getting something new, and it's kind of like, oh, well, we don't need the Japanese mix now.

904
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,800
We don't need to support that.

905
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,000
It's the same damn argument that we heard three years ago when USA was getting the sloppy

906
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
seconds, you know?

907
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Exactly.

908
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,300
There's still some people who are going to spin this into Japan's favor.

909
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:32,980
I think it's comedy gold for all those people that were dogging on Extreme before saying

910
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:38,860
it wasn't Japanese enough. I think it is just comedy gold. It's totally, it's totally just

911
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:44,100
desserts for those people that just said, you know, it's crap. It's USA, just the America

912
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:53,740
ruined DDR. No, not really. This is the direction they wanted to move in. America, in fact,

913
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:58,280
I would go so far as to say that Hawaii, which is an American state, last time I checked,

914
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:02,980
is going to revolutionize CDR. No question about that, especially when you're

915
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,680
getting 50 songs

916
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,440
that are completely new and never been seen before.

917
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,980
You never see that unless you're talking about a brand new Japanese

918
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,660
arcade mix. I'm gonna go so far as to make a prediction here

919
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:19,420
on the program that when UltraMix 2 comes out, about a couple weeks after

920
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,380
UltraMix 2,

921
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,700
it is going to be so huge and it's going to be so...

922
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,140
There are going to be those detractors, like people that work for In the Groove or

923
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:30,380
whatever that are going to be out there going on this game sucks but for the

924
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:35,060
most part 90% of the scene is going to just love this game and say this is

925
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,620
everything DDR should have been and I'm saying that there are going to be

926
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:44,780
freaking riots and petitions for Konami of Hawaii to do an arcade mix the

927
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:49,040
Konami of Hawaii should be given all the rights to do a new arcade mix I would

928
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,860
go so far as to say that I think they're going to be forgiven for DDR PC I think

929
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,360
most people have already forgiven them for it. It was just a chance for them to get their

930
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:03,160
feet wet, and we've all managed to look past it now. UltraMix had some problems, but you

931
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:07,520
know, for the most part it was different, it was new. And now UltraMix 2 is going to

932
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,960
blow it all away.

933
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,520
I definitely agree about UltraMix 2, especially with the song list is pretty much half revealed

934
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,040
by now, and it just blows everything out of the water.

935
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,540
And now just the videos this week, what did you think of the videos that came out this

936
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:31,820
week. The rage remodel kicks ass. Yeah. And the backgrounds and the videos looked awesome.

937
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:37,540
I was very impressed with the movies. Very impressed. You know to be honest though, there's

938
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:41,300
a part of me that's like, why did they bother to show this game at E3? Because it looked

939
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:46,160
nothing like what they've got now. It's kind of like they played a trick on us. It's like

940
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,820
that E3 thing was a total waste. It was just a chance to say we're working on something

941
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,820
And now, you know, this game is just looking incredible.

942
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:58,620
But it's so funny because even I at E3 said UltraMix 2, you know,

943
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,340
don't waste your breath, you know, it doesn't look like the right thing.

944
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,300
But boy, did I get screwed.

945
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:05,980
Yeah, definitely.

946
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:08,180
The first thing, yeah, I'll agree with you.

947
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:11,220
The first thing is like when I saw UltraMix 2, it's like, oh, they got a nice

948
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,900
selection of Konami originals that may or may not make it in the game.

949
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,820
It looks good so far.

950
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:18,180
Yeah, they got that point battle thing.

951
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:23,180
Well, you know those Konami originals? Well, they're in there, and that's all the old stuff you're getting.

952
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:26,180
Yeah. And by the way, there's 70 songs.

953
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,180
Exactly.

954
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:34,180
Any other thoughts on your mind, Mr. Mullet?

955
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,180
No, after that long voice thing.

956
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:44,180
That's fine. Well, we appreciate your perspective as always.

957
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:45,180
No problem.

958
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,180
Have a wonderful day.

959
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:47,180
You too.

960
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:57,980
you too. Alright, bye bye. Bye. The other line was ringing. I'm sure we'll get a return

961
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:03,980
call there. We can pick that up. If you want to interact with the show, www.orangelandsradio.com

962
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:10,380
and click on interact with us. Here comes a call. Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

963
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:18,480
who's this you're breaking up really really badly try again okay hi how you

964
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:29,900
doing you know what oh yeah I hate to do this but I gotta let you go because we

965
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,240
can't hear you at all you're really breaking up bad double-check your

966
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:38,200
connection just it's really really breaking up there I can't understand you

967
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,700
So, we'll try that again later. Maybe we'll get a better connection.

968
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:46,200
That's kind of why the downside of having to take the calls online is that when you get the packet lost and all that crap.

969
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,200
Loki, are you downloading porn over there? Is that why it's so choppy? I'm just kidding.

970
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:54,200
Alright, I guess we better disable the Skyblind for a little bit.

971
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,700
We'll let it get a little better there.

972
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:00,700
And, we'll go to a break.

973
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,700
Because I want to get to the Orange Laundry cage match and some other Bimani news that came out this week for sure.

974
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,200
We also have other favorite segments.

975
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,600
Yes, and we'll open up the Skyline a little bit again later.

976
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,480
In this break we're going to hear some music from,

977
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:17,000
I don't know, some Japanese mixes, some Japanese songs that are popular

978
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,320
in DDR, because Jamie really wanted to hear

979
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,920
Ninzaburo, or, what the hell is the other name of Ninzaburo? I always called it Ninzaburo.

980
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,920
The theme of Furuhata. Thank you, Furuhata theme, I couldn't even remember that.

981
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:34,760
Which is from the show, Furuhata Ninzaburo. That's right. So we're going to play some of these songs, and then we will be back with more

982
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,760
Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back.

983
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:31,840
Feel the heat of operations, all these streets, no situation

984
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,840
Got great complications, party people livin' life

985
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,840
But it's always getting the fast lane, like the yellow, you can't up that lane

986
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,840
I've seen so many blood stains, so many times with these brains

987
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,840
People see what's high, I say they look like the sky

988
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,840
Keepin' real and waiting lies, hella party people at five

989
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,840
This is your life, no key games, listen up and stay with the pain

990
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,840
Yeah, yeah!

991
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:45,840
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!

992
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,840
Let's roll, ah, you, let's roll

993
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,840
Dance, complete the chant

994
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,840
Get the feeling, let's do the beat then move

995
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,840
So feel the groove

996
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,840
Come on, dance

997
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,840
Jump, come on, let's jump

998
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,840
Come on, let's dance, there's got to be less of your feeling, come on!

999
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,840
You ready to roll

1000
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,840
How you feelin' baby?

1001
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,840
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1002
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:37,840
I was a little bit of awkward silence there, sorry guys.

1003
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:47,840
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. I just got distracted by the chatroom while I was trying to queue up the last bit of playlist thing there and I got too distracted.

1004
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:49,840
Don't spam our chatroom.

1005
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:57,940
I forgot to mention that actually I was I was up this morning you know while I

1006
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:01,880
was up till 530 last night and I got up this morning at about 1130 or so I

1007
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,080
started playing Ultramix like all morning I swear to God I was playing

1008
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:09,760
Ultramix for like two hours today online on the dance you know playing against

1009
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,140
other people thing and I think in one day I raised my ranking on the ranking

1010
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:19,320
board from 999 which is you know basically as low as you can get like you

1011
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,600
have to get a certain amount of points where you can never crack that number I

1012
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:27,120
think I raised it up all the way to like 640 something in a day's work so which

1013
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:31,440
isn't that many points but I just for some reason today Ultramix is like still

1014
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,400
popular I was in a lot of four-person matches and the people were kind of

1015
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,600
picking a lot of light songs and we're kind of kind of struggling a little bit

1016
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,520
but you know my only complaint about Ultramix online is that god damn people

1017
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:50,760
keep picking the same damn songs like the default song that comes up when you

1018
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,280
want to pick a song to battle against somebody's 0.59 right Tengoku if you

1019
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,840
want to call it that too that's the default song and so of course like a

1020
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,640
million matches get started with that song because people don't know how to

1021
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,920
change it it's kind of like I'm so sick of this song and then for some reason

1022
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,440
today there was this one person I swear to God every match he or she created I

1023
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,700
think it might have been a she every match she was creating secret rendezvous

1024
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:16,180
a wizard song. It's like, ugh. It just kind of sucks because there's not a whole lot of

1025
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:19,740
people on Ultramix. Usually there's only a couple groups of people playing, so you're

1026
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,980
kind of stuck with whatever songs you can actually find.

1027
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:24,100
Why don't you start off and pick something different?

1028
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:29,380
Yeah, wow, it's not like every time you start a game with, do that thing!

1029
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:34,400
Okay, now it's not true. Just today, I played shiny disco balls and DXY in games, okay?

1030
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,420
So just, you know, shut your mouth.

1031
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,140
Woohoo, DXY!

1032
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:41,060
Nobody else will pick do that thing. I have to show do that thing a little love. Everybody

1033
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:48,940
let's do that thing what what what are you pointing it oh oh Loki wants me to

1034
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:54,820
talk about this story speaking of songs we just posted this to our website even

1035
01:22:54,820 --> 01:23:00,000
though this isn't like directly Bahmani related it's kind of Bahmani related one

1036
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,500
of the ladies from the weather girls Yzora Rhodes she was one half of the

1037
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,760
weather girls she died this week and the weather girls of course if you didn't

1038
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,880
know they did the song it's raining men which was covered in a more very

1039
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:16,760
infamous max 2 song by Jerry Halliwell aka ginger spice which by the way was

1040
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,040
one of the other DDR songs I heard at the club last night was Jerry Halliwell

1041
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:23,760
version of its raining men and I don't think I've ever heard that at a club in

1042
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:31,320
my life and I don't think I've ever seen a dance floor so gay oh that's cool it

1043
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:35,320
was from Bridget Jones diary which had a pretty pretty well-received soundtrack

1044
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:43,000
from what I remember but moment of silence please for one half the weather

1045
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:52,360
girls Yuzora Rhodes all right there we go all right and a little a little clip

1046
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:59,360
for us to remember. Bye.

1047
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,800
I don't care how you feel about that song, you can't deny it's a good DDR song.

1048
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:25,720
that's great for DDR. It really is. Sure, it makes the game look a little fruity, but

1049
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,880
you know what? The song rocks. You know what? I don't think that people can help but look

1050
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:35,960
fruity on DDR. For every song like It's Raining Men, you get a song like Daikonkai, which

1051
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:42,760
is kind of, you know, it's kind of rocking and mannish, I guess. It's a very Testosterone-y

1052
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,640
I think. So, you know, I quit pitching. And there's all the, there's all the

1053
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:52,600
taco stuff. Yeah. Which makes me happy. So shut your mouth. Yeah, we should take all

1054
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,780
of those people, you know, make them go play Pada Pada. Excellent point from Mollet in our chat

1055
01:24:56,780 --> 01:25:01,740
room. I'm still trying to figure out how songs are gay without the ability to

1056
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:07,900
come out and tell us. I'm wondering how songs have a gender preference. Do you

1057
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:12,500
like to, like, you know, boy songs go chat up other boy songs? I'll give you a hint.

1058
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:19,500
The Do That Thing video is kind of what clues you into the fact that that song's a little gay.

1059
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,500
Testostaroni!

1060
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,500
Is that the new San Francisco tree?

1061
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,500
Testostaroni.

1062
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:32,500
I'm being teased by the listeners. I don't like that.

1063
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:38,500
I'm supposed to be proving some kind of fake power over them, and I don't like being teased.

1064
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,000
Rob, is your journalistic integrity being breached?

1065
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,700
Yes. I'm being breached.

1066
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:48,100
You're being breached. And I don't like it.

1067
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:51,600
So, we have more Bimani news. Uh, sure we do.

1068
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,600
I was actually going to queue up the cage match, but if you want to talk- Okay, cage match! Well then, let's do more Bimani news.

1069
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,200
Since you brought it up.

1070
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:04,700
You're the one talking about testosterone and bringing it up. Testosterone-y.

1071
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,420
Yes, Logi.

1072
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:39,700
I've been a doggy so you might be able to PM him and ask him.

1073
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,700
The Sage is fucking heavy. It is 200 pounds.

1074
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,700
It's a real solo pad. It's a real thing.

1075
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,700
It hasn't been modified at all.

1076
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,700
Yeah, he hasn't really done anything with it yet.

1077
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:52,700
Just in case you're interested and have a lot of cash.

1078
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,700
Does he have an idea of how much he's charging for it?

1079
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,700
No.

1080
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,700
I'll pay a dollar.

1081
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,700
Put it on eBay.

1082
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:02,700
Also, as long as we're doing miscellaneous Orange Honest Radio announcements,

1083
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:06,940
to say happy birthday to our cam whore, Misty. It's her birthday today.

1084
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:12,180
We also had a weekend a few days ago. A weekend. A birthday. A few days ago.

1085
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:15,940
Ooh, I'm horrible with birthday. Oh, it's Sharks Girl. Of course, Sharks Girl's birthday

1086
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:20,100
was a couple days ago. She got to go play with dolphins on her birthday.

1087
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,700
I know. That was very nice.

1088
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,220
They were so cute. I want to have her back on the show to talk

1089
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:30,520
about it. Cool. All right. Let's see. Bamani news before we get to the cage match, since

1090
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,520
Jamie decided to delay the cage match here.

1091
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,520
You were the one who decided, okay?

1092
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,520
I just like ruffling your feathers.

1093
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,520
Uh, Dance Mania EX8 is on the way out.

1094
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,520
Of course Dance Mania being the series that a lot of DDR songs come from.

1095
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:48,520
Uh, Dance Mania EX8 is on the way, and it's gonna have some lovely tracks on it, including...

1096
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,520
Um, band?

1097
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,520
Oh. Hold on, I'll do the band. God.

1098
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,520
Distract the show here so I can do a band.

1099
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:02,240
We're banning somebody for being a stupid butt.

1100
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:06,240
Alright. Uh, thank you, now I got that in your ear. What a waste of time.

1101
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,600
If you should blame anybody, you should blame the butt head who came in the chat room.

1102
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,120
Why do you have to do that when I've got other things going on, Mr.

1103
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:19,840
Spammerguy? Alright, anyway. Erotic with Gotta Get It Groovin', the remix of that's

1104
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,160
gonna be on this CD. I'm trying to think of other DDR bands, you know.

1105
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,700
2 Unlimited, Maximum Overdrive, The Horny Horns

1106
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:29,860
Vocal Radio Edit, Horny Horns, Who's That Girl?

1107
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:34,700
Doing a cover of Burnin' Up by Madonna, Extreme with Upside Jump,

1108
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:40,500
Atomic Kitten's gonna do Ladies Night, with Curtis Mantronic doing a remix,

1109
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,720
which is actually a previous Cage Match pick of ours,

1110
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:47,500
I believe. I don't think that remix is, but I know that song was,

1111
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,980
because I picked it.

1112
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:54,060
Oh, what the hell is that song? Simply,

1113
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,060
Or Strictly Business, I think.

1114
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:00,060
Uh, also we've got, um...

1115
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,060
I saw there was another one on here I wanted to mention. Oh, Wildside!

1116
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:05,060
You know Wildside. They did Ears is the Woman and My Sweet Darlin'.

1117
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:07,060
They're gonna have Superstar.

1118
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:11,060
And I don't know if that has anything to do with any other versions of that song, but, uh...

1119
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:13,060
That's gonna be on Dance Media EX8.

1120
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:15,060
So look for that soon, and if you can't find it, that's alright.

1121
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,060
It's gonna be speedy.

1122
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:20,060
We'll play it on Orange L'Anterio as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.

1123
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:21,060
You know who I miss, actually?

1124
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,060
Who?

1125
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,060
I miss the Olivia project.

1126
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:24,560
I do too.

1127
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,060
All those lovely Olivia Newton-John remakes.

1128
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,060
It's cool stuff.

1129
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,060
I know.

1130
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,060
I'm sad.

1131
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:32,060
Especially Xanadu.

1132
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:37,060
What makes me really sad is it almost seems irrelevant to be posting on Dance Mania albums anymore.

1133
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:41,060
Because it's like, I doubt we're going to see a new DDR, you know?

1134
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:43,060
It's just kind of like, it's sad. The whole thing's just sad.

1135
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:46,060
It's all home versions.

1136
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:50,060
Which kind of reminds me of an important question I want to ask on our LiveJournal community later this week.

1137
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:56,300
So, if you're not a member of our LiveJournal community, you should join at www.livejournal.com

1138
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,760
and its username, OrangeLounge, is our username.

1139
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:03,440
So for those of you guys that are on the LiveJournal, you sometimes get to see secret little posts

1140
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,120
and you get to be in the know on some things, and you get reminded every Tuesday night the

1141
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,320
pump up the volume is on.

1142
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,320
Yeah, because...

1143
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,320
Well, okay...

1144
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,400
No, it's a great promotional tour, it really is, and people seem to like having reminders,

1145
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,400
because sometimes it's hard...

1146
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,400
I usually post on there what the marathon's going to be in case you go, oh, that sucks.

1147
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:24,200
usually don't let them listen anyway. A little bit of a warning what's going to be played.

1148
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:28,400
Yeah. That's cool. No, it's a good way to keep tabs on what's going on.

1149
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,920
Sometimes there's a lot of things that, they're not quite appropriate to be posted on the

1150
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,120
front page of our site,

1151
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:37,400
but they're things we want to kind of, uh, clue the fans in on.

1152
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,960
For a picture, rather than a compromising position.

1153
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,400
Oh, shut up. Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1154
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:56,120
Last week, Echo Image made its return to the cage match with a song called Come Back, and

1155
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:58,880
it was Loki's pick for the cage match.

1156
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,880
You know what though?

1157
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,280
It may be a tricky night tonight, because Shane, I noticed, quit out of our chat room

1158
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:07,000
earlier in the show, so he's not going to be here to persuade you all to vote for Echo

1159
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Image.

1160
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,160
So, could be competitive tonight.

1161
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,160
Could be.

1162
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:15,560
We got a lot of good songs tonight, but will an old favorite, or I should say a new old

1163
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,400
favorite of the show, will it win?

1164
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,400
Who knows?

1165
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,400
Tonight's song number one.

1166
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,380
Oh, the way the cage match works, you get to hear three songs, you get to hear a clip

1167
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:26,320
of last week's winner and two new songs in their entirety.

1168
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,000
The song that wins goes into rotation all week long on Orange Laundry.

1169
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,440
It's the Bemani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week, when

1170
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,440
we are not.

1171
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,440
All right.

1172
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,440
Cool?

1173
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,080
All right, here's a clip of last week's winner.

1174
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:46,080
Echo Image, song number one you can vote for tonight, with Come Back.

1175
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:14,080
And fall back to me

1176
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,080
I'm lying here waiting

1177
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:21,080
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting

1178
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:28,080
Feel my heart reaching out to you

1179
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:32,080
You hear me calling

1180
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:39,080
Know the boy, I know the way, I know

1181
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:43,080
She'll see me fall down

1182
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:50,080
Real wide, but I'm still singing to you

1183
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,080
She'll see me fall down

1184
01:32:53,080 --> 01:33:00,080
Know the boy, I know the way, I know

1185
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:05,080
But she'll keep me wild, wild, wild

1186
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:10,080
It's always the same, same, same

1187
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:25,880
All right, song number one in the cage match with Echo Image with Come Back.

1188
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,560
And you know, we're noticing that our chat room seems kind of dead tonight.

1189
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,560
It's considering...

1190
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,560
We're taking a nap.

1191
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,360
We have just as many listeners as we usually do, but our chat room seems a little bit dead.

1192
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,360
I mean, there's a few of you.

1193
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:37,400
This is that new show, that new drama that everyone's going to be talking about on Monday

1194
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,400
about horny housewives.

1195
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,400
Oh, God.

1196
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,200
can be started and we're trying to think like seriously that's what we think

1197
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,640
about like when when when the night seems kind of slow or a little bit dead

1198
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,880
it's kind of like is there something else going on tonight like where the

1199
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:53,080
Oscars on tonight huh I have a hard time believing they're all sitting at home

1200
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:58,960
watching desperate housewives of the debate all right anyway moving on

1201
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,040
they're playing Silent Hill 4 let's get on to a song number two tonight in a

1202
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:08,640
cage match it is Jamie's pick Jamie tell us about your pick tonight I'll tell you

1203
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:15,640
You decided to go with an old favorite too. You decided to use Loki's own tricks on him, and you went with an old favorite. You went with Enflow.

1204
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,640
Oh yeah, I just picked a random Enflow song because I couldn't think of anything else.

1205
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:25,640
Alright, so here's the random Enflow song that Jamie decided on. It's called You Said. Is this from their Astro album?

1206
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:30,640
No, it's from... I don't remember the name of the album.

1207
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,640
Alright.

1208
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,640
I think it's from the last one before the Astromantic.

1209
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:39,140
Alright, fair enough. Well, here it is for you guys to give it a try.

1210
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:43,080
See if you like this one enough to give it your vote tonight. It is MFLO with

1211
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:50,080
you said, Jamie's picking my escape the match. Enjoy!

1212
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:38,200
You said that you would not let me go You said that you would be for everything

1213
01:35:38,200 --> 01:36:03,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1214
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:46,560
I will always be the one who will never let me go

1215
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,560
Say that you will be my everything

1216
01:36:52,560 --> 01:37:00,560
I will always be the one who will never let me go

1217
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:26,040
So if you told me, oh, shit and shit, that I'm missing better, oh, I ain't shit, yeah.

1218
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,880
Say that you will never let me go

1219
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,080
Say that you will be my everything

1220
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:07,080
Wanna always be around

1221
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,760
Say that you will never let me go

1222
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,840
Say that you will be my everything

1223
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,780
Say that you will always be around

1224
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:20,620
Say that you will never let me go

1225
01:39:50,620 --> 01:40:20,580
All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Emplo with You Said.

1226
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:25,060
Now we will say what we thought of that song, starting with Jamie.

1227
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,320
I like that song.

1228
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,680
I was listening to some Unflow earlier today while I was doing my homework.

1229
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,900
And that song, I was just sort of like, huh.

1230
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:39,100
So yeah, I give it an 8 overall, because it's good, it's solid.

1231
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:40,740
It just sort of stuck out my head today.

1232
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:42,740
And it's better than what I was going to pick,

1233
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:45,260
because I don't think that many of our listeners

1234
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:46,940
would be quite prepared for wrong stuff.

1235
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,540
Out of hell with what the listeners think.

1236
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:49,660
OK, I'll hit lose if I get it.

1237
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:57,660
It was alright. It started a little bit better as it went on though, so I'll give it a 7.5.

1238
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:59,660
Logie

1239
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:32,300
on the same page as Bradley. Alright, let's move on to song number three in tonight's

1240
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:38,580
Caves Match. I picked it, and it's by an artist called Karma Club, and I actually never heard

1241
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:42,420
of him until I just randomly downloaded this song on iTunes, but I was kind of like, huh,

1242
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:48,340
this kind of reminds me of, like, Smile DK, like, but American, so. Look, he says he hates

1243

1302
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:17,320
there in our chat room. Meanwhile, oh my gosh, iTunes just crashed my whole damn computer.

1303
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:20,260
I think we're, no, we're okay, we're still up, we're still up and running, but just iTunes

1304
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:26,040
crashed, it was kind of scary. All right, meanwhile, I noticed Loki's looking on a site

1305
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:29,860
about, that has to do with some other Bomani news that came out this week. I guess there's

1306
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:33,820
this guy and he does a lot of music for other video games that I don't really play, but

1307
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:37,940
apparently a lot of you people know him and he's kind of popular. His name's Jesper Kidd,

1308
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:43,340
KYD, right? And he does a lot of songs for other video games. Do you have a little clip

1309
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:46,980
of some Jesper Kidd songs here? Because Jesper Kidd has announced he's going to be doing

1310
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:53,100
three songs for D.E.R. Ultramix 2, which is kind of nice. Alright, we're trying to find

1311
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:57,780
a little clip of a Jesper Kidd song to play for you guys here. Let's see if we can get

1312
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:02,780
a little. Just anything. Just play as anything so we can get a feel for what this guy sounds

1313
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:13,780
like. Ooh. Maybe we'll get that industrial music you've been looking for, Jamie. He does

1314
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:19,780
stuff that's very similar to, like, Quake-type music, you know? Very, that dark industrial

1315
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:24,780
type stuff. This stuff right here is from Freedom Fighters, that game. That's the main

1316
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:31,780
This is another fight for three. I want that, that's cool.

1317
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:41,220
Anyways, there's those. But what I was mentioning, or gonna mention actually,

1318
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:45,140
from his website here. Let me get to him again.

1319
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:49,260
I want to add real fast the three songs that he has announced for Ultramix 2.

1320
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:53,900
Istanbul Cafe is one, Red Room is another song, and then this other

1321
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:54,640
interesting one,

1322
01:49:54,640 --> 01:50:00,360
59 or 59 kid Konami mix and kind of the question now is is that a remix of dot

1323
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:08,400
five nine question mark yes it is and how do you know this I can't say but yes

1324
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,500
it is oh well I didn't I didn't even know one way or the other you know

1325
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:14,600
something I don't think is I don't know if this was a remix or not because a

1326
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:22,000
certain person mentioned something about a I don't know point five nine remix

1327
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,600
Alright, then I guess it is a 0.59 remix. I didn't know!

1328
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:30,480
Well, hooray! We get a 0.59 remix by some random video game guy. That'll be fun.

1329
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:33,400
Alright. I didn't know.

1330
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:37,400
Shit.

1331
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,080
Alright. Alright.

1332
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:45,160
Uh, we will, uh, what are we gonna do? We gonna take a break? Are we gonna, uh,

1333
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:48,400
talk about more Bonboni news, or what? Let's break stuff.

1334
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:54,400
Let's break stuff. Actually, you know what? We did have a request. Somebody wanted to hear that Jamelia song, Superstar.

1335
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,400
Yeah, somebody did.

1336
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:56,400
Yeah, that was you, wasn't it?

1337
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,400
Somebody sitting in this big green chair.

1338
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,400
That's what I thought. But I think the other folks thought it was a good idea as well, so...

1339
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,400
We'll play that for you guys.

1340
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:12,920
No, we're not going to play Say I've Never Done a New Story.

1341
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:17,840
We're going to play, uh, uh, we're going to play, uh, where the hell is it?

1342
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,840
Where is it?

1343
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,840
Oh, here, it's in here.

1344
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,840
Alright.

1345
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,320
Uh, there it is.

1346
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,320
Let's do this.

1347
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,320
Wow, this is great radio, you guys.

1348
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:28,320
Alright, we'll be back after this.

1349
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:31,040
It's actually the full version, because I don't have a DDR edit, but if you're going

1350
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,400
to be getting DDR Festival, you'll be playing this song, and if you're lucky enough to be

1351
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,900
begin the DDR Europe mixes. You've probably already been playing the song. It's Jamelio

1352
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:44,900
with Superstar, we'll have the cage match winner when we come back from this.

1353
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:11,900
Why did I want a piece of paper?

1354
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:15,900
Got a feeling I'll see you later

1355
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:19,900
There's something about this that's keeping moving

1356
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,900
And if it's good enough to get something cooking

1357
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:26,900
Then I really wanna rock with you

1358
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:32,900
I'm still in some connection to this thing you do

1359
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:37,900
I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this

1360
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:39,900
I don't know who you are

1361
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:44,900
But you must be some kind of superstar

1362
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:49,900
Cause you got a lot to do no matter where you are

1363
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,900
Baby take a look around

1364
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:59,900
Everybody's getting down

1365
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:07,900
Still with all the problems later Bad boys aren't their best behavior

1366
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:12,900
There's something about you That keep it moving

1367
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:19,900
And if it's the last you hear something cooking Cause I really wanna laugh at you

1368
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:25,900
I'm still in some connection to the things you do

1369
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:29,900
I don't know what it is that makes me feel crazy

1370
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,900
I don't know who you are

1371
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:36,900
But you must be some kind of stupid love

1372
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:41,900
Cause you gotta have a view no matter where you are

1373
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,900
You do it one day

1374
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,900
I like the way you're movin'

1375
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,900

You do it one day

1378
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,900

01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:16,040
going on people are like dead I think we've we've resorted to being that thing

1405
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:21,140
that's on in the background I think it's what's happened to us yeah scary anyway

1406
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:26,840
um tonight we have a surprise we have a tie in tonight's cage match believe it

1407
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:31,480
or not which means someone's gonna be breaking the tie so let's find out what

1408
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:47,480
two songs the tie is between song number one is echo image so that is a song

1409
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:51,360
number one that is tied in tonight's cage match and song number two that is

1410
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:57,680
tied in tonight's cage match lucky star

1411
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:01,960
So, a bunch of M-Flow haters.

1412
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:06,720
That means, yes unfortunately M-Flow not feeling the love tonight, but somebody's better be

1413
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:09,600
feeling the love from Jamie pretty soon here.

1414
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,600
Jamie's gotta break the tie.

1415
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:15,080
The Orange Lawns rules state that when there is a tie in the cage match, the host who didn't

1416
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,680
end up in the tie gets to break the tie.

1417
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:18,680
And Jamie?

1418
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:21,020
It depends on who's gonna pay me.

1419
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:23,520
I accept bribes, you know.

1420
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,440
I'll show you my boob.

1421
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,640
That's okay.

1422
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:34,640
I don't know. Shane, who should I pick? I don't know what he's going to say.

1423
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:39,200
Don't you want to get something new in there for once?

1424
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:45,300
Aren't we a little sick, Echo Image? We just don't like happy Poppy Train.

1425
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:50,920
But look at it this way, it'll lose next week for sure.

1426
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:56,120
See, if Echo Image wins again, then I can put in Rammstein

1427
01:57:56,120 --> 01:58:03,960
out everybody's speakers and that would win. Do you really want Rob to win? Well too bad

1428
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:14,360
you won. Yeah reverse alright fine then by a tie vote. I did it for Shane okay. I did

1429
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:19,800
it because Shane is my dunk fan. Alright. He's my dunk buddy. I was a good cliffhanger

1430
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:24,600
Jamie. I applaud you for that one. Just because I'm awesome. Everybody wishes they were cool

1431
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:28,120
like me all right uh echo image wins that's a nice cage

1432
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:33,080
match by a whopping oh that's so sweet did you see what you had their hearts

1433
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:36,200
racing for a minute there

1434
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:40,760
and you know what's going to happen the minute that that song gets bumped out of

1435
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:43,240
the cage match is that somebody's going to put in that

1436
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:47,720
never-ending story makes we'll have echo image for the rest of our lives

1437
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:50,720
I already know Loki's planning on doing it.

1438
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,720
Liar.

1439
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:54,720
Alright.

1440
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:57,720
More Bomani news.

1441
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,720
You know, there's a couple other Bomani games where they've kinda slipped under the cracks.

1442
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:02,720
We haven't talked about them a whole lot.

1443
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:05,720
But, you know, Tokyo Game Show happened this last week, and it kind of...

1444
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,720
You know, we talked about DDR Festival.

1445
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:10,720
They had a new movie that showed there, and it showed the character customization.

1446
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:13,720
It kinda showed us a little more what was going on with DDR Festival.

1447
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:21,920
also coming out was some more information on Pop'n Music and Beatmania 2DX, and apparently

1448
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:26,300
they had some folks that were actually kind of doing a performance there at Tokyo Game

1449
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:30,680
Show, and no unfortunately we don't have clips, but what I thought was interesting is that

1450
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:35,360
L.E.D. was actually at the show, which is kind of, I had heard these rumors, yeah, but

1451
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:38,400
I heard these rumors he wasn't with Konami anymore, but here he is, showing up at Tokyo

1452
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:43,380
Game Show, helping promote, so I think he's back or something, and then they actually

1453
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:49,180
We had VJ, TA-K was there, and, uh, SLAKE!

1454
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:53,300
And, uh, LED vs. SLAKE was performing, which kind of gives you a hint that, gee, I wonder

1455
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:57,820
if there's gonna be a, uh, uh, 8th consumer style song like that.

1456
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:04,140
And, uh, let's see, uh, there was a song called Human Scramble from the anime A Human Crossing,

1457
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:08,640
I guess it was, uh, something performed by, uh, Aki...

1458
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:09,640
As...

1459
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:10,640
Let me see.

1460
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:11,640
Asahina?

1461
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:12,640
Gimme gimme gimme.

1462
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:18,640
I don't know. I'm so white. I'm sorry, boys and girls. Try that.

1463
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:19,640
Aki Asahina.

1464
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,640
Asahina? So I was kind of right.

1465
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:22,640
Yeah.

1466
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:27,640
All right. And it's going to be a song called, there's also a song called Dance With Me, Tell Me More.

1467
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:31,640
And Tell Me More is going to be on the 2DX8 style limited edition, so.

1468
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,640
Ooh, that's right, because I'm ordering that.

1469
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,640
Yeah, so, you know, that probably gives you an indication.

1470
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:37,640
No, I'm going to have that 8 style.

1471
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:40,760
There's a group called Guzzle that performed

1472
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:44,240
and they did a song called The Bottom of Same Sky and a song called

1473
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:48,760
Egoist which is going to be in Poppin' Music 10 and the full version of Egoist

1474
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:52,320
is going to show up on the Poppin' Music 10 limited edition. So

1475
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:55,700
lots of fun news there for Poppin' Music 10 and

1476
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:58,840
2DX8 style as well. And then Sana

1477
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:04,000
and Togo were there and they performed a song called Custom Made Girl Not For

1478
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,600
Sale.

1479
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:07,880
That's awesome. That's the best song name ever.

1480
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:11,440
It sounds very much like a pop music song but we don't really know which way it's

1481
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:12,160
going yet.

1482
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:15,720
And then a song called Every Day Lovely Day which is going to be on the

1483
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:16,480
pop music

1484
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:20,100
10 consumer style and then a remixed version by LED

1485
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:24,880
is going to be in 2DX8 style. So lots of new stuff coming out on these

1486
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:30,760
two soundtracks. Pop music 10 and 2DX8 style as well as in the games that are

1487
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:31,240
coming out

1488
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:32,240
November 18.

1489
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:33,240
We love LED.

1490
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,240
Yes.

1491
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:36,760
We love LED and groovy.

1492
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:38,920
Why does this stuff all have to come out at the same time?

1493
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:39,920
That's the problem.

1494
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,920
I got no money.

1495
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:41,920
I'm po.

1496
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,200
Because they want to get as much money from us as possible.

1497
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:45,560
They want to suck us dry.

1498
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,620
I guess so.

1499
02:01:46,620 --> 02:01:51,200
They want all of our money to belong to Konami of Japan.

1500
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,200
I guess so.

1501
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:53,200
It's a corporate plot.

1502
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:54,200
Conspiracy.

1503
02:01:54,200 --> 02:02:00,560
conspiracy because you know the case that's using all the money to build a

1504
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:08,920
giant robot they're using it to build Metal Gear hmm I don't know right okay

1505
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:13,640
all right gotcha ah try anything any other Bemani news

1506
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:16,360
actually I'm gonna go over to Loki since we haven't heard from him a little bit

1507
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:20,960
and ask Loki Loki what's going on in the sim scene surely there must be something

1508
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:27,960
I'm sure there is. I don't know what that is. Let me look.

1509
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:39,960
Other than TDR Maniacs being fucking slow as hell, let's see here. I think I mentioned last week that Alpha24 came out, not that anyone cares.

1510
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:45,960
Why they're up to alpha 24 is beyond me, but they are.

1511
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:53,960
Other than that, there's a poll still going on for what characters should be ripped next.

1512
02:02:53,960 --> 02:03:00,960
Since the 5th mix character is almost completely ripped for use with StepMania, some themes are being worked on right now.

1513
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:05,960
The DDR9 Red, which is obviously a rip off of 2DX Red's theme.

1514
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:11,960
and Trans Machina 5, which a lot of people that are out there in the Sim world know about.

1515
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:19,960
Also, there's of course, you know, Techno Fiend still being worked on. Really nice right now.

1516
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:33,960
But you know, that's just basic theme stuff. DDR UK will have Ultramix Pack 6, and the DDR Extreme US tracks as soon as their downloads come back up.

1517
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:47,960
Um, the Extreme tracks I know are almost done, UltraMix Pack 6 are done, they're just waiting to be uploaded, or waiting for the, uh, whatever to be fixed, so that stuff's, um, coming, and...

1518
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:57,960
Really, other than that, Bomani style, the remix contest, they're still judging, because some of the judges are slacking off, and so that's still going.

1519
02:03:57,960 --> 02:03:59,340
So fire them!

1520
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:05,260
So hopefully soon, but this is why, you know, I never hold a remix contest where, I mean,

1521
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:09,100
I'd say I'd have like, you know, a few judges, and they'd have to be local so I could yell

1522
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:11,220
at them.

1523
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:14,620
Fire the god damn judges and set some deadlines next time!

1524
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:15,620
Seriously!

1525
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:16,680
I mean, sorry!

1526
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:17,680
But, you know.

1527
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:21,620
Well, they also had their server thing where they got a new server recently, so, you know,

1528
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:22,620
there was that.

1529
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:23,620
Alright, alright, alright.

1530
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:24,620
Alright.

1531
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:25,620
Fine, whatever.

1532
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:27,420
Bakers can't be choosers, I guess.

1533
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:29,420
Yeah, we can.

1534
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:59,320
Yeah. Oh, oh, now she makes O-Face.

1535
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:01,120
Oh, yes. I may not be here either.

1536
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:05,320
So, we'll probably have a pre-taped show next week for you guys.

1537
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,420
I think that's what we're gonna have to do.

1538
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:08,420
We need to go, like, to Goughland and do a show again.

1539
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:10,720
That's why I kinda wanna do a show from the ghetto.

1540
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:12,720
That means going to Scandia.

1541
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,720
I think that would be fun to do a show from the ghetto.

1542
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:16,720
In the ghetto?

1543
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:17,720
We'll see.

1544
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:19,120
Alright, uh...

1545
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:22,320
I don't know. I thought that our last one we did at Goughland was funny when they almost threw us out.

1546
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,320
That was pretty funny. I would kinda...

1547
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:28,520
until we said, but we're promoting you.

1548
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:31,400
That's a good idea. We could go to Golf Land and play the new StepMania machine, although

1549
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:34,640
I hear it kind of sucks, and that's not Loki's fault. It's just the fact that the computer

1550
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,640
inside sucks.

1551
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:41,840
Well, the only way it sucks is the fact that it has a default skin with no movies, but

1552
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:46,520
other than that, the pads do suck, and that's not my fault at all. That's their shit, you

1553
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:53,380
know. I tried, hey, my original computer specifications worked very well with video and all that shit.

1554
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:59,060
It's just, you know what, when someone else does the job for you, it just doesn't quite come out how you wanted it.

1555
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:05,580
You know, I just don't care because I wasn't going to spend any more time nor money on that.

1556
02:06:05,860 --> 02:06:17,940
However, what has come to my attention, and I plan on doing this, I have to come up with $200 though, is, um, apparently, Channel Beat's having a sale.

1557
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:22,500
Uh oh! And you know what that means? That means I get my

1558
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:27,140
parts for my cabinet. Those parts being my Dance Maniac sensors.

1559
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:31,320
Dropped from fifty dollars a piece to now- or fifty nine dollars a piece to

1560
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:32,660
twenty nine dollars a piece.

1561
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:35,900
Awesome. So, arcade perfect

1562
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:39,140
Dance Maniac sensors and all the other shit.

1563
02:06:39,140 --> 02:06:43,140
I just have to figure out if I can use those sensors or not because I don't know if it connects to an

1564
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:44,060
Airface board.

1565
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:48,200
Uh, yeah. You can always make modifications for your face. I'm sure I could get to work.

1566
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:52,400
Even, you know, even if I just had... Break out a ballpoint pen and some, uh,

1567
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:55,440
paper clips, you know. But, you know,

1568
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:59,360
what I found out that's very interesting, and it does tie in with StepMania,

1569
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:03,440
StepMania's license agreement, basically, you can

1570
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:07,620
take StepMania, modify it how you want, as far as

1571
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:11,080
theme, whatever. Put your own songs in it,

1572
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:17,080
Create your own theme, and you can sell it. And you can make money off of it.

1573
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:21,080
And all you have to do is just say, powered by setmania or whatever.

1574
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:26,080
And that got me thinking, well wouldn't it be cool to make a new arcade game?

1575
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:30,080
Hmm, I don't know. I want to make something like Dance Maniacs.

1576
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:33,080
I want to at least do it for, you know, my cabinet itself.

1577
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:35,080
The waving the hands game.

1578
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:40,080
No, I want to do something across like with Dance Maniacs and, um, what was it?

1579
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:42,080
Was it like Technomotion?

1580
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,080
No, not necessarily like Technomotion.

1581
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:52,080
Dance Maniacs and Para Para, which basically would be, it would sort of be like Para Para, but it would have top and bottom sensors in a way.

1582
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:54,080
Make the country line dancing game.

1583
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:56,080
No, not country line dancing, that's retarded.

1584
02:07:56,080 --> 02:08:03,080
What I want to do now is I want to have infrared sensors, because you can actually do some sensors where they have different trigger points, you know, below a certain level.

1585
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:07,040
level so I basically have like you know up to waist high or whatever that'd be

1586
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:10,980
one set of five sensors and then above that be another set but without those

1587
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:15,740
stupid you know actual things in front of you so you don't keep hitting them

1588
02:08:15,740 --> 02:08:19,180
with your hand and then have you know cool like techno trance stuff to go with

1589
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:24,500
it do mocap dance and be awesome but that's what I want to do at least but

1590
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:29,900
who knows I just have to see because I have the only problem with the buy-off

1591
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:36,140
channel beat you have to spend a $200 minimum so you know I can buy the dance

1592
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:40,500
maniac sensors that's like going to be about you know say I buy three or no

1593
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:45,820
four of them that's gonna be you know good you know $120 and I still have $80

1594
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:48,820
left I have to spend on that so I can maybe buy another sensor and some

1595
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:53,860
miscellaneous crap and then you know maybe set this weird dance thing or

1596
02:08:53,860 --> 02:09:00,860
or whatever. It's just, I don't know. I think it'd be cool, but, you know, what do I know?

1597
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:06,660
You could buy a turntable. I have, you can't buy turntables off there, and I would buy

1598
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:11,020
the turntables, the RK Perfect ones if they sold them, but they don't, and that pisses

1599
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:15,420
me off. I would need to, it's like, where the fuck, if something breaks on your, you

1600
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:20,500
know, Bimani cabinet, or whatever, where the fuck do you buy the parts that aren't listed

1601
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:24,000
on channel B. That's what I want to know. I think that a lot of them, you have to order

1602
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:29,660
them from the Japanese distributors, like uh, like from Konami. Cause I want to like

1603
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:36,640
order the exact turntable parts. Rip up an arcade-style controller? No. Not worth the

1604
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:40,740
500 bucks you'd have to spend on it. No, not worth the 500 dollars, no fuck that. I'm still

1605
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:46,620
pissed off about my order, cause I had everything, I had my, my friend living in Tokyo who was

1606
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:52,540
gonna have my arcade controller delivered to her apartment. But no, they had to reject

1607
02:09:52,540 --> 02:10:01,540
my credit card. Thank you, Konami. Yeah, it's just, I don't know. But, I don't know. We'll

1608
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:05,900
just see. I just need to finish my cabinet first. I need to, I need to stop taking on

1609
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:10,980
extra projects. But I, see the problem is right now. Focus. I have, well I'm focusing,

1610
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:16,180
my fucking I-Pak's broken. My old I-Pak 2 is broken, I think, because it's been flipping

1611
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:22,980
out weird when I hook up the dance pads to it and so I bought a new one that's coming

1612
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:31,980
I pack value edition V or something like that which oddly enough has more sensors than the

1613
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:38,660
I pack 2 and it's USB only but that's coming this week and so once I get that then I'll

1614
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:42,220
be able to work on my cabinet again because I think that you need to open your gate to

1615
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:49,300
hell. I'm gonna do that later. I have to finish that too, but I need to get this

1616
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:51,860
stuff done. I want to get my cabinet stuff done because the weather is gonna

1617
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:55,020
be turning for the worse, and I won't be able to work on it during the winter

1618
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:59,120
because it's raining like a bitch, and you know, I have my wood. So what I want

1619
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:04,060
to do is I want to fucking sit down, get a friend to help me, and just chop up all

1620
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:08,260
that wood that I've got out there too. Like, you know, nice two foot by four

1621
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:13,420
foot sections so I can actually you know finish that no we're not calling it

1622
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:20,140
Loki motion because that's retarded that was cute it's cute but it's retarded

1623
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:24,740
Loki motion Loki motion

1624
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:29,140

1625
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:36,220
anyways I'm done so what else we gonna talk about you get pissed off yeah I

1626
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:41,800
I just want to ask for a minute. What the fuck is wrong with everybody tonight and not you guys, but I'm like God

1627
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:46,140
It's like is it something in the air is everybody on their period what is going on tonight?

1628
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:50,160
Like it's just like we're everything is dead tonight. It's like

1629
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,920
Are we being invaded by aliens? What is going on?

1630
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:59,800
Now is our show old have we jumped the shark we did not jump the shark

1631
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:02,960
Okay, if we were gonna jump the shark it would have been when we let Loki sing. I

1632
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:09,760
I agree.

1633
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,000
People need to wake up. Seriously.

1634
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,200
But I'm sleepy too, Rob. I know.

1635
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:20,120
They're all undressing me. I'm not saying everybody's dead, but it's just like, God, I mean, seriously,

1636
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:24,640
tonight's kind of like deader than usual. We have people in our chat room and we love and adore them.

1637
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:28,640
I know. We think that they're... I know just the thing to perk people up.

1638
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,640
I know just the thing. I know just the thing.

1639
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:32,640
Who is not convinced of tax concepts.

1640
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:34,640
Rob!

1641
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:36,640
First of all.

1642
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:38,640
That made me feel better.

1643
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,640
I swear you do the whole little schoolgirl...

1644
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:44,640
It's like a schoolgirl combined with Dr. Evil, but you know.

1645
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:48,640
It's very cute, Rob.

1646
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:50,640
Very cute.

1647
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:52,640
Some people are saying that they're trying to call us

1648
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:54,640
and they can't get through because I'm being a bitch

1649
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:56,640
and haven't opened the Skyplane, huh?

1650
02:12:56,640 --> 02:13:01,000
Yeah, I turned it off, but I turned it back on just now, so that's fine.

1651
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,000
If somebody wants to call us and tell us that, you know,

1652
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,800
if someone wants to pick up the pace a little bit.

1653
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:10,960
Call us or we'll play Let Them Move. No, we will not. No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even do that.

1654
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:15,480
I would do that if like nobody was, I don't know, if I really wasn't getting

1655
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:16,480
something my way.

1656
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:20,480
Call 1-900-HOT.

1657
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:24,360
Alright. Oh yay, we're getting a call. See, that's how it works. Hi, you're on Orange Ons Radio.

1658
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:27,800
Hello? Hello? Hi!

1659
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:34,440
I'm sorry, um, you're, if I try to turn it down on the 365, it turns everything else down.

1660
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:37,520
Uh oh. So,

1661
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,760
see, if I mute it, then it mutes you guys. Uh oh.

1662
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:44,600
So I suppose maybe I should just stop it? Can you hear us okay?

1663
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:49,440
Yeah, I can hear you guys now. Yay! Okay. Yeah, we can hear you fine. You're like one of the most clear

1664
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,240
callers we've ever had called a show.

1665
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:58,240
Well, I just got my headset a couple days ago, so I finally decided to call and say

1666
02:13:58,240 --> 02:13:59,240
hello.

1667
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:00,240
Kudos to your internet connection.

1668
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:01,240
Now tell us who you are.

1669
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:02,240
This is Rai-Chan.

1670
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,240
Hi Rai-Chan.

1671
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:04,240
Hi.

1672
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:05,240
A new caller.

1673
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:08,840
We don't get a lot of girls calling the show, so I'm glad that Rai-Chan could call.

1674
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:12,160
We have Misty, and I think Irene called a few a while back, but we don't get a whole

1675
02:14:12,160 --> 02:14:13,600
lot in comparison.

1676
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:14,600
So what's up Rai-Chan?

1677
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:15,600
Oh, not a whole lot.

1678
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:19,040
I tried to call you guys before, just as you guys went to the break.

1679
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:22,560
Oh, when we were talking about DDR Festival and quad mode and all that stuff.

1680
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:26,360
Yep. What was on your mind? Oh, just the whole...

1681
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:30,200
I'm one of those import only. I don't have US versions at all.

1682
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:35,640
Is there any reason for that? Is it just because you bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 first and then...

1683
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:39,040
Two years ago when my first boyfriend and I broke up.

1684
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:43,000
I had him, he owed me money, so I bought

1685
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:46,080
a Japanese PS2 with what he owed me. Hey, you know what?

1686
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:50,760
inherited a third and fourth style out of a previous relationship so isn't that

1687
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:58,080
the best way to get new stuff? Of course. Most of my DDRs actually do come from other people.

1688
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:05,700
Wow! My third mix I bought for myself. My fourth my mom bought for me in exchange for doing

1689
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:11,880
housework. Fifth mix Jason bought for me. Sixth mix my brother got me for

1690
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:18,280
For Christmas, the seventh I bought for myself just before a tournament, Extreme, my second

1691
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:19,720
boyfriend got for me.

1692
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:20,720
Wow!

1693
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:21,720
You know what?

1694
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:23,520
I want people to start buying me my bimani.

1695
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,720
Why do I have to buy it?

1696
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:27,560
Well, Loki did buy DDR Extreme, so there's that.

1697
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:31,680
The festival will be a gift from somebody too, whenever that finally comes.

1698
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:32,680
Wow!

1699
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:34,640
That's where you have the collection Derival Mine.

1700
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:38,580
Yeah, Rai-chan actually has her collection posted.

1701
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:41,000
Is it public on the internet somewhere, where we can see it?

1702
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
It's in my LiveJournal user info, which, if you want me to take a look at it...

1703
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Do you want to say that on the air? I don't know.

1704
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
That doesn't matter to me. Actually, I'll post a link in the chatroom.

1705
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Oh, there you go.

1706
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Either way.

1707
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:58,000
And you can actually take a look at Raichan's Bomani collection. It's quite impressive.

1708
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Her Bomani penis is quite large.

1709
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Well, um, I got rid of my Papa Music controller. I sold it to Angel.

1710
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:12,500
However, I still have seven, which I'll give to Jason, and then nine most likely I'll sell.

1711
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:14,000
I'll buy it from you.

1712
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,500
Okay.

1713
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:18,500
I have a Poppa Music controller and a Poppa Music.

1714
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:24,500
Um, yeah. I sold my controller recently, so I still have seven and nine sitting around

1715
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:26,500
just because I didn't know anyone else to sell it to.

1716
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:28,500
I borrowed that controller too, which is funny.

1717
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:32,500
If you want to sell any Poppa Music you have that you want to sell, you've got to buy it right here

1718
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:33,500
because I need Poppa Music.

1719
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:35,000
Alright. Cool.

1720
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,320
Wow, boy! Not only do you get people to buy

1721
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:42,240
your new stuff for you, but you get people to buy your old shit, too. I mean,

1722
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:48,320
God! And Jason wants me to post a picture of him and I, which I'll go find the link to.

1723
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:53,400
Aww, he wants to be mushy. We have a picture of him and I both

1724
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:57,880
with our entire Bimani collections. Oh, that is so nauseatingly cute.

1725
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:01,560
What did you think of his chicken hat?

1726
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:05,560
What did you think of the chicken hat picture I took at E3?

1727
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:09,560
Well you saw that I used that as one of my LiveJournal user pictures.

1728
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:13,560
I just had to bring that up because I love that picture. We were like, you have to wear the chicken hat.

1729
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:17,560
Hug the cow.

1730
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:21,560
You need to come up and visit us next. Wait, did you and Jason actually meet

1731
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:25,560
through Bamani? Um, DDR Freak and LiveJournal pretty much.

1732
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:29,560
Wow, that's kind of cool. Look at that, DDR Freak brings people

1733
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:32,560
It not only tears people apart, but it brings them together as well.

1734
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:33,560
There you go.

1735
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:35,560
You know, the internet is a good place to meet people.

1736
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:40,560
I think the internet gets a bad rap sometimes. It can't be a good place to meet people.

1737
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:41,560
I met Dan online.

1738
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:42,560
There you go.

1739
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:43,560
Through fandom.

1740
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:47,560
Anything else you want to comment on, Rychan?

1741
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:51,560
Not really, just calling to say hi since I finally have everything set up.

1742
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:54,560
Well, hello and thank you for the call and enjoy DR Festival when it comes out.

1743
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:58,560
Let us know how it is since none of us are probably even going to bother to get it.

1744
02:17:58,560 --> 02:18:05,560
to be our reviewer. Okay. Alright. Thank you guys. Alright, take care. Bye. Thanks for

1745
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:10,480
the call. Oh, that was so nice. We got some comments in the chatroom that she's clearer

1746
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:15,320
than we are. Her microphone's better than ours. We need to know what kind of microphone

1747
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:20,760
she's got. Seriously. Right, Chenny, you're going to have to like send me an email. Rob

1748
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:24,160
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. If you ever want to send me an email, if you're a stalker fan

1749
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:28,100
wants to send me an email, that's fine. Rob at OrangeLongeRider.com. It's a good place

1750
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:33,140
to go. Okay, I guess we're gonna close up the Skype line because I want to do a

1751
02:18:33,140 --> 02:18:37,060
break because we got to come back. We have to do the FUs of the week. That's

1752
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:41,940
our favorite part. We got to do them. So send your FUs in now and in this break

1753
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:47,260
we're gonna hear some keyboard mania music. Yeah, I knew that would be the

1754
02:18:47,260 --> 02:18:53,200
first word out of your mouth, Jamie. I love sensation. Play sensation. So it's the first thing I have

1755
02:18:53,200 --> 02:19:00,200
queued up for ya. So here we go, a whole break of keyboard mania music. Enjoy, we'll be back.

1756
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,300
.

1757
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:29,300
.

1758
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:32,400
.

1759
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:35,440
.

1760
02:20:35,440 --> 02:20:38,440
.

1761
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:41,440
.

1762
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:44,480
.

1763
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:47,480
.

1764
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:50,520
.

1765
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:46,800
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1766
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:47,800
We are back.

1767
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:50,000
What the hell are you laughing at over there?

1768
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:55,580
is funny. I'm laughing at DJ Nostalgia's icon. On DJ

1769
02:25:55,580 --> 02:25:58,520
Armaniacs, it's this little stick figure trying to pick up a flower to give it to

1770
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:01,880
the, you know, female stick figure, but the flower keeps moving so then he

1771
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:04,580
finally gets pissed off and kicks the flower and it hits the chick in the head

1772
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:14,000
and she runs off. Funny. Hilarious. That's all I have to say. Alright, well, the theme of

1773
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,000
tonight has kind of been like being dead, I guess, because you guys have all been

1774
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:22,760
dead so we decided we're gonna pick things up a little bit with some good

1775
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:27,960
old-fashioned f-u's Jamie why do we have to do some good old-fashioned f-u's

1776
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:32,000
anyway you're full of angst and anger and if we don't let it out will explode

1777
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:49,040
didn't destroy half of the world.

1778
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:54,040
My first epi of the evening goes to the driver of this Volkswagen Passat that was in front

1779
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:55,040
of me.

1780
02:26:55,040 --> 02:27:00,720
First of all, I normally give the thumbs up to good German engineering, but these are

1781
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:04,800
cars that are meant to be driven at 100 miles an hour on the Autobahn not 25

1782
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:11,800
miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone. Another SU goes to me for drinking so

1783
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:17,920
much vodka last night and you know I will say whatever is on my mind while I

1784
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:25,880
am drunk and I got very flirty so SU to my lack of restraint while I'm

1785
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:40,000
while I'm intoxicated. Another F.U. goes toward this particular bit of software that I've

1786
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:46,080
acquired that requires a certain thing to make said software work. So now I can't use

1787
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:52,200
it. A big, humongous, whopping F.U. goes to freakin' PaintShop Pro 8 for not letting

1788
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:59,480
me change the size of my brush because I want to go and do little fine detailed work and

1789
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:04,720
go edit out backgrounds and stuff so that I can have transparencies and a stupid brush

1790
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:06,920
will not let me change the damn size of it.

1791
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:09,440
Photoshop is ass, okay?

1792
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:14,080
I do not like Photoshop, even though I'm going to have to take a class in it, but that means

1793
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:17,280
that I'm going to have to go back to using PaintShop Pro 7, except PaintShop Pro 8

1794
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:23,820
it has some really good filters in it but um and also if you to the potential

1795
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:28,100
class I have to take in Photoshop even though I don't care for Photoshop all

1796
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:31,560
that much except it does have also really nice filters and I like the way

1797
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:38,500
it does layers better but and if you goes toward another thing about Paint

1798
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:43,060
Shop Pro 8 for not letting me freaking rotate my text in a curve the way I want

1799
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:48,940
too. It's doing some weird vector thing that's really pissing me off. So that means that

1800
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:56,940
I have to do 10 sideshow posters for Halloween by hand. I have to ink them and then color

1801
02:28:56,940 --> 02:29:03,340
them on the computer. At least I can do some neat stuff to it and make it look cool once

1802
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:07,700
I have drawn it and scanned it. And at least I don't have to do some heavy shading on it

1803
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:11,420
either. It's all primary colors, but it's just my hand's going to be falling off. And

1804
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:15,560
And I have other drawings I really, really want to work on too.

1805
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:21,840
So as it stands, I'm just going to have to, I guess, find some time.

1806
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:25,120
At least I've done all the homework for one of my classes, but.

1807
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:32,080
Oh yeah, and another F.U. toward not having my Copic markers anymore, because I finally,

1808
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:35,240
three of my Copic markers dried out, and that means I have to go pay another twenty bucks

1809
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:38,920
to get another set, so.

1810
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:43,560
And also just an F.U. to the Color Copics for being so damn expensive anyway.

1811
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:49,720
I mean, true, you're paying for quality and alcohol-based ink, but, ugh, so expensive.

1812
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:53,200
And I'm retracting an F.U. this week to Dell.

1813
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:57,280
Whoa, is that a first, that you're retracting an F.U.?

1814
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,280
Oh, alright.

1815
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:02,960
Because I was all pissed off because I didn't think Dell was sending my computer, my laptop.

1816
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:08,600
And then I got the notice yesterday, they weren't going to ship my laptop until like

1817
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:10,020
mid-october

1818
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:12,380
my laptop shipped thursday

1819
02:30:12,380 --> 02:30:14,780
so next week i will be here with my laptop well if

1820
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:15,740
if i'm here next week

1821
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:17,360
i'll be here with my laptop

1822
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:20,640
yeah we're probably not gonna be here next week but yeah we have obligations

1823
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:21,540
but um...

1824
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:23,060
regardless

1825
02:30:23,060 --> 02:30:25,840
i'm gonna have my laptop

1826
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:29,600
and that will make me a happy bunny

1827
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:31,040
happy happy bunny

1828
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:32,680
a one final f u

1829
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:35,100
to my happy bunny t-shirt

1830
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:38,380
and my happy bunny t-shirt had pink fuzzy fur on it

1831
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:41,460
And now he looks like he's got a goatee over his belly.

1832
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:43,940
It's cause it's like the bottom of his mouth

1833
02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:45,540
is like by his belly.

1834
02:30:45,540 --> 02:30:47,980
So he looks like he's just got

1835
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:49,540
bad chest hair.

1836
02:30:49,540 --> 02:30:52,820
And like the rest of them is rub all raw.

1837
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:55,840
Another F you goes to Rob's cell phone.

1838
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:59,140
It should be on silent while we're on the show.

1839
02:30:59,140 --> 02:31:02,300
Sorry. Yeah.

1840
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:05,060
And that's it. I'm spent.

1841
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:11,060
Let's move on to Loki and see what he's pissed off about this time.

1842
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:15,060
Well, first off I'm gonna be pissed off at my toe because I just

1843
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:16,860
squeezed it really hard in this big

1844
02:31:16,860 --> 02:31:19,160
pussy clump thing

1845
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:20,780
I was, but

1846
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:24,880
I need to let it dry out because before, you know, with a band-aid it just stays wet.

1847
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,540
I don't have any gauze.

1848
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:30,380
So anyways, I squeezed this big clump of whatever out because it looked like it was

1849
02:31:30,380 --> 02:31:33,980
pussying a little bit so I was like seeing how bad it was.

1850
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:38,980
But it wasn't that, it was like some of the gauze that was left over from the other thing I hadn't pulled out.

1851
02:31:38,980 --> 02:31:44,980
It was in the hole where they pulled the nail out, and that didn't feel too good.

1852
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:48,980
But it feels better now that it's full of Neosporin.

1853
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:52,980
And the other side's doing the same thing, so I think I gotta squeeze a little harder there, but that's kinda gross.

1854
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:55,980
Anyways, um, so fuck you that, cause that sucks.

1855
02:31:55,980 --> 02:32:00,980
Um, fuck you to stupid people yesterday, I swear to God, everyone was trying to kill me.

1856
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:07,980
And it's because the really shitty drivers out there driving too slow, not looking when they change lanes, and just, you know, blatantly trying to kill me.

1857
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:10,980
So fuck you because you failed, I'm still here.

1858
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:17,980
Fuck you to denios for sucking. I never realized how many cell phone case booths there could be in one place.

1859
02:32:17,980 --> 02:32:28,980
I mean, I didn't really need a cell phone case, or a new faceplate because there's tons of those faceplate booths, nor did I need any used underwear, or samurai swords! I swear to God!

1860
02:32:28,980 --> 02:32:34,580
to god this is places like we have power tools we have bungee cords and we have samurai swords

1861
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:41,460
where the hell did that fit in that's just weird hey i thought i bought some korean pop speed either

1862
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:47,380
okay that's cool but that was the only like cool thing that was there i walked around that it's

1863
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:52,900
just it's not the same anymore it's like we win it around two to three o'clock i mean that is not

1864
02:32:52,900 --> 02:32:58,900
very early but it's not late in the day I mean and there was already half the

1865
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:02,560
people that already packed up and left in fact they were closing the fucking

1866
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:07,480
you know food vending booths down at three and they closed at five like what

1867
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:11,620
the fuck two hours early that's a little ridiculous but whatever so they were

1868
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:17,400
doing that and that was really lame and wasted my time but also fuck you to

1869
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:21,920
shark's tail because it was kind of lame but I went and saw it for free so that

1870
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:27,720
wasn't that lame but it just still sucked and I it was a waste of my time

1871
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:36,440
and finally just you know I don't really know I have a lot more stuff earlier this

1872
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:41,160
week and I just cannot remember it for the life of me now fuck you to goddamn

1873
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:46,000
roundtable today okay now I bought a personal pizza and twist their twist are

1874
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,700
fucking huge if I knew they're fucking huge I would just bought the twist but

1875
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:53,260
not only that they didn't cook them all the way through they were damn good so I

1876
02:33:53,260 --> 02:34:02,580
ate them all but I had to take a very bad shit when I got home so at least it

1877
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:06,140
felt like it it wasn't it was just you know it's just you know one of those

1878
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:11,180
things like urgent emergency you know that's not a feeling I want to have

1879
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:15,340
after you know eating at round table cuz I love round table and I was it was

1880
02:34:15,340 --> 02:34:18,140
ironic because I was telling a story about how I used to make twists out of

1881
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:22,460
large pizza skin that were like a good you know three feet long when you're done with

1882
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:29,260
them which is awesome but i don't know they're still good though but um except for that Nephew

1883
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:33,820
Comedy Central we're playing Dogma yet again my god i don't like need to see that movie anymore

1884
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:43,500
it's just at least you have cable trust me you're not missing anything and i'm done

1885
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:49,500
I'm trying out a new F.U. song tonight. I don't know how it'll work, but I want something new.

1886
02:34:51,500 --> 02:34:53,500
You're not allowed to have anything you love.

1887
02:34:54,500 --> 02:35:03,500
I would like to give an F.U. to that person I was already giving F.U.s to earlier who just made themselves look like an ass.

1888
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:10,500
I want to give an F.U. to myself for having a little bit too much to drink last night

1889
02:35:10,500 --> 02:35:13,500
and kind of forcing myself to stay in Chico until really late.

1890
02:35:13,500 --> 02:35:16,500
Although actually I had a really good time so I have absolutely nothing to be bitching about

1891
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:21,500
but I need to learn to say no to drinking a lot better.

1892
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,500
Because I'm going to get myself in trouble some time. What?

1893
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:25,500
Just say no.

1894
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:34,500
And then I want to give an F.U. to Unnecessary Drummer and people that get off on perpetuating other people's trauma.

1895
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:46,500
And I really, actually I think I had like a pretty good week, all things considered, to be honest, so I don't have like a whole bunch to give F.U.s to.

1896
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:51,500
Oh! F you to people that make fun of my name on Ultramix.

1897
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:54,500
Like, I freakin' join games on Ultramix and people are like,

1898
02:35:54,500 --> 02:35:56,500
It's Green Ski!

1899
02:35:56,500 --> 02:36:01,500
First of all, it's Green Sky, but since you don't know how to read, I'll forgive you.

1900
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:05,500
But, it's just like, you know, and then I go and kick your ass.

1901
02:36:05,500 --> 02:36:10,500
And you're like, you know, you just tell me I'm on a controller or something, even though I'm not.

1902
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:12,500
I'm actually on a dance pad.

1903
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:19,460
And um, just in general, retards. Not actual people who are actually retarded, I mean there's

1904
02:36:19,460 --> 02:36:23,300
nothing they can do about it, but I mean people who act retarded and they have no reason to

1905
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:31,980
be. Is it, is it F you related? Okay, Loki has something F you related. Fuck you in the

1906
02:36:31,980 --> 02:36:37,220
bush because you look like an idiot during the debate, that's all.

1907
02:36:37,220 --> 02:36:41,220
What's going on, Bradley?

1908
02:36:41,220 --> 02:36:48,220
The only thing I really have to say is fuck you to have to go another month being frugal.

1909
02:36:48,220 --> 02:36:54,220
Even with my pay raise, I gotta pay off bills and stuff, so I can't really do very much for next month.

1910
02:36:54,220 --> 02:36:57,220
But, oh well. That's about it.

1911
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:04,220
Oh, that was quick. Fair enough. Let's go to the chat room and see what our chat room has to bitch about this time.

1912
02:37:04,220 --> 02:37:09,500
Elle Mulletz wants to say an F you to the chat room for being so dead not my fault

1913
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:13,780
and F you to idiots who claim you're a company fanboy for liking their games

1914
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:15,340
and on behalf of DarkSakura

1915
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:18,940
an F you to Cosmo Magazine she knows why.

1916
02:37:18,940 --> 02:37:23,740
Oh my god that's the one I forgot? I opened up Cosmo to read the crappy

1917
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:27,780
sex tips they put in there because they're hilarious because you know they're not realistic at all

1918
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:31,700
and like I'm assaulted by what's the name of this rainbow

1919
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:39,700
out of the ass or something, perfume. It's beyond paradise. And it smells like beyond

1920
02:37:39,700 --> 02:37:50,380
Hades is what it smells like. Okay, thank you. Beyond the garbage dump. Beyond fecal

1921
02:37:50,380 --> 02:37:57,620
matter or something, I don't know. Otaku Rat says, F you to working 11 hours on 3 hours

1922
02:37:57,620 --> 02:38:01,720
sleep

1923
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:05,720
uh... jazz says f you to elderly drivers

1924
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:09,980
for the love of god stop driving ten miles an hour and speed limit also f

1925
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:13,300
you to the people who plaster their cars with political stickers as anyone

1926
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:15,580
notices people stuck out the driving day

1927
02:38:15,580 --> 02:38:16,220
buddy

1928
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:20,700
i'd put a political sticker on my car this week so if you know

1929
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:25,140
kerry edwards sticker

1930
02:38:25,140 --> 02:38:29,140
My mother put a Carrie Edward sticker on my car, actually, and she put it on crooked.

1931
02:38:29,140 --> 02:38:32,140
You know what, neither of them are worthy of my vote. I'm voting for Phil Bikat again.

1932
02:38:32,140 --> 02:38:38,140
Well, I don't want Bush to win, and I actually kind of like Carrie, especially after the debate, so we'll see the tech.

1933
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:45,140
Jazz says, one more thing, F you to a certain in-the-groove step-file creator for being such an elitist bastard.

1934
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:48,140
Hey, where did I hear that one earlier tonight?

1935
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:54,480
This says f you to all computer image editor programs for not having a way of making a decent spiral

1936
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:58,020
Fair enough any ideas on that. I

1937
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:02,420
Don't I haven't ever had to make a spiral so

1938
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:10,900
Actually, yeah, you can do one in PaintShop Pro using the the twist like you do a straight line from the center

1939
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:15,340
And then do the twist warp and that should work you can save it as a paintbrush

1940
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:50,340
It's banned from anywhere. It's good news. I just told Jamie what it was. I was doing sign language to Jamie.

1941
02:39:50,340 --> 02:39:55,340
Oh! I have choice words that I'm not going to say.

1942
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:56,340
I think I've said them.

1943
02:39:56,340 --> 02:39:58,340
She'll say them on commercial break, I'm sure.

1944
02:39:58,340 --> 02:40:00,340
Yeah, amen, Rai-chan.

1945
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:11,340
Also, oh yeah, he says, oh yeah, to expand on my first one, F you to sleep, making you not do anything. I need to go shopping.

1946
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:15,500
You don't know how many times I've like needed to go shopping and then I

1947
02:40:16,060 --> 02:40:19,740
I'm like I'm asleep and I don't end up shopping and then I wonder why I'm hungry

1948
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:26,900
DDR angel says f you to fellow students in the class that maggots maggots and I are taking almost called a maggots

1949
02:40:29,220 --> 02:40:31,900
That was a total Tom Brokaw moment, I swear

1950
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:39,020
Tom Brokaw gets paid, you know a few million a year and

1951
02:40:39,020 --> 02:40:42,620
and you don't get paid for the show?

1952
02:40:42,620 --> 02:40:46,500
I know. F you to fellow students in the class that...

1953
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:50,420
I mean, I've been horribly bad on my speech tonight. I don't know how many

1954
02:40:50,420 --> 02:40:51,980
things I've said, like where

1955
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:55,220
like my mind was just in like three different places and I've like

1956
02:40:55,220 --> 02:40:58,940
ran them all together and just said things I didn't mean to say. Oh God.

1957
02:40:58,940 --> 02:41:05,940
Angel says F you to fellow students in the class that Magus and I are taking.

1958
02:41:05,940 --> 02:41:09,540
You asked for our help. We gave it to you. It's not our fault. You didn't get it.

1959
02:41:09,540 --> 02:41:13,140
We never said you were stupid. Don't put words in our mouths and make us look bad

1960
02:41:13,140 --> 02:41:17,740
when we are trying to be diligent students, just like the rest of the class. Grrr.

1961
02:41:17,740 --> 02:41:23,740
Okay, I feel better.

1962
02:41:23,740 --> 02:41:27,140
For a pretty dead chat room, that was a very ranty evening of FUs.

1963
02:41:27,140 --> 02:41:31,440
I kind of am surprised. They were storing it, Rob.

1964
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:37,120
Yes. Alright, uh, we're gonna do some Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from break,

1965
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:39,800
since, uh, you know, we got a few minutes left in the show, and that's how we always

1966
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:42,440
buy ourselves some time, is to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1967
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:45,600
Huh?

1968
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:49,840
No, we did Elle Mullet's, like, first. No, that was CDR Angel, who was last.

1969
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:53,180
Okay. Alright. We're gonna do a break.

1970
02:41:53,180 --> 02:41:57,040
In this break, 2DX music, because I wanna hear Love Is Dreaminess.

1971
02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:00,240
So we'll be back. Actually, we'll just, you know what, we'll just make it an LED break.

1972
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:07,240
Hell with it. We're going to do LED music. We'll be back after this LED break. Enjoy.

1973
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:34,240
I'm just so full of love that I can't decide

1974
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:39,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1975
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:38,240
When you're up in the middle of the road, you ain't in my life

1976
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:41,240
I ain't living in my life

1977
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:44,560
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go

1978
02:44:11,240 --> 02:44:13,240
Here we go again!

1979
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:20,240
It's time to kill everybody, people!

1980
02:44:21,240 --> 02:44:24,240
You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience.

1981
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:26,240
Yes, the whole Earth.

1982
02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:58,240
Oh

1983
02:46:56,240 --> 02:47:00,240
I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying

1984
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:50,240
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

1985
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:55,240
Extreme Bimani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

1986
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:26,080
have it? Fine by me, but I... I have a question, Rob. Okay, should I start the music first, or...

1987
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:29,120
Yeah, start the music. All right.

1988
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:38,720
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out tonight

1989
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:45,160
on Orange Lounge Radio? That is, if we even get any questions anyway, because

1990
02:48:45,160 --> 02:48:50,800
Because even though people are listening, we already put them to sleep.

1991
02:48:50,800 --> 02:48:57,800
Dear Orange Lounge, Why are we so cool?

1992
02:48:57,800 --> 02:49:00,240
Well, because I'm here.

1993
02:49:00,240 --> 02:49:05,840
Let's get to our first listener question.

1994
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:12,880
Jason himself says, Does anyone remember seeing Katamari Damacy?

1995
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:26,880
I've read reports about it, but I didn't see it. I just beat the game yesterday, and it's one of the greatest I've ever played. Has anyone else played it? I've never heard of this game in my entire life.

1996
02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:27,880
I've never heard of this game.

1997
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:28,880
What?

1998
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:29,880
I've never heard of that game.

1999
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:54,640
p0k3smot42o

2000
02:49:54,640 --> 02:50:01,600
that's fun I will post a link to the official website here I don't remember

2001
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:04,720
this game at all is it a Japanese game or is this oh no it looks like an

2002
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:09,040
English game it's just I was released for like 15 bucks at fries or really

2003
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:12,120
something like that and then sold out and it's like really cool and everything

2004
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:20,560
huh I've never played it though how have I never heard of this game weird that's

2005
02:50:20,560 --> 02:50:21,560
Oh, it's Namco!

2006
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:22,560
Yeah, it is.

2007
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:24,560
Dude, anything by Namco is good.

2008
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:25,560
That's weird.

2009
02:50:25,560 --> 02:50:26,560
Namco, back in the day...

2010
02:50:26,560 --> 02:50:27,560
Why have I, like, never...

2011
02:50:27,560 --> 02:50:29,560
I guess I'm just out of it.

2012
02:50:29,560 --> 02:50:31,560
I'm not cool anymore is basically what it boils down to.

2013
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:32,560
Look at that!

2014
02:50:32,560 --> 02:50:33,560
A giant ball of shit.

2015
02:50:33,560 --> 02:50:34,560
Look at that.

2016
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:35,560
Wow.

2017
02:50:35,560 --> 02:50:38,560
I would kill for a giant ball of shit.

2018
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:40,560
Let's get to more questions and some more...

2019
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:42,560
Not shit, but stuff.

2020
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:43,560
Stuff, yeah.

2021
02:50:43,560 --> 02:50:44,560
It's a giant ball of stuff.

2022
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:47,560
You wouldn't really want a ball of shit rolling over you.

2023
02:50:47,560 --> 02:50:49,560
Yeah, it would kind of suck.

2024
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:54,280
everything must be they're calling it a sleeper hit it's a budget sleeper hit

2025

2040
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:21,960
you, but um, I want to be buff. If you can, if you can get to the track on Mondays

2041
02:52:21,960 --> 02:52:25,720
and Wednesdays at seven o'clock, and actually I wanted to bring this up

2042
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:31,320
anyway, for anyone in the area who wants to work, work out, get in better shape,

2043
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:35,840
Anita, Dee Dee Archaholic and I are working on getting ready for the mud

2044
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:39,920
run at Mater Field next year, which is, they have a five mile and a two mile

2045
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:44,680
obstacle course and there is no way in hell I can run two miles okay I can

2046
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:50,280
barely run a quarter of the track but we're working on getting in shape to do

2047
02:52:50,280 --> 02:52:54,400
the mud run next year and if you want to come work out with us you're welcome to

2048
02:52:54,400 --> 02:52:58,560
do it and that would help build up your stamina because we're we're doing run

2049
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:02,560
walks on the track and running the stairs and doing sit-ups and push-ups

2050
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:09,680
and all kinds of stuff. You're starting a fitness club? Yeah, kind of. We were

2051
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:15,000
talking about doing the, doing something like Orange Lounge Fitness. That's cute.

2052
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:23,060
We really were thinking about it. Meanwhile, I'm on the DDR diet. Rule number one of Run Club.

2053
02:53:23,060 --> 02:53:30,360
No one talks about Run Club! Sorry. Moving on with Angel's question, there's also a

2054
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:33,780
question for Loki here is your new remix done I didn't even know he was working

2055
02:53:33,780 --> 02:53:39,180
on new remix yeah well okay uh what's the status of Loki remixes anything on

2056
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:42,820
the plate I'll reword her question I thought I was

2057
02:53:42,820 --> 02:53:48,900
playing there was stuff being done this is news to me she was asking like I was

2058
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:56,140
thinking have we renamed your last remix yet oh yeah I went with my name which

2059
02:53:56,140 --> 02:54:05,860
was. What did I name that? I think it was, was it Radical Faith, the Final Judgment mix

2060
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:12,060
or something like that? Yeah, I think that's what I called it. There you have it. Rob,

2061
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:15,820
am I allowed to use the controller when playing UltraMix against you because my converter

2062
02:54:15,820 --> 02:54:20,340
is being buggy? Yeah, that's fine, you can play controller against me. But, here's the

2063
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:24,780
thing, don't fucking go picking like can't stop falling in love speed mix followed by

2064
02:54:54,780 --> 02:55:01,500
100. Ah, damn. No, I don't want to cheat, anyway. I want to do it honestly. We'll do

2065
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:08,000
it honestly. Hee hee hee hee. El Mullet says, if any of you had to pick an old-school video

2066
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:13,000
game character as your favorite of all time, who would you pick?

2067
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,460
For what? Your favorite old-school... Oh, I'm sorry.

2068
02:55:17,460 --> 02:55:23,080
If you had to pick an old-school video game character as your favorite of all time.

2069
02:55:23,080 --> 02:55:30,960
The chick from the Guardian Legend. Actually, Richter Belmont from Dracula X. Just because

2070
02:55:30,960 --> 02:55:37,120
he walks around with his, you know, Ryu haircut and his headband with a whip being all badass

2071
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:43,260
vampire hunter. That's kind of cool. That's kind of hot.

2072
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:50,620
I would have to say either the Dark Queen from Battletoads or Chun-Li.

2073
02:55:50,620 --> 02:55:53,720
Super Joe.

2074
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:54,720
Super Joe.

2075
02:55:54,720 --> 02:55:55,720
Bionic Commando.

2076
02:55:55,720 --> 02:56:04,140
Dude, that's cool, because you blow up Hitler at the end of that game, only it's not Hitler.

2077
02:56:04,140 --> 02:56:09,080
Or um, like a random Mega Man 2 boss, because the Mega Man bosses are cool.

2078
02:56:09,080 --> 02:56:12,280
You would so be uh, Quick Man.

2079
02:56:12,280 --> 02:56:17,740
There is no Rainbow Man, go to hell.

2080
02:56:17,740 --> 02:56:22,580
Alright Misty, I want to know what the hell happened to episode 111, did you delete it

2081
02:56:22,580 --> 02:56:23,580
or something?

2082
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:25,180
I've been looking forward to hearing it on Rewind Pout.

2083
02:56:25,180 --> 02:56:26,660
I've never recorded it.

2084
02:56:26,660 --> 02:56:29,060
No, that's 112 that never got recorded.

2085
02:56:29,060 --> 02:56:36,660
Actually 112 is gone, but there was a small mistake that happened this week where something

2086
02:56:36,660 --> 02:56:41,060
got updated and didn't get saved, which caused you to hear the same episode for the third

2087
02:56:41,060 --> 02:56:42,060
week in a row.

2088
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:43,940
And I apologize for that.

2089
02:56:43,940 --> 02:56:44,940
But you know what?

2090
02:56:44,940 --> 02:56:47,180
We have a suggestion for you in the chatroom.

2091
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:54,180
right 2000 said you should be hard man

2092
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:59,420
everyday

2093
02:56:59,420 --> 02:57:04,000
episode 111 exists and in fact to prove it I will play a random moment

2094
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:07,780
from episode 111 here's a random moment from episode 111

2095
02:57:07,780 --> 02:57:09,460
I'll bash bin Laden

2096
02:57:09,460 --> 02:57:10,260
god damn

2097
02:57:10,260 --> 02:57:12,660
bush family forgive him bin Laden

2098
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:16,900
president bush should be killed his entire family if it wasn't for them Osama wouldn't live

2099
02:57:16,900 --> 02:57:21,420
wonderful a dark child moment just what I wanted that had nothing to do with

2100
02:57:21,420 --> 02:57:28,660
video games at all what the hell's wrong with our show we need the random episode

2101
02:57:28,660 --> 02:57:34,220
clip button just like Conan has the random you know clips of Walker Texas

2102
02:57:34,220 --> 02:57:42,420
Ranger we need to have we need to do that I'm not going through old episodes

2103
02:57:42,420 --> 02:57:45,720
Alright, fine. Here's another random clip of episode 111.

2104
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:48,520
Other stuff? I was kind of surprised.

2105
02:57:48,520 --> 02:57:54,320
One vote over Echo Image, and one vote over, or I'm sorry, two votes over DM Ashura.

2106
02:57:54,320 --> 02:57:56,620
It was a very, very close cage match tonight.

2107
02:57:56,620 --> 02:57:59,420
What the hell was I talking about? Tune in Thursday to find out!

2108
02:57:59,420 --> 02:58:00,620
Cage match!

2109
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:02,620
No, we know it's a cage match.

2110
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:04,620
Alright.

2111
02:58:04,620 --> 02:58:09,620
So the episode exists, I just suck.

2112
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:11,620
Alright.

2113
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:13,460
and uh...

2114
02:58:13,460 --> 02:58:16,100
that's it that's all the questions we got that's fine because it's time to

2115
02:58:16,100 --> 02:58:19,220
wrap up the show so we're gonna close the old uh... orange lounge radio mail

2116
02:58:19,220 --> 02:58:24,620
bag

2117
02:58:24,620 --> 02:58:26,060
and i was a close in the back

2118
02:58:26,060 --> 02:58:29,300
or do we ever check the email the old school yahoo email

2119
02:58:29,300 --> 02:58:32,700
uh... i'd check it i'd check it once in a great while

2120
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:39,700
but i'll open it up right now

2121
02:58:39,700 --> 02:58:42,700
Like an F-you for something Loki said.

2122
02:58:42,700 --> 02:58:47,700
Uh, let's see what messages we got. We said, uh, good news, weight loss, 14% reduction of fat.

2123
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:49,700
Have bigger cock.

2124
02:58:49,700 --> 02:58:53,700
Uh, something makes me cry when I am moved.

2125
02:58:53,700 --> 02:58:58,700
And, uh, another one that says happy face. My sister used to tell me life is full of happiness.

2126
02:58:58,700 --> 02:59:00,700
Awww.

2127
02:59:00,700 --> 02:59:02,700
Nothing in the goddamn email.

2128
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:04,700
You didn't even get a penis enlargement now?

2129
02:59:04,700 --> 02:59:08,700
I want to know what it is. Something makes me cry when I am moved.

2130
02:59:08,700 --> 02:59:10,700
An answer worthy of your acceptance.

2131
02:59:11,700 --> 02:59:12,700
I guess it's a...

2132
02:59:14,700 --> 02:59:18,700
Look at this, they have to put all these dashes in here and stuff so the spam filters don't get it.

2133
02:59:18,700 --> 02:59:21,700
Why do you people bother? That's what I want to know.

2134
02:59:22,700 --> 02:59:23,700
I was reading some...

2135
02:59:23,700 --> 02:59:25,700
Of course since I clicked it they'll probably send me a million emails now.

2136
02:59:25,700 --> 02:59:27,700
I was reading some web comic, Rob.

2137
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:33,700
I don't remember which one it was, the someone accepting spam mail because they hate the world.

2138
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:35,700
And want more to come.

2139
02:59:35,700 --> 02:59:42,700
more to come. That was completely random. I'm gonna go ship my laundry. Alright, sounds

2140
02:59:43,180 --> 02:59:46,300
good actually. Well, we're gonna wrap up the show. Come back, come back, come back. Cause

2141
02:59:46,300 --> 02:59:53,300
you have to give us your final thought. Okay. Do it. Final thought. But you can't hear my

2142
02:59:53,740 --> 02:59:59,560
thoughts. None of you are, none of you are psycho and have ESPN. Then just tell them

2143
02:59:59,560 --> 03:00:04,700
to tune in Tuesday since we didn't do the vlog. Yes, I do a radio show on Tuesday. I

2144
03:00:04,700 --> 03:00:22,300
I do pump up the volume on Tuesday night if you tune in at 7 o'clock, sometimes a little

2145
03:00:22,300 --> 03:00:29,180
bit earlier. You can listen to the pre-show, 730 starts the real show. It's supposed to

2146
03:00:29,180 --> 03:00:32,940
be a request show, but that doesn't really happen all that much anymore. People, you

2147
03:00:32,940 --> 03:00:37,260
to make requests. So it said I choose to marathon things and the marathon for this week will

2148
03:00:37,260 --> 03:00:43,320
be Rammstein. And then I'm probably going to throw in like old video game music because

2149
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:48,780
I feel like it. So tune in. You know, if I get bored again like I did last week I'll

2150
03:00:48,780 --> 03:00:55,220
go till midnight because I played Eddie Izzard and a bunch of other stuff afterwards. Last

2151
03:00:55,220 --> 03:01:00,580
week, no last week actually was the 80s marathon which I actually do those every couple months.

2152
03:01:00,580 --> 03:01:04,580
Be thinking of what you want to listen to though, I'll play whatever.

2153
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:14,580
If you are part of our LiveJournal community, the Orange Lounge LiveJournal, you can also put in there things that you'd like to hear on the show.

2154
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:20,580
Alright. Let's see. Loki, your final thought?

2155
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:34,580
Uh, my final thought was, I was thinking of weird things to make remixes of earlier today, and one of the things I downloaded, which I gotta mess around with because I think it'd be funny, is to make a dance remix of the Shaft theme.

2156
03:01:34,580 --> 03:01:35,580
Dude, that'd be-

2157
03:01:35,580 --> 03:01:38,080
I don't know if that would work, but it's just something to play with.

2158
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:43,080
I was just downloading random white label remixes and stuff and that was just kind of fun.

2159
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:51,080
Just because I was waiting for my Simple Minds Don't You Forget About Me remixes to download.

2160
03:01:51,080 --> 03:01:55,080
Do you ever use your record player anymore?

2161
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:57,580
No, but oddly enough I still buy records.

2162
03:01:57,580 --> 03:02:01,580
I got you a record. I got you, what was that group? Guitar?

2163
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:02,580
Wolf.

2164
03:02:02,580 --> 03:02:03,580
Guitar Wolf.

2165
03:02:03,580 --> 03:02:22,580
Yeah, I have a bunch of records. I need to go through my big pile of mid-90s R&B, and I need to figure out what I want to keep and what I want to get rid of, because I'm trying to, like, take that big pile I have that's just sitting there, probably getting warped, because, you know, I have stuff on top of the records, and I need to, like, throw a ton of shit away.

2166
03:02:22,580 --> 03:02:30,580
I have one record now. One left. All my other ones are in Alabama, but Dan and I actually bought Weird Al's Even Worse on vinyl.

2167
03:02:30,580 --> 03:02:34,180
Well, I need to like just because there's a lot of records out there

2168
03:02:34,180 --> 03:02:38,820
I need to figure out how to mix on vinyl and once I do that then I'll be before probably more

2169
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:44,440
Opted to play with the records and stuff. It's just it's hard because I don't know my record selection very well

2170
03:02:44,460 --> 03:02:50,260
That's why I need to like lower it. So I you know, I can you know know what songs mix well together

2171
03:02:52,020 --> 03:02:54,780
It's just it's hard. I don't even know how I would date it

2172
03:02:54,780 --> 03:02:58,580
You know, I just need to know how to learn how to mix that's pretty much what I need to do

2173
03:02:58,580 --> 03:03:02,580
I can do parties, you know, where you just crossfade shit over. That's- that's a piece of cake.

2174
03:03:02,580 --> 03:03:08,580
But it's a matter of, like, you know, being an actual true DJ and being able to beatmatch and stuff and mix that way.

2175
03:03:08,580 --> 03:03:13,580
That's a little different than being a wedding DJ where you just play 80s shit and crossfade over.

2176
03:03:13,580 --> 03:03:17,580
Oh my god, this is the sequel to the wedding singers, the wedding DJ.

2177
03:03:18,580 --> 03:03:23,580
Like, seriously, I could- I could DJ, like, really shitty, like, adult parties and stuff, you know?

2178
03:03:23,580 --> 03:03:32,580
But, like, you know, I can't really, you know, actually be able to do, you know, cool professional DJ stuff. Like, and mix shit together.

2179
03:03:32,580 --> 03:03:41,580
Right now I have a program that helps me with that, you know. Because I can do it visually, but I can't do it audio. So, that's a problem.

2180
03:03:41,580 --> 03:03:45,580
Anyways. That's my final thought.

2181
03:03:45,580 --> 03:03:48,580
Uh, Bradley, you have a final thought?

2182
03:03:48,580 --> 03:03:54,580
Since I don't have very much to say, I'll just read random words from the posters on the wall.

2183
03:03:54,580 --> 03:03:57,580
Redundant, nicer, yummy, pin-up, action.

2184
03:03:57,580 --> 03:04:03,580
Very nice. And my final thought is, I'm trying to keep this short because I have somewhere else to be right now.

2185
03:04:03,580 --> 03:04:09,580
So, thank you very much for listening, everybody. Have a great night. Final word of the show. Jamie, you always want it, so there you go.

2186
03:04:09,580 --> 03:04:13,580
My final word of the show is vodka.

2187
03:04:13,580 --> 03:04:19,580

2191
03:05:02,580 --> 03:05:06,580
Never due to these guys

2192
03:05:06,580 --> 03:05:10,580
They've made them so violent

2193
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:16,580
Ooh, but you know I'm yours

And that's for all time

2196
03:05:29,580 --> 03:05:42,580
Oh, ee, oh, I look just like Buddy Holly Oh, oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore

2197
03:05:42,580 --> 03:05:48,580
I don't care what they say about us anyway

2198
03:05:48,580 --> 03:05:57,580
I don't care about that.

2199
03:05:57,580 --> 03:06:17,260
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2200
03:06:27,580 --> 03:06:56,620
Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, in progress.

2201
03:06:56,620 --> 03:07:01,360
I'm trying to queue up a post-show so I'm gonna give the mic to Loki and give him the responsibility of filling up a post-show

2202
03:07:03,020 --> 03:07:05,420
Filling up a post-show god damn it

2203
03:07:07,900 --> 03:07:09,900
Well shit

2204
03:07:10,100 --> 03:07:13,800
Well what I've been doing lately is I've been downloading some music

2205
03:07:14,140 --> 03:07:18,660
Cuz you know I I did buy stuff. Yeah, I bought I bought music

2206
03:07:18,660 --> 03:07:23,380
But um anyways, this is one of the songs that I bought the other day

2207
03:07:23,380 --> 03:07:33,380
So we're just gonna kill time by playing a BT song because it'll be fun. And everybody loves BT. BT rocks.

2208
03:07:33,380 --> 03:07:39,380
So this one right here will be a possible cage match winner a little later.

2209
03:07:39,380 --> 03:07:45,060
a little later. But anyways, this is right here, Loving You More, the 7-inch edit. For

2210
03:07:45,060 --> 03:07:51,060
those who don't know, that's just like short radio edits. But here's Loving You More, BT

2211
03:07:51,060 --> 03:07:58,820
starring Vincent, uh, Vincent, uh, Cavello. Enjoy. A little bit different from BT. Oh,

2212
03:07:58,820 --> 03:08:02,980
actually, no, screw that. We're not playing that one. No. Better. Um, we're gonna do the

2213
03:08:02,980 --> 03:08:07,780
Crystal Method, Keep Hope Alive, BT's Create A Tin Method mix, and we're gonna play a little

2214
03:08:07,780 --> 03:08:14,780
bit of that because that's seven minutes long and we don't need to play the whole thing.

2215
03:08:37,780 --> 03:08:39,780
Oh

2216
03:09:07,780 --> 03:09:09,780
Let us not forget, don't forget

2217
03:09:09,780 --> 03:09:13,780
I'm going home, I'm going home

2218
03:10:09,780 --> 03:10:37,780
Let us stop the dead men's hope Let us stop the dead men's hope

2219
03:10:37,780 --> 03:10:38,280
Oh!

2220
03:11:07,780 --> 03:11:37,400
and that was fun yes it was I have kind of a special treat

2221
03:11:37,400 --> 03:11:41,260
for you guys tonight for some real post show music. We're actually going to be doing a

2222
03:11:41,260 --> 03:11:50,720
whole bunch of music for my personal MP3 collection. That should be fun, right? Right? Say yes.

2223
03:11:50,720 --> 03:11:54,140
Because everybody loves my taste of music. No, but there's a lot of fun stuff in here,

2224
03:11:54,140 --> 03:11:58,160
so I hope you guys enjoy it. I'm still trying to get like the last few songs in here, but

2225
03:11:58,160 --> 03:12:03,220
I did want to say, definitely keep checking out our website over at www.orangelaundrator.com.

2226
03:12:03,220 --> 03:12:08,580
Next week's show, very good chance that it's going to be taped next week because some of

2227
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:12,860
us have other things we are already committed to for next weekend, so we're not going to

2228
03:12:12,860 --> 03:12:16,380
be able to probably be here live on Sunday night, so we'll probably have some kind of

2229
03:12:16,380 --> 03:12:18,060
tape show going on.

2230
03:12:18,060 --> 03:12:20,060
Look for details on our website.

2231
03:12:20,060 --> 03:12:26,140
Also, I forgot to mention this during the show, but that Akira Yomoka contest, we're

2232
03:12:26,140 --> 03:12:29,500
going to have to delay another week because there's some stuff going on.

2233
03:12:29,500 --> 03:12:32,620
We have to, we just want to make sure we do the damn thing right.

2234
03:12:32,620 --> 03:12:36,220
So uh, we need to delay for another week, so sorry guys.

2235
03:12:36,220 --> 03:12:38,420
And um, that's about it.

2236
03:12:38,420 --> 03:12:42,620
All the details on that will be coming to the website very soon as well, and uh, that's

2237
03:12:42,620 --> 03:12:44,100
going to be very cool.

2238
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:47,900
And um, yes, Loki.

2239
03:12:47,900 --> 03:12:54,860
And soon, or maybe a little later on, we will be doing more contests and more giveaways.

2240
03:12:54,860 --> 03:12:56,740
The prize being anime movies.

2241
03:12:56,740 --> 03:12:57,740
Why?

2242
03:12:57,740 --> 03:13:01,140
Because I have like fucking ten plus cases of anime movies in my closet that you need

2243
03:13:01,140 --> 03:13:06,500
to get rid of. And that's a lot of anime. And I have, like, another two cases at work.

2244
03:13:06,500 --> 03:13:13,660
So, um, there'll be, uh, anime giveaways. Ah, ha ha ha, she watches a book and matches.

2245
03:13:13,660 --> 03:13:19,460
But, yeah, that'll be, uh, we'll figure out some stuff with that later. Maybe, uh, I don't

2246
03:13:19,460 --> 03:13:25,560
know, we'll figure stuff out. So, yeah, too bad I don't have any more porn to give away.

2247
03:13:25,560 --> 03:13:26,560
That I don't have.

2248
03:13:26,560 --> 03:13:31,560
Remember your Make Edit Get Porn contest? That was like the best thing ever.

2249
03:13:56,560 --> 03:14:00,920
uh... but make it a good point that was a contest that was wonderful uh...

2250
03:14:00,920 --> 03:14:02,580
what do you something similar like that

2251
03:14:02,580 --> 03:14:04,520
uh... one day you know make

2252
03:14:04,520 --> 03:14:09,520

2253
03:14:09,520 --> 03:14:11,380
uh... later

2254
03:14:11,380 --> 03:14:14,840
okay that would be bigger than any remix contest out there right now make a

rid of so we could

2267
03:14:53,180 --> 03:14:55,060
do that in the future

2268
03:14:55,060 --> 03:14:57,380
I don't want to work on this.

2269
03:14:57,380 --> 03:15:00,020
That would be interesting.

2270
03:15:00,020 --> 03:15:03,260
Make remix, get porn.

2271
03:15:03,260 --> 03:15:10,000
Alright, I'm ready for a post-show now.

There's no dark clouds in the world now

2278
03:16:12,480 --> 03:16:17,480
There's no dark clouds, only sunshine

2279
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:20,600
And we know that it's not over forever
