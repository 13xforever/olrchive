210405	212787	October the 3rd of 2004.
213508	220794	You're tuned in to the internet's most diverse radio station of all things B-Money.
221855	223876	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
224817	228380	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner the happiest bunny on the farm.
228860	231643	Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, DarkSakura.
232202	232843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
261690	269555	We have a brand new webcam angle, just for tonight, because it's only the three of us, so there's no guests to focus on, so... Extreme webcam action.
269595	278141	Yeah, you get to see Loki and me this time on the webcam, the whole show, and our really dirty work area, which I'm almost embarrassed to have on the cam, but I don't care.
280042	281803	Let the world know, I don't care.
281843	283444	I can't put my feet on the webcam anymore.
285165	287967	You could still get your... Oh, we do have a guest after all.
287987	288808	Oh!
289248	289368	Oh!
290612	292733	That's alright, we'll keep the webcam angled this way, that's right.
293293	296875	Say hello to Arcadian42, Bradley just showed up.
298996	299296	Hi.
301237	305820	Well, we appreciate Arcadian's presence, even though we did think we were going to have a guest-free show, but that's alright.
307481	313304	Alright, well, we certainly have some Bomani news to talk about tonight, believe it or not, and randomness.
313384	315184	I assure you there's plenty of randomness tonight.
315365	315705	You okay?
315825	316865	I hate jalapenos!
317125	317746	Why am I eating them?
318806	322228	Yes, Jamie is starting off the show in her traditional manner by eating.
323149	324650	Hey, I haven't had dinner, okay?
324690	326090	I don't have any food at my house.
326231	328012	I totally porked out before tonight's show.
328532	331914	I ate so much food, I just... I've had low-carb chocolate truffles.
332694	333275	Three of them.
333935	334956	And half a deviled egg.
335456	338178	I had skinny crust pizza from Roundtable.
338358	341520	Not that I'm on a diet or anything, I just really like the skinny crust pizza.
341540	344101	Like, I like New York pizza, which is pretty much very similar.
344121	345042	It's very skinny crusty.
347028	348769	We're about to watch Loki fall to his certain death.
348789	350009	Maybe his portal to hell will open up.
350029	351730	And take him home to his people.
351750	356232	We have some news that we missed last week because Extreme was the big news last week.
356272	360233	We even have some news we kind of missed that I want to get to.
372205	399450	and I know I want to get pissed off at some point tonight I actually have something I'm kind of pissed off about I want to rant about later and well I'm sure you guys are feeling some anger too so we'll definitely have an FU of the week segment cage match and all your favorite stuff when we come back from this break featuring some music from DDR Extreme USA but songs that have already been in DDR before but they're fun songs we're playing them again in Extreme USA so enjoy
400266	402127	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
423010	424691	I just can be the babysitter all night.
424751	425511	That's so cool.
426311	429553	So, come be disciplined by DarkSakura in our charity.
429573	430293	No, you want it.
433314	435875	It's just like you said in the very first episode of Orange Ones Radio.
435895	436856	I'll never forget this.
437176	440157	You were ranting about parents at Golfland.
440757	441358	Oh, God.
441478	446320	And you said, I remember the quote, you said something like, if you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.
448080	449581	Parents don't want me to do their job.
450842	451782	I would be a scary mom.
454546	456848	Also, we got the new Ultramix 2 song.
456868	458189	We'll play that for you at some point tonight.
458349	459790	And it's a previous Cage Match winner.
460131	463113	I believe it was picked by DarkSakura.
463674	465015	Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute.
466396	467177	Alright, we'll be back.
491417	492578	Thank you for watching!
565195	566725	Here we go, here we go, here we go
594329	595490	Thanks for watching!
698474	698995	I want to rock!
739818	744402	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on the air.
759384	762627	And, uh, whatever happened to Step Squad?
762647	764388	I haven't heard you talk about them in a while, Jamie.
764708	766789	I haven't hardly heard from anybody lately.
766850	770072	It's just, you know, I've been so busy that it's hard to keep up with anyone.
770732	778338	You have to explain what Step Squad is, because we have a lot of new people that only started listening a couple months ago, and we started giving, you know, exclusive hints and stuff.
778358	782841	Now people start listening to us, so explain for those that don't know what Step Squad is all about.
783271	792354	StepSquad was established to sort of combat some of the, I guess, more negative aspects of the whole DDR team business that was going on.
792374	795595	It's basically just people who were... Owned you!
795935	796895	Owned you more!
798075	799256	I pwned you.
800536	801216	Pwned!
802257	804017	That's so stupid.
804977	807198	Anyway... Let me back up for Adley.
808935	809576	He said no.
810456	822444	Anyway, it was more or less just an attempt to show some of the more positive aspects of a group of people who would, I guess, embody those type of... What the hell are you doing?
823665	824085	God.
825866	832511	Anyway, it was supposed to be more or less the whole positive aspect of what a DDR community could be like.
833391	837534	Anyway, I haven't hardly, though, heard from anybody because we're all
838354	839415	Busy, busy people.
840155	847659	And I'm going to school and having no life and... Okay, that cover is scaring me.
850081	855484	That's... Okay, everybody needs to go on to OrangeOnRadio.com and look at the webcam.
856164	857084	Because... I can't see it.
857104	858185	It's fucking dark.
859066	859866	I said it's dark.
859906	860526	Stupid cam.
860586	861287	Stupid eye toy.
861647	862788	No, it's not the cam.
863228	864829	It's fucking uploading fine.
864949	867150	It's just something on the website and that's...
867682	870323	I haven't finished the damn thing yet.
870443	873824	It's all of the energy that you're putting into it while you're making it.
873844	875525	What the hell's wrong with my computer?
875705	876685	It's the resolution on your monitor.
876705	877305	My goddamn monitor sucks.
877325	877686	Yes it does.
877706	877986	I know.
898995	900116	Hey, I can't go up any higher.
901177	902358	You need to get a new monitor.
902558	904620	I don't need to get a new monitor, I just need to turn the gamma up.
904860	907382	Oh, fine, I'll do it anyways.
908203	908744	That's fine.
910065	913708	Okay, you were talking?
915029	917171	No one was paying attention, so I just stopped.
919233	920915	It was about Step Squad and how cool we are.
922932	926395	We have a sequel to a classic Orange Lounge Radio inside joke coming up.
944597	946338	My week consisted of work and school.
946358	946758	Because, guess what?
946778	947098	I have no life.
972173	977858	All I do is go to work and all I do is go to school and go to the track and go to the gym.
978158	986766	I went to spin and I was so happy because I was so pissed off and mad at the world on Friday that I went to spin and had a fun time.
987407	988308	Worked out all that aggression.
990900	994301	But nothing really major happened this week.
995361	999543	I'm getting Sims 2, which is going to make me happy and I'll have even less free time.
1001964	1006485	I'm also training somebody at work.
1008266	1016548	And I've got a few, actually a few more changes in mind in my chosen field.
1017789	1019009	Different things at work going on.
1019571	1024373	I'm not really going to go into too much detail about it, but there may be some changes afoot the next couple of months.
1025753	1026133	Alright.
1027253	1028274	I went to a party last night.
1029794	1031355	You know me, I'm such the party girl.
1032435	1037457	But I ended up, because I was just going to go hang out and do whatever.
1037477	1038237	What was the occasion?
1038797	1039237	Random.
1039817	1040878	Just random party?
1041018	1043699	It was like, oh my god, we're bored, let's have a party.
1044139	1044679	Alright, that works.
1044899	1047880	But I was over at Iguana Girl's house.
1048740	1050401	And oh my god, Moo is female.
1052163	1057166	We didn't know what gender Moo was, because iguanas take a year before... Oh, I was like, who the hell's Moo?
1057727	1058608	Moo is her iguana.
1058688	1059008	Oh, okay.
1059128	1060489	But Moo's now in the big cage.
1061049	1062911	And Moo is very happy and cute and female.
1063811	1064092	Okay.
1064232	1065933	Which is going to be fun when she starts laying eggs.
1067795	1068935	Because they lay eggs like chickens.
1070857	1072198	Anyway, um...
1072825	1076387	I decided that because everybody was having... Oh my god, that was so creepy.
1076927	1077127	What?
1077227	1079689	The webcam, he had it pointed down the hall and it turned red.
1079729	1081469	It made me think of Silent Hill 4.
1081509	1084271	Back to what I was saying.
1085491	1089433	I just decided that I was going to participate and, you know, not be a pooper.
1089473	1094476	So I had 12 jello shots.
1097638	1100859	Remember kids, Orange Lounge Radio wants you to drink responsibly.
1101540	1102360	I didn't drive.
1103390	1108552	I called Dan and said... See, that's the classic double standard I love about this culture.
1108592	1112493	It's always, you know, be sure that if you drive, you drink responsibly.
1112593	1114954	Now, if you didn't drive, get fucked up.
1115054	1115674	Nobody cares.
1115814	1116814	You just get fucked up.
1116894	1117655	It's your liver.
1118815	1121876	Once you got your keys in the bowl, you can get fucked up.
1122476	1123576	My keys were in my purse.
1123636	1124137	I knew better.
1124957	1129438	But I ended up having 12 Jell-O shots because it was all low-carb stuff.
1130118	1131699	So vodka is low-carb.
1133647	1136388	We had it with sugar-free jello, so I had 12 of them.
1137108	1142149	Because I have this thing for vodka, I don't feel it until after I'm done with it.
1144970	1156612	I also had a couple glasses of this cranberry vodka beverage, and then this cranberry and orange liqueur beverage, and something else, and lots of meat.
1158453	1160634	I was in happy booze meat heaven.
1163375	1163695	What?
1165736	1168137	That is so like a quintessential quote for you now.
1168318	1170058	I was in happy booze meat heaven.
1172820	1173320	Okay.
1174500	1176001	Please somebody note the date and time.
1176081	1176441	Thank you.
1177862	1179483	We have our archivist in the chat room.
1179563	1180143	That would be at 6.50.
1180443	1180823	Thank you.
1181864	1184305	Our archivist is in the chat room, so we'll let her handle it.
1184325	1185986	Yeah, could you write that down for the next intro?
1186026	1186326	Thank you.
1188310	1195033	Anyway, I also put some more thought into, I'm actually, one of my classes I finished all the homework for.
1196153	1196693	I'm very happy.
1197153	1200775	Another one, I have one more week of assignments and I'm done with that class.
1201795	1204296	Hallelujah, praise the Lord, no more databases.
1204816	1207497	I spent four hours freaking working on a database today.
1208925	1209826	It sucks.
1210326	1214108	Well, I was also chatting with people too, which I thought was more important than doing my homework.
1214709	1216670	But that was really it.
1216750	1219692	I'm going to go ahead and try to get the other one done Thursday ahead of time.
1220352	1222053	Just go ahead and get it out of the way.
1223334	1224154	Stop putting it off.
1224895	1226536	Although procrastination is pretty fun.
1228037	1230979	Anyway, that was my week, my day.
1232580	1232920	Oh yeah!
1233331	1235873	I passed out at 11.30 and woke up at 6.30 in the morning.
1236734	1237294	And guess what?
1237574	1238775	You sound like me at a party.
1239976	1247122	No, I just decided I was randomly sleepy and I just laid... I mean, I actually did consciously go to bed.
1248283	1250985	And then next thing I know, it's 6 in the morning.
1251986	1254388	I am wide awake and not hungover.
1255188	1256809	See, I don't think I would even drink so badly.
1256829	1258251	Well, you should have went to church today.
1259351	1259832	Bite me.
1261173	1262434	Excuse me, I don't know.
1263228	1270072	But no, I ended up wide awake, not in the least hungover.
1271272	1273213	And then that's when I ate that chocolate.
1274614	1290062	I don't think that I would have, I think that I would not drink as wildly as I do on the rare times that I do because I don't have any consequences other than my liver going, I just don't get hungover.
1293834	1297377	Coming from a long line of beer drinking, you know.
1299318	1300199	Not me, I don't like beer.
1302020	1303922	Oh my god, somebody else talk, I'm tired.
1304082	1306384	Alright, fine, we'll move on to somebody else's weekend day.
1306864	1309126	Loki, how was your week, how was your day?
1310167	1313129	My week was okay, I was mainly hobbling around still.
1313590	1316292	A little better now, my toe is...
1317998	1318298	Epsom salts
1333823	1334724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1358311	1359671	Literally, you know what the movie's about.
1360012	1362112	You've already seen the entire story in the movie.
1363713	1370075	And then I watched Ju-On, which is, for those who don't know it, the Japanese version of the movie coming out called The Grudge.
1370995	1374776	And if you've seen that movie, then you've seen The Grudge already.
1375497	1380078	Because it's pretty much, from what I've seen in the trailers, exactly the same shots.
1380198	1380738	You know what?
1381319	1382599	I have to say something about that.
1383539	1390446	Now, the trailer for Ringu and The Ring had all the same identical scenes, and there was a lot different about the movies.
1390847	1398074	Well, the only thing that's going to be different, I think, is one, it's probably going to be linear, because Ju-on was fucking hard to follow.
1398294	1399536	It just kept skipping around.
1399556	1401257	I was like, what the hell is going on here?
1403081	1409745	But, um, my only complaint about it is, how can people be that dumb to walk into a haunted house, like, constantly?
1409965	1415489	They're like, yeah, so we know that every single person that's gone through this house has disappeared, so I'm gonna go inside that house!
1416609	1417910	Save on the, uh, tax.
1418210	1425255	And then at the very end of the movie, they, like, show something that's kinda, I guess, would be, like, a way to ward off whatever it is.
1426536	1430438	And then, like, not even 30 seconds later, another ghost comes.
1431385	1436496	and the woman doesn't do the thing that wore it off the first one and then she disappears.
1437137	1440685	It's like, how can you not see that?
1441636	1442397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1464625	1465586	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1494504	1495605	This is quite weird.
1496545	1499467	But, um... So, that was a cool movie.
1500127	1504810	And then, other than that, I got, um... I don't know, I played more Final Fantasy.
1505751	1507552	And I bought some new CDs.
1507592	1510774	I bought, um... Stephen Lynch's CD.
1511074	1511554	He's funny.
1512075	1515597	And then, um... BT, 10 years in the... What was it?
1515617	1520119	It was like, um... 10 years... Oh, 10 years in the life.
1520399	1521240	And that was, um...
1522483	1532245	like a compilation of his best works plus some new stuff I haven't heard of BT and remixes that he did including Crystal Method remix that he did and that was kind of cool.
1533166	1537907	Other than that, really not all that much went on.
1538147	1544128	Just a little bit of movies and hobbling and still didn't finish the device.
1544148	1545448	I'm working on it.
1545548	1548429	Oh, I got Sims 2 and I was torturing Sims.
1548729	1549269	That was fun.
1549709	1551970	The only thing about that game though is that um
1553206	1554706	It has really slow fires.
1554847	1559248	Like, I started a fire in my kitchen and it took it about two days to finally get across the kitchen.
1561108	1568611	Because, you know, it's cool because the fire department can't come even though I have smoke detectors because I have a motor around my house and there's no way in or out.
1569531	1579434	But, if you're interested in what I thought about The Sims 2, you can check out my review on OrangeLoungeRadio.com which we have reviews for other games on there too.
1582045	1594028	Yeah, actually, Jason and I are talking about plans to try and expand the reviews section a little later, too, because I want to do a full review of DDR Extreme, although I am going to have a mini-review of DDR Extreme showing up in the very near future somewhere else.
1594868	1596589	So, maybe we'll talk about that later, I don't know.
1597789	1599350	Anything else you want to share about your weekend today?
1601730	1604211	Um... I don't think so.
1604811	1606011	No, that's it.
1606812	1608012	Alright, Bradley, how was your week?
1608032	1608472	How was your day?
1609672	1611493	It was pretty boring, uh,
1612196	1613337	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1642469	1644410	And then after that, not much.
1644831	1645991	This weekend didn't do very much.
1647392	1648253	Did my state taxes?
1648353	1648793	Oh boy.
1650495	1654157	Because you can wait until October if you don't owe anything.
1655058	1656359	And that's about it.
1657459	1657799	Right on.
1657940	1658320	Exciting.
1659741	1660601	My week and my day.
1661382	1663924	Like Jamie, I was kind of a party animal this weekend.
1664344	1665765	I went to a party Friday night.
1666341	1670783	My friend John had a birthday, so I went over to his house for a birthday party, and I went with a bunch of my friends.
1671464	1674145	Unfortunately, I didn't really get a chance to drink a whole lot.
1674185	1679427	I did like a shot or two, but I didn't get quite as comfortable as Jamie did at the party she went to.
1679808	1680408	But it was a good time.
1680448	1682089	I met a lot of really nice new people.
1683129	1685050	I met this one girl who was really into anime.
1685070	1690813	She seemed like she'd be somebody who might like this show, so hopefully I remembered to plug the show with her, but I don't remember.
1691589	1708285	Anyway, and just, you know, a lot of cool people there, and we just had a good time laughing, hanging out, and then yesterday I actually decided to drive to my old hometown, I lived there for three years, where I went to school, in Chico, California, which is about an hour northeast.
1708905	1736948	about an hour and a half north of Sacramento where this show is based which is a little college town there really isn't anything in Chico, California except a college and retired people so it's this interesting mix of people but I had myself a good time I never really enjoyed the place while I lived there but now that I'm just a visitor I actually have a lot of fun every time I go I went to this bar and I actually got a little drunk which wasn't a good idea since I had driven so I had to wait around until like
1737780	1739021	2, 3am so I could sober up.
1739882	1743864	But we went to this bar and I just danced like crazy.
1743924	1744564	I don't know what it was.
1744665	1746486	I was just totally dancing like crazy.
1746746	1748047	Flailing my arms about and jumping.
1748387	1753110	And then I saw this guy and this girl were dancing next to me.
1753430	1761775	And the girl at one point hopped up on the guy's shoulders and the guy was doing all these dirty things to the girl and then the girl started leaning back.
1761795	1765017	It was a really bad scene out of the pool scene in Showgirls.
1765117	1765938	Oh my god, I was just
1766599	1767780	The way you were describing that...
1791690	1795774	I remember they played Sandstorm, was one song they played, and I was like, I'll dance into that.
1795814	1799937	And they had played Better Off Alone, which isn't a DDR song, but it really should be, you know.
1800237	1800798	It's classic.
1800858	1801198	Yeah.
1801859	1804061	So, I was just having a good time, so.
1807654	1811676	Not that I actually dance like DDR because that really is not the point.
1814218	1815359	But, you know, it's still kind of fun.
1817240	1818260	And I guess that's really it.
1818620	1819981	I just kind of partied a lot this weekend.
1820021	1825004	And I'm going out tonight to a club again, so I'm kind of being a little... But tonight I'm going back to the goth club.
1825905	1828326	Because I had a lot of fun last time I was there, so I'm going again tonight.
1828626	1830867	So you have to go act all morbid and... Yes.
1830887	1833569	I'm going to paint my nails black and look like I have dead eyes.
1833629	1834069	No, I'm kidding.
1834430	1836090	I'm just going to go have fun.
1836771	1836851	So...
1837972	1841135	You should go to the goth club and wear like yellow.
1842516	1843216	Maybe I should.
1843917	1847019	Go dress like a cheerleader or something.
1847099	1848440	Actually, they'd probably think that was cool.
1851362	1853184	You'd be the evil cheerleader.
1853644	1853924	Maybe.
1854305	1855245	I don't know, it's funny.
1855566	1859789	Well, I know you don't like going to dance clubs, but if you like dance clubs, you would like this one.
1860849	1864392	Maybe I'd have to go sometime just to stand in the corner and look, you know, evil.
1864592	1866834	Yeah, well that's what a lot of people do, actually, yeah.
1866854	1868455	You just stand there looking for it.
1868475	1870557	You fit right in, I swear, you fit right in.
1870577	1875721	That's like the prerequisite for being goth, you have to be able to stand around and look bored.
1877403	1878323	And wear lots of black.
1879985	1882907	At least that's how it was with all the people I hung out with.
1883387	1888572	I remember the goth club, that's where the big hairy guy in the corset wanted to have sex with me.
1890033	1890233	What?
1891519	1892280	We're bears.
1892460	1893040	Grr.
1893621	1897283	Actually, it's because I thought of this movie I saw on Thursday.
1897303	1898904	I went and saw a movie called A Dirty Shame.
1899225	1903047	And for those that know me well at all, I'm a huge John Waters fan.
1903087	1904668	If you don't know who John Waters is, you should.
1905009	1906510	He directed Hairspray.
1906610	1907030	Hairspray.
1907110	1908451	Yeah, back before it was a musical.
1908471	1910993	But, like, Hairspray is, like, very tame for his movies.
1911033	1914555	I'm talking movies like Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom, Desperate Living.
1914575	1915536	Those are all the ones I really like.
1915736	1916757	Yeah, I haven't seen Serial Mom.
1917782	1918323	Oh, you should.
1918383	1919424	Serial Mom's a wonderful movie.
1919464	1923047	But he has a new movie in theaters called The Dirty Shame, and it's a total sex comedy.
1923127	1923687	It's NC-17.
1923807	1927010	It is just absolutely perverse.
1927631	1929652	And I don't know why I was thinking of that movie just now, but I was.
1930753	1938660	I do recommend it, even though, seriously, the last 30 minutes of the film, whoever wrote the script was so coked up that it makes absolutely no sense.
1941062	1941843	Just being honest with you.
1944699	1947260	Okay, on that note, let's go back to our show.
1947480	1950620	www.orangezonesradio.com Click on chat if you want to join the chat room.
1950940	1953341	And of course, Skype line will be open up a little bit later.
1953621	1955881	Click on interact with us if you want to interact with the show.
1955981	1961043	Now, as promised a little bit earlier, I have the sequel to an inside joke.
1961423	1963603	And this is actually one of our new inside jokes.
1963663	1971185	But do you remember a couple weeks ago when we had a little bit of a flub up from Tom Brokaw and he was doing the bukake thing?
1971525	1971585	Mmm...
1974207	1977669	Well, it actually came to my attention.
1977749	1979209	It's actually in the intro.
1979229	1981831	I actually came to my attention at the party I was at on Friday.
1981911	1985612	For some reason, you know, I was talking about the Bukkake.
1985632	1986573	I don't know how it came up.
1986993	1989574	But somebody told me, said, hey Rob, you know what?
1990235	1991975	That's not the first time he's done that.
1992275	1995157	He actually flubbed up once before and they told me where to go.
1996037	1997498	So this is old news.
1997538	2001760	This flub up is like a year old, but I swear it's twice as funny.
2002429	2003190	So listen to this.
2003250	2005552	It's a little bit long, but listen carefully.
2005993	2007354	Listen carefully for the mistake.
2009136	2016419	The president's trip to Ohio today was a bold effort to cash in on his wartime popularity as he tries to push through his tax cuts.
2016799	2020900	The key component, and what the president insists, is a job stimulus program.
2021341	2024842	Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.
2025282	2035206	And as NBC's David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cuts are the answer.
2041384	2042185	Did you hear that?
2043405	2044245	My God.
2044985	2045885	Hold on, one more time.
2045905	2048066	Rob's over there doing the little schoolgirl giggle.
2048346	2050266	One more time, one more time.
2050566	2061249	The president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts... Tax cunts?
2061349	2062529	You are so funny.
2064429	2067790	It's funny when serious news people make big mistakes like that.
2067910	2068190	I mean...
2071560	2072141	You would find that funny.
2072161	2074903	I mean, how many times do you hear the word cunt on the nightly news?
2074983	2075443	Seriously.
2075743	2077965	Who is not convinced of tax cuts?
2082369	2086312	That absolutely has nothing to do with Bomani and it has nothing to do with video gaming whatsoever.
2086432	2088914	It has to do with Rob having a giggle fit.
2089094	2090295	It's really fucking funny.
2090655	2092937	Like, I've thought of that phrase several times today.
2092997	2094138	Like, I'll just be sitting there.
2094458	2098781	I was sitting there at dinner earlier today and I was just eating and then suddenly I just had these images.
2098981	2100943	Who is not convinced of tax cuts?
2101727	2102707	And I started giggling.
2106769	2107729	God bless the internet.
2109830	2113271	I'll post that sound file on our forums a little later, just like I did the Bukkake thing.
2116492	2117132	That was beautiful.
2124675	2125916	See, what did I tell you, chat room?
2126216	2126676	What do you think?
2126736	2128516	Was that better than Bukkake?
2128536	2129837	I think they think so.
2130511	2133272	I'm getting a lot of ha-ha-has, so I guess they like that.
2133653	2135713	That's like a year old, but I had never heard of that.
2135733	2137854	I mean, it was new to me, so I figured it would be new to you guys, too.
2138695	2139515	I didn't hear about that.
2139975	2140896	Maybe you guys did, I don't know.
2140936	2143457	There are people in the world who do not pay attention to the news.
2143897	2144697	I know, I know.
2146318	2146598	Alright.
2149740	2157283	And in case you don't know what a cunt is, because it looks like someone in our chatroom doesn't know, a cunt is a euphemism for a lady's
2159623	2159943	Yeah.
2160023	2160523	Anatomy.
2160623	2161044	Anatomy.
2161884	2162644	Take that as you will.
2162684	2162984	All right.
2164224	2168545	Let's change topics really quick here before I get into stuff too far.
2168805	2171345	And actually, we will do a Bomani-related piece here.
2173506	2174486	Actually, Ultramix 2.
2174526	2176626	There's some brand new news on Ultramix 2 this week.
2176967	2178747	A brand new song was revealed.
2179447	2181187	And the band is Delirium.
2181447	2183048	And the song is called After All.
2183448	2184368	And it's remixed...
2185166	2189707	It's remixed by a couple guys who did a really popular song in 7th style.
2190107	2191388	I did do that in a cage match.
2191508	2194869	And you actually, yeah, you put this song in a cage match one time.
2194889	2195929	I won the cage match with it.
2195969	2201730	This is the really interesting thing is now this is the first, now where was the Orange Lounge Radio cage match based on?
2201790	2205351	We originally said it was like songs that we want to hear in DDR.
2205511	2211353	And lo and behold, we have our very first cage match winning song that is now in a DDR game.
2212100	2212780	I'm prophetic.
2212800	2213141	I'm prophetic.
2213161	2213801	I'm prophetic.
2214061	2214742	I'm prophetic.
2214762	2215222	I'm prophetic.
2243612	2244394	Everybody knows that song.
2244414	2245236	You like that song, right?
2245297	2246039	The one from 2DX?
2246339	2248545	Well, those guys, Svensson and Ghislaine, remixed...
2249309	2251310	A Delirium song, and it's going to be in DDR Ultimate's tune.
2251330	2252011	We are going to play it.
2252251	2255032	The clue stumped everybody for a long, long time.
2255352	2256513	But actually, I'm really proud.
2256593	2259955	One of our news guys, Dark Tetsuya, was the one that finally solved the clue.
2260455	2263657	And the way he figured it out was, finally, he did a Google search.
2264057	2269220	There were these two guys on the picture that Jason Enos had posted in the DDR Freak thread.
2269240	2270181	I'm sorry, not Jason.
2270201	2270781	What am I thinking?
2270801	2271081	I'm sorry.
2271121	2274803	Somebody that worked at the company or somebody there had posted in the DDR Freak thread.
2274823	2275304	What am I thinking?
2275884	2275924	Um...
2276716	2280417	about these two guys that were like gay guys or something.
2280897	2283478	And everybody was like... Thunderpuss?
2283718	2285199	Yeah, it was like, who are these?
2285219	2287120	They're like gay guys or something like that, right?
2288780	2293522	And everybody was assuming that the guys were gay, and they were totally wrong.
2293602	2297163	They just happened to be Svensson and Geelan, but nobody thought to search for Svensson and Geelan.
2297603	2299764	So, very interesting, huh?
2302145	2302405	Alright.
2303283	2308509	Actually, it's kind of funny because I didn't even realize it when I was doing the show a couple weeks ago.
2309350	2313215	And I played another version I have of After All.
2313996	2318281	It's actually on the Delirium's best, I think it was.
2319122	2321124	I think this is it.
2321645	2323147	I think that both versions are on here.
2327235	2333377	Okay, no, it's not on this one, but it's on another Delirium CD that I have that has both versions of it.
2337618	2339358	Alright, we're going to play that song for you guys.
2339658	2344700	And after that, we'll play, I guess we'll play the whole Beauty of Silence so you guys can hear it.
2346126	2367787	and then we'll come back with the show but I know you guys may not have all heard this song yet sometimes people look to us to play the new Ultramix 2 songs for you guys so we're going to play it for you guys right now and when we come back there's more news about Ultramix 2 I want to get into this is on everybody's mind this week and I have a lot I want to say about it too as well so here we go this is Delirium with After All
2368427	2369807	Spencer and GhilaMix, new for Ultramix 2.

2673406	2678390	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
2680291	2682213	Orange Lounge Radio.
2685816	2687837	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2687857	2688618	That was awful.
2689158	2690839	I'm going to beat that joke in the ground.
2691280	2692080	Just you wait.
2692541	2694062	That was awful.
2694082	2695383	Beautiful.
2696144	2696564	Beautiful.
2698345	2699526	We are back here on Orange Honest Radio.
2699546	2703207	Hope you enjoyed that little sneak peek there at Delirium with After All.
2704768	2705848	Gonna be in Ultramix 2.
2706349	2709050	How many more songs they have to announce for Ultramix 2 still?
2709090	2709590	Like what, like 150?
2709630	2711671	I don't, like how many songs?
2711831	2715473	There's an ungodly amount of songs they still haven't even told us for Ultramix 2.
2715793	2717834	At least, at least like what, 40?
2718314	2719515	I don't know, I don't even remember.
2719595	2722036	I haven't been, I haven't been doing my math very well, so.
2723251	2726473	But there's a lot of new songs still coming for Ultramix 2, and that's just the beginning.
2726853	2729655	I really like that song, and I can't wait to play it in Ultramix 2.
2729735	2731616	I know you gotta be excited about that one, Jamie.
2733618	2734999	You called it, in a way.
2735019	2735279	I did.
2736099	2736820	I'm so awesome.
2740122	2740402	Alright.
2741143	2743084	Also, Ultramix 2 news this week.
2743464	2743845	There was a...
2746104	2755867	There was a video posted on the internet, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of this by now, but if you haven't, run on over to our website, orangeloungeradio.com, and it's the second story down on our site right now.
2755887	2758188	It talks about the Ultramix 2 quad mode video.
2758608	2759068	That's right.
2759608	2763509	A video was posted on the internet that shows quad mode in action.
2764669	2765170	Oh, excuse me.
2765410	2766190	I'm a little burpy today.
2766810	2773492	Yeah, and quad mode is that mode now on DDR that you have not one, not two, not three, but four dance pads all lined up in a row, and you're dancing...
2773996	2776177	Back and forth across all four dancepads.
2777118	2778859	And this video was posted on the internet of this mode.
2779219	2781340	And you probably haven't seen this yet, DarkSakura, have you?
2781781	2781841	No.
2782181	2782781	Let me show you this.
2783001	2794488	Because actually, what really is causing up a storm here, it has nothing to do really with the quad mode itself, but it has everything to do with how the game actually looks.
2795289	2797330	So you definitely want to check this out here.
2798450	2800592	Let's see if we can get the video up here...
2803551	2805433	Oh, I gotta give it a minute, it's gonna load up here.
2808137	2809819	Unless I saved it to the desktop or something.
2811021	2815607	Yeah, well, it takes just as long to copy it over as it would to download it, so I'm stuck now.
2818030	2819232	Alright, it's coming, it's coming, hold on.
2822418	2829262	But yeah, this is definitely generating a lot of buzz in the DDR community right now, because we really haven't heard a whole lot about Ultramix 2 outside of Songlist.
2829743	2833725	And the game's only like, what, six weeks away, supposedly, from what we've heard?
2833805	2834605	Six weeks away from release?
2834665	2835426	Okay, here we go, here it is.
2835886	2836467	Here's the video.
2836947	2840369	Let me, uh... It's a clip of Ride on the Lights.
2844335	2852658	So look at that, there's all these brand new videos, there's like a motorcycle thing that's all brand new, everything looks like futuristic, like all these new videos.
2853718	2857399	And then of course, you know, quad mode pretty much looks the way you would expect it to.
2859560	2864581	But Rage has a new model, look at that, Rage looks completely different, like he's got like really poofy hair.
2865021	2866862	He looks like me in the morning, kind of, with that hair.
2869781	2871823	and his motions are much different.
2871863	2874985	We saw this though at E3 that all of the characters had new models.
2875265	2876927	And now he's doing like cartwheels and stuff.
2877507	2878708	Like totally different dances.
2878768	2879288	Yeah.
2879929	2882811	Well no, we saw it at E3.
2883371	2884552	We saw Emi's hoochie model.
2884953	2887194	Right, but the thing is that actually this video shows you.
2887214	2888075	It might be the other video.
2888095	2890457	Let me bring... Yeah, if I bring up the other video...
2891545	2896808	I still don't get pantsless rage They need hoochified characters for download I'm telling ya
2920605	2925408	I want to hire a model of Mr. Spanky.
2927490	2928631	Look, Emi's back to normal there.
2928651	2929892	This is a three-player mode.
2934315	2936937	And you see multiple dancers kind of going at one time there.
2936957	2941741	You've got Afro, and you've got Rage and Emi all dancing in this one.
2941901	2943122	Like a three-player dance mode.
2944537	2945698	They're all doing ballet.
2946518	2949760	Okay, we need to like stop coloring them up in seconds.
2949900	2959086	Yeah, it's kind of all these little insane little... Anyway, you can kind of get a... I can't see Emi.
2959266	2959726	Can't see Emi?
2959746	2960147	Wait, hold up.
2960547	2960967	There's Emi.
2961587	2962348	Oh, it's her fourth mix.
2962368	2963028	She spun by.
2963228	2964789	Yeah, it's her fourth mix costume.
2967351	2967871	Kind of see her.
2967891	2969072	She's got a little hat and stuff.
2970444	2972064	Yeah, she did be Hoochie Fighter, that's cool.
2972324	2972985	Yeah, so.
2973365	2980286	They gave her just like this utter Hoochie version of the 4th Mix outfit, and that was just kind of wrong.
2981787	2986508	It was not, you would think it's cool.
2986608	2991769	So anyway, lots of reaction in the Bomani community going on to those videos now.
2993303	3001669	I usually don't talk about certain posts on certain websites, but there was one post that really just got my panties in a bunch, to be honest.
3002330	3010596	And this guy came out of the blue and just started dogging on the quad mode video saying, those steps are horrible.
3011784	3012925	And we all know this would happen.
3014025	3018686	We've told Sigurd, we've told Mel, when they were here on the show before, we said, you know what, people are going to hate the steps.
3018866	3022207	We hate to say it to you guys, but that's the first thing people are going to bag on when Ultimix 2 comes out.
3022267	3023788	And I'm sure the steps are great.
3024028	3027149	They're awesome, but there's always going to be somebody that doesn't like the steps.
3027489	3033830	And sure enough, this guy comes out of the woodwork and just starts dogging on the steps, saying they're horrible for a standard mode.
3033850	3034511	What are they doing?
3036591	3037351	All this bullshit.
3038192	3038932	And I'm just thinking...
3039758	3041339	Get a load of this guy, you know, whatever.
3041680	3042981	Everybody's welcome to their opinion.
3043762	3051548	But then, I found out, after some more posts went by, that this guy had done some of the step charts for In The Groove.
3053370	3054391	And I'm sitting here going...
3055427	3057089	Who the fuck are you?
3057229	3058250	Get off your high horse.
3058290	3059111	I mean, seriously.
3059572	3061614	I talked about In The Groove here last week on the show.
3061834	3062855	It's a nice game.
3062895	3064677	It's a cute alternative to DDR.
3064757	3067540	It's not a replacement for DDR, but it's something else fun to play.
3067580	3070123	But the steps are not all that, okay?
3070243	3075549	I mean, they've got some neat new ideas, but they're no better or worse than what we got right now.
3075609	3076450	I mean, God.
3077093	3078414	I was just kind of like, God, get over yourself.
3078474	3096001	I just think that's in poor taste, because when you're representing a company like that, especially when you've got all these questionable legal issues going around, for you to go and start dogging on the enemy game, I mean, it just makes you look like you had a vendetta from the start, your opinions don't mean shit, and it just makes your whole game look shitty.
3096061	3102064	I mean, there was a point earlier this week where I was like, I'm going to come on Sunday's show, I'm going to take back everything nice I said about In The Groove, because that guy's pissed me off.
3102864	3104305	I've calmed down a little bit since then.
3104345	3106626	I'm not going to take back everything nice I said about In The Groove, but
3107679	3110000	I mean, seriously, what a lack of class.
3110240	3112221	Can I take back everything nice you said about this?
3112361	3113241	You can say whatever you want.
3113261	3113982	I take it back for Rob.
3118944	3120865	I'm kind of surprised there's no reaction from our chat room.
3120905	3122545	I thought half of them were following what was going on.
3122565	3123086	I don't know.
3123106	3126667	We still got people fixated on you talking about getting your panties in a bunch.
3129228	3130629	You know.
3130909	3131789	What did you think of this, Loki?
3131809	3134951	I mean, you're kind of more sim scene oriented than us.
3135011	3135651	So what did you think of this?
3136500	3137641	I don't know, I didn't read the post.
3139562	3141924	Probably for the best, to be honest, probably for the best.
3142545	3145287	I just hate people bitching about shit that they haven't seen yet.
3145847	3147408	Oh my god, they're so awful!
3147629	3148549	The game's not out yet.
3149630	3150511	But I can tell!
3150871	3152032	I have ESP!
3152973	3153793	That's like, god.
3153813	3155895	That's because they're psycho and have ESP.
3155955	3164982	If only he knew, if only he knew, I can't say, if only he knew, he couldn't really say anything, because it's just, you know...
3165731	3166992	Thanks for watching!
3181857	3183378	Thanks for watching!
3202831	3204271	to get this game done for us.
3205352	3206752	I think it's just totally disrespectful.
3207652	3215074	Honestly, if this guy had nothing to do with the other game, I don't think it would be such a big deal because you could just write it off as, well, there's always going to be one heckler.
3215314	3222675	But the fact that he represents, because he worked with this other game, he therefore represents that other game, it just shows an utter lack of class.
3222715	3224916	It just disgusts me.
3225156	3231477	It's not even a fact that he represents the other game because, I mean, let's just say he was the guy that was doing the art for the backgrounds for, like, you know, their...
3232077	3233237	Game, you know, songs or whatever.
3233517	3234478	That wouldn't even be so bad.
3234518	3237078	But it's the guy that did some of the step charts.
3237318	3238239	Okay, that's even worse.
3239239	3242720	And I'm getting told in the chat room, hey, don't put in the groove down because of one guy.
3242900	3245360	And you know what?
3245780	3249321	Like I said, I was going to come in here and say a lot of nasty things about it, but I decided not to.
3249361	3250122	But here's the problem.
3250642	3259624	When this guy who works on the game can't show any class at all, or any sense of respect at all for what's going on, you know, on the other half of the fence...
3260524	3263967	It does bring the whole image of everybody on the staff down.
3264047	3266028	And I'm sure there's some wonderful people that work on the game.
3266048	3267049	There's wonderful people that play the game.
3267069	3267929	There's no doubt about that.
3268370	3271072	But one bad apple is can't spoil a barrel.
3271352	3280939	It's just like if anybody out there that uses an orange lounge banner in their signature, I would expect that you're not a fucking asshat in your post because you're kind of representing our station.
3281259	3284241	And if you were starting to be an asshole in your post, I would call you on it.
3284281	3284782	I'd say, you know what?
3284802	3286743	Don't use our banner anymore if you're going to act like an ass.
3287183	3289365	Luckily, nice people use our banner, so we don't have that problem.
3289835	3295499	But when you're representing another company, I'm sorry, but when you act like an ass, it makes everybody look like an ass.
3300323	3300583	Anyway.
3301264	3302545	No, I completely agree.
3303325	3305407	That's why I have the reason why I don't say where I work.
3307548	3308149	No, seriously.
3308869	3311151	Because I know how I am outside of work.
3311952	3315893	I don't want to be seen as a representative of my company when I'm not associated with it.
3315993	3316573	Right, me too.
3316733	3317073	Same thing.
3317213	3322054	So none of us have ever said exactly where we work for it, except for Loki, but he doesn't care.
3322474	3323794	He doesn't care what you think of his company.
3325554	3332335	To be honest, I don't think anyone would even know about how to get on internet radio at my work, let alone be able to figure things out.
3333256	3336436	They're like, where do you guys broadcast on the internet?
3336756	3337436	You can do that?
3338557	3340437	There's radio on the internet?
3340577	3341137	Holy crap.
3341479	3342099	What's the internet?
3343080	3353305	It's like, you know, when I went to Vegas as part of the DDR Freak moderator trip, there were these guys there who were like fanboys who were following us around everywhere.
3353925	3356486	And I still wanted to turn around and say, don't you have lives?
3356566	3357007	Go home.
3357967	3361209	But because I was a representative of DDR Freak, I didn't say that.
3361749	3362549	I was just tolerant.
3364230	3365631	And we actually ended up losing them.
3369009	3372332	So, you know that, and you know what, does the guy have valid points?
3372572	3380100	I don't know, but the problem is that it was a total attitude problem, just a total, it wouldn't take, you know, could dish it out, but couldn't take it back.
3380540	3383323	I'm spending way too much time on this topic, to be honest.
3383443	3392372	It really doesn't deserve this much time, but that just really, I just want you guys to think out there, you know, if you're representing a certain, you know, game, stop being an idiot.
3392802	3396644	And that even goes for just any old DDR player, somebody playing DDR at the arcade.
3396984	3401926	If you start acting like an ass, you make every player that plays DDR look like an ass.
3402267	3403527	So show a little bit of respect.
3404888	3409990	I mean, it's just like, I kind of frown at some people, certain people that play Soul Calibur II in the area, because they're kind of assholes.
3410110	3417214	I mean, and I'm sure, you know, it's a great game, I own it on GameCube, but, you know, it kind of brings the whole fanbase down a little bit when a couple people look like asses.
3417654	3419575	And don't get me started on the initial D, people.
3424289	3425350	I'm gonna second that.
3426671	3427992	I'm not even gonna go there.
3429753	3431414	That's actually probably a much better example.
3431434	3432835	I can think of more examples for that.
3434036	3434696	Anyway.
3435216	3439399	Hi, I play this racing game, so I have a really awesome car that's stored on a piece of paper.
3443662	3445544	I like in the groove, don't get me wrong.
3447345	3451508	I mean, not just that, but, you know, initial D as well, you know.
3453329	3453429	Yeah.
3455205	3455425	Anyway.
3456005	3457126	I think we beat that into the ground.
3457146	3458146	Yeah, we did beat that into the ground.
3458166	3458586	I have ice cream.
3458666	3460147	I just, I wanted to get that out of my system.
3460247	3461307	I've been sitting on that all week.
3462268	3462768	Do you feel better?
3463208	3464008	A lot, actually.
3464088	3465289	Do you feel spiritually cleansed?
3465369	3465689	I do.
3466870	3467190	You know what?
3467290	3472092	I would go so far as to welcome that guy on our show if he wants to present a dissenting opinion.
3472172	3472712	Go for it.
3474553	3475293	I'd love to hear it.
3475373	3476373	I would love to debate.
3476433	3478074	It would be just like the presidential debate.
3480603	3482785	But seriously, it's just one step chart.
3483125	3487949	On a mode that really, I mean honestly, quad mode, it's cute and all, but it really isn't that important.
3488269	3491892	I mean, I want to see what the rest of the game looks like, to be honest.
3491912	3495295	Let's look at some singles and doubles and how, I mean honestly...
3496218	3499861	Out... Regardless of how you feel about the step chart, look at this.
3500061	3504805	All new backgrounds, a whole new song, a whole new interface, the characters look differently.
3505386	3506287	No more Hoochie Emmy.
3506307	3509990	I mean, there's so... You could throw the step chart out completely and there's so many good things about it.
3511591	3511931	Yeah.
3513152	3515154	I'm very pissed off that they got rid of Hoochie Emmy.
3515214	3516055	That makes me sad.
3516535	3517796	Maybe she's an Easter egg.
3518397	3519278	She's not an Easter egg.
3519298	3519618	They just...
3520979	3523801	You're making the poor CG woman look like a hoochie.
3523902	3526924	No, it might hurt her artificial feelings.
3527824	3529265	Who cares if it didn't look right?
3531647	3534309	I mean, some things just aren't right, but they happen.
3535149	3536610	Like the Olsen twins acting.
3537151	3538712	That's just not right, but it happens.
3540953	3548779	But yeah, if we want to get down on someone that sucks at steps, holy crap, who about the people that made that stupid fucking hands and feet mode?
3549246	3552108	Those are some shitty steps right there, that's what I gotta say.
3554210	3555371	That's who you should be mad at.
3556272	3557112	Screw quad mode.
3557152	3559234	Quad mode's difficult because it's four pads.
3559714	3563017	And the feet mode, man, they did not... Screw you.
3563157	3564578	I kinda like hands and feet mode.
3564618	3565139	Screw you.
3566560	3575306	You can actually... From what I hear, you can actually go in and change the difficulty, but for whatever reason, they made it kind of, like, almost impossible to find where to change... Like, I just found out about this the other day.
3575707	3575827	Like...
3576374	3578876	It's almost impossible to figure out where you've got to go.
3578936	3580077	It's not obvious, in other words.
3580137	3580658	It's not possible.
3580678	3582780	It's not obvious where it is to change the difficulty.
3583180	3584901	Hi, my name is Tina.
3585142	3586042	Ah, shut up, Tina.
3586082	3586603	Nobody cares.
3589065	3590846	I hate banner ads that have sound in them.
3590947	3592208	I absolutely hate them.
3592488	3594169	And that banner is all over the internet right now.
3594229	3595170	So why not do feedback?
3596391	3597212	There's a feedback thread.
3597941	3599462	No, no, I'm not even talking about this.
3599523	3602605	I'm just using this to get that one video that I lost all of a sudden.
3602625	3605608	But it's on like a million other sites, too.
3607750	3608491	Tina can go to hell.
3610012	3611053	That's how I feel about Tina.
3612835	3617799	I wanted to get to this other video, but for some reason I keep trying to pull it up and it doesn't work.
3617899	3619941	Oh, I know why, because I've got to use the other program to do it.
3620802	3621062	Let me...
3625015	3632677	I want to load up another video that came out this week, and it actually has to do for DDR Festival.
3633978	3637679	A brand new video came out for DDR Festival, and it shows something kind of interesting going on.
3638759	3640199	Let's see, what was the name of that?
3640759	3641480	Is that this thing?
3642500	3642940	Ah, here it is.
3642980	3645201	This is the DDR Festival teaser.
3646381	3647661	Now, obviously, we're on the radio.
3647701	3650562	You guys can't see it, but I'll tell you what's kind of going on here.
3651764	3654747	Yay little fireworks because it's a festival, hooray.
3655367	3655948	Obvious, right?
3656868	3657869	There's Maximizer.
3660751	3665015	And look at that, a brand new character select screen that has your characters.
3665055	3666696	There's rhythm, there's blues, and look at that.
3667257	3670920	One, two, three outfits for every character now that you can pick right there.
3671280	3673362	Some people are calling that customizable characters.
3673482	3675664	I call that three outfits a character, but whatever.
3678366	3679287	There's a new guy there.
3679447	3680668	There's a guy named Drum.
3681158	3682859	So do you think he'll have a partner named Bass?
3683060	3683540	I don't know.
3684080	3684541	We'll see.
3687163	3688624	And there's a little bit of the song list.
3694309	3695970	Pretty much what you'd expect.
3696010	3697591	There's a clip from You're Not Here.
3698632	3702015	A little bit of the party mode there, but it's all in Japanese, which makes sense.
3704677	3706719	There's that Feed the Dog and Bunny mode.
3708100	3710642	And there's some of the members from V4U playing on the iToy.
3719617	3722678	And it looks much better than the eye toy actually does.
3725980	3731502	You should see, like in this video, the B4U chicks, they totally are like par-a-par-ing some of these hands and feet things on eye toy.
3732842	3734763	And I love Noria, she's such a crack hoe.
3741826	3744607	Look at that, look, she's like totally par-a-par-ing to clear the screen there.
3746308	3746868	It's so cute.
3747659	3749581	There's Mission Mode, you know that's coming back.
3759348	3762010	There's a little clip of Your Rain, that video, we all know that song.
3767154	3767855	Funk Boogie.
3770537	3773919	So, no big surprises there about DDR Festival.
3776381	3777362	Not right now.
3777382	3777442	Um...
3777932	3777992	D.D.R.
3778012	3778213	Festival
3789608	3790849	Mission Modes in Japanese
3812150	3813211	They have better mixes anyways, get that
3837938	3838579	Euromix, Jamelia, Superstar
3851002	3852483	I've played it on my show a couple times.
3852603	3854243	Oh my god, my spin instructor loves that song.
3854263	3854784	She adopted it.
3854824	3855324	I'll get it.
3855344	3857545	I don't have an eye toy, so I don't really give a crap about the eye toy modes, but...
3874577	3878438	I'm not going to play a game and watch myself flail around stupidly.
3879378	3879838	So no.
3880358	3881058	But I'll get it.
3881218	3882298	I'll get it for stuff.
3882778	3885299	I think, you know what, personally, I think I'm actually going to pass on it.
3885819	3889019	I really don't see the point for me getting it because I can't read Japanese.
3889039	3893780	I already have all the songs minus like three or four or whatever, how many songs haven't been in DDR yet.
3894240	3896981	I just, there hasn't really been anything to really sell me on it yet.
3897261	3901982	I think it's one of those things I'll pick up later as a collector thing, like when it's come down in price a little bit maybe.
3902062	3903242	Like try to get it when it's like...
3903942	3906903	A little bit discounted before it becomes a collector's item and everything.
3906943	3911065	But as much as I want to support DDR and all, there's too much shit to buy in the U.S.
3911085	3911266	right now.
3911286	3912666	I already know what else my money is going for.
3912686	3914607	And Ultramix 2 is coming out like the same week.
3914647	3916428	And honestly, my money is going there first.
3916448	3917889	I have other imports to get.
3919169	3924392	I have to get 2DX8 style and Bujingai.
3925172	3925853	Because the U.S.
3925893	3926553	version is ass.
3929284	3932385	Alright, I guess we're going to open up the Skype line because you know what?
3932425	3934125	We've talked about a lot of different things here.
3934165	3938206	We've kind of talked about Quad Mode and Ultramix 2 a little bit and a little bit of the controversy there.
3938246	3939646	We talked about DDR Festival.
3940206	3941687	Just curious if you guys have any comments.
3941787	3945627	Again, if you don't know what the Skype line is all about, visit www.orangezonsradio.com.
3945967	3950808	Click on Interact With Us and you can see the details right there on how to use the Skype line.
3950828	3953509	It allows you to call our show without having a phone.
3954113	3962020	I actually think I'm going to buy the feature to allow us to call out so we can do some phone interviews later with some big name DDR celebs.
3962040	3962841	That would be kind of fun.
3964563	3966704	Yeah, you can actually call phone numbers using this little tab right here.
3966985	3970468	But you have to pay for credits, but I'm thinking about it.
3970608	3971168	I might do that.
3971289	3971629	We'll see.
3972904	3974385	Yeah, I think it's a neat idea for Skype.
3974425	3982108	So we're kind of giving a minute for the buffer to catch up because it takes a minute before you guys actually hear what we say here in studio.
3982228	3984229	So I want you guys to be able to call into the Skype line.
3984590	3985030	Yes, Loki.
3986210	3989432	I just wanted to point out to Rob here.
3989972	3991073	Three-way and four-way.
3991333	3992253	Now I'm not mentioning what else.
3993074	3994494	Oh, hopefully we get those soon.
3994554	3995615	I just hope they're not fakes.
3996695	3998676	Loki might have something really good to play for you guys later.
3998696	3999957	I just hope to God they're not fakes.
4000987	4002508	What was that thing you were showing me earlier today?
4002528	4009754	I guess it's a couple months old, but somebody had actually written a whole document, like an FAQ, on how to make fake Bomani songs or something like that.
4009934	4011536	How to make fake test location songs.
4012837	4015339	Which is another thing that I think is in completely poor taste.
4015379	4016160	Don't get me started.
4016180	4021144	You're just preying on poor people that are just looking to get excited about a new game.
4021204	4023646	It's like, you know... But whatever.
4026768	4028470	Yeah, you're showing me it's somewhere in here.
4028650	4028950	Some little...
4030871	4033753	Some little guide on how to write a fake Bomani song.
4033773	4037556	I just had to do just running something through a bunch of filters and all this other garbage.
4037976	4039037	Oh, yay, we're getting a call.
4039077	4039817	Let's go to the Sky Blind.
4040097	4041538	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4043960	4045281	Hey, Sky, it's El Mollet again.
4045321	4046562	Hey, Mollet, how you doing?
4047122	4048483	The guy with the coolest name ever.
4049083	4049984	Hey, what's on your mind?
4051925	4055888	Well, you mentioned DDR Festival and I have some choice words for DDR Festival.
4056048	4058309	I have a feeling I know what's coming, but go for it.
4059730	4060551	Well, first of all,
4061098	4074082	I mean, I know a lot of US mixes have been accused of being half-assed, like just piling things one on top of the other and not having a lot of balance to them.
4075243	4088947	I see Festival as probably a perfect example of being a half-assed mix, just as far as the Konami originals are concerned.
4089360	4103251	I don't know if it's so much a half-assed mix, it's just the fact that for once, I think it's just the tables are turned, and we got something kind of new before Japanese did, so this game coming out for them is kind of like when we got DDR USA.
4103752	4104392	What the hell was that?
4104412	4106294	It was just a rehashed thing, you know?
4106354	4107935	There really wasn't anything special about it.
4108095	4118444	Maybe I'll take the half-assed comment back and I'll go with rehashed, but half-assed was the first thing that I thought of, only because, and the way the Konami originals include it,
4119284	4148247	uh... thus far anyway none of them have appeared uh... have not appeared on a USA mix yet none of them I mean the fact of the matter is the entire Konami original selection you can find them on United States mixes already right but but for the for the standard you know person living in Japan who you know has a casual passing interest in DDR it is going to be something new to them so you know of course
4148703	4155967	But for us, for the import fans, for us, it's no big deal unless we don't have an Xbox or don't have a US PS2, you know?
4156607	4157648	So that's pretty much it.
4157728	4163131	For the Japanese gamer, it's something nice because they get more songs that they don't have on their PS2s yet.
4163171	4165732	For the American importer, it's kind of a letdown.
4165832	4169114	But for us fucking obsessive collectors, it's kind of a letdown.
4170654	4173656	But, you know, we have to kind of face the fact that we're in the minority.
4174496	4175277	And Konami...
4175848	4179510	Konami, they're getting three games for their buck here, really.
4179550	4186194	I mean, we all kind of know that Konami of Japan actually were the ones that did the interface that Konami USA keeps getting criticized for.
4186654	4189976	But basically, Konami of Japan made this interface and they got three games out of it.
4190016	4193098	They got the one in Europe, they got our game, they got their new festival.
4193138	4195159	So hey, I'm sure it worked out great for them.
4195791	4196732	Oh yeah, definitely.
4196812	4197873	Very easy to develop.
4197893	4202896	You come up with a basic skeleton and then you plug in the insides.
4203277	4211583	For me, I just think it's kind of neat to kind of have the tables turned for once and we're getting something new and it's kind of like, oh, well, we don't need the Japanese mix now.
4212123	4213824	We don't need to support that.
4213905	4219789	It's the same damn argument that we heard three years ago when it was USA was getting the sloppy seconds, you know?
4220269	4220589	Exactly.
4220609	4225073	There's still some people who are going to spin this into Japan's favor.
4226986	4234272	I think it's comedy gold for all those people that were dogging on Extreme before saying it wasn't Japanese enough.
4234392	4235873	I think it is just comedy gold.
4235933	4245300	It's totally just desserts for those people that just said, you know, it's crap, it's USA, just America ruined DDR.
4245901	4246681	No, not really.
4249123	4251365	This is the direction they wanted to move in, but
4252102	4259887	America, in fact, I would go so far as to say that Hawaii, which is an American state, last time I checked, is going to revolutionize CD-R.
4260367	4268772	Well, no question about that, especially when you're getting 50 songs that are completely new and never been seen before.
4268812	4272835	You never see that unless you're talking about a brand new Japanese arcade mix.
4273197	4276319	I'm going to go so far as to make a prediction here on the program.
4276439	4281723	That when Ultramix 2 comes out, about a couple weeks after Ultramix 2, it is going to be so huge.
4282104	4289429	And it's going to be so... There are going to be those detractors, like people that work for In The Groove or whatever, that are going to be out there going, ah, this game sucks.
4289829	4296074	But for the most part, 90% of the scene is going to just love this game and say this is everything DDR should have been.
4296374	4298696	And I'm saying that there are going to be freaking riots everywhere.
4300327	4303890	and petitions for Konami of Hawaii to do an arcade mix.
4304731	4307533	The Konami of Hawaii should be given all the rights to do a new arcade mix.
4308874	4310055	I would go so far as to say that.
4311536	4313638	I think they're going to be forgiven for DDRPC.
4313658	4315319	I think most people have already forgiven them for it.
4316200	4320003	It was just a chance for them to get their feet wet and we've all managed to look past it now.
4320463	4324786	Ultramix had some problems, but for the most part it was different, it was new.
4326808	4327969	Ultramix 2 is going to blow it all away.
4330009	4339672	I definitely agree about Ultramix, too, especially with the song list is pretty much half revealed by now, and it just blows everything out of the water.
4339932	4341013	And now just the videos this week.
4341033	4342813	What did you think of the videos that came out this week?
4344414	4346955	The Rage Remodel kicks ass.
4347675	4348115	Yeah.
4348915	4351936	And the backgrounds and the videos looked awesome.
4351956	4353497	I was very impressed with the movies.
4354079	4355080	Boy did I get screwed!
4385336	4387758	Any other thoughts on your mind, Mr. Mullet?
4418465	4420586	No, after that long voice thing.
4420846	4421726	Alright, that's fine.
4422086	4423827	Well, we appreciate your perspective as always.
4424687	4425147	No problem.
4425167	4426128	Have a wonderful day.
4427088	4427408	You too.
4427508	4428128	Alright, bye-bye.
4428589	4431429	Bye.
4431489	4433990	The other line was ringing.
4435671	4438512	I'm sure we'll get a return call there.
4438532	4439252	We can pick that up.
4440971	4445233	If you want to interact with the show, www.oransonsradio.com and click on interact with us.
4445293	4446014	Here comes a call.
4446094	4447534	Hello, you're on Oransons Radio.
4450275	4450956	Hello, who's this?
4453417	4455638	You're breaking up really, really badly.
4455718	4456538	Okay, hi, how you doing?
4456558	4456998	You know what?
4457058	4457419	Oh, you're...
4467808	4471071	I hate to do this, but I gotta let you go because we can't hear you at all.
4471111	4472612	You're really breaking up bad.
4472672	4473773	Double check your connection.
4474653	4476375	It's really, really breaking up there.
4476435	4480478	I can't understand you, so we'll try that again later.
4480498	4481479	Maybe we'll get a better connection.
4481819	4485922	That's kind of one of the downsides of having to take the calls online is that when you get the packet lost and all that crap.
4486482	4487883	Loki, you downloading porn over there?
4487903	4489365	Is that why it's so choppy?
4489465	4489885	I'm just kidding.
4491386	4491666	Alright.
4492027	4494128	I guess we better disable the skyline for a little bit.
4494629	4496450	We'll let it get a little better there.
4497032	4504738	and we'll go to a break because I want to get to the Orange Lingerie Cage Match and some other Bimani news that came out this week for sure.
4504758	4506099	We also have other favorite segments.
4506260	4509482	Yes, and we'll open up the skyline a little bit again later.
4510423	4521472	In this break we're going to hear some music from, I don't know, some Japanese mixes, some Japanese songs that are popular in DDR because Jamie really wanted to hear Ninzaburro or...
4523567	4524949	What the hell is the other name of Ninzaburro?
4524989	4525830	Oh, it's called the Ninzaburro.
4525870	4526751	The theme of Furuhata.
4526791	4528213	Thank you, Furuhata theme.
4528233	4528933	I couldn't even remember that.
4528974	4530636	Which is from the show, Furuhata Ninzaburro.
4530736	4531096	That's right.
4531396	4536082	So we're going to play some of these songs, and then we will be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
4536382	4536763	We'll be back.
4555171	4556174	and many more.
4591033	4591815	Thank you for watching!
4724564	4728265	One, two, one, two, three, come on!
4728305	4733026	We are a simulation, a simulation, a simulation
4827185	4828426	Orange Lounge Radio.
4828766	4830928	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
4831868	4837652	I was a little bit of awkward silence there.
4837692	4838113	Sorry, guys.
4838813	4840994	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4841835	4847599	I just got distracted by the chat room while I was trying to queue up the last bit of playlist thing there, and I got too distracted.
4847619	4849100	Don't spam our chat room.
4849120	4849200	Okay.
4853979	4856900	I forgot to mention that actually I was up this morning.
4856920	4861741	Well, I was up until 5.30 last night, and I got up this morning at about 11.30 or so.
4862301	4864142	I started playing Ultramix all morning.
4864202	4870504	I swear to God, I was playing Ultramix for like two hours today online on the dance, playing against other people thing.
4871004	4879046	And I think in one day, I raised my ranking on the ranking board from 999, which is basically as low as you can get.
4879266	4881427	You have to get a certain amount of points or you can never crack that number.
4881767	4886209	I think I raised it up all the way to like 640-something in a day's work.
4887030	4891832	Which isn't that many points, but for some reason today, Ultramix is still popular.
4891852	4899796	I was in a lot of four-person matches, and the people were kind of picking a lot of light songs, and were kind of struggling a little bit.
4901337	4907340	My only complaint about Ultramix Online is that, god damn, people keep picking the same damn songs.
4908560	4914185	Like the default song that comes up when you want to pick a song to battle against somebody is .59, right?
4914665	4916767	Tengoku, if you want to call it that, too.
4916847	4923833	That's the default song, and so, of course, like a million matches get started with that song because people don't know how to change it, and it's just kind of like, I'm so sick of this song.
4924193	4932279	And then for some reason today, there was this one person, I swear to God, every match he or she created, I think it might have been a she, every match she was creating, Secret Rendezvous was her song.
4932439	4932960	It's like, ugh.
4934540	4937001	It just kind of sucks because there's not a whole lot of people on Ultramix.
4937021	4942084	Usually there's only a couple groups of people playing, so you're kind of stuck with whatever songs you can actually find.
4942104	4943865	Why don't you start off and pick something different?
4944125	4947887	Yeah, wow, it's not like every time you start a game with, do that thing!
4949247	4950168	Okay, now it's not true.
4950288	4954510	Just today I played Shiny Disco Balls and DXY in games, okay?
4954570	4955631	So just, you know, shut your mouth.
4956471	4957311	Woohoo, DXY.
4957932	4959212	Nobody else will pick do that thing.
4959232	4960673	I have to show do that thing a little love.
4960793	4961854	Everybody loves do that thing.
4964423	4964643	What?
4965745	4965945	What?
4966065	4966706	What are you pointing at?
4968087	4971070	Oh, Loki wants me to talk about this story, speaking of songs.
4972152	4974234	We just posted this to our website.
4974695	4978939	Even though this isn't directly Bimani-related, it's kind of Bimani-related.
4979980	4984786	One of the ladies from the Weather Girls, Izora Rhodes, she was one half of the Weather Girls, she died.
4985406	4985706	Oh, that's cool.
4985726	4987568	It was from Bridget Jones' Diary, which had a pretty...
5014099	5015981	Pretty well-received soundtrack, from what I remember.
5020025	5024629	Moment of silence, please, for one half of the Weather Girls, Yzora Rhodes.
5028193	5029334	Alright, there we go.
5030915	5033638	And a little clip for us to remember.
5034419	5034619	Bye.
5052572	5053533	It's raining now
5072247	5080817	For every song like It's Raining Men, you get a song like Daikin Kai, which is kind of, you know, it's kind of rocking and mannish, I guess.
5081097	5083199	It's a very testosterone-y song, I think.
5084000	5085022	So, you know, I quit bitchin'.
5085162	5086503	And there's all the taku stuff.
5087204	5087524	Yeah.
5088505	5089286	Which makes me happy.
5090087	5090688	So shut your mouth.
5091823	5092323	I'll give you a hint.
5092343	5095826	The Do That Thing video is kind of what clues you into the fact that that song's a little gay.
5095846	5095946	Tessa.
5121616	5130902	I'm being teased by the listeners.
5131002	5131642	I don't like that.
5132723	5138426	I'm supposed to be proving some kind of fake power over them, and I don't like being teased.
5138606	5140947	Rob, is your journalistic integrity being breached?
5141087	5141368	Yes.
5142768	5145070	I'm being breached, and I don't like it.
5148111	5149212	So we have more Bimani news.
5149905	5150645	Uh, sure we do.
5151686	5154006	I was actually going to queue up the cage match, but if you want to talk... Okay, cage match.
5154246	5155486	Well, let's do it more by my mind.
5155566	5162028	Since you brought it up... You're the one talking about testosterone and bringing it up.
5162108	5163268	Testosterony.
5164829	5165289	Yes, Loki.
5166109	5168510	I'd like to make a little side note here.
5168530	5173851	If anyone's interested in looking for, like, a nice DDR pad, our friend at
5175223	5181910	The local golf land is selling off his Solo 2000 arcade stage, if you want it.
5182591	5182951	Really?
5183412	5183672	Yes.
5184653	5187056	So he's selling that for anybody that's interested.
5189078	5190319	I don't know how you can get a hold of him.
5191160	5191541	He's on...
5192028	5214341	DDR Freak as Kundoggy, K-U-N-D-O-G-G-Y So just, um, you might be able to PM him and ask him The stage is fucking heavy, it is 200 pounds It's a real solo pad, I saw it in a pre-modified phase No, it hasn't been modified yet No, it hasn't been modified at all Yeah, he hasn't really done anything with it yet Just in case you're interested and have a lot of cash Do you have an idea of how much he's charging for it?
5214681	5219084	No I'll pay a dollar Put it on eBay
5219938	5225662	Also, as long as you're doing miscellaneous Orange Honest Radio announcements, I do want to say happy birthday to our cam whore, Misty.
5225882	5226563	It's her birthday today.
5227023	5228464	We also had a weekend a few days ago.
5228884	5229305	A weekend.
5230065	5230686	A birthday.
5230706	5231847	A few days ago.
5231867	5233448	Oh, I'm horrible with birthdays.
5233508	5234568	Oh, Shark's Girl.
5234849	5236770	Of course, Shark's Girl's birthday was a couple days ago.
5237671	5240012	She got to go play with dolphins on her birthday.
5240232	5240853	I know.
5241013	5241714	That was very nice.
5241754	5242794	They were so cute.
5243014	5244536	I want to have her back on the show to talk about it.
5244836	5244976	Cool.
5244996	5245136	Cool.
5246058	5246338	All right.
5247619	5248099	Let's see.
5248580	5252342	Bomani News, before we get to the cage match, since Jamie decided to delay the cage match here.
5253143	5254804	You were the one who decided, okay?
5255124	5256245	I just like ruffling your feathers.
5257145	5259347	Dance Mania EX8 is on the way out.
5259367	5262649	Of course, Dance Mania being the series that a lot of DDR songs come from.
5263870	5271495	Dance Mania EX8 is on the way, and it's going to have some lovely tracks on it, including... Oh.
5272496	5274377	Hold on, I'll do the... God, it...
5275319	5277201	Distract the show here so I can do a ban
5297013	5300694	Erotic with Gotta Get It Groovin', the remix of that's going to be on this CD.
5300734	5302094	I'm trying to think of other DDR bands, you know.
5302595	5307256	2 Unlimited, Maximum Overdrive, the Horny Horns vocal radio edit.
5307316	5308076	Horny Horns.
5308916	5311897	Who's That Girl, doing a cover of Burnin' Up by Madonna.
5312857	5320359	Extreme with Upside Jump, Atomic Kittens, going to do Ladies Night, which is actually... Yeah, with Curtis Mantronic doing a remix.
5320959	5323580	Which is actually a previous Cage Match pick of ours.
5324727	5325087	I believe.
5325347	5328189	I don't think that remix is, but I know that song was, because I picked it.
5328310	5331612	I think it was.
5331652	5332673	What the hell is that song?
5332993	5335915	Strictly Business, I think.
5338111	5341413	Also, we've got... I saw there was another one on here I want to mention.
5341453	5342134	Oh, Wild Side.
5342154	5342734	You know Wild Side.
5342754	5345116	They did Here's This Little Moment and My Sweet Darling.
5345136	5346597	They're going to have Superstar.
5347098	5353002	And I don't know if that has anything to do with any other versions of that song, but that's going to be on DanceMedia EX8.
5353022	5353943	So look for that soon.
5354143	5355584	And if you can't find it, that's all right.
5355604	5356205	It's going to be speedy.
5356545	5359727	We'll play it on Orange Laundry as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.
5360408	5361269	You know who I miss?
5361629	5361889	Who?
5362309	5363510	I miss the Olivia Project.
5364271	5364711	I do, too.
5364771	5366913	All those lovely Olivia Newton-John, you know...
5367853	5368433	Thanks for watching!
5383846	5384706	It's all home versions.
5386447	5390189	Which kind of reminds me of an important question I want to ask on our LiveJournal community later this week.
5390649	5393530	So if you're not a member of our LiveJournal community, you should join it.
5393751	5399253	www.livejournal.com and it's username orange lounge is our username.
5399713	5407997	So for those of you guys that are on the LiveJournal, you sometimes get to see secret little posts and you get to be in the know on some things and you get reminded every Tuesday night to pump up the volume is on.
5408413	5410514	Yeah, because, well, okay.
5410674	5412495	No, it's a great promotional too, it really is.
5412535	5414516	And people seem to like having the reminders.
5414837	5418318	I usually post on there what the marathon's going to be in case people go, oh, that sucks.
5418619	5420300	But usually I don't want them to listen anyway.
5422441	5424122	A little bit of a warning, what's going to be played.
5424722	5425042	Yeah.
5425162	5425622	That's cool.
5426723	5428184	No, it's a good way to keep tabs on what's going on.
5429867	5437291	Sometimes there's a lot of things that they're not quite appropriate to be posted on the front page of our site, but they're things we want to kind of clue the fans in on.
5438751	5442153	For a picture, rather than a compromising position, here's the link.
5443214	5448876	Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
5448937	5457861	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, Echo Image made its return to the cage match with a song called Come Back, and it was Loki's pick for the cage match.
5458397	5459498	And you know what, though?
5459739	5464043	It may be a tricky night tonight because Shane, I noticed, quit out of our chat room earlier in the show.
5464383	5467406	So he's not going to be here to persuade you all to vote for Echo Image.
5467486	5470209	So, could be competitive tonight.
5470569	5471030	Could be.
5471130	5477336	We got a lot of good songs tonight, but will an old favorite, or I should say a new old favorite of the show, will it win?
5477396	5477817	Who knows?
5478197	5479278	Tonight's song number one.
5479638	5481080	Oh, the way the cage match works, you get to hear...
5482262	5485645	3 songs, you get to hear a clip of last week's winner and 2 new songs in their entirety.
5486306	5489048	The song that wins goes into rotation all week long on Orange Laundry.
5489068	5494113	It's the Monty Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we are not.
5495215	5495495	Alright.
5496356	5496616	Cool?
5497036	5497557	Cool!
5497637	5499058	Alright, here's a clip of last week's winner.
5499178	5501921	Echo Image, song number 1 you can vote for tonight with Come Back.
5501941	5502402	Come Back.
5524324	5525525	Thank you for watching!
5584617	5585578	Thanks for watching!
5602270	5605791	All right, song number one in the cage match with Echo Image with Comeback.
5605811	5608452	And, you know, we're noticing that our chat room seems kind of dead tonight.
5610132	5613493	We have just as many listeners as we usually do, but our chat room seems a little bit dead.
5613513	5614314	I mean, there's a few people.
5614354	5618635	That new show, that new drama that everyone's going to be talking about on Monday about Horny Housewives.
5618715	5620235	Oh, God, don't get me started.
5620255	5620956	You know, we're trying to think.
5621156	5625657	Like, seriously, that's what we think about, like, when the night seems kind of slow or a little bit dead.
5625697	5627538	It's kind of like, is there something else going on tonight?
5627578	5628998	Like, were the Oscars on tonight or something?
5629680	5633865	They're watching the news They're watching replays of the debate They're playing Silent Hill 4 I don't remember
5649375	5651336	You decided to go with an old favorite, too.
5651376	5654916	You decided to use Loki's own tricks on him, and you went with an old favorite.
5654936	5655837	You went with Enflo.
5656037	5656497	Oh, yeah.
5656617	5659138	I just picked a random Enflo song because I couldn't think of anything else.
5659418	5662639	All right, so here's the random Enflo song that Jamie decided on.
5662699	5663739	It's called You Said.
5664439	5666600	Is this from their Astro album?
5666960	5670781	No, it's from... I don't remember the name of the album.
5671421	5671641	All right.
5671761	5675722	I think it's from the last one before the Astro Magic.
5676585	5677246	Alright, fair enough.
5677266	5679008	Well, here it is for you guys to give it a try.
5679709	5681831	See if you like this one enough to give it your vote tonight.
5681891	5683874	It is MFlow with You Said.
5684054	5685215	Jamie's picking tonight's cage match.
5685235	5685455	Enjoy!
5753746	5755507	Thank you for watching.
5755667	5756507	See you next time.
5826914	5828135	Thank you for watching!
5901528	5902389	Thank you for watching!
5965689	5966451	Thanks for watching!
6015979	6020023	All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Mflow with You Said.
6020463	6023666	And now we will say what we thought of that song, starting with Jamie.
6025088	6025768	I like that song.
6026729	6032895	I was listening to some Mflow earlier today while I was doing my homework, and that song, I was just sort of like, huh.
6033876	6034337	So, uh,
6035057	6046887	Yeah, I give it an 8 overall, I mean, because it's good, it's solid, I mean... It just sort of stuck out in my head today, and it was better than what I was going to pick, because I don't think that many of our listeners would be quite prepared for Rammstein.
6047007	6048308	Out of hell with what the listeners think.
6048608	6049429	Okay, I'll hit loser.
6049469	6050209	It's our show.
6051571	6052551	Uh, Bradley, what'd you think?
6053252	6053792	It was alright.
6054253	6057335	I started liking it a little bit better as it went on, though, so I'll give it a 7.5.
6058116	6058596	Uh, Loki?
6060858	6061118	Lame.
6061759	6062519	That's all I have to say.
6062940	6063000	It...
6063519	6066000	I liked the other song much better, Astro Sexy.
6066060	6070823	This was not Astro Sexy, and I didn't like it, so it gets a 5.
6072544	6076266	Um, it kind of sounded like elevator music, but good elevator music.
6076326	6079288	I mean, like, I would hope that they would play that in an elevator someday while I'm in it.
6079568	6080608	Um, it was okay.
6080628	6082809	It was a little bit long, but it was a pretty good song.
6083230	6084771	I listened to it, especially in an elevator.
6085211	6086812	Uh, I give it like a 7.5 as well, I think.
6086832	6088733	I think I'm on the same page as Bradley.
6089293	6092855	Alright, uh, let's move on to song number 3 in tonight's cage match.
6094286	6105992	I picked it, and it's by an artist called Karma Club, and I actually never heard of them until I just randomly downloaded this song on iTunes, but I was kind of like, huh, this kind of reminds me of, like, SmileDK, like, but American.
6106192	6108813	So, Loki says he hates it already.
6108873	6109974	Well, you be the judge.
6110654	6113956	This is a song called Lucky Star, and the group is Karma Club.
6114016	6116137	Enjoy, it's my pick for tonight's game match.
6156461	6158532	Thank you for watching!
6182919	6189924	Last night as I lay dreaming This strangest kind of feeling Revealed its secret meaning And now I know
6215185	6216866	Thank you for watching!
6268925	6270527	Thank you for watching!
6313821	6337360	Na na na na na Na na na na na No matter where you are, you are my lucky star Na na na na na Na na na na na Na na na na na Na na na na na No matter where you are, you are my lucky star
6346673	6347153	It's too happy.
6347213	6348934	I've heard it before.
6348974	6349515	It gets extreme.
6378095	6383777	It gets an S. It gets an S. All right.
6384458	6384798	Bradley.
6385698	6389459	It's a generic pop song over a dance beat.
6390180	6389459	5.5.
6390220	6390480	Loki.
6391820	6392961	It's just like, no.
6393661	6393861	No.
6394481	6394941	No.
6395041	6395982	It gets a 1.
6396182	6396362	No.
6398402	6400563	Oh, God, I hope it wins extra bad now.
6400683	6401003	All right.
6401624	6402464	I give it like a...
6403086	6406187	I think we just need to admit that Echo Image is going to win again.
6436031	6442355	And song number two in tonight's cage match, Mflow with You Said.
6443216	6448399	And song number three in tonight's cage match was Lucky Star by Karma Club.
6475457	6475817	All right.
6475897	6478778	Place vote now in our chat room.
6478818	6485440	Send a private message to Sky with your vote for either MFlow or Karma Club.
6486600	6486960	All right.
6488121	6490721	So we'll be looking for your votes there in our chat room.
6491782	6492362	Meanwhile...
6494190	6496451	Oh my gosh, iTunes just crashed my whole damn computer.
6497352	6501374	I think we're, no, we're okay, we're still up, we're still up and running, but just iTunes crashed, it was kind of scary.
6502035	6508999	Alright, um, meanwhile, I noticed Loki's looking on a site about, that has to do with some other Bomani news that came out this week.
6509419	6516203	I guess there's this guy, and he does a lot of music for other video games that I don't really play, but apparently a lot of you people know him, and he's kind of popular.
6516263	6518525	His name's Jesper Kyd, K-Y-D, right?
6518625	6518805	Right?
6519301	6522562	and he does a lot of songs for other video games.
6522582	6524662	Do you have a little clip of some Jesper Kidd songs here?
6525182	6530123	Because Jesper Kidd has announced he's going to be doing three songs for DDR Ultramix 2, which is kind of nice.
6530643	6535704	So, alright, we're trying to find a little clip of a Jesper Kidd song to play for you guys here.
6537164	6539945	Let's see if we can get a little... Just anything.
6540385	6542665	Just play us anything so we can get a feel for what this guy sounds like.
6547106	6547166	Ooh.
6547326	6547446	Ooh.
6551069	6553670	Well, maybe we'll get that industrial music you've been looking for, Jamie.
6554871	6558432	You know, stuff that's very similar to, like, Quake-type music, you know?
6558492	6560533	Very, that dark industrial type stuff.
6560753	6563774	This stuff right here is from Freedom Fighters, the game.
6563814	6564795	That's the main theme.
6566055	6567136	This is another fight for freedom.
6567156	6567556	I want that.
6567636	6568156	That's cool.
6577392	6578133	Anyways, there's those.
6578673	6582616	But what I was mentioning, or going to mention actually from his website here.
6582716	6584997	Let me get to him again.
6586078	6589160	I want to add real fast the three songs that he has announced for Ultramix 2.
6589781	6591322	Istanbul Cafe is one.
6592043	6593283	Red Room is another song.
6593303	6597947	And then this other interesting one, 59 Kid Konami Mix.
6597987	6600669	And kind of the question now is, is that a remix of .59?
6602130	6602550	Yes, it is.
6603311	6603911	And how do you know this?
6606112	6607112	I can't say.
6608112	6608732	But yes, it is.
6609853	6611273	I didn't even know one way or the other.
6611293	6613873	You know something I don't, then, because I didn't know if this was a remix or not.
6614313	6620655	Because a certain person mentioned something about a, I don't know, .59 remix.
6622915	6624795	Alright, then I guess it is a .59 remix.
6624855	6625395	I didn't know!
6626616	6629776	Well, hooray, we get a .59 remix by some random video game guy.
6629796	6630356	That'll be fun.
6631356	6631636	Alright.
6632657	6633217	I didn't know?
6634457	6634817	Shit.
6637463	6637783	Alright.
6639705	6640005	Alright.
6641546	6643368	We will... What are we going to do?
6643388	6644188	Are we going to take a break?
6644228	6646730	Are we going to talk about more Bomani news, or what?
6647491	6648351	Let's break stuff.
6648812	6649492	Let's break stuff.
6649552	6650353	Actually, you know what?
6650373	6651674	We did have a request.
6651974	6654676	Somebody wanted to hear that Jamilia song, Superstar.
6654956	6655937	Yeah, somebody did.
6656197	6657138	Yeah, that was you, wasn't it?
6657158	6658739	Somebody sitting in this big green chair.
6658759	6659300	That's what I thought.
6659940	6666205	But I think the other folks thought it was a good idea as well, so... We'll play that for you guys.
6668780	6672346	Um... No, we're not going to play Never Ending Story.
6672827	6677355	We're going to play, uh... We're going to play, uh... Where the hell is it?
6679799	6680120	Where is it?
6680160	6680861	Oh, it's in here.
6681081	6681362	Alright.
6684711	6685031	There it is.
6685211	6685752	Let's do this.
6685912	6687094	Wow, this is great radio, you guys.
6687154	6688075	Alright, we'll be back after this.
6688115	6690018	It's actually the full version because I don't have a DDR edit.
6690659	6693262	But if you're going to be getting DDR Festival, you'll be playing this song.
6693302	6697387	And if you're lucky enough to be getting the DDR Europe mixes, you've probably already been playing this song.
6697447	6698589	It's Jumilia with Superstar.
6698629	6700812	We'll have the cage match winner when we come back from this.
6703650	6709152	People always talk about All the things they're wrong about Write it on a piece of paper
6732864	6759963	I got a feeling I'll see you later There's something about this Let's keep it moving And if it's good, yes, just get something cooking Cause I really wanna rock with you I'm feeling some connection to the things you do I don't know what it is That makes me feel like this I don't know who you are
6763633	6765375	Thank you for watching!
6791594	6796277	I don't know who you are, but you must be some kind of stupid love

6919955	6922035	Oops, that's what I get for not queuing a promo up after that.
6922075	6924776	We just come back cold right there after that song.
6924836	6925476	Jamelia with Superstar.
6925496	6926256	I'm going to make a promo.
6926496	6926816	All right.
6927817	6931657	Listen to Orange Challenge Radio or not.
6933518	6933938	Lovely.
6934118	6934978	It was very lovely.
6935038	6935838	I enjoyed that very much.
6937058	6938278	All right.
6938318	6939099	Better, better, better one.
6939259	6939519	Okay.
6939799	6942899	Listen to Orange Challenge Radio or I'll put fire ants in your shoes.
6943419	6944240	Ooh, that's a good one.
6944260	6945480	Okay.
6945520	6945880	I love that.
6945920	6946280	That was nice.
6946741	6952148	All right, we're back and it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
6953650	6959518	And in tonight's cage match, boys and girls, it's a big surprise, a huge surprise.
6961130	6962391	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6984048	6987131	We have a tie in tonight's cage match, believe it or not.
6987771	6993296	Which means someone's going to be breaking the tie, so let's find out what two songs the tie is between.
6993836	7004965	Song number one is... Echo Image.
7006547	7009589	So that is song number one that is tied in tonight's cage match.
7009629	7012752	And song number two that is tied in tonight's cage match...
7014745	7015925	is Lucky Star.
7019486	7021326	So... A bunch of Enflo haters.
7021746	7025367	That means, yes, unfortunately, Enflo not feeling the love tonight.
7025427	7028668	But somebody better be feeling the love from Jamie pretty soon here.
7029408	7030408	Jamie's got to break the tie.
7030448	7037250	The Orange Lounge rules state that when there is a tie in the cage match, the host who didn't end up in the tie gets to break the tie.
7037490	7038030	And, Jamie?
7039210	7040390	It depends on who's going to pay me.
7041090	7042151	I accept bribes, you know.
7043511	7044311	I'll show you my boob.
7045253	7045833	That's okay.
7047714	7048194	I don't know.
7048275	7049495	Shane, who should I pick?
7051096	7052237	I know what he's going to say.
7054438	7056999	Don't you want to get something new in there for once?
7059060	7061201	Aren't we a little sick, Echo?
7061641	7063582	We just don't like happy poppy trees.
7065103	7065903	But look at it this way.
7065943	7067084	It'll lose next week for sure.
7070782	7078446	See, if Echo Image wins again, then I can put in Rammstein and blow out everybody's speakers, and that would win.
7080967	7081868	Do you really want Rob to win?
7083509	7084469	Well, too bad, you won.
7088471	7091313	Yeah, reverse, alright, fine, then buy a tie vote.
7091433	7093234	I did it for Shane, okay?
7094174	7096376	I did it because Shane is my dunk fan.
7097762	7098102	All right.
7098122	7098942	That's my dunk buddy.
7098962	7100263	That was a good cliffhanger, Jamie.
7100523	7101563	I applaud you for that one.
7101723	7102823	That's because I'm awesome.
7103623	7105024	Everybody wishes they were cool like me.
7105324	7106644	All right.
7106784	7110425	Echo Image wins a nice cage match by a whopping... Oh, that's so sweet.
7112325	7114245	You had their hearts racing for a minute there.
7118046	7124448	And you know what's going to happen the minute that that song gets bumped out of the cage match is that somebody's going to put in that never-ending story make.
7124468	7126168	So we'll have Echo Image for the rest of our lives.
7127932	7129833	I already know Loki's planning on doing it.
7131234	7131554	Liar.
7133596	7134016	Alright.
7136197	7137078	More Bomani news.
7137760	7139160	There's a couple other Bomani games.
7139741	7141181	They've kind of slipped under the cracks.
7141221	7143621	We haven't talked about them a whole lot.
7143681	7146442	Tokyo Game Show happened this last week.
7146462	7147802	We talked about DDR Festival.
7147902	7149303	They had a new movie that showed there.
7149423	7150963	It showed the character customization.
7150983	7153144	It showed us a little more what was going on with DDR Festival.
7153924	7161266	Also coming out was some more information on Poppin' Music and Beatmania 2DX.
7161566	7166507	Apparently they had some folks that were actually doing a performance there at Tokyo Game Show.
7166943	7167384	VJTA-K Slake
7189031	7196995	and LED vs. Slake was performing, which kind of gives you a hint that, gee, I wonder if there's going to be an 8th consumer style song like that.
7197656	7204059	And, let's see, there was a song called Human Scramble from the anime A Human Crossing.
7204159	7211202	I guess it was something performed by Aki Asahina.
7214124	7214604	I don't know.
7215064	7215725	I'm so white.
7215765	7216925	I'm sorry, boys and girls.
7217766	7218086	Try that.
7218948	7221449	Aki Asahina No, I'm going to have the 8th style
7238311	7245997	There's a group called Guzzle that performed, and they did a song called The Bottom of Same Sky and a song called Egoist, which is going to be in Poppin' Music 10.
7246978	7251182	And the full version of Egoist is going to show up on the Poppin' Music 10 Limited Edition.
7251742	7257787	So lots of fun news there for Poppin' Music 10 and 2DX8 style as well.
7257847	7264433	And then Sana and Togo were there, and they performed a song called Custom Made Girl Not For Sale.
7265543	7266504	Dude, that's awesome.
7266664	7267886	That's the best song name ever.
7267966	7272051	It sounds very much like a poppin' music song, but we don't really know which way it's going yet.
7272712	7277778	And then a song called Everyday Lovely Day, which is going to be on the Poppin' Music 10 consumer style.
7277838	7282064	And then a remixed version by LED is going to be in 2DX8 style.
7282734	7291900	So lots of new stuff coming out on these two soundtracks, Poppin' Music 10 and 2DXA Style, as well as in the games that are coming out November 18th.
7291920	7292800	We love LED.
7293260	7293441	Yes.
7294021	7295782	We love LED and groovy.
7296743	7298764	Why does this stuff all have to come out at the same time?
7298824	7299344	That's the problem.
7299364	7300004	I got no money.
7300165	7300605	I'm Poe.
7301005	7304127	Because they want to get as much money from us as possible.
7304147	7305488	They want to suck us dry.
7305949	7306429	I guess so.
7306589	7310132	They want all of our money to belong to Konami of Japan.
7311233	7311813	I guess so.
7312113	7312954	It's a corporate plot.
7314215	7314936	Conspiracy.
7315916	7321661	Because you know that K-Set's using all the money to build a giant robot.
7321701	7322941	They're using it to build Metal Gear.
7323822	7324062	Hmm.
7326084	7326624	I don't know.
7328045	7329066	Right, okay.
7329226	7330087	Alright, gotcha.
7332209	7333670	I'm trying to think of any other Bomani news.
7333750	7338971	Actually, I'm going to go over to Loki, since we haven't heard from him in a little bit, and ask Loki, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?
7339912	7340772	Surely there must be something.
7341912	7342873	I'm sure there is.
7344453	7345413	I don't know what that is.
7346634	7347154	Let me look.
7348246	7355053	Now, other than TDR Maniacs being fucking slow as hell, let's see here.
7355854	7366865	I think I mentioned last week that Alpha 24 came out, not that anyone cares why they're up to Alpha 24 is beyond me, but they are, so, yeah.
7367766	7367846	Um...
7368905	7373908	Other than that, there's a poll, I think, still going on for what characters should be ripped next.
7374308	7378730	Since the 5th Mix character is almost completely ripped for use with Step Mania.
7379230	7381091	Some themes are being worked on right now.
7381211	7386114	The DDR9 Red, which is obviously a rip-off of 2DX Red's theme.
7386734	7391797	And Transmakina 5, which a lot of people that are out there in the sim world know about.
7393038	7393358	Also...
7394708	7398271	There's, of course, Technofiend still being worked on.
7398471	7399412	Really nice right now.
7400473	7402194	But, you know, that's just basic theme stuff.
7402855	7413463	DDRUK will have Ultramix Pack 6 and the DDR Extreme US tracks as soon as their downloads come back up.
7414484	7416526	The Extreme tracks, I know, are almost done.
7416626	7418407	Ultramix Pack 6 are done.
7418427	7420289	They're just waiting to be uploaded or...
7421395	7422055	Don't fire them!
7422195	7430057	I never hold a remix contest I'd say I'd have a few judges and they would have to be local so I can yell at them
7451021	7454284	Fire the goddamn judges and set some deadlines next time.
7454364	7455065	Seriously.
7455145	7457367	I mean, sorry, but, you know.
7457647	7462191	Well, they also had their server thing where they got a new server recently, so, you know, there's that.
7462731	7464833	Alright, alright, alright.
7465194	7465794	Fine, whatever.
7465994	7467316	Beggars can't be choosers, I guess.
7467636	7468196	Yeah, we can.
7469858	7471219	Any exciting remixes, though?
7471319	7473581	Oh, you played some of them a couple weeks ago when I wasn't here, huh?
7474082	7474522	Yeah, alright.
7476810	7480594	I just found out, just, just found out just now, there's a good chance I'm not going to be here next week.
7481554	7481855	Really?
7482255	7483356	Yeah, something's going on.
7483797	7484357	You know about it.
7485939	7486559	What are you playing?
7488421	7489382	Yeah, way to go.
7490043	7494527	There's something going on, I'll tell you off air, but you actually already know about it, you just probably forgot it was next Sunday.
7494708	7494848	Okay.
7494888	7495048	Okay.
7498226	7499267	Oh, now she makes O-Face.
7499527	7500147	Oh, yes.
7500187	7501028	I may not be here either.
7502449	7505690	So we'll probably have a pre-taped show next week for you guys.
7505710	7508352	We need to go to Golfland and do a show again.
7508552	7510653	That's why I kind of want to do a show from the ghetto.
7511573	7512654	That means going to Scandia.
7512694	7514575	I think that would be fun, to do a show from the ghetto.
7515335	7516456	In the ghetto.
7516796	7517196	We'll see.
7518497	7519417	I don't know.
7519457	7522259	I thought that our last one we did at Golfland was funny when they almost threw us out.
7522739	7523640	That was pretty funny.
7523820	7524280	I would kind of...
7526623	7528505	until we said, but we're promoting you.
7528565	7529286	That's a good idea.
7529326	7533650	We could go to Golf Line and play the new Step Mania machine, although I hear it kind of sucks, and that's not Loki's fault.
7533690	7535412	It's just the fact that the computer inside sucks.
7537534	7545141	Well, the only way it sucks is the fact that it has a default skin with no movies, but other than that, the pads do suck, and that's not my fault at all.
7545161	7546723	That's their shit, you know.
7547583	7553128	I tried, hey, my original computer specifications worked very well with video and all that shit.
7553448	7559073	It's just, you know what, when someone else does the job for you, it just doesn't quite come out how you wanted it.
7561475	7565559	You know, I just don't care because I wasn't going to spend any more time nor money on that.
7565959	7575187	However, what has come to my attention, and I plan on doing this, I have to come up with $200 though, is, um, apparently...
7576670	7577892	Channel Beat's having a sale.
7579053	7579453	Uh-oh.
7579974	7580735	And you know what that means?
7581015	7584099	That means I get my parts for my cabinet.
7584820	7588945	Those parts being my Dance Maniac sensors, which drop from $59 a piece to $29 a piece.
7589706	7590046	Awesome.
7594981	7599103	Arcade Perfect, Dance Maniac Sensors, and all the other shit.
7599363	7603926	I just have to figure out if I can use those sensors or not, because I don't know if it connects to an Airface board.
7605246	7606867	You can always make modifications for Airface.
7606887	7608868	I'm sure I could get to work.
7610409	7613131	Break out a ballpoint pen and some paper clips.
7613831	7619254	What I found out that's very interesting, and it does tie in with Step Mania...
7619915	7622117	Stepmania's license agreement, basically.
7622637	7629462	You can take Stepmania, modify it how you want, as far as theme, whatever.
7629742	7631043	Put your own songs in it.
7632324	7633365	Create your own theme.
7634245	7635146	And you can sell it.
7635586	7636927	And you can make money off of it.
7637448	7640410	And all you have to do is just say, powered by Stepmania or whatever.
7641431	7642131	That got me thinking.
7642431	7644313	Wouldn't that be cool to make a new arcade game?
7646494	7646714	Hmm.
7647075	7647375	I don't know.
7647944	7650166	I want to make something like Dance Maniacs.
7650286	7653748	I want to at least do it for my cabinet itself.
7653888	7655169	The waving the hands game.
7655409	7661793	No, I want to do something across with Dance Maniacs and... Is it like Technomotion?
7661893	7663954	No, not necessarily like Technomotion.
7664014	7672600	Dance Maniacs and Para Para, which basically would be... It would sort of be like Para Para, but it would have top and bottom sensors in a way.
7672640	7673961	Make the country line dancing game.
7674341	7675681	No, God, you're getting line dancing.
7675701	7676422	That's retarded.
7676742	7683503	What I want to do, though, is I want to have infrared sensors, because you can actually do some sensors where they have different trigger points, you know, below a certain level.
7683623	7686404	So I basically have, like, you know, up to waist, high, or whatever.
7686744	7699387	That'd be one set of five sensors, and then above that would be another set, but without those stupid, you know, actual things in front of you, so you don't keep hitting them with your hand, and then have, you know, cool, like, techno trance stuff to go with it.
7699767	7700847	Do mocap dance.
7701423	7711534	and be awesome but that's what I want to do at least but who knows I just have to see because I have the only problem with the buy enough channel beat you have to spend a $200 minimum ouch
7713993	7734345	So, you know, I can buy the Dance Maniac sensors, that's gonna be about, you know, say I buy three, or no, four of them, that's gonna be, you know, a good, you know, $120, and I still have $80 left that I have to spend on that, so I can maybe buy another sensor and some miscellaneous crap, and then, you know, maybe set up this weird dance thing or whatever.
7736106	7737186	It's just, I don't know.
7738447	7740548	I think it'd be cool, but, you know, what do I know?
7742229	7743350	You could buy a turntable.
7744818	7751363	You can't buy turntables off there, and I would buy the turntables to RK Perfect Blends if they sold them, but they don't, and that pisses me off.
7751423	7761210	It's like, where the fuck, if something breaks on your Bomani cabinet, or whatever, where the fuck do you buy the parts that aren't listed on Channel B?
7761350	7762130	That's what I want to know.
7762350	7767694	I think that a lot of them, you have to order them from the Japanese distributors, like from Konami.
7767714	7771797	Because I want to order the exact turntable parts.
7774085	7774505	DarkSakura
7800109	7800490	I don't know.
7801070	7801711	We'll just see.
7801871	7803614	I just need to finish my cabinet first.
7804054	7806637	I need to stop taking on extra projects.
7807599	7810462	See, the problem is right now... Well, I'm focusing.
7810963	7812405	My fucking iPack's broken.
7812465	7817431	My old iPack 2 is broken, I think, because it's been flipping out weird when I hook up the...
7819640	7842502	DancePads to it, and so I bought a new one that's coming, uh, IPAC, uh, what is it, Value Edition V or something like that, which, oddly enough, has more sensors, um, than, uh, the IPAC 2, and it's USB only, but I'm, that's coming this week, and so once I get that, then I'll be able to work on my cabinet again, because... I think that you need to open your gate to hell.
7845031	7846233	I'm going to do that later.
7846393	7849717	I have to finish that too, but I need to get this stuff done.
7849998	7858449	I want to get my cabinet stuff done because the weather is going to be turning for the worse and I won't be able to work on it during the winter because it's raining like a bitch and I have my wood.
7858469	7862895	So what I want to do is I want to fucking sit down, get a friend to help me, and just
7863348	7871173	Chop up all that wood that I've got out there to like, you know, nice two foot by four foot sections so I can actually, you know, finish that.
7872614	7875055	No, we're not calling it Loki motion because that's retarded.
7876116	7876776	I liked it.
7877296	7878317	That was cute.
7878777	7880138	It's cute, but it's retarded.
7880618	7881359	Loki motion.
7881979	7882760	Loki motion.
7885321	7886282	You saw my comment.
7886322	7887202	It's too Kylie.
7890064	7891905	Anyways, I'm done.
7892358	7893880	So, what else are we going to talk about?
7893940	7895121	We need to get pissed off.
7895201	7895601	Yeah.
7896983	7900066	I just want to ask for a minute, what the fuck is wrong with everybody tonight?
7900126	7903609	And not you guys, but I'm like, God, it's like, is it something in the air?
7903809	7905271	Is everybody on their period?
7905331	7906412	What is going on tonight?
7906933	7909795	Like, it's just like, everything is dead tonight.
7909896	7913179	It's like, are we being invaded by aliens?
7913299	7914100	What is going on?
7915621	7916622	Is our show old?
7916982	7918243	Have we jumped the shark?
7918603	7920123	We did not jump the shark, okay?
7920143	7922825	If we were going to jump the shark, it would have been when we let Loki sing.
7923965	7924325	I agree.
7929808	7930868	People need to wake up.
7932349	7932889	Seriously.
7933809	7935330	I'm sleepy too, Rob.
7935610	7936150	I know.
7936911	7941713	I'm not saying everybody's dead, but it's just like, God, I mean, seriously, tonight's kind of like deader than usual.
7941753	7941893	Yeah.
7942926	7944587	I know.
7944928	7945668	I know.
7946969	7948630	I know just the thing to perk people up.
7948730	7950131	I know just the thing.
7950271	7951331	I know just the thing.
7951392	7951612	Rob.
7951812	7955774	First of all.
7956194	7957015	That made me feel better.
7959136	7964940	It's like a schoolgirl combined with Dr. Evil, but you know.
7966521	7968882	It's very cute, Rob.
7969363	7969843	Very cute.
7970956	7976358	Some people are saying that they're trying to call us and they can't get through because I'm being a bitch and haven't opened the Skype line, huh?
7977479	7980880	Yeah, I turned it off, but I turned it back on just now, so that's fine.
7981260	7988183	If somebody wants to call us and tell us that, you know... If someone wants to pick up the pace a little bit... Call us or we'll play Let Them Move.
7988283	7988783	No, we will not.
7989063	7990884	No, I wouldn't even do that.
7991404	7996066	I would do that if, like, nobody was... I don't know, if I really wasn't getting something my way.
7996086	7996466	The 1-900-HOT-POOP.
8001128	8002149	Oh yay, we're getting a call.
8002189	8002810	See, that's how it works.
8003130	8004251	Hi, you're on Orange Ones Radio.
8005192	8005633	Hello.
8005913	8006393	Hello.
8006413	8006453	Hi.
8007494	8008435	I'm sorry.
8008996	8009596	That's all right.
8010257	8014461	If I try to turn it down on the 365, it turns everything else down.
8015261	8015622	Uh-oh.
8016743	8019986	So, see, if I mute it, then it mutes you guys.
8020186	8020426	Uh-oh.
8020446	8022208	So I suppose maybe I should just stop it?
8023769	8024530	Can you hear us okay?
8024550	8024630	Okay.
8025151	8026512	Yeah, I can hear you guys now.
8026592	8027092	Yay!
8027112	8027292	Okay.
8027532	8028373	Yeah, we can hear you fine.
8028393	8031154	You're like one of the most clear callers we've ever had call the show.
8031754	8032235	Seriously.
8032275	8036037	Well, I just got my headset a couple days ago.
8036257	8038198	So I finally decided to call and say hello.
8038298	8039759	Kudos to your internet connection.
8039779	8040639	Now tell us who you are.
8041119	8041980	This is Raichan.
8042100	8042600	Hi, Raichan!
8042660	8043360	Hi!
8043981	8044721	A new caller.
8044841	8046562	We don't get a lot of girls calling the show.
8047022	8048223	So I'm glad that Raichan could call.
8048243	8051224	Well, we had Misty, and I think Irene called a few while back.
8051264	8053145	But, you know, we don't get a whole lot in comparison.
8053526	8054226	So what's up, Raichan?
8054907	8055668	Oh, not a whole lot.
8055708	8058610	I tried to call you guys before, just as you guys went to the break.
8059271	8062473	Oh, when we were talking about DDR Festival and Quad Mode and all that stuff.
8063134	8063334	Yep.
8063794	8064375	What was on your mind?
8065195	8068358	Oh, just the whole, I'm one of those import only.
8068478	8070079	I don't have US versions at all.
8070319	8071280	Is there any reason for that?
8071340	8078986	Is it just because you bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 first and then... Two years ago, when my first boyfriend and I broke up.
8079447	8079687	Uh-huh.
8080341	8085044	I had him, he owed me money, so I bought a Japanese PS2 with what he owed me.
8085264	8085985	Hey, you know what?
8086385	8092209	I inherited a 3rd and 4th style out of a previous relationship, so isn't that the best way to get new stuff?
8092909	8093509	Of course.
8095511	8097852	Most of my DDRs actually do come from other people.
8099093	8099613	Wow.
8101094	8102655	My 3rd mix I bought for myself.
8102775	8106297	My 4th my mom bought for me in exchange for doing housework.
8107198	8108659	5th mix Jason bought for me.
8110213	8119157	6th Mix my brother got me for Christmas, 7th I bought for myself just before a tournament, Extreme my second boyfriend got for me.
8119297	8119698	Wow!
8120458	8120838	You know what?
8121398	8123419	I want people to start buying me my Bimani.
8123459	8124440	Why do I have to buy it?
8125140	8127261	Well, Loki did buy DDR Extreme, so there's that.
8127802	8131524	The festival will be a gift from somebody, too, whenever that finally comes.
8131564	8131804	Wow!
8131884	8133725	That's where you have the collection to rival mine.
8134935	8138277	Yeah, Rai Chan actually has her collection posted.
8138537	8140839	Is it public on the internet somewhere where we can see it?
8140899	8143420	It's in my live journal user info.
8143600	8143981	Okay.
8144401	8145141	If you want me to take it.
8145161	8146122	Do you want to say that on the air?
8146162	8147423	I don't know if you want to say it on the air.
8147443	8148363	It doesn't matter to me.
8149284	8150765	Actually, I'll post a link in the chat room.
8151585	8152185	Oh, there you go.
8152205	8153146	Either way.
8153866	8156008	And you can actually take a look at Rai Chan's Bomani collection.
8156048	8157449	It's quite impressive.
8158149	8159990	Her Bomani penis is quite large.
8162031	8162312	Well, um...
8163559	8165780	I got rid of my pop-up music controller.
8165820	8166680	I sold it to Angel.
8167221	8172203	However, I still have seven, which I'll give to Jason, and then nine, most likely, I'll sell.
8172603	8173183	I'll buy it from you.
8174283	8175964	Okay.
8176044	8178025	I have a pop-up music controller and a pop-up music.
8178886	8186530	Um, yeah, I sold my controller recently, so I still have 7 and 9 sitting around just because I didn't know anyone else to sell it to.
8186850	8188590	I've borrowed that controller too, which is funny.
8188630	8193453	If you want to sell any pop of music you have that you want to sell, you've got to buy it right here, because I need pop of music.
8193473	8194473	Alright, cool.
8195334	8202737	Wow, boy, not only do you get people to buy your new stuff for you, but you get people to buy your old shit too, I mean, god.
8204162	8208627	and Jason wants me to post a picture of him and I, which I'll go find the link to.
8209148	8210629	Aww, he wants to be mushy.
8211210	8215495	We have a picture of him and I both with our entire Bimani collections.
8215895	8217838	Oh, that is so nauseatingly cute.
8218158	8219760	What did you think of his chicken hat?
8219780	8223504	What did you think of the chicken hat picture I took at E3?
8225433	8228994	Well, you saw that I used that as one of my LiveJournal user pictures.
8229074	8230715	I just had to bring that up because I love that picture.
8230975	8232356	We were like, you have to wear the chicken hat.
8233316	8233896	Hug the cow.
8235397	8236037	It was great.
8236858	8237658	Let's see.
8237958	8239619	You need to come up and visit us next.
8239759	8242560	Wait, did you and Jason actually meet through Bomani?
8243540	8245701	DDR Freak and LiveJournal, pretty much.
8245841	8247422	Wow, that's kind of cool.
8248062	8248482	Look at that.
8248522	8250023	DDR Freak brings people together.
8250743	8253304	It not only tears people apart, but it brings them together as well.
8253939	8254319	There you go.
8254619	8258141	You know, the internet is a good place to meet people.
8258221	8259922	I think the internet gets a bad rap sometimes.
8260182	8261283	It can't be a good place to meet people.
8261303	8262184	I met Dan online.
8262484	8262924	There you go.
8263064	8263644	Through fandom.
8265986	8267887	Anything else you want to comment on, Ryachan?
8268547	8272069	Not really, just calling to say hi since I finally have everything set up.
8272349	8275471	Well, hello and thank you for the call and enjoy DER Festival when it comes out.
8275531	8278733	Let us know how it is since none of us are probably even going to bother to get it.
8278773	8279973	You're going to have to be our reviewer.
8280754	8281014	Okay.
8281174	8281514	Alright.
8282074	8282855	Alright, thank you guys.
8283126	8283747	Alright, take care.
8284627	8284908	Bye.
8285068	8285588	Thanks for the call.
8285748	8286429	Oh, that was so nice.
8287990	8291153	We got some comments in the chat room that she's clearer than we are.
8292454	8293996	Her microphone's better than ours.
8294156	8295777	We need to know what kind of microphone she's got.
8295958	8296518	Seriously.
8297539	8299801	Right, Chen, you're going to have to send me an email.
8300562	8305326	Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you ever want to send me an email, if you're a stalker fan and want to send me an email, that's fine.
8305386	8308469	Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a good place to go.
8310543	8314444	Okay, I guess we're going to close up the Skype line because I want to do a break because we've got to come back.
8314544	8316624	We have to do the FUs of the week.
8316945	8317805	That's our favorite part.
8317825	8318005	I know.
8318025	8318645	We've got to do them.
8318985	8321145	So send your FUs in now.
8321285	8324186	And in this break, we're going to hear some keyboard mania music.
8325506	8328867	Yeah, I knew that would be the first word out of your mouth, Jamie.
8329707	8330708	I love sensation.
8330728	8331988	It's play sensation.
8332028	8334068	So it's the first thing I have queued up for you.
8334568	8335189	So here we go.
8335209	8336549	A whole break of keyboard mania music.
8336569	8336869	Enjoy.
8336889	8337269	We'll be back.
8438619	8440100	Thanks for watching!
8718769	8719569	We are back.
8719589	8726571	What the hell are you laughing at over there?
8749794	8750455	Nothing is funny!
8751936	8756138	I'm laughing at DJ Nostalgia's icon on DDR Maniacs.
8756238	8765244	It's this little stick figure trying to pick up a flower to give it to the female stick figure, but the flower keeps moving, so then he finally gets pissed off and kicks the flower and it hits the chick in the head and she runs off.
8766305	8766645	Funny.
8768706	8769747	Hilarious.
8770307	8771268	That's all I have to say.
8772629	8777792	Alright, well, the theme of tonight has kind of been like being dead, I guess, because...
8778416	8779256	You guys have all been dead.
8779636	8784478	So we decided we're going to pick things up a little bit with some good old-fashioned FUs.
8785358	8788239	Jamie, why do we have to do some good old-fashioned FUs anyway?
8788259	8793501	We are full of angst and anger, and if we don't let it out, we'll explode and destroy half of the world.
8793521	8801764	Oh, this is bad.
8801804	8802284	Here is justice.
8809033	8809773	My first F.U.
8809793	8814315	of the evening goes to the driver of this Volkswagen Passat that was in front of me.
8814776	8826721	First of all, I normally, you know, give the thumbs up to good German engineering, but these are cars that are meant to be driven at 100 miles an hour on the Autobahn, not 25 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone.
8827881	8829242	God.
8829642	8830242	Another F.U.
8830282	8838606	goes to me for drinking so much vodka last night and, you know, I will say whatever is on my mind while I am drunk.
8840132	8849803	and I got very blirty, so F you to my lack of restraint while I'm intoxicated.
8850844	8858173	Another F you goes toward this particular
8858780	8864423	Bit of software that I've acquired that requires a certain thing to make said software work.
8865364	8866264	So now I can't use it.
8866725	8874429	A big, humongous, whopping F you goes to freaking PaintShop Pro 8 for not letting me change the size of my brush.
8875089	8886396	Because I want to go and do little fine detailed work and go edit out backgrounds and stuff so that I can have transparencies and a stupid brush will not let me change the damn size of it.
8886716	8886916	And it's
8887990	8889371	Photoshop is ass, okay?
8889471	8892553	I do not like Photoshop, even though I'm going to have to take a class in it.
8892933	8899176	But that means that I'm going to have to go back to using PaintShop Pro 7, except PaintShop Pro 8 has some really good filters in it.
8901037	8912683	And also FU to the potential class I have to take in Photoshop, even though I don't care for Photoshop all that much, except it does have also really nice filters, and I like the way it does layers better.
8913784	8915105	And FU goes toward...
8917664	8945113	another thing about PaintShot Pro 8 for not letting me freaking rotate my text in a curve the way I want to it's doing some weird vector thing that's really pissing me off so that means that I have to do 10 sideshow posters for Halloween by hand I have to ink them and then color them on the computer at least I can do some neat stuff to it and make it look cool once I have drawn it and scanned it
8945609	8947930	And at least I don't have to do some heavy shading on it either.
8947970	8949110	It's all primary colors.
8949190	8951291	But it's just my hand's going to be falling off.
8951351	8954131	And I have other drawings I really, really want to work on too.
8955452	8961773	So as it stands, I'm just going to have to, I guess, find some time.
8961953	8964094	At least I've done all the homework for one of my classes.
8965194	8976081	Oh yeah, and another F you toward not having my Copic markers anymore, because I finally, three of my Copic markers dried out, and that means I have to go pay another 20 bucks to get another set.
8977102	8982766	So... And also, just an F you to the color Copics for being so damn expensive anyway.
8983606	8988670	I mean, true, you're paying for quality and alcohol-based ink, but... Ugh, so expensive.
8989570	8992812	And I'm retracting an F you this week to Dell.
8993413	8994934	Whoa, is that a first?
8995805	8996625	I wish I could go on before.
8996645	8997665	I wish I could go on before.
9025851	9027052	And that will make me a happy bunny.
9029593	9030553	Happy happy bunny.
9031074	9032234	And one final FU.
9032695	9034035	To my happy bunny t-shirt.
9035156	9037917	And my happy bunny t-shirt had pink fuzzy fur on him.
9038397	9040839	And now he looks like he's got a goatee over his belly.
9041539	9044981	It's because it's like the bottom of his mouth is like by his belly.
9045521	9048823	So he looks like he's just got bad chest hair.
9049583	9051624	And like the rest of them is rub all raw.
9052865	9054806	Another FU goes to Rob's cell phone.
9055914	9058015	It should be on silent while we're on the show.
9059115	9060476	Sorry.
9060516	9061716	Yeah.
9062357	9062937	And that's it.
9063317	9063897	I'm spent.
9065178	9068499	Let's move on to Loki and see what he's pissed off about this time.
9071080	9078063	Well, first off, I'm going to be pissed off at my toe because I just squeezed it really hard in this big, pussy, clump thing.
9079243	9084425	I was, but I need to let it dry out because before, you know, with a band-aid, it just stays wet.
9084878	9085498	I don't have any gauze.
9085818	9092721	So anyway, so, um, yeah, I squeezed this big clump of whatever out, because it looked like it was pussying a little bit, so I was like seeing how bad it was.
9093302	9098784	And so, but it wasn't that, it was like some of the gauze that was left over from the other thing I hadn't pulled out.
9098944	9100565	It was in the hole where they...
9101573	9103934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9131249	9133230	Fuck you to Denios for sucking.
9133450	9137593	I never realized how many cell phone case booths there could be in one place.
9138273	9144938	I mean, I didn't really need a cell phone case or a new faceplate because there's tons of those faceplate booths.
9145298	9148600	Nor did I need any used underwear or samurai swords.
9148720	9154664	I swear to God, this place is like, we have power tools, we have bungee cords, and we have samurai swords.
9155944	9156925	Where the hell does that fit in?
9157915	9158696	That's just weird.
9158816	9161558	Hey, I bought some Korean pop CDs there.
9163319	9166021	Okay, that's cool, but that was the only, like, cool thing that was there.
9166462	9167182	I walked around that.
9167402	9168823	It's just, it's not the same anymore.
9168863	9171605	It's like, we went at around 2 to 3 o'clock.
9171625	9176489	I mean, that is not very early, but it's not late in the day.
9176549	9180252	I mean, and there was already half the people that already packed up and left.
9180973	9186156	In fact, they were closing the fucking, you know, food vending booths down at 3, and they closed at 5.
9187819	9188939	Fuck, two hours early?
9188979	9190120	That's a little ridiculous.
9190600	9192040	But whatever, so they were doing that.
9192841	9194781	And that was really lame and a waste of my time.
9195081	9199523	But, also, fuck you to Shark's Tale, because it was kind of lame.
9200203	9202964	But I went and saw it for free, so that wasn't that lame.
9203184	9206245	But it just still sucked, and it was a waste of my time.
9209046	9213347	And, finally, just, you know...
9214198	9214838	I don't really know.
9214939	9219081	I had a lot more stuff earlier this week, and I just cannot remember it for the life of me now.
9219502	9222103	Fuck you to Goddamn Roundtable today.
9222644	9225205	Okay, now, I bought a personal pizza and Twizz.
9225525	9226726	Their Twizz are fucking huge!
9227046	9229128	If I knew they were fucking huge, I would have just bought the Twizz.
9229628	9231509	But not only that, they didn't cook them all the way through.
9232150	9238634	They were damn good, so I ate them all, but I had to take a very bad shit when I got home.
9239775	9240615	That's beautiful.
9241156	9241376	So...
9242213	9267132	or at least it felt like it did, it wasn't, it was just, you know, it's just, you know, one of those things like, urgent, emergency, you know, that's not a feeling I want to have after, you know, eating at Roundtable, because I love Roundtable, and I was just, it was ironic because I was telling a story about how I used to make twists out of large pizza skins that were like a good, you know, three feet long when you're done with them, which is awesome, but, I don't know, they were still good though, but, um,
9268493	9269774	I don't know how it'll work, but I want something new.
9269794	9270695	I would like to give an FU.
9297202	9323472	to that person I was already giving FUs to earlier who just made themselves look like an ass I want to give an FU to myself for having a little bit too much to drink last night and kind of forcing myself to stay in Chico until really late although actually I had a really good time so I have absolutely nothing to be bitching about but I need to learn to say no to drinking a lot better because I'm going to get myself in trouble sometimes what?
9324053	9325233	just say no I know
9326691	9338699	And then I want to give an FU to Unnecessary Drama and people that get off on perpetuating other people's drama.
9339119	9343141	Actually, I think I've had a pretty good week, all things considered, to be honest.
9343282	9346284	So I don't have a whole bunch to give FUs to.
9347945	9351007	Oh, FU to people that make fun of my name on Ultramix.
9351547	9355610	Like, I freaking join games on Ultramix and people go, huh, it's Greenski.
9356872	9360313	First of all, it's green sky, but since you don't know how to read, I'll forgive you.
9361673	9365193	But it's just like, you know... And then I go and kick your ass.
9365894	9370054	And you're like, you know, you just tell me I'm on a controller or something, even though I'm not.
9370454	9371815	I'm actually on a dance pad.
9372275	9376896	And then, um... Just in general, retards.
9377376	9379216	Not actual people who are actually retarded.
9379236	9382537	I mean, there's nothing they can do about it, but I mean people who act retarded and they have no reason to be.
9383717	9384997	Is it FU-related?
9386215	9388217	Okay, Loki has something F you related.
9391619	9393761	Fuck you to Bush because you look like an idiot during the debate.
9393961	9394241	That's all.
9397043	9397483	Moving on.
9399044	9399385	Bradley.
9402227	9402807	Let's see.
9402827	9415116	The only thing I really have to say is fuck you to have to go another month being frugal because even with my pay raise I gotta pay off bills and stuff so I can't really do very much for the next month but I will.
9415816	9416296	That's about it.
9417517	9417998	Oh, that was quick.
9419098	9419479	Fair enough.
9419639	9423201	Let's go to the chatroom and see what our chatroom has to bitch about this time.
9424883	9428565	El Mullitz wants to say an F you to the chatroom for being so dead.
9428645	9429386	Not my fault.
9430146	9433809	An F you to idiots who claim you're a company fanboy for liking their games.
9433889	9437392	And on behalf of DarkSakura, an F you to Cosmo Magazine.
9437432	9438032	She knows why.
9438412	9440474	Because it's... Oh my god, that's the one I forgot.
9441363	9444185	Beyond Paradise Beyond the Garbage Dump
9467884	9472167	Beyond Sequel Matter or something, I don't know.
9473508	9482334	OtakuRat says, F you to working 11 hours on 3 hours of sleep.
9482354	9484956	Jazz says, F you to elderly drivers.
9485757	9488939	For the love of God, stop driving 10 miles an hour under the speed limit.
9489452	9492834	Also, F you to the people who plaster their cars with political stickers.
9492874	9494835	Has anyone noticed these people suck ass at driving?
9494895	9499518	Hey, buddy, I just put a political sticker on my car this week, so F you!
9499538	9500359	What did you put on there?
9500719	9501639	Carrie Edwards sticker.
9502860	9505162	Oh, I'm just gonna refrain from talking.
9505262	9507523	My mother put a Carrie Edwards sticker on my car, actually.
9507703	9508904	And she put it on crooked.
9508924	9510885	You know what, neither of them are worthy of my vote.
9510925	9512066	I'm voting for Silver Cat again.
9512126	9518049	Well, I don't want Bush to win, and I actually kind of like Carrie, especially after the debate, so we'll just leave it at that.
9518730	9518830	Uh...
9519771	9525437	Jazz says one more thing, F you to a certain in the groove step file creator for being such an elitist bastard.
9525477	9528301	Hey, where did I hear that one earlier tonight?
9528561	9534507	Nith says, F you to all computer image editor programs for not having a way of making a decent spiral.
9535969	9536349	Fair enough.
9536870	9537911	Any ideas on that?
9539373	9539653	I don't.
9540385	9542547	I haven't ever had to make a spiral, so.
9543307	9547931	Um, actually, yeah, you can do one in PaintShop Pro using the, uh, the twist.
9548531	9553355	Like, you, uh, do a straight line from the center and then, uh, do the twist warp and that should work.
9553375	9555837	You can save it as a, as a paintbrush and paint.
9556717	9557678	Drawing tips from Jamie.
9558579	9559960	Yeah.
9559980	9564964	Uh, VXJasonXV says, F you to a lack of sleep and making me sleep through almost all the show.
9565364	9567225	At least I woke up to my girlfriend's voice, though.
9567245	9567766	Aw.
9567806	9567866	Aw.
9569642	9574445	F you to the people who randomly bash other people they don't even know and probably do it only because they don't like me.
9574746	9575426	But you know what?
9575626	9578588	I can prevent his ability to connect to that IRC network.
9578668	9579469	Insert evil laugh here.
9579769	9582231	And I'm laughing too because I know exactly what he's talking about.
9582411	9587114	And when this person gets banned from anywhere, it's good news.
9587194	9588555	I just told Jamie what it was.
9588595	9590357	I was doing sign language to Jamie.
9593101	9595122	I have choice words that I'm not going to say.
9595382	9595722	All right.
9595762	9596422	Because I've said them.
9596442	9598143	She'll say them on commercial break, I'm sure.
9598203	9599703	Yeah, it's been my time.
9601464	9603465	Also, oh yeah, he says.
9604365	9609767	Oh yeah, to expand on my first one, F you to sleep, making you not do anything.
9609827	9610608	I need to go shopping.
9611788	9617470	You don't know how many times I've needed to go shopping, and then I'm like, mm, sleep.
9618030	9619891	And I don't end up shopping, and then I wonder why I'm hungry.
9621533	9625621	DDR Angel says F you to fellow students in a class that Magus and I are taking.
9625682	9627004	I almost called him Magus.
9629589	9632014	That was a total Tom Brokaw moment, I swear.
9633243	9635505	Yeah, but Rob, there's a difference.
9636165	9638727	Tom Brokaw gets paid, you know, a few million a year.
9640088	9642490	And you don't get paid for the show.
9642691	9643031	I know.
9644632	9649656	F you to fellow students in the class that... I mean, I've been horribly bad on my speech tonight.
9649796	9651317	I don't know how many things I've said.
9651377	9657903	Like, where my mind was just in three different places and I ran them all together and just said things I didn't mean to say.
9657923	9658883	Oh, God.
9658903	9660585	Sigh.
9662148	9665831	Angel says, F you to fellow students in the class that Magus and I are taking.
9666151	9667132	You asked for our help.
9667212	9667952	We gave it to you.
9668012	9669453	It's not our fault you didn't get it.
9669974	9671174	We never said you were stupid.
9671234	9677039	Don't put words in our mouths to make us look bad when we are trying to be diligent students, just like the rest of the class.
9677179	9677639	Grr.
9678500	9679160	Okay, I feel better.
9683803	9686825	For a pretty dead chat room, that was a very ranty evening of FUs.
9686946	9689167	I kind of am surprised.
9690388	9691509	They're restoring it, Rob.
9691529	9691749	Yes.
9693115	9701841	Alright, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from break, since we've got a few minutes left in the show, and that's how we always buy ourselves some time, is we do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9702501	9702721	Huh?
9705683	9707164	No, we did Elmullet's like first.
9707525	9708785	No, that was CDR Angel who was last.
9709926	9710246	Okay.
9710547	9710867	Alright.
9711647	9712408	We're going to go to a break.
9713260	9716827	In this break, 2DX music, because I want to hear Love is Dreaminess.
9717148	9717829	So we'll be back.
9717910	9720034	Actually, we'll just make an LED break.
9720355	9720635	Hell with it.
9720655	9721537	We're going to do LED music.
9721557	9723341	We'll be back after this LED break.
9723681	9723902	Enjoy.
9737742	9739203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9860729	9863770	You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience.
9863831	9864831	Yes, the whole Earth.
9865031	9866012	Yes, the whole Earth.
9918035	9921096	You are already dead!
10051215	10055376	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
10055596	10057317	Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
10057377	10057737	No!
10060117	10061518	Do we care what people think of us?
10063858	10063958	No!
10063998	10065439	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
10065899	10068819	Yes!
10070000	10071880	Extreme Babani Radio.
10072080	10074761	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
10075296	10076597	Xtreme Radio I have a question, Rob.
10104238	10105919	Okay, should I start the music first?
10106159	10106860	Yeah, start the music.
10106900	10107220	Alright.
10114004	10116965	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10117446	10120707	What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?
10121168	10124270	That is if we even get any questions anyway.
10124790	10127952	Because even though people are listening, we already put them to sleep.
10130782	10133723	Dear Orange Lounge... Yes, DarkSakura, your question.
10133823	10135484	Why are we so cool?
10137705	10139926	Well, because I'm here.
10140466	10141687	The air conditioner's cranked up.
10142948	10144548	Let's get to our first listener question.
10145889	10153152	Jason, MrVXJasonXV himself says, Does anyone remember seeing Katamari Damase... Damse?
10153652	10154153	Damase?
10154233	10154633	Damase!
10155455	10157096	Katamari Damacy at E3.
10157216	10158976	I've read reports about it, but I didn't see it.
10159536	10163197	I just beat the game yesterday, and it's one of the greatest I've ever played.
10163698	10164718	Has anyone else played it?
10165318	10166859	I have never heard of this game in my entire life.
10166879	10167659	I've never heard of this game.
10168139	10168339	What?
10168819	10169699	I've never heard of that game.
10172340	10173041	Loki has a question.
10174141	10179002	Isn't that the one where you, like, roll over shit, where you have this giant ball of crap that you roll over shit with?
10179142	10179923	Yes, that is it.
10180123	10183364	Where they spoofed it in, um, a penny arcade?
10183844	10183924	Uh...
10185009	10187610	I want to play it because it looks funny.
10188450	10189611	Yeah, that is the game.
10190471	10191692	The giant ball of shit game.
10192052	10193633	The giant ball of shit game.
10195053	10195573	Looks fun.
10196814	10199635	I will post a link to the official website here.
10200516	10202316	I don't remember this game at all.
10202376	10203897	Is it a Japanese game?
10204077	10205338	Oh no, it looks like an English game.
10205758	10208299	It was released for like 15 bucks at Fry's.
10208739	10209059	Really?
10209519	10210420	And then sold out.
10210480	10212080	It's really cool and everything.
10212100	10213501	I've never played it though.
10214987	10216588	How have I never heard of this game?
10218008	10218328	Weird.
10220489	10221610	Oh, it's Namco.
10222150	10222590	Yeah, it is.
10223130	10224651	Dude, anything by Namco is good.
10225131	10225731	That's weird.
10225891	10229533	Namco back in the day... Why have I never... I guess I'm just out of it.
10229613	10231613	I'm not cool anymore is basically what it boils down to.
10231633	10232033	Look at that.
10232093	10233114	A giant ball of shit.
10233154	10233554	Look at that.
10235015	10235255	Wow.
10235335	10237476	I would kill for a giant ball of shit.
10238436	10239576	Let's get to more questions.
10239656	10242117	Not shit, but stuff.
10242657	10243118	Stuff, yeah.
10243158	10244098	It's a giant ball of stuff.
10244841	10247622	You wouldn't really want a ball of shit rolling over you.
10247642	10248783	Yeah, it would kind of suck.
10249784	10250704	Get everything messy.
10251084	10252505	They're calling it a sleeper hit.
10252985	10254326	It's a budget sleeper hit.
10254906	10256707	Oh, kind of like what Incredible Crisis was.
10258288	10266112	Brack2000 has a question, and I don't know if I want to ask his question, to be honest, but I guess I will, because I do that.
10266512	10268513	Brack2000 wants to know, where's the ferret at?
10269274	10269834	It's on the floor.
10271495	10272036	Where should it be?
10272056	10273457	It needs to stay there.
10273737	10275218	In the fireplace where he belongs.
10275758	10277260	You don't have a fireplace, Rob.
10277280	10279161	I have a fireplace in my place.
10280302	10281623	Listen to the retarded love.
10282643	10284565	Angel has a question to all the hosts.
10284905	10286186	Want me to make new promos?
10286807	10287867	Hey, we'll take donations.
10288928	10289529	What are we going to say?
10289909	10291570	No, don't give us free stuff.
10291870	10293131	Don't do work for us.
10293672	10294412	Please don't.
10294652	10297094	Of course we want people to make fun of us.
10297174	10297534	Jamie.
10298135	10298655	Question for Jamie.
10298675	10299436	Shut that damn thing up.
10299456	10299596	What?
10300362	10305185	What do you think the best way to get my stamina up for DDR besides playing DDR itself?
10305245	10305845	I want options.
10306606	10307066	Is this Angel?
10307786	10308887	Yeah.
10309107	10309567	Start walking.
10310948	10311589	Yeah, walking.
10311869	10312369	Start walking.
10313214	10315395	Do things that get your heart going.
10316336	10318397	The whole thing is that DDR is cardio.
10319418	10329083	And no matter how good you get your legs in shape, if you're breathing, if your lungs can't keep up with it, you should go to spin with me, Angel.
10329203	10331104	Get a membership at my gym and go to spin with me.
10331284	10333465	That'll get your cardio built up.
10333665	10335527	I'm still debating getting a membership at that gym, too.
10335587	10336747	I guarantee you.
10337648	10337768	But...
10338453	10339394	I want to be buff.
10361906	10364247	And there is no way in hell I can run two miles, okay?
10364448	10366228	I can barely run a quarter of the track.
10367429	10371171	But we're working on getting in shape to do the mud run next year.
10371752	10374753	And if you want to come work out with us, you're welcome to do it.
10374973	10385759	And that would help build up your stamina because we're doing run walks on the track and running the stairs and doing sit-ups and push-ups and all kinds of stuff.
10387260	10388421	You're starting a fitness club.
10388914	10389514	Yeah, kind of.
10389534	10394235	We were talking about doing something like Orange Lounge Fitness.
10394595	10395736	That's cute.
10396376	10397836	Meanwhile, I'm on the DDR diet.
10400657	10403157	Rule number one of Run Club.
10403277	10405178	No one talks about Run Club!
10406418	10406658	Sorry.
10408639	10409919	Moving on with Angel's question.
10409959	10411379	There's also a question for Loki here.
10411539	10412820	Is your new remix done?
10413120	10414360	I didn't even know he was working on a new remix.
10415359	10418721	Yeah, well, okay, what's the status of Loki remixes?
10418741	10419561	Is anything on the plate?
10420061	10421182	I'll reword her question.
10421202	10423303	I thought that was a plan.
10424344	10425544	There was stuff being done.
10426265	10427145	This is news to me.
10427545	10433168	Maybe she was asking, like I was thinking, have we renamed your last remix yet?
10433428	10435089	Oh, yeah, I went with my name.
10436070	10436470	Which was?
10437971	10438831	What did I name that?
10440745	10446471	I think it was Radical Faith, The Final Judgment Mix or something like that.
10447492	10448693	Yeah, I think that's what I called it.
10448713	10450515	There you have it.
10451816	10456560	Rob, am I allowed to use the controller when playing Ultra Mix against you because my converter is being buggy?
10456620	10458162	Yeah, that's fine.
10458182	10459363	You can play controller against me.
10459463	10460744	But, here's the thing.
10461104	10469872	Don't fucking go picking like Can't Stop Falling In Love, Speed Mix, followed by Paranoia Rebirth, and then Eternal, and then fucking like every 9-footer in the game back-to-back.
10470333	10471754	Because remember, I'm on a dance pad.
10471774	10472855	You're going to be playing fucking...
10474011	10476012	Santa Milete Light No, I'm kidding.
10476052	10477793	But, you know, just within reason.
10477833	10479614	As long as the songs are within reason, I don't really care.
10479634	10481035	As long as we're just playing to have fun.
10481055	10485137	If I'm playing against somebody for fun, then yeah, we can, you know, use whatever you want.
10485177	10486318	Maybe I'll play on the controller.
10486338	10490420	We should just keep playing against each other on the controller like a bunch and then rack up a bunch of points.
10490440	10491200	That would actually be fun.
10492821	10494822	I actually have an idea how we're going to get ourselves in the top 100.
10494922	10497884	Uh... Ah, damn.
10498684	10499545	No, I don't want to cheat.
10499645	10501046	Anyway, I want to do it honestly.
10501246	10502226	We'll do it honestly.
10502627	10503287	Hehehehe.
10504180	10512022	El Mullet says, if any of you had to pick an old school video game character as your favorite of all time, who would you pick?
10512942	10513423	For what?
10514063	10516043	Your favorite old game... Oh, I'm sorry.
10516063	10521205	If you had to pick an old school video game character as your favorite of all time.
10523005	10524306	The chick from The Guardian Legend.
10525886	10529407	Actually, Richter Belmont from Dracula X. Hmm.
10530376	10538580	Just because he walks around with his Ryu haircut and his headband with a whip being all badass vampire hunter, that's kind of cool.
10539280	10541861	That's kind of hot.
10543302	10548325	I would have to say either the Dark Queen from Battletoads or Chun-Li.
10550345	10551526	Super Joe.
10553427	10554147	Super Joe?
10554928	10555608	By On Commando.
10556138	10557438	Dude, that's cool.
10557658	10560299	Because you blow up Hitler at the end of that game, only it's not Hitler.
10564060	10569281	Or, um, like, a random Mega Man 2 boss, because the Mega Man bosses are cool.
10569301	10571922	You would so be, uh, Quickman.
10572942	10574382	There is no Rainbow Man.
10574442	10574963	Go to hell.
10577703	10578963	Alright, uh, Misty.
10578983	10581384	I want to know what the hell happened to episode 111.
10581964	10583044	Did you delete it or something?
10583064	10585085	I've been looking forward to hearing it on Rewind Pal-
10586630	10588831	No, that's 1.12 that never got recorded.
10588871	10602337	Actually, 1.12 is gone, but there was a small mistake that happened this week where something got updated and didn't get saved, which caused you to hear the same episode for the third week in a row, and I apologize for that.
10603717	10604618	But, you know what?
10605158	10606778	We have a suggestion for you in the chatroom.
10606899	10607279	What?
10607399	10608039	God damn.
10608159	10609380	Ride2000 said you should be Hardman.
10609400	10610620	Every day.
10618741	10620562	No, episode 111 exists.
10620622	10624485	And in fact, to prove it, I will play a random moment from episode 111.
10625026	10626487	Here's a random moment from episode 111.
10627748	10628729	I'll bash Bin Laden.
10629269	10631911	Goddamn Bush family, forgive Bin Laden.
10632311	10634493	President Bush should be killed and his entire family.
10634513	10636194	If it wasn't for them, Osama wouldn't live.
10636775	10637415	Wow, wonderful.
10637455	10638316	A Dark Child moment.
10638356	10639037	Just what I wanted.
10640438	10642519	That had nothing to do with video games at all.
10642780	10643440	Play another clip.
10643460	10645402	What the hell's wrong with our show?
10645542	10645822	What the hell?
10647000	10649403	We need the random episode clip button.
10649603	10654748	Just like Conan has the random clips of Walker Texas Ranger.
10655089	10658072	We need to have... We need to do that.
10658753	10660094	I think that would be awesome.
10660114	10660815	Play another random.
10660915	10662437	I'm not going through old episodes.
10662617	10663438	Alright, fine.
10663598	10665200	Here's another random clip of episode 111.
10665260	10666781	Of other stuff.
10667042	10667903	I was kind of surprised.
10668807	10674271	One vote over Echo Image and one vote, or I'm sorry, two votes over DM Assure.
10674291	10676653	It was a very, very close cage match tonight.
10676693	10677774	What the hell was I talking about?
10677834	10679275	Tune in Thursday to find out.
10679535	10680236	Cage match!
10680796	10681737	And we know it's a cage match.
10682858	10683158	Alright.
10684699	10686861	So the episode exists, I just suck.
10689983	10690363	Alright.
10691824	10692385	And, um...
10693496	10693896	That's it.
10693936	10694977	That's all the questions we got.
10694997	10696838	And that's fine because it's time to wrap up the show.
10696878	10699640	So we're going to close the old Orange Lounge Radio mailbag.
10704763	10705764	And that was us closing the bag.
10706184	10707165	Oh, did we ever check the email?
10707205	10708606	The old school Yahoo email?
10709626	10711848	I check it once in a great while.
10713469	10714449	I'll open it up right now.
10720478	10722178	Like an F you for something Loki said.
10722818	10723979	Let's see what messages we got.
10724019	10727699	We said, good news, weight loss, 14% reduction of fat.
10728119	10729320	Have bigger cock.
10729820	10731740	Something makes me cry when I am moved.
10733820	10736041	And another one that says, happy face.
10736121	10738441	My sister used to tell me life is full of happiness.
10740542	10741782	Nothing in the goddamn email.
10742762	10744823	You didn't even get a penis enlargement, Neil?
10745043	10747323	I want to know, something makes me cry when I am moved.
10748953	10749913	I was reading some webcomic, Rob.
10749933	10757517	I don't remember which one it was, the someone accepting spam mail because they hate the world and want more to come.
10778274	10779215	That was completely random.
10781438	10782399	I'm going to go check my laundry.
10782759	10783360	Alright, sounds good.
10783701	10784702	Well, we're going to wrap up the show.
10784762	10785583	Come back, come back, come back.
10786063	10787585	Because you have to give us your final thought.
10788246	10788486	Okay.
10790329	10790629	Do it.
10791069	10791470	Final thought.
10792637	10794418	But you can't hear my thoughts.
10794599	10798862	None of you are... None of you are psycho and have ESPN.
10798962	10801804	Then just tell them to tune in Tuesday since we didn't do the plug.
10801844	10803405	Yes, I do a radio show on Tuesday.
10804506	10806287	And listen on... I never knew that.
10806688	10808129	Rob... Rob... What?
10808229	10808689	Rob... What?
10808929	10810190	Rob... What?
10810791	10812192	Twice in one show, damn.
10813052	10813373	Rob...
10815365	10818808	Anyway, I do pump up the volume on Tuesday night.
10819008	10826454	If you tune in at 7 o'clock, sometimes a little bit earlier, you can listen to the pre-show.
10826474	10828035	7.30 starts the real show.
10828876	10832259	It's supposed to be a request show, but that hasn't really happened all that much anymore.
10832339	10833920	People, you know, sometimes make requests.
10834340	10838043	So I said I'd choose to marathon things, and the marathon for this week will be Rammstein.
10838944	10843928	And then I'm probably going to throw in, like, old video game music, because I feel like it.
10845583	10846444	So, tune in.
10846884	10849626	You know, if I get bored again like I did last week, I'll go till midnight.
10850146	10854128	Because I played Eddie Izzard and a bunch of other stuff afterwards.
10855049	10859152	Last week, no, last week actually was the 80s marathon, which I actually do those every couple of months.
10860532	10863494	So, be thinking of what you want to listen to, though.
10863774	10864415	I'll play whatever.
10865836	10874001	If you are part of our LiveJournal community, Orange Lounge LiveJournal, you can also put in there things that you'd like to hear on the show.
10883266	10887050	I was thinking of weird things to make remixes of earlier today.
10887451	10893958	One of the things I downloaded, which I gotta mess around with because I think it'd be funny, is to make a dance remix to the Shaft theme.
10895520	10896601	I don't know if that would work.
10896954	10897474	I got you a record.
10897514	10898755	I got you, what was that group?
10898775	10899035	Guitar... Wolf.
10899095	10899535	Guitar Wolf.
10923724	10924786	I have a bunch of records.
10925006	10934977	I need to go through my big pile of mid-90s R&B and I need to figure out what I want to keep and what I want to get rid of because I'm trying to take that big pile I have that's just sitting there.
10936214	10944477	I have one record now, one left.
10944757	10950598	All my other ones are in Alabama, but Dan and I actually bought Weird Al's Even Worse on vinyl.
10950898	10956140	Well, I need to like just, because there's a lot of records out there, I need to figure out how to mix on vinyl.
10956200	10959541	And once I do that, then I'll be probably more opted to...
10960001	10962264	I'll make you a database I just need to know how to learn how to mix
10977677	10978578	That's pretty much what I need to do.
10978878	10981379	I can do parties, you know, where you just crossfade shit over.
10981420	10982460	That's a piece of cake.
10982900	10988544	But it's a matter of, like, you know, being an actual true DJ and being able to beatmatch and stuff and mix that way.
10988564	10994308	That's a little different than being a wedding DJ where you just play 80s shit and crossfade over.
10994328	10997250	Oh my god, this is the sequel to The Wedding Singer's The Wedding DJ.
10999191	11003734	Like, seriously, I could DJ, like, really shitty, like, adult parties and stuff, you know?
11004275	11004735	But, like,
11005567	11011893	I can't really actually be able to do cool professional DJ stuff and mix shit together.
11013554	11015155	Right now I have a program that helps me with that.
11015576	11020280	I can do it visually, but I can't do it audio.
11020640	11022541	That's a problem.
11024203	11024903	That's my final thought.
11026965	11027926	Bradley, you have a final thought?
11029547	11033811	Since I don't have very much to say, I'll just read random words from the posters on the wall.
11034898	11036920	Redundant, nicer, yummy, pin-up action.
11038060	11038521	Very nice.
11039261	11043404	And my final thought is, I'm trying to keep this short because I have somewhere else to be right now.
11043444	11045646	So, thank you very much for listening, everybody.
11045666	11046246	Have a great night.
11046307	11047107	Final word of the show.
11047147	11048468	Jamie, you always want it, so there you go.
11050189	11053232	My final word of the show is vodka.
11054352	11059236	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

11095918	11098901	Why do they gotta front?
11101751	11110058	What did we ever do to these guys that made them so violent?
11111139	11118345	Ooh, but you know I'm yours Ooh, and I know you're mine And that's for a long time
11130876	11157123	Oh, you, I look just like Buddy Holly Oh, and you're married to the boy I don't care what they say about us anyway I don't care about that

11216627	11221432	I'm trying to queue up a post-show, so I'm going to give the mic to Loki and give him the responsibility of filling up a post-show.
11223274	11224275	Filling up a post-show?
11224775	11225456	God damn it.
11228259	11229300	Well, shit.
11230521	11237028	Well, what I've been doing lately is I've been downloading some music, because, you know, I did buy stuff.
11237937	11238877	I bought music.
11239017	11246680	But anyways, this is one of the songs that I bought the other day, which is from BT.
11246740	11251301	So we're just going to kill time by playing a BT song because it'll be fun.
11251401	11252602	And everybody loves BT.
11252642	11253442	BT rocks.
11253762	11256063	And so...
11256581	11256681	B.T.
11256721	11257422	starring Vincent Covello.
11257442	11257542	Enjoy!
11277281	11278361	A little bit different from BT.
11278642	11279902	Oh, actually, no, screw that.
11279962	11280622	We're not playing that one.
11280962	11281103	No.
11281723	11281943	Better.
11281963	11290646	We're going to do the Crystal Method, Keep Hope Alive, BT's Creatine Method mix, and we're going to play a little bit of that because that's seven minutes long and we don't need to play the whole thing.
11290746	11290886	So...
11307874	11308135	and more.
11348795	11349456	Thanks for watching!
11406876	11407421	Thanks for watching!
11492222	11492862	And that was fun.
11494884	11495424	Yes, it was.
11495964	11500427	I have kind of a special treat for you guys tonight for some real post-show music.
11500447	11504749	We're actually going to be doing a whole bunch of music for my personal MP3 collection.
11505310	11506010	That should be fun.
11506751	11507011	Right?
11507631	11507911	Right?
11508652	11509052	Say yes.
11510623	11512144	Because everybody loves my taste in music.
11512204	11513525	No, but there's a lot of fun stuff in here.
11514105	11515185	So I hope you guys enjoy it.
11515926	11517987	I'm still trying to get the last few songs in here.
11518087	11526951	But I did want to say, definitely keep checking out our website over at www.orangelandredo.com Next week's show, very good chance that it's going to be taped next week.
11527052	11531674	Because some of us have other things we are already committed to for next weekend.
11532314	11535396	So we're not going to be able to probably be here live on Sunday night.
11535416	11537357	So we'll probably have some kind of tape show going on.
11537997	11566445	look for details on our website also I forgot to mention this during the show but that Akira Yamaoka contest we're going to have to delay another week because there's some stuff going on we just want to make sure we do the damn thing right so we need to delay for another week so sorry guys and that's about it all the details on that will be coming to the website very soon as well and that's going to be very cool and yes Loki
11567805	11574248	and soon, or maybe a little later on, we will be doing more contests and more giveaways.
11574828	11576169	The prize being anime movies.
11576509	11576909	Why?
11577270	11581812	Because I have like fucking ten plus cases of anime movies in my closet I need to get rid of.
11582792	11584013	And that's a lot of anime.
11584053	11586074	And I have like another two cases at work.
11586654	11588975	So, um, there'll be anime giveaways.
11591816	11593717	Ah, she watched the book and matches.
11594838	11595358	But yeah, the
11595796	11598138	That'll be, uh, we'll figure out some stuff with that later.
11598398	11600480	Maybe, uh, I don't know, we'll figure stuff out.
11601541	11604243	So, yeah, too bad I don't have any more porn to give away.
11605444	11606085	That I don't have.
11607126	11609528	Remember your Make Edit Get Porn contest?
11609548	11610889	That was, like, the best thing ever.
11611910	11622659	That was the greatest contest ever, and I remember who won it, and it was great because, you know, when he, um, came over, it was, like, all, like, kinda, here, put it in the bag, put it in the bag.
11624727	11634790	And that was like a whole 50 tapes of, you know, Playboy and softcore porn.
11635431	11636231	So that was great.
11637011	11640172	But MakeEditGetPorn, that was a contest that was wonderful.
11640192	11648135	We'll have to do something similar like that one day, you know, MakeRemixGetPorn or, you know, something like that.
11649356	11649916	But, later.
11650016	11650196	Later.
11651431	11654512	Okay, that would be bigger than any remix contest out there right now.
11654612	11656073	Make remix get porn.
11656113	11659614	Tell me that would not be humongously popular in the Bomani scene.
11659654	11660034	Come on.
11660314	11660934	We've got to do it.
11662675	11663855	Most of the Bomani scene is under 18.
11665876	11666756	But, yeah.
11668337	11670097	Make edit get softcore porn?
11672638	11673538	It's still under 18.
11673578	11673719	Yeah.
11679093	11680094	That would be interesting.
11680134	11680854	Make remix, get porn.
