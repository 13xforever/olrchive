04:55.040 --> 04:58.040
It's very, very sparkling water. I don't think you like some of that.

04:59.040 --> 05:04.040
Yeah, I don't drink soda. I drink Crystal Geyser sparkling mineral water.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.040
Why? Because I like to feign this diet I'm on. Anyway...

05:07.040 --> 05:15.040
Anyway, also joining us, as always, the third wheel of our program, our tech master, Loki.

Anyway, hi. Get the dick out of your mouth. It's time to start the show.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.040
Don't you have anything else to do on Sunday night?

05:52.040 --> 05:58.040
Don't you have villages to burn and convenient stores to rob?

05:58.040 --> 06:01.040
Yay! I'm an angel, I'm not thinking of you like that!

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040

10:08.860 --> 10:32.580
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock This is the way we rock, this is the

10:32.580 --> 10:36.580
The way we fight as we demonstrate, as we demonstrate

10:53.580 --> 10:54.580

10:56.580 --> 10:57.580
This just sounds

10:58.580 --> 10:59.580
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

10:59.580 --> 11:15.420

Another day in my working sunshine

11:34.260 --> 11:37.260
I can't leave all my cares behind now

11:38.260 --> 11:41.260
I'm out to play, gonna have me some fun

11:41.260 --> 11:45.260
In a world that is totally mine

11:55.260 --> 11:58.260
I wonder how I'll see myself come alive

11:58.260 --> 12:01.260
Moving still turns into fear

12:01.260 --> 12:05.260
As the turning happens, I'm still with the light

12:05.260 --> 12:08.260
So my head comes to my feet

12:08.260 --> 12:12.260
When I end up feeling the loss of the life,

12:12.260 --> 12:16.260
I shall rise, staying with the keys.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.260
After moving, I'll dance, I'm still with the vibe,

12:49.260 --> 12:52.260
And even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

12:52.260 --> 12:54.260
Uh, buj- uh, bukkake?

We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

13:02.260 --> 13:05.260
This lovely October evening.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.260
I'm so tired today, I don't-

13:07.260 --> 13:10.260
I don't know if I've got three hours' worth in me.

13:10.260 --> 13:15.260
It's gonna be like squeezing the sponge to get the last, just last little drop out.

13:15.260 --> 13:20.060
But I will do it. For the listeners, I will force myself.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.380
And if you don't do it for them, we'll force you.

13:23.380 --> 13:27.740
We're going to start off tonight's show. We start off every week playing a little bit of

13:27.740 --> 13:31.540
how was your week, how was your day, a chance for you to catch up with us in our

13:31.540 --> 13:35.460
our personal lives. You can be nosy and invade our personal lives and we'll

13:35.460 --> 13:38.040
start by opening up the file on Jamie.

13:38.040 --> 13:41.340
My week was all busy crap.

13:41.340 --> 13:44.660
Busy, busy, busy crap. Lots of stress.

13:44.660 --> 13:47.940
And yeah, that's pretty much my week.

13:47.940 --> 13:51.380
I'm sorry. No specifics you want to give?

13:51.380 --> 13:55.540
No. It was busy. And it's going to be even busier next week.

13:55.540 --> 13:58.540
And...

13:58.540 --> 14:02.540
See, Tuesday when I came home, the business that

14:02.540 --> 14:06.540
was going to cause me to cancel the show... Oh, right. Didn't happen.

14:06.540 --> 14:10.060
Oh, no. And I was all stressing out. Well, you know about that. You told me.

14:10.060 --> 14:13.460
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought it was

14:13.460 --> 14:17.860
something else see I'm so good I have so many things going on right now that I'm

14:17.860 --> 14:24.820
just like it's like a spaghetti at any rate I just said fuck it that night and

14:24.820 --> 14:29.940

14:29.940 --> 14:38.220
so and it's gonna be that way till after Halloween I exactly how I feel yeah all

14:38.220 --> 14:42.780
right well I guess that does it for Jamie's week let's talk to Loki you

14:42.780 --> 14:50.620
want to talk to us about your week? Yeah didn't really do a whole lot

14:50.620 --> 14:54.740
of stuff. What did I do this week? Oh yeah I played Leisure Suit Larry all week

14:54.740 --> 15:01.420
that's pretty much what I did and other than that I played a little bit of Final

15:01.420 --> 15:09.780
Fantasy this weekend and and then what else did I do? I don't know just kind of

15:09.780 --> 15:19.500
hung out trying to stay out of the weather and yeah that's pretty much all

15:19.500 --> 15:23.220
that happened oh and I bought an airzooka yesterday because I was at the mall I

15:23.220 --> 15:30.720
had money I didn't want to buy a game I'm just gonna rent it and so you know I

15:30.720 --> 15:37.000
couldn't leave empty-handed so I got an airzooka instead virgin didn't have any

15:37.000 --> 15:41.760
echo image. Of course, why was I even looking? Because- WHAT?!

15:41.760 --> 15:46.320
Explain what an airzooka is for those listeners that don't know.

15:46.320 --> 15:53.320
It's a giant thing that shoots a ring of air at you. It's like a giant, um, I don't know,

15:53.320 --> 15:57.840
it looks like a giant tube with a big, um, elastic thing at the end and you pull it back

15:57.840 --> 16:01.400
and it creates, like, you know how if you were to blow smoke rings? Well, it does the

16:01.400 --> 16:06.200
same thing. It creates, like, a shockwave of air that goes up to about ten feet and

16:06.200 --> 16:10.640
supposedly harmless and you can like shoot it at animals and stuff and all

16:10.640 --> 16:15.760
that fun stuff that's when Arizona is this giant thing that I wasted a lot of

16:15.760 --> 16:23.920
well not a lot of money but I wasted money on and yeah that's pretty much all

16:23.920 --> 16:31.000
that's been going down sweet doing pretty boring pretty boring oh yeah

16:31.000 --> 16:35.040
that's right oh wait I already talked about my trip though didn't I yeah I

16:35.040 --> 16:41.360
think I did yeah so okay yeah it's pretty boring oh and I saw the grudge

16:41.360 --> 16:47.480
that was cool yeah I'll talk about the grudge in a little bit because I saw it

16:47.480 --> 16:52.120
too but first we'll talk to Arcadian Bradley and talk to him about his week

16:52.120 --> 16:57.520
because I know he had a fun week oh yes I did and it started off really really

16:57.520 --> 17:02.760
fucking shitty but two miles from this leaving the department last week the

17:02.760 --> 17:09.300
Fucking Folsom police department stops me goddamn motherfuckers and says after leaving this show

17:09.300 --> 17:11.500
Yes, right after leaving the show two miles away

17:12.240 --> 17:14.240
Fucking guy pulls me over

17:14.480 --> 17:20.640
And says oh you don't hear registrations out of date. So it's over six months. So we got to tow it

17:21.480 --> 17:23.480
Fuck you don't

17:23.760 --> 17:24.820
Really fucking sucks

17:24.820 --> 17:31.120
At least he didn't get me for speeding because it was right at a fucking place where it goes from 50 to 40 and bust

17:31.120 --> 17:36.520
me for that but he didn't and so he went away says you have money so yeah I do

17:36.520 --> 17:41.320
I went down to the thing and called Rob down to the and so he came and picked me

17:41.320 --> 17:46.440
up and took me home thank you Rob no problem because I was I'm I was dropping

17:46.440 --> 17:51.040
off angel anyway so we're down yeah so sure they can pull you over for fucking

17:51.040 --> 17:54.160
you know expired registration but they never catch anybody that runs the

17:54.160 --> 17:58.760
fucking red lights makes a goddamn left turn when there's a right turn only lane

17:58.760 --> 18:03.740
and fucking just blatantly you know drives like assholes you know they just

18:03.740 --> 18:07.880
totally forget that oh but yeah they can pull me over when they think that I made

18:07.880 --> 18:11.940
an illegal with that I blew through the light and swerved around someone they

18:11.940 --> 18:16.940
say even though I made a legal left turn on a green that's the Folsom PD for you

18:16.940 --> 18:21.740
oh and it also takes two officers for every fucking stop yep you think you can

18:21.740 --> 18:24.860
pull someone over and they just bring their backup because they have that many

18:24.860 --> 18:28.940
officers doing nothing yep they did that and rob mentions a

18:28.940 --> 18:31.980
oh i saw two people and he actually passed me when i was

18:31.980 --> 18:35.340
stopped and god forbid there was actually an accident there because then

18:35.340 --> 18:38.540
they'd get like six cars over there i remember one time that we were sitting

18:38.540 --> 18:42.060
in um subway and my friend accidentally

18:42.060 --> 18:44.620
because they were waving at us and stuff they weren't paying attention they had

18:44.620 --> 18:48.380
it in the wrong gear and accidentally um rear they um hit it

18:48.380 --> 18:53.020
in reverse and like backed into a car and it took six cop

18:53.020 --> 19:00.380
cars to come to the Taco Bell to take down this report. It just frustrated the hell out

19:00.380 --> 19:01.380
of me.

19:01.380 --> 19:07.280
Yeah, bitches. Well, then once I got home, I called my manager and he said, you better

19:07.280 --> 19:12.100
get it out tomorrow because those fees for the tow yards go up astronomically so they

19:12.100 --> 19:15.640
can take away your car after several, like after a number of days, they'll take away

19:15.640 --> 19:21.540
your car, put a lien on it, sell it off. So you want to get it out tomorrow.

19:21.540 --> 19:28.380
So after that I had to wait until like 4am in the morning, call my mom on the east coast

19:28.380 --> 19:33.680
and ask her to put some money in my account and she did it for me.

19:33.680 --> 19:38.700
So in the morning I called my co-worker and she drove me over to the Carmichael DMV and

19:38.700 --> 19:46.340
10 minutes after they opened I paid $319 and got my registration and temporary tags so

19:46.340 --> 19:48.260
I could get a smog check.

19:48.260 --> 19:53.260
And so, from there, since the bus wasn't coming for 30 minutes, I decided, oh, I'll just go

19:53.260 --> 19:57.920
ahead and start walking towards ARC, the American River College.

19:57.920 --> 20:03.000
That took about, by 45 minutes later, I was there, even though my foot was hurting in

20:03.000 --> 20:06.040
the beginning, but it didn't hurt after a while, so that was okay.

20:06.040 --> 20:11.500
But after that, I took a bus from there to Greenback, then from there to Orangevale where

20:11.500 --> 20:12.840
the thing was.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.180
The cohort says, hey, okay, let's see if we can get it out.

20:16.180 --> 20:20.380
So you have to go to Folsom PD and get them to release it.

20:20.380 --> 20:24.260
So you have to like go there and show them that you got your registration and everything.

20:24.260 --> 20:29.220
So after that, so I didn't know about the buses to there, so I started walking towards

20:29.220 --> 20:33.520
Folsom, and I missed the bus that came next, so I said ah let's go ahead and walk.

20:33.520 --> 20:37.860
So I walked another mile and a half down the hill, which wasn't too bad, it was a nice

20:37.860 --> 20:41.180
day out and so on.

20:41.180 --> 20:45.620
Then from there, I walked across the bridge because I missed the bus there.

20:45.620 --> 20:50.260
I kind of just went on and then said, nah, I'll just go walk a bit farther.

20:50.260 --> 20:52.020
So here comes the stupid part.

20:52.020 --> 20:57.180
There's a, I've got like a little, the person at the tow yard set gave me a map, which is

20:57.180 --> 21:03.220
a, you should go to Natoma Boulevard, or Natoma Street, but I thought it was Natomas Street,

21:03.220 --> 21:06.060
and I thought it was like a right turn, so I, when I went to Natomas Street, I went and

21:06.060 --> 21:09.340
turned to the right, and thought, oh, the levers are going up, and I didn't think to

21:09.340 --> 21:13.280
go left and see if there was something up that way. I just went down this, kept going

21:13.280 --> 21:17.760
down this road miles and miles. Didn't ask any directions or anything until I got to

21:17.760 --> 21:22.520
the end, basically to a big cross street. I asked the lady, I asked the lady in the

21:22.520 --> 21:28.660
apartment there, apartment complex says, uh, where's the Tolsom PD? She said, it's Natoma,

21:28.660 --> 21:32.320
there's no Natoma Street, you idiot. She didn't say that, of course, she was probably thinking

21:32.320 --> 21:38.640
it was crazy. It's a crazy guy walking away, a long way. So, after that, I walked back

21:38.640 --> 21:43.100
to the next bus stop, that took me to the end of the street and I had to walk like half

21:43.100 --> 21:49.480
a mile or so down to the PD, they said oh okay here we go, give me a ticket and say

21:49.480 --> 21:53.840
okay oh we got to pay $20, oh fuck, got to go across the street, get money out of the

21:53.840 --> 21:59.060
bank, oh my god, then walked back across the street, paid the money, then got to go back

21:59.060 --> 22:05.720
to the thing, so walked back down to Riley and then got on a bus which was good, the

22:05.720 --> 22:12.240
took me almost there, then paid $175 to the fucking tow yard and got it out and yay. Then

22:12.240 --> 22:15.600
I went back to work for like three and a half hours and then made it up the rest of the

22:15.600 --> 22:21.320
week, basically made up my whole week and that was it for that.

22:21.320 --> 22:25.000
Tough lesson learned to everybody out there. Register your car!

22:25.000 --> 22:31.680
Yeah. Don't fucking drive in Folsom. Stay far away. And then other news, I got keys

22:31.680 --> 22:37.320
to work so I can stay late and lock up the place if I, after everyone else has left.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.880
Well if you want to make, you know, if you want to run through red lights and make illegal

22:40.880 --> 22:47.440
left turns, Folsom's where it's at, because no one gives a shit.

22:47.440 --> 22:53.960
Not broke now, because Mother gave me enough money so that I could do that, do that and

22:53.960 --> 22:58.720
a little bit of extra money, which is helpful because I could go and get a new tear mat

22:58.720 --> 23:03.720
because my other one has a hole in it that's been poking me in the foot for, like, three or four months.

23:03.720 --> 23:08.720
And then go to the Mall of Wart, the Mart of Walls, and buy stuff.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.720
That's what I did today, before coming here.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.720
Fine. There we go.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.720
All right, wow, well, interesting week there.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.720
Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week went.

23:20.720 --> 23:26.720
Well, not much, really. Just school and work.

23:26.720 --> 23:32.280
Although my instructor is becoming quite a flake.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.520
He almost cancels class on Monday.

23:34.520 --> 23:40.880
Eh, well, I suppose he has his own reasons.

23:40.880 --> 23:47.640
Played a little Katamari Damacy and other stuff this week.

23:47.640 --> 23:56.680
Maybe like a couple hours worth of FF11, which is not as bad as you guys, but hey, it's something.

23:56.680 --> 24:04.280
And I also spent some time with, well what, one third of Orange Lounge?

24:04.280 --> 24:08.240
Not the hosts of course, the other people that usually come here.

24:08.240 --> 24:19.620
Last night, and spent an hour waiting to get into dinner, had dinner and watched movies

24:19.620 --> 24:22.020
and stuff last night, that was pretty cool.

24:22.020 --> 24:26.660
Which I don't get to do that often, so that was kind of fun.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.660
And, uh, that's about it, pretty much.

24:31.660 --> 24:32.660
Alright.

24:32.660 --> 24:35.660
I have something else to add, but I think you're gonna talk about it, so I'll let you bring that up.

24:35.660 --> 24:37.660
Okay, I'll, uh, I'll talk about my weekend.

24:37.660 --> 24:42.660
My weekend, my weekend, um, pretty much this week was, you know, pretty, uh,

24:42.660 --> 24:46.660
nothing too wonderful or exciting, but I mean, because I did two live shows this week,

24:46.660 --> 24:51.660
and I ended up filling in for Jamie on Tuesday just because we didn't have a repeat to run,

24:51.660 --> 24:53.660
and I was bored, so I said, what the hell.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.860
So I did that Tuesday and then of course I had the regular show on Wednesday.

24:56.860 --> 25:02.160
And then Thursday I hung out with my friend and pretty much nothing interesting happened until Friday

25:02.160 --> 25:07.160
when I went and saw The Grudge with Loki and his girlfriend and my buddy Christopher.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.660
We went to this theater, my god it was packed.

25:09.660 --> 25:12.560
Not only was the theater packed, but it was packed full of high schoolers.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.260
Because apparently these movies really appeal to the high schoolers.

25:16.260 --> 25:19.560
Boy do we make a mistake going on opening night with all these high schoolers in there

25:19.560 --> 25:22.760
because every scary part of the movie, and there was a lot.

25:22.760 --> 25:28.260
the movie is pretty scary every scary part every all the girls like and like

25:28.260 --> 25:32.180
even it's I don't want to ruin it but there's this one part where the

25:32.180 --> 25:40.380
screaming became almost rhythmic it was like it was really funny I can't if

25:40.380 --> 25:42.860
you've seen the movie you probably could figure out what part I'm talking about

25:42.860 --> 25:48.740
but this is one part where it just was rhythmic it was so funny but then there

25:48.740 --> 25:51.860
was this guy in the back of the theory was being really annoying and you know

25:51.860 --> 25:55.640
the type I'm talking about he's like that high school jock type you sit there

25:55.640 --> 26:00.600
go like making those noises because apparently other high school jock types

26:00.600 --> 26:04.720
find those kinds of noises funny and their girlfriends or whatever so he was

26:04.720 --> 26:11.800
kind of mocking how everybody else was getting scared and apparently this is

26:11.800 --> 26:15.560
funny when somebody does this never mind that it's a sold-out theater and he's

26:15.560 --> 26:19.220
getting on everybody else's nerves in the theater and just bugging the hell

26:19.220 --> 26:22.100
out of all of us you could just feel the tension like everybody just wanted to

26:22.100 --> 26:27.100
turn around and punch this guy in the face am I right Loki sure okay so

26:27.100 --> 26:31.180
finally I don't know what came over me but I just turned it and mind you this

26:31.180 --> 26:33.660
is right at the climax of the movie towards the end the movie he's still

26:33.660 --> 26:37.320
yelling and screaming he's been doing it for five minutes I turn around I look

26:37.320 --> 26:41.500
right at him and I yell in the crowded theater I sell I said with the guy with

26:41.500 --> 26:45.980
the little penis in the back row please shut the hell up and everybody burst into

26:45.980 --> 26:51.820
applause and started laughing and so it was kind of cool and then he shut up so

26:51.820 --> 26:55.500
he knew who he was by the way I addressed him by being the small penis

26:55.500 --> 27:00.980
guy so my advice to you don't be afraid to shout it out if people are distracting

27:00.980 --> 27:03.700
the movie because chances are everybody else around you is finding them

27:03.700 --> 27:06.980
distracting too and they'll back you up they're just being chicken they don't

27:06.980 --> 27:11.540
want to say anything so I can credit my couple years God several years

27:11.540 --> 27:15.020
experience with Rocky Horror Picture Show for making me unafraid to yell back

27:15.020 --> 27:19.300
at a movie so speaking of which I ended up going to see a local production of

27:19.300 --> 27:24.100
the Rocky Horror Show which the movie is based on they did a little bit of the

27:24.100 --> 27:29.020
play here in Sacramento and it's pretty nice rice princess she's been out you

27:29.020 --> 27:31.580
know she's usually on Wednesday nights outside the box but she's been out of

27:31.580 --> 27:34.180
the loop for a couple weeks because she's been doing costuming for this

27:34.180 --> 27:37.820
show so I kind of went to see how that all worked out in the costumes were very

27:37.820 --> 27:41.140
nice as was the choreography a little thing I wanted to mention about it it

27:41.140 --> 27:47.300
was the Broadway version, the one that they played on Broadway in 2000, so

27:47.300 --> 27:49.860
that's where the different, you know, people were talking about, well this isn't

27:49.860 --> 27:53.300
how the original play was because it actually was the the redo for Broadway.

27:53.300 --> 27:56.980
Yeah, original Brian went back into the strip for Broadway. I

27:56.980 --> 28:02.540
recognize it because I have the the 2000 recording and it was it was the it was

28:02.540 --> 28:13.100
the same thing very good so it was a good show I liked it too bad it's over

28:13.100 --> 28:16.740
so I can't really recommend it to anyone else because it's done now Saturday or

28:16.740 --> 28:20.340
today was the last show so if you haven't seen it yet too bad and besides

28:20.340 --> 28:24.100
a lot of you aren't in Sacramento anyway so this means nothing to you but it is a

28:24.100 --> 28:26.580
good play if it comes to your town you should check it out it's pretty funny

28:26.580 --> 28:29.900
how people can yell back even at the actors even when it's not a movie and

28:29.900 --> 28:32.700
and then other than that I've just been doing a lot of rehearsal because there

28:32.700 --> 28:35.180
is going to be another production of the movie soon

28:35.180 --> 28:39.340
which I'm involved with so I've just been very tired going to rehearsal

28:39.340 --> 28:42.700
and things like that and Jamie knows where I'm coming from with that certainly

28:42.700 --> 28:47.660
Amen. I'm just glad I don't have to do prop crew this time around

28:47.660 --> 28:53.260
I mean I like doing prop crew and that's all cool. I'm doing lighting and that means I'm going to just sit on my butt playing with light switches

28:53.260 --> 28:58.660
It's a good job, it's an easy job, it's good. You have a lot of control in that little box

28:58.660 --> 29:01.980
I don't mind the running about. If someone makes you mad, you just turn the light off.

29:01.980 --> 29:05.440
Well, I don't really mind doing the running about, putting stuff up on...

29:05.440 --> 29:08.920
You know, it was fun. But I was exhausted last time I did it.

29:08.920 --> 29:13.540
And, you know what, I'm just gonna sit back because I'm stressed enough. So after

29:13.540 --> 29:17.140
next week, it's just gonna be so tired. Which, by the way, reminds me, you guys,

29:17.140 --> 29:18.940
next week is Halloween.

29:18.940 --> 29:23.420
And so, on Halloween night, it's not looking like we're gonna have a live show,

29:23.420 --> 29:24.740
you guys. Just, you know,

29:24.740 --> 29:28.140
because it's Halloween and people want to go out and do Halloween stuff, we actually don't

29:28.140 --> 29:31.180
think there's enough listener base because you guys will probably all want

29:31.180 --> 29:35.060
to go out and do your own things for Halloween so what I think we might do

29:35.060 --> 29:40.700
next weekend we might do some type of very scary marathon of old orange lounge

29:40.700 --> 29:44.940
episodes we might fit that in next week so that means we definitely get to hear

29:44.940 --> 29:48.520
Loki sing yeah that means episode 69 for sure would be in there because that has

29:48.520 --> 29:53.020
to be the one of the scariest episodes we ever did so we're gonna work something

29:53.020 --> 29:59.220
out where we do a marathon of old episodes so that's pretty much it for my

29:59.220 --> 30:04.000
week of my day nobody had anything remotely DDR related in their week at

30:04.000 --> 30:11.740
all it's just yes angel I was at fries and I met one of our local freestylers

30:11.740 --> 30:19.580
prestige oh okay I've never what is fries the place to play DDR in town now

30:19.580 --> 30:25.860
because I know that what's what's his name online I can't remember Islander I

30:25.860 --> 30:29.740
don't know his real name I can't remember his name online Islander plays

30:29.740 --> 30:33.180
a lot at Fry's from what I hear he plays a lot of DDR at Fry's cuz I guess it's

30:33.180 --> 30:36.780
near his work and then I guess prestige goes there you're going there and you

30:36.780 --> 30:40.880
were playing DDR if Fry's must be the place to be now all of a sudden what

30:40.880 --> 30:43.640
happened to well I mean I know what happened to Golf Land and all the

30:43.640 --> 30:47.120
arcades in town but it's kind of sad when a department store becomes the main

30:47.120 --> 30:53.200
DDR hang out in town. Well I was just shopping for geek stuff and well he was

30:53.200 --> 30:58.640
there and so we just started playing DDR for like 15 minutes and like eyeing the

30:58.640 --> 31:03.400
employees that work there cuz you know I guess they don't see a lot of people

31:03.400 --> 31:09.740
that can actually play the game all day long so that was pretty uh pretty cool

31:09.740 --> 31:15.160
he's pretty good I liked watching him more than I like playing myself but they

31:15.160 --> 31:26.000
had Xtreme up and so we were playing that. It was fun. Good times, good times. So it's

31:26.000 --> 31:30.640
getting sad but there's just you have to understand there's really not a whole lot of reason for

31:30.640 --> 31:36.440
us to go out and play DDR in this town anymore because really nobody's really gotten anything

31:36.440 --> 31:43.800
new in six months at least, when did Golf, I'm sorry, when did Guitar Freaks 9, 10 come

31:43.800 --> 31:44.800
out?

31:44.800 --> 31:48.880
What the hell version do they have anyway, 9?

31:48.880 --> 31:50.960
I could give a shit after 5, really.

31:50.960 --> 31:55.840
They actually still have the same 8th Guitar Freaks, 8th Mix, where they put in Drummani

31:55.840 --> 31:58.480
or Percussion Freaks, 9th Mix, I think.

31:58.480 --> 32:02.360
That's it, Percussion Freaks, 9th Mix, and Guitar Freaks, 8th Mix, which makes no sense

32:02.360 --> 32:03.360
at all.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.360
They have time, it doesn't work, so.

32:04.360 --> 32:05.360
Yeah.

32:05.360 --> 32:16.360
So that's the last new Bomani this town saw anyway, except the step mania machine, but that thing was broken so fast that it, you know, never really got to stick around.

32:16.360 --> 32:24.360
So really, I think at this point a lot of us are just sitting and waiting in anticipation of Ultramix 2, because that's going to be the next big story.

32:24.360 --> 32:29.360
I actually did play DDR Extreme the other day though, it's still really fun to me.

32:29.360 --> 32:34.160
That's one thing I guess I could say for it is that I was playing on the ignition pad trying to work some of my

32:34.160 --> 32:36.800
Fat ass off because I've got a show to do next week

32:37.400 --> 32:40.020
popping music and 2dx8 also

32:40.720 --> 32:44.360
Absolutely, it's gonna be definitely a huge week November 18th when

32:44.920 --> 32:49.200
Festival and pop music 10 and all that fun stuff 2dx8 stock them out, too

32:49.200 --> 32:50.820
Oh, you know we had a trailer

32:50.820 --> 32:53.620
There was a trailer for 2dx8 style that came out not too long ago

32:53.620 --> 32:58.840
We completely forgot to mention it last week, so I'm gonna make sure to bring it up tonight in fact

32:58.840 --> 33:02.440
I'm gonna do that right now. If I can find that. Here it is.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.440
Here's some audio here from a new preview that is out for

33:06.440 --> 33:10.520
2DX8 style. And I'll show this here in studio.

33:10.520 --> 33:15.720
Of course you hear a little bit of Guadeca there.

33:15.720 --> 33:19.840
And it just shows the Konami logos here.

33:19.840 --> 33:25.080
And it says, ooh, 2DX8 style! And it's showing a lot of the screenshots in the game and all these

33:25.080 --> 33:26.200
videos. You see like,

33:26.200 --> 33:33.640
alien world and a bunch of Japanese text something 50 and something 80 I'm sure

33:33.640 --> 33:40.040
somebody in our chat room can translate that there new song

33:40.040 --> 33:54.040
It's a very nice clip there of a Santa song.

33:54.040 --> 33:58.040
This is a new song as well.

33:58.040 --> 34:06.040
Yeah, it's definitely an LED song.

34:06.040 --> 34:11.200
look at that and it says there November 18 and had some clips from the new

34:11.200 --> 34:14.880
videos in there as well so I don't even remember where I got that I think

34:14.880 --> 34:17.540
somebody sent it to me so I would totally pass along where you guys could

34:17.540 --> 34:25.640
get it except I don't remember they said 50 new songs over 80 songs in total and

34:25.640 --> 34:29.840
they're confirming in our chat room Dark Lion XVI says the last song is Nebula

34:29.840 --> 34:34.200
Grasp Grasper was that last song you heard a little clip of there and I the

34:34.200 --> 34:38.060
The one before that was the Santa song that's in the new pop music as well, right?

34:38.060 --> 34:41.740
The one that she sang at Tokyo Game Show.

34:41.740 --> 34:43.420
Correct me if I'm wrong.

34:43.420 --> 34:45.420
I could be.

34:45.420 --> 34:47.420
I don't know.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.420
Alright.

34:49.420 --> 34:53.680
Also in bemoning news this week, we got a little bit of bemoning news.

34:53.680 --> 34:56.300
The box art for UltraMix 2 came out.

34:56.300 --> 34:59.340
You might have seen this at your local store, actually.

34:59.340 --> 35:02.540
And the interesting thing about the box art, though, is that it has a little thing in there

35:02.540 --> 35:07.260
that talks about how it features dance hits like remember how DDR Max said ooh

35:07.260 --> 35:11.860
this features dance hits from Darude and Aurora and all the bands that were in

35:11.860 --> 35:16.340
there and the max 2 is ooh it's Kylie Minogue well this one says featuring dance

35:16.340 --> 35:21.140
hits by delirium we knew that after all right Elvis we knew that rubberneck and

35:21.140 --> 35:25.700
freestylers which isn't ringing a bell with me so I don't think we know about

35:25.700 --> 35:29.300
what this song is and they've tried to do research I think over on the DDR

35:29.300 --> 35:32.660
freak thread but nobody's come up with what song that could be yet so maybe

35:32.660 --> 35:36.060
we'll hear more about that later but we have the Commodores which we know is

35:36.060 --> 35:41.300
Brick House, Nucleus which is jam on it we talked about that before, Captain Jack

35:41.300 --> 35:47.380
I believe the dream a dream booty mix was confirmed previously and now Jason

35:47.380 --> 35:53.920
Nevins presents Holly James well guess what Jason Nevins and Holly James they

35:53.920 --> 35:59.960
only ever did one song together so that pretty much knows I had that song was

35:59.960 --> 36:07.160
just announced recently so anyway we're going to go ahead and play that song for

36:07.160 --> 36:13.200
you guys right now it's Jason Nevins and Holly James and the song is called I'm

36:13.200 --> 36:18.800
in heaven and we'll play that for you guys now this hasn't been confirmed but

36:18.800 --> 36:23.240
it's kind of one of those things where it's like well unless it's a remix or

36:23.240 --> 36:26.400
or something like that, who knows?

36:26.400 --> 36:28.180
So we're gonna play that for you guys right now.

36:28.180 --> 36:31.280
The assumed radio edit would be the version

36:31.280 --> 36:32.580
they'd use in DDR, because we haven't heard

36:32.580 --> 36:34.060
if it's a remix again.

36:34.060 --> 36:36.280
It's kind of unconfirmed, but at the same time,

36:36.280 --> 36:39.520
when it's on the box art, you know, duh.

36:39.520 --> 36:43.180
So here it is, Jason Evans with Holly James, I'm in Heaven.

36:43.180 --> 37:12.180
Come in heaven with you, come in heaven with you.

37:12.180 --> 37:27.380
I don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel

37:27.380 --> 37:30.620
When these feelings I have really are for real

37:30.620 --> 37:34.900
The time is right for this, a love to shine the moon through

37:34.900 --> 37:38.020
But you gotta tell me what you wanna do

37:38.020 --> 38:01.900
I'm in heaven with you

38:01.900 --> 38:05.900
I'm in heaven with you

38:11.900 --> 38:13.900
Heaven

38:19.900 --> 38:21.900
Heaven

38:24.900 --> 38:28.900
Every time you're near I start to lose control

38:28.900 --> 38:32.400
When the thought of you, hits my very soul

38:32.400 --> 38:36.200
When you're lying in my bed, right next to me

38:36.200 --> 38:39.900
That's when it starts to feel, feel like ecstasy

38:39.900 --> 38:45.400
I'm in heaven with you

38:47.400 --> 38:53.400
I'm in heaven with you

38:53.400 --> 39:00.400
I'm in heaven with you

39:00.400 --> 39:10.400
I'm in heaven with you

39:10.400 --> 39:18.400
I'm in heaven with you

39:18.400 --> 39:23.040
I mean, heaven, you

39:25.580 --> 39:28.680
No, no, no, no, no

39:28.680 --> 39:33.520
Heaven, breather for more

39:34.160 --> 39:37.520
No, no, no, no, no

39:37.520 --> 39:39.600
Heaven, Why?

39:41.320 --> 39:44.740
Let your blood shine

39:44.820 --> 39:47.940
Let your blood shine

39:47.940 --> 39:56.940
Let your love shine, let your love shine Let your love shine

39:56.940 --> 40:11.940
I'm in heaven with you I'm in heaven with you

40:11.940 --> 40:26.940
All you want from me All you want from me

40:41.940 --> 40:46.100

40:46.100 --> 40:50.220
listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie

40:50.220 --> 40:56.340
pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away. A friendly public service

40:56.340 --> 41:03.460
announcement from Orange Lounge Radio." We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and

41:03.460 --> 41:08.580

41:30.980 --> 41:37.500

ahead and give somebody call here on the skype line we tried to get him on the

42:02.300 --> 42:05.460
show here last week but unfortunately the connection was really bad so

42:05.460 --> 42:08.760
everybody keep your fingers crossed that the connection is a little bit better

42:08.760 --> 42:12.740
tonight so we've got our fingers crossed yes okay so hopefully he's there and I

42:12.740 --> 42:15.260
don't embarrass myself here on the radio but we're gonna go ahead and give this a

42:15.260 --> 42:27.620
try here I hope it works one reading two ring eating ease three

42:27.620 --> 42:30.620
Okay, Ringy Dingies.

42:30.620 --> 42:34.620
Four Ringy Dingies. God, I hope he's there.

42:34.620 --> 42:35.620
That'd be pretty funny.

42:35.620 --> 42:36.620
Hello!

42:36.620 --> 42:37.620
Hello.

42:37.620 --> 42:39.620
Hi! Is this frequency?

42:39.620 --> 42:41.620
Left.

42:41.620 --> 42:45.620
Oh, no, the connection's still kind of shy. Can you hear me okay?

42:45.620 --> 42:47.620
Yep.

42:47.620 --> 42:52.620
Oh, no, we're still having a problem hearing him. He's very, uh, it's very choppy.

42:52.620 --> 42:59.180
of you only hear a couple seconds here and there and then that's it are you are you i hear you

42:59.180 --> 43:05.020
oh there you go i can kind of hear him oh he says he can hear us okay you might have something with

43:05.020 --> 43:09.420
your mic sensitivity settings i'm having i'm wondering if it's the mic sensitivity because

43:09.420 --> 43:15.340
i heard like a little bit there can you hold the mic up nice and uh oh hi

43:15.340 --> 43:19.340
Yeah.

43:19.340 --> 43:23.340
Okay, so, I'm gonna try and do a conversation here.

43:23.340 --> 43:25.340
How are you doing this evening, frequency?

43:25.340 --> 43:29.340
I'm doing okay. I just woke up from that one weekend.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.340
You know, sort of back to early.

43:33.340 --> 43:37.340
Alright, so tell us a little bit about this tournament that just happened on the East Coast recently.

43:37.340 --> 43:39.340
I was kind of curious about what went on there.

43:39.340 --> 43:42.340
Because we don't get to talk a whole lot about East Coast events on the show,

43:42.340 --> 43:44.340
so I'm kind of curious what went on with this tournament.

43:44.340 --> 43:57.340
...was not so good, um, but not for me, because I'm hanging up the time.

44:14.340 --> 44:18.340
Okay. All right, take care, bud. Bye-bye.

44:18.340 --> 44:22.340
Ah, what a bummer. What a bummer.

44:22.340 --> 44:27.340
I do have another idea, though, but I can't get to it until the next break, but that does give me an idea.

44:27.340 --> 44:31.340
Okay, so I guess we have to shift gears here.

44:31.340 --> 44:37.340
Darn, because I have a lot of good questions I want to ask them, too, and we don't get East Coast people on this show a whole lot, but that's all right.

44:37.340 --> 44:40.340
We'll give it a try later.

44:40.340 --> 44:44.340
Well, moving on, I guess we could talk about other news going on.

44:44.340 --> 44:47.340
Didn't you find some news about Pump It Up that was going on this week, Loki?

44:47.340 --> 44:51.340
You got really bored and you found out that Pump It Up actually had some news going on?

44:51.340 --> 44:53.340
Yeah, there was two things going on.

44:53.340 --> 44:59.340
Number one being, there's another release that's coming out in November, I believe,

44:59.340 --> 45:03.340
and that would be Pump It Up Exceed on the JPS2.

45:03.340 --> 45:04.340
So that's going to be coming out.

45:04.340 --> 45:06.340
God damn it.

45:06.340 --> 45:08.340
Dude, our connection is fucking sucking tonight.

45:08.340 --> 45:16.340
Anyways, yeah, so Pump It Up Exceed, um, it's gonna be coming out. It's gonna be arcade perfect. Um, so they've got 100 plus songs.

45:16.340 --> 45:29.340
Uh, it's gonna be coming out one week before all the DDR stuff. Um, there's rumors though that it's gonna be, uh, coming out also for the US PS2 and the Xbox, uh, later on.

45:29.340 --> 45:40.340
Also, they've added a few different modes in there. They have a mode that's kind of like where you just watch videos, the background videos and that type of thing.

45:40.340 --> 45:56.340
And also, supposedly, the PC version USB pads that shipped with the old version, Premiere, I think actually are going to be working with the PS2 version, so that should be pretty interesting.

45:56.340 --> 46:03.380
interesting looks pretty cool so far other than that starting looks like this

46:03.380 --> 46:10.580
coming week in Korea at Animaro headquarters will be beta testing for

46:10.580 --> 46:15.340
pump it up exceed 2 which they have really released any details on that I'm

46:15.340 --> 46:19.860
sure that'll be coming next week as you know stuff leaks out from the beta test

46:19.860 --> 46:25.540
location. So that's your Pump It Up news.

46:25.540 --> 46:31.660
Exciting. I think it's very strange that Pump It Up could possibly come to the

46:31.660 --> 46:34.380
U.S. That's very strange, and then they're also saying they're rumouring that In The

46:34.380 --> 46:38.060
Groove could be coming to the home versions as well, so it's gonna be very

46:38.060 --> 46:43.540
interesting. I doubt that one, but I do too, but they're saying it, so I guess I

46:43.540 --> 46:49.580
should acknowledge it. I doubt that. But no seriously, McSeed though is doing

46:49.580 --> 46:53.520
extremely well like in some of the other countries that you know non English

46:53.520 --> 47:00.560
countries like Mexico is fucking hot over there and I couldn't I mean why not

47:00.560 --> 47:04.880
try release it over here see how it does because I'm sure I mean most of the

47:04.880 --> 47:07.920
stuff they've got is in-house artists anyways so you're not really you know

47:07.920 --> 47:12.280
gonna lose money on licensing as far as music goes really there's not much to

47:12.280 --> 47:15.720
lose there I mean other than you you know oh you have to make some new pads

47:15.720 --> 47:19.840
or something but I think you'd do pretty well over here you know give it a shot I

47:19.840 --> 47:23.520
mean can't be any worse than like say you know Britney's dance beat and all

47:23.520 --> 47:27.400
that crap I mean at least it's a step above all that stuff so you know hey why

47:27.400 --> 47:33.120
not I think it'd be very interesting if they did give pumping up a home release

47:33.120 --> 47:39.020
for this reason because DDR they've kind of stopped doing the arcade thing and I

47:39.020 --> 47:43.880
think especially with DDR or I'm sorry with Konami USA they've kind of given up

47:43.880 --> 47:48.700
on doing the arcade thing there's not going to be a new arcade mix unless hell

47:48.700 --> 47:52.620
freezes over so basically it is possibility but very low chance low low

47:52.620 --> 47:56.540
low chance so basically they've pretty much stuck to the home versions and I

47:56.540 --> 47:59.600
think everybody understands that the home versions are where they make their

47:59.600 --> 48:03.680
money and economy of America they push the home versions it's their bread and

48:03.680 --> 48:07.980
butter for DDR they see the future of DDR being these home versions and that's

48:07.980 --> 48:11.300
why they never really threw a fit over the import mixes at least as far as I

48:11.300 --> 48:16.860
can tell because the import mixes of DDR arcade kind of serve as promotion for

48:16.860 --> 48:21.460
the home versions so everything works out everybody you know gets their share

48:21.460 --> 48:25.500
well now if pump it up ends up coming up for the home coming out for the home

48:25.500 --> 48:29.420
versions was Konami gonna take issue to that is there anything they can do about

48:29.420 --> 48:33.620
it me I don't know I mean there were those rumors a while back that and amir

48:33.620 --> 48:38.500
own Konami might have had it out in court and that's why I don't know it's a

48:38.500 --> 48:40.580
a bunch of rumors going on out there.

48:40.580 --> 48:41.860
You think Konami would take issue with that?

48:41.860 --> 48:43.420
What do you think would happen?

48:43.420 --> 48:44.260
Anybody have a thought?

48:44.260 --> 48:45.900
Loki, I'd especially be curious what you think of you.

48:45.900 --> 48:47.500
I seem to have a strong opinion.

48:49.580 --> 48:51.020
I don't know if they're legally able

48:51.020 --> 48:52.700
to bring it over here, actually,

48:52.700 --> 48:54.220
because of the whole lawsuit thing earlier,

48:54.220 --> 48:58.880
but I don't know, you can't really,

48:58.880 --> 49:00.940
I mean, DDR hasn't gone after,

49:00.940 --> 49:02.060
you know, Konami hasn't gone after

49:02.060 --> 49:05.780
any of these other games that have similar,

49:05.780 --> 49:07.660
you know, rhythm type things with them.

49:07.660 --> 49:12.740
I'm sure it'll be you know fine they I mean it'd be pretty cheap if they just

49:12.740 --> 49:17.340
like went after him if they started doing well I mean oh yeah well now that

49:17.340 --> 49:22.460
they're doing well I guess yeah we have a problem with it now but yeah I don't

49:22.460 --> 49:28.460
know to be honest I I really don't know but here's the thing here's my concern

49:28.460 --> 49:35.420
okay about in the groove coming to the home console first off I don't think

49:35.420 --> 49:40.780
is gonna happen only because one it's gonna be hard I mean making a console

49:40.780 --> 49:44.900
game is a little harder than making you know just the arcade you know ports and

49:44.900 --> 49:48.260
stuff cuz I mean hell anyone can hook up a PC to an arcade machine it's not that

49:48.260 --> 49:53.660
hard now programming for the home console is a little different well if

49:53.660 --> 49:56.940
it's fucking hard enough they have 11 12 footers in the arcade how the fuck you

49:56.940 --> 50:01.140
gonna play that on a softpad that's never gonna work so that's my concern

50:01.140 --> 50:04.580
right there I don't think it's ever gonna happen I mean it yeah I'm sure

50:04.580 --> 50:11.580
if they'd like to see it happen, but feasibly I don't think it's going to happen.

50:34.580 --> 50:39.060
Huh. I'm not sure. Yeah, I completely forgot about that. You're right, Pump It Up did have

50:39.060 --> 50:44.660
a previous home release on the PC. Not that the dance market on PC is very lucrative.

50:44.660 --> 50:49.420
I believe the folks that created DDR PC found that out the hard way. You know, I saw those

50:49.420 --> 50:55.860
games going for like $10 a pop at Fry's not too long ago. Interesting. Do you think that...

50:55.860 --> 50:58.420
I think I got mine for about the same.

50:58.420 --> 51:02.460
Do you think that Pump It Up coming out for the home version would help DDR? Or do you

51:02.460 --> 51:09.340
think it's going to hurt it? You know, I think that after they compare, but I don't know,

51:09.340 --> 51:14.300
it can depend. There's different factors to consider. I think the biggest turn off is

51:14.300 --> 51:19.140
that you have to get a whole other dance pad for Pump It Up, because although it would

51:19.140 --> 51:24.340
be very easy, you would think, with the ignition pad, you could just use the buttons, the XO

51:24.340 --> 51:28.660
circle square, which are in the corners, but there's no center button. The center doesn't

51:28.660 --> 51:33.140
do anything on those pads, as far as I know, so you're kind of screwed there.

51:33.140 --> 51:37.100
The Pump It Up pads not only do have the corner buttons, they do have the up, down, left,

51:37.100 --> 51:46.140
right buttons also, because those are for song select stuff. They use those. So, yeah.

51:46.140 --> 51:51.320
So theoretically, any DDR pad that has all the corner buttons would work, except the

51:51.320 --> 51:54.780
official Konami ones, because they don't have triangle and, what's the other one that's

51:54.780 --> 51:57.900
missing, they don't have triangle and square on the back like most of the other pads do,

51:57.900 --> 52:01.560
except all the other pads are missing that center button. So, now you gotta have a whole

52:01.560 --> 52:04.980
new dance pad if you wanna play Pump It Up at the home. And how many people are that

52:04.980 --> 52:08.720
obsessed with Pump It Up where they're gonna spend all the money on that? And how many

52:08.720 --> 52:13.400
stores are gonna pick up those Pump It Up pads for commercial sale? Because, you know,

52:13.400 --> 52:17.040
you find those third-party pads in every little store that sells video games now.

52:17.040 --> 52:23.480
Well, you never know. I mean, it could possibly.

52:23.480 --> 52:28.400
could. The possibility's there, but how successful can it be when it's so

52:28.400 --> 52:33.640
limited, when Konami kind of has a grip on it as it is. I don't know. It'd be

52:33.640 --> 52:37.680
interesting. Alright, I guess what we're going to do now is we're going to take

52:37.680 --> 52:42.200
another break. When we come back, we'll hopefully have everything set up so we

52:42.200 --> 52:46.120
can try calling frequency again. That'll be very cool. If not, I guess we'll have

52:46.120 --> 52:50.080
ourselves a cage match. That'll be some fun, and we'll talk about some more DDR

52:50.080 --> 52:56.480
D.R. Bamani when we come back. In this break, let's do, well you know what I kind of want

52:56.480 --> 53:00.840
to do if I can find the music? Let's do some D.R. Disney.

53:00.840 --> 53:05.200
You play fire. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Let's see

53:05.200 --> 53:11.600

53:11.600 --> 53:19.280
Disney stuff's in here. Okay, we'll see what we can do. Oh, I do have the Mickey Mouse

53:19.280 --> 53:23.280
Okay, we have enough to do a break. We'll be back after this.

53:49.280 --> 53:53.280
Who's the leader of the God Professor, you and me?

53:53.280 --> 53:56.280
N-I-C-K-Y-M-I-U-S-E

53:56.280 --> 53:59.280

Opening Theme

54:53.860 --> 54:58.860
Fire!

54:58.860 --> 55:00.860
Fire!

55:25.860 --> 55:27.860
Alright!

56:27.860 --> 56:33.860
Now that's a loud boost!

56:33.860 --> 56:37.860
Now that's a loud boost!

56:37.860 --> 56:40.860
Let my fingers beat me!

56:40.860 --> 56:49.860
Now that's a loud boost!

59:19.860 --> 59:47.860
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

59:47.860 --> 59:51.100
new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

59:51.100 --> 59:55.140
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music & More

59:55.140 --> 59:56.860
program. Can we talk about that?

59:56.860 --> 01:00:01.660
No subject will ever be taboo. Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.300
the volume from Tuesday nights.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.460
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:11.700
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.300
station?

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:17.660
I collect your fucking head. Just like this fucker here.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:24.660
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:32.660
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.660
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:44.660
You know what I never understood, Jamie, is why does your voice sound so different in that promo?

01:00:44.660 --> 01:01:00.020
in that promo I think so I think so now I'm gonna I got this new thing for Skype

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:03.180
that allows us to dial phone numbers so I'm gonna try this real fast I'm gonna

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:07.260
do a test I hate to do this live on air but damn it I want this to happen

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:12.700
Ooh, it worked. What the hell do you want?

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.300
I think it worked. Hello, can you hear me on this thing?

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:21.660
Yeah, there's a delay, but that's cool. I'm on a phone, and I'm here.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.180
You need to hang up. We don't want any. Alright, I'm hanging up on him. Cool, it worked.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.740
Okay, so hopefully we can do that and make it work. It's a little quiet,

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:34.580
but maybe I can tweak the volume settings in there and get it to work. Would you like to take a survey?

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.180
you're crazy

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:42.100
no no I'm not crazy

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:49.100
I'm slightly strange Loki's the crazy one with his portal to hell and all that

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.540
all right how's it going there Loki you're trying to figure out what that

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.500
freestyler song could be huh

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.820
you're trying to do research there what were you doing there earlier you were hacking

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:08.140
that master file thing that I don't even I can't even remember what the hell this

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:16.540
thing is it's the master song list I was looking at it from well this is from

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:21.620
its document that or it's a file that's in well this one's in the DDR extreme

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:26.780
USA CD or DVD so I was looking to see because there are so there's a few songs

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:31.620
in there I see some from the new new dancing stage game that's gonna be

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.700
coming out then there's a few that I didn't recognize so I was just seeing if

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:39.620
I could figure it out because I'm in here remember we you know reported it a

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:45.620
few weeks back about superstar that's in there so you know just stuff like that

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:54.460
so I was just seeing if it might be in there it might be you never know what is

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.380
that you know I found I had the microphone in my lap and people can hear

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:09.600
me being I am I'm sure my bad all right I guess we're going to do is go into the

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.640

you're out of here but let's have one more moment to remember the echo image

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:52.080
the very first song ever to be retired in the orange lawn radio cage match here

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:56.400
let me feel if the song near the song was called come back and here's a little

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.400
a little bit of comeback for you to remember this song by.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.400
Alright, that's enough of this song. You've heard enough of it over the past four weeks.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:28.400
All right, so you get three brand new songs in their entirety tonight, each host bringing

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:34.440
one song to the table. And who's going to go first tonight? I guess I will, why not?

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.960
I never get to go first, because I hardly ever win this thing. So, I'm going to go first

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:44.280
tonight. I'm going to play my song, and whoops, that's not the song I'm doing. My song is

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:51.280
a song by Ian van Dow, who is the guy who did Will Eye from DDR Max 2, and he has a

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.680

Or is it time to say goodbye Where is love

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:55.760
Give me a reason To hold on to what we've found

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.760
Must be a reason

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.760
To hold on to what we've got

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.760
Time has come to set things right

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.760
Is it worth another fight?

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.760
Tell me the truth

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.760
Is there something on your mind?

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.760
Tell me what you hide inside

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.760
Tell me the truth

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Give me a reason

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.760
To hold on to what we've got

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.760
Must be a reason

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.760
To hold on to what we've got

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.760
Give me a reason

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.760
To hold on to what we've got

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:57.760
There must be a reason To hold on to what we've found

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:08.760
Are there things that I should know Will you stay or will you go?

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:18.760
So where is the love? Tell me, is there hope inside?

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.760
Galleries between the lines

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.760
Where is the love?

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.760
Give me a reason

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:52.060

Hold on to what we got, must be a reason

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:12.520
Hold on to what we've got, give me a reason

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:36.280
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.000
That was Ian Bandau with Reason.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.240
Let's go around and see if they had a reason to like or hate this song in the studio.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.240
Jamie!

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.240
It's fancy.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.240
Um...

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.240
Again, I'm really burned on tonight.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.240
But it's not bad.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.240
I mean...

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.240
I've heard it before.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.240
Um, it's a 7. 7 and a half.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240
I actually thought Jamie would give it a lower score,

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.240
because I remember her saying she was sick of trance.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.240
But damn it, I'm out of songs!

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.240
That's a new one that I happen to like.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.240
Bradley, what'd you think?

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.240
I thought it was pretty good. I'd give it an 8.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:18.640
I'm not sick of trance, but I'm sick of Ian VanDahl, so I think it's a 6.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.640
I like it.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.640
It's happy.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.600
It's not my favorite Ian VanDahl song, but I think it is worthy of a cage match title.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.600
I give it an 8.5.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:31.000
Uh, Ian VanDahl's cool, uh, I give it an 8.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.200
Alright, let's go on to song number 2, which is coming to us courtesy of the lovely Dark

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200
Sakura.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.600
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us tonight?

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.800
Well, I need to find the name of the song again, because I remembered that you had it because you burned my CD.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.700
Let me give you a hint. The song is called Everybody Wants You to Emerge.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.900
That's it. It's a mix of Emerge by Fisher Spooner, and uh...

01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.100
Where's the other group?

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:59.600
Billy Square, and just... I don't know. I like to mix.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:06.300
So, I picked that. Because I had picked out, like, this remix of Bustin' Move, as in Young MC.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.600
Yeah, I saw that when you sent the file over earlier.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:15.600
I was in my car and Emerge is on my CD and I was like, I'll take this one. I think I'll do more of them.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.600
And this comes from the Queer Eye for the Stray Guy soundtrack, right?

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.600
Yeah.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.600
And every song on there is a good DDR song. Whether you love or hate the show, it's got a great bouncy soundtrack to it.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.600
So, let's see if this...

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.600
Amazingly enough, I don't like the opening song.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.600
Yeah, that's kind of weird, huh? I know, the opening song is like too gay, but the rest of it's really good.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:44.560
good all right oh you should you should have heard the thing on Tuesday I did a

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:54.880
whole did you hear oh I did a whole block of 90s dance oh I remember being

01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:02.520
in mobile and my friends little Honda thing listening to the station play all

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.480
those copy dancey stuff like that and and then I'll submit though and like

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.640
let the music play what I was going to be having and then I'll go back to the 90's copy

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:14.780
if for some reason heaven forbid Orange Moms Radio ever went belly-up and we

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:18.040
weren't doing this show anymore I think I would have to start an early 90s dance

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.080
music station. I would be rad. Maybe we just ought to start one anyway, compete with

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.800
ourselves you know hey there's somebody out there that I know we're trying to

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.440
negotiate with somebody out there to do a new show on our network and so they're

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.960
thinking of ideas for the show there's a great one right there and I know you

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.520
like that kind of music person in San Diego they have an 80s and 90s radio

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.160
station it's the best of both decades

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:51.640
all right popular when I get Grand Theft Auto tomorrow all right anyway anyway

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.140
We're getting way off subject, we're getting way off subject, way off subject.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:12:00.140
Let's go to Fisher Spooner vs. Billy Splier with Everybody Wants to Emerge. Enjoy.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:41.140

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:06.140
You want it too

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.140
You want something

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:47.260
Song number two in tonight's cage match, Fisher, Spooner vs. Billy Swire.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:49.540
Everybody wants you to emerge.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.900
Let's emerge our decisions on that song.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:53.900
Jamie?

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.180
You know, I really like that mix of it.

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:02.260
It wasn't quite what I had remembered it to be, but I still like it, so it gets an A from

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:03.260
me.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:07.580
One of these days I'm going to bring you a new song.

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:13.580
I was going to say, it samples an old song in there, because I've heard that old song at the raids before, I'm almost positive.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:22.580
Well, Emergent is really cool, the song itself, but I mean, I really like that mix, because it's a lot different than the original.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.580
Okay. Alright, let's go on to Bradley.

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:31.580
I had no idea what the hell they were saying, and it filled me with eh, so I gave it a 5.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:43.380
lucky I second that it was just like it got annoying sorry I actually when I

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.820
heard that song I kind of thought this might be like a guitar freaks fun song

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:58.020
it's kind of funky I like it seven angels pretty cool um seven and a half

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:02.740

Alright, gotta love Loki.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:45.940
Song number three in tonight's cage match from the Team America World Police soundtrack

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:53.340
America fuck yeah fuck yeah or fuck no Jamie it would be a humorous song for

01:19:53.340 --> 01:20:02.220
about ten minutes right I don't know I have no desire to see the movie fair

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:09.660
enough Arcadian fuck maybe you're like this seven seven one five

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.660
Alright, Loki.

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:19.660
I give it a 10. I was specifically instructed by my girlfriend not to sing the song any longer, so I give it a 10.

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:27.660
I hope you don't sing that while you're trying to have sex. Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! That's beyond!

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.660
I give that song the same score I'd give the movie a 4.

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:35.660
Angel.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:39.660
No, a four out of ten.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:43.660
Um, it was okay. I was seriously in the movie last night.

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.660
Okay, that's a touch point.

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.660
Um, five and a half.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:51.660
Go see what?

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.660
You could go see a good movie instead.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:57.660
Probably.

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.660
Seriously?

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:04.660
If you're gonna go see a movie, go see The Garage, but go on a school night where the kiddies can't go.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:09.360
Alright, you've heard what we think, now it's time to hear what you think.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:15.360
You're gonna decide tonight's winner from three brand new songs while Loki throws pens at me in anger of my score.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.360
Alright, let's hear a clip from all three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:36.520
Song number one you can vote for tonight is Reason by Ian van Dowl and song

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:41.080
number two in tonight's cage match is Fisher Spooner versus Billy Squier

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.080
Everybody wants you to emerge.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:59.800
And song number three in tonight's cage match from the Team America World Police Soundtrack

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:13.800
Fuck America, fuck yeah.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:18.680
Place votes now, send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your votes.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.240
Song number one, song number two, or Skye number three.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:28.320
Song number three, your votes can decide it all.

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.560
You know the scary thing though about that Fuck Yeah song is it's actually, if you took

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.420
out the lyrics, it kind of sounds like a Guitar Freak song.

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.420
It really does.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:37.420
Yeah.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.420
Like an old one.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.380
We're losing you there.

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.380
Adjust the bottom mic there.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:43.380
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.380
There we go.

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:50.060
Especially with the speeding up like bass drum part, or kick drum or whatever.

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:56.520
Just like the little synthesizers and everything kind of make it, yeah, it makes it, it gives

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.520
Is it that sound?

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.520
Alright.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.520
You know what it sounds like?

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.520
It sounds like limousine.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.520
It's like PBR.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.520
PBR.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520
Like the end of PBR.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.520
That's what it sounds like.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520
Kinda.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520
It sounds like limousine.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.520
God, I haven't heard limousine in a long, long time.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520
Limousine!

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520
Strong back.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:16.000
Oh boy, oh boy.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.600
I can't believe that this is the first time we've had to retire a song.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.840
You know we've been doing the cage match for almost two years now?

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.760
That's the first time we've had to retire a song.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.600
We actually haven't done the cage match since episode one.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.960
It was something we added to the show when we went three hours on episode 20, I think?

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.800
Because the show only used to be two hours.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.800
All right.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.320
All right, what we're going to do now, we're going to try and get that connection that

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.380
we had earlier.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.520
We were trying to get frequency for the East Coast on the phone.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.080
You guys, I'm sure you know this guy.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:49.440
If you're on DDR Freak, if you're on Bomani Style, I think he's a mod on both those sites.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.440
He's definitely out there.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.240
If you're on the East Coast, you definitely, definitely know who this guy is.

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:57.240
So we're going to give him a call because we want to ask him some questions that were kind of spawned from last week's show.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.240
So let's have a look and see if we can get frequency on the show.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.240
Hello.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.240
Hi, is this frequency?

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.240
Yes, it is.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.240
Hey, how are you doing?

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240
I'm doing okay.

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.240
Good. Oh, I'm so happy we can finally hear you a lot better.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:15.240
It's going to be unfortunately a little bit quiet to our listeners, but that's kind of the best that we have to do right now.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.240
But at least we can hear you fine here in studio, so that's the important thing.

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.240
Great. Fantastic.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.240
Alright, so, how you doing? How was your week?

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:28.240
Um, the week was fine, um, you know, no problems there.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.240
So, oh, look at that, interference from the guy next door, that's great.

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.240
The guy next door has a ham radio and I like to interfere with all the electronics in my house.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.240
I think it's just the forces don't want you to come on this show.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.240
I guess so.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.240
I guess is what it is, oh well.

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:54.040
So, as I was trying to ask you earlier before Skype was cutting us off, you went to a tournament

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.960
this past weekend. Tell us a little bit about this tournament, because we're here on the

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:00.520
West Coast, we don't know anything about what's going on in the East Coast, and that needs

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:05.120
to change. So, inform us on what was going on with this East Coast tournament.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:11.680
The East Coast tournament was, the tournament itself wasn't really a good tournament, in

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:20.040
In my opinion, a lot of the stuff just ran wrong and things weren't properly organized

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.200
and things like that.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:27.440
And we, after the entire thing was done with, we realized what the problems were and we're

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.760
going to fix those for the next years and things like that.

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:37.660
But as publicity for DDR, it skyrocketed.

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.560
We actually had a caller last week, Zaku called in, he said something about the crowds that

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.960
had come to the DDR tournament were bigger than the ones for, what, the Blue Man group

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:46.960
and...

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:52.040
Yes, it's literally, you could literally pick any exhibition that was there.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:55.940
Blue Man group was there for an hour, Ludacris and some other Def Jam artists were there

01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.920
for an hour, for a little while, Opie and Anthony were there for a little while.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.660
Opie and Anthony was the only one he mentioned.

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:06.560
They're hacks anyway, no I'm kidding.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.560
So they were all there, but we still had a crowd no matter what.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:19.560
Like, you know, these people when they came, they had a crowd for a little while, and then when the people left, there was no crowd at the other people's booths anymore.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:29.560
Because these people were representing on XM radio and other, you know, like O.B. Anthony was at XM radio for like an hour or something like that.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:36.560
Obviously they had a crowd for a little while, you know, but you know, you can only stay so long and listen to Nate O'Bannon, I guess.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:44.560
But yeah, everyone was, everyone just stayed and watched people step on arrows all day. It was amazing. It was truly amazing.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.560
Even Perfect Attack.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:54.560
Yeah, more so than Freestyle, actually. There was a lot of people watching Perfect Attack that, you know, were just like, wow, this is amazing how they do that.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:00.560
And half the people are like, even though they don't know what they're doing, they still want to know how they do that.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:16.560
But, publicity-wise, Sammy, the person who put these women together, and myself, made a whole bunch of contacts on Thursday because the press was the people who allowed it on Thursday.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.560
I was going to say, I bet a lot of press was at this event.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:24.560
Yeah, we had a lot of press, and...

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:31.560
So does this mean we can be looking forward to seeing DDR in the news anytime soon, or in the press? Some big stuff?

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:39.560
Maybe not in the news and the press. There's already been enough stuff in the news and the press that it's in the wrong angle.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.560
That's true. I guess that's very true.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.520
the the problem is that the angle is

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.220
is uh... weight loss everyone like that weight loss angle and everyone you know

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:53.060
jumps on that i was at the box news a couple weeks ago i was actually ask you

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.380
about that the fox news the the fox news thing

01:27:56.380 --> 01:28:00.660
i'll tell you exactly what happened what they did was on friday that i get a call

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:02.680
from uh...

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.940
and i'm i'm like yeah sure i'll come in they just want to be a lot of what okay

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.360
i could give you a lot

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.860
so i come in

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:09.600
uh...

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.200
next day because that's when they want me to be interviewed live next day with no preparation

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.000
uh i'm sitting in the briefing room not getting briefs i was actually sitting next to the person

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.080
who was interviewing me and i had absolutely no idea until like i was actually called in

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:31.120
wow and when when i got into the studio the first thing the girl says is well you're not a kid and

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.480
i'm like no sorry someone should have probably informed you about something too what they thought

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.200
they were getting a twelve-year-old what yeah and I do have a thought they thought

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.640
a twelve-year-old was gonna end up coming in and doing interview I remember

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:47.120
that because we were watching the clip here in studio during a show about a

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:50.340
month ago and we were you know having a little fun with how kind of bad the

01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:53.280
interviewer was the person was interviewing you and it sounded like she

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.800
was talking down to you like a lot of the questions she was asking I remember

01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.040
didn't she say at one point in the interview gosh you're how old are you

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:05.440
yeah yeah I was 21 but the thing that got me the most was when you when she

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:12.120
said, you're part of the DDR freaks, and I'm like, are you serious? Are you serious? Are

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.880
you really, what are you doing to me right now?

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.220
It's obvious they hadn't done any research.

01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.160
So like, I mean, I'm doing it for DDR, you know, to get the publicity up there for it,

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:26.440
so even though it's just the wrong angle for it, I mean, I tried to jump onto, you know,

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.400
the competition thing, she just tossed it right off of that, so regardless, they're

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:36.720
not ready for it. Right. But, you know, upcoming now. Wait, actually, I have a quick question

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.360
for you. I have a quick question for you though, before we change the subject. Do you think

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.040
that part of that might be Konami's fault? Because Konami's kind of going the weight

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:52.040
loss angle with this? Um, Konami hasn't done much. I'll tell you right now, they haven't

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:57.880
done much in the publicity of DER. They, um, you know, and they don't really need to, because

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:03.320
very true. It just so happens that mixes keep selling, home mixes at least, keep selling.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.080
Word of mouth is a powerful thing.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.800
Yeah, it just happens.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:12.480
You know, people see these dance mats in the game stores, and they're like oh, what does that go with?

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.680
And they go with this D.P.R. game.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.600
You know, and they buy it, they take it home, and there's a lot of people who actually play it home, and they just don't

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.520
know about the

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.440
you know, community behind it, and its competition, and

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.440
how big this can really be.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.900
Konami really actually doesn't do much, but this upcoming year, you might see some stuff coming out.

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:34.200
Interesting. So I guess other little things you probably can't talk about?

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.420
Um, I can talk about them. It's just that a lot of the stuff is, um, you know, it works.

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:43.340
You don't want to say anything and then not have it happen?

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:47.160
Um, I'll say what we want to do. I'll say what we're planning.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:47.720
Cool.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:55.240
First off, first off, we have a, uh, Sammy and I have a meeting with Ziff Davis Media tomorrow at 11 a.m.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:59.600
of now they're part of davis media the folks that run g_-four tech tv

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.200
uh... they might be i'm not too sure about you know the whole no contest

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.080
results

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.040
i think but i don't know that

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.200
these are the people who put together the actual uh...

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.680
convention last weekend okay

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.760
and they got microsoft an exam in intel

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.020
uh... that's why all of the company's come down and you know

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.400
exhibit the stuff

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.720
so they were so interested in or place

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:27.700
uh... that they want to set up the next year's tournament

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:30.600
with my sponsors and

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.960
and you know like they want all these companies that came to the

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.880
the convention

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.780
to help sponsor us in whatever way possible and we're looking at

01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:40.220
a really big

01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:42.300
grand prize at the end of it

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.920
uh... no real dollar amount

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:50.120
but we're looking at something huge, something enough to get like

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.280
many more people to end up coming out

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.700
correct me if i'm wrong, but this is coming off the heels of a thousand dollar grand prize

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.700
tournament, correct?

01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:58.700
Yes.

01:31:58.700 --> 01:31:59.700
And you guys talk about something bigger.

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:00.700
Right.

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.700
Wow.

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.700
Very nice.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:09.060
So, I mean, the $1,000 is actually put up by Sammy, but if we have people who, you know,

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:12.960
like Microsoft, who want to put up some crazy amount of money, you know, especially when

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.500
the swarm is going to end up happening later on next year, that people, you know, by the

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:23.100
time this actually ends up happening, hopefully through all the publicity that we get, people

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:28.820
people understand that, you know, DDR is out there, it's a big thing, you know, that's

01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:31.020
what we're looking to do.

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:36.100
Another meeting I have coming up soon is with Fuse TV, I don't know if you guys get that

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.100
out there.

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.620
Uh, they used to be much music, right?

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:39.800
Weren't they much music?

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.060
And then they turned into Fuse?

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:42.380
I think that sounds about right.

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.300
I think it's a subscription channel out here.

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:45.300
Yeah.

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.300
But I've heard of them.

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:51.220
So, we have, I have a producer contact that I actually made, and he absolutely adores

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.220
the game.

01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:56.380
just found it on Thursday when he showed up and he absolutely adored the game

01:32:56.380 --> 01:33:00.740
when he first saw it so I have a meeting with him in a couple of weeks and we're

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:08.940
gonna pitch an idea both together to fuse about a weekly DDR show a weekly

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:13.180
DDR show weekly not some kind of DDR special you're talking about like a

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:18.460
weekly DDR show right exactly we're looking we're probably looking at like

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:23.460
The only idea was that, so far, that I've had was a weekly tournament, and...

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:28.460
Is this the OMG DDR game show that people have talked about for years?

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.460
I've never heard of that, actually, but uh...

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:33.460
I see these threads occasionally on the message board where they're like,

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:37.460
OMG DDR game show type thing, could DDR be a game show?

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:41.460
Maybe it's just that it's a couple years ago and I'm...

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.460
I don't know, it just seems like I've seen these kind of ideas going around before

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:47.460
where people are like, OMG, they should have a DDR TV show and stuff,

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:50.140
show and stuff and now you're saying that

01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:52.820
that's exactly what you're going to go pitch in a couple weeks

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:53.980
it's not

01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:57.180
it's probably not going to end up being a game show it's going to be

01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:59.040
something like uh...

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.900
uh... do you remember i don't even know if you guys had this out here do you guys remember when they

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:07.200
had this thing called the WMCA championships

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.980
it was that martial arts championships they used to

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:13.980
televise NMTV and they had all these characters and they had like the locker room scene

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:15.340
where people get mad at each other

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:21.540
I actually remember this. It was a lot like the WWF except it was karate. I do remember seeing a couple episodes of this.

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.340
He used to be on channel 31, remember?

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:30.140
I believe, probably it wasn't the same channel here, but you know, I think I want to do something similar to that.

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:31.940
You know, like,

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.460
tournaments end up meeting the real world and MTV kind of thing.

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:38.060
You know, so it gets

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.220
kind of like, so you know the players,

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:43.500
you know, and I'm not gonna like,

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.140
force them with

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:49.060
uh... acting because these are the your players are not all actors right

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:49.700
so like

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:52.740
but we can't we can't like to choose our players either we won't be

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:55.380
one of you know if you take some good players in other words you're not going

01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.700
to ham it up like wrestling

01:34:57.700 --> 01:35:00.740
yeah we're not going to work uh... you know we're probably going to show how

01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:04.180
people trained and maybe some interviews and maybe some

01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:08.340
little cute skits in there but a lot of it's going to be at the uh... in my

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.700
my thing we're going to actually just end up doing like

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.780
a weekly tournament you know like red teamers blue team

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:17.460
you know, try to ham it up for a little while, maybe like a BattleBots kind of thing where

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:21.020
every like month we end up doing a championship or every few months or something like that,

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:25.380
and they get some kind of crazy trophy that we like, you know, pass around, you know,

01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:36.380
but, but uh, but that's, what, heh, why don't you bring that up? Sammy, Sammy actually got

01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:41.780
a call last week from someone from Konami who happens to actually end up being the VP.

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:48.780
The VP is very, very interested in sponsoring the tournament in 2005.

01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.780
Interesting.

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:56.780
Yes, and considering now that we have this contact here, which is going to be, you know, a huge contact.

01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.780
This is a huge, huge contact for us.

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:07.780
If we have this contact here, which we obviously do, we can usually get the OK to do a lot of stuff, you know?

01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:10.780
And that's what we're going to end up trying to do.

01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:14.620
We're gonna try to, you know, push DDR just because of the love of the game.

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:17.180
We're not even getting paid to do this, you know, we're just pushing this game to show

01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:22.660
it out, you know, get it out there, and to the public, and we want to see more people

01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:26.940
in competition get this thing mainstreamed, and my personal goal is for it to be as big

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:30.380
as the sporting events that are out there, you know, the Yankees and the Red Sox that

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:33.860
were out, you know, last week, everyone was watching that on the East Coast, at least,

01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:40.620
I don't know what you guys are doing out there, you know, so, like, I want to have it so DDR

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:45.180
up you know the television maybe ESPN or whatever and everyone knows you know

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:49.940
what a great is and how many how many greats the JSB gets on this song and

01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:54.860
everyone knows the stats and knows you know the players you know and roots for

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:58.380
their favorite team like the New York Blue Impulse versus the California Trip

01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:01.540
Machines or whatever that's what we're looking that's what we're looking to do

01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:04.660
that's a hell of a goal but that's a neat goal

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:07.980
yeah that's that's that's low key look like you want to say something here

01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:13.980
That's what we're pushing for, and I want to expect that there's going to be a huge jump in publicity in this next coming year.

01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:30.980
It might end up being looking like that, at least for this first year coming, but with a lot of the more context that we're getting,

01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:38.220
you know especially Konami it looks like it that there might be more push for it

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:44.540
you know considering it's a new it's a new genre of video game is already a

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:51.380
sport in Norway you know so it's got potential it reminds me though of like

01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:56.140
that webcomic that's 10k commotion or whatever it's just like you know with

01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:59.940
all the DDR drama and you have the teams competing a giant like tournament thing

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:04.940
It seems a lot like that. Now if that's a bad idea, I think that's a pretty cool idea.

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:12.940
Well, you know, there's drama everywhere. There's drama in celebrities and stuff like that, so it's not going to be, you know, more common.

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:22.940
I'll tell you what, if you ever want to take the DDR drama angle with this show, like Degrassi DDR League or whatever, I could give you pages and pages of real life inspired drama.

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:25.940
I think just about everyone knows that.

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:34.940
You know, getting out of the tournament last week, a lot of the people actually ended up thanking Sammy for putting together the tournament, blah, blah, blah.

01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:39.940
And to tell you the truth, Sammy screwed up a lot of things about the tournament.

01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:46.940
And there were a lot of things that if he was more prepared, he would have actually ended up doing better work with it.

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:50.940
You know, and I ended up trying to fix a lot of it behind the scenes and things like that

01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.940
and a lot of people don't even remember me being there, you know.

01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:58.940
And it's annoying at one extent and it's not too bad at another

01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:01.940
because, you know, I kind of don't want to be attached to the tournament

01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.940
because of the tournament being actually too bad

01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:06.940
and I'm more attached to what happened otherwise.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:10.940
But, I mean, there was this one incident during Freestyle

01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:19.940
where Team Element from upstate New York came in to do the routine, obviously, to the guys.

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:26.940
And what happened was they went up for the first time, and Sammy wasn't ready with the camera.

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:32.940
So Sammy says, wait, wait, wait, and tells one of the other staff members to reset the machine while they're mid-play.

01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:36.940
Well, not mid-play, but they actually got into about ten seconds of the routine.

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:42.440
So Sammy goes, oh I didn't know they started already, that wouldn't have been fine, don't worry about it, just start up again.

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:47.440
So they're like okay fine, so they start up again, and the problem here was that they forgot mirror.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.940
And we actually ended up forgetting to put event mode on, but that wouldn't have mattered if they wouldn't have failed.

01:39:52.940 --> 01:40:00.940
So what happened was they ended up actually failing halfway through the song, you know the fail screen comes up because they forgot to put mirror on.

01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:01.940
Bummer.

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:05.860
you know so then they go ahead and they're like oh what the fuck you know

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:09.860
we've had it right the first time blah blah and and then we're like okay you

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:12.220
know we'll just go again and we'll figure out something later so they went

01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:16.900
again they finished their routine you know and we figured out you know I was

01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:20.980
right in the beginning I said they're disqualified and the reason I said that

01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:27.660
was because when you do a routine everything about the routine is routine

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:35.660
when you put options on, when you put your clothes on, when you do the routine, everything is routine.

01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:40.660
There's no real excuse of not putting an option on.

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:44.660
So you're saying the second they turn the machine over to you, it's routine time?

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:50.660
Right, exactly. Once you have the option of choosing a song, making your options, blah blah blah blah,

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:56.660
it's routine to you, and it's part of the routine that's going to come out in the show to us.

01:40:56.660 --> 01:41:00.180
You know what, I can see why you're coming from that angle though, because a lot of what

01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:04.620
you just talked to us about, about this DDR TV show and stuff, you kind of were talking

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:08.380
a little bit about kind of the hype behind it a little bit too.

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.780
So I think, and we don't see this enough in freestyle, at least I don't see it enough

01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:15.740
out here, but there's not often a lot of build up to these routines.

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:19.340
The routine is only the minute and a half, but yet they'll give you three minutes to

01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:23.020
do something, yet people usually just choose to do something for a minute and a half, even

01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.340
though they could probably have a lot more fun with it.

01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:29.340
There's also a lot of the problem that people just aren't prepared for freestyle anymore.

01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:32.340
There's no real big pot for freestyle anymore.

01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:35.340
You know, everyone wants the expert tech, no one really freestyles,

01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:37.340
no one really thinks they're good at freestyle,

01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:40.340
people think they're good at freestyle and they really aren't.

01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:44.340
You know, it's just like, there's not a lot of people that jump out there,

01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:47.340
get the job done, you know, and look awesome doing it.

01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:49.340
At least out here I've seen it.

01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:56.020
You know, people just, you know, don't put themselves together and make a good routine.

01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:00.340
To tell you the truth, when I did the Sports World Tournament two years back for Drifting

01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:06.500
Away, there was a, I actually was planning to do insertion for a month.

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:11.540
I did this routine for about three, three and a half weeks, putting together every step,

01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:15.540
every arrow, had a move to it, blah, blah, blah.

01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:19.820
And at the end of it all, about three or four days before the competition, I scrapped the

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:20.820
whole thing.

01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:26.540
I don't even know why, I think I just got sick of it or whatever, and I ended up drifting

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.540
away.

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:34.500
And the day before, I literally slapped together, won the whole tournament, and that was the

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:35.500
story about that.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:40.820
Well, you know, the practice of building the other routine, though, probably kind of helped

01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.460
in making the second routine, right?

01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:45.500
Did you end up taking elements of your insertion routine?

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:51.020
Well, I don't know, like, there was more leeway with drifting away.

01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:56.940
Drifting away's Trick Little, No Freeze has no arrows for the first half of it, so you'll

01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:01.060
see me get off the pad and do whatever for a while and, you know, like I had more freedom

01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:02.060
to do what I wanted.

01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:03.700
With insertion, there was a whole lot of arrows.

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:07.740
I just loved the saw insertion, but the problem was there was so many arrows, you know, there

01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:11.940
was a lot of stuff to work with and there was a big risk of me failing and, you know,

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:17.780
I don't like the total big risk of failing, you know, at least back when I was actually

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:18.780
competing.

01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:23.560
Although I might be competing soon because of the tournament last week.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:32.260
What happened was Sketch and Visor had a first place routine and it was a phenomenal routine

01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:37.540
and they got inspired through a lot of my stuff but I kind of got inspired to go ahead

01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:42.260
and beat their routine with something that I'll come out with later, and I have ideas

01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:47.460
in my head that are jumping around, and I can't really tell, not because I don't want

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:54.460
to, but because I'm not sure when I'm going to compete. But I want it to be in any place

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:59.460
that we're going to tape it and show it online, unlike the dropout freestyle that's still

01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:03.340
sitting on my side and no one knows what it looks like, not even me.

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:15.220
So that's my plans, it's a lot of DDR publicity and I guess some freestyle on a personal note.

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:18.100
Well I know we've been taking up a lot of your time here but I do have one other question

01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:21.780
I want to ask you because it has to do with something that the caller last week had brought

01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:26.980
up about hearing something about, and I don't know if you can confirm or deny this, but

01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:33.140
he had said something about DDR maybe going out on tour with a rap artist.

01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:34.060
this uh...

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:36.180
you know the crowd what it was

01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:39.440
well actually before we go to that i'll tell you one thing that's uh... on

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.820
thursday's bike to you the came up to us

01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:45.380
said it would be over she brought to the world

01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:48.340
yeah because you have a few records of that's what we call the rules

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.300
well obviously

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.620
and they're going to help because we have this

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:53.500
video game

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:59.140
uh...

01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:00.260
award show

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:01.060
that happened

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:02.060
California.

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.060
That's right.

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:04.060
Right.

01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:07.180
We talked about this on one of our other shows, the Spike Lee's first annual show.

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:08.180
Yeah.

01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.180
Right.

01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:10.180
They want the DVR machine at the after party.

01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:11.180
Oh, okay.

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.180
Yeah.

01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:16.100
So, but the problem is it's kind of out of the range and, you know, because obviously

01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:20.820
that's the West Coast and the East Coast, and it's a very long haul for that DVR machine.

01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:21.820
Right.

01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:25.940
You know, on Sammy's own, because Sammy only has like a coverage range, and then outside

01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:32.340
coverage ranges a lot of uh a lot of um you know money involved to try to get it out of that

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:38.660
absolutely but on to the rap artist so basically what happened was we were in the middle of the

01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:45.460
tournament saturday ludicrous and the family label uh were there and someone noticed it

01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:48.580
like obviously because it was actually probably on the other side of the screen

01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:52.660
that like ludicrous is probably on the other side of the curtain from where we were

01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:58.100
And I actually ended up seeing him, but someone, a representative from their production label,

01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:01.060
came up specifically to me, because I looked like I knew what I was doing.

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:09.140
And they're like, and they asked me, is this, you know, for rent, or is there even a possibility

01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:16.180
of taking a machine on tour? And, you know, I was like, wow, you know, you want to have this

01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:21.540
thing on tour? That's pretty cool. You know, you can talk to Sammy, you know, so the person from

01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:29.540
Ludacris production label is asking for the DDR Machine to be on tour with them sometime next spring or summer.

01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:37.540
Interesting. Now what I'd be curious about though, is it on tour, because you know how sometimes the big celebrities with their rock and roll lifestyle, or in this case rap lifestyle,

01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:45.540
they've got all the stuff that they have in their trailer and stuff. Is this DDR Machine for him to be using in his posse, or is it something he wants to have out there?

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:51.540
I have no idea what he wants to do with it. It's just the fact, you know, it's just kind of funny that he wants it, you know.

01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:58.540
That's the thing that, like, you know, jumps on it. I mean, Sammy has that contact information. I don't know what they're doing with that.

01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:04.540
Yeah, because when I think about famous pairs, I don't really envision Ludacris and DDR, but whatever floats your boat.

01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:08.540
You know what? You're going to see a lot of stupid stuff soon, I'm going to tell you right now.

01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:11.980
is gonna be people in the sporting industry playing DDR

01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:15.300
I'm positive it's just gonna happen once it gets big

01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.500
good we need more stuff to make fun of here on our little program so

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:22.260
bring on all the silly stuff. Oh yeah there will be plenty of silly stuff coming

01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:26.460
I'm sure of it. But like I said

01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:29.620
people will know once the show

01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:33.420
if it actually ends up happening with the weekly show people will know we'll both be on

01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:35.900
DDR Freak and be Mani styled because I obviously am

01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:42.180
both affiliated with both sites, so you will find out through both of those sites that

01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:48.340
something will be going down at any point in time, whether it be the 2005 huge tournament

01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:54.860
or the DDR show or Ludacris getting the machine for a tour or whatever, you're going to find

01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:59.700
out one way or another through those sites.

01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:03.580
And as we have in the past, we will go ahead and steal the news and post it on our own

01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:06.540
site and post a link back to the site. We stole it from them.

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:10.980
Of course. They can always check Orangelaunch.com too. Orangelaunchradio.com because we always

01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:15.940
put that information up as well. But definitely a lot of very interesting stuff it sounds

01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:21.660
like you've got coming up in the future. Yeah, I'll expect something good is going to happen

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:30.660
next year. You know, and there's even talk, I don't even know if I want to say this, people

01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:37.660
probably come out of the seats. Because of the media that we've received and this call

01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:44.160
from Hinabi that we also got, this big uproar that actually happened in only a week or so,

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.540
we have the possibility of requesting a new arcade mix.

01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:51.660
I'm jumping out of my seat!

01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.660
Yeah, right.

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:53.660
No, we're okay.

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:57.780
The people are now like, the people are down there like, wait a minute, wait, what did

01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:59.100
he just say? New arcade mix?

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:00.100
Honestly?

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:10.420
Here's the thing, it's not definite, it's not something that's like, wow, okay, we're

01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:17.220
really doing this, it's a possibility because America's now finding out about DDR and it's

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:25.980
a real big thing now that after this convention that happened, the public's like, wow, DDR?

01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:29.780
Oh wow, this is an amazing game, oh wow, let's put this thing on TV, and then we're gonna

01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:35.060
to push it, push it, push it. And they're going to be bootleg illegal mixes. Yeah, right?

01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:39.220
Well, you know, like, because Konami is going to notice this, obviously, because they called

01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:44.900
us, they're going to, you know, we hope they're going to help us out and show us, here, look,

01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:50.700
we got a new arcade mix for you, you know, how does that sound? Interesting. So, no,

01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:54.900
like, that's a side goal. Loki is convinced it's not going to happen. What's that? Loki

01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:59.420
is convinced over here it's not gonna happen well you know what prove them

01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:03.780
wrong what some of us whether you know that were like gave up on thinking that

01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:06.820
another one was gonna come out and some of us are like you know what you know I

01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:09.820
hope there's something else that comes out and then there's obviously people

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:15.420
out there oh they're like still steadfast and know like I know stream 2

01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:20.660
is coming I know it's coming you know so we're we're me and Sammy because of the

01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:25.400
levels of the game want you know to push for the new arcade mix to come out

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.740
because you know like the USA stuff is kind of like you know like sleepy and

01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:35.380
put together badly and well you know Spell of Marvelous is with two L's and

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:39.540
you know things like that so like we want to see a new arcade mix put

01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:44.860
together and even you know if it ends up being like a home version you know like

01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:51.860
6-6 was. You know, still something else that's not in the group.

01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:59.860
Definitely. Here's my advice to you though. If Konami is going to do it, make sure Hawaii

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.860
is involved. Because if the...

01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:02.360
Hawaii?

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.860
If Konami Hawaii, the folks did Ultramix 2.

01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:05.860
Oh my god no.

01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:08.860
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me, you're not a fan of Ultramix 2?

01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:13.860
Let me tell you right now. When Ultramix 1 came out, I thought it was

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:15.220
all four of us

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:18.180
i thought what i could buy to go ahead and

01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:19.220
put together

01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:20.900
uh... you know

01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:24.240
a mix from hawaii that ended up the people

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:27.420
like looking at like what he said he go with the things speed up to two hundred

01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:28.340
eighteen

01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:30.580
bpm property and no reason

01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:32.780
and how i'll give you know

01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:36.560
you have all these songs in here

01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:39.440
quickening is a six-foot how do you do that

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:42.340
how do you put steps quickly at the six-foot

01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:45.420
I'll give you that. I'll give you that. You've got a good point.

01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:46.700
Here's the other...

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.200
How do you do that? So with Ultra-Mix 2 coming out,

01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.940
you know, and what was it?

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:53.980
What's on there? Is Maximizer on there?

01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:56.500
Is that what's on there? No, that's on DDR Extreme.

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:59.040
So I was going to say, here's the other half of that.

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:02.940
Okay, now if KOJ does it, then you're going to have Marvelous with two Ls, and you're going to have

01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:04.600
Karaoke Revolution crossovers.

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:07.500
So it's kind of like, damn it if you do damn things now.

01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:10.880
It's just that they need to be aware of what,

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:13.260
you know the people who want to gain

01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:16.660
you know i understand that the trying to get a little

01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:19.380
uh... group of people who play care of

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:23.060
you know if they do and you know that that the lawyers like that or

01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:25.780
you know the try to get it all up a different people

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:28.780
putting u s or there like move your feet

01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:32.960
uh... you know uh... i think about is uh...

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.520
you know if i get you know

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.920
uefense uefexes budget

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:44.520
It's not up to that, it's up to, you know, good songs like in the arcade extreme and

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:52.400
good step charts and things like that that, you know, push for people to play that are

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:55.800
real hardcore players and people that aren't even hardcore players that are even actually

01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:56.800
into playing.

01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:01.240
I mean, the regular public doesn't understand that this mix, you know, has faults to it.

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.240
Right.

01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.240
That's very true.

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:05.240
They just play the game, they see arrows and, you know, obviously once they get into it

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:09.400
they'll realize but you know and that's all they want to really go for if they

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.600
actually end up putting getting the shit together you know then this is actually

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:17.040
in the you know could be ending up being good you know and if we have some kind

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:20.320
of affiliation with Konami you know I mean if I have an affiliation with

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:25.480
Konami at any point in time where I could say what we should put on a mix

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:31.280
mm-hmm I promise you you will not be disappointed very good but you know I

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:32.080

home versions along with

01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:39.980
some stupid sub-charge that looks like it's about

01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:41.020

i would love to have a look like it

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.100
i could totally go on for hours and hours about how much i did but i would

01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:00.160
love to have you back on the show sometime we can we can dish on in the

01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.060
group

01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:04.060
because i actually i was on the east coast not that long ago and i got to go

01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:05.020
to it on the break

01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.560
and i have to check it out

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.660
and i'd like to sum it up in one word

01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:10.040
interesting

01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.740
interesting that's good that's good

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.440
interesting is definitely a good word for it

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.000
but uh... yeah

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.760
to tell you the truth

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:21.020
i know i'm not in all these big forms and everything

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.180
but if you see me on

01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:27.720
itgfreak.com you'll see me flaming everyone

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.080
all i do is play by actually i think it is registered to point group

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.620
neti now you're just adding back into the studio drama the drama thing you're

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:36.580
talking about earlier across the whole of it

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:39.560
you know that's all i do because you know what

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:40.760
they really didn't care

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.640
i'd like

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:42.800
i'd like to know more

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:44.280
out they didn't care or

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:47.940
or the people out there that they're like all i can make arrows and

01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:52.040
you know put out the song and no one cares what they look like it

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:57.120
you know it's it's really frustrating to look at that and have this be put out to

01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.020
you know, arcades and have people play it, you know, or at least attempt to play it.

01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:06.660
I mean, once it first came out, it just, it didn't have a lot of, it had a lot of like,

01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:10.620
wow, another, you know, dancing game, but now no one's playing it anymore over here

01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.620
at least.

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:12.620
Interesting.

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.660
Well, we'll get more of your thoughts on In the Groove a little later.

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:17.000
We've taken up like over a half hour of your time.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.320
Thank you very much for being on the show tonight.

01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:21.320

01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:24.100

01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:27.120
You're welcome back on the show any time to give us an update on what's going on.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.120
And best of luck to you, man.

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:29.120
Sounds exciting.

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.120
All right, baby.

01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:31.120
All right.

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.120
Talk to you.

01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:33.120
Have a good one.

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:34.120
Later.

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:35.120
Bye.

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.120
Bye.

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:37.120
Wow.

01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.120
Lots of interesting stuff in that interview.

01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:39.120
Mm-hmm.

01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:40.120
Lots and lots of interesting stuff.

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:43.160
I didn't realize what the hell they're cooking up over there on the East Coast.

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:45.640
Don't we feel out of the loop now over here on the West?

01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:47.160
That's very interesting.

01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.160
So what...

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.800
Guy, how can we sum up that whole thing for people that joined us halfway through that

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:51.800
interview there?

01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:57.680
talking about the past half hour there, but DDR going on tour with Ludacris next spring,

01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:02.760
we don't know to what extent, what did he say, he's talking to Fuse TV about some type

01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:10.600
of DDR show that right now could, could not be pitched with a WWE-ish element, or actually

01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:13.120
I wasn't using the analogy, what did he say, the karate show.

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:14.440
The ultimate fighting championship?

01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:18.720
Yeah, the fighting championship, but he was saying maybe like a BattleBots type of thing,

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:22.120
it's like a tournament very interesting to see what happens with that lots of

01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:26.800
producer contacts apparently at that DDR could be showing up a lot in the media

01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:31.920
in the next few months and it won't be about weight loss and that's great and

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.120
the more exposure the DDR gets in the media the more material we have to make

01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.680
fun of here on this show so we're definitely looking forward to it and

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:42.080
then of course at the end there he's talking about if this gets big enough

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:46.580
don't wet your pants but maybe a new arcade mix but that's way way off in the

01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:50.660
business don't get excited just yet but honestly dreaming about new arcade mixes

01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:54.220
is sometimes what keeps shows like this going because if we knew the game was

01:56:54.220 --> 01:57:05.980
dead would we be here right now it's already feel like it to that point you

01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:13.580
know that show sounds like it needs like wacky very informative commentators on

01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:20.580
Some people with, like, radio experience and some DDR experience and just, you know,

01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:23.580
someone that's been in the community for a while.

01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:27.580
Hmm, who could that be?

01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:31.580
We're trying to whore yourself out to everybody, Loki. Seriously.

01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:33.580
All right, damn, you know what, I need a break.

01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:37.580
Thanks to frequency for spending, that was like, looking at the little timer going on,

01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:39.580
that was over 30 minutes of chat.

01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:41.580

01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:44.500

02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:30.660
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:34.120
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:36.560
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:44.440
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We gotta get Mel back on the show at some point.

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:47.360
You know, he was gonna be here a couple weeks ago, but something came up, so...

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:49.160
We gotta get him back on the show.

02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:51.760
We gotta get all our favorites back on the show.

02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:56.840
We'll have our people go get him. Yeah, we'll have our people talk to their people, et cetera, et cetera.

02:06:56.840 --> 02:07:00.000
So there's some other news going out there in the music and rhythm game world.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.360
We've just spent the past half hour edition on DDR, but there are other games going on out there.

02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:07.900
one thing i wanted to talk about tyco drum master actually we've kind of

02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:09.760
mentioned this couple

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:11.460
couple times in the past few weeks

02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:14.960
tyco drum masters gonna have its release on tuesday we're hearing angel you've

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:18.840

02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:22.120
yep i'm in i'm gonna try to get up

02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:26.160
uh... one of the sites they usually frequent to buy games says that

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:28.760
the list of prices sixty nine ninety nine

02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:30.560

02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.000
uh...

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.820
however it doesn't state that uh... there's going to be a controller

i hope so yeah

02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:46.980
it should be one

02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:48.980
obviously so um...

02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:52.020
forty nine ninety nine is the most i've ever heard them charging for video game

02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:55.580
and that's for top shelf games like grand theft auto san andreas things like

02:07:55.580 --> 02:07:56.620
that

02:07:56.620 --> 02:08:00.060
and write but rob you remember how much i played for uh...

02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:02.820
uh... somebody let me go back in the day

02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:06.060
paid eighty bucks for the U.S. controller and

02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:07.980
what was the game fifty bucks

02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.660
for the game

02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:10.660
back in the day

02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:14.140
I think the only game I've seen more expensive to import was Para Para back

02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:15.440
when it was at its height

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:19.500
when it was at its peak. Now it's pretty... My DDR2 mix on Dreamcast when Dan bought it for me

02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:20.980
the game was uh...

02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:22.480
seventy five bucks

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:26.380
and he spent eighty bucks on my dance pad

02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:27.500
DAMN!

02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:29.540
and I

02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:33.760
sort of uh... acquired somebody else's dance pad

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:35.940
uh... now if Namco's smart

02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:37.340
they've got one

02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:40.940
they've got one song in taiko drum master they can be riding the wave of

02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:46.940
success off of one of their other games right now

02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:50.400
Katamari Damacy, the Katamari on the rocks theme

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:52.700
is in taiko drum master so who knows

02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:55.720
see now that little green guy, I bet you anything that little green guy is going to become a

02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:56.900
little uh...

02:08:56.900 --> 02:08:59.340
spokesman for Namco

02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:01.700
No, they're almost going to have Pac-Man.

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:04.620
Well, yeah, of course. They've got their staple. The Namco's a pretty good company.

02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:06.180
The little OG.

02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:10.960
They're allowed to have more than one mascot, just like Nintendo's got Mario and

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:12.240
Link,

02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:14.900
Luigi, and who the hell else they have? They've got a ton of people.

02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:18.320
Not Mario, Wario!

02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:23.060
You finally got a chance to get your own copy of Katamari Damacy this week, right?

02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:28.060
Yeah. Yeah. So, were you playing it at all, or you said you were watching?

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:33.060
I was playing it some, I played like at 3am, I was like, okay these mushrooms are tripping me out, I'm going to bed.

02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:08.620
I don't know. Nope. I'm sorry, but, you know, it is human nature to love smashing things

02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:14.940
with a ball. Rolling over stuff has been with us ever since the automobile. Since the automobile

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:20.180
can smash objects, like small squirrels and stuff, it's been our desire to find those

02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:24.700
small objects to roll over. And the fact that the ball is sticky and holds more objects

02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:32.380
to make an even larger ball that's even better that was beautiful I think I like

02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:41.740
running over buildings and picking up cows and the stupid dog that keeps

02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:46.460
trying to run into you okay I was in this one part where this dog kept like

02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:53.760
trying to butt into me so I ran over the dog later on and that was gratifying now

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:57.120
Now see in our chat room, here we go, we have one that says, I'm sick of it already.

02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:59.240
This is like Super Monkey Ball!

02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:00.240
Come on!

02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:01.600
Now see, Super Monkey Ball I never got into.

02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.160
Monkey Ball is cool.

02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:05.560
It's cute and all, but I never got into it.

02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:07.120
It's like the Parappa for this generation.

02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.960
Generation, what am I saying?

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:09.960
This year, you know?

02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:15.120
Because you know how Parappa hit and then kind of flew over, we're going to have like,

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.840
you know, Katamari Damacy 2 is coming out, and then there's going to be like, I think

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:18.840
a theme.

02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:24.600
There should be like, like Katamari Party.

02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:27.280
Mario Party, just with the little prince.

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:33.640
Uh, I was gonna say that, uh, the game's got its little cult following now, so it's kinda funny, but, um,

02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:39.400
I was gonna mention that VGCatch jumped on, jumped on it as soon as it got, you know, the game got released.

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:47.360
Uh, for those of you that don't know what VGCatch is, it took them quite a while, actually, to get on it.

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:53.360
Anyway, I was gonna say, VGCatch is a, like, online comic for video games and stuff. Anyway, yeah.

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:59.360
Interesting. Alright, uh, okay, let's get back on topic to talking about rhythm and music games here.

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:02.360
Loki had some things he wanted to talk about with you guys, some news that's going on.

02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:08.360
Now you, I guess there's some remix contests going on that just finished up. What happened with remixing?

02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:18.360
Both DDR, it's like DDR Remix, which is just DDR Maniac's contest, which didn't have quite a turn out as.

02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:22.360
But my sales remix contest 1.5 or whatever that was.

02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:26.360
But anyways, there was some pretty cool stuff that came out of those.

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:34.360
First I'll talk about the DDR Maniacs 1, the remix competition, because it's actually not done.

02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:46.360
They're not done. They're in voting right now, but they have the songs that were out there, so I'm going to play a few of these here. Actually, let me adjust my volume here.

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:56.360
There was actually only four people that entered this, which is kind of a little sad, a little, a little sad.

02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:05.360
There was two by, you know, you might recognize DJ Potato. I'm trying to find these here. What do I have?

02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:14.360
Didn't we have DJ Potato on the show a while back? Oh no, I know what it was. His interview with Thomas Howard. Didn't we air some of that a while back?

02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:19.940
a while back. Yeah, okay, yeah, sure we know who Digipotato is. Okay, so we had, we had

02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:25.320
some of those. I'm trying to think, let me look this up real quick. There was only five

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:32.040
entries. Two of them were his. They were actually, and I can play them for you guys, it was actually

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:37.400
some work that he did, sort of, kind of, with the Bemani Rock album, but not, it's just

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:47.120
piano and saxophone sort of remixes of, what the hell? What the hell was that? Yeah, give

02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:54.040
us a little clip of one of these songs here. Okay, well let's see here. We'll start off

02:13:54.040 --> 02:14:02.680
with, let's see how these are old. Oh, I know, I know. Okay, we're going to start off with

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:10.440
they had one of kind lady he actually a few of these he has like d2r 1998 kind

02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:15.560
lady there was another one too I can't remember what it was off hand but um

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:26.720
anyways let's see here okay this one right here is gonna be they're like DJ

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:36.100
a potato, a piano, a concentrato. Or is that? What? Shut up. Okay. I don't need your fancy

02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:43.240
English, English talk, okay? Shut up. It's Italian. Whatever. European. We do not formally

02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.340
recognize the European nations, okay? I just want you to know that. They do not exist to

02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:53.340
me. And you're psychotic with your English. Can I show you, I believe I think it's Italy

02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:58.020
right now is number three in our list of nations who's listening to this program when I was

02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:04.020
last looking at the geo-rankings. Watch your dirty little mouth, Loki. Whatever. Anyways,

02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:09.300
I was reading that quick, okay? I'm under pressure here. Anyway, this is DJ Potato featuring

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:16.300
Tony Miller, which I believe he's on sax.

02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:47.300
I like it. Keep in mind, I played saxophone for like twelve years.

02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:52.300
You're listening to KOLR Smooth Jazz.

02:15:52.300 --> 02:16:19.300
So that was that. Anyways, so, um, anyways, yeah, that was a few of the, that was one of the songs that was in there. There were some other remixes, but not a lot. Um, however, the Bomani style remix competition was a little different. There was quite a bit there. Um, I saved some of these really kickass ones on here, cause there was a few that were like, and even the judges said, what the hell is this? But, you know, there's always gonna be something like that.

02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:36.300
So, um, some of the ones I like to point out which were pretty cool, um, let's see here, um, some of them you've heard before on this show, uh, Clunk Clunk 2004, now that was, um, D.M. Ashura, and that was pretty sweet.

02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:56.300
Anyways, that one. And then we've got my personal favorite, Dazed and Destroyed. I loved this one before when there was only a clip of the song, but that's the whole thing.

02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:04.300
The second half is kinda, eh, it's okay, but I mean, it's pretty well done for, it's a remake of Hysteria, so pretty sweet.

02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:32.020
It's a really cool song, trust me on that.

02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:35.020
and he's making Bitter Beer Face.

02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:42.020
It's different. It's different, and it's well produced.

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:47.020
Well produced, maybe, but it sure isn't even a challenge. I'm worried.

02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:27.820
They sort of had an R&B version of Rainbow Flyer.

02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:37.820
Rainbow Flyer, the polychromatic allogum mix, let's see here, we've also got, but the winner,

02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:44.820
The winner of it all was Sextantbike with V1.

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:06.420
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same contest you were complaining about

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:11.960
out because they wouldn't allow fusion mixes and what won the damn contest now

02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:15.760
this was it's a little different now it's just they didn't want people just

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:21.660
using acid to throw two songs on top of each other however there were some songs

02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:26.400
in there that were two songs thrown on top of each other how that got in is

02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:30.780
beyond me because I specifically remembered in the rules that that's why

02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:36.280
I didn't enter. But whatever. I don't care. Contest is over. It's a little late.

02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:44.280
But anyways, so yeah, that was that. Um, you can find all these songs under the, um, music production forum on Bamai Style.

02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:49.280
There's a whole list of songs you can listen to, good and bad, and they're all on there. Pretty cool.

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:53.780
Um, one of the other songs that came out this week also was a remix of Vandy Angel by D'Amatura,

02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:56.780
because he can do no wrong, it seems like, with these.

02:19:56.780 --> 02:19:59.780
So anyways, I thought I'd play a little bit of that, because that's pretty sweet also.

02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:14.780
But, yeah, it's just, you know, a cool, like, long, trans universe, and it's just a trans song, so.

02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:20.780
But anyways, that was out. You can also find that in the Music Production Forum.

02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:25.780
Or you could listen to Monday Nights Diversion, the Orange Songs Radio Remake Show,

02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:32.780
because we'll definitely be adding some of these songs into our rotation there on Monday Nights from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:38.780
Now, and the other thing I wanted to mention, and we mentioned this way back in the show a while ago,

02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:44.780
about, what was it, it was DJ Potato's Bomani Rock album that was going to be coming out.

02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:50.900
me coming out. I have a few full tracks, actually, from that. So, there's a few I'd like to just

02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:57.300
preview real quick, and we'll also be throwing those in to rotation as well. Max 300.

02:20:57.300 --> 02:21:24.780
Alright, alright, alright, it's well done, don't get me wrong, but no more max.

02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:29.340
I need it! No more!

02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:32.340
The damn song keeps breeding, it's worse than Tribbles.

02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:39.340
This one is the one I like, Fear Train.

02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:58.960
This one is a little harder to find, I believe this was in the 2DX form, there's like a sample

02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:03.660
thing from the Bomani Rock album, you can find that also on Bomani style.

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:07.280
And that's pretty much all that's like music news.

02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:16.280
Now, there's a little other thing I read because we're talking about, you know, new arcade mixes and the set mania machine and in the groove and all that kind of stuff that kind of coincides with this.

02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:29.280
Now, for those who frequent the DDRUK.com site, you'll know that they created a set mania machine called DDX or Dance Dance X or whatever it is.

02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:40.640
Um, it's basically a StepMania arcade, um, game that they scanned. It looks really nice, and it was being played in a Namco, um, I think it was like a Namco cyberstation somewhere in England.

02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:44.280
And anyways, um, that's getting pulled out of there.

02:22:44.280 --> 02:23:12.760
Um, because- not because of like, you know, licensing issues and stuff, but it felt the same fate that the, um, Golf Land machine was, and that is, it's not being fixed by them, and it's just falling apart, and damaged, and so, it's- no, just, everyone out there know that problems with little kids trashing shit, it's worldwide. So, you know, there are bad parents everywhere.

02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:22.680
Oh, and you told me that it happened during break. I was hoping it was going to be a legal issue story, so we could have a little fun with that, but you're just saying some fucking punks ruined the machine.

02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:23.980
That's it.

02:23:23.980 --> 02:23:25.440
That is it. Sorry.

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:31.280
How boring! I wanted somebody to get sued! That would have been exciting.

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.980
So no plans to bring it back?

02:23:32.980 --> 02:23:35.380
They're just going to let it rot?

02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:43.580
Unfortunately, because what it was is, it was some guy's machine that he actually had brought there and let him, you know, use it and they would pay him some money.

02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:48.680
Well, they didn't pay him any money, and they trashed the machine, so he's getting pissed.

02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:56.080
But anyways, we will get a lawsuit story out of this after all! Hooray!

02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:02.180
Anyways, the other thing I wanted to talk about was, there was a bootleg that came out a few weeks ago, Dance Dance King.

02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:12.780
It looked like a really crappy bootleg machine from China that featured gold colored pads and stuff,

02:24:12.780 --> 02:24:19.520
and had, um, what else? Oh, and it's basically a second, er, second mix, um, consumer style

02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:27.400
machine that was running from, um, a PlayStation. Literally, a PS1 was inside this cabinet.

02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:32.840
And that was quite interesting. I happened to contact these people. They want to, now,

02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:40.720
it wasn't their idea, they say, to, you know, bring this, um, you know, bootleg over here,

02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:45.240
But the guy wants to make a legitimate mix that was kind of interesting. I thought

02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:48.920
Good luck

02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:52.880
So yeah, that's all the

02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:55.960
Miscellaneous baumannii stuff has been going on this week

02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:01.680
Next week. I have no idea. What's gonna be going on because I'll be playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:05.600
So Lester's baumannii in San Andreas

02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:08.600
I have no idea what's going on.

02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:10.600
Fair enough, because we're not having a show next Sunday, remember?

02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:13.600
It's Halloween, and we're giving all the people a night off so you can go trick-or-treating.

02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:16.600
We will have a marathon of old Orange Honest Radio episodes, though.

02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:20.600
A very scary Orange Honest Radio marathon for you guys next Sunday.

02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:21.600
I don't know how long that's going to run.

02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:25.600
Stay tuned to the website for details and when your show's there.

02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:28.600
You know, Nelly almost got me the bi-karaoke revolution, too.

02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:30.600
Then my wits came about me and I said,

02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:38.880
me I said fuck no I am NOT playing that game fair enough actually I want to ask

02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:42.040
you about this right chance at me a private message is she linked me to this

02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.600
thread over on freak that's showing this I don't know if you've seen this but it

02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:52.720
is a step mania computer put inside an 80s era ghetto blaster and they've got

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:57.460
the step mania logo painted over the speakers and this is actually computer

02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:00.360
it looks like a boombox in the front but look at the side that's a little

02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:03.360
You see this, Jamie? Look at that. Old school.

02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:06.360
That makes me think of the Nintendo computer.

02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:09.360
You remember when they were building a Nintendo out of laptop parts?

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:12.360
I'm sorry, building a computer out of a Nintendo shell and laptop parts.

02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:15.360
Yeah, it's the nice case mod.

02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:18.360
I thought of doing one like that, but putting it in Dreamcast.

02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:23.360
I still want one built out of a tool kit. A tool watch.

02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:25.360
Is that kind of thing hard to do?

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:31.180
do? When it comes to technical stuff, I don't know shit. I know how to put a radio station

02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:35.680
on the internet, but that's about it. So, Loki, tell me about, is this hard to do?

02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:41.140
Not if you have a Dremel tool. It's pretty much, even since that boombox was so big that

02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:47.060
they probably wouldn't even need to get a micro-ITX board. The micro-ITX ones that they

02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:53.900
have now are really small. They're only, I think the specifications for that are 15,

02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:57.660
I want to say, I think it's 17 centimeters by 17 centimeters.

02:26:57.660 --> 02:27:03.140
And looking at that, it looks like that is a micro ITX board in there.

02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:09.380
Yeah, so it's a micro ITX board, looks like a hard drive, power supply and everything.

02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:15.820
Looks like they've got the, it looks like they had a P4 version that was in there.

02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:17.880
I don't really know if that's the thing.

02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:21.960
They might have just added a fan to that just so it's cooled off a little bit more.

02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:25.820
I don't know. It's hard to tell by the picture. It looks like it could be a regular-sized

02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:30.080
motherboard, but I'm thinking it's probably a micro-ITX.

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:33.100
I like how they have the hard drive on top. That's very interesting. The hard drive's

02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:35.900
like separate from everything else. It's kind of interesting. I don't know if that's just

02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:41.920
the way they open it up or what. But look at this. It says it also includes a sound-sensitive

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:49.940
blue LED rod that kind of goes with the beat. But those little things go a long way in ghetto

02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:56.420
fabulousness don't they don't you think it's awesome I still wanted to do I

02:27:56.420 --> 02:28:01.220
wanted to make like a mini portable console system for like you know step

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:06.580
mania emulation games and just like a not really like almost like a laptop but

02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:12.740
not huh I'm never gonna do that though because I start too many projects all

02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:15.620
right well we're gonna go to a break when we come back from this break we got

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:18.580
to do the F use of the week don't you know oh but shouldn't I announce the

02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:21.780
winner of the orange launch radio cage match before we get to that because that was about

02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:26.780
an hour ago that we had the cage match. Tonight's winner of the orange launch radio cage match

02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:36.500
is Ian Vandal with Reason. So there you have it. Just because Loki picks a funny one doesn't

02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:45.660
mean he wins it. So too bad. I'm glad I haven't won that in at least a while. So at least

02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:51.300
a month I know that much so cool well we'll be hearing that one again next

02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:56.740
week along with two other lovely new songs oh no not next week oh yeah by

02:28:56.740 --> 02:29:00.860
default it's gonna win for two weeks now so we'll be back in two weeks to try and

02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:04.900
to throw in Ian Vandal in the meantime we're gonna take a break for right now

02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:07.580
when we come back we're gonna do the F use of the week in this break well I

02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:11.420
figured we did some DDR some 2dx how about some popin music specifically I

02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:17.900
I dug through my Papa Music 9 folder for some songs, and we're gonna kick it off with Ryu

02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:24.980
and Noria with Shining. Enjoy. Huh? I thought there was an extra letter in there. My bad.

02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:27.980
Ryu, I'm white. Forgive me. We'll be back.

02:30:54.980 --> 02:30:56.980
That's not easy

02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:00.980
That's not easy

02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:02.980
That's not easy

02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:36.980
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

02:32:50.980 --> 02:32:58.940
Even if you don't believe in me, you're gonna find me in no other place

02:32:58.940 --> 02:33:04.980
Are you always in love?

02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:00.940
I

02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:40.220
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:44.140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:50.900
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:56.000
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and believe it or not we're coming into the home

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:03.000
stretch of the show, but no show would be complete without a little bit of angst.

02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:09.000
And that means it's time for the FUs of the week. Jamie, why do we have to do these FUs

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
of the week every single week?

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:18.000
because we're full of angst.

02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:31.680
First F.U. goes to my laundry

02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:37.320
for not being dry yet until damp.

02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:40.560
Another F.U. goes toward being exhausted, drained,

02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:50.280
worn out, you name it. F.U. to stress. Big F.U. to stress. F.U. to people in minivans

02:36:50.280 --> 02:37:04.560
who drive 30 in a 50 mile an hour zone. And just stupidity. And uh, distance, time, money.

02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:11.560
I don't really have anything specific.

02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:18.560
Alright, then we'll move on to Loki.

02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:20.560
Um...

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:26.680
First off, you know, it's, like, every week, you know, fucking the drivers, cause,

02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:37.680
God, they're so awful and fulsome. I just don't know what it is. They just don't pay attention to any of the stop signs, lights, road signs, nothing. They just... stupid.

02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:45.680
So, fuck you then. Um, fuck you to my car, because the engine light came on the other day, and I don't know why.

02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:54.680
Well, actually, I do know why, because it was out of coolant, but I fixed that, and I hope it doesn't break down, because, you know, I need good karma around my car.

02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:59.180
I don't want to have to, like, have it break. That would suck.

02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:07.180
Um, then on more personal notes, and, you know, I apologize to any of the people that are listening for my work,

02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:10.680
because I think there might be one or two. Maybe one.

02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:17.680
Anyways, um, what do you do, um, BPD for firing, uh, Nelly from The Mill Room?

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:23.680
It's really funny because I do know the reasons behind it, and it was really stupid why they did it.

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.720
and there's a lot of people there that have done a lot worse and are still there and it's just

02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:33.920
retarded so but whatever she's probably gonna end up getting something better in the long run so

02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:38.320
that's cool but there's just a lot of people i have lots of respect for from that and that sucks

02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:47.760
then finally uh just uh i'm sorry fuck you to the rain because uh

02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:51.360
wet outside and i can't work on my cabinet not that i would work on my cabinet anyways if it

02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:58.360
it wasn't raining. I'm just tired, that's it.

02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:04.920
Alright, I'm going back to my old F.U. song, because the new one,

02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:09.920
William Hung, just wasn't working out, so I'm going back to my old song.

02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:16.060
Why aren't we just talking about how we didn't really care for this song, Jamie?

02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:19.560
Why don't you pick another one?

02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:23.420
I'm feeling uncreative tonight because I just like the fact that it goes all things keep

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:31.040
getting better and you know it's the FUs of the week.

02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:36.320
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, no maybe later.

02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:38.600
I know you need to have the Veruca Salt song.

02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:39.600
Ooh I like Veruca Salt.

02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:41.600
I won't do that.

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:44.640
Maybe I'll have to do that, that would be cute.

02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:49.320
I'm never that angsty though and honestly to be honest this week is much different.

02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:53.520
I'm just, I'm gonna say F you to the fact that I've been really insanely busy this week

02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:56.720
and I haven't had time to do all the things that I want to do and F you to the fact that

02:39:56.720 --> 02:39:59.720
I haven't been able to hang out with certain people as much as I would like to be able

02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:04.360
to because of the fact that, you know, they're working and I'm working and I got the radio

02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:07.600
stuff and et cetera, et cetera, so that kind of sucks.

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:11.680
There needs to be more hours in the day and then people shouldn't have to work as much

02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:13.320
and then keep the same salary.

02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:18.480
I realize I'm living in La La Land but I really don't have anything realistic this week.

02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:22.960
actually been a pretty decent week it's really busy except F you to the people

02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:26.760
that went saw the grudge at 930 on Friday night in Roseville because you

02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:31.080
all were too damn loud and F you to that guy I had to yell at in the middle of the

02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:36.000
movie although that did make me feel really good I think getting the applause

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.440
like that when I told that guy to shut the hell up felt really really good

02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:45.720
there's just not a lot of rushes like that you get in the world so if you do

02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:51.320
that movie as well for making people scream. People were too damn loud with that movie

02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:54.720
and it was giving me a headache. Oh, F you to the fact, I know why, F you to the fact

02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:59.040
that the projectionist or something, the film was damaged or the projection was going on

02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:05.120
because for 20 goddamn minutes the movie was bouncing up and down like it was shaking.

02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:08.120
Like imagine if you were trying to watch something on a projection screen and it was shaking

02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:11.640
like an earthquake. I swear to God it was giving me a headache after like one minute

02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:15.720
having to watch it like that. And we go and complain. Loki actually went in and complained

02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:20.720
and what do they tell you? Uh, yeah, it's only gonna do that for 20 minutes. Uh, we

02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:27.040
got the defective reel from the studio, but hey, we're getting a new one that replaces

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:34.040
soon. Sorry. Uh-uh. No. Fuck you and your fucking bitch-ass whore-cunt for fucking making

02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:41.480
me pay 9.25 plus a $1.25 Fandango fee, because I don't like fucking lines at your movie theater.

02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:47.160
theater. Fuck you for making me pay that. I want a perfect god damn theater experience.

02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:51.920
You know what? You should ask for the manager. I know. I should write a letter and complain.

02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:57.600
Do it. I just might. You should ask for the manager's boss then. They all asked for just

02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:06.600
I didn't. I did. Who knew? I had this rage pent up in me and I forgot all about it. I

02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:11.440
pushed it to the back of my mind and you people brought it out of me. RAGE! I got a free ticket.

02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:18.080
it for complaining about them turning on the light at the end of the credits for the Matrix.

02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:22.440
I'll write a nasty letter. Because you know what, I can't, I think I had one other bad

02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:25.560
experience at theater and I can't remember what it was, but I bet if I went through the

02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:30.880
F.U. archives of the show I could find it. Mention the three magic words. Better Business

02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:37.800
Bureau. Or I'll mention these magic words. Fuck you whore for making me pay so much money

02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:40.920
for going to see a sub-par production.

02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:43.160
I want everything in pristine condition.

02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:45.240
You're gonna, it's highway robbery.

02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:47.400
No wonder people pirate your goddamn movies.

02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:50.280
Here's my thing, okay, it was playing

02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:53.000
on like six to eight screens in there.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.280
Take out the bad film, play it less.

02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:00.360
Oh my God, five screens, how will we survive?

02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:02.880
I mean, seriously, just play it less.

02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:05.240
Play another, I'm sure more people

02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:08.240
I wanted to see a shark's tail, so go ahead and play that instead.

02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:12.240
I mean, they could have easily taken this out of rotation, but instead they were like,

02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:14.240
Ah, fuck it, no one's gonna care.

02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:20.240
Alright.

02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:25.240
Let's move on and go to the other angsty folks in our studio right now.

02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:27.240
We'll start it off with DDR Angel.

02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:30.240
Nice attempt to burp, Ryan.

02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:32.240
Haha, it's okay.

02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:37.420
Um, just a few just being tired today. I don't even know what's up. Everybody seems tired today

02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:42.720
I don't know just there's no reason for it. I shouldn't be tired, but I am

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:47.560
Again if you did the flaky instructor that I've got

02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:52.600
But whatever he's still deciding the whole class every once in a while

02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:56.400
Maybe he'll get over it and realize. Oh wait. I haven't job

02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:02.400
Um, that's about it. I'm, like, not angsty. What the hell?

02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:09.400
You're not really ever that angsty, Angel. I've only seen you angsty here one time, and it took an act of God to make you angsty?

02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:14.400
Alright. Bradley, Arcadian42, what's on your mind?

02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:18.400
Of course, fuck you to, uh, FolsomPD and...

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:19.400
Surprise!

02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:26.400
Yes, fuck you to all that and all, fuck you to me for getting myself into that, in that

02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:32.680
situation and all the decisions and delays and everything that caused it and yeah, so

02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:39.680
forth. Uh, what else? Uh, fuck you to having to make up all that time, but at least my

02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:44.680
but at least my work is nice and they'll let me make up time

02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:49.680
fuck you to the honey back ribs or whatever

02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:54.680
the new thing at Applebee's for sucking

02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:59.680
not honey, it's like honey barbecue ribs

02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:04.680
actually it was a rib thing but it sucked

02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:08.680
It was a new rib thing, but it sucked.

02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:12.680
It was like, bleh.

02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:17.680
But at least it was free, because it was the free lunch day at work.

02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.680
So at least I didn't have to pay that money for it.

02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:26.680
And, uh, yeah.

02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:31.680
Actually, just R.O.D. for the TV.

02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:38.160
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, of which I haven't gotten very many tonight,

02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:41.920
surprisingly enough, so if they don't get in in the next 30 seconds or so, they're probably

02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:45.640
not getting read, but that's alright, we have a few.

02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:52.780
Ry Chan says, F you to friends borrowing things and not returning them. F you to people that

02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:57.880
drive in the fast lane and are going 15 miles an hour under the speed limit. F you to loners.

02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.880
F you to people that continue to try to use you for all your worth and can't take a hint when I say no.

02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:06.880
Oh, and F you to taking a frisbee to the lip.

02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:08.880
Ow. Ow.

02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:11.880
What, Loki?

02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:14.880
If you're not a dog, you can't catch it with your mouth.

02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:17.880
I don't think, something tells me she wasn't trying to do that.

02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:19.880
You know what, though? You know what's a lot safer?

02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:22.880
What were those things that are like, frisbees? Did they go for the, uh, robies?

02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:23.880
What were those things called?

02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:26.880
Yeah, it's like throwing a giant saw blade at your head.

02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:28.880
That's the best thing ever.

02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:30.880
The Nerf ones, the plastic ones.

02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:35.880
Yeah, the Nerf ones are the best ones because it just feels like you're throwing like a fish at you or something like that.

02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:39.880
But yeah, the Robies are fucking dangerous because they go faster and they're like more streamlined.

02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:43.880
Like seriously, it's like a saw blade getting thrown at you.

02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:46.880
But they're awesome, you can throw them on the park.

02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:48.880
Alright.

02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.880
Didn't they have a Robies that were shaped in like strange shapes too, like diamonds and stuff?

02:46:53.880 --> 02:47:09.880
I only heard half of tonight's show. Unacceptable. Fired. That's fine. He does good news for

02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:17.500
the website. Jazz says F you to the fact that the projection people didn't turn off the

02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:21.640
lights for like 15 minutes into the movie and the fact that the grudge was more funny

02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:29.320
even scary and the rest of my audience agreed. I thought the grudge was scary, I don't know

02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:34.880
if the grudge was really scary. But that's it, he reminded me of the other thing. When

02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:39.800
I went and saw, I think it was, I want to say it was Kill Bill 2 over there, they didn't

02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:44.000
turn off the goddamn lights. That's what it was, it was Kill Bill 2. Yeah, when I went

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:47.560
and saw Kill Bill 2, they didn't turn off the goddamn lights for like 15 minutes. And

02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:51.280
you would think such a little thing would not be so annoying, but it was really, really

02:47:51.280 --> 02:48:00.560
annoying. Thank you Jazz for reigniting that angst within me. Lastly, Poto says F you to

02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:08.640
writing a paper on two hours of sleep. Aww. Aww. I remember being such a procrastinator

02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:11.640
like that, still am. I remember staying up all night. I'm doing my paper during my lunch

02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:17.960
break tomorrow, and it's due tomorrow night. Amen to that. Alright. I'm not going to class

02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:28.400
I guess what we should do, let's open up the skype line because for god's sake we haven't

02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:32.680
had it open the whole show except for that long chat we had with frequency, basically

02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:37.280
frequency took all your skype time tonight ladies and gentlemen, no I'm kidding, we'll

02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:42.240
open it up a little bit for the folks to talk to us on skype, so skype's open, if you want

02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:47.120
more information on skype head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact

02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:50.720
with us. We definitely would like your feedback to anything we've talked about during tonight's

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:54.840
show, including lots of stuff that we had talked to Frequency about earlier, as well

02:48:54.840 --> 02:49:00.080
as, you know, other news, the Bomani remix contests, and machines breaking down, and

02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:03.480
kids in arcades, and projectionists that don't know how to tromp the goddamn light when the

02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:08.560
movie starts. Anyway, sorry. Getting a little bit off tangent there. Also, we will accept

02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:12.920
your Ask Orange Lounge questions over private messages chat if you guys have anything you

02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:16.120
want to ask us. We only have a couple minutes left, so we're not going to make an official

02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:18.620
segment but if you have some questions you'd like us to address go ahead and

02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:23.040
send those in I'd also like to add that everything Sam Raimi touches turns to

02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:29.280
gold and his car ends up in all of his movies damn it I didn't look for it in

02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:32.720
the garage but I don't know if that really counts because he just produced

02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:37.680
the movie this car might be in there I I'm being told right now in our chat

02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:45.080
room that right now our very show is being played inside a truck stop awesome

02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:50.080
So we'd like to give a big YEE-HAW to all our truckin' buddies down there.

02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:53.080
No, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding. Please don't beat me up.

02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:58.080
No, but I guess we have somebody listening on a network over at the truck stop right now.

02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:01.080
I want to go to the truck stop. They have good food.

02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:03.080
I want hash food. They have good food over at the truck stop.

02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:04.080
Oh my God, Bob. Let's go get food.

02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:07.080
Do they have riblets? I want riblets. I don't think they have riblets.

02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:12.080
But I need to be watching my weight because I have a performance to do on Saturday.

02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:14.780
Oh, come on, eat healthy food, get some fitness with it.

02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:17.580
I gotta work early tomorrow. If I didn't have to work early tomorrow, I would totally do it.

02:50:17.580 --> 02:50:19.580
I can, I have to work at 6.30.

02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:22.580
What? Sorry.

02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:27.580
Anyway, we're supposed to watch the language, because we're being broadcast to the truck stop right now, so...

02:50:27.580 --> 02:50:28.580
You know.

02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:30.580
Don't give in to me!

02:50:30.580 --> 02:50:34.580
Alright, I'll keep the mic away from Logie, if that's the case.

02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:42.020
Oh, I didn't even check the Skype thing to see if anybody called. Nope! Still wide open

02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:44.780
there. Well, I guess nobody wants to call us tonight. That's fine. That's fine. We'll

02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:48.540
just talk to ourselves. We'll amuse ourselves here. That's fine. Any big Halloween plans

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:53.300
for you, Loki? Just having a get-together over here. We're gonna watch Shaun of the

02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:58.900
Dead because I got my lovely promo copy of that, and that's gonna rock. Shaun of the

02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:03.820
Dead. I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try because the people are gonna have alcohol. I'm gonna

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:07.820
I tried to slip in one of my bad movies in there, but I don't think they're gonna go for it.

02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:11.820
No one wants to watch my bad movies, and that makes me sad.

02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:15.820
I spend good money on those, and goddamnit, if, you know,

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:19.820
no one wants to watch, uh, was it, uh, Blood Sisters of Lesbian Sin,

02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:23.820
you know, who will?

02:51:23.820 --> 02:51:27.820
I'll watch it. Just to see what the hell it is.

02:51:27.820 --> 02:51:31.820
I have a question. How many people are coming to this get-together?

02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:40.660
don't know. Where are they all going to fit? Uh, I don't know. Interesting, very- Sit on

02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:49.620
the floor, goddammit, because I'm taking language! Gosh darn it! Much better, much better. Alright.

02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:57.300
Uh, Bradley, you have any exciting Halloween plans? Nope. Sit on my ass at home, do nothing.

02:51:57.300 --> 02:51:59.300
Sounds like a plan to me.

02:51:59.300 --> 02:52:01.300
You know what I'm doing?

02:52:01.300 --> 02:52:03.300
That's a fabulous idea. Let's take out the airazooka.

02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:07.300
You can put candy in it and it launches the candy.

02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:11.300
I've got like three days of Halloween because we're doing the big thing at work.

02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:13.300
I have my catgirl costume.

02:52:13.300 --> 02:52:18.300
And then I'm having Rocky on Saturday.

02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:24.300
And probably Sunday I'm just going to sit around and watch Interview with the Vampire on laserdisc.

02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:26.300
There you go.

02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:31.220
Of course, if you're in the Sacramento area, you should definitely check out furtherindignities.org

02:52:31.220 --> 02:52:34.140
for the information on a Halloween tradition.

02:52:34.140 --> 02:52:38.020
Rocky Orpix show is going to be in UC Davis and several of your buddies from Warren's

02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:40.860
Knowledge Radio are involved with that because that was the thing we did before we played

02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:42.780
DDR and did this show.

02:52:42.780 --> 02:52:44.500
And it's still going on.

02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:48.100
So check that out if you're in the area.

02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:52.220
Also what else I want to say, oh, remember the follow up from last week.

02:52:52.220 --> 02:52:56.220
Remember we were talking about, in case you guys weren't listening last week, but we were

02:52:56.220 --> 02:53:02.140
We were talking about how we were going to do DDR on the big screen at some point.

02:53:02.140 --> 02:53:05.500
We were going to take that same movie screen and possibly have a Bimani night in the movie

02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:09.500
theater and possibly do a live taping of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:11.100
Outlook is very good on that.

02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:14.740
We're hoping to get some help from other friends of ours within the Bimani community to kind

02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:16.260
of make that a success.

02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:20.960
But just like the TV show thing that had come up earlier, we're having a hard time figuring

02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:24.340
out exactly what we're going to do besides a live episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:26.340
Let's set the ferret on fire!

02:53:28.340 --> 02:53:30.340
He said, let's set a virgin on fire.

02:53:31.340 --> 02:53:33.340
Let's set a virgin's pants on fire.

02:53:36.340 --> 02:53:38.340
Let's set the ferret on fire, that's what we need to do.

02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:41.340
My babies! Where's my babies?

02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:43.340
I don't even know where the ferrets are.

02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:44.340
Do you want to be my baby?

02:53:44.340 --> 02:53:46.340
No, I won't have to be your baby, you have to get out and get it.

02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:50.340
No, don't do it, don't be your slave.

02:53:50.340 --> 02:53:52.340
Don't be your slave!

02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:54.340
Let's let people go!

02:53:57.340 --> 02:54:03.340
Okay, that's one suggestion that's come up, is that Katamari Damacy gets played on the big screen.

02:54:03.340 --> 02:54:04.340
Okay.

02:54:04.340 --> 02:54:07.340
Somehow, we'll have to have some kind of little contest.

02:54:07.340 --> 02:54:10.340
Oh, they have two player mode. We could have a Katamari Damacy tournament or something.

02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:12.340
He can play as the cousins.

02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:15.340
There you go. I'm liking this so far. I'm liking it.

02:54:17.340 --> 02:54:18.340
Alright.

02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:22.180
They got choir people, they got the la da da da da da da da da da.

02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:23.020
That'd be cool.

02:54:23.020 --> 02:54:24.220
We'll get the UC Davis choir in on it.

02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:25.060
That'll be fun.

02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:30.480
All right, we're gonna take a real quick break.

02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:31.700
We're gonna do a one song break,

02:54:31.700 --> 02:54:34.700
then we're gonna come back and wrap up the show.

02:54:34.700 --> 02:54:36.860
Uh, what song should we do here in this break?

02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:38.500
Let's do...

02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:42.700
Well, we did pop and we didn't do a Guitar Freaks song.

02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:43.540
What?

02:54:44.860 --> 02:54:47.020
You know, Loki wants to play his remix again.

02:54:47.020 --> 02:54:47.980
Fine, fair enough.

02:54:47.980 --> 02:54:49.900
That makes for a good one, Songbreak.

02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:54.740
Tell us one more time about your remix that you didn't enter into any contest because you, I don't know,

02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:56.780
you don't enter contests or something.

02:54:56.780 --> 02:54:58.820
Well, this is just my newest one.

02:54:58.820 --> 02:55:02.960
The preview went off of the next album, which I was trying today

02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:09.800
to upload my new album, and fucking A, it will not work, okay? Language! Language!

02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:11.720
Yes, I am speaking English.

02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:13.860
Okay, anyways, um...

02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:17.500
So, Golly Gee Willikers, it would not, you know,

02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:21.500
upload to the server

02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:26.100
and so yeah I couldn't make it available for people download that made me sad

02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:29.900
and you said it sucks okay

02:55:29.900 --> 02:55:32.900
that's what I want to say but anyways this is a

02:55:32.900 --> 02:55:37.420
paranoid revolution be sure you put in the one that's just revolution

02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:40.620
mp3 because I changed it a few times

02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:45.020
cuz I just did not like the middle of it so I had to tweak it a little bit more

02:55:45.020 --> 02:56:05.020
But, um, CD Temploki. Okay, anyways, um, so yeah. Here it is. And it's glory and stuff. And it'll be available for download soon, I'm sure. Just have to get it to upload.

02:56:05.020 --> 02:56:15.020
Alrighty. Here we go. Paranoia Revolution. Enjoy. And we'll be back to wrap up the show after this.

02:57:35.020 --> 02:58:01.340
I bet that I'll spare the bus back I bet that I'll spare the bus back

02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:15.340
I bet that if you tear the bus back

02:58:15.340 --> 02:58:28.340
I bet that if you tear the bus back

02:58:58.340 --> 02:59:19.560
Now, it's Paranoia Revolution here on Orange Lounge Radio, remixed by our very own Noki.

02:59:19.560 --> 02:59:20.560
You know what I realized?

02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:27.400
The bass line in that kind of reminds me of Tsugaru, like it has the same rhythm.

02:59:27.400 --> 02:59:32.200
it towards the end actually has the part you know in paranoia is where it's all where it's all

02:59:35.240 --> 02:59:42.520
has that throughout the whole thing um yeah so it's like a was it uh 12th notes and then um

02:59:43.240 --> 02:59:48.120
like some fourth oh it's pretty cool it's just it's a little bit um tweaked off of that that's

02:59:48.120 --> 02:59:53.640
in the background i know for most of it obviously because i made it but um i don't know that's all

02:59:53.640 --> 02:59:56.280
It's done on the second thing right now

02:59:56.960 --> 03:00:03.080
But they'll be available download along with my nice cover art and whatnot you can put together your own see

03:00:03.080 --> 03:00:09.080
Like I did in the studio because like hell if I'm gonna make more and like, you know send them out to people

03:00:09.080 --> 03:00:11.080
I just don't do that

03:00:13.120 --> 03:00:15.120
Yeah

03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:20.160
Alright, well we got to wrap up the show here. So we got to go around and get everybody's final thought

03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:26.160
We'll start off with DDR Angel. DDR Angel, what is your final thought?

03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:35.160
Um, Katamari Damacy, because I can't stop playing.

03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:39.160
Final thought from Bradley. You go last, right?

03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:45.160
Arcadian 42?

03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:49.900
thoughts

03:00:49.900 --> 03:00:51.680
I have none at the moment

03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:54.840
they're gone, they're gone

03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:55.620
alright

03:00:55.620 --> 03:00:58.580
uh... Loki your final thought

03:00:58.580 --> 03:01:03.100
there's gonna be too many games I gotta buy this week, I got Neocontra and Grand Theft Auto

03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:04.240
San Andreas

03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:06.060
and

03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:07.100
actually maybe not

03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:09.620
I wasn't gonna get Tony Hawk's Underground 2, just be

03:01:09.620 --> 03:01:11.180
maybe I might get that

03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:13.860
but Need for Speed Underground 2, no

03:01:13.860 --> 03:01:15.520
DarkSakura, your final thought?

03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:21.520
I have games to play, like I have Katamari Damacy now, I have Sims 2.

03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:23.340
And you know what?

03:01:23.340 --> 03:01:26.240
Real life is taking up all my time.

03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:32.180
So, I've had to focus on school, everything, so...

03:01:32.180 --> 03:01:38.040
There is a world outside of video games, not much one, and it usually sucks, but there is one.

03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:40.840
Alright, and my final thought is, don't forget to listen to our other shows on

03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:55.640
Monday Night Diversion, and Wednesday Nights on OSRA outside the box with a special Grand

03:01:55.640 --> 03:02:00.920
Theft Auto San Andreas update.

03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:03.840
That's the show on the station where we talk about the other games, other than the stomp

03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:05.880
your feet and tap your fingers games.

03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:08.920
So we'll get to all that on Wednesday and Tuesday.

03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:12.960
Jamie, I'm sure we'll have another fun show and Monday remixes, Thursday Orange

03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:16.620
Honors Radio Rewind, another night of programming is coming Orange Honors Radio

03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:32.840
gonna have a long version program that's gonna be at lunchtime for an hour.

03:02:32.840 --> 03:02:42.440
real quick question here in the studio. Okay, never mind. Nothing to see here, move along.

03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:47.840
Oh, and, should mention, when you're, you know, not listening to Orange Knowledge Radio,

New South Park coming to Comedy Central. Hooray, hooray. Okay, the last word of this show,

03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:58.240
I'm going to give it to Loki. Loki, the last word of tonight's show. One word that sums

03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:08.920
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:13.280

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:32.120
Whenever my life gets me so down, I know I can go down,

03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:35.120
Down, down, where the fun never ends,

03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:40.120
As long as my music keeps playing, you know what I'm saying,

03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:46.120
I know that I can find a friend,

03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:48.120
That has a roundhouse.

03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:54.320
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:40.520
I thought that was a gospel song at first, and then I realized what it was. I didn't

03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:43.720
realize they sung the theme around us like that. I thought they actually had a little

03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:45.560
synthesized thing.

03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:48.000
No, because the show fucking rocked

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.760
and then they took it off air like they do everything that's good on Nickelodeon.

03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:55.620
They need to have Nick retro with the old

03:04:55.620 --> 03:04:59.400
shows like Salute Your Shorts, you know,

03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:00.900
fucking

03:05:00.900 --> 03:05:03.040
Hey Dude and all that stuff.

03:05:03.040 --> 03:05:06.680
They need to put that back on air because they've got like, you know, the stupid

03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:08.400
noggin crap with like

03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:12.000

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.520

it's like uh...

03:05:20.920 --> 03:05:25.640
fucking melrose place meets high school

03:05:25.640 --> 03:05:27.760

03:05:27.760 --> 03:05:33.800

03:05:35.720 --> 03:05:38.380
show is fabulous

03:05:38.380 --> 03:05:40.760
at first a reason it makes me think

03:05:40.760 --> 03:05:43.240
yet god yes you can sit on television why

03:05:43.240 --> 03:05:47.120

03:05:47.120 --> 03:05:48.220

03:05:48.220 --> 03:05:49.360
pinwheel

03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:51.900
today's special

03:05:51.900 --> 03:05:58.380
and we also

03:05:58.380 --> 03:06:02.120
you know this never get that the fact that

03:06:02.120 --> 03:06:05.080
I'll come back one.

03:06:05.080 --> 03:06:06.840
Exactly.

03:06:06.840 --> 03:06:10.280
Thank God for the internet, because I'm hoping more and more old-school you can't do that

03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:14.040
on television episodes start showing up, because I found a couple online once, or somebody

03:06:14.040 --> 03:06:15.040
gave me some.

03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:16.040
I don't remember what it was.

03:06:16.040 --> 03:06:17.040
Did you give me some?

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:18.040
Angel gave me some.

03:06:18.040 --> 03:06:19.040
Oh, so great.

03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:20.040
I need to get more.

03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:21.040
That show was so freaking fabulous.

03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:23.200
I get my Ouija board back this week.

03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:26.240
Dude, the dungeon scenes of you can't do that on television.

03:06:26.240 --> 03:06:27.240
That's all I gotta say.

03:06:27.240 --> 03:06:30.560
Or the arcades.

03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:38.460
all about barf that kind of rocks poor guy I think isn't he dead poor guy he

03:06:38.460 --> 03:06:44.000
was awesome so underappreciated and peewee you know fucking peewees play out

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:47.440
seems to come back I don't care if he's a fucking pervert and child molester you

03:06:47.440 --> 03:06:51.220
know what this is this is a conversation I was having my friend the other day

03:06:51.220 --> 03:06:54.400
we're talking about Michael Jackson okay yeah the guy's really fucked up yeah

03:06:54.400 --> 03:06:58.400
okay maybe he slept with some children yeah that does not make his music bad

03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:04.400
Just because someone's a child molester does not mean that they cannot make bad, or make good music.

03:07:04.400 --> 03:07:09.400
It's just like Pee Wee Herman. Okay, so he's into child pornography and all this stuff.

03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:15.400
Does not mean the show was bad. You, people are confusing the art with the person.

03:07:15.400 --> 03:07:20.400
I don't go around, you know, saying, you know, I don't like that music because that guy's an alcoholic.

03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:25.400
You know, I don't like that music because I don't like the sound of it. Not, I don't like the person.

03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:30.400
People need to separate the person from the music. That's what I think.

03:07:30.400 --> 03:07:38.400
Some comments from the chat room. Danger Mouse and Count Ducula.

03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:41.400
Yeah, Count Ducula.

03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:43.400
Duck Man needs to come back.

03:07:43.400 --> 03:07:45.400
Yeah, Duck Man, definitely.

03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:49.400
Alright. Yeah, enough memory lane stuff.

03:07:49.400 --> 03:07:53.400
Coming to DVDs soon, Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Full House.

03:07:53.400 --> 03:07:58.400
For all you sick pedophiles out there like the Olsen twins.

03:07:59.400 --> 03:08:02.400
When do I get my Golden Girls DVDs? When are those out?

03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:03.400
They're already out.

03:08:03.400 --> 03:08:05.400
What? What?

03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:06.400
I need Wonder Woman.

03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:10.400
Bitch, what? What? My Golden Girls DVDs are already out and I don't have them? What?

03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:14.400
I think they come out Tuesday, or I think they're already out. They were coming out in October.

03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:52.080
Alright, that's it we're going to pull the plug on the show now and we're going to go

03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:54.360
to tonight's post show.

03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:59.360
You guys seem to like the Dance Mania stuff, so we're going to do Dance Mania X7 tonight.

03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:03.480
There's a lot of fun songs on here, including some fourth mix songs, if you can believe

03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:04.480
it or not.

03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:08.840
