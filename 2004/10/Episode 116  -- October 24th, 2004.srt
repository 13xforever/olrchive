But first...

36
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,040
It's very, very sparkling water. I don't think you like some of that.

37
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Yeah, I don't drink soda. I drink Crystal Geyser sparkling mineral water.

38
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Why? Because I like to feign this diet I'm on. Anyway...

39
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Anyway, also joining us, as always, the third wheel of our program, our tech master, Loki.

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Oh, excuse me. Something in my throat there.

41
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Anyway, hi. Get the dick out of your mouth. It's time to start the show.

42
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,040
I like gummy bears. That makes me sad.

43
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Also joining us tonight, we have a couple of special guests.

44
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
They like to come to this show quite often here.

45
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm trying to get them a mic here.

46
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
DDR Angel's here.

47
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Hiya.

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
I'm here again, Angel.

49
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm starting to become a regular, be afraid.

50
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Don't you have anything else to do on Sunday night?

51
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Don't you have villages to burn and convenient stores to rob?

52
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Yay! I'm an angel, I'm not thinking of you like that!

53
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Yes!

54
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Yeah, this is the show needed. Loki went and bought an Arachuka this week.

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Also joining us, say hello to RKDN42, also known as Bradley.

58
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,600
Why am I not hearing it? Oh, maybe the damn-

This just sounds, this just sounds This just sounds, so everybody wants to be

72
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:32,580
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock This is the way we rock, this is the

73
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,580
The way we fight as we demonstrate, as we demonstrate

74
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
This just sounds

75
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,580
This just sounds

76
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,580
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

77
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:15,420
This is the way we rock, this is the way we ride

78
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:22,260
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock

79
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,260

Another day in my working sunshine

82
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,260
I can't leave all my cares behind now

83
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,260
I'm out to play, gonna have me some fun

84
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,260
In a world that is totally mine

85
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,260
I wonder how I'll see myself come alive

86
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Moving still turns into fear

87
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,260
As the turning happens, I'm still with the light

88
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,260
So my head comes to my feet

89
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,260
When I end up feeling the loss of the life,

90
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,260
I shall rise, staying with the keys.

91
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,260
After moving, I'll dance, I'm still with the vibe,

92
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,260
And even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

93
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,260
Uh, buj- uh, bukkake?

94
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,260

This lovely October evening.

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,260
I'm so tired today, I don't-

99
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,260
I don't know if I've got three hours' worth in me.

100
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,260
It's gonna be like squeezing the sponge to get the last, just last little drop out.

101
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,060
But I will do it. For the listeners, I will force myself.

102
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,380
And if you don't do it for them, we'll force you.

103
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,740
We're going to start off tonight's show. We start off every week playing a little bit of

104
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,540

106
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,040

107
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,340
My week was all busy crap.

111
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,540
No. It was busy. And it's going to be even busier next week.

was going to cause me to cancel the show... Oh, right. Didn't happen.

115
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,060
Oh, no. And I was all stressing out. Well, you know about that. You told me.

116
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,460
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought it was

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,860
something else see I'm so good I have so many things going on right now that I'm

122
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:50,620

123
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,740
of stuff. What did I do this week? Oh yeah I played Leisure Suit Larry all week

124
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:01,420
that's pretty much what I did and other than that I played a little bit of Final

125
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:09,780
Fantasy this weekend and and then what else did I do? I don't know just kind of

126
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:19,500
hung out trying to stay out of the weather and yeah that's pretty much all

127
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,220
that happened oh and I bought an airzooka yesterday because I was at the mall I

128
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:30,720
had money I didn't want to buy a game I'm just gonna rent it and so you know I

129
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,000
couldn't leave empty-handed so I got an airzooka instead virgin didn't have any

130
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,760
echo image. Of course, why was I even looking? Because- WHAT?!

131
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,320
Explain what an airzooka is for those listeners that don't know.

132
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,320
It's a giant thing that shoots a ring of air at you. It's like a giant, um, I don't know,

133
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,840
it looks like a giant tube with a big, um, elastic thing at the end and you pull it back

134
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,400
and it creates, like, you know how if you were to blow smoke rings? Well, it does the

135
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,200
same thing. It creates, like, a shockwave of air that goes up to about ten feet and

136
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,640
supposedly harmless and you can like shoot it at animals and stuff and all

137
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,760
that fun stuff that's when Arizona is this giant thing that I wasted a lot of

138
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:23,920
well not a lot of money but I wasted money on and yeah that's pretty much all

139
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:31,000

163
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,740
oh and it also takes two officers for every fucking stop yep you think you can

164
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,860
pull someone over and they just bring their backup because they have that many

165
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,940
officers doing nothing yep they did that and rob mentions a

166
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,980
oh i saw two people and he actually passed me when i was

167
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,340
stopped and god forbid there was actually an accident there because then

168
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,540
they'd get like six cars over there i remember one time that we were sitting

169
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,060
in um subway and my friend accidentally

170
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,620
because they were waving at us and stuff they weren't paying attention they had

171
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,380
it in the wrong gear and accidentally um rear they um hit it

172
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,020
in reverse and like backed into a car and it took six cop

173
00:18:53,020 --> 00:19:00,380
cars to come to the Taco Bell to take down this report. It just frustrated the hell out

174
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
of me.

175
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,280
Yeah, bitches. Well, then once I got home, I called my manager and he said, you better

176
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,100
get it out tomorrow because those fees for the tow yards go up astronomically so they

177
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,640
can take away your car after several, like after a number of days, they'll take away

178
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,540
your car, put a lien on it, sell it off. So you want to get it out tomorrow.

179
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:28,380
So after that I had to wait until like 4am in the morning, call my mom on the east coast

180
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,680
and ask her to put some money in my account and she did it for me.

181
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,700
So in the morning I called my co-worker and she drove me over to the Carmichael DMV and

182
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:46,340
10 minutes after they opened I paid $319 and got my registration and temporary tags so

183
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,260
I could get a smog check.

184
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,260
And so, from there, since the bus wasn't coming for 30 minutes, I decided, oh, I'll just go

185
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,920
ahead and start walking towards ARC, the American River College.

186
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,000
That took about, by 45 minutes later, I was there, even though my foot was hurting in

187
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,040
the beginning, but it didn't hurt after a while, so that was okay.

188
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,500
But after that, I took a bus from there to Greenback, then from there to Orangevale where

189
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,840
the thing was.

190
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,180
The cohort says, hey, okay, let's see if we can get it out.

191
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,380
So you have to go to Folsom PD and get them to release it.

192
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,260
So you have to like go there and show them that you got your registration and everything.

193
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,220
So after that, so I didn't know about the buses to there, so I started walking towards

194
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,520
Folsom, and I missed the bus that came next, so I said ah let's go ahead and walk.

195
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,860
So I walked another mile and a half down the hill, which wasn't too bad, it was a nice

196
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,180
day out and so on.

197
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,620
Then from there, I walked across the bridge because I missed the bus there.

198
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,260
I kind of just went on and then said, nah, I'll just go walk a bit farther.

199
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,020
So here comes the stupid part.

200
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,180
There's a, I've got like a little, the person at the tow yard set gave me a map, which is

201
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:03,220
a, you should go to Natoma Boulevard, or Natoma Street, but I thought it was Natomas Street,

202
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,060
and I thought it was like a right turn, so I, when I went to Natomas Street, I went and

203
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,340
turned to the right, and thought, oh, the levers are going up, and I didn't think to

204
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,280
go left and see if there was something up that way. I just went down this, kept going

205
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,760
down this road miles and miles. Didn't ask any directions or anything until I got to

206
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,520
the end, basically to a big cross street. I asked the lady, I asked the lady in the

207
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,660
apartment there, apartment complex says, uh, where's the Tolsom PD? She said, it's Natoma,

208
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,320
there's no Natoma Street, you idiot. She didn't say that, of course, she was probably thinking

209
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,640
it was crazy. It's a crazy guy walking away, a long way. So, after that, I walked back

210
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,100
to the next bus stop, that took me to the end of the street and I had to walk like half

211
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,480
a mile or so down to the PD, they said oh okay here we go, give me a ticket and say

212
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,840
okay oh we got to pay $20, oh fuck, got to go across the street, get money out of the

213
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,060
bank, oh my god, then walked back across the street, paid the money, then got to go back

214
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:05,720
to the thing, so walked back down to Riley and then got on a bus which was good, the

215
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,240
took me almost there, then paid $175 to the fucking tow yard and got it out and yay. Then

216
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,600
I went back to work for like three and a half hours and then made it up the rest of the

217
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,320
week, basically made up my whole week and that was it for that.

218
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,000
Tough lesson learned to everybody out there. Register your car!

219
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,680
Yeah. Don't fucking drive in Folsom. Stay far away. And then other news, I got keys

220
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,320
to work so I can stay late and lock up the place if I, after everyone else has left.

221
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,880
Well if you want to make, you know, if you want to run through red lights and make illegal

222
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,440
left turns, Folsom's where it's at, because no one gives a shit.

223
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,960
Not broke now, because Mother gave me enough money so that I could do that, do that and

224
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,720
a little bit of extra money, which is helpful because I could go and get a new tear mat

225
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,720
because my other one has a hole in it that's been poking me in the foot for, like, three or four months.

226
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,720
And then go to the Mall of Wart, the Mart of Walls, and buy stuff.

227
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,720
That's what I did today, before coming here.

228
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Fine. There we go.

229
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,720
All right, wow, well, interesting week there.

230
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week went.

231
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Well, not much, really. Just school and work.

232
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,280
Although my instructor is becoming quite a flake.

233
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,520
He almost cancels class on Monday.

234
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,880
Eh, well, I suppose he has his own reasons.

235
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,640
Played a little Katamari Damacy and other stuff this week.

236
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:56,680
Maybe like a couple hours worth of FF11, which is not as bad as you guys, but hey, it's something.

237
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:04,280
And I also spent some time with, well what, one third of Orange Lounge?

238
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,240
Not the hosts of course, the other people that usually come here.

239
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:19,620
Last night, and spent an hour waiting to get into dinner, had dinner and watched movies

240
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,020
and stuff last night, that was pretty cool.

241
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,660
Which I don't get to do that often, so that was kind of fun.

242
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,660
And, uh, that's about it, pretty much.

243
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
Alright.

244
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,660
I have something else to add, but I think you're gonna talk about it, so I'll let you bring that up.

245
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
Okay, I'll, uh, I'll talk about my weekend.

246
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,660
My weekend, my weekend, um, pretty much this week was, you know, pretty, uh,

247
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,660
nothing too wonderful or exciting, but I mean, because I did two live shows this week,

248
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,660
and I ended up filling in for Jamie on Tuesday just because we didn't have a repeat to run,

249
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
and I was bored, so I said, what the hell.

250
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,860
So I did that Tuesday and then of course I had the regular show on Wednesday.

251
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,160
And then Thursday I hung out with my friend and pretty much nothing interesting happened until Friday

252
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,160
when I went and saw The Grudge with Loki and his girlfriend and my buddy Christopher.

253
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,660
We went to this theater, my god it was packed.

254
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,560
Not only was the theater packed, but it was packed full of high schoolers.

255
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,260
Because apparently these movies really appeal to the high schoolers.

256
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,560
Boy do we make a mistake going on opening night with all these high schoolers in there

257
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,760
because every scary part of the movie, and there was a lot.

258
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,260
the movie is pretty scary every scary part every all the girls like and like

259
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,180
even it's I don't want to ruin it but there's this one part where the

260
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:40,380
screaming became almost rhythmic it was like it was really funny I can't if

261
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,860
you've seen the movie you probably could figure out what part I'm talking about

262
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,740
but this is one part where it just was rhythmic it was so funny but then there

263
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,860
was this guy in the back of the theory was being really annoying and you know

264
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,640
the type I'm talking about he's like that high school jock type you sit there

265
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,600
go like making those noises because apparently other high school jock types

266
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,720
find those kinds of noises funny and their girlfriends or whatever so he was

267
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,800
kind of mocking how everybody else was getting scared and apparently this is

268
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,560
funny when somebody does this never mind that it's a sold-out theater and he's

269
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,220
getting on everybody else's nerves in the theater and just bugging the hell

270
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,100
out of all of us you could just feel the tension like everybody just wanted to

271
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,100
turn around and punch this guy in the face am I right Loki sure okay so

272
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,180
finally I don't know what came over me but I just turned it and mind you this

273
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,660
is right at the climax of the movie towards the end the movie he's still

274
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,320
yelling and screaming he's been doing it for five minutes I turn around I look

275
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,500
right at him and I yell in the crowded theater I sell I said with the guy with

276
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,980
the little penis in the back row please shut the hell up and everybody burst into

277
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,820
applause and started laughing and so it was kind of cool and then he shut up so

278
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,500
he knew who he was by the way I addressed him by being the small penis

279
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,980
guy so my advice to you don't be afraid to shout it out if people are distracting

280
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,700
the movie because chances are everybody else around you is finding them

281
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,980
distracting too and they'll back you up they're just being chicken they don't

282
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,540
want to say anything so I can credit my couple years God several years

283
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,020
experience with Rocky Horror Picture Show for making me unafraid to yell back

284
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,300
at a movie so speaking of which I ended up going to see a local production of

285
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,100
the Rocky Horror Show which the movie is based on they did a little bit of the

286
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,020
play here in Sacramento and it's pretty nice rice princess she's been out you

287
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,580
know she's usually on Wednesday nights outside the box but she's been out of

288
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,180
the loop for a couple weeks because she's been doing costuming for this

289
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,820
show so I kind of went to see how that all worked out in the costumes were very

290
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,140
nice as was the choreography a little thing I wanted to mention about it it

291
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:47,300
was the Broadway version, the one that they played on Broadway in 2000, so

292
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,860
that's where the different, you know, people were talking about, well this isn't

293
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,300
how the original play was because it actually was the the redo for Broadway.

294
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,980
Yeah, original Brian went back into the strip for Broadway. I

295
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,540
recognize it because I have the the 2000 recording and it was it was the it was

296
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:13,100
the same thing very good so it was a good show I liked it too bad it's over

297
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,740
so I can't really recommend it to anyone else because it's done now Saturday or

298
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,340
today was the last show so if you haven't seen it yet too bad and besides

299
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,100
a lot of you aren't in Sacramento anyway so this means nothing to you but it is a

300
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,580
good play if it comes to your town you should check it out it's pretty funny

301
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,900
how people can yell back even at the actors even when it's not a movie and

302
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,700
and then other than that I've just been doing a lot of rehearsal because there

303
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,180
is going to be another production of the movie soon

304
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,340
which I'm involved with so I've just been very tired going to rehearsal

305
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,700
and things like that and Jamie knows where I'm coming from with that certainly

306
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,660
Amen. I'm just glad I don't have to do prop crew this time around

307
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,260
I mean I like doing prop crew and that's all cool. I'm doing lighting and that means I'm going to just sit on my butt playing with light switches

308
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,660
It's a good job, it's an easy job, it's good. You have a lot of control in that little box

309
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,980
I don't mind the running about. If someone makes you mad, you just turn the light off.

310
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,440
Well, I don't really mind doing the running about, putting stuff up on...

311
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,920
You know, it was fun. But I was exhausted last time I did it.

312
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,540
And, you know what, I'm just gonna sit back because I'm stressed enough. So after

313
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,140
next week, it's just gonna be so tired. Which, by the way, reminds me, you guys,

314
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,940
next week is Halloween.

315
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,420
And so, on Halloween night, it's not looking like we're gonna have a live show,

316
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,740
you guys. Just, you know,

317
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,140
because it's Halloween and people want to go out and do Halloween stuff, we actually don't

318
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,180
think there's enough listener base because you guys will probably all want

319
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,060
to go out and do your own things for Halloween so what I think we might do

320
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:40,700
next weekend we might do some type of very scary marathon of old orange lounge

321
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,940
episodes we might fit that in next week so that means we definitely get to hear

322
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,520
Loki sing yeah that means episode 69 for sure would be in there because that has

323
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,020
to be the one of the scariest episodes we ever did so we're gonna work something

324
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:59,220
out where we do a marathon of old episodes so that's pretty much it for my

325
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,000
week of my day nobody had anything remotely DDR related in their week at

326
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,740
all it's just yes angel I was at fries and I met one of our local freestylers

327
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:19,580
prestige oh okay I've never what is fries the place to play DDR in town now

328
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:25,860
because I know that what's what's his name online I can't remember Islander I

329
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,740
don't know his real name I can't remember his name online Islander plays

330
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,180
a lot at Fry's from what I hear he plays a lot of DDR at Fry's cuz I guess it's

331
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,780
near his work and then I guess prestige goes there you're going there and you

332
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,880
were playing DDR if Fry's must be the place to be now all of a sudden what

333
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,640
happened to well I mean I know what happened to Golf Land and all the

334
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,120
arcades in town but it's kind of sad when a department store becomes the main

335
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,200
DDR hang out in town. Well I was just shopping for geek stuff and well he was

336
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,640
there and so we just started playing DDR for like 15 minutes and like eyeing the

337
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,400
employees that work there cuz you know I guess they don't see a lot of people

338
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,740
that can actually play the game all day long so that was pretty uh pretty cool

339
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:15,160
he's pretty good I liked watching him more than I like playing myself but they

340
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:26,000
had Xtreme up and so we were playing that. It was fun. Good times, good times. So it's

341
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,640
getting sad but there's just you have to understand there's really not a whole lot of reason for

342
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,440
us to go out and play DDR in this town anymore because really nobody's really gotten anything

343
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:43,800
new in six months at least, when did Golf, I'm sorry, when did Guitar Freaks 9, 10 come

344
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
out?

345
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,880
What the hell version do they have anyway, 9?

346
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,960
I could give a shit after 5, really.

347
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,840
They actually still have the same 8th Guitar Freaks, 8th Mix, where they put in Drummani

348
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,480
or Percussion Freaks, 9th Mix, I think.

349
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,360
That's it, Percussion Freaks, 9th Mix, and Guitar Freaks, 8th Mix, which makes no sense

350
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
at all.

351
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
They have time, it doesn't work, so.

352
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Yeah.

353
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:16,360
So that's the last new Bomani this town saw anyway, except the step mania machine, but that thing was broken so fast that it, you know, never really got to stick around.

354
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:24,360
So really, I think at this point a lot of us are just sitting and waiting in anticipation of Ultramix 2, because that's going to be the next big story.

355
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,360
I actually did play DDR Extreme the other day though, it's still really fun to me.

356
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,160
That's one thing I guess I could say for it is that I was playing on the ignition pad trying to work some of my

357
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,800
Fat ass off because I've got a show to do next week

358
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,020
popping music and 2dx8 also

359
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,360
Absolutely, it's gonna be definitely a huge week November 18th when

360
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,200
Festival and pop music 10 and all that fun stuff 2dx8 stock them out, too

361
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,820
Oh, you know we had a trailer

362
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,620
There was a trailer for 2dx8 style that came out not too long ago

363
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,840
We completely forgot to mention it last week, so I'm gonna make sure to bring it up tonight in fact

364
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,440
I'm gonna do that right now. If I can find that. Here it is.

365
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,440
Here's some audio here from a new preview that is out for

366
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,520
2DX8 style. And I'll show this here in studio.

367
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,720
Of course you hear a little bit of Guadeca there.

368
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,840
And it just shows the Konami logos here.

369
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,080
And it says, ooh, 2DX8 style! And it's showing a lot of the screenshots in the game and all these

370
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,200
videos. You see like,

371
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:33,640
alien world and a bunch of Japanese text something 50 and something 80 I'm sure

372
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:40,040
somebody in our chat room can translate that there new song

373
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:54,040
It's a very nice clip there of a Santa song.

374
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,040
This is a new song as well.

375
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Yeah, it's definitely an LED song.

376
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:11,200
look at that and it says there November 18 and had some clips from the new

377
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,880
videos in there as well so I don't even remember where I got that I think

378
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,540
somebody sent it to me so I would totally pass along where you guys could

379
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:25,640
get it except I don't remember they said 50 new songs over 80 songs in total and

380
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,840
they're confirming in our chat room Dark Lion XVI says the last song is Nebula

381
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,200
Grasp Grasper was that last song you heard a little clip of there and I the

382
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,060
The one before that was the Santa song that's in the new pop music as well, right?

383
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,740
The one that she sang at Tokyo Game Show.

384
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,420
Correct me if I'm wrong.

385
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,420
I could be.

386
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
I don't know.

387
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
Alright.

388
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,680
Also in bemoning news this week, we got a little bit of bemoning news.

389
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,300
The box art for UltraMix 2 came out.

390
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,340
You might have seen this at your local store, actually.

391
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,540
And the interesting thing about the box art, though, is that it has a little thing in there

392
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,260
that talks about how it features dance hits like remember how DDR Max said ooh

393
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,860
this features dance hits from Darude and Aurora and all the bands that were in

394
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,340
there and the max 2 is ooh it's Kylie Minogue well this one says featuring dance

395
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,140
hits by delirium we knew that after all right Elvis we knew that rubberneck and

396
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,700
freestylers which isn't ringing a bell with me so I don't think we know about

397
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,300
what this song is and they've tried to do research I think over on the DDR

398
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,660
freak thread but nobody's come up with what song that could be yet so maybe

399
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,060
we'll hear more about that later but we have the Commodores which we know is

400
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,300
Brick House, Nucleus which is jam on it we talked about that before, Captain Jack

401
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:47,380
I believe the dream a dream booty mix was confirmed previously and now Jason

402
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:53,920
Nevins presents Holly James well guess what Jason Nevins and Holly James they

403
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,960
only ever did one song together so that pretty much knows I had that song was

404
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:07,160
just announced recently so anyway we're going to go ahead and play that song for

405
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,200
you guys right now it's Jason Nevins and Holly James and the song is called I'm

406
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,800
in heaven and we'll play that for you guys now this hasn't been confirmed but

407
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,240
it's kind of one of those things where it's like well unless it's a remix or

408
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,400
or something like that, who knows?

409
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,180
So we're gonna play that for you guys right now.

410
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,280
The assumed radio edit would be the version

411
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,580
they'd use in DDR, because we haven't heard

412
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,060
if it's a remix again.

413
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,280
It's kind of unconfirmed, but at the same time,

414
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,520
when it's on the box art, you know, duh.

415
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,180
So here it is, Jason Evans with Holly James, I'm in Heaven.

416
00:36:43,180 --> 00:37:12,180
Come in heaven with you, come in heaven with you.

417
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:27,380
I don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel

418
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,620
When these feelings I have really are for real

419
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,900
The time is right for this, a love to shine the moon through

420
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,020
But you gotta tell me what you wanna do

421
00:37:38,020 --> 00:38:01,900
I'm in heaven with you

422
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,900
I'm in heaven with you

423
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,900
Heaven

424
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Heaven

425
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,900
Every time you're near I start to lose control

426
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,400
When the thought of you, hits my very soul

427
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,200
When you're lying in my bed, right next to me

428
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,900
That's when it starts to feel, feel like ecstasy

429
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,400
I'm in heaven with you

430
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,400
I'm in heaven with you

431
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,400
I'm in heaven with you

432
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I'm in heaven with you

433
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I'm in heaven with you

434
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,040
I mean, heaven, you

No, no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no, no

438
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,600
Heaven, Why?

Let your blood shine

440
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,940
Let your blood shine

Left.

471
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,620
Oh, no, the connection's still kind of shy. Can you hear me okay?

472
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
Yep.

473
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:52,620
Oh, no, we're still having a problem hearing him. He's very, uh, it's very choppy.

474
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:59,180
of you only hear a couple seconds here and there and then that's it are you are you i hear you

475
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:05,020
oh there you go i can kind of hear him oh he says he can hear us okay you might have something with

476
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,420
your mic sensitivity settings i'm having i'm wondering if it's the mic sensitivity because

477
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,340
i heard like a little bit there can you hold the mic up nice and uh oh hi

478
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,340
Yeah.

479
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,340
Okay, so, I'm gonna try and do a conversation here.

480
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,340
How are you doing this evening, frequency?

481
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,340
I'm doing okay. I just woke up from that one weekend.

482
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,340
You know, sort of back to early.

483
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,340
Alright, so tell us a little bit about this tournament that just happened on the East Coast recently.

484
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,340
I was kind of curious about what went on there.

485
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,340
Because we don't get to talk a whole lot about East Coast events on the show,

486
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,340
so I'm kind of curious what went on with this tournament.

487
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:57,340
...was not so good, um, but not for me, because I'm hanging up the time.

488
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,340
Okay. All right, take care, bud. Bye-bye.

489
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,340
Ah, what a bummer. What a bummer.

490
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:27,340
I do have another idea, though, but I can't get to it until the next break, but that does give me an idea.

491
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:31,340
Okay, so I guess we have to shift gears here.

492
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,340
Darn, because I have a lot of good questions I want to ask them, too, and we don't get East Coast people on this show a whole lot, but that's all right.

493
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,340
We'll give it a try later.

494
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:44,340
Well, moving on, I guess we could talk about other news going on.

495
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,340
Didn't you find some news about Pump It Up that was going on this week, Loki?

496
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,340
You got really bored and you found out that Pump It Up actually had some news going on?

497
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
Yeah, there was two things going on.

498
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:59,340
Number one being, there's another release that's coming out in November, I believe,

499
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,340
and that would be Pump It Up Exceed on the JPS2.

500
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,340
So that's going to be coming out.

501
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,340
God damn it.

502
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,340
Dude, our connection is fucking sucking tonight.

503
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:16,340
Anyways, yeah, so Pump It Up Exceed, um, it's gonna be coming out. It's gonna be arcade perfect. Um, so they've got 100 plus songs.

504
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:29,340
Uh, it's gonna be coming out one week before all the DDR stuff. Um, there's rumors though that it's gonna be, uh, coming out also for the US PS2 and the Xbox, uh, later on.

505
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:40,340
Also, they've added a few different modes in there. They have a mode that's kind of like where you just watch videos, the background videos and that type of thing.

506
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:56,340
And also, supposedly, the PC version USB pads that shipped with the old version, Premiere, I think actually are going to be working with the PS2 version, so that should be pretty interesting.

507
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:03,380
interesting looks pretty cool so far other than that starting looks like this

508
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:10,580
coming week in Korea at Animaro headquarters will be beta testing for

509
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:15,340
pump it up exceed 2 which they have really released any details on that I'm

510
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,860
sure that'll be coming next week as you know stuff leaks out from the beta test

511
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:25,540
location. So that's your Pump It Up news.

512
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:31,660
Exciting. I think it's very strange that Pump It Up could possibly come to the

513
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,380
U.S. That's very strange, and then they're also saying they're rumouring that In The

514
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,060
Groove could be coming to the home versions as well, so it's gonna be very

515
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,540
interesting. I doubt that one, but I do too, but they're saying it, so I guess I

516
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:49,580
should acknowledge it. I doubt that. But no seriously, McSeed though is doing

517
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,520
extremely well like in some of the other countries that you know non English

518
00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:00,560
countries like Mexico is fucking hot over there and I couldn't I mean why not

519
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,880
try release it over here see how it does because I'm sure I mean most of the

520
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,920
stuff they've got is in-house artists anyways so you're not really you know

521
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,280
gonna lose money on licensing as far as music goes really there's not much to

522
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,720
lose there I mean other than you you know oh you have to make some new pads

523
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,840
or something but I think you'd do pretty well over here you know give it a shot I

524
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,520
mean can't be any worse than like say you know Britney's dance beat and all

525
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,400
that crap I mean at least it's a step above all that stuff so you know hey why

526
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:33,120
not I think it'd be very interesting if they did give pumping up a home release

527
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:39,020
for this reason because DDR they've kind of stopped doing the arcade thing and I

528
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:43,880
think especially with DDR or I'm sorry with Konami USA they've kind of given up

529
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,700
on doing the arcade thing there's not going to be a new arcade mix unless hell

530
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,620
freezes over so basically it is possibility but very low chance low low

531
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,540
low chance so basically they've pretty much stuck to the home versions and I

532
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,600
think everybody understands that the home versions are where they make their

533
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,680
money and economy of America they push the home versions it's their bread and

534
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,980
butter for DDR they see the future of DDR being these home versions and that's

535
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,300
why they never really threw a fit over the import mixes at least as far as I

536
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:16,860
can tell because the import mixes of DDR arcade kind of serve as promotion for

537
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,460
the home versions so everything works out everybody you know gets their share

538
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,500
well now if pump it up ends up coming up for the home coming out for the home

539
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,420
versions was Konami gonna take issue to that is there anything they can do about

540
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,620
it me I don't know I mean there were those rumors a while back that and amir

541
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,500
own Konami might have had it out in court and that's why I don't know it's a

542
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,580
a bunch of rumors going on out there.

543
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,860
You think Konami would take issue with that?

544
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,420
What do you think would happen?

545
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,260
Anybody have a thought?

546
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,900
Loki, I'd especially be curious what you think of you.

547
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,500
I seem to have a strong opinion.

548
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,020
I don't know if they're legally able

549
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,700
to bring it over here, actually,

550
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,220
because of the whole lawsuit thing earlier,

551
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,880
but I don't know, you can't really,

552
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,940
I mean, DDR hasn't gone after,

553
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,060
you know, Konami hasn't gone after

554
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,780
any of these other games that have similar,

555
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,660
you know, rhythm type things with them.

556
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:12,740
I'm sure it'll be you know fine they I mean it'd be pretty cheap if they just

557
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,340
like went after him if they started doing well I mean oh yeah well now that

558
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,460
they're doing well I guess yeah we have a problem with it now but yeah I don't

559
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:28,460
know to be honest I I really don't know but here's the thing here's my concern

560
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:35,420
okay about in the groove coming to the home console first off I don't think

561
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,780
is gonna happen only because one it's gonna be hard I mean making a console

562
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,900
game is a little harder than making you know just the arcade you know ports and

563
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,260
stuff cuz I mean hell anyone can hook up a PC to an arcade machine it's not that

564
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,660
hard now programming for the home console is a little different well if

565
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,940
it's fucking hard enough they have 11 12 footers in the arcade how the fuck you

566
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,140
gonna play that on a softpad that's never gonna work so that's my concern

567
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,580
right there I don't think it's ever gonna happen I mean it yeah I'm sure

568
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:11,580
if they'd like to see it happen, but feasibly I don't think it's going to happen.

569
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:39,060
Huh. I'm not sure. Yeah, I completely forgot about that. You're right, Pump It Up did have

570
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:44,660
a previous home release on the PC. Not that the dance market on PC is very lucrative.

571
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:49,420
I believe the folks that created DDR PC found that out the hard way. You know, I saw those

572
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:55,860
games going for like $10 a pop at Fry's not too long ago. Interesting. Do you think that...

573
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,420
I think I got mine for about the same.

574
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,460
Do you think that Pump It Up coming out for the home version would help DDR? Or do you

575
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:09,340
think it's going to hurt it? You know, I think that after they compare, but I don't know,

576
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:14,300
it can depend. There's different factors to consider. I think the biggest turn off is

577
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:19,140
that you have to get a whole other dance pad for Pump It Up, because although it would

578
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:24,340
be very easy, you would think, with the ignition pad, you could just use the buttons, the XO

579
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,660
circle square, which are in the corners, but there's no center button. The center doesn't

580
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,140
do anything on those pads, as far as I know, so you're kind of screwed there.

581
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,100
The Pump It Up pads not only do have the corner buttons, they do have the up, down, left,

582
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:46,140
right buttons also, because those are for song select stuff. They use those. So, yeah.

583
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:51,320
So theoretically, any DDR pad that has all the corner buttons would work, except the

584
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,780
official Konami ones, because they don't have triangle and, what's the other one that's

585
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,900
missing, they don't have triangle and square on the back like most of the other pads do,

586
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,560
except all the other pads are missing that center button. So, now you gotta have a whole

587
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,980
new dance pad if you wanna play Pump It Up at the home. And how many people are that

588
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,720
obsessed with Pump It Up where they're gonna spend all the money on that? And how many

589
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,400
stores are gonna pick up those Pump It Up pads for commercial sale? Because, you know,

590
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,040
you find those third-party pads in every little store that sells video games now.

591
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,480
Well, you never know. I mean, it could possibly.

592
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,400
could. The possibility's there, but how successful can it be when it's so

593
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,640
limited, when Konami kind of has a grip on it as it is. I don't know. It'd be

594
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,680
interesting. Alright, I guess what we're going to do now is we're going to take

595
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,200
another break. When we come back, we'll hopefully have everything set up so we

596
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,120
can try calling frequency again. That'll be very cool. If not, I guess we'll have

597
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,080
ourselves a cage match. That'll be some fun, and we'll talk about some more DDR

598
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:56,480
D.R. Bamani when we come back. In this break, let's do, well you know what I kind of want

599
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,840
to do if I can find the music? Let's do some D.R. Disney.

600
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,200
You play fire. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Let's see

601
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:11,600
if I can find the directory that has all my random stuff in it. Oh shoot, not all the

602
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:19,280
Disney stuff's in here. Okay, we'll see what we can do. Oh, I do have the Mickey Mouse

603
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,280
Okay, we have enough to do a break. We'll be back after this.

604
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Who's the leader of the God Professor, you and me?

605
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,280
N-I-C-K-Y-M-I-U-S-E

Fire!

621
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,860
Fire!

622
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,860
Alright!

623
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:33,860
Now that's a loud boost!

624
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,860
Now that's a loud boost!

625
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,860
Let my fingers beat me!

626
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:49,860
Now that's a loud boost!

627
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:47,860
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

628
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,100
new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

629
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,140
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music & More

630
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,860
program. Can we talk about that?

631
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:01,660
No subject will ever be taboo. Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up

632
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,300
the volume from Tuesday nights.

633
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,460
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

634
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:11,700
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the

635
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,300
station?

636
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:17,660
I collect your fucking head. Just like this fucker here.

637
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:24,660
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

638
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:32,660
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

639
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:37,660
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

640
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,660
You know what I never understood, Jamie, is why does your voice sound so different in that promo?

641
01:00:44,660 --> 01:01:00,020
in that promo I think so I think so now I'm gonna I got this new thing for Skype

642
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,180
that allows us to dial phone numbers so I'm gonna try this real fast I'm gonna

643
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:07,260
do a test I hate to do this live on air but damn it I want this to happen

644
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,700
Ooh, it worked. What the hell do you want?

645
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,300
I think it worked. Hello, can you hear me on this thing?

646
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:21,660
Yeah, there's a delay, but that's cool. I'm on a phone, and I'm here.

647
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,180
You need to hang up. We don't want any. Alright, I'm hanging up on him. Cool, it worked.

648
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,740
Okay, so hopefully we can do that and make it work. It's a little quiet,

649
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:34,580
but maybe I can tweak the volume settings in there and get it to work. Would you like to take a survey?

650
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,180
you're crazy

651
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,100
no no I'm not crazy

652
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:49,100
I'm slightly strange Loki's the crazy one with his portal to hell and all that

653
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:58,540
all right how's it going there Loki you're trying to figure out what that

654
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,500
freestyler song could be huh

655
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,820
you're trying to do research there what were you doing there earlier you were hacking

656
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:08,140
that master file thing that I don't even I can't even remember what the hell this

657
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:16,540
thing is it's the master song list I was looking at it from well this is from

658
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:21,620
its document that or it's a file that's in well this one's in the DDR extreme

659
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:26,780
USA CD or DVD so I was looking to see because there are so there's a few songs

660
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:31,620
in there I see some from the new new dancing stage game that's gonna be

661
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,700
coming out then there's a few that I didn't recognize so I was just seeing if

662
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:39,620
I could figure it out because I'm in here remember we you know reported it a

663
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:45,620
few weeks back about superstar that's in there so you know just stuff like that

664
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:54,460
so I was just seeing if it might be in there it might be you never know what is

665
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:58,380
that you know I found I had the microphone in my lap and people can hear

666
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:09,600
me being I am I'm sure my bad all right I guess we're going to do is go into the

667
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:15,640
orange lounge radio cage match for this week you want change your song do you

668

670
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:42,000

671
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,720
you're out of here but let's have one more moment to remember the echo image

672
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:52,080
the very first song ever to be retired in the orange lawn radio cage match here

673
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,400
let me feel if the song near the song was called come back and here's a little

674
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,400
a little bit of comeback for you to remember this song by.

675
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Alright, that's enough of this song. You've heard enough of it over the past four weeks.

676
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:28,400
All right, so you get three brand new songs in their entirety tonight, each host bringing

677
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:34,440
one song to the table. And who's going to go first tonight? I guess I will, why not?

678
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,960
I never get to go first, because I hardly ever win this thing. So, I'm going to go first

679
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:44,280
tonight. I'm going to play my song, and whoops, that's not the song I'm doing. My song is

680
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:51,280
a song by Ian van Dow, who is the guy who did Will Eye from DDR Max 2, and he has a

Where is love Are we gonna stay together

685
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:48,760
Or is it time to say goodbye Where is love

686
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:55,760
Give me a reason To hold on to what we've found

687
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,760
Must be a reason

688
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,760
To hold on to what we've got

689
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,760
Time has come to set things right

690
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,760
Is it worth another fight?

691
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,760
Tell me the truth

692
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,760
Is there something on your mind?

693
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,760
Tell me what you hide inside

694
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,760
Tell me the truth

695
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,760
Give me a reason

696
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,760
To hold on to what we've got

697

698
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,760
To hold on to what we've got

699
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,760
Give me a reason

700
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,760
To hold on to what we've got

701
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:57,760
There must be a reason To hold on to what we've found

702
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:08,760
Are there things that I should know Will you stay or will you go?

703
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:18,760
So where is the love? Tell me, is there hope inside?

704
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,760
Galleries between the lines

705
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,760
Where is the love?

706
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,760
Give me a reason

707
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:52,060

708
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:58,460
Hold on to what we got, give me a reason

709
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:05,520
Hold on to what we got, must be a reason

710
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:12,520
Hold on to what we've got, give me a reason

711
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:36,280
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

712
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,000
That was Ian Bandau with Reason.

713
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,240
Let's go around and see if they had a reason to like or hate this song in the studio.

714
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,240
Jamie!

715
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,240
It's fancy.

716
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,240
Um...

717
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,240
Again, I'm really burned on tonight.

718
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,240
But it's not bad.

719
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,240
I mean...

720
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,240
I've heard it before.

721
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,240
Um, it's a 7. 7 and a half.

722
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,240
I actually thought Jamie would give it a lower score,

723
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,240
because I remember her saying she was sick of trance.

724
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,240
But damn it, I'm out of songs!

725
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,240
That's a new one that I happen to like.

726
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,240
Bradley, what'd you think?

727
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,240
I thought it was pretty good. I'd give it an 8.

728
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:18,640
I'm not sick of trance, but I'm sick of Ian VanDahl, so I think it's a 6.

729
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,640
I like it.

730
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,640
It's happy.

731
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,600
It's not my favorite Ian VanDahl song, but I think it is worthy of a cage match title.

732
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,600
I give it an 8.5.

733
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:31,000
Uh, Ian VanDahl's cool, uh, I give it an 8.

734
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,200
Alright, let's go on to song number 2, which is coming to us courtesy of the lovely Dark

735
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,200
Sakura.

736
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,600
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us tonight?

737
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,800
Well, I need to find the name of the song again, because I remembered that you had it because you burned my CD.

738
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,700
Let me give you a hint. The song is called Everybody Wants You to Emerge.

739
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:51,900
That's it. It's a mix of Emerge by Fisher Spooner, and uh...

740
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,100
Where's the other group?

741
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:59,600
Billy Square, and just... I don't know. I like to mix.

742
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:06,300
So, I picked that. Because I had picked out, like, this remix of Bustin' Move, as in Young MC.

743
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,600
Yeah, I saw that when you sent the file over earlier.

744
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:15,600
I was in my car and Emerge is on my CD and I was like, I'll take this one. I think I'll do more of them.

745
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,600
And this comes from the Queer Eye for the Stray Guy soundtrack, right?

746
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,600
Yeah.

747
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:25,600
And every song on there is a good DDR song. Whether you love or hate the show, it's got a great bouncy soundtrack to it.

748
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
So, let's see if this...

749
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,600
Amazingly enough, I don't like the opening song.

750
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,600
Yeah, that's kind of weird, huh? I know, the opening song is like too gay, but the rest of it's really good.

751
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:44,560
good all right oh you should you should have heard the thing on Tuesday I did a

752
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:54,880
whole did you hear oh I did a whole block of 90s dance oh I remember being

753
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:02,520
in mobile and my friends little Honda thing listening to the station play all

754
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,480
those copy dancey stuff like that and and then I'll submit though and like

755
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,640
let the music play what I was going to be having and then I'll go back to the 90's copy

756
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,780
if for some reason heaven forbid Orange Moms Radio ever went belly-up and we

757
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:18,040
weren't doing this show anymore I think I would have to start an early 90s dance

758
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:23,080
music station. I would be rad. Maybe we just ought to start one anyway, compete with

759
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:27,800
ourselves you know hey there's somebody out there that I know we're trying to

760
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,440
negotiate with somebody out there to do a new show on our network and so they're

761
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,960
thinking of ideas for the show there's a great one right there and I know you

762
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,520
like that kind of music person in San Diego they have an 80s and 90s radio

763
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,160
station it's the best of both decades

764
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:51,640
all right popular when I get Grand Theft Auto tomorrow all right anyway anyway

765
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,140
We're getting way off subject, we're getting way off subject, way off subject.

766
01:11:55,140 --> 01:12:00,140
Let's go to Fisher Spooner vs. Billy Splier with Everybody Wants to Emerge. Enjoy.

767

783
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:55,140
Everybody, feels good

784
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,140
Everybody, feels good

785
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:02,140
Everybody wants it

786
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:04,140
I'm on the track

787
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,140
You want it too

788
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,140
You want something

789
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:47,260
Song number two in tonight's cage match, Fisher, Spooner vs. Billy Swire.

790
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,540
Everybody wants you to emerge.

791
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:52,900
Let's emerge our decisions on that song.

792
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,900
Jamie?

793
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:57,180
You know, I really like that mix of it.

794
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:02,260
It wasn't quite what I had remembered it to be, but I still like it, so it gets an A from

795
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,260
me.

796
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:07,580
One of these days I'm going to bring you a new song.

797
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:13,580
I was going to say, it samples an old song in there, because I've heard that old song at the raids before, I'm almost positive.

798
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:22,580
Well, Emergent is really cool, the song itself, but I mean, I really like that mix, because it's a lot different than the original.

799
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,580
Okay. Alright, let's go on to Bradley.

800
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:31,580
I had no idea what the hell they were saying, and it filled me with eh, so I gave it a 5.

801
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:43,380
lucky I second that it was just like it got annoying sorry I actually when I

802
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,820
heard that song I kind of thought this might be like a guitar freaks fun song

803
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:58,020
it's kind of funky I like it seven angels pretty cool um seven and a half

804
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:02,740

Alright, gotta love Loki.

836
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:45,940
Song number three in tonight's cage match from the Team America World Police soundtrack

837
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:53,340
America fuck yeah fuck yeah or fuck no Jamie it would be a humorous song for

838
01:19:53,340 --> 01:20:02,220
about ten minutes right I don't know I have no desire to see the movie fair

839
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:09,660
enough Arcadian fuck maybe you're like this seven seven one five

840
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,660
Alright, Loki.

841
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:19,660
I give it a 10. I was specifically instructed by my girlfriend not to sing the song any longer, so I give it a 10.

842
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:27,660
I hope you don't sing that while you're trying to have sex. Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! That's beyond!

843
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,660
I give that song the same score I'd give the movie a 4.

844
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,660
Angel.

845
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:39,660
No, a four out of ten.

846
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,660
Um, it was okay. I was seriously in the movie last night.

847
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,660
Okay, that's a touch point.

848
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:48,660
Um, five and a half.

849
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:51,660
Go see what?

850
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,660
You could go see a good movie instead.

851
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:57,660
Probably.

852
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,660
Seriously?

853
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:04,660
If you're gonna go see a movie, go see The Garage, but go on a school night where the kiddies can't go.

854
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:09,360
Alright, you've heard what we think, now it's time to hear what you think.

855
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:15,360
You're gonna decide tonight's winner from three brand new songs while Loki throws pens at me in anger of my score.

856
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,360
Alright, let's hear a clip from all three songs you can vote for tonight.

857
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:36,520
Song number one you can vote for tonight is Reason by Ian van Dowl and song

858
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:41,080
number two in tonight's cage match is Fisher Spooner versus Billy Squier

859
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,080
Everybody wants you to emerge.

860
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:59,800
And song number three in tonight's cage match from the Team America World Police Soundtrack

861
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:13,800
Fuck America, fuck yeah.

862
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,680
Place votes now, send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your votes.

863
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:23,240
Song number one, song number two, or Skye number three.

864
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:28,320
Song number three, your votes can decide it all.

865
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,560
You know the scary thing though about that Fuck Yeah song is it's actually, if you took

866
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,420
out the lyrics, it kind of sounds like a Guitar Freak song.

867
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,420
It really does.

868
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,420
Yeah.

869
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,420
Like an old one.

870
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,380
We're losing you there.

871
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,380
Adjust the bottom mic there.

872
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:43,380
Oh yeah, yeah.

873
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:44,380
There we go.

874
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:50,060
Especially with the speeding up like bass drum part, or kick drum or whatever.

875
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:56,520
Just like the little synthesizers and everything kind of make it, yeah, it makes it, it gives

876
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,520
Is it that sound?

877
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,520
Alright.

878
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,520
You know what it sounds like?

879
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,520
It sounds like limousine.

880
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,520
It's like PBR.

881
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,520
PBR.

882
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,520
Like the end of PBR.

883
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,520
That's what it sounds like.

884
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,520
Kinda.

885
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,520
It sounds like limousine.

886
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
God, I haven't heard limousine in a long, long time.

887
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
Limousine!

888
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,520
Strong back.

889
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:16,000
Oh boy, oh boy.

890
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,600
I can't believe that this is the first time we've had to retire a song.

891
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,840
You know we've been doing the cage match for almost two years now?

892
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,760
That's the first time we've had to retire a song.

893
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,600
We actually haven't done the cage match since episode one.

894
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,960
It was something we added to the show when we went three hours on episode 20, I think?

895
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,800
Because the show only used to be two hours.

896
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,800
All right.

897
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:38,320
All right, what we're going to do now, we're going to try and get that connection that

898
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,380
we had earlier.

899
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:42,520
We were trying to get frequency for the East Coast on the phone.

900
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,080
You guys, I'm sure you know this guy.

901
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:49,440
If you're on DDR Freak, if you're on Bomani Style, I think he's a mod on both those sites.

902
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,440
He's definitely out there.

903
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,240
If you're on the East Coast, you definitely, definitely know who this guy is.

904
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:57,240
So we're going to give him a call because we want to ask him some questions that were kind of spawned from last week's show.

905
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,240
So let's have a look and see if we can get frequency on the show.

906
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,240
Hello.

907
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,240
Hi, is this frequency?

908
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,240
Yes, it is.

909
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,240
Hey, how are you doing?

910
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,240
I'm doing okay.

911
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,240
Good. Oh, I'm so happy we can finally hear you a lot better.

912
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:15,240
It's going to be unfortunately a little bit quiet to our listeners, but that's kind of the best that we have to do right now.

913
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:19,240
But at least we can hear you fine here in studio, so that's the important thing.

914
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,240
Great. Fantastic.

915
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,240
Alright, so, how you doing? How was your week?

916
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:28,240
Um, the week was fine, um, you know, no problems there.

917
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:36,240
So, oh, look at that, interference from the guy next door, that's great.

918
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:40,240
The guy next door has a ham radio and I like to interfere with all the electronics in my house.

919
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:44,240
I think it's just the forces don't want you to come on this show.

920
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,240
I guess so.

921
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,240
I guess is what it is, oh well.

922
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:54,040
So, as I was trying to ask you earlier before Skype was cutting us off, you went to a tournament

923
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,960
this past weekend. Tell us a little bit about this tournament, because we're here on the

924
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,520
West Coast, we don't know anything about what's going on in the East Coast, and that needs

925
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:05,120
to change. So, inform us on what was going on with this East Coast tournament.

926
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:11,680
The East Coast tournament was, the tournament itself wasn't really a good tournament, in

927
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:20,040
In my opinion, a lot of the stuff just ran wrong and things weren't properly organized

928
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,200
and things like that.

929
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:27,440
And we, after the entire thing was done with, we realized what the problems were and we're

930
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,760
going to fix those for the next years and things like that.

931
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:37,660
But as publicity for DDR, it skyrocketed.

932
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:41,560
We actually had a caller last week, Zaku called in, he said something about the crowds that

933
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,960
had come to the DDR tournament were bigger than the ones for, what, the Blue Man group

934
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:46,960
and...

935
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:52,040
Yes, it's literally, you could literally pick any exhibition that was there.

936
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,940
Blue Man group was there for an hour, Ludacris and some other Def Jam artists were there

937
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:59,920
for an hour, for a little while, Opie and Anthony were there for a little while.

938
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,660
Opie and Anthony was the only one he mentioned.

939
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:06,560
They're hacks anyway, no I'm kidding.

940
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,560
So they were all there, but we still had a crowd no matter what.

941
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:19,560
Like, you know, these people when they came, they had a crowd for a little while, and then when the people left, there was no crowd at the other people's booths anymore.

942
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:29,560
Because these people were representing on XM radio and other, you know, like O.B. Anthony was at XM radio for like an hour or something like that.

943
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:36,560
Obviously they had a crowd for a little while, you know, but you know, you can only stay so long and listen to Nate O'Bannon, I guess.

944
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:44,560
But yeah, everyone was, everyone just stayed and watched people step on arrows all day. It was amazing. It was truly amazing.

945
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,560
Even Perfect Attack.

946
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:54,560
Yeah, more so than Freestyle, actually. There was a lot of people watching Perfect Attack that, you know, were just like, wow, this is amazing how they do that.

947
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:00,560
And half the people are like, even though they don't know what they're doing, they still want to know how they do that.

948
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:16,560
But, publicity-wise, Sammy, the person who put these women together, and myself, made a whole bunch of contacts on Thursday because the press was the people who allowed it on Thursday.

949
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,560
I was going to say, I bet a lot of press was at this event.

950
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,560
Yeah, we had a lot of press, and...

951
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:31,560
So does this mean we can be looking forward to seeing DDR in the news anytime soon, or in the press? Some big stuff?

952
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:39,560
Maybe not in the news and the press. There's already been enough stuff in the news and the press that it's in the wrong angle.

953
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,560
That's true. I guess that's very true.

954
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,520
the the problem is that the angle is

955
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,220
is uh... weight loss everyone like that weight loss angle and everyone you know

956
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:53,060
jumps on that i was at the box news a couple weeks ago i was actually ask you

957
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:56,380
about that the fox news the the fox news thing

958
01:27:56,380 --> 01:28:00,660
i'll tell you exactly what happened what they did was on friday that i get a call

959
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,680
from uh...

960
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:05,940
and i'm i'm like yeah sure i'll come in they just want to be a lot of what okay

961
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:07,360
i could give you a lot

962
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,860
so i come in

963
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,600
uh...

964
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,200
next day because that's when they want me to be interviewed live next day with no preparation

965
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:20,000
uh i'm sitting in the briefing room not getting briefs i was actually sitting next to the person

966
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,080
who was interviewing me and i had absolutely no idea until like i was actually called in

967
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,120
wow and when when i got into the studio the first thing the girl says is well you're not a kid and

968
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:36,480
i'm like no sorry someone should have probably informed you about something too what they thought

969
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,200
they were getting a twelve-year-old what yeah and I do have a thought they thought

970
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,640
a twelve-year-old was gonna end up coming in and doing interview I remember

971
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:47,120
that because we were watching the clip here in studio during a show about a

972
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,340
month ago and we were you know having a little fun with how kind of bad the

973
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,280
interviewer was the person was interviewing you and it sounded like she

974
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,800
was talking down to you like a lot of the questions she was asking I remember

975
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,040
didn't she say at one point in the interview gosh you're how old are you

976
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:05,440
yeah yeah I was 21 but the thing that got me the most was when you when she

977
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:12,120
said, you're part of the DDR freaks, and I'm like, are you serious? Are you serious? Are

978
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,880
you really, what are you doing to me right now?

979
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:16,220
It's obvious they hadn't done any research.

980
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:21,160
So like, I mean, I'm doing it for DDR, you know, to get the publicity up there for it,

981
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:26,440
so even though it's just the wrong angle for it, I mean, I tried to jump onto, you know,

982
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,400
the competition thing, she just tossed it right off of that, so regardless, they're

983
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:36,720
not ready for it. Right. But, you know, upcoming now. Wait, actually, I have a quick question

984
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,360
for you. I have a quick question for you though, before we change the subject. Do you think

985
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:43,040
that part of that might be Konami's fault? Because Konami's kind of going the weight

986
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:52,040
loss angle with this? Um, Konami hasn't done much. I'll tell you right now, they haven't

987
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:57,880
done much in the publicity of DER. They, um, you know, and they don't really need to, because

988
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:03,320
very true. It just so happens that mixes keep selling, home mixes at least, keep selling.

989
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,080
Word of mouth is a powerful thing.

990
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,800
Yeah, it just happens.

991
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,480
You know, people see these dance mats in the game stores, and they're like oh, what does that go with?

992
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,680
And they go with this D.P.R. game.

993
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,600
You know, and they buy it, they take it home, and there's a lot of people who actually play it home, and they just don't

994
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,520
know about the

995
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,440
you know, community behind it, and its competition, and

996
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,440
how big this can really be.

997
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:30,900
Konami really actually doesn't do much, but this upcoming year, you might see some stuff coming out.

998
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:34,200
Interesting. So I guess other little things you probably can't talk about?

999
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:39,420
Um, I can talk about them. It's just that a lot of the stuff is, um, you know, it works.

1000
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:43,340
You don't want to say anything and then not have it happen?

1001
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:47,160
Um, I'll say what we want to do. I'll say what we're planning.

1002
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:47,720
Cool.

1003
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:55,240
First off, first off, we have a, uh, Sammy and I have a meeting with Ziff Davis Media tomorrow at 11 a.m.

1004
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:59,600
of now they're part of davis media the folks that run g_-four tech tv

1005
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,200
uh... they might be i'm not too sure about you know the whole no contest

1006
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,080
results

1007
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,040
i think but i don't know that

1008
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:09,200
these are the people who put together the actual uh...

1009
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,680
convention last weekend okay

1010
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,760
and they got microsoft an exam in intel

1011
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,020
uh... that's why all of the company's come down and you know

1012
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,400
exhibit the stuff

1013
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,720
so they were so interested in or place

1014
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:27,700
uh... that they want to set up the next year's tournament

1015
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:30,600
with my sponsors and

1016
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,960
and you know like they want all these companies that came to the

1017
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,880
the convention

1018
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,780
to help sponsor us in whatever way possible and we're looking at

1019
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:40,220
a really big

1020
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:42,300
grand prize at the end of it

1021
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:45,920
uh... no real dollar amount

1022
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:50,120
but we're looking at something huge, something enough to get like

1023
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,280
many more people to end up coming out

1024
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,700
correct me if i'm wrong, but this is coming off the heels of a thousand dollar grand prize

1025
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,700
tournament, correct?

1026
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:58,700
Yes.

1027
01:31:58,700 --> 01:31:59,700
And you guys talk about something bigger.

1028
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:00,700
Right.

1029
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,700
Wow.

1030
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,700
Very nice.

1031
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:09,060
So, I mean, the $1,000 is actually put up by Sammy, but if we have people who, you know,

1032
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:12,960
like Microsoft, who want to put up some crazy amount of money, you know, especially when

1033
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:17,500
the swarm is going to end up happening later on next year, that people, you know, by the

1034
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:23,100
time this actually ends up happening, hopefully through all the publicity that we get, people

1035
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,820
people understand that, you know, DDR is out there, it's a big thing, you know, that's

1036
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:31,020
what we're looking to do.

1037
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:36,100
Another meeting I have coming up soon is with Fuse TV, I don't know if you guys get that

1038
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,100
out there.

1039
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,620
Uh, they used to be much music, right?

1040
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,800
Weren't they much music?

1041
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,060
And then they turned into Fuse?

1042
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,380
I think that sounds about right.

1043
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:44,300
I think it's a subscription channel out here.

1044
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,300
Yeah.

1045
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,300
But I've heard of them.

1046
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:51,220
So, we have, I have a producer contact that I actually made, and he absolutely adores

1047
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:52,220
the game.

1048
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:56,380
just found it on Thursday when he showed up and he absolutely adored the game

1049
01:32:56,380 --> 01:33:00,740
when he first saw it so I have a meeting with him in a couple of weeks and we're

1050
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:08,940
gonna pitch an idea both together to fuse about a weekly DDR show a weekly

1051
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:13,180
DDR show weekly not some kind of DDR special you're talking about like a

1052
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:18,460
weekly DDR show right exactly we're looking we're probably looking at like

1053
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:23,460
The only idea was that, so far, that I've had was a weekly tournament, and...

1054
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:28,460
Is this the OMG DDR game show that people have talked about for years?

1055
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:30,460
I've never heard of that, actually, but uh...

1056
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:33,460
I see these threads occasionally on the message board where they're like,

1057
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:37,460
OMG DDR game show type thing, could DDR be a game show?

1058
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:41,460
Maybe it's just that it's a couple years ago and I'm...

1059
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:44,460
I don't know, it just seems like I've seen these kind of ideas going around before

1060
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:47,460
where people are like, OMG, they should have a DDR TV show and stuff,

1061
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,140
show and stuff and now you're saying that

1062
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:52,820
that's exactly what you're going to go pitch in a couple weeks

1063
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:53,980
it's not

1064
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:57,180
it's probably not going to end up being a game show it's going to be

1065
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,040
something like uh...

1066
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:03,900
uh... do you remember i don't even know if you guys had this out here do you guys remember when they

1067
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:07,200
had this thing called the WMCA championships

1068
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,980
it was that martial arts championships they used to

1069
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:13,980
televise NMTV and they had all these characters and they had like the locker room scene

1070
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:15,340
where people get mad at each other

1071
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:21,540
I actually remember this. It was a lot like the WWF except it was karate. I do remember seeing a couple episodes of this.

1072
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,340
He used to be on channel 31, remember?

1073
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:30,140
I believe, probably it wasn't the same channel here, but you know, I think I want to do something similar to that.

1074
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,940
You know, like,

1075
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:36,460
tournaments end up meeting the real world and MTV kind of thing.

1076
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,060
You know, so it gets

1077
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,220
kind of like, so you know the players,

1078
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:43,500
you know, and I'm not gonna like,

1079
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,140
force them with

1080
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:49,060
uh... acting because these are the your players are not all actors right

1081
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:49,700
so like

1082
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:52,740
but we can't we can't like to choose our players either we won't be

1083
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:55,380
one of you know if you take some good players in other words you're not going

1084
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,700
to ham it up like wrestling

1085
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,740
yeah we're not going to work uh... you know we're probably going to show how

1086
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:04,180
people trained and maybe some interviews and maybe some

1087
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:08,340
little cute skits in there but a lot of it's going to be at the uh... in my

1088
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,700
my thing we're going to actually just end up doing like

1089
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,780
a weekly tournament you know like red teamers blue team

1090
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:17,460
you know, try to ham it up for a little while, maybe like a BattleBots kind of thing where

1091
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,020
every like month we end up doing a championship or every few months or something like that,

1092
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:25,380
and they get some kind of crazy trophy that we like, you know, pass around, you know,

1093
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:36,380
but, but uh, but that's, what, heh, why don't you bring that up? Sammy, Sammy actually got

1094
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:41,780
a call last week from someone from Konami who happens to actually end up being the VP.

1095
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:48,780
The VP is very, very interested in sponsoring the tournament in 2005.

1096
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,780
Interesting.

1097
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:56,780
Yes, and considering now that we have this contact here, which is going to be, you know, a huge contact.

1098
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:58,780
This is a huge, huge contact for us.

1099
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:07,780
If we have this contact here, which we obviously do, we can usually get the OK to do a lot of stuff, you know?

1100
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:10,780
And that's what we're going to end up trying to do.

1101
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:14,620
We're gonna try to, you know, push DDR just because of the love of the game.

1102
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:17,180
We're not even getting paid to do this, you know, we're just pushing this game to show

1103
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:22,660
it out, you know, get it out there, and to the public, and we want to see more people

1104
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:26,940
in competition get this thing mainstreamed, and my personal goal is for it to be as big

1105
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:30,380
as the sporting events that are out there, you know, the Yankees and the Red Sox that

1106
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:33,860
were out, you know, last week, everyone was watching that on the East Coast, at least,

1107
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:40,620
I don't know what you guys are doing out there, you know, so, like, I want to have it so DDR

1108
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:45,180
up you know the television maybe ESPN or whatever and everyone knows you know

1109
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:49,940
what a great is and how many how many greats the JSB gets on this song and

1110
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:54,860
everyone knows the stats and knows you know the players you know and roots for

1111
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:58,380
their favorite team like the New York Blue Impulse versus the California Trip

1112
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:01,540
Machines or whatever that's what we're looking that's what we're looking to do

1113
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:04,660
that's a hell of a goal but that's a neat goal

1114
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:07,980
yeah that's that's that's low key look like you want to say something here

1115
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:13,980
That's what we're pushing for, and I want to expect that there's going to be a huge jump in publicity in this next coming year.

1116
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:30,980
It might end up being looking like that, at least for this first year coming, but with a lot of the more context that we're getting,

1117
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:38,220
you know especially Konami it looks like it that there might be more push for it

1118
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:44,540
you know considering it's a new it's a new genre of video game is already a

1119
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:51,380
sport in Norway you know so it's got potential it reminds me though of like

1120
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:56,140
that webcomic that's 10k commotion or whatever it's just like you know with

1121
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:59,940
all the DDR drama and you have the teams competing a giant like tournament thing

1122
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:04,940
It seems a lot like that. Now if that's a bad idea, I think that's a pretty cool idea.

1123
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:12,940
Well, you know, there's drama everywhere. There's drama in celebrities and stuff like that, so it's not going to be, you know, more common.

1124
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:22,940
I'll tell you what, if you ever want to take the DDR drama angle with this show, like Degrassi DDR League or whatever, I could give you pages and pages of real life inspired drama.

1125
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:25,940
I think just about everyone knows that.

1126
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:34,940
You know, getting out of the tournament last week, a lot of the people actually ended up thanking Sammy for putting together the tournament, blah, blah, blah.

1127
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:39,940
And to tell you the truth, Sammy screwed up a lot of things about the tournament.

1128
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:46,940
And there were a lot of things that if he was more prepared, he would have actually ended up doing better work with it.

1129
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:50,940
You know, and I ended up trying to fix a lot of it behind the scenes and things like that

1130
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:53,940
and a lot of people don't even remember me being there, you know.

1131
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:58,940
And it's annoying at one extent and it's not too bad at another

1132
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:01,940
because, you know, I kind of don't want to be attached to the tournament

1133
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:03,940
because of the tournament being actually too bad

1134
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:06,940
and I'm more attached to what happened otherwise.

1135
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:10,940
But, I mean, there was this one incident during Freestyle

1136
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:19,940
where Team Element from upstate New York came in to do the routine, obviously, to the guys.

1137
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:26,940
And what happened was they went up for the first time, and Sammy wasn't ready with the camera.

1138
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:32,940
So Sammy says, wait, wait, wait, and tells one of the other staff members to reset the machine while they're mid-play.

1139
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:36,940
Well, not mid-play, but they actually got into about ten seconds of the routine.

1140
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:42,440
So Sammy goes, oh I didn't know they started already, that wouldn't have been fine, don't worry about it, just start up again.

1141
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:47,440
So they're like okay fine, so they start up again, and the problem here was that they forgot mirror.

1142
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:52,940
And we actually ended up forgetting to put event mode on, but that wouldn't have mattered if they wouldn't have failed.

1143
01:39:52,940 --> 01:40:00,940
So what happened was they ended up actually failing halfway through the song, you know the fail screen comes up because they forgot to put mirror on.

1144
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:01,940
Bummer.

1145
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:05,860
you know so then they go ahead and they're like oh what the fuck you know

1146
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:09,860
we've had it right the first time blah blah and and then we're like okay you

1147
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:12,220
know we'll just go again and we'll figure out something later so they went

1148
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:16,900
again they finished their routine you know and we figured out you know I was

1149
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:20,980
right in the beginning I said they're disqualified and the reason I said that

1150
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:27,660
was because when you do a routine everything about the routine is routine

1151
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:35,660
when you put options on, when you put your clothes on, when you do the routine, everything is routine.

1152
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:40,660
There's no real excuse of not putting an option on.

1153
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:44,660
So you're saying the second they turn the machine over to you, it's routine time?

1154
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:50,660
Right, exactly. Once you have the option of choosing a song, making your options, blah blah blah blah,

1155
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:56,660
it's routine to you, and it's part of the routine that's going to come out in the show to us.

1156
01:40:56,660 --> 01:41:00,180
You know what, I can see why you're coming from that angle though, because a lot of what

1157
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:04,620
you just talked to us about, about this DDR TV show and stuff, you kind of were talking

1158
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:08,380
a little bit about kind of the hype behind it a little bit too.

1159
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:11,780
So I think, and we don't see this enough in freestyle, at least I don't see it enough

1160
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:15,740
out here, but there's not often a lot of build up to these routines.

1161
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:19,340
The routine is only the minute and a half, but yet they'll give you three minutes to

1162
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:23,020
do something, yet people usually just choose to do something for a minute and a half, even

1163
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:25,340
though they could probably have a lot more fun with it.

1164
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:29,340
There's also a lot of the problem that people just aren't prepared for freestyle anymore.

1165
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:32,340
There's no real big pot for freestyle anymore.

1166
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:35,340
You know, everyone wants the expert tech, no one really freestyles,

1167
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:37,340
no one really thinks they're good at freestyle,

1168
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:40,340
people think they're good at freestyle and they really aren't.

1169
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:44,340
You know, it's just like, there's not a lot of people that jump out there,

1170
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:47,340
get the job done, you know, and look awesome doing it.

1171
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:49,340
At least out here I've seen it.

1172
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:56,020
You know, people just, you know, don't put themselves together and make a good routine.

1173
01:41:56,020 --> 01:42:00,340
To tell you the truth, when I did the Sports World Tournament two years back for Drifting

1174
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:06,500
Away, there was a, I actually was planning to do insertion for a month.

1175
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:11,540
I did this routine for about three, three and a half weeks, putting together every step,

1176
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:15,540
every arrow, had a move to it, blah, blah, blah.

1177
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:19,820
And at the end of it all, about three or four days before the competition, I scrapped the

1178
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:20,820
whole thing.

1179
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:26,540
I don't even know why, I think I just got sick of it or whatever, and I ended up drifting

1180
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:27,540
away.

1181
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:34,500
And the day before, I literally slapped together, won the whole tournament, and that was the

1182
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,500
story about that.

1183
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:40,820
Well, you know, the practice of building the other routine, though, probably kind of helped

1184
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:42,460
in making the second routine, right?

1185
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:45,500
Did you end up taking elements of your insertion routine?

1186
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:51,020
Well, I don't know, like, there was more leeway with drifting away.

1187
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:56,940
Drifting away's Trick Little, No Freeze has no arrows for the first half of it, so you'll

1188
01:42:56,940 --> 01:43:01,060
see me get off the pad and do whatever for a while and, you know, like I had more freedom

1189
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:02,060
to do what I wanted.

1190
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:03,700
With insertion, there was a whole lot of arrows.

1191
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:07,740
I just loved the saw insertion, but the problem was there was so many arrows, you know, there

1192
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:11,940
was a lot of stuff to work with and there was a big risk of me failing and, you know,

1193
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:17,780
I don't like the total big risk of failing, you know, at least back when I was actually

1194
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:18,780
competing.

1195
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:23,560
Although I might be competing soon because of the tournament last week.

1196
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:32,260
What happened was Sketch and Visor had a first place routine and it was a phenomenal routine

1197
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:37,540
and they got inspired through a lot of my stuff but I kind of got inspired to go ahead

1198
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:42,260
and beat their routine with something that I'll come out with later, and I have ideas

1199
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:47,460
in my head that are jumping around, and I can't really tell, not because I don't want

1200
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:54,460
to, but because I'm not sure when I'm going to compete. But I want it to be in any place

1201
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:59,460
that we're going to tape it and show it online, unlike the dropout freestyle that's still

1202
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:03,340
sitting on my side and no one knows what it looks like, not even me.

1203
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:15,220
So that's my plans, it's a lot of DDR publicity and I guess some freestyle on a personal note.

1204
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:18,100
Well I know we've been taking up a lot of your time here but I do have one other question

1205
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:21,780
I want to ask you because it has to do with something that the caller last week had brought

1206
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:26,980
up about hearing something about, and I don't know if you can confirm or deny this, but

1207
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:33,140
he had said something about DDR maybe going out on tour with a rap artist.

1208
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,060
this uh...

1209
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:36,180
you know the crowd what it was

1210
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:39,440
well actually before we go to that i'll tell you one thing that's uh... on

1211
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,820
thursday's bike to you the came up to us

1212
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:45,380
said it would be over she brought to the world

1213
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:48,340
yeah because you have a few records of that's what we call the rules

1214
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:50,300
well obviously

1215
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:52,620
and they're going to help because we have this

1216
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:53,500
video game

1217
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:59,140
uh...

1218
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:00,260
award show

1219
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:01,060
that happened

1220
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:02,060
California.

1221
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,060
That's right.

1222
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,060
Right.

1223
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:07,180
We talked about this on one of our other shows, the Spike Lee's first annual show.

1224
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:08,180
Yeah.

1225
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:09,180
Right.

1226
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,180
They want the DVR machine at the after party.

1227
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,180
Oh, okay.

1228
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,180
Yeah.

1229
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:16,100
So, but the problem is it's kind of out of the range and, you know, because obviously

1230
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:20,820
that's the West Coast and the East Coast, and it's a very long haul for that DVR machine.

1231
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:21,820
Right.

1232
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:25,940
You know, on Sammy's own, because Sammy only has like a coverage range, and then outside

1233
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:32,340
coverage ranges a lot of uh a lot of um you know money involved to try to get it out of that

1234
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:38,660
absolutely but on to the rap artist so basically what happened was we were in the middle of the

1235
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:45,460
tournament saturday ludicrous and the family label uh were there and someone noticed it

1236
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:48,580
like obviously because it was actually probably on the other side of the screen

1237
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:52,660
that like ludicrous is probably on the other side of the curtain from where we were

1238
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:58,100
And I actually ended up seeing him, but someone, a representative from their production label,

1239
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:01,060
came up specifically to me, because I looked like I knew what I was doing.

1240
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:09,140
And they're like, and they asked me, is this, you know, for rent, or is there even a possibility

1241
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:16,180
of taking a machine on tour? And, you know, I was like, wow, you know, you want to have this

1242
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:21,540
thing on tour? That's pretty cool. You know, you can talk to Sammy, you know, so the person from

1243
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:29,540
Ludacris production label is asking for the DDR Machine to be on tour with them sometime next spring or summer.

1244
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:37,540
Interesting. Now what I'd be curious about though, is it on tour, because you know how sometimes the big celebrities with their rock and roll lifestyle, or in this case rap lifestyle,

1245
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:45,540
they've got all the stuff that they have in their trailer and stuff. Is this DDR Machine for him to be using in his posse, or is it something he wants to have out there?

1246
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:51,540
I have no idea what he wants to do with it. It's just the fact, you know, it's just kind of funny that he wants it, you know.

1247
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:58,540
That's the thing that, like, you know, jumps on it. I mean, Sammy has that contact information. I don't know what they're doing with that.

1248
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:04,540
Yeah, because when I think about famous pairs, I don't really envision Ludacris and DDR, but whatever floats your boat.

1249
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:08,540
You know what? You're going to see a lot of stupid stuff soon, I'm going to tell you right now.

1250
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:11,980
is gonna be people in the sporting industry playing DDR

1251
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:15,300
I'm positive it's just gonna happen once it gets big

1252
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:18,500
good we need more stuff to make fun of here on our little program so

1253
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:22,260
bring on all the silly stuff. Oh yeah there will be plenty of silly stuff coming

1254
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:26,460
I'm sure of it. But like I said

1255
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:29,620
people will know once the show

1256
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:33,420
if it actually ends up happening with the weekly show people will know we'll both be on

1257
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:35,900
DDR Freak and be Mani styled because I obviously am

1258
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:42,180
both affiliated with both sites, so you will find out through both of those sites that

1259
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:48,340
something will be going down at any point in time, whether it be the 2005 huge tournament

1260
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:54,860
or the DDR show or Ludacris getting the machine for a tour or whatever, you're going to find

1261
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:59,700
out one way or another through those sites.

1262
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:03,580
And as we have in the past, we will go ahead and steal the news and post it on our own

1263
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:06,540
site and post a link back to the site. We stole it from them.

1264
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:10,980
Of course. They can always check Orangelaunch.com too. Orangelaunchradio.com because we always

1265
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:15,940
put that information up as well. But definitely a lot of very interesting stuff it sounds

1266
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:21,660
like you've got coming up in the future. Yeah, I'll expect something good is going to happen

1267
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:30,660
next year. You know, and there's even talk, I don't even know if I want to say this, people

1268
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:37,660
probably come out of the seats. Because of the media that we've received and this call

1269
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:44,160
from Hinabi that we also got, this big uproar that actually happened in only a week or so,

1270
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,540
we have the possibility of requesting a new arcade mix.

1271
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:51,660
I'm jumping out of my seat!

1272
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,660
Yeah, right.

1273
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:53,660
No, we're okay.

1274
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:57,780
The people are now like, the people are down there like, wait a minute, wait, what did

1275
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:59,100
he just say? New arcade mix?

1276
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:00,100
Honestly?

1277
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:10,420
Here's the thing, it's not definite, it's not something that's like, wow, okay, we're

1278
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:17,220
really doing this, it's a possibility because America's now finding out about DDR and it's

1279
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:25,980
a real big thing now that after this convention that happened, the public's like, wow, DDR?

1280
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:29,780
Oh wow, this is an amazing game, oh wow, let's put this thing on TV, and then we're gonna

1281
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:35,060
to push it, push it, push it. And they're going to be bootleg illegal mixes. Yeah, right?

1282
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:39,220
Well, you know, like, because Konami is going to notice this, obviously, because they called

1283
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:44,900
us, they're going to, you know, we hope they're going to help us out and show us, here, look,

1284
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:50,700
we got a new arcade mix for you, you know, how does that sound? Interesting. So, no,

1285
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:54,900
like, that's a side goal. Loki is convinced it's not going to happen. What's that? Loki

1286
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:59,420
is convinced over here it's not gonna happen well you know what prove them

1287
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:03,780
wrong what some of us whether you know that were like gave up on thinking that

1288
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:06,820
another one was gonna come out and some of us are like you know what you know I

1289
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:09,820
hope there's something else that comes out and then there's obviously people

1290
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:15,420
out there oh they're like still steadfast and know like I know stream 2

1291
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:20,660
is coming I know it's coming you know so we're we're me and Sammy because of the

1292
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:25,400
levels of the game want you know to push for the new arcade mix to come out

1293
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:30,740
because you know like the USA stuff is kind of like you know like sleepy and

1294
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:35,380
put together badly and well you know Spell of Marvelous is with two L's and

1295
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:39,540
you know things like that so like we want to see a new arcade mix put

1296
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:44,860
together and even you know if it ends up being like a home version you know like

1297
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:51,860
6-6 was. You know, still something else that's not in the group.

1298
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:59,860
Definitely. Here's my advice to you though. If Konami is going to do it, make sure Hawaii

1299
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,860
is involved. Because if the...

1300
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:02,360
Hawaii?

1301
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:04,860
If Konami Hawaii, the folks did Ultramix 2.

1302
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:05,860
Oh my god no.

1303
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:08,860
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me, you're not a fan of Ultramix 2?

1304
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:13,860
Let me tell you right now. When Ultramix 1 came out, I thought it was

1305
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,220
all four of us

1306
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:18,180
i thought what i could buy to go ahead and

1307
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,220
put together

1308
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:20,900
uh... you know

1309
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:24,240
a mix from hawaii that ended up the people

1310
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:27,420
like looking at like what he said he go with the things speed up to two hundred

1311
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:28,340
eighteen

1312
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:30,580
bpm property and no reason

1313
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:32,780
and how i'll give you know

1314
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:36,560
you have all these songs in here

1315
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,440
quickening is a six-foot how do you do that

1316
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:42,340
how do you put steps quickly at the six-foot

1317
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:45,420
I'll give you that. I'll give you that. You've got a good point.

1318
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:46,700
Here's the other...

1319
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:50,200
How do you do that? So with Ultra-Mix 2 coming out,

1320
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,940
you know, and what was it?

1321
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,980
What's on there? Is Maximizer on there?

1322
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:56,500
Is that what's on there? No, that's on DDR Extreme.

1323
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:59,040
So I was going to say, here's the other half of that.

1324
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,940
Okay, now if KOJ does it, then you're going to have Marvelous with two Ls, and you're going to have

1325
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,600
Karaoke Revolution crossovers.

1326
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,500
So it's kind of like, damn it if you do damn things now.

1327
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:10,880
It's just that they need to be aware of what,

1328
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,260
you know the people who want to gain

1329
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:16,660
you know i understand that the trying to get a little

1330
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:19,380
uh... group of people who play care of

1331
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:23,060
you know if they do and you know that that the lawyers like that or

1332
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:25,780
you know the try to get it all up a different people

1333
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,780
putting u s or there like move your feet

1334
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:32,960
uh... you know uh... i think about is uh...

1335
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,520
you know if i get you know

1336
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:37,920
uefense uefexes budget

1337
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:44,520
It's not up to that, it's up to, you know, good songs like in the arcade extreme and

1338
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:52,400
good step charts and things like that that, you know, push for people to play that are

1339
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:55,800
real hardcore players and people that aren't even hardcore players that are even actually

1340
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,800
into playing.

1341
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:01,240
I mean, the regular public doesn't understand that this mix, you know, has faults to it.

1342
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,240
Right.

1343
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:03,240
That's very true.

1344
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:05,240
They just play the game, they see arrows and, you know, obviously once they get into it

1345
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:09,400
they'll realize but you know and that's all they want to really go for if they

1346
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:13,600
actually end up putting getting the shit together you know then this is actually

1347
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:17,040
in the you know could be ending up being good you know and if we have some kind

1348
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,320
of affiliation with Konami you know I mean if I have an affiliation with

1349
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:25,480
Konami at any point in time where I could say what we should put on a mix

1350
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:31,280
mm-hmm I promise you you will not be disappointed very good but you know I

1351
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,080

because i actually i was on the east coast not that long ago and i got to go

1366
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:05,020
to it on the break

1367
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:06,560
and i have to check it out

1368
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,660
and i'd like to sum it up in one word

1369
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:10,040
interesting

1370
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,740
interesting that's good that's good

1371
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,440
interesting is definitely a good word for it

1372
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:17,000
but uh... yeah

1373
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,760
to tell you the truth

1374
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:21,020
i know i'm not in all these big forms and everything

1375
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:23,180
but if you see me on

1376
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:27,720
itgfreak.com you'll see me flaming everyone

1377
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:31,080
all i do is play by actually i think it is registered to point group

1378
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:34,620
neti now you're just adding back into the studio drama the drama thing you're

1379
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:36,580
talking about earlier across the whole of it

1380
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,560
you know that's all i do because you know what

1381
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,760
they really didn't care

1382
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,640
i'd like

1383
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:42,800
i'd like to know more

1384
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:44,280
out they didn't care or

1385
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,940
or the people out there that they're like all i can make arrows and

1386
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:52,040
you know put out the song and no one cares what they look like it

1387
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:57,120
you know it's it's really frustrating to look at that and have this be put out to

1388
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:01,020
you know, arcades and have people play it, you know, or at least attempt to play it.

1389
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:06,660
I mean, once it first came out, it just, it didn't have a lot of, it had a lot of like,

1390
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:10,620
wow, another, you know, dancing game, but now no one's playing it anymore over here

1391
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:11,620
at least.

1392
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,620
Interesting.

1393
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:14,660
Well, we'll get more of your thoughts on In the Groove a little later.

1394
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:17,000
We've taken up like over a half hour of your time.

Bye.

1408
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,120
Wow.

1409
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:38,120
Lots of interesting stuff in that interview.

1410
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,120
Mm-hmm.

1411
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:40,120
Lots and lots of interesting stuff.

1412
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:43,160
I didn't realize what the hell they're cooking up over there on the East Coast.

1413
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:45,640
Don't we feel out of the loop now over here on the West?

1414
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,160
That's very interesting.

1415
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,160
So what...

1416
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:50,800
Guy, how can we sum up that whole thing for people that joined us halfway through that

1417
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:51,800
interview there?

1418
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:57,680
talking about the past half hour there, but DDR going on tour with Ludacris next spring,

1419
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:02,760
we don't know to what extent, what did he say, he's talking to Fuse TV about some type

1420
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:10,600
of DDR show that right now could, could not be pitched with a WWE-ish element, or actually

1421
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:13,120
I wasn't using the analogy, what did he say, the karate show.

1422
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:14,440
The ultimate fighting championship?

1423
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:18,720
Yeah, the fighting championship, but he was saying maybe like a BattleBots type of thing,

1424
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:22,120
it's like a tournament very interesting to see what happens with that lots of

1425
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:26,800
producer contacts apparently at that DDR could be showing up a lot in the media

1426
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:31,920
in the next few months and it won't be about weight loss and that's great and

1427
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:36,120
the more exposure the DDR gets in the media the more material we have to make

1428
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,680
fun of here on this show so we're definitely looking forward to it and

1429
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:42,080
then of course at the end there he's talking about if this gets big enough

1430
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:46,580
don't wet your pants but maybe a new arcade mix but that's way way off in the

1431
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:50,660
business don't get excited just yet but honestly dreaming about new arcade mixes

1432
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:54,220
is sometimes what keeps shows like this going because if we knew the game was

1433
01:56:54,220 --> 01:57:05,980
dead would we be here right now it's already feel like it to that point you

1434
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:13,580
know that show sounds like it needs like wacky very informative commentators on

1435
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:20,580
Some people with, like, radio experience and some DDR experience and just, you know,

1436
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,580
someone that's been in the community for a while.

1437
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:27,580
Hmm, who could that be?

1438
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:31,580
We're trying to whore yourself out to everybody, Loki. Seriously.

1439
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:33,580
All right, damn, you know what, I need a break.

1440
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:37,580
Thanks to frequency for spending, that was like, looking at the little timer going on,

1441
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:39,580
that was over 30 minutes of chat.

1442
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:41,580
Yeah, I think a break is a good call.

1443
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:44,500
have a good call yeah Jamie appreciates it too because she's got a lot of work

1444

1449
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:13,400
I want some 2DX songs. I want to do a couple 2DX songs.

1450
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:17,400
We'll start it off with one of my... Let's do one we haven't heard in a while here.

1451
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:21,400
I'm going to do one from 2DX Fist Style. I'm going to do the Cube first.

1452
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:25,400
Then we'll do Get On Beat. I'll try to get that in there too. And we'll be back in a little bit.

1453
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:29,400
We're going to do the FUs of the Week. We're going to let you know who won the Cage match.

1454
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:32,400
And who knows what else when we come back.

1455
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,400

1468
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:48,200
...

1469
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:52,200
...

1470
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:56,200
...

1471
02:02:56,200 --> 02:03:00,200
...

1472
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:04,200
...

1473
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:09,840
I will remember you

1474
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:25,000
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join

1475
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,920
us on all the fun together.

1476
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:30,660
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

1477
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:34,120
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

1478
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:36,560
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1479
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:41,280
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1480
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:44,440
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We gotta get Mel back on the show at some point.

1481
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:47,360
You know, he was gonna be here a couple weeks ago, but something came up, so...

1482
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:49,160
We gotta get him back on the show.

1483
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,760
We gotta get all our favorites back on the show.

1484
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:56,840
We'll have our people go get him. Yeah, we'll have our people talk to their people, et cetera, et cetera.

1485
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:00,000
So there's some other news going out there in the music and rhythm game world.

1486
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,360
We've just spent the past half hour edition on DDR, but there are other games going on out there.

1487
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:07,900
one thing i wanted to talk about tyco drum master actually we've kind of

1488
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,760
mentioned this couple

1489
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:11,460
couple times in the past few weeks

1490
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:14,960
tyco drum masters gonna have its release on tuesday we're hearing angel you've

1491
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:18,840
been kind of read about this what are you planning on picking this game up or

1492
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:22,120
yep i'm in i'm gonna try to get up

1493
02:07:22,120 --> 02:07:26,160
uh... one of the sites they usually frequent to buy games says that

1494
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:28,760
the list of prices sixty nine ninety nine

1495
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:30,560
and uh...

1496
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,920
for peace to obviously there's no that

1497
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,000
uh...

1498
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,820
however it doesn't state that uh... there's going to be a controller

1499
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:38,720
included like they did with uh...

1500
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:40,160
donkey conga

1501
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:41,200
for the game

1502
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:43,780
for sixty nine ninety nine a damn well better be

1503
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:45,740
i hope so yeah

1504
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:46,980
it should be one

1505
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:48,980
obviously so um...

1506
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:52,020
forty nine ninety nine is the most i've ever heard them charging for video game

1507
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:55,580
and that's for top shelf games like grand theft auto san andreas things like

1508
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:56,620
that

1509
02:07:56,620 --> 02:08:00,060
and write but rob you remember how much i played for uh...

1510
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:02,820
uh... somebody let me go back in the day

1511
02:08:02,820 --> 02:08:06,060
paid eighty bucks for the U.S. controller and

1512
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:07,980
what was the game fifty bucks

1513
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:09,660
for the game

1514
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:10,660
back in the day

1515
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:14,140
I think the only game I've seen more expensive to import was Para Para back

1516
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:15,440
when it was at its height

1517
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:19,500
when it was at its peak. Now it's pretty... My DDR2 mix on Dreamcast when Dan bought it for me

1518
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,980
the game was uh...

1519
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,480
seventy five bucks

1520
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:26,380
and he spent eighty bucks on my dance pad

1521
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:27,500
DAMN!

1522
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:29,540
and I

1523
02:08:29,540 --> 02:08:33,760
sort of uh... acquired somebody else's dance pad

1524
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:35,940
uh... now if Namco's smart

1525
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:37,340
they've got one

1526
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:40,940
they've got one song in taiko drum master they can be riding the wave of

1527
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:46,940
success off of one of their other games right now

1528
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:50,400
Katamari Damacy, the Katamari on the rocks theme

1529
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,700
is in taiko drum master so who knows

1530
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:55,720
see now that little green guy, I bet you anything that little green guy is going to become a

1531
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,900
little uh...

1532
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:59,340
spokesman for Namco

1533
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:01,700
No, they're almost going to have Pac-Man.

1534
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:04,620
Well, yeah, of course. They've got their staple. The Namco's a pretty good company.

1535
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:06,180
The little OG.

1536
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:10,960
They're allowed to have more than one mascot, just like Nintendo's got Mario and

1537
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,240
Link,

1538
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,900
Luigi, and who the hell else they have? They've got a ton of people.

1539
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:18,320
Not Mario, Wario!

1540
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:23,060
You finally got a chance to get your own copy of Katamari Damacy this week, right?

1541
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:28,060
Yeah. Yeah. So, were you playing it at all, or you said you were watching?

1542
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:33,060
I was playing it some, I played like at 3am, I was like, okay these mushrooms are tripping me out, I'm going to bed.

1543
02:09:58,060 --> 02:10:08,620
I don't know. Nope. I'm sorry, but, you know, it is human nature to love smashing things

1544
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:14,940
with a ball. Rolling over stuff has been with us ever since the automobile. Since the automobile

1545
02:10:14,940 --> 02:10:20,180
can smash objects, like small squirrels and stuff, it's been our desire to find those

1546
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:24,700
small objects to roll over. And the fact that the ball is sticky and holds more objects

1547
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:32,380
to make an even larger ball that's even better that was beautiful I think I like

1548
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:41,740
running over buildings and picking up cows and the stupid dog that keeps

1549
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:46,460
trying to run into you okay I was in this one part where this dog kept like

1550
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:53,760
trying to butt into me so I ran over the dog later on and that was gratifying now

1551
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:57,120
Now see in our chat room, here we go, we have one that says, I'm sick of it already.

1552
02:10:57,120 --> 02:10:59,240
This is like Super Monkey Ball!

1553
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:00,240
Come on!

1554
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:01,600
Now see, Super Monkey Ball I never got into.

1555
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:03,160
Monkey Ball is cool.

1556
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:05,560
It's cute and all, but I never got into it.

1557
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:07,120
It's like the Parappa for this generation.

1558
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:08,960
Generation, what am I saying?

1559
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:09,960
This year, you know?

1560
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:15,120
Because you know how Parappa hit and then kind of flew over, we're going to have like,

1561
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:17,840
you know, Katamari Damacy 2 is coming out, and then there's going to be like, I think

1562
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:18,840
a theme.

1563
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:24,600
There should be like, like Katamari Party.

1564
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:27,280
Mario Party, just with the little prince.

1565
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:33,640
Uh, I was gonna say that, uh, the game's got its little cult following now, so it's kinda funny, but, um,

1566
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:39,400
I was gonna mention that VGCatch jumped on, jumped on it as soon as it got, you know, the game got released.

1567
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:47,360
Uh, for those of you that don't know what VGCatch is, it took them quite a while, actually, to get on it.

1568
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:53,360
Anyway, I was gonna say, VGCatch is a, like, online comic for video games and stuff. Anyway, yeah.

1569
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:59,360
Interesting. Alright, uh, okay, let's get back on topic to talking about rhythm and music games here.

1570
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:02,360
Loki had some things he wanted to talk about with you guys, some news that's going on.

1571
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:08,360
Now you, I guess there's some remix contests going on that just finished up. What happened with remixing?

1572
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:18,360
Both DDR, it's like DDR Remix, which is just DDR Maniac's contest, which didn't have quite a turn out as.

1573
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:22,360
But my sales remix contest 1.5 or whatever that was.

1574
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:26,360
But anyways, there was some pretty cool stuff that came out of those.

1575
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:34,360
First I'll talk about the DDR Maniacs 1, the remix competition, because it's actually not done.

1576
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:46,360
They're not done. They're in voting right now, but they have the songs that were out there, so I'm going to play a few of these here. Actually, let me adjust my volume here.

1577
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:56,360
There was actually only four people that entered this, which is kind of a little sad, a little, a little sad.

1578
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:05,360
There was two by, you know, you might recognize DJ Potato. I'm trying to find these here. What do I have?

1579
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:14,360
Didn't we have DJ Potato on the show a while back? Oh no, I know what it was. His interview with Thomas Howard. Didn't we air some of that a while back?

1580
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:19,940
a while back. Yeah, okay, yeah, sure we know who Digipotato is. Okay, so we had, we had

1581
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:25,320
some of those. I'm trying to think, let me look this up real quick. There was only five

1582
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:32,040
entries. Two of them were his. They were actually, and I can play them for you guys, it was actually

1583
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:37,400
some work that he did, sort of, kind of, with the Bemani Rock album, but not, it's just

1584
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:47,120
piano and saxophone sort of remixes of, what the hell? What the hell was that? Yeah, give

1585
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:54,040
us a little clip of one of these songs here. Okay, well let's see here. We'll start off

1586
02:13:54,040 --> 02:14:02,680
with, let's see how these are old. Oh, I know, I know. Okay, we're going to start off with

1587
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:10,440
they had one of kind lady he actually a few of these he has like d2r 1998 kind

1588
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:15,560
lady there was another one too I can't remember what it was off hand but um

1589
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:26,720
anyways let's see here okay this one right here is gonna be they're like DJ

1590
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:36,100
a potato, a piano, a concentrato. Or is that? What? Shut up. Okay. I don't need your fancy

1591
02:14:36,100 --> 02:14:43,240
English, English talk, okay? Shut up. It's Italian. Whatever. European. We do not formally

1592
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:48,340
recognize the European nations, okay? I just want you to know that. They do not exist to

1593
02:14:48,340 --> 02:14:53,340
me. And you're psychotic with your English. Can I show you, I believe I think it's Italy

1594
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:58,020
right now is number three in our list of nations who's listening to this program when I was

1595
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:04,020
last looking at the geo-rankings. Watch your dirty little mouth, Loki. Whatever. Anyways,

1596
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:09,300
I was reading that quick, okay? I'm under pressure here. Anyway, this is DJ Potato featuring

1597
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:16,300
Tony Miller, which I believe he's on sax.

1598
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:47,300
I like it. Keep in mind, I played saxophone for like twelve years.

1599
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:52,300
You're listening to KOLR Smooth Jazz.

1600
02:15:52,300 --> 02:16:19,300
So that was that. Anyways, so, um, anyways, yeah, that was a few of the, that was one of the songs that was in there. There were some other remixes, but not a lot. Um, however, the Bomani style remix competition was a little different. There was quite a bit there. Um, I saved some of these really kickass ones on here, cause there was a few that were like, and even the judges said, what the hell is this? But, you know, there's always gonna be something like that.

1601
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:36,300
So, um, some of the ones I like to point out which were pretty cool, um, let's see here, um, some of them you've heard before on this show, uh, Clunk Clunk 2004, now that was, um, D.M. Ashura, and that was pretty sweet.

1602
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:56,300
Anyways, that one. And then we've got my personal favorite, Dazed and Destroyed. I loved this one before when there was only a clip of the song, but that's the whole thing.

1603
02:16:56,300 --> 02:17:04,300
The second half is kinda, eh, it's okay, but I mean, it's pretty well done for, it's a remake of Hysteria, so pretty sweet.

1604
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:32,020
It's a really cool song, trust me on that.

1605
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:35,020
and he's making Bitter Beer Face.

1606
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:42,020
It's different. It's different, and it's well produced.

1607
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:47,020
Well produced, maybe, but it sure isn't even a challenge. I'm worried.

1608
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:27,820
They sort of had an R&B version of Rainbow Flyer.

1609
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:37,820
Rainbow Flyer, the polychromatic allogum mix, let's see here, we've also got, but the winner,

1610
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:44,820
The winner of it all was Sextantbike with V1.

1611
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:06,420
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same contest you were complaining about

1612
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:11,960
out because they wouldn't allow fusion mixes and what won the damn contest now

1613
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:15,760
this was it's a little different now it's just they didn't want people just

1614
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:21,660
using acid to throw two songs on top of each other however there were some songs

1615
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:26,400
in there that were two songs thrown on top of each other how that got in is

1616
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:30,780
beyond me because I specifically remembered in the rules that that's why

1617
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:36,280
I didn't enter. But whatever. I don't care. Contest is over. It's a little late.

1618
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:44,280
But anyways, so yeah, that was that. Um, you can find all these songs under the, um, music production forum on Bamai Style.

1619
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:49,280
There's a whole list of songs you can listen to, good and bad, and they're all on there. Pretty cool.

1620
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:53,780
Um, one of the other songs that came out this week also was a remix of Vandy Angel by D'Amatura,

1621
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:56,780
because he can do no wrong, it seems like, with these.

1622
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:59,780
So anyways, I thought I'd play a little bit of that, because that's pretty sweet also.

1623
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:14,780
But, yeah, it's just, you know, a cool, like, long, trans universe, and it's just a trans song, so.

1624
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:20,780
But anyways, that was out. You can also find that in the Music Production Forum.

1625
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:25,780
Or you could listen to Monday Nights Diversion, the Orange Songs Radio Remake Show,

1626
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:32,780
because we'll definitely be adding some of these songs into our rotation there on Monday Nights from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

1627
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:38,780
Now, and the other thing I wanted to mention, and we mentioned this way back in the show a while ago,

1628
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:44,780
about, what was it, it was DJ Potato's Bomani Rock album that was going to be coming out.

1629
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:50,900
me coming out. I have a few full tracks, actually, from that. So, there's a few I'd like to just

1630
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:57,300
preview real quick, and we'll also be throwing those in to rotation as well. Max 300.

1631
02:20:57,300 --> 02:21:24,780
Alright, alright, alright, it's well done, don't get me wrong, but no more max.

1632
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:29,340
I need it! No more!

1633
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:32,340
The damn song keeps breeding, it's worse than Tribbles.

1634
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:39,340
This one is the one I like, Fear Train.

1635
02:21:39,340 --> 02:21:58,960
This one is a little harder to find, I believe this was in the 2DX form, there's like a sample

1636
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:03,660
thing from the Bomani Rock album, you can find that also on Bomani style.

1637
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:07,280
And that's pretty much all that's like music news.

1638
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:16,280
Now, there's a little other thing I read because we're talking about, you know, new arcade mixes and the set mania machine and in the groove and all that kind of stuff that kind of coincides with this.

1639
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:29,280
Now, for those who frequent the DDRUK.com site, you'll know that they created a set mania machine called DDX or Dance Dance X or whatever it is.

1640
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:40,640
Um, it's basically a StepMania arcade, um, game that they scanned. It looks really nice, and it was being played in a Namco, um, I think it was like a Namco cyberstation somewhere in England.

1641
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:44,280
And anyways, um, that's getting pulled out of there.

1642
02:22:44,280 --> 02:23:12,760
Um, because- not because of like, you know, licensing issues and stuff, but it felt the same fate that the, um, Golf Land machine was, and that is, it's not being fixed by them, and it's just falling apart, and damaged, and so, it's- no, just, everyone out there know that problems with little kids trashing shit, it's worldwide. So, you know, there are bad parents everywhere.

1643
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:22,680
Oh, and you told me that it happened during break. I was hoping it was going to be a legal issue story, so we could have a little fun with that, but you're just saying some fucking punks ruined the machine.

1644
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:23,980
That's it.

1645
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:25,440
That is it. Sorry.

1646
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:31,280
How boring! I wanted somebody to get sued! That would have been exciting.

1647
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,980
So no plans to bring it back?

1648
02:23:32,980 --> 02:23:35,380
They're just going to let it rot?

1649
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:43,580
Unfortunately, because what it was is, it was some guy's machine that he actually had brought there and let him, you know, use it and they would pay him some money.

1650
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:48,680
Well, they didn't pay him any money, and they trashed the machine, so he's getting pissed.

1651
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:56,080
But anyways, we will get a lawsuit story out of this after all! Hooray!

1652
02:23:56,080 --> 02:24:02,180
Anyways, the other thing I wanted to talk about was, there was a bootleg that came out a few weeks ago, Dance Dance King.

1653
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:12,780
It looked like a really crappy bootleg machine from China that featured gold colored pads and stuff,

1654
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:19,520
and had, um, what else? Oh, and it's basically a second, er, second mix, um, consumer style

1655
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:27,400
machine that was running from, um, a PlayStation. Literally, a PS1 was inside this cabinet.

1656
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:32,840
And that was quite interesting. I happened to contact these people. They want to, now,

1657
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:40,720
it wasn't their idea, they say, to, you know, bring this, um, you know, bootleg over here,

1658
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:45,240
But the guy wants to make a legitimate mix that was kind of interesting. I thought

1659
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,920
Good luck

1660
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:52,880
So yeah, that's all the

1661
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:55,960
Miscellaneous baumannii stuff has been going on this week

1662
02:24:56,960 --> 02:25:01,680
Next week. I have no idea. What's gonna be going on because I'll be playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

1663
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:05,600
So Lester's baumannii in San Andreas

1664
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:08,600
I have no idea what's going on.

1665
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:10,600
Fair enough, because we're not having a show next Sunday, remember?

1666
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:13,600
It's Halloween, and we're giving all the people a night off so you can go trick-or-treating.

1667
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:16,600
We will have a marathon of old Orange Honest Radio episodes, though.

1668
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:20,600
A very scary Orange Honest Radio marathon for you guys next Sunday.

1669
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:21,600
I don't know how long that's going to run.

1670
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:25,600
Stay tuned to the website for details and when your show's there.

1671
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,600
You know, Nelly almost got me the bi-karaoke revolution, too.

1672
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:30,600
Then my wits came about me and I said,

1673
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:38,880
me I said fuck no I am NOT playing that game fair enough actually I want to ask

1674
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:42,040
you about this right chance at me a private message is she linked me to this

1675
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:45,600
thread over on freak that's showing this I don't know if you've seen this but it

1676
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:52,720
is a step mania computer put inside an 80s era ghetto blaster and they've got

1677
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:57,460
the step mania logo painted over the speakers and this is actually computer

1678
02:25:57,460 --> 02:26:00,360
it looks like a boombox in the front but look at the side that's a little

1679
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:03,360
You see this, Jamie? Look at that. Old school.

1680
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:06,360
That makes me think of the Nintendo computer.

1681
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:09,360
You remember when they were building a Nintendo out of laptop parts?

1682
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:12,360
I'm sorry, building a computer out of a Nintendo shell and laptop parts.

1683
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:15,360
Yeah, it's the nice case mod.

1684
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:18,360
I thought of doing one like that, but putting it in Dreamcast.

1685
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:23,360
I still want one built out of a tool kit. A tool watch.

1686
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:25,360
Is that kind of thing hard to do?

1687
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:31,180
do? When it comes to technical stuff, I don't know shit. I know how to put a radio station

1688
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:35,680
on the internet, but that's about it. So, Loki, tell me about, is this hard to do?

1689
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:41,140
Not if you have a Dremel tool. It's pretty much, even since that boombox was so big that

1690
02:26:41,140 --> 02:26:47,060
they probably wouldn't even need to get a micro-ITX board. The micro-ITX ones that they

1691
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:53,900
have now are really small. They're only, I think the specifications for that are 15,

1692
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:57,660
I want to say, I think it's 17 centimeters by 17 centimeters.

1693
02:26:57,660 --> 02:27:03,140
And looking at that, it looks like that is a micro ITX board in there.

1694
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:09,380
Yeah, so it's a micro ITX board, looks like a hard drive, power supply and everything.

1695
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:15,820
Looks like they've got the, it looks like they had a P4 version that was in there.

1696
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:17,880
I don't really know if that's the thing.

1697
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:21,960
They might have just added a fan to that just so it's cooled off a little bit more.

1698
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:25,820
I don't know. It's hard to tell by the picture. It looks like it could be a regular-sized

1699
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:30,080
motherboard, but I'm thinking it's probably a micro-ITX.

1700
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:33,100
I like how they have the hard drive on top. That's very interesting. The hard drive's

1701
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:35,900
like separate from everything else. It's kind of interesting. I don't know if that's just

1702
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:41,920
the way they open it up or what. But look at this. It says it also includes a sound-sensitive

1703
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:49,940
blue LED rod that kind of goes with the beat. But those little things go a long way in ghetto

1704
02:27:49,940 --> 02:27:56,420
fabulousness don't they don't you think it's awesome I still wanted to do I

1705
02:27:56,420 --> 02:28:01,220
wanted to make like a mini portable console system for like you know step

1706
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:06,580
mania emulation games and just like a not really like almost like a laptop but

1707
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:12,740
not huh I'm never gonna do that though because I start too many projects all

1708
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:15,620
right well we're gonna go to a break when we come back from this break we got

an hour ago that we had the cage match. Tonight's winner of the orange launch radio cage match

1712
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:36,500

1713
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:45,660
mean he wins it. So too bad. I'm glad I haven't won that in at least a while. So at least

1714
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:51,300
a month I know that much so cool well we'll be hearing that one again next

when we come back we're gonna do the F use of the week in this break well I

1719
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:11,420
figured we did some DDR some 2dx how about some popin music specifically I

1720
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:17,900
I dug through my Papa Music 9 folder for some songs, and we're gonna kick it off with Ryu

1721
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:24,980

1722
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:27,980
Ryu, I'm white. Forgive me. We'll be back.

1723
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:56,980
That's not easy

1724
02:30:58,980 --> 02:31:00,980
That's not easy

1725
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:02,980
That's not easy

Even if you don't believe in me, you're gonna find me in no other place

1734
02:32:58,940 --> 02:33:04,980
Are you always in love?

1735
02:33:58,940 --> 02:34:00,940
I

1736
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:40,220
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1737
02:35:40,220 --> 02:35:44,140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1738
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:50,900
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1739
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:56,000
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and believe it or not we're coming into the home

1740
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:03,000
stretch of the show, but no show would be complete without a little bit of angst.

1741
02:36:04,340 --> 02:36:09,000
And that means it's time for the FUs of the week. Jamie, why do we have to do these FUs

1742
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
of the week every single week?

1743
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:18,000
because we're full of angst.

1744
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:31,680
First F.U. goes to my laundry

1745
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:37,320
for not being dry yet until damp.

1746
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:40,560
Another F.U. goes toward being exhausted, drained,

1747
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:50,280
worn out, you name it. F.U. to stress. Big F.U. to stress. F.U. to people in minivans

1748
02:36:50,280 --> 02:37:04,560
who drive 30 in a 50 mile an hour zone. And just stupidity. And uh, distance, time, money.

1749
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:11,560
I don't really have anything specific.

1750
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:18,560
Alright, then we'll move on to Loki.

1751
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:20,560
Um...

1752
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:26,680
First off, you know, it's, like, every week, you know, fucking the drivers, cause,

1753
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:37,680
God, they're so awful and fulsome. I just don't know what it is. They just don't pay attention to any of the stop signs, lights, road signs, nothing. They just... stupid.

1754
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:45,680
So, fuck you then. Um, fuck you to my car, because the engine light came on the other day, and I don't know why.

1755
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:54,680
Well, actually, I do know why, because it was out of coolant, but I fixed that, and I hope it doesn't break down, because, you know, I need good karma around my car.

1756
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:59,180
I don't want to have to, like, have it break. That would suck.

1757
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:07,180
Um, then on more personal notes, and, you know, I apologize to any of the people that are listening for my work,

1758
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:10,680
because I think there might be one or two. Maybe one.

1759
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:17,680
Anyways, um, what do you do, um, BPD for firing, uh, Nelly from The Mill Room?

1760
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:23,680
It's really funny because I do know the reasons behind it, and it was really stupid why they did it.

1761
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:28,720
and there's a lot of people there that have done a lot worse and are still there and it's just

1762
02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:33,920
retarded so but whatever she's probably gonna end up getting something better in the long run so

1763
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:38,320
that's cool but there's just a lot of people i have lots of respect for from that and that sucks

1764
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:47,760
then finally uh just uh i'm sorry fuck you to the rain because uh

1765
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:51,360
wet outside and i can't work on my cabinet not that i would work on my cabinet anyways if it

1766
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:58,360
it wasn't raining. I'm just tired, that's it.

1767
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:04,920
Alright, I'm going back to my old F.U. song, because the new one,

1768
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:09,920
William Hung, just wasn't working out, so I'm going back to my old song.

1769
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:16,060
Why aren't we just talking about how we didn't really care for this song, Jamie?

1770
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:19,560
Why don't you pick another one?

1771
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:23,420
I'm feeling uncreative tonight because I just like the fact that it goes all things keep

1772
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:31,040
getting better and you know it's the FUs of the week.

1773
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:36,320
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, no maybe later.

1774
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:38,600
I know you need to have the Veruca Salt song.

1775
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:39,600
Ooh I like Veruca Salt.

1776
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:41,600
I won't do that.

1777
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:44,640
Maybe I'll have to do that, that would be cute.

1778
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:49,320
I'm never that angsty though and honestly to be honest this week is much different.

1779
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:53,520
I'm just, I'm gonna say F you to the fact that I've been really insanely busy this week

1780
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:56,720
and I haven't had time to do all the things that I want to do and F you to the fact that

1781
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:59,720
I haven't been able to hang out with certain people as much as I would like to be able

1782
02:39:59,720 --> 02:40:04,360
to because of the fact that, you know, they're working and I'm working and I got the radio

1783
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:07,600
stuff and et cetera, et cetera, so that kind of sucks.

1784
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:11,680
There needs to be more hours in the day and then people shouldn't have to work as much

1785
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:13,320
and then keep the same salary.

1786
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:18,480
I realize I'm living in La La Land but I really don't have anything realistic this week.

1787
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:22,960
actually been a pretty decent week it's really busy except F you to the people

1788
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:26,760
that went saw the grudge at 930 on Friday night in Roseville because you

1789
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:31,080
all were too damn loud and F you to that guy I had to yell at in the middle of the

1790
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:36,000
movie although that did make me feel really good I think getting the applause

1791
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,440
like that when I told that guy to shut the hell up felt really really good

1792
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:45,720
there's just not a lot of rushes like that you get in the world so if you do

1793
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:51,320
that movie as well for making people scream. People were too damn loud with that movie

1794
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:54,720
and it was giving me a headache. Oh, F you to the fact, I know why, F you to the fact

1795
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:59,040
that the projectionist or something, the film was damaged or the projection was going on

1796
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:05,120
because for 20 goddamn minutes the movie was bouncing up and down like it was shaking.

1797
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:08,120
Like imagine if you were trying to watch something on a projection screen and it was shaking

1798
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:11,640
like an earthquake. I swear to God it was giving me a headache after like one minute

1799
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:15,720
having to watch it like that. And we go and complain. Loki actually went in and complained

1800
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:20,720
and what do they tell you? Uh, yeah, it's only gonna do that for 20 minutes. Uh, we

1801
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:27,040
got the defective reel from the studio, but hey, we're getting a new one that replaces

1802
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:34,040
soon. Sorry. Uh-uh. No. Fuck you and your fucking bitch-ass whore-cunt for fucking making

1803
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:41,480
me pay 9.25 plus a $1.25 Fandango fee, because I don't like fucking lines at your movie theater.

1804
02:41:41,480 --> 02:41:47,160
theater. Fuck you for making me pay that. I want a perfect god damn theater experience.

1805
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:51,920
You know what? You should ask for the manager. I know. I should write a letter and complain.

1806
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:57,600
Do it. I just might. You should ask for the manager's boss then. They all asked for just

1807
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:06,600
I didn't. I did. Who knew? I had this rage pent up in me and I forgot all about it. I

1808
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:11,440
pushed it to the back of my mind and you people brought it out of me. RAGE! I got a free ticket.

1809
02:42:11,440 --> 02:42:18,080
it for complaining about them turning on the light at the end of the credits for the Matrix.

1810
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:22,440
I'll write a nasty letter. Because you know what, I can't, I think I had one other bad

1811
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,560
experience at theater and I can't remember what it was, but I bet if I went through the

1812
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:30,880
F.U. archives of the show I could find it. Mention the three magic words. Better Business

1813
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:37,800
Bureau. Or I'll mention these magic words. Fuck you whore for making me pay so much money

1814
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:40,920
for going to see a sub-par production.

1815
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:43,160
I want everything in pristine condition.

1816
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:45,240
You're gonna, it's highway robbery.

1817
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:47,400
No wonder people pirate your goddamn movies.

1818
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:50,280
Here's my thing, okay, it was playing

1819
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:53,000
on like six to eight screens in there.

1820
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,280
Take out the bad film, play it less.

1821
02:42:56,280 --> 02:43:00,360
Oh my God, five screens, how will we survive?

1822
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:02,880
I mean, seriously, just play it less.

1823
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,240
Play another, I'm sure more people

1824
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:08,240
I wanted to see a shark's tail, so go ahead and play that instead.

1825
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:12,240
I mean, they could have easily taken this out of rotation, but instead they were like,

1826
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:14,240
Ah, fuck it, no one's gonna care.

1827
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:20,240
Alright.

1828
02:43:21,240 --> 02:43:25,240
Let's move on and go to the other angsty folks in our studio right now.

1829
02:43:25,240 --> 02:43:27,240
We'll start it off with DDR Angel.

1830
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:30,240
Nice attempt to burp, Ryan.

1831
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:32,240
Haha, it's okay.

1832
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:37,420
Um, just a few just being tired today. I don't even know what's up. Everybody seems tired today

1833
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:42,720
I don't know just there's no reason for it. I shouldn't be tired, but I am

1834
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:47,560
Again if you did the flaky instructor that I've got

1835
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:52,600
But whatever he's still deciding the whole class every once in a while

1836
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:56,400
Maybe he'll get over it and realize. Oh wait. I haven't job

1837
02:43:56,400 --> 02:44:02,400
Um, that's about it. I'm, like, not angsty. What the hell?

1838
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:09,400
You're not really ever that angsty, Angel. I've only seen you angsty here one time, and it took an act of God to make you angsty?

1839
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:14,400
Alright. Bradley, Arcadian42, what's on your mind?

1840
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:18,400
Of course, fuck you to, uh, FolsomPD and...

1841
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:19,400
Surprise!

1842
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:26,400
Yes, fuck you to all that and all, fuck you to me for getting myself into that, in that

1843
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:32,680
situation and all the decisions and delays and everything that caused it and yeah, so

1844
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:39,680
forth. Uh, what else? Uh, fuck you to having to make up all that time, but at least my

1845
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:44,680
but at least my work is nice and they'll let me make up time

1846
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:49,680
fuck you to the honey back ribs or whatever

1847
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:54,680
the new thing at Applebee's for sucking

1848
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:59,680
not honey, it's like honey barbecue ribs

1849
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:04,680
actually it was a rib thing but it sucked

1850
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:08,680
It was a new rib thing, but it sucked.

1851
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:12,680
It was like, bleh.

1852
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:17,680
But at least it was free, because it was the free lunch day at work.

1853
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:22,680
So at least I didn't have to pay that money for it.

1854
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:26,680
And, uh, yeah.

1855
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:31,680
Actually, just R.O.D. for the TV.

1856
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:38,160
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, of which I haven't gotten very many tonight,

1857
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:41,920
surprisingly enough, so if they don't get in in the next 30 seconds or so, they're probably

1858
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:45,640
not getting read, but that's alright, we have a few.

1859
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:52,780
Ry Chan says, F you to friends borrowing things and not returning them. F you to people that

1860
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:57,880
drive in the fast lane and are going 15 miles an hour under the speed limit. F you to loners.

1861
02:45:57,880 --> 02:46:02,880
F you to people that continue to try to use you for all your worth and can't take a hint when I say no.

1862
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:06,880
Oh, and F you to taking a frisbee to the lip.

1863
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:08,880
Ow. Ow.

1864
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:11,880
What, Loki?

1865
02:46:11,880 --> 02:46:14,880
If you're not a dog, you can't catch it with your mouth.

1866
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:17,880
I don't think, something tells me she wasn't trying to do that.

1867
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:19,880
You know what, though? You know what's a lot safer?

1868
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:22,880
What were those things that are like, frisbees? Did they go for the, uh, robies?

1869
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:23,880
What were those things called?

1870
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:26,880
Yeah, it's like throwing a giant saw blade at your head.

1871
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:28,880
That's the best thing ever.

1872
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,880
The Nerf ones, the plastic ones.

1873
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:35,880
Yeah, the Nerf ones are the best ones because it just feels like you're throwing like a fish at you or something like that.

1874
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:39,880
But yeah, the Robies are fucking dangerous because they go faster and they're like more streamlined.

1875
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:43,880
Like seriously, it's like a saw blade getting thrown at you.

1876
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:46,880
But they're awesome, you can throw them on the park.

1877
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:48,880
Alright.

1878
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:53,880
Didn't they have a Robies that were shaped in like strange shapes too, like diamonds and stuff?

1879
02:46:53,880 --> 02:47:09,880
I only heard half of tonight's show. Unacceptable. Fired. That's fine. He does good news for

1880
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:17,500
the website. Jazz says F you to the fact that the projection people didn't turn off the

1881
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:21,640
lights for like 15 minutes into the movie and the fact that the grudge was more funny

1882
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:29,320
even scary and the rest of my audience agreed. I thought the grudge was scary, I don't know

1883
02:47:29,320 --> 02:47:34,880
if the grudge was really scary. But that's it, he reminded me of the other thing. When

1884
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:39,800
I went and saw, I think it was, I want to say it was Kill Bill 2 over there, they didn't

1885
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:44,000
turn off the goddamn lights. That's what it was, it was Kill Bill 2. Yeah, when I went

1886
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:47,560
and saw Kill Bill 2, they didn't turn off the goddamn lights for like 15 minutes. And

1887
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:51,280
you would think such a little thing would not be so annoying, but it was really, really

1888
02:47:51,280 --> 02:48:00,560
annoying. Thank you Jazz for reigniting that angst within me. Lastly, Poto says F you to

1889
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:08,640
writing a paper on two hours of sleep. Aww. Aww. I remember being such a procrastinator

1890
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:11,640
like that, still am. I remember staying up all night. I'm doing my paper during my lunch

1891
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:17,960
break tomorrow, and it's due tomorrow night. Amen to that. Alright. I'm not going to class

1892
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:28,400
I guess what we should do, let's open up the skype line because for god's sake we haven't

1893
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:32,680
had it open the whole show except for that long chat we had with frequency, basically

1894
02:48:32,680 --> 02:48:37,280
frequency took all your skype time tonight ladies and gentlemen, no I'm kidding, we'll

1895
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:42,240
open it up a little bit for the folks to talk to us on skype, so skype's open, if you want

1896
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:47,120
more information on skype head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact

1897
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:50,720
with us. We definitely would like your feedback to anything we've talked about during tonight's

1898
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:54,840
show, including lots of stuff that we had talked to Frequency about earlier, as well

1899
02:48:54,840 --> 02:49:00,080
as, you know, other news, the Bomani remix contests, and machines breaking down, and

1900
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:03,480
kids in arcades, and projectionists that don't know how to tromp the goddamn light when the

1901
02:49:03,480 --> 02:49:08,560
movie starts. Anyway, sorry. Getting a little bit off tangent there. Also, we will accept

1902
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:12,920
your Ask Orange Lounge questions over private messages chat if you guys have anything you

1903
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:16,120
want to ask us. We only have a couple minutes left, so we're not going to make an official

1904
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:18,620
segment but if you have some questions you'd like us to address go ahead and

1905
02:49:18,620 --> 02:49:23,040
send those in I'd also like to add that everything Sam Raimi touches turns to

1906
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:29,280
gold and his car ends up in all of his movies damn it I didn't look for it in

1907
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:32,720
the garage but I don't know if that really counts because he just produced

1908
02:49:32,720 --> 02:49:37,680
the movie this car might be in there I I'm being told right now in our chat

1909
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:45,080
room that right now our very show is being played inside a truck stop awesome

1910
02:49:45,080 --> 02:49:50,080
So we'd like to give a big YEE-HAW to all our truckin' buddies down there.

1911
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:53,080
No, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding. Please don't beat me up.

1912
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:58,080
No, but I guess we have somebody listening on a network over at the truck stop right now.

1913
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:01,080
I want to go to the truck stop. They have good food.

1914
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:03,080
I want hash food. They have good food over at the truck stop.

1915
02:50:03,080 --> 02:50:04,080
Oh my God, Bob. Let's go get food.

1916
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:07,080
Do they have riblets? I want riblets. I don't think they have riblets.

1917
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:12,080
But I need to be watching my weight because I have a performance to do on Saturday.

1918
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:14,780
Oh, come on, eat healthy food, get some fitness with it.

1919
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:17,580
I gotta work early tomorrow. If I didn't have to work early tomorrow, I would totally do it.

1920
02:50:17,580 --> 02:50:19,580
I can, I have to work at 6.30.

1921
02:50:19,580 --> 02:50:22,580
What? Sorry.

1922
02:50:22,580 --> 02:50:27,580
Anyway, we're supposed to watch the language, because we're being broadcast to the truck stop right now, so...

1923
02:50:27,580 --> 02:50:28,580
You know.

1924
02:50:28,580 --> 02:50:30,580
Don't give in to me!

1925
02:50:30,580 --> 02:50:34,580
Alright, I'll keep the mic away from Logie, if that's the case.

1926
02:50:34,580 --> 02:50:42,020
Oh, I didn't even check the Skype thing to see if anybody called. Nope! Still wide open

1927
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:44,780
there. Well, I guess nobody wants to call us tonight. That's fine. That's fine. We'll

1928
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:48,540
just talk to ourselves. We'll amuse ourselves here. That's fine. Any big Halloween plans

1929
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:53,300
for you, Loki? Just having a get-together over here. We're gonna watch Shaun of the

1930
02:50:53,300 --> 02:50:58,900
Dead because I got my lovely promo copy of that, and that's gonna rock. Shaun of the

1931
02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:03,820
Dead. I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try because the people are gonna have alcohol. I'm gonna

1932
02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:07,820
I tried to slip in one of my bad movies in there, but I don't think they're gonna go for it.

1933
02:51:07,820 --> 02:51:11,820
No one wants to watch my bad movies, and that makes me sad.

1934
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:15,820
I spend good money on those, and goddamnit, if, you know,

1935
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:19,820
no one wants to watch, uh, was it, uh, Blood Sisters of Lesbian Sin,

1936
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:23,820
you know, who will?

1937
02:51:23,820 --> 02:51:27,820
I'll watch it. Just to see what the hell it is.

1938
02:51:27,820 --> 02:51:31,820
I have a question. How many people are coming to this get-together?

1939
02:51:31,820 --> 02:51:40,660
don't know. Where are they all going to fit? Uh, I don't know. Interesting, very- Sit on

1940
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:49,620
the floor, goddammit, because I'm taking language! Gosh darn it! Much better, much better. Alright.

1941
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:57,300
Uh, Bradley, you have any exciting Halloween plans? Nope. Sit on my ass at home, do nothing.

1942
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:59,300
Sounds like a plan to me.

1943
02:51:59,300 --> 02:52:01,300
You know what I'm doing?

1944
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:03,300
That's a fabulous idea. Let's take out the airazooka.

1945
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:07,300
You can put candy in it and it launches the candy.

1946
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:11,300
I've got like three days of Halloween because we're doing the big thing at work.

1947
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:13,300
I have my catgirl costume.

1948
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:18,300
And then I'm having Rocky on Saturday.

1949
02:52:18,300 --> 02:52:24,300
And probably Sunday I'm just going to sit around and watch Interview with the Vampire on laserdisc.

1950
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:26,300
There you go.

1951
02:52:26,300 --> 02:52:31,220
Of course, if you're in the Sacramento area, you should definitely check out furtherindignities.org

1952
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:34,140
for the information on a Halloween tradition.

1953
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:38,020
Rocky Orpix show is going to be in UC Davis and several of your buddies from Warren's

1954
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:40,860
Knowledge Radio are involved with that because that was the thing we did before we played

1955
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:42,780
DDR and did this show.

1956
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:44,500
And it's still going on.

1957
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:48,100
So check that out if you're in the area.

1958
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:52,220
Also what else I want to say, oh, remember the follow up from last week.

1959
02:52:52,220 --> 02:52:56,220
Remember we were talking about, in case you guys weren't listening last week, but we were

1960
02:52:56,220 --> 02:53:02,140
We were talking about how we were going to do DDR on the big screen at some point.

1961
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:05,500
We were going to take that same movie screen and possibly have a Bimani night in the movie

1962
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:09,500
theater and possibly do a live taping of Orange Lounge Radio.

1963
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:11,100
Outlook is very good on that.

1964
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:14,740
We're hoping to get some help from other friends of ours within the Bimani community to kind

1965
02:53:14,740 --> 02:53:16,260
of make that a success.

1966
02:53:16,260 --> 02:53:20,960
But just like the TV show thing that had come up earlier, we're having a hard time figuring

1967
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:24,340
out exactly what we're going to do besides a live episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1968
02:53:24,340 --> 02:53:26,340
Let's set the ferret on fire!

1969
02:53:28,340 --> 02:53:30,340
He said, let's set a virgin on fire.

1970
02:53:31,340 --> 02:53:33,340
Let's set a virgin's pants on fire.

1971
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:38,340
Let's set the ferret on fire, that's what we need to do.

1972
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:41,340
My babies! Where's my babies?

1973
02:53:41,340 --> 02:53:43,340
I don't even know where the ferrets are.

1974
02:53:43,340 --> 02:53:44,340
Do you want to be my baby?

1975
02:53:44,340 --> 02:53:46,340
No, I won't have to be your baby, you have to get out and get it.

1976
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:50,340
No, don't do it, don't be your slave.

1977
02:53:50,340 --> 02:53:52,340
Don't be your slave!

1978
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:54,340
Let's let people go!

1979
02:53:57,340 --> 02:54:03,340
Okay, that's one suggestion that's come up, is that Katamari Damacy gets played on the big screen.

1980
02:54:03,340 --> 02:54:04,340
Okay.

1981
02:54:04,340 --> 02:54:07,340
Somehow, we'll have to have some kind of little contest.

1982
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:10,340
Oh, they have two player mode. We could have a Katamari Damacy tournament or something.

1983
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:12,340
He can play as the cousins.

1984
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:15,340
There you go. I'm liking this so far. I'm liking it.

1985
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:18,340
Alright.

1986
02:54:18,340 --> 02:54:22,180
They got choir people, they got the la da da da da da da da da da.

1987
02:54:22,180 --> 02:54:23,020
That'd be cool.

1988
02:54:23,020 --> 02:54:24,220
We'll get the UC Davis choir in on it.

1989
02:54:24,220 --> 02:54:25,060
That'll be fun.

1990
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:30,480
All right, we're gonna take a real quick break.

1991
02:54:30,480 --> 02:54:31,700
We're gonna do a one song break,

1992
02:54:31,700 --> 02:54:34,700
then we're gonna come back and wrap up the show.

1993
02:54:34,700 --> 02:54:36,860
Uh, what song should we do here in this break?

1994
02:54:36,860 --> 02:54:38,500
Let's do...

1995
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:42,700
Well, we did pop and we didn't do a Guitar Freaks song.

1996
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:43,540
What?

1997
02:54:44,860 --> 02:54:47,020
You know, Loki wants to play his remix again.

1998
02:54:47,020 --> 02:54:47,980
Fine, fair enough.

1999
02:54:47,980 --> 02:54:49,900
That makes for a good one, Songbreak.

2000
02:54:49,900 --> 02:54:54,740
Tell us one more time about your remix that you didn't enter into any contest because you, I don't know,

2001
02:54:54,740 --> 02:54:56,780
you don't enter contests or something.

2002
02:54:56,780 --> 02:54:58,820
Well, this is just my newest one.

2003
02:54:58,820 --> 02:55:02,960
The preview went off of the next album, which I was trying today

2004
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:09,800
to upload my new album, and fucking A, it will not work, okay? Language! Language!

2005
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:11,720
Yes, I am speaking English.

2006
02:55:11,720 --> 02:55:13,860
Okay, anyways, um...

2007
02:55:13,860 --> 02:55:17,500
So, Golly Gee Willikers, it would not, you know,

2008
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:21,500
upload to the server

2009
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:26,100
and so yeah I couldn't make it available for people download that made me sad

2010
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:29,900
and you said it sucks okay

2011
02:55:29,900 --> 02:55:32,900
that's what I want to say but anyways this is a

2012
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:37,420
paranoid revolution be sure you put in the one that's just revolution

2013
02:55:37,420 --> 02:55:40,620
mp3 because I changed it a few times

2014
02:55:40,620 --> 02:55:45,020
cuz I just did not like the middle of it so I had to tweak it a little bit more

2015
02:55:45,020 --> 02:56:05,020
But, um, CD Temploki. Okay, anyways, um, so yeah. Here it is. And it's glory and stuff. And it'll be available for download soon, I'm sure. Just have to get it to upload.

2016
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:15,020
Alrighty. Here we go. Paranoia Revolution. Enjoy. And we'll be back to wrap up the show after this.

2017
02:57:35,020 --> 02:58:01,340
I bet that I'll spare the bus back I bet that I'll spare the bus back

2018
02:58:01,340 --> 02:58:15,340
I bet that if you tear the bus back

2019
02:58:15,340 --> 02:58:28,340
I bet that if you tear the bus back

2020
02:58:58,340 --> 02:59:19,560
Now, it's Paranoia Revolution here on Orange Lounge Radio, remixed by our very own Noki.

2021
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:20,560
You know what I realized?

2022
02:59:20,560 --> 02:59:27,400
The bass line in that kind of reminds me of Tsugaru, like it has the same rhythm.

2023
02:59:27,400 --> 02:59:32,200
it towards the end actually has the part you know in paranoia is where it's all where it's all

2024
02:59:35,240 --> 02:59:42,520
has that throughout the whole thing um yeah so it's like a was it uh 12th notes and then um

2025
02:59:43,240 --> 02:59:48,120
like some fourth oh it's pretty cool it's just it's a little bit um tweaked off of that that's

2026
02:59:48,120 --> 02:59:53,640
in the background i know for most of it obviously because i made it but um i don't know that's all

2027
02:59:53,640 --> 02:59:56,280
It's done on the second thing right now

2028
02:59:56,960 --> 03:00:03,080
But they'll be available download along with my nice cover art and whatnot you can put together your own see

2029
03:00:03,080 --> 03:00:09,080
Like I did in the studio because like hell if I'm gonna make more and like, you know send them out to people

2030
03:00:09,080 --> 03:00:11,080
I just don't do that

2031
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:15,120
Yeah

2032
03:00:15,200 --> 03:00:20,160
Alright, well we got to wrap up the show here. So we got to go around and get everybody's final thought

2033
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:26,160
We'll start off with DDR Angel. DDR Angel, what is your final thought?

2034
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:35,160
Um, Katamari Damacy, because I can't stop playing.

2035
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:39,160
Final thought from Bradley. You go last, right?

2036
03:00:39,160 --> 03:00:45,160
Arcadian 42?

2037
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:49,900
thoughts

2038
03:00:49,900 --> 03:00:51,680
I have none at the moment

2039
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:54,840
they're gone, they're gone

2040
03:00:54,840 --> 03:00:55,620
alright

2041
03:00:55,620 --> 03:00:58,580
uh... Loki your final thought

2042
03:00:58,580 --> 03:01:03,100
there's gonna be too many games I gotta buy this week, I got Neocontra and Grand Theft Auto

2043
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:04,240
San Andreas

2044
03:01:04,240 --> 03:01:06,060
and

2045
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:07,100
actually maybe not

2046
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:09,620
I wasn't gonna get Tony Hawk's Underground 2, just be

2047
03:01:09,620 --> 03:01:11,180
maybe I might get that

2048
03:01:11,180 --> 03:01:13,860
but Need for Speed Underground 2, no

2049
03:01:13,860 --> 03:01:15,520
DarkSakura, your final thought?

2050
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:21,520
I have games to play, like I have Katamari Damacy now, I have Sims 2.

2051
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:23,340
And you know what?

2052
03:01:23,340 --> 03:01:26,240
Real life is taking up all my time.

2053
03:01:26,240 --> 03:01:32,180
So, I've had to focus on school, everything, so...

2054
03:01:32,180 --> 03:01:38,040
There is a world outside of video games, not much one, and it usually sucks, but there is one.

2055
03:01:38,040 --> 03:01:40,840
Alright, and my final thought is, don't forget to listen to our other shows on

2056
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:55,640
Monday Night Diversion, and Wednesday Nights on OSRA outside the box with a special Grand

2057
03:01:55,640 --> 03:02:00,920
Theft Auto San Andreas update.

2058
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:03,840
That's the show on the station where we talk about the other games, other than the stomp

2059
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:05,880
your feet and tap your fingers games.

2060
03:02:05,880 --> 03:02:08,920
So we'll get to all that on Wednesday and Tuesday.

2061
03:02:08,920 --> 03:02:12,960
Jamie, I'm sure we'll have another fun show and Monday remixes, Thursday Orange

2062
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:16,620
Honors Radio Rewind, another night of programming is coming Orange Honors Radio

2063
03:02:16,620 --> 03:02:20,960
soon that's all I have to say and also the long versions program is gonna

2064
03:02:20,960 --> 03:02:27,460
launch hopefully sometime this week but like next week at the latest so we're

2065
03:02:27,460 --> 03:02:32,840
gonna have a long version program that's gonna be at lunchtime for an hour.

2066
03:02:32,840 --> 03:02:42,440
real quick question here in the studio. Okay, never mind. Nothing to see here, move along.

2067
03:02:42,440 --> 03:02:47,840
Oh, and, should mention, when you're, you know, not listening to Orange Knowledge Radio,

2068
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:54,640
New South Park coming to Comedy Central. Hooray, hooray. Okay, the last word of this show,

2069
03:02:54,640 --> 03:02:58,240
I'm going to give it to Loki. Loki, the last word of tonight's show. One word that sums

2070
03:02:58,240 --> 03:03:08,920
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2071
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:13,280

2073
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:27,120
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2074
03:03:27,120 --> 03:03:32,120
Whenever my life gets me so down, I know I can go down,

2075
03:03:32,120 --> 03:03:35,120
Down, down, where the fun never ends,

2076
03:03:35,120 --> 03:03:40,120
As long as my music keeps playing, you know what I'm saying,

2077
03:03:40,120 --> 03:03:46,120
I know that I can find a friend,

2078
03:03:46,120 --> 03:03:48,120
That has a roundhouse.

2079
03:03:48,120 --> 03:03:54,320
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2080
03:04:18,120 --> 03:04:40,520
I thought that was a gospel song at first, and then I realized what it was. I didn't

2081
03:04:40,520 --> 03:04:43,720
realize they sung the theme around us like that. I thought they actually had a little

2082
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:45,560
synthesized thing.

2083
03:04:45,560 --> 03:04:48,000
No, because the show fucking rocked

2084
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:51,760
and then they took it off air like they do everything that's good on Nickelodeon.

2085
03:04:51,760 --> 03:04:55,620
They need to have Nick retro with the old

2086
03:04:55,620 --> 03:04:59,400
shows like Salute Your Shorts, you know,

2087
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:00,900
fucking

2088
03:05:00,900 --> 03:05:03,040
Hey Dude and all that stuff.

2089
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:06,680
They need to put that back on air because they've got like, you know, the stupid

2090
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:08,400
noggin crap with like

2091
03:05:08,400 --> 03:05:12,000

2094
03:05:17,640 --> 03:05:19,540

03:05:19,540 --> 03:05:20,920
it's like uh...

2096
03:05:20,920 --> 03:05:25,640

03:05:25,640 --> 03:05:27,760

03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:33,800

hahaha

2100
03:05:35,720 --> 03:05:38,380
show is fabulous

2101
03:05:38,380 --> 03:05:40,760
at first a reason it makes me think

2102
03:05:40,760 --> 03:05:43,240
yet god yes you can sit on television why

2103
03:05:43,240 --> 03:05:47,120
can we have reruns of the kentucky tv

2104
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:48,220
turkey tv

2105
03:05:48,220 --> 03:05:49,360
pinwheel

2106
03:05:49,360 --> 03:05:51,900
today's special

2107
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:58,380
and we also

2108
03:05:58,380 --> 03:06:02,120
you know this never get that the fact that

2109
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:05,080
I'll come back one.

2110
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:06,840
Exactly.

2111
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:10,280
Thank God for the internet, because I'm hoping more and more old-school you can't do that

2112
03:06:10,280 --> 03:06:14,040
on television episodes start showing up, because I found a couple online once, or somebody

2113
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:15,040
gave me some.

2114
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:16,040
I don't remember what it was.

2115
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:17,040
Did you give me some?

2116
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:18,040
Angel gave me some.

2117
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:19,040
Oh, so great.

2118
03:06:19,040 --> 03:06:20,040
I need to get more.

2119
03:06:20,040 --> 03:06:21,040
That show was so freaking fabulous.

2120
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:23,200
I get my Ouija board back this week.

2121
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:26,240
Dude, the dungeon scenes of you can't do that on television.

2122
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:27,240
That's all I gotta say.

2123
03:06:27,240 --> 03:06:30,560
Or the arcades.

2124
03:06:30,560 --> 03:06:38,460
all about barf that kind of rocks poor guy I think isn't he dead poor guy he

2125
03:06:38,460 --> 03:06:44,000
was awesome so underappreciated and peewee you know fucking peewees play out

2126
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:47,440
seems to come back I don't care if he's a fucking pervert and child molester you

2127
03:06:47,440 --> 03:06:51,220
know what this is this is a conversation I was having my friend the other day

2128
03:06:51,220 --> 03:06:54,400
we're talking about Michael Jackson okay yeah the guy's really fucked up yeah

2129
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:58,400
okay maybe he slept with some children yeah that does not make his music bad

2130
03:06:58,400 --> 03:07:04,400
Just because someone's a child molester does not mean that they cannot make bad, or make good music.

2131
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:09,400
It's just like Pee Wee Herman. Okay, so he's into child pornography and all this stuff.

2132
03:07:09,400 --> 03:07:15,400
Does not mean the show was bad. You, people are confusing the art with the person.

2133
03:07:15,400 --> 03:07:20,400
I don't go around, you know, saying, you know, I don't like that music because that guy's an alcoholic.

2134
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:25,400
You know, I don't like that music because I don't like the sound of it. Not, I don't like the person.

2135
03:07:25,400 --> 03:07:30,400
People need to separate the person from the music. That's what I think.

2136
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:38,400
Some comments from the chat room. Danger Mouse and Count Ducula.

2137
03:07:38,400 --> 03:07:41,400
Yeah, Count Ducula.

2138
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:43,400
Duck Man needs to come back.

2139
03:07:43,400 --> 03:07:45,400
Yeah, Duck Man, definitely.

2140
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:49,400
Alright. Yeah, enough memory lane stuff.

2141
03:07:49,400 --> 03:07:53,400
Coming to DVDs soon, Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Full House.

2142
03:07:53,400 --> 03:07:58,400
For all you sick pedophiles out there like the Olsen twins.

2143
03:07:59,400 --> 03:08:02,400
When do I get my Golden Girls DVDs? When are those out?

2144
03:08:02,400 --> 03:08:03,400
They're already out.

2145
03:08:03,400 --> 03:08:05,400
What? What?

2146
03:08:05,400 --> 03:08:06,400
I need Wonder Woman.

2147
03:08:06,400 --> 03:08:10,400
Bitch, what? What? My Golden Girls DVDs are already out and I don't have them? What?

2148
03:08:10,400 --> 03:08:14,400
I think they come out Tuesday, or I think they're already out. They were coming out in October.

2149
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:52,080
Alright, that's it we're going to pull the plug on the show now and we're going to go

2150
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:54,360
to tonight's post show.

2151
03:08:54,360 --> 03:08:59,360
You guys seem to like the Dance Mania stuff, so we're going to do Dance Mania X7 tonight.

2152
03:08:59,360 --> 03:09:03,480
There's a lot of fun songs on here, including some fourth mix songs, if you can believe

2153
03:09:03,480 --> 03:09:04,480
it or not.

2154
03:09:04,480 --> 03:09:08,840
Have a great night, thank you everybody very very much for listening tonight, we really

2155
03:09:08,840 --> 03:09:09,840
appreciate it.

2156

Have a great night! Bye!

2157
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:59,840
Baby, I've been missing you And I hope you'll miss me too

2158
03:09:59,840 --> 03:10:06,840
You're my treasure, you're my love You will always be the one for me

2159
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:10,840
Cause I know, you are my superstar

2160
03:10:10,840 --> 03:10:13,840
Like a hidden heart, we'll never get together

2161
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:17,840
