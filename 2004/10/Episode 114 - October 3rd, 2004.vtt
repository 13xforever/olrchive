[SPEAKER_18]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner the happiest bunny on the farm.

03:48.860 --> 03:51.643
[SPEAKER_18]: Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, DarkSakura.

03:52.202 --> 03:52.843
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

04:21.690 --> 04:29.555
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a brand new webcam angle, just for tonight, because it's only the three of us, so there's no guests to focus on, so... Extreme webcam action.

04:29.595 --> 04:38.141
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you get to see Loki and me this time on the webcam, the whole show, and our really dirty work area, which I'm almost embarrassed to have on the cam, but I don't care.

04:40.042 --> 04:41.803
[SPEAKER_18]: Let the world know, I don't care.

04:41.843 --> 04:43.444
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't put my feet on the webcam anymore.

04:45.165 --> 04:47.967
[SPEAKER_18]: You could still get your... Oh, we do have a guest after all.

04:47.987 --> 04:48.808
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh!

04:49.248 --> 04:49.368
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh!

04:50.612 --> 04:52.733
[SPEAKER_18]: That's alright, we'll keep the webcam angled this way, that's right.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.875
[SPEAKER_18]: Say hello to Arcadian42, Bradley just showed up.

04:58.996 --> 04:59.296
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

05:01.237 --> 05:05.820
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we appreciate Arcadian's presence, even though we did think we were going to have a guest-free show, but that's alright.

05:07.481 --> 05:13.304
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well, we certainly have some Bomani news to talk about tonight, believe it or not, and randomness.

05:13.384 --> 05:15.184
[SPEAKER_18]: I assure you there's plenty of randomness tonight.

05:15.365 --> 05:15.705
[SPEAKER_18]: You okay?

05:15.825 --> 05:16.865
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate jalapenos!

05:17.125 --> 05:17.746
[SPEAKER_24]: Why am I eating them?

05:18.806 --> 05:22.228
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Jamie is starting off the show in her traditional manner by eating.

05:23.149 --> 05:24.650
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I haven't had dinner, okay?

05:24.690 --> 05:26.090
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any food at my house.

05:26.231 --> 05:28.012
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally porked out before tonight's show.

05:28.532 --> 05:31.914
[SPEAKER_09]: I ate so much food, I just... I've had low-carb chocolate truffles.

05:32.694 --> 05:33.275
[SPEAKER_09]: Three of them.

05:33.935 --> 05:34.956
[SPEAKER_09]: And half a deviled egg.

05:35.456 --> 05:38.178
[SPEAKER_18]: I had skinny crust pizza from Roundtable.

05:38.358 --> 05:41.520
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that I'm on a diet or anything, I just really like the skinny crust pizza.

05:41.540 --> 05:44.101
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I like New York pizza, which is pretty much very similar.

05:44.121 --> 05:45.042
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very skinny crusty.

05:47.028 --> 05:48.769
[SPEAKER_18]: We're about to watch Loki fall to his certain death.

05:48.789 --> 05:50.009
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe his portal to hell will open up.

05:50.029 --> 05:51.730
[SPEAKER_09]: And take him home to his people.

05:51.750 --> 05:56.232
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some news that we missed last week because Extreme was the big news last week.

05:56.272 --> 06:00.233
[SPEAKER_18]: We even have some news we kind of missed that I want to get to.

06:12.205 --> 06:39.450
[SPEAKER_18]: and I know I want to get pissed off at some point tonight I actually have something I'm kind of pissed off about I want to rant about later and well I'm sure you guys are feeling some anger too so we'll definitely have an FU of the week segment cage match and all your favorite stuff when we come back from this break featuring some music from DDR Extreme USA but songs that have already been in DDR before but they're fun songs we're playing them again in Extreme USA so enjoy

06:40.266 --> 06:42.127
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:03.010 --> 07:04.691
[SPEAKER_09]: I just can be the babysitter all night.

07:04.751 --> 07:05.511
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so cool.

07:06.311 --> 07:09.553
[SPEAKER_18]: So, come be disciplined by DarkSakura in our charity.

07:09.573 --> 07:10.293
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you want it.

07:13.314 --> 07:15.875
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like you said in the very first episode of Orange Ones Radio.

07:15.895 --> 07:16.856
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll never forget this.

07:17.176 --> 07:20.157
[SPEAKER_18]: You were ranting about parents at Golfland.

07:20.757 --> 07:21.358
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

07:21.478 --> 07:26.320
[SPEAKER_18]: And you said, I remember the quote, you said something like, if you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.581
[SPEAKER_09]: Parents don't want me to do their job.

07:30.842 --> 07:31.782
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be a scary mom.

07:34.546 --> 07:36.848
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, we got the new Ultramix 2 song.

07:36.868 --> 07:38.189
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll play that for you at some point tonight.

07:38.349 --> 07:39.790
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a previous Cage Match winner.

07:40.131 --> 07:43.113
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it was picked by DarkSakura.

07:43.674 --> 07:45.015
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute.

07:46.396 --> 07:47.177
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we'll be back.

08:11.417 --> 08:12.578
Thank you for watching!

09:25.195 --> 09:26.725
Here we go, here we go, here we go

09:54.329 --> 09:55.490
Thanks for watching!

11:38.474 --> 11:38.995
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to rock!

12:19.818 --> 12:24.402
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on the air.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.627
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, whatever happened to Step Squad?

12:42.647 --> 12:44.388
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't heard you talk about them in a while, Jamie.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.789
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't hardly heard from anybody lately.

12:46.850 --> 12:50.072
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, I've been so busy that it's hard to keep up with anyone.

12:50.732 --> 12:58.338
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to explain what Step Squad is, because we have a lot of new people that only started listening a couple months ago, and we started giving, you know, exclusive hints and stuff.

12:58.358 --> 13:02.841
[SPEAKER_18]: Now people start listening to us, so explain for those that don't know what Step Squad is all about.

13:03.271 --> 13:12.354
[SPEAKER_09]: StepSquad was established to sort of combat some of the, I guess, more negative aspects of the whole DDR team business that was going on.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.595
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically just people who were... Owned you!

13:15.935 --> 13:16.895
[SPEAKER_09]: Owned you more!

13:18.075 --> 13:19.256
[SPEAKER_09]: I pwned you.

13:20.536 --> 13:21.216
[SPEAKER_09]: Pwned!

13:22.257 --> 13:24.017
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so stupid.

13:24.977 --> 13:27.198
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway... Let me back up for Adley.

13:28.935 --> 13:29.576
[SPEAKER_09]: He said no.

13:30.456 --> 13:42.444
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, it was more or less just an attempt to show some of the more positive aspects of a group of people who would, I guess, embody those type of... What the hell are you doing?

13:43.665 --> 13:44.085
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

13:45.866 --> 13:52.511
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, it was supposed to be more or less the whole positive aspect of what a DDR community could be like.

13:53.391 --> 13:57.534
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I haven't hardly, though, heard from anybody because we're all

13:58.354 --> 13:59.415
[SPEAKER_09]: Busy, busy people.

14:00.155 --> 14:07.659
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to school and having no life and... Okay, that cover is scaring me.

14:10.081 --> 14:15.484
[SPEAKER_09]: That's... Okay, everybody needs to go on to OrangeOnRadio.com and look at the webcam.

14:16.164 --> 14:17.084
[SPEAKER_09]: Because... I can't see it.

14:17.104 --> 14:18.185
It's fucking dark.

14:19.066 --> 14:19.866
[SPEAKER_09]: I said it's dark.

14:19.906 --> 14:20.526
[SPEAKER_18]: Stupid cam.

14:20.586 --> 14:21.287
[SPEAKER_18]: Stupid eye toy.

14:21.647 --> 14:22.788
No, it's not the cam.

14:23.228 --> 14:24.829
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fucking uploading fine.

14:24.949 --> 14:27.150
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just something on the website and that's...

14:27.682 --> 14:30.323
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't finished the damn thing yet.

14:30.443 --> 14:33.824
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all of the energy that you're putting into it while you're making it.

14:33.844 --> 14:35.525
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell's wrong with my computer?

14:35.705 --> 14:36.685
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the resolution on your monitor.

14:36.705 --> 14:37.305
[SPEAKER_16]: My goddamn monitor sucks.

14:37.325 --> 14:37.686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes it does.

14:37.706 --> 14:37.986
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

14:58.995 --> 15:00.116
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I can't go up any higher.

15:01.177 --> 15:02.358
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to get a new monitor.

15:02.558 --> 15:04.620
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't need to get a new monitor, I just need to turn the gamma up.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.382
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, fine, I'll do it anyways.

15:08.203 --> 15:08.744
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

15:10.065 --> 15:13.708
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you were talking?

15:15.029 --> 15:17.171
[SPEAKER_09]: No one was paying attention, so I just stopped.

15:19.233 --> 15:20.915
[SPEAKER_09]: It was about Step Squad and how cool we are.

15:22.932 --> 15:26.395
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a sequel to a classic Orange Lounge Radio inside joke coming up.

15:44.597 --> 15:46.338
[SPEAKER_09]: My week consisted of work and school.

15:46.358 --> 15:46.758
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, guess what?

15:46.778 --> 15:47.098
[SPEAKER_18]: I have no life.

16:12.173 --> 16:17.858
[SPEAKER_09]: All I do is go to work and all I do is go to school and go to the track and go to the gym.

16:18.158 --> 16:26.766
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to spin and I was so happy because I was so pissed off and mad at the world on Friday that I went to spin and had a fun time.

16:27.407 --> 16:28.308
[SPEAKER_09]: Worked out all that aggression.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.301
[SPEAKER_09]: But nothing really major happened this week.

16:35.361 --> 16:39.543
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting Sims 2, which is going to make me happy and I'll have even less free time.

16:41.964 --> 16:46.485
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also training somebody at work.

16:48.266 --> 16:56.548
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got a few, actually a few more changes in mind in my chosen field.

16:57.789 --> 16:59.009
[SPEAKER_09]: Different things at work going on.

16:59.571 --> 17:04.373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really going to go into too much detail about it, but there may be some changes afoot the next couple of months.

17:05.753 --> 17:06.133
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

17:07.253 --> 17:08.274
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to a party last night.

17:09.794 --> 17:11.355
[SPEAKER_09]: You know me, I'm such the party girl.

17:12.435 --> 17:17.457
[SPEAKER_09]: But I ended up, because I was just going to go hang out and do whatever.

17:17.477 --> 17:18.237
[SPEAKER_18]: What was the occasion?

17:18.797 --> 17:19.237
[SPEAKER_09]: Random.

17:19.817 --> 17:20.878
[SPEAKER_18]: Just random party?

17:21.018 --> 17:23.699
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, oh my god, we're bored, let's have a party.

17:24.139 --> 17:24.679
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that works.

17:24.899 --> 17:27.880
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was over at Iguana Girl's house.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.401
[SPEAKER_09]: And oh my god, Moo is female.

17:32.163 --> 17:37.166
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't know what gender Moo was, because iguanas take a year before... Oh, I was like, who the hell's Moo?

17:37.727 --> 17:38.608
[SPEAKER_09]: Moo is her iguana.

17:38.688 --> 17:39.008
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

17:39.128 --> 17:40.489
[SPEAKER_09]: But Moo's now in the big cage.

17:41.049 --> 17:42.911
[SPEAKER_09]: And Moo is very happy and cute and female.

17:43.811 --> 17:44.092
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

17:44.232 --> 17:45.933
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is going to be fun when she starts laying eggs.

17:47.795 --> 17:48.935
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they lay eggs like chickens.

17:50.857 --> 17:52.198
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, um...

17:52.825 --> 17:56.387
[SPEAKER_09]: I decided that because everybody was having... Oh my god, that was so creepy.

17:56.927 --> 17:57.127
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

17:57.227 --> 17:59.689
[SPEAKER_09]: The webcam, he had it pointed down the hall and it turned red.

17:59.729 --> 18:01.469
[SPEAKER_09]: It made me think of Silent Hill 4.

18:01.509 --> 18:04.271
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to what I was saying.

18:05.491 --> 18:09.433
[SPEAKER_09]: I just decided that I was going to participate and, you know, not be a pooper.

18:09.473 --> 18:14.476
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had 12 jello shots.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.859
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember kids, Orange Lounge Radio wants you to drink responsibly.

18:21.540 --> 18:22.360
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't drive.

18:23.390 --> 18:28.552
[SPEAKER_18]: I called Dan and said... See, that's the classic double standard I love about this culture.

18:28.592 --> 18:32.493
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always, you know, be sure that if you drive, you drink responsibly.

18:32.593 --> 18:34.954
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, if you didn't drive, get fucked up.

18:35.054 --> 18:35.674
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody cares.

18:35.814 --> 18:36.814
[SPEAKER_18]: You just get fucked up.

18:36.894 --> 18:37.655
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your liver.

18:38.815 --> 18:41.876
[SPEAKER_13]: Once you got your keys in the bowl, you can get fucked up.

18:42.476 --> 18:43.576
[SPEAKER_09]: My keys were in my purse.

18:43.636 --> 18:44.137
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew better.

18:44.957 --> 18:49.438
[SPEAKER_09]: But I ended up having 12 Jell-O shots because it was all low-carb stuff.

18:50.118 --> 18:51.699
[SPEAKER_09]: So vodka is low-carb.

18:53.647 --> 18:56.388
[SPEAKER_09]: We had it with sugar-free jello, so I had 12 of them.

18:57.108 --> 19:02.149
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I have this thing for vodka, I don't feel it until after I'm done with it.

19:04.970 --> 19:16.612
[SPEAKER_09]: I also had a couple glasses of this cranberry vodka beverage, and then this cranberry and orange liqueur beverage, and something else, and lots of meat.

19:18.453 --> 19:20.634
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in happy booze meat heaven.

19:23.375 --> 19:23.695
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

19:25.736 --> 19:28.137
[SPEAKER_18]: That is so like a quintessential quote for you now.

19:28.318 --> 19:30.058
[SPEAKER_18]: I was in happy booze meat heaven.

19:32.820 --> 19:33.320
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.001
[SPEAKER_18]: Please somebody note the date and time.

19:36.081 --> 19:36.441
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

19:37.862 --> 19:39.483
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our archivist in the chat room.

19:39.563 --> 19:40.143
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be at 6.50.

19:40.443 --> 19:40.823
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

19:41.864 --> 19:44.305
[SPEAKER_09]: Our archivist is in the chat room, so we'll let her handle it.

19:44.325 --> 19:45.986
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, could you write that down for the next intro?

19:46.026 --> 19:46.326
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

19:48.310 --> 19:55.033
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I also put some more thought into, I'm actually, one of my classes I finished all the homework for.

19:56.153 --> 19:56.693
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very happy.

19:57.153 --> 20:00.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Another one, I have one more week of assignments and I'm done with that class.

20:01.795 --> 20:04.296
[SPEAKER_09]: Hallelujah, praise the Lord, no more databases.

20:04.816 --> 20:07.497
[SPEAKER_09]: I spent four hours freaking working on a database today.

20:08.925 --> 20:09.826
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucks.

20:10.326 --> 20:14.108
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was also chatting with people too, which I thought was more important than doing my homework.

20:14.709 --> 20:16.670
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was really it.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.692
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go ahead and try to get the other one done Thursday ahead of time.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.053
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go ahead and get it out of the way.

20:23.334 --> 20:24.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop putting it off.

20:24.895 --> 20:26.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Although procrastination is pretty fun.

20:28.037 --> 20:30.979
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, that was my week, my day.

20:32.580 --> 20:32.920
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah!

20:33.331 --> 20:35.873
[SPEAKER_09]: I passed out at 11.30 and woke up at 6.30 in the morning.

20:36.734 --> 20:37.294
[SPEAKER_09]: And guess what?

20:37.574 --> 20:38.775
[SPEAKER_18]: You sound like me at a party.

20:39.976 --> 20:47.122
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just decided I was randomly sleepy and I just laid... I mean, I actually did consciously go to bed.

20:48.283 --> 20:50.985
[SPEAKER_09]: And then next thing I know, it's 6 in the morning.

20:51.986 --> 20:54.388
[SPEAKER_09]: I am wide awake and not hungover.

20:55.188 --> 20:56.809
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I don't think I would even drink so badly.

20:56.829 --> 20:58.251
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you should have went to church today.

20:59.351 --> 20:59.832
[SPEAKER_09]: Bite me.

21:01.173 --> 21:02.434
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, I don't know.

21:03.228 --> 21:10.072
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, I ended up wide awake, not in the least hungover.

21:11.272 --> 21:13.213
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's when I ate that chocolate.

21:14.614 --> 21:30.062
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that I would have, I think that I would not drink as wildly as I do on the rare times that I do because I don't have any consequences other than my liver going, I just don't get hungover.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.377
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming from a long line of beer drinking, you know.

21:39.318 --> 21:40.199
[SPEAKER_09]: Not me, I don't like beer.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, somebody else talk, I'm tired.

21:44.082 --> 21:46.384
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, fine, we'll move on to somebody else's weekend day.

21:46.864 --> 21:49.126
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

21:50.167 --> 21:53.129
[SPEAKER_16]: My week was okay, I was mainly hobbling around still.

21:53.590 --> 21:56.292
[SPEAKER_16]: A little better now, my toe is...

21:57.998 --> 21:58.298
[SPEAKER_16]: Epsom salts

22:13.823 --> 22:14.724
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:38.311 --> 22:39.671
[SPEAKER_16]: Literally, you know what the movie's about.

22:40.012 --> 22:42.112
[SPEAKER_16]: You've already seen the entire story in the movie.

22:43.713 --> 22:50.075
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I watched Ju-On, which is, for those who don't know it, the Japanese version of the movie coming out called The Grudge.

22:50.995 --> 22:54.776
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you've seen that movie, then you've seen The Grudge already.

22:55.497 --> 23:00.078
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's pretty much, from what I've seen in the trailers, exactly the same shots.

23:00.198 --> 23:00.738
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

23:01.319 --> 23:02.599
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say something about that.

23:03.539 --> 23:10.446
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the trailer for Ringu and The Ring had all the same identical scenes, and there was a lot different about the movies.

23:10.847 --> 23:18.074
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the only thing that's going to be different, I think, is one, it's probably going to be linear, because Ju-on was fucking hard to follow.

23:18.294 --> 23:19.536
[SPEAKER_16]: It just kept skipping around.

23:19.556 --> 23:21.257
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, what the hell is going on here?

23:23.081 --> 23:29.745
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, my only complaint about it is, how can people be that dumb to walk into a haunted house, like, constantly?

23:29.965 --> 23:35.489
[SPEAKER_16]: They're like, yeah, so we know that every single person that's gone through this house has disappeared, so I'm gonna go inside that house!

23:36.609 --> 23:37.910
[SPEAKER_09]: Save on the, uh, tax.

23:38.210 --> 23:45.255
[SPEAKER_16]: And then at the very end of the movie, they, like, show something that's kinda, I guess, would be, like, a way to ward off whatever it is.

23:46.536 --> 23:50.438
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, like, not even 30 seconds later, another ghost comes.

23:51.385 --> 23:56.496
[SPEAKER_16]: and the woman doesn't do the thing that wore it off the first one and then she disappears.

23:57.137 --> 24:00.685
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, how can you not see that?

24:01.636 --> 24:02.397
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:24.625 --> 24:25.586
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:54.504 --> 24:55.605
[SPEAKER_16]: This is quite weird.

24:56.545 --> 24:59.467
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um... So, that was a cool movie.

25:00.127 --> 25:04.810
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, other than that, I got, um... I don't know, I played more Final Fantasy.

25:05.751 --> 25:07.552
[SPEAKER_16]: And I bought some new CDs.

25:07.592 --> 25:10.774
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought, um... Stephen Lynch's CD.

25:11.074 --> 25:11.554
[SPEAKER_16]: He's funny.

25:12.075 --> 25:15.597
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, um... BT, 10 years in the... What was it?

25:15.617 --> 25:20.119
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like, um... 10 years... Oh, 10 years in the life.

25:20.399 --> 25:21.240
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was, um...

25:22.483 --> 25:32.245
[SPEAKER_16]: like a compilation of his best works plus some new stuff I haven't heard of BT and remixes that he did including Crystal Method remix that he did and that was kind of cool.

25:33.166 --> 25:37.907
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, really not all that much went on.

25:38.147 --> 25:44.128
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a little bit of movies and hobbling and still didn't finish the device.

25:44.148 --> 25:45.448
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm working on it.

25:45.548 --> 25:48.429
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I got Sims 2 and I was torturing Sims.

25:48.729 --> 25:49.269
[SPEAKER_16]: That was fun.

25:49.709 --> 25:51.970
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing about that game though is that um

25:53.206 --> 25:54.706
[SPEAKER_16]: It has really slow fires.

25:54.847 --> 25:59.248
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I started a fire in my kitchen and it took it about two days to finally get across the kitchen.

26:01.108 --> 26:08.611
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, it's cool because the fire department can't come even though I have smoke detectors because I have a motor around my house and there's no way in or out.

26:09.531 --> 26:19.434
[SPEAKER_16]: But, if you're interested in what I thought about The Sims 2, you can check out my review on OrangeLoungeRadio.com which we have reviews for other games on there too.

26:22.045 --> 26:34.028
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, actually, Jason and I are talking about plans to try and expand the reviews section a little later, too, because I want to do a full review of DDR Extreme, although I am going to have a mini-review of DDR Extreme showing up in the very near future somewhere else.

26:34.868 --> 26:36.589
[SPEAKER_18]: So, maybe we'll talk about that later, I don't know.

26:37.789 --> 26:39.350
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else you want to share about your weekend today?

26:41.730 --> 26:44.211
[SPEAKER_16]: Um... I don't think so.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.011
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's it.

26:46.812 --> 26:48.012
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Bradley, how was your week?

26:48.032 --> 26:48.472
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your day?

26:49.672 --> 26:51.493
[SPEAKER_17]: It was pretty boring, uh,

26:52.196 --> 26:53.337
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

27:22.469 --> 27:24.410
[SPEAKER_17]: And then after that, not much.

27:24.831 --> 27:25.991
[SPEAKER_17]: This weekend didn't do very much.

27:27.392 --> 27:28.253
[SPEAKER_17]: Did my state taxes?

27:28.353 --> 27:28.793
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh boy.

27:30.495 --> 27:34.157
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you can wait until October if you don't owe anything.

27:35.058 --> 27:36.359
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's about it.

27:37.459 --> 27:37.799
[SPEAKER_17]: Right on.

27:37.940 --> 27:38.320
[SPEAKER_17]: Exciting.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.601
[SPEAKER_18]: My week and my day.

27:41.382 --> 27:43.924
[SPEAKER_18]: Like Jamie, I was kind of a party animal this weekend.

27:44.344 --> 27:45.765
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to a party Friday night.

27:46.341 --> 27:50.783
[SPEAKER_18]: My friend John had a birthday, so I went over to his house for a birthday party, and I went with a bunch of my friends.

27:51.464 --> 27:54.145
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, I didn't really get a chance to drink a whole lot.

27:54.185 --> 27:59.427
[SPEAKER_18]: I did like a shot or two, but I didn't get quite as comfortable as Jamie did at the party she went to.

27:59.808 --> 28:00.408
[SPEAKER_18]: But it was a good time.

28:00.448 --> 28:02.089
[SPEAKER_18]: I met a lot of really nice new people.

28:03.129 --> 28:05.050
[SPEAKER_18]: I met this one girl who was really into anime.

28:05.070 --> 28:10.813
[SPEAKER_18]: She seemed like she'd be somebody who might like this show, so hopefully I remembered to plug the show with her, but I don't remember.

28:11.589 --> 28:28.285
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, and just, you know, a lot of cool people there, and we just had a good time laughing, hanging out, and then yesterday I actually decided to drive to my old hometown, I lived there for three years, where I went to school, in Chico, California, which is about an hour northeast.

28:28.905 --> 28:56.948
[SPEAKER_18]: about an hour and a half north of Sacramento where this show is based which is a little college town there really isn't anything in Chico, California except a college and retired people so it's this interesting mix of people but I had myself a good time I never really enjoyed the place while I lived there but now that I'm just a visitor I actually have a lot of fun every time I go I went to this bar and I actually got a little drunk which wasn't a good idea since I had driven so I had to wait around until like

28:57.780 --> 28:59.021
[SPEAKER_18]: 2, 3am so I could sober up.

28:59.882 --> 29:03.864
[SPEAKER_18]: But we went to this bar and I just danced like crazy.

29:03.924 --> 29:04.564
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what it was.

29:04.665 --> 29:06.486
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just totally dancing like crazy.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.047
[SPEAKER_18]: Flailing my arms about and jumping.

29:08.387 --> 29:13.110
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I saw this guy and this girl were dancing next to me.

29:13.430 --> 29:21.775
[SPEAKER_18]: And the girl at one point hopped up on the guy's shoulders and the guy was doing all these dirty things to the girl and then the girl started leaning back.

29:21.795 --> 29:25.017
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a really bad scene out of the pool scene in Showgirls.

29:25.117 --> 29:25.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I was just

29:26.599 --> 29:27.780
[SPEAKER_04]: The way you were describing that...

29:51.690 --> 29:55.774
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember they played Sandstorm, was one song they played, and I was like, I'll dance into that.

29:55.814 --> 29:59.937
[SPEAKER_18]: And they had played Better Off Alone, which isn't a DDR song, but it really should be, you know.

30:00.237 --> 30:00.798
[SPEAKER_15]: It's classic.

30:00.858 --> 30:01.198
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

30:01.859 --> 30:04.061
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I was just having a good time, so.

30:07.654 --> 30:11.676
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that I actually dance like DDR because that really is not the point.

30:14.218 --> 30:15.359
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, it's still kind of fun.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.260
[SPEAKER_18]: And I guess that's really it.

30:18.620 --> 30:19.981
[SPEAKER_18]: I just kind of partied a lot this weekend.

30:20.021 --> 30:25.004
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going out tonight to a club again, so I'm kind of being a little... But tonight I'm going back to the goth club.

30:25.905 --> 30:28.326
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I had a lot of fun last time I was there, so I'm going again tonight.

30:28.626 --> 30:30.867
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to go act all morbid and... Yes.

30:30.887 --> 30:33.569
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to paint my nails black and look like I have dead eyes.

30:33.629 --> 30:34.069
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm kidding.

30:34.430 --> 30:36.090
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just going to go have fun.

30:36.771 --> 30:36.851
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

30:37.972 --> 30:41.135
[SPEAKER_09]: You should go to the goth club and wear like yellow.

30:42.516 --> 30:43.216
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I should.

30:43.917 --> 30:47.019
[SPEAKER_09]: Go dress like a cheerleader or something.

30:47.099 --> 30:48.440
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, they'd probably think that was cool.

30:51.362 --> 30:53.184
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd be the evil cheerleader.

30:53.644 --> 30:53.924
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

30:54.305 --> 30:55.245
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, it's funny.

30:55.566 --> 30:59.789
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I know you don't like going to dance clubs, but if you like dance clubs, you would like this one.

31:00.849 --> 31:04.392
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'd have to go sometime just to stand in the corner and look, you know, evil.

31:04.592 --> 31:06.834
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well that's what a lot of people do, actually, yeah.

31:06.854 --> 31:08.455
[SPEAKER_09]: You just stand there looking for it.

31:08.475 --> 31:10.557
[SPEAKER_18]: You fit right in, I swear, you fit right in.

31:10.577 --> 31:15.721
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the prerequisite for being goth, you have to be able to stand around and look bored.

31:17.403 --> 31:18.323
[SPEAKER_09]: And wear lots of black.

31:19.985 --> 31:22.907
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's how it was with all the people I hung out with.

31:23.387 --> 31:28.572
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember the goth club, that's where the big hairy guy in the corset wanted to have sex with me.

31:30.033 --> 31:30.233
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

31:31.519 --> 31:32.280
[SPEAKER_18]: We're bears.

31:32.460 --> 31:33.040
[SPEAKER_18]: Grr.

31:33.621 --> 31:37.283
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, it's because I thought of this movie I saw on Thursday.

31:37.303 --> 31:38.904
[SPEAKER_18]: I went and saw a movie called A Dirty Shame.

31:39.225 --> 31:43.047
[SPEAKER_18]: And for those that know me well at all, I'm a huge John Waters fan.

31:43.087 --> 31:44.668
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't know who John Waters is, you should.

31:45.009 --> 31:46.510
[SPEAKER_18]: He directed Hairspray.

31:46.610 --> 31:47.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Hairspray.

31:47.110 --> 31:48.451
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, back before it was a musical.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.993
[SPEAKER_18]: But, like, Hairspray is, like, very tame for his movies.

31:51.033 --> 31:54.555
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm talking movies like Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom, Desperate Living.

31:54.575 --> 31:55.536
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are all the ones I really like.

31:55.736 --> 31:56.757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't seen Serial Mom.

31:57.782 --> 31:58.323
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you should.

31:58.383 --> 31:59.424
[SPEAKER_18]: Serial Mom's a wonderful movie.

31:59.464 --> 32:03.047
[SPEAKER_18]: But he has a new movie in theaters called The Dirty Shame, and it's a total sex comedy.

32:03.127 --> 32:03.687
[SPEAKER_18]: It's NC-17.

32:03.807 --> 32:07.010
[SPEAKER_18]: It is just absolutely perverse.

32:07.631 --> 32:09.652
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know why I was thinking of that movie just now, but I was.

32:10.753 --> 32:18.660
[SPEAKER_18]: I do recommend it, even though, seriously, the last 30 minutes of the film, whoever wrote the script was so coked up that it makes absolutely no sense.

32:21.062 --> 32:21.843
[SPEAKER_18]: Just being honest with you.

32:24.699 --> 32:27.260
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, on that note, let's go back to our show.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.620
[SPEAKER_18]: www.orangezonesradio.com Click on chat if you want to join the chat room.

32:30.940 --> 32:33.341
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, Skype line will be open up a little bit later.

32:33.621 --> 32:35.881
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on interact with us if you want to interact with the show.

32:35.981 --> 32:41.043
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, as promised a little bit earlier, I have the sequel to an inside joke.

32:41.423 --> 32:43.603
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is actually one of our new inside jokes.

32:43.663 --> 32:51.185
[SPEAKER_18]: But do you remember a couple weeks ago when we had a little bit of a flub up from Tom Brokaw and he was doing the bukake thing?

32:51.525 --> 32:51.585
Mmm...

32:54.207 --> 32:57.669
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it actually came to my attention.

32:57.749 --> 32:59.209
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually in the intro.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.831
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually came to my attention at the party I was at on Friday.

33:01.911 --> 33:05.612
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason, you know, I was talking about the Bukkake.

33:05.632 --> 33:06.573
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how it came up.

33:06.993 --> 33:09.574
[SPEAKER_18]: But somebody told me, said, hey Rob, you know what?

33:10.235 --> 33:11.975
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not the first time he's done that.

33:12.275 --> 33:15.157
[SPEAKER_18]: He actually flubbed up once before and they told me where to go.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.498
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is old news.

33:17.538 --> 33:21.760
[SPEAKER_18]: This flub up is like a year old, but I swear it's twice as funny.

33:22.429 --> 33:23.190
[SPEAKER_18]: So listen to this.

33:23.250 --> 33:25.552
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little bit long, but listen carefully.

33:25.993 --> 33:27.354
[SPEAKER_18]: Listen carefully for the mistake.

33:29.136 --> 33:36.419
[SPEAKER_01]: The president's trip to Ohio today was a bold effort to cash in on his wartime popularity as he tries to push through his tax cuts.

33:36.799 --> 33:40.900
[SPEAKER_01]: The key component, and what the president insists, is a job stimulus program.

33:41.341 --> 33:44.842
[SPEAKER_01]: Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.

33:45.282 --> 33:55.206
[SPEAKER_01]: And as NBC's David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cuts are the answer.

34:01.384 --> 34:02.185
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you hear that?

34:03.405 --> 34:04.245
[SPEAKER_24]: My God.

34:04.985 --> 34:05.885
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, one more time.

34:05.905 --> 34:08.066
[SPEAKER_24]: Rob's over there doing the little schoolgirl giggle.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.266
[SPEAKER_14]: One more time, one more time.

34:10.566 --> 34:21.249
[SPEAKER_01]: The president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts... Tax cunts?

34:21.349 --> 34:22.529
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so funny.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.790
[SPEAKER_18]: It's funny when serious news people make big mistakes like that.

34:27.910 --> 34:28.190
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean...

34:31.560 --> 34:32.141
[SPEAKER_03]: You would find that funny.

34:32.161 --> 34:34.903
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, how many times do you hear the word cunt on the nightly news?

34:34.983 --> 34:35.443
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

34:35.743 --> 34:37.965
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is not convinced of tax cuts?

34:42.369 --> 34:46.312
[SPEAKER_18]: That absolutely has nothing to do with Bomani and it has nothing to do with video gaming whatsoever.

34:46.432 --> 34:48.914
[SPEAKER_24]: It has to do with Rob having a giggle fit.

34:49.094 --> 34:50.295
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really fucking funny.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.937
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I've thought of that phrase several times today.

34:52.997 --> 34:54.138
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I'll just be sitting there.

34:54.458 --> 34:58.781
[SPEAKER_18]: I was sitting there at dinner earlier today and I was just eating and then suddenly I just had these images.

34:58.981 --> 35:00.943
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is not convinced of tax cuts?

35:01.727 --> 35:02.707
[SPEAKER_18]: And I started giggling.

35:06.769 --> 35:07.729
[SPEAKER_18]: God bless the internet.

35:09.830 --> 35:13.271
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll post that sound file on our forums a little later, just like I did the Bukkake thing.

35:16.492 --> 35:17.132
[SPEAKER_15]: That was beautiful.

35:24.675 --> 35:25.916
[SPEAKER_19]: See, what did I tell you, chat room?

35:26.216 --> 35:26.676
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you think?

35:26.736 --> 35:28.516
[SPEAKER_19]: Was that better than Bukkake?

35:28.536 --> 35:29.837
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they think so.

35:30.511 --> 35:33.272
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm getting a lot of ha-ha-has, so I guess they like that.

35:33.653 --> 35:35.713
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like a year old, but I had never heard of that.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.854
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it was new to me, so I figured it would be new to you guys, too.

35:38.695 --> 35:39.515
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't hear about that.

35:39.975 --> 35:40.896
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe you guys did, I don't know.

35:40.936 --> 35:43.457
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people in the world who do not pay attention to the news.

35:43.897 --> 35:44.697
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I know.

35:46.318 --> 35:46.598
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

35:49.740 --> 35:57.283
[SPEAKER_18]: And in case you don't know what a cunt is, because it looks like someone in our chatroom doesn't know, a cunt is a euphemism for a lady's

35:59.623 --> 35:59.943
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

36:00.023 --> 36:00.523
[SPEAKER_26]: Anatomy.

36:00.623 --> 36:01.044
[SPEAKER_18]: Anatomy.

36:01.884 --> 36:02.644
[SPEAKER_18]: Take that as you will.

36:02.684 --> 36:02.984
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

36:04.224 --> 36:08.545
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's change topics really quick here before I get into stuff too far.

36:08.805 --> 36:11.345
[SPEAKER_18]: And actually, we will do a Bomani-related piece here.

36:13.506 --> 36:14.486
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, Ultramix 2.

36:14.526 --> 36:16.626
[SPEAKER_18]: There's some brand new news on Ultramix 2 this week.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.747
[SPEAKER_18]: A brand new song was revealed.

36:19.447 --> 36:21.187
[SPEAKER_18]: And the band is Delirium.

36:21.447 --> 36:23.048
[SPEAKER_18]: And the song is called After All.

36:23.448 --> 36:24.368
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's remixed...

36:25.166 --> 36:29.707
[SPEAKER_18]: It's remixed by a couple guys who did a really popular song in 7th style.

36:30.107 --> 36:31.388
[SPEAKER_09]: I did do that in a cage match.

36:31.508 --> 36:34.869
[SPEAKER_18]: And you actually, yeah, you put this song in a cage match one time.

36:34.889 --> 36:35.929
[SPEAKER_09]: I won the cage match with it.

36:35.969 --> 36:41.730
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the really interesting thing is now this is the first, now where was the Orange Lounge Radio cage match based on?

36:41.790 --> 36:45.351
[SPEAKER_18]: We originally said it was like songs that we want to hear in DDR.

36:45.511 --> 36:51.353
[SPEAKER_18]: And lo and behold, we have our very first cage match winning song that is now in a DDR game.

36:52.100 --> 36:52.780
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm prophetic.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.141
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm prophetic.

36:53.161 --> 36:53.801
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm prophetic.

36:54.061 --> 36:54.742
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm prophetic.

36:54.762 --> 36:55.222
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm prophetic.

37:23.612 --> 37:24.394
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody knows that song.

37:24.414 --> 37:25.236
[SPEAKER_18]: You like that song, right?

37:25.297 --> 37:26.039
[SPEAKER_18]: The one from 2DX?

37:26.339 --> 37:28.545
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, those guys, Svensson and Ghislaine, remixed...

37:29.309 --> 37:31.310
[SPEAKER_18]: A Delirium song, and it's going to be in DDR Ultimate's tune.

37:31.330 --> 37:32.011
[SPEAKER_18]: We are going to play it.

37:32.251 --> 37:35.032
[SPEAKER_18]: The clue stumped everybody for a long, long time.

37:35.352 --> 37:36.513
[SPEAKER_18]: But actually, I'm really proud.

37:36.593 --> 37:39.955
[SPEAKER_18]: One of our news guys, Dark Tetsuya, was the one that finally solved the clue.

37:40.455 --> 37:43.657
[SPEAKER_18]: And the way he figured it out was, finally, he did a Google search.

37:44.057 --> 37:49.220
[SPEAKER_18]: There were these two guys on the picture that Jason Enos had posted in the DDR Freak thread.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.181
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, not Jason.

37:50.201 --> 37:50.781
[SPEAKER_18]: What am I thinking?

37:50.801 --> 37:51.081
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

37:51.121 --> 37:54.803
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody that worked at the company or somebody there had posted in the DDR Freak thread.

37:54.823 --> 37:55.304
[SPEAKER_18]: What am I thinking?

37:55.884 --> 37:55.924
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

37:56.716 --> 38:00.417
[SPEAKER_18]: about these two guys that were like gay guys or something.

38:00.897 --> 38:03.478
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody was like... Thunderpuss?

38:03.718 --> 38:05.199
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was like, who are these?

38:05.219 --> 38:07.120
[SPEAKER_18]: They're like gay guys or something like that, right?

38:08.780 --> 38:13.522
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody was assuming that the guys were gay, and they were totally wrong.

38:13.602 --> 38:17.163
[SPEAKER_18]: They just happened to be Svensson and Geelan, but nobody thought to search for Svensson and Geelan.

38:17.603 --> 38:19.764
[SPEAKER_18]: So, very interesting, huh?

38:22.145 --> 38:22.405
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

38:23.283 --> 38:28.509
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it's kind of funny because I didn't even realize it when I was doing the show a couple weeks ago.

38:29.350 --> 38:33.215
[SPEAKER_09]: And I played another version I have of After All.

38:33.996 --> 38:38.281
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually on the Delirium's best, I think it was.

38:39.122 --> 38:41.124
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is it.

38:41.645 --> 38:43.147
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that both versions are on here.

38:47.235 --> 38:53.377
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, no, it's not on this one, but it's on another Delirium CD that I have that has both versions of it.

38:57.618 --> 38:59.358
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're going to play that song for you guys.

38:59.658 --> 39:04.700
[SPEAKER_18]: And after that, we'll play, I guess we'll play the whole Beauty of Silence so you guys can hear it.

39:06.126 --> 39:27.787
[SPEAKER_18]: and then we'll come back with the show but I know you guys may not have all heard this song yet sometimes people look to us to play the new Ultramix 2 songs for you guys so we're going to play it for you guys right now and when we come back there's more news about Ultramix 2 I want to get into this is on everybody's mind this week and I have a lot I want to say about it too as well so here we go this is Delirium with After All

39:28.427 --> 39:29.807
[SPEAKER_18]: Spencer and GhilaMix, new for Ultramix 2.

39:30.067 --> 39:30.288
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy!

40:49.169 --> 40:49.722
Thanks for watching!

41:38.583 --> 41:39.369
Thank you for watching!

42:31.881 --> 42:32.282
and more.

43:06.597 --> 43:08.338
Thanks for watching!

43:32.834 --> 43:33.955
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

44:32.205 --> 44:33.166
[SPEAKER_18]: Gaming Radio.

44:33.406 --> 44:38.390
[SPEAKER_18]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

44:40.291 --> 44:42.213
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio.

44:45.816 --> 44:47.837
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

44:47.857 --> 44:48.618
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awful.

44:49.158 --> 44:50.839
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to beat that joke in the ground.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.080
[SPEAKER_18]: Just you wait.

44:52.541 --> 44:54.062
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awful.

44:54.082 --> 44:55.383
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.

44:56.144 --> 44:56.564
[SPEAKER_18]: Beautiful.

44:58.345 --> 44:59.526
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Honest Radio.

44:59.546 --> 45:03.207
[SPEAKER_18]: Hope you enjoyed that little sneak peek there at Delirium with After All.

45:04.768 --> 45:05.848
[SPEAKER_18]: Gonna be in Ultramix 2.

45:06.349 --> 45:09.050
[SPEAKER_18]: How many more songs they have to announce for Ultramix 2 still?

45:09.090 --> 45:09.590
[SPEAKER_18]: Like what, like 150?

45:09.630 --> 45:11.671
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't, like how many songs?

45:11.831 --> 45:15.473
[SPEAKER_18]: There's an ungodly amount of songs they still haven't even told us for Ultramix 2.

45:15.793 --> 45:17.834
[SPEAKER_18]: At least, at least like what, 40?

45:18.314 --> 45:19.515
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, I don't even remember.

45:19.595 --> 45:22.036
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't been, I haven't been doing my math very well, so.

45:23.251 --> 45:26.473
[SPEAKER_18]: But there's a lot of new songs still coming for Ultramix 2, and that's just the beginning.

45:26.853 --> 45:29.655
[SPEAKER_18]: I really like that song, and I can't wait to play it in Ultramix 2.

45:29.735 --> 45:31.616
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you gotta be excited about that one, Jamie.

45:33.618 --> 45:34.999
[SPEAKER_18]: You called it, in a way.

45:35.019 --> 45:35.279
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

45:36.099 --> 45:36.820
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so awesome.

45:40.122 --> 45:40.402
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

45:41.143 --> 45:43.084
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, Ultramix 2 news this week.

45:43.464 --> 45:43.845
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a...

45:46.104 --> 45:55.867
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a video posted on the internet, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of this by now, but if you haven't, run on over to our website, orangeloungeradio.com, and it's the second story down on our site right now.

45:55.887 --> 45:58.188
[SPEAKER_18]: It talks about the Ultramix 2 quad mode video.

45:58.608 --> 45:59.068
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

45:59.608 --> 46:03.509
[SPEAKER_18]: A video was posted on the internet that shows quad mode in action.

46:04.669 --> 46:05.170
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, excuse me.

46:05.410 --> 46:06.190
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a little burpy today.

46:06.810 --> 46:13.492
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and quad mode is that mode now on DDR that you have not one, not two, not three, but four dance pads all lined up in a row, and you're dancing...

46:13.996 --> 46:16.177
[SPEAKER_18]: Back and forth across all four dancepads.

46:17.118 --> 46:18.859
[SPEAKER_18]: And this video was posted on the internet of this mode.

46:19.219 --> 46:21.340
[SPEAKER_18]: And you probably haven't seen this yet, DarkSakura, have you?

46:21.781 --> 46:21.841
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

46:22.181 --> 46:22.781
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me show you this.

46:23.001 --> 46:34.488
[SPEAKER_18]: Because actually, what really is causing up a storm here, it has nothing to do really with the quad mode itself, but it has everything to do with how the game actually looks.

46:35.289 --> 46:37.330
[SPEAKER_18]: So you definitely want to check this out here.

46:38.450 --> 46:40.592
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if we can get the video up here...

46:43.551 --> 46:45.433
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I gotta give it a minute, it's gonna load up here.

46:48.137 --> 46:49.819
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless I saved it to the desktop or something.

46:51.021 --> 46:55.607
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, it takes just as long to copy it over as it would to download it, so I'm stuck now.

46:58.030 --> 46:59.232
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, it's coming, it's coming, hold on.

47:02.418 --> 47:09.262
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, this is definitely generating a lot of buzz in the DDR community right now, because we really haven't heard a whole lot about Ultramix 2 outside of Songlist.

47:09.743 --> 47:13.725
[SPEAKER_18]: And the game's only like, what, six weeks away, supposedly, from what we've heard?

47:13.805 --> 47:14.605
[SPEAKER_18]: Six weeks away from release?

47:14.665 --> 47:15.426
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, here we go, here it is.

47:15.886 --> 47:16.467
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's the video.

47:16.947 --> 47:20.369
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me, uh... It's a clip of Ride on the Lights.

47:24.335 --> 47:32.658
[SPEAKER_18]: So look at that, there's all these brand new videos, there's like a motorcycle thing that's all brand new, everything looks like futuristic, like all these new videos.

47:33.718 --> 47:37.399
[SPEAKER_18]: And then of course, you know, quad mode pretty much looks the way you would expect it to.

47:39.560 --> 47:44.581
[SPEAKER_18]: But Rage has a new model, look at that, Rage looks completely different, like he's got like really poofy hair.

47:45.021 --> 47:46.862
[SPEAKER_18]: He looks like me in the morning, kind of, with that hair.

47:49.781 --> 47:51.823
[SPEAKER_19]: and his motions are much different.

47:51.863 --> 47:54.985
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw this though at E3 that all of the characters had new models.

47:55.265 --> 47:56.927
[SPEAKER_19]: And now he's doing like cartwheels and stuff.

47:57.507 --> 47:58.708
[SPEAKER_19]: Like totally different dances.

47:58.768 --> 47:59.288
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

47:59.929 --> 48:02.811
[SPEAKER_09]: Well no, we saw it at E3.

48:03.371 --> 48:04.552
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw Emi's hoochie model.

48:04.953 --> 48:07.194
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, but the thing is that actually this video shows you.

48:07.214 --> 48:08.075
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be the other video.

48:08.095 --> 48:10.457
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me bring... Yeah, if I bring up the other video...

48:11.545 --> 48:16.808
[SPEAKER_09]: I still don't get pantsless rage They need hoochified characters for download I'm telling ya

48:40.605 --> 48:45.408
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to hire a model of Mr. Spanky.

48:47.490 --> 48:48.631
[SPEAKER_18]: Look, Emi's back to normal there.

48:48.651 --> 48:49.892
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a three-player mode.

48:54.315 --> 48:56.937
[SPEAKER_18]: And you see multiple dancers kind of going at one time there.

48:56.957 --> 49:01.741
[SPEAKER_18]: You've got Afro, and you've got Rage and Emi all dancing in this one.

49:01.901 --> 49:03.122
[SPEAKER_18]: Like a three-player dance mode.

49:04.537 --> 49:05.698
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all doing ballet.

49:06.518 --> 49:09.760
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we need to like stop coloring them up in seconds.

49:09.900 --> 49:19.086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of all these little insane little... Anyway, you can kind of get a... I can't see Emi.

49:19.266 --> 49:19.726
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't see Emi?

49:19.746 --> 49:20.147
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, hold up.

49:20.547 --> 49:20.967
[SPEAKER_18]: There's Emi.

49:21.587 --> 49:22.348
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, it's her fourth mix.

49:22.368 --> 49:23.028
[SPEAKER_26]: She spun by.

49:23.228 --> 49:24.789
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's her fourth mix costume.

49:27.351 --> 49:27.871
[SPEAKER_18]: Kind of see her.

49:27.891 --> 49:29.072
[SPEAKER_18]: She's got a little hat and stuff.

49:30.444 --> 49:32.064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she did be Hoochie Fighter, that's cool.

49:32.324 --> 49:32.985
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so.

49:33.365 --> 49:40.286
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave her just like this utter Hoochie version of the 4th Mix outfit, and that was just kind of wrong.

49:41.787 --> 49:46.508
[SPEAKER_09]: It was not, you would think it's cool.

49:46.608 --> 49:51.769
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway, lots of reaction in the Bomani community going on to those videos now.

49:53.303 --> 50:01.669
[SPEAKER_18]: I usually don't talk about certain posts on certain websites, but there was one post that really just got my panties in a bunch, to be honest.

50:02.330 --> 50:10.596
[SPEAKER_18]: And this guy came out of the blue and just started dogging on the quad mode video saying, those steps are horrible.

50:11.784 --> 50:12.925
[SPEAKER_18]: And we all know this would happen.

50:14.025 --> 50:18.686
[SPEAKER_18]: We've told Sigurd, we've told Mel, when they were here on the show before, we said, you know what, people are going to hate the steps.

50:18.866 --> 50:22.207
[SPEAKER_18]: We hate to say it to you guys, but that's the first thing people are going to bag on when Ultimix 2 comes out.

50:22.267 --> 50:23.788
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sure the steps are great.

50:24.028 --> 50:27.149
[SPEAKER_18]: They're awesome, but there's always going to be somebody that doesn't like the steps.

50:27.489 --> 50:33.830
[SPEAKER_18]: And sure enough, this guy comes out of the woodwork and just starts dogging on the steps, saying they're horrible for a standard mode.

50:33.850 --> 50:34.511
[SPEAKER_13]: What are they doing?

50:36.591 --> 50:37.351
[SPEAKER_18]: All this bullshit.

50:38.192 --> 50:38.932
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just thinking...

50:39.758 --> 50:41.339
[SPEAKER_18]: Get a load of this guy, you know, whatever.

50:41.680 --> 50:42.981
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody's welcome to their opinion.

50:43.762 --> 50:51.548
[SPEAKER_19]: But then, I found out, after some more posts went by, that this guy had done some of the step charts for In The Groove.

50:53.370 --> 50:54.391
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sitting here going...

50:55.427 --> 50:57.089
[SPEAKER_18]: Who the fuck are you?

50:57.229 --> 50:58.250
[SPEAKER_18]: Get off your high horse.

50:58.290 --> 50:59.111
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, seriously.

50:59.572 --> 51:01.614
[SPEAKER_18]: I talked about In The Groove here last week on the show.

51:01.834 --> 51:02.855
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a nice game.

51:02.895 --> 51:04.677
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a cute alternative to DDR.

51:04.757 --> 51:07.540
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a replacement for DDR, but it's something else fun to play.

51:07.580 --> 51:10.123
[SPEAKER_18]: But the steps are not all that, okay?

51:10.243 --> 51:15.549
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, they've got some neat new ideas, but they're no better or worse than what we got right now.

51:15.609 --> 51:16.450
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, God.

51:17.093 --> 51:18.414
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just kind of like, God, get over yourself.

51:18.474 --> 51:36.001
[SPEAKER_18]: I just think that's in poor taste, because when you're representing a company like that, especially when you've got all these questionable legal issues going around, for you to go and start dogging on the enemy game, I mean, it just makes you look like you had a vendetta from the start, your opinions don't mean shit, and it just makes your whole game look shitty.

51:36.061 --> 51:42.064
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there was a point earlier this week where I was like, I'm going to come on Sunday's show, I'm going to take back everything nice I said about In The Groove, because that guy's pissed me off.

51:42.864 --> 51:44.305
[SPEAKER_18]: I've calmed down a little bit since then.

51:44.345 --> 51:46.626
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to take back everything nice I said about In The Groove, but

51:47.679 --> 51:50.000
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, seriously, what a lack of class.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.221
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I take back everything nice you said about this?

51:52.361 --> 51:53.241
[SPEAKER_18]: You can say whatever you want.

51:53.261 --> 51:53.982
[SPEAKER_09]: I take it back for Rob.

51:58.944 --> 52:00.865
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kind of surprised there's no reaction from our chat room.

52:00.905 --> 52:02.545
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought half of them were following what was going on.

52:02.565 --> 52:03.086
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

52:03.106 --> 52:06.667
[SPEAKER_09]: We still got people fixated on you talking about getting your panties in a bunch.

52:09.228 --> 52:10.629
[SPEAKER_18]: You know.

52:10.909 --> 52:11.789
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of this, Loki?

52:11.809 --> 52:14.951
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you're kind of more sim scene oriented than us.

52:15.011 --> 52:15.651
[SPEAKER_18]: So what did you think of this?

52:16.500 --> 52:17.641
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I didn't read the post.

52:19.562 --> 52:21.924
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably for the best, to be honest, probably for the best.

52:22.545 --> 52:25.287
[SPEAKER_16]: I just hate people bitching about shit that they haven't seen yet.

52:25.847 --> 52:27.408
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, they're so awful!

52:27.629 --> 52:28.549
[SPEAKER_16]: The game's not out yet.

52:29.630 --> 52:30.511
[SPEAKER_16]: But I can tell!

52:30.871 --> 52:32.032
[SPEAKER_16]: I have ESP!

52:32.973 --> 52:33.793
[SPEAKER_16]: That's like, god.

52:33.813 --> 52:35.895
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because they're psycho and have ESP.

52:35.955 --> 52:44.982
[SPEAKER_16]: If only he knew, if only he knew, I can't say, if only he knew, he couldn't really say anything, because it's just, you know...

52:45.731 --> 52:46.992
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

53:01.857 --> 53:03.378
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

53:22.831 --> 53:24.271
[SPEAKER_18]: to get this game done for us.

53:25.352 --> 53:26.752
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's just totally disrespectful.

53:27.652 --> 53:35.074
[SPEAKER_18]: Honestly, if this guy had nothing to do with the other game, I don't think it would be such a big deal because you could just write it off as, well, there's always going to be one heckler.

53:35.314 --> 53:42.675
[SPEAKER_18]: But the fact that he represents, because he worked with this other game, he therefore represents that other game, it just shows an utter lack of class.

53:42.715 --> 53:44.916
[SPEAKER_18]: It just disgusts me.

53:45.156 --> 53:51.477
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not even a fact that he represents the other game because, I mean, let's just say he was the guy that was doing the art for the backgrounds for, like, you know, their...

53:52.077 --> 53:53.237
[SPEAKER_16]: Game, you know, songs or whatever.

53:53.517 --> 53:54.478
[SPEAKER_16]: That wouldn't even be so bad.

53:54.518 --> 53:57.078
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's the guy that did some of the step charts.

53:57.318 --> 53:58.239
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's even worse.

53:59.239 --> 54:02.720
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm getting told in the chat room, hey, don't put in the groove down because of one guy.

54:02.900 --> 54:05.360
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what?

54:05.780 --> 54:09.321
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said, I was going to come in here and say a lot of nasty things about it, but I decided not to.

54:09.361 --> 54:10.122
[SPEAKER_18]: But here's the problem.

54:10.642 --> 54:19.624
[SPEAKER_18]: When this guy who works on the game can't show any class at all, or any sense of respect at all for what's going on, you know, on the other half of the fence...

54:20.524 --> 54:23.967
[SPEAKER_18]: It does bring the whole image of everybody on the staff down.

54:24.047 --> 54:26.028
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sure there's some wonderful people that work on the game.

54:26.048 --> 54:27.049
[SPEAKER_18]: There's wonderful people that play the game.

54:27.069 --> 54:27.929
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no doubt about that.

54:28.370 --> 54:31.072
[SPEAKER_18]: But one bad apple is can't spoil a barrel.

54:31.352 --> 54:40.939
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like if anybody out there that uses an orange lounge banner in their signature, I would expect that you're not a fucking asshat in your post because you're kind of representing our station.

54:41.259 --> 54:44.241
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you were starting to be an asshole in your post, I would call you on it.

54:44.281 --> 54:44.782
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say, you know what?

54:44.802 --> 54:46.743
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't use our banner anymore if you're going to act like an ass.

54:47.183 --> 54:49.365
[SPEAKER_18]: Luckily, nice people use our banner, so we don't have that problem.

54:49.835 --> 54:55.499
[SPEAKER_18]: But when you're representing another company, I'm sorry, but when you act like an ass, it makes everybody look like an ass.

55:00.323 --> 55:00.583
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

55:01.264 --> 55:02.545
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I completely agree.

55:03.325 --> 55:05.407
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I have the reason why I don't say where I work.

55:07.548 --> 55:08.149
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously.

55:08.869 --> 55:11.151
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know how I am outside of work.

55:11.952 --> 55:15.893
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be seen as a representative of my company when I'm not associated with it.

55:15.993 --> 55:16.573
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, me too.

55:16.733 --> 55:17.073
[SPEAKER_18]: Same thing.

55:17.213 --> 55:22.054
[SPEAKER_09]: So none of us have ever said exactly where we work for it, except for Loki, but he doesn't care.

55:22.474 --> 55:23.794
[SPEAKER_16]: He doesn't care what you think of his company.

55:25.554 --> 55:32.335
[SPEAKER_16]: To be honest, I don't think anyone would even know about how to get on internet radio at my work, let alone be able to figure things out.

55:33.256 --> 55:36.436
[SPEAKER_16]: They're like, where do you guys broadcast on the internet?

55:36.756 --> 55:37.436
[SPEAKER_16]: You can do that?

55:38.557 --> 55:40.437
[SPEAKER_09]: There's radio on the internet?

55:40.577 --> 55:41.137
[SPEAKER_16]: Holy crap.

55:41.479 --> 55:42.099
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the internet?

55:43.080 --> 55:53.305
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you know, when I went to Vegas as part of the DDR Freak moderator trip, there were these guys there who were like fanboys who were following us around everywhere.

55:53.925 --> 55:56.486
[SPEAKER_09]: And I still wanted to turn around and say, don't you have lives?

55:56.566 --> 55:57.007
[SPEAKER_09]: Go home.

55:57.967 --> 56:01.209
[SPEAKER_09]: But because I was a representative of DDR Freak, I didn't say that.

56:01.749 --> 56:02.549
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just tolerant.

56:04.230 --> 56:05.631
[SPEAKER_09]: And we actually ended up losing them.

56:09.009 --> 56:12.332
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know that, and you know what, does the guy have valid points?

56:12.572 --> 56:20.100
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, but the problem is that it was a total attitude problem, just a total, it wouldn't take, you know, could dish it out, but couldn't take it back.

56:20.540 --> 56:23.323
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm spending way too much time on this topic, to be honest.

56:23.443 --> 56:32.372
[SPEAKER_18]: It really doesn't deserve this much time, but that just really, I just want you guys to think out there, you know, if you're representing a certain, you know, game, stop being an idiot.

56:32.802 --> 56:36.644
[SPEAKER_18]: And that even goes for just any old DDR player, somebody playing DDR at the arcade.

56:36.984 --> 56:41.926
[SPEAKER_18]: If you start acting like an ass, you make every player that plays DDR look like an ass.

56:42.267 --> 56:43.527
[SPEAKER_18]: So show a little bit of respect.

56:44.888 --> 56:49.990
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's just like, I kind of frown at some people, certain people that play Soul Calibur II in the area, because they're kind of assholes.

56:50.110 --> 56:57.214
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, and I'm sure, you know, it's a great game, I own it on GameCube, but, you know, it kind of brings the whole fanbase down a little bit when a couple people look like asses.

56:57.654 --> 56:59.575
[SPEAKER_16]: And don't get me started on the initial D, people.

57:04.289 --> 57:05.350
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna second that.

57:06.671 --> 57:07.992
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not even gonna go there.

57:09.753 --> 57:11.414
[SPEAKER_18]: That's actually probably a much better example.

57:11.434 --> 57:12.835
[SPEAKER_18]: I can think of more examples for that.

57:14.036 --> 57:14.696
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

57:15.216 --> 57:19.399
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I play this racing game, so I have a really awesome car that's stored on a piece of paper.

57:23.662 --> 57:25.544
[SPEAKER_18]: I like in the groove, don't get me wrong.

57:27.345 --> 57:31.508
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, not just that, but, you know, initial D as well, you know.

57:33.329 --> 57:33.429
Yeah.

57:35.205 --> 57:35.425
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

57:36.005 --> 57:37.126
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we beat that into the ground.

57:37.146 --> 57:38.146
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we did beat that into the ground.

57:38.166 --> 57:38.586
[SPEAKER_09]: I have ice cream.

57:38.666 --> 57:40.147
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, I wanted to get that out of my system.

57:40.247 --> 57:41.307
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been sitting on that all week.

57:42.268 --> 57:42.768
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you feel better?

57:43.208 --> 57:44.008
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot, actually.

57:44.088 --> 57:45.289
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you feel spiritually cleansed?

57:45.369 --> 57:45.689
[SPEAKER_18]: I do.

57:46.870 --> 57:47.190
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

57:47.290 --> 57:52.092
[SPEAKER_18]: I would go so far as to welcome that guy on our show if he wants to present a dissenting opinion.

57:52.172 --> 57:52.712
[SPEAKER_18]: Go for it.

57:54.553 --> 57:55.293
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd love to hear it.

57:55.373 --> 57:56.373
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love to debate.

57:56.433 --> 57:58.074
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be just like the presidential debate.

58:00.603 --> 58:02.785
[SPEAKER_18]: But seriously, it's just one step chart.

58:03.125 --> 58:07.949
[SPEAKER_18]: On a mode that really, I mean honestly, quad mode, it's cute and all, but it really isn't that important.

58:08.269 --> 58:11.892
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I want to see what the rest of the game looks like, to be honest.

58:11.912 --> 58:15.295
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's look at some singles and doubles and how, I mean honestly...

58:16.218 --> 58:19.861
[SPEAKER_18]: Out... Regardless of how you feel about the step chart, look at this.

58:20.061 --> 58:24.805
[SPEAKER_18]: All new backgrounds, a whole new song, a whole new interface, the characters look differently.

58:25.386 --> 58:26.287
[SPEAKER_18]: No more Hoochie Emmy.

58:26.307 --> 58:29.990
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there's so... You could throw the step chart out completely and there's so many good things about it.

58:31.591 --> 58:31.931
Yeah.

58:33.152 --> 58:35.154
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very pissed off that they got rid of Hoochie Emmy.

58:35.214 --> 58:36.055
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes me sad.

58:36.535 --> 58:37.796
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe she's an Easter egg.

58:38.397 --> 58:39.278
[SPEAKER_16]: She's not an Easter egg.

58:39.298 --> 58:39.618
[SPEAKER_16]: They just...

58:40.979 --> 58:43.801
[SPEAKER_16]: You're making the poor CG woman look like a hoochie.

58:43.902 --> 58:46.924
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it might hurt her artificial feelings.

58:47.824 --> 58:49.265
[SPEAKER_16]: Who cares if it didn't look right?

58:51.647 --> 58:54.309
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, some things just aren't right, but they happen.

58:55.149 --> 58:56.610
[SPEAKER_16]: Like the Olsen twins acting.

58:57.151 --> 58:58.712
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just not right, but it happens.

59:00.953 --> 59:08.779
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, if we want to get down on someone that sucks at steps, holy crap, who about the people that made that stupid fucking hands and feet mode?

59:09.246 --> 59:12.108
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are some shitty steps right there, that's what I gotta say.

59:14.210 --> 59:15.371
[SPEAKER_16]: That's who you should be mad at.

59:16.272 --> 59:17.112
[SPEAKER_16]: Screw quad mode.

59:17.152 --> 59:19.234
[SPEAKER_16]: Quad mode's difficult because it's four pads.

59:19.714 --> 59:23.017
[SPEAKER_16]: And the feet mode, man, they did not... Screw you.

59:23.157 --> 59:24.578
[SPEAKER_18]: I kinda like hands and feet mode.

59:24.618 --> 59:25.139
[SPEAKER_18]: Screw you.

59:26.560 --> 59:35.306
[SPEAKER_18]: You can actually... From what I hear, you can actually go in and change the difficulty, but for whatever reason, they made it kind of, like, almost impossible to find where to change... Like, I just found out about this the other day.

59:35.707 --> 59:35.827
[SPEAKER_18]: Like...

59:36.374 --> 59:38.876
[SPEAKER_18]: It's almost impossible to figure out where you've got to go.

59:38.936 --> 59:40.077
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not obvious, in other words.

59:40.137 --> 59:40.658
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not possible.

59:40.678 --> 59:42.780
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not obvious where it is to change the difficulty.

59:43.180 --> 59:44.901
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Tina.

59:45.142 --> 59:46.042
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, shut up, Tina.

59:46.082 --> 59:46.603
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody cares.

59:49.065 --> 59:50.846
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate banner ads that have sound in them.

59:50.947 --> 59:52.208
[SPEAKER_18]: I absolutely hate them.

59:52.488 --> 59:54.169
[SPEAKER_18]: And that banner is all over the internet right now.

59:54.229 --> 59:55.170
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not do feedback?

59:56.391 --> 59:57.212
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a feedback thread.

59:57.941 --> 59:59.462
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, I'm not even talking about this.

59:59.523 --> 01:00:02.605
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just using this to get that one video that I lost all of a sudden.

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:05.608
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's on like a million other sites, too.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:08.491
[SPEAKER_18]: Tina can go to hell.

01:00:10.012 --> 01:00:11.053
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how I feel about Tina.

01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:17.799
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to get to this other video, but for some reason I keep trying to pull it up and it doesn't work.

01:00:17.899 --> 01:00:19.941
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I know why, because I've got to use the other program to do it.

01:00:20.802 --> 01:00:21.062
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me...

01:00:25.015 --> 01:00:32.677
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to load up another video that came out this week, and it actually has to do for DDR Festival.

01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:37.679
[SPEAKER_18]: A brand new video came out for DDR Festival, and it shows something kind of interesting going on.

01:00:38.759 --> 01:00:40.199
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, what was the name of that?

01:00:40.759 --> 01:00:41.480
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that this thing?

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:42.940
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, here it is.

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.201
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the DDR Festival teaser.

01:00:46.381 --> 01:00:47.661
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, obviously, we're on the radio.

01:00:47.701 --> 01:00:50.562
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys can't see it, but I'll tell you what's kind of going on here.

01:00:51.764 --> 01:00:54.747
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay little fireworks because it's a festival, hooray.

01:00:55.367 --> 01:00:55.948
[SPEAKER_18]: Obvious, right?

01:00:56.868 --> 01:00:57.869
[SPEAKER_18]: There's Maximizer.

01:01:00.751 --> 01:01:05.015
[SPEAKER_18]: And look at that, a brand new character select screen that has your characters.

01:01:05.055 --> 01:01:06.696
[SPEAKER_18]: There's rhythm, there's blues, and look at that.

01:01:07.257 --> 01:01:10.920
[SPEAKER_18]: One, two, three outfits for every character now that you can pick right there.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.362
[SPEAKER_18]: Some people are calling that customizable characters.

01:01:13.482 --> 01:01:15.664
[SPEAKER_18]: I call that three outfits a character, but whatever.

01:01:18.366 --> 01:01:19.287
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a new guy there.

01:01:19.447 --> 01:01:20.668
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a guy named Drum.

01:01:21.158 --> 01:01:22.859
[SPEAKER_18]: So do you think he'll have a partner named Bass?

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.540
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.541
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

01:01:27.163 --> 01:01:28.624
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's a little bit of the song list.

01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:35.970
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty much what you'd expect.

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:37.591
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a clip from You're Not Here.

01:01:38.632 --> 01:01:42.015
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit of the party mode there, but it's all in Japanese, which makes sense.

01:01:44.677 --> 01:01:46.719
[SPEAKER_18]: There's that Feed the Dog and Bunny mode.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.642
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's some of the members from V4U playing on the iToy.

01:01:59.617 --> 01:02:02.678
[SPEAKER_18]: And it looks much better than the eye toy actually does.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:11.502
[SPEAKER_18]: You should see, like in this video, the B4U chicks, they totally are like par-a-par-ing some of these hands and feet things on eye toy.

01:02:12.842 --> 01:02:14.763
[SPEAKER_18]: And I love Noria, she's such a crack hoe.

01:02:21.826 --> 01:02:24.607
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that, look, she's like totally par-a-par-ing to clear the screen there.

01:02:26.308 --> 01:02:26.868
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so cute.

01:02:27.659 --> 01:02:29.581
[SPEAKER_18]: There's Mission Mode, you know that's coming back.

01:02:39.348 --> 01:02:42.010
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a little clip of Your Rain, that video, we all know that song.

01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:47.855
[SPEAKER_18]: Funk Boogie.

01:02:50.537 --> 01:02:53.919
[SPEAKER_18]: So, no big surprises there about DDR Festival.

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:57.362
[SPEAKER_18]: Not right now.

01:02:57.382 --> 01:02:57.442
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

01:02:57.932 --> 01:02:57.992
[SPEAKER_18]: D.D.R.

01:02:58.012 --> 01:02:58.213
[SPEAKER_18]: Festival

01:03:09.608 --> 01:03:10.849
[SPEAKER_18]: Mission Modes in Japanese

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:33.211
[SPEAKER_16]: They have better mixes anyways, get that

01:03:57.938 --> 01:03:58.579
[SPEAKER_18]: Euromix, Jamelia, Superstar

01:04:11.002 --> 01:04:12.483
[SPEAKER_18]: I've played it on my show a couple times.

01:04:12.603 --> 01:04:14.243
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, my spin instructor loves that song.

01:04:14.263 --> 01:04:14.784
[SPEAKER_18]: She adopted it.

01:04:14.824 --> 01:04:15.324
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get it.

01:04:15.344 --> 01:04:17.545
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have an eye toy, so I don't really give a crap about the eye toy modes, but...

01:04:34.577 --> 01:04:38.438
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to play a game and watch myself flail around stupidly.

01:04:39.378 --> 01:04:39.838
[SPEAKER_09]: So no.

01:04:40.358 --> 01:04:41.058
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll get it.

01:04:41.218 --> 01:04:42.298
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get it for stuff.

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:45.299
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, you know what, personally, I think I'm actually going to pass on it.

01:04:45.819 --> 01:04:49.019
[SPEAKER_18]: I really don't see the point for me getting it because I can't read Japanese.

01:04:49.039 --> 01:04:53.780
[SPEAKER_18]: I already have all the songs minus like three or four or whatever, how many songs haven't been in DDR yet.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.981
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, there hasn't really been anything to really sell me on it yet.

01:04:57.261 --> 01:05:01.982
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's one of those things I'll pick up later as a collector thing, like when it's come down in price a little bit maybe.

01:05:02.062 --> 01:05:03.242
[SPEAKER_18]: Like try to get it when it's like...

01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:06.903
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit discounted before it becomes a collector's item and everything.

01:05:06.943 --> 01:05:11.065
[SPEAKER_18]: But as much as I want to support DDR and all, there's too much shit to buy in the U.S.

01:05:11.085 --> 01:05:11.266
[SPEAKER_09]: right now.

01:05:11.286 --> 01:05:12.666
[SPEAKER_09]: I already know what else my money is going for.

01:05:12.686 --> 01:05:14.607
[SPEAKER_18]: And Ultramix 2 is coming out like the same week.

01:05:14.647 --> 01:05:16.428
[SPEAKER_18]: And honestly, my money is going there first.

01:05:16.448 --> 01:05:17.889
[SPEAKER_09]: I have other imports to get.

01:05:19.169 --> 01:05:24.392
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to get 2DX8 style and Bujingai.

01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:25.853
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the U.S.

01:05:25.893 --> 01:05:26.553
[SPEAKER_09]: version is ass.

01:05:29.284 --> 01:05:32.385
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I guess we're going to open up the Skype line because you know what?

01:05:32.425 --> 01:05:34.125
[SPEAKER_18]: We've talked about a lot of different things here.

01:05:34.165 --> 01:05:38.206
[SPEAKER_18]: We've kind of talked about Quad Mode and Ultramix 2 a little bit and a little bit of the controversy there.

01:05:38.246 --> 01:05:39.646
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about DDR Festival.

01:05:40.206 --> 01:05:41.687
[SPEAKER_18]: Just curious if you guys have any comments.

01:05:41.787 --> 01:05:45.627
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, if you don't know what the Skype line is all about, visit www.orangezonsradio.com.

01:05:45.967 --> 01:05:50.808
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on Interact With Us and you can see the details right there on how to use the Skype line.

01:05:50.828 --> 01:05:53.509
[SPEAKER_18]: It allows you to call our show without having a phone.

01:05:54.113 --> 01:06:02.020
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually think I'm going to buy the feature to allow us to call out so we can do some phone interviews later with some big name DDR celebs.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:02.841
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be kind of fun.

01:06:04.563 --> 01:06:06.704
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you can actually call phone numbers using this little tab right here.

01:06:06.985 --> 01:06:10.468
[SPEAKER_18]: But you have to pay for credits, but I'm thinking about it.

01:06:10.608 --> 01:06:11.168
[SPEAKER_18]: I might do that.

01:06:11.289 --> 01:06:11.629
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

01:06:12.904 --> 01:06:14.385
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think it's a neat idea for Skype.

01:06:14.425 --> 01:06:22.108
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're kind of giving a minute for the buffer to catch up because it takes a minute before you guys actually hear what we say here in studio.

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.229
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want you guys to be able to call into the Skype line.

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:25.030
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Loki.

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:29.432
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to point out to Rob here.

01:06:29.972 --> 01:06:31.073
[SPEAKER_16]: Three-way and four-way.

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:32.253
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I'm not mentioning what else.

01:06:33.074 --> 01:06:34.494
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, hopefully we get those soon.

01:06:34.554 --> 01:06:35.615
[SPEAKER_18]: I just hope they're not fakes.

01:06:36.695 --> 01:06:38.676
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki might have something really good to play for you guys later.

01:06:38.696 --> 01:06:39.957
[SPEAKER_18]: I just hope to God they're not fakes.

01:06:40.987 --> 01:06:42.508
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that thing you were showing me earlier today?

01:06:42.528 --> 01:06:49.754
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess it's a couple months old, but somebody had actually written a whole document, like an FAQ, on how to make fake Bomani songs or something like that.

01:06:49.934 --> 01:06:51.536
[SPEAKER_18]: How to make fake test location songs.

01:06:52.837 --> 01:06:55.339
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is another thing that I think is in completely poor taste.

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:56.160
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't get me started.

01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:01.144
[SPEAKER_18]: You're just preying on poor people that are just looking to get excited about a new game.

01:07:01.204 --> 01:07:03.646
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, you know... But whatever.

01:07:06.768 --> 01:07:08.470
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you're showing me it's somewhere in here.

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:08.950
[SPEAKER_18]: Some little...

01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:13.753
[SPEAKER_18]: Some little guide on how to write a fake Bomani song.

01:07:13.773 --> 01:07:17.556
[SPEAKER_18]: I just had to do just running something through a bunch of filters and all this other garbage.

01:07:17.976 --> 01:07:19.037
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yay, we're getting a call.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:19.817
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to the Sky Blind.

01:07:20.097 --> 01:07:21.538
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.281
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Sky, it's El Mollet again.

01:07:25.321 --> 01:07:26.562
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Mollet, how you doing?

01:07:27.122 --> 01:07:28.483
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy with the coolest name ever.

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:29.984
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, what's on your mind?

01:07:31.925 --> 01:07:35.888
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you mentioned DDR Festival and I have some choice words for DDR Festival.

01:07:36.048 --> 01:07:38.309
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a feeling I know what's coming, but go for it.

01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:40.551
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, first of all,

01:07:41.098 --> 01:07:54.082
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know a lot of US mixes have been accused of being half-assed, like just piling things one on top of the other and not having a lot of balance to them.

01:07:55.243 --> 01:08:08.947
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Festival as probably a perfect example of being a half-assed mix, just as far as the Konami originals are concerned.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:23.251
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if it's so much a half-assed mix, it's just the fact that for once, I think it's just the tables are turned, and we got something kind of new before Japanese did, so this game coming out for them is kind of like when we got DDR USA.

01:08:23.752 --> 01:08:24.392
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell was that?

01:08:24.412 --> 01:08:26.294
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just a rehashed thing, you know?

01:08:26.354 --> 01:08:27.935
[SPEAKER_18]: There really wasn't anything special about it.

01:08:28.095 --> 01:08:38.444
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll take the half-assed comment back and I'll go with rehashed, but half-assed was the first thing that I thought of, only because, and the way the Konami originals include it,

01:08:39.284 --> 01:09:08.247
[SPEAKER_12]: uh... thus far anyway none of them have appeared uh... have not appeared on a USA mix yet none of them I mean the fact of the matter is the entire Konami original selection you can find them on United States mixes already right but but for the for the standard you know person living in Japan who you know has a casual passing interest in DDR it is going to be something new to them so you know of course

01:09:08.703 --> 01:09:15.967
[SPEAKER_18]: But for us, for the import fans, for us, it's no big deal unless we don't have an Xbox or don't have a US PS2, you know?

01:09:16.607 --> 01:09:17.648
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty much it.

01:09:17.728 --> 01:09:23.131
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Japanese gamer, it's something nice because they get more songs that they don't have on their PS2s yet.

01:09:23.171 --> 01:09:25.732
[SPEAKER_12]: For the American importer, it's kind of a letdown.

01:09:25.832 --> 01:09:29.114
[SPEAKER_19]: But for us fucking obsessive collectors, it's kind of a letdown.

01:09:30.654 --> 01:09:33.656
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, we have to kind of face the fact that we're in the minority.

01:09:34.496 --> 01:09:35.277
[SPEAKER_18]: And Konami...

01:09:35.848 --> 01:09:39.510
[SPEAKER_18]: Konami, they're getting three games for their buck here, really.

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:46.194
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we all kind of know that Konami of Japan actually were the ones that did the interface that Konami USA keeps getting criticized for.

01:09:46.654 --> 01:09:49.976
[SPEAKER_18]: But basically, Konami of Japan made this interface and they got three games out of it.

01:09:50.016 --> 01:09:53.098
[SPEAKER_18]: They got the one in Europe, they got our game, they got their new festival.

01:09:53.138 --> 01:09:55.159
[SPEAKER_18]: So hey, I'm sure it worked out great for them.

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:56.732
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, definitely.

01:09:56.812 --> 01:09:57.873
[SPEAKER_12]: Very easy to develop.

01:09:57.893 --> 01:10:02.896
[SPEAKER_12]: You come up with a basic skeleton and then you plug in the insides.

01:10:03.277 --> 01:10:11.583
[SPEAKER_18]: For me, I just think it's kind of neat to kind of have the tables turned for once and we're getting something new and it's kind of like, oh, well, we don't need the Japanese mix now.

01:10:12.123 --> 01:10:13.824
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't need to support that.

01:10:13.905 --> 01:10:19.789
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the same damn argument that we heard three years ago when it was USA was getting the sloppy seconds, you know?

01:10:20.269 --> 01:10:20.589
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

01:10:20.609 --> 01:10:25.073
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still some people who are going to spin this into Japan's favor.

01:10:26.986 --> 01:10:34.272
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's comedy gold for all those people that were dogging on Extreme before saying it wasn't Japanese enough.

01:10:34.392 --> 01:10:35.873
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it is just comedy gold.

01:10:35.933 --> 01:10:45.300
[SPEAKER_18]: It's totally just desserts for those people that just said, you know, it's crap, it's USA, just America ruined DDR.

01:10:45.901 --> 01:10:46.681
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not really.

01:10:49.123 --> 01:10:51.365
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the direction they wanted to move in, but

01:10:52.102 --> 01:10:59.887
[SPEAKER_18]: America, in fact, I would go so far as to say that Hawaii, which is an American state, last time I checked, is going to revolutionize CD-R.

01:11:00.367 --> 01:11:08.772
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no question about that, especially when you're getting 50 songs that are completely new and never been seen before.

01:11:08.812 --> 01:11:12.835
[SPEAKER_12]: You never see that unless you're talking about a brand new Japanese arcade mix.

01:11:13.197 --> 01:11:16.319
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go so far as to make a prediction here on the program.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:21.723
[SPEAKER_18]: That when Ultramix 2 comes out, about a couple weeks after Ultramix 2, it is going to be so huge.

01:11:22.104 --> 01:11:29.429
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to be so... There are going to be those detractors, like people that work for In The Groove or whatever, that are going to be out there going, ah, this game sucks.

01:11:29.829 --> 01:11:36.074
[SPEAKER_18]: But for the most part, 90% of the scene is going to just love this game and say this is everything DDR should have been.

01:11:36.374 --> 01:11:38.696
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm saying that there are going to be freaking riots everywhere.

01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:43.890
[SPEAKER_18]: and petitions for Konami of Hawaii to do an arcade mix.

01:11:44.731 --> 01:11:47.533
[SPEAKER_18]: The Konami of Hawaii should be given all the rights to do a new arcade mix.

01:11:48.874 --> 01:11:50.055
[SPEAKER_18]: I would go so far as to say that.

01:11:51.536 --> 01:11:53.638
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're going to be forgiven for DDRPC.

01:11:53.658 --> 01:11:55.319
[SPEAKER_18]: I think most people have already forgiven them for it.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.003
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just a chance for them to get their feet wet and we've all managed to look past it now.

01:12:00.463 --> 01:12:04.786
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultramix had some problems, but for the most part it was different, it was new.

01:12:06.808 --> 01:12:07.969
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultramix 2 is going to blow it all away.

01:12:10.009 --> 01:12:19.672
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely agree about Ultramix, too, especially with the song list is pretty much half revealed by now, and it just blows everything out of the water.

01:12:19.932 --> 01:12:21.013
[SPEAKER_18]: And now just the videos this week.

01:12:21.033 --> 01:12:22.813
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of the videos that came out this week?

01:12:24.414 --> 01:12:26.955
[SPEAKER_12]: The Rage Remodel kicks ass.

01:12:27.675 --> 01:12:28.115
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:12:28.915 --> 01:12:31.936
[SPEAKER_18]: And the backgrounds and the videos looked awesome.

01:12:31.956 --> 01:12:33.497
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very impressed with the movies.

01:12:34.079 --> 01:12:35.080
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy did I get screwed!

01:13:05.336 --> 01:13:07.758
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other thoughts on your mind, Mr. Mullet?

01:13:38.465 --> 01:13:40.586
[SPEAKER_12]: No, after that long voice thing.

01:13:40.846 --> 01:13:41.726
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's fine.

01:13:42.086 --> 01:13:43.827
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we appreciate your perspective as always.

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:45.147
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:46.128
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a wonderful day.

01:13:47.088 --> 01:13:47.408
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

01:13:47.508 --> 01:13:48.128
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, bye-bye.

01:13:48.589 --> 01:13:51.429
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

01:13:51.489 --> 01:13:53.990
[SPEAKER_18]: The other line was ringing.

01:13:55.671 --> 01:13:58.512
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure we'll get a return call there.

01:13:58.532 --> 01:13:59.252
[SPEAKER_18]: We can pick that up.

01:14:00.971 --> 01:14:05.233
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to interact with the show, www.oransonsradio.com and click on interact with us.

01:14:05.293 --> 01:14:06.014
[SPEAKER_18]: Here comes a call.

01:14:06.094 --> 01:14:07.534
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, you're on Oransons Radio.

01:14:10.275 --> 01:14:10.956
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, who's this?

01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:15.638
[SPEAKER_19]: You're breaking up really, really badly.

01:14:15.718 --> 01:14:16.538
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, hi, how you doing?

01:14:16.558 --> 01:14:16.998
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

01:14:17.058 --> 01:14:17.419
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you're...

01:14:27.808 --> 01:14:31.071
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate to do this, but I gotta let you go because we can't hear you at all.

01:14:31.111 --> 01:14:32.612
[SPEAKER_19]: You're really breaking up bad.

01:14:32.672 --> 01:14:33.773
[SPEAKER_18]: Double check your connection.

01:14:34.653 --> 01:14:36.375
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really, really breaking up there.

01:14:36.435 --> 01:14:40.478
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't understand you, so we'll try that again later.

01:14:40.498 --> 01:14:41.479
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we'll get a better connection.

01:14:41.819 --> 01:14:45.922
[SPEAKER_18]: That's kind of one of the downsides of having to take the calls online is that when you get the packet lost and all that crap.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.883
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki, you downloading porn over there?

01:14:47.903 --> 01:14:49.365
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that why it's so choppy?

01:14:49.465 --> 01:14:49.885
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just kidding.

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:51.666
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:14:52.027 --> 01:14:54.128
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess we better disable the skyline for a little bit.

01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:56.450
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll let it get a little better there.

01:14:57.032 --> 01:15:04.738
[SPEAKER_18]: and we'll go to a break because I want to get to the Orange Lingerie Cage Match and some other Bimani news that came out this week for sure.

01:15:04.758 --> 01:15:06.099
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have other favorite segments.

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.482
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and we'll open up the skyline a little bit again later.

01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:21.472
[SPEAKER_18]: In this break we're going to hear some music from, I don't know, some Japanese mixes, some Japanese songs that are popular in DDR because Jamie really wanted to hear Ninzaburro or...

01:15:23.567 --> 01:15:24.949
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell is the other name of Ninzaburro?

01:15:24.989 --> 01:15:25.830
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's called the Ninzaburro.

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:26.751
[SPEAKER_08]: The theme of Furuhata.

01:15:26.791 --> 01:15:28.213
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Furuhata theme.

01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:28.933
[SPEAKER_18]: I couldn't even remember that.

01:15:28.974 --> 01:15:30.636
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is from the show, Furuhata Ninzaburro.

01:15:30.736 --> 01:15:31.096
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:36.082
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to play some of these songs, and then we will be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:36.382 --> 01:15:36.763
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

01:15:55.171 --> 01:15:56.174
and many more.

01:16:31.033 --> 01:16:31.815
Thank you for watching!

01:18:44.564 --> 01:18:48.265
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, one, two, three, come on!

01:18:48.305 --> 01:18:53.026
We are a simulation, a simulation, a simulation

01:20:27.185 --> 01:20:28.426
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:28.766 --> 01:20:30.928
[SPEAKER_18]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:37.652
[SPEAKER_18]: I was a little bit of awkward silence there.

01:20:37.692 --> 01:20:38.113
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, guys.

01:20:38.813 --> 01:20:40.994
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:41.835 --> 01:20:47.599
[SPEAKER_18]: I just got distracted by the chat room while I was trying to queue up the last bit of playlist thing there, and I got too distracted.

01:20:47.619 --> 01:20:49.100
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't spam our chat room.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:49.200
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:56.900
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot to mention that actually I was up this morning.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:01.741
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I was up until 5.30 last night, and I got up this morning at about 11.30 or so.

01:21:02.301 --> 01:21:04.142
[SPEAKER_18]: I started playing Ultramix all morning.

01:21:04.202 --> 01:21:10.504
[SPEAKER_18]: I swear to God, I was playing Ultramix for like two hours today online on the dance, playing against other people thing.

01:21:11.004 --> 01:21:19.046
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think in one day, I raised my ranking on the ranking board from 999, which is basically as low as you can get.

01:21:19.266 --> 01:21:21.427
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to get a certain amount of points or you can never crack that number.

01:21:21.767 --> 01:21:26.209
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I raised it up all the way to like 640-something in a day's work.

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:31.832
[SPEAKER_18]: Which isn't that many points, but for some reason today, Ultramix is still popular.

01:21:31.852 --> 01:21:39.796
[SPEAKER_18]: I was in a lot of four-person matches, and the people were kind of picking a lot of light songs, and were kind of struggling a little bit.

01:21:41.337 --> 01:21:47.340
[SPEAKER_18]: My only complaint about Ultramix Online is that, god damn, people keep picking the same damn songs.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.185
[SPEAKER_18]: Like the default song that comes up when you want to pick a song to battle against somebody is .59, right?

01:21:54.665 --> 01:21:56.767
[SPEAKER_18]: Tengoku, if you want to call it that, too.

01:21:56.847 --> 01:22:03.833
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the default song, and so, of course, like a million matches get started with that song because people don't know how to change it, and it's just kind of like, I'm so sick of this song.

01:22:04.193 --> 01:22:12.279
[SPEAKER_18]: And then for some reason today, there was this one person, I swear to God, every match he or she created, I think it might have been a she, every match she was creating, Secret Rendezvous was her song.

01:22:12.439 --> 01:22:12.960
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, ugh.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.001
[SPEAKER_18]: It just kind of sucks because there's not a whole lot of people on Ultramix.

01:22:17.021 --> 01:22:22.084
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually there's only a couple groups of people playing, so you're kind of stuck with whatever songs you can actually find.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:23.865
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you start off and pick something different?

01:22:24.125 --> 01:22:27.887
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, wow, it's not like every time you start a game with, do that thing!

01:22:29.247 --> 01:22:30.168
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, now it's not true.

01:22:30.288 --> 01:22:34.510
[SPEAKER_18]: Just today I played Shiny Disco Balls and DXY in games, okay?

01:22:34.570 --> 01:22:35.631
[SPEAKER_18]: So just, you know, shut your mouth.

01:22:36.471 --> 01:22:37.311
[SPEAKER_08]: Woohoo, DXY.

01:22:37.932 --> 01:22:39.212
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody else will pick do that thing.

01:22:39.232 --> 01:22:40.673
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to show do that thing a little love.

01:22:40.793 --> 01:22:41.854
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody loves do that thing.

01:22:44.423 --> 01:22:44.643
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

01:22:45.745 --> 01:22:45.945
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

01:22:46.065 --> 01:22:46.706
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you pointing at?

01:22:48.087 --> 01:22:51.070
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Loki wants me to talk about this story, speaking of songs.

01:22:52.152 --> 01:22:54.234
[SPEAKER_18]: We just posted this to our website.

01:22:54.695 --> 01:22:58.939
[SPEAKER_18]: Even though this isn't directly Bimani-related, it's kind of Bimani-related.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:04.786
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the ladies from the Weather Girls, Izora Rhodes, she was one half of the Weather Girls, she died.

01:23:05.406 --> 01:23:05.706
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's cool.

01:23:05.726 --> 01:23:07.568
[SPEAKER_18]: It was from Bridget Jones' Diary, which had a pretty...

01:23:34.099 --> 01:23:35.981
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty well-received soundtrack, from what I remember.

01:23:40.025 --> 01:23:44.629
[SPEAKER_18]: Moment of silence, please, for one half of the Weather Girls, Yzora Rhodes.

01:23:48.193 --> 01:23:49.334
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, there we go.

01:23:50.915 --> 01:23:53.638
[SPEAKER_18]: And a little clip for us to remember.

01:23:54.419 --> 01:23:54.619
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

01:24:12.572 --> 01:24:13.533
[SPEAKER_04]: It's raining now

01:24:32.247 --> 01:24:40.817
[SPEAKER_18]: For every song like It's Raining Men, you get a song like Daikin Kai, which is kind of, you know, it's kind of rocking and mannish, I guess.

01:24:41.097 --> 01:24:43.199
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a very testosterone-y song, I think.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.022
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, I quit bitchin'.

01:24:45.162 --> 01:24:46.503
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's all the taku stuff.

01:24:47.204 --> 01:24:47.524
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:24:48.505 --> 01:24:49.286
[SPEAKER_08]: Which makes me happy.

01:24:50.087 --> 01:24:50.688
[SPEAKER_18]: So shut your mouth.

01:24:51.823 --> 01:24:52.323
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you a hint.

01:24:52.343 --> 01:24:55.826
[SPEAKER_08]: The Do That Thing video is kind of what clues you into the fact that that song's a little gay.

01:24:55.846 --> 01:24:55.946
[SPEAKER_18]: Tessa.

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:30.902
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm being teased by the listeners.

01:25:31.002 --> 01:25:31.642
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't like that.

01:25:32.723 --> 01:25:38.426
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm supposed to be proving some kind of fake power over them, and I don't like being teased.

01:25:38.606 --> 01:25:40.947
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, is your journalistic integrity being breached?

01:25:41.087 --> 01:25:41.368
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

01:25:42.768 --> 01:25:45.070
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm being breached, and I don't like it.

01:25:48.111 --> 01:25:49.212
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have more Bimani news.

01:25:49.905 --> 01:25:50.645
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, sure we do.

01:25:51.686 --> 01:25:54.006
[SPEAKER_18]: I was actually going to queue up the cage match, but if you want to talk... Okay, cage match.

01:25:54.246 --> 01:25:55.486
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, let's do it more by my mind.

01:25:55.566 --> 01:26:02.028
[SPEAKER_09]: Since you brought it up... You're the one talking about testosterone and bringing it up.

01:26:02.108 --> 01:26:03.268
[SPEAKER_16]: Testosterony.

01:26:04.829 --> 01:26:05.289
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Loki.

01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:08.510
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to make a little side note here.

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:13.851
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone's interested in looking for, like, a nice DDR pad, our friend at

01:26:15.223 --> 01:26:21.910
[SPEAKER_16]: The local golf land is selling off his Solo 2000 arcade stage, if you want it.

01:26:22.591 --> 01:26:22.951
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:23.672
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

01:26:24.653 --> 01:26:27.056
[SPEAKER_16]: So he's selling that for anybody that's interested.

01:26:29.078 --> 01:26:30.319
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how you can get a hold of him.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:31.541
[SPEAKER_16]: He's on...

01:26:32.028 --> 01:26:54.341
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Freak as Kundoggy, K-U-N-D-O-G-G-Y So just, um, you might be able to PM him and ask him The stage is fucking heavy, it is 200 pounds It's a real solo pad, I saw it in a pre-modified phase No, it hasn't been modified yet No, it hasn't been modified at all Yeah, he hasn't really done anything with it yet Just in case you're interested and have a lot of cash Do you have an idea of how much he's charging for it?

01:26:54.681 --> 01:26:59.084
[SPEAKER_18]: No I'll pay a dollar Put it on eBay

01:26:59.938 --> 01:27:05.662
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, as long as you're doing miscellaneous Orange Honest Radio announcements, I do want to say happy birthday to our cam whore, Misty.

01:27:05.882 --> 01:27:06.563
[SPEAKER_18]: It's her birthday today.

01:27:07.023 --> 01:27:08.464
[SPEAKER_08]: We also had a weekend a few days ago.

01:27:08.884 --> 01:27:09.305
[SPEAKER_08]: A weekend.

01:27:10.065 --> 01:27:10.686
[SPEAKER_08]: A birthday.

01:27:10.706 --> 01:27:11.847
[SPEAKER_08]: A few days ago.

01:27:11.867 --> 01:27:13.448
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm horrible with birthdays.

01:27:13.508 --> 01:27:14.568
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Shark's Girl.

01:27:14.849 --> 01:27:16.770
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, Shark's Girl's birthday was a couple days ago.

01:27:17.671 --> 01:27:20.012
[SPEAKER_18]: She got to go play with dolphins on her birthday.

01:27:20.232 --> 01:27:20.853
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

01:27:21.013 --> 01:27:21.714
[SPEAKER_18]: That was very nice.

01:27:21.754 --> 01:27:22.794
[SPEAKER_08]: They were so cute.

01:27:23.014 --> 01:27:24.536
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to have her back on the show to talk about it.

01:27:24.836 --> 01:27:24.976
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

01:27:24.996 --> 01:27:25.136
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

01:27:26.058 --> 01:27:26.338
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:27:27.619 --> 01:27:28.099
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.342
[SPEAKER_18]: Bomani News, before we get to the cage match, since Jamie decided to delay the cage match here.

01:27:33.143 --> 01:27:34.804
[SPEAKER_09]: You were the one who decided, okay?

01:27:35.124 --> 01:27:36.245
[SPEAKER_18]: I just like ruffling your feathers.

01:27:37.145 --> 01:27:39.347
[SPEAKER_18]: Dance Mania EX8 is on the way out.

01:27:39.367 --> 01:27:42.649
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, Dance Mania being the series that a lot of DDR songs come from.

01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:51.495
[SPEAKER_18]: Dance Mania EX8 is on the way, and it's going to have some lovely tracks on it, including... Oh.

01:27:52.496 --> 01:27:54.377
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'll do the... God, it...

01:27:55.319 --> 01:27:57.201
[SPEAKER_18]: Distract the show here so I can do a ban

01:28:17.013 --> 01:28:20.694
[SPEAKER_18]: Erotic with Gotta Get It Groovin', the remix of that's going to be on this CD.

01:28:20.734 --> 01:28:22.094
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to think of other DDR bands, you know.

01:28:22.595 --> 01:28:27.256
[SPEAKER_18]: 2 Unlimited, Maximum Overdrive, the Horny Horns vocal radio edit.

01:28:27.316 --> 01:28:28.076
[SPEAKER_18]: Horny Horns.

01:28:28.916 --> 01:28:31.897
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's That Girl, doing a cover of Burnin' Up by Madonna.

01:28:32.857 --> 01:28:40.359
[SPEAKER_18]: Extreme with Upside Jump, Atomic Kittens, going to do Ladies Night, which is actually... Yeah, with Curtis Mantronic doing a remix.

01:28:40.959 --> 01:28:43.580
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is actually a previous Cage Match pick of ours.

01:28:44.727 --> 01:28:45.087
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe.

01:28:45.347 --> 01:28:48.189
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that remix is, but I know that song was, because I picked it.

01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:51.612
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was.

01:28:51.652 --> 01:28:52.673
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell is that song?

01:28:52.993 --> 01:28:55.915
[SPEAKER_16]: Strictly Business, I think.

01:28:58.111 --> 01:29:01.413
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, we've got... I saw there was another one on here I want to mention.

01:29:01.453 --> 01:29:02.134
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Wild Side.

01:29:02.154 --> 01:29:02.734
[SPEAKER_18]: You know Wild Side.

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:05.116
[SPEAKER_18]: They did Here's This Little Moment and My Sweet Darling.

01:29:05.136 --> 01:29:06.597
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going to have Superstar.

01:29:07.098 --> 01:29:13.002
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know if that has anything to do with any other versions of that song, but that's going to be on DanceMedia EX8.

01:29:13.022 --> 01:29:13.943
[SPEAKER_18]: So look for that soon.

01:29:14.143 --> 01:29:15.584
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you can't find it, that's all right.

01:29:15.604 --> 01:29:16.205
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be speedy.

01:29:16.545 --> 01:29:19.727
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll play it on Orange Laundry as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.

01:29:20.408 --> 01:29:21.269
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who I miss?

01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.889
[SPEAKER_09]: Who?

01:29:22.309 --> 01:29:23.510
[SPEAKER_09]: I miss the Olivia Project.

01:29:24.271 --> 01:29:24.711
[SPEAKER_19]: I do, too.

01:29:24.771 --> 01:29:26.913
[SPEAKER_09]: All those lovely Olivia Newton-John, you know...

01:29:27.853 --> 01:29:28.433
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:44.706
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all home versions.

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:50.189
[SPEAKER_18]: Which kind of reminds me of an important question I want to ask on our LiveJournal community later this week.

01:29:50.649 --> 01:29:53.530
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you're not a member of our LiveJournal community, you should join it.

01:29:53.751 --> 01:29:59.253
[SPEAKER_18]: www.livejournal.com and it's username orange lounge is our username.

01:29:59.713 --> 01:30:07.997
[SPEAKER_18]: So for those of you guys that are on the LiveJournal, you sometimes get to see secret little posts and you get to be in the know on some things and you get reminded every Tuesday night to pump up the volume is on.

01:30:08.413 --> 01:30:10.514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because, well, okay.

01:30:10.674 --> 01:30:12.495
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's a great promotional too, it really is.

01:30:12.535 --> 01:30:14.516
[SPEAKER_18]: And people seem to like having the reminders.

01:30:14.837 --> 01:30:18.318
[SPEAKER_09]: I usually post on there what the marathon's going to be in case people go, oh, that sucks.

01:30:18.619 --> 01:30:20.300
[SPEAKER_09]: But usually I don't want them to listen anyway.

01:30:22.441 --> 01:30:24.122
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit of a warning, what's going to be played.

01:30:24.722 --> 01:30:25.042
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:30:25.162 --> 01:30:25.622
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cool.

01:30:26.723 --> 01:30:28.184
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's a good way to keep tabs on what's going on.

01:30:29.867 --> 01:30:37.291
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes there's a lot of things that they're not quite appropriate to be posted on the front page of our site, but they're things we want to kind of clue the fans in on.

01:30:38.751 --> 01:30:42.153
[SPEAKER_24]: For a picture, rather than a compromising position, here's the link.

01:30:43.214 --> 01:30:48.876
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

01:30:48.937 --> 01:30:57.861
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, Echo Image made its return to the cage match with a song called Come Back, and it was Loki's pick for the cage match.

01:30:58.397 --> 01:30:59.498
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what, though?

01:30:59.739 --> 01:31:04.043
[SPEAKER_18]: It may be a tricky night tonight because Shane, I noticed, quit out of our chat room earlier in the show.

01:31:04.383 --> 01:31:07.406
[SPEAKER_18]: So he's not going to be here to persuade you all to vote for Echo Image.

01:31:07.486 --> 01:31:10.209
[SPEAKER_18]: So, could be competitive tonight.

01:31:10.569 --> 01:31:11.030
[SPEAKER_14]: Could be.

01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:17.336
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a lot of good songs tonight, but will an old favorite, or I should say a new old favorite of the show, will it win?

01:31:17.396 --> 01:31:17.817
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knows?

01:31:18.197 --> 01:31:19.278
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight's song number one.

01:31:19.638 --> 01:31:21.080
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, the way the cage match works, you get to hear...

01:31:22.262 --> 01:31:25.645
[SPEAKER_18]: 3 songs, you get to hear a clip of last week's winner and 2 new songs in their entirety.

01:31:26.306 --> 01:31:29.048
[SPEAKER_18]: The song that wins goes into rotation all week long on Orange Laundry.

01:31:29.068 --> 01:31:34.113
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the Monty Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we are not.

01:31:35.215 --> 01:31:35.495
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:31:36.356 --> 01:31:36.616
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool?

01:31:37.036 --> 01:31:37.557
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool!

01:31:37.637 --> 01:31:39.058
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, here's a clip of last week's winner.

01:31:39.178 --> 01:31:41.921
[SPEAKER_18]: Echo Image, song number 1 you can vote for tonight with Come Back.

01:31:41.941 --> 01:31:42.402
[SPEAKER_18]: Come Back.

01:32:04.324 --> 01:32:05.525
Thank you for watching!

01:33:04.617 --> 01:33:05.578
Thanks for watching!

01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:25.791
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, song number one in the cage match with Echo Image with Comeback.

01:33:25.811 --> 01:33:28.452
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, we're noticing that our chat room seems kind of dead tonight.

01:33:30.132 --> 01:33:33.493
[SPEAKER_18]: We have just as many listeners as we usually do, but our chat room seems a little bit dead.

01:33:33.513 --> 01:33:34.314
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there's a few people.

01:33:34.354 --> 01:33:38.635
[SPEAKER_16]: That new show, that new drama that everyone's going to be talking about on Monday about Horny Housewives.

01:33:38.715 --> 01:33:40.235
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, don't get me started.

01:33:40.255 --> 01:33:40.956
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we're trying to think.

01:33:41.156 --> 01:33:45.657
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, seriously, that's what we think about, like, when the night seems kind of slow or a little bit dead.

01:33:45.697 --> 01:33:47.538
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of like, is there something else going on tonight?

01:33:47.578 --> 01:33:48.998
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, were the Oscars on tonight or something?

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.865
[SPEAKER_18]: They're watching the news They're watching replays of the debate They're playing Silent Hill 4 I don't remember

01:34:09.375 --> 01:34:11.336
[SPEAKER_18]: You decided to go with an old favorite, too.

01:34:11.376 --> 01:34:14.916
[SPEAKER_18]: You decided to use Loki's own tricks on him, and you went with an old favorite.

01:34:14.936 --> 01:34:15.837
[SPEAKER_18]: You went with Enflo.

01:34:16.037 --> 01:34:16.497
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:19.138
[SPEAKER_09]: I just picked a random Enflo song because I couldn't think of anything else.

01:34:19.418 --> 01:34:22.639
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so here's the random Enflo song that Jamie decided on.

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:23.739
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called You Said.

01:34:24.439 --> 01:34:26.600
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this from their Astro album?

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.781
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's from... I don't remember the name of the album.

01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:31.641
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:34:31.761 --> 01:34:35.722
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's from the last one before the Astro Magic.

01:34:36.585 --> 01:34:37.246
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, fair enough.

01:34:37.266 --> 01:34:39.008
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, here it is for you guys to give it a try.

01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:41.831
[SPEAKER_18]: See if you like this one enough to give it your vote tonight.

01:34:41.891 --> 01:34:43.874
[SPEAKER_18]: It is MFlow with You Said.

01:34:44.054 --> 01:34:45.215
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's picking tonight's cage match.

01:34:45.235 --> 01:34:45.455
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy!

01:35:53.746 --> 01:35:55.507
Thank you for watching.

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:56.507
See you next time.

01:37:06.914 --> 01:37:08.135
Thank you for watching!

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:22.389
Thank you for watching!

01:39:25.689 --> 01:39:26.451
Thanks for watching!

01:40:15.979 --> 01:40:20.023
[SPEAKER_18]: All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Mflow with You Said.

01:40:20.463 --> 01:40:23.666
[SPEAKER_18]: And now we will say what we thought of that song, starting with Jamie.

01:40:25.088 --> 01:40:25.768
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that song.

01:40:26.729 --> 01:40:32.895
[SPEAKER_09]: I was listening to some Mflow earlier today while I was doing my homework, and that song, I was just sort of like, huh.

01:40:33.876 --> 01:40:34.337
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh,

01:40:35.057 --> 01:40:46.887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I give it an 8 overall, I mean, because it's good, it's solid, I mean... It just sort of stuck out in my head today, and it was better than what I was going to pick, because I don't think that many of our listeners would be quite prepared for Rammstein.

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:48.308
[SPEAKER_18]: Out of hell with what the listeners think.

01:40:48.608 --> 01:40:49.429
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'll hit loser.

01:40:49.469 --> 01:40:50.209
[SPEAKER_18]: It's our show.

01:40:51.571 --> 01:40:52.551
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Bradley, what'd you think?

01:40:53.252 --> 01:40:53.792
[SPEAKER_17]: It was alright.

01:40:54.253 --> 01:40:57.335
[SPEAKER_17]: I started liking it a little bit better as it went on, though, so I'll give it a 7.5.

01:40:58.116 --> 01:40:58.596
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Loki?

01:41:00.858 --> 01:41:01.118
[SPEAKER_17]: Lame.

01:41:01.759 --> 01:41:02.519
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:03.000
[SPEAKER_16]: It...

01:41:03.519 --> 01:41:06.000
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked the other song much better, Astro Sexy.

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:10.823
[SPEAKER_16]: This was not Astro Sexy, and I didn't like it, so it gets a 5.

01:41:12.544 --> 01:41:16.266
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it kind of sounded like elevator music, but good elevator music.

01:41:16.326 --> 01:41:19.288
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, like, I would hope that they would play that in an elevator someday while I'm in it.

01:41:19.568 --> 01:41:20.608
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it was okay.

01:41:20.628 --> 01:41:22.809
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a little bit long, but it was a pretty good song.

01:41:23.230 --> 01:41:24.771
[SPEAKER_18]: I listened to it, especially in an elevator.

01:41:25.211 --> 01:41:26.812
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, I give it like a 7.5 as well, I think.

01:41:26.832 --> 01:41:28.733
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm on the same page as Bradley.

01:41:29.293 --> 01:41:32.855
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, uh, let's move on to song number 3 in tonight's cage match.

01:41:34.286 --> 01:41:45.992
[SPEAKER_18]: I picked it, and it's by an artist called Karma Club, and I actually never heard of them until I just randomly downloaded this song on iTunes, but I was kind of like, huh, this kind of reminds me of, like, SmileDK, like, but American.

01:41:46.192 --> 01:41:48.813
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Loki says he hates it already.

01:41:48.873 --> 01:41:49.974
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you be the judge.

01:41:50.654 --> 01:41:53.956
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a song called Lucky Star, and the group is Karma Club.

01:41:54.016 --> 01:41:56.137
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy, it's my pick for tonight's game match.

01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:38.532
Thank you for watching!

01:43:02.919 --> 01:43:09.924
Last night as I lay dreaming This strangest kind of feeling Revealed its secret meaning And now I know

01:43:35.185 --> 01:43:36.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:44:28.925 --> 01:44:30.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:45:13.821 --> 01:45:37.360
[SPEAKER_05]: Na na na na na Na na na na na No matter where you are, you are my lucky star Na na na na na Na na na na na Na na na na na Na na na na na No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:47.153
[SPEAKER_18]: It's too happy.

01:45:47.213 --> 01:45:48.934
[SPEAKER_18]: I've heard it before.

01:45:48.974 --> 01:45:49.515
[SPEAKER_18]: It gets extreme.

01:46:18.095 --> 01:46:23.777
[SPEAKER_18]: It gets an S. It gets an S. All right.

01:46:24.458 --> 01:46:24.798
[SPEAKER_15]: Bradley.

01:46:25.698 --> 01:46:29.459
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a generic pop song over a dance beat.

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:29.459
5.5.

01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:30.480
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki.

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:32.961
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just like, no.

01:46:33.661 --> 01:46:33.861
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

01:46:34.481 --> 01:46:34.941
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

01:46:35.041 --> 01:46:35.982
[SPEAKER_16]: It gets a 1.

01:46:36.182 --> 01:46:36.362
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

01:46:38.402 --> 01:46:40.563
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, I hope it wins extra bad now.

01:46:40.683 --> 01:46:41.003
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:46:41.624 --> 01:46:42.464
[SPEAKER_18]: I give it like a...

01:46:43.086 --> 01:46:46.187
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we just need to admit that Echo Image is going to win again.

01:47:16.031 --> 01:47:22.355
[SPEAKER_18]: And song number two in tonight's cage match, Mflow with You Said.

01:47:23.216 --> 01:47:28.399
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three in tonight's cage match was Lucky Star by Karma Club.

01:47:55.457 --> 01:47:55.817
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:47:55.897 --> 01:47:58.778
[SPEAKER_18]: Place vote now in our chat room.

01:47:58.818 --> 01:48:05.440
[SPEAKER_18]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote for either MFlow or Karma Club.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:06.960
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:48:08.121 --> 01:48:10.721
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll be looking for your votes there in our chat room.

01:48:11.782 --> 01:48:12.362
[SPEAKER_18]: Meanwhile...

01:48:14.190 --> 01:48:16.451
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my gosh, iTunes just crashed my whole damn computer.

01:48:17.352 --> 01:48:21.374
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're, no, we're okay, we're still up, we're still up and running, but just iTunes crashed, it was kind of scary.

01:48:22.035 --> 01:48:28.999
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, um, meanwhile, I noticed Loki's looking on a site about, that has to do with some other Bomani news that came out this week.

01:48:29.419 --> 01:48:36.203
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess there's this guy, and he does a lot of music for other video games that I don't really play, but apparently a lot of you people know him, and he's kind of popular.

01:48:36.263 --> 01:48:38.525
[SPEAKER_18]: His name's Jesper Kyd, K-Y-D, right?

01:48:38.625 --> 01:48:38.805
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

01:48:39.301 --> 01:48:42.562
[SPEAKER_18]: and he does a lot of songs for other video games.

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:44.662
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have a little clip of some Jesper Kidd songs here?

01:48:45.182 --> 01:48:50.123
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Jesper Kidd has announced he's going to be doing three songs for DDR Ultramix 2, which is kind of nice.

01:48:50.643 --> 01:48:55.704
[SPEAKER_18]: So, alright, we're trying to find a little clip of a Jesper Kidd song to play for you guys here.

01:48:57.164 --> 01:48:59.945
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if we can get a little... Just anything.

01:49:00.385 --> 01:49:02.665
[SPEAKER_18]: Just play us anything so we can get a feel for what this guy sounds like.

01:49:07.106 --> 01:49:07.166
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh.

01:49:07.326 --> 01:49:07.446
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh.

01:49:11.069 --> 01:49:13.670
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, maybe we'll get that industrial music you've been looking for, Jamie.

01:49:14.871 --> 01:49:18.432
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, stuff that's very similar to, like, Quake-type music, you know?

01:49:18.492 --> 01:49:20.533
[SPEAKER_16]: Very, that dark industrial type stuff.

01:49:20.753 --> 01:49:23.774
[SPEAKER_16]: This stuff right here is from Freedom Fighters, the game.

01:49:23.814 --> 01:49:24.795
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the main theme.

01:49:26.055 --> 01:49:27.136
[SPEAKER_16]: This is another fight for freedom.

01:49:27.156 --> 01:49:27.556
[SPEAKER_04]: I want that.

01:49:27.636 --> 01:49:28.156
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

01:49:37.392 --> 01:49:38.133
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, there's those.

01:49:38.673 --> 01:49:42.616
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I was mentioning, or going to mention actually from his website here.

01:49:42.716 --> 01:49:44.997
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me get to him again.

01:49:46.078 --> 01:49:49.160
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to add real fast the three songs that he has announced for Ultramix 2.

01:49:49.781 --> 01:49:51.322
[SPEAKER_18]: Istanbul Cafe is one.

01:49:52.043 --> 01:49:53.283
[SPEAKER_18]: Red Room is another song.

01:49:53.303 --> 01:49:57.947
[SPEAKER_18]: And then this other interesting one, 59 Kid Konami Mix.

01:49:57.987 --> 01:50:00.669
[SPEAKER_18]: And kind of the question now is, is that a remix of .59?

01:50:02.130 --> 01:50:02.550
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it is.

01:50:03.311 --> 01:50:03.911
[SPEAKER_18]: And how do you know this?

01:50:06.112 --> 01:50:07.112
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't say.

01:50:08.112 --> 01:50:08.732
[SPEAKER_16]: But yes, it is.

01:50:09.853 --> 01:50:11.273
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't even know one way or the other.

01:50:11.293 --> 01:50:13.873
[SPEAKER_18]: You know something I don't, then, because I didn't know if this was a remix or not.

01:50:14.313 --> 01:50:20.655
[SPEAKER_16]: Because a certain person mentioned something about a, I don't know, .59 remix.

01:50:22.915 --> 01:50:24.795
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, then I guess it is a .59 remix.

01:50:24.855 --> 01:50:25.395
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't know!

01:50:26.616 --> 01:50:29.776
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, hooray, we get a .59 remix by some random video game guy.

01:50:29.796 --> 01:50:30.356
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll be fun.

01:50:31.356 --> 01:50:31.636
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:50:32.657 --> 01:50:33.217
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't know?

01:50:34.457 --> 01:50:34.817
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

01:50:37.463 --> 01:50:37.783
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:50:39.705 --> 01:50:40.005
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:50:41.546 --> 01:50:43.368
[SPEAKER_18]: We will... What are we going to do?

01:50:43.388 --> 01:50:44.188
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to take a break?

01:50:44.228 --> 01:50:46.730
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to talk about more Bomani news, or what?

01:50:47.491 --> 01:50:48.351
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's break stuff.

01:50:48.812 --> 01:50:49.492
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's break stuff.

01:50:49.552 --> 01:50:50.353
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, you know what?

01:50:50.373 --> 01:50:51.674
[SPEAKER_18]: We did have a request.

01:50:51.974 --> 01:50:54.676
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody wanted to hear that Jamilia song, Superstar.

01:50:54.956 --> 01:50:55.937
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, somebody did.

01:50:56.197 --> 01:50:57.138
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that was you, wasn't it?

01:50:57.158 --> 01:50:58.739
[SPEAKER_24]: Somebody sitting in this big green chair.

01:50:58.759 --> 01:50:59.300
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I thought.

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:06.205
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think the other folks thought it was a good idea as well, so... We'll play that for you guys.

01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:12.346
[SPEAKER_18]: Um... No, we're not going to play Never Ending Story.

01:51:12.827 --> 01:51:17.355
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to play, uh... We're going to play, uh... Where the hell is it?

01:51:19.799 --> 01:51:20.120
[SPEAKER_18]: Where is it?

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:20.861
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's in here.

01:51:21.081 --> 01:51:21.362
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:25.031
[SPEAKER_18]: There it is.

01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:25.752
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do this.

01:51:25.912 --> 01:51:27.094
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, this is great radio, you guys.

01:51:27.154 --> 01:51:28.075
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

01:51:28.115 --> 01:51:30.018
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually the full version because I don't have a DDR edit.

01:51:30.659 --> 01:51:33.262
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you're going to be getting DDR Festival, you'll be playing this song.

01:51:33.302 --> 01:51:37.387
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you're lucky enough to be getting the DDR Europe mixes, you've probably already been playing this song.

01:51:37.447 --> 01:51:38.589
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Jumilia with Superstar.

01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:40.812
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have the cage match winner when we come back from this.

01:51:43.650 --> 01:51:49.152
[SPEAKER_04]: People always talk about All the things they're wrong about Write it on a piece of paper

01:52:12.864 --> 01:52:39.963
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a feeling I'll see you later There's something about this Let's keep it moving And if it's good, yes, just get something cooking Cause I really wanna rock with you I'm feeling some connection to the things you do I don't know what it is That makes me feel like this I don't know who you are

[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we're back and it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:55:53.650 --> 01:55:59.518
[SPEAKER_18]: And in tonight's cage match, boys and girls, it's a big surprise, a huge surprise.

01:56:01.130 --> 01:56:02.391
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:56:24.048 --> 01:56:27.131
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a tie in tonight's cage match, believe it or not.

01:56:27.771 --> 01:56:33.296
[SPEAKER_18]: Which means someone's going to be breaking the tie, so let's find out what two songs the tie is between.

01:56:33.836 --> 01:56:44.965
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one is... Echo Image.

01:56:46.547 --> 01:56:49.589
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is song number one that is tied in tonight's cage match.

01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:52.752
[SPEAKER_18]: And song number two that is tied in tonight's cage match...

01:56:54.745 --> 01:56:55.925
[SPEAKER_18]: is Lucky Star.

01:56:59.486 --> 01:57:01.326
[SPEAKER_09]: So... A bunch of Enflo haters.

01:57:01.746 --> 01:57:05.367
[SPEAKER_18]: That means, yes, unfortunately, Enflo not feeling the love tonight.

01:57:05.427 --> 01:57:08.668
[SPEAKER_18]: But somebody better be feeling the love from Jamie pretty soon here.

01:57:09.408 --> 01:57:10.408
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's got to break the tie.

01:57:10.448 --> 01:57:17.250
[SPEAKER_18]: The Orange Lounge rules state that when there is a tie in the cage match, the host who didn't end up in the tie gets to break the tie.

01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:18.030
[SPEAKER_18]: And, Jamie?

01:57:19.210 --> 01:57:20.390
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on who's going to pay me.

01:57:21.090 --> 01:57:22.151
[SPEAKER_09]: I accept bribes, you know.

01:57:23.511 --> 01:57:24.311
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll show you my boob.

01:57:25.253 --> 01:57:25.833
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

01:57:27.714 --> 01:57:28.194
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:57:28.275 --> 01:57:29.495
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane, who should I pick?

01:57:31.096 --> 01:57:32.237
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what he's going to say.

01:57:34.438 --> 01:57:36.999
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you want to get something new in there for once?

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:41.201
[SPEAKER_13]: Aren't we a little sick, Echo?

01:57:41.641 --> 01:57:43.582
[SPEAKER_09]: We just don't like happy poppy trees.

01:57:45.103 --> 01:57:45.903
[SPEAKER_18]: But look at it this way.

01:57:45.943 --> 01:57:47.084
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll lose next week for sure.

01:57:50.782 --> 01:57:58.446
[SPEAKER_09]: See, if Echo Image wins again, then I can put in Rammstein and blow out everybody's speakers, and that would win.

01:58:00.967 --> 01:58:01.868
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you really want Rob to win?

01:58:03.509 --> 01:58:04.469
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, too bad, you won.

01:58:08.471 --> 01:58:11.313
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, reverse, alright, fine, then buy a tie vote.

01:58:11.433 --> 01:58:13.234
[SPEAKER_09]: I did it for Shane, okay?

01:58:14.174 --> 01:58:16.376
[SPEAKER_09]: I did it because Shane is my dunk fan.

01:58:17.762 --> 01:58:18.102
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:58:18.122 --> 01:58:18.942
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my dunk buddy.

01:58:18.962 --> 01:58:20.263
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a good cliffhanger, Jamie.

01:58:20.523 --> 01:58:21.563
[SPEAKER_18]: I applaud you for that one.

01:58:21.723 --> 01:58:22.823
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because I'm awesome.

01:58:23.623 --> 01:58:25.024
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody wishes they were cool like me.

01:58:25.324 --> 01:58:26.644
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:58:26.784 --> 01:58:30.425
[SPEAKER_18]: Echo Image wins a nice cage match by a whopping... Oh, that's so sweet.

01:58:32.325 --> 01:58:34.245
[SPEAKER_18]: You had their hearts racing for a minute there.

01:58:38.046 --> 01:58:44.448
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what's going to happen the minute that that song gets bumped out of the cage match is that somebody's going to put in that never-ending story make.

01:58:44.468 --> 01:58:46.168
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll have Echo Image for the rest of our lives.

01:58:47.932 --> 01:58:49.833
[SPEAKER_18]: I already know Loki's planning on doing it.

01:58:51.234 --> 01:58:51.554
[SPEAKER_18]: Liar.

01:58:53.596 --> 01:58:54.016
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:58:56.197 --> 01:58:57.078
[SPEAKER_18]: More Bomani news.

01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:59.160
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a couple other Bomani games.

01:58:59.741 --> 01:59:01.181
[SPEAKER_18]: They've kind of slipped under the cracks.

01:59:01.221 --> 01:59:03.621
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't talked about them a whole lot.

01:59:03.681 --> 01:59:06.442
[SPEAKER_18]: Tokyo Game Show happened this last week.

01:59:06.462 --> 01:59:07.802
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about DDR Festival.

01:59:07.902 --> 01:59:09.303
[SPEAKER_18]: They had a new movie that showed there.

01:59:09.423 --> 01:59:10.963
[SPEAKER_18]: It showed the character customization.

01:59:10.983 --> 01:59:13.144
[SPEAKER_18]: It showed us a little more what was going on with DDR Festival.

01:59:13.924 --> 01:59:21.266
[SPEAKER_18]: Also coming out was some more information on Poppin' Music and Beatmania 2DX.

01:59:21.566 --> 01:59:26.507
[SPEAKER_18]: Apparently they had some folks that were actually doing a performance there at Tokyo Game Show.

01:59:26.943 --> 01:59:27.384
[SPEAKER_18]: VJTA-K Slake

01:59:49.031 --> 01:59:56.995
[SPEAKER_18]: and LED vs. Slake was performing, which kind of gives you a hint that, gee, I wonder if there's going to be an 8th consumer style song like that.

01:59:57.656 --> 02:00:04.059
[SPEAKER_18]: And, let's see, there was a song called Human Scramble from the anime A Human Crossing.

02:00:04.159 --> 02:00:11.202
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess it was something performed by Aki Asahina.

02:00:14.124 --> 02:00:14.604
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

02:00:15.064 --> 02:00:15.725
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm so white.

02:00:15.765 --> 02:00:16.925
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, boys and girls.

02:00:17.766 --> 02:00:18.086
[SPEAKER_18]: Try that.

02:00:18.948 --> 02:00:21.449
[SPEAKER_18]: Aki Asahina No, I'm going to have the 8th style

02:00:38.311 --> 02:00:45.997
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a group called Guzzle that performed, and they did a song called The Bottom of Same Sky and a song called Egoist, which is going to be in Poppin' Music 10.

02:00:46.978 --> 02:00:51.182
[SPEAKER_18]: And the full version of Egoist is going to show up on the Poppin' Music 10 Limited Edition.

02:00:51.742 --> 02:00:57.787
[SPEAKER_18]: So lots of fun news there for Poppin' Music 10 and 2DX8 style as well.

02:00:57.847 --> 02:01:04.433
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Sana and Togo were there, and they performed a song called Custom Made Girl Not For Sale.

02:01:05.543 --> 02:01:06.504
[SPEAKER_24]: Dude, that's awesome.

02:01:06.664 --> 02:01:07.886
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the best song name ever.

02:01:07.966 --> 02:01:12.051
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds very much like a poppin' music song, but we don't really know which way it's going yet.

02:01:12.712 --> 02:01:17.778
[SPEAKER_18]: And then a song called Everyday Lovely Day, which is going to be on the Poppin' Music 10 consumer style.

02:01:17.838 --> 02:01:22.064
[SPEAKER_18]: And then a remixed version by LED is going to be in 2DX8 style.

02:01:22.734 --> 02:01:31.900
[SPEAKER_18]: So lots of new stuff coming out on these two soundtracks, Poppin' Music 10 and 2DXA Style, as well as in the games that are coming out November 18th.

02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:32.800
[SPEAKER_09]: We love LED.

02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:33.441
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

02:01:34.021 --> 02:01:35.782
[SPEAKER_09]: We love LED and groovy.

02:01:36.743 --> 02:01:38.764
[SPEAKER_18]: Why does this stuff all have to come out at the same time?

02:01:38.824 --> 02:01:39.344
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the problem.

02:01:39.364 --> 02:01:40.004
[SPEAKER_18]: I got no money.

02:01:40.165 --> 02:01:40.605
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Poe.

02:01:41.005 --> 02:01:44.127
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they want to get as much money from us as possible.

02:01:44.147 --> 02:01:45.488
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to suck us dry.

02:01:45.949 --> 02:01:46.429
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess so.

02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:50.132
[SPEAKER_09]: They want all of our money to belong to Konami of Japan.

02:01:51.233 --> 02:01:51.813
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess so.

02:01:52.113 --> 02:01:52.954
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a corporate plot.

02:01:54.215 --> 02:01:54.936
[SPEAKER_09]: Conspiracy.

02:01:55.916 --> 02:02:01.661
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know that K-Set's using all the money to build a giant robot.

02:02:01.701 --> 02:02:02.941
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using it to build Metal Gear.

02:02:03.822 --> 02:02:04.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

02:02:06.084 --> 02:02:06.624
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

02:02:08.045 --> 02:02:09.066
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, okay.

02:02:09.226 --> 02:02:10.087
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, gotcha.

02:02:12.209 --> 02:02:13.670
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to think of any other Bomani news.

02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:18.971
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I'm going to go over to Loki, since we haven't heard from him in a little bit, and ask Loki, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

02:02:19.912 --> 02:02:20.772
[SPEAKER_18]: Surely there must be something.

02:02:21.912 --> 02:02:22.873
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure there is.

02:02:24.453 --> 02:02:25.413
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what that is.

02:02:26.634 --> 02:02:27.154
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me look.

02:02:28.246 --> 02:02:35.053
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, other than TDR Maniacs being fucking slow as hell, let's see here.

02:02:35.854 --> 02:02:46.865
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I mentioned last week that Alpha 24 came out, not that anyone cares why they're up to Alpha 24 is beyond me, but they are, so, yeah.

02:02:47.766 --> 02:02:47.846
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

02:02:48.905 --> 02:02:53.908
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, there's a poll, I think, still going on for what characters should be ripped next.

02:02:54.308 --> 02:02:58.730
[SPEAKER_16]: Since the 5th Mix character is almost completely ripped for use with Step Mania.

02:02:59.230 --> 02:03:01.091
[SPEAKER_16]: Some themes are being worked on right now.

02:03:01.211 --> 02:03:06.114
[SPEAKER_16]: The DDR9 Red, which is obviously a rip-off of 2DX Red's theme.

02:03:06.734 --> 02:03:11.797
[SPEAKER_16]: And Transmakina 5, which a lot of people that are out there in the sim world know about.

02:03:13.038 --> 02:03:13.358
[SPEAKER_16]: Also...

02:03:14.708 --> 02:03:18.271
[SPEAKER_16]: There's, of course, Technofiend still being worked on.

02:03:18.471 --> 02:03:19.412
[SPEAKER_16]: Really nice right now.

02:03:20.473 --> 02:03:22.194
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, that's just basic theme stuff.

02:03:22.855 --> 02:03:33.463
[SPEAKER_16]: DDRUK will have Ultramix Pack 6 and the DDR Extreme US tracks as soon as their downloads come back up.

02:03:34.484 --> 02:03:36.526
[SPEAKER_16]: The Extreme tracks, I know, are almost done.

02:03:36.626 --> 02:03:38.407
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultramix Pack 6 are done.

02:03:38.427 --> 02:03:40.289
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just waiting to be uploaded or...

02:03:41.395 --> 02:03:42.055
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't fire them!

02:03:42.195 --> 02:03:50.057
[SPEAKER_16]: I never hold a remix contest I'd say I'd have a few judges and they would have to be local so I can yell at them

02:04:11.021 --> 02:04:14.284
[SPEAKER_18]: Fire the goddamn judges and set some deadlines next time.

02:04:14.364 --> 02:04:15.065
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

02:04:15.145 --> 02:04:17.367
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, sorry, but, you know.

02:04:17.647 --> 02:04:22.191
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, they also had their server thing where they got a new server recently, so, you know, there's that.

02:04:22.731 --> 02:04:24.833
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, alright, alright.

02:04:25.194 --> 02:04:25.794
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine, whatever.

02:04:25.994 --> 02:04:27.316
[SPEAKER_18]: Beggars can't be choosers, I guess.

02:04:27.636 --> 02:04:28.196
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can.

02:04:29.858 --> 02:04:31.219
[SPEAKER_18]: Any exciting remixes, though?

02:04:31.319 --> 02:04:33.581
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you played some of them a couple weeks ago when I wasn't here, huh?

02:04:34.082 --> 02:04:34.522
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, alright.

02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:40.594
[SPEAKER_18]: I just found out, just, just found out just now, there's a good chance I'm not going to be here next week.

02:04:41.554 --> 02:04:41.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

02:04:42.255 --> 02:04:43.356
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, something's going on.

02:04:43.797 --> 02:04:44.357
[SPEAKER_18]: You know about it.

02:04:45.939 --> 02:04:46.559
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you playing?

02:04:48.421 --> 02:04:49.382
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, way to go.

02:04:50.043 --> 02:04:54.527
[SPEAKER_18]: There's something going on, I'll tell you off air, but you actually already know about it, you just probably forgot it was next Sunday.

02:04:54.708 --> 02:04:54.848
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:04:54.888 --> 02:04:55.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:04:58.226 --> 02:04:59.267
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, now she makes O-Face.

02:04:59.527 --> 02:05:00.147
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes.

02:05:00.187 --> 02:05:01.028
[SPEAKER_08]: I may not be here either.

02:05:02.449 --> 02:05:05.690
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll probably have a pre-taped show next week for you guys.

02:05:05.710 --> 02:05:08.352
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to go to Golfland and do a show again.

02:05:08.552 --> 02:05:10.653
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I kind of want to do a show from the ghetto.

02:05:11.573 --> 02:05:12.654
[SPEAKER_09]: That means going to Scandia.

02:05:12.694 --> 02:05:14.575
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be fun, to do a show from the ghetto.

02:05:15.335 --> 02:05:16.456
[SPEAKER_09]: In the ghetto.

02:05:16.796 --> 02:05:17.196
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

02:05:18.497 --> 02:05:19.417
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

02:05:19.457 --> 02:05:22.259
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that our last one we did at Golfland was funny when they almost threw us out.

02:05:22.739 --> 02:05:23.640
[SPEAKER_18]: That was pretty funny.

02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:24.280
[SPEAKER_18]: I would kind of...

02:05:26.623 --> 02:05:28.505
[SPEAKER_09]: until we said, but we're promoting you.

02:05:28.565 --> 02:05:29.286
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good idea.

02:05:29.326 --> 02:05:33.650
[SPEAKER_18]: We could go to Golf Line and play the new Step Mania machine, although I hear it kind of sucks, and that's not Loki's fault.

02:05:33.690 --> 02:05:35.412
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just the fact that the computer inside sucks.

02:05:37.534 --> 02:05:45.141
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the only way it sucks is the fact that it has a default skin with no movies, but other than that, the pads do suck, and that's not my fault at all.

02:05:45.161 --> 02:05:46.723
[SPEAKER_16]: That's their shit, you know.

02:05:47.583 --> 02:05:53.128
[SPEAKER_16]: I tried, hey, my original computer specifications worked very well with video and all that shit.

02:05:53.448 --> 02:05:59.073
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, you know what, when someone else does the job for you, it just doesn't quite come out how you wanted it.

02:06:01.475 --> 02:06:05.559
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I just don't care because I wasn't going to spend any more time nor money on that.

02:06:05.959 --> 02:06:15.187
[SPEAKER_16]: However, what has come to my attention, and I plan on doing this, I have to come up with $200 though, is, um, apparently...

02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:17.892
[SPEAKER_16]: Channel Beat's having a sale.

02:06:19.053 --> 02:06:19.453
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

02:06:19.974 --> 02:06:20.735
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what that means?

02:06:21.015 --> 02:06:24.099
[SPEAKER_16]: That means I get my parts for my cabinet.

02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:28.945
[SPEAKER_16]: Those parts being my Dance Maniac sensors, which drop from $59 a piece to $29 a piece.

02:06:29.706 --> 02:06:30.046
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

02:06:34.981 --> 02:06:39.103
[SPEAKER_16]: Arcade Perfect, Dance Maniac Sensors, and all the other shit.

02:06:39.363 --> 02:06:43.926
[SPEAKER_16]: I just have to figure out if I can use those sensors or not, because I don't know if it connects to an Airface board.

02:06:45.246 --> 02:06:46.867
[SPEAKER_09]: You can always make modifications for Airface.

02:06:46.887 --> 02:06:48.868
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure I could get to work.

02:06:50.409 --> 02:06:53.131
[SPEAKER_09]: Break out a ballpoint pen and some paper clips.

02:06:53.831 --> 02:06:59.254
[SPEAKER_16]: What I found out that's very interesting, and it does tie in with Step Mania...

02:06:59.915 --> 02:07:02.117
[SPEAKER_16]: Stepmania's license agreement, basically.

02:07:02.637 --> 02:07:09.462
[SPEAKER_16]: You can take Stepmania, modify it how you want, as far as theme, whatever.

02:07:09.742 --> 02:07:11.043
[SPEAKER_16]: Put your own songs in it.

02:07:12.324 --> 02:07:13.365
[SPEAKER_16]: Create your own theme.

02:07:14.245 --> 02:07:15.146
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can sell it.

02:07:15.586 --> 02:07:16.927
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can make money off of it.

02:07:17.448 --> 02:07:20.410
[SPEAKER_16]: And all you have to do is just say, powered by Stepmania or whatever.

02:07:21.431 --> 02:07:22.131
[SPEAKER_16]: That got me thinking.

02:07:22.431 --> 02:07:24.313
[SPEAKER_16]: Wouldn't that be cool to make a new arcade game?

02:07:26.494 --> 02:07:26.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

02:07:27.075 --> 02:07:27.375
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

02:07:27.944 --> 02:07:30.166
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make something like Dance Maniacs.

02:07:30.286 --> 02:07:33.748
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to at least do it for my cabinet itself.

02:07:33.888 --> 02:07:35.169
[SPEAKER_09]: The waving the hands game.

02:07:35.409 --> 02:07:41.793
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I want to do something across with Dance Maniacs and... Is it like Technomotion?

02:07:41.893 --> 02:07:43.954
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not necessarily like Technomotion.

02:07:44.014 --> 02:07:52.600
[SPEAKER_16]: Dance Maniacs and Para Para, which basically would be... It would sort of be like Para Para, but it would have top and bottom sensors in a way.

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:53.961
[SPEAKER_09]: Make the country line dancing game.

02:07:54.341 --> 02:07:55.681
[SPEAKER_16]: No, God, you're getting line dancing.

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:56.422
[SPEAKER_16]: That's retarded.

02:07:56.742 --> 02:08:03.503
[SPEAKER_16]: What I want to do, though, is I want to have infrared sensors, because you can actually do some sensors where they have different trigger points, you know, below a certain level.

02:08:03.623 --> 02:08:06.404
[SPEAKER_16]: So I basically have, like, you know, up to waist, high, or whatever.

02:08:06.744 --> 02:08:19.387
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be one set of five sensors, and then above that would be another set, but without those stupid, you know, actual things in front of you, so you don't keep hitting them with your hand, and then have, you know, cool, like, techno trance stuff to go with it.

02:08:19.767 --> 02:08:20.847
[SPEAKER_09]: Do mocap dance.

02:08:21.423 --> 02:08:31.534
[SPEAKER_16]: and be awesome but that's what I want to do at least but who knows I just have to see because I have the only problem with the buy enough channel beat you have to spend a $200 minimum ouch

02:08:33.993 --> 02:08:54.345
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I can buy the Dance Maniac sensors, that's gonna be about, you know, say I buy three, or no, four of them, that's gonna be, you know, a good, you know, $120, and I still have $80 left that I have to spend on that, so I can maybe buy another sensor and some miscellaneous crap, and then, you know, maybe set up this weird dance thing or whatever.

02:08:56.106 --> 02:08:57.186
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, I don't know.

02:08:58.447 --> 02:09:00.548
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it'd be cool, but, you know, what do I know?

02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:03.350
[SPEAKER_09]: You could buy a turntable.

02:09:04.818 --> 02:09:11.363
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't buy turntables off there, and I would buy the turntables to RK Perfect Blends if they sold them, but they don't, and that pisses me off.

02:09:11.423 --> 02:09:21.210
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, where the fuck, if something breaks on your Bomani cabinet, or whatever, where the fuck do you buy the parts that aren't listed on Channel B?

02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:22.130
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I want to know.

02:09:22.350 --> 02:09:27.694
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that a lot of them, you have to order them from the Japanese distributors, like from Konami.

02:09:27.714 --> 02:09:31.797
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I want to order the exact turntable parts.

02:09:34.085 --> 02:09:34.505
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.490
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:01.711
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll just see.

02:10:01.871 --> 02:10:03.614
[SPEAKER_16]: I just need to finish my cabinet first.

02:10:04.054 --> 02:10:06.637
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to stop taking on extra projects.

02:10:07.599 --> 02:10:10.462
[SPEAKER_16]: See, the problem is right now... Well, I'm focusing.

02:10:10.963 --> 02:10:12.405
[SPEAKER_16]: My fucking iPack's broken.

02:10:12.465 --> 02:10:17.431
[SPEAKER_16]: My old iPack 2 is broken, I think, because it's been flipping out weird when I hook up the...

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:42.502
[SPEAKER_16]: DancePads to it, and so I bought a new one that's coming, uh, IPAC, uh, what is it, Value Edition V or something like that, which, oddly enough, has more sensors, um, than, uh, the IPAC 2, and it's USB only, but I'm, that's coming this week, and so once I get that, then I'll be able to work on my cabinet again, because... I think that you need to open your gate to hell.

02:10:45.031 --> 02:10:46.233
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to do that later.

02:10:46.393 --> 02:10:49.717
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to finish that too, but I need to get this stuff done.

02:10:49.998 --> 02:10:58.449
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to get my cabinet stuff done because the weather is going to be turning for the worse and I won't be able to work on it during the winter because it's raining like a bitch and I have my wood.

02:10:58.469 --> 02:11:02.895
[SPEAKER_16]: So what I want to do is I want to fucking sit down, get a friend to help me, and just

02:11:03.348 --> 02:11:11.173
[SPEAKER_16]: Chop up all that wood that I've got out there to like, you know, nice two foot by four foot sections so I can actually, you know, finish that.

02:11:12.614 --> 02:11:15.055
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we're not calling it Loki motion because that's retarded.

02:11:16.116 --> 02:11:16.776
[SPEAKER_24]: I liked it.

02:11:17.296 --> 02:11:18.317
[SPEAKER_24]: That was cute.

02:11:18.777 --> 02:11:20.138
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cute, but it's retarded.

02:11:20.618 --> 02:11:21.359
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki motion.

02:11:21.979 --> 02:11:22.760
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki motion.

02:11:25.321 --> 02:11:26.282
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw my comment.

02:11:26.322 --> 02:11:27.202
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too Kylie.

02:11:30.064 --> 02:11:31.905
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, I'm done.

02:11:32.358 --> 02:11:33.880
[SPEAKER_16]: So, what else are we going to talk about?

02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:35.121
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to get pissed off.

02:11:35.201 --> 02:11:35.601
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

02:11:36.983 --> 02:11:40.066
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to ask for a minute, what the fuck is wrong with everybody tonight?

02:11:40.126 --> 02:11:43.609
[SPEAKER_18]: And not you guys, but I'm like, God, it's like, is it something in the air?

02:11:43.809 --> 02:11:45.271
[SPEAKER_18]: Is everybody on their period?

02:11:45.331 --> 02:11:46.412
[SPEAKER_18]: What is going on tonight?

02:11:46.933 --> 02:11:49.795
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, it's just like, everything is dead tonight.

02:11:49.896 --> 02:11:53.179
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, are we being invaded by aliens?

02:11:53.299 --> 02:11:54.100
[SPEAKER_19]: What is going on?

02:11:55.621 --> 02:11:56.622
[SPEAKER_19]: Is our show old?

02:11:56.982 --> 02:11:58.243
[SPEAKER_19]: Have we jumped the shark?

02:11:58.603 --> 02:12:00.123
[SPEAKER_09]: We did not jump the shark, okay?

02:12:00.143 --> 02:12:02.825
[SPEAKER_09]: If we were going to jump the shark, it would have been when we let Loki sing.

02:12:03.965 --> 02:12:04.325
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree.

02:12:09.808 --> 02:12:10.868
[SPEAKER_18]: People need to wake up.

02:12:12.349 --> 02:12:12.889
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

02:12:13.809 --> 02:12:15.330
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sleepy too, Rob.

02:12:15.610 --> 02:12:16.150
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

02:12:16.911 --> 02:12:21.713
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying everybody's dead, but it's just like, God, I mean, seriously, tonight's kind of like deader than usual.

02:12:21.753 --> 02:12:21.893
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:12:22.926 --> 02:12:24.587
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

02:12:24.928 --> 02:12:25.668
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

02:12:26.969 --> 02:12:28.630
[SPEAKER_18]: I know just the thing to perk people up.

02:12:28.730 --> 02:12:30.131
[SPEAKER_18]: I know just the thing.

02:12:30.271 --> 02:12:31.331
[SPEAKER_18]: I know just the thing.

02:12:31.392 --> 02:12:31.612
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob.

02:12:31.812 --> 02:12:35.774
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all.

02:12:36.194 --> 02:12:37.015
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me feel better.

02:12:39.136 --> 02:12:44.940
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like a schoolgirl combined with Dr. Evil, but you know.

02:12:46.521 --> 02:12:48.882
[SPEAKER_24]: It's very cute, Rob.

02:12:49.363 --> 02:12:49.843
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cute.

02:12:50.956 --> 02:12:56.358
[SPEAKER_18]: Some people are saying that they're trying to call us and they can't get through because I'm being a bitch and haven't opened the Skype line, huh?

02:12:57.479 --> 02:13:00.880
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I turned it off, but I turned it back on just now, so that's fine.

02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:08.183
[SPEAKER_18]: If somebody wants to call us and tell us that, you know... If someone wants to pick up the pace a little bit... Call us or we'll play Let Them Move.

02:13:08.283 --> 02:13:08.783
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we will not.

02:13:09.063 --> 02:13:10.884
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I wouldn't even do that.

02:13:11.404 --> 02:13:16.066
[SPEAKER_18]: I would do that if, like, nobody was... I don't know, if I really wasn't getting something my way.

02:13:16.086 --> 02:13:16.466
[SPEAKER_09]: The 1-900-HOT-POOP.

02:13:21.128 --> 02:13:22.149
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yay, we're getting a call.

02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:22.810
[SPEAKER_18]: See, that's how it works.

02:13:23.130 --> 02:13:24.251
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, you're on Orange Ones Radio.

02:13:25.192 --> 02:13:25.633
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

02:13:25.913 --> 02:13:26.393
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

02:13:26.413 --> 02:13:26.453
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

02:13:27.494 --> 02:13:28.435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

02:13:28.996 --> 02:13:29.596
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

02:13:30.257 --> 02:13:34.461
[SPEAKER_07]: If I try to turn it down on the 365, it turns everything else down.

02:13:35.261 --> 02:13:35.622
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-oh.

02:13:36.743 --> 02:13:39.986
[SPEAKER_07]: So, see, if I mute it, then it mutes you guys.

02:13:40.186 --> 02:13:40.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

02:13:40.446 --> 02:13:42.208
[SPEAKER_07]: So I suppose maybe I should just stop it?

02:13:43.769 --> 02:13:44.530
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear us okay?

02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.630
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:13:45.151 --> 02:13:46.512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can hear you guys now.

02:13:46.592 --> 02:13:47.092
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

02:13:47.112 --> 02:13:47.292
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:13:47.532 --> 02:13:48.373
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we can hear you fine.

02:13:48.393 --> 02:13:51.154
[SPEAKER_18]: You're like one of the most clear callers we've ever had call the show.

02:13:51.754 --> 02:13:52.235
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

02:13:52.275 --> 02:13:56.037
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just got my headset a couple days ago.

02:13:56.257 --> 02:13:58.198
[SPEAKER_07]: So I finally decided to call and say hello.

02:13:58.298 --> 02:13:59.759
[SPEAKER_19]: Kudos to your internet connection.

02:13:59.779 --> 02:14:00.639
[SPEAKER_19]: Now tell us who you are.

02:14:01.119 --> 02:14:01.980
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Raichan.

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:02.600
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Raichan!

02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:03.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi!

02:14:03.981 --> 02:14:04.721
[SPEAKER_18]: A new caller.

02:14:04.841 --> 02:14:06.562
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't get a lot of girls calling the show.

02:14:07.022 --> 02:14:08.223
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm glad that Raichan could call.

02:14:08.243 --> 02:14:11.224
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we had Misty, and I think Irene called a few while back.

02:14:11.264 --> 02:14:13.145
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, we don't get a whole lot in comparison.

02:14:13.526 --> 02:14:14.226
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's up, Raichan?

02:14:14.907 --> 02:14:15.668
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, not a whole lot.

02:14:15.708 --> 02:14:18.610
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to call you guys before, just as you guys went to the break.

02:14:19.271 --> 02:14:22.473
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, when we were talking about DDR Festival and Quad Mode and all that stuff.

02:14:23.134 --> 02:14:23.334
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

02:14:23.794 --> 02:14:24.375
[SPEAKER_18]: What was on your mind?

02:14:25.195 --> 02:14:28.358
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just the whole, I'm one of those import only.

02:14:28.478 --> 02:14:30.079
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have US versions at all.

02:14:30.319 --> 02:14:31.280
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any reason for that?

02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:38.986
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it just because you bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 first and then... Two years ago, when my first boyfriend and I broke up.

02:14:39.447 --> 02:14:39.687
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-huh.

02:14:40.341 --> 02:14:45.044
[SPEAKER_07]: I had him, he owed me money, so I bought a Japanese PS2 with what he owed me.

02:14:45.264 --> 02:14:45.985
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, you know what?

02:14:46.385 --> 02:14:52.209
[SPEAKER_18]: I inherited a 3rd and 4th style out of a previous relationship, so isn't that the best way to get new stuff?

02:14:52.909 --> 02:14:53.509
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

02:14:55.511 --> 02:14:57.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of my DDRs actually do come from other people.

02:14:59.093 --> 02:14:59.613
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

02:15:01.094 --> 02:15:02.655
[SPEAKER_07]: My 3rd mix I bought for myself.

02:15:02.775 --> 02:15:06.297
[SPEAKER_07]: My 4th my mom bought for me in exchange for doing housework.

02:15:07.198 --> 02:15:08.659
[SPEAKER_07]: 5th mix Jason bought for me.

02:15:10.213 --> 02:15:19.157
[SPEAKER_07]: 6th Mix my brother got me for Christmas, 7th I bought for myself just before a tournament, Extreme my second boyfriend got for me.

02:15:19.297 --> 02:15:19.698
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow!

02:15:20.458 --> 02:15:20.838
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

02:15:21.398 --> 02:15:23.419
[SPEAKER_19]: I want people to start buying me my Bimani.

02:15:23.459 --> 02:15:24.440
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do I have to buy it?

02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:27.261
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Loki did buy DDR Extreme, so there's that.

02:15:27.802 --> 02:15:31.524
[SPEAKER_07]: The festival will be a gift from somebody, too, whenever that finally comes.

02:15:31.564 --> 02:15:31.804
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow!

02:15:31.884 --> 02:15:33.725
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where you have the collection to rival mine.

02:15:34.935 --> 02:15:38.277
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Rai Chan actually has her collection posted.

02:15:38.537 --> 02:15:40.839
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it public on the internet somewhere where we can see it?

02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:43.420
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in my live journal user info.

02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:43.981
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

02:15:44.401 --> 02:15:45.141
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want me to take it.

02:15:45.161 --> 02:15:46.122
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to say that on the air?

02:15:46.162 --> 02:15:47.423
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if you want to say it on the air.

02:15:47.443 --> 02:15:48.363
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter to me.

02:15:49.284 --> 02:15:50.765
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'll post a link in the chat room.

02:15:51.585 --> 02:15:52.185
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, there you go.

02:15:52.205 --> 02:15:53.146
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way.

02:15:53.866 --> 02:15:56.008
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can actually take a look at Rai Chan's Bomani collection.

02:15:56.048 --> 02:15:57.449
[SPEAKER_19]: It's quite impressive.

02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:59.990
[SPEAKER_19]: Her Bomani penis is quite large.

02:16:02.031 --> 02:16:02.312
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um...

02:16:03.559 --> 02:16:05.780
[SPEAKER_07]: I got rid of my pop-up music controller.

02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:06.680
[SPEAKER_07]: I sold it to Angel.

02:16:07.221 --> 02:16:12.203
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I still have seven, which I'll give to Jason, and then nine, most likely, I'll sell.

02:16:12.603 --> 02:16:13.183
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll buy it from you.

02:16:14.283 --> 02:16:15.964
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:16:16.044 --> 02:16:18.025
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a pop-up music controller and a pop-up music.

02:16:18.886 --> 02:16:26.530
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I sold my controller recently, so I still have 7 and 9 sitting around just because I didn't know anyone else to sell it to.

02:16:26.850 --> 02:16:28.590
[SPEAKER_18]: I've borrowed that controller too, which is funny.

02:16:28.630 --> 02:16:33.453
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to sell any pop of music you have that you want to sell, you've got to buy it right here, because I need pop of music.

02:16:33.473 --> 02:16:34.473
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, cool.

02:16:35.334 --> 02:16:42.737
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, boy, not only do you get people to buy your new stuff for you, but you get people to buy your old shit too, I mean, god.

02:16:44.162 --> 02:16:48.627
[SPEAKER_07]: and Jason wants me to post a picture of him and I, which I'll go find the link to.

02:16:49.148 --> 02:16:50.629
[SPEAKER_19]: Aww, he wants to be mushy.

02:16:51.210 --> 02:16:55.495
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a picture of him and I both with our entire Bimani collections.

02:16:55.895 --> 02:16:57.838
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that is so nauseatingly cute.

02:16:58.158 --> 02:16:59.760
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of his chicken hat?

02:16:59.780 --> 02:17:03.504
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of the chicken hat picture I took at E3?

02:17:05.433 --> 02:17:08.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you saw that I used that as one of my LiveJournal user pictures.

02:17:09.074 --> 02:17:10.715
[SPEAKER_18]: I just had to bring that up because I love that picture.

02:17:10.975 --> 02:17:12.356
[SPEAKER_07]: We were like, you have to wear the chicken hat.

02:17:13.316 --> 02:17:13.896
[SPEAKER_09]: Hug the cow.

02:17:15.397 --> 02:17:16.037
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

02:17:16.858 --> 02:17:17.658
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

02:17:17.958 --> 02:17:19.619
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to come up and visit us next.

02:17:19.759 --> 02:17:22.560
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, did you and Jason actually meet through Bomani?

02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:25.701
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Freak and LiveJournal, pretty much.

02:17:25.841 --> 02:17:27.422
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, that's kind of cool.

02:17:28.062 --> 02:17:28.482
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at that.

02:17:28.522 --> 02:17:30.023
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Freak brings people together.

02:17:30.743 --> 02:17:33.304
[SPEAKER_18]: It not only tears people apart, but it brings them together as well.

02:17:33.939 --> 02:17:34.319
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

02:17:34.619 --> 02:17:38.141
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the internet is a good place to meet people.

02:17:38.221 --> 02:17:39.922
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the internet gets a bad rap sometimes.

02:17:40.182 --> 02:17:41.283
[SPEAKER_18]: It can't be a good place to meet people.

02:17:41.303 --> 02:17:42.184
[SPEAKER_09]: I met Dan online.

02:17:42.484 --> 02:17:42.924
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

02:17:43.064 --> 02:17:43.644
[SPEAKER_09]: Through fandom.

02:17:45.986 --> 02:17:47.887
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything else you want to comment on, Ryachan?

02:17:48.547 --> 02:17:52.069
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, just calling to say hi since I finally have everything set up.

02:17:52.349 --> 02:17:55.471
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, hello and thank you for the call and enjoy DER Festival when it comes out.

02:17:55.531 --> 02:17:58.733
[SPEAKER_18]: Let us know how it is since none of us are probably even going to bother to get it.

02:17:58.773 --> 02:17:59.973
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to have to be our reviewer.

02:18:00.754 --> 02:18:01.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:18:01.174 --> 02:18:01.514
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:18:02.074 --> 02:18:02.855
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thank you guys.

02:18:03.126 --> 02:18:03.747
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, take care.

02:18:04.627 --> 02:18:04.908
[SPEAKER_19]: Bye.

02:18:05.068 --> 02:18:05.588
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for the call.

02:18:05.748 --> 02:18:06.429
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that was so nice.

02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:11.153
[SPEAKER_19]: We got some comments in the chat room that she's clearer than we are.

02:18:12.454 --> 02:18:13.996
[SPEAKER_19]: Her microphone's better than ours.

02:18:14.156 --> 02:18:15.777
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to know what kind of microphone she's got.

02:18:15.958 --> 02:18:16.518
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

02:18:17.539 --> 02:18:19.801
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, Chen, you're going to have to send me an email.

02:18:20.562 --> 02:18:25.326
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you ever want to send me an email, if you're a stalker fan and want to send me an email, that's fine.

02:18:25.386 --> 02:18:28.469
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a good place to go.

02:18:30.543 --> 02:18:34.444
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I guess we're going to close up the Skype line because I want to do a break because we've got to come back.

02:18:34.544 --> 02:18:36.624
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to do the FUs of the week.

02:18:36.945 --> 02:18:37.805
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our favorite part.

02:18:37.825 --> 02:18:38.005
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

02:18:38.025 --> 02:18:38.645
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got to do them.

02:18:38.985 --> 02:18:41.145
[SPEAKER_18]: So send your FUs in now.

02:18:41.285 --> 02:18:44.186
[SPEAKER_18]: And in this break, we're going to hear some keyboard mania music.

02:18:45.506 --> 02:18:48.867
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I knew that would be the first word out of your mouth, Jamie.

02:18:49.707 --> 02:18:50.708
[SPEAKER_09]: I love sensation.

02:18:50.728 --> 02:18:51.988
[SPEAKER_18]: It's play sensation.

02:18:52.028 --> 02:18:54.068
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's the first thing I have queued up for you.

02:18:54.568 --> 02:18:55.189
[SPEAKER_18]: So here we go.

02:18:55.209 --> 02:18:56.549
[SPEAKER_18]: A whole break of keyboard mania music.

02:18:56.569 --> 02:18:56.869
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

02:18:56.889 --> 02:18:57.269
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back.

02:20:38.619 --> 02:20:40.100
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

02:25:18.769 --> 02:25:19.569
We are back.

02:25:19.589 --> 02:25:26.571
What the hell are you laughing at over there?

02:25:49.794 --> 02:25:50.455
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing is funny!

02:25:51.936 --> 02:25:56.138
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm laughing at DJ Nostalgia's icon on DDR Maniacs.

02:25:56.238 --> 02:26:05.244
[SPEAKER_16]: It's this little stick figure trying to pick up a flower to give it to the female stick figure, but the flower keeps moving, so then he finally gets pissed off and kicks the flower and it hits the chick in the head and she runs off.

02:26:06.305 --> 02:26:06.645
[SPEAKER_24]: Funny.

02:26:08.706 --> 02:26:09.747
[SPEAKER_18]: Hilarious.

02:26:10.307 --> 02:26:11.268
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I have to say.

02:26:12.629 --> 02:26:17.792
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well, the theme of tonight has kind of been like being dead, I guess, because...

02:26:18.416 --> 02:26:19.256
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys have all been dead.

02:26:19.636 --> 02:26:24.478
[SPEAKER_18]: So we decided we're going to pick things up a little bit with some good old-fashioned FUs.

02:26:25.358 --> 02:26:28.239
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, why do we have to do some good old-fashioned FUs anyway?

02:26:28.259 --> 02:26:33.501
[SPEAKER_09]: We are full of angst and anger, and if we don't let it out, we'll explode and destroy half of the world.

02:26:33.521 --> 02:26:41.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is bad.

02:26:41.804 --> 02:26:42.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is justice.

02:26:49.033 --> 02:26:49.773
[SPEAKER_09]: My first F.U.

02:26:49.793 --> 02:26:54.315
[SPEAKER_09]: of the evening goes to the driver of this Volkswagen Passat that was in front of me.

02:26:54.776 --> 02:27:06.721
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, I normally, you know, give the thumbs up to good German engineering, but these are cars that are meant to be driven at 100 miles an hour on the Autobahn, not 25 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone.

02:27:07.881 --> 02:27:09.242
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

02:27:09.642 --> 02:27:10.242
[SPEAKER_09]: Another F.U.

02:27:10.282 --> 02:27:18.606
[SPEAKER_09]: goes to me for drinking so much vodka last night and, you know, I will say whatever is on my mind while I am drunk.

02:27:20.132 --> 02:27:29.803
[SPEAKER_09]: and I got very blirty, so F you to my lack of restraint while I'm intoxicated.

02:27:30.844 --> 02:27:38.173
[SPEAKER_09]: Another F you goes toward this particular

02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:44.423
[SPEAKER_09]: Bit of software that I've acquired that requires a certain thing to make said software work.

02:27:45.364 --> 02:27:46.264
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I can't use it.

02:27:46.725 --> 02:27:54.429
[SPEAKER_09]: A big, humongous, whopping F you goes to freaking PaintShop Pro 8 for not letting me change the size of my brush.

02:27:55.089 --> 02:28:06.396
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I want to go and do little fine detailed work and go edit out backgrounds and stuff so that I can have transparencies and a stupid brush will not let me change the damn size of it.

02:28:06.716 --> 02:28:06.916
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's

02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:09.371
[SPEAKER_09]: Photoshop is ass, okay?

02:28:09.471 --> 02:28:12.553
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not like Photoshop, even though I'm going to have to take a class in it.

02:28:12.933 --> 02:28:19.176
[SPEAKER_09]: But that means that I'm going to have to go back to using PaintShop Pro 7, except PaintShop Pro 8 has some really good filters in it.

02:28:21.037 --> 02:28:32.683
[SPEAKER_09]: And also FU to the potential class I have to take in Photoshop, even though I don't care for Photoshop all that much, except it does have also really nice filters, and I like the way it does layers better.

02:28:33.784 --> 02:28:35.105
[SPEAKER_09]: And FU goes toward...

02:28:37.664 --> 02:29:05.113
[SPEAKER_09]: another thing about PaintShot Pro 8 for not letting me freaking rotate my text in a curve the way I want to it's doing some weird vector thing that's really pissing me off so that means that I have to do 10 sideshow posters for Halloween by hand I have to ink them and then color them on the computer at least I can do some neat stuff to it and make it look cool once I have drawn it and scanned it

02:29:05.609 --> 02:29:07.930
[SPEAKER_09]: And at least I don't have to do some heavy shading on it either.

02:29:07.970 --> 02:29:09.110
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all primary colors.

02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:11.291
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just my hand's going to be falling off.

02:29:11.351 --> 02:29:14.131
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have other drawings I really, really want to work on too.

02:29:15.452 --> 02:29:21.773
[SPEAKER_09]: So as it stands, I'm just going to have to, I guess, find some time.

02:29:21.953 --> 02:29:24.094
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I've done all the homework for one of my classes.

02:29:25.194 --> 02:29:36.081
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, and another F you toward not having my Copic markers anymore, because I finally, three of my Copic markers dried out, and that means I have to go pay another 20 bucks to get another set.

02:29:37.102 --> 02:29:42.766
[SPEAKER_09]: So... And also, just an F you to the color Copics for being so damn expensive anyway.

02:29:43.606 --> 02:29:48.670
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, true, you're paying for quality and alcohol-based ink, but... Ugh, so expensive.

02:29:49.570 --> 02:29:52.812
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm retracting an F you this week to Dell.

02:29:53.413 --> 02:29:54.934
[SPEAKER_18]: Whoa, is that a first?

02:29:55.805 --> 02:29:56.625
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I could go on before.

02:29:56.645 --> 02:29:57.665
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish I could go on before.

02:30:25.851 --> 02:30:27.052
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will make me a happy bunny.

02:30:29.593 --> 02:30:30.553
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy happy bunny.

02:30:31.074 --> 02:30:32.234
[SPEAKER_09]: And one final FU.

02:30:32.695 --> 02:30:34.035
[SPEAKER_09]: To my happy bunny t-shirt.

02:30:35.156 --> 02:30:37.917
[SPEAKER_09]: And my happy bunny t-shirt had pink fuzzy fur on him.

02:30:38.397 --> 02:30:40.839
[SPEAKER_09]: And now he looks like he's got a goatee over his belly.

02:30:41.539 --> 02:30:44.981
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because it's like the bottom of his mouth is like by his belly.

02:30:45.521 --> 02:30:48.823
[SPEAKER_09]: So he looks like he's just got bad chest hair.

02:30:49.583 --> 02:30:51.624
[SPEAKER_09]: And like the rest of them is rub all raw.

02:30:52.865 --> 02:30:54.806
[SPEAKER_09]: Another FU goes to Rob's cell phone.

02:30:55.914 --> 02:30:58.015
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be on silent while we're on the show.

02:30:59.115 --> 02:31:00.476
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

02:31:00.516 --> 02:31:01.716
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:31:02.357 --> 02:31:02.937
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

02:31:03.317 --> 02:31:03.897
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm spent.

02:31:05.178 --> 02:31:08.499
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's move on to Loki and see what he's pissed off about this time.

02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:18.063
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, first off, I'm going to be pissed off at my toe because I just squeezed it really hard in this big, pussy, clump thing.

02:31:19.243 --> 02:31:24.425
[SPEAKER_16]: I was, but I need to let it dry out because before, you know, with a band-aid, it just stays wet.

02:31:24.878 --> 02:31:25.498
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have any gauze.

02:31:25.818 --> 02:31:32.721
[SPEAKER_16]: So anyway, so, um, yeah, I squeezed this big clump of whatever out, because it looked like it was pussying a little bit, so I was like seeing how bad it was.

02:31:33.302 --> 02:31:38.784
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, but it wasn't that, it was like some of the gauze that was left over from the other thing I hadn't pulled out.

02:31:38.944 --> 02:31:40.565
[SPEAKER_16]: It was in the hole where they...

02:31:41.573 --> 02:31:43.934
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:32:11.249 --> 02:32:13.230
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you to Denios for sucking.

02:32:13.450 --> 02:32:17.593
[SPEAKER_16]: I never realized how many cell phone case booths there could be in one place.

02:32:18.273 --> 02:32:24.938
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I didn't really need a cell phone case or a new faceplate because there's tons of those faceplate booths.

02:32:25.298 --> 02:32:28.600
[SPEAKER_16]: Nor did I need any used underwear or samurai swords.

02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:34.664
[SPEAKER_16]: I swear to God, this place is like, we have power tools, we have bungee cords, and we have samurai swords.

02:32:35.944 --> 02:32:36.925
[SPEAKER_16]: Where the hell does that fit in?

02:32:37.915 --> 02:32:38.696
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just weird.

02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:41.558
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I bought some Korean pop CDs there.

02:32:43.319 --> 02:32:46.021
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's cool, but that was the only, like, cool thing that was there.

02:32:46.462 --> 02:32:47.182
[SPEAKER_09]: I walked around that.

02:32:47.402 --> 02:32:48.823
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, it's not the same anymore.

02:32:48.863 --> 02:32:51.605
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, we went at around 2 to 3 o'clock.

02:32:51.625 --> 02:32:56.489
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that is not very early, but it's not late in the day.

02:32:56.549 --> 02:33:00.252
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, and there was already half the people that already packed up and left.

02:33:00.973 --> 02:33:06.156
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, they were closing the fucking, you know, food vending booths down at 3, and they closed at 5.

02:33:07.819 --> 02:33:08.939
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck, two hours early?

02:33:08.979 --> 02:33:10.120
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a little ridiculous.

02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:12.040
[SPEAKER_16]: But whatever, so they were doing that.

02:33:12.841 --> 02:33:14.781
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was really lame and a waste of my time.

02:33:15.081 --> 02:33:19.523
[SPEAKER_16]: But, also, fuck you to Shark's Tale, because it was kind of lame.

02:33:20.203 --> 02:33:22.964
[SPEAKER_16]: But I went and saw it for free, so that wasn't that lame.

02:33:23.184 --> 02:33:26.245
[SPEAKER_16]: But it just still sucked, and it was a waste of my time.

02:33:29.046 --> 02:33:33.347
[SPEAKER_16]: And, finally, just, you know...

02:33:34.198 --> 02:33:34.838
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really know.

02:33:34.939 --> 02:33:39.081
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a lot more stuff earlier this week, and I just cannot remember it for the life of me now.

02:33:39.502 --> 02:33:42.103
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you to Goddamn Roundtable today.

02:33:42.644 --> 02:33:45.205
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, now, I bought a personal pizza and Twizz.

02:33:45.525 --> 02:33:46.726
[SPEAKER_16]: Their Twizz are fucking huge!

02:33:47.046 --> 02:33:49.128
[SPEAKER_16]: If I knew they were fucking huge, I would have just bought the Twizz.

02:33:49.628 --> 02:33:51.509
[SPEAKER_16]: But not only that, they didn't cook them all the way through.

02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:58.634
[SPEAKER_16]: They were damn good, so I ate them all, but I had to take a very bad shit when I got home.

02:33:59.775 --> 02:34:00.615
[SPEAKER_09]: That's beautiful.

02:34:01.156 --> 02:34:01.376
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

02:34:02.213 --> 02:34:27.132
[SPEAKER_16]: or at least it felt like it did, it wasn't, it was just, you know, it's just, you know, one of those things like, urgent, emergency, you know, that's not a feeling I want to have after, you know, eating at Roundtable, because I love Roundtable, and I was just, it was ironic because I was telling a story about how I used to make twists out of large pizza skins that were like a good, you know, three feet long when you're done with them, which is awesome, but, I don't know, they were still good though, but, um,

02:34:28.493 --> 02:34:29.774
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how it'll work, but I want something new.

02:34:29.794 --> 02:34:30.695
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to give an FU.

02:34:57.202 --> 02:35:23.472
[SPEAKER_18]: to that person I was already giving FUs to earlier who just made themselves look like an ass I want to give an FU to myself for having a little bit too much to drink last night and kind of forcing myself to stay in Chico until really late although actually I had a really good time so I have absolutely nothing to be bitching about but I need to learn to say no to drinking a lot better because I'm going to get myself in trouble sometimes what?

02:35:24.053 --> 02:35:25.233
[SPEAKER_10]: just say no I know

02:35:26.691 --> 02:35:38.699
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I want to give an FU to Unnecessary Drama and people that get off on perpetuating other people's drama.

02:35:39.119 --> 02:35:43.141
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I think I've had a pretty good week, all things considered, to be honest.

02:35:43.282 --> 02:35:46.284
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't have a whole bunch to give FUs to.

02:35:47.945 --> 02:35:51.007
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, FU to people that make fun of my name on Ultramix.

02:35:51.547 --> 02:35:55.610
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I freaking join games on Ultramix and people go, huh, it's Greenski.

02:35:56.872 --> 02:36:00.313
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, it's green sky, but since you don't know how to read, I'll forgive you.

02:36:01.673 --> 02:36:05.193
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's just like, you know... And then I go and kick your ass.

02:36:05.894 --> 02:36:10.054
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're like, you know, you just tell me I'm on a controller or something, even though I'm not.

02:36:10.454 --> 02:36:11.815
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually on a dance pad.

02:36:12.275 --> 02:36:16.896
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, um... Just in general, retards.

02:36:17.376 --> 02:36:19.216
[SPEAKER_18]: Not actual people who are actually retarded.

02:36:19.236 --> 02:36:22.537
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there's nothing they can do about it, but I mean people who act retarded and they have no reason to be.

02:36:23.717 --> 02:36:24.997
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it FU-related?

02:36:26.215 --> 02:36:28.217
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Loki has something F you related.

02:36:31.619 --> 02:36:33.761
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you to Bush because you look like an idiot during the debate.

02:36:33.961 --> 02:36:34.241
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

02:36:37.043 --> 02:36:37.483
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on.

02:36:39.044 --> 02:36:39.385
[SPEAKER_19]: Bradley.

02:36:42.227 --> 02:36:42.807
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

02:36:42.827 --> 02:36:55.116
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing I really have to say is fuck you to have to go another month being frugal because even with my pay raise I gotta pay off bills and stuff so I can't really do very much for the next month but I will.

02:36:55.816 --> 02:36:56.296
[SPEAKER_17]: That's about it.

02:36:57.517 --> 02:36:57.998
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that was quick.

02:36:59.098 --> 02:36:59.479
[SPEAKER_18]: Fair enough.

02:36:59.639 --> 02:37:03.201
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to the chatroom and see what our chatroom has to bitch about this time.

02:37:04.883 --> 02:37:08.565
[SPEAKER_18]: El Mullitz wants to say an F you to the chatroom for being so dead.

02:37:08.645 --> 02:37:09.386
[SPEAKER_18]: Not my fault.

02:37:10.146 --> 02:37:13.809
[SPEAKER_18]: An F you to idiots who claim you're a company fanboy for liking their games.

02:37:13.889 --> 02:37:17.392
[SPEAKER_18]: And on behalf of DarkSakura, an F you to Cosmo Magazine.

02:37:17.432 --> 02:37:18.032
[SPEAKER_18]: She knows why.

02:37:18.412 --> 02:37:20.474
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's... Oh my god, that's the one I forgot.

02:37:21.363 --> 02:37:24.185
[SPEAKER_09]: Beyond Paradise Beyond the Garbage Dump

02:37:47.884 --> 02:37:52.167
[SPEAKER_09]: Beyond Sequel Matter or something, I don't know.

02:37:53.508 --> 02:38:02.334
[SPEAKER_18]: OtakuRat says, F you to working 11 hours on 3 hours of sleep.

02:38:02.354 --> 02:38:04.956
[SPEAKER_18]: Jazz says, F you to elderly drivers.

02:38:05.757 --> 02:38:08.939
[SPEAKER_18]: For the love of God, stop driving 10 miles an hour under the speed limit.

02:38:09.452 --> 02:38:12.834
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, F you to the people who plaster their cars with political stickers.

02:38:12.874 --> 02:38:14.835
[SPEAKER_18]: Has anyone noticed these people suck ass at driving?

02:38:14.895 --> 02:38:19.518
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, buddy, I just put a political sticker on my car this week, so F you!

02:38:19.538 --> 02:38:20.359
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you put on there?

02:38:20.719 --> 02:38:21.639
[SPEAKER_18]: Carrie Edwards sticker.

02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:25.162
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm just gonna refrain from talking.

02:38:25.262 --> 02:38:27.523
[SPEAKER_18]: My mother put a Carrie Edwards sticker on my car, actually.

02:38:27.703 --> 02:38:28.904
[SPEAKER_18]: And she put it on crooked.

02:38:28.924 --> 02:38:30.885
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, neither of them are worthy of my vote.

02:38:30.925 --> 02:38:32.066
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm voting for Silver Cat again.

02:38:32.126 --> 02:38:38.049
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I don't want Bush to win, and I actually kind of like Carrie, especially after the debate, so we'll just leave it at that.

02:38:38.730 --> 02:38:38.830
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh...

02:38:39.771 --> 02:38:45.437
[SPEAKER_18]: Jazz says one more thing, F you to a certain in the groove step file creator for being such an elitist bastard.

02:38:45.477 --> 02:38:48.301
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, where did I hear that one earlier tonight?

02:38:48.561 --> 02:38:54.507
[SPEAKER_18]: Nith says, F you to all computer image editor programs for not having a way of making a decent spiral.

02:38:55.969 --> 02:38:56.349
[SPEAKER_18]: Fair enough.

02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:57.911
[SPEAKER_18]: Any ideas on that?

02:38:59.373 --> 02:38:59.653
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

02:39:00.385 --> 02:39:02.547
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't ever had to make a spiral, so.

02:39:03.307 --> 02:39:07.931
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, actually, yeah, you can do one in PaintShop Pro using the, uh, the twist.

02:39:08.531 --> 02:39:13.355
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you, uh, do a straight line from the center and then, uh, do the twist warp and that should work.

02:39:13.375 --> 02:39:15.837
[SPEAKER_09]: You can save it as a, as a paintbrush and paint.

02:39:16.717 --> 02:39:17.678
[SPEAKER_18]: Drawing tips from Jamie.

02:39:18.579 --> 02:39:19.960
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:24.964
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, VXJasonXV says, F you to a lack of sleep and making me sleep through almost all the show.

02:39:25.364 --> 02:39:27.225
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I woke up to my girlfriend's voice, though.

02:39:27.245 --> 02:39:27.766
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

02:39:27.806 --> 02:39:27.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

02:39:29.642 --> 02:39:34.445
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to the people who randomly bash other people they don't even know and probably do it only because they don't like me.

02:39:34.746 --> 02:39:35.426
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know what?

02:39:35.626 --> 02:39:38.588
[SPEAKER_18]: I can prevent his ability to connect to that IRC network.

02:39:38.668 --> 02:39:39.469
[SPEAKER_18]: Insert evil laugh here.

02:39:39.769 --> 02:39:42.231
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm laughing too because I know exactly what he's talking about.

02:39:42.411 --> 02:39:47.114
[SPEAKER_18]: And when this person gets banned from anywhere, it's good news.

02:39:47.194 --> 02:39:48.555
[SPEAKER_18]: I just told Jamie what it was.

02:39:48.595 --> 02:39:50.357
[SPEAKER_18]: I was doing sign language to Jamie.

02:39:53.101 --> 02:39:55.122
[SPEAKER_09]: I have choice words that I'm not going to say.

02:39:55.382 --> 02:39:55.722
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:39:55.762 --> 02:39:56.422
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've said them.

02:39:56.442 --> 02:39:58.143
[SPEAKER_18]: She'll say them on commercial break, I'm sure.

02:39:58.203 --> 02:39:59.703
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's been my time.

02:40:01.464 --> 02:40:03.465
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, oh yeah, he says.

02:40:04.365 --> 02:40:09.767
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, to expand on my first one, F you to sleep, making you not do anything.

02:40:09.827 --> 02:40:10.608
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to go shopping.

02:40:11.788 --> 02:40:17.470
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't know how many times I've needed to go shopping, and then I'm like, mm, sleep.

02:40:18.030 --> 02:40:19.891
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't end up shopping, and then I wonder why I'm hungry.

02:40:21.533 --> 02:40:25.621
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Angel says F you to fellow students in a class that Magus and I are taking.

02:40:25.682 --> 02:40:27.004
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost called him Magus.

02:40:29.589 --> 02:40:32.014
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a total Tom Brokaw moment, I swear.

02:40:33.243 --> 02:40:35.505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but Rob, there's a difference.

02:40:36.165 --> 02:40:38.727
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Brokaw gets paid, you know, a few million a year.

02:40:40.088 --> 02:40:42.490
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't get paid for the show.

02:40:42.691 --> 02:40:43.031
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

02:40:44.632 --> 02:40:49.656
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to fellow students in the class that... I mean, I've been horribly bad on my speech tonight.

02:40:49.796 --> 02:40:51.317
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how many things I've said.

02:40:51.377 --> 02:40:57.903
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, where my mind was just in three different places and I ran them all together and just said things I didn't mean to say.

02:40:57.923 --> 02:40:58.883
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God.

02:40:58.903 --> 02:41:00.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigh.

02:41:02.148 --> 02:41:05.831
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel says, F you to fellow students in the class that Magus and I are taking.

02:41:06.151 --> 02:41:07.132
[SPEAKER_18]: You asked for our help.

02:41:07.212 --> 02:41:07.952
[SPEAKER_18]: We gave it to you.

02:41:08.012 --> 02:41:09.453
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not our fault you didn't get it.

02:41:09.974 --> 02:41:11.174
[SPEAKER_18]: We never said you were stupid.

02:41:11.234 --> 02:41:17.039
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't put words in our mouths to make us look bad when we are trying to be diligent students, just like the rest of the class.

02:41:17.179 --> 02:41:17.639
[SPEAKER_18]: Grr.

02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:19.160
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I feel better.

02:41:23.803 --> 02:41:26.825
[SPEAKER_18]: For a pretty dead chat room, that was a very ranty evening of FUs.

02:41:26.946 --> 02:41:29.167
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of am surprised.

02:41:30.388 --> 02:41:31.509
[SPEAKER_09]: They're restoring it, Rob.

02:41:31.529 --> 02:41:31.749
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

02:41:33.115 --> 02:41:41.841
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from break, since we've got a few minutes left in the show, and that's how we always buy ourselves some time, is we do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:41:42.501 --> 02:41:42.721
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

02:41:45.683 --> 02:41:47.164
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we did Elmullet's like first.

02:41:47.525 --> 02:41:48.785
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that was CDR Angel who was last.

02:41:49.926 --> 02:41:50.246
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

02:41:50.547 --> 02:41:50.867
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:41:51.647 --> 02:41:52.408
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go to a break.

02:41:53.260 --> 02:41:56.827
[SPEAKER_18]: In this break, 2DX music, because I want to hear Love is Dreaminess.

02:41:57.148 --> 02:41:57.829
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll be back.

02:41:57.910 --> 02:42:00.034
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, we'll just make an LED break.

02:42:00.355 --> 02:42:00.635
[SPEAKER_18]: Hell with it.

02:42:00.655 --> 02:42:01.537
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do LED music.

02:42:01.557 --> 02:42:03.341
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back after this LED break.

02:42:03.681 --> 02:42:03.902
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

02:42:17.742 --> 02:42:19.203
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:44:20.729 --> 02:44:23.770
You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience.

02:44:23.831 --> 02:44:24.831
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the whole Earth.

02:44:25.031 --> 02:44:26.012
Yes, the whole Earth.

02:45:18.035 --> 02:45:21.096
[SPEAKER_04]: You are already dead!

02:47:31.215 --> 02:47:35.376
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:47:35.596 --> 02:47:37.317
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:47:37.377 --> 02:47:37.737
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

02:47:40.117 --> 02:47:41.518
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we care what people think of us?

02:47:43.858 --> 02:47:43.958
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

02:47:43.998 --> 02:47:45.439
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:47:45.899 --> 02:47:48.819
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.880
[SPEAKER_22]: Extreme Babani Radio.

02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:54.761
[SPEAKER_22]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:55.296 --> 02:47:56.597
[SPEAKER_18]: Xtreme Radio I have a question, Rob.

02:48:24.238 --> 02:48:25.919
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, should I start the music first?

02:48:26.159 --> 02:48:26.860
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, start the music.

02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:27.220
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:48:34.004 --> 02:48:36.965
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:48:37.446 --> 02:48:40.707
[SPEAKER_19]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:48:41.168 --> 02:48:44.270
[SPEAKER_19]: That is if we even get any questions anyway.

02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:47.952
[SPEAKER_19]: Because even though people are listening, we already put them to sleep.

02:48:50.782 --> 02:48:53.723
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear Orange Lounge... Yes, DarkSakura, your question.

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:55.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we so cool?

02:48:57.705 --> 02:48:59.926
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, because I'm here.

02:49:00.466 --> 02:49:01.687
[SPEAKER_09]: The air conditioner's cranked up.

02:49:02.948 --> 02:49:04.548
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get to our first listener question.

02:49:05.889 --> 02:49:13.152
[SPEAKER_18]: Jason, MrVXJasonXV himself says, Does anyone remember seeing Katamari Damase... Damse?

02:49:13.652 --> 02:49:14.153
[SPEAKER_19]: Damase?

02:49:14.233 --> 02:49:14.633
[SPEAKER_19]: Damase!

02:49:15.455 --> 02:49:17.096
[SPEAKER_18]: Katamari Damacy at E3.

02:49:17.216 --> 02:49:18.976
[SPEAKER_18]: I've read reports about it, but I didn't see it.

02:49:19.536 --> 02:49:23.197
[SPEAKER_18]: I just beat the game yesterday, and it's one of the greatest I've ever played.

02:49:23.698 --> 02:49:24.718
[SPEAKER_18]: Has anyone else played it?

02:49:25.318 --> 02:49:26.859
[SPEAKER_18]: I have never heard of this game in my entire life.

02:49:26.879 --> 02:49:27.659
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of this game.

02:49:28.139 --> 02:49:28.339
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

02:49:28.819 --> 02:49:29.699
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of that game.

02:49:32.340 --> 02:49:33.041
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki has a question.

02:49:34.141 --> 02:49:39.002
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that the one where you, like, roll over shit, where you have this giant ball of crap that you roll over shit with?

02:49:39.142 --> 02:49:39.923
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that is it.

02:49:40.123 --> 02:49:43.364
[SPEAKER_16]: Where they spoofed it in, um, a penny arcade?

02:49:43.844 --> 02:49:43.924
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh...

02:49:45.009 --> 02:49:47.610
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to play it because it looks funny.

02:49:48.450 --> 02:49:49.611
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that is the game.

02:49:50.471 --> 02:49:51.692
[SPEAKER_16]: The giant ball of shit game.

02:49:52.052 --> 02:49:53.633
[SPEAKER_09]: The giant ball of shit game.

02:49:55.053 --> 02:49:55.573
[SPEAKER_16]: Looks fun.

02:49:56.814 --> 02:49:59.635
[SPEAKER_18]: I will post a link to the official website here.

02:50:00.516 --> 02:50:02.316
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember this game at all.

02:50:02.376 --> 02:50:03.897
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it a Japanese game?

02:50:04.077 --> 02:50:05.338
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh no, it looks like an English game.

02:50:05.758 --> 02:50:08.299
[SPEAKER_17]: It was released for like 15 bucks at Fry's.

02:50:08.739 --> 02:50:09.059
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

02:50:09.519 --> 02:50:10.420
[SPEAKER_17]: And then sold out.

02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:12.080
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really cool and everything.

02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:13.501
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never played it though.

02:50:14.987 --> 02:50:16.588
[SPEAKER_19]: How have I never heard of this game?

02:50:18.008 --> 02:50:18.328
[SPEAKER_18]: Weird.

02:50:20.489 --> 02:50:21.610
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's Namco.

02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.590
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it is.

02:50:23.130 --> 02:50:24.651
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, anything by Namco is good.

02:50:25.131 --> 02:50:25.731
[SPEAKER_18]: That's weird.

02:50:25.891 --> 02:50:29.533
[SPEAKER_18]: Namco back in the day... Why have I never... I guess I'm just out of it.

02:50:29.613 --> 02:50:31.613
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not cool anymore is basically what it boils down to.

02:50:31.633 --> 02:50:32.033
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.

02:50:32.093 --> 02:50:33.114
[SPEAKER_18]: A giant ball of shit.

02:50:33.154 --> 02:50:33.554
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that.

02:50:35.015 --> 02:50:35.255
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

02:50:35.335 --> 02:50:37.476
[SPEAKER_09]: I would kill for a giant ball of shit.

02:50:38.436 --> 02:50:39.576
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to more questions.

02:50:39.656 --> 02:50:42.117
[SPEAKER_17]: Not shit, but stuff.

02:50:42.657 --> 02:50:43.118
[SPEAKER_18]: Stuff, yeah.

02:50:43.158 --> 02:50:44.098
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a giant ball of stuff.

02:50:44.841 --> 02:50:47.622
[SPEAKER_17]: You wouldn't really want a ball of shit rolling over you.

02:50:47.642 --> 02:50:48.783
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it would kind of suck.

02:50:49.784 --> 02:50:50.704
[SPEAKER_17]: Get everything messy.

02:50:51.084 --> 02:50:52.505
[SPEAKER_18]: They're calling it a sleeper hit.

02:50:52.985 --> 02:50:54.326
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a budget sleeper hit.

02:50:54.906 --> 02:50:56.707
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, kind of like what Incredible Crisis was.

02:50:58.288 --> 02:51:06.112
[SPEAKER_18]: Brack2000 has a question, and I don't know if I want to ask his question, to be honest, but I guess I will, because I do that.

02:51:06.512 --> 02:51:08.513
[SPEAKER_18]: Brack2000 wants to know, where's the ferret at?

02:51:09.274 --> 02:51:09.834
[SPEAKER_18]: It's on the floor.

02:51:11.495 --> 02:51:12.036
[SPEAKER_17]: Where should it be?

02:51:12.056 --> 02:51:13.457
[SPEAKER_17]: It needs to stay there.

02:51:13.737 --> 02:51:15.218
[SPEAKER_17]: In the fireplace where he belongs.

02:51:15.758 --> 02:51:17.260
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have a fireplace, Rob.

02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:19.161
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a fireplace in my place.

02:51:20.302 --> 02:51:21.623
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to the retarded love.

02:51:22.643 --> 02:51:24.565
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel has a question to all the hosts.

02:51:24.905 --> 02:51:26.186
[SPEAKER_18]: Want me to make new promos?

02:51:26.807 --> 02:51:27.867
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, we'll take donations.

02:51:28.928 --> 02:51:29.529
[SPEAKER_18]: What are we going to say?

02:51:29.909 --> 02:51:31.570
[SPEAKER_18]: No, don't give us free stuff.

02:51:31.870 --> 02:51:33.131
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't do work for us.

02:51:33.672 --> 02:51:34.412
[SPEAKER_18]: Please don't.

02:51:34.652 --> 02:51:37.094
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course we want people to make fun of us.

02:51:37.174 --> 02:51:37.534
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie.

02:51:38.135 --> 02:51:38.655
[SPEAKER_18]: Question for Jamie.

02:51:38.675 --> 02:51:39.436
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut that damn thing up.

02:51:39.456 --> 02:51:39.596
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:51:40.362 --> 02:51:45.185
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you think the best way to get my stamina up for DDR besides playing DDR itself?

02:51:45.245 --> 02:51:45.845
[SPEAKER_18]: I want options.

02:51:46.606 --> 02:51:47.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this Angel?

02:51:47.786 --> 02:51:48.887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:51:49.107 --> 02:51:49.567
[SPEAKER_09]: Start walking.

02:51:50.948 --> 02:51:51.589
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, walking.

02:51:51.869 --> 02:51:52.369
[SPEAKER_09]: Start walking.

02:51:53.214 --> 02:51:55.395
[SPEAKER_09]: Do things that get your heart going.

02:51:56.336 --> 02:51:58.397
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole thing is that DDR is cardio.

02:51:59.418 --> 02:52:09.083
[SPEAKER_09]: And no matter how good you get your legs in shape, if you're breathing, if your lungs can't keep up with it, you should go to spin with me, Angel.

02:52:09.203 --> 02:52:11.104
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a membership at my gym and go to spin with me.

02:52:11.284 --> 02:52:13.465
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll get your cardio built up.

02:52:13.665 --> 02:52:15.527
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still debating getting a membership at that gym, too.

02:52:15.587 --> 02:52:16.747
[SPEAKER_09]: I guarantee you.

02:52:17.648 --> 02:52:17.768
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

02:52:18.453 --> 02:52:19.394
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to be buff.

02:52:41.906 --> 02:52:44.247
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is no way in hell I can run two miles, okay?

02:52:44.448 --> 02:52:46.228
[SPEAKER_09]: I can barely run a quarter of the track.

02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:51.171
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're working on getting in shape to do the mud run next year.

02:52:51.752 --> 02:52:54.753
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to come work out with us, you're welcome to do it.

02:52:54.973 --> 02:53:05.759
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would help build up your stamina because we're doing run walks on the track and running the stairs and doing sit-ups and push-ups and all kinds of stuff.

02:53:07.260 --> 02:53:08.421
[SPEAKER_18]: You're starting a fitness club.

02:53:08.914 --> 02:53:09.514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, kind of.

02:53:09.534 --> 02:53:14.235
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about doing something like Orange Lounge Fitness.

02:53:14.595 --> 02:53:15.736
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cute.

02:53:16.376 --> 02:53:17.836
[SPEAKER_18]: Meanwhile, I'm on the DDR diet.

02:53:20.657 --> 02:53:23.157
[SPEAKER_16]: Rule number one of Run Club.

02:53:23.277 --> 02:53:25.178
[SPEAKER_16]: No one talks about Run Club!

02:53:26.418 --> 02:53:26.658
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

02:53:28.639 --> 02:53:29.919
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on with Angel's question.

02:53:29.959 --> 02:53:31.379
[SPEAKER_18]: There's also a question for Loki here.

02:53:31.539 --> 02:53:32.820
[SPEAKER_18]: Is your new remix done?

02:53:33.120 --> 02:53:34.360
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't even know he was working on a new remix.

02:53:35.359 --> 02:53:38.721
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well, okay, what's the status of Loki remixes?

02:53:38.741 --> 02:53:39.561
[SPEAKER_18]: Is anything on the plate?

02:53:40.061 --> 02:53:41.182
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll reword her question.

02:53:41.202 --> 02:53:43.303
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought that was a plan.

02:53:44.344 --> 02:53:45.544
[SPEAKER_16]: There was stuff being done.

02:53:46.265 --> 02:53:47.145
[SPEAKER_16]: This is news to me.

02:53:47.545 --> 02:53:53.168
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe she was asking, like I was thinking, have we renamed your last remix yet?

02:53:53.428 --> 02:53:55.089
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, I went with my name.

02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.470
[SPEAKER_17]: Which was?

02:53:57.971 --> 02:53:58.831
[SPEAKER_16]: What did I name that?

02:54:00.745 --> 02:54:06.471
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was Radical Faith, The Final Judgment Mix or something like that.

02:54:07.492 --> 02:54:08.693
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think that's what I called it.

02:54:08.713 --> 02:54:10.515
[SPEAKER_15]: There you have it.

02:54:11.816 --> 02:54:16.560
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, am I allowed to use the controller when playing Ultra Mix against you because my converter is being buggy?

02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:18.162
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's fine.

02:54:18.182 --> 02:54:19.363
[SPEAKER_18]: You can play controller against me.

02:54:19.463 --> 02:54:20.744
[SPEAKER_18]: But, here's the thing.

02:54:21.104 --> 02:54:29.872
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't fucking go picking like Can't Stop Falling In Love, Speed Mix, followed by Paranoia Rebirth, and then Eternal, and then fucking like every 9-footer in the game back-to-back.

02:54:30.333 --> 02:54:31.754
[SPEAKER_18]: Because remember, I'm on a dance pad.

02:54:31.774 --> 02:54:32.855
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to be playing fucking...

02:54:34.011 --> 02:54:36.012
[SPEAKER_18]: Santa Milete Light No, I'm kidding.

02:54:36.052 --> 02:54:37.793
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, just within reason.

02:54:37.833 --> 02:54:39.614
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as the songs are within reason, I don't really care.

02:54:39.634 --> 02:54:41.035
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as we're just playing to have fun.

02:54:41.055 --> 02:54:45.137
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm playing against somebody for fun, then yeah, we can, you know, use whatever you want.

02:54:45.177 --> 02:54:46.318
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I'll play on the controller.

02:54:46.338 --> 02:54:50.420
[SPEAKER_18]: We should just keep playing against each other on the controller like a bunch and then rack up a bunch of points.

02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:51.200
[SPEAKER_18]: That would actually be fun.

02:54:52.821 --> 02:54:54.822
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually have an idea how we're going to get ourselves in the top 100.

02:54:54.922 --> 02:54:57.884
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh... Ah, damn.

02:54:58.684 --> 02:54:59.545
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't want to cheat.

02:54:59.645 --> 02:55:01.046
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I want to do it honestly.

02:55:01.246 --> 02:55:02.226
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do it honestly.

02:55:02.627 --> 02:55:03.287
[SPEAKER_18]: Hehehehe.

02:55:04.180 --> 02:55:12.022
[SPEAKER_18]: El Mullet says, if any of you had to pick an old school video game character as your favorite of all time, who would you pick?

02:55:12.942 --> 02:55:13.423
[SPEAKER_08]: For what?

02:55:14.063 --> 02:55:16.043
[SPEAKER_18]: Your favorite old game... Oh, I'm sorry.

02:55:16.063 --> 02:55:21.205
[SPEAKER_18]: If you had to pick an old school video game character as your favorite of all time.

02:55:23.005 --> 02:55:24.306
[SPEAKER_09]: The chick from The Guardian Legend.

02:55:25.886 --> 02:55:29.407
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Richter Belmont from Dracula X. Hmm.

02:55:30.376 --> 02:55:38.580
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because he walks around with his Ryu haircut and his headband with a whip being all badass vampire hunter, that's kind of cool.

02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:41.861
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of hot.

02:55:43.302 --> 02:55:48.325
[SPEAKER_18]: I would have to say either the Dark Queen from Battletoads or Chun-Li.

02:55:50.345 --> 02:55:51.526
[SPEAKER_18]: Super Joe.

02:55:53.427 --> 02:55:54.147
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Joe?

02:55:54.928 --> 02:55:55.608
[SPEAKER_16]: By On Commando.

02:55:56.138 --> 02:55:57.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that's cool.

02:55:57.658 --> 02:56:00.299
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you blow up Hitler at the end of that game, only it's not Hitler.

02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:09.281
[SPEAKER_18]: Or, um, like, a random Mega Man 2 boss, because the Mega Man bosses are cool.

02:56:09.301 --> 02:56:11.922
[SPEAKER_09]: You would so be, uh, Quickman.

02:56:12.942 --> 02:56:14.382
[SPEAKER_18]: There is no Rainbow Man.

02:56:14.442 --> 02:56:14.963
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to hell.

02:56:17.703 --> 02:56:18.963
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, uh, Misty.

02:56:18.983 --> 02:56:21.384
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know what the hell happened to episode 111.

02:56:21.964 --> 02:56:23.044
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you delete it or something?

02:56:23.064 --> 02:56:25.085
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been looking forward to hearing it on Rewind Pal-

02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:28.831
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's 1.12 that never got recorded.

02:56:28.871 --> 02:56:42.337
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, 1.12 is gone, but there was a small mistake that happened this week where something got updated and didn't get saved, which caused you to hear the same episode for the third week in a row, and I apologize for that.

02:56:43.717 --> 02:56:44.618
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know what?

02:56:45.158 --> 02:56:46.778
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a suggestion for you in the chatroom.

02:56:46.899 --> 02:56:47.279
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

02:56:47.399 --> 02:56:48.039
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn.

02:56:48.159 --> 02:56:49.380
[SPEAKER_09]: Ride2000 said you should be Hardman.

02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:50.620
[SPEAKER_09]: Every day.

02:56:58.741 --> 02:57:00.562
[SPEAKER_18]: No, episode 111 exists.

02:57:00.622 --> 02:57:04.485
[SPEAKER_18]: And in fact, to prove it, I will play a random moment from episode 111.

02:57:05.026 --> 02:57:06.487
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's a random moment from episode 111.

02:57:07.748 --> 02:57:08.729
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bash Bin Laden.

02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:11.911
[SPEAKER_00]: Goddamn Bush family, forgive Bin Laden.

02:57:12.311 --> 02:57:14.493
[SPEAKER_00]: President Bush should be killed and his entire family.

02:57:14.513 --> 02:57:16.194
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't for them, Osama wouldn't live.

02:57:16.775 --> 02:57:17.415
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, wonderful.

02:57:17.455 --> 02:57:18.316
[SPEAKER_18]: A Dark Child moment.

02:57:18.356 --> 02:57:19.037
[SPEAKER_18]: Just what I wanted.

02:57:20.438 --> 02:57:22.519
[SPEAKER_18]: That had nothing to do with video games at all.

02:57:22.780 --> 02:57:23.440
[SPEAKER_24]: Play another clip.

02:57:23.460 --> 02:57:25.402
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell's wrong with our show?

02:57:25.542 --> 02:57:25.822
What the hell?

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.403
[SPEAKER_16]: We need the random episode clip button.

02:57:29.603 --> 02:57:34.748
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like Conan has the random clips of Walker Texas Ranger.

02:57:35.089 --> 02:57:38.072
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to have... We need to do that.

02:57:38.753 --> 02:57:40.094
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that would be awesome.

02:57:40.114 --> 02:57:40.815
[SPEAKER_19]: Play another random.

02:57:40.915 --> 02:57:42.437
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going through old episodes.

02:57:42.617 --> 02:57:43.438
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, fine.

02:57:43.598 --> 02:57:45.200
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's another random clip of episode 111.

02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:46.781
[SPEAKER_18]: Of other stuff.

02:57:47.042 --> 02:57:47.903
[SPEAKER_18]: I was kind of surprised.

02:57:48.807 --> 02:57:54.271
[SPEAKER_18]: One vote over Echo Image and one vote, or I'm sorry, two votes over DM Assure.

02:57:54.291 --> 02:57:56.653
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a very, very close cage match tonight.

02:57:56.693 --> 02:57:57.774
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell was I talking about?

02:57:57.834 --> 02:57:59.275
[SPEAKER_18]: Tune in Thursday to find out.

02:57:59.535 --> 02:58:00.236
[SPEAKER_18]: Cage match!

02:58:00.796 --> 02:58:01.737
[SPEAKER_18]: And we know it's a cage match.

02:58:02.858 --> 02:58:03.158
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:58:04.699 --> 02:58:06.861
[SPEAKER_18]: So the episode exists, I just suck.

02:58:09.983 --> 02:58:10.363
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:58:11.824 --> 02:58:12.385
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um...

02:58:13.496 --> 02:58:13.896
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

02:58:13.936 --> 02:58:14.977
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all the questions we got.

02:58:14.997 --> 02:58:16.838
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's fine because it's time to wrap up the show.

02:58:16.878 --> 02:58:19.640
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to close the old Orange Lounge Radio mailbag.

02:58:24.763 --> 02:58:25.764
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was us closing the bag.

02:58:26.184 --> 02:58:27.165
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, did we ever check the email?

02:58:27.205 --> 02:58:28.606
[SPEAKER_18]: The old school Yahoo email?

02:58:29.626 --> 02:58:31.848
[SPEAKER_18]: I check it once in a great while.

02:58:33.469 --> 02:58:34.449
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll open it up right now.

02:58:40.478 --> 02:58:42.178
[SPEAKER_09]: Like an F you for something Loki said.

02:58:42.818 --> 02:58:43.979
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see what messages we got.

02:58:44.019 --> 02:58:47.699
[SPEAKER_18]: We said, good news, weight loss, 14% reduction of fat.

02:58:48.119 --> 02:58:49.320
[SPEAKER_24]: Have bigger cock.

02:58:49.820 --> 02:58:51.740
[SPEAKER_18]: Something makes me cry when I am moved.

02:58:53.820 --> 02:58:56.041
[SPEAKER_18]: And another one that says, happy face.

02:58:56.121 --> 02:58:58.441
[SPEAKER_18]: My sister used to tell me life is full of happiness.

02:59:00.542 --> 02:59:01.782
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing in the goddamn email.

02:59:02.762 --> 02:59:04.823
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't even get a penis enlargement, Neil?

02:59:05.043 --> 02:59:07.323
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know, something makes me cry when I am moved.

02:59:08.953 --> 02:59:09.913
[SPEAKER_18]: I was reading some webcomic, Rob.

02:59:09.933 --> 02:59:17.517
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember which one it was, the someone accepting spam mail because they hate the world and want more to come.

02:59:38.274 --> 02:59:39.215
[SPEAKER_09]: That was completely random.

02:59:41.438 --> 02:59:42.399
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go check my laundry.

02:59:42.759 --> 02:59:43.360
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, sounds good.

02:59:43.701 --> 02:59:44.702
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we're going to wrap up the show.

02:59:44.762 --> 02:59:45.583
[SPEAKER_18]: Come back, come back, come back.

02:59:46.063 --> 02:59:47.585
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you have to give us your final thought.

02:59:48.246 --> 02:59:48.486
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:59:50.329 --> 02:59:50.629
[SPEAKER_18]: Do it.

02:59:51.069 --> 02:59:51.470
[SPEAKER_18]: Final thought.

02:59:52.637 --> 02:59:54.418
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can't hear my thoughts.

02:59:54.599 --> 02:59:58.862
[SPEAKER_09]: None of you are... None of you are psycho and have ESPN.

02:59:58.962 --> 03:00:01.804
[SPEAKER_18]: Then just tell them to tune in Tuesday since we didn't do the plug.

03:00:01.844 --> 03:00:03.405
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do a radio show on Tuesday.

03:00:04.506 --> 03:00:06.287
[SPEAKER_09]: And listen on... I never knew that.

03:00:06.688 --> 03:00:08.129
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob... Rob... What?

03:00:08.229 --> 03:00:08.689
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob... What?

03:00:08.929 --> 03:00:10.190
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob... What?

03:00:10.791 --> 03:00:12.192
[SPEAKER_09]: Twice in one show, damn.

03:00:13.052 --> 03:00:13.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob...

03:00:15.365 --> 03:00:18.808
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I do pump up the volume on Tuesday night.

03:00:19.008 --> 03:00:26.454
[SPEAKER_09]: If you tune in at 7 o'clock, sometimes a little bit earlier, you can listen to the pre-show.

03:00:26.474 --> 03:00:28.035
[SPEAKER_09]: 7.30 starts the real show.

03:00:28.876 --> 03:00:32.259
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be a request show, but that hasn't really happened all that much anymore.

03:00:32.339 --> 03:00:33.920
[SPEAKER_09]: People, you know, sometimes make requests.

03:00:34.340 --> 03:00:38.043
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said I'd choose to marathon things, and the marathon for this week will be Rammstein.

03:00:38.944 --> 03:00:43.928
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm probably going to throw in, like, old video game music, because I feel like it.

03:00:45.583 --> 03:00:46.444
[SPEAKER_09]: So, tune in.

03:00:46.884 --> 03:00:49.626
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if I get bored again like I did last week, I'll go till midnight.

03:00:50.146 --> 03:00:54.128
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I played Eddie Izzard and a bunch of other stuff afterwards.

03:00:55.049 --> 03:00:59.152
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, no, last week actually was the 80s marathon, which I actually do those every couple of months.

03:01:00.532 --> 03:01:03.494
[SPEAKER_09]: So, be thinking of what you want to listen to, though.

03:01:03.774 --> 03:01:04.415
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play whatever.

03:01:05.836 --> 03:01:14.001
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are part of our LiveJournal community, Orange Lounge LiveJournal, you can also put in there things that you'd like to hear on the show.

03:01:23.266 --> 03:01:27.050
[SPEAKER_16]: I was thinking of weird things to make remixes of earlier today.

03:01:27.451 --> 03:01:33.958
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things I downloaded, which I gotta mess around with because I think it'd be funny, is to make a dance remix to the Shaft theme.

03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:36.601
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that would work.

03:01:36.954 --> 03:01:37.474
[SPEAKER_16]: I got you a record.

03:01:37.514 --> 03:01:38.755
[SPEAKER_16]: I got you, what was that group?

03:01:38.775 --> 03:01:39.035
[SPEAKER_16]: Guitar... Wolf.

03:01:39.095 --> 03:01:39.535
[SPEAKER_16]: Guitar Wolf.

03:02:03.724 --> 03:02:04.786
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a bunch of records.

03:02:05.006 --> 03:02:14.977
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to go through my big pile of mid-90s R&B and I need to figure out what I want to keep and what I want to get rid of because I'm trying to take that big pile I have that's just sitting there.

03:02:16.214 --> 03:02:24.477
[SPEAKER_16]: I have one record now, one left.

03:02:24.757 --> 03:02:30.598
[SPEAKER_09]: All my other ones are in Alabama, but Dan and I actually bought Weird Al's Even Worse on vinyl.

03:02:30.898 --> 03:02:36.140
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I need to like just, because there's a lot of records out there, I need to figure out how to mix on vinyl.

03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:39.541
[SPEAKER_16]: And once I do that, then I'll be probably more opted to...

03:02:40.001 --> 03:02:42.264
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll make you a database I just need to know how to learn how to mix

03:02:57.677 --> 03:02:58.578
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty much what I need to do.

03:02:58.878 --> 03:03:01.379
[SPEAKER_16]: I can do parties, you know, where you just crossfade shit over.

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:02.460
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a piece of cake.

03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:08.544
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's a matter of, like, you know, being an actual true DJ and being able to beatmatch and stuff and mix that way.

03:03:08.564 --> 03:03:14.308
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a little different than being a wedding DJ where you just play 80s shit and crossfade over.

03:03:14.328 --> 03:03:17.250
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, this is the sequel to The Wedding Singer's The Wedding DJ.

03:03:19.191 --> 03:03:23.734
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, seriously, I could DJ, like, really shitty, like, adult parties and stuff, you know?

03:03:24.275 --> 03:03:24.735
[SPEAKER_16]: But, like,

03:03:25.567 --> 03:03:31.893
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't really actually be able to do cool professional DJ stuff and mix shit together.

03:03:33.554 --> 03:03:35.155
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now I have a program that helps me with that.

03:03:35.576 --> 03:03:40.280
[SPEAKER_16]: I can do it visually, but I can't do it audio.

03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:42.541
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a problem.

03:03:44.203 --> 03:03:44.903
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my final thought.

03:03:46.965 --> 03:03:47.926
[SPEAKER_18]: Bradley, you have a final thought?

03:03:49.547 --> 03:03:53.811
[SPEAKER_17]: Since I don't have very much to say, I'll just read random words from the posters on the wall.

03:03:54.898 --> 03:03:56.920
[SPEAKER_17]: Redundant, nicer, yummy, pin-up action.

03:03:58.060 --> 03:03:58.521
[SPEAKER_18]: Very nice.

03:03:59.261 --> 03:04:03.404
[SPEAKER_18]: And my final thought is, I'm trying to keep this short because I have somewhere else to be right now.

03:04:03.444 --> 03:04:05.646
[SPEAKER_18]: So, thank you very much for listening, everybody.

03:04:05.666 --> 03:04:06.246
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a great night.

03:04:06.307 --> 03:04:07.107
[SPEAKER_18]: Final word of the show.

03:04:07.147 --> 03:04:08.468
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, you always want it, so there you go.

03:04:10.189 --> 03:04:13.232
[SPEAKER_09]: My final word of the show is vodka.

03:04:14.352 --> 03:04:19.236
[SPEAKER_22]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:04:20.057 --> 03:04:24.200
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

03:04:24.827 --> 03:04:37.002

03:04:50.292 --> 03:04:54.717
[SPEAKER_06]: What's with these homies dissing my girl?

03:04:55.918 --> 03:04:58.901
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do they gotta front?

03:05:01.751 --> 03:05:10.058
[SPEAKER_06]: What did we ever do to these guys that made them so violent?

03:05:11.139 --> 03:05:18.345
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, but you know I'm yours Ooh, and I know you're mine And that's for a long time

03:05:30.876 --> 03:05:57.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you, I look just like Buddy Holly Oh, and you're married to the boy I don't care what they say about us anyway I don't care about that

03:06:13.817 --> 03:06:17.309
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:06:54.525 --> 03:06:56.607
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio, The Afterbirth, In Progress.

03:06:56.627 --> 03:07:01.432
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to queue up a post-show, so I'm going to give the mic to Loki and give him the responsibility of filling up a post-show.

03:07:03.274 --> 03:07:04.275
[SPEAKER_16]: Filling up a post-show?

03:07:04.775 --> 03:07:05.456
[SPEAKER_16]: God damn it.

03:07:08.259 --> 03:07:09.300
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, shit.

03:07:10.521 --> 03:07:17.028
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what I've been doing lately is I've been downloading some music, because, you know, I did buy stuff.

03:07:17.937 --> 03:07:18.877
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought music.

03:07:19.017 --> 03:07:26.680
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyways, this is one of the songs that I bought the other day, which is from BT.

03:07:26.740 --> 03:07:31.301
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're just going to kill time by playing a BT song because it'll be fun.

03:07:31.401 --> 03:07:32.602
[SPEAKER_16]: And everybody loves BT.

03:07:32.642 --> 03:07:33.442
[SPEAKER_16]: BT rocks.

03:07:33.762 --> 03:07:36.063
[SPEAKER_16]: And so...

03:07:36.581 --> 03:07:36.681
[SPEAKER_16]: B.T.

03:07:36.721 --> 03:07:37.422
[SPEAKER_16]: starring Vincent Covello.

03:07:37.442 --> 03:07:37.542
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy!

03:07:57.281 --> 03:07:58.361
[SPEAKER_16]: A little bit different from BT.

03:07:58.642 --> 03:07:59.902
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, actually, no, screw that.

03:07:59.962 --> 03:08:00.622
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not playing that one.

03:08:00.962 --> 03:08:01.103
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

03:08:01.723 --> 03:08:01.943
[SPEAKER_16]: Better.

03:08:01.963 --> 03:08:10.646
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do the Crystal Method, Keep Hope Alive, BT's Creatine Method mix, and we're going to play a little bit of that because that's seven minutes long and we don't need to play the whole thing.

03:08:10.746 --> 03:08:10.886
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

03:08:27.874 --> 03:08:28.135
[SPEAKER_04]: and more.

03:09:08.795 --> 03:09:09.456
Thanks for watching!

03:10:06.876 --> 03:10:07.421
Thanks for watching!

03:11:32.222 --> 03:11:32.862
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was fun.

03:11:34.884 --> 03:11:35.424
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it was.

03:11:35.964 --> 03:11:40.427
[SPEAKER_18]: I have kind of a special treat for you guys tonight for some real post-show music.

03:11:40.447 --> 03:11:44.749
[SPEAKER_18]: We're actually going to be doing a whole bunch of music for my personal MP3 collection.

03:11:45.310 --> 03:11:46.010
[SPEAKER_18]: That should be fun.

03:11:46.751 --> 03:11:47.011
[SPEAKER_17]: Right?

03:11:47.631 --> 03:11:47.911
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

03:11:48.652 --> 03:11:49.052
[SPEAKER_18]: Say yes.

03:11:50.623 --> 03:11:52.144
[SPEAKER_18]: Because everybody loves my taste in music.

03:11:52.204 --> 03:11:53.525
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but there's a lot of fun stuff in here.

03:11:54.105 --> 03:11:55.185
[SPEAKER_18]: So I hope you guys enjoy it.

03:11:55.926 --> 03:11:57.987
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still trying to get the last few songs in here.

03:11:58.087 --> 03:12:06.951
[SPEAKER_18]: But I did want to say, definitely keep checking out our website over at www.orangelandredo.com Next week's show, very good chance that it's going to be taped next week.

03:12:07.052 --> 03:12:11.674
[SPEAKER_18]: Because some of us have other things we are already committed to for next weekend.

03:12:12.314 --> 03:12:15.396
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're not going to be able to probably be here live on Sunday night.

03:12:15.416 --> 03:12:17.357
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll probably have some kind of tape show going on.

03:12:17.997 --> 03:12:46.445
[SPEAKER_18]: look for details on our website also I forgot to mention this during the show but that Akira Yamaoka contest we're going to have to delay another week because there's some stuff going on we just want to make sure we do the damn thing right so we need to delay for another week so sorry guys and that's about it all the details on that will be coming to the website very soon as well and that's going to be very cool and yes Loki

03:12:47.805 --> 03:12:54.248
[SPEAKER_16]: and soon, or maybe a little later on, we will be doing more contests and more giveaways.

03:12:54.828 --> 03:12:56.169
[SPEAKER_16]: The prize being anime movies.

03:12:56.509 --> 03:12:56.909
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

03:12:57.270 --> 03:13:01.812
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I have like fucking ten plus cases of anime movies in my closet I need to get rid of.

03:13:02.792 --> 03:13:04.013
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a lot of anime.

03:13:04.053 --> 03:13:06.074
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have like another two cases at work.

03:13:06.654 --> 03:13:08.975
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, there'll be anime giveaways.

03:13:11.816 --> 03:13:13.717

03:13:14.838 --> 03:13:15.358
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, the

[SPEAKER_16]: That'll be, uh, we'll figure out some stuff with that later.

03:13:18.398 --> 03:13:20.480
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe, uh, I don't know, we'll figure stuff out.

03:13:21.541 --> 03:13:24.243
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, too bad I don't have any more porn to give away.

03:13:25.444 --> 03:13:26.085
[SPEAKER_16]: That I don't have.

03:13:27.126 --> 03:13:29.528
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember your Make Edit Get Porn contest?

03:13:29.548 --> 03:13:30.889
[SPEAKER_16]: That was, like, the best thing ever.

03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:42.659
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the greatest contest ever, and I remember who won it, and it was great because, you know, when he, um, came over, it was, like, all, like, kinda, here, put it in the bag, put it in the bag.

03:13:44.727 --> 03:13:54.790
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was like a whole 50 tapes of, you know, Playboy and softcore porn.

03:13:55.431 --> 03:13:56.231
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was great.

03:13:57.011 --> 03:14:00.172
[SPEAKER_16]: But MakeEditGetPorn, that was a contest that was wonderful.

03:14:00.192 --> 03:14:08.135
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll have to do something similar like that one day, you know, MakeRemixGetPorn or, you know, something like that.

03:14:09.356 --> 03:14:09.916
[SPEAKER_16]: But, later.

03:14:10.016 --> 03:14:10.196
[SPEAKER_16]: Later.

03:14:11.431 --> 03:14:14.512
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that would be bigger than any remix contest out there right now.

[SPEAKER_18]: Make remix get porn.

03:14:16.113 --> 03:14:19.614
