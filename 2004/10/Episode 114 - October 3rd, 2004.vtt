02:40.840 --> 02:50.360
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity, Orange Lounge may contain plenty of b-b-b-cocky.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.920
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

In this episode...

02:54.920 --> 03:01.400

03:22.580 --> 03:25.700
We are live!

03:25.700 --> 03:33.640
And this is episode number 114 for this October the 3rd of 2004.

03:33.640 --> 03:41.940
You're tuned in to the Internet's most diverse radio station of all things, B-Imani.

03:41.940 --> 03:42.940
My name is Rob Roberts.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.980
You might know me as Sky.

03:44.980 --> 03:48.020
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

03:48.020 --> 03:49.020
farm.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.020
Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, Starks, after all.

03:52.020 --> 03:53.020
You know what?

03:53.020 --> 03:58.020
When you were trying to think of a description, you don't want to know the things that just went through my head.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.020
What went through your head? I want to know.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.020
You know what went through my head?

04:02.020 --> 04:06.020
Nerves, blood, brain matter, that went through my head.

04:06.020 --> 04:08.020
Oh my!

04:08.020 --> 04:14.020
And in that corner, futzing with our webcam or something, our tech massa Loki.

04:14.020 --> 04:19.020
Yes, I am futzing as you call it with the webcam.

04:19.020 --> 04:21.740
We actually have an extra special treat for our listeners tonight.

04:21.740 --> 04:26.220
We have a brand new webcam angle, just for tonight, because it's only the three of us,

04:26.220 --> 04:27.940
so there's no guests to focus on.

04:27.940 --> 04:34.780
So you get to see Loki and me this time on the webcam, the whole show, and our really

04:34.780 --> 04:40.140
dirty work area, which I'm almost embarrassed to have on the cam, but I don't care.

04:40.140 --> 04:41.140
Let the world know!

04:41.140 --> 04:42.140
I don't care.

04:42.140 --> 04:45.180
I can't put my feet on the webcam anymore.

04:45.180 --> 04:48.180
You could still get to, oh, we do have a guest after all.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.180
Hi!

04:49.180 --> 04:50.180
Oh!

04:50.180 --> 04:53.340
That's alright, we'll keep the webcam angle this way, that's right.

04:53.340 --> 04:58.180
Say hello to Arcadian42, Bradley just showed up.

04:58.180 --> 04:59.900
Hi.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.580
Oh, we appreciate Arcadian's presence, even though we did think we were going to have

05:04.580 --> 05:07.500
a guest free show, but that's alright.

05:07.500 --> 05:12.340
Alright, well we certainly have some Bimani news to talk about tonight, believe it or

05:12.340 --> 05:13.340
not, and randomness.

05:13.340 --> 05:15.460
I assure you there's plenty of randomness tonight.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.460
You okay?

05:16.460 --> 05:17.460
I hate jalapenos.

05:17.460 --> 05:18.860
Why am I eating them?

05:18.860 --> 05:22.620
Yes, Jamie is starting off the show in her traditional manner by eating tonight.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.580
Hey, I haven't had dinner, okay?

05:24.580 --> 05:26.180
We don't have any food at my house.

05:26.180 --> 05:28.500
I totally porked out before tonight's show.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.820
I ate so much food, I just...

05:29.820 --> 05:31.780
I've had low-carb chocolate truffles.

05:31.780 --> 05:32.780
Three of them.

05:32.780 --> 05:35.380
And half a double bag.

05:35.380 --> 05:38.500
I had skinny crust pizza from Round Table.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.660
Not that I'm on a diet or anything, I just really like the skinny crust pizza.

05:41.660 --> 05:45.660
I like New York pizza, which is pretty much very similar, very skinny crust.

05:45.660 --> 05:49.660
God, Loki's going to kill himself trying to rig his webcam.

05:49.660 --> 05:53.660
Maybe his portal to hell will open up.

05:53.660 --> 05:57.660
Maybe. Alright. And take him home to his people.

05:57.660 --> 06:01.660
Lots of randomness tonight. I know I've

06:01.660 --> 06:05.660
got a couple random things I want to talk about, and who knows what else.

06:05.660 --> 06:09.660
We have some news that we missed last week, because Extreme was the big news last week.

06:09.660 --> 06:14.100
news we kind of miss that I want to get to and I know I want to get pissed off

06:14.100 --> 06:16.520
at some point tonight actually I have something I'm kind of pissed off about I

06:16.520 --> 06:21.320
want to rant about later and well I'm sure you guys are feeling some anger too

06:21.320 --> 06:24.600
so we'll definitely have a nephew of the week segment cage match and all your

06:24.600 --> 06:28.940

06:28.940 --> 06:36.480

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840

07:09.520 --> 07:13.400

07:13.400 --> 07:16.160
It's just like you said in the very first episode of Orange on the Radio, I'll never

07:16.160 --> 07:22.600
forget this, is that you were ranting about parents at Golfland, and you said, I remember

07:22.600 --> 07:26.640
the quote, you said something like, if you're not going to do your job, god damn it, I will.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.640
The parents don't want me to do their job.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.640
I would be a scary mom.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.640
Alright.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.640
Also, we've got the new Ultra Mix 2 song.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.640
We'll play that for you at some point tonight.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.640
And it's a previous Cage Match winner.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.640
I believe it was picked by Dark Sakura.

07:42.640 --> 07:43.640
Huh?

07:43.640 --> 07:45.640
Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.080

08:15.640 --> 08:17.640
The mic will sing soon as I touch it

08:17.640 --> 08:19.140
Dude, it's smooth and easy like

08:19.140 --> 08:21.140
So we might get hyped to hear tonight

08:21.140 --> 08:23.140

11:27.600 --> 11:28.600
Don't watch me

11:28.600 --> 11:30.600
Carving like a nutcracker, crushes a nut

11:30.600 --> 11:32.600
This is survival for my rival when I'm on the cut

11:32.600 --> 11:34.600
I'm staying in your memory like the date of your birth

11:34.600 --> 11:36.600
Back then you're like Gatorade when I'm quitching my curve

11:36.600 --> 11:38.600
I'm the back of the ladder and you're the stable

11:38.600 --> 11:40.600
I'll catch you like my DJ cuts a record on the table

11:40.600 --> 11:43.600
I wanna fly, get off the battleground, you're no map for the gods

11:43.600 --> 11:46.600
I could beat you down like a star, I'll put you in a muggle

11:46.600 --> 11:48.600
I'll break you in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle

11:48.600 --> 11:52.100
and I'll murder your style, I'm the one doing the same, yeah, you are a tribe

11:52.100 --> 11:53.540
I'm conducting, arranged, putting all my in place,

11:53.540 --> 11:55.540
Form a line such as so you can bleed your key

11:55.540 --> 11:57.040
I wanna rock!

12:00.040 --> 12:03.360
So beat, just rock me, don't try to stop me

12:03.360 --> 12:07.780

12:07.780 --> 12:11.780
Just rock me, don't try to stop me, yo

12:11.780 --> 12:39.540
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on the air.

12:39.540 --> 12:42.640
And uh, whatever happened to Step Squad?

12:42.640 --> 12:44.640
I haven't heard you talk about them in a while, Jamie.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.000
I haven't heard, hardly heard from anybody lately, it's just, I, you know, I've been

12:48.000 --> 12:50.560
so busy that it's hard to keep up with anyone.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.560
I talked to, uh...

12:51.560 --> 12:53.920
You have to explain what Step Squad, because we have a lot of new people that only started

12:53.920 --> 12:58.400
listening a couple months ago and we started giving, you know, exclusive hints and stuff,

12:58.400 --> 13:02.400
now people start listening to us, so explain for those that don't know what Step Squad

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
is all about.

13:03.400 --> 13:09.100
squad was established to sort of combat some of the I guess more negative

13:09.100 --> 13:13.720
aspects of the whole DDR team business that was going on. It's basically just people who

13:13.720 --> 13:32.000
were... Owned Stu! Owned Stu more. I pwn you. Pwned! That's so stupid. Anyway, anyway it was more or

13:32.000 --> 13:36.620
less just an attempt to to you know show more the some of the more positive

13:36.620 --> 13:42.000
aspects or group of people who would I guess embody those type of what the hell

13:42.000 --> 13:49.700
are you doing God anyway it was supposed to be more or less the whole positive

13:49.700 --> 13:56.300
aspect of what a DDR community could be like anyway I haven't hardly though

13:56.300 --> 14:01.100
heard from anybody because we're all busy busy people and I'm going to school

14:01.100 --> 14:12.020
and having no life and okay that cover is scaring me that's okay everybody

14:12.020 --> 14:19.780

14:45.360 --> 14:49.800
energy that you're putting into it while you're making it yours what the hell's

14:49.800 --> 14:51.800
It's the resolution on your monitor.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
My goddamn monitor sucks.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.800
Yes it does.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.800
I know.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.800
Hey, I can't go up any higher.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.800
Uh, how to fix that?

15:01.800 --> 15:02.800
You need to get a new monitor.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.800
I don't need to get a new monitor, I just need to turn the gamma up.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.800
Degas it.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.800
Oh, fine, I'll do it anyways.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.800
That's fine.

15:11.800 --> 15:12.800
Okay.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.800
You were talking?

15:14.800 --> 15:17.800
No one was paying attention, so I just stopped.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.000
It was about Step Squad and how cool we are.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.200
Give me the damn mic.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.800
Damn, he's like hoarding the mic over here. I'm not gonna let Rob have it. We can't have a show

15:28.800 --> 15:29.360
tonight.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.960
No, Rob, you don't get to talk. Alright.

15:32.960 --> 15:36.960
We're gonna get duct tape for you. Yeah. Anyway, I have to tease

15:36.960 --> 15:40.400
something. I'm gonna tease something. We have a sequel

15:40.400 --> 15:43.400
to a classic Orange Lounge Radio inside joke

15:43.400 --> 15:48.520
coming up a sequel we're all about the internet yes remember sequels they

15:48.520 --> 15:49.920
always have a bigger budget

15:49.920 --> 15:52.720
and they're always much better just kidding they're actually over the

15:52.720 --> 15:53.400
television

15:53.400 --> 15:57.280
you should the third one usually ends up better yeah well we do have the sequel

15:57.280 --> 16:00.680
in a minute after how was your week how was your day of course

16:00.680 --> 16:04.880
we start off all episodes of Warren's Laundrio Dark Sakura how was your week how was your day

16:04.880 --> 16:08.040
my week consisted of work and school

16:08.040 --> 16:11.360
because guess what I have no life

16:11.360 --> 16:17.360
All I do is go to work and all I do is go to school and go to the track and go to the gym.

16:17.360 --> 16:26.360
I went to spin and I was so happy because I was so pissed off and mad at the world on Friday that I went to spin and had a fun time.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.360
Worked out all that aggression.

16:28.360 --> 16:33.360
But nothing really major happened this week.

16:33.360 --> 16:39.360
I'm getting Sims 2, which is going to make me happy and I'll have even less free time.

16:39.360 --> 16:56.360
I'm also training somebody at work, and I've got a few more changes in mind in my chosen field.

16:56.360 --> 17:01.360
Different things at work going on. I'm not really going to go into too much detail about it,

17:01.360 --> 17:04.360
but there may be some changes afoot in the next couple of months.

17:04.360 --> 17:08.360
alright I went to a party last night

17:08.360 --> 17:11.840
you know me I'm such the party girl

17:11.840 --> 17:15.080
but I ended up because I was just gonna go

17:15.080 --> 17:18.360
hang out and do whatever. What was the occasion?

17:18.360 --> 17:21.480
Random. Just random party? It was like

17:21.480 --> 17:24.800
oh my god we're bored. Let's have a party. Alright it works.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.920
But I was over at Iguana Girl's house

17:27.920 --> 17:33.640
and oh my god moo is female. We didn't know what gender moo was

17:33.640 --> 17:35.640
Because iguanas take a year before you get to the other side of the room.

18:03.640 --> 18:08.720
what I was saying I just decided that I was gonna participate and you know not

18:08.720 --> 18:16.220
be a pooper so I had 12 jello shots

18:16.960 --> 18:22.120
remember kids orange lawns radio wants you to drink responsibly I didn't drive

18:22.120 --> 18:26.980
I called I called Dan oh wait it see that that's that's the classic double

18:26.980 --> 18:30.840
standard I love about this culture it's always you know be sure that if you

18:30.840 --> 18:35.560
drive you drink responsibly now if you didn't drive get fucked up nobody cares

18:35.560 --> 18:40.960
you just get fucked up it's your liver once you got your keys in the ball you

18:40.960 --> 18:46.040
can get fucked up my keys are in my purse I knew better but I ended up

18:46.040 --> 18:53.040
having 12 jello shots because it was all low-carb stuff so vodka is low-carb so I

18:53.040 --> 18:57.960
had we had it with the sugar-free jello so I had 12 of them because I have this

18:57.960 --> 19:05.640
thing for vodka I don't feel it until after I'm done with it um I also had a

19:05.640 --> 19:11.120
couple glasses of this cranberry vodka beverage and then this cranberry and

19:11.120 --> 19:19.640
orange liqueur beverage and something else and lots of meat I was in happy

19:19.640 --> 19:28.640
boos meet heaven. What? That is so like a quintessential quote for you now. I was in

19:28.640 --> 19:38.100
happy boos meet heaven. Okay. Please somebody note the date and time. Thank you. We have

19:38.100 --> 19:42.800
our archivist in the chatroom. That would be at 6.50. Thank you. Our archivist is in

19:42.800 --> 19:46.200
the chatroom so we'll let her handle it. Yeah could you write that down for the next intro?

19:46.200 --> 19:54.000
you anyway I also put some more thought into my I'm actually one of my classes I

19:54.000 --> 19:58.920
finished all the homework for I'm very happy another one I have one more week

19:58.920 --> 20:03.640
of assignments and I'm done with that class hallelujah praise the Lord no more

20:03.640 --> 20:09.320
databases I spent four hours freaking working on a database today it's up

20:09.320 --> 20:13.040
cheese well I was also chatting with people to which I thought was more

20:13.040 --> 20:17.200
important than doing my homework but that was that was really it I'm gonna go

20:17.200 --> 20:21.320
ahead and try to get the other one done Thursday ahead of time just go ahead and

20:21.320 --> 20:26.240
get it out of the way stop putting it off although procrastination is pretty

20:26.240 --> 20:34.960
fun anyway that was my week my day oh yeah I passed out at 1130 and woke up at

20:34.960 --> 20:41.280
630 in the morning and guess what you sound like me at a party no I I just I

20:41.280 --> 20:48.360
I just decided I was randomly sleepy and I actually did consciously go to bed.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.840
And then next thing I know, it's six in the morning.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.480
I am wide awake and not hungover.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.880
See, I don't think I would even drink so badly.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.760
We should have went to church today.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.760
Bite me!

21:00.760 --> 21:04.280
Excuse me, I don't know.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.040
But no.

21:06.040 --> 21:14.840
I ended up wide awake not in the least hungover and then that's when I ate that chocolate.

21:14.840 --> 21:20.920
I don't think that I would have, I think that I would not drink as wildly as I do on the

21:20.920 --> 21:27.560
rare times that I do because I don't have any consequences other than my liver going

21:27.560 --> 21:28.560
woo alcohol.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.920
I just don't get hungover.

21:32.920 --> 21:39.960
from you coming from a long line of beer drinking you know not me I don't like

21:39.960 --> 21:45.200
beer oh my god somebody else talk I'm tired all right fine we'll move on to

21:45.200 --> 21:50.560
somebody else's weekend day okay how was your week how was your day my week was

21:50.560 --> 21:58.240
okay I was mainly hobbling around still a little better now my toe is kind of

21:58.240 --> 22:02.440
ugly looking at although I do think that somehow there's like an infection under

22:02.440 --> 22:12.380
my cuticle cuz it's still kind of poofy and a little bit of pussy and so yeah

22:12.380 --> 22:15.860
I'll probably do that but I mean other than that no it doesn't really hurt my

22:15.860 --> 22:18.880
other toe hurts now though because the nails kind of long on it and I just

22:18.880 --> 22:25.100
accidentally kicked into the desk and that's not fun but no this week I saw a

22:25.100 --> 22:31.860
ton of movies I saw sharks tail because it was free and that was okay and then I

22:31.860 --> 22:38.260
I saw The Forgotten, which, if anyone's seen the trailer, you know what the movie's about.

22:38.260 --> 22:41.740
Literally, you know what the movie's about. You've already seen the entire recording of

22:41.740 --> 22:47.840
the movie. And then I watched Ju-On, which is, for those who don't know it, the Japanese

22:47.840 --> 22:53.480
version of the movie coming out called The Grudge. And if you've seen that movie, then

22:53.480 --> 22:58.560
you've seen The Grudge already, because it's pretty much, from what I've seen on the trailers,

22:58.560 --> 23:04.300
exactly the same shot. You know what? I have to say something about that. Now, the trailer

23:04.300 --> 23:10.060
for Ringu and the Ring had all the same identical scenes, and there was a lot different about

23:10.060 --> 23:14.260
movies. Well, the only thing that's going to be different, I think, is one, it's probably

23:14.260 --> 23:19.540
going to be linear, because Ju-On was fucking hard to follow. He just kept skipping around

23:19.540 --> 23:24.320
and was like, what the hell? That's just Japanese cinema. What the hell is going on here? But,

23:24.320 --> 23:28.880
My only complaint about it is, how can people be that dumb to walk into a haunted house

23:28.880 --> 23:29.880
like constantly?

23:29.880 --> 23:32.840
They're like, yeah, so we know that every single person that's gone through this house

23:32.840 --> 23:36.640
has disappeared, so I'm gonna go inside that house!

23:36.640 --> 23:37.640
Save on the, uh, tax.

23:37.640 --> 23:42.560
And then at the very end of the movie, they like show something that's kinda, I guess

23:42.560 --> 23:46.600
would be like a way to ward off whatever it is.

23:46.600 --> 23:52.240
And then like, not even 30 seconds later, another ghost comes, and the woman doesn't

23:52.240 --> 23:55.480
do the thing that ward off the first one

23:55.480 --> 23:59.440
and then she disappears

23:59.440 --> 24:02.200
oh how can you not see that

24:02.200 --> 24:05.660
uh... then i watch battlefield baseball which is fucking awesome

24:05.660 --> 24:09.620
it's like shaolin sakur with baseball but it is crazy because

24:09.620 --> 24:12.760
the main character doesn't play baseball anymore because he killed

24:12.760 --> 24:13.880
his father with

24:13.880 --> 24:17.160
his fast pitch it was so fast it went through him

24:17.160 --> 24:24.640
and kill them and then they sung a song about it. That was the best thing. Best thing ever.

24:24.640 --> 24:30.560
But it's great though because there's like people that are getting impaled on shit. There's

24:30.560 --> 24:33.720
like this whole team that look like they're full of zombies or whatever but they're not.

24:33.720 --> 24:38.160
They're just these really weird people. And this guy that looks like the mask with, or

24:38.160 --> 24:43.440
he looks like an Australian version of the mask. He's on the other team with like the

24:43.440 --> 24:47.440
the head coach and there's this, like all these people keep getting killed, oh there's

24:47.440 --> 24:52.040
this one guy who keeps getting killed throughout the movie and every time he comes back as

24:52.040 --> 24:58.840
a different person with the same haircut. It's just quite weird. But um, so that was

24:58.840 --> 25:05.240
a cool movie. And then other than that I got um, I don't know, I played my Final Fantasy

25:05.240 --> 25:11.960
And I bought some new CDs. I bought Steven Lynch's CD, and he's funny.

25:11.960 --> 25:34.280
And then BT, Ten Years in the Life, and that was a compilation of his best works, plus some new stuff I haven't heard of BT, and remixes that he did, including a Crystal Method remix that he did, and that was kinda cool.

25:34.280 --> 25:45.280
And other than that, really not all that much went on, just a little bit of movies, and hobbling, and still didn't finish the device, working on it.

25:45.280 --> 25:49.280
Oh, and I got Sims 2 and I was torturing Sims. That was fun.

25:49.280 --> 25:59.280
The only thing about that game, though, is that it has really slow fires. Like, I started a fire in my kitchen, and it took it about two days to finally get across the kitchen.

25:59.280 --> 26:04.080
because you know it's cool because the fire department can't come even though I

26:04.080 --> 26:07.220
have smoke detectors because I have a moat around my house and there's no way

26:07.220 --> 26:13.460
in or out but if you're interested in what I thought about the sims 2 you can

26:13.460 --> 26:18.820
check out my review on orangesonsradio.com which we have reviews for other

26:18.820 --> 26:24.380
games on there too. Yeah actually Jason and I are talking about plans to try and

26:24.380 --> 26:27.660
expand the review section a little later too because I want to do a full review

26:27.660 --> 26:32.100
of DDR Extreme, although I am going to have a mini-review of DDR Extreme showing up in

26:32.100 --> 26:38.300
the very near future somewhere else, so maybe we'll talk about that later, I don't know.

26:38.300 --> 26:43.220
Anything else you want to share about your weekend today?

26:43.220 --> 26:46.420
I don't think so, no, that's it.

26:46.420 --> 26:49.620
Alright, Bradley, how was your week, how was your day?

26:49.620 --> 26:57.620
It was pretty boring, it worked, finally submitted my last thing for temp, worked,

26:57.620 --> 27:00.020
So now I'm permanent in the company, finally.

27:00.020 --> 27:00.920
Woo-hoo!

27:00.920 --> 27:01.920
Yay.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.420
Ooh, clap, clap, clap.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.620
Then Wednesday, listen to the debate, mostly,

27:06.620 --> 27:10.020
because it was like the first time I turned on my TV

27:10.020 --> 27:12.140
to actually watch TV in, like, 33 months.

27:12.140 --> 27:13.580
And it was on every channel.

27:13.580 --> 27:14.080
What?

27:14.080 --> 27:15.420
And it was on every channel.

27:15.420 --> 27:18.220
Something like that.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.740
It was, like, behind me, and I was listening to it most

27:20.740 --> 27:22.420
while I was playing on the computer.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.820
And then after that, not much.

27:24.820 --> 27:27.340
This weekend, it didn't do very much.

27:27.340 --> 27:34.740
Did my state taxes, oh boy, woohoo, cuz again wait like till October if you don't owe anything

27:34.740 --> 27:39.740
and that's about it, right on, exciting.

27:39.740 --> 27:44.540
My week and my day, like Jamie I was kind of a party animal this weekend, I went to

27:44.540 --> 27:49.220
a party Friday night, my friend John had a birthday so I went over to his house for a

27:49.220 --> 27:52.660
birthday party and I went with a bunch of my friends, unfortunately I didn't really

27:52.660 --> 27:57.220
get a chance to drink a whole lot, I did like a shot or two but I didn't get quite as

27:57.220 --> 28:00.820
comfortable as Jamie did at the party she went to, but it was a good time. I met a lot

28:00.820 --> 28:05.720
of really nice new people. I met this one girl who was really into anime, like she seemed

28:05.720 --> 28:09.660
like she'd be somebody who might like this show, so hopefully I remembered to plug the

28:09.660 --> 28:14.580
show with her, but I don't remember. Anyway, and just, you know, a lot of cool people there,

28:14.580 --> 28:21.580
and we just had a good time laughing, hanging out, and then yesterday I actually decided

28:21.580 --> 28:25.720
to drive to my old hometown. I lived there for three years, where I went to school in

28:25.720 --> 28:31.000
in Chico, California, which is about an hour north, about an hour and a half north of Sacramento

28:31.000 --> 28:35.160
where this show is based, which is a little college town. There really isn't anything

28:35.160 --> 28:41.840
in Chico, California except a college and retired people, so it's this interesting mix

28:41.840 --> 28:46.600
of people. But I had myself a good time. I never really enjoyed the place while I lived

28:46.600 --> 28:50.260
there, but now that I'm just a visitor, I actually have a lot of fun every time I go.

28:50.260 --> 28:55.100
I went to this bar and I actually got a little drunk, which wasn't a good idea since I had

28:55.100 --> 28:59.980
driven so I had to like wait around till like 2 or 3 a.m. so I could sober up but

28:59.980 --> 29:04.700
we went to this bar and I just danced like crazy I don't know what it was I

29:04.700 --> 29:08.180
was just totally dancing like crazy like flailing my arms about and jumping and

29:08.180 --> 29:13.220
then like I saw this like this guy and this girl were dancing next to me and

29:13.220 --> 29:17.740
the girl at one point like hopped up on the guy's shoulders and the guy was like

29:17.740 --> 29:21.220
doing all these dirty things to the girl then the girl started like leaning back

29:21.220 --> 29:28.260
like it was a really bad scene like out of the pool scene in showgirls seriously

29:28.260 --> 29:31.460
that's what it looked like was the pool scene in showgirls but like on a dance

29:31.460 --> 29:35.060
floor it was something you would see in like an 80s dance from that film or

29:35.060 --> 29:37.540
something I don't know but they were getting cheers and stuff we were like

29:37.540 --> 29:40.800
right next to him so it's kind of weird and you know I don't know how often you

29:40.800 --> 29:45.260
guys go to dance clubs but it is it still humors me to this day when they

29:45.260 --> 29:48.940
play like DDR music in dance clubs I don't know why that is but I find it

29:48.940 --> 29:54.380
really humorous and like I remember they played sandstorm was one song they play

29:54.380 --> 29:58.020
and I was like I'll dance into that and they had played better off alone which

29:58.020 --> 30:03.500
isn't a DDR song but it really should be you know yeah so I was having a good

30:03.500 --> 30:13.380
time so not that I actually dance like DDR because that really is not the point

30:13.380 --> 30:19.060
but you know it's still kind of fun and I guess that's really it I just kind of

30:19.060 --> 30:22.140
partied a lot this weekend and I'm going out tonight to a club again so I'm kind

30:22.140 --> 30:26.260
of being a little but tonight I'm going back to the goth club so I cuz I had a

30:26.260 --> 30:31.740
lot of fun last time I was there so I'm going again tonight yes I'm gonna paint

30:31.740 --> 30:35.660
my nails black and look like I've done I know I'm kidding I I I'm just gonna go

30:35.660 --> 30:40.700
have fun so you should go back tomorrow after work the goth club and we're like

30:40.700 --> 30:47.440
yellow maybe I should go dress like a cheerleader or something actually they

30:47.440 --> 30:50.340
probably think that was cool

30:50.460 --> 30:55.220
give you the evil cheerleader maybe I don't know it's funny you should you

30:55.220 --> 30:58.560
should well I know you you don't like going to dance clubs but if if you like

30:58.560 --> 31:02.360
dance clubs you would like this one maybe I'd have to go sometimes just to

31:02.360 --> 31:05.560
stand in the corner and look you know evil yeah well that's what a lot of

31:05.560 --> 31:10.160
of people do, actually, yeah. You just stand there looking bored. I swear, you just sit

31:10.160 --> 31:15.000
right in. That's like the prerequisite for being goth, you have to be able to stand around

31:15.000 --> 31:22.320
and look bored. And wear lots of black. At least that's how it was with all the people

31:22.320 --> 31:27.280
I hung out with. I remember the goth club, that's where the big hairy guy in the corset

31:27.280 --> 31:29.960
wanted to have sex with me.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.400
What?

31:31.400 --> 31:34.640
We're bears, grrrr.

31:34.640 --> 31:39.160
I thought this movie I saw on Thursday, I went and saw a movie called A Dirty Shame

31:39.160 --> 31:43.400
and for those that know me well at all, I'm a huge John Waters fan. If you don't know

31:43.400 --> 31:44.920
who John Waters is, you should.

31:44.920 --> 31:48.840
He directed Hairspray. Yeah, back before it was a musical but

31:48.840 --> 31:52.920
like Hairspray is like very tame for his movies. I'm talking movies like Pink Flamingos,

31:52.920 --> 31:55.640
Serial Mom, Desperate Living, those are all the ones I really like.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.520
Yeah, I haven't seen Serial Mom.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.400
Oh, you should. Serial Mom's a wonderful movie.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.000
But he has a new movie in theaters called The Dirty Shame, and it's a total sex comedy.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.440
Like, it's NC-17, it is just absolutely perverse.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.000
And I don't know why I was thinking of that movie just now, but I was.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.480
I do recommend it, even though, seriously, like, the last 30 minutes of the film,

32:14.480 --> 32:18.960
whoever wrote the script was, like, so coked up that, like, it makes absolutely no sense.

32:18.960 --> 32:29.000
just being honest with you. Okay, on that note, let's go back to our show www.orensonsradio.com

Now, as promised a little bit earlier, I have the sequel to an inside joke and this is actually

32:42.040 --> 32:46.960
one of our new inside jokes but do you remember a couple weeks ago when we had a little bit

32:46.960 --> 32:56.800
of a flub up from Tom Brokaw and he was doing the bukkake thing. Well, it actually came

32:56.800 --> 33:00.860
to my attention. It's actually in the intro. It actually came to my attention at the party

33:00.860 --> 33:05.920
I was at on Friday. For some reason, you know, I was talking about the bukkake thing. I don't

33:05.920 --> 33:10.600
know how it came up. But somebody told me, he said, hey Rob, you know what? That's not

33:10.600 --> 33:14.760
the first time he's done that. He actually flubbed up once before and they told me where

33:14.760 --> 33:21.440
to go. So this is old news. This flub up is like a year old, but I swear it's twice as

33:21.440 --> 33:26.680
funny. So listen to this. It's a little bit long, but listen carefully. Listen carefully

33:26.680 --> 33:29.200
for the mistake.

33:29.200 --> 33:34.320
The President's trip to Ohio today was a bold effort to cash in on his wartime popularity

33:34.320 --> 33:39.200
as he tries to push through his tax cuts. The key component in what the President insists

33:39.200 --> 33:41.240
is a job stimulus program.

33:41.240 --> 33:45.240
Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.640
And as NBC's David Gregory reports tonight,

33:47.640 --> 33:49.400
the president took his message right

33:49.400 --> 33:52.040
to a powerful Ohio Republican

33:52.040 --> 33:55.840
who is not convinced the tax cuts are the answer.

33:55.840 --> 34:00.840
Did you hear that?

34:03.480 --> 34:04.960
My God.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.800
Hold on one more time.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.240
The cops over there doing the little schoolgirl giggle.

34:08.240 --> 34:12.380
one more time over time report tonight the president took his message right to

34:12.380 --> 34:14.960
a powerful ohio republican

34:14.960 --> 34:18.440
who is not convinced the tax cuts

34:18.440 --> 34:20.560
tax cuts

34:20.560 --> 34:27.560
it's funny when serious news people make big mistakes like that i mean

34:31.520 --> 34:35.740
i mean how many times do you hear the word cut on the nightly news seriously

34:35.740 --> 34:37.740
Who has not convinced the tax concert.

34:41.740 --> 34:46.740
That absolutely has nothing to do with Bomani and it has nothing to do with video gaming whatsoever.

34:46.740 --> 34:48.740
It has to do with Rob having a giggle fit.

34:48.740 --> 34:52.740
It's really fucking funny. Like I've thought of that phrase several times today.

34:52.740 --> 34:58.740
Like I'll just be sitting there. I was sitting there at dinner earlier today and I was just eating and then suddenly I just had these images.

34:58.740 --> 35:00.740
Who has not convinced the tax concert.

35:00.740 --> 35:10.960
and I started giggling God bless the internet I'll post that sound file on

35:10.960 --> 35:16.720
our forums a little later just like I did the bukkake thing so huh that was

35:16.720 --> 35:25.600
beautiful what what what what what what what what what see what I tell you chat

35:25.600 --> 35:30.560
room what do you think was that better than bukkake I think they think so I'm

35:30.560 --> 35:35.000
getting a lot of ha ha ha's so I guess they like that. That's like a year old but I had

35:35.000 --> 35:37.680
never heard of that. I mean it was new to me so I figured it would be new to you guys

35:37.680 --> 35:41.000
too. I didn't hear about that. Maybe you guys did, I don't know.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.760
There are people in the world who do not pay attention to the news.

35:43.760 --> 35:52.760
I know, I know. Alright. And in case you don't know what a cunt is, cause it looks like someone

35:52.760 --> 36:02.000
in our chat room doesn't know. A cunt is a euphemism for a lady's, um, yeah, anatomy.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.800
Take that as you will. Alright. Let's change topics really quick here before I get into

36:07.800 --> 36:14.520
stuff too far. And actually we will do a Bamani related piece here. Actually, Ultramix 2,

36:14.520 --> 36:19.560
there was some brand new news on Ultramix 2 this week. A brand new song was revealed

36:19.560 --> 36:26.800
And the band is Delirium, and the song is called After All, and it's remixed by a couple

36:26.800 --> 36:30.040
guys who did a really popular song in 7th style.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.600
I did do that in a cage match.

36:31.600 --> 36:36.080
And you actually put this song in a cage match one time.

36:36.080 --> 36:39.980
This is the really interesting thing, is now this is the first, now where was the Orange

36:39.980 --> 36:41.840
Lawns Radio cage match based on?

36:41.840 --> 36:46.920
We originally said it was like songs that we want to hear in DDR, and lo and behold,

36:46.920 --> 36:52.120
We have our very first cage match winning song that is now in a DDR game.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.120
We swear we didn't blow-

36:53.120 --> 36:54.120
I'm prophetic.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.120
Huh?

36:55.120 --> 36:56.120
I'm prophetic.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.120
Yeah.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.120
We didn't blow anybody at Konami.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.120
We didn't blow anybody at Konami.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.120
No, we considered it very strongly.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.120
Yeah.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.120
We did.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.120
We did think about it.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.120
But.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.120
Yeah.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.120
Anyway.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.120
I want to cue this up.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.740
A little clip of the beauty of silence.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.680
You guys probably know this song.

37:10.680 --> 37:13.040
It's hoarded out all the time on 7th and 8th style.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.040
But here it is.

37:14.040 --> 37:27.120
Everybody knows that song. You like that song, right? The one from 2DX? Well, those guys,

37:27.120 --> 37:31.360
Svensson and Gielen, remixed a Delirium song and it's going to be in DDR Ultimate 2 and

37:31.360 --> 37:35.800
we are going to play it. The clue stumped everybody for a long, long time, but actually

37:35.800 --> 37:39.300
I'm really proud. One of our news, our news guy, Dark Tetsuya, was the one that finally

37:39.300 --> 37:43.420
solved the clue and the way he figured it out was finally he did a Google

37:43.420 --> 37:47.340
search there were these two guys on the picture that Jason Enos had posted in

37:47.340 --> 37:51.060
the DDR freak thread or no I'm sorry not Jason what am I thinking I'm sorry

37:51.060 --> 37:54.540
somebody that worked at the company or somebody there had posted the DDR freak

37:54.540 --> 38:00.060
thread when I thinking about like these two guys that were like gay guys or

38:00.060 --> 38:05.760
something and everybody was like yeah I was like who are these they're like gay

38:05.760 --> 38:10.840
guys or something like that right and like everybody was assuming that the

38:10.840 --> 38:14.760
guys were gay and they were totally wrong they just happened to be Spenson

38:14.760 --> 38:19.200
and Guilin but nobody thought to search for Spenson and Guilin so very

38:19.200 --> 38:25.160
interesting huh all right actually it's kind of funny because I didn't even I

38:25.160 --> 38:29.560
didn't even realize it when I was doing the show a couple weeks ago uh-huh and I

38:29.560 --> 38:36.300
played another version I have of after all it's actually on the the delirium

38:36.300 --> 38:45.080
best I think it was I think this is it I think that both versions are on here

38:46.440 --> 38:52.560
okay no it's not on this one but it's on another delirium CD that I have that has

38:52.560 --> 38:55.360
both versions of it

38:55.360 --> 39:02.200
Alright, we're going to play that song for you guys, and after that we'll play, I guess

39:02.200 --> 39:07.080
we'll play the whole beauty of silence so you guys can hear it, and then we'll come

39:07.080 --> 39:11.040
back with the show, but I know you guys may not have all heard this song yet, sometimes

39:11.040 --> 39:15.040
people look to us to play the new UltraMix 2 songs for you guys, so we're going to play

39:15.040 --> 39:19.240
it for you guys right now, and when we come back, there's more news about UltraMix 2 I

39:19.240 --> 39:22.400
want to get into, this is on everybody's mind this week, and I have a lot I want to say

39:22.400 --> 39:27.940
about it too as well. So, here we go, this is Delirium with After All.

39:27.940 --> 39:30.940
Mensing Gila Mix, new for Ultramix 2, enjoy!

39:57.940 --> 40:00.580
Because there's a light in me

40:00.580 --> 40:03.940
And all these things are mine

40:03.940 --> 40:07.700
Come to watch, it's a mess in my sight

40:07.700 --> 40:11.380
No good to give, no meaning to leave

40:11.380 --> 40:15.060
I'm missing you girl tonight

40:15.060 --> 40:19.380
Everything will start all

40:19.380 --> 40:25.380
And we'll all be shaking, still be safe, oh

40:25.380 --> 40:33.380
As the woman said, he turned away from her goal She said she wouldn't run, that would be the call

40:33.380 --> 40:36.380
For all these years, it'd still be single...

40:39.380 --> 40:47.380
As the woman said, she turned away from her goal She said she wouldn't run, that would be the call

40:47.380 --> 40:55.380
She knows I'm waiting in the rain

40:55.380 --> 41:02.380
Nothing's left but a dream of silence

41:02.380 --> 41:06.380
And so all she sees now is the sun

41:06.380 --> 41:10.380
The scene is young, she's upside down

41:10.380 --> 41:13.380
With pictures behind her closed eyes

41:13.380 --> 41:18.380
I'll shine you into my own

41:32.380 --> 41:36.380
After all these decades, every day, oh

41:36.380 --> 41:42.380
As the morning shakes turn away from her bones

41:42.380 --> 41:46.380
Said she wouldn't cry, that's what she just knows

41:46.380 --> 42:00.380
As the morning shakes turn away from her bones

42:00.380 --> 42:04.380
That she wouldn't cry, that would be a crime

42:04.380 --> 42:08.380
And we'd all be shaking, still be saying no

42:10.380 --> 42:14.380
As we'd all be shaking away from her

42:14.380 --> 42:18.380
That she wouldn't cry, that would be a lie

43:14.380 --> 43:26.380
Music

43:26.380 --> 43:28.380
Music

43:28.380 --> 43:40.380
Music

44:10.380 --> 44:39.380
Gaming radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

44:39.380 --> 44:52.780
I'm going to beat that joke in the ground, just you wait.

44:52.780 --> 44:56.540
That was awful.

44:56.540 --> 44:58.360
Beautiful.

44:58.360 --> 44:59.540
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

44:59.540 --> 45:04.860
Hope you enjoyed that little sneak peek there at Delirium with After All.

45:04.860 --> 45:06.380
Going to be in UltraMix 2.

45:06.380 --> 45:09.180
How many more songs they have to announce for UltraMix 2 still?

45:09.180 --> 45:10.180
Like what?

45:10.180 --> 45:11.180
Like 150?

45:11.180 --> 45:12.180
I don't know.

45:12.180 --> 45:13.180
Like how many songs?

45:13.180 --> 45:15.780
There's an ungodly amount of songs they still haven't even told us for UltraMix 2.

45:15.780 --> 45:18.260
At least, at least like what, 40?

45:18.260 --> 45:19.260
I don't know.

45:19.260 --> 45:20.260
I don't even remember.

45:20.260 --> 45:22.420
I haven't been, I haven't been doing my math very well, so.

45:22.420 --> 45:26.460
But there's a lot of new songs still coming for UltraMix 2, and that's just the beginning.

45:26.460 --> 45:29.660
I, I really like that song, and I can't wait to play it in UltraMix 2.

45:29.660 --> 45:32.940
I know you gotta be excited about that one, Jamie.

45:32.940 --> 45:35.300
You, you, you called it, in a way.

45:35.300 --> 45:36.300
I did.

45:36.300 --> 45:46.600
awesome all right also Ultramix 2 news this week there was a there was a video

45:46.600 --> 45:49.840
posted on the internet and I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard of this by

45:49.840 --> 45:54.120
now but if you haven't run on over to a website orange lounge radio.com and it's

45:54.120 --> 45:57.420
the second story down on our site right now it talks about the Ultramix 2 quad

45:57.420 --> 46:02.480
mode video that's right the video was posted on the internet that shows quad

46:02.480 --> 46:07.760
mode in action oh excuse me I'm a little burpee today yeah and quad mode is that

46:07.760 --> 46:11.760
mode now on DDR that you have not one not two not three but four dance pads

46:11.760 --> 46:15.920
all lined up in a row and you're dancing back and forth across all four dance

46:15.920 --> 46:19.800
pads and this video is posted on the internet of this mode yeah you you

46:19.800 --> 46:22.760
probably haven't seen this yet dark sagra have you let me show you this

46:22.760 --> 46:27.740
because actually what really is causing up a storm here it has nothing to do

46:27.740 --> 46:32.360
really with the quad with the quad mode itself but it has everything to do with

46:32.360 --> 46:39.140
and how the game actually looks. So you definitely want to check this out here. Let's see if

46:39.140 --> 46:48.140
we can get the video up here. Oh, I gotta give it a minute. It's gonna load up here.

46:48.140 --> 46:53.020
Unless I saved it to the desktop or something. Yeah, well, it takes just as long to copy

46:53.020 --> 46:58.940
it over as I would to download it, so I'm stuck now. Alright, it's coming, it's coming,

46:58.940 --> 47:05.740
hold on. But yeah, this is definitely generating a lot of buzz in the DDR community right now,

47:05.740 --> 47:09.660
because we really haven't heard a whole lot about Ultramix 2, but outside of Songlist.

47:09.660 --> 47:13.960
And the game's only like, what, six weeks away, supposedly, from what we've heard, six

47:13.960 --> 47:19.220
weeks away from release? Okay, here we go, here it is. Here's the video. Let me... It's

47:19.220 --> 47:26.940
clip a ride on the light so look at that there's all these brand new videos

47:26.940 --> 47:30.540
there's like a motorcycle thing that's all brand new everything looks like

47:30.540 --> 47:35.540
futuristic like all these new videos and then of course you know quad mode pretty

47:35.540 --> 47:41.700
much looks the way you would expect it to but the rage has a new model look at

47:41.700 --> 47:45.060
that rage looks completely different like he's got like really poofy hair he

47:45.060 --> 47:51.300
looks like me in the morning kind of with that hair and his motions are much

47:51.300 --> 47:55.860
different we saw this 33 that all of the models and now he's doing like

47:55.860 --> 48:01.100
cartwheels and stuff like totally different dances yeah well no we saw it

48:01.100 --> 48:06.340
at at a e3 and we saw Emmys Hucci model right but the thing is is that actually

48:06.340 --> 48:09.700
this video shows you it might be the other video let me bring yeah if I bring

48:09.700 --> 48:14.420
up the other video she's been de Hucci five because a bunch of people fussed

48:14.420 --> 48:19.620
about it at e3 we do not want who GM I actually from what I understand when I

48:19.620 --> 48:23.540
was told is that actually because of a lot of the e3 feedback they did kind of

48:23.540 --> 48:27.180
reevaluate what they had done with Emmy and they changed her back and so in this

48:27.180 --> 48:29.860
other video I'm going to pull up you can actually see and if you want download

48:29.860 --> 48:32.340
these videos yourselves orange on straight calm we have a link right there

48:32.340 --> 48:36.720
on the front page still don't get pencils rage they need hoochie fight

48:36.720 --> 48:42.860
characters for download I'm telling you I know I want to hire a res monitor or

48:42.860 --> 48:44.780
are model of

48:44.780 --> 48:47.380
mister spanky

48:47.380 --> 48:54.300
look at me back to normal there this is a three-player mode

48:54.300 --> 48:58.080
you feel a multiple dancers kind of going at one time there

48:58.080 --> 49:02.500
afro and you've got uh... rage and emi all dancing in this one three-player

49:02.500 --> 49:04.580
dance mode

49:04.580 --> 49:06.300
doing ballet

49:06.300 --> 49:08.460
uh...

49:08.460 --> 49:10.460
coloring them up and suck your teeth.

49:13.460 --> 49:15.460
One hundred combos!

49:17.460 --> 49:19.460
I can't see Emi.

49:21.460 --> 49:23.460
Oh, it's her fourth mix costume.

49:25.460 --> 49:27.460
One hundred combos!

49:30.460 --> 49:32.460
Yeah, she may be a hoochie fighter. That's cool.

49:32.460 --> 49:38.020
so they gave her just like this utter Uchi version of like the fourth

49:38.020 --> 49:43.140
mix outfit and that was just kind of wrong it was not you would think it's

49:43.140 --> 49:51.260
cool so anyway lots of reaction in the baumanni community going on to those

49:51.260 --> 49:57.980
videos now I usually don't talk about certain posts on certain websites but

49:57.980 --> 50:01.820
there was one post that really just got my panties in a bunch to be honest and

50:01.820 --> 50:05.820
And this guy came out of the blue and just started

50:05.820 --> 50:10.820
dogging on the quad mode video saying, those steps are horrible!

50:10.820 --> 50:14.580
They're bad, and we all know this would happen. I've, we've told

50:14.580 --> 50:17.700
Seagurd, we've told Mel when they were here on the show before we said you know what

50:17.700 --> 50:18.820
people are gonna hate the steps.

50:18.820 --> 50:22.420
We had to say it to you guys, that's the first thing people are going to bag on when Ultra Mix 2 comes out, and

50:22.420 --> 50:26.540
I'm sure the steps are great, they're awesome, but there's always going to be somebody that doesn't like

50:26.540 --> 50:30.500
the steps. And sure enough, this guy comes out of the woodwork and just starts

50:30.500 --> 50:34.900
dogging on the steps saying they're horrible for a standard mode what are they doing with all these

50:34.900 --> 50:41.300
crowds like all this bullshit and i'm just thinking get a load of this guy you know whatever

50:41.300 --> 50:48.020
you know everybody's welcome to their opinion but then i found out after some more posts went by

50:48.020 --> 50:55.620
that this guy had done some of the step charts for in the group and i'm sitting here going who

50:55.620 --> 51:00.300
the fuck are you get off your high horse I mean seriously I talked about in the

51:00.300 --> 51:04.580
groove here last week on the show it's a nice game it's a cute alternative to DDR

51:04.580 --> 51:08.100
it's not a replacement for DDR but it's something else fun to play but the steps

51:08.100 --> 51:12.500
are not all that okay I mean they're they've got some neat new ideas but

51:12.500 --> 51:17.540
they're no better or worse than what we got right now I mean God it's kind of

51:17.540 --> 51:21.180
like God get over yourself I just think doesn't poor taste because when you when

51:21.180 --> 51:24.660
you're representing a company like that especially when you've got all these

51:24.660 --> 51:28.220
questionable legal issues going around for you to go and start dogging on the

51:28.220 --> 51:32.060
enemy game I mean it just makes you look like you had a vendetta from the start

51:32.060 --> 51:36.020
your opinions me don't mean shit and it just makes your whole game look shitty I

51:36.020 --> 51:38.780
mean there was a point earlier this week I was like I'm gonna come on Sunday show

51:38.780 --> 51:41.380
I'm gonna take back everything nice I said about in the group because that

51:41.380 --> 51:44.900
guy's pissed me off I've calmed down a little bit since then I'm not gonna take

51:44.900 --> 51:49.460
back everything nice I said about in the group but I mean seriously what a lack

51:49.460 --> 51:53.020
of class. Can I take back everything nice you said about anything? You can say whatever

51:53.020 --> 52:00.380
you want. I take it back for Rob. I'm kind of surprised there's no reaction from our

52:00.380 --> 52:03.580
chat room. I thought half of them were following what was going on. I don't know. We've still

52:03.580 --> 52:11.100
got people fixated on you talking about getting your panties in a bunch. You know. What did

52:11.100 --> 52:15.260
you think of this, Loki? I mean, you're kind of more Sim scene oriented than us, so what

52:15.260 --> 52:16.260
What did you think of this?

52:16.260 --> 52:19.260
I don't know. I didn't read the post.

52:19.260 --> 52:22.260
Probably for the best. To be honest, probably for the best.

52:22.260 --> 52:25.260
I just hate people bitching about shit that they haven't seen yet.

52:25.260 --> 52:27.260
Oh my god! They're so awful!

52:27.260 --> 52:29.260
The game's not out yet.

52:29.260 --> 52:30.260
I know.

52:30.260 --> 52:32.260
But I can tell! I have ESP!

52:32.260 --> 52:34.260
That's like, god.

52:34.260 --> 52:36.260
That's because they're psycho and have ESP.

52:36.260 --> 52:40.260
If only he knew. If only he knew, I can't say.

52:40.260 --> 52:44.260
If only he knew, he couldn't really say anything.

52:44.260 --> 52:52.180
just you know yeah anyway but what's interesting is that you know I I don't

52:52.180 --> 52:55.700
even know it's almost like they're just looking for an excuse to dog on these

52:55.700 --> 52:59.260
people who work their ass off on you know putting this given this game

52:59.260 --> 53:04.180
together we all know damn well that KDA folks were doing the steps this time

53:04.180 --> 53:07.540
because they wanted to make it right what they did from Ultramix one they

53:07.540 --> 53:10.980
knew that they screwed up the steps so they wanted DDR fans to do the steps and

53:10.980 --> 53:14.220
and some people are jealous that they weren't the ones doing it so they're

53:14.220 --> 53:15.420
taking the first step

53:15.420 --> 53:18.920
chance they can to just dog on what's going on and these guys work their ass off

53:18.920 --> 53:22.580
they were working like 12, 14 hour days that would make you cry

53:22.580 --> 53:25.980
in to get this game done for us and you know it just I think it's just totally

53:25.980 --> 53:27.260
disrespectful and just

53:27.260 --> 53:31.180
I honestly if this guy had nothing to do with the other game

53:31.180 --> 53:34.080
I don't think it would be such a big deal because you just ride it off as well you know there's

53:34.080 --> 53:35.220
always gonna be one heckler

53:35.220 --> 53:39.160
but the fact that he represents because he worked with this other game he

53:39.160 --> 53:40.960
therefore represents that other game

53:40.960 --> 53:44.960
It just shows an utter lack of class. It just makes me, like, it just disgusts me.

53:44.960 --> 53:53.460
It's not even a fact that he represents the other game, because, I mean, let's just say he was the guy that was doing the art for the backgrounds for, like, you know, their game, you know, songs or whatever.

53:53.460 --> 53:58.960
That wouldn't even be so bad, but it's the guy that did some of the step charts, okay? That's even worse.

53:58.960 --> 54:04.960
And I'm getting told in the chatroom, hey, don't put in the groove down because of one guy, and you know what? I...

54:04.960 --> 54:10.460
I don't... like I said, I was gonna come in here and say a lot of nasty things about it, but I decided not to, but here's the problem.

54:10.460 --> 54:15.060
when this guy who works on the game can't show any class at all

54:15.060 --> 54:18.220
or any sense of respect at all for what's going on

54:18.220 --> 54:22.260
you know on the other half of the fence, it does bring the whole image

54:22.260 --> 54:25.580
of everybody on the staff down and I'm sure there's some wonderful people that

54:25.580 --> 54:28.060
work on the game, there's wonderful people that play the game, there's no doubt about that

54:28.060 --> 54:31.260
but one bad apple is can spoil a barrel

54:31.260 --> 54:34.980
it's just like if anybody out there that uses an orange lounge banner in

54:34.980 --> 54:35.780
their signature

54:35.780 --> 54:39.060
I would expect that you're not a fucking asshat in your post

54:39.060 --> 54:42.180
because you're kind of representing our station and if you were starting to be

54:42.180 --> 54:45.140
an asshole in your post I would call you on it I'd say you know what don't use our

54:45.140 --> 54:46.900
banner anymore if you're gonna act like an ass

54:46.900 --> 54:50.180
luckily nice people use our banner so we don't have that problem but

54:50.180 --> 54:53.900
when you're representing another you know company I'm sorry but when you act

54:53.900 --> 55:00.260
like an ass it makes everybody look like an ass

55:00.260 --> 55:01.180
anyway

55:01.180 --> 55:05.540
no I completely agree that's why I have to reason why I don't say where I work

55:05.540 --> 55:15.540
No, seriously. Because I know how I am outside of work. I don't want to be seen as a representative of my company when I'm not associated with it.

55:15.540 --> 55:16.540
Right. Me too. Same thing.

55:16.540 --> 55:21.540
So, none of us have ever said exactly where we work for it, except for Loki, but he doesn't care.

55:21.540 --> 55:23.540
He doesn't care what you think of his company.

55:23.540 --> 55:31.540
To be honest, I don't think anyone would even know about how to get on internet radio at my work, let alone, you know, be able to figure things out.

55:31.540 --> 55:37.140
figure things out and they're like there's where do you guys broadcast on the internet you can do

55:37.140 --> 55:43.380
that but it's like when there's radio on the internet holy crap what's the internet it's like

55:43.380 --> 55:50.500
you know when um when i went to vegas um as part of the ddr freak moderator trip there were these

55:50.500 --> 55:54.900
guys here who were like fanboys who were following us around everywhere and i still wanted to turn

55:54.900 --> 56:00.500
around and say don't you have lives go home but because i was a representative of ddr freak i

56:00.500 --> 56:09.620
didn't say that I was just tolerant we actually ended up losing so you know

56:09.620 --> 56:13.260
that and you know what does the guy have valid points I don't know but the

56:13.260 --> 56:16.660
problem is is that it was a total like attitude problem just it wouldn't take

56:16.660 --> 56:21.620
you know could dish it out but couldn't take it back I'm spending I'm spending

56:21.620 --> 56:24.300
way too much time on this topic to be honest it really doesn't deserve this

56:24.300 --> 56:28.260
much time but that just really I just want you guys to think out there you

56:28.260 --> 56:32.500
know if you're representing a certain you know game stop being an idiot and

56:32.500 --> 56:36.060
that even goes for just any old DDR player somebody playing DDR at the

56:36.060 --> 56:40.020
arcade if you start acting like an ass you make every player that looks like

56:40.020 --> 56:45.260
plays DDR make look like an ass so show a little bit of respect I mean it's just

56:45.260 --> 56:48.620
like I kind of frown at some people that certain people to play Soulcalibur 2 in

56:48.620 --> 56:51.380
the area because they're kind of assholes I mean and it's I'm sure you

56:51.380 --> 56:54.900
know it's a great game I own it on GameCube but you know it kind of brings the

56:54.900 --> 56:57.900
whole fan base down a little bit when a couple people look like asses and don't

56:57.900 --> 56:59.900
Don't get me started on the initial D, people.

57:03.900 --> 57:05.900
I'm going to second that.

57:06.900 --> 57:08.900
I'm not even going to go there.

57:09.900 --> 57:12.900
That's actually probably a much better example. I can think of more examples for that.

57:14.900 --> 57:19.900
Hi, I play this racing game, so I have a really awesome car that's stored on a piece of paper.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.900
I like in the groove, don't get me wrong.

57:26.900 --> 57:31.460
I mean not well not not just that but you know initial D as well, you know

57:34.940 --> 57:38.540
Anyway, I think we beat that into the ground. Yeah, we did beat I have ice cream

57:38.540 --> 57:41.280
I just I wanted to get that out of my system. I've been sitting on that all week

57:41.860 --> 57:45.460
Do you feel better a lot actually do you feel spiritually? I do

57:46.460 --> 57:50.900
You know what? I would I would go so far as to welcome that guy on our show if he wants to present a

57:51.180 --> 57:53.180
dissenting opinion go for it

57:53.180 --> 57:57.140
I'd love to hear it I would love to debate it would be just like the

57:57.140 --> 57:58.220
presidential debate

57:58.220 --> 58:01.540
you sir but seriously

58:01.540 --> 58:05.940
it's just one step chart on a mode that really I mean honestly quad mode it's

58:05.940 --> 58:08.060
cute and all but it really isn't that important

58:08.060 --> 58:12.060
I mean I want to see what the rest of the game looks like to be honest let's

58:12.060 --> 58:14.180
look at some singles and doubles and how

58:14.180 --> 58:19.940
I mean honestly out regardless how you feel about the step chart look at this

58:19.940 --> 58:23.620
all new backgrounds a whole new song a whole new interface

58:23.620 --> 58:27.060
characters look differently no more hoochie emi I mean there's so

58:27.060 --> 58:30.060
you could throw the steps right out completely and there's so many good things about it

58:30.060 --> 58:36.140
I'm very pissed off that they got rid of hoochie emi that makes me sad

58:36.140 --> 58:39.660
maybe she's an easter egg she's not an easter egg they just

58:39.660 --> 58:43.860
there you're making the poor CG woman look like a hoochie

58:43.860 --> 58:46.980
no it might hurt her artificial feelings

58:46.980 --> 58:50.980
Who cares if it didn't look right?

58:50.980 --> 58:54.980
I mean, some things just aren't right, but they happen.

58:54.980 --> 58:58.980
Like the Olsen twins acting. That's just not right, but it happens.

58:58.980 --> 59:02.980
Um, but yeah, if we want to get down on someone that sucks

59:02.980 --> 59:06.980
at steps, holy crap, who about the people that made that

59:06.980 --> 59:10.980
stupid fucking hands and feet mode? Those are some shitty steps right there.

59:10.980 --> 59:14.980
That's what I gotta say. That's who you should be mad at.

59:14.980 --> 59:20.380
at it. Screw quad mode. Quad mode's difficult because it's four pads. Hands and feet mode,

59:20.380 --> 59:26.780
man, they did not... Screw you. I kind of like hands and feet mode. Screw you. You can

59:26.780 --> 59:30.740
actually... From what I hear, you can actually go in and change the difficulty, but for whatever

59:30.740 --> 59:34.340
reason, they made it kind of like almost impossible to find where to change... Like, I just found

59:34.340 --> 59:38.100
out about this the other day. Like, it's almost impossible like to figure out where you gotta

59:38.100 --> 59:41.580
go to... You know, it's not obvious, in other words. It's not possible. It's not obvious

59:41.580 --> 59:43.620
Where it is to change difficulty, but it's just kind of like...

59:43.620 --> 59:44.940
Hi, my name is Tina.

59:44.940 --> 59:48.940
Ah, shut up Tina, nobody cares.

59:48.940 --> 59:52.420
I hate banner ads that have sound in them, I absolutely hate them.

59:52.420 --> 59:54.180
And that banner is all over the internet right now.

59:54.180 --> 59:56.340
So why not do feedback?

59:56.340 --> 59:57.820
There's a feedback thread.

59:57.820 --> 59:59.460
No, no, I'm not even talking about this.

59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.540
I'm just using this to get that one video that I lost all of a sudden.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:07.700
But it's on like a million other sites too.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.980
Tina can go to hell.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.760
That's how I feel about Tina.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.260
I want to get to this other video, but for some reason I keep trying to pull it up and

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.260
it doesn't work.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.860
Oh, I know why, because I've got to use the other program to do it.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:26.660
Let me, um, doo doo doo doo doo, let's see, uh, I want to load up another video that came

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:33.920
out this week, and it actually has to do for, uh, uh, DDR Festival.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.160
A brand new video came out for DDR Festival, and it shows something kind of interesting

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.160
going on.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.860
uh... let's see what was the name of that

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.460
that this thing

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:46.400
i hear it is this is the idea are festival trade

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.600
now obviously we're on the radio you guys can't see it but i'll tell you

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.840
what's kinda going on here

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.880
a little fireworks

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.320
festival array

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.920
obviously

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.760
there's maximize

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.960
and look at that a brand new character select screen

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.020
that has your characters there's written there's blues and look at that

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.020
One, two, three outfits for every character now that you can pick right there.

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:16.020
Some people are calling that customizable characters. I call that three outfits a character, but whatever.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.020
There's a new guy there. There's a guy named Drum.

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:25.020
So do you think he'll have a partner named Bass? I don't know. We'll see.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.020
And there's a little bit of the song lip.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:39.020
pretty much what you'd expect there's a clip from you're not here a little bit

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:45.100
of the party mode there but it's all in Japanese which makes sense there's that

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:49.700
feed the dog and bunny mode and there are some of the members from be for you

01:01:49.700 --> 01:02:06.940
playing on the iToy. And it looks much better than the iToy actually does. You should see,

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:10.460
like in this video, the B4U chicks, they totally are like paraparing some of these hands and

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.820
beat things on itoy

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:19.820
and i love noria she's such a cracko

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:26.260
look at that look she's like totally par par-ing to clear the screen there

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.660
it's so cute

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:34.660
there's mission mode you know that's coming back

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:47.260
There's a little clip of your reign in that video, we all know that song.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.500
Bunk Boogie.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:59.140
So no big surprises there about DDR Festival, not right now, anyway no big surprises there

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:05.020
about DER Festival, honestly. Basically the three outfits a character thing, that's kind

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:10.340
of new and that's kind of cute. There's probably a whole assload of characters as well. But

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.900
to be honest, this is kind of a chance for those of you guys that don't have a US machine

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.220
to get to experience the iToy modes and basically everything that's in Extreme USA. So if you

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.180
only have a Japanese machine, which I do, I only have a Japanese PS2. If I didn't live

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:26.940
with Loki, I wouldn't have access to an American PS2. So I only have a Japanese PS2, so this

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.940
This would kind of be my option to kind of play a lot of the songs, really, so...

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.940
Too bad Mission Mode's in Japanese, because you can't figure out what the fuck to do.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.940
Exactly, so I don't know how this...

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.940
You know there's going to be FAQs up on that one in no time.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.940
Oh, there'll be FAQs up on it in no time, but...

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.940
I'm not sure how much I would desire to own this game personally.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.940
There's really not a whole lot new in it.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.940
I mean, I already own the Xbox.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:50.940
But, you know, there's, you know, if you don't own an Xbox,

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:53.940
you know, it's your first chance to play some of those songs, and...

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.580
I want the fucking European one. They have better mixes anyways. Get that.

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.300
Well actually there is going to be a song from EuroMix in there. Jameleah with

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.020
Superstar.

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.660
I like that. Which I know best from the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy soundtrack actually.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:09.620
So. Yep. Um. We should probably, we should

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.820
play that at some point. Okay we'll play that song at some point.

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:17.100
I bet some people want to hear that for DDR festival and you know. I played it on my show a couple times.

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.380
Yeah, it's a good song. Oh my god, my spin instructor loves that song. She adopted it.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:25.940
So, I don't know, what do you think about DDR Festival? You own a Japanese and American

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.460
PS2. Is this something you're kind of interested in getting at all, you think, Jamie?

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:34.500
I'll get it. I don't have an iToy, so I don't really give a crap about the iToy modes, but

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:40.860
I'm not going to play a game and watch myself flail around stupidly. So, no. But I'll get

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.700
it. I'll get it for stuff.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.060
I think, you know what, personally, I think I'm actually going to pass on it. I really

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:49.780
don't see the point for me getting it, because I can't read Japanese. I already have all

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:53.460
the songs minus like three or four whatever how many songs have been in DDR

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:57.140
yet I just there hasn't really been anything to really sell me on it yet I

01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:00.340
think it's one of those things I'll pick up later it's a collector thing like

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.980
when it's come down in price a little bit maybe like try to get it when it's

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.620
like a little bit discounted before it becomes a collector's item and

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:10.340
everything but as much as I want to support DDR and all there's too much

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.700
shit to buy in the US right now. I already know what else my money's going for. And UltraMix 2 is coming out like the same week and

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.460
And honestly, my money's going there first.

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.060
I have other imports to get.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:23.840
I have to get 2DX8 style.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.840
And blue jingai.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.340
Because the US version is ass.

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.840
Alright I guess we're going to open up the skype line because you know what, we've talked

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.180
about a lot of different things here.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:38.180
We've kind of talked about quad mode in Ultramix 2 a little bit and a little bit of the controversy

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.180
there.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.180
We talked about DER festival.

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.040
Just curious if you guys have any comments, again if you don't know what the skype line

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:48.440
it's all about, visit www.orangesonsradio.com, click on interact with us, and you can see

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.720
the details right there on how to use the Skype line. It allows you to call our show

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.040
without having a phone. I actually think I'm going to buy the feature to allow us to call

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.460
out so we can do some phone interviews later with some big name DDR celebs. That'd be kind

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:03.460
of fun.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.460
Do you actually call phone numbers?

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.200
Yeah, you can actually call phone numbers using this little tab right here, but you

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.400
have to pay for credits, but you know, I'm thinking about it. I might do that. We'll

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:16.240
see yeah I think it's a neat idea for Skype so we're kind of giving a minute

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.280
for the buffer to catch up because it takes it takes a minute before you guys

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.480
actually hear what we say here in studio so I want you guys to be able to call

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:29.400
into the Skype line yes looky I just was liking one the point out to Rob here

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.680
three away and four way now I'm not mentioning well oh hopefully we get

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.600
those so I just hope they're not fakes look you might have something really

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.160
good to play for you guys later I just hope that God they're not fakes what was

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.560
that thing you were showing me earlier today I guess it's a couple months old

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.720
but somebody had actually written a whole document like an FAQ on how to

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.920
make fake Bahmani songs something like that how to make fake test location songs

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.720
which is another thing that I think is in completely poor taste don't get me

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.840
started you're just preying on poor people that are just looking to get

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.560
excited about a new game it's like you know but whatever

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:09.120
you're sure yeah you're showing me it's somewhere in here or something some

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.800
little uh...

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.140
some little guide on how to write a fake

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.960
the money so i just had to do

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.820
is running something through a bunch of filters and also the garbage

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.080
uh... yeah we're getting a call let's go to skype line

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.940
hello you are an orange launch radio

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.140
it's going to tell them all of the game a moment how you doing

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:29.040
the guy with the calls for dinner

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.900
hey what's on your mind

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.280
well you mentioned the art festival and i have some choice words forty-year

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:40.740
festival. I have a feeling I know it's coming but go for it. Well first of all I

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:47.460
mean I know a lot of mix of US mixes have been accused of being you know like

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:53.100
half-assed like just piling things one on top of the other and not having a lot

01:07:53.100 --> 01:08:01.500
of balance to them. I see festival as probably the a perfect example of being

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:09.420
a half-assed mix just as far as the Konami Originals are concerned I don't

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:13.300
know if it's so much a half-assed mix it's just the fact that for once I think

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.500
it's just the tables are turned and we got something kind of new before

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:22.020
Japanese did so this game coming out for them is kind of like when we got like

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:26.440
DDR USA what the hell was that it was just a rehash thing you know there

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.140
really wasn't anything special about it maybe I'll take the half-assed comment

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:34.660
back and I'll go with rehash, but half-ass was the first thing that I thought of, only

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:43.780
because on the way of the Konami originals included, thus far anyway, none of them have

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:50.980
not appeared on a USA mix yet.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:56.860
The fact of the matter is, the entire Konami original selection, you can find them on United

01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.820
States mixes already.

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:07.820
But for the standard person living in Japan who has a casual passing interest in DDR, it is going to be something new to them, so, you know.

01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:08.820
Oh, of course.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:15.820
But for us, for the import fans, for us, it's no big deal unless we don't have Xbox or don't have a US PS2, you know?

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:22.820
So that's pretty much it. For the Japanese gamer, it's something nice because they get more songs that they don't have on their PS2s yet.

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.820
For the American importer, it's kind of a letdown.

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:30.660
But for us fucking obsessive collectors, it's kind of a letdown.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:34.380
But you know, we have to kind of face the fact that we're in the minority.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.580
And Konami, they're getting three games for their buck here, really.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:43.260
I mean, we all kind of know that Konami of Japan actually were the ones that did

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.660
the interface that Konami USA keeps getting criticized for.

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.880
But basically, Konami of Japan made this interface, and they got three games out

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.040
of it.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.140
They got the one in Europe, they got our game, they got their new festival.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.740
So hey, I'm sure it worked out great for them.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:56.780
Oh, yeah, definitely.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.900
Very easy to develop.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.500
You come up with a basic skeleton,

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.180
and then you plug in the insides.

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.140
For me, I just think it's kind of neat to kind of have the tables turned

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:06.660
for once.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.940
And we're getting something new.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:12.100
And it's kind of like, oh, well, we don't need the Japanese mix now.

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.620
We don't need to support that.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:16.100
It's kind of, it's the same damn argument

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.520
that we heard three years ago when it was USA was getting the sloppy seconds,

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.020
you know?

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:20.520
Exactly.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.220
It's in reverse now.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.180
still some people who are going to spin this into Japan's favor

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.200
and it's I I think it is I I think it's comedy

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.060
gold for all those people that were dogging on extreme before saying it

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:36.700
wasn't Japanese enough I think it is just comedy gold it's totally

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:41.320
it's totally just desserts for those people that just said you know it's

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.440
crap it's USA just the America ruined DDR

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.040
no not really the direction in DDR right

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.960
this is the direction they wanted to move in but America in fact

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.260
I in fact I would go so far as to say that Hawaii which is an American state

01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.160
last time I checked

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.960
is going to revolutionize CDR so no question about that

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.120
especially when you're getting 50 songs that are completely new

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.280
and never been seen before you never before you never see that unless you're

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.040
talking about a brand new Japanese arcade mix

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.360
I'm gonna go I'm gonna go so far as to make a prediction here on the program

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.200
that when Ultramix 2 comes out, about a couple weeks after Ultramix 2,

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.280
it is going to be so huge, and it's going to be so...

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.160
there are going to be those detractors, like people that work for In the Groove or

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.480
whatever, that are going to be out there going, ah, this game sucks.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.560
But for the most part, 90 percent of the scene is going to just love this game and

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.120
say this is everything DDR should have been,

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.360
and I'm saying that there are going to be freaking riots and petitions

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.200
for Konami of Hawaii to do an arcade mix. The Konami of Hawaii should be given all

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.860
the rights to do a new arcade mix. I would go so far as to say that. I think they're

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:55.620
going to be forgiven for DDRPC. I think most people have already forgiven them for it.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:59.600
It was just a chance for them to get their feet wet, and we've all managed to look past

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:05.180
it now. UltraMix had some problems, but for the most part it was different. It was new.

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:09.920
And now UltraMix II is going to blow it all away.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.480
I definitely agree about UltraMix II, especially with the song list is pretty much half revealed

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.000
by now, and it just blows everything out of the water.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.500
And now just the videos this week, what did you think of the videos that came out this

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.500
week?

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:28.980
The Rage remodel kicks ass.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.860
And the backgrounds and the videos looked awesome.

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:34.040
I was very impressed with the movies.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.040
Very impressed.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.180
You know to be honest though, there's a part of me that's like, why did they bother to

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.920
show this game at E3?

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.900
Because it looked nothing like what they've got now.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:47.460
kind of like it's like they played a trick on us it's like that e3 thing was

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:51.140
a total waste it was just a chance to say we're working on something and now

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:54.420
you know this game is just looking incredible but it's so funny because

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:59.980
even I at e3 said Ultramix to you know don't don't waste your breath you know

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:05.980
it doesn't look like the right thing but boy did I get screwed yeah definitely

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:09.700
the first thing yeah I'll agree with you the first thing is I go when I saw

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:13.380
Ultramix to say no they got a nice selection of Konami originals that may

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.380
may or may not make it in the game. It looks good so far.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.380
Yeah, they got that point battle thing.

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:23.380
You know those Konami originals? Well, they're in there and that's all the old stuff you're getting.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:26.380
Yeah. And by the way, there's 70 songs.

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.380
Exactly.

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.380
Any other thoughts on your mind, Mr. Mullet?

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.380
No, after that long voice thing.

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.380
Well, we appreciate your perspective, as always.

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.380
No problem.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.380
Have a wonderful day.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.380
You too.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.380
Alright, bye-bye.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.380
Bye.

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.380
The other line was ringing.

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:58.380
I'm sure we'll get a return call there.

01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.380
We can pick that up.

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:03.380
If you want to interact with the show, www.orangelandsradio.com

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.380
and click on interact with us.

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.380
Here comes a call.

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.380
Hello, you're on Orangelandsradio.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.380
Hello, who's this?

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:18.480
who's this you're breaking up really really badly try again okay hi how you

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:29.900
doing you know what oh yeah I hate to do this but I gotta let you go because we

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.240
can't hear you at all you're really breaking up bad double-check your

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.200
connection just it's really really breaking up there I can't understand you

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.700
So, we'll try that again later. Maybe we'll get a better connection.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:46.200
That's kind of why the downside of having to take the calls online is that when you get the packet lost and all that crap.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.200
Loki, are you downloading porn over there? Is that why it's so choppy? I'm just kidding.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.200
Alright, I guess we better disable the Skyblind for a little bit.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.700
We'll let it get a little better there.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:15:00.700
And, we'll go to a break.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:04.700
Because I want to get to the Orange Laundry cage match and some other Bimani news that came out this week for sure.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.200
We also have other favorite segments.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.600
Yes, and we'll open up the Skyline a little bit again later.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.480
In this break we're going to hear some music from,

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:17.000
I don't know, some Japanese mixes, some Japanese songs that are popular

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.320
in DDR, because Jamie really wanted to hear

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.920
Ninzaburo, or, what the hell is the other name of Ninzaburo? I always called it Ninzaburo.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.920
The theme of Furuhata. Thank you, Furuhata theme, I couldn't even remember that.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.760
Which is from the show, Furuhata Ninzaburo. That's right. So we're going to play some of these songs, and then we will be back with more

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.760
Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back.

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:37.560
But it's always been the fast lane, like the yellow, you can't stop me

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.260
I've seen so many blood stains, so many times with these brains

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.260
To help people see what's high, I'm sitting here like the sky

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.260
Keep it real, you ain't gonna lie, that a lot of people ain't survived

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:49.260
This is your life, no kidding, look at her, and stay with the pain

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.260
It's a puppy fish, yeah!

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:46.260
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!

01:18:46.260 --> 01:19:11.620
You're out of situation, motivation, situation You're out of motivation, situation, motivation

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:14.620
Oh, you have to run

01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:17.620
Oh, you have to run

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.620
Oh, you have to run

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:24.620
Oh, you have to run

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.620
Dance, come see me, chance

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.620
Get the freedom, that's who the beat them moves

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:32.620
So fit the groove

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:33.620
Come on, dance

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.620
Jump, come on, let's jump

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.620
Let's get the beat, let's groove

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.620
Let's move your feelin', come!

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.620
How you doin'? How you feelin', baby?

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.620
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.620
said.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:38.860
I was a little bit of awkward silence there, sorry guys.

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:41.500
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:45.660
I just got distracted by the chat room while I was trying to queue up the last bit of playlist

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.660
thing there and I got too distracted.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.820
Yeah, don't stay on our chat room.

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:58.980
I forgot to mention that actually I was up this morning, well I was up til 5.30 last

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:03.380
night and I got up this morning at about 1130 or so I started playing ultra mix

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.860
like all morning I swear to God I was playing ultra mix for like two hours

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:11.380
today online on the dance you know playing against other people thing and I

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:17.260
think in one day I raised my ranking on the ranking board from 999 which is you

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.180
know basically as low as you can get like you have to get a certain amount of

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:22.780
points where you can ever crack that number I think I raised it up all the

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:28.700
way to like 640 something in a day's work so which isn't that many points but

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.840
I just for some reason today Ultramix is like still popular

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.700
I was in a lot of four-person matches and the people were kind of picking a lot of light songs

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.640
And we're kind of kind of struggling a little bit

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:47.120
But you know my only complaint about Ultramix online is that god damn people keep picking the same damn songs

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.340
Like the default song that comes up when you want to pick a song to battle against somebody is

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:58.640
0.59 right Tengoku if you want to call it that too. That's the default song and so of course

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.600
like a million matches get started with that song because people don't know how

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.640
to change it and it's kind of like I'm so sick of this song and then for some

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.000
reason today there was this one person I swear to God every match he or she

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.320
created I think it might have been a she every match she was creating secret

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:16.120
rendezvous was her song it's like it kind of sucks there's not a whole lot of

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:19.440
people on Ultramix usually there's only a couple groups of people playing so

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.960
you're kind of stuck with whatever songs you can actually find yeah wow it's not

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.960
It's not like every time you start a game with DO THAT THING!

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.960
Okay, now it's not true. Just today, I played Shiny Disco Balls and DXY in games, okay?

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.960
So, just, you know, shut your mouth.

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960
Woohoo, DXY!

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.960
Nobody else will pick Do That Thing. I have to show Do That Thing a little love.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.960
Everybody loves Do That Thing.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.960
What? What? What are you pointing at?

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.960
Dead people!

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.960
Oh, oh, Loki wants me to talk about this story, speaking of songs.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:57.680
We just posted this to our website, even though this isn't like directly Bimani related, it's

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.000
kind of Bimani related.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.640
One of the ladies from the Weather Girls, Yzora Rhodes, she was one half of the Weather

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.440
Girls, she died this week.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:10.080
And the Weather Girls, of course, if you didn't know, they did the song, It's Raining Men,

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:15.400
which was covered in a more very infamous Max 2 song by Jerry Halliwell, aka Ginger Spice,

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.580
which by the way, was one of the other DDR songs I heard at the club last night was Jerry

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:22.940
Halliwell's version of It's Raining Men and I don't think I've ever heard that

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:27.540
at a club in my life and I don't think I've ever seen a dance floor so gay.

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:32.660
They played it one time at Dave & Buster's. Oh that's cool. It was from Bridget Jones Diary

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:38.300
which had a pretty pretty well-received soundtrack from what I remember but...

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:46.500
Moment of silence please for one half the weather girls, Yzora Rhodes.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:24:16.260
Alright, there we go, alright, and a little clip for us to remember, bye.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:20.040
I don't care how you feel about that song, you can't deny it's a good DDR song.

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.040
It's great for DDR.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.560
It really is.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.400
Sure it makes the game look a little fruity, but you know what?

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.400
The song rocks.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.400
You know what?

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.360
I don't think that people can help but look fruity on DDR.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.920
For every song like It's Raining Men, you get a song like Daikinkai, which is kind of,

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.160
you know, it's kind of rocking and mannish, I guess.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:44.040
It's a very testosterone-y song, I think.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.040
So you know, equippage.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:51.880
there's all the tacos stuff yeah which makes me happy so shut your mouth yeah

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.560
we should take all of those people actually go play pata pata excellent

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.840
point for a moment in our chat room I'm still trying to figure out how songs are

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.820
gay without the ability to come out and tell us I'm wondering how songs have a

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:11.160
gender preference do you like dude like you know boy songs go chat up other boy

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:19.160
I'll give you a hint. The Do That Thing video is kind of what clues you in to the fact that that song's a little gay.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.160
Testostaroni.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.160
Yes.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160
Is that the new San Francisco machine?

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.160
Yes. Ding, ding. Testostaroni.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.160
That was pretty funny.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:38.160
I'm being teased by the listeners. I don't like that. I'm supposed to be proving some kind of fake power over them, and I don't like being teased.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.160
Rob, is your journalistic integrity being breached?

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.160
Yes. I'm being breached.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.160
You're being breached.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.160
And I don't like it.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.160
So we have more Bimani news.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160
Uh, sure we do.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.160
I was actually going to queue up the cage match, but if you want to talk-

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160
Okay, cage match.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:59.160
Well, then let's do more Bimani, since you brought it up.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.160
You're the one talking about testosterone and bringing it up.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.160
Testosterone-y.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.160
Yes, Logie?

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:22.160
I'd like to make a little side note here, if anyone's interested in looking for like a nice DDR pad, our friend at, um, the local Golf Land is selling off his Solo 2000 arcade stage, if you want it.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.160
Really?

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:30.160
Yes. So he's selling that for anybody that's interested, um, I don't know how you can get ahold of him.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:39.160
Uh, he's on DDR Freak as Koon Doggy. K-U-N, uh, Doggy. So, just, um, you might be able to PM him and ask him.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.160
The Sage is fucking heavy, it is 200 pounds, so.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160
It's a real solapad, I saw it.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160
It's a real thing, so.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.160
It's a modified Sage.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.160
No, it hasn't been modified.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.160
No, it hasn't been modified at all.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:52.160
Yeah, he hasn't really done anything with it yet. Just in case you're interested and have a lot of cash.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.160
Does he have an idea of how much he's charging for it?

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.160
No.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.160
I'll pay a dollar.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.160
Haha, put it on eBay.

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:07.160
Also, as long as we're doing miscellaneous Orange Honest Radio announcements, I do want to say happy birthday to our cam whore, Misty. It's her birthday today.

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:12.160
We also had a weekend a few days ago. A weekend. A birthday. A few days ago.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:17.160
Ooh, I'm horrible with birthdays. Oh, Sharks Girl. Of course, Sharks Girl's birthday was a couple days ago.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.160
She got to go play with dolphins on her birthday.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.160
I know.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.160
That was very nice.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.160
They were so cute.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.160
I want to have her back on the show to talk about it. Cool.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.240
Alright, um, let's see, uh, Bamani News, before we get to the cage match, since Jamie decided

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.240
to delay the cage match here.

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.080
You were the one who decided, okay.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.680
I just like ruffling your feathers.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.080
Uh, Dance Mania EX8 is on the way out, of course Dance Mania being the series that a

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:46.600
lot of DDR songs come from, uh, Dance Mania EX8 is on the way, and it's gonna have some

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:56.040
lovely tracks on it, including, oh, hold on, I'll do the band, god, distract the show

01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:03.040
here so I can do a ban. We're banning somebody for being a stupid butt. Alright. Ah, thank

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.840
you, now I got that. What a waste of time. If you should blame anybody, you should blame

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.760
the butt head who came in the chat room. Why do you have to do that when I've got other

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.080
things going on, Mr. Spammerguy? Alright, anyway. Erotic, with Gotta Get It Groovin',

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:22.000
the remix of that is going to be on this CD. I'm trying to think of other DDR bands you

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Two Unlimited, Maximum Overdrive, the Horny Horns vocal radio edit.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Horny Horns.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Who's That Girl, doing a cover of Burnin' Up by Madonna.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Extreme with Upside Jump, Atomic Kittens, gonna do Ladies Night, which is actually...

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
With Curtis Mantronic.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Yeah, with Curtis Mantronic doing a remix.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Which is actually a previous Cage Match pick of ours, I believe.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I don't think that remix is, but I know that song was, because I picked it.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
I think it was.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Oh, what the hell is that song? Simply, or Strictly Business, I think.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Also, we've got, I saw there was another one on here I wanted to mention. Oh, Wildside.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
You know Wildside. They did Ears is the Woman and My Sweet Darling. They're going to have Superstar.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And I don't know if that has anything to do with any other versions of that song, but that's going to be on Dance Media EX8.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So look for that soon, and if you can't find it, that's alright.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It's going to be speedy.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
We'll play it on Orange Laundrio as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
You know who I miss? Actually, I miss the Olivia project.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I do too.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
All those lovely Olivia Newton-John, you know, remakes.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
It's cool stuff.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I know.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I'm sad.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Especially Xanadu.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
What makes me really sad is it almost seems irrelevant to be posting on Dance Mania albums anymore.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Because it's like, I doubt we're gonna see a new DDR, you know?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
It's just kinda like, it's sad. The whole thing's just sad.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
It's all home versions.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.480
Which kind of reminds me of an important question I want to ask on our Live Journal community

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.680
later this week.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:56.280
So if you're not a member of our Live Journal community, you should join at www.livejournal.com

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.740
and its username, OrangeLounge, is our username.

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:02.940
So for those of you guys that are on the Live Journal, you sometimes get to see secret little

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:06.840
posts and you get to be in the know on some things, and you get reminded every Tuesday

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.480
night to pump up the volume is on.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.480
Yeah, because...

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.480
Well, okay...

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:14.480
No, it's a great promotional tour, it really is, and people seem to like having reminders,

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.480
I usually post on there what the marathon is going to be in case you go, oh, that sucks.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.480
I usually don't want them to listen anyway.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.480
A little bit of a warning what's going to be played.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.480
Yeah. That's cool.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.480
No, it's a good way to keep tabs on what's going on.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.480
Sometimes there's a lot of things that, they're not quite appropriate to be posted on the front page of our site,

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:38.480
but they're things we want to kind of, uh, clue the fans in on, so.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.480
For a picture, rather than a compromising position.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:42.480
Oh, shut up.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:45.480
Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:55.480
Last week, in the Orange Mountain Studio cage match, Echo Image made its return to the cage match with a song called Come Back.

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:58.480
And it was Loki's pick for the cage match.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:04.480
And you know what though? It may be a tricky night tonight because Shane, I noticed, quit out of our chat room earlier in the show.

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:07.480
So he's not going to be here to persuade you all to vote for Echo Image.

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:10.480
So, could be competitive tonight.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.480
Could be.

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:15.440
of good songs tonight but will an old favorite or I should say a new old

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:19.800
favorite of the show will it win who knows tonight's song number one oh the

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:23.520
way the cage match works you get to hear three songs you get to hear a clip of

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.160
last week's winner and two new songs in their entirety the song that wins goes

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.720
into rotation all week long on Orange Laundry is the money music amor program

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:35.600
which plays 24 hours a day seven days a week when we are not all right

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.280
cool all right here's a clip of last week's winner echo image song number one

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:47.280
you can vote for tonight with Come Back.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:14.280
Fall back to me

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.280
I'm lying here waiting

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:22.280
I'm waiting face to see

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:28.280
My heart's searching into you

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:32.280
You hear me calling

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:38.280
Know the way I feel, the way I feel

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:42.280
To see me fall down

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:49.280
Realize what I feel, singing to you

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:53.280
Hear me talking

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:59.280
Know the way I feel, the way I feel

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:25.780
All right, song number one in the cage match with Echo Image with Come Back.

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.580
And you know, we're noticing that our chat room seems kind of dead tonight.

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:31.880
considering we don't have we have just as many listeners as we usually do but

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.000
our chat room seems a little bit dead I mean there's a few people that new show

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
that new drama that everyone's gonna be talking about on Monday about horny

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.600
housewife Oh God we can be started you know we're trying to think like seriously

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.960
that's what we think about like when when when the night seems kind of slow

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.360
or a little bit dead it's kind of like is there something else going on tonight

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:52.640
like where the Oscars on tonight huh I have a hard time believing they're all

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.640
sitting at home watching Desperate Housewives.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.640
They're watching Replays of the Debate.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.640
Alright, anyway.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.640
Moving on.

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.640
They're playing Silent Hill 4.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.640
Let's get on to song number 2 tonight in a cage match.

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.640
It is Jamie's pick. Jamie, tell us about your pick tonight.

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.640
I don't remember.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.640
I'll tell you.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.640
You decided to go with an old favorite too.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.640
You decided to use Loki's own tricks on him and you went with an old favorite.

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.640
You went with M-Flow.

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.640
Oh yeah, I just picked a random M-Flow song because I couldn't think of anything else.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.640
Alright, so here's the random Enflow song that Jamie decided on, it's called You Said.

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.640
Is this from their astro album?

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:30.640
No, it's from the... I don't remember the name of the album.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.640
Alright.

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:35.640
I think it's from the last one before the astromantic.

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.640
Alright, fair enough. Well here it is for you guys to give it a try.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.640
See if you like this one enough to give it your vote tonight.

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.640
It is Enflow with You Said.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.640
Jamie's picking my escape the match enjoy

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:40.140
She said that you would never let me go You said that you would be for everything

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:49.380
Unni, oe ga jiki da kute, juwa ki wo tote

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:54.220
Wijake le do wa wa naze ga

01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:57.820
Tame nai ogo e chan ano hikara

01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:03.260
Anata wa tote, yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:44.800
You will always be the ground You say that you will never let me go

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:49.020
You say that you will be my everything

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.020
Oh

01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.020
Oh

01:38:49.020 --> 01:39:12.980
And you will never let me go I say that you will be my everything

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:20.540
Alrighty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Emplo, with You Said.

01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:25.020
And now we will say what we thought of that song, starting with Jamie.

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.280
I like that song.

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:31.020
I was listening to some Emplo earlier today while I was doing my homework.

01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.940
And that song, I was just sort of like, huh.

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:39.500
So yeah, I give it an 8 overall, I mean, because it's good, it's solid, I mean, it just sort

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:47.000
I just stuck out my head today, and this is better than what I was going to pick, because I don't think that many of our listeners would be quite prepared for the wrong stuff.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
How the hell is what the listeners think?

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Okay, I'll hit lose as lucky as you please.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Bradley, what'd you think?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000
It was alright. I started liking it a little bit better as it went on though, so I'll give it a 7.5.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Uh, Logie?

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Lame. That's all I had to say. I liked the other song much better, Astro Sexy. This was not Astro Sexy, and I didn't like it, so it gets a 5.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.000
It kind of sounded like elevator music, but good elevator music. I mean, I would hope that they would play that in an elevator someday while I'm in it.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:29.000
It was okay. It was a little bit long, but it was a pretty good song. I listened to it, especially in an elevator. I give it a 7.5 as well, I think. I think I'm on the same page as Bradley.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.760
Alright, let's move on to song number three in tonight's cage match

01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:40.240
I picked it and it's by an artist called karma Club and I actually never heard of him until I just randomly download this song

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:46.320
On iTunes, but I was kind of like, huh? This kind of reminds me of like smile DK like but American so

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.840
Look, he says he hates it already. Well, you be the judge

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:56.840
This is a song called Lucky Star, and the group is Karma Club. Enjoy, it's my pick for tonight's game match.

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:33.840
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.840
Last night as I lay dreaming

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.840
This strangest kind of feeling

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:44.840
Revealed its secret meaning

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.840
And now I know

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:50.240
I've never ever been to paradise

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.840
I've never ever seen no angel sigh

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.840
No, never ever let this magic die

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.840
No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.840
Last night as I lay dreaming

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:23.840
This strange, just kind of feeling

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:26.840
Reveals its secret meaning

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:39.840
And now I know I've never ever been to paradise I've never ever seen no angel's eyes No never ever let this magic die

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:43.840
No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:36.840
I've never ever been to paradise No, never ever let this magic die

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:43.840
And now I know I've never ever been to paradise

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:50.840
I've never ever seen no angel sighs No, never ever let this magic die

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.840
No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:57.840
Where have I been to paradise?

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.840
I've never ever seen no angels die

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.840
No never ever let this magic die

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:09.840
No matter where you are, you are my lucky star

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:12.840
Na na na na na

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.840

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.840
Na na na na na

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:55.840
The song number three in tonight's cage match, that was Lucky Star by a band called Karma Club there.

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:58.840
Alright, let's go around and see what everybody thought of that song.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:01.840
Bradley, we'll start with you since Jamie's just returning.

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.840
Oh, you're back now. Okay, never mind.

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:06.840
Alright, Jamie. Alright, what did you think of that?

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.840
It was too happy.

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.840
Okay. I've heard it before.

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:13.840
Yeah, a lot of people in our chat room had heard it before, they said.

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:16.840
I think it was the first time I heard it today.

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.840
Ehh, seven.

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.840
I guess it's, yeah, something.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:21.840
It gets an S.

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:22.840
It gets a...

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:23.840
Alright.

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:24.840
Uh, Bradley?

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:27.840
It's a generic pop song over a dance beat.

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.840
Uh, 5.5.

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.840
Uh, Logie?

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.840
It's just like, no.

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.840
No.

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.840
No, it gets a one.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:36.840
No.

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.840
Oh god, I hope it wins.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.840
Extra bad now.

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:42.840
Alright, uh, I give it like a...

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.840
Like a nine, because it's happy.

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:50.840
And it's a total DDR song. It is a total DDR song. Can't deny that. It's a total DDR song. What?

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.840
I think we just need to admit it. Echo Image is gonna win again.

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:58.840
Well, we will find out. Let's review the three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:03.540
Tonight, we have song number one, last week's champion,

01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:04.860
Ego Emojis will come back.

01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:19.860
And song number two in tonight's cage match,

01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:22.220
M-Flow with You Said.

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:41.060
And song number three in tonight's cage match was Lucky Star by Karma Club.

01:47:52.220 --> 01:48:02.060
Alright, place vote now in our chat room. Send a private message to Sky with your vote

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:09.500
for either Mflow or Karma Club or Echo Image. Alright, so we'll be looking for your votes

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:17.340
there in our chat room. Meanwhile, oh my gosh iTunes just crashed my whole damn computer.

01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.280
I think we're, no we're okay, we're still up, we're still up and running but just iTunes

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:26.400
crashed, it was kind of scary. Alright, meanwhile, I noticed Loki's looking on a site about,

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:30.020
that has to do with some other Bomani news that came out this week. I guess there's this

01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:34.180
guy and he does a lot of music for other video games that I don't really play, but apparently

01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:38.540
a lot of you people know him and he's kind of popular. His name is Jesper Kidd, K-Y-D,

01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:43.460
right? And he does a lot of songs for other video games. Do you have a little clip of

01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:47.140
some Jesper Kidd songs here? Because Jesper Kidd has announced he's going to be doing

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:53.140
three songs for DR Ultramix 2, which is kind of nice. So, alright, we're trying to find

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:57.780
a little clip of a Jesper Kids song to play for you guys here. Let's see if we can get

01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:02.780
a little, just anything. Just play us anything so we can get a feel for what this guy sounds

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:14.780
like. Ooh. Well, maybe we'll get that industrial music you've been looking for, Jamie. He does

01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:20.780
He does stuff that's very similar to, like, Quake-type music, you know, very, that dark industrial-type stuff.

01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:25.780
This stuff right here is from, uh, Freedom Fighters, that game, that's the main theme.

01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:27.780
This is another one, Fight for Three.

01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:29.780
I want that, that's cool.

01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:42.180
Anyways, there's those. But what I was mentioning, or going to mention actually from his website

01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:48.260
here. Let me get to him again. I want to add real fast the three songs that he has announced

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:53.900
for Ultramix 2. Istanbul Cafe is one. Red Room is another song. And then this other

01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:59.520
interesting one 5 9 or 59 kid Konami mix and kind of the question now is is that

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:07.200
a remix of dot 5 9 question mark yes it is and how do you know this I can't say

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.440
but yes it is oh well I didn't I didn't even know one where the other you know

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.560
something I don't think is I don't know if this was a remix or not because a

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:21.960
certain person mentioned something about a I don't know point five nine remix

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:25.600
Alright, then I guess it is a 0.59 remix. I didn't know!

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:30.480
Well, hooray! We get a 0.59 remix by some random video game guy. That'll be fun.

01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.400
Alright. I didn't know.

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.360
Shit.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.080
Alright. Alright.

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:45.160
Uh, we will, uh, what are we gonna do? We gonna take a break? Are we gonna, uh,

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.400
talk about more Bobani news, or what? Let's break stuff.

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:54.400
Let's break stuff. Actually, you know what? We did have a request. Somebody wanted to hear that Jamelia song, Superstar.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.400
Yeah, somebody did.

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:56.400
Yeah, that was you, wasn't it?

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.400
Somebody sitting in this big green chair.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.400
That's what I thought. But I think the other folks thought it was a good idea as well, so...

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.400
We'll play that for you guys.

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:12.920
No, we're not going to play Say I've Never Done a New Story.

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:17.840
We're going to play, uh, uh, we're going to play, uh, where the hell is it?

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.840
Where is it?

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.840
Oh, here, it's in here.

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:23.840
Alright.

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.320
Uh, there it is.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.320
Let's do this.

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.320
Wow, this is great radio, you guys.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.320
Alright, we'll be back after this.

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.040
It's actually the full version, because I don't have a DDR edit, but if you're going

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:34.400
to be getting DDR Festival, you'll be playing this song, and if you're lucky enough to be

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:37.900
begin the DDR Europe mixes. You've probably already been playing the song. It's Jamelio

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:44.900
with Superstar, we'll have the cage match winner when we come back from this.

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:11.900
Why did I want a piece of paper?

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:15.900
Got a feeling I'll see you later

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.900
There's something about this that's keeping moving

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:23.900
And if it's good enough to get something cooking

01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:26.900
Then I really wanna rock with you

01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:32.900

01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:37.900

I don't know what it is that makes me feel crazy

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:31.900
I don't know who you are

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:36.900

I love that, that was nice.

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.640
Alright, we're back and it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:53.800
Match.

01:55:53.800 --> 01:56:01.480
And in tonight's cage match, boys and girls, it's a big surprise, a huge surprise, actually

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:06.840
first I want to say though, is that actually this is like the lowest participating cage

01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:10.520
thing we've had a long long time like probably since we started the segment so

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.560
only a few both saying I don't know what's going on people are like dead I

01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:17.360
think we've we've resorted to being that thing that's on in the background I

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:22.680
think it's what's happened to us yeah scary anyway um tonight we have a

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:28.160
surprise we have a tie in tonight's cage match believe it or not which means

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.680
someone's gonna be breaking the tie so let's find out what two songs the tie is

01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:43.800
between song number one is echo image

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:49.960
so that is a song number one that is tied in tonight's cage match and song

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:54.360
number two that is tied in tonight's cage match

01:56:54.360 --> 01:57:04.380
lucky star so a bunch of inflow haters that means yes unfortunately him flow

01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:07.860
not feeling loved tonight but somebody's better be feeling the love from Jamie

01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:10.780
pretty soon here Jamie's got to break the tie the orange

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:14.700
ons rules state that when there is a tie in the cage match the host who didn't

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:20.580
end up in the tie gets to break the tie and Jamie it depends who's gonna pay me

01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:28.500
I accept bribes you know I'll show you my boob that's okay I don't know Shane

01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:35.640
who should I pick I know what he's gonna say don't don't you want to get

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:41.160
something new in there for once aren't we a little thick echo image like you're

01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:46.880
saying we just don't like happy but look at it this way it'll lose next week for

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:57.040
for sure. See, if Echo Image wins again, then I can put in Ramstein and blow out everybody's

01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:08.800
speakers, and that would win. Do you really want Ram to win? Well, too bad, you won. Yeah,

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:15.040
reverse, alright, fine, and by a tie vote. I did it for Shane, okay? I did it because

01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:17.040
Shayne is my dunk fan.

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.040
Alright.

01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:19.040
He's my dunk buddy.

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:20.440
I was a good cliffhanger, Jayme.

01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.880
I applaud you for that one.

01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:23.880
That's because I'm awesome.

01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:25.880
Everybody wishes they were cool like me.

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:26.880
Alright.

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:29.040
Echo Image wins an Ice Cage match by Wapink.

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:32.400
Aww, that's so sweet.

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:38.120
You had their hearts racing for a minute there.

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:41.220
And you know what's going to happen the minute that that song gets bumped out of the cage

01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:44.560
match is that somebody's going to put in that never-ending story mix.

01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:49.300
love echo image for the rest of our lives I already know Loki's planning on

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:58.420
doing it liar all right more Bahmani news you know there's a couple other

01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:01.540
Bahmani games we've kind of they've kind of slipped under the cracks we haven't

01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:05.140
talked about them a whole lot but you know Tokyo game show happened this last

01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:08.660
week and it kind of you know we talked about DDR festival they had a new movie

01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:11.300
that showed there and it showed like the character customization and kind of

01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:15.300
showed us a little more what was going on with DDR Festival. Well, also, coming out

01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:22.540
was some more information on Pop'n Music and BeatMania 2DX, and apparently they had some

01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:27.980
folks that were actually kind of doing a performance there at Tokyo Game Show, and no, unfortunately,

01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:31.900
we don't have clips, but what I thought was interesting is that L.E.D. was actually at

01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:36.100
the show, which is kind of, I had heard these rumors, yeah, but I heard these rumors he

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:40.380
wasn't with Konami anymore, but here he is, showing up at Tokyo Game Show, helping promote,

01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:42.600
So I think he's back or something.

01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:49.180
And then they actually had VJ, TA-K was there, and Slake!

01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:53.440
And LED vs. Slake was performing, which kind of gives you a hint that, gee, I wonder if

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:57.820
there's going to be an 8th consumer style song like that.

01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:04.160
And let's see, there was a song called Human Scramble from the anime A Human Crossing.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:07.940
I guess it was something performed by Aki...

02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:16.580
Aki Asahina, let me see, gimme gimme gimme, I don't know, I'm so white, I'm sorry boys

02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:23.900
and girls, try that, Aki Asahina, Asahina, so I was kinda right, alright, and it's gonna

02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:28.620
be a song called, there's also a song called Dance With Me, Tell Me More, and Tell Me More

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:32.940
is gonna be on the 2DX8 style limited edition, so, ooh, that's right, cause I'm ordering

02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:39.420
that. Yeah, so, you know, that probably gives you an indication. There's a group called

02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:43.880
Guzzle that performed, and they did a song called The Bottom of Same Sky, and a song

02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:48.880
called Egoist, which is going to be in Poppin' Music 10. And the full version of Egoist is

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:54.540
going to show up on the Poppin' Music 10 limited edition. So, lots of fun news there for Poppin'

02:00:54.540 --> 02:01:01.760
Music 10 and 2DX8 style as well. And then Sana and Togo were there, and they performed

02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:07.400
a song called Custom Made Girl Not For Sale. Dude, that's awesome. That's the best song

02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:11.000
name ever. It sounds very much like a pop and music song, but we don't really know which

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:15.520
way it's going yet. And then a song called Everyday Lovely Day, which is going to be

02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.560
on the pop and music 10, consumer style. And then a remixed version by LED is going to

02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:27.880
be in 2DX8 style. So lots of new stuff coming out on these two soundtracks, pop and music

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:31.880
and 2DX8 styles as well as in the games that are coming out November 18th.

02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:32.880
We love LED.

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:33.880
Yes.

02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:35.880
We love LED and groovy.

02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:40.880
Why does this stuff all have to come out at the same time? That's the problem. I got no money. I'm po.

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:45.880
Because they want to get as much money from us as possible. They want to suck us dry.

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:46.880
I guess so.

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:50.880
They want all of our money to belong to Konami of Japan.

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:51.880
I guess so.

02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:53.880
It's a corporate plot.

02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:55.880
Conspiracy.

02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:01.640
Because, you know that K-Set's using all the money to build a giant robot?

02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:03.640
They're using it to build Metal Gear.

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:04.640
Hm.

02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:07.640
I don't know.

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:11.140
Right, okay. Alright, gotcha.

02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:13.640
Uh, trying to think of any other Bimani news.

02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:17.140
Actually, I'm going to go over to Loki, since we haven't heard from him in a little bit, and ask Loki.

02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:19.780
Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:21.780
Surely there must be something.

02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:24.080
I'm sure there is.

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:46.080
but I don't know what that is. Let me look. Now, other than TDR Maniacs being fucking slow as hell, let's see here. I think I mentioned last week that Alpha24 came out, not that anyone cares. Why they're up to Alpha24 is beyond me, but they are.

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:59.080
So, yeah. Other than that, there's a poll, I think, still going on for what characters should be ripped next, since the Fifth Mix characters are almost completely ripped for use with StepMania.

02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:12.080
Some themes are being worked on right now. The DDR9 Red, which is obviously a rip-off of 2DX Red's theme, and Transmokina 5, which a lot of people that are out there in the Sim world know about.

02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:19.580
Also, there's, of course, you know, Techno Fiends still being worked on. Really nice right now.

02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:22.280
But, you know, that's just basic theme stuff.

02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:33.580
DDR UK will have Ultramix Pack 6 and the DDR Extreme US tracks as soon as their downloads come back up.

02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:40.080
The Extreme tracks, I know, are almost done. Ultramix Pack 6 are done. They're just waiting to be uploaded.

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:59.080
So fire them!

02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:17.080
Fire the goddamn judges and set some deadlines next time! Seriously, I mean, sorry, but, you know.

02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:22.080
Well, they also had their server thing where they got a new server recently, so, you know, there was that.

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:27.080
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright. Fine, whatever, beggars can't be choosers, I guess.

02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:29.080
Yeah, we can.

02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:35.080
Any exciting remixes, though? Oh, you played some of them a couple weeks ago when I wasn't here, huh? Yeah, alright.

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.840
I'm just found out just just found out just now there's a good chance I'm not

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:46.160
gonna be here next week yeah something's going on you know about it what are you

02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:52.400
playing yeah way to go there's something going on I'll tell you off-air but you

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:57.640
actually already know about it you just probably forgot it was next Sunday yeah

02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:02.880
oh whoa now she makes old face oh yeah I'm probably not be here either so we'll

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:06.880
We'll probably have a pre-taped show next week for you guys, I think that's what we're going to have to do.

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:08.880
We need to go, like, to Golf Land and do a show again.

02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:10.880
That's why I kind of want to do a show from the ghetto.

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.880
That means going to Scandia.

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:14.880
I think that would be fun to do a show from the ghetto.

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:16.880
In the ghetto?

02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.880
We'll see.

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:22.880
I don't know, I thought that our last one we did at Golf Land was funny when they almost threw us out.

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:24.880
That was pretty funny. I would kind of...

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.880
We could go play the StepMania machine the next day.

02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.880
Until we said, but we're promoting you.

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:35.880
It's a good idea. We could go to Golf Land and play the new Step Media Machine, although I hear it kinda sucks, and that's not Loki's fault. It's just the fact that the computer inside sucks.

02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:46.880
Well, the only way it sucks is the fact that it has a default skin with no movies, but other than that, the pads do suck, and that's not my fault at all. That's their shit, you know?

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:52.880
I tried, hey, my original computer specifications worked very well with video and all that shit.

02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:58.880
It's just, you know what, when someone else does the job for you, it just doesn't quite come out how you wanted it.

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:04.880
You know, I just don't care because I wasn't going to spend any more time nor money on that.

02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:11.880
However, what has come to my attention, and I plan on doing this, I have to come up with $200 though,

02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:20.440
though, is, um, apparently, Channel Beat's having a sale. Uh oh. And you know what that

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:27.120
means? That means I get my parts for my cabinet. Those parts being my Dance Maniac sensors

02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:35.360
dropped from $50 a piece to now, or $59 a piece to $29 a piece. Awesome. So, arcade

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:40.700
perfect Dance Maniac sensors and all the other shit. I just have to figure out if I can use

02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:45.100
those sensors or not because I don't know if it connects to an Airface board and uh yeah.

02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:49.500
You can always make modifications for your face. I'm sure I could get to work even you know even

02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:55.740
if I just had to. Break out a ballpoint pen and some uh paper clips you know. But you know what

02:06:55.740 --> 02:07:00.780
I found out that's very interesting and it does tie in with StepMania. StepMania is license

02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:09.580
agreement basically. You can take StepMania modify it how you want as far as theme whatever

02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:12.940
put your own songs in it create your own

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:16.980
theme and you can sell it and you can make money off of it

02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:20.500
and all you have to do is just say powered by set mania or whatever

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:24.340
that got me thinking well wouldn't it be cool to make a new arcade game

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:27.460
hmm I don't know

02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:31.620
I want to make something like dance maniacs I want to at least do it for

02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:35.300
you know my cabinet itself the waving the hands game

02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:38.740
no I want to do something across like with dance maniacs and

02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:43.680
What was it? Is it like Technomotion? No, not necessarily like Technomotion.

02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:47.380
Dance Maniacs and Para Para,

02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:51.400
which basically would be, it would sort of be like Para Para, but it would have top

02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:54.060
and bottom sensors in a way. Make the country line dancing game.

02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:57.980
No, not country line dancing. That's retarded. What I want to do now is I want to have

02:07:57.980 --> 02:08:01.220
infrared sensors, because you can actually do some sensors where they have different trigger

02:08:01.220 --> 02:08:02.020
points, you know,

02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:06.540
below a certain level. So I basically have, like, you know, up to waist high or whatever.

02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:19.540
That'd be one set of five sensors, and then, um, above that'd be another set, but without those stupid, you know, actual, um, things in front of you, so you don't keep hitting them with your hand, and then have, you know, cool, like, technotran stuff to go with it.

02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:21.040
Do mocap dance.

02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:25.540
It'd be awesome, but, um, that's what I wanna do, at least, but, who knows?

02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:32.540
I, just have to say, cause I have, the only problem with the buy-off channel beat, you have to spend a $200 minimum.

02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:33.540
Ouch.

02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:54.540
So, you know, I can buy the Dance Maniac sensors. That's gonna be about, you know, say I buy three, or no, four of them. That's gonna be, you know, a good, you know, $120, and I still have $80 left that I have to spend on that, so I can maybe buy another sensor and some miscellaneous crap, and then, you know, maybe set up this weird dance thing or whatever.

02:08:55.540 --> 02:09:00.540
It's just, I don't know. I think it'd be cool, but, you know, what do I know?

02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:03.540
You could buy a turntable.

02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:34.020
turntable parts.

02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:36.900
Rip up an arcade-style controller?

02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:39.740
Not worth the $500 you'd have to spend mine.

02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:44.140
I'm still pissed off about my order, because I had everything. I had my

02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:47.180
friend living in Tokyo who was going to have

02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:50.460
my arcade controller delivered to her apartment.

02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:55.340
But no. They had to reject my credit card. Thank you, Konami.

02:09:55.340 --> 02:10:00.020
Yeah, it's just... I don't know. But...

02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:03.980
I don't know. We'll just see. I just need to finish my cabinet first.

02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:07.080
I need to stop taking on extra projects.

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:10.700
But I... See, the problem is right now... Focus. I have... Well, I'm focusing.

02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:14.340
Just my fucking iPad's broken. My old iPad 2 is broken,

02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:19.600
I think, because it's been flipping out weird when I hook up the, um,

02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:22.980
dance pads to it, and so I bought a new one that's coming.

02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:28.060
Uh, iPad, uh, what is it? Value Edition V, or something like that, which

02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:41.060
Oddly enough, it has more sensors than the iPad 2, and it's USB only, but that's coming this week, and so once I get that, then I'll be able to work on my cabinet again, because-

02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:45.060
I think that you need to open your gate to hell.

02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:50.060
I'm gonna do that later. I have to finish that too, but I need to get this stuff done.

02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:52.500
I want to get my cabinet stuff done because the weather is going to be turning for the

02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:56.820
worse and I won't be able to work on it during the winter because it's raining like a bitch

02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:58.500
and you know I have my wood.

02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:03.260
So what I want to do is I want to fucking sit down, get a friend to help me, and just

02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:08.420
chop up all that wood that I've got out there to like you know nice two foot by four foot

02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:12.660
sections so I can actually you know finish that.

02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:15.940
No we're not calling it low key motion because that's retarded.

02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:17.380
I liked it.

02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:18.860
That was cute.

02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:25.220
cute but it's retarded low-key motion low-key motion

02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:29.940
I saw my comment to Kylie

02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:32.740
anyway I'm done so

02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:36.740
well we can talk about you get pissed off yeah

02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:40.160
I I just wanna ask for a minute what the fuck is wrong with everybody tonight and

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:40.940
not you guys

02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:44.380
but I'm like God it's like is it something in the air is everybody on

02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:46.780
their period what is going on tonight

02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:50.280
Like, it's just like, we're, everything is dead tonight. It's like...

02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:51.280
It's because people...

02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:54.280
Are we being invaded by aliens? What is going on?

02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:55.280
Now...

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.280
Is our show old? Have we jumped the shark?

02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:02.780
We did not jump the shark, okay? If we were gonna jump the shark, it would have been when we let Loki sing.

02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:04.280
I agree.

02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:10.780
People need to wake up.

02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:13.280
Seriously.

02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:15.280
But I'm sleepy too, Rob.

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:16.280
I know.

02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:21.280
I'm not saying everybody's dead, but it's just like God. I mean, seriously, tonight's kind of like, deader than usual.

02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:24.280
We have people in our chatroom and we love and adore them.

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:29.280
I know. I know. I know just the thing to perk people up. I know just the thing.

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:30.280
I know just the thing.

02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:33.280
Who has not convinced the tax concert.

02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:35.280
Rob, first of all.

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.280
That made me feel better.

02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:41.280
I swear, you do the whole little schoolgirl...

02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:45.060
it's like a schoolgirl combined with dr. evil but you know

02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:48.480
it's very cute

02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:53.840
some people are saying they're trying to call us and they can't get through

02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:56.480
because I'm being a bitch and haven't opened the sky plane huh

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:00.360
yeah I turned off but I turned it back on just now so

02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:03.960
that's fine if somebody wants to call us and tell us that you know

02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:08.160
someone wants to pick up the pace a little bit call us or we'll play let them move

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:08.880
no we will not

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.160
No, I wouldn't even do that. I would do that if like nobody was...

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:16.440
I don't know, if I really wasn't getting something my way.

02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.680
Yeah, 1-900, hot.

02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:24.360
Alright. Oh yay, we're getting a call. See, that's how it works. Hi, you're on Ornson's Radio.

02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:27.760
Hello? Hello? Hi!

02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:34.480
I'm sorry, um, if I try to turn it down on the 365, it turns everything else down.

02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:43.480
So, see if I mute it, then it mutes you guys, so I suppose maybe I should just stop it?

02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:44.480
Can you hear us okay?

02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.480
Yeah, I can hear you guys now.

02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:47.480
Yay!

02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:48.480
Yeah, we can hear you fine.

02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:51.480
You're like one of the most clear callers we've ever had call the show.

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:58.480
Seriously, well I just got my headset a couple days ago, so I finally decided to call and say hello.

02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:00.480
Kudos to your internet connection, now tell us who you are.

02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:01.480
This is Rai-Chan.

02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:02.480
Hi Rai-Chan!

02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:03.480
Hi!

02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:06.700
a new caller we don't get a lot of girls calling the show

02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:10.400
so I'm glad the right check call we have we have misty and I think Irene called

02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:12.520
a few while back but you know we don't get a whole lot

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.440
in comparison so what's up right here not a whole lot I tried to call you guys

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.880
before just as you guys went to the break

02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:22.560
oh you were talking about DVR festival in quad mode and all that stuff

02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:25.600
yep what was on your mind me I'll just

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:30.160
the whole I'm one of those import only I don't have us versions at all

02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:35.660
Is there any reason for that? Is it just because you bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 first, and then...

02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:39.160
Two years ago, um, when my first boyfriend and I broke up.

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:39.660
Uh-huh.

02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:45.160
Um, I had him, he owed me money, so I bought a Japanese PS2 with what he owed me.

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:50.160
Hey, you know what? I inherited a third and fourth style out of a previous relationship, so...

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:52.660
Isn't that the best way to get new stuff?

02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:54.160
Of course!

02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:58.660
Most, most of, most of my DDRs actually do come from other people.

02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:05.660
My third mix I bought for myself, my fourth my mom bought for me in exchange for doing

02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:12.660
housework, fifth mix Jason bought for me, sixth mix my brother got me for Christmas,

02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:18.820
seventh I bought for myself just before a tournament, extreme my second boyfriend got

02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:19.820
for me.

02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:20.820
Wow!

02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:21.820
You know what?

02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:23.500
I want people to start buying me my bimani.

02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:24.740
Why do I have to buy it?

02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:27.740
Well, Loki did buy DDR Extreme, so there's that.

02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:31.740
Festival will be a gift from somebody too, whenever that finally comes.

02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:34.740
That's where you have the collection Derival Mine.

02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:40.740
Yeah, Rai-Chan actually has her collection posted. Is it public on the internet somewhere?

02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:43.740
It's in my LiveJournal user info.

02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:46.740
Do you want to say that on the air? I don't know.

02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:50.740
That doesn't matter to me. Actually, I'll post a link in the chatroom.

02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:52.740
Oh, there you go.

02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:53.740
Either way.

02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:56.740
and you can actually take a look at right chance momani collection is quite

02:15:56.740 --> 02:16:00.140
impressive her momani penis is quite large

02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:03.820
well I

02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:06.780
got rid of my pop music controller I sold it to angel

02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:12.300
however I still have seven which I'll give to Jason and then nine most likely I'll sell

02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:14.100
I'll buy it from you

02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:15.940
okay

02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:19.220
I have a pop music controller and a pop music

02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:22.660
yeah I sold my controller recently so I

02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:26.660
I still have 7 and 9 sitting around just because I didn't know anyone else to sell it to.

02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:28.660
I've borrowed that controller too, which is funny.

02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:33.660
If you want to sell any pop music you have that you want to sell, you've got to buy it right here, because I need pop music.

02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:34.660
Alright, cool.

02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:42.660
Wow, boy! Not only do you get people to buy your new stuff for you, but you get people to buy your old shit too, I mean, God!

02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:48.660
And Jason wants me to post the picture of him and I, which I'll go find the link to.

02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:50.660
Aww, he wants to be mushy.

02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:55.660
We have a picture of him and I both with our entire Bimani collections.

02:16:55.660 --> 02:16:57.660
Oh, that is so nauseatingly cute.

02:16:57.660 --> 02:16:59.660
What did you think of his chicken hat?

02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:03.660
What did you think of the chicken hat picture I took at E3?

02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:08.660
Well, you saw that I used that as one of my LiveJournal user pictures.

02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:10.660
I just had to bring that up because I love that picture.

02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:11.660
We were like, you have to wear the chicken hat.

02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:13.660
Hug the cow.

02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:15.660
It was great.

02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:17.660
Let's see.

02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:19.660
You need to come up and visit us next.

02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:22.660
Wait, did you and Jason actually meet through Bamani?

02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:25.660
Um, DDR Freak and LiveJournal pretty much.

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:30.660
Wow, that's kinda cool. Look at that, DDR Freak brings people together.

02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:33.660
It not only tears people apart, but it brings them together as well.

02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:34.660
There you go.

02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:37.660
You know, the internet is a good place to meet people.

02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:41.660
I think the internet gets a bad rap sometimes. It can't be a good place to meet people.

02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:42.660
I met Dan online.

02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:43.660
There you go.

02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:45.660
Through fandom.

02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:48.660
Uh, anything else you want to comment on, right, Chan?

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:52.260
I'm not really just calling to say hi since I finally have everything set up.

02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:55.660
Well hello and thank you for the call and enjoy DER Festival when it comes out.

02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:58.860
Let us know how it is since none of us are probably even going to bother to get it.

02:17:58.860 --> 02:18:00.260
You're going to have to be our reviewer.

02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:01.260
Okay.

02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:02.260
All right.

02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:03.260
All right.

02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:04.260
Thank you guys.

02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:05.260
All right.

02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:06.260
Take care.

02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:07.260
Bye.

02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:08.260
Bye.

02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:09.260
Thanks for the call.

02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:10.260
Oh, that was so nice.

02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:11.260
Yay.

02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:12.260
We got some comments in the chat room that she's clearer than we are.

02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:14.180
Her microphone's better than ours.

02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:16.260
We need to know what kind of microphone she's got.

02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:17.260
Seriously.

02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:20.180
Ryan Chen, you're going to have to send me an email.

02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:23.820
Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, if you ever want to send me an email, if you're a stalker

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:28.120
fan and want to send me an email, that's fine, Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a good place

02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:29.120
to go.

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.780
Okay, I guess we're going to close up the Skype line because I want to do a break because

02:18:33.780 --> 02:18:36.740
we've got to come back and we have to do the FUs of the week.

02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:37.740
That's our favorite part.

02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:39.060
I know, we've got to do them.

02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:44.660
So send your FUs in now and in this break we're going to hear some keyboard mania music.

02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:48.960
Yeah, I knew that would be the first word out of your mouth, Jamie.

02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:54.200
I love sensation. It's play sensation, so it's the first thing I have queued up for you.

02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:57.200
So here we go, a whole break of keyboard mania music. Enjoy, we'll be back.

02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:58.200
the

02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:02.200
the

02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:06.200
the

02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:10.200
the

02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:14.200
the

02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:18.200
the

02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:22.200
the

02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:46.800
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:47.800
We are back.

02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:50.000
What the hell are you laughing at over there?

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.920
Nothing is funny.

02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:56.240
I'm laughing at DJ Nostalgia's icon on DJ Remaniacs.

02:25:56.240 --> 02:25:58.200
It's this little stick figure trying to pick up a flower

02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:00.360
to give it to the female stick figure,

02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:01.520
but the flower keeps moving.

02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.480
So then he finally gets pissed off and kicks the flower,

02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:06.320
and it hits the chick in the head, and she runs off.

02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:08.680
Funny.

02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:10.440
Hilarious.

02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:12.600
That's all I have to say.

02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:14.360
All right, well, the theme of tonight

02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:17.560
has kind of been like being dead, I guess,

02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:19.620
because you guys have all been dead.

02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:24.620
So, we decided we're going to pick things up a little bit with some good old-fashioned FUs.

02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:28.620
Jamie, why do we have to do some good old-fashioned FUs anyway?

02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:33.620
We are full of angst and anger, and if we don't let it out, we'll explode and destroy half of the world.

02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:54.060
My first epi of the evening goes to the driver of this Volkswagen Passat that was in front

02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:55.060
of me.

02:26:55.060 --> 02:27:00.740
First of all, I normally give the thumbs up to good German engineering, but these are

02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:04.800
cars that are meant to be driven at 100 miles an hour on the Autobahn, not 25

02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:11.780
miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone. Another SU goes to me for drinking so

02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:17.920
much vodka last night and you know I will say whatever is on my mind while I

02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:25.880
am drunk and I got very flirty so SU to my lack of restraint while I'm

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:40.000
while I'm intoxicated. Another F.U. goes toward this particular bit of software that I've

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:46.080
acquired that requires a certain thing to make said software work. So now I can't use

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:52.200
it. A big, humongous, whopping F.U. goes to freakin' PaintShop Pro 8 for not letting

02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:59.480
me change the size of my brush because I want to go and do little fine detailed work and

02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:04.720
go edit out backgrounds and stuff so that I can have transparencies and a stupid brush

02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:06.920
will not let me change the damn size of it.

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:09.440
Photoshop is ass, okay?

02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:14.080
I do not like Photoshop, even though I'm going to have to take a class in it, but that means

02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:17.280
that I'm going to have to go back to using PaintShop Pro 7, except PaintShop Pro 8

02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:23.820
it has some really good filters in it but um and also if you to the potential

02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:28.100
class I have to take in Photoshop even though I don't care for Photoshop all

02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:31.560
that much except it does have also really nice filters and I like the way

02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:38.500
it does layers better but and if you goes toward another thing about Paint

02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:43.060
Shop Pro 8 for not letting me freaking rotate my text in a curve the way I want

02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:48.940
too. It's doing some weird vector thing that's really pissing me off. So that means that

02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:56.940
I have to do 10 sideshow posters for Halloween by hand. I have to ink them and then color

02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:03.340
them on the computer. At least I can do some neat stuff to it and make it look cool once

02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:07.700
I have drawn it and scanned it. And at least I don't have to do some heavy shading on it

02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:11.420
either. It's all primary colors, but it's just my hand's going to be falling off. And

02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:15.560
And I have other drawings I really, really want to work on too.

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:21.840
So as it stands, I'm just going to have to, I guess, find some time.

02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:25.120
At least I've done all the homework for one of my classes, but.

02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:32.080
Oh yeah, and another F.U. toward not having my Copic markers anymore, because I finally,

02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:35.240
three of my Copic markers dried out, and that means I have to go pay another twenty bucks

02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:38.920
to get another set, so.

02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:43.560
And also just an F.U. to the Color Copics for being so damn expensive anyway.

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:49.720
I mean, true, you're paying for quality and alcohol-based ink, but, ugh, so expensive.

02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:53.200
And I'm retracting an F.U. this week to Dell.

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:57.280
Whoa, is that a first, that you're retracting an F.U.?

02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:58.280
Oh, alright.

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:02.960
Because I was all pissed off because I didn't think Dell was sending my computer, my laptop.

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:08.600
And then I got the notice yesterday, they weren't going to ship my laptop until like

02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:10.020
mid-october

02:30:10.020 --> 02:30:12.380
my laptop shipped thursday

02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:14.780
so next week i will be here with my laptop well if

02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:15.740
if i'm here next week

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.360
i'll be here with my laptop

02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:20.640
yeah we're probably not gonna be here next week but yeah we have obligations

02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:21.540
but um...

02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:23.060
regardless

02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:25.840
i'm gonna have my laptop

02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:29.600
and that will make me a happy bunny

02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:31.040
happy happy bunny

02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:32.680
a one final f u

02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:35.100
to my happy bunny t-shirt

02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:38.380
and my happy bunny t-shirt had pink fuzzy fur on it

02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:41.460
And now he looks like he's got a goatee over his belly.

02:30:41.460 --> 02:30:43.940
It's cause it's like the bottom of his mouth

02:30:43.940 --> 02:30:45.540
is like by his belly.

02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:47.980
So he looks like he's just got

02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:49.540
bad chest hair.

02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:52.820
And like the rest of them is rub all raw.

02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:55.840
Another F you goes to Rob's cell phone.

02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:59.140
It should be on silent while we're on the show.

02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:02.300
Sorry. Yeah.

02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:05.060
And that's it. I'm spent.

02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:11.060
Let's move on to Loki and see what he's pissed off about this time.

02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:15.060
Well, first off I'm gonna be pissed off at my toe because I just

02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:16.860
squeezed it really hard in this big

02:31:16.860 --> 02:31:19.160
pussy clump thing

02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:20.780
I was, but

02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:24.880
I need to let it dry out because before, you know, with a band-aid it just stays wet.

02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:26.540
I don't have any gauze.

02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:30.380
So anyways, I squeezed this big clump of whatever out because it looked like it was

02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:33.980
pussying a little bit so I was like seeing how bad it was.

02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:38.980
But it wasn't that, it was like some of the gauze that was left over from the other thing I hadn't pulled out.

02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:44.980
It was in the hole where they pulled the nail out, and that didn't feel too good.

02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:48.980
But it feels better now that it's full of Neosporin.

02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:52.980
And the other side's doing the same thing, so I think I gotta squeeze a little harder there, but that's kinda gross.

02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.980
Anyways, um, so fuck you that, cause that sucks.

02:31:55.980 --> 02:32:00.980
Um, fuck you to stupid people yesterday, I swear to God, everyone was trying to kill me.

02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:07.980
And it's because the really shitty drivers out there driving too slow, not looking when they change lanes, and just, you know, blatantly trying to kill me.

02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:10.980
So fuck you because you failed, I'm still here.

02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:17.980
Fuck you to denios for sucking. I never realized how many cell phone case booths there could be in one place.

02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:28.980
I mean, I didn't really need a cell phone case, or a new faceplate because there's tons of those faceplate booths, nor did I need any used underwear, or samurai swords! I swear to God!

02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:34.580
to god this is places like we have power tools we have bungee cords and we have samurai swords

02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:41.460
where the hell did that fit in that's just weird hey i thought i bought some korean pop speed either

02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:47.380
okay that's cool but that was the only like cool thing that was there i walked around that it's

02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:52.900
just it's not the same anymore it's like we win it around two to three o'clock i mean that is not

02:32:52.900 --> 02:32:58.900
very early but it's not late in the day I mean and there was already half the

02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:02.560
people that already packed up and left in fact they were closing the fucking

02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:07.480
you know food vending booths down at three and they closed at five like what

02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:11.620
the fuck two hours early that's a little ridiculous but whatever so they were

02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:17.400
doing that and that was really lame and wasted my time but also fuck you to

02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:21.920
shark's tail because it was kind of lame but I went and saw it for free so that

02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:27.720
wasn't that lame but it just still sucked and I it was a waste of my time

02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:36.440
and finally just you know I don't really know I have a lot more stuff earlier this

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:41.160
week and I just cannot remember it for the life of me now fuck you to goddamn

02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:46.000
roundtable today okay now I bought a personal pizza and twist their twist are

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:49.700
fucking huge if I knew they're fucking huge I would just bought the twist but

02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:53.260
not only that they didn't cook them all the way through they were damn good so I

02:33:53.260 --> 02:34:02.580
ate them all but I had to take a very bad shit when I got home so at least it

02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:06.140
felt like it it wasn't it was just you know it's just you know one of those

02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:11.180
things like urgent emergency you know that's not a feeling I want to have

02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:15.340
after you know eating at round table cuz I love round table and I was it was

02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:18.140
ironic because I was telling a story about how I used to make twists out of

02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:22.460
large pizza skin that were like a good you know three feet long when you're done with

02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:29.260
them which is awesome but i don't know they're still good though but um except for that Nephew

02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:33.820
Comedy Central we're playing Dogma yet again my god i don't like need to see that movie anymore

02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:43.500
it's just at least you have cable trust me you're not missing anything and i'm done

02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:49.500
I'm trying out a new F.U. song tonight. I don't know how it'll work, but I want something new.

02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:53.500
You're not allowed to have anything you love.

02:34:54.500 --> 02:35:03.500
I would like to give an F.U. to that person I was already giving F.U.s to earlier who just made themselves look like an ass.

02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:10.500
I want to give an F.U. to myself for having a little bit too much to drink last night

02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:13.500
and kind of forcing myself to stay in Chico until really late.

02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:16.500
Although actually I had a really good time so I have absolutely nothing to be bitching about

02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:21.500
but I need to learn to say no to drinking a lot better.

02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.500
Because I'm going to get myself in trouble some time. What?

02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:25.500
Just say no.

02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:34.500
And then I want to give an F.U. to Unnecessary Drummer and people that get off on perpetuating other people's trauma.

02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:46.500
And I really, actually I think I had like a pretty good week, all things considered, to be honest, so I don't have like a whole bunch to give F.U.s to.

02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:51.500
Oh! F you to people that make fun of my name on Ultramix.

02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:54.500
Like, I freakin' join games on Ultramix and people are like,

02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:56.500
It's Green Ski!

02:35:56.500 --> 02:36:01.500
First of all, it's Green Sky, but since you don't know how to read, I'll forgive you.

02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:05.500
But, it's just like, you know, and then I go and kick your ass.

02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:10.500
And you're like, you know, you just tell me I'm on a controller or something, even though I'm not.

02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:12.500
I'm actually on a dance pad.

02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:19.460
And um, just in general, retards. Not actual people who are actually retarded, I mean there's

02:36:19.460 --> 02:36:23.300
nothing they can do about it, but I mean people who act retarded and they have no reason to

02:36:23.300 --> 02:36:31.980
be. Is it, is it F you related? Okay, Loki has something F you related. Fuck you in the

02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:37.220
bush because you look like an idiot during the debate, that's all.

02:36:37.220 --> 02:36:41.220
What's going on, Bradley?

02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:48.220
The only thing I really have to say is fuck you to have to go another month being frugal.

02:36:48.220 --> 02:36:54.220
Even with my pay raise, I gotta pay off bills and stuff, so I can't really do very much for next month.

02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:57.220
But, oh well. That's about it.

02:36:57.220 --> 02:37:04.220
Oh, that was quick. Fair enough. Let's go to the chat room and see what our chat room has to bitch about this time.

02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:09.500
Elle Mulletz wants to say an F you to the chat room for being so dead not my fault

02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:13.780
and F you to idiots who claim you're a company fanboy for liking their games

02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:15.340
and on behalf of DarkSakura

02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:18.940
an F you to Cosmo Magazine she knows why.

02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:23.740
Oh my god that's the one I forgot? I opened up Cosmo to read the crappy

02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:27.780
sex tips they put in there because they're hilarious because you know they're not realistic at all

02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:31.700
and like I'm assaulted by what's the name of this rainbow

02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:39.700
out of the ass or something, perfume. It's beyond paradise. And it smells like beyond

02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:50.380
Hades is what it smells like. Okay, thank you. Beyond the garbage dump. Beyond fecal

02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:57.620
matter or something, I don't know. Otaku Rat says, F you to working 11 hours on 3 hours

02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:01.720
sleep

02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:05.720
uh... jazz says f you to elderly drivers

02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:09.980
for the love of god stop driving ten miles an hour and speed limit also f

02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:13.300
you to the people who plaster their cars with political stickers as anyone

02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:15.580
notices people stuck out the driving day

02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:16.220
buddy

02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:20.700
i'd put a political sticker on my car this week so if you know

02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:25.140
kerry edwards sticker

02:38:25.140 --> 02:38:29.140
My mother put a Carrie Edward sticker on my car, actually, and she put it on crooked.

02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:32.140
You know what, neither of them are worthy of my vote. I'm voting for Phil Bikat again.

02:38:32.140 --> 02:38:38.140
Well, I don't want Bush to win, and I actually kind of like Carrie, especially after the debate, so we'll see the tech.

02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:45.140
Jazz says, one more thing, F you to a certain in-the-groove step-file creator for being such an elitist bastard.

02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:48.140
Hey, where did I hear that one earlier tonight?

02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:54.480
This says f you to all computer image editor programs for not having a way of making a decent spiral

02:38:55.580 --> 02:38:58.020
Fair enough any ideas on that. I

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:02.420
Don't I haven't ever had to make a spiral so

02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:10.900
Actually, yeah, you can do one in PaintShop Pro using the the twist like you do a straight line from the center

02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:15.340
And then do the twist warp and that should work you can save it as a paintbrush

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:16.340
What do you think?

02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:17.340
A drawing tip from Jeannie.

02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:24.760
Uhh VXJ's next V says F you to a lack of sleep and making me sleep through almost all the

02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:25.760
show.

02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:28.160
At least I woke up from my girlfriend's voice though.

02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:33.080
F you to the people who randomly bash other people they don't even know and probably do

02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:34.640
it only because they don't like me.

02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:35.640
But you know what?

02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:39.200
I can prevent his ability to connect to that IRC network.

02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:42.540
And I'm laughing too because I know exactly what he's talking about.

02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:47.140
And when this person gets banned from anywhere, it's good news.

02:39:47.140 --> 02:39:48.540
I just told Jamie what it was.

02:39:48.540 --> 02:39:50.540
I was doing sign language to Jamie.

02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:51.540
Oh!

02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:56.540
I have choice words that I'm not going to say because I've said them.

02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:58.540
She'll say them on commercial break, I'm sure.

02:39:58.540 --> 02:39:59.540
Yeah.

02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:00.540
Amen, Rai-chan.

02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:08.820
Also, oh yeah, he says, oh yeah, to expand on my first one, F you to sleep, making you

02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:09.820
not do anything.

02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:11.820
I need to go shopping.

02:40:11.820 --> 02:40:18.060
You don't know how many times I've needed to go shopping, and then I'm like, hmm, sleep.

02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:21.580
And then I don't end up shopping, and then I wonder why I'm hungry.

02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:25.660
DDR Angel says, F you to fellow students in the class that Magus and I are taking.

02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:29.620
I almost called him Magus.

02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:33.260
That was a total Tom Brokaw moment, I swear.

02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:36.260
Yeah, but Rob, there's a difference.

02:40:36.260 --> 02:40:39.940
Tom Brokaw gets paid a few million a year.

02:40:39.940 --> 02:40:42.700
and you don't get paid for the show.

02:40:42.700 --> 02:40:44.540
I know.

02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:46.620
F you to fellow students in the class that...

02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:49.780
I mean, I've been horribly bad on my speech tonight.

02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:51.380
I don't know how many things I've said,

02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:54.660
like where my mind was just in three different places

02:40:54.660 --> 02:40:56.460
and I ran them all together

02:40:56.460 --> 02:40:58.340
and just said things I didn't mean to say.

02:40:58.340 --> 02:40:59.180
Oh, God.

02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:03.980
Angel says F you to fellow students

02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:06.180
in the class that Magus and I are taking.

02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:07.220
You asked for our help.

02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:08.060
We gave it to you.

02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:10.020
It's not our fault you didn't get it.

02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:11.380
We never said you were stupid.

02:41:11.380 --> 02:41:15.940
Don't put words in our mouths to make us look bad when we are trying to be diligent students

02:41:15.940 --> 02:41:17.820
just like the rest of the class.

02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:18.820
Grrr.

02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:23.860
Okay, I feel better.

02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:26.900
For a pretty dead chat room, that was a very ranty evening of FUs.

02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:30.420
I kind of am surprised.

02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:32.060
They were storing it, Rob.

02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:33.060
Yes.

02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:37.900
Alright, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from break, since

02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:40.660
We got a few minutes left in the show and that's how we always buy ourselves some time

02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:42.300
is to do some Askorn's Lounge.

02:41:42.300 --> 02:41:43.300
Huh?

02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:44.300
No.

02:41:44.300 --> 02:41:47.180
No, we did El Molot's like first.

02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:49.300
No, that was CDR Angel who was last.

02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:50.300
Okay.

02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:51.300
Alright.

02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:53.300
We're gonna do a break.

02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:57.220
In this break, 2DX music, because I want to hear Love is Dreaminess.

02:41:57.220 --> 02:41:58.220
So we'll be back.

02:41:58.220 --> 02:42:00.380
Actually, we'll just, you know what, we'll just make it an LED break.

02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:01.380
Hell with it.

02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:02.380
We're gonna do LED music.

02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:04.380
We'll be back after this LED break.

02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:05.380
Enjoy.

02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:39.520
La la la la la la la la la la

02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:29.380
You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience, he has the whole Earth.

02:46:59.380 --> 02:47:26.380
Thanks for watching and see you next time!

02:47:29.380 --> 02:47:35.380
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:47:35.380 --> 02:47:37.380
Do we want to be staffed by Hollywood?

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:39.380
No!

02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:41.380
Do we care what people think of us?

02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:43.380
No!

02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:45.380
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:47.380
Yeah!

02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:54.380
Extreme Babani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:58.380
You know that promo is so old that DDR Extreme wasn't even out at that time.

02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:03.660
time. And then when it was announced that the name was DDR Extreme, I was kind of

02:48:03.660 --> 02:48:07.540
laughing at that promo because I called it like a long time ago. Extreme Radio.

02:48:07.540 --> 02:48:14.300
Extreme! All right. We're gonna do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge. Even

02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:18.060
though we've only got one freaking question so far, I guess we'll have a one

02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:22.780
question night then if that's the way you guys want to have it. Fine by me. I have a

02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:29.140
a question Rob okay should I start the music first or yeah all right

02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:38.700
let's ask orange lounge some stupid question what will we find out tonight

02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:45.140
on orange lounge radio that is if we even get any questions anyway because

02:48:45.140 --> 02:48:50.860
As even though people are listening, we already put them to sleep.

02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:57.940
Dear Orange Lounge, Why are we so cool?

02:48:57.940 --> 02:49:00.180
Well, because I'm here.

02:49:00.180 --> 02:49:02.660
Since the air conditioner is cranked up.

02:49:02.660 --> 02:49:05.340
Let's get to our first listener question.

02:49:05.340 --> 02:49:12.860
Jason, Mr. VXJ6V himself says, Does anyone remember seeing Katamari Damacy?

02:49:12.860 --> 02:49:26.860
I've read reports about it, but I didn't see it. I just beat the game yesterday, and it's one of the greatest I've ever played. Has anyone else played it? I've never heard of this game in my entire life.

02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:27.860
I've never heard of this game.

02:49:27.860 --> 02:49:28.860
What?

02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:29.860
I've never heard of that game.

02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:54.620
p0k3smot42o

02:49:54.620 --> 02:49:58.740
that's fun I will post a link to the official

02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:03.980
website here I don't remember this game at all is it a Japanese game or is this

02:50:03.980 --> 02:50:07.580
oh no looks like an English game it just I was released for like fifteen bucks at

02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:08.380
fries or

02:50:08.380 --> 02:50:12.140
really? something like that and then sold out and it's like really cool and everything

02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:16.740
huh I've never played it though how have I never heard of this game?

02:50:16.740 --> 02:50:20.860
weird that's kinda

02:50:20.860 --> 02:50:21.860
Well, it's Namco.

02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:22.860
Yeah, it is.

02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:24.860
Dude, anything by Namco is good.

02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:25.860
That's weird.

02:50:25.860 --> 02:50:26.860
Namco, back in the day...

02:50:26.860 --> 02:50:28.220
Why have I, like, never...

02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:29.580
I guess I'm just out of it.

02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:31.700
I'm not cool anymore is basically what it boils down to.

02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:32.700
Look at that!

02:50:32.700 --> 02:50:33.700
A giant ball of shit.

02:50:33.700 --> 02:50:34.700
Look at that.

02:50:34.700 --> 02:50:35.700
Wow.

02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:38.540
I would kill for a giant ball of shit.

02:50:38.540 --> 02:50:39.540
Let's get to more questions.

02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:40.540
I just would.

02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:41.540
I'd hit my left foot.

02:50:41.540 --> 02:50:42.540
Not shit, but stuff.

02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:43.540
Stuff, yeah.

02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:44.880
It's a giant ball of stuff.

02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:47.860
You wouldn't really want a ball of shit rolling over you.

02:50:47.860 --> 02:50:49.860
Yeah, it would kinda suck.

02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:54.260
everything must be they're calling it a sleeper hit it's a budget sleeper hit

02:50:54.260 --> 02:51:00.340
oh kind of like when incredible crisis was brack 2000 has a question and I

02:51:00.340 --> 02:51:04.860
don't know if I want to ask his question to be honest but I guess I will cuz I

02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:09.580
you know I do that brack 2000 wants to know where's the ferret at it's on the

02:51:09.580 --> 02:51:17.380
floor where should be need to stay there in the fireplace where he belongs I have

02:51:17.380 --> 02:51:19.380
I have a fireplace in my place.

02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:22.380
Listen to the retarded love.

02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:24.380
Angel has a question to all the hosts.

02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:26.380
Want me to make new promos?

02:51:26.380 --> 02:51:28.380
Hey, we'll take donations.

02:51:28.380 --> 02:51:31.380
What are we gonna say? No, don't give us free stuff.

02:51:31.380 --> 02:51:34.380
Don't do work for us. Please don't.

02:51:34.380 --> 02:51:36.380
Of course we want people to make money.

02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:38.380
Uh, Jamie. Question for Jamie.

02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:40.380
Shut that damn thing up.

02:51:40.380 --> 02:51:43.380
What do you think the best way to get my stamina up for DDR

02:51:43.380 --> 02:51:46.380
besides playing DDR itself? I want options.

02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:54.940
Is this Angel? Yeah. Um, start walking. Yeah, walking. Start walking. Do things that get your heart

02:51:54.940 --> 02:52:02.300
going. Um, the whole thing is that DDR is cardio and no matter how, you know, good you get your

02:52:02.300 --> 02:52:07.740
legs in shape, if you're breathing, if your lungs can't keep up with it, you know, you should go to

02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:12.940
spin with me, Angel. Get a membership at my gym and go to spin with me. That'll get your cardio

02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:16.420
built up. Yeah, I'm still debating getting a membership of that gym too. I guarantee

02:52:16.420 --> 02:52:21.960
you, but um, I want to be buff. If you can, if you can get to the track on Mondays

02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:25.720
and Wednesdays at seven o'clock, and actually I wanted to bring this up

02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:31.300
anyway, for anyone in the area who wants to work, work out, get in better shape,

02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:36.140
Anita, DD Archaholic and I are working on getting ready for the mud run at

02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:40.360
Mater Field next year, which is they have a five mile and a two mile obstacle

02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:45.260
horse and there is no way in hell I can run two miles okay I can barely run a

02:52:45.260 --> 02:52:50.680
quarter of the track but we're working on getting in shape to do the mud run

02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:54.880
next year and if you want to come work out with us you're welcome to do it and

02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:59.100
that would help build up your stamina because we're we're doing run walks on

02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:04.420
the track and running the stairs and doing sit-ups and push-ups and all kinds

02:53:04.420 --> 02:53:08.540
the stuff. You're starting a fitness club?

02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:13.060
Yeah, kinda. We were talking about doing the, doing something like

02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:16.340
orange lounge fitness. That's cute. We really were thinking about that.

02:53:16.340 --> 02:53:21.620
Meanwhile, I'm on the DDR diet. Rule number one

02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:25.300
of run club. No one talks about run club!

02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:31.580
Sorry. Moving on with Angel's question, there's also a question for Loki here. Is

02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:32.940
your new remix done?

02:53:32.940 --> 02:53:34.940
I didn't even know he was working on a new remix.

02:53:34.940 --> 02:53:39.940
Yeah, well, okay. What's the status of Loki remixes? Anything on the plate?

02:53:39.940 --> 02:53:41.940
I'll reword her question.

02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:46.940
I thought that was planned. There was stuff being done. This is news to me.

02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:52.940
Maybe she was asking, like I was thinking, have we renamed your last remix yet?

02:53:52.940 --> 02:53:55.940
Oh, yeah, I went with my name.

02:53:55.940 --> 02:53:57.940
Which was?

02:53:57.940 --> 02:53:59.940
What did I name that?

02:53:59.940 --> 02:54:19.940
Rob, am I allowed to use the controller when playing Ultra Mix against you because my converter is being buggy? Yeah, it's fine. You can play controller against me. But, here's the thing. Don't fucking go picking like, can't stop falling in love speed mix, followed by paranoid rebirth and then eternal, and then fucking like every nine footer in the game back to back.

02:54:19.940 --> 02:54:23.540
here's the thing don't fucking go picking like can't stop falling in love

02:54:23.540 --> 02:54:27.460
speed mix followed by paranoid rebirth and then eternal

02:54:27.460 --> 02:54:30.420
and then fucking like every nine footer in the game back to back because

02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:33.860
remember i'm on a dance pad you're gonna be playing fucking

02:54:33.860 --> 02:54:38.020
santa maletti light no i'm kidding but you know just within reason as long as

02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:39.780
the songs are within reason i don't really care

02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:43.060
as long as we're just playing half by if i'm playing against somebody for fun

02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:45.860
then yeah we can you know use whatever you want maybe i'll play on the

02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:48.020
controller let's just keep playing against each

02:54:48.020 --> 02:54:50.540
other on the controller like a bunch and then rack up a bunch of points that

02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:54.500
would actually be fun. I actually have an idea how we're gonna get ourselves in

02:54:54.500 --> 02:55:00.940
the top hundred. Ah damn. No I don't want to cheat anyway. I want to do it honestly.

02:55:00.940 --> 02:55:07.180
We'll do it honestly. Hee hee hee. L Mullet says if any of you had to pick an old

02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:12.300
school video game characters your favorite of all time, who would you pick?

02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:21.300
Or what? Your favorite old-school video game character is your favorite of all time.

02:55:22.300 --> 02:55:29.300
The chick from The Guardian Legend. Actually, Richter Belmont from Dracula X.

02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:38.300
Just because he walks around with his Ryu haircut and his headband with a whip being all badass vampire hunter. That's kind of cool.

02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:47.540
cool. That's kind of hot. Um, I would have to say either the Dark Queen from Battletoads

02:55:47.540 --> 02:55:58.620
or Chun-Li. Super Joe. Super Joe. Bionic Commando. Dude, that's cool. Because you blow up Hitler

02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:08.240
at the end of that game, only it's not Hitler. Or, um, like, a random Mega Man 2 boss, because

02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:14.400
the Mega Man bosses are cool. You would so be, uh, Quick Man. There is no Rainbow Man,

02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:22.020
go to hell. Alright, uh, Misty. I wanna know what the hell happened to Episode 111, did

02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:27.260
you delete it or something? I've been looking forward to hearing it on Rewind Pout. No,

02:56:27.260 --> 02:56:29.060
That's 1-12 that never got recorded.

02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:36.660
Actually 1-12 is gone, but there was a small mistake that happened this week where something

02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:41.060
got updated and didn't get saved, which caused you to hear the same episode for the third

02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:42.060
week in a row.

02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:43.940
And I apologize for that.

02:56:43.940 --> 02:56:44.940
But you know what?

02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:46.940
We have a suggestion for you in the chatroom.

02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:47.940
What?

02:56:47.940 --> 02:56:48.940
God damn.

02:56:48.940 --> 02:56:54.820
Ride2000 said you should be hard man.

02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:55.820
Every day.

02:56:55.820 --> 02:57:02.820
no episode 111 exist and in fact to prove it I will play a random moment

02:57:03.460 --> 02:57:06.940
from episode 111 here's a random moment from episode 111

02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:11.940
I'll bash bin Laden. God damn Bush family for giving bin Laden by

02:57:11.940 --> 02:57:16.220
President Bush to be killed his entire family if it wasn't for them Osama wouldn't live

02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:19.100
Wow wonderful a dark child moment just what I wanted

02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:22.620
that had nothing to do with video games at all

02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:27.060
What the hell is wrong with our show?

02:57:27.060 --> 02:57:33.720
We need the random episode clip button, just like Conan has the random clips of walker

02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:35.120
texas ranger.

02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:40.800
We need to have, we need to do that, I think that would be awesome.

02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:45.260
I'm not going through old episodes, alright fine, here's another random clip of episode

02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:46.260
111.

02:57:46.260 --> 02:57:52.080
other stuff I was kind of surprised one vote over echo image and one vote oh or

02:57:52.080 --> 02:57:56.940
I'm sorry two votes over DMS sure it was a very what the hell was I know what the

02:57:56.940 --> 02:58:01.220
hell was I talking about to noon Thursday to find out and we know it's a

02:58:01.220 --> 02:58:13.620
cage mansion all right so the episode exists I just suck all right and that's

02:58:13.620 --> 02:58:16.300
That's it, that's all the questions we got, and that's fine because it's time to wrap

02:58:16.300 --> 02:58:17.300
up the show.

02:58:17.300 --> 02:58:24.820
So we're gonna close the old, uh, Orange Lounge radio mail bag.

02:58:24.820 --> 02:58:25.820
And that was us closing the bag.

02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:27.220
Oh, did we ever check the email?

02:58:27.220 --> 02:58:28.820
The old school Yahoo email?

02:58:28.820 --> 02:58:40.540
Uh, I check it, I check it once in a great while, but I'll open it up right now.

02:58:40.540 --> 02:58:42.380
Like an F-you for something Loki said.

02:58:42.380 --> 02:58:46.060
uh... let's see what messages we got we said uh... good news weight loss

02:58:46.060 --> 02:58:48.600
fourteen-percent reduction of fat

02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:49.500
bigger cock

02:58:49.500 --> 02:58:53.700
uh... something makes me cry when i am moved

02:58:53.700 --> 02:58:57.820
and uh... another one of his happy face my sister used to tell me life is full

02:58:57.820 --> 02:58:59.060
of happiness

02:58:59.060 --> 02:59:00.500
uh...

02:59:00.500 --> 02:59:02.780
nothing in the god damn you know

02:59:02.780 --> 02:59:05.020
you didn't even get a penis enlargement now?

02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:08.980
i want to know if something makes me cry when i moved

02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:11.840
an answer worthy of your acceptance

02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:15.220
I guess it's a...

02:59:15.220 --> 02:59:18.860
Look at this! They have to put all these dashes in here and stuff so the spam filters

02:59:18.860 --> 02:59:19.420
don't get it.

02:59:19.420 --> 02:59:23.220
Why do you people bother? That's what I want to know.

02:59:23.220 --> 02:59:27.300
Of course, since I clicked it, they'll probably send me a million emails now.

02:59:27.300 --> 02:59:30.340
I was reading some web comic, Rob.

02:59:30.340 --> 02:59:33.400
I don't remember which one it was, the someone accepting spam mail because they

02:59:33.400 --> 02:59:35.460
hate the world

02:59:35.460 --> 02:59:38.300
and want more to come.

02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:41.460
That was completely random.

02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:42.740
I'm gonna go check my laundry.

02:59:42.740 --> 02:59:46.140
Alright, sounds good actually. Well, we're gonna wrap up the show. Come back, come back, come back.

02:59:46.140 --> 02:59:50.340
Because you have to give us your final thought.

02:59:50.340 --> 02:59:52.640
Do it. Final thought.

02:59:52.640 --> 02:59:56.660
But you can't hear my thoughts.

02:59:56.660 --> 02:59:58.980
None of you are psycho and have ESPN.

02:59:58.980 --> 03:00:04.380
Then just tell them to tune in Tuesday since we didn't do the vlogs. Yes, I do a radio show on Tuesday.

03:00:04.380 --> 03:00:05.860
I never do that.

03:00:05.860 --> 03:00:10.900
Rob. Rob. What? Rob. What? Rob. What? Rob.

03:00:10.900 --> 03:00:22.300
I do pump up the volume on Tuesday night if you tune in at 7 o'clock, sometimes a little

03:00:22.300 --> 03:00:24.740
bit earlier.

03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:28.060
You can listen to the pre-show, 7.30 starts the real show.

03:00:28.060 --> 03:00:32.520
It's supposed to be a request show, but that doesn't really happen all that much anymore.

03:00:32.520 --> 03:00:34.380
People sometimes make requests.

03:00:34.380 --> 03:00:39.020
So I said I'd choose to marathon things, and the marathon for this week will be Rammstein.

03:00:39.020 --> 03:00:45.640
And then I'm probably going to throw in old video game music because I feel like it.

03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:46.640
So tune in.

03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:51.200
If I get bored again like I did last week, I'll go until midnight because I played Eddie

03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:54.400
Izzard and a bunch of other stuff afterwards.

03:00:54.400 --> 03:01:01.600
No, last week actually was the 80s marathon, which I actually do those every couple months.

03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:03.680
Be thinking of what you want to listen to though.

03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:05.160
I'll play whatever.

03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:14.160
If you are part of our LiveJournal community, the Orange Lounge LiveJournal, you can also put in there things that you'd like to hear on the show.

03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:20.160
Alright. Let's see. Loki, your final thought.

03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:27.160
My final thought was, I was thinking of weird things to make remixes of earlier today.

03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:34.160
One of the things I downloaded, which I gotta mess around with because I think it'd be funny, is to make a dance remix of the Shaft theme.

03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:38.000
Dude, that'd be... I don't know if that would work, but it's just something to play with.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:42.840
I was just downloading random white label remixes and stuff, and that was just kind of fun.

03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:46.720
Just because I was waiting for my, um, Simple Minds

03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:51.080
Don't You Forget About Me remixes to download.

03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:54.880
Do you ever use your record player anymore?

03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:59.080
No, but oddly enough I still buy records. I got you a record. I got you...

03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:02.080
What was that group? Guitar... Wolf.

03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:06.000
guitar wolf yeah I have a bunch of records I need to go through my big

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:11.160
pile of mid 90s R&B and I need to figure out what I want to keep and what I want

03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:14.440
to get rid of because I'm trying to like take that big pile I have it just

03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:18.560
sitting there probably getting warped because you know I have stuff on top of

03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:23.460
the records and I need to like throw a ton of shit away I have one record now

03:02:23.460 --> 03:02:27.680
one left all my other ones are in Alabama but I Dan and I actually bought

03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:33.600
weirdos even worse on vinyl well I need to like just because there's a lot of

03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:36.920
records out there I need to figure out how to mix on vinyl and once I do that

03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:41.240
then I'll be before it probably more opted to play with the records and stuff

03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:45.120
it's just it's hard because I don't know my record selection very well that's why

03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:49.940
I need to like lower it so I you know I can you know know what songs mix well

03:02:49.940 --> 03:02:54.240
together I'll make you a database it's just it's hard I don't even know how I

03:02:54.240 --> 03:03:14.240
I just need to learn how to mix. That's pretty much what I need to do. I can do parties where you just crossfade shit over. That's a piece of cake. But it's a matter of being an actual true DJ and being able to beat match and stuff and mix that way. That's a little different than being a wedding DJ where you just play 80s shit and crossfade over.

03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:19.240
Oh my god, this is the sequel to the wedding singers, the wedding DJ.

03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:24.240
Like, seriously, I could DJ, like, really shitty, like, adult parties and stuff, you know?

03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:30.240
But, like, you know, I can't really, you know, actually be able to do, you know, cool professional DJ stuff.

03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:33.240
Like, and mix shit together.

03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:36.240
Right now I have a program that helps me with that, you know?

03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:42.240
Because I can do it visually, but I can't do it audio. So, that's a problem.

03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:44.240
Anyways.

03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:46.240
That's my final thought.

03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:48.240
Bradley, you have a final thought?

03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:54.240
Since I don't have very much to say, I'll just read random words from the posters on the wall.

03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:57.240
Redundant, nicer, yummy, pin-up, action.

03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:03.240
Very nice. And my final thought is, I'm trying to keep this short because I have somewhere else to be right now.

03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:07.240
So, thank you very much for listening, everybody. Have a great night. Final word of the show.

03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:09.240
Jamie, you always want it, so there you go.

03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:13.240
My final word of the show is Vodka.

03:04:13.240 --> 03:04:19.240
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:05:02.240 --> 03:05:10.240
Do we ever do to these guys That made them so vile of you?

03:05:12.240 --> 03:05:22.240
Ooh, but you know I'm yours Ooh, and I know you're mine

03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:50.240
I don't care what they say about us anyway, I don't care about us anymore.

03:05:50.240 --> 03:05:58.240
I don't care about that.

03:05:58.240 --> 03:06:17.240
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:06:28.240 --> 03:06:56.640
Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, in progress.

03:06:56.640 --> 03:07:01.640
I'm trying to queue up a post-show, so I'm gonna give the mic to Loki and give him the responsibility of filling up a post-show.

03:07:02.640 --> 03:07:05.640
Filling up a post-show? God dammit.

03:07:07.640 --> 03:07:09.640
Well, shit.

03:07:10.640 --> 03:07:14.640
Well, what I've been doing lately is I've been downloading some music.

03:07:15.640 --> 03:07:18.640
I did buy stuff. I bought music.

03:07:19.640 --> 03:07:23.640
Anyways, this is one of the songs that I bought the other day.

03:07:23.640 --> 03:07:33.640
Um, which is from BT. So we're just gonna kill time by playing a BT song because it'll be fun, and everybody loves BT. BT rocks.

03:07:33.640 --> 03:07:40.640
And um, so this one right here will be a possible cage match winner, um, a little later.

03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:47.640
But anyways, this is right here, Loving You More, the seven inch edit. For those who don't know that's just like short radio edits.

03:07:47.640 --> 03:07:58.640
But here's Lovin' You More, BT starring Vincent, uh, Vincent, uh, Covello. Enjoy! A little bit different from BT.

03:07:58.640 --> 03:08:02.640
Oh, actually, no, screw that. We're not playing that one. No. Better.

03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:10.640
We're gonna do the Crystal Method, Keep Hope Alive, BT's Create A Tin Method mix, and we're gonna play a little bit of that because that's seven minutes long and we don't need to play the whole thing.

03:08:10.640 --> 03:08:12.640
So...

03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:13.640
Going home, going home

03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:38.640
Let us stop the dead men's hope Let us stop the dead men's hope

03:11:08.640 --> 03:11:38.120

03:12:24.040 --> 03:12:27.760

and that's going to be very cool and yes Loki and soon or maybe a little later on

03:12:50.520 --> 03:12:56.120
we will be doing more contests and more giveaways the prize being anime movies

03:12:56.120 --> 03:13:00.800
why because I'm to have like fucking 10 plus cases of anime movies in my closet

03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:05.040
that you need to get rid of. And that's a lot of anime. And I have, like, another two

03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:13.640
cases at work. So, um, there'll be, uh, anime giveaways. Ah! She washed the book in matches.

03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:19.440
But, yeah, that'll be, uh, we'll figure out some stuff with that later. Maybe, uh, I don't

03:13:19.440 --> 03:13:25.560
know, we'll figure stuff out. So, yeah, too bad I don't have any more porn to give away.

03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:26.560
That I don't have.

03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:31.560
Remember your Make Edit Get Porn contest? That was like the best thing ever.

03:13:56.560 --> 03:14:00.920
uh... but make it a good point that was a contest that was wonderful uh...

03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:02.580
what do you something similar like that

03:14:02.580 --> 03:14:04.520

do that in the future

03:14:55.060 --> 03:14:57.380
I don't want to work on this.

03:14:57.380 --> 03:15:00.020
That would be interesting.

03:15:00.020 --> 03:15:03.260
Make remix, get porn.

03:15:03.260 --> 03:15:10.000

03:15:56.480 --> 03:15:59.480
And wake up my passion

There's no dark clouds in the world now

03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:17.480
There's no dark clouds, only sunshine

03:16:17.480 --> 03:16:20.600
And we know that it's not over forever
