[SPEAKER_22]: What?

24
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,871
[SPEAKER_22]: The mic doesn't pick you up for some reason.

25
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:18,971
Ah!

26
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:21,132

[SPEAKER_22]: Good!

29
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,677
[SPEAKER_22]: You looked really pooped earlier today.

30
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:33,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Good, and I'm still tired, and I still got some of the crap to do, but... I feel exhausted right now.

31
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Given what you were doing earlier, though, I wouldn't blame you.

32
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,589
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, maybe we'll share that with our listeners a little later.

33
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,969
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, wait.

34
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:41,610

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,891

00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,092

38
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:57,732
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, but first, it's very, very sparkling water.

39
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:58,853
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think you like this stuff.

40
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:00,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I don't drink soda.

41
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:04,439
[SPEAKER_22]: I drink Crystal Geyser sparkling mineral water.

42
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Why?

43
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I like to feign this diet I'm on.

44
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:10,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, also joining us as always,

45

47
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:20,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Something in my throat there.

48
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, hi.

49
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Get the dick out of your mouth.

50
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,426
[SPEAKER_22]: It's time to start the show.

51
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:30,708
[SPEAKER_22]: I like gummy bears.

52
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:32,009
[SPEAKER_20]: That makes me sad.

53
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,292
[SPEAKER_21]: Also joining us tonight, we have a couple of special guests.

54
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,808
[SPEAKER_21]: They like to come to this show quite often here.

55
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:41,828

[SPEAKER_15]: I'm starting to become a regular.

60
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:49,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Be afraid.

61
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't you have anything else to do on Sunday night?

62
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:57,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't you have villages to burn and convenience stores to rob?

63
00:05:57,593 --> 00:05:59,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm an angel.

64
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:00,713

00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:22,119
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a car this week, right?

[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

74
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,160
[SPEAKER_22]: I think your mic might be cut out.

75
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,740
[SPEAKER_22]: Grab the bottom.

76
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:34,601
[SPEAKER_22]: Why am I not hearing it?

77
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:36,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, hello then.

78
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:37,945
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, hello, hello.

79
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:40,086
[SPEAKER_29]: That was weird.

80
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:41,226
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I have a car now.

81
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:42,847
[SPEAKER_29]: Very strange.

82
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:45,348
[SPEAKER_29]: And we'll get to tell the whole story after the break.

83
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,628
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, sounds good.

84
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,249
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit of Imani news.

85
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,891
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody made an oopsie and we figured out one new Ultramix 2 song.

86

[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll be sharing that with you guys tonight.

87
00:06:55,972 --> 00:07:01,114

88
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:04,595
[SPEAKER_22]: But first, we're going to do a little bit of a break.

89
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,236
[SPEAKER_21]: And what kind of music should we do in this break?

90
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:13,280
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like doing some 5K Beatmania stuff.

91
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,341
[SPEAKER_20]: So let's start off with this.

92

119
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:37,952
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll start by opening up the file on Jamie.

120
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:41,294
[SPEAKER_16]: My week was all busy crap.

121
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:43,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Busy, busy, busy crap.

122
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:44,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Lots of stress.

123
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:45,616
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah.

124
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:47,843
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty much my week.

125
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:49,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry.

126
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,365
[SPEAKER_18]: No specifics you want to give?

00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:52,346
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

128
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:53,446
[SPEAKER_16]: It was busy.

129
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:55,467
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's going to be even busier next week.

130
00:13:56,287 --> 00:14:06,432
[SPEAKER_16]: And, let's see, Tuesday when I came home, the business that was going to cause me to cancel the show didn't happen.

131
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:07,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no.

132
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:08,393
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was all stressing out.

133
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know about that.

134
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:10,014
[SPEAKER_16]: You told me.

135
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:11,495
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right.

136
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:11,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was something else.

138
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:20,498
[SPEAKER_18]: See, I have so many things going on right now that I'm just... It's like spaghetti.

139
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:33,261
[SPEAKER_16]: At any rate, I just said fuck it that night and had dinner with Dan and had a nice time and relaxed, but I'm still stressed as hell, and it's going to be that way until after Halloween.

140
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:35,782
[SPEAKER_21]: It's exactly how I feel.

141
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:36,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

142
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:40,172
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well, I guess that does it for Jamie's week.

143
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:42,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's talk to Loki.

144
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:43,794
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to talk to us about your week?

145
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:51,137
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I didn't really do a whole lot of stuff.

146
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:52,218
[SPEAKER_19]: What did I do this week?

147
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:54,859
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, I played Leisure Suit Larry all week.

148
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,480
[SPEAKER_19]: That's pretty much what I did.

149
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:03,163
[SPEAKER_19]: And other than that, I played a little bit of Final Fantasy this weekend.

150
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:06,785
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, what else did I do?

151
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:10,278
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, just kind of hung out.

152
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Just trying to stay out of the weather.

153
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,183
[SPEAKER_19]: And, yeah, that's pretty much all that happened.

154
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:23,064
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and I bought an Airzooka yesterday because I was at the mall.

155
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:24,505
[SPEAKER_19]: I had money.

156
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,626
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't want to buy a game because I'm just going to rent it.

157
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:34,229
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, you know, I couldn't leave empty-handed, so I got an Airzooka instead.

158
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Virgin didn't have any echo image.

159
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, why was I even looking?

160
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:40,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Because...

161
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:41,194
[SPEAKER_19]: What?!

162
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,437
[SPEAKER_21]: Explain what an airzooka is for those listeners that don't know.

163
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,460
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a giant thing that shoots a ring of air at you.

164
00:15:50,041 --> 00:16:00,669
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like a giant, um... I don't know, it looks like a giant tube with a big elastic thing at the end and you pull it back and it creates like... You know how if you were to blow smoke rings?

165
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,890
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it does the same thing.

166
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,133
[SPEAKER_19]: It creates like a shockwave of air that goes up through about ten feet.

167
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:11,417
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's supposed to be harmless, and you can, like, shoot at it, animals and stuff, and all that fun stuff.

168
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,918
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what an Arizuka is.

169
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:18,239
[SPEAKER_19]: It's this giant thing that I wasted a lot of, well, not a lot of money, but I wasted money on.

170
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:25,421
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, yeah, that's pretty much all that's been going down this week.

171
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,481
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been pretty boring.

172
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty boring.

173
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:30,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

174
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:32,382
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

175
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,723
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, I already talked about my trip, though, didn't I?

176
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:35,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think I did.

177
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:41,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and I saw The Grudge.

178
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:42,735
[SPEAKER_19]: That was cool.

179
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:47,677
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'll talk about The Grudge in a little bit, because I saw it too.

180
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:53,159
[SPEAKER_21]: But first, we'll talk to Arcadian, Bradley, and talk to him about his week, because I know he had a fun week.

181
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:54,740
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh yes, I did.

182
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,261
[SPEAKER_29]: And it started off really, really fucking shitty.

183
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:02,203
[SPEAKER_29]: About two miles from leaving this apartment last week,

184
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:06,812
[SPEAKER_29]: The fucking Folsom Police Department stops me, goddamn motherfuckers.

185
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,472
[SPEAKER_21]: After leaving this show.

186
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:11,032
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, right after leaving the show.

187
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:20,674
[SPEAKER_29]: Two miles away, a fucking guy pulls me over and says, Oh, your registration's out of date, so it's over six months, so we gotta tow it.

188
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,414
[SPEAKER_29]: Fuck you.

189
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:23,214
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't!

190
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:24,895
[SPEAKER_29]: It really fucking sucks.

191
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:32,096
[SPEAKER_29]: At least he didn't get me for speeding, because it was right at a fucking place where it goes from 50 to 40, and he could have busted me for that, but he didn't.

192
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:35,849
[SPEAKER_29]: and so he went away and said, do you have money?

193
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:36,689
[SPEAKER_29]: I said, yeah, I do.

194
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:38,849
[SPEAKER_29]: I went down to the thing and called Rob.

195
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,990
[SPEAKER_29]: And so he came and picked me up and took me home.

196
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,490
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Rob.

197
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:48,311
[SPEAKER_21]: No problem, because I was dropping off Angel anyway, so we're done.

198
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:55,093
[SPEAKER_19]: So sure, they can pull you over for fucking expired registration, but they never catch anybody that runs a fucking red light.

199
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,078
[SPEAKER_19]: makes a goddamn left turn when there's a right turn only lane and fucking just blatantly drives like assholes.

200
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:03,780
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they just...

201
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,332
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw two people, and Rob actually passed me when I was stopped

202
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,763
[SPEAKER_19]: And it just frustrated the hell out of me.

203
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:35,044
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, bitches.

204
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:15,154
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, then, once I got home, I called my manager, and he said, You better get it out tomorrow, because those fees for the tow yards go up astronomically, so they can take away your car after a number of days.

205
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,455
[SPEAKER_29]: They'll take away your car, put a lien on it, sell it off.

206
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,416
[SPEAKER_29]: So you want to get it out tomorrow.

207
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:26,339
[SPEAKER_29]: So, after that, I went and called... So I had to wait until like 4 a.m.

208
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,421
[SPEAKER_29]: in the morning, called my mom on the East Coast, and asked her to put in some money in my account, and she... She...

209
00:19:33,606 --> 00:20:00,944
[SPEAKER_29]: So, in the morning I called my co-worker and she drove me over to the Carmichael DMV and 10 minutes after they opened I paid $319 and got my registration and temporary tag so I can get a smog check and so from there, since the bus wasn't coming for 30 minutes I decided, oh, I'll just go ahead and start walking towards ARC, the American River College that took about 45 minutes later I was there

210
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:05,148
[SPEAKER_29]: Even though my foot was hurting in the beginning, but it didn't hurt after a while, so that was okay.

211
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:12,172
[SPEAKER_29]: But, after that, I took a bus from there to Greenback, then from there to Orangevale, where the thing was.

212
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:15,874
[SPEAKER_29]: The co-worker says, hey, okay, let's see if we can get it out.

213
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:20,096
[SPEAKER_29]: No, you have to go to Folsom PD and get them to release it.

214
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:24,098
[SPEAKER_29]: So you have to go there and show them that you got your registration and everything.

215
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:31,362
[SPEAKER_29]: So, after that, I didn't know about the buses there, so I started walking towards Folsom, and I missed the bus that came next.

216
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:33,319
[SPEAKER_29]: So I said, ah, let's go ahead and walk.

217
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,141
[SPEAKER_29]: So I walked another mile and a half down the hill, which wasn't too bad.

218
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:40,522
[SPEAKER_29]: It was a nice day out and so on.

219
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:45,504
[SPEAKER_29]: Then from there, I walked across the bridge because I missed the bus there.

220
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:49,766
[SPEAKER_29]: I kind of just went on and then said, nah, let's go walk a bit farther.

221
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,326
[SPEAKER_29]: So here comes the stupid part.

222
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:56,629
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a, I got like a little, the person at the tow yards that gave me a map.

223
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,290
[SPEAKER_29]: They said, you should go to Natoma Boulevard or Natoma Street.

224
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,431
[SPEAKER_29]: I thought it was Natomas Street, and I thought it was like a right turn.

225
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,574
[SPEAKER_29]: So when I went to Natomas Street, I went to turn to the right, and thought, oh, the levers are going up.

226
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:11,496
[SPEAKER_29]: And I didn't think to go left and see if there was something up that way.

227
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:14,878
[SPEAKER_29]: I just went down this, kept going down this road miles and miles.

228
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:20,622
[SPEAKER_29]: Didn't ask any directions or anything until I got to the end, basically to a big cross street.

229
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,304
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the lady, last lady of the apartment there.

230
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:26,486
[SPEAKER_29]: Apartment company says, uh, where's the Pilsner PD?

231
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:30,509
[SPEAKER_29]: I said, it's Natomas, there's no Natomas Street, you idiot.

232
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:31,705
[SPEAKER_29]: She didn't say that, of course.

233
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:32,925
[SPEAKER_29]: She was probably thinking it was crazy.

234
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:35,287
[SPEAKER_29]: This crazy guy walking away, the long way.

235
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:39,610
[SPEAKER_29]: So, after that, I walked back to the next bus stop.

236
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:45,934
[SPEAKER_29]: That took me to Entomba Street, and I had to walk, like, half a mile or so down to the PD.

237
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:50,918
[SPEAKER_29]: They said, oh, okay, here we go, give me a ticket, and say, okay, oh, you gotta pay $20.

238
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:51,959
[SPEAKER_29]: Ah, fuck.

239
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,140
[SPEAKER_29]: Gotta go across the street, get money out of the bank.

240
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,641
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh my god!

241
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,604
[SPEAKER_29]: Then walked back across the street, paid the money, then gotta go back to the bank.

242
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:04,745
[SPEAKER_29]: So I walked back down to Riley, and then got on a bus, which was good.

243
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:11,249
[SPEAKER_29]: The bus took me almost there, then paid $175 to the fucking tow yard, and got it out, and yay.

244
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,612
[SPEAKER_29]: Then I went back to work for like three and a half hours, and then made it up the rest of the week.

245
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:20,815
[SPEAKER_29]: Basically made up my whole week, and that was it for that.

246
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:23,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Tough lesson learned, everybody out there.

247
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:24,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Register your car!

248
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:26,959
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't fucking drive in Folsom.

249
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:28,843
[SPEAKER_29]: Stay far away.

250
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:37,229
[SPEAKER_29]: And in other news, I got keys to work so I can stay late and lock up the place after everyone else has left.

251
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:44,374
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to run through red lights and make illegal left turns, Folsom's where it's at because no one gives a shit.

252
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:54,741
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not broke now because Mother gave me enough money so that I could do that and a little bit of extra money.

253
00:22:55,691 --> 00:23:03,258
[SPEAKER_29]: Which is helpful because I can go and get a new chair mat because my other one has a hole in it that's been poking me in the foot for like three or four months.

254
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:08,542
[SPEAKER_29]: Then go to the Mall of Wart, the Mart of Walls and buy stuff.

255
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:12,966
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what I did today before coming here.

256
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:17,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, wow, well, interesting week there.

257
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,812
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week went.

258
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:25,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, uh, not much really, um, just school and work.

259
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Although, um, my instructor's becoming quite a flake.

260
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:33,572
[SPEAKER_15]: He almost canceled class on Monday.

261
00:23:35,813 --> 00:23:38,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Nah, well, I suppose he has his own reasons.

262
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:39,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

263
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:45,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Played a little Karamari Damasi and other stuff this week.

264
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:55,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe like a couple hours worth of FFXI, which is not as bad as you guys, but hey, it's something.

265
00:23:56,512 --> 00:24:01,893
[SPEAKER_15]: I also spent some time with, well, what, one-third of Orange Lounge?

266
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:07,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Not the hosts, of course, the other people that usually come here.

267
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:12,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Last night and spent an hour waiting to get into dinner.

268
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:17,248
[SPEAKER_15]: I can talk.

269
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:20,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Had dinner and watched movies and stuff last night.

270
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:21,029
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty cool.

271
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Which I don't get to do that often, so that was kind of fun.

272
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:28,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's about it, pretty much.

273
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:32,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

274
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:35,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I have something else to add, but I think you're going to talk about it, so I'll let you bring that up.

275
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:37,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'll talk about my weekend.

276
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:39,217
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

277
00:24:57,003 --> 00:25:07,188
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Thursday, I hung out with my friend and pretty much nothing interesting happened until Friday when I went and saw The Grudge with Loki and his girlfriend and my buddy Christopher.

278
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:08,109
[SPEAKER_21]: We went to this theater.

279
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:09,329
[SPEAKER_21]: My God, it was packed.

280
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:16,093
[SPEAKER_21]: Not only was the theater packed, but it was packed full of high schoolers because apparently these movies really appeal to the high schoolers.

281
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:22,756
[SPEAKER_21]: Boy, did we make a mistake going on opening night with all these high schoolers in there because every scary part of the movie, and there was a lot.

282
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:23,677
[SPEAKER_21]: The movie was pretty scary.

283
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:24,877
[SPEAKER_21]: Every scary part.

284
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:25,998
[SPEAKER_21]: All the girls were like,

285
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:34,010
[SPEAKER_21]: And like, even, it's, I don't want to ruin it, but there's this one part where the screaming became almost rhythmic.

286
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:39,413
[SPEAKER_21]: It was like, It was really funny.

287
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:45,276
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't, if you've seen the movie, you probably could figure out what part I'm talking about, but this is one part where it just was rhythmic.

288
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:45,997
[SPEAKER_21]: It was so funny.

289
00:25:48,203 --> 00:26:12,901
[SPEAKER_21]: But then there was this guy in the back of the theater, he was being really annoying, and you know the type I'm talking about, he's like that high school jock type, he's sitting there going, like making those noises, because apparently other high school jock types find those kinds of noises funny, and their girlfriends or whatever, so he was kind of mocking how everybody else was getting scared, like, oh my god, I want my mommy, and apparently this is funny when somebody does this.

290
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:19,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Never mind that it's a sold out theater and he's getting on everybody else's nerves in the theater and just bugging the hell out of all of us.

291
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:23,657
[SPEAKER_21]: You can just feel the tension, like everybody just wanted to turn around and punch this guy in the face.

292
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:24,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I right, Loki?

293
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, sure.

294
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:35,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so finally, I don't know what came over me, but I just turned, and mind you, this is right at the climax of the movie, towards the end of the movie, he's still yelling and screaming, he's been doing it for five minutes.

295
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:39,737
[SPEAKER_21]: I turn around, I look right at him, and I yell in the crowded theater.

296
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:44,359
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, with the guy with the little penis in the back row, please shut the hell up.

297
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,380
[SPEAKER_21]: And everybody burst into applause and started laughing.

298
00:26:49,661 --> 00:26:50,541
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that was kind of cool.

299
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:51,262
[SPEAKER_21]: And then he shut up.

300
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:55,684
[SPEAKER_21]: So he knew who he was by the way I addressed him, by being the small penis guy.

301
00:26:56,972 --> 00:27:05,380
[SPEAKER_21]: My advice to you, don't be afraid to shout it out if people are distracting the movie, because chances are everybody else around you is finding them distracting too, and they'll back you up.

302
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,501
[SPEAKER_21]: They're just being chicken.

303
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:07,622
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't want to say anything.

304
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:15,549
[SPEAKER_21]: So I can credit my couple years, God, several years experience with Rocky Horror Picture Show for making me unafraid to yell back at a movie.

305
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Speaking of which, I ended up going to see a local production of the Rocky Horror Show, which the

306
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:22,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Broadway version

307
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:45,762
[SPEAKER_16]: The one that they played on Broadway in 2000.

308
00:27:47,183 --> 00:27:53,347
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's where the difference... People were talking about, well, this isn't how the original play was because it actually was the redo for Broadway.

309
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:56,829
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Richard O'Brien went back and did the script for Broadway.

310
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I recognize it because I have the 2000 recording.

311
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,192
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was the same thing.

312
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:06,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good.

313
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:10,596
[SPEAKER_21]: So it was a good show.

314
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:11,657
[SPEAKER_21]: I liked it.

315
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:12,678
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura.com

316
00:28:30,263 --> 00:28:36,684
[SPEAKER_21]: And then other than that, I've just been doing a lot of rehearsal because there is going to be another production of the movie soon, which I'm involved with.

317
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:40,185
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've just been very tired going to rehearsals and things like that.

318
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:42,586
[SPEAKER_21]: And Jamie knows where I'm coming from with that, certainly.

319
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:44,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Amen.

320
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:47,587
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just glad I don't have to do prop crew this time around.

321
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,947
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I like doing prop crew and that's all cool.

322
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,007
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm doing lighting.

323
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:53,268
[SPEAKER_16]: That means I'm going to just sit on my butt playing with the light switches.

324
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:54,588
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an easy job.

325
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:54,968
[SPEAKER_21]: It's good.

326
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:55,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

327
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:58,409
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a lot of control in that little box.

328
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:00,195
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't mind the running about.

329
00:29:00,215 --> 00:29:01,895
[SPEAKER_21]: If someone makes you mad, you just turn the light off.

330
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:11,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't really mind doing the running about, putting stuff up on, you know, it was fun, but I was exhausted last time I did it, and you know what, I'm just going to sit back because I'm stressed enough.

331
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:15,577
[SPEAKER_21]: So, after next week, it's just going to be so tired.

332
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:18,799
[SPEAKER_21]: Which, by the way, reminds me, you guys, next week is Halloween.

333
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:24,022
[SPEAKER_21]: And so, on Halloween night, it's not looking like we're going to have a live show, you guys.

334
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:24,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Just so you know.

335
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:27,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's Halloween and people want to go out and do Halloween stuff.

336
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,965
[SPEAKER_21]: We actually don't think there's enough listener base.

337
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,647
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you guys will probably all want to go out and do your own things for Halloween.

338
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:41,411
[SPEAKER_21]: What I think we might do next weekend, we might do some type of very scary marathon of old Orange Lounge episodes.

339
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:43,292
[SPEAKER_21]: We might fit that in next week.

340
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,512
[SPEAKER_16]: That means we definitely get to hear Loki sing.

341
00:29:45,712 --> 00:29:50,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that means episode 69 for sure would be in there because that has to be one of the scariest episodes we ever did.

342
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:55,495
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to work something out where we do a marathon of old episodes.

343
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,784
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's pretty much it for my week and my day.

344
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:04,267
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody had anything remotely DDR related in their week at all.

345
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:06,449
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just... Yes, Angel.

346
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:11,073
[SPEAKER_15]: I was at Fry's and I met one of our local freestylers.

347
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:12,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Prestige.

348
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:14,996
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

349
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:19,700
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never heard... What, is Fry's the place to play DDR in town now?

350
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,224
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I know that... What's his name online?

351
00:30:24,244 --> 00:30:24,664
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't remember.

352
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:25,105
[SPEAKER_21]: Islander.

353
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:28,765
[SPEAKER_21]: I know his real name, I can't remember his name online.

354
00:30:29,145 --> 00:30:31,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Islander plays a lot at Fry's, from what I hear.

355
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:35,668
[SPEAKER_21]: He plays a lot at DDR at Fry's, because I guess it's near his work, and then I guess Prestige goes there.

356
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,609
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going there, and you were playing DDR?

357
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Fry's must be the place to be now, all of a sudden.

358
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:48,334
[SPEAKER_21]: What happened to... Well, I mean, I know what happened to Golfland and all the arcades in town, but it's kind of sad when a department store becomes the main DDR hangout in town.

359
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:55,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I was just shopping for geek stuff, and, well, he was there, and so we just started playing DDR for, like,

360
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:56,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times, good times.

361
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:38,724
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it's getting sad, but you have to understand there's really not a whole lot of reason for us to go out and play DDR in this town anymore because really, nobody's really gotten anything new in six months at least.

362
00:31:38,784 --> 00:31:44,086
[SPEAKER_21]: When did Guitar Freaks 9, 10 come out?

363
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,927
[SPEAKER_21]: What the hell version do they have anyway, 9?

364
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:51,226
[SPEAKER_21]: I could give a shit after five, really.

365
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:58,231
[SPEAKER_29]: They actually still have the same Guitar Freaks 8th Mix where they put in Percussion Freaks 9th Mix, I think.

366
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:58,651
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

367
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:04,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Percussion Freaks 9th Mix and Guitar Freaks 8th Mix, which makes no sense at all.

368
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:07,456
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's the last new Bomani this town saw, anyway.

369
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:15,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Except the Statmania machine, but that thing was broken so fast that it never really got to stick around.

370
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,128
[SPEAKER_21]: So really, I think at this point a lot of us are just sitting and waiting in anticipation of Ultramix 2 because that's going to be the next big story.

371
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:27,212
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually did play DDR Extreme the other day though.

372
00:32:27,432 --> 00:32:28,493
[SPEAKER_21]: It's still really fun to me.

373
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:36,842
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's one thing I guess I could say for it is that I was playing on the ignition pad trying to work some of my fat ass off because I've got a show to do next week.

374
00:32:37,563 --> 00:33:02,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Poppin' Music and 2DX8 also Absolutely, it's going to be definitely a huge week, November 18th When Festival and Poppin' Music 10 and all that fun stuff, 2DX8 style come out too Oh, you know we had a trailer, there was a trailer for 2DX8 style that came out not too long ago And we completely forgot to mention it last week So I'm going to make sure to bring it up tonight In fact, I'm going to do that right now If I can find that, here it is

375
00:33:03,294 --> 00:33:08,937
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's some audio here from a new preview that is out for 2DX8Style, and I'll show this here in studio.

376
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:13,059
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, you hear a little bit of Guideca there.

377
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,461
[SPEAKER_21]: And it just shows the Konami logos here.

378
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:21,322
[SPEAKER_21]: It says, ooh, 2DX8Style!

379
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,744
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's showing a lot of the screenshots from the game and all these videos.

380
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:29,106
[SPEAKER_21]: You see, like, Alien World and a bunch of Japanese text.

381
00:33:29,646 --> 00:33:31,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Something 50 and something 80 here.

382
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:35,854
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure somebody in our chat room can translate that there.

383
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:38,236
[SPEAKER_21]: New song!

384
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:43,598
Very nice clip there of a Santa song.

385
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:44,599
This is a new song as well.

386
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:45,880
Yeah, it's definitely an LED song.

387
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:06,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, look at that.

388
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:08,336
[SPEAKER_21]: And it says there, November 18th.

389
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:12,399
[SPEAKER_21]: And it had some clips from the new videos in there as well, so.

390
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,641
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even remember where I got that.

391
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:15,682
[SPEAKER_21]: I think somebody sent it to me.

392
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:18,864
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would totally pass along where you guys could get it, except I don't remember.

393
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:23,147
[SPEAKER_21]: They said 50 new songs over 80 songs in total.

394
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:30,973
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're confirming in our chatroom, DarkLionXVI says the last song is Nebula Grasper.

395
00:34:31,294 --> 00:34:32,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Was that last song you heard a little clip of there?

396
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:38,011
[SPEAKER_21]: And the one before that was the Santa song that's in the new poppin' music as well, right?

397
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:41,055
[SPEAKER_21]: The one that she sang at Tokyo Game Show?

398
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:42,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

399
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:44,079
[SPEAKER_21]: I could be.

400
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,041
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

401
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:48,604
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

402
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:52,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Also on Bomani News this week, we have a little bit of Bomani News.

403
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:56,210
[SPEAKER_21]: The box art for Ultramix 2 came out.

404
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,651
[SPEAKER_21]: You might have seen this at your local store, actually.

405
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:05,673
[SPEAKER_21]: And the interesting thing about the box art, though, is that it has a little thing in there that talks about how it features dance hits.

406
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:11,995
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, remember how DDR Max said, Ooh, this features dance hits from Darude and Aurora and all the bands that were in there.

407
00:35:12,015 --> 00:35:13,836
[SPEAKER_21]: And the Max 2 was, Ooh, it's Kylie Minogue.

408
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, this one says...

409
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:19,074
[SPEAKER_21]: Featuring dance hits by Delirium, we knew that after all, right?

410
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:41,435
[SPEAKER_21]: Elvis, we knew that, Rubberneckin' Freestylers, which isn't ringing a bell with me So I don't think we know about what this song is And they've tried to do research, I think over on the DDR Freak thread But nobody's come up with what song that could be yet So maybe we'll hear more about that later But we have the Commodores, which we know is Brick House Nucleus, which is jam on it, we talked about that before Captain Jack

411
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:45,494
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe the Dream of Dream booty mix was confirmed previously.

412
00:35:45,994 --> 00:35:49,094
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, Jason Nevins presents Holly James.

413
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:51,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, guess what?

414
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:55,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Jason Nevins and Holly James, they only ever did one song together.

415
00:35:55,775 --> 00:36:01,396
[SPEAKER_21]: So, that pretty much, no, that song was just announced recently.

416
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:07,957
[SPEAKER_21]: So, anyway, we're going to go ahead and play that song for you guys right now.

417
00:36:08,017 --> 00:36:10,938
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Jason Nevins and Holly James.

418
00:36:11,684 --> 00:36:41,020
[SPEAKER_21]: and the song is called I'm in Heaven and we'll play that for you guys now this hasn't been confirmed but it's kind of one of those things where it's like well unless it's a remix or something like that who knows so we're going to play that for you guys right now the assumed radio edit would be the version they'd use in DDR because we haven't heard if it's a remix again it's kind of unconfirmed but at the same time when it's on the box art you know duh so here it is Jason Evans

419
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:42,874
[SPEAKER_21]: With Holly James, I'm in Heaven.

420
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:38,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel When these feelings I have really are for real The time is right for this, a love to shine on through But you gotta tell me what you wanna do

421
00:37:56,936 --> 00:38:00,478
I'm in heaven with you I'm in heaven with you Heaven with you

422
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:35,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time you're near, I start to lose control When the thought of you, hits my very soul When you're lying in my bed, right next to me

423
00:38:57,145 --> 00:38:59,487
I'm in heaven with you Only one for me

424
00:39:19,258 --> 00:39:20,540
Thanks for watching!

425
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,898
I'm in heaven with you

426
00:40:35,627 --> 00:40:43,494
[SPEAKER_32]: Warning, Orange Lounge Radio's Monty Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

427
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:54,182
[SPEAKER_32]: We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

428
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:58,746
[SPEAKER_32]: A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

429
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:03,170
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

430
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,001
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was a song that has not been confirmed, yet it pretty much has by the box art.

431
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:12,283
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm in Heaven, Jason Evans, featuring Holly James.

432
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,143
[SPEAKER_21]: What did you guys think of that?

433
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:15,524
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty cool.

434
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:19,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, did you realize that that's actually a former Cage Match winner from this program?

435
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:20,687
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember that song.

436
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:23,068
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Loki picked that song a while back.

437
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Or at least, I don't know if it was necessarily that mix.

438
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:27,470
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it was one of your white label mixes.

439
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:28,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Very close.

440
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:29,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that was it?

441
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:29,871
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, my bad.

442
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:31,172
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so that was it.

443
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:31,632
[SPEAKER_21]: So now...

444
00:41:32,697 --> 00:41:36,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, you had picked Delirium After All in a cage match once.

445
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:37,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

446
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, you picked that one, which was in a cage match once.

447
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:42,702
[SPEAKER_21]: I want a song in Ultramax.

448
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:43,623
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not fair.

449
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:45,744
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

450
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:47,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

451
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:47,585
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

452
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:48,605
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

453
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:49,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, Rob.

454
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:50,506
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe one day.

455
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:51,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Chicks are for kids.

456
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:51,967
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

457
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:53,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe one day.

458
00:41:56,354 --> 00:42:01,355
[SPEAKER_21]: So, what we want to do now, I actually want to go ahead and give somebody a call here on the Skype line.

459
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:05,216
[SPEAKER_21]: We tried to get him on the show here last week, but unfortunately the connection was really bad.

460
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:09,177
[SPEAKER_21]: So, everybody keep your fingers crossed that the connection is a little bit better tonight.

461
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:10,498
[SPEAKER_19]: So, everybody's got their fingers crossed, yes?

462
00:42:10,518 --> 00:42:15,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so hopefully he's there and I don't embarrass myself here on the radio, but we're going to go ahead and give this a try here.

463
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,840
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope it works.

464
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,722
[SPEAKER_21]: One ringy dingy, two ringy dingys.

465
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:28,283
[SPEAKER_21]: Three ringy dingies.

466
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:30,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Four ringy dingies.

467
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:31,624
[SPEAKER_21]: God, I hope he's there.

468
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:35,105
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be pretty funny.

469
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:35,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

470
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:38,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, is this frequency?

471
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:42,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh no, the connection's still kind of shy.

472
00:42:42,846 --> 00:42:43,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear me okay?

473
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:49,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh no, we're still having a problem hearing him.

474
00:42:49,688 --> 00:42:52,128
[SPEAKER_21]: He's very choppy.

475
00:42:52,848 --> 00:42:56,049
[SPEAKER_21]: You only hear a couple seconds here and there, and then that's it.

476
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,493
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear you fine.

477
00:42:59,553 --> 00:43:00,294
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, there you go.

478
00:43:00,374 --> 00:43:01,074
[SPEAKER_21]: I can kind of hear him.

479
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:03,937
[SPEAKER_21]: He says he can hear us okay.

480
00:43:04,257 --> 00:43:07,059
[SPEAKER_21]: You might have something with your mic sensitivity settings.

481
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:10,782
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm wondering if it's the mic sensitivity because I heard like a little bit there.

482
00:43:11,403 --> 00:43:15,506
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hold the mic up nice and... Hi.

483
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:19,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

484
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:23,372
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so I'm going to try and do a conversation here.

485
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,833
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you doing this evening, Frequency?

486
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:26,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing okay.

487
00:43:26,434 --> 00:43:27,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I just woke up from nap.

488
00:43:33,323 --> 00:43:37,746
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so tell us a little bit about this tournament that just happened on the East Coast recently.

489
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:44,151
[SPEAKER_21]: I was kind of curious about what went on there, because we don't get to talk a whole lot about East Coast events on the show, so I'm kind of curious what went on with this tournament.

490
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:54,658
[SPEAKER_12]: It was not so good, but not the main thing.

491
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:55,779
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

492
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:56,200
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

493
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,863
[SPEAKER_21]: The connection, for some reason, we're not getting them for some reason.

494
00:44:00,883 --> 00:44:03,305
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm only hearing little bits and pieces of you.

495
00:44:03,845 --> 00:44:05,826
[SPEAKER_21]: So, gosh, I'm really sorry.

496
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:10,830
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess what we're going to have to do, maybe we can try giving you a call later in the show.

497
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:11,510
[SPEAKER_21]: I have another idea.

498
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,692
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to try getting back to you a little bit later, Frequency.

499
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:14,553
[SPEAKER_21]: I have another idea, okay?

500
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:15,974
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

501
00:44:16,014 --> 00:44:16,454
[SPEAKER_21]: Take care, bud.

502
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:17,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Bye-bye.

503
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:19,556
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, what a bummer.

504
00:44:19,596 --> 00:44:20,036
[SPEAKER_21]: What a bummer.

505
00:44:22,398 --> 00:44:25,020
[SPEAKER_21]: I do have another idea, though, but I can't get to it until the next break.

506
00:44:25,506 --> 00:44:26,827
[SPEAKER_21]: But that does give me an idea.

507
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:30,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so, I guess we have to shift gears here.

508
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:38,532
[SPEAKER_21]: Darn, because I have a lot of good questions I want to ask them too, and we don't get East Coast people on this show a whole lot, but that's alright, we'll give it a try later.

509
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:41,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, moving on.

510
00:44:42,654 --> 00:44:44,135
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess we could talk about other news going on.

511
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:47,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Didn't you find some news about Pump It Up that was going on this week, Loki?

512
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:51,018
[SPEAKER_21]: You got really bored and you found out that Pump It Up actually had some news going on?

513
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, there's two things going on.

514
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:59,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Number one being, there's another release that's coming out in November, I believe.

515
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:02,765
[SPEAKER_19]: And that would be Pump It Up Exceed on the JPS2.

516
00:45:03,545 --> 00:45:04,686
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's going to be coming out.

517
00:45:04,946 --> 00:45:05,607
[SPEAKER_19]: God damn it.

518
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, our connection is fucking sucking tonight.

519
00:45:08,348 --> 00:45:12,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, yeah, so Pump It Up Exceed, it's going to be coming out.

520
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:13,632
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be arcade perfect.

521
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:16,254
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's going to be 100 plus songs.

522
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:21,470
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be coming out one week before all the DDR stuff.

523
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:28,914
[SPEAKER_19]: There's rumors, though, that it's going to be coming out also for the US PS2 and the Xbox later on.

524
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:36,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, they've added a few different modes in there.

525
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:40,440
[SPEAKER_19]: They have a mode that's kind of like where you just watch videos, the background videos, that type of thing.

526
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:54,776
[SPEAKER_19]: and also supposedly the PC version USB pads that shipped with the old version, Premiere, I think actually are going to be working with the PS2 version.

527
00:45:54,856 --> 00:45:57,038
[SPEAKER_19]: So that should be pretty interesting.

528
00:45:57,138 --> 00:45:58,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Looks pretty cool so far.

529
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:05,886
[SPEAKER_19]: Other than that, starting, looks like this coming week in Korea...

530
00:46:06,585 --> 00:46:15,250
[SPEAKER_19]: at Animero headquarters will be beta testing for Pump It Up Exceed 2, which they have really, really insane details on that.

531
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,453
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure that will be coming next week as stuff leaks out from the beta test location.

532
00:46:22,394 --> 00:46:23,675
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's your Pump It Up news.

533
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:26,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Exciting.

534
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,121
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's very strange that Pump It Up could possibly come to the U.S.

535
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:38,663
[SPEAKER_21]: And then they're also saying, they're rumoring that In The Groove could be coming to the home versions as well, so it's going to be very interesting.

536
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:44,265
[SPEAKER_21]: I doubt that one, but I do too, but they're saying it, so I guess I should acknowledge it.

537
00:46:45,445 --> 00:46:45,905
[SPEAKER_19]: I doubt that.

538
00:46:46,786 --> 00:46:56,509
[SPEAKER_19]: But, no, seriously, McSeed, though, is doing extremely well, like in some of the other countries that, you know, non-English countries like Mexico is fucking hot over there.

539
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:57,529
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um,

540
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:00,673
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't, I mean, why not?

541
00:47:00,973 --> 00:47:02,675
[SPEAKER_19]: Try releasing it over here, see how it does.

542
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:10,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I'm sure, I mean, most of the stuff they've got is in-house artists anyway, so you're not really, you know, going to lose money on licensing as far as music goes.

543
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Really, there's not much to lose there.

544
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:18,785
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, other than, you know, oh, you have to make some new pads or something, but I think you'd do pretty well over here.

545
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:19,866
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, give it a shot.

546
00:47:19,906 --> 00:47:24,049
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it can't be any worse than, like, say, you know, Britney's Dance Beat and all that crap.

547
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:27,611
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, at least it's a step above all that stuff, so, you know, hey, why not?

548
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:53,082
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it would be very interesting if they did give Pump It Up a home release for this reason, because DDR, they've kind of stopped doing the arcade thing, and I think especially with DDR, or I'm sorry, with Konami USA, they've kind of given up on doing the arcade thing, there's not going to be a new arcade mix unless hell freezes over, so basically it is a possibility, but very low chance, low, low, low chance.

549
00:47:54,022 --> 00:47:59,965
[SPEAKER_21]: So basically they've pretty much stuck to the home versions, and I think everybody understands that the home versions are where they make their money.

550
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:02,378
[SPEAKER_21]: and Konami of America, they push the home versions.

551
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:04,559
[SPEAKER_21]: It's their bread and butter for DDR.

552
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:18,551
[SPEAKER_21]: They see the future of DDR being these home versions, and that's why they never really threw a fit over the import mixes, at least as far as I can tell, because the import mixes of DDR Arcade kind of serve as promotion for the home versions.

553
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,992
[SPEAKER_21]: So everything works out.

554
00:48:20,052 --> 00:48:21,533
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody gets their share.

555
00:48:21,934 --> 00:48:25,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, now if Pump It Up ends up coming out for the home versions...

556
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:28,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Was Konami going to take issue to that?

557
00:48:28,436 --> 00:48:29,737
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there anything they can do about it?

558
00:48:29,757 --> 00:48:30,457
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I don't know.

559
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:38,282
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there were those rumors a while back that Andomero and Konami might have had it out in court, and that's why, you know, I don't know.

560
00:48:38,322 --> 00:48:39,863
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a bunch of rumors going on out there.

561
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:41,785
[SPEAKER_21]: You think Konami would take issue with that?

562
00:48:41,805 --> 00:48:42,525
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you think would happen?

563
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:44,026
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody have a thought?

564
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:45,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, I'd especially be curious what you think.

565
00:48:45,747 --> 00:48:46,908
[SPEAKER_21]: You always seem to have a strong opinion.

566
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:56,134
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if they're legally able to bring it over here, actually, because of the whole lawsuit thing earlier, but I don't know.

567
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:56,314
[SPEAKER_19]: They're

568
00:48:57,188 --> 00:49:07,353
[SPEAKER_19]: You can't really... I mean, DDR hasn't gone after... Konami hasn't gone after any of these other games that have similar rhythm type things with them.

569
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,274
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure it'll be fine.

570
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:15,097
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it'd be pretty cheap if they just went after them if they started doing well.

571
00:49:15,197 --> 00:49:19,759
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, oh yeah, well, now that they're doing well, I guess, yeah, we have a problem with it now.

572
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,760
[SPEAKER_19]: But, yeah, I don't know.

573
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,862
[SPEAKER_19]: To be honest, I really don't know.

574
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:26,382
[SPEAKER_19]: But,

575
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:33,740
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's my concern, okay, about Indie Groove coming to the home console.

576
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,085
[SPEAKER_19]: First off, I don't think it's going to happen, only because, one, it's going to be hard.

577
00:49:39,105 --> 00:49:45,050
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, making a console game is a little harder than making, you know, just the arcade, you know, ports and stuff.

578
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Because, I mean, hell, anyone can hook up a PC to an arcade machine.

579
00:49:47,773 --> 00:49:48,533
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not that hard.

580
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:52,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, programming for the home console is a little different.

581
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, if it's fucking hard enough, they have 11 12-footers in the arcade.

582
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:58,271
[SPEAKER_19]: How the fuck are you going to play that on a softpad?

583
00:49:58,411 --> 00:49:59,232
[SPEAKER_19]: That's never going to work.

584
00:50:00,032 --> 00:50:01,472
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's my concern right there.

585
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:02,813
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it's ever going to happen.

586
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:07,474
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'm sure they'd like to see it happen, but feasibly, I don't think it's going to happen.

587
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:11,495
[SPEAKER_21]: Very interesting thought.

588
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:16,857
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody else have a thought on In the Groove coming out for home or what Pump It Up may do for DDR?

589
00:50:17,113 --> 00:50:21,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Pump It Up actually did have a home release on PC.

590
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:22,680
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right, I forgot about that.

591
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Was that in the U.S., though?

592
00:50:26,796 --> 00:50:31,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, yeah, actually, Red Octane sells it, and I don't think they sell the import DDRs, or do they?

593
00:50:31,457 --> 00:50:32,257
[SPEAKER_21]: I could be wrong.

594
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:32,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I saw that too.

595
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:33,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, do they?

596
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:34,177
[SPEAKER_16]: I think so.

597
00:50:34,217 --> 00:50:34,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh.

598
00:50:34,677 --> 00:50:36,178
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure.

599
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:38,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I completely forgot about that.

600
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:41,519
[SPEAKER_21]: You're right, Pump It Up did have a previous home release on the PC.

601
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:44,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Not that the dance market on PC is very lucrative.

602
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:47,980
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe the folks that created DDR PC found that out the hard way.

603
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,201
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I saw those games going for like $10 a pop at Fry's not too long ago.

604
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:54,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

605
00:50:55,903 --> 00:50:57,825
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I got mine for about the same.

606
00:50:58,366 --> 00:51:03,170
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you think that Pump It Up coming out for the home version would help DDR, or do you think it's going to hurt it?

607
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:08,976
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think that after they compare, but I don't know.

608
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:09,997
[SPEAKER_13]: It can depend.

609
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:11,518
[SPEAKER_13]: There's different factors to consider.

610
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:16,823
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the biggest turnoff is that you have to get a whole other dance pad for Pump It Up.

611
00:51:17,303 --> 00:51:17,684
[SPEAKER_21]: Because...

612
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:27,307
[SPEAKER_21]: Although it would be very easy, you would think, with the ignition pad, you could just use the buttons, the X, O, circle, square, which are in the corners, but there's no center button.

613
00:51:27,647 --> 00:51:32,409
[SPEAKER_21]: The center doesn't do anything on those pads, as far as I know, so you're kind of screwed there.

614
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:41,092
[SPEAKER_19]: The pump-it-up pads not only do have the corner buttons, they do have the up, down, left, right buttons also, because those are for song select stuff.

615
00:51:41,872 --> 00:51:42,452
[SPEAKER_19]: They use those.

616
00:51:42,872 --> 00:51:44,453
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah.

617
00:51:46,107 --> 00:52:00,032
[SPEAKER_21]: So theoretically, any DDR pad that has all the corner buttons would work, except the official Konami ones, because they don't have triangle and square in the back like most of the other pads do, except all the other pads are missing that center button.

618
00:52:00,052 --> 00:52:03,633
[SPEAKER_21]: So, now you're going to have a whole new dance pad if you want to play Pump It Up at home.

619
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:06,954
[SPEAKER_21]: And how many people are that obsessed with Pump It Up where they're going to spend all the money on that?

620
00:52:07,915 --> 00:52:12,016
[SPEAKER_21]: And how many stores are going to pick up those Pump It Up pads for commercial sale?

621
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:13,037
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

622
00:52:13,057 --> 00:52:14,458
[SPEAKER_21]: It'd be interesting.

623
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:38,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I guess what we're going to do now is we're going to take another break.

624
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:43,392
[SPEAKER_21]: When we come back, we'll hopefully have everything set up so we can try calling frequency again.

625
00:52:43,412 --> 00:52:44,232
[SPEAKER_21]: That'll be very cool.

626
00:52:44,892 --> 00:52:47,173
[SPEAKER_21]: If not, I guess we'll have ourselves a cage match.

627
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:48,094
[SPEAKER_21]: That'll be some fun.

628
00:52:48,614 --> 00:52:52,195
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll talk about some more DDR, Bomani, when we come back.

629
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:58,537
[SPEAKER_21]: In this break, let's do... Well, you know what I kind of want to do, if I can find the music?

630
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:00,498
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do some DDR Disney.

631
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:02,619
[SPEAKER_16]: We play fire.

632
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:04,557
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

633
00:53:04,637 --> 00:53:09,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see if I can find the directory that has all my random stuff in it.

634
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:12,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, shoot, not all the Disney stuff's in here.

635
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:18,223
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we'll see what we can do.

636
00:53:18,483 --> 00:53:19,603
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I do have the Mickey Mouse March.

637
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:22,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, well, we have enough to do a break.

638
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,065
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be back after this.

639
00:53:33,098 --> 00:53:33,958
Thank you for watching!

640
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:15,706
Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse, forever let's go, I wanna hide, hide, hide, hide Come along and sing a song and join the juggling, M-I-C-K-Y-M-U-S-E Come along and sing a song and join the juggling, M-I-C-K-Y-M-U-S-E Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse, we have fun with Mickey Mouse

641
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:50,191
Fire!

642
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,394
One, two, three, FIRE!

643
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:00,926
Thanks for watching!

644
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:29,535
and many more.

645
00:57:44,157 --> 00:57:45,037
[SPEAKER_10]: and many more.

646
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:50,926
[SPEAKER_30]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

647
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:55,756
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

648
00:59:55,776 --> 00:59:56,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we talk about that?

649
00:59:57,016 --> 00:59:59,378
[SPEAKER_11]: No subject will ever be taboo.

650
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:03,279
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

651
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:06,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

652
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:12,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

653
01:00:12,763 --> 01:00:14,044
[SPEAKER_19]: I collect your fucking head.

654
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like this fucker here.

655
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:22,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

656
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,940
[SPEAKER_28]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

657
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,325
[SPEAKER_28]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

658
01:00:34,545 --> 01:00:38,308
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

659
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:45,373
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I never understood, Jamie, is why does your voice sound so different in that promo?

660
01:00:46,633 --> 01:00:47,213
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

661
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:51,716
[SPEAKER_16]: I was taking these voice acting lessons and decided to sound like Lucy Liu.

662
01:00:52,176 --> 01:00:52,496
[SPEAKER_21]: I see.

663
01:00:52,756 --> 01:00:53,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe it was something like that.

664
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:54,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I did pretty well, don't you?

665
01:00:55,838 --> 01:00:56,278
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so.

666
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:56,778
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so.

667
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:03,001
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I got this new thing for Skype that allows us to dial phone numbers, so I'm going to try this real fast.

668
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:03,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to do a test.

669
01:01:03,882 --> 01:01:07,063
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate to do this live on air, but damn it, I want this to happen.

670
01:01:08,704 --> 01:01:09,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, it worked.

671
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:12,646
[SPEAKER_21]: What the hell do you want?

672
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:15,127
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it worked.

673
01:01:15,227 --> 01:01:16,228
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, can you hear me on this thing?

674
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there's a delay, but that's cool.

675
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:21,580
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm on a phone, and I'm here.

676
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,761
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to hang up.

677
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:23,401
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't want any.

678
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,382
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'm hanging up on him.

679
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:25,162
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool, it worked.

680
01:01:25,262 --> 01:01:26,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so maybe... Telemarket Loki.

681
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,684
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully we can do that and make it work.

682
01:01:28,744 --> 01:01:32,406
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a little quiet, but maybe I can tweak the volume settings in there and get it to work.

683
01:01:32,887 --> 01:01:34,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like to take a survey?

684
01:01:37,449 --> 01:01:40,491
[SPEAKER_16]: You're crazy.

685
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:41,992
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm not crazy.

686
01:01:42,652 --> 01:01:43,753
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm slightly strange.

687
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:46,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki's the crazy one with his portal to hell and all that.

688
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:55,776
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

689
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:57,477
[SPEAKER_21]: How's it going there, Loki?

690
01:01:57,497 --> 01:02:00,478
[SPEAKER_21]: You're trying to figure out what that Freestyler song could be, huh?

691
01:02:00,538 --> 01:02:01,838
[SPEAKER_21]: You're trying to do research there.

692
01:02:02,498 --> 01:02:03,339
[SPEAKER_21]: What were you doing there earlier?

693
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:08,480
[SPEAKER_21]: You were hacking that master file thing that... I don't even... I can't even remember what the hell this thing is.

694
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:12,001
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the master song list.

695
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,222
[SPEAKER_19]: I was looking at it.

696
01:02:14,462 --> 01:02:15,283
Where does that come from?

697
01:02:15,843 --> 01:02:22,105
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this is from... It's a document that... Or it's a file that's in... Well, this one is in the DDR Extreme USA...

698
01:02:23,547 --> 01:02:24,448
[SPEAKER_19]: CD or DVD.

699
01:02:24,548 --> 01:02:27,089
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was looking to see, because there's a few songs in there.

700
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:32,111
[SPEAKER_19]: I see some from the new Dancing Stage game that's going to be coming out.

701
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:33,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Then there's a few that I didn't recognize.

702
01:02:33,892 --> 01:02:35,973
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was just seeing if I could figure it out.

703
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:41,716
[SPEAKER_19]: Because in here, remember we reported a few weeks back about Superstar?

704
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:42,797
[SPEAKER_19]: That's in there.

705
01:02:43,497 --> 01:02:45,858
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, just stuff like that.

706
01:02:46,038 --> 01:02:47,739
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was just seeing if it might be in there.

707
01:02:48,479 --> 01:02:49,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it might be.

708
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:49,900
[SPEAKER_19]: You never know.

709
01:02:54,295 --> 01:02:59,438
[SPEAKER_16]: What is that you're... No, I found out... I had the microphone in my lap and people can hear me being IM'd.

710
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:00,859
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure.

711
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:04,641
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad.

712
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:06,682
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

713
01:03:07,143 --> 01:03:12,666
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess what we're going to do is go into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match for this week.

714
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:15,488
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to change your song?

715
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:16,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have a new one?

716
01:03:16,468 --> 01:03:18,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, um... Hold on a second.

717
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:22,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

718
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:22,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

719
01:03:25,733 --> 01:03:28,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match tonight.

720
01:03:34,138 --> 01:03:39,780
[SPEAKER_21]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Echo Image won for the fourth week in a row, meaning they are retired.

721
01:03:40,301 --> 01:03:43,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Goodbye, you're gone, you're out of here.

722
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:52,147
[SPEAKER_21]: But let's have one more moment to remember the Echo Image, the very first song ever to be retired in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match here.

723
01:03:52,187 --> 01:03:52,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me...

724
01:03:54,489 --> 01:03:59,050
[SPEAKER_21]: The song was called Come Back, and here's a little bit of Come Back for you to remember this song by.

725
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:18,115
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, that's enough of the song.

726
01:04:19,016 --> 01:04:20,656
[SPEAKER_21]: You've heard enough of it over the past four weeks.

727
01:04:23,991 --> 01:04:29,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so you get three brand new songs in their entirety tonight, each host bringing one song to the table.

728
01:04:31,836 --> 01:04:33,297
[SPEAKER_21]: And who's going to go first tonight?

729
01:04:33,357 --> 01:04:34,057
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I will.

730
01:04:34,097 --> 01:04:34,437
[SPEAKER_21]: Why not?

731
01:04:34,457 --> 01:04:36,459
[SPEAKER_21]: I never get to go first because I hardly ever win this thing.

732
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:38,320
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I'm going to go first tonight.

733
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,500
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to play my song.

734
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,042
[SPEAKER_21]: And, whoops, that's not the song I'm doing.

735
01:04:43,726 --> 01:04:56,635
[SPEAKER_21]: My song is a song by Ian Van Dow, who is the guy who did Will I from DDR Max 2, and he has a new song out, and the song is called Reason, and that's going to be my cage match pick for tonight.

736
01:04:56,716 --> 01:05:01,059
[SPEAKER_21]: So, enjoy Reason by Ian Van Dow, my pick, song number one tonight.

737
01:05:39,366 --> 01:05:44,569
Together, or is it time to say goodbye?

738
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:47,151
Where is the love?

739
01:05:49,412 --> 01:06:07,684
Give me a reason To hold on to what we've got There must be a reason To hold on to what we've got Time has come to set things right

740
01:06:08,852 --> 01:06:14,423
is it worth another fight tell me the truth

741
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:48,079
Thank you for watching!

742
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:11,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is the love?

743
01:07:15,104 --> 01:07:18,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me, is there hope inside?

744
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:24,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Gotta read between the lines Where is the love?

745
01:07:56,998 --> 01:07:57,423
Thank you.

746
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:36,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

747
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:38,854
[SPEAKER_21]: That was Ian Van Dow with Reason.

748
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:42,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go around and see if they had a reason to like or hate this song in the studio.

749
01:08:42,296 --> 01:08:42,616
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie!

750
01:08:43,857 --> 01:08:44,598
[SPEAKER_16]: It's chancy.

751
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, again, I'm really burned on chant.

752
01:08:50,803 --> 01:08:51,723
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's not bad.

753
01:08:52,524 --> 01:08:54,826
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I've heard it before.

754
01:08:55,647 --> 01:08:56,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, just seven.

755
01:08:56,988 --> 01:08:57,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven and a half.

756
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:03,084
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually thought Jamie would give it a lower score, because I remember her saying she was sick of Trance, but dammit, I'm out of songs!

757
01:09:04,705 --> 01:09:05,966
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a new one that I happen to like.

758
01:09:06,426 --> 01:09:07,166
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley, what'd you think?

759
01:09:07,426 --> 01:09:08,607
[SPEAKER_29]: I thought it was pretty good, I'd give it an 8.

760
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:10,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair enough.

761
01:09:10,588 --> 01:09:10,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki?

762
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:16,471
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sick of Trance, but I'm sick of Ian Vandell, so I think it's a 6.

763
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:24,036
[SPEAKER_21]: I like it, it's happy, it's not my favorite Ian Vandell song, but I think it is worthy of a cage match title, I'd give it an 8.5.

764
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:27,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Infant Doll's cool.

765
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:28,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I'll give it an 8.

766
01:09:30,693 --> 01:09:30,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

767
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:37,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go on to song number 2, which is coming to us courtesy of the lovely DarkSakura.

768
01:09:37,535 --> 01:09:39,395
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?

769
01:09:39,735 --> 01:09:43,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I need to find the name of the song again because I remembered that you had it because you burned my CD.

770
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:44,656
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me give you a hint.

771
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:47,497
[SPEAKER_21]: The song is called Everybody Wants You to Emerge.

772
01:09:47,877 --> 01:09:48,297
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

773
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,258
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a mix of Emerge by Fisher Spooner and, uh...

774
01:09:52,099 --> 01:10:02,184
[SPEAKER_16]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

775
01:10:21,673 --> 01:10:25,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Whether you love or hate the show, it's got a great bouncy soundtrack to it.

776
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:29,216
[SPEAKER_16]: So, let's see if this... Basically enough, I don't like the opening song.

777
01:10:30,016 --> 01:10:31,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's kind of weird, huh?

778
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:33,957
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, the opening song is like too gay, but the rest of it's really good.

779
01:10:34,357 --> 01:10:37,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's like 90s pop dance, you know?

780
01:10:37,518 --> 01:10:37,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

781
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:44,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I feel like... Oh, you should have heard the thing on Tuesday.

782
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:47,022
[SPEAKER_21]: I did a whole... Did you hear... Oh, I did a whole block of 90s dance.

783
01:10:48,354 --> 01:10:50,899
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm detesting you, I heard.

784
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:53,323
[SPEAKER_16]: And I need that, by the way.

785
01:10:53,523 --> 01:10:58,972
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember being in Mobile and my friend's little Honda thing...

786
01:11:00,645 --> 01:11:09,909
[SPEAKER_16]: If for some reason, heaven forbid, Orange Moms Radio ever went belly up and we weren't doing this show anymore, I think I would have to start an early 90s dance music station.

787
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:10,389
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be rad.

788
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe we just ought to start one anyway.

789
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:23,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Compete with ourselves.

790
01:11:24,832 --> 01:11:30,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, there's somebody out there that I know we're trying to negotiate with somebody out there to do a new show on our network.

791
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:33,136
[SPEAKER_21]: But they're thinking of ideas for the show.

792
01:11:33,236 --> 01:11:34,497
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a great one right there.

793
01:11:34,597 --> 01:11:36,338
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know you like that kind of music, person.

794
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:40,220
[SPEAKER_19]: In San Diego, they have an 80s and 90s radio station.

795
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,281
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the best of both decades.

796
01:11:45,062 --> 01:11:45,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

797
01:11:47,023 --> 01:11:50,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Popular when I get Grand Theft Auto tomorrow.

798
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,695
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, anyway, anyway, we're getting way off subject.

799
01:11:53,035 --> 01:11:54,016
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting way off subject.

800
01:11:54,637 --> 01:11:55,157
[SPEAKER_21]: Way off subject.

801
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:59,481
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go to Fisher Spooner versus Billy Splyer with Everybody Wants to Emerge.

802
01:11:59,561 --> 01:11:59,942
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy.

803
01:11:59,962 --> 01:12:05,587
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

804
01:12:27,233 --> 01:12:31,991
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need to be much.

805
01:12:32,967 --> 01:12:46,455
[SPEAKER_10]: From nothing you don't need to step away You don't need to emerge From nothing you don't need to step away Step away

806
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:04,369
Thanks for watching!

807
01:13:40,548 --> 01:13:52,974
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need to emerge from nothing You don't need to turn away Just one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more Everybody love me

808
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:36,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Feels good, looks good, sounds good, looks good, feels good too Feels good, looks good

809
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:55,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

810
01:15:43,268 --> 01:15:46,869
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Fisher Spooner vs. Billy Squire.

811
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,410
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody wants you to emerge.

812
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:52,611
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's emerge our decisions on that song.

813
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:52,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie.

814
01:15:53,451 --> 01:15:56,972
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I really like that mix of it.

815
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:00,333
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't quite what I had remembered it to be, but I still like it.

816
01:16:00,813 --> 01:16:02,514
[SPEAKER_16]: So it gets an A from me.

817
01:16:03,734 --> 01:16:05,735
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think I'm going to bring you next time?

818
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:13,274
[SPEAKER_22]: I was going to say, it samples an old song in there, because I've heard that old song at the raids before, I'm almost positive.

819
01:16:14,495 --> 01:16:22,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Emergence is really cool, the song itself, but I mean, I really like that mix, because it's a lot different than the original.

820
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:23,701
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

821
01:16:24,141 --> 01:16:24,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's go on.

822
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:25,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley.

823
01:16:26,162 --> 01:16:29,324
[SPEAKER_29]: I had no idea what the hell they were saying, and it filled me with, eh.

824
01:16:29,344 --> 01:16:31,065
[SPEAKER_29]: So I give it a five.

825
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:32,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki.

826
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:34,567
[SPEAKER_20]: I second the, eh.

827
01:16:35,308 --> 01:16:36,368
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just like, it...

828
01:16:38,112 --> 01:16:38,732
[SPEAKER_20]: It got annoying.

829
01:16:39,812 --> 01:16:42,093
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

830
01:16:43,013 --> 01:16:46,954
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, when I heard that song, I kind of thought, this might be like a Guitar Freaks fun song.

831
01:16:47,014 --> 01:16:48,194
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of funky.

832
01:16:48,234 --> 01:16:48,714
[SPEAKER_21]: I like it.

833
01:16:50,235 --> 01:16:51,475
[SPEAKER_14]: It was funky.

834
01:16:51,575 --> 01:16:51,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Seven.

835
01:16:52,515 --> 01:16:52,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel.

836
01:16:52,815 --> 01:16:55,036
[SPEAKER_14]: That was pretty cool.

837
01:16:56,836 --> 01:16:57,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven and a half.

838
01:16:58,976 --> 01:16:59,296
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

839
01:16:59,677 --> 01:17:01,437
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, our votes don't mean shit.

840
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:04,117
[SPEAKER_21]: It's your votes in the chat room that really decide this.

841
01:17:04,498 --> 01:17:06,458
[SPEAKER_21]: You got one more song that you can pick from.

842
01:17:07,506 --> 01:17:09,067
[SPEAKER_21]: God help us all, it's Loki's.

843
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:12,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, man.

844
01:17:12,868 --> 01:17:15,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I have a few things to win you over already.

845
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:17,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Not trance, and short.

846
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:23,033
[SPEAKER_19]: The other thing I forgot to mention I did this week was saw Team America World Police.

847
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:27,755
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is America, Fuck Yeah.

01:19:51,058 --> 01:19:58,262
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be a humorous song for about ten minutes and then if you don't write... It gets fixed.

864
01:19:59,463 --> 01:19:59,743
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

865
01:19:59,763 --> 01:20:01,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no desire to see the movie.

866
01:20:02,104 --> 01:20:02,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Fair enough.

867
01:20:02,484 --> 01:20:02,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Arcadian.

868
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:05,266
[SPEAKER_29]: Fuck maybe.

869
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:08,702
[SPEAKER_29]: I give it like a 7.5.

870
01:20:08,843 --> 01:20:11,143
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, Loki.

871
01:20:12,823 --> 01:20:13,583
[SPEAKER_19]: I give it a 10.

872
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:19,644
[SPEAKER_19]: I was specifically instructed by my girlfriend not to sing the song any longer, so I give it a 10.

873
01:20:21,325 --> 01:20:23,285
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope you don't sing that while you're trying to have sex.

874
01:20:24,045 --> 01:20:24,725
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck yeah!

875
01:20:24,745 --> 01:20:25,845
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck yeah!

876
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:27,226
[SPEAKER_21]: That's beyond!

877
01:20:30,886 --> 01:20:33,887
[SPEAKER_21]: I give that song the same score I'd give the movie, a 4.

878
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:34,987
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel.

879
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:38,379
[SPEAKER_21]: No, a four out of ten.

880
01:20:40,421 --> 01:20:41,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it was okay.

881
01:20:42,002 --> 01:20:43,903
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to see the movie last night.

882
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:44,984
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what's important.

883
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, five and a half.

884
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:50,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Go see what?

885
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:53,950
[SPEAKER_15]: You could go see a good movie instead.

886
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:54,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably.

887
01:20:58,293 --> 01:20:58,833
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously?

888
01:20:59,474 --> 01:21:02,796
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're going to go see a movie, go see The Grudge, but go on a school night where the kiddies can't go.

889
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:03,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

890
01:21:04,858 --> 01:21:05,118
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

891
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:09,381
[SPEAKER_21]: You've heard what we think, now it's time to hear what you think.

892
01:21:09,401 --> 01:21:15,183
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to decide tonight's winner from three brand new songs while Loki throws pens at me in anger of my score.

893
01:21:15,623 --> 01:21:18,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's hear a clip from all three songs you can vote for tonight.

894
01:21:18,544 --> 01:21:23,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number one you can vote for tonight is Reason by Ian Van Dow.

895
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:31,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Time has come to set things right.

896
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:35,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it worth another fight?

897
01:21:36,127 --> 01:21:42,710
[SPEAKER_21]: And song number two in tonight's cage match is Fisher Spooner vs. Billy Squire, Everybody Wants You To Emerge.

898
01:21:56,056 --> 01:22:00,878
[SPEAKER_21]: And song number three in tonight's cage match from the Team America World Police soundtrack, America, Fuck Yeah.

899
01:22:13,305 --> 01:22:15,446
[SPEAKER_21]: Place vote now.

900
01:22:15,566 --> 01:22:18,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

901
01:22:18,548 --> 01:22:22,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number one, song number two, or Sky number three.

902
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:24,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number three.

903
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Your votes can decide it all.

904
01:22:28,013 --> 01:22:35,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, you know the scary thing, though, about that Fuck Yeah song is it's actually, if you took out the lyrics, it kind of sounds like a Guitar Freak song.

905
01:22:35,437 --> 01:22:36,077
[SPEAKER_21]: It really does.

906
01:22:37,978 --> 01:22:38,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Like an old one.

907
01:22:39,873 --> 01:22:40,953
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, we're losing you there.

908
01:22:41,174 --> 01:22:42,054
[SPEAKER_21]: Adjust the bottom mic there.

909
01:22:42,334 --> 01:22:42,814
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

910
01:22:42,954 --> 01:22:43,174
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

911
01:22:43,214 --> 01:22:47,256
[SPEAKER_29]: Especially with the speeding up, like, bass drum part.

912
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:49,556
[SPEAKER_29]: Or kick drum or whatever.

913
01:22:49,937 --> 01:22:54,778
[SPEAKER_21]: Just like the little synthesizers and everything kind of make it... Yeah.

914
01:22:54,858 --> 01:22:57,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it makes it... It gives it that sound.

915
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:58,840
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

916
01:22:58,860 --> 01:22:59,960
[SPEAKER_29]: You know what it sounds like?

917
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,560
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like PBR.

918
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,241
[SPEAKER_29]: It's like PBR.

919
01:23:01,301 --> 01:23:02,881
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, the end of PBR, that's what it sounds like.

920
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:03,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind of.

921
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:04,422
[SPEAKER_29]: It sounds like PBR.

922
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:08,351
[SPEAKER_21]: God, I haven't heard Limousine in a long, long time.

923
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:09,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Limousine!

924
01:23:10,012 --> 01:23:10,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Strong bad.

925
01:23:13,834 --> 01:23:14,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, boy, oh, boy.

926
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:19,517
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't believe that this is the first time we've had to retire a song.

927
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:24,420
[SPEAKER_21]: You know we've been doing the cage match for almost two years now, and that's the first time we've had to retire a song?

928
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,581
[SPEAKER_21]: We actually haven't done the cage match since episode one.

929
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:31,003
[SPEAKER_21]: It was something we added to the show when we went three hours on episode 20, I think?

930
01:23:31,123 --> 01:23:32,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the show only used to be two hours.

931
01:23:33,745 --> 01:23:33,965
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

932
01:23:35,776 --> 01:23:39,277
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, what we're going to do now, we're going to try and get that connection that we had earlier.

933
01:23:39,357 --> 01:23:42,437
[SPEAKER_21]: We were trying to get frequency from the East Coast on the phone.

934
01:23:42,477 --> 01:23:43,998
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys, I'm sure you know this guy.

935
01:23:44,078 --> 01:23:48,419
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're on DDR Freak, if you're on Bomani Style, I think he's a mod on both those sites.

936
01:23:48,519 --> 01:23:50,099
[SPEAKER_21]: And he's definitely out there.

937
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:52,239
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're on the East Coast, you definitely, definitely know who this guy is.

938
01:23:52,259 --> 01:23:57,300
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to give him a call because we want to ask him some questions that were kind of spawned from last week's show.

939
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,021
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's have a look and see if we can get frequency on the show.

940
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:01,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

941
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:02,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, is this frequency?

942
01:24:03,602 --> 01:24:04,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

943
01:24:04,382 --> 01:24:05,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, how are you doing?

944
01:24:06,075 --> 01:24:06,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing okay.

945
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:07,216
[SPEAKER_21]: Fantastic.

946
01:24:07,236 --> 01:24:08,277
[SPEAKER_21]: The week was fine.

947
01:24:08,357 --> 01:24:08,897
[SPEAKER_21]: No problems there.

948
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:09,357
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, look at that.

949
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:10,738
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an appearance from the guy next door.

950
01:24:10,758 --> 01:24:11,098
[SPEAKER_21]: That's great.

951
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:41,060
[SPEAKER_23]: The guy next door has a ham radio, and I'd like to interfere with all the electronics in my house.

952
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,160
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess so.

953
01:25:05,098 --> 01:25:12,243
[SPEAKER_23]: The East Coast Tournament was... The tournament itself wasn't really a good tournament, in my opinion.

954
01:25:12,383 --> 01:25:20,868
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of the stuff just ran wrong and things weren't properly organized and things like that.

955
01:25:21,088 --> 01:25:30,535
[SPEAKER_23]: And we, after the entire thing was done with, we realized what the problems were and we're going to fix those for the next years and things like that.

956
01:25:30,635 --> 01:25:34,157
[SPEAKER_23]: But as publicity for DDR...

957
01:25:35,023 --> 01:25:35,824
[SPEAKER_23]: It's skyrocketed.

958
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:38,845
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, now this is... Now, we actually had a caller last week.

959
01:25:38,905 --> 01:25:39,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Zachu called in.

960
01:25:39,786 --> 01:25:51,953
[SPEAKER_21]: He said something about the crowds that had come to the DDR tournament were bigger than the ones for, what, the Blue Man Group and... Yeah, it's literally... You could literally pick any exhibition there.

961
01:25:51,993 --> 01:25:57,417
[SPEAKER_23]: Blue Man Group was there for an hour, and Ludacris and some other Def Jam artists were there for a little while.

962
01:25:58,277 --> 01:25:59,838
[SPEAKER_23]: Opie and Anthony were there for a little while.

963
01:25:59,858 --> 01:26:00,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's right.

964
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:01,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Opie and Anthony was the other one he mentioned.

965
01:26:02,554 --> 01:26:03,495
[SPEAKER_21]: They're hacks anyway.

966
01:26:03,555 --> 01:26:03,955
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm kidding.

967
01:26:21,024 --> 01:26:30,268
[SPEAKER_23]: because these people were representing, I don't know, XM Radio and other, you know, like Opie Ante was at XM Radio for like an hour or something like that.

968
01:26:30,308 --> 01:26:36,150
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, they had a crowd for a little while, you know, but, you know, you can only stay so long and listen to Opie Ante, I guess.

969
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:43,113
[SPEAKER_23]: But, yeah, everyone was, everyone just stayed and watched people step on arrows all day.

970
01:26:43,133 --> 01:26:43,793
[SPEAKER_23]: It was amazing.

971
01:26:43,893 --> 01:26:44,693
[SPEAKER_23]: It was truly amazing.

972
01:26:44,773 --> 01:26:45,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Even Perfect Attack?

973
01:26:46,514 --> 01:26:46,714
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

974
01:26:47,473 --> 01:26:49,434
[SPEAKER_23]: More so than Freestyle, actually.

975
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:54,137
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a lot of people watching Perfect Attack that were just like, wow, this is amazing how they do that.

976
01:26:55,317 --> 01:27:00,320
[SPEAKER_23]: And half the people are like, even though they don't know what they're doing, they still want to know how they do that.

977
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:11,026
[SPEAKER_23]: But publicity-wise, Sammy, the person who put these two women together, and myself made them up.

978
01:27:11,568 --> 01:27:16,112
[SPEAKER_23]: A whole bunch of contacts on Thursday because the press was the people who were allowed on Thursday.

979
01:27:16,352 --> 01:27:19,175
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to say, I bet a lot of press was at this event.

980
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:20,756
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, we had a lot of press.

981
01:27:23,959 --> 01:27:28,482
[SPEAKER_21]: So does this mean we can be looking forward to seeing DDR in the news anytime soon?

982
01:27:28,522 --> 01:27:29,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Or in the press?

983
01:27:29,403 --> 01:27:30,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Some big stuff?

984
01:27:32,165 --> 01:27:34,347
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe not in the news and the press.

985
01:27:34,988 --> 01:27:38,711
[SPEAKER_23]: There's already been enough stuff in the news and the press that it's in the wrong angle.

986
01:27:39,321 --> 01:27:40,101
[SPEAKER_21]: That's true.

987
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,442
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess that's very true.

988
01:27:42,082 --> 01:27:42,382
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

989
01:27:43,043 --> 01:27:46,784
[SPEAKER_23]: The problem is that the angle is way lost.

990
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:50,005
[SPEAKER_23]: Everyone likes that way lost angle, and everyone jumps on that.

991
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:51,866
[SPEAKER_23]: I was at Fox News a couple weeks ago.

992
01:27:52,186 --> 01:27:56,208
[SPEAKER_21]: I was actually going to ask you about that, the Fox News thing.

993
01:27:56,408 --> 01:27:57,609
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll tell you exactly what happened.

994
01:27:57,629 --> 01:28:02,170
[SPEAKER_23]: What they did was, on Friday night, I get a call from these people.

995
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:04,331
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm like, yeah, sure, I'll come in.

996
01:28:04,351 --> 01:28:05,512
[SPEAKER_23]: They just want DDR.

997
01:28:05,552 --> 01:28:06,972
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm like, okay, I could do DDR.

998
01:28:07,473 --> 01:28:08,253
[SPEAKER_23]: So I come in.

999
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:13,516
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, next day, because that's when they want me for the interview, live, next day.

1000
01:28:13,776 --> 01:28:14,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1001
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:18,421
[SPEAKER_23]: With no preparation, uh, I'm sitting in the briefing room, not getting briefs.

1002
01:28:18,841 --> 01:28:24,146
[SPEAKER_23]: I was actually sitting next to the person who was interviewing me, and I had absolutely no idea, until, like, I was actually called in.

1003
01:28:24,947 --> 01:28:25,207
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

1004
01:28:25,408 --> 01:28:30,072
[SPEAKER_23]: And once, when I got into the studio, the first thing the girl says is, well, you're not a kid.

1005
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:32,695
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm like, no, sorry.

1006
01:28:33,533 --> 01:28:35,473
[SPEAKER_23]: Someone should have probably informed you about something, too.

1007
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:37,694
[SPEAKER_21]: They thought they were getting a 12-year-old?

1008
01:28:38,134 --> 01:28:42,995
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, they thought a 12-year-old was going to end up coming in and doing an interview.

1009
01:28:43,095 --> 01:28:54,377
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember that, because we were watching the clip here in studio during a show about a month ago, and we were having a little fun with how bad the interviewer was, the person who was interviewing you, and it sounded like she was talking down to you.

1010
01:28:54,817 --> 01:29:00,078
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of the questions she was asking, I remember, didn't she say at one point in the interview, gosh, how old are you?

1011
01:29:00,822 --> 01:29:10,207
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I was 21, but the thing that got me the most was when she said, you're part of the DDR freaks, and I'm like... Yeah, that bug does too.

1012
01:29:10,347 --> 01:29:11,087
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you serious?

1013
01:29:11,407 --> 01:29:12,528
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you serious?

1014
01:29:12,628 --> 01:29:13,708
[SPEAKER_23]: What are you doing to me right now?

1015
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:15,329
[SPEAKER_21]: It's obvious they hadn't done any research.

1016
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:28,856
[SPEAKER_23]: So, like, I mean, I'm doing it for DDR, you know, to get the publicity up there for it, so even though it's just the wrong angle for it, I mean, I tried to jump onto, you know, the competition thing, she just tossed it right off of that, so...

1017
01:29:29,795 --> 01:29:31,136
[SPEAKER_23]: Regardless, they're not ready for it.

1018
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:31,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1019
01:29:33,337 --> 01:29:36,938
[SPEAKER_23]: But, you know, upcoming now... Wait, actually, I have a quick question for you.

1020
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:38,479
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a quick question for you, though, before we change the subject.

1021
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you think that part of that might be Konami's fault?

1022
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:43,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Because Konami's kind of going the way Los Angles with this?

1023
01:29:46,983 --> 01:29:49,203
[SPEAKER_23]: Um... Konami hasn't done much.

1024
01:29:50,644 --> 01:29:51,444
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll tell you right now.

1025
01:29:51,564 --> 01:29:54,306
[SPEAKER_23]: They haven't done much in the publicity of DER.

1026
01:29:54,466 --> 01:29:54,706
[SPEAKER_23]: They...

1027
01:29:55,706 --> 01:30:02,987
[SPEAKER_23]: and they don't really need to because it just so happens that mixes keep selling, home mixes at least, keep selling.

1028
01:30:03,407 --> 01:30:04,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Word of mouth is a powerful thing.

1029
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,968
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it just happens.

1030
01:30:08,448 --> 01:30:12,449
[SPEAKER_23]: People see these dance mats in the game stores and they're like, oh, what does that go with?

1031
01:30:12,509 --> 01:30:16,090
[SPEAKER_23]: And they go with this DPR game and they buy it and take it home.

1032
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:23,651
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's a lot of people who actually play at home and they just don't know about the community behind it and its competition and how big this can really be.

1033
01:30:24,858 --> 01:30:30,703
[SPEAKER_23]: So, Konami really actually doesn't do much, but this upcoming year, you might see some stuff coming out.

1034
01:30:31,023 --> 01:30:31,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1035
01:30:31,403 --> 01:30:33,465
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess other little things you probably can't talk about?

1036
01:30:35,026 --> 01:30:42,271
[SPEAKER_23]: I can talk about them, it's just that a lot of the stuff is, you know... You don't want to say anything and then not have it happen?

1037
01:30:43,492 --> 01:30:46,395
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll say what we want to do, I'll say what we're planning.

1038
01:30:47,135 --> 01:30:47,495
[SPEAKER_23]: Cool.

1039
01:30:47,716 --> 01:30:48,236
[SPEAKER_23]: First off...

1040
01:30:49,315 --> 01:30:56,100
[SPEAKER_23]: First off, Sammy and I have a meeting with Ziff Davis Media tomorrow at 11 a.m.

1041
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Aren't Ziff Davis Media the folks that run G4 Tech TV?

1042
01:30:59,943 --> 01:31:00,563
[SPEAKER_23]: They might be.

1043
01:31:00,623 --> 01:31:03,626
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not too sure about the whole business.

1044
01:31:04,406 --> 01:31:10,491
[SPEAKER_23]: But I know that these are the people who put together the actual convention last weekend.

1045
01:31:10,711 --> 01:31:11,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, okay.

1046
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:17,976
[SPEAKER_23]: And they got Microsoft and XM and Intel and Best Buy and all those other companies to come down and, you know...

1047
01:31:19,088 --> 01:31:20,729
[SPEAKER_23]: and so on.

1048
01:31:20,929 --> 01:31:28,792
[SPEAKER_23]: They were so interested in our place that they want us to set up the next year's tournament now with sponsors.

1049
01:31:31,374 --> 01:31:37,196
[SPEAKER_23]: They want all these companies that came to the convention to help sponsor us in whatever way possible.

1050
01:31:37,616 --> 01:31:41,558
[SPEAKER_23]: We're looking at a really big grand prize at the end of it.

1051
01:31:42,879 --> 01:31:45,440
[SPEAKER_23]: No real dollar amount has been set.

1052
01:31:46,082 --> 01:31:52,087
[SPEAKER_23]: We're looking at something huge, something enough to get many more people to end up coming out.

1053
01:31:53,308 --> 01:31:57,492
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is coming off the heels of a $1,000 grand prize tournament, correct?

1054
01:31:57,992 --> 01:31:58,193
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1055
01:31:58,253 --> 01:31:59,414
[SPEAKER_21]: And you guys are talking about something bigger?

1056
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:00,454
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

1057
01:32:00,675 --> 01:32:00,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

1058
01:32:01,856 --> 01:32:03,677
[SPEAKER_23]: Very nice.

1059
01:32:03,717 --> 01:32:10,423
[SPEAKER_23]: The $1,000 was actually put up by Sammy, but if we have people like Microsoft who want to put up

1060
01:32:10,914 --> 01:32:11,194
[SPEAKER_23]: and so on.

1061
01:32:30,807 --> 01:32:35,071
[SPEAKER_23]: Another meeting I have coming up soon is with Fuse TV.

1062
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:36,573
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if you guys get that out there.

1063
01:32:37,293 --> 01:32:38,654
[SPEAKER_21]: They used to be Much Music, right?

1064
01:32:38,694 --> 01:32:39,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Weren't they Much Music?

1065
01:32:39,755 --> 01:32:40,756
[SPEAKER_21]: And then they turned into Fuse?

1066
01:32:41,177 --> 01:32:42,398
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that sounds about right.

1067
01:32:42,438 --> 01:32:43,919
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's a subscription channel out here.

1068
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:44,980
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1069
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:45,781
[SPEAKER_21]: But I've heard of them.

1070
01:32:45,801 --> 01:32:50,104
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I have a producer contact that I actually made.

1071
01:32:50,245 --> 01:32:51,666
[SPEAKER_23]: He absolutely adores the game.

1072
01:32:51,706 --> 01:32:54,328
[SPEAKER_23]: He just found it on Thursday when he showed up.

1073
01:32:54,949 --> 01:32:56,430
[SPEAKER_23]: And he absolutely adores the game.

1074
01:32:57,483 --> 01:33:07,570
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a meeting with him in a couple of weeks and we're going to pitch an idea, both together, to Fuse about a weekly DDR show.

1075
01:33:08,211 --> 01:33:09,732
[SPEAKER_21]: A weekly DDR show?

1076
01:33:09,972 --> 01:33:10,893
[SPEAKER_23]: Weekly, right.

1077
01:33:10,913 --> 01:33:14,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Not some kind of DDR special you're talking about like a weekly DDR show?

1078
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:16,517
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, exactly.

1079
01:33:16,737 --> 01:33:22,881
[SPEAKER_23]: We're probably looking at, like the only idea was that so far that I've had was a weekly tournament.

1080
01:33:24,124 --> 01:33:27,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Is this the OMG DDR game show that people have talked about for years?

1081
01:33:29,007 --> 01:33:30,187
[SPEAKER_23]: I've never heard of that, actually.

1082
01:33:31,568 --> 01:33:37,231
[SPEAKER_21]: I see these threads occasionally on the message board where they're like, OMG DDR game show type thing, could DDR be a game show?

1083
01:33:37,971 --> 01:33:52,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe it's just that it's a couple years ago, and I'm... I don't know, it just seems like I've seen these kind of ideas going around before where people are like, OMG, they should have a DDR TV show and stuff, and now you're saying that that's exactly what you're going to go pitch in a couple weeks.

1084
01:33:53,774 --> 01:33:55,975
[SPEAKER_23]: It's probably not going to end up being a game show.

1085
01:33:56,055 --> 01:34:02,920
[SPEAKER_23]: It's going to be something like... Do you remember... I don't even know if you guys have this out here.

1086
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,662
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you guys remember when they had this thing called the WMCA Championships?

1087
01:34:07,222 --> 01:34:08,723
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a martial arts championship.

1088
01:34:10,006 --> 01:34:11,346
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually remember this.

1089
01:34:11,386 --> 01:34:13,247
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a lot like the WWF, except it was karate.

1090
01:34:13,267 --> 01:34:14,667
[SPEAKER_23]: I do remember seeing a couple episodes of this.

1091
01:34:14,687 --> 01:34:15,988
[SPEAKER_23]: It used to be on Channel 31, remember?

1092
01:34:16,008 --> 01:34:17,948
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I want to do something similar to that.

1093
01:34:17,968 --> 01:34:21,969
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, like, porno ends up meeting the real world in MTV kind of thing.

1094
01:34:36,309 --> 01:34:36,950
[SPEAKER_20]: and many more.

1095
01:34:57,714 --> 01:35:24,375
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, we're not gonna, we're gonna, you know, we're probably gonna show how people train, and maybe do some interviews, and maybe some little cute skits in there, but a lot of it's gonna be in the, uh, in my, you know, my thing, we're gonna actually just end up doing, like, a weekly tournament, you know, like Red Team vs. Blue Team, you know, try to ham it up for a little while, maybe like a BattleBots kind of thing, where every, like, month we end up doing a championship, or every few months or something like that, and they get some kind of crazy trophy that we, like, you know, pass around.

1096
01:35:24,755 --> 01:35:25,276
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1097
01:35:25,296 --> 01:35:26,377
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you guys think...

1098
01:35:29,545 --> 01:35:31,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you guys think you would run into any resistance from Konami?

1099
01:35:32,926 --> 01:35:34,067
[SPEAKER_23]: Funny you bring that up.

1100
01:35:34,427 --> 01:35:41,830
[SPEAKER_23]: Sammy actually got a call last week from someone from Konami who happens to actually end up being the VP.

1101
01:35:43,951 --> 01:35:48,813
[SPEAKER_23]: The VP is very, very interested in sponsoring the tournament in 2005.

1102
01:35:49,514 --> 01:35:50,494
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

1103
01:35:50,894 --> 01:35:55,096
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, and considering now that we have this contact here, which is going to be...

1104
01:35:55,842 --> 01:35:56,483
[SPEAKER_23]: and many more.

1105
01:36:13,069 --> 01:36:15,991
[SPEAKER_23]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1106
01:36:40,009 --> 01:36:49,855
[SPEAKER_23]: EDR comes up on the television, maybe ESPN or whatever, and everyone knows what a great is and how many greats a JSB gets on this song.

1107
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:59,361
[SPEAKER_23]: Everyone knows the stats and knows the players and roots for their favorite team, like the New York Blue Impulse versus the California Trip Machines or whatever.

1108
01:37:00,742 --> 01:37:01,642
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what we're looking to do.

1109
01:37:01,802 --> 01:37:04,584
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a hell of a goal, but that's a neat goal.

1110
01:37:06,465 --> 01:37:08,026
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, you look like you want to say something here.

1111
01:37:08,851 --> 01:37:09,791
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what we're pushing for.

1112
01:37:10,431 --> 01:37:14,192
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to expect that there's going to be a huge jump in publicity in this next coming year.

1113
01:37:14,492 --> 01:37:15,132
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope so.

1114
01:37:15,372 --> 01:37:16,673
[SPEAKER_19]: But, like, you know, I don't know.

1115
01:37:16,733 --> 01:37:24,054
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems like it's going to be about as popular as Extreme Dodgeball or, you know, everything like that.

1116
01:37:24,454 --> 01:37:28,155
[SPEAKER_23]: It might end up being looking like that, at least for this first year coming.

1117
01:37:28,815 --> 01:37:38,097
[SPEAKER_23]: But with a lot of the more context that we're getting, you know, especially Konami, it looks like there might be more push for it.

1118
01:37:39,144 --> 01:37:49,293
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, considering it's a new genre of video game, it's already a sport in Norway, you know, so it's got potential.

1119
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:54,618
[SPEAKER_19]: It reminds me though of like that webcomic that's 10K Commotion or whatever.

1120
01:37:55,098 --> 01:37:59,943
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just like, you know, with all the DDR drama and then you have the teams competing in a giant like tournament thing.

1121
01:38:00,243 --> 01:38:02,005
[SPEAKER_19]: It just, it seems a lot like that.

1122
01:38:02,165 --> 01:38:04,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Not that it's a bad idea, I think it's a pretty cool idea.

1123
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:07,322
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you know, there's drama everywhere.

1124
01:38:07,342 --> 01:38:13,123
[SPEAKER_23]: There's drama in Sublubrities and stuff like that, so it's not going to be, you know, more common.

1125
01:38:13,363 --> 01:38:22,226
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll tell you what, if you ever want to take the DDR drama angle with this show, like Degrassi DDR League or whatever, I could give you pages and pages of real-life fire drama.

1126
01:38:22,246 --> 01:38:23,786
[SPEAKER_23]: No, no, I don't have pages and pages.

1127
01:38:23,926 --> 01:38:27,107
[SPEAKER_23]: I think just about everyone knows I have pages and pages.

1128
01:38:27,127 --> 01:38:29,288
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, getting out of the tournament last week, I, you know...

1129
01:38:30,094 --> 01:38:35,236
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of the people actually ended up thanking, you know, Sammy for putting together the tournament, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1130
01:38:35,796 --> 01:38:40,157
[SPEAKER_23]: And to tell you the truth, Sammy screwed up a lot of things about the tournament.

1131
01:38:40,637 --> 01:38:46,879
[SPEAKER_23]: And there were a lot of things that if he was more prepared, he would have actually ended up, you know, doing a better work with it.

1132
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:50,820
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, and I ended up trying to fix a lot of the behind-the-scenes and things like that.

1133
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,261
[SPEAKER_23]: And a lot of people don't even remember me being there.

1134
01:38:53,721 --> 01:38:57,522
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, and it's annoying to one extent, and it's not...

1135
01:38:58,171 --> 01:39:06,256
[SPEAKER_23]: Too bad in another, because, you know, I kind of don't want to be attached to the tournament, because of the tournament being actually too bad, and I'm more attached to what happened otherwise.

1136
01:39:07,116 --> 01:39:19,383
[SPEAKER_23]: But, I mean, there was this one incident during freestyle where a team element from upstate New York came in to do the routine, obviously, to DICE.

1137
01:39:20,584 --> 01:39:25,967
[SPEAKER_23]: And what happened was, they went up for the first time, and Sammy wasn't ready with the camera.

1138
01:39:27,142 --> 01:39:32,964
[SPEAKER_23]: So Sammy says, wait, wait, wait, and tells one of the other staff members to reset the machine while they're at mid-play.

1139
01:39:33,185 --> 01:39:36,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, not mid-play, but they actually got into about 10 seconds of the routine.

1140
01:39:37,606 --> 01:39:39,907
[SPEAKER_23]: So Sammy goes, oh, I didn't know they started already.

1141
01:39:39,927 --> 01:39:40,608
[SPEAKER_23]: That would have been fine.

1142
01:39:40,648 --> 01:39:41,248
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't worry about it.

1143
01:39:41,668 --> 01:39:42,368
[SPEAKER_23]: Just start up again.

1144
01:39:42,728 --> 01:39:43,829
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're like, OK, fine.

1145
01:39:43,989 --> 01:39:44,909
[SPEAKER_23]: So they start up again.

1146
01:39:45,089 --> 01:39:47,190
[SPEAKER_23]: And the problem here was that they forgot Mirror.

1147
01:39:47,811 --> 01:39:49,971
[SPEAKER_23]: And we actually ended up forgetting to put Event Mode on.

1148
01:39:50,392 --> 01:39:52,713
[SPEAKER_23]: But that wouldn't have mattered if they wouldn't have failed.

1149
01:39:53,833 --> 01:39:56,134
[SPEAKER_23]: So what happened was they ended up actually failing

1150
01:39:56,661 --> 01:40:00,782
[SPEAKER_23]: Halfway through the song, you know, the fail screen comes up because they forgot to put Mirror on.

1151
01:40:01,122 --> 01:40:01,502
Bummer.

1152
01:40:02,302 --> 01:40:02,583
[SPEAKER_23]: You know.

1153
01:40:03,483 --> 01:40:11,805
[SPEAKER_23]: So then they go ahead and they're like, oh, what the fuck, you know, we had it right the first time, blah blah blah, and then we're like, okay, you know, we'll just go again and we'll figure out something later.

1154
01:40:11,845 --> 01:40:19,307
[SPEAKER_23]: So they went again, they finished their routine, you know, and we figured out, you know, I was, right in the beginning, I said they're disqualified.

1155
01:40:19,467 --> 01:40:23,648
[SPEAKER_23]: And the reason I said that was because

1156
01:40:24,508 --> 01:40:27,631
[SPEAKER_23]: When you do a routine, everything about the routine is routine.

1157
01:40:28,552 --> 01:40:35,798
[SPEAKER_23]: When you put options on, when you put your clothes on, when you do the routine, everything is routine.

1158
01:40:35,879 --> 01:40:40,563
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no real excuse of not putting an option on.

1159
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:44,246
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're saying the second they turn the machine over to you, it's routine time?

1160
01:40:44,927 --> 01:40:46,148
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, exactly.

1161
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:50,312
[SPEAKER_23]: Once you have the option of choosing a song, making your options, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1162
01:40:51,354 --> 01:40:56,421
[SPEAKER_23]: It's routine to you, and it's part of the routine that's going to come out on the show to us.

1163
01:40:56,541 --> 01:40:56,921
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1164
01:40:57,622 --> 01:41:06,174
[SPEAKER_21]: I can see why you're coming from that angle, though, because a lot of what you just talked to us about, about this DDR TV show and stuff, you kind of were talking a little bit about kind of the hype

1165
01:41:06,554 --> 01:41:10,756
[SPEAKER_21]: There's also a lot of the problem that people just aren't prepared for freestyle anymore.

1166
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:32,241
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no real big pot for freestyle anymore.

1167
01:41:32,481 --> 01:41:34,322
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, everyone wants the expert tech.

1168
01:41:34,383 --> 01:41:35,643
[SPEAKER_23]: No one really freestyles.

1169
01:41:35,703 --> 01:41:37,665
[SPEAKER_23]: No one really thinks they're good at freestyle.

1170
01:41:37,765 --> 01:41:39,146
[SPEAKER_23]: People think they're good at freestyle.

1171
01:41:39,206 --> 01:41:39,987
[SPEAKER_23]: They really aren't.

1172
01:41:40,367 --> 01:41:47,092
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, it's just like, there's not a lot of people that jump out there, get the job done, you know, and look awesome doing it.

1173
01:41:47,332 --> 01:41:48,893
[SPEAKER_23]: At least out here I've seen it.

1174
01:41:49,253 --> 01:41:55,418
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, people just, you know, don't put themselves together and make a good routine.

1175
01:41:55,970 --> 01:42:06,157
[SPEAKER_23]: To tell you the truth, when I did the Sports World Tournament two years back for Drifting Away, I actually was planning to do insertion for a month.

1176
01:42:06,577 --> 01:42:13,942
[SPEAKER_23]: I did this routine for about three, three and a half weeks, putting together every step, every arrow, how to move to a blah, blah, blah.

1177
01:42:15,363 --> 01:42:20,266
[SPEAKER_23]: And at the end of it all, about three or four days before the competition, I scrapped the whole thing.

1178
01:42:20,907 --> 01:42:21,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1179
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:26,953
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't even know why, I think I just got sick of it, or whatever, and I ended up doing Drifting Away.

1180
01:42:27,673 --> 01:42:35,177
[SPEAKER_23]: The day before, I literally slapped together, won the whole tournament, and that was the story about that.

1181
01:42:35,197 --> 01:42:42,380
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know, the practice of building the other routine, though, probably kind of helped in making the second routine, right?

1182
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:44,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you end up taking elements of your insertion routine?

1183
01:42:46,762 --> 01:42:48,083
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I don't know, like,

1184
01:42:48,587 --> 01:42:50,728
[SPEAKER_23]: There was more leeway with drifting away.

1185
01:42:50,768 --> 01:42:52,429
[SPEAKER_23]: Drifting away is such a trickle, no freeze.

1186
01:42:52,449 --> 01:42:55,250
[SPEAKER_23]: It has no arrows for the first half of it.

1187
01:42:56,810 --> 01:43:00,072
[SPEAKER_23]: You'll see me get off the pad and do whatever for a while.

1188
01:43:00,092 --> 01:43:02,473
[SPEAKER_23]: I had more freedom to do what I wanted with insertion.

1189
01:43:02,493 --> 01:43:03,693
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a whole lot of arrows.

1190
01:43:03,753 --> 01:43:07,375
[SPEAKER_23]: I just loved the saw insertion, but the problem was there were so many arrows.

1191
01:43:07,435 --> 01:43:11,916
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a lot of stuff to work with, and there was a big risk of me failing.

1192
01:43:11,976 --> 01:43:18,239
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't like the total big risk of failing, at least back when I was actually competing.

1193
01:43:18,658 --> 01:43:23,060
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, no, I might be competing soon because of the tournament last week.

1194
01:43:23,441 --> 01:43:32,306
[SPEAKER_23]: What happened was Sketch and Visor had a first place routine, and it was a phenomenal routine.

1195
01:43:32,426 --> 01:43:41,391
[SPEAKER_23]: They got inspired through a lot of my stuff, but I kind of got inspired to go ahead and beat their routine with something that I'll come out with later.

1196
01:43:41,511 --> 01:43:45,713
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have ideas in my head that are jumping around, and I can't really tell...

1197
01:43:46,638 --> 01:43:50,599
[SPEAKER_23]: Not because I don't want to, but because I'm not sure when I'm going to compete.

1198
01:43:51,960 --> 01:44:01,743
[SPEAKER_23]: But I want it to be in a place that we're going to tape it and show it online, unlike the dropout freestyle that's still sitting on my side and no one knows what it looks like, not even me.

1199
01:44:03,044 --> 01:44:04,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Very interesting.

1200
01:44:04,945 --> 01:44:06,485
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's my plans.

1201
01:44:07,225 --> 01:44:13,808
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a lot of video publicity and I guess some freestyle on a personal note.

1202
01:44:13,828 --> 01:44:14,328
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1203
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:32,325
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I know we've been taking up a lot of your time here, but I do have one other question I want to ask you, because it has to do with something that the caller last week had brought up, about hearing something about, and I don't know if you can confirm or deny this, but he had said something about DDR maybe going out on tour with a rap artist.

1204
01:44:33,085 --> 01:44:35,486
[SPEAKER_23]: Is this a load of crap, or what is it?

1205
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:39,927
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, actually, before we go to that, I'll tell you one thing that's up on Thursday.

1206
01:44:39,967 --> 01:44:42,488
[SPEAKER_23]: Spike TV came up to us and said,

1207
01:44:42,907 --> 01:44:44,368
[SPEAKER_23]: said, is it DDR Machine for Rentals?

1208
01:44:44,388 --> 01:44:49,231
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're like, well, yeah, because DDR Machine Rentals, that's one of the companies that was obviously Sammy's.

1209
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:49,691
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1210
01:44:50,491 --> 01:45:01,978
[SPEAKER_23]: And they go, oh, because we have this video game award show that happens in California.

1211
01:45:02,198 --> 01:45:02,678
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

1212
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:07,181
[SPEAKER_21]: We talked about this on one of our other shows, the Spike TV's first annual show, yeah.

1213
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:09,982
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, they want the DDR Machine at the after party.

1214
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:11,043
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

1215
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:20,732
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so, but the problem is it's kind of out of the range, and, you know, because obviously that's the west coast, and the east coast, and it's a very long haul for that DVR machine.

1216
01:45:21,032 --> 01:45:21,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1217
01:45:21,352 --> 01:45:32,214
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, on Sammy's own, because Sammy only has like a coverage range, and outside the coverage range is a lot of, a lot of, you know, money involved to try to get it out of that.

1218
01:45:32,514 --> 01:45:33,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

1219
01:45:33,754 --> 01:45:40,835
[SPEAKER_23]: But on to the rap artists, so basically what happened was, we were in the middle of the tour month, out of a ludicrous and

1220
01:45:41,434 --> 01:45:43,415
[SPEAKER_23]: and the film label were there.

1221
01:45:43,515 --> 01:45:48,698
[SPEAKER_23]: And someone noticed it, obviously, because it was actually probably on the other side of the screen.

1222
01:45:49,698 --> 01:45:52,340
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, ludicrous, it was probably on the other side of the curtain from where we were.

1223
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,301
[SPEAKER_23]: And I actually ended up seeing them.

1224
01:45:54,341 --> 01:46:11,009
[SPEAKER_23]: But someone, a representative from their production label, came up specifically to me, because it looked like I was doing, and they're like, and they asked me, is this, you know, for rent, or is there even a possibility of taking the machine on tour?

1225
01:46:12,009 --> 01:46:16,875
[SPEAKER_23]: and uh... you know, I was like, wow, you know, you want to have this thing on tour?

1226
01:46:16,975 --> 01:46:19,238
[SPEAKER_23]: That's pretty cool, you know, you can talk to Sammy.

1227
01:46:19,719 --> 01:46:22,823
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, so the person from Ludacris...

1228
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:29,693
[SPEAKER_23]: production label is asking for the DDR Machine to be on tour with them sometime next spring or summer.

1229
01:46:30,133 --> 01:46:30,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1230
01:46:31,273 --> 01:46:33,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, what I'd be curious about, though, is it on tour?

1231
01:46:33,454 --> 01:46:40,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you know how sometimes the big celebrities with their rock and roll lifestyle, or in this case, rap lifestyle, they've got all the stuff that they have in their trailer and stuff.

1232
01:46:40,578 --> 01:46:45,480
[SPEAKER_21]: Is this DDR Machine for him to be using in his posse, or is it something he wants to have out there?

1233
01:46:46,081 --> 01:46:47,541
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no idea what he wants to do with it.

1234
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:51,043
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just the fact, you know, it's just kind of funny that he wants it, you know.

1235
01:46:52,123 --> 01:46:53,264
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the thing that, like, you know,

1236
01:46:53,843 --> 01:46:58,085
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, jumped on it, like, I mean, Sammy has that contact information, I don't know what they're doing with that.

1237
01:46:58,205 --> 01:47:03,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, because when I think about famous pairs, I don't really envision Ludacris and DDR, but whatever floats your boat.

1238
01:47:04,128 --> 01:47:08,010
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what, you're going to see a lot of stupid stuff soon, I'm going to tell you right now.

1239
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:15,233
[SPEAKER_23]: There's going to be people in the sporting industry playing DDR, I'm positive, it's just going to happen once it gets big.

1240
01:47:15,593 --> 01:47:20,035
[SPEAKER_21]: Good, we need more stuff to make fun of here on our little program, so bring on all the silly stuff.

1241
01:47:20,616 --> 01:47:23,077
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh yeah, there'll be plenty of silly stuff coming, I'm sure of it.

1242
01:47:24,542 --> 01:47:32,624
[SPEAKER_23]: But like I said, people will know once the show, if it actually ends up happening, the weekly show, people will know.

1243
01:47:32,644 --> 01:47:37,465
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll both be on DVR Freak and be MontyStyle because I obviously am both affiliated with both sites.

1244
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:47,667
[SPEAKER_23]: So you will find out through both of those sites that something will be going down at any point in time, whether it be the 2005 huge tournament or, you know,

1245
01:47:50,491 --> 01:47:51,032
[SPEAKER_23]: and so on.

1246
01:48:14,042 --> 01:48:17,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely a lot of very interesting stuff it sounds like you've got coming up in the future.

1247
01:48:17,183 --> 01:48:22,163
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'll expect something good is going to happen next year.

1248
01:48:26,684 --> 01:48:32,385
[SPEAKER_23]: There's even talk, I don't even know if I want to say this, people are probably going to jump out of their seats.

1249
01:48:32,985 --> 01:48:42,647
[SPEAKER_23]: Because of the media that we've received and this call from Konami that we also got, this big uproar that actually happened in only a week or so,

1250
01:48:44,099 --> 01:48:47,581
[SPEAKER_23]: We have the possibility of requesting a new arcade mix.

1251
01:48:49,221 --> 01:48:50,542
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm jumping out of my seat!

1252
01:48:51,803 --> 01:48:52,323
[SPEAKER_23]: You're right.

1253
01:48:53,764 --> 01:48:54,564
[SPEAKER_23]: No, we're okay.

1254
01:48:54,604 --> 01:48:58,346
[SPEAKER_23]: People are now like, the people are like, now they're like, wait a minute, wait, what did he just say?

1255
01:48:58,386 --> 01:48:59,106
[SPEAKER_23]: A new arcade mix?

1256
01:48:59,286 --> 01:49:01,908
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly, here it is, though.

1257
01:49:02,108 --> 01:49:02,948
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what, though?

1258
01:49:03,048 --> 01:49:03,608
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's the thing.

1259
01:49:03,748 --> 01:49:05,369
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm scared of this being wolf.

1260
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:07,850
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not definite, okay?

1261
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:11,172
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not something that's like, wow, okay, we're really doing this.

1262
01:49:11,612 --> 01:49:13,133
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a possibility because...

1263
01:49:14,539 --> 01:49:25,661
[SPEAKER_23]: America's now finding out about DDR, and it's a real big thing now that at this convention that happened, the public's like, wow, DDR?

1264
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:27,321
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, wow, this is an amazing game.

1265
01:49:27,501 --> 01:49:29,142
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, wow, let's put this thing on TV.

1266
01:49:29,162 --> 01:49:30,682
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to push it, push it, push it.

1267
01:49:31,202 --> 01:49:32,982
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're going to be bootleg illegal mixes.

1268
01:49:33,723 --> 01:49:34,683
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, right?

1269
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:40,844
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, because Konami's going to notice this, obviously, because they called us, they're going to...

1270
01:49:41,914 --> 01:49:46,059
[SPEAKER_23]: We hope they're going to help us out and show us, here, look, we got a new arcade mix for you.

1271
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:47,020
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, how does that sound?

1272
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:49,183
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1273
01:49:50,725 --> 01:49:53,308
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki is convinced it's not going to happen.

1274
01:49:54,109 --> 01:49:54,489
[SPEAKER_23]: What's that?

1275
01:49:54,669 --> 01:49:56,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki is convinced over here it's not going to happen.

1276
01:49:57,933 --> 01:49:58,975
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you know what?

1277
01:49:59,155 --> 01:49:59,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Prove him wrong.

1278
01:50:00,598 --> 01:50:08,323
[SPEAKER_23]: Some of us gave up on thinking that another one was going to come out, and some of us were like, I hope there's something else that comes out.

1279
01:50:08,783 --> 01:50:16,527
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there's obviously people out there that are still steadfast, and I know Extreme 2 is coming, I know it's coming.

1280
01:50:17,948 --> 01:50:27,934
[SPEAKER_23]: So me and Sammy, because of the love of the game, want to push for the new arcade mix to come out, because the USA stuff is kind of like...

1281
01:50:30,023 --> 01:50:36,485
[SPEAKER_23]: Sleepy, and PutTogetherBadly, and Spell of Marvelous is with two L's, and things like that.

1282
01:50:36,585 --> 01:50:49,968
[SPEAKER_23]: So we want to see a new arcade mix put together, and even if it ends up being a home version like Six Fix was, still something else that's not in the group.

1283
01:50:49,988 --> 01:50:50,228
[SPEAKER_23]: Definitely.

1284
01:50:50,408 --> 01:50:53,349
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's my advice to you, though.

1285
01:50:57,225 --> 01:51:01,329
[SPEAKER_21]: If Konami's going to do it, make sure Hawaii's involved.

1286
01:51:01,509 --> 01:51:02,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Hawaii?

1287
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:04,431
[SPEAKER_21]: Konami Hawaii, the folks that did Ultramix 2.

1288
01:51:05,012 --> 01:51:05,692
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, no.

1289
01:51:06,133 --> 01:51:07,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god, you've got to be kidding me.

1290
01:51:07,274 --> 01:51:08,374
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not a fan of Ultramix 2?

1291
01:51:09,075 --> 01:51:09,936
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me tell you right now.

1292
01:51:10,536 --> 01:51:14,560
[SPEAKER_23]: When Ultramix 1 came out, I thought it was all Tornamix.

1293
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:23,287
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought Tornamix decided to go ahead and put together a mix from Hawaii and send it out to people.

1294
01:51:24,609 --> 01:51:38,059
[SPEAKER_23]: Looking at Ready Steady Go, when the thing speeds up to 280 BPM for absolutely no reason, you have all these songs in here that, you know, Quickening is a six-footer?

1295
01:51:38,099 --> 01:51:38,880
[SPEAKER_23]: How do you do that?

1296
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,702
[SPEAKER_23]: How do you put Quickening as a six-footer?

1297
01:51:42,442 --> 01:51:43,043
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give you that.

1298
01:51:43,103 --> 01:51:43,603
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give you that.

1299
01:51:43,623 --> 01:51:46,065
[SPEAKER_23]: You got a good point.

1300
01:51:46,105 --> 01:51:47,986
[SPEAKER_23]: How do you do that?

1301
01:51:48,046 --> 01:51:52,409
[SPEAKER_23]: So with Ultramix 2 coming out, what's on there?

1302
01:51:52,449 --> 01:51:53,390
[SPEAKER_23]: Is Maximizer on there?

1303
01:51:54,311 --> 01:51:56,333
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's on DDR Extreme.

1304
01:51:56,493 --> 01:51:58,775
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was going to say, here's the other half of that.

1305
01:51:59,095 --> 01:52:04,359
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, now if KOJ does it, then you're going to have Marvelous with two L's, and you're going to have Karaoke Revolution crossovers.

1306
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:06,741
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's kind of like Damned if you do, Damned if you don't.

1307
01:52:07,582 --> 01:52:13,106
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just that they need to be aware of what, you know, the people who want the game want.

1308
01:52:13,287 --> 01:52:22,394
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I understand that they're trying to get another group of people, the people who play K-Round, you know, if they do get the long versions like that, or...

1309
01:52:23,072 --> 01:52:26,314
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, they're trying to get a different group of people putting U.S.

1310
01:52:26,354 --> 01:52:32,356
[SPEAKER_23]: songs in there like Move Your Feet and, you know, Afrika Bambaataa's songs.

1311
01:52:32,937 --> 01:52:34,978
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, they're trying to get, you know, the U.S.

1312
01:52:35,038 --> 01:52:35,718
[SPEAKER_23]: into their U.S.

1313
01:52:35,778 --> 01:52:38,619
[SPEAKER_23]: mixes, but it's not up to that.

1314
01:52:38,679 --> 01:52:48,284
[SPEAKER_23]: It's up to, you know, good songs like In the Arcade Extreme and good step charts and things like that that, you know,

1315
01:52:50,285 --> 01:52:56,268
[SPEAKER_23]: Push for people to play that are real hardcore players and people that aren't even hardcore players that are even actually into playing.

1316
01:52:56,308 --> 01:53:00,990
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, the regular public doesn't understand that this mix, you know, has faults to it.

1317
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:01,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1318
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:01,950
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true.

1319
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:05,972
[SPEAKER_23]: They just play the game, they see arrows, and, you know, obviously once they get into it, they'll realize.

1320
01:53:06,492 --> 01:53:09,173
[SPEAKER_23]: But, you know, and that's all they want to really go for.

1321
01:53:09,213 --> 01:53:15,676
[SPEAKER_23]: If they actually end up getting the shit together, you know, then this will actually, you know, could be ending up being good.

1322
01:53:16,449 --> 01:53:28,794
[SPEAKER_23]: If we have some kind of affiliation with Konami, I mean, if I have an affiliation with Konami at any point in time where I can say what we should put on a mix, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.

1323
01:53:29,915 --> 01:53:30,355
[SPEAKER_32]: Very good.

1324
01:53:32,156 --> 01:53:43,320
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't see another home version song with some stupid step chart that looks like it's from... Yes, please, no hand plants in DER.

1325
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:44,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Please, no hand plants.

1326
01:53:45,174 --> 01:53:49,916
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen, I can go on an entire different show right now with you next week talking about how much I hate In The Groove.

1327
01:53:50,136 --> 01:54:00,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, actually, we're not going to be on next week, but I would love to have... Well, regardless, I could totally go on for hours and hours about how much I hate it, but... I would love to have you back on the show sometime and we can dish on In The Groove.

1328
01:54:01,099 --> 01:54:01,419
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, man.

1329
01:54:01,519 --> 01:54:05,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I actually... I was on the East Coast not that long ago and I got to go to In On The Break and I got to check it out.

1330
01:54:06,721 --> 01:54:09,402
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I could sum it up in one word, interesting.

1331
01:54:10,142 --> 01:54:10,602
[SPEAKER_23]: Interesting.

1332
01:54:10,702 --> 01:54:11,183
[SPEAKER_23]: That's good.

1333
01:54:11,263 --> 01:54:11,723
[SPEAKER_23]: That's good.

1334
01:54:12,123 --> 01:54:12,223
[SPEAKER_23]: Um...

1335
01:54:12,774 --> 01:54:14,215
[SPEAKER_23]: Interesting is definitely a good word for it.

1336
01:54:15,595 --> 01:54:26,581
[SPEAKER_23]: But yeah, to tell you the truth, I know I'm on all these big forums and everything, but if you see me on itgfreak.com, you'll see me flaming everyone.

1337
01:54:27,774 --> 01:54:28,715
[SPEAKER_23]: All I do is flame.

1338
01:54:28,735 --> 01:54:30,936
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually, I think I just registered just to flame me in the group.

1339
01:54:31,317 --> 01:54:35,760
[SPEAKER_21]: See, now you're just adding back into this DDR drama, the drama thing that you were talking about earlier.

1340
01:54:36,601 --> 01:54:38,342
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's all I do, because you know what?

1341
01:54:38,482 --> 01:54:40,503
[SPEAKER_23]: They just, they really didn't care.

1342
01:54:40,864 --> 01:54:43,966
[SPEAKER_23]: I can almost tell that they didn't care.

1343
01:54:44,386 --> 01:54:50,711
[SPEAKER_23]: Or the people out there that they're like, oh, I can make arrows and, you know, put arrows to the song, and no one cares what they look like.

1344
01:54:52,052 --> 01:54:55,835
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, it's really frustrating to look at that and have this be put out to...

1345
01:54:57,113 --> 01:55:00,335
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, arcades and have people play it, you know, or at least attempt to play it.

1346
01:55:01,095 --> 01:55:11,001
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, when it first came out, it just, it didn't have a lot of, well, it had a lot of, like, wow, another, you know, dancing game, but now no one's playing it anymore over here.

1347
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:12,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1348
01:55:12,081 --> 01:55:14,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we'll get more of your thoughts on In the Groove a little later.

1349
01:55:14,582 --> 01:55:16,784
[SPEAKER_21]: We've taken up, like, over a half hour of your time.

1350
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much for being on the show tonight.

1351
01:55:20,225 --> 01:55:20,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Keep in touch with us.

1352
01:55:21,026 --> 01:55:24,028
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't forget about us when you're off doing all these projects and stuff.

1353
01:55:24,048 --> 01:55:26,629
[SPEAKER_21]: You're welcome back on the show anytime to give us an update on what's going on.

1354
01:55:27,048 --> 01:55:27,968
[SPEAKER_21]: and best of luck to you, man.

1355
01:55:28,289 --> 01:55:28,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds exciting.

1356
01:55:28,789 --> 01:55:29,149
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, baby.

1357
01:55:29,549 --> 01:55:29,829
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1358
01:55:30,169 --> 01:55:30,550
[SPEAKER_21]: Talk to you.

1359
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:31,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Have a good one.

1360
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:31,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Later.

1361
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:31,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Bye.

1362
01:55:32,210 --> 01:55:32,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Bye.

1363
01:55:33,411 --> 01:55:33,931
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

1364
01:55:34,992 --> 01:55:37,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Lots of interesting stuff in that interview.

1365
01:55:38,053 --> 01:55:39,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Lots and lots of interesting stuff.

1366
01:55:39,874 --> 01:55:42,935
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't realize what the hell they're cooking up over there on the East Coast.

1367
01:55:43,015 --> 01:55:45,396
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't we feel out of the loop now over here on the West?

1368
01:55:45,456 --> 01:55:46,717
[SPEAKER_21]: That's very interesting.

1369
01:55:47,117 --> 01:55:51,299
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Guy, how can we sum up that whole thing for people that joined us halfway through that interview there?

1370
01:55:51,319 --> 01:55:53,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we've been talking to Frequency for about the past half hour there.

1371
01:55:54,421 --> 01:55:57,605
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR going on tour with Ludacris next spring.

1372
01:55:57,645 --> 01:55:58,967
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't know to what extent.

1373
01:55:59,447 --> 01:56:00,068
[SPEAKER_21]: What did he say?

1374
01:56:00,108 --> 01:56:07,758
[SPEAKER_21]: He's talking to Fuse TV about some type of DDR show that right now could, could not be pitched.

1375
01:56:08,177 --> 01:56:11,339
[SPEAKER_21]: with a WWE-ish element, or actually that wasn't the analogy.

1376
01:56:11,359 --> 01:56:11,779
[SPEAKER_21]: What did he say?

1377
01:56:11,799 --> 01:56:13,100
[SPEAKER_21]: The karate show.

1378
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:15,481
[SPEAKER_21]: The ultimate fighting championship.

1379
01:56:15,521 --> 01:56:16,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the fighting championship.

1380
01:56:16,602 --> 01:56:19,643
[SPEAKER_21]: He was saying maybe like a BattleBots type of thing, where it's like a tournament.

1381
01:56:19,683 --> 01:56:21,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Very interesting to see what happens with that.

1382
01:56:21,784 --> 01:56:24,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Lots of producer contacts apparently at that.

1383
01:56:24,786 --> 01:56:29,248
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR could be showing up a lot in the media in the next few months, and it won't be about weight loss.

1384
01:56:30,969 --> 01:56:31,770
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's great.

1385
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:34,251
[SPEAKER_21]: And the more exposure that DDR gets in the media...

1386
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:36,777
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember when we used to have new DDR Max came out

1387
01:57:05,855 --> 01:57:13,762
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, that show sounds like it needs like wacky, very informative commentators on that.

1388
01:57:13,962 --> 01:57:23,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Some people with like radio experience and some DDR experience and just, you know, someone that's been in the community for a while.

1389
01:57:24,753 --> 01:57:27,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Hmm, who could that be?

1390
01:57:27,234 --> 01:57:30,616
[SPEAKER_21]: Quit trying to whore yourself out to everybody, Loki.

1391
01:57:31,276 --> 01:57:31,936
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously.

1392
01:57:32,457 --> 01:57:33,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, damn, you know what?

1393
01:57:33,457 --> 01:57:33,957
[SPEAKER_21]: I need a break.

1394
01:57:34,437 --> 01:57:39,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks to Frequency for spending... That was like... Looking at the little timer going on there, that was over 30 minutes of chat.

1395
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:40,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1396
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,321
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a break is a good call.

1397
01:57:42,381 --> 01:57:45,763
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Jamie appreciates it too, because she's got a lot of work on her poster done over there, right?

1398
01:57:45,783 --> 01:57:46,463
[SPEAKER_14]: My posters are done.

1399
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:47,604
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.

1400
01:57:47,624 --> 01:57:48,084
[SPEAKER_16]: They're done.

1401
01:57:48,224 --> 01:57:49,624
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I was listening... No, I know you were.

1402
01:57:49,644 --> 01:57:50,025
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you were.

1403
01:57:50,345 --> 01:57:50,705
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just...

1404
01:57:52,003 --> 01:57:56,786
[SPEAKER_16]: I have this thing at work, but I have to have ten posters done, and I've got five done.

1405
01:57:57,106 --> 01:57:57,526
[SPEAKER_21]: No worries.

1406
01:57:57,626 --> 01:58:00,668
[SPEAKER_21]: And I need a moment to tally up those cage match votes, since it is.

1407
01:58:00,728 --> 01:58:06,551
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to tally up the cage match votes, and just take ourselves a nice little break here, because, damn, we need a break after that.

1408
01:58:06,611 --> 01:58:10,613
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to do a break here of some, um, how about some 2DX songs?

1409
01:58:10,653 --> 01:58:13,334
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to do a couple, a couple 2DX songs.

1410
01:58:13,354 --> 01:58:17,336
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll start it off with one of my, let's do one we haven't heard in a while here.

1411
01:58:17,356 --> 01:58:19,237
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to do one from 2DX Fifth Style.

1412
01:58:19,857 --> 01:58:20,978
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to do the cube first.

1413
01:58:21,451 --> 01:58:22,331
[SPEAKER_21]: and then we'll do Get On Beat.

1414
01:58:22,532 --> 01:58:23,632
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll try to get that in there too.

1415
01:58:24,092 --> 01:58:25,273
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll be back in a little bit.

1416
01:58:25,293 --> 01:58:26,313
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do the FUs of the Week.

1417
01:58:27,294 --> 01:58:32,336
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to let you know who won the cage match and who knows what else when we come back.

1418
01:58:32,776 --> 01:58:34,997
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we'll get to Loki as well when we come back.

1419
02:00:01,884 --> 02:00:02,725
Thanks for watching!

1420
02:00:58,445 --> 02:00:59,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1421
02:01:33,484 --> 02:01:35,266
Thanks for watching!

1422
02:02:26,793 --> 02:02:33,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I was just playing.

1423
02:02:34,017 --> 02:02:35,017
Uh, hey, guys, don't say me.

1424
02:02:35,037 --> 02:02:35,718
Don't say my name.

1425
02:02:35,738 --> 02:02:36,298
Don't say my name.

1426
02:03:12,952 --> 02:03:14,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1427
02:04:24,031 --> 02:04:24,873
Thanks for watching!

1428
02:05:21,772 --> 02:05:22,953
Thank you for watching!

1429
02:06:19,983 --> 02:06:21,604
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

1430
02:06:21,904 --> 02:06:26,847
[SPEAKER_27]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1431
02:06:27,567 --> 02:06:33,691
[SPEAKER_27]: But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1432
02:06:34,011 --> 02:06:35,932
[SPEAKER_27]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1433
02:06:36,492 --> 02:06:40,795
[SPEAKER_27]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1434
02:06:41,255 --> 02:06:42,796
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1435
02:06:42,816 --> 02:06:44,397
[SPEAKER_21]: We gotta get Mel back on the show at some point.

1436
02:06:44,417 --> 02:06:46,538
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, he was gonna be here a couple weeks ago, but something came up.

1437
02:06:46,698 --> 02:06:48,239
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we gotta get him back on the show.

1438
02:06:49,127 --> 02:06:50,548
[SPEAKER_21]: We need all our favorites back on the show.

1439
02:06:51,749 --> 02:06:52,890
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll have our people go get them.

1440
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:55,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we'll have our people talk to their people, etc., etc.

1441
02:06:56,993 --> 02:06:59,995
[SPEAKER_21]: So, there's some other news going out there in the music and rhythm game world.

1442
02:07:00,035 --> 02:07:04,138
[SPEAKER_21]: We've just spent the past half hour edition on DDR, but there are other games going on out there.

1443
02:07:04,539 --> 02:07:07,541
[SPEAKER_21]: One thing I wanted to talk about, Taiko Drum Master, actually.

1444
02:07:07,581 --> 02:07:11,044
[SPEAKER_21]: We've kind of mentioned this a couple times in the past few weeks.

1445
02:07:11,504 --> 02:07:14,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Taiko Drum Master is going to have its release on Tuesday, we're hearing.

1446
02:07:14,646 --> 02:07:16,308
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel, you've been kind of reading about this one.

1447
02:07:16,328 --> 02:07:17,889
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you planning on picking this game up, or...?

1448
02:07:18,894 --> 02:07:20,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, I'm going to try to pick it up.

1449
02:07:22,455 --> 02:07:32,119
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the sites I usually frequent to buy games says that the listed price is $69.99, and for PS2, obviously, you guys know that.

1450
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:40,923
[SPEAKER_15]: However, it doesn't state that there's going to be a controller included, like they did with Donkey Konga for the GameCube.

1451
02:07:41,203 --> 02:07:43,504
[SPEAKER_21]: For $69.99, there damn well better be.

1452
02:07:43,864 --> 02:07:44,724
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope so, yeah.

1453
02:07:45,745 --> 02:07:47,826
[SPEAKER_15]: There should be one, obviously, so...

1454
02:07:49,533 --> 02:07:55,818
[SPEAKER_21]: $49.99 is the most I've ever heard them charging for a video game, and that's for top-shelf games like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, things like that.

1455
02:07:56,879 --> 02:07:57,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1456
02:07:57,379 --> 02:08:01,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, but Rob, you remember how much I played for Samba de Amigo back in the day?

1457
02:08:02,844 --> 02:08:08,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Paid $80 for the US controller and, what was the game, $50 for the game?

1458
02:08:09,689 --> 02:08:10,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Back in the day.

1459
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:15,053
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the only game I've seen more expensive to import was Parapara back when it was at its height.

1460
02:08:16,762 --> 02:08:24,606
[SPEAKER_16]: My DDR2 mix on Dreamcast, when Dan bought it for me, the game was $75, and he spent $80 on my dance pad.

1461
02:08:26,387 --> 02:08:27,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn!

1462
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:31,590
[SPEAKER_16]: And I sort of acquired somebody else's dance pad.

1463
02:08:34,211 --> 02:08:43,196
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, if Namco's smart, they've got one song in Taiko Drum Master, they can be riding the wave of success off of one of their other games right now.

1464
02:08:46,854 --> 02:08:51,815
[SPEAKER_21]: Katamari Damacy, the Katamari on the Rocks theme, is in Taiko Drum Master.

1465
02:08:52,696 --> 02:08:58,117
[SPEAKER_21]: See, now that little green guy, I bet you anything that little green guy is going to become a little spokesman for Namco.

1466
02:08:59,677 --> 02:09:02,018
[SPEAKER_21]: Katamari Damacy is a huge thing.

1467
02:09:02,378 --> 02:09:03,638
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, they've got their staple.

1468
02:09:03,658 --> 02:09:04,899
[SPEAKER_21]: The Namco is a pretty good company.

1469
02:09:06,189 --> 02:09:14,574
[SPEAKER_21]: They're allowed to have more than one mascot, just like Nintendo's got Mario, and Link, Luigi, and who the hell else?

1470
02:09:14,674 --> 02:09:17,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Not Mario, Wario!

1471
02:09:18,356 --> 02:09:22,099
[SPEAKER_21]: You finally got a chance to get your own copy of Kanamari Damashii this week, right?

1472
02:09:23,239 --> 02:09:23,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1473
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:24,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1474
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,582
[SPEAKER_21]: So, were you playing it at all, or you said you were watching?

1475
02:09:28,206 --> 02:09:29,107
[SPEAKER_16]: I was playing at some.

1476
02:09:29,147 --> 02:09:30,108
[SPEAKER_16]: I played, like, at 3 a.m.

1477
02:09:30,248 --> 02:09:32,230
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, okay, these mushrooms are tripping me out.

1478
02:09:32,270 --> 02:09:32,730
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to bed.

1479
02:09:46,343 --> 02:09:51,187
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's kind of like, it feels like it's become the internet's latest mail-forward type thing.

1480
02:09:51,207 --> 02:09:55,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Where it's like, it's really funny, but you're going to get sick of it in a month.

1481
02:09:55,090 --> 02:09:58,132
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like, shut up about that goddamn ball-rolling game already.

1482
02:10:00,354 --> 02:10:00,754
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1483
02:10:01,515 --> 02:10:01,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Nope.

1484
02:10:03,925 --> 02:10:09,190
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, but, you know, it is human nature to love smashing things with a ball.

1485
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:13,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Rolling over stuff has been with us ever since the automobile.

1486
02:10:14,214 --> 02:10:21,580
[SPEAKER_19]: Since the automobile can smash objects like small squirrels and stuff, it's been our desire to find those small objects to roll over.

1487
02:10:22,381 --> 02:10:27,205
[SPEAKER_19]: And the fact that the ball is sticky and holds more objects to make an even larger ball, that's even better.

1488
02:10:29,827 --> 02:10:31,549
[SPEAKER_21]: That was beautiful, I think.

1489
02:10:32,139 --> 02:10:42,863
[SPEAKER_16]: I like running over buildings, and picking up cows, and the stupid dog that keeps trying to run into you.

1490
02:10:43,723 --> 02:10:50,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I was in this one part where this dog kept trying to butt into me, so I ran over the dog later on, and that was gratifying.

1491
02:10:53,727 --> 02:10:57,008
[SPEAKER_21]: Now see, in our chat room, here we go, we have one that says, I'm sick of it already.

1492
02:10:57,328 --> 02:10:59,769
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just like Super Monkey Ball, come on!

1493
02:10:59,869 --> 02:11:01,410
[SPEAKER_21]: Now see, Super Monkey Ball I never got into.

1494
02:11:02,082 --> 02:11:03,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Monkey Ball is cool.

1495
02:11:03,063 --> 02:11:04,304
[SPEAKER_21]: It's cute and all, but I never got into it.

1496
02:11:05,465 --> 02:11:07,306
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like the Parappa for this generation.

1497
02:11:08,006 --> 02:11:08,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Generation, what am I saying?

1498
02:11:08,887 --> 02:11:09,748
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, you know?

1499
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:13,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you know how Parappa hit and then kind of blew over?

1500
02:11:13,470 --> 02:11:18,314
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to have like, you know, Katamari Damacy 2 is coming out, and then there's going to be like, I think a theme.

1501
02:11:18,935 --> 02:11:21,336
[SPEAKER_16]: There should be like, like Katamari Party.

1502
02:11:24,659 --> 02:11:26,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Mario Party, just with the little prince.

1503
02:11:27,763 --> 02:11:32,306
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to say that the game's got its little cult following now, so it's kind of funny.

1504
02:11:33,707 --> 02:11:38,951
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to mention that VGCats jumped on it as soon as the game got released.

1505
02:11:40,292 --> 02:11:43,334
[SPEAKER_15]: For those of you that don't know what VGCats is... It took them quite a while, actually, to get on it.

1506
02:11:44,615 --> 02:11:51,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but... Anyway, I was going to say VGCats is an online comic for video games and stuff.

1507
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:53,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

1508
02:11:53,942 --> 02:11:54,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1509
02:11:54,844 --> 02:11:58,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, okay, let's get back on topic to talking about rhythm and music games here.

1510
02:11:59,288 --> 02:12:02,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki had some things he wanted to talk about with you guys, some news that's going on.

1511
02:12:02,631 --> 02:12:06,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Now you, I guess there's some remix contests going on that just finished up.

1512
02:12:06,414 --> 02:12:07,755
[SPEAKER_21]: What happened with remixing?

1513
02:12:08,607 --> 02:12:22,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Both DDR, it's like DDR Remix, which is just DDR Maniacs' contest, which didn't have quite a turnout as, but my sales, Remix Contest 1.5 or whatever that was.

1514
02:12:23,374 --> 02:12:25,735
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyways, there's some pretty cool stuff that came out of those.

1515
02:12:27,075 --> 02:12:34,819
[SPEAKER_19]: First I'll talk about the DDR Maniacs 1, the Remix competition, because it's actually not done.

1516
02:12:35,139 --> 02:12:37,220
[SPEAKER_19]: They're in voting right now, but they have the...

1517
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:43,623
[SPEAKER_19]: The songs that were out there, so I'm going to play a few of these here.

1518
02:12:43,643 --> 02:12:46,044
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, let me adjust my volume here.

1519
02:12:47,225 --> 02:12:55,551
[SPEAKER_19]: There was actually only four people that entered this, which is kind of a little sad.

1520
02:12:55,591 --> 02:12:56,151
[SPEAKER_19]: A little sad.

1521
02:12:57,492 --> 02:13:01,795
[SPEAKER_19]: There was two by, you know, you might recognize DJ Potato.

1522
02:13:02,395 --> 02:13:04,497
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to find these here.

1523
02:13:04,637 --> 02:13:05,257
[SPEAKER_19]: What do I have?

1524
02:13:05,918 --> 02:13:06,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

1525
02:13:08,732 --> 02:13:08,992
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Potato

1526
02:13:24,278 --> 02:13:25,678
[SPEAKER_19]: There was only five entries.

1527
02:13:25,718 --> 02:13:26,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Two of them were his.

1528
02:13:27,039 --> 02:13:30,860
[SPEAKER_19]: They were actually... And I can play them for you guys.

1529
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:44,144
[SPEAKER_19]: It was actually some work that he did, sort of, kind of, with the Bomani Rock album, but not... It's just a piano and saxophone sort of remixes of... What the hell?

1530
02:13:45,404 --> 02:13:46,204
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell was that?

1531
02:13:46,544 --> 02:13:50,845
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, give us a little clip of one of these songs here.

1532
02:13:51,886 --> 02:13:52,786
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, well, let's see here.

1533
02:13:52,806 --> 02:13:52,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

1534
02:13:53,527 --> 02:13:57,548
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll start off with... Let's see, these are old.

1535
02:14:00,288 --> 02:14:01,048
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I know, I know.

1536
02:14:01,688 --> 02:14:04,529
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, we're going to start off with... They had one of Kind Lady.

1537
02:14:05,309 --> 02:14:06,809
[SPEAKER_19]: He actually did a few of these.

1538
02:14:06,849 --> 02:14:08,690
[SPEAKER_19]: He has, like, D2R 1998.

1539
02:14:10,270 --> 02:14:13,350
[SPEAKER_19]: Kind Lady, there was another one, too.

1540
02:14:13,390 --> 02:14:16,591
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't remember what it was offhand, but... Anyways.

1541
02:14:17,891 --> 02:14:18,851
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see here.

1542
02:14:21,212 --> 02:14:22,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, this one...

1543
02:14:23,675 --> 02:14:33,558
[SPEAKER_19]: Right here is going to be DJ Potato Piano Concentrato Shut up!

1544
02:14:34,378 --> 02:14:37,599
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't need your fancy English-English talk, okay?

1545
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,260
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Italian!

1546
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:40,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

1547
02:14:41,281 --> 02:14:41,781
[SPEAKER_19]: European.

1548
02:14:42,121 --> 02:14:45,802
[SPEAKER_19]: We do not formally recognize European nations, okay?

1549
02:14:45,842 --> 02:14:46,862
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want you to know that.

1550
02:14:47,203 --> 02:14:48,563
[SPEAKER_19]: They do not exist to me.

1551
02:14:50,066 --> 02:14:51,467
[SPEAKER_13]: and your psychotic little universe.

1552
02:15:23,437 --> 02:15:24,438
Anyways.

1553
02:15:24,458 --> 02:15:27,199
Keep in mind, I played saxophone for like 12 years.

1554
02:15:27,419 --> 02:15:29,420
You're listening to KOLR Smooth Jazz.

1555
02:15:53,154 --> 02:15:55,977
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was that.

1556
02:15:56,818 --> 02:16:02,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, that was one of the songs that was in there.

1557
02:16:02,043 --> 02:16:04,065
[SPEAKER_19]: There were some other remixes, but not a lot.

1558
02:16:05,366 --> 02:16:08,850
[SPEAKER_19]: However, the Bomani Style remix competition was a little different.

1559
02:16:09,050 --> 02:16:09,911
[SPEAKER_19]: There was quite a bit there.

1560
02:16:10,571 --> 02:16:17,078
[SPEAKER_19]: I saved some of these really kick-ass ones on here because there were a few that were like, and even the judges said, what the hell is this?

1561
02:16:17,634 --> 02:16:19,415
[SPEAKER_19]: But, you know, there's always going to be something like that.

1562
02:16:19,495 --> 02:16:23,277
[SPEAKER_19]: So, some of the ones I'd like to point out, which were pretty cool.

1563
02:16:25,039 --> 02:16:25,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see here.

1564
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:28,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of them you've heard before on this show.

1565
02:16:28,921 --> 02:16:29,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Klunk Klunk 2004.

1566
02:16:29,681 --> 02:16:33,784
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, that was DM Ashura.

1567
02:16:35,145 --> 02:16:36,125
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was pretty sweet.

1568
02:16:43,149 --> 02:16:45,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, anyways, that one.

1569
02:16:46,351 --> 02:16:46,712
[SPEAKER_19]: And then...

1570
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:52,256
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got my personal favorite, Dazed and Destroyed.

1571
02:16:52,576 --> 02:16:56,321
[SPEAKER_19]: I loved this one before when it was only a clip of the song, but that's the whole thing.

1572
02:16:56,742 --> 02:17:04,052
[SPEAKER_19]: The second half is kind of, eh, it's okay, but I mean, it's pretty well done for, um, it's a remix of Hysteria, so, pretty sweet.

1573
02:17:29,645 --> 02:17:31,648
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a really cool song, trust me with that.

1574
02:17:31,728 --> 02:17:34,271
[SPEAKER_22]: And he's making bitter beer face.

1575
02:17:34,391 --> 02:17:35,052
[SPEAKER_10]: It's different.

1576
02:17:37,935 --> 02:17:41,179
[SPEAKER_22]: It's different, and it's well-produced.

1577
02:17:41,239 --> 02:17:46,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Well-produced maybe, but of course they can speak to each other.

1578
02:17:46,105 --> 02:17:46,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1579
02:17:47,765 --> 02:17:49,266
[SPEAKER_19]: BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY

1580
02:18:16,005 --> 02:18:19,168
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying to think of some really cool ones that are out there.

1581
02:18:19,188 --> 02:18:21,810
[SPEAKER_20]: They sort of had an R&B version of Rainbow Flyer.

1582
02:18:27,694 --> 02:18:41,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Rainbow Flyer, the polychromatic algorithmic... Let's see here, we've also got... But the winner, the winner of it all was Saxon Pike with V1.

1583
02:18:47,034 --> 02:19:02,388
[SPEAKER_20]: No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1584
02:19:03,249 --> 02:19:09,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same contest you were complaining about because they wouldn't allow fusion mixes and what won the damn contest?

1585
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:14,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, this was a little different now.

1586
02:19:14,682 --> 02:19:18,804
[SPEAKER_19]: They didn't want people just using acid to throw two songs on top of each other.

1587
02:19:20,005 --> 02:19:24,468
[SPEAKER_19]: However, there were some songs in there that were two songs thrown on top of each other.

1588
02:19:25,148 --> 02:19:31,372
[SPEAKER_19]: How that got in is beyond me, because I specifically remembered in the rules that that's why I didn't enter.

1589
02:19:32,052 --> 02:19:32,573
[SPEAKER_19]: But whatever.

1590
02:19:33,213 --> 02:19:33,673
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care.

1591
02:19:33,693 --> 02:19:35,054
[SPEAKER_19]: The contest is over.

1592
02:19:35,514 --> 02:19:36,075
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little late.

1593
02:19:36,615 --> 02:19:38,136
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyway, so yeah, that was that.

1594
02:19:38,696 --> 02:19:39,957
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find all these songs online.

1595
02:19:40,638 --> 02:19:49,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Under the music production forum on MyStyle, there's a whole list of songs you can listen to, good and bad, and they're all on there, pretty cool.

1596
02:19:49,285 --> 02:19:56,471
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the other songs that came out this week also was a remix of Vanity Angel by DM Asura, because he can do no wrong, it seems like, with these.

1597
02:19:56,811 --> 02:19:59,914
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, I thought I'd play a little bit of that, because that's pretty sweet also.

1598
02:20:09,835 --> 02:20:15,237
[SPEAKER_20]: But, yeah, it's just, you know, cool, like, long, trance, universal, and trance songs, so.

1599
02:20:16,577 --> 02:20:18,698
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyways, that was out.

1600
02:20:18,718 --> 02:20:20,919
[SPEAKER_19]: You can also find that in the Music Production Forum.

1601
02:20:22,159 --> 02:20:33,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Or you could listen to Monday Nights, Diversion, the Orange Sons Radio Remix Show, because we'll definitely be adding some of these songs into our rotation there on Monday nights from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

1602
02:20:34,406 --> 02:20:45,229
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, and the other thing I wanted to mention, and we mentioned this way back in the show a while ago, about, what was it, it was DJ Potato's Bomani Rock album that was going to be coming out.

1603
02:20:45,709 --> 02:20:48,349
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a few full tracks, actually, from that.

1604
02:20:49,330 --> 02:20:55,731
[SPEAKER_19]: So, there's a few I'd like to just preview real quick, and we'll also be throwing those in to rotation as well.

1605
02:20:55,751 --> 02:20:56,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Max 300.

1606
02:20:56,411 --> 02:20:56,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Max 300.

1607
02:21:15,157 --> 02:21:20,019
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, all right, all right.

1608
02:21:20,919 --> 02:21:24,401
[SPEAKER_22]: It's well done, don't get me wrong, but no more Macs.

1609
02:21:24,841 --> 02:21:25,421
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean it.

1610
02:21:25,681 --> 02:21:26,462
[SPEAKER_22]: No more.

1611
02:21:26,482 --> 02:21:29,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Samsung keeps breeding.

1612
02:21:29,823 --> 02:21:30,743
[SPEAKER_14]: It's worse than Tribbles.

1613
02:21:32,344 --> 02:21:33,524
[SPEAKER_19]: This one's the one I like, Peer Drain.

1614
02:21:33,564 --> 02:21:35,325
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't go on.

1615
02:21:44,113 --> 02:21:54,737
[SPEAKER_19]: This one is a little harder to find.

1616
02:21:56,098 --> 02:21:57,819
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe this was in the 2DX forum.

1617
02:21:57,839 --> 02:22:00,760
[SPEAKER_19]: There's like a sample thing from the Bomani Rock album.

1618
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:02,700
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find that also on Bomani Style.

1619
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:07,223
[SPEAKER_19]: That's pretty much all that's like music news.

1620
02:22:07,263 --> 02:22:16,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, there's a little other thing I read because we're talking about, you know, new arcade mixes and the Step Mania machine and in the groove and all that kind of stuff that kind of coincides with this.

1621
02:22:16,875 --> 02:22:17,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, for those who...

1622
02:22:18,706 --> 02:22:28,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Frequent the DDRUK.com site, you'll know that they created a Setmania machine called DDX, or Dance Dance X, or whatever it is.

1623
02:22:29,834 --> 02:22:34,077
[SPEAKER_19]: It's basically a Setmania arcade game that they skinned.

1624
02:22:34,117 --> 02:22:40,161
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks really nice, and it was being played in a Namco, I think it was like a Namco cyberstation somewhere in England.

1625
02:22:40,781 --> 02:22:41,362
[SPEAKER_19]: And anyways...

1626
02:22:42,836 --> 02:22:45,237
[SPEAKER_19]: That's getting pulled out of there.

1627
02:22:45,357 --> 02:22:52,701
[SPEAKER_19]: Not because of licensing issues and stuff, but it fell the same fate that the Golf Land Machine was.

1628
02:22:52,921 --> 02:23:00,685
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is, it's not being fixed by them, and it's just falling apart and damaged.

1629
02:23:03,727 --> 02:23:11,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone out there know that problems with little kids trashing shit, it's worldwide.

1630
02:23:11,410 --> 02:23:12,611
[SPEAKER_19]: There are bad parents everywhere.

1631
02:23:14,352 --> 02:23:16,294
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and you told me that it happened during break.

1632
02:23:16,354 --> 02:23:22,462
[SPEAKER_21]: I was hoping it was going to be a legal issues story so we could have a little fun with that, but you're just saying some fucking punks ruined the machine.

1633
02:23:22,722 --> 02:23:23,102
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

1634
02:23:24,023 --> 02:23:24,604
[SPEAKER_19]: That is it.

1635
02:23:24,724 --> 02:23:25,085
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1636
02:23:25,505 --> 02:23:26,486
[SPEAKER_21]: How boring!

1637
02:23:26,787 --> 02:23:28,449
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted somebody to get sued.

1638
02:23:28,709 --> 02:23:29,870
[SPEAKER_21]: That would have been exciting.

1639
02:23:31,392 --> 02:23:32,534
[SPEAKER_21]: So no plans to bring it back?

1640
02:23:32,974 --> 02:23:34,135
[SPEAKER_21]: They're just going to let it rot?

1641
02:23:35,390 --> 02:23:37,911
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we will get a lawsuit story out of this after all.

1642
02:23:37,931 --> 02:23:38,111
[SPEAKER_19]: Hooray!

1643
02:23:56,505 --> 02:24:02,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, the other thing I wanted to talk about was there was a bootleg that came out a few weeks ago, Dance Dance King.

1644
02:24:02,307 --> 02:24:14,853
[SPEAKER_19]: It looked like a really crappy bootleg machine from China that featured gold colored pads and stuff and had, what else?

1645
02:24:14,993 --> 02:24:23,456
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and it's basically a second mix consumer style machine that was running from a PlayStation machine.

1646
02:24:24,068 --> 02:24:26,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Literally, a PS1 was inside this cabinet.

1647
02:24:27,591 --> 02:24:28,912
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was quite interesting.

1648
02:24:29,313 --> 02:24:31,014
[SPEAKER_19]: I happened to contact these people.

1649
02:24:31,114 --> 02:24:42,964
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to... Now, it wasn't their idea, they say, to bring this bootleg over here, but the guy wants to make a legitimate mix.

1650
02:24:43,625 --> 02:24:45,366
[SPEAKER_19]: That was kind of interesting, I thought.

1651
02:24:47,288 --> 02:24:48,589
[SPEAKER_28]: Good luck!

1652
02:24:51,291 --> 02:24:56,638
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, that's all the miscellaneous Bomani stuff that's been going on this week.

1653
02:24:57,259 --> 02:25:01,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Next week, I have no idea what's going to be going on because I'm going to be playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1654
02:25:04,007 --> 02:25:07,992
[SPEAKER_19]: So unless there's Bomani in San Andreas, I have no idea what's going on.

1655
02:25:08,905 --> 02:25:13,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair enough, because we're not having a show next Sunday, remember, it's Halloween, and we're giving all the people a night off so you can go trick-or-treating.

1656
02:25:13,808 --> 02:25:20,633
[SPEAKER_21]: We will have a marathon of old Orange Lounge Radio episodes, though, a very scary Orange Lounge Radio marathon for you guys next Sunday.

1657
02:25:20,653 --> 02:25:21,974
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know how long that's going to run.

1658
02:25:22,314 --> 02:25:24,976
[SPEAKER_21]: Stay tuned to the website for details and when your shows will air.

1659
02:25:26,156 --> 02:25:29,398
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, Nelly almost got me to buy Karaoke Revolution 2.

1660
02:25:29,539 --> 02:25:32,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Then my wits came about me, I said, fuck no!

1661
02:25:32,621 --> 02:25:33,841
[SPEAKER_19]: I am not buying that game.

1662
02:25:37,404 --> 02:25:37,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Fair enough.

1663
02:25:38,371 --> 02:25:39,311
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I want to ask you about this.

1664
02:25:39,411 --> 02:25:40,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Rai Chan sent me a private message.

1665
02:25:41,332 --> 02:25:44,373
[SPEAKER_21]: She linked me to this thread over on Freak that's showing this.

1666
02:25:44,413 --> 02:25:51,775
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if you've seen this, but it is a Stepmania computer put inside an 80s era ghetto blaster.

1667
02:25:52,315 --> 02:25:55,936
[SPEAKER_21]: And they've got the Stepmania logo painted over the speakers.

1668
02:25:56,276 --> 02:25:57,497
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is actually a computer.

1669
02:25:57,537 --> 02:25:59,397
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like a boombox in the front, but look at the side.

1670
02:25:59,417 --> 02:26:00,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at that.

1671
02:26:00,057 --> 02:26:00,718
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a little computer.

1672
02:26:00,778 --> 02:26:01,518
[SPEAKER_21]: You see this, Jamie?

1673
02:26:01,538 --> 02:26:02,398
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at that.

1674
02:26:03,018 --> 02:26:03,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Old school.

1675
02:26:03,398 --> 02:26:05,059
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes me think of the Nintendo computer.

1676
02:26:06,172 --> 02:26:08,694
[SPEAKER_16]: You remember when they were building a Nintendo out of laptop parts?

1677
02:26:09,174 --> 02:26:12,136
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, building a computer out of a Nintendo shell and laptop parts.

1678
02:26:12,757 --> 02:26:14,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's the nice case mod.

1679
02:26:15,899 --> 02:26:18,461
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought about doing one like that, but putting it in a Dreamcast.

1680
02:26:18,541 --> 02:26:22,123
[SPEAKER_16]: I still want one built out of a toolkit, a toolbox.

1681
02:26:24,285 --> 02:26:25,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that kind of thing hard to do, Loki?

1682
02:26:25,766 --> 02:26:29,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, when it comes to technical stuff, I don't know shit.

1683
02:26:29,889 --> 02:26:32,611
[SPEAKER_21]: I know how to put a radio station on the internet, but that's about it.

1684
02:26:33,011 --> 02:26:35,773
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Loki, tell me about, is this hard to do?

1685
02:26:36,758 --> 02:26:37,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Not if you have a Dremel tool.

1686
02:26:37,999 --> 02:26:44,561
[SPEAKER_19]: It's pretty much, even since that boombox was so big, that they probably wouldn't even need to get a micro ITX board.

1687
02:26:45,001 --> 02:26:49,083
[SPEAKER_19]: The micro ITX ones that they have now are really small.

1688
02:26:49,163 --> 02:26:57,227
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the specifications for that are 15, I think it's 17 centimeters by 17 centimeters.

1689
02:26:57,607 --> 02:27:02,909
[SPEAKER_19]: And looking at that, it looks like that is a micro ITX board in there.

1690
02:27:03,376 --> 02:27:08,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so it's a micro-ITX board, looks like a hard drive, power supply and everything.

1691
02:27:09,479 --> 02:27:15,661
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like they had a P4 version that was in there.

1692
02:27:15,881 --> 02:27:17,302
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't really know if that's the thing.

1693
02:27:17,822 --> 02:27:21,544
[SPEAKER_19]: They might have just added a fan to that just so it's cooled off a little bit more.

1694
02:27:22,024 --> 02:27:22,364
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1695
02:27:22,504 --> 02:27:23,645
[SPEAKER_19]: It's hard to tell by the picture.

1696
02:27:24,125 --> 02:27:28,967
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like it could be a regular-sized motherboard, but I'm thinking it's probably a micro-ITX.

1697
02:27:30,114 --> 02:27:31,735
[SPEAKER_21]: I like how they have the hard drive on top.

1698
02:27:31,855 --> 02:27:32,576
[SPEAKER_21]: That's very interesting.

1699
02:27:32,596 --> 02:27:34,437
[SPEAKER_21]: The hard drive's like separate from everything else.

1700
02:27:34,517 --> 02:27:35,197
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of interesting.

1701
02:27:35,277 --> 02:27:37,579
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if that's just the way they open it up or what.

1702
02:27:37,979 --> 02:27:39,100
[SPEAKER_21]: But look at this.

1703
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:44,683
[SPEAKER_21]: It says it also includes a sound-sensitive blue LED rod that kind of goes with the beat.

1704
02:27:47,665 --> 02:27:51,468
[SPEAKER_21]: But those little things go a long way in ghetto fabulousness, don't they?

1705
02:27:51,568 --> 02:27:52,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't you think?

1706
02:27:53,969 --> 02:27:54,630
[SPEAKER_21]: It's awesome.

1707
02:27:55,330 --> 02:27:56,231
[SPEAKER_19]: I still wanted to do...

1708
02:27:56,584 --> 02:28:11,052
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to make like a mini portable console system for like, you know, Stepmania emulation games and just like a, not really, like almost like a laptop but not, I don't know, I'm never going to do that though because I start too many projects.

1709
02:28:12,739 --> 02:28:14,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, well we're going to go to a break.

1710
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:17,421
[SPEAKER_21]: When we come back from this break, we've got to do the FUs of the week, don't you know?

1711
02:28:17,622 --> 02:28:20,763
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, but shouldn't I announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match before we get to that?

1712
02:28:21,023 --> 02:28:24,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that was about an hour ago that we had the Cage Match.

1713
02:28:24,725 --> 02:28:32,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match is Ian Van Dahl with Reason.

1714
02:28:33,470 --> 02:28:34,390
[SPEAKER_21]: So there you have it.

1715
02:28:34,770 --> 02:28:37,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because Loki picks a funny one doesn't mean he wins it.

1716
02:28:38,292 --> 02:28:39,993
[SPEAKER_21]: So, too bad!

1717
02:28:41,710 --> 02:28:41,990
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm glad.

1718
02:28:42,030 --> 02:28:44,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't won that in at least a while.

1719
02:28:44,992 --> 02:28:46,113
[SPEAKER_21]: So, at least a month.

1720
02:28:46,333 --> 02:28:47,153
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that much.

1721
02:28:48,614 --> 02:28:49,875
[SPEAKER_21]: So, cool.

1722
02:28:49,975 --> 02:28:54,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you'll be hearing that one again next week along with two other lovely new songs.

1723
02:28:55,439 --> 02:28:56,279
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, no, not next week.

1724
02:28:56,319 --> 02:28:58,360
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, by default it's going to win for two weeks now.

1725
02:28:58,440 --> 02:29:02,243
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we'll be back in two weeks to try and dethrone Ian Vandal.

1726
02:29:03,447 --> 02:29:04,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Ryu, I'm white, forgive me, we'll be back

1727
02:30:19,503 --> 02:30:21,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1728
02:30:52,274 --> 02:30:53,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1729
02:31:18,032 --> 02:31:19,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1730
02:32:09,412 --> 02:32:10,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1731
02:32:51,003 --> 02:32:51,927
Thanks for watching!

1732
02:33:19,258 --> 02:33:20,379
Thanks for watching!

1733
02:33:48,926 --> 02:33:50,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1734
02:33:50,287 --> 02:33:52,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Please subscribe to my channel!

1735
02:34:32,703 --> 02:34:33,684
Thank you for watching!

1736
02:35:12,834 --> 02:35:14,195
Thank you for watching!

1737
02:35:35,034 --> 02:35:43,576
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1738
02:35:43,616 --> 02:35:49,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1739
02:35:50,877 --> 02:35:57,058
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and believe it or not, we're coming into the home stretch of the show.

1740
02:35:57,799 --> 02:35:59,879
[SPEAKER_21]: But no show would be complete...

1741
02:36:01,437 --> 02:36:03,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Without a little bit of angst.

1742
02:36:04,258 --> 02:36:06,459
[SPEAKER_21]: And that means it's time for the FUs of the week.

1743
02:36:07,139 --> 02:36:10,020
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, why do we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

1744
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:13,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we're full of angst.

1745
02:36:19,824 --> 02:36:21,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is bad.

1746
02:36:21,744 --> 02:36:23,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Here is justice.

1747
02:36:23,505 --> 02:36:25,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Here is punishment.

1748
02:36:25,946 --> 02:36:28,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Here is... This is fucked up!

1749
02:36:29,407 --> 02:36:31,088
[SPEAKER_16]: First thing I do goes to my laundry...

1750
02:36:31,636 --> 02:36:35,397
[SPEAKER_16]: for not being dry yet, it's still damp.

1751
02:36:36,518 --> 02:36:42,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Another FU goes toward being exhausted, drained, worn out, you name it.

1752
02:36:43,380 --> 02:36:46,781
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to stress, big FU to stress.

1753
02:36:47,522 --> 02:36:53,444
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to people in minivans who drive 30 in a 50 mile an hour zone.

1754
02:36:58,650 --> 02:37:02,950
[SPEAKER_16]: and Distance, Time, Money.

1755
02:37:04,591 --> 02:37:06,431
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really have anything specific.

1756
02:37:11,352 --> 02:37:13,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, then we'll move on to Loki.

1757
02:37:20,574 --> 02:37:25,275
[SPEAKER_19]: First off, you know, it's like every week, you know, fuck you the drivers, because

1758
02:37:26,673 --> 02:37:28,774
[SPEAKER_19]: God, they're so awful and wholesome.

1759
02:37:28,854 --> 02:37:29,915
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't know what it is.

1760
02:37:29,955 --> 02:37:35,699
[SPEAKER_19]: They just don't pay attention to any of the stop signs, lights, road signs, nothing.

1761
02:37:35,739 --> 02:37:37,680
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just stupid.

1762
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:39,741
[SPEAKER_19]: So, fuck you, Zeb.

1763
02:37:39,761 --> 02:37:45,545
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck you to my car, because the engine light came on the other day, and I don't know why.

1764
02:37:45,565 --> 02:37:54,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, actually, I do know why, because it was out of coolant, but I fixed that, and I hope it doesn't break down, because, you know, I need good karma around my car.

1765
02:37:55,050 --> 02:37:56,071
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to have to, like...

1766
02:37:57,169 --> 02:37:58,069
[SPEAKER_19]: Have it great.

1767
02:37:58,089 --> 02:37:59,370
[SPEAKER_19]: That would suck.

1768
02:38:00,891 --> 02:38:09,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Then on more personal notes, and I apologize to any people that are listening from my work, because I think there might be one or two.

1769
02:38:09,934 --> 02:38:10,535
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe one.

1770
02:38:10,915 --> 02:38:18,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, fuck you to BPD for firing Nelly from the mailroom.

1771
02:38:18,198 --> 02:38:24,100
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really funny because I do know the reasons behind it, and it was really stupid why they did it.

1772
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:26,421
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of people there that have done a lot worse

1773
02:38:27,245 --> 02:38:39,297
[SPEAKER_19]: and are still there, and it's just retarded, so, but whatever, she's probably going to end up getting something better in the long run, so that's cool, but there's just a lot of people I have lost respect for from that, and that sucks.

1774
02:38:40,438 --> 02:38:52,049
[SPEAKER_19]: Then finally, just, I'm sorry, fuck you to the rain, because it's wet outside and I can't work on my cabinet, not that I would work on my cabinet anyways if it wasn't raining.

1775
02:38:54,546 --> 02:38:59,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just tired, that's it.

1776
02:39:01,433 --> 02:39:07,579
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'm going back to my old FU song, because the new one, William Hung, just wasn't working out, so I'm going back to my old song.

1777
02:39:07,599 --> 02:39:16,027
[SPEAKER_21]: Weren't we just talking about how we didn't really care for this song, Jamie?

1778
02:39:17,088 --> 02:39:17,368
[SPEAKER_21]: And yet...

1779
02:39:17,862 --> 02:39:18,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you pick another one?

1780
02:39:19,163 --> 02:39:20,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Nah, I'm feeling uncreative tonight.

1781
02:39:21,143 --> 02:39:24,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I just like the fact that it goes, all things keep getting better.

1782
02:39:24,865 --> 02:39:26,225
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, it's the FUs of the week.

1783
02:39:26,285 --> 02:39:26,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't wanna.

1784
02:39:26,966 --> 02:39:27,966
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't wanna.

1785
02:39:28,006 --> 02:39:28,766
[SPEAKER_14]: No, maybe later.

1786
02:39:39,001 --> 02:39:48,665
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm never that angsty though, and honestly, to be honest, this week is much different.

1787
02:39:49,385 --> 02:39:59,950
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just, I'm going to say F you to the fact that I've been really insanely busy this week, and I haven't had time to do all the things that I want to do, and F you to the fact that I haven't been able to hang out with certain people as much as I would like to be able to.

1788
02:40:00,486 --> 02:40:05,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because of the fact that, you know, they're working, and I'm working, and I got the radio stuff, etc., etc., so...

1789
02:40:07,076 --> 02:40:07,757
[SPEAKER_21]: That kind of sucks.

1790
02:40:07,777 --> 02:40:09,338
[SPEAKER_21]: There needs to be more hours in the day.

1791
02:40:09,458 --> 02:40:13,021
[SPEAKER_21]: And then people shouldn't have to work as much and then keep the same salary.

1792
02:40:13,422 --> 02:40:18,186
[SPEAKER_21]: I realize I'm living in La La Land, but I really don't have anything realistic this week.

1793
02:40:18,426 --> 02:40:19,867
[SPEAKER_21]: It's actually been a pretty decent week.

1794
02:40:19,887 --> 02:40:20,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Just really busy.

1795
02:40:21,729 --> 02:40:27,894
[SPEAKER_21]: Except F you to the people that went and saw The Grudge at 9.30 on Friday night in Roseville because you all were too damn loud.

1796
02:40:28,915 --> 02:40:31,437
[SPEAKER_21]: And F you to that guy I had to yell at in the middle of the movie.

1797
02:40:31,577 --> 02:40:33,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Although that did make me feel really good.

1798
02:40:34,059 --> 02:40:39,543
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, just getting the applause like that when I told that guy to shut the hell up felt really, really good.

1799
02:40:39,583 --> 02:40:41,984
[SPEAKER_21]: There's just not a lot of rushes like that you get in the world, so.

1800
02:40:43,905 --> 02:40:47,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Just, you know, F you to that movie as well for making people scream and stuff.

1801
02:40:49,966 --> 02:40:52,027
[SPEAKER_21]: People were too damn loud with that movie and it was giving me a headache.

1802
02:40:52,147 --> 02:41:04,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, F you to the fact, I know why, F you to the fact that the projectionist or something, the film was damaged or the projection was going on because for 20 goddamn minutes the movie was bouncing up and down like it was shaking.

1803
02:41:05,014 --> 02:41:08,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Like imagine if you were trying to watch something on a projection screen and it was shaking like an earthquake.

1804
02:41:09,076 --> 02:41:12,678
[SPEAKER_21]: I swear to God it was giving me a headache after like one minute of having to watch it like that.

1805
02:41:12,998 --> 02:41:16,520
[SPEAKER_21]: And we go and complain, Loki actually went in and complained and what did they tell you?

1806
02:41:17,527 --> 02:41:20,350
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, yeah, it's only going to do that for 20 minutes.

1807
02:41:20,751 --> 02:41:27,698
[SPEAKER_20]: We got the defective reel from the studio, but hey, we're getting a new one to replace it soon.

1808
02:41:28,318 --> 02:41:28,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

1809
02:41:29,179 --> 02:41:29,539
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-uh.

1810
02:41:29,939 --> 02:41:30,239
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1811
02:41:30,299 --> 02:41:41,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you and your fucking bitch-ass whore cunt for fucking making me pay $9.25 plus a $1.25 Fandango fee because I don't like fucking lines at your movie theater.

1812
02:41:42,322 --> 02:41:43,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you for making me pay that.

1813
02:41:44,142 --> 02:41:47,123
[SPEAKER_21]: I want a perfect goddamn theater experience.

1814
02:41:47,183 --> 02:41:47,803
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

1815
02:41:47,943 --> 02:41:49,223
[SPEAKER_14]: You should have asked for the manager.

1816
02:41:49,403 --> 02:41:49,883
[SPEAKER_21]: I know.

1817
02:41:50,024 --> 02:41:51,644
[SPEAKER_21]: I should write a letter and complain.

1818
02:41:51,824 --> 02:41:52,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it.

1819
02:41:52,664 --> 02:41:53,645
[SPEAKER_21]: I just might.

1820
02:41:54,446 --> 02:41:58,330
[SPEAKER_16]: You should ask for the manager's boss then.

1821
02:42:01,613 --> 02:42:02,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Who knew?

1822
02:42:02,354 --> 02:42:06,297
[SPEAKER_21]: I had this rage pent up in me and I forgot all about it.

1823
02:42:06,337 --> 02:42:09,060
[SPEAKER_21]: I pushed it to the back of my mind and you people brought it out of me.

1824
02:42:09,801 --> 02:42:10,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Rage!

1825
02:42:10,641 --> 02:42:16,547
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a free ticket for complaining about them turning on the lights at the end of the credits for Matrix.

1826
02:42:18,068 --> 02:42:19,229
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll write a nasty letter.

1827
02:42:19,829 --> 02:42:20,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you know what?

1828
02:42:21,330 --> 02:42:24,332
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I had one other bad experience at theater and I can't remember what it was.

1829
02:42:24,613 --> 02:42:27,535
[SPEAKER_21]: But I bet if I went through the FU archives of the show I could find it.

1830
02:42:27,595 --> 02:42:29,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Mention the three magic words.

1831
02:42:30,017 --> 02:42:32,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Better business bureau.

1832
02:42:32,618 --> 02:42:34,520
[SPEAKER_21]: I mentioned these magic words.

1833
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:40,823
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you, whore, for making me pay so much money for going to see a subpar production.

1834
02:42:40,924 --> 02:42:42,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I want everything in pristine condition.

1835
02:42:44,065 --> 02:42:45,146
[SPEAKER_21]: It's highway robbery.

1836
02:42:45,226 --> 02:42:47,147
[SPEAKER_21]: No wonder people pirate your goddamn movies.

1837
02:42:48,468 --> 02:42:49,669
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's my thing, okay?

1838
02:42:49,689 --> 02:42:52,550
[SPEAKER_19]: It was playing on like six to eight screens in there.

1839
02:42:52,951 --> 02:42:55,672
[SPEAKER_19]: Take out the bad film, play it less.

1840
02:42:56,293 --> 02:42:58,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my God, five screens.

1841
02:42:58,374 --> 02:42:59,835
[SPEAKER_19]: How will we survive?

1842
02:43:00,335 --> 02:43:02,636
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, seriously, just play it less.

1843
02:43:02,656 --> 02:43:03,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Play another...

1844
02:43:04,386 --> 02:43:07,908
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure more people want to see a shark's tail, so go ahead and play that instead.

1845
02:43:08,368 --> 02:43:14,111
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they could have easily taken this out of rotation, but instead they're like, ah, fuck it, no one's going to care.

1846
02:43:19,034 --> 02:43:19,514
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1847
02:43:21,275 --> 02:43:25,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's move on and go to the other angsty folks in our studio right now.

1848
02:43:25,117 --> 02:43:27,278
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll start it off with DDR Angel.

1849
02:43:28,739 --> 02:43:29,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually have to burp right now.

1850
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:30,360
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

1851
02:43:32,862 --> 02:43:37,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, just, FU to just being tired today, I don't even know what's up, everybody seems tired today.

1852
02:43:39,445 --> 02:43:42,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I don't know, just, there's no reason for it, I shouldn't be tired, but I am.

1853
02:43:43,486 --> 02:43:44,166
[SPEAKER_15]: FU to that.

1854
02:43:44,747 --> 02:43:56,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, again, FU to the flaky instructor that I've got, because that sucks, but, whatever, he's still deciding to hold class every once in a while, maybe he'll get over it and realize, oh wait, uh, I have a job to do.

1855
02:43:58,572 --> 02:44:01,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, that's about it, I'm like, not 80, what the hell.

1856
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:05,119
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not really ever that angsty, Angel.

1857
02:44:05,159 --> 02:44:06,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I've only seen you angsty here one time.

1858
02:44:07,242 --> 02:44:09,245
[SPEAKER_21]: And it took an act of God to make you angsty.

1859
02:44:11,228 --> 02:44:11,548
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1860
02:44:12,069 --> 02:44:14,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley, Arcadian42, what's on your mind?

1861
02:44:15,489 --> 02:44:19,270
[SPEAKER_29]: Of course, fuck you to, uh, Folsom PD, and... Surprise!

1862
02:44:19,430 --> 02:44:32,933
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, uh, Fakira, and all that, and all, fuck you to me for getting myself into that, and that situation, and all the decisions, and delays, and everything that caused it, and, yeah, so forth.

1863
02:44:34,653 --> 02:44:42,535
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh, what else, uh, fuck you to having to make up all that time, but at least my work is nice and will let me make up time.

1864
02:44:42,555 --> 02:44:44,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me in, let me in

1865
02:44:45,051 --> 02:44:53,074
[SPEAKER_29]: Fuck you to the honey-backed ribs or whatever the new thing at Applebee's for sucking.

1866
02:44:54,134 --> 02:44:54,694
[SPEAKER_28]: Woo!

1867
02:44:55,694 --> 02:44:56,075
[SPEAKER_29]: No, honey.

1868
02:44:56,275 --> 02:45:00,036
[SPEAKER_29]: It's like honey... honey barbecue ribs.

1869
02:45:00,916 --> 02:45:03,477
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, it's actually a rib thing, but it sucked.

1870
02:45:03,957 --> 02:45:08,158
[SPEAKER_29]: Riblets are good, but it's like a new rib thing, but it sucked.

1871
02:45:09,239 --> 02:45:10,039
[SPEAKER_29]: It was like, bleh.

1872
02:45:12,250 --> 02:45:17,416
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, but at least it was free, because it was the free lunch day at work.

1873
02:45:19,198 --> 02:45:21,721
[SPEAKER_29]: So at least I didn't have to pay that money for it.

1874
02:45:23,463 --> 02:45:25,705
[SPEAKER_29]: And, uh, yeah.

1875
02:45:28,268 --> 02:45:30,471
[SPEAKER_29]: Actually, just ROD for the DVD, but...

1876
02:45:31,593 --> 02:45:43,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, of which I haven't gotten very many tonight, surprisingly enough, so if they don't get in in the next 30 seconds or so, they're probably not getting read, but that's alright, we have a few.

1877
02:45:45,737 --> 02:45:51,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Raichan says, F you to friends borrowing things and not returning them.

1878
02:45:52,222 --> 02:45:56,305
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to people that drive in the fast lane and are going 15 miles an hour under the speed limit.

1879
02:45:57,046 --> 02:45:57,747
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to loners.

1880
02:45:58,067 --> 02:46:02,791
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to people that continue to try to use you for all your worth and can't take a hint when I say no.

1881
02:46:03,731 --> 02:46:06,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and F you to taking a frisbee to the lip.

1882
02:46:07,214 --> 02:46:08,835
[SPEAKER_21]: Ow, ow.

1883
02:46:11,217 --> 02:46:11,798
[SPEAKER_19]: What, Loki?

1884
02:46:12,098 --> 02:46:14,360
[SPEAKER_19]: Said you're not a dog, you can't catch it with your mouth.

1885
02:46:16,336 --> 02:46:17,937
[SPEAKER_21]: Something tells me she wasn't trying to do that.

1886
02:46:18,538 --> 02:46:19,158
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, though?

1887
02:46:19,178 --> 02:46:19,999
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what's a lot safer?

1888
02:46:20,059 --> 02:46:20,779
[SPEAKER_21]: What were those things?

1889
02:46:20,799 --> 02:46:22,300
[SPEAKER_21]: They're like frisbees, but they go further.

1890
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:22,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Robies?

1891
02:46:23,061 --> 02:46:24,041
[SPEAKER_21]: What were those things called?

1892
02:46:24,462 --> 02:46:26,843
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's like throwing a giant saw blade at your head.

1893
02:46:27,103 --> 02:46:28,765
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the best thing ever.

1894
02:46:28,785 --> 02:46:30,085
[SPEAKER_16]: No, the Nerf ones, the plastic ones.

1895
02:46:30,105 --> 02:46:35,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the Nerf ones are the best ones because it just feels like you're throwing a fish at you or something like that.

1896
02:46:35,789 --> 02:46:40,072
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, the Robies are fucking dangerous because they go faster and they're more streamlined.

1897
02:46:40,092 --> 02:46:43,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously, it's like a saw blade getting thrown at you.

1898
02:46:44,844 --> 02:46:46,265
[SPEAKER_19]: But they're awesome, you can throw them in the car.

1899
02:46:47,606 --> 02:46:48,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1900
02:46:48,967 --> 02:46:52,110
[SPEAKER_21]: Didn't they have aerobies that were shaped in, like, strange shapes, too?

1901
02:46:52,170 --> 02:46:53,831
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, diamonds and stuff?

1902
02:46:54,071 --> 02:46:55,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, right.

1903
02:46:57,334 --> 02:47:00,617
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to my cold, and F you to my computer.

1904
02:47:00,777 --> 02:47:02,478
[SPEAKER_21]: I only heard half of tonight's show.

1905
02:47:03,039 --> 02:47:03,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Unacceptable!

1906
02:47:05,421 --> 02:47:05,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Fired!

1907
02:47:05,861 --> 02:47:07,162
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's fine, that's fine.

1908
02:47:09,164 --> 02:47:10,585
[SPEAKER_21]: He does good news for the website, so...

1909
02:47:13,990 --> 02:47:23,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Jazz says, F you to the fact that the projection people didn't turn off the lights for like 15 minutes into the movie and the fact that the grudge was more funny than scary and the rest of my audience agreed.

1910
02:47:24,534 --> 02:47:26,014
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought the grudge was scary.

1911
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:30,896
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought the grudge was really scary.

1912
02:47:31,956 --> 02:47:32,677
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's it.

1913
02:47:32,777 --> 02:47:34,077
[SPEAKER_21]: He reminded me of the other thing.

1914
02:47:34,778 --> 02:47:41,160
[SPEAKER_21]: When I went and saw, I think it was, I want to say it was Kill Bill 2 over there, they didn't turn off the goddamn lights.

1915
02:47:42,062 --> 02:47:42,683
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what it was.

1916
02:47:42,703 --> 02:47:43,343
[SPEAKER_16]: It was Kill Bill 2.

1917
02:47:43,383 --> 02:47:47,106
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, when I went and saw Kill Bill 2, they didn't turn off the goddamn lights for like 15 minutes.

1918
02:47:47,406 --> 02:47:51,650
[SPEAKER_21]: And you would think such a little thing would not be so annoying, but it was really, really annoying.

1919
02:47:52,190 --> 02:47:55,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jazz, for reigniting that angst within me.

1920
02:47:58,035 --> 02:48:03,119
[SPEAKER_21]: Lastly, Poto says, F you to writing a paper on two hours of sleep.

1921
02:48:06,161 --> 02:48:06,341
[SPEAKER_21]: Aww.

1922
02:48:07,002 --> 02:48:09,144
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember being such a procrastinator like that.

1923
02:48:09,184 --> 02:48:09,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Still am.

1924
02:48:10,214 --> 02:48:13,495
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing my paper during my lunch break tomorrow, and it's due tomorrow night.

1925
02:48:13,755 --> 02:48:14,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Amen to that.

1926
02:48:16,296 --> 02:48:16,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1927
02:48:16,876 --> 02:48:18,297
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to class tomorrow.

1928
02:48:19,237 --> 02:48:19,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, wait.

1929
02:48:20,878 --> 02:48:21,958
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to class ever.

1930
02:48:23,319 --> 02:48:23,599
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

1931
02:48:24,539 --> 02:48:24,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1932
02:48:25,419 --> 02:48:32,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess what we should do, let's open up the Skype line, because for God's sake, we haven't had it open the whole show except for that long chat we had with Frequency.

1933
02:48:32,142 --> 02:48:35,603
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically, Frequency took all your Skype time tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

1934
02:48:36,323 --> 02:48:36,843
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm kidding.

1935
02:48:37,124 --> 02:48:40,926
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll open it up a little bit for the folks to talk to us on Skype.

1936
02:48:40,946 --> 02:48:41,687
[SPEAKER_21]: So Skype's open.

1937
02:48:41,967 --> 02:48:47,430
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want more information on Skype, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

1938
02:48:47,811 --> 02:49:03,941
[SPEAKER_21]: We definitely would like your feedback to anything we've talked about during tonight's show, including lots of stuff that we had talked to Frequency about earlier, as well as, you know, other news, the Bomani Remix Contest, and machines breaking down, and kids in arcades, and projectionists that don't know how to tromp the goddamn light when the movie starts.

1939
02:49:04,002 --> 02:49:04,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, sorry.

1940
02:49:04,882 --> 02:49:06,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Getting a little bit off tangent there.

1941
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:13,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, we will accept your Ask Orange Lounge questions over private message and chat if you guys have anything you want to ask us.

1942
02:49:14,183 --> 02:49:19,046
[SPEAKER_21]: We only have a couple minutes left, so we're not going to make it an official segment, but if you have some questions you'd like us to address, go ahead and send those in.

1943
02:49:19,886 --> 02:49:23,388
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd also like to add that everything Sam Raimi touches turns to gold.

1944
02:49:25,729 --> 02:49:27,330
[SPEAKER_16]: And his car ends up in all of his movies.

1945
02:49:27,890 --> 02:49:33,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn it, I didn't look for it in the garage, but I don't know if that really counts because he just produced the movie.

1946
02:49:33,572 --> 02:49:34,453
[SPEAKER_16]: His car might be in there.

1947
02:49:36,294 --> 02:49:42,296
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm being told right now in our chat room that right now our very show is being played inside a truck stop.

1948
02:49:43,436 --> 02:49:43,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome!

1949
02:49:45,977 --> 02:49:49,618
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'd like to give a big yee-haw to all our trucking buddies down there.

1950
02:49:49,638 --> 02:49:50,079
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1951
02:49:50,099 --> 02:49:50,959
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm totally kidding.

1952
02:49:51,539 --> 02:49:52,459
[SPEAKER_21]: Please don't beat me up.

1953
02:49:53,860 --> 02:49:58,161
[SPEAKER_21]: No, but I guess we have somebody listening on a network over at the truck stop right now.

1954
02:49:58,181 --> 02:49:58,881
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's pretty awesome.

1955
02:49:58,901 --> 02:49:59,822
[SPEAKER_14]: I want a good truck stop.

1956
02:49:59,862 --> 02:50:00,682
[SPEAKER_14]: They have good food.

1957
02:50:00,762 --> 02:50:01,382
[SPEAKER_14]: I want hashbrown.

1958
02:50:01,402 --> 02:50:02,743
[SPEAKER_14]: They have good food over at the truck stop.

1959
02:50:02,763 --> 02:50:03,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, let's go get food.

1960
02:50:04,127 --> 02:50:04,807
[SPEAKER_19]: I want riblets.

1961
02:50:05,067 --> 02:50:05,908
[SPEAKER_19]: I want riblets.

1962
02:50:06,128 --> 02:50:06,988
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think they have riblets.

1963
02:50:07,349 --> 02:50:12,031
[SPEAKER_21]: But I need to be watching my weight because I have a performance to do on Saturday.

1964
02:50:12,051 --> 02:50:12,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, come on.

1965
02:50:12,811 --> 02:50:13,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Eat healthy food.

1966
02:50:13,892 --> 02:50:14,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Get some spinach with it.

1967
02:50:14,832 --> 02:50:15,612
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got to work early tomorrow.

1968
02:50:15,632 --> 02:50:17,313
[SPEAKER_21]: If I didn't have to work early tomorrow, I would totally do it.

1969
02:50:17,813 --> 02:50:18,854
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to work at 6.30.

1970
02:50:21,855 --> 02:50:22,196
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

1971
02:50:22,836 --> 02:50:26,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, we're supposed to watch the language because we're being broadcast at the truck stop right now.

1972
02:50:26,518 --> 02:50:27,918
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know.

1973
02:50:30,862 --> 02:50:34,384
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'll keep the mic away from Loki, if that's the case.

1974
02:50:38,026 --> 02:50:40,267
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I didn't even check the Skype thing to see if anybody called.

1975
02:50:40,347 --> 02:50:42,068
[SPEAKER_21]: Nope, still wide open there.

1976
02:50:42,128 --> 02:50:43,849
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I guess nobody wants to call us tonight, that's fine.

1977
02:50:44,329 --> 02:50:47,231
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine, we'll just talk to ourselves, we'll amuse ourselves here, that's fine.

1978
02:50:47,511 --> 02:50:49,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Any big Halloween plans for you, Loki?

1979
02:50:50,555 --> 02:50:51,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Just having a get-together over here.

1980
02:50:51,917 --> 02:50:55,983
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to watch Shaun of the Dead because I got my lovely promo copy of that.

1981
02:50:56,964 --> 02:50:58,046
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's going to rock.

1982
02:50:58,366 --> 02:50:58,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Shaun of the Dead.

1983
02:50:58,927 --> 02:50:59,949
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to try.

1984
02:50:59,969 --> 02:51:03,374
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to try because the people are going to have alcohol.

1985
02:51:03,394 --> 02:51:07,119
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to try to slip in one of my bad movies in there, but I don't think they're going to go for it.

1986
02:51:07,890 --> 02:51:10,673
[SPEAKER_19]: No one wants to watch my bad movies, and that makes me sad.

1987
02:51:11,294 --> 02:51:21,885
[SPEAKER_19]: I spend good money on those, and goddammit, if, you know, no one wants to watch, uh, what is it, uh, Blood Sisters of Lesbian Sin, you know, who will?

1988
02:51:22,325 --> 02:51:22,866
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll watch it.

1989
02:51:23,146 --> 02:51:23,486
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll watch it.

1990
02:51:23,506 --> 02:51:24,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on, make a plan for it.

1991
02:51:24,127 --> 02:51:25,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to see what the hell it is.

1992
02:51:25,708 --> 02:51:26,369
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a question.

1993
02:51:26,429 --> 02:51:27,931
[SPEAKER_21]: How many people are coming to this get-together?

1994
02:51:31,427 --> 02:51:32,868
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1995
02:51:33,408 --> 02:51:34,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Where are they all going to fit?

1996
02:51:36,348 --> 02:51:37,889
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1997
02:51:39,089 --> 02:51:39,829
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

1998
02:51:40,389 --> 02:51:43,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Sit on the floor, goddammit, because I'm taking... Language!

1999
02:51:46,051 --> 02:51:46,951
[SPEAKER_21]: Gosh darn it!

2000
02:51:47,711 --> 02:51:48,891
[SPEAKER_21]: Much better, much better.

2001
02:51:49,271 --> 02:51:49,591
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2002
02:51:50,451 --> 02:51:52,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley, you have any exciting Halloween plans?

2003
02:51:52,752 --> 02:51:53,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Nope.

2004
02:51:55,473 --> 02:51:56,553
[SPEAKER_29]: Sit on my ass at home.

2005
02:51:56,753 --> 02:51:57,133
[SPEAKER_29]: Do nothing.

2006
02:51:57,526 --> 02:51:58,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds like a plan of me.

2007
02:51:58,226 --> 02:51:59,227
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I'm doing.

2008
02:51:59,247 --> 02:52:00,167
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to see the Arizuka kids.

2009
02:52:01,188 --> 02:52:02,308
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a fabulous idea.

2010
02:52:02,348 --> 02:52:03,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's take out the Arizuka.

2011
02:52:04,189 --> 02:52:06,290
[SPEAKER_19]: We can put candy in it and it launches the candy.

2012
02:52:07,731 --> 02:52:11,012
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got like three days of Halloween because we're doing the big thing at work.

2013
02:52:11,592 --> 02:52:12,973
[SPEAKER_16]: I have my cat girl costume.

2014
02:52:14,434 --> 02:52:18,095
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I'm having Rocky on Saturday.

2015
02:52:19,156 --> 02:52:24,038
[SPEAKER_16]: And probably Sunday I'm just going to sit around and watch Interview with a Vampire on Laserdisc.

2016
02:52:24,505 --> 02:52:25,726
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.

2017
02:52:47,859 --> 02:52:50,721
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, what else I wanted to say?

2018
02:52:50,741 --> 02:52:52,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, remember the follow-up from last week?

2019
02:52:52,061 --> 02:53:02,066
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember we were talking about, in case you guys weren't listening last week, but we were talking about how we were going to do DDR on the big screen at some point.

2020
02:53:02,106 --> 02:53:08,810
[SPEAKER_21]: We were going to take that same movie screen and possibly have a Bomani night in the movie theater and possibly do a live taping of Orange Lounge Radio.

2021
02:53:09,270 --> 02:53:10,691
[SPEAKER_21]: Outlook is very good on that.

2022
02:53:11,031 --> 02:53:15,633
[SPEAKER_21]: We're hoping to get some help from other friends of ours within the Bomani community to kind of make that a success.

2023
02:53:16,073 --> 02:53:17,154
[SPEAKER_21]: But just like the

2024
02:53:17,774 --> 02:53:19,835
[SPEAKER_21]: TV show thing that had come up earlier.

2025
02:53:19,875 --> 02:53:24,456
[SPEAKER_21]: We're having a hard time figuring out exactly what we're going to do besides a live episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2026
02:53:24,476 --> 02:53:25,597
[SPEAKER_21]: But we want there to be more to it.

2027
02:53:26,957 --> 02:53:27,237
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

2028
02:53:27,257 --> 02:53:30,278
[SPEAKER_19]: I said let's set a virgin on fire.

2029
02:53:31,319 --> 02:53:32,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Get set a virgin's pants on fire.

2030
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:35,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh boy.

2031
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:37,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's set the ferret on fire.

2032
02:53:37,541 --> 02:53:38,341
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what we need to do.

2033
02:53:39,542 --> 02:53:40,082
[SPEAKER_14]: My baby's.

2034
02:53:40,422 --> 02:53:41,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Where's my baby?

2035
02:53:41,282 --> 02:53:41,682
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2036
02:53:41,702 --> 02:53:42,623
[SPEAKER_21]: He's funny enough.

2037
02:53:42,663 --> 02:53:43,723
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even know where the ferrets are.

2038
02:53:43,743 --> 02:53:44,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to see my baby?

2039
02:53:45,003 --> 02:53:45,764
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I don't want to see your baby.

2040
02:53:45,784 --> 02:53:46,504
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to get out and get it.

2041
02:53:48,490 --> 02:53:49,310
[SPEAKER_20]: No, don't do it.

2042
02:53:49,330 --> 02:53:50,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be your slave.

2043
02:53:50,511 --> 02:53:51,691
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't be your slave.

2044
02:53:53,231 --> 02:53:53,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Let my people go.

2045
02:53:53,691 --> 02:53:56,772
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got to play Katamari Damacy on the big screen.

2046
02:53:57,332 --> 02:54:03,274
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that's one suggestion that's come up, is that Katamari Damacy gets played on the big screen.

2047
02:54:04,034 --> 02:54:04,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2048
02:54:04,654 --> 02:54:07,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Somehow, we'll have to have some kind of little contest.

2049
02:54:07,275 --> 02:54:08,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, they have two-player mode.

2050
02:54:08,215 --> 02:54:10,236
[SPEAKER_21]: We can have a Katamari Damacy tournament or something.

2051
02:54:10,356 --> 02:54:11,736
[SPEAKER_16]: You can play as the cousins.

2052
02:54:12,296 --> 02:54:12,756
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.

2053
02:54:13,317 --> 02:54:14,437
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm liking this so far.

2054
02:54:14,517 --> 02:54:14,997
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm liking it.

2055
02:54:17,723 --> 02:54:30,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we're going to take a real quick break.

2056
02:54:30,467 --> 02:54:33,708
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do a one song break, then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.

2057
02:54:35,089 --> 02:54:36,869
[SPEAKER_21]: What song should we do here in this break?

2058
02:54:36,909 --> 02:54:42,391
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do... Well, we did pop in, we didn't do a guitar freak song.

2059
02:54:42,771 --> 02:54:42,951
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

2060
02:54:44,864 --> 02:54:45,024
[SPEAKER_21]: Language!

2061
02:54:45,064 --> 02:54:45,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Language!

2062
02:54:45,545 --> 02:54:45,825
[SPEAKER_21]: Language!

2063
02:54:45,845 --> 02:54:46,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Language!

2064
02:55:13,959 --> 02:55:26,012
[SPEAKER_19]: So, golly gee willikers, it would not, you know, upload to the, to the, um, server, and, um, so yeah, I couldn't make it available for people to download, that made me sad.

2065
02:55:26,713 --> 02:55:30,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and you said it sucks, okay, that's what I want to say.

2066
02:55:31,318 --> 02:55:35,042
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyways, this is, um, Paranoia Revolution, um,

2067
02:55:35,444 --> 02:56:05,136
[SPEAKER_19]: be sure you put in the one that's just Revolutions and MP3 because I changed it a few times because I just did not like the middle of it so I had to tweak it a little bit more but CDTemp Loki okay anyways so yeah here it is and it's glory and stuff and it'll be available for download soon I'm sure just have to get it to upload

2068
02:56:08,264 --> 02:56:09,646
[SPEAKER_21]: All righty, here we go.

2069
02:56:10,627 --> 02:56:11,667
[SPEAKER_21]: Paranoia Revolution.

2070
02:56:12,388 --> 02:56:15,171
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy, and we'll be back to wrap up the show after this.

2071
02:56:43,545 --> 02:56:44,186
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

2072
02:59:14,838 --> 02:59:18,959
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Paranoia Revolution here on Orange Lounge Radio, remixed by our very own Loki.

2073
02:59:19,499 --> 02:59:20,240
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I realized?

2074
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:22,780
[SPEAKER_21]: The bass line in that kind of reminds me of Suguru.

2075
02:59:25,861 --> 02:59:26,821
[SPEAKER_21]: Like it has the same rhythm.

2076
02:59:27,241 --> 02:59:28,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Listen to it towards the end.

2077
02:59:28,982 --> 02:59:33,623
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, it has the part, you know in Paranoia where it's all... Has that throughout the whole thing.

2078
02:59:37,385 --> 02:59:43,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yeah, so it's like a, what is it, uh, 12th notes and then, um, like some 4th.

2079
02:59:44,113 --> 02:59:45,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it's pretty cool.

2080
02:59:45,434 --> 02:59:47,837
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, it's a little bit, um, tweaked off of that.

2081
02:59:47,877 --> 02:59:51,201
[SPEAKER_19]: That's in the background, I know, for most of it, obviously, because I made it.

2082
02:59:51,722 --> 02:59:53,003
[SPEAKER_19]: But, um, I don't know.

2083
02:59:53,444 --> 02:59:56,347
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all that's done on the second thing right now.

2084
02:59:57,338 --> 02:59:59,180
[SPEAKER_19]: DDR Angel, what is your final thought?

2085
03:00:27,168 --> 03:00:29,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Katamari Damacy, because I can't stop playing.

2086
03:00:34,950 --> 03:00:37,991
[SPEAKER_21]: Final thought from Bradley.

2087
03:00:38,131 --> 03:00:38,851
[SPEAKER_00]: You go last, right?

2088
03:00:39,231 --> 03:00:40,011
[SPEAKER_21]: Arcadian42?

2089
03:00:45,953 --> 03:00:46,493
[SPEAKER_29]: Thoughts?

2090
03:00:49,934 --> 03:00:50,594
[SPEAKER_29]: I have none at the moment.

2091
03:00:51,824 --> 03:00:54,725
[SPEAKER_29]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

2092
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:22,144
[SPEAKER_16]: I have games to play, like I have Katamari Damacy now, I have Sims 2, and you know what?

2093
03:01:23,404 --> 03:01:25,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Real life is taking up all my time.

2094
03:01:26,246 --> 03:01:36,151
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've had to focus on school, everything, so there is a world outside of video games, not much one, and it usually sucks, but there is one.

2095
03:01:38,103 --> 03:01:57,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, and my final thought is, don't forget to listen to our other shows on Monday night, Diversion, Orange Zones Radio Remix Show, Tuesday night, Pump Up the Volume with DarkSakura, 7 o'clock Pacific Time, and, oh, I'm sorry, 7 o'clock for pre-show, 7.30 for show, and Wednesday nights on Orange Zones Radio, Outside the Box, with a special Grand Theft Auto San Andreas update!

2096
03:01:57,625 --> 03:02:00,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, very special Grand Theft Auto San Andreas update.

2097
03:02:00,747 --> 03:02:05,710
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the show on this station where we talk about the other games, other than the stomp your feet and tap your fingers games.

2098
03:02:05,850 --> 03:02:11,933
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we'll get to all that on Wednesday, and Tuesday, Jamie, I'm sure, will have another fun show, and Monday, remixes.

2099
03:02:12,333 --> 03:02:13,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Thursday, Orange Sounds Radio Rewind.

2100
03:02:14,915 --> 03:02:17,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Another night of programming is coming to Orange Sounds Radio soon, that's all I have to say.

2101
03:02:18,637 --> 03:02:21,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, the Long Versions program is going to launch...

2102
03:02:22,523 --> 03:02:26,984
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully, sometime this week, but like next week at the latest.

2103
03:02:27,184 --> 03:02:31,085
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we're going to have a long version program that's going to be at lunchtime for an hour.

2104
03:02:32,706 --> 03:02:34,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob, real quick question here in the studio.

2105
03:02:35,186 --> 03:02:39,767
[SPEAKER_19]: What about the, um, CK or something?

2106
03:02:39,787 --> 03:02:40,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Eh, okay, never mind.

2107
03:02:41,388 --> 03:02:42,388
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing to see here, move along.

2108
03:02:42,528 --> 03:02:50,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and, should mention, when you're, um, you know, not listening to Orange Knowledge Radio, New South Park coming to Comedy Central.

2109
03:02:51,653 --> 03:02:52,554
[SPEAKER_21]: Hooray, hooray.

2110
03:02:52,714 --> 03:02:56,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, the last word of this show, I'll give it to Loki.

2111
03:02:56,157 --> 03:02:57,478
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, the last word of tonight's show.

2112
03:02:57,598 --> 03:02:59,499
[SPEAKER_21]: One word that sums it all up for our listeners.

2113
03:02:59,519 --> 03:03:01,621
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't do it in one word.

2114
03:03:01,641 --> 03:03:02,141
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck yeah!

2115
03:03:03,382 --> 03:03:08,246
[SPEAKER_32]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2116
03:03:09,067 --> 03:03:13,230
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

03:04:45,630 --> 03:04:51,376
[SPEAKER_19]: No, because the show fucking rocked, and then they took it off air like they do everything that's good on Nickelodeon.

2157
03:06:59,258 --> 03:07:04,659
[SPEAKER_19]: Just because someone's a child molester does not mean that they cannot make good music.
