61
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,340
Don't you have anything else to do on Sunday night?

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,340
Villages to burn and convenient stores to rob.

63
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,340
Hey, I'm an angel. I'm not thinking of you like that.

64
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,340

65
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,340

Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Orange Lounge Radio.

97
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,820
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, this lovely October evening.

98
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,820
I'm so tired today, I don't know if I've got three hours' worth in me.

99
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:16,920
It's going to be like squeezing the sponge to get the last little drop out.

100
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
But I will do it.

101
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
For the listeners, I will force myself.

102
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,120
And if you don't do it for them, we'll force you.

103
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,680

109
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:47,060

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

115
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,160
I thought it was something else. See, I'm so confused. I have so many things going on right now that I'm just...

116
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
It's like spaghetti.

117
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Well, at any rate, I just had bucket that night and had dinner with Dan and had a nice time and relaxed.

118
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,160
But I'm still stressed as hell, so it's going to be that way until after Halloween.

119
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,980
I it's exactly how I feel yeah all right well I guess that does it for Jamie's

120
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:49,240
week let's talk to Loki you want to talk to us about your week yeah didn't really

121
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,400
do a whole month a lot of stuff oh what'd I do this week oh yeah I played

122
00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:00,200
leisure suit Larry all week that's pretty much what I did and other than

123
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,320
I played a little bit of Final Fantasy this weekend and and then

124
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,160
What else did I do? I don't know just kind of hung out

125
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
trying to stay out of the weather and

126
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,240
Yeah

127
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,920
Pretty much all that happened. Oh, and I bought an Arazuka yesterday because I was at the mall

128
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,820
I had money. I didn't want to buy a game because I'm just gonna rent it and

129
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,420
and so you know I couldn't leave empty-handed

130
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,820
so I got an airzooka instead. Virgin didn't have any echo image

131
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,260
of course why was I even looking because... WHAT?!

132
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,500
explain what an airzooka is for those listeners that don't know

133
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,540
it's a giant thing that shoots a ring of air at you

134
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:55,540
it's like a giant um... I don't know, it looks like a giant tube with a big elastic thing at the end

135
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Elastic thing at the end you pull it back and then creates like you know how if you've heard the blows of smoke rings

136
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,040
Well, it does the same thing creates like a shockwave of air that goes up there about 10 feet

137
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,100
And it's supposed to be harmless and you can like shoot it at animals and stuff and all that fun stuff

138
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:18,420
That's when Arizona is this giant thing that I waste a lot of well not a lot of money, but I wasted money on and

139
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:28,420
And, yeah, that's pretty much all that's been going down this week. It's been pretty boring. Pretty boring.

140
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:35,420
Oh yeah, that's right. Oh wait, I already talked about my trip though, didn't I? Yeah, I think I did.

141
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:42,420
Yeah, so. Okay, yeah, that's pretty boring. Oh, and I saw the Grudge. That was cool.

142
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Yeah, I'll talk about The Grudge in a little bit, because I saw it too.

143
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,420
But first, we'll talk to Arcadian, Bradley, and talk to him about his week, because I know he had a fun week.

144
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,420
Oh yes, I did. And it started off really, really fucking shitty.

145
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:08,420
I thought two miles from leaving this apartment last week, the fucking Folsom Police Department stops me, god damn motherfuckers, and says, oh...

146
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
After leaving this show.

147
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,740
Yes, right after leaving the show. Two miles away, the fucking guy pulls me over, and says,

148
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,620
Oh, you don't, your registration's out of date, so it's over six months, so we gotta tow it.

149
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,100
Fuck you. Don't!

150
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,300
Really fucking sucks. At least he didn't get me for speeding, because

151
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,580
it was right at a fucking place where it goes from 50 to 40, and he couldn't bust me for that,

152
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,540
but he didn't. And so, he goes to tow it away, he says, Do you have money? I say, Yeah, I do.

153
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,900
I went down to the thing and called Rob down to the and so he came and picked me up and took me home

154
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,980
Thank you, Rob

155
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,780
No problem because I was I was dropping off angel anyway, so we're down

156
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,620
Yeah, so sure they can pull you over for fucking you know expired registration

157
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,020
But they never catch anybody that runs the fucking red lights

158
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:02,900
Makes the goddamn left turn when there's a right turn only Lane and fucking just blatantly you know drives like assholes

159
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,320
Now they just totally forget that. Oh, but yeah, they can pull me over when they think that I made an illegal

160
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,720
With that I blew through the light and swerved around someone they say even though I made a legal left turn on a green

161
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,340
That's the Folsom PD for you. Oh and also takes two officers for every fucking stop. Yep

162
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,060
You think you can pull someone over and they just bring their back up because they have that many officers doing nothing

163
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,100
Yeah, they did that and Rob mentions a yo

164
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,400
I saw two people and he actually drive actually past me when I was stopped and God forbid

165
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,720
There's actually an accident there cuz then they'd get like six cars over there. I remember one time that we were sitting in

166
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,060
Subway and my friend accidentally because they were waving at us and stuff. They weren't paying attention

167
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:50,960
They had it in the wrong gear and accidentally rear they hit it in reverse and like backed into a car

168
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,920
And it took six cop cars to come to the Taco Bell to take down this report

169
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,920
And it just frustrated the hell out of me.

170
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Yeah, bitches.

171
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Well, then once I got home I called my manager and he said,

172
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,920
You better get it out tomorrow because those fees for the tow yards go up

173
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,920
astronomically so they can take away your car after a number of days.

174
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
They'll take away your car, put a lien on it, sell it off.

175
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,920
So you want to get it out tomorrow.

176
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Uh-huh.

177
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,920
So, after that, I had to wait until like 4am in the morning, called my mom on the east

178
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,640
coast and asked her to put in some money in my account and she did it for me.

179
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,660
So in the morning I called my coworker and she drove me over to the Carmichael DMV and

180
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:46,320
10 minutes after they opened I paid $319 and got my registration and temporary tags so

181
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,220
I could get a smog check.

182
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,400
And so from there, since the bus wasn't coming for 30 minutes, I decided, oh, I'll just go

183
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,880
ahead and start walking towards ARC, the American River College.

184
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,960
That took about, by 45 minutes later, I was there, even though my foot was hurting in

185
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,000
the beginning, but it didn't hurt after a while, so that was okay.

186
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,460
But after that, I took a bus from there to Greenback, then from there to Orangevale where

187
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,160
the thing was, the cohort, and it says, hey, okay, let's see if we can get it out.

188
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,760
Oh, you have to go to Folsom PD and get them to release it.

189
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,160
So you have to go there and show them that you've got your registration and everything.

190
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,960
So after that, I didn't know about the buses to there, so I started walking towards Folsom.

191
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,460
And I missed the bus that came next, so I said, ah, let's go ahead and walk.

192
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,160
So I walked another mile and a half down the hill, which wasn't too bad.

193
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,960
It was a nice day out and so on.

194
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,660
Then from there, I walked across the bridge because I missed the bus there.

195
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,240
I kind of just went on and then said, nah, I'll just go walk a bit farther.

196
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
So here comes the stupid part.

197
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,200
There's a, I've got like a little, the person at the tow yard set gave me a map, which is

198
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,200
a, you should go to Natoma Boulevard, or Natoma Street, but I thought it was Natoma Street,

199
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,040
and I thought it was like a right turn, so I, when I went to Natoma Street, I went and

200
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,800
turned to the right, and thought, oh, the levers are going up, and I didn't think to

201
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,280
go left and see if there was something up that way, I just went down this, kept going

202
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,880
down this road miles and miles didn't ask where any directions or anything

203
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,800
until I got to the end basically to a big cross street that's the lady that's

204
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,920
the lady of the apartment there apartment complex says where's the

205
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,280
chosen PD said it's Natoma there's no Natoma Street you did it she didn't say

206
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,680
that of course she was fighting it was crazy it's crazy guy walking away the

207
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:40,560
long way so after that I watched to walk back to the next bus stop that took me

208
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,000
to the top of the street and they had to walk like half a mile or so down to the PD. They

209
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,400
said, oh, okay, here we go, give me a ticket and say, okay, oh, we got to pay $20. Oh,

210
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,600
fuck, got to go across the street, get money out of the bank. Oh, my God. Then walked back

211
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,160
across the street, paid the money, then got to go back to the thing. So walked back down

212
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:07,040
to Riley and then got on a bus, which was good. The bus took me almost there, then paid

213
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,140
875 bucks to the fucking tow yard and got it out and yay

214
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,660
Then I went back to work for like three and a half hours and then made it up the rest of the basically made up my

215
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
whole week and

216
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,280
That was it for that tough lesson learned everybody out there register your car

217
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,760
Yeah, don't fucking drive in Folsom and don't ever come our way and in other news

218
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,120
I got keys to work so I can stay late and lock up the place if I

219
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,680
otherwise, after everyone else has left.

220
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,880
But if you want to make, you know, if you want to run through red lights and make illegal

221
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,420
left turns, Folsom's where it's at, because no one gives a shit.

222
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:53,960
Not broke now, because Mother gave me enough money so that I could do that, do that and

223
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
a little bit of extra money.

224
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,400
Which is helpful, because I could go and get a new tear mat, because my other one has a

225
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,800
hole in it that's been poking me in the foot for, like, three or four months, and go to

226
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:11,040
the mall of wart, the mart of walls and buy stuff. That's what I did today before coming

227
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
here.

228
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:19,560
Alright, wow, well, interesting week there. Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week

229
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
went.

230
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:29,960
Well, not much really. Just school and work. Although, my instructor is becoming quite

231
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:37,600
of a flake he almost canceled class on Monday yeah well I suppose he has his

232
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:47,760
own reasons um played a little katamari to Masi and other stuff this week maybe

233
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,920
like a couple hours worth of f11 which is not as bad as you guys but hey it's

234
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:04,280
something I also spent some time with well what one-third of Orange Lounge not

235
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,760
the host of course the other people that usually come here last night and spent

236
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,680
an hour waiting to get into dinner

237
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,600
yeah I can talk had dinner and watched movies and stuff last night that was

238
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:27,680
pretty cool which I don't get to do that often so that was kind of fun and that's

239
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,040
about it pretty much all right something else dad but I think you're gonna talk

240
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,560
about it okay okay I'll I'll talk about my weekend my

241
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,720
week in my weekend um pretty much this week was you know pretty nothing too

242
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,760
wonderful or exciting about me because I did two live show this week and I ended

243
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,760
filling in for Jamie on Tuesday just because we didn't have a repeat to run

244
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,960
and I was bored so I said what the hell so I did that Tuesday and of course I

245
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,440
had the regular show on Wednesday and then Thursday I hung out my friend and

246
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,120
pretty much nothing interesting happened till Friday when I went and saw a grudge

247
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,680
with Loki and his girlfriend and my buddy Christopher we went to this

248
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,440
theater my god it was packed not only was the theater packed but it was packed

249
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,240
full of high schoolers because apparently these movies really appealed

250
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,740
to the high schoolers and boy do we make a mistake going on opening night with all these

251
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,800
high schoolers in there because every scary part of the movie and there was a lot the

252
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:29,960
movie was pretty scary every scary part every all the girls like and like even it's I don't

253
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,960
want to ruin it but there's this one part where the screaming became almost rhythmic

254
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,940
it was like it was really funny I can't if you've seen the movie you probably could figure

255
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,340
out what part i'm talking about but this is one part where it just was rhythmic it was so funny

256
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,860
um but then there was this guy in the back of the theater he was being really annoying and you know

257
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,100
the type i'm talking about he's like that high school jock type he's sitting there like making

258
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,340
those noises because apparently other high school jock types find those kinds of noises funny

259
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,060
and they're girlfriends or whatever so he was kind of mocking how everybody else was getting scared

260
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,740
everybody. Oh my God! I want my mommy! And apparently this is funny when somebody does

261
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,620
this. Never mind that it's a sold out theater and he's getting on everybody else's nerves

262
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,400
in the theater and just bugging the hell out of all of us. You can just feel the tension.

263
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,100
Like everybody just wanted to turn around and punch this guy in the face. Am I right

264
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,900
Loki? Uh, sure. Okay. So finally, I don't know what came over me, but I just turned

265
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,380
in. Mind you, this is right at the climax of the movie towards the end of the movie.

266
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,760
still yelling and screaming he's been doing it for five minutes I turn around

267
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,940
I look right at him and I yell in the crowded theater I sell I said would the

268
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,540
guy with the little penis in the back row please shut the hell up and

269
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,300
everybody burst into applause and started laughing and thought was kind of

270
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,620
cool and then he shut up so he knew who he was by the way I addressed him by

271
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,960
being the small penis guy so my advice to you don't be afraid to shout it out

272
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,500
if people are distracting the movie because chances are everybody else

273
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,980
around you is finding them distracting too, and they'll back you up. They're just being

274
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,320
chicken. They don't want to say anything. So I can credit my couple years, oh God, several

275
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,160
years experience with Rocky Horror Picture Show for making me unafraid to yell back at

276
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,640
a movie. So, speaking of which, I ended up going to see a local production of the Rocky

277
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,680
Horror Show, which the movie is based on. They did a little bit of the play here in

278
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,640
Sacramento, and it was pretty nice. Rice Princess, she's been out, you know, she's usually on

279
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,520
Wednesday nights outside the box she's been out of the loop for a couple weeks

280
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,240
because she's been doing costuming for this show so I kind of went to see how

281
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,720
that all worked out the costumes were very nice as was choreography a little

282
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,080
thing I wanted to mention about it was the Broadway version the one that they

283
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,600
played on a Broadway in 2000 hmm so that's where the different people were

284
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,400
talking about well this isn't how the original play was because it actually

285
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,560
was the redo for Broadway yeah original Brian went back into the strip for

286
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:05,560
I recognize it because I have the 2000 recording, and it was the same thing.

287
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Very good. So, it was a good show. I liked it. Too bad it's over, so I can't really recommend it to anyone else because it's done now.

288
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Today was the last show, so if you haven't seen it yet, too bad.

289
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,560
And besides, a lot of you aren't in Sacramento anyway, so this means nothing to you.

290
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,140
but it is a good play if it comes to your town you should check it out it's

291
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,780
pretty funny how people can yell back

292
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,140
even at the actors even when it's not a movie and then other than that I've just

293
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,860
been doing a lot of rehearsal because there is going to be another production

294
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,180
of the movie soon

295
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,340
which I'm involved with so I've just been very tired going to rehearsal

296
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,700
some things like that and Jamie knows where I'm coming from with that certainly

297
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,660
Amen. I'm just glad I don't have to do prop crew this time around

298
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,260
I mean I like doing prop crew and that's all cool. I'm doing lighting and that means I'm going to just sit on my butt playing with light switches

299
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,260
It's a good job. It's an easy job. It's good.

300
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
Yeah, you know, I don't mind...

301
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
You have a lot of control in that little box.

302
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,260
I don't mind the running about, you know...

303
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
If someone makes you mad, you just turn the light off.

304
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,260
Well, I don't really mind doing the running about, putting stuff up on...

305
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
You know, it was fun.

306
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
But I was exhausted last time I did it.

307
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,260
And, you know what, I'm just going to sit back because I'm stressed enough.

308
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,260
So, after next week, it's just going to be so tired.

309
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Which, by the way, reminds me, you guys, next week is Halloween.

310
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,860
And so, on Halloween night, it's not looking like we're going to have a live show, you guys, just so you know.

311
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,560
Because it's Halloween and people want to go out and do Halloween stuff,

312
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,960
we actually don't think there's enough listener base,

313
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,660
because you guys will probably all want to go out and do your own things for Halloween.

314
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,160
So, what I think we might do next weekend,

315
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,860
we might do some type of very scary marathon of old Orange Lounge episodes.

316
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,860
We might fit that in next week, so...

317
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,560
That means we definitely get to hear Loki sing.

318
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,960
Yeah, that means episode 69 for sure would be in there,

319
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,400
because that has to be one of the scariest episodes we ever did so we're

320
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,280
gonna work something out where we do a marathon of old episodes so that's

321
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,400
pretty much it for my week of my day nobody had anything remotely DDR related

322
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,080
in their week at all it's just yes angel I was at fries and I met one of our

323
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:18,160
local freestylers? No. Prestige. Oh, okay. I've never heard. What, is Fry's the place

324
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,400
to play DDR in town now? Because I know that, um, what's, what's his name online? I can't

325
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,400
remember. Islander. I don't, I know his real name. I can't remember his name online. Islander

326
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,000
plays a lot at Fry's from what I hear. He plays a lot of DDR at Fry's because I guess

327
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,800
it's near his work. And then I guess Prestige goes there. You're going there and you're

328
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,920
playing DDR. Fries must be the place to be now all of a sudden. What happened to, well

329
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,080
I mean I know what happened to Golfland and all the arcades in town, but it's kind of

330
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,800
sad when a department store becomes the main DDR hangout in town.

331
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,600
Well, I was just shopping for geek stuff and well, he was there and so we just started

332
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,800
playing DDR for like 15 minutes and like eyeing the employees that work there because, you

333
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,520
know, I guess they don't see a lot of people that can actually play the game all day long.

334
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,800
So, that was pretty, uh, pretty cool.

335
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,160
He's pretty good. I liked watching him more than I liked playing myself, but

336
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,360
they had Xtreme up, and so,

337
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,880
we were playing that. It was fun.

338
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,320
Good times, good times. So,

339
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,560
it's getting sad, but there's just, you have to understand, there's really not a

340
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,160
whole lot of reason for us to go out and play DDR in this town anymore, because

341
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,920
really,

342
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,480
Nobody's really gotten anything new in

343
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,000
six months at least. When did Golf, I'm sorry, when did Guitar Freaks

344
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,360
9, 10 come out? What the hell version do they have anyway? 9?

345
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,440
I could give a shit after

346
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,880
5 really. They actually still have the same 8th Guitar Freaks, 8th Mix, where they put in

347
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,040
Drum Man, or Percussion Freaks, 9th Mix. That's it. Percussion Freaks, 9th Mix,

348
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,400
and Guitar Freaks, 8th Mix, which makes no sense at all.

349
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,560
Yeah, but that's the last new Bomani this town saw anyway.

350
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,800
Except the step mania machine, but that thing was broken so fast that it

351
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,980
you know, never really got to stick around.

352
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,680
So really I think at this point a lot of us are just sitting and

353
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,080
waiting in anticipation of Ultramix 2, because that's gonna be the

354
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,320
next big story. I actually did play DDR Extreme the other day though, it's still

355
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,280
it's still really fun to me. So that's one thing I guess I could say for it is

356
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,260
that I was playing on the ignition pad trying to

357
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,940
work some of my fat ass off because I've got a show to do next week.

358
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,220
... makes popin' music and 2DX8 also.

359
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,220
Absolutely, it's gonna be definitely a huge week,

360
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,980
November 18th, when festival and popin' music 10 and all that fun stuff,

361
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,820
2DX8 style come out too. Oh, you know we had a trailer. There was a trailer for

362
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,420
2DX8 style that came out not too long ago, and we completely forgot to mention it last week.

363
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,040
So I'm gonna make sure to bring it up tonight. In fact, I'm gonna do that right now.

364
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,960
If I can find that, here it is. Here's some audio here from a new preview that is out

365
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,480
for 2DX8 style, and I'll show this here in studio. Of course, you hear a little bit of

366
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Guadeca there. And it just shows the Konami logos here. And it says, ooh, 2DX8 style!

367
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,160
And it's showing a lot of the screenshots in the game and all these videos. You see,

368
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:33,660
alien world and a bunch of Japanese text something 50 and something 80 I'm sure

369
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:40,080
somebody in our chat room can translate that there new song

370
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:54,080
It's a very nice clip there of a Santa song.

371
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,080
This is a new song as well.

372
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Yeah, it's definitely an LED song.

373
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,240
look at that and it says there November 18 and had some clips from the new

374
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,800
videos in there as well so I don't even remember where I got that I think

375
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,580
somebody sent it to me so I would totally pass along where you guys could

376
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:25,680
get it except I don't remember they said 50 new songs over 80 songs in total and

377
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,880
they're confirming in our chat room Dark Lion XVI says the last song is Nebula

378
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,240
Grasp Grasper was that last song you heard a little clip of there and I the

379
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,040
But the one before that was the Santa song that's in the new pop music as well, right?

380
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,740
The one that she sang at Tokyo Game Show.

381
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,420
Correct me if I'm wrong.

382
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,420
I could be.

383
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
I don't know.

384
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
Alright.

385
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,680
Also in bemoning news this week, we got a little bit of bemoning news.

386
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,300
The box art for Ultramix 2 came out.

387
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,320
You might have seen this at your local store, actually.

388
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,520
And the interesting thing about the box art, though, is that it has a little thing in there

389
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,080
that talks about how it features dance hits. Like, remember how DDR Max said,

390
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,980
ooh, this features dance hits from Darude and Aurora and all the bands that were in there,

391
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,800
and then Max 2 was, ooh, it's Kylie Minogue. Well, this one says, featuring dance hits by

392
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,160
Delirium. We knew that after all, right? Elvis, we knew that. Rubbernecking. Freestylers,

393
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,640
which isn't ringing a bell with me, so I don't think we know about what this song is,

394
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,840
and they've tried to do research, I think, over on the DDR Freak thread,

395
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,840
But nobody's come up with what song that could be yet, so maybe we'll hear more about that later

396
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,600
But we have the Commodores which we know is a brick house

397
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,680
Nucleus which is jam on it. We talked about that before Captain Jack I

398
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,220
Believe the dream a dream booty mix was confirmed previously and now

399
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,660
Jason Nevins presents Holly James well

400
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:57,080
Guess what Jason Nevins and Holly James? They only ever did one song together, so that pretty much

401
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:06,160
no I did that song was just announced recently so anyway we're going to go

402
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,320
ahead and play that song for you guys right now it's Jason Nevins and Holly

403
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,080
James and the song is called I'm in heaven and we'll play that for you guys

404
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,720
now this hasn't been confirmed but it's kind of one of those things where it's

405
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,680
like well unless it's a remix or something like that who knows so we're

406
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,880
gonna play that for you guys right now. The assumed radio edit would be the

407
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,100
version they'd use in DDR because we haven't heard if it's a remix again. It's

408
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,600
kind of unconfirmed but at the same time when it's on the box art, you know, duh. So

409
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:46,600
So here it is, Jason Evans with Holly James, I'm in Heaven.

410
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm in heaven with you

411
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,600
I'm in heaven with you

412
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel

413
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,600
When these feelings I have really are for real

414
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,600
The time is right for this, a love to shine the moon through

415
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,600
But you gotta tell me what you wanna do

416
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm in heaven with you

417
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,600
I'm in heaven with you

418
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,600
I'm in heaven with you

419
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I'm in heaven with you

420
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm in heaven with you

421
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Every time you're near, I start to lose control

422
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,600
When the thought of you hits my very soul

423
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,600
When you're lying in my bed, right next to me

424
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
That's when it starts to feel, feel like ecstasy

425
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I'm in heaven with you

426
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I'm in heaven with you

427
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I'm in heaven with you

428
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:23,600
I'm in heaven with you

429
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:17,560
I'm in heaven with you I'm in heaven with you

430
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,560
All you want from me, all you want from me

431
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,560
You'll never make it through

432
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
All you want from me

433
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,200
public service announcements from Orange Lounge Radio.

434
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,480
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and that was a song that has not been confirmed

435
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,280
yet it pretty much has by the box art. I'm in Heaven, Jason Evans featuring Holly James.

436
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,200
What do you guys think of that? Pretty cool. Yeah, did you realize that that's actually

437
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,240
a former Cage Match winner from this program? I remember that song. Yes, Loki, Loki picked

438
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,200
that song a while back or at least I don't know if it was necessarily that

439
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,580
mix I think it was one of your white label mixes very close that was it oh my

440
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:35,520
bad okay so that was it so now Jamie you had picked delirium after all in a cage

441
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,360
match once yeah Loki you picked that one which was in a cage match one I want a

442
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:50,480
song in ultra man it's not fair no oh yeah we'll see all right maybe one day

443
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
Chicks are for kids.

444
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
All right.

445
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,360
Maybe one day.

446
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,540
So what we want to do now, I actually want to go ahead and give somebody a call here

447
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,540
on the Skype line.

448
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,540
We tried to get him on the show here last week, but unfortunately the connection was

449
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:08,560
really bad, so everybody keep your fingers crossed that the connection is a little bit

450
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
better tonight.

451
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Somebody's got their fingers crossed.

452
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Yes?

453
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,480
Okay, so hopefully he's there, and I don't embarrass myself here on the radio, but we're

454
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,040
going to go ahead and give this a try here.

455
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
I hope it works.

456
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:31,440
One ringy dingy, two ringy dingys, three ringy dingys, four ringy dingys, god I hope he's

457
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
there.

458
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,480
That'd be pretty funny.

459
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Hello!

460
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Hello.

461
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Hi!

462
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Is this frequency?

463
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,880
Oh no, the connection's still kind of shy.

464
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,360
Can you hear me okay?

465
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:53,560
Oh no, we're still having a problem hearing him, he's very choppy, you only hear a couple

466
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,000
seconds here and there, and then that's it.

467
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Are you...

468
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I hear you falling.

469
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,320
Oh, there you go, I can kind of hear him.

470
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,120
You might have something with your mic sensitivity settings, I'm wondering if it's the mic sensitivity

471
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,880
because I heard like a little bit there.

472
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,880
Hold the mic up nice and...

473
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
Hello?

474
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
Hi.

475
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
Yeah.

476
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,400
Okay, so, I'm going to try and do a conversation here.

477
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,520
How are you doing this evening, frequency?

478
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,520
I'm doing okay.

479
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:33,360
I just woke up from that one weekend, you know, sort of back to earlier.

480
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,100
All right, so tell us a little bit about this tournament that just happened on the East

481
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Coast recently.

482
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,980
I was kind of curious about what went on there, because we don't get to talk a whole lot about

483
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,740
East Coast events on the show, so I'm kind of curious what went on with this tournament.

484
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:55,740
Well, I think that last one was not so good, but it's not for me, because I ended up trying.

485
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,740
You know what, I'm sorry, the connection for some reason, we're not getting them for some

486
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,740
reason. I'm only hearing like little bits and pieces of you, so gosh, I'm really sorry.

487
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,580
I guess what we're going to have to do, maybe we can try giving you a call later in the

488
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,160
the show I have another idea I'm gonna try getting back to you a little bit

489
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,160
later frequency I have another idea okay all right take care bud bye bye ah what

490
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,360
a bummer what a bummer I do have another idea though but I'm gonna I can't get to

491
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,840
it till the next break but that that does give me an idea okay so I guess we

492
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,080
have to shift gears here I darn cuz I have a lot of good questions I want to

493
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,160
ask them too and we don't get East Coast people on this show a whole lot but

494
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,480
But that's alright, we'll give it a try later.

495
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,520
Well moving on, I guess we could talk about other news going on.

496
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,720
Didn't you find some news about Pump It Up that was going on this week, Loki?

497
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,280
You got really bored and you found out that Pump It Up actually had some news going on?

498
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,880
Yeah, there was two things going on.

499
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,920
Number one being, there's another release that's coming out in November, I believe,

500
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,600
and that would be Pump It Up Exceed on the JPS2.

501
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,920
So that's going to be coming out, god damn it, dude our connection is fucking sucking

502
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,920
tonight.

503
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,200
Anyways, yeah, so Pump It Up Exceed, it's going to be coming out, it's going to be arcade

504
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,440
perfect, so there's going to be 100 plus songs, it's going to be coming out one week before

505
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,720
all the DDR stuff.

506
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,120
There's rumors though that it's going to be coming out also for the US PS2 and the Xbox

507
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:37,020
later on. Also, they've added a few different modes in there. They have a mode that's kind

508
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:43,620
of like where you just watch videos, the background videos and that type of thing. And also, supposedly,

509
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:51,940
the PC version USB pads that shipped with the old version, Premiere, I think actually

510
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:57,260
are going to be working with the PS2 version. So, that should be pretty interesting. Looks

511
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:07,940
pretty cool so far. Other than that, starting, looks like this coming week in Korea at Animero

512
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,900
headquarters will be beta testing for Pump It Up Exceed 2, which they haven't really

513
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:19,140
released any details on that. I'm sure that will be coming next week as stuff leaks out

514
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,220
from the beta test location. So that's your Pump It Up news.

515
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:32,220
Exciting. I think it's very strange that Pump It Up could possibly come to the U.S.

516
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:39,220
And then they're also saying, they're rumouring that In The Groove could be coming to the home versions as well, so it's going to be very interesting.

517
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,220
I doubt that one, but I do too, but they're saying it, so I guess I should acknowledge it.

518
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:51,220
I doubt that but no seriously McSeed though is doing extremely well like in

519
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,100
some of the other countries that you know non English countries like Mexico

520
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:01,940
is fucking hot over there and I couldn't I mean why not try releasing it over here

521
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,780
see how it does because I'm sure I mean most of the stuff they've got is in

522
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,660
house artists anyways so you're not really you know gonna lose money on

523
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:13,060
licensing as far as music goes really there's not much to lose there I mean

524
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,700
other than you know oh you have to make some new pads or something but I think

525
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,060
you'd do pretty well over here you know give it a shot I mean it can't be any

526
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,580
worse than like say you know Britney's dance beat and all that crap I mean at

527
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:30,940
least it's a step above all that stuff so you know hey why not I think it'd be

528
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,460
very interesting if they did give pumping up a home release for this

529
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,980
reason because DDR they've kind of stopped doing the arcade thing and I

530
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,860
think especially with DDR or I'm sorry with Konami USA they've kind of given up

531
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:48,700
on doing the arcade thing there's not going to be a new arcade mix unless hell

532
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,620
freezes over so basically it is possibility but very low chance low low

533
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,540
low chance so basically they've pretty much stuck to the home versions and I

534
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,580
think everybody understands that the home versions are where they make their

535
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,660
money and Konami of America they push the home versions it's their bread and

536
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:08,140
butter for DDR they see the future of DDR being these home versions and that's why

537
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,460
they never really threw a fit over the import mixes at least as far as I can

538
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,860
tell because the import mixes of DDR arcade kind of serve as promotion for

539
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,460
the home versions so everything works out everybody you know gets their share

540
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,520
well now if pump it up ends up coming up for the home coming out for the home

541
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,620
versions was Konami gonna take issue to that is there anything they can do about

542
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,620
it me I don't know I mean there were those rumors a while back that and Amira

543
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,220
Konami might have had it out in court and that's why you know I don't know

544
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,460
it's a bunch of rumors going on out there you think Konami would take issue

545
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,700
that what do you think would happen anybody have thought Loki I'd especially

546
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:50,060
be curious what you think you I seem to have a strong opinion I don't know if

547
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,240
they're legally able to bring it over here actually because of the whole

548
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,060
lawsuit thing earlier but then I don't know if they're you can't really I mean

549
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,300
I'm sure the DDR hasn't gone after you know Konami hasn't gone after any of

550
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:10,940
these other games that have similar rhythm type things with them, I'm sure it'll be fine.

551
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,140
I mean, it'd be pretty cheap if they just went after them, if they started doing well.

552
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,400
I mean, oh yeah, well now that they're doing well, I guess, yeah, we have a problem with

553
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:27,460
it now. But, yeah, I don't know. To be honest, I really don't know. But, here's the thing,

554
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:33,940
here's my concern okay about in the groove coming to the home console first

555
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:39,700
off I don't think it's gonna happen only because one it's gonna be hard I mean

556
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,380
making a console games a little harder than making you know just the arcade you

557
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,300
know ports and stuff cuz I mean hell anyone can hook up a PC to an arcade

558
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:51,940
machine it's not that hard now I'm programming for the home console is a

559
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,100
little different well if it's fucking hard enough they have 11 12 footers in

560
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,100
in the arcade, how the fuck do you even play that on a softpad? That's never gonna work.

561
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:04,100
So, that's my concern right there. I don't think it's ever gonna happen. I mean, it...

562
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,100
I'm sure they'd like to see it happen, but feasibly, I don't think it's gonna happen.

563
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,100
Very interesting thought. Anybody else

564
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,100
have a thought on In the Groove coming out for home, or what Pump It Up may

565
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,100
do for DDR? Well, Pump It Up actually did have a home

566
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,100
release on PC. That's right, I forgot about that. Was that in the US, though?

567
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:31,060
Well, yeah, actually, Red Octane sells it, and I don't think they sell the import DDRs,

568
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,060
or do they? I could be wrong.

569
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,060
Yeah, I saw that too.

570
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,060
Oh, do they?

571
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,060
I think so.

572
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,060
Huh. I'm not sure. Yeah, I completely forgot about that. You're right, Pump It Up did have

573
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:44,620
a previous home release on the PC. Not that the dance market on PC is very lucrative,

574
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:49,420
I believe the folks that created DDRPC found that out the hard way. You know, I saw those

575
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,100
games going for like $10 a pop at Fry's not too long ago.

576
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:58,820
go. Interesting. Do you think... I think I got mine for about the same. Do you think

577
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,860
that Pump It Up coming out for the home version would help DDR? Or do you think it's going

578
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:10,220
to hurt it? You know, I think that after they compare, but I don't know. It can depend.

579
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,900
There's different factors to consider. I think the biggest turn off is that you'd have to

580
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:20,260
get a whole other dance pad for Pump It Up. Because, although it would be very easy, you

581
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,880
would think with the ignition pad you could just use the buttons the XO

582
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,000
circle square which are in the corners but there's no center button there's not

583
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,840
the center doesn't do anything on those pads as far as I know so it you're kind

584
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,560
of screwed there the pump it up pads not only do you have the corner buttons they

585
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,680
do have the up down left right buttons also because those are for song select

586
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:48,760
stuff they use those so yeah so theoretically any DDR pad that has all

587
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,380
the corner buttons would work except the official Konami ones because they don't have triangle

588
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,420
and what's the other one that's missing? They don't have triangle and square on the back

589
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,240
like most of the other pads do except all the other pads are missing that center button.

590
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,900
So now you've got to have a whole new dance pad if you want to play Pump It Up at home.

591
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,460
And how many people are that obsessed with Pump It Up where they're going to spend all

592
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,180
the money on that? And how many stores are going to pick up those Pump It Up pads for

593
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:16,140
commercial sale? Because, you know, you find those third party pads in every little store

594
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:24,060
that sells video games now. Well, you never know. I mean, it could possibly. It could.

595
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:29,680
The possibility's there, but how successful can it be when it's so limited, when Konami

596
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,600
kind of has a grip on it as it is? I don't know. It'd be interesting. Alright, I guess

597
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,960
what we're going to do now is we're going to take another break. When we come back,

598
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,520
we'll hopefully have everything set up so we can try calling Frequency again. That'll

599
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,780
be very cool if not I guess we'll have ourselves a cage match that'll be some

600
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:54,040
fun and we'll talk about some more DDR bimani when we come back in this break

601
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,280
let's do well you know what I kind of want to do if I can find the music let's

602
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,360
do some DDR Disney you play fire yeah I think that's a good idea let's see if I

603
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:11,640
can find the directory that has all my random stuff in it oh shoot not all the

604
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:19,520
the Disney stuff's in here. Okay, we'll see what we can do. Oh, I do have the Mickey Mouse

605
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,040
Okay, we'll we'll we have enough to do a break. We'll be back after this

606
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:56,520
M-I-C-K-Y-M-I-U-S-E

Minkin' out, minkin' out

621
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,920
All around the world marching

622
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,720
All around the world marching

623
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,720
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

624
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:30,840
All right, jump in the mist, get the pressure, get the pressure, get the pressure, get the

625
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,840
Get to pressure!

626
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,840
You've had the time to rest

627
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
which is coming to an end

628
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,840
and we start again!

629
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:53,840
Back to the family, a guaranteed emergency, the radical M.C.X. wish he got the level of peace

630
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,840
One, two, three, fire!

631
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,840
All our friends, we've got to make a message to take care of you.

632
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,840
We're gonna get there

633
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:47,840
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

634
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,240
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

635
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,200
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More

636
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,200
program.

637
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,200
Can we talk about that?

638
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,700
subject will ever be taboo. Well I was thinking maybe we should move pump up

639
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,820
the volume from Tuesday nights. Except of course the subject that was just under

640
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:10,700
discussion. Okay well what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the

641
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:16,740
attack music we play on the station? I collect your fucking head. Just like this

642
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:22,660
fucker here. Oh my god why did you do that to Loki? The

643
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,660
The alcoholic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

644
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:33,660
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

645
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:41,660
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

646
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:46,660
You know what I never understood, Jamie, is why does your voice sound so different in that promo?

647
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:51,660
I don't know. I was taking just these voice acting lessons and decided to sound like Lucy Liu.

648
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,660
Oh, I see. Maybe it was something like that.

649
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,660
I think I did pretty well, don't you?

650
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,660
I think so. I think so.

651
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,660
Now, I got this new thing for Skype that allows us to dial phone numbers,

652
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,660
so I'm going to try this real fast. I'm going to do a test.

653
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,660
I hate to do this live on air, but damn it, I want this to happen.

654
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:10,660
Ooh, it worked.

655
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,660
What the hell do you want?

656
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,660
I think it worked. Hello? Can you hear me on this thing?

657
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,660
Yeah, there's a delay, but that's cool.

658
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,660
I'm on my phone and I'm here.

659
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,660
You need to hang up. We don't want any.

660
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,660
Alright, I'm hanging up on him. Cool, it worked.

661
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:28,660
Okay, so hopefully we can do that and make it work.

662
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:32,660
It's a little quiet, but maybe I can tweak the volume settings in there and get it to work.

663
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,660
Would you like to take a survey?

664
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,660
You're crazy.

665
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,660
No, no, I'm not crazy.

666
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:48,020
slightly strange Loki's the crazy one with his portal to hell and all that

667
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:58,620
all right how's it going there look you're trying to figure out what that

668
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,660
freestyler song could be huh you're trying to do research there what were

669
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,540
you doing there earlier you're hacking that master file thing that I don't even

670
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,040
I can't even remember what the hell this thing is.

671
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:14,040
It's the master song list, I was looking at it, from...

672
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,040
Where does that come from, the master song list?

673
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,040
Well this is from, it's a document that,

674
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,040
or it's a file that's in,

675
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,540
well this one's in the DDR Extreme USA CD, or DVD.

676
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,540
So I was looking to see,

677
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,040
cause there's a few songs in there,

678
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,040
I see some from the new,

679
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,040
new Dancing Stage game that's gonna be coming out,

680
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,040
and then there's a few that I didn't recognize.

681
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,040
So I was just seeing if I could figure it out,

682
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:42,040
Cause I'm in here, remember we, you know, reported a few weeks back about Superstar.

683
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,040
That's in there.

684
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,040
So, um, you know, just stuff like that.

685
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,040
So I was just seeing if it might be in there.

686
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,040
Cause it might be. You never know.

687
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,040
What is that you're...

688
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,040
No, I found out, I had the microphone in my lap and people can hear me being IM'd.

689
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,040
I'm sure.

690
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
My bad.

691
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:13,040
Alright, I guess what we're going to do is go into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match for this week.

692
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,040
You want to change your song? Do you have a new one?

693
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,040
Yeah, um, hold on a second.

694
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,040
Alright, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match tonight.

695
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:40,040
Last week in the Orange Lawn's Radio Cage Match, Echo Image won for the fourth week in a row, meaning they are retired.

696
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,040
Goodbye. You're gone. You're out of here.

697
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:52,040
But let's have one more moment to remember the Echo Image, the very first song ever to be retired in the Orange Lawn's Radio Cage Match here.

698
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:58,500
Let me feel if the song here the song was called come back and here's a little bit of come back for you to remember this

699
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,500
song by

700
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:19,100
Alright, that's enough of the song.

701
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,820
You've heard enough of it over the past four weeks.

702
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:28,460
Alright, so you get three brand new songs in their entirety tonight, each host bringing

703
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:34,460
one song to the table. And who's going to go first tonight? I guess I will. Why not?

704
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,980
I never get to go first because I hardly ever win this thing. So, I'm going to go first

705
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:44,300
tonight. I'm going to play my song. And, whoops, that's not the song I'm doing. My song is

706
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:51,300
a song by Ian Van Dow, who is the guy who did Will Eye from DDR Max 2. And he has a

707
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,120
new song out. And the song is called Reason. And that's going to be my cage match pick

708
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:03,120
for tonight. So, enjoy Reason by Ian Vandal, my pick. Song number one tonight.

709
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:37,120
Do you think it's time to realize Where is the love?

710
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:46,120
Are we gonna stay together Or is it time to say goodbye?

711
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,120
Where is the love?

712
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:55,920
Give me a reason to hold on to what we've got

713
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:02,720
Must be a reason to hold on to what we've got

714
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,320
Time has come to set things right

715
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:13,120
Is it worth another fight?

716
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:18,320
Tell me the truth

717
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,320
Is there something on your mind?

718
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,320
Tell me what you hide inside

719
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,320
Tell me the truth

720
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,320
Give me a reason

721
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,320
To hold on to what we've got

722
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Must be a reason

723
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,320
To hold on to what we've got

724
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,320
Give me a reason

725
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,320
To hold on to what we've got

726
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,320
Must be a reason

727
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:00,320
To hold on to what we've got

728
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,320
Are there things that I should know

729
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,320
Will you stay or will you go

730
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:14,320
Where is the love

731
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:18,320
Tell me, is there hope inside?

732
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,320
Gotta read between the lines

733
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,320
Where is the love?

734
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:55,000
Give me a reason, hold on to what we've got It must be a reason, hold on to what we've

735
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Give me a reason, hold on to what we've got

736
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Might be a reason, hold on to what we've got

737
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Give me a reason

738
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Alright that was song number one in tonight's cage match

739
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,500
That was Ian Bandau with Reason. Let's go around and see if they had a reason to like or hate this song in the studio. Jamie!

740
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,500
It's fancy.

741
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:54,500
Again, I'm really burned on tonight. But it's not bad. I mean, I've heard it before.

742
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
It's a 7. 7 now.

743
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,500
I actually thought Jamie would give it a lower score because I remember her saying she was sick of trance.

744
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,500
But dammit, I'm out of songs.

745
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
That's a new one that I happen to like.

746
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
Bradley, what'd you think?

747
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
I think it was pretty good. I'll give it an 8.

748
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,500
Fair enough.

749
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,500
Loki!

750
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:16,500
I'm not sick of trance, but I'm sick of Ian VanDahl, so I think it's a 6.

751
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:23,500
I like it. It's happy. It's not my favorite Ian VanDahl song, but I think it is worthy of a cage match title.

752
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
I give it an 8.5.

753
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,500
Uh, Ian VanDahl's cool. I'll give it an 8.

754
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:35,420
Alright, let's go on to song number two which is coming to us courtesy of the

755
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:40,480
lovely Dark Sacra. Dark Sacra what did you pick for us tonight? Well I need to

756
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,340
find the name of the song again because I remembered that you had it because you burned my CD. Let me give you a

757
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:49,500
hint the song is called everybody wants you to emerge. That's it it's a mix of

758
01:09:49,500 --> 01:10:04,660
emerged by fisher spooner and I had picked out like this remix of buster

759
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:12,540
move I saw that when you sent the file over earlier I was in my car and emerges

760
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:18,420
on my and this comes from the queer eye for the straight guy soundtrack right

761
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:22,580
yeah and every song on there is a good DDR song whether you love or hate the

762
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:27,940
show it's got a great bouncy soundtrack to it so let's see if this enough I

763
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:32,100
don't like the opening song yeah that's kind of weird I know the opening song is

764
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:43,180
like too gay but the rest of it's really good all right oh you should you should

765
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,260
have heard the thing on Tuesday I did a whole did you hear oh I did a whole

766
01:10:46,260 --> 01:11:10,260
On the test thingy, and I need that by the way, I remember being in Mobile and my friend's little Honda thing, just listening to the station play all those poppy dancey stuff like that, and then all of a sudden they'd be like letting me play what I was going to be having, and then they'd go back to the 90's.

767
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:15,680
If for some reason heaven forbid Orange Moms Radio ever went belly up and we weren't doing this show anymore

768
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,680
I think I would have to start an early 90s dance music station

769
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:23,200
Maybe we just want to start one anyway, compete with ourselves

770
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:30,500
Hey, there's somebody out there that I know we're trying to negotiate with somebody out there to do a new show on our network

771
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:34,180
And they're thinking of ideas for the show. There's a great one right there

772
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:38,020
there and I know you like that kind of music person in San Diego they have an

773
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:44,100
80s and 90s radio station it's the best of both decades

774
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:51,660
all right popular when I get Grand Theft Auto tomorrow all right anyway anyway

775
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:54,820
we're getting way off subject we're getting way off subject we have

776
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:58,980
something let's go to Fisher Spooner versus Billy Splier with everybody wants

777
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:05,980
to emerge. Enjoy.

778
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:33,980
Need to be merged from nothing

779
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:40,980
You don't need to step away

780
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:48,980
You don't need to be merged from nothing

781
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:55,980
You don't need to step away

782
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:39,980
Everybody wanna die, I wanna die

783
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:47,980
You don't need to be merged from nothing

784
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:31,980
Everybody wanna fall in love with you

785
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,980
Feels good

786
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:38,980
Looks good

787
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,980
Sounds good

788
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,980
Looks good

789
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,980
Feels good too

790
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,980
Everybody wanna fall in love with you

791
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:33,980
Everybody wants one, everybody wants one

792
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,980
Everybody wants you

793
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:47,540
Song number two in tonight's cage match. Fisher, Spooner versus Billy Swire. Everybody wants

794
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:53,060
you to emerge. Let's emerge our decisions on that song. Jamie.

795
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:59,060
You know, I really like that mix of it. It wasn't quite what I had remembered it to be,

796
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:03,060
But I still like it. So it gets an A from me.

797
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:07,060
One of these days I'm going to bring you this old song.

798
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:10,060
I was going to say, it samples an old song in there.

799
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:14,060
Because I've heard that old song at the raids before and I'm almost positive.

800
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:18,060
Well, Emergent is really cool. The song itself.

801
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:23,060
I really like that mix because it's a lot different than the original.

802
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:26,060
Okay. Alright, let's go on. Bradley.

803
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:31,820
I had no idea what the hell they were saying, and it filled me with eh, so I gave it a five.

804
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,540
Luggy!

805
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,220
I second the eh.

806
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:38,020
It was just like...

807
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:39,620
It got annoying.

808
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,860
Sorry.

809
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:47,740
Actually, when I heard that song, I kind of thought, this might be like a Guitar Freaks fun song.

810
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,740
It's kind of funky, I like it.

811
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,220
Man, that'll be funky.

812
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:57,420
I think that was pretty cool. Um, seven and a half.

813
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:04,220
Alright. Remember, our votes don't mean shit. It's your votes in the chat room that really decide this.

814
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,620
You got one more song that you can pick from.

815
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,220
God help us all, it's Loki's.

816
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:15,420
Ah, man. Well, I have a few things that'll win you over already.

817
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,820
Not trans, and short.

818
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:23,820
The other thing I forgot to mention that I did this week was saw Team America World Police.

819
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:27,820
And this is America Fuck Yeah

820
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:57,820
Now you have some answer to America

821
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:58,820
Fuck yeah!

822
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:02,820
So lick my butt and start throwing my phone, America

823
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,820
Fuck yeah!

824
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:08,820
What you gonna do when we come for you now?

825
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:11,820
It's a dream that we all share

826
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,820
It's a hope for tomorrow

827
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,820
Fuck yeah!

828
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:19,820
Together

829
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,820
Fuck yeah!

830
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:21,820
Promise

831
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:22,820
Fuck yeah!

832
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:32,820
Fuck yeah, baseball, fuck yeah, NFL, fuck yeah, rock and roll, fuck yeah, internet, fuck yeah, slavery, fuck yeah, fuck yeah

833
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:49,740
Summer, fuck yeah, Dizzy World, fuck yeah, porno, fuck yeah, Valium, fuck yeah, Reebok, fuck yeah,

834
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:45,140
Alright, gotta love Loki, song number 3 is a nice cage match from the Team America World

835
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,140
Police soundtrack.

836
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,300
America, fuck yeah, fuck yeah, or fuck no, Jamie.

837
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:55,300
It would be a humorous song for about 10 minutes and then they'd get over it.

838
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,300
Um...

839
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,300
It gets sick.

840
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,300
I don't know, I had no desire to see the movie, so...

841
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,300
Fair enough, Arcadian.

842
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,300
Fuck maybe!

843
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,300
Uh...

844
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,300
I'd give it like a 7-7-1-5.

845
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,300
Alright, Loki.

846
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,300
I'd give it a 10.

847
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:18,300
I was specifically instructed by my girlfriend not to sing the song any longer, so...

848
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:23,300
I hope you don't sing that while you're trying to have sex.

849
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:28,300
Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah! That's beyond!

850
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:33,300
I give that song the same score I'd give the movie a 4. Angel.

851
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:38,300
No, a 4 out of 10.

852
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:43,300
Um, it was okay. I was just listening to the movie last night.

853
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:49,300
Um, five and a half.

854
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,300
Go see what?

855
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:58,300
You could go see a good movie instead. Probably.

856
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,300
Seriously?

857
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:04,300
If you're gonna go see a movie, go see The Grudge, but go on a school night where the kiddies can't go.

858
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,300
Alright.

859
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:09,460
You've heard what we think, now it's time to hear what you think.

860
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,740
You're gonna decide tonight's winner from three brand new songs

861
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:15,660
while Loki throws pens at me in anger of my score.

862
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:18,540
All right, let's hear a clip from all three songs you can vote for tonight.

863
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:23,420
Song number one you can vote for tonight is Reason by Ian Van Dow.

864
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:41,620
Song number two in tonight's cage match is Fisher Spooner vs. Billy Squier, Everybody

865
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,620
Wants You To Emerge

866
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:59,860
And song number three in tonight's cage match from the Team America World Police soundtrack

867
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:00,860
America Fuck Yeah

868
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:09,860
Yeah, it's a dream that we all share. It's a whole new world. Fuck yeah!

869
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:25,860
Place votes now. Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your votes. Song number one, song number two, or Skye number three. Song number three, your votes can decide it all.

870
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:32,380
Now, you know the scary thing though about that Fuck Yeah song is it's actually, if you

871
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:36,820
took out the lyrics, it kind of sounds like a Guitar Freak song. It really does.

872
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:39,300
Yeah. Like an old one.

873
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,180
Wait, wait, we're losing you there. Adjust the bottom mic there.

874
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:49,180
Oh, yeah, yeah. Especially with the speeding up, like, bass drum part, kick drum or whatever.

875
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:54,020
Just like the little synthesizers and everything kind of make it...

876
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:57,340
yeah yeah it makes it it gives it that sound

877
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:01,240
alright you know what it sounds like PBR

878
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:05,300
like the end of PBR that's what it sounds like kind of

879
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:08,380
god I haven't heard limousine in a long long time

880
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:13,380
limousine! strong bad

881
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,140
oh boy oh boy I can't believe that

882
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:20,540
this is the first time we've had to retire a song you know we've been doing

883
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,700
the cage match for almost two years now that's the first time we've had to

884
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:26,740
retire song we actually haven't done the cage match since episode 1 it was

885
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:30,940
something we added to the show when we went three hours on episode 20 I think

886
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:36,380
because the show only used to be two hours all right all right we're gonna do

887
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:39,540
now we're gonna try and get that connection that we had earlier we were

888
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:43,260
trying to get frequency for the East Coast on the phone you guys I'm sure you

889
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,980
know this guy if you're on DDR freaked around the money style I think these

890
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,420
amount on both those sites and he's definitely out there if you're on the

891
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:52,740
East Coast you definitely definitely know this guy is so we're gonna give him

892
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:56,900
a call because we want to ask him some questions that were kind of spawned from last week's

893
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:00,100
show. So let's have a look and see if we can get frequency on the show.

894
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:07,300
Hello. Hi, is this frequency? Yes, it is. Hey, how are you doing? I'm doing okay. Good.

895
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:10,980
Oh, I'm so happy we can finally hear you a lot better. It's going to be unfortunately

896
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:15,260
a little bit quiet to our listeners, but that's kind of the best that we have to do right

897
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:20,100
now. But at least we can hear you fine here in studio, so that's the important thing.

898
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:24,100
Alright, so, how you doing? How was your week?

899
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:28,100
Um, the week was fine, um, you know, no problems there.

900
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,100
So, oh, look at that, the guy next door, that's great.

901
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:41,100
The guy next door has a ham radio and I like to interfere with all the electronics in my house.

902
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,100
I think it's just the forces don't want you to come on this show.

903
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,100
I guess so.

904
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,100
I guess is what it is, oh well.

905
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:54,060
So, as I was trying to ask you earlier before Skype was cutting us off, you went to a tournament

906
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,380
this past weekend.

907
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,220
Tell us a little bit about this tournament, because we're here on the West Coast, we don't

908
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:01,360
know anything about what's going on in the East Coast, and that needs to change.

909
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:05,140
So inform us on what was going on with this East Coast tournament.

910
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:11,660
The East Coast tournament was, the tournament itself wasn't really a good tournament, in

911
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,660
my opinion.

912
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:21,180
of itself just ran wrong and things weren't properly organized and things like that.

913
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:26,700
And we, you know, after the entire thing was done with, we, you know, realized what the

914
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,740
problems were and we're going to fix those for the next years and things like that.

915
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:35,860
But as publicity for DDR, it skyrocketed.

916
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:40,380
Yeah, now this is, now we actually had a caller last week, Zaku called in, he said something

917
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:44,940
about the crowds that had come to the DDR tournament were bigger than the ones for what,

918
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:47,380
the Blue Man Group and who else did he say?

919
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:52,860
Yes, it's literally, you could literally pick any exhibition there. Blue Man Group was there

920
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:56,860
for an hour and Ludacris and some other Def Jam artists were there for an hour, for a

921
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,780
little while. Opie and Anthony were there for a little while.

922
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,660
I'm sorry, Opie and Anthony was the only one you mentioned.

923
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,180
They're hacks anyway. No, I'm kidding.

924
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:11,180
So they were all there, but we still had a crowd no matter what.

925
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:17,180
These people, when they came, they had a crowd for a little while, and then when the people left,

926
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:20,180
there was no crowd at the other people's booths anymore.

927
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:26,180
Because these people were representing on XM radio and other things,

928
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:30,180
like O.B. Anthony was at XM radio for like an hour or something like that.

929
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:36,180
Obviously they had a crowd for a little while, you know, but you know, you can only stay so long and listen to Anthony, I guess.

930
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:44,680
But yeah, everyone was, everyone just stayed and watched people step on arrows all day. It was amazing. It was truly amazing.

931
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,680
Even Perfect Attack?

932
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:54,180
Yeah, more so than Freestyle, actually. There was a lot of people watching Perfect Attack that, you know, were just like, wow, this is amazing how they do that.

933
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:59,020
You know, and half the people are like, even though they don't know what they're doing,

934
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,860
they still want to know how they do that.

935
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:12,060
But publicity-wise, Sami, the person who put these women together, and myself, made a whole

936
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:16,300
bunch of contacts on Thursday because the press was the people who allowed it on Thursday.

937
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,340
I was going to say, I bet a lot of press was at this event.

938
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,260
Yeah, we had a lot of press.

939
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:31,260
So does this mean we can be looking forward to seeing DDR in the news any time soon, or in the press? Some big stuff?

940
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:39,260
Maybe not in the news and the press. There's already been enough stuff in the news and the press that it's in the wrong angle.

941
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:42,260
That's true. I guess that's very true.

942
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:52,260
The problem is that the angle is weight loss. Everyone likes that weight loss angle and everyone jumps on that. I was at Fox News a couple weeks ago.

943
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:56,260
I was actually going to ask you about that, the Fox News thing.

944
01:27:56,260 --> 01:28:02,260
I'll tell you exactly what happened. What they did was on Friday night I get a call from these people.

945
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:07,260
And I'm like, yeah, sure, I'll come in. They just want DDR. I'm like, okay, I can do DDR.

946
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:15,260
So I come in next day, because that's when they want me to interview live next day, with no preparation.

947
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:25,260
I'm sitting in the briefing room, not getting briefs. I was actually sitting next to the person who was interviewing me, and I had absolutely no idea until I was actually called in.

948
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:29,260
And when I got into the studio, the first thing the girl says is,

949
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,260
Well, you're not a kid.

950
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:36,260
And I'm like, No, sorry, someone should have probably informed you about something too.

951
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,600
they thought they were getting a twelve-year-old what yeah

952
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,960
and i do have a thought

953
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,400
they thought well you're always going to come in and

954
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:46,200
doing interview i remember that because we were watching the clip here in studio

955
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,380
during a show about a month ago and we were you know having a little fun with

956
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:52,460
how kind of bad the interviewer was the person who's ever you know

957
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,640
and it sounded like she was talking down to you like a lot of the questions he

958
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,540
was asking i i remember did she say at one point the interview

959
01:28:58,540 --> 01:28:59,400
gosh you're

960
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,820
how old are you

961
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,420
yes well you know

962
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,340
you know i was twenty one but the thing that got me the most of what you what

963
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:12,100
said, you're part of the DDR freaks, and I'm like, are you serious? Are you serious? Are

964
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,860
you really, what are you doing to me right now?

965
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,200
It's obvious they hadn't done any research.

966
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:21,140
So like, I mean, I'm doing it for DDR, you know, to get the publicity up there for it,

967
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:26,420
so even though it's just the wrong angle for it, I mean, I tried to jump onto, you know,

968
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:30,380
the competition thing, she just tossed it right off of that, so regardless, they're

969
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:33,380
They're not ready for it.

970
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:35,380
But, you know, upcoming now.

971
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,380
Wait, actually, I have a quick question for you.

972
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,380
I have a quick question for you, though, before we change the subject.

973
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,380
Do you think that part of that might be Konami's fault?

974
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:46,380
Because Konami's kind of going the weight loss angle with this?

975
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:50,380
Um, Konami hasn't done much.

976
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:54,380
I'll tell you right now, they haven't done much in the publicity of DER.

977
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:57,380
They, um, you know, and they don't really need to.

978
01:29:57,380 --> 01:30:03,020
too, because it just so happens that mixes keep selling, whole mixes at least, keep selling.

979
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:12,020
Yeah, it just happens. People see these dance mats in the game stores and are like, oh,

980
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:15,860
what does that go with? And they go with this D.P.R. game and they buy it, they take it

981
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:19,100
home, and there's a lot of people who actually play at home and they just don't know about

982
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:25,780
the community behind it and its competition and how big this can really be. So Konami

983
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:30,980
really actually doesn't do much but this upcoming year you might see some stuff coming out.

984
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:34,980
Interesting, so I guess other little things you probably can't talk about?

985
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:40,420
I can talk about them, it's just a lot of the stuff is, you know, works.

986
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:43,820
You don't want to say anything and then not have it happen, basically?

987
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:51,460
I'll say what we want to do, I'll say what we're planning, first off, Sammy and I have

988
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:55,620
a meeting with Ziff Davis Media tomorrow at 11am.

989
01:30:55,620 --> 01:31:00,020
Now aren't Ziff Davis Media the folks that run G4 Tech TV?

990
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,020
They might be.

991
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:07,180
I'm not too sure about the whole business, but I know that these are the people who put

992
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:15,100
together the actual convention last weekend, and they got Microsoft and XM and Intel and

993
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:20,600
Best Buy and all those other companies to come down and exhibit their stuff.

994
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:26,600
So they were so interested in our place that they want us to set up the next year's tournament

995
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:35,180
now with sponsors and they want all these companies that came to the convention to help

996
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:41,140
sponsor us in whatever way possible and we're looking at a really big grand prize at the

997
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:42,940
end of it.

998
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:49,180
No real dollar amount has been set but we're looking at something huge, something enough

999
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:52,300
to get, like, many more people to end up coming out.

1000
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:56,500
And, wait, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is coming off the heels of a $1,000 grand

1001
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,500
prize tournament, correct?

1002
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,500
Yes.

1003
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,500
And you guys are talking about something bigger.

1004
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,500
Right.

1005
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,500
Wow.

1006
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,500
Very nice.

1007
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:09,220
So, I mean, the $1,000 is actually put up by Sammy, but if we have people who, you know,

1008
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:12,980
like Microsoft, who want to put up some crazy amount of money, you know, especially when

1009
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:17,620
the swarm is going to end up happening later on next year, that people, you know, by the

1010
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:23,340
time this actually ends up happening, hopefully through all the publicity that we get, people

1011
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:29,020
understand that, you know, DDR is out there, it's a big thing, you know, that's what we're

1012
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:31,020
looking to do.

1013
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:36,120
Another meeting I have coming up soon is with Fuse TV, I don't know if you guys get that

1014
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,120
out there.

1015
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,540
Uh, they used to be much music, right?

1016
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:41,060
Weren't they much music, and then they turned into Fuse?

1017
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,380
I think that sounds about right.

1018
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:44,380
I think it's a subscription channel out here.

1019
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:45,380
Yeah.

1020
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:46,380
But I've heard of them.

1021
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:51,380
We have, I have a producer contact that I actually made, and he absolutely adores the game.

1022
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:57,380
He just found it on Thursday when he showed up, and he absolutely adores the game when he first saw it.

1023
01:32:57,380 --> 01:33:03,380
So I have a meeting with him in a couple of weeks, and we're going to pitch an idea, both together,

1024
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:07,380
to Fuse about a weekly DDR show.

1025
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,380
A weekly DDR show?

1026
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:10,380
Weekly.

1027
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:14,380
Not some kind of DDR special, you're talking about like a weekly DDR show?

1028
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:23,380
Right, exactly. We're looking, we're probably looking at, like, the only idea was that, so far, that I've had was a weekly tournament, and...

1029
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:28,380
Is this the OMG DDR game show that people have talked about for years?

1030
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:30,380
I've never heard of that, actually, but, uh...

1031
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:37,380
I see these threads occasionally on the message board where they're like, OMG, DDR game show type thing, could DDR be a game show?

1032
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:41,620
i i don't maybe it's just that it was it's couple years ago and i'm

1033
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:44,380
i don't know it just seems like i've seen these kind of ideas going around

1034
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:46,060
before where people are like

1035
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:50,100
omg they should have a ddr tv show and stuff and now you're saying that

1036
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:52,800
that's exactly what you're going to go pitch in a couple weeks

1037
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,180
it's probably not going to end up being a game show it's going to be

1038
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,020
something like uh...

1039
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:03,380
uh... do you remember i don't even know if you guys had this out here do you guys

1040
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:07,180
remember when they had this thing called the wmca championships

1041
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,980
it was a martial arts championship that used to

1042
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:15,340
televised on MTV, and they had all these characters, and they had the locker room scene where people get mad at each other.

1043
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:21,540
I actually remember this. It was a lot like the WWF, except it was karate. I do remember seeing a couple episodes of this.

1044
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,460
It used to be on channel 31, remember?

1045
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,320
I believe,

1046
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:29,160
probably it wasn't the same channel here, but you know, I think I want to do something

1047
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,940
similar to that, you know, like

1048
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:36,700
tournaments end up meeting like the real world and MTV kind of thing.

1049
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:40,580
You know, so like it gets, they kind of like, so you know the players, you know, and I'm

1050
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:46,460
not going to like, like, I don't know, force them with like, uh, acting because these are

1051
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:51,700
DVR players, they're not all actors, so like, we can't like pick and choose our players

1052
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:52,700
either.

1053
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,620
We want to, you know, showcase some good players.

1054
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:57,100
In other words, you're not going to ham it up like wrestling.

1055
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,700
Yeah, we're not going to, we're going to, you know, we're probably going to show how

1056
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:05,740
the people train and maybe do some interviews and maybe some little cute skits in there but a lot of

1057
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:10,540
it's going to be ended uh in my you know my thing we're going to actually just end up doing like

1058
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:15,180
a weekly tournament you know like red team versus blue team you know try to ham it up for a little

1059
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:19,580
while maybe like a battle box kind of thing where every like month we end up doing a championship

1060
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,500
for every few months or something like that and they get some kind of crazy trophy that we like

1061
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:29,420
you know pass around interesting but do you guys do you guys think you would run into any resist

1062
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:32,420
Do you guys think you would run into any resistance from Konami?

1063
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:08,720
If we have this contact here, which we obviously do, we can usually get the okay to do a lot of stuff, you know?

1064
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,920
And that's what we're going to end up trying to do.

1065
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:14,520
We're going to try to push DDR, just because of the love of the game.

1066
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,020
We're not even getting paid to do this, you know?

1067
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:21,520
We're just pushing the game to show it out, you know, get it out there and to the public.

1068
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,420
And we want to see more people in competition get this thing mainstreamed.

1069
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:28,620
And my personal goal is for it to be as big as the sporting events that are out there.

1070
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:33,980
You know the Yankees and the Red Sox that were out you know last week everyone was watching that on the East Coast at least

1071
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:38,760
I don't know what you guys doing out there a little bit a little bit. You know so like I want to have that so

1072
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:44,540
DER comes up you know on the television maybe ESPN or whatever and everyone knows

1073
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:51,540
You know what a great is and how many how many greats the JSB gets on this song and everyone knows the stats and that knows

1074
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:52,660
You know

1075
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:59,280
The players you know and roots for their favorite team like the new york blue impulse versus the california trip machines or whatever

1076
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:04,420
That's what we're looking to do. That's a hell of a goal, but that's a neat goal

1077
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:07,980
Yeah, that's that's that's loki you look like you want to say something here

1078
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:14,180
That's what we're pushing for and I want to expect that there's gonna be a huge jump in publicity in this next coming year

1079
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:15,940
I hope so, but like you know

1080
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:20,500
I don't know it seems like it's gonna be about as popular as extreme or extreme dodgeball

1081
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:28,500
It might end up being looking like that, at least for this first year coming.

1082
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:38,500
But with a lot of the more context that we're getting, especially Konami, it looks like there might be more push for it.

1083
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:49,500
Considering it's a new genre of video game, it's already a sport in Norway, so it's got potential.

1084
01:37:49,500 --> 01:38:04,500
It reminds me though of like that webcomic that's 10k commotion or whatever, it's just like you know with all the DDR drama and then you have the teams competing in a giant like tournament thing, it just seems a lot like that. Now if that's a bad idea, I think that's a pretty cool idea.

1085
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:12,500
Well you know there's drama everywhere, there's drama in celebrities and stuff like that so it's not going to be you know more common.

1086
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:22,500
I'll tell you what, if you ever want to take the DDR drama angle with this show, like Degrassi DDR League or whatever, I could give you pages and pages of real life fire drama.

1087
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:26,500
No, don't worry, I already have pages and pages. I think just about everyone knows I have pages and pages.

1088
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:35,500
You know, getting out of the tournament last week, a lot of the people actually ended up thanking Sammy for putting together the tournament, blah, blah, blah.

1089
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:40,500
And, to tell you the truth, Sammy screwed up a lot of the things about the tournament.

1090
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:47,500
And there were a lot of things that if he was more prepared, he would have actually ended up doing better work with it.

1091
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:51,500
And I ended up trying to fix a lot of it behind the scenes and things like that.

1092
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:54,500
And a lot of people don't even remember me being there.

1093
01:38:54,500 --> 01:39:02,500
It's annoying at one extent and it's not too bad at another because I kind of don't want to be attached to the tournament

1094
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:07,300
of the tournament being actually too bad, and I'm more attached to what happened otherwise.

1095
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:14,780
But I mean, there was this one incident during freestyle where Team Element from upstate

1096
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:22,140
New York came in to do the routine, obviously, to dive, and what happened was they went up

1097
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:27,180
for the first time, and Sammy wasn't ready with the camera.

1098
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:31,340
So Sammy says, wait, wait, wait, and tells one of the other staff members to reset the

1099
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:34,940
machine while they're mid-play. Well, not mid-play, but they actually were gotten to

1100
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:39,940
about 10 seconds of the routine. So Sammy goes, oh, I didn't know they started, right?

1101
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:43,180
That would have been fine. Don't worry about it. Just start up again. So they're like,

1102
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:47,620
okay, fine. So they start up again. And the problem here was that they forgot mirror.

1103
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:51,340
And we actually ended up forgetting to put event mode on, but that wouldn't have mattered

1104
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:56,620
if they, if they wouldn't have failed. So what happened was they ended up actually failing

1105
01:39:56,620 --> 01:40:00,020
halfway through the song, you know, the fail, fail screen comes up because they forgot to

1106
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:01,220
to put mirror on.

1107
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:02,380
Bummer.

1108
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,540
You know?

1109
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:05,060
So then they go ahead and they're like,

1110
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:05,880
oh, what the fuck?

1111
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,700
You know, we had it right the first time,

1112
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:09,700
blah, blah, blah, and then we're like,

1113
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:10,820
okay, you know what, just go again

1114
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:11,900
and we'll figure out something later.

1115
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:13,700
So they went again, they finished their routine,

1116
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:16,660
you know, and we figured out, you know,

1117
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:17,940
I was, right in the beginning,

1118
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,500
I said they're disqualified.

1119
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:24,500
And the reason I said that was because

1120
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:25,700
when you do a routine,

1121
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:28,620
everything about the routine is routine.

1122
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:34,180
When you put options on, when you put your clothes on, when you do the routine, everything

1123
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:35,580
is routine.

1124
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:40,500
There's no real excuse of not putting an option on.

1125
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:44,580
So you're saying the second they turn the machine over to you, it's routine time?

1126
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,580
Right, exactly.

1127
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:51,420
Once you have the option of choosing a song, making your options, blah blah blah, it's

1128
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:56,580
routine to you and it's part of the routine that's going to come out and show it to us.

1129
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:57,580
You know what?

1130
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:00,840
I can see why you're coming from that angle though, because a lot of what you just talked

1131
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:05,380
to us about, about this DDR TV show and stuff, you kind of were talking a little bit about

1132
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:08,400
kind of the hype behind it a little bit too.

1133
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,800
So I think, and we don't see this enough in freestyle, at least I don't see it enough

1134
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:15,760
out here, but there's not often a lot of build up to these routines.

1135
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,360
The routine is only the minute and a half, but yet they'll give you three minutes to

1136
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:23,040
do something, yet people usually just choose to do something for a minute and a half, even

1137
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,360
though they could probably have a lot more fun with it.

1138
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:29,360
There's also a lot of the problem that people just aren't prepared for freestyle anymore.

1139
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,360
There's no real big pot for freestyle anymore.

1140
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:35,360
You know, everyone wants the expert tech, no one really freestyles,

1141
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,360
no one really thinks they're good at freestyle,

1142
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,360
people think they're good at freestyle and they really aren't.

1143
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:44,360
You know, it's just like, there's not a lot of people that jump out there,

1144
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:47,360
get the job done, you know, and look awesome doing it.

1145
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,360
At least out here I've seen it.

1146
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:55,360
People just don't put themselves together and make a good routine.

1147
01:41:55,360 --> 01:42:01,360
To tell you the truth, when I did the Sports World Tournament two years back for Drifting Away,

1148
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:06,360
I actually was planning to do insertion for a month.

1149
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:12,360
I did this routine for about three, three and a half weeks, putting together every step, every arrow,

1150
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:15,360
had a move to it, blah, blah, blah.

1151
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,840
And at the end of it all, about three or four days before the competition, I scrapped the

1152
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,840
whole thing.

1153
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:26,280
I don't even know why, I think I just got sick of it or whatever, and I ended up doing

1154
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,280
drifting away.

1155
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:34,480
The day before, I literally slapped together, won the whole tournament, and that was the

1156
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,480
story about that.

1157
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:40,800
Well, you know, the practice of building the other routine, though, probably kind of helped

1158
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,480
in making the second routine, right?

1159
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,520
Did you end up taking elements of your insertion routine?

1160
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:51,040
Well, I don't know, like, there was more leeway with drifting away.

1161
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:56,960
Drifting away's Trick Little, No Freeze has no arrows for the first half of it, so you'll

1162
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:01,080
see me get off the pad and do whatever for a while and, you know, like I had more freedom

1163
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,080
to do what I wanted.

1164
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,720
With insertion, there was a whole lot of arrows.

1165
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:07,760
I just loved the saw insertion, but the problem was there was so many arrows, you know, there

1166
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:11,960
was a lot of stuff to work with and there was a big risk of me failing and, you know,

1167
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:17,780
I don't like the total big risk of failing, you know, at least back when I was actually

1168
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:18,780
competing.

1169
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:23,560
Although I might be competing soon because of the tournament last week.

1170
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:31,880
What happened was Sketch and Pfizer had a first place routine and it was a phenomenal

1171
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:37,240
routine and they got inspired through a lot of my stuff but I kinda got inspired to go

1172
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:41,820
ahead and beat their routine with something that I'll come out with later, and I have

1173
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:47,200
ideas in my head that are jumping around, and I can't really tell, not because I don't

1174
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:54,200
want to, but because I'm not sure when I'm going to compete. But I want it to be in any

1175
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:59,160
place that we're going to tape it and show it online, unlike the dropout freestyle that's

1176
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:03,280
still sitting on my side and no one knows what it looks like, not even me.

1177
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,440
Very interesting.

1178
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:14,440
So that's my plans. It's a lot of DDR publicity, and I guess some freestyle on a personal note.

1179
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:18,440
Well, I know we've been taking up a lot of your time here, but I do have one other question I want to ask you,

1180
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:24,440
because it has to do with something that the caller last week had brought up about hearing something about,

1181
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,440
and I don't know if you can confirm or deny this, but he had said something about,

1182
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:34,800
something about DDR maybe going out on tour with a rap artist. Is this a load of crap,

1183
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:35,800
or what is it?

1184
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:40,440
Well, actually, before we go to that, I'll tell you one thing that's on Thursday. Spike

1185
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:45,800
TV came up to us and said, is it DDR Machine for Rent? And we're like, well, yeah, because

1186
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:51,720
it's DDR Machine Rentals. That's why the company was obviously Sammy's. And they go, oh, because

1187
01:44:51,720 --> 01:45:03,720
We have this video game award show that happens in California at that point.

1188
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:06,720
We talked about this on one of our other shows, the Spike Lee's first annual show.

1189
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:11,720
Right, they want the DVR machine at the after party.

1190
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:16,720
But the problem is it's kind of out of the range because obviously that's the west coast,

1191
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:22,680
coast and the east coast and it's a very long haul for that DVR machine, you know, on Sammy's

1192
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:26,600
own because Sammy only has like a coverage range and then outside the coverage range

1193
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:33,920
there's a lot of, you know, money involved to try to get it out of that.

1194
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,800
But on to the rap artist, so basically what happened was we were in the middle of the

1195
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:45,080
tour months on Saturday and Ludacris and the F-Damn label were there and someone noticed

1196
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:48,600
it like obviously because it was actually probably on the other side of the screen

1197
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:52,680
that like ludicrous is probably on the other side of the curtain from where we were

1198
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:58,760
and i actually ended up seeing them but someone a representative from their production label came up

1199
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:03,640
specifically to me because i looked like i knew i was doing and they're like and they then they

1200
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:11,000
asked me um is this you know for rent or is there even a possibility of taking the machine onto arm

1201
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And, uh, you know, I was like, wow, you know, you want to have this thing on tour?

1202
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
That's pretty cool, you know, you can talk to Sammy, you know.

1203
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:30,000
So the person from Ludacris, uh, production label is asking for the DDR machine to be on tour with them sometime next spring or summer.

1204
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Interesting. Now what I'd be curious about though, is it on tour?

1205
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Cause you know how sometimes the big celebrities with a rock and roll lifestyle, or in this case rap lifestyle,

1206
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,440
they've got all the stuff that they have in their trailer stuff. Is this DDR machine

1207
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,600
for him to be using in his posse, or is it something he wants to have out there?

1208
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:50,160
I have no idea what he wants to do with it. It's just the fact, you know, it's just kind of funny that he wants it,

1209
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,360
you know. That's the thing that, like, you know,

1210
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:58,160
you know, jumps on it. Like, I mean, Sammy has that contact information. I don't know what they're doing with that.

1211
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:02,240
Yeah, because when I think about famous pairs, I don't really envision Ludacris and DDR, but

1212
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:06,200
whatever floats your boat. You know what? You're going to see a lot of stupid stuff soon.

1213
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:11,280
I'm going to tell you right now, there's going to be people in the sporting industry playing

1214
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,280
DDR.

1215
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:15,440
I'm positive it's just going to happen once it gets picked.

1216
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:19,440
Good, we need more stuff to make fun of here on our little program, so bring on all the

1217
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,440
silly stuff.

1218
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:24,720
Oh yeah, there will be plenty of silly stuff coming, I'm sure of it.

1219
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:31,280
But like I said, people will know once the show, if it actually ends up happening, the

1220
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,600
weekly show, people will know.

1221
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:36,920
We'll both be on DDR Freak and be Mani-style because I obviously am both affiliated with

1222
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:43,520
both sites, so you will find out through both of those sites that something will be going

1223
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:51,520
down at any point in time, whether it be the 2005 huge tournament or the DDR show or Ludacris

1224
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:54,360
getting the machine for a tour or whatever.

1225
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:59,680
You're going to find out one way or another through those sites.

1226
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:03,580
And as we have in the past, we will go ahead and steal the news and post it on our own

1227
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:06,420
site and post a link back to the site we stole it from.

1228
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:07,420
Of course.

1229
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:10,980
They can always check orangelounge.com too, or orangeloungeradio.com because we always

1230
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:12,860
put that information up as well.

1231
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:17,380
But definitely a lot of very interesting stuff it sounds like you got coming up in the future,

1232
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:18,380
so...

1233
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:26,900
Yeah, I'll expect something good is going to happen next year, you know, and there's

1234
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:36,260
And even talk, I don't even know if I want to say this, because of the media that we've

1235
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:41,300
received and the call from Hinabi that we also got, you know, this big uproar that actually

1236
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:47,820
happened in only a week or so, we have the possibility of requesting a new arcade mix.

1237
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:51,660
I'm jumping out of my seat!

1238
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,860
Yeah, right?

1239
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:57,100
well people are now like the people who people are like down there like wait a

1240
01:48:57,100 --> 01:49:01,020
minute wait what do you want to play arcade mix honestly listen here it is

1241
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:04,580
though this you know I don't think here's the thing I'm scared of this

1242
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:10,340
being wolf it's not definite okay it's not something that's like well okay

1243
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:15,280
we're really doing this it's a possibility because America's now

1244
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:20,780
finding out about DDR and it's a real big you know thing now that you know

1245
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:24,900
after this convention that happened, the public's like,

1246
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:26,020
wow, DDR?

1247
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,460
Oh, wow, this is an amazing game.

1248
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,180
Oh, wow, let's put this thing on TV.

1249
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:31,180
And then we're going to push it, push it, push it.

1250
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:33,700
And they're going to be bootleg illegal mixes.

1251
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:35,060
Yeah, right.

1252
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:38,700
Well, because Konami's going to notice this, obviously,

1253
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:43,660
because they called us, we hope they're going to help us out

1254
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:46,340
and show us, here, look, we got a new arcade mix for you.

1255
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:48,500
How does that sound?

1256
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:49,740
Interesting.

1257
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:51,600
let's go look at it

1258
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,120
but he has to be a part of it

1259
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:58,440
but that what he is convinced over here it's not gonna happen

1260
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,140
you know what

1261
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:00,600
proven wrong what

1262
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,960
all of what you know

1263
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:05,600
that were like gave up on thinking that the whole of the car out of the world

1264
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,600
so i could always

1265
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,700
you know i hope that the mail becomes out

1266
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:11,480
and that there's obviously people out there all of the like goals

1267
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:12,680
that fast

1268
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:13,880
no that

1269
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:17,960
like the high-quality to tell it i don't know it

1270
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,280
so we're we're

1271
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:24,000
me and Sammy, because of the levels of the game, want, you know, to push for the new

1272
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,120
arcade mix to come out because, you know, like the USA stuff is kind of like, you know,

1273
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:35,560
like sleepy and put together badly and, you know, Spell of Marvelous is with two L's and,

1274
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:41,240
you know, things like that. So, like, we want to see a new arcade mix put together and even,

1275
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:46,720
you know, if it ends up being like a home version, you know, like 6ix was, you know,

1276
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:51,720
There's still something else that's not in the group.

1277
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:53,720
Definitely.

1278
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,720
Here's my advice to you though.

1279
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:00,720
If Konami is going to do it, make sure Hawaii is involved.

1280
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:01,720
Because if...

1281
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,720
Hawaii?

1282
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,720
If Konami Hawaii, the folks that did Ultramix 2.

1283
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:05,720
Oh my god, no.

1284
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,720
Oh my god, you've got to be kidding me. You're not a fan of Ultramix 2?

1285
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:09,720
Let me tell you right now.

1286
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:10,720
Yeah?

1287
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:14,720
When Ultramix 1 came out, I thought it was all tournaments.

1288
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:23,720
I thought Tornamix decided to go ahead and put together a mix from Hawaii and send it out to people.

1289
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:30,720
Looking at where he said he'd go, when the thing speeds up to 280 bpm for absolutely no reason.

1290
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:38,720
You have all these songs in here that are quickening. Is it six footer? How do you do that?

1291
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:43,720
How do you put steps quickening as a six footer?

1292
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:50,720
You know, like, how do you do that? So with Elzerix 2 coming out, you know, and what's

1293
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,920
on there? Is Maximizer on there? Is that what's on there?

1294
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:59,200
No, that's on DDR Extreme. See, I was going to say, here's the other half of that. Okay,

1295
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:02,840
now if KOJ does it, then you're going to have Marvelous with two Ls, and you're going to

1296
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:06,000
have Karaoke Revolution crossovers. So it's kind of like Damned if you do Damned if you

1297
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,320
do.

1298
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:13,320
It's just that they need to be aware of what, you know, the people who want the game want.

1299
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:36,320
You know, I understand that they're trying to get another group of people, the people who play K-rev, you know, if they do get that in the long versions like that, or, you know, they're trying to get a different group of people putting U.S. songs in there like Move Your Feet and, you know, Afrika Bambaataa's songs, and, you know, they're trying to get, you know, the U.S. into their U.S. mixes.

1300
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:56,320
But it's not up to that, it's up to good songs like in the arcade extreme, and good stepcharts, and things like that that push for people to play that are real hardcore players and people that aren't even hardcore players that even actually end up playing.

1301
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:01,320
I mean, the regular public doesn't understand that this mix has faults to it.

1302
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:06,320
They just play the game, they see arrows, and obviously once they get into it, then they'll realize.

1303
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:16,320
And that's all they want to really go for. If they actually end up getting the shit together, then this could be ending up being good.

1304
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:29,320
And if we have some kind of affiliation with Konami, I mean if I have an affiliation with Konami at any point in time where I could say what we should put on a mix, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.

1305
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:34,680
very good but you know I can I cannot you know I can't see another you know

1306
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:42,040
home version song with some stupid step chart that looks like it's yes please no

1307
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:46,520
hand plants in DER please no I'm playing what's like to go an entire different

1308
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:49,680
show right now with you next week talking about how much I hate in the

1309
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:52,840
groove well actually we're not gonna be on next week but I would love to have

1310
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:56,320
like I could totally go on for hours and hours about how much I hate it but I

1311
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:01,320
I would love to have you back on the show sometime and we can dish on In The Groove.

1312
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:06,320
I actually was on the East Coast not that long ago and I got to go to it on the break and I got to check it out.

1313
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:10,320
And if I could sum it up in one word, interesting.

1314
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:15,320
Interesting, that's good, that's good. Interesting is definitely a good word for it.

1315
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:21,320
But yeah, to tell you the truth, I know I'm on all these big forums and everything,

1316
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:27,720
But if you see me on itgfreak.com, you'll see me flaming everyone.

1317
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:28,720
All I do is flame.

1318
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:31,160
Actually, I think I just registered just to flame the group.

1319
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:34,880
See, now you're just adding back into this DDR drama, the drama thing that you were talking

1320
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,880
about earlier.

1321
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:36,880
Degrassi was here.

1322
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:39,600
Yeah, that's all I do, because you know what?

1323
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,600
They really didn't care.

1324
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,400
I can almost tell that they didn't care.

1325
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:49,280
Or the people out there that are like, oh, I can make arrows and put arrows to the song

1326
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:53,620
and no one cares what they look like and, you know, it's really frustrating to look

1327
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:59,280
at that and have this be put out to, you know, arcades and have people play it, you know,

1328
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:04,820
or at least attempt to play it. I mean, once it first came out, it just, it didn't have

1329
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:09,300
a lot of, well it had a lot of like, wow, another, you know, dancing game, but now no

1330
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,500
one's playing it anymore over here at least.

1331
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:14,660
Interesting. Well, we'll get more of your thoughts on In the Groove a little later.

1332
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:18,260
We've taken up like over a half hour of your time. Thank you very much for being on the

1333
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:22,980
show tonight. Keep in touch with us. Don't forget about us when you're off doing all

1334
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:25,900
these projects and stuff. You're welcome back on the show anytime to give us an update on

1335
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:28,900
what's going on. And best of luck to you, man. Sounds exciting.

1336
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:29,900
All right, baby. All right.

1337
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:30,900
Talk to you. Have a good one.

1338
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:31,900
Have a good night.

1339
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:32,900
Later.

1340
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:33,900
Bye.

1341
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:34,900
Bye.

1342
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:40,100
Wow. Lots of interesting stuff in that interview. Lots and lots of interesting stuff. I didn't

1343
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:43,700
realize what the hell they're cooking up over there on the East Coast. Don't we feel out

1344
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:48,080
of the loop now over here on the west that's very interesting so what guy how

1345
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,660
can we sum up that whole thing for people that joined us halfway through

1346
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:53,020
that interview there because we've been talking to frequency about past half

1347
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:57,980
hour there but what DDR going on tour with Ludacris next spring we don't know

1348
01:55:57,980 --> 01:56:02,980
to what extent what do you say he's talking to Fuse TV about some type of

1349
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:10,340
DDR show that right now could could not be pitched with a WWE ish element or

1350
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:13,940
actually I wasn't the analogy is what do you say that the karate show fighting

1351
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:17,940
yeah yeah the the fighting show but he was saying maybe like a battle bots

1352
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:20,660
type of thing where it's like a tournament very interesting you see what

1353
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:25,500
happens with that lots of producer contacts apparently at that DDR could be

1354
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:28,540
showing up a lot in the media in the next few months and it won't be about

1355
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:34,220
weight loss and that's great and the more exposure the DDR gets in the media

1356
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:37,820
the more material we have to make fun of here on this show so we're definitely

1357
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:40,860
definitely looking forward to it. And then of course at the end there he's talking about

1358
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:45,920
if this gets big enough, don't wet your pants, but maybe a new arcade mix. But that's way,

1359
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:49,940
way off in the distance. Don't get excited just yet. But honestly, dreaming about new

1360
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:54,020
arcade mixes is sometimes what keeps shows like this going. Because if we knew the game

1361
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:55,700
was dead, would we be here right now?

1362
01:56:55,700 --> 01:57:00,380
I remember when we used to have new DDR.

1363
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:02,060
It's already feel like getting to that point.

1364
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:05,960
I remember when Max came out.

1365
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:13,440
You know, that show sounds like it needs, like, wacky, uh, very informative, um, commentators

1366
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:20,400
on that. Some people with, like, radio experience, and some DDR experience, and, and just, you

1367
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:26,600
know, something, someone that's been in the community for a while. Hmm, who could that

1368
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:27,600
be?

1369
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:33,440
We're trying to whore yourself out to everybody, Loki. Seriously. Alright, damn, you know what,

1370
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:37,440
I need a break. Thanks to frequency for spending, that was like, looking at the little timer

1371
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:42,640
going on, that was over 30 minutes of chat. Yeah. I think a break is a good call. Yeah,

1372
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:45,640
Jamie appreciates it too, because she's got a lot of work on her poster done over there,

1373
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:49,000
right? My posters are done. There you go. They're done. No, I was listening to you.

1374
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,640
No, I know you were, I know you were. It's just, I have this thing at work, where I have

1375
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:58,960
ten posters done, and I've got five done. No worries. And I need a moment to tally up

1376
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:03,160
those cage match votes, as it is. So we're going to tally up the cage match votes, and

1377
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:07,160
We're going to take ourselves a nice little break here, because damn, we need a break after that.

1378
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:11,160
So we're going to do a break here of some, how about some 2DX songs?

1379
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:16,160
I'm going to do a couple 2DX songs. We'll start it off with one of my...

1380
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:20,160
Let's do one we haven't heard in a while here. I'm going to do one from 2DX Fist Style.

1381
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:24,160
I'm going to do the Cube first, then we'll do Get On Beat. I'll try to get that in there too.

1382
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:27,160
And we'll be back in a little bit. We're going to do the FUs of the Week.

1383
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:32,160
We're going to let you know who won the cage match, and who knows what else when we come back.

1384
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:39,160
that. Alright, we'll get to Loki as well when we come back.

1385
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:26,960
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

1386
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,960

Nine

1399
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,960
Nine

1400
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,960
Uh, yeah, I was just playing.

1401
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:34,960
Hey guys, hope you're doing well, and I'll see you guys in the next video.

1402
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:03,960
whoa

1403
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:09,960
whoa

1404
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:14,960
whoa

1405
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,960
whoa

1406
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:26,960
whoa

1407
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:33,960
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light

1408
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:40,960
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming

1409
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:48,960
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight

1410
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:53,960
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming

1411
02:05:53,960 --> 02:06:22,200
Hi, this is Mel B. of RTF.

1412
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:27,200
or an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melody can join us on all the fun together.

1413
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:32,200
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to

1414
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:36,200
and still the fun is just as great. It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1415
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:41,200
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1416
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:44,200
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We gotta get Mel back on the show at some point.

1417
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:47,200
You know, he was gonna be here a couple weeks ago, but something came up, so...

1418
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:51,200
We gotta get him back on the show. We gotta get all our favorites back on the show.

1419
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:53,200
We'll have our people go get him.

1420
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:56,200
Yeah, we'll have our people talk to their people, etc, etc.

1421
02:06:56,200 --> 02:07:00,200
So, there's some other news going out there in the music and rhythm game world.

1422
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:04,200
We've just spent the past half-hour edition on DDR, but there are other games going on out there.

1423
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:07,200
One thing I wanted to talk about, Tycho Drummaster, actually.

1424
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:11,200
We've kind of mentioned this a couple times in the past few weeks.

1425
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:14,200
Tycho Drummaster is going to have its release on Tuesday, we're hearing.

1426
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,200
Angel, you've been kind of reading about this one.

1427
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:18,200
Are you planning on picking this game up?

1428
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:22,200
Yep, I'm going to try to pick it up.

1429
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:26,200
One of the sites I usually frequent to buy games says that

1430
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:30,200
the illicit price is $69.99

1431
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:34,200
for PS2, obviously, you guys know that.

1432
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:38,200
However, it doesn't state that there's going to be a controller included like they did with

1433
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:42,200
Donkey Konga for the GameCube.

1434
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:46,200
For $69.99, there damn well better be.

1435
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:51,860
one obviously so I'm 49.99 is the most I've ever heard them charging for video

1436
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:55,580
game and that's for top shelf games like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas things like

1437
02:07:55,580 --> 02:08:01,620
that right hey but Rob you remember how much I played for Samba de Amigo back in

1438
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:07,100
the day paid 80 bucks for the US controller and what was the game 50 bucks

1439
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:12,460
for the game back in the day I think the only game I've seen more expensive to

1440
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:16,820
import was Para Para back when it was at its height when it was at its peak.

1441
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:23,620
My DDR second mix on Dreamcast when Dan bought it for me, the game was $75 and he spent $80

1442
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:34,300
on my dance pad and I sort of acquired somebody else's dance pad.

1443
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:40,500
Now if Namco is smart, they've got one song in Taiko Drum Master, they can be riding the

1444
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:43,420
wave of success off of one of their other games right now.

1445
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:51,940
That's right, Katamari Damacy, the Katamari on the Rocks theme, is in Taiko Drum Master,

1446
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:52,940
so who knows.

1447
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:55,420
See, now that little green guy, I bet you anything that little green guy is going to

1448
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:58,660
become a little spokesman for Namco, it's just...

1449
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:01,540
Nah, they're almost going to have Pac-Man.

1450
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:03,700
Well, yeah, of course, they've got their staple.

1451
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:05,180
The Namco's a pretty good company.

1452
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:06,300
The little OG?

1453
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:11,840
allowed to have more than one mascot just like Nintendo's got Mario and Link

1454
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:17,420
Luigi and who the hell else they have and they got a ton of people. Not Mario, Wario!

1455
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:21,780
You finally got a chance to get your own copy of Kana Maridamashi this week

1456
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:27,220
right? Yeah. Yeah so did you were you playing it at all or you said you were

1457
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:31,700
watching? I was playing it some I played like at 3 a.m. I was like okay these mushrooms are

1458
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:35,100
tripping me out I'm going to bed. Are you see now I've talked about this a little

1459
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:37,940
a little bit on Wednesdays outside the box with Rice Princess and Linky Style, but since

1460
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:41,220
we have a different crowd here, I gotta ask you guys, do you think that this game's jumping

1461
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:45,300
the shark a little bit? Like, and it's not the game itself, the game itself, wonderful,

1462
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:49,780
awesome game, but it's kinda like, it feels like it's become the internet's latest, like,

1463
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:54,220
mail-forward type thing, where it's like, it's really funny, but you're gonna get sick

1464
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:58,060
of it, like, in a month. It's like, shut up about that goddamn ball rolling game already.

1465
02:09:58,060 --> 02:10:08,620
I don't know. Nope. I'm sorry, but, you know, it is human nature to love smashing things

1466
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:14,940
with a ball. Rolling over stuff has been with us ever since the automobile. Since the automobile

1467
02:10:14,940 --> 02:10:20,180
can smash objects, like small squirrels and stuff, it's been our desire to find those

1468
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:24,700
small objects to roll over. And the fact that the ball is sticky and holds more objects

1469
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:32,380
to make an even larger ball that's even better that was beautiful I think I like

1470
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:41,740
running over buildings and picking up cows and the stupid dog that keeps

1471
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:46,460
trying to run into you okay I was in this one part where this dog kept like

1472
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:53,760
trying to butt into me so I ran over the dog later on and that was gratifying now

1473
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:57,120
Now see in our chat room, here we go, we have one that says, I'm sick of it already.

1474
02:10:57,120 --> 02:10:59,240
This is like Super Monkey Ball!

1475
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:00,240
Come on!

1476
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:01,600
Now see, Super Monkey Ball I never got into.

1477
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:03,160
Monkey Ball is cool.

1478
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:05,560
It's cute and all, but I never got into it.

1479
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:07,120
It's like the Parappa for this generation.

1480
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:08,960
Generation, what am I saying?

1481
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:09,960
This year, you know?

1482
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:15,120
Because you know how Parappa hit and then kind of flew over, we're going to have like,

1483
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:17,840
you know, Katamari Damacy 2 is coming out, and then there's going to be like, I think

1484
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:18,840
a theme.

1485
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:24,600
There should be like, like Katamari Party.

1486
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:27,280
Mario Party, just with the little prince.

1487
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:33,640
Uh, I was gonna say that, uh, the game's got its little cult following now, so it's kinda funny, but, um,

1488
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:39,400
I was gonna mention that VGCatch jumped on, jumped on it as soon as it got, you know, the game got released.

1489
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:47,360
Uh, for those of you that don't know what VGCatch is, it took them quite a while, actually, to get on it.

1490
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:53,360
Anyway, I was gonna say, VGCatch is a, like, online comic for video games and stuff. Anyway, yeah.

1491
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:59,360
Interesting. Alright, uh, okay, let's get back on topic to talking about rhythm and music games here.

1492
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:02,360
Loki had some things he wanted to talk about with you guys, some news that's going on.

1493
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:08,360
Now you, I guess there's some remix contests going on that just finished up. What happened with remixing?

1494
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:18,360
Both DDR, it's like DDR Remix, which is just DDR Maniac's contest, which didn't have quite a turn out as.

1495
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:22,360
But my sales remix contest 1.5 or whatever that was.

1496
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:26,360
But anyways, there was some pretty cool stuff that came out of those.

1497
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:34,360
First I'll talk about the DDR Maniacs 1, the remix competition, because it's actually not done.

1498
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:46,360
They're not done. They're in voting right now, but they have the songs that were out there, so I'm going to play a few of these here. Actually, let me adjust my volume here.

1499
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:56,360
There was actually only four people that entered this, which is kind of a little sad, a little, a little sad.

1500
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:05,360
There was two by, you know, you might recognize DJ Potato. I'm trying to find these here. What do I have?

1501
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:14,360
Didn't we have DJ Potato on the show a while back? Oh no, I know what it was. His interview with Thomas Howard. Didn't we air some of that a while back?

1502
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:19,940
a while back. Yeah, okay, yeah, sure we know who Digipotato is. Okay, so we had, we had

1503
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:25,320
some of those. I'm trying to think, let me look this up real quick. There was only five

1504
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:32,040
entries. Two of them were his. They were actually, and I can play them for you guys, it was actually

1505
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:37,400
some work that he did, sort of, kind of, with the Bemani Rock album, but not, it's just

1506
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:47,120
piano and saxophone sort of remixes of, what the hell? What the hell was that? Yeah, give

1507
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:54,040
us a little clip of one of these songs here. Okay, well let's see here. We'll start off

1508
02:13:54,040 --> 02:14:02,680
with, let's see how these are old. Oh, I know, I know. Okay, we're going to start off with

1509
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:10,440
they had one of kind lady he actually a few of these he has like d2r 1998 kind

1510
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:15,560
lady there was another one too I can't remember what it was off hand but um

1511
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:26,720
anyways let's see here okay this one right here is gonna be they're like DJ

1512
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:36,100
a potato, a piano, a concentrato. Or is that? What? Shut up. Okay. I don't need your fancy

1513
02:14:36,100 --> 02:14:43,240
English, English talk, okay? Shut up. It's Italian. Whatever. European. We do not formally

1514
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:48,340
recognize the European nations, okay? I just want you to know that. They do not exist to

1515
02:14:48,340 --> 02:14:53,340
me. And you're psychotic with your English. Can I show you, I believe I think it's Italy

1516
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:58,020
right now is number three in our list of nations who's listening to this program when I was

1517
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:04,020
last looking at the geo-rankings. Watch your dirty little mouth, Loki. Whatever. Anyways,

1518
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:09,300
I was reading that quick, okay? I'm under pressure here. Anyway, this is DJ Potato featuring

1519
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:16,300
Tony Miller, which I believe he's on sax.

1520
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:47,300
I like it. Keep in mind, I played saxophone for like twelve years.

1521
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:52,300
You're listening to KOLR Smooth Jazz.

1522
02:15:52,300 --> 02:16:19,300
So that was that. Anyways, so, um, anyways, yeah, that was a few of the, that was one of the songs that was in there. There were some other remixes, but not a lot. Um, however, the Bomani style remix competition was a little different. There was quite a bit there. Um, I saved some of these really kickass ones on here, cause there was a few that were like, and even the judges said, what the hell is this? But, you know, there's always gonna be something like that.

1523
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:36,300
So, um, some of the ones I like to point out which were pretty cool, um, let's see here, um, some of them you've heard before on this show, uh, Clunk Clunk 2004, now that was, um, D.M. Ashura, and that was pretty sweet.

1524
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:56,300
Anyways, that one. And then we've got my personal favorite, Dazed and Destroyed. I loved this one before when there was only a clip of the song, but that's the whole thing.

1525
02:16:56,300 --> 02:17:04,300
The second half is kinda, eh, it's okay, but I mean, it's pretty well done for, it's a remake of Hysteria, so pretty sweet.

1526
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:32,020
It's a really cool song, trust me on that.

1527
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:35,020
and he's making Bitter Beer Face.

1528
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:42,020
It's different. It's different, and it's well produced.

1529
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:47,020
Well produced, maybe, but it sure isn't even a challenge. I'm worried.

1530
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:27,820
They sort of had an R&B version of Rainbow Flyer.

1531
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:37,820
Rainbow Flyer, the polychromatic allogum mix, let's see here, we've also got, but the winner,

1532
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:44,820
The winner of it all was Sextantbike with V1.

1533
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:06,420
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same contest you were complaining about

1534
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:11,960
out because they wouldn't allow fusion mixes and what won the damn contest now

1535
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:15,760
this was it's a little different now it's just they didn't want people just

1536
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:21,660
using acid to throw two songs on top of each other however there were some songs

1537
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:26,400
in there that were two songs thrown on top of each other how that got in is

1538
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:30,780
beyond me because I specifically remembered in the rules that that's why

1539
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:36,280
I didn't enter. But whatever. I don't care. Contest is over. It's a little late.

1540
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:44,280
But anyways, so yeah, that was that. Um, you can find all these songs under the, um, music production forum on Bamai Style.

1541
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:49,280
There's a whole list of songs you can listen to, good and bad, and they're all on there. Pretty cool.

1542
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:53,780
Um, one of the other songs that came out this week also was a remix of Vandy Angel by D'Amatura,

1543
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:56,780
because he can do no wrong, it seems like, with these.

1544
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:59,780
So anyways, I thought I'd play a little bit of that, because that's pretty sweet also.

1545
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:14,780
But, yeah, it's just, you know, a cool, like, long, trans universe, and it's just a trans song, so.

1546
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:20,780
But anyways, that was out. You can also find that in the Music Production Forum.

1547
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:25,780
Or you could listen to Monday Nights Diversion, the Orange Songs Radio Remake Show,

1548
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:32,780
because we'll definitely be adding some of these songs into our rotation there on Monday Nights from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

1549
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:38,780
Now, and the other thing I wanted to mention, and we mentioned this way back in the show a while ago,

1550
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:44,780
about, what was it, it was DJ Potato's Bomani Rock album that was going to be coming out.

1551
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:50,900
me coming out. I have a few full tracks, actually, from that. So, there's a few I'd like to just

1552
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:57,300
preview real quick, and we'll also be throwing those in to rotation as well. Max 300.

1553
02:20:57,300 --> 02:21:24,780
Alright, alright, alright, it's well done, don't get me wrong, but no more max.

1554
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:29,340
I need it! No more!

1555
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:32,340
The damn song keeps breeding, it's worse than Tribbles.

1556
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:39,340
This one is the one I like, Fear Train.

1557
02:21:39,340 --> 02:21:58,960
This one is a little harder to find, I believe this was in the 2DX form, there's like a sample

1558
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:03,660
thing from the Bomani Rock album, you can find that also on Bomani style.

1559
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:07,280
And that's pretty much all that's like music news.

1560
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:16,280
Now, there's a little other thing I read because we're talking about, you know, new arcade mixes and the set mania machine and in the groove and all that kind of stuff that kind of coincides with this.

1561
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:29,280
Now, for those who frequent the DDRUK.com site, you'll know that they created a set mania machine called DDX or Dance Dance X or whatever it is.

1562
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:40,640
Um, it's basically a StepMania arcade, um, game that they scanned. It looks really nice, and it was being played in a Namco, um, I think it was like a Namco cyberstation somewhere in England.

1563
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:44,280
And anyways, um, that's getting pulled out of there.

1564
02:22:44,280 --> 02:23:12,760
Um, because- not because of like, you know, licensing issues and stuff, but it felt the same fate that the, um, Golf Land machine was, and that is, it's not being fixed by them, and it's just falling apart, and damaged, and so, it's- no, just, everyone out there know that problems with little kids trashing shit, it's worldwide. So, you know, there are bad parents everywhere.

1565
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:22,680
Oh, and you told me that it happened during break. I was hoping it was going to be a legal issue story, so we could have a little fun with that, but you're just saying some fucking punks ruined the machine.

1566
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:23,980
That's it.

1567
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:25,440
That is it. Sorry.

1568
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:31,280
How boring! I wanted somebody to get sued! That would have been exciting.

1569
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,980
So no plans to bring it back?

1570
02:23:32,980 --> 02:23:35,380
They're just going to let it rot?

1571
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:43,580
Unfortunately, because what it was is, it was some guy's machine that he actually had brought there and let him, you know, use it and they would pay him some money.

1572
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:48,680
Well, they didn't pay him any money, and they trashed the machine, so he's getting pissed.

1573
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:56,080
But anyways, we will get a lawsuit story out of this after all! Hooray!

1574
02:23:56,080 --> 02:24:02,180
Anyways, the other thing I wanted to talk about was, there was a bootleg that came out a few weeks ago, Dance Dance King.

1575
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:12,780
It looked like a really crappy bootleg machine from China that featured gold colored pads and stuff,

1576
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:19,520
and had, um, what else? Oh, and it's basically a second, er, second mix, um, consumer style

1577
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:27,400
machine that was running from, um, a PlayStation. Literally, a PS1 was inside this cabinet.

1578
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:32,840
And that was quite interesting. I happened to contact these people. They want to, now,

1579
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:40,720
it wasn't their idea, they say, to, you know, bring this, um, you know, bootleg over here,

1580
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:45,240
But the guy wants to make a legitimate mix that was kind of interesting. I thought

1581
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,920
Good luck

1582
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:52,880
So yeah, that's all the

1583
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:55,960
Miscellaneous baumannii stuff has been going on this week

1584
02:24:56,960 --> 02:25:01,680
Next week. I have no idea. What's gonna be going on because I'll be playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

1585
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:05,600
So Lester's baumannii in San Andreas

1586
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:08,600
I have no idea what's going on.

1587
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:10,600
Fair enough, because we're not having a show next Sunday, remember?

1588
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:13,600
It's Halloween, and we're giving all the people a night off so you can go trick-or-treating.

1589
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:16,600
We will have a marathon of old Orange Honest Radio episodes, though.

1590
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:20,600
A very scary Orange Honest Radio marathon for you guys next Sunday.

1591
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:21,600
I don't know how long that's going to run.

1592
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:25,600
Stay tuned to the website for details and when your show's there.

1593
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,600
You know, Nelly almost got me the bi-karaoke revolution, too.

1594
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:30,600
Then my wits came about me and I said,

1595
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:38,880
me I said fuck no I am NOT playing that game fair enough actually I want to ask

1596
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:42,040
you about this right chance at me a private message is she linked me to this

1597
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:45,600
thread over on freak that's showing this I don't know if you've seen this but it

1598
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:52,720
is a step mania computer put inside an 80s era ghetto blaster and they've got

1599
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:57,460
the step mania logo painted over the speakers and this is actually computer

1600
02:25:57,460 --> 02:26:00,360
it looks like a boombox in the front but look at the side that's a little

1601
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:03,360
You see this, Jamie? Look at that. Old school.

1602
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:06,360
That makes me think of the Nintendo computer.

1603
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:09,360
You remember when they were building a Nintendo out of laptop parts?

1604
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:12,360
I'm sorry, building a computer out of a Nintendo shell and laptop parts.

1605
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:15,360
Yeah, it's the nice case mod.

1606
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:18,360
I thought of doing one like that, but putting it in Dreamcast.

1607
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:23,360
I still want one built out of a tool kit. A tool watch.

1608
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:25,360
Is that kind of thing hard to do?

1609
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:31,180
do? When it comes to technical stuff, I don't know shit. I know how to put a radio station

1610
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:35,680
on the internet, but that's about it. So, Loki, tell me about, is this hard to do?

1611
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:41,140
Not if you have a Dremel tool. It's pretty much, even since that boombox was so big that

1612
02:26:41,140 --> 02:26:47,060
they probably wouldn't even need to get a micro-ITX board. The micro-ITX ones that they

1613
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:53,900
have now are really small. They're only, I think the specifications for that are 15,

1614
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:57,660
I want to say, I think it's 17 centimeters by 17 centimeters.

1615
02:26:57,660 --> 02:27:03,140
And looking at that, it looks like that is a micro ITX board in there.

1616
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:09,380
Yeah, so it's a micro ITX board, looks like a hard drive, power supply and everything.

1617
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:15,820
Looks like they've got the, it looks like they had a P4 version that was in there.

1618
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:17,880
I don't really know if that's the thing.

1619
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:21,960
They might have just added a fan to that just so it's cooled off a little bit more.

1620
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:25,820
I don't know. It's hard to tell by the picture. It looks like it could be a regular-sized

1621
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:30,080
motherboard, but I'm thinking it's probably a micro-ITX.

1622
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:33,100
I like how they have the hard drive on top. That's very interesting. The hard drive's

1623
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:35,900
like separate from everything else. It's kind of interesting. I don't know if that's just

1624
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:41,920
the way they open it up or what. But look at this. It says it also includes a sound-sensitive

1625
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:49,940
blue LED rod that kind of goes with the beat. But those little things go a long way in ghetto

1626
02:27:49,940 --> 02:27:56,420
fabulousness don't they don't you think it's awesome I still wanted to do I

1627
02:27:56,420 --> 02:28:01,220
wanted to make like a mini portable console system for like you know step

1628
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:06,580
mania emulation games and just like a not really like almost like a laptop but

1629
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:12,740
not huh I'm never gonna do that though because I start too many projects all

1630
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:15,620
right well we're gonna go to a break when we come back from this break we got

1631
02:28:15,620 --> 02:28:18,580
to do the F use of the week don't you know oh but shouldn't I announce the

1632
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:21,780
winner of the orange launch radio cage match before we get to that because that was about

1633
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:26,780
an hour ago that we had the cage match. Tonight's winner of the orange launch radio cage match

1634
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:36,500
is Ian Vandal with Reason. So there you have it. Just because Loki picks a funny one doesn't

1635
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:45,660
mean he wins it. So too bad. I'm glad I haven't won that in at least a while. So at least

1636
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:51,300
a month I know that much so cool well we'll be hearing that one again next

1637
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:56,740
week along with two other lovely new songs oh no not next week oh yeah by

1638
02:28:56,740 --> 02:29:00,860
default it's gonna win for two weeks now so we'll be back in two weeks to try and

1639
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:04,900
to throw in Ian Vandal in the meantime we're gonna take a break for right now

1640
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:07,580
when we come back we're gonna do the F use of the week in this break well I

1641
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:11,420
figured we did some DDR some 2dx how about some popin music specifically I

1642
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:17,900
I dug through my Papa Music 9 folder for some songs, and we're gonna kick it off with Ryu

1643
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:24,980
and Noria with Shining. Enjoy. Huh? I thought there was an extra letter in there. My bad.

1644
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:27,980
Ryu, I'm white. Forgive me. We'll be back.

1645
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:56,980
That's not easy

1646
02:30:58,980 --> 02:31:00,980
That's not easy

1647
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:02,980
That's not easy

1648
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:36,980
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

1655
02:32:50,980 --> 02:32:58,940
Even if you don't believe in me, you're gonna find me in no other place

1656
02:32:58,940 --> 02:33:02,940
I don't know why,

1657
02:33:58,940 --> 02:34:00,940
I

1658
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:40,220
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1659
02:35:40,220 --> 02:35:44,140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1660
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:50,900
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1661
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:56,000
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and believe it or not we're coming into the home

1662
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:03,000
stretch of the show, but no show would be complete without a little bit of angst.

1663
02:36:04,340 --> 02:36:09,000
And that means it's time for the FUs of the week. Jamie, why do we have to do these FUs

1664
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
of the week every single week?

1665
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:18,000
because we're full of angst.

1666
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:31,680
First F.U. goes to my laundry

1667
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:37,320
for not being dry yet until damp.

1668
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:40,560
Another F.U. goes toward being exhausted, drained,

1669
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:50,280
worn out, you name it. F.U. to stress. Big F.U. to stress. F.U. to people in minivans

1670
02:36:50,280 --> 02:37:04,560
who drive 30 in a 50 mile an hour zone. And just stupidity. And uh, distance, time, money.

1671
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:11,560
I don't really have anything specific.

1672
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:18,560
Alright, then we'll move on to Loki.

1673
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:20,560
Um...

1674
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:26,680
First off, you know, it's, like, every week, you know, fucking the drivers, cause,

1675
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:37,680
God, they're so awful and fulsome. I just don't know what it is. They just don't pay attention to any of the stop signs, lights, road signs, nothing. They just... stupid.

1676
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:45,680
So, fuck you then. Um, fuck you to my car, because the engine light came on the other day, and I don't know why.

1677
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:54,680
Well, actually, I do know why, because it was out of coolant, but I fixed that, and I hope it doesn't break down, because, you know, I need good karma around my car.

1678
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:59,180
I don't want to have to, like, have it break. That would suck.

1679
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:07,180
Um, then on more personal notes, and, you know, I apologize to any of the people that are listening for my work,

1680
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:10,680
because I think there might be one or two. Maybe one.

1681
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:17,680
Anyways, um, what do you do, um, BPD for firing, uh, Nelly from The Mill Room?

1682
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:23,680
It's really funny because I do know the reasons behind it, and it was really stupid why they did it.

1683
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:28,720
and there's a lot of people there that have done a lot worse and are still there and it's just

1684
02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:33,920
retarded so but whatever she's probably gonna end up getting something better in the long run so

1685
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:38,320
that's cool but there's just a lot of people i have lots of respect for from that and that sucks

1686
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:47,760
then finally uh just uh i'm sorry fuck you to the rain because uh

1687
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:51,360
wet outside and i can't work on my cabinet not that i would work on my cabinet anyways if it

1688
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:58,360
it wasn't raining. I'm just tired, that's it.

1689
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:04,920
Alright, I'm going back to my old F.U. song, because the new one,

1690
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:09,920
William Hung, just wasn't working out, so I'm going back to my old song.

1691
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:16,060
Why aren't we just talking about how we didn't really care for this song, Jamie?

1692
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:19,560
Why don't you pick another one?

1693
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:23,420
I'm feeling uncreative tonight because I just like the fact that it goes all things keep

1694
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:31,040
getting better and you know it's the FUs of the week.

1695
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:36,320
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, no maybe later.

1696
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:38,600
I know you need to have the Veruca Salt song.

1697
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:39,600
Ooh I like Veruca Salt.

1698
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:41,600
I won't do that.

1699
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:44,640
Maybe I'll have to do that, that would be cute.

1700
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:49,320
I'm never that angsty though and honestly to be honest this week is much different.

1701
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:53,520
I'm just, I'm gonna say F you to the fact that I've been really insanely busy this week

1702
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:56,720
and I haven't had time to do all the things that I want to do and F you to the fact that

1703
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:59,720
I haven't been able to hang out with certain people as much as I would like to be able

1704
02:39:59,720 --> 02:40:04,360
to because of the fact that, you know, they're working and I'm working and I got the radio

1705
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:07,600
stuff and et cetera, et cetera, so that kind of sucks.

1706
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:11,680
There needs to be more hours in the day and then people shouldn't have to work as much

1707
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:13,320
and then keep the same salary.

1708
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:18,480
I realize I'm living in La La Land but I really don't have anything realistic this week.

1709
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:22,960
actually been a pretty decent week it's really busy except F you to the people

1710
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:26,760
that went saw the grudge at 930 on Friday night in Roseville because you

1711
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:31,080
all were too damn loud and F you to that guy I had to yell at in the middle of the

1712
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:36,000
movie although that did make me feel really good I think getting the applause

1713
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,440
like that when I told that guy to shut the hell up felt really really good

1714
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:45,720
there's just not a lot of rushes like that you get in the world so if you do

1715
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:51,320
that movie as well for making people scream. People were too damn loud with that movie

1716
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:54,720
and it was giving me a headache. Oh, F you to the fact, I know why, F you to the fact

1717
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:59,040
that the projectionist or something, the film was damaged or the projection was going on

1718
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:05,120
because for 20 goddamn minutes the movie was bouncing up and down like it was shaking.

1719
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:08,120
Like imagine if you were trying to watch something on a projection screen and it was shaking

1720
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:11,640
like an earthquake. I swear to God it was giving me a headache after like one minute

1721
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:15,720
having to watch it like that. And we go and complain. Loki actually went in and complained

1722
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:20,720
and what do they tell you? Uh, yeah, it's only gonna do that for 20 minutes. Uh, we

1723
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:27,040
got the defective reel from the studio, but hey, we're getting a new one that replaces

1724
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:34,040
soon. Sorry. Uh-uh. No. Fuck you and your fucking bitch-ass whore-cunt for fucking making

1725
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:41,480
me pay 9.25 plus a $1.25 Fandango fee, because I don't like fucking lines at your movie theater.

1726
02:41:41,480 --> 02:41:47,160
theater. Fuck you for making me pay that. I want a perfect god damn theater experience.

1727
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:51,920
You know what? You should ask for the manager. I know. I should write a letter and complain.

1728
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:57,600
Do it. I just might. You should ask for the manager's boss then. They all asked for just

1729
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:06,600
I didn't. I did. Who knew? I had this rage pent up in me and I forgot all about it. I

1730
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:11,440
pushed it to the back of my mind and you people brought it out of me. RAGE! I got a free ticket.

1731
02:42:11,440 --> 02:42:18,080
it for complaining about them turning on the light at the end of the credits for the Matrix.

1732
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:22,440
I'll write a nasty letter. Because you know what, I can't, I think I had one other bad

1733
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,560
experience at theater and I can't remember what it was, but I bet if I went through the

1734
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:30,880
F.U. archives of the show I could find it. Mention the three magic words. Better Business

1735
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:37,800
Bureau. Or I'll mention these magic words. Fuck you whore for making me pay so much money

1736
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:40,920
for going to see a sub-par production.

1737
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:43,160
I want everything in pristine condition.

1738
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:45,240
You're gonna, it's highway robbery.

1739
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:47,400
No wonder people pirate your goddamn movies.

1740
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:50,280
Here's my thing, okay, it was playing

1741
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:53,000
on like six to eight screens in there.

1742
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,280
Take out the bad film, play it less.

1743
02:42:56,280 --> 02:43:00,360
Oh my God, five screens, how will we survive?

1744
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:02,880
I mean, seriously, just play it less.

1745
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,240
Play another, I'm sure more people

1746
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:08,240
I wanted to see a shark's tail, so go ahead and play that instead.

1747
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:12,240
I mean, they could have easily taken this out of rotation, but instead they were like,

1748
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:14,240
Ah, fuck it, no one's gonna care.

1749
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:20,240
Alright.

1750
02:43:21,240 --> 02:43:25,240
Let's move on and go to the other angsty folks in our studio right now.

1751
02:43:25,240 --> 02:43:27,240
We'll start it off with DDR Angel.

1752
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:30,240
Nice attempt to burp, Ryan.

1753
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:32,240
Haha, it's okay.

1754
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:37,420
Um, just a few just being tired today. I don't even know what's up. Everybody seems tired today

1755
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:42,720
I don't know just there's no reason for it. I shouldn't be tired, but I am

1756
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:47,560
Again if you did the flaky instructor that I've got

1757
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:52,600
But whatever he's still deciding the whole class every once in a while

1758
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:56,400
Maybe he'll get over it and realize. Oh wait. I haven't job

1759
02:43:56,400 --> 02:44:02,400
Um, that's about it. I'm, like, not angsty. What the hell?

1760
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:09,400
You're not really ever that angsty, Angel. I've only seen you angsty here one time, and it took an act of God to make you angsty?

1761
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:14,400
Alright. Bradley, Arcadian42, what's on your mind?

1762
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:18,400
Of course, fuck you to, uh, FolsomPD and...

1763
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:19,400
Surprise!

1764
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:26,400
Yes, fuck you to all that and all, fuck you to me for getting myself into that, in that

1765
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:32,680
situation and all the decisions and delays and everything that caused it and yeah, so

1766
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:39,680
forth. Uh, what else? Uh, fuck you to having to make up all that time, but at least my

1767
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:44,680
but at least my work is nice and they'll let me make up time

1768
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:49,680
fuck you to the honey back ribs or whatever

1769
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:54,680
the new thing at Applebee's for sucking

1770
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:59,680
not honey, it's like honey barbecue ribs

1771
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:04,680
actually it was a rib thing but it sucked

1772
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:08,680
It was a new rib thing, but it sucked.

1773
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:12,680
It was like, bleh.

1774
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:17,680
But at least it was free, because it was the free lunch day at work.

1775
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:22,680
So at least I didn't have to pay that money for it.

1776
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:26,680
And, uh, yeah.

1777
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:31,680
Actually, just R.O.D. for the TV.

1778
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:38,160
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, of which I haven't gotten very many tonight,

1779
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:41,920
surprisingly enough, so if they don't get in in the next 30 seconds or so, they're probably

1780
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:45,640
not getting read, but that's alright, we have a few.

1781
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:52,780
Ry Chan says, F you to friends borrowing things and not returning them. F you to people that

1782
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:57,880
drive in the fast lane and are going 15 miles an hour under the speed limit. F you to loners.

1783
02:45:57,880 --> 02:46:02,880
F you to people that continue to try to use you for all your worth and can't take a hint when I say no.

1784
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:06,880
Oh, and F you to taking a frisbee to the lip.

1785
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:08,880
Ow. Ow.

1786
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:11,880
What, Loki?

1787
02:46:11,880 --> 02:46:14,880
If you're not a dog, you can't catch it with your mouth.

1788
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:17,880
I don't think, something tells me she wasn't trying to do that.

1789
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:19,880
You know what, though? You know what's a lot safer?

1790
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:22,880
What were those things that are like, frisbees? Did they go for the, uh, robies?

1791
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:23,880
What were those things called?

1792
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:26,880
Yeah, it's like throwing a giant saw blade at your head.

1793
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:28,880
That's the best thing ever.

1794
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,880
The Nerf ones, the plastic ones.

1795
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:35,880
Yeah, the Nerf ones are the best ones because it just feels like you're throwing like a fish at you or something like that.

1796
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:39,880
But yeah, the Robies are fucking dangerous because they go faster and they're like more streamlined.

1797
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:43,880
Like seriously, it's like a saw blade getting thrown at you.

1798
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:46,880
But they're awesome, you can throw them on the park.

1799
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:48,880
Alright.

1800
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:53,880
Didn't they have a Robies that were shaped in like strange shapes too, like diamonds and stuff?

1801
02:46:53,880 --> 02:47:09,880
I only heard half of tonight's show. Unacceptable. Fired. That's fine. He does good news for

1802
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:17,500
the website. Jazz says F you to the fact that the projection people didn't turn off the

1803
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:21,640
lights for like 15 minutes into the movie and the fact that the grudge was more funny

1804
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:29,320
even scary and the rest of my audience agreed. I thought the grudge was scary, I don't know

1805
02:47:29,320 --> 02:47:34,880
if the grudge was really scary. But that's it, he reminded me of the other thing. When

1806
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:39,800
I went and saw, I think it was, I want to say it was Kill Bill 2 over there, they didn't

1807
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:44,000
turn off the goddamn lights. That's what it was, it was Kill Bill 2. Yeah, when I went

1808
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:47,560
and saw Kill Bill 2, they didn't turn off the goddamn lights for like 15 minutes. And

1809
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:51,280
you would think such a little thing would not be so annoying, but it was really, really

1810
02:47:51,280 --> 02:48:00,560
annoying. Thank you Jazz for reigniting that angst within me. Lastly, Poto says F you to

1811
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:08,640
writing a paper on two hours of sleep. Aww. Aww. I remember being such a procrastinator

1812
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:11,640
like that, still am. I remember staying up all night. I'm doing my paper during my lunch

1813
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:17,960
break tomorrow, and it's due tomorrow night. Amen to that. Alright. I'm not going to class

1814
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:28,400
I guess what we should do, let's open up the skype line because for god's sake we haven't

1815
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:32,680
had it open the whole show except for that long chat we had with frequency, basically

1816
02:48:32,680 --> 02:48:37,280
frequency took all your skype time tonight ladies and gentlemen, no I'm kidding, we'll

1817
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:42,240
open it up a little bit for the folks to talk to us on skype, so skype's open, if you want

1818
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:47,120
more information on skype head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact

1819
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:50,720
with us. We definitely would like your feedback to anything we've talked about during tonight's

1820
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:54,840
show, including lots of stuff that we had talked to Frequency about earlier, as well

1821
02:48:54,840 --> 02:49:00,080
as, you know, other news, the Bomani remix contests, and machines breaking down, and

1822
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:03,480
kids in arcades, and projectionists that don't know how to tromp the goddamn light when the

1823
02:49:03,480 --> 02:49:08,560
movie starts. Anyway, sorry. Getting a little bit off tangent there. Also, we will accept

1824
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:12,920
your Ask Orange Lounge questions over private messages chat if you guys have anything you

1825
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:16,120
want to ask us. We only have a couple minutes left, so we're not going to make an official

1826
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:18,620
segment but if you have some questions you'd like us to address go ahead and

1827
02:49:18,620 --> 02:49:23,040
send those in I'd also like to add that everything Sam Raimi touches turns to

1828
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:29,280
gold and his car ends up in all of his movies damn it I didn't look for it in

1829
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:32,720
the garage but I don't know if that really counts because he just produced

1830
02:49:32,720 --> 02:49:37,680
the movie this car might be in there I I'm being told right now in our chat

1831
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:45,080
room that right now our very show is being played inside a truck stop awesome

1832
02:49:45,080 --> 02:49:50,080
So we'd like to give a big YEE-HAW to all our truckin' buddies down there.

1833
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:53,080
No, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding. Please don't beat me up.

1834
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:58,080
No, but I guess we have somebody listening on a network over at the truck stop right now.

1835
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:01,080
I want to go to the truck stop. They have good food.

1836
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:03,080
I want hash food. They have good food over at the truck stop.

1837
02:50:03,080 --> 02:50:04,080
Oh my God, Bob. Let's go get food.

1838
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:07,080
Do they have riblets? I want riblets. I don't think they have riblets.

1839
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:12,080
But I need to be watching my weight because I have a performance to do on Saturday.

1840
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:14,780
Oh, come on, eat healthy food, get some fitness with it.

1841
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:17,580
I gotta work early tomorrow. If I didn't have to work early tomorrow, I would totally do it.

1842
02:50:17,580 --> 02:50:19,580
I can, I have to work at 6.30.

1843
02:50:19,580 --> 02:50:22,580
What? Sorry.

1844
02:50:22,580 --> 02:50:27,580
Anyway, we're supposed to watch the language, because we're being broadcast to the truck stop right now, so...

1845
02:50:27,580 --> 02:50:28,580
You know.

1846
02:50:28,580 --> 02:50:30,580
Don't give in to me!

1847
02:50:30,580 --> 02:50:34,580
Alright, I'll keep the mic away from Logie, if that's the case.

1848
02:50:34,580 --> 02:50:42,020
Oh, I didn't even check the Skype thing to see if anybody called. Nope! Still wide open

1849
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:44,780
there. Well, I guess nobody wants to call us tonight. That's fine. That's fine. We'll

1850
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:48,540
just talk to ourselves. We'll amuse ourselves here. That's fine. Any big Halloween plans

1851
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:53,300
for you, Loki? Just having a get-together over here. We're gonna watch Shaun of the

1852
02:50:53,300 --> 02:50:58,900
Dead because I got my lovely promo copy of that, and that's gonna rock. Shaun of the

1853
02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:03,820
Dead. I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try because the people are gonna have alcohol. I'm gonna

1854
02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:07,820
I tried to slip in one of my bad movies in there, but I don't think they're gonna go for it.

1855
02:51:07,820 --> 02:51:11,820
No one wants to watch my bad movies, and that makes me sad.

1856
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:15,820
I spend good money on those, and goddamnit, if, you know,

1857
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:19,820
no one wants to watch, uh, was it, uh, Blood Sisters of Lesbian Sin,

1858
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:23,820
you know, who will?

1859
02:51:23,820 --> 02:51:27,820
I'll watch it. Just to see what the hell it is.

1860
02:51:27,820 --> 02:51:31,820
I have a question. How many people are coming to this get-together?

1861
02:51:31,820 --> 02:51:40,660
don't know. Where are they all going to fit? Uh, I don't know. Interesting, very- Sit on

1862
02:51:40,660 --> 02:51:49,620
the floor, goddammit, because I'm taking language! Gosh darn it! Much better, much better. Alright.

1863
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:57,300
Uh, Bradley, you have any exciting Halloween plans? Nope. Sit on my ass at home, do nothing.

1864
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:59,300
Sounds like a plan to me.

1865
02:51:59,300 --> 02:52:01,300
You know what I'm doing?

1866
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:03,300
That's a fabulous idea. Let's take out the airazooka.

1867
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:07,300
You can put candy in it and it launches the candy.

1868
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:11,300
I've got like three days of Halloween because we're doing the big thing at work.

1869
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:13,300
I have my catgirl costume.

1870
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:18,300
And then I'm having Rocky on Saturday.

1871
02:52:18,300 --> 02:52:24,300
And probably Sunday I'm just going to sit around and watch Interview with the Vampire on laserdisc.

1872
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:26,300
There you go.

1873
02:52:26,300 --> 02:52:31,220
Of course, if you're in the Sacramento area, you should definitely check out furtherindignities.org

1874
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:34,140
for the information on a Halloween tradition.

1875
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:38,020
Rocky Orpix show is going to be in UC Davis and several of your buddies from Warren's

1876
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:40,860
Knowledge Radio are involved with that because that was the thing we did before we played

1877
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:42,780
DDR and did this show.

1878
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:44,500
And it's still going on.

1879
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:48,100
So check that out if you're in the area.

1880
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:52,220
Also what else I want to say, oh, remember the follow up from last week.

1881
02:52:52,220 --> 02:52:56,220
Remember we were talking about, in case you guys weren't listening last week, but we were

1882
02:52:56,220 --> 02:53:02,140
We were talking about how we were going to do DDR on the big screen at some point.

1883
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:05,500
We were going to take that same movie screen and possibly have a Bimani night in the movie

1884
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:09,500
theater and possibly do a live taping of Orange Lounge Radio.

1885
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:11,100
Outlook is very good on that.

1886
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:14,740
We're hoping to get some help from other friends of ours within the Bimani community to kind

1887
02:53:14,740 --> 02:53:16,260
of make that a success.

1888
02:53:16,260 --> 02:53:20,960
But just like the TV show thing that had come up earlier, we're having a hard time figuring

1889
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:24,340
out exactly what we're going to do besides a live episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1890
02:53:24,340 --> 02:53:26,340
Let's set the ferret on fire!

1891
02:53:28,340 --> 02:53:30,340
He said, let's set a virgin on fire.

1892
02:53:31,340 --> 02:53:33,340
Let's set a virgin's pants on fire.

1893
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:38,340
Let's set the ferret on fire, that's what we need to do.

1894
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:41,340
My babies! Where's my babies?

1895
02:53:41,340 --> 02:53:43,340
I don't even know where the ferrets are.

1896
02:53:43,340 --> 02:53:44,340
Do you want to be my baby?

1897
02:53:44,340 --> 02:53:46,340
No, I won't have to be your baby, you have to get out and get it.

1898
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:50,340
No, don't do it, don't be your slave.

1899
02:53:50,340 --> 02:53:52,340
Don't be your slave!

1900
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:54,340
Let's let people go!

1901
02:53:57,340 --> 02:54:03,340
Okay, that's one suggestion that's come up, is that Katamari Damacy gets played on the big screen.

1902
02:54:03,340 --> 02:54:04,340
Okay.

1903
02:54:04,340 --> 02:54:07,340
Somehow, we'll have to have some kind of little contest.

1904
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:10,340
Oh, they have two player mode. We could have a Katamari Damacy tournament or something.

1905
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:12,340
He can play as the cousins.

1906
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:15,340
There you go. I'm liking this so far. I'm liking it.

1907
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:18,340
Alright.

1908
02:54:18,340 --> 02:54:22,340
I got choir people that go da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1909
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:26,340
We'll get the UC Davis choir in on it. That'll be fun.

1910
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:30,340
Alright, we're gonna take a real quick break.

1911
02:54:30,340 --> 02:54:34,340
We're gonna do a one-song break, then we're gonna come back and wrap up the show.

1912
02:54:34,340 --> 02:54:38,340
What song should we do here in this break? Let's do...

1913
02:54:38,340 --> 02:54:42,340
Well, we did pop and we didn't do a Guitar Freak song.

1914
02:54:42,340 --> 02:54:45,340
What?

1915
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:49,340
Loki wants to play his remix again. Fine. Fair enough. That makes for a good one song break.

1916
02:54:49,340 --> 02:54:53,340
Tell us one more time about your remix that you didn't enter into any contest because you...

1917
02:54:53,340 --> 02:54:56,340
I don't know. You don't enter contests or something?

1918
02:54:56,340 --> 02:55:00,340
Well, this is just my newest one. It's the preview one off of the next album,

1919
02:55:00,340 --> 02:55:06,340
which I was trying today to upload my new album, and fucking A, it will not work, okay?

1920
02:55:06,340 --> 02:55:09,340
Language! Language!

1921
02:55:09,340 --> 02:55:11,340
Yes, I am speaking English.

1922
02:55:11,340 --> 02:55:26,340
Okay, anyways, um, so, Golly Gee Willikers, it would not, you know, upload to the, to the, um, server, and, um, so yeah, I couldn't make it available for people to download, and that made me sad.

1923
02:55:26,340 --> 02:55:40,340
Um, and you said it sucks, okay, that's what I want to say. But anyways, this is, um, Paranoid Revolution, um, be sure you put in the one that's just Revolution and MP3, because I changed it a few times.

1924
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:50,340
Alright, alright.

1925
02:56:10,340 --> 02:56:17,340
paranoia revolution. Enjoy, and we'll be back to wrap up the show after this.

1926
02:57:40,340 --> 02:57:54,340
Now that I'm prepared to bust back

1927
02:57:54,340 --> 02:58:04,340
Now that I'm prepared to bust back

1928
02:59:04,340 --> 02:59:19,580
Now, it's Paranoia Revolution here on Orange Lounge Radio, remixed by our very own Noki.

1929
02:59:19,580 --> 02:59:20,580
You know what I realized?

1930
02:59:20,580 --> 02:59:27,420
The bass line in that kind of reminds me of Tsugaru, like it has the same rhythm, listen

1931
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:28,420
to it towards the end.

1932
02:59:28,420 --> 02:59:32,300
actually has the part you know in paranoia is where it's all where it's all

1933
02:59:32,300 --> 02:59:38,100
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo has that throughout the whole thing yeah

1934
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:45,220
so it's like a was it a 12th notes and then like some fourth oh it's pretty

1935
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:48,500
cool it's just it's a little bit um tweaked off of that that's in the

1936
02:59:48,500 --> 02:59:52,900
background I know for most of it obviously cuz I made it but um I don't

1937
02:59:52,900 --> 03:00:11,900
Now, that's all that's done on the second thing right now, but they'll all be available to download, along with my nice cover art and whatnot, and you can put together your own CD, like I did in the studio, because, like hell, if I'm gonna make more and, like, you know, send them out to people, I just don't do that.

1938
03:00:11,900 --> 03:00:19,420
Alright, well, we've got to wrap up the show here, so we've got to go around and get everybody's

1939
03:00:19,420 --> 03:00:20,420
final thought.

1940
03:00:20,420 --> 03:00:21,820
We'll start off with DDR Angel.

1941
03:00:21,820 --> 03:00:24,740
DDR Angel, what is your final thought?

1942
03:00:24,740 --> 03:00:35,240
Um, Katamari Damacy, because I can't stop playing.

1943
03:00:35,240 --> 03:00:38,180
Final thought from Bradley.

1944
03:00:38,180 --> 03:00:40,180
You go last, right?

1945
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:55,180
I have none at the moment. They're gone, they're gone, they're gone, they're gone.

1946
03:00:55,180 --> 03:01:01,180
Alright, Loki your final thought. There's gonna be too many games I gotta buy this week.

1947
03:01:01,180 --> 03:01:09,180
I got Neo Contra and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and actually maybe not. I wasn't gonna get Tony Hawk's Underground 2,

1948
03:01:09,180 --> 03:01:13,180
Maybe I might get that, but Need for Speed Underground 2, no.

1949
03:01:13,180 --> 03:01:15,180
DarkSakura, your final thought?

1950
03:01:15,180 --> 03:01:22,180
I have games to play, like I have Katamari Damacy now, I have Sims 2, and you know what?

1951
03:01:22,180 --> 03:01:31,180
Real life is taking up all my time, so I've had to focus on school, everything, so...

1952
03:01:31,180 --> 03:01:37,180
There is a world outside of video games, not much one, and it usually sucks, but there is one.

1953
03:01:37,180 --> 03:01:41,380
Alright, my final thought is, don't forget to listen to our other shows on Monday night,

1954
03:01:41,380 --> 03:01:44,860
Diversion, the Orange Mountains Radio Remix show, Tuesday night, pump up the volume with

1955
03:01:44,860 --> 03:01:49,420
Dark Sakura, 7 o'clock Pacific Time, and, oh I'm sorry, 7 o'clock for pre-show, 7.30

1956
03:01:49,420 --> 03:01:55,640
for show, and Wednesday nights on Orange Mountains Radio, Outside the Box, with a special Grand

1957
03:01:55,640 --> 03:01:57,420
Theft Auto San Andreas update!

1958
03:01:57,420 --> 03:02:00,940
Yes, very special Grand Theft Auto San Andreas update.

1959
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:03,860
That's the show on the station where we talk about the other games, other than the stomp

1960
03:02:03,860 --> 03:02:05,900
your feet and tap your fingers games.

1961
03:02:05,900 --> 03:02:09,860
So we'll get to all that on Wednesday, and Tuesday, Jamie I'm sure will have another

1962
03:02:09,860 --> 03:02:15,760
fun show, and Monday remixes, Thursday Orange Islands Radio Rewind, another night of programming

1963
03:02:15,760 --> 03:02:19,960
is coming to Orange Islands Radio soon, that's all I have to say, and also the Long Versions

1964
03:02:19,960 --> 03:02:27,240
program is gonna launch hopefully sometime this week, but like next week at the latest.

1965
03:02:27,240 --> 03:02:31,880
So we're gonna have a Long Version program that's gonna be at lunchtime for an hour.

1966
03:02:31,880 --> 03:02:34,880
Rob, real quick question here, uh, in the studio.

1967
03:02:34,880 --> 03:02:38,880
Um, what about the, um, see here spot thing?

1968
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:40,880
Eh, okay, never mind.

1969
03:02:40,880 --> 03:02:42,880
Nothing to see here, move along. Oh, and,

1970
03:02:42,880 --> 03:02:47,880
should mention, when you're, um, you know, not listening to Orange Knowledge Radio,

1971
03:02:47,880 --> 03:02:50,880
New South Park coming to Comedy Central.

1972
03:02:50,880 --> 03:02:52,880
Hooray, hooray, okay.

1973
03:02:52,880 --> 03:02:55,880
The last word of this show, I'm gonna give it to Loki.

1974
03:02:55,880 --> 03:02:59,880
Loki, the last word of tonight's show, one word that sums it all up for our listeners.

1975
03:02:59,880 --> 03:03:01,880
I can't do it alone.

1976
03:03:01,880 --> 03:03:02,880
Fuck yeah!

1977
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:08,880
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:13,880

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

1981
03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:31,880
Whenever my life gets me so down, I know I can go down.

1982
03:03:31,880 --> 03:03:34,880
Down, down, down, where the fun never ends.

1983
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:39,880
As long as the music keeps playing, you know what I'm saying.

1984
03:03:39,880 --> 03:03:44,880
I know that I can find a friend.

1985
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:47,880
Shut up the roundhouse.

1986
03:03:47,880 --> 03:03:54,880
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

1987
03:04:17,880 --> 03:04:40,520
I thought that was a gospel song at first, and then I realized what it was. I didn't

1988
03:04:40,520 --> 03:04:43,720
realize they sung the theme around us like that. I thought they actually had a little

1989
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:45,560
synthesized thing.

1990
03:04:45,560 --> 03:04:48,000
No, because the show fucking rocked

1991
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:51,760
and then they took it off air like they do everything that's good on Nickelodeon.

1992
03:04:51,760 --> 03:04:55,620
They need to have Nick retro with the old

1993
03:04:55,620 --> 03:04:59,400
shows like Salute Your Shorts, you know,

1994
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:00,900
fucking

1995
03:05:00,900 --> 03:05:03,040
Hey Dude and all that stuff.

1996
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:06,680
They need to put that back on air because they've got like, you know, the stupid

1997
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:08,400
noggin crap with like

1998
03:05:08,400 --> 03:05:12,000

03:05:17,640 --> 03:05:19,540

03:05:19,540 --> 03:05:20,920

2003
03:05:20,920 --> 03:05:25,640

03:05:25,640 --> 03:05:27,760

2007
03:05:35,720 --> 03:05:38,380
show is fabulous

2008
03:05:38,380 --> 03:05:40,760
at first a reason it makes me think

2009
03:05:40,760 --> 03:05:43,240
yet god yes you can sit on television why

2010
03:05:43,240 --> 03:05:47,120

2011
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:48,220

2012
03:05:48,220 --> 03:05:49,360
pinwheel

2013
03:05:49,360 --> 03:05:51,900
today's special

2014
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:58,380
and we also

2015
03:05:58,380 --> 03:06:02,120
you know this never get that the fact that

2016
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:05,080
I'll come back one.

2017
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:06,840
Exactly.

2018
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:10,280
Thank God for the internet, because I'm hoping more and more old-school you can't do that

2019
03:06:10,280 --> 03:06:14,040
on television episodes start showing up, because I found a couple online once, or somebody

2020
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:15,040
gave me some.

2021
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:16,040
I don't remember what it was.

2022
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:17,040
Did you give me some?

2023
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:18,040
Angel gave me some.

2024
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:19,040
Oh, so great.

2025
03:06:19,040 --> 03:06:20,040
I need to get more.

2026
03:06:20,040 --> 03:06:21,040
That show was so freaking fabulous.

2027
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:23,200
I get my Ouija board back this week.

2028
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:26,240
Dude, the dungeon scenes of you can't do that on television.

2029
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:27,240
That's all I gotta say.

2030
03:06:27,240 --> 03:06:30,560
Or the arcades.

2031
03:06:30,560 --> 03:06:38,460
all about barf that kind of rocks poor guy I think isn't he dead poor guy he

2032
03:06:38,460 --> 03:06:44,000
was awesome so underappreciated and peewee you know fucking peewees play out

2033
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:47,440
seems to come back I don't care if he's a fucking pervert and child molester you

2034
03:06:47,440 --> 03:06:51,220
know what this is this is a conversation I was having my friend the other day

2035
03:06:51,220 --> 03:06:54,400
we're talking about Michael Jackson okay yeah the guy's really fucked up yeah

2036
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:58,400
okay maybe he slept with some children yeah that does not make his music bad

2037
03:06:58,400 --> 03:07:04,400
Just because someone's a child molester does not mean that they cannot make bad, or make good music.

2038
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:09,400
It's just like Pee Wee Herman. Okay, so he's into child pornography and all this stuff.

2039
03:07:09,400 --> 03:07:15,400
Does not mean the show was bad. You, people are confusing the art with the person.

2040
03:07:15,400 --> 03:07:20,400
I don't go around, you know, saying, you know, I don't like that music because that guy's an alcoholic.

2041
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:25,400
You know, I don't like that music because I don't like the sound of it. Not, I don't like the person.

2042
03:07:25,400 --> 03:07:30,400
People need to separate the person from the music. That's what I think.

2043
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:38,400
Some comments from the chat room. Danger Mouse and Count Ducula.

2044
03:07:38,400 --> 03:07:41,400
Yeah, Count Ducula.

2045
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:43,400
Duck Man needs to come back.

2046
03:07:43,400 --> 03:07:45,400
Yeah, Duck Man, definitely.

2047
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:49,400
Alright. Yeah, enough memory lane stuff.

2048
03:07:49,400 --> 03:07:53,400
Coming to DVDs soon, Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Full House.

2049
03:07:53,400 --> 03:07:58,400
For all you sick pedophiles out there like the Olsen twins.

2050
03:07:59,400 --> 03:08:02,400
When do I get my Golden Girls DVDs? When are those out?

2051
03:08:02,400 --> 03:08:03,400
They're already out.

2052
03:08:03,400 --> 03:08:05,400
What? What?

2053
03:08:05,400 --> 03:08:06,400
I need Wonder Woman.

2054
03:08:06,400 --> 03:08:10,400
Bitch, what? What? My Golden Girls DVDs are already out and I don't have them? What?

2055
03:08:10,400 --> 03:08:14,400
I think they come out Tuesday, or I think they're already out. They were coming out in October.

2056
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:52,080
Alright, that's it we're going to pull the plug on the show now and we're going to go

2057
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:54,360
to tonight's post show.

03:08:54,360 --> 03:08:59,360
You guys seem to like the Dance Mania stuff, so we're going to do Dance Mania X7 tonight.

2059
03:08:59,360 --> 03:09:03,480
There's a lot of fun songs on here, including some fourth mix songs, if you can believe

2060
03:09:03,480 --> 03:09:04,480
it or not.

2061
