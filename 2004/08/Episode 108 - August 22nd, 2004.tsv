185	1406	That was quite interesting.
2607	4768	So, now I guess I really am a geek.
5789	6249	Right.
6649	7470	Yeah, anyway.
8411	8891	Uh, next.
9471	10972	Alright, Vandalus, how was your week, how was your day?
11653	12934	My week and day were fine.
13794	16256	Well, I went to work and I did family stuff.
17297	19178	So, pretty standard stuff for me.
19958	20279	Alright.
20799	23401	Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day?
24561	25122	How was my day?
25482	26343	How was your week, how was your day?
26663	28264	Oh, um, blah.
29785	30366	Just blah?
31066	31407	Alright.
32027	33008	Is that all you want to share?
33128	33308	Yeah.
33628	34049	Okay then.
34829	35730	Sigurd, how was your week?
35750	36170	How was your day?
36631	37852	My week was boring.
38913	45298	But today was funny because I went to go get an iPod and I had the worst customer service in the history of customer service.
45778	53104	When I went to pay for it, the lady at the checkout was basically demanding that I get the service plan because she was saying it was a piece of crap.
53685	57227	And I swear, if she would have had a knife, she would have held it to my throat until I got it.
57888	59069	Then we went to Radio Shack
59831	68174	and I asked if they had any accessories like a holder or something and they started saying it was a piece of crap thing and Apple's only good for one item.
68654	69835	So I hope they all die.
71515	71895	The end.
72096	72616	Very nice.
73076	73356	Alright.
77461	82743	All right, then there was my week and my day, and my week was pretty uninteresting.
83163	85143	The Classic Gaming Expo, I guess, was my highlight.
85163	88625	You know, I've just been hanging out with people throughout the week, that's all.
89245	90025	Nothing too exciting.
91005	93666	All right, I guess at this time we're going to go ahead and go to a break.
95287	95827	Breaks are good.
96027	96707	Yeah, breaks are good.
97167	101369	So we're going to go to a break, and then we'll come back and we'll talk to Sigurd a little more about Ultramix stuff.
102689	103069	Sound good?
103429	103849	Sounds good.
103989	105670	All right, we'll be back after this.
188641	192524	So, Sigurd, I heard you brought a sound clip with you tonight that you wanted us all to hear.
193484	193784	Yes.
194145	194865	Oh, okay.
194885	195606	So you should play it.
195966	197307	I will play that for everybody.
197647	198428	Is it a hint?
199488	200549	I think it might be.
202630	204211	Mama don't like tattletales.
204231	206633	That was interesting.
206773	207253	Good luck.
207614	207934	Alright.
316147	317729	Mama don't like tattletales.
344577	345558	Why isn't the movie on?
345638	346398	You are the star!
346518	348980	Why isn't the movie on?
349040	349460	You are the star!
376758	377419	Thanks for watching!
414737	415997	Orange Lounge Radio.
416317	418478	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
424893	425474	All right, guys.
425514	429759	During the break, you received the first of the clues tonight, and this is the way it's going to work.
429860	438891	When we open it up, and only when we say you can guess the song, send me a private message in the chat room when we say to, and you'll have an opportunity to guess the song.
439051	440994	If you are the first person to get it right...
441874	453299	If you are one of our Skype users, meaning if you go to our website www.orangesongeradio.com and click on interact with us, if you're right, you can be the one to announce it to everybody on the air what the song is.
453719	458261	If you don't have Skype though, you can just tell in the chat room and then we'll relay the message for you.
458521	468365	But again, only at certain times will you be able to submit a guess to me in the chat room and there'll be more clues to come if that one didn't quite do it for you.
468825	470386	Mama don't like tattletales.
470826	474333	Alright, anyway, so... Yeah, that just didn't do it for me at all.
475034	477238	It probably didn't do it for a lot of people, but it's not supposed to be easy.
477719	478019	Alright.
479422	480664	So, Seeker, thank you for bringing the clip.
480684	481345	I appreciate that.
487150	487590	You're welcome.
488651	492373	I'm avoiding various cups, just trying to get the microphone over here.
492393	494695	That's alright, there's just a lot of people here denying a lot of stuff here.
494775	495275	And porn.
497056	500839	So, anything exciting going on at Konami you want to share with the rest of us?
501059	502140	I'll just jump right into it.
502200	507483	There's always exciting stuff going on at Konami, whether I can share it or not.
508484	511666	Actually, there's an interesting thing I can talk about.
512493	516094	Everybody who knows about the game Rumble Roses.
517394	520075	It's actually a pretty good game, just so you know.
520115	522175	It's not all boobs.
522215	525716	It is all boobs, but it's actually fun to play.
528676	533738	The interesting thing about it is that it has the Imani artists doing the music.
535238	540499	You have Akira Yamaoka, which you can stop right there because that makes it worth a purchase already.
541489	554611	Um, it's got, uh, U1, it's got Desro, it has Taka, it has, um, the person that does JetWorld, I don't remember the name off the top of my head, what?
557372	560792	I'm sorry, I just, uh, killed one of the cups all over Angel.
561312	561753	How you doing?
563433	567734	Is that, is that water, or is that... Oh yeah, Loki says watch the cups, thanks!
569594	569854	So...
571345	583696	Yes, what I was going to say was, yeah, and it's got an awesome cover of Yankee Rose, the song that, who is it, David Lee Roth did, that they used in that old E3 trailer or whatever.
584356	584917	That's pretty cool.
586038	587679	Yeah, that actually is a really good song.
588860	591663	But yeah, that's the really cool thing about Rumble Roses.
592563	597187	Don't know why they're in there, but thank goodness they are, because that means I'm going to buy it now.
598849	599149	All right.
602785	607388	Oh, okay, yeah, the songs, for the most part, there is one repeated song.
607868	611930	You can actually hear it on videos that play in GameStop and EB Games.
611991	613071	You'll hear Look to the Sky.
613511	614072	That's in it.
615673	619135	Also, I think that's the only repeated song.
619155	620235	The rest of them are brand new.
620816	621356	Very cool.
621396	622717	They are very, very good.
622757	625178	Like, me personally, I don't like DJ Taka.
626319	627760	Yeah, um...
628661	630522	I don't like his music.
632043	633824	But this song is so good.
635485	637966	So yeah, look forward to that.
640508	645231	Alright, so definitely Bomani fans are going to have to suffer through this TNA game.
645331	647072	Don't suffer, it's actually fun.
647092	649173	That's coming from me.
649213	649933	I'll take your word for it.
650374	653535	Rob, just because you're gay doesn't mean that everybody else is going to suffer.
653816	654496	Alright, shut up.
654516	655537	You might be the only one.
655817	656277	I'll be quiet.
658638	660802	All right, so how's Ultramix 2 looking?
661102	664147	Is it starting to get a little bit finalized there or ready to roll?
664167	665629	Ultramix 2 is looking awesome.
665730	667132	Very nice.
667152	668113	It's very, very cool.
670818	672721	This was said earlier in the chat room, I think.
674065	689119	You know, we give hints out on DDR Freak, and one of our hints to my absolute favorite song on that game, Skulk, Cutress picked it up and linked everybody to an MP3 that was not quite correct.
689179	691341	It was like a remix of the song.
691841	697926	We actually have the original version of the song in the game, so all you trance fans and all that...
698908	700109	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
719799	721260	Oh, tell us about the cookie thing.
721320	722341	I want to talk about the cookie thing.
722361	723001	We'll do that now.
724202	729384	So, we have a member on the DDR Freak Board that goes by the name El Mollet.
729805	730565	Hi, El Mollet.
732526	735288	Yeah, I know it's a great name, isn't it?
735668	736468	It's a wonderful name.
736889	741631	And, you know, we're giving our clues out, and I think the clue that we gave was for, like, Night in Motion.
742071	744773	You know, everybody comments on the...
747190	752414	When we announced the song, he was like, oh, yay, or wow, that's crap, or I'm too indecisive.
753134	764142	And El Mollet said something I don't remember, but then his reply was like, yeah, now you guys just need to announce Moonlight Shadow and I'll be happy, or something like that.
764742	772548	And so, since I know the track listing, and I'm part of the people that are giving out hints, I was like, okay, the next hint I'm going to give out is Moonlight Shadow.
773191	773651	So I did.
774432	776913	And he like promised cookies if it was in the game.
777153	785137	So, you know, we went and said Moonlight Shadow's in the game and I PM'd him the Konami's address.
785957	787538	And so he sent cookies.
789719	792480	Somebody actually followed through on that and he actually sent cookies.
792720	793380	What kind of cookies?
794661	795942	Chewy chocolate chips ahoy.
796282	796822	Oh, yummy.
799705	802807	It was so unexpected.
803188	807031	Me and Floatwalk were just kidding around about it.
807531	809593	The fact that he went through and did that was so awesome.
809733	812515	He also wrote a really nice letter.
812555	813436	Oh, I want to read the letter.
814076	817519	It's going to be read on the radio.
818179	821342	Actually, I can't read the whole thing because it's like two pages.
821522	822183	It's a long letter.
822763	823444	It's a love letter.
823464	824725	It says, Sigurd, I love you.
824765	825705	I want to have your baby.
825825	826306	Oh, I'm sorry.
826946	827727	That was a different letter.
828208	829649	How was the letter LankyStyle was writing?
829689	830010	I'm sorry.
830390	834613	The part that scared me was the part where, like, on the second page there's blood splattered on it.
834674	836315	I was kind of like, uh, whoa.
837576	848205	I need to, um, Terai-chan, uh, not homemade, we requested chewy chocolate chips ahoy because we had gone through our entire bag the first day we got it from the store, so we wanted more.
848858	854902	And to point out, by the way, if you want to interact with our chat room, head on over to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
855182	858284	And that's how you can also participate in tonight's clue guessing game.
858805	861046	And you'll have your first opportunity to submit a guess.
861447	866810	Maybe you're doing a little research on that last sound clip, or maybe there's really nothing to research at all, and we're just really fucking with you.
866990	867631	I don't know.
868131	869192	We will soon find out.
869992	872134	But if you have a guess, you'll have your first chance to submit it in a little bit.
872154	873394	But first, I want to talk about the letter.
874375	874937	Let's do the letter.
874997	875840	Okay, let's do the letter.
875860	877886	I have to find some letter-reading music, though.
877926	880935	Play Moonlight Shadow, because it's symbolic or something.
883823	886666	to all those involved with DDR Ultramix 2.
888227	890069	As promised, here are the cookies.
890890	895295	I'm a man of my word, and I never expected such a marvelous development to happen.
895835	899699	I mean, Moonlight Shadow is my favorite license of all time.
900139	902682	And somehow, you guys managed to obtain it.
903182	905425	I'm impressed, and I am very thankful.
907054	908697	I need to thank you, all of you.
909117	915687	With your input and your new ideas, you will be adding an incredible breath of fresh air to a slowly stagnating series.
920930	924813	Without the Xbox side of DDR, I'm not sure if I would be playing the game still.
925214	932519	Sure, the non-stop Anony modes from the arcade and PS2 mixes are fun, but over the past couple of years, these modes have slowly been growing old on their own.
933020	938144	With the new innovations the new American DDR games are receiving, the series would have become stale by now.
938784	942645	Sure, you can add song after song after song on a mix, but there is more to a mix than that.
943986	946027	And so, I offer you these cookies.
946587	951969	Not only for adding my favorite Japanese DDR song onto a US mix, but as a token of my appreciation.
952709	960311	From the game descriptions thus far, you have gone above and beyond the call of duty for creating a new DDR game, and not simply a rehashed version of a Japanese game.
960812	964013	I never thought I would become this excited over an Xbox DDR title.
965133	968994	Thank you for going in a different direction and not sticking with the traditional formula.
970075	974776	Is this one of those stories where, like, at the end, like, the paraplegic kid starts to walk or something?
974916	975436	I think so.
975456	976457	Here's the last paragraph.
976677	979517	You've earned my money, you've earned my respect, and you've earned these cookies.
979978	983039	Take care in your future endeavors, and I wish all goes well for the release of the current mix.
983339	986400	A fan, a player, and a grateful person, El Mollet.
987160	988500	Now, see, wasn't that awesome?
988940	993182	I'm very sad to say that the song got cut at the last minute, so there's no more Moonlight Shadow.
996363	998564	That's great.
998644	1001146	We got cookies, so we can really cut that song now.
1001166	1002347	We'll cut like three others.
1003607	1005008	You shouldn't have said just kidding.
1005068	1007790	Because then you would have got another letter without cookies.
1008010	1009290	Or cookies with laxative in them.
1009791	1012712	Yeah, did you notice y'all had to go to the bathroom after that?
1012813	1016715	One of our team members did not want to eat the cookies because he thought they were poisonous.
1016895	1019116	And we're like, so you'll die by cookie.
1019216	1020877	That's like a bad thing or something.
1022038	1022278	But...
1022819	1035926	Yeah, I mean, it just goes to show you that if you're nice, cough, Extreme US, bored, cough, cough, this is directed at you, you might get some good stuff in return.
1036026	1037667	So, I was going to ask you about this.
1038087	1039968	I was going to corny and just ask you about this while I have you here.
1039988	1042270	Why the hell aren't you posting anything in the Extreme US thread?
1042350	1043370	Give us a clear answer.
1043410	1044791	Have you read the US Extreme thread?
1044811	1045191	Yes, I have.
1046012	1047012	I just want to hear it from you.
1047172	1049754	I know why I wouldn't be posting there, but I want to hear it from you.
1050854	1052115	The Extreme US thread...
1052924	1061568	is very, to put it in a nice way, is very annoying and stupid.
1062569	1066191	But, and Elle Mullet's signature sums it up the best.
1066531	1068472	This is what goes on the thread there.
1069152	1072074	Dang it, we want our American mixes to be more Japanese.
1073114	1074055	And it's just like,
1075167	1077108	If you want the Japanese games, get the Japanese ones.
1077148	1081231	If you want the American games, to be Japanese... But I can't afford it!
1081291	1082632	It's too expensive!
1082652	1083992	Well, then go play it in the arcade.
1084032	1086054	If you want it at home, do something else.
1086214	1090536	But quit whining that your mix is not exactly like the Japanese one.
1090576	1091457	It never will be.
1092798	1093218	And so...
1094218	1096619	Yeah, we have some people we don't like on there.
1097059	1099981	Well, don't hold back now.
1100041	1102282	They think they know what they're talking about.
1102722	1106164	Why so-and-so isn't in this version and why this looks like this.
1106664	1107645	They don't know anything.
1108205	1112627	So we get a good laugh out of the extreme thread, but that's about it.
1113349	1114950	That's all that thread's good for now.
1115270	1117650	Well, plus, you have the song list for Xtreme, right?
1117670	1119011	Yeah, I've played Xtreme.
1119371	1120531	I know all the unlocks.
1120571	1121452	I know all the courses.
1121472	1123112	And the unlocks are going to stay unlocks, right?
1123272	1124412	The unlocks are staying unlocks.
1124473	1125213	Xtreme is done.
1125533	1125873	Okay.
1125893	1126313	Pretty much.
1126453	1127974	I mean, it comes out the end of September.
1128354	1129234	You guys can wait.
1129574	1130234	Yeah, I know.
1130294	1134816	It's like, poor Ultramix people, they don't even know their initial song list yet.
1135136	1136896	And that only comes out a couple months after.
1138497	1142238	So, we're paying attention to them because, you know, they have...
1142845	1146575	I'm guessing around 20 songs announced so far, probably even less than that.
1147117	1148340	And you guys have a whole 45, I think?
1149966	1151167	So this is just catching up.
1151307	1152908	Tonight we'll have 21.
1152988	1154029	Hopefully somebody will get it.
1154069	1154730	Tonight's 21.
1155950	1157011	In fact, you know what, guys?
1157311	1158192	Here's your first chance.
1158673	1161274	For the next three minutes, you can send me a private message.
1161314	1165037	If you have a guess on what the song is, and if you get it right, you get to tell everybody.
1165117	1165818	So here it is.
1165878	1168180	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your guess.
1168540	1172683	If you guys honestly get it off that one clue, I might have to send you cookies.
1176446	1179508	And when you say cookies, it's a metaphor for something else, right?
1186212	1190419	Vandalist is our official timekeeper, by the way, and he'll let you guys know in the chatroom when your time is up.
1190880	1191962	So, all right.
1195276	1200418	Okay, so Ultramix 2 and Extreme.
1200438	1202519	Do we have a firm release date for either one yet?
1202579	1203840	I don't know what you can and can't say.
1203860	1205120	No, we don't have a firm release date.
1205580	1206901	We just know September-ish.
1207421	1208922	Extreme might have one.
1209102	1212063	Off the top of my head, I'm not sure what was said in the press release.
1212403	1214224	You have to go by what's said in the press release.
1214384	1216085	I might have a more specific date.
1216165	1216805	I might not.
1217966	1220927	Just look forward to it towards the end of the month.
1222439	1224280	Extreme, or not Extreme, Ultramix.
1224821	1227764	We're shooting for November sometime.
1229005	1231807	So, you know, when you pick up Halo 2, pick up Ultramix 2.
1232568	1234710	Just get the games that have number 2 in them.
1234730	1235490	Just remember that.
1236171	1238953	But more specifically, the one with Ultramix in the title as well.
1240375	1241396	It's a really great game.
1243417	1245039	That's all I really can say about it, I guess.
1245582	1246323	Alright, sounds good.
1248124	1252407	Um... Well, actually, I'm trying to get the Echo Image song, Skulk.
1252747	1253048	Okay.
1253108	1254989	Tell us a little bit about, like, this song.
1255049	1261374	Like, where... I don't know if you can talk about where it comes from or anything, but... I don't know what you can say or what you can't say, but... Let me... Okay.
1262495	1268199	Um... Echo Image, the song Skulk, is US exclusive, obviously, not a Konami original.
1269119	1272482	Um... It's... I won't say...
1274469	1275270	Let me think here.
1275490	1277192	You don't have to say anything more if you don't want to.
1277212	1284198	When you play the game, there will be a few songs that you'll notice the background images have URLs in them.
1284758	1285539	This will be one of them.
1286260	1290743	So... Yeah.
1290824	1297549	Just know that it's a really good song, and it's probably my favorite, but as everybody can tell you, I have really bad taste in music.
1297830	1298150	Oh, no.
1298670	1299451	No, seriously.
1299471	1299551	Like...
1302202	1302843	Oh, shut up!
1302923	1309210	Kiriyama Oak is the best thing that's ever happened to the... I know, but... I was being joking, too.
1313014	1313795	I'm confused now.
1313835	1314075	Great.
1315836	1319438	Yeah, so Echo Image, Skulk, awesome.
1319678	1327523	You guys have been led astray by Cutris because the song you guys have been downloading from Amazon, it doesn't sound anything like the actual song, really.
1327903	1328864	But we are going to play the actual song.
1328884	1330605	Yeah, we're going to have the actual song up here.
1330965	1334087	And actually what I'm going to do, I'm going to leave the microphones on.
1334847	1335908	Now, it's cool you can do this, right?
1335928	1338209	You're going to tell us kind of what portions of the song.
1338349	1338610	Yeah.
1338670	1341211	So this is the first time we've really done anything like this.
1341231	1343853	You're going to tell us kind of what portions of the song are actually in the game.
1344273	1344774	All right.
1344934	1345394	All right.
1363648	1367110	I'm kind of stretching time here because I'm waiting for the three minutes to run out here.
1367190	1368191	Vandalus is keeping time.
1369111	1370072	Let me check the guesses.
1370112	1371513	We've gotten three guesses so far.
1373014	1373934	Nope, that's not it.
1373974	1374694	WhiteRob.
1376235	1377116	That's not it.
1377276	1378657	MJS.
1378697	1379877	And only one guess.
1379917	1380998	Did you already close the windows?
1381458	1383559	You should read what they put so I can laugh.
1385772	1387774	I forgot the one that WhiteRob guessed, sorry.
1388595	1392319	MJSI24, I only take the first guess, you only get one guess a turn.
1392639	1394060	He says, the themed Dick Tracy.
1394661	1394961	What?
1395301	1396142	I have no idea where that comes from.
1396543	1400807	Nigma says, my guess is one something from Elvis or Two Memories.
1401565	1421692	Um, for one thing, that's not specific, so no, and for second thing, oh, okay, I thought number one, I think you meant something from Elvis, but that's not a song name, so I have to throw that guess out, so, you gotta give me song name and title, and we prefer on the board reasoning as well, you can't be like, cause you might be able to get a
1422213	1424554	And lastly, last pick here, Jazz is saying Silent Hill, STFU Mix.
1424574	1425695	Nice guess, but no.
1425715	1429136	Cutress is in our chat room and he's saying he's being schooled by you.
1443474	1445456	Oh, there's nothing but love between us cutters.
1445476	1453583	You know, I liked... Honestly, I think the mix that we're going to play here that Sigurd's got, it's not that much different.
1453643	1456985	It's just that the one that was on the site was a little more trancy.
1457005	1457726	But I liked it.
1457986	1459888	Personally, I thought it was a great track.
1460168	1461049	I don't like it.
1461109	1461969	I don't like that mix.
1463691	1467114	I can't fault him for that because he was just going off what he saw.
1468535	1471697	So, you know, I'm not really making fun of him right now.
1472058	1472338	All right.
1473820	1484662	The other thing I'd like to mention, that the whole genre of synth pop, at least my basing it off of this one group, it's pretty much trance mixed with industrial anyway, so, I mean, it's not that far off.
1484682	1485983	It's a little happier, too.
1486443	1493845	Yeah, it's like, if you were to take goth music and make it happy, and add trance to it, there you go.
1496685	1497725	Yes, uh, link's down.
1498446	1499126	Is this a new mic?
1499506	1499666	Yeah.
1499746	1500226	It's pretty nice.
1500286	1500466	Anyway.
1501144	1508008	A little bit of information for you, too, if you didn't know, but all trance and techno and all things derivative are all just disco, so, eh.
1508028	1510089	Alright, you ready to play the song?
1510169	1511409	Actually, wait, one thing I want to point out.
1511449	1512950	Where did you finally find this album?
1513170	1519473	I finally found it after a long time of searching at A. Rasputin Records in San Francisco.
1519713	1521134	I had been searching the whole Bay Area.
1521154	1526637	I went to all the little shops I could find, and then I lucked out, and they had one copy.
1527288	1528188	and they held it for me.
1529649	1530169	Where was it?
1530809	1531869	In the goth section.
1531969	1533309	In the goth section.
1534190	1536050	So the music you're about to hear is goth.
1536330	1537290	Technically, yeah.
1537430	1542451	If you trust Rasputin's titling of their music, it's goth.
1543692	1544012	Here we go.
1544072	1548373	Here's a song and I'm going to leave the microphones on so the microphones are still hot.
1548433	1553014	I'll just tell you what part isn't in it instead of telling you it starts here and ends here.
1553034	1554234	Just tell us what parts are in it.
1557563	1561826	Oh, okay, here we go.
1561946	1564508	Okay, yeah, this is obviously the intro to the song.
1564528	1565268	We have that too.
1589904	1594510	This part right here actually is also in it.
1594870	1600697	The section of the music that sounded just like this a second ago, that's not in it.
1600977	1602179	There's a bit of a difference.
1629946	1637211	This part right here is not in the game at all, so whenever the guy is singing by himself like this, it's not in there.
1637931	1640573	Which is not a big loss, even though I think the song is still good.
1676737	1678938	This music right here is still not in it.
1678958	1681259	Trust me, there is music in this song that we have, so... It's...
1705023	1711727	Yeah, I don't... It's the chatroom people, like, they know what they're talking about, too.
1712408	1716350	Once again, he's singing, so that means it's not in the game.
1717070	1725736	Yeah, pretty much, we have the beginning of the song and the end of the song.
1725756	1728618	We mixed at, uh... Oh, wait, what mix?
1728718	1729278	Oh, no.
1729298	1730619	This is on Ultramix.
1730639	1730779	Dude...
1764832	1766993	Okay, this music, we actually have.
1767253	1769194	So, rejoice in it.
1772216	1772937	Yeah, yeah.
1773077	1775138	The first time I heard this was like 80s music, but...
1794102	1797657	Okay, actually, from here on out, the rest is an ultramix, so...
1828796	1845329	So yeah, this song will definitely... From people I've talked to that have heard this song, they think it's probably going to be the breakout song for this mix.
1846090	1849392	And this music right here is not actually in the game, I lied.
1850173	1853556	So just up until the point where he kind of fades out is in the game.
1860259	1862300	I'll let the last 30 seconds of the full mix play off.
1866221	1874043	Yeah, now isn't this totally a goth song?
1874103	1876004	Shouldn't you be wearing black nail polish and makeup?
1880925	1885626	Alright, that's Echo Image with Skulk with Seeger doing some narrations there about what's in and not in the game.
1885646	1886487	My new favorite band.
1887067	1887667	I love it.
1888756	1894440	So you were kind of saying over there, but they might not have heard it, what was kind of the reaction to this song around the office from the testers?
1895441	1899564	People think it's a really great song, and it's probably going to be like the breakout song for the game.
1900565	1911114	Because, I mean, it's from a band you've never heard of, and so now you'll know that... What?
1911914	1915437	It's like, you can go find their CDs if you hunt hard enough for...
1918266	1927990	But I wouldn't be surprised if we do Ultramix 3 or something, that we might have to pay a lot of money to get some band like this now.
1928451	1929971	If it really is that well-received.
1931192	1932933	I think it's a great song, and I agree.
1932973	1937455	I think it's going to be one of those songs that suddenly the band is going to get noticed by all these DDR people.
1937475	1939475	They're going to be like, why don't these DDR people go away?
1940956	1942057	I think it's a great song.
1942117	1947019	I kind of compared it to Dark Black Forest, which I sort of saw as kind of like a breakout song from Max USA.
1947039	1948620	I know a lot of people kind of feel eh about it.
1948981	1952062	But it was kind of a song like nobody knew who the hell that guy was.
1952382	1955944	And then a lot of people were like, hey, the song's pretty cool, except for that vocal part.
1956465	1957225	Where are we going?
1958166	1959206	Now here's what they need to do.
1959967	1965810	Because there's going to be, of course, a lot of these commercial artists, some of which might not be known.
1966462	1976104	They need to do what they've done with DDR Extreme and do their live shows, tour these people that you might not have heard of before and do these songs in a giant tour.
1976144	1976624	That'd be awesome.
1976904	1986866	The kind of sad thing about it, though, since I'm now a huge fan of this band, is that this song is back from 2001, and I believe it's the singer has left the band.
1988087	1993868	Actually, if you go to their website, echoimage.com, I believe, they have new tracks that they're working on up
1994298	1997839	for download, or they did last time I checked, to kind of show off some of their new stuff.
1998079	2002060	I haven't actually listened to their new stuff yet, but this CD's good, so I guess that's all that matters.
2004301	2005541	Alright, so I hope you enjoyed that track.
2005561	2006781	Anybody else want to comment on the song?
2007161	2010482	Yeah, I think Denise Richards has a really big butt.
2010962	2012143	That has nothing to do with the song!
2012223	2012743	Shush!
2015356	2015916	Shame on you.
2016596	2021878	Anybody else want to comment on... Rice Princess, I know you go to... Well, I'll get back to Rice Princess.
2022058	2023318	Let DarkSakura make her comment.
2024039	2026559	Rice Princess, just give the mic to somebody.
2027160	2027880	Give it to DarkSakura.
2028360	2028940	She's the host.
2028960	2029540	She gets to talk.
2029660	2030721	I'm sorry.
2030741	2031201	I'm so sorry.
2031401	2034322	Rice Princess, I know you go to a lot of goth clubs sometimes.
2034762	2035022	So many.
2035162	2036062	Or at least one.
2036502	2038023	Is that a song you'd expect to hear there?
2039182	2043985	Well, you know... As the night is tragic!
2045526	2048208	It doesn't sound like a bat, so... No, I'm kidding.
2049589	2050530	No, it doesn't.
2050730	2055053	It doesn't sound anything like I would hear at a goth club.
2055093	2058135	I could definitely hear that at an industrial type club.
2058375	2063218	Something that would play like KMFDM and stuff like that could definitely go into this.
2063879	2063999	Yeah.
2065168	2066209	You got goth served.
2068230	2070952	Yeah, it's just a little too techno.
2070972	2074294	Maybe I'm just used to more of the stuff that was out in the 90s.
2074754	2078656	Maybe the new goth stuff is different, but I don't know.
2078736	2083179	I haven't really heard a lot of new gothic music, so.
2084482	2092367	Also, I wanted to point out while I was looking for this CD in the goth section, I found stuff like Delirium in there, which I don't think they're goth.
2092387	2093968	Delirium, no, that was in there.
2094048	2094588	Is that right?
2094648	2095549	Yeah, that's right.
2096829	2101252	You know, the whole thing that's been going on with the gothic scene nowadays is they're all gravers.
2101912	2104954	And if you don't know what a graver is, it's like a gothic raver.
2104994	2107776	See, what... Who is wrapping up my chamber door?
2107836	2108376	Open the door, dammit!
2111628	2113909	Okay, you do not touch the cable modem.
2115109	2115890	Don't even look at it!
2116290	2120091	Walk in, enter, move towards, away from the cable modem.
2120771	2121331	There you go.
2122232	2122892	We're safe.
2123452	2135256	Again, for those who are just joining us tonight, Comcast's modem that we have from them has been giving us issues all week, so we're afraid that if anybody looks at it funny, we're going to disconnect, and all you guys will get dropped from the show, and we'll have to reconnect and all that ugly stuff.
2135296	2136956	Oh, sure, don't introduce our guest.
2137216	2138196	Oh, yeah, Explicit's here.
2138236	2139597	Well, he's been here every week, so...
2140669	2142911	We have to... They know who he is.
2143331	2143651	Alright.
2146413	2149255	Jamie, you had a comment you wanted to make earlier and we weren't able to get to.
2149295	2151697	Yeah, you raised your hand trying to grab the mic and you didn't get it.
2154479	2155260	I like the song.
2155700	2155940	Okay.
2157821	2158122	Right on.
2158182	2159923	So like on a cage match scale of 1 to 10?
2161184	2159923	8.
2162365	2165527	8?
2162445	2165527	I mean, it was kind of repetitive and then it changed.
2166408	2166688	It's like...
2167870	2170952	I was sort of like falling back into the whole, okay, this is cool.
2171532	2172373	Oh wait, it's different now.
2173213	2174014	So that was good.
2174894	2178376	I like songs that sort of get me stuck on a pattern and then change suddenly.
2178817	2179657	So it's pretty cool.
2179677	2179997	Right on.
2181758	2182339	I listen to it.
2183339	2189483	So I'm trying to think if there's any other Ultramix or Extreme related questions that we can ask Sigurd.
2190944	2192145	What color is the box?
2192465	2193365	Stop.
2195207	2195727	What, uh...
2196624	2199164	Well, actually, I have questions about other Konami games.
2201385	2202545	I can try to answer them.
2203585	2208066	Can you give us any new news on Silent Hill 4 The Room, other than the fact that it's coming out soon?
2209966	2216708	It's really fun, and I've beaten it many times.
2216988	2220048	No, it's coming out for Xbox here.
2220948	2222189	That and PC, I guess.
2222229	2224829	That's the big thing about Silent Hill 4 here, and the soundtrack.
2225270	2228051	which we kind of talked about a couple weeks ago.
2229272	2229892	It was really good.
2229912	2233134	Jamie managed to get a copy of it, right?
2234054	2234555	From the store?
2235475	2237476	Yeah, it's out available now.
2237516	2240057	I think it's really only for pre-orders.
2242439	2245440	And people who live with GameStop employees, apparently.
2246120	2246881	Those cheaters.
2247421	2249202	Not supporting Silent Hill 4.
2250282	2251583	Oh, if it's pre-ordered, it's cool then.
2253224	2253304	Um...
2254275	2259759	But yeah, Silent Hill 5 has recently been talked about out on the internet.
2260420	2264783	It won't happen until the next generation of consoles, which is sad.
2264924	2266445	And you know, at the same time, it could be really good.
2266465	2268486	Yeah, not until the next generation consoles.
2269847	2275052	They actually really haven't decided which brand they're going to, if they're going to Microsoft or Sony.
2275472	2277954	They'll probably do both, but yeah.
2279373	2281434	So that's up with Silent Hill stuff, I guess.
2282074	2283876	Any news you can give us on Gradius V?
2284476	2286237	Well, I guess we all saw the Classic Gaming Expo, right?
2286257	2287358	Yeah, it's like coming out September.
2287418	2287959	What else is coming out?
2287979	2289340	You already caught up on Rumble Roses.
2289380	2290340	What else is coming out?
2290360	2290981	Suikoden IV.
2293142	2296925	It was originally slated for a hopeful November release.
2297345	2299987	It is now pushed back into January, which makes me sad.
2300848	2304550	Thank goodness my copy will be here next week.
2304750	2305791	The Japanese one, at least.
2307172	2308233	So I'll get to play some of that.
2310149	2311189	Okay, we have a question.
2311209	2311470	Hold on.
2311790	2312010	Yes.
2313972	2317995	It's pretty cool.
2321838	2323179	I've not really had a chance to play it.
2323199	2324920	I've watched a little bit of it.
2326101	2334468	I know there are some people complaining about some issues that Konami's doing with the game, like the sprite models or something, how they're 3D now instead of 2D.
2335048	2337850	I don't understand the complaints...
2339659	2341859	But yeah, it looks pretty good.
2342740	2344680	Really nice, graphically.
2347061	2351422	Did you say somebody was complaining that they changed the sprites from 2D to 3D for E6?
2352322	2353742	Because the game was originally all in 3D.
2354802	2355783	That's what I'm saying.
2356743	2358683	But you know, internet people can be stupid.
2361204	2362644	Yeah, it's not Konami's decision.
2362684	2364985	You can't blame the company that's just bringing it out.
2366105	2366925	Or you can, I guess.
2368186	2375592	They did the same exact thing when Suikoden III came out, because they went to the crappy looking blocky 3D models.
2380777	2385281	Suikoden IV is the best looking game in that series.
2388044	2389365	Yeah, the game is pretty crap, actually.
2389645	2391447	It's got a good story, but it's not fun to play.
2393079	2393699	What other Konami?
2393719	2394859	Any other Konami games I'm missing?
2395300	2395880	Probably not.
2396020	2402461	Unless we talk about Yu-Gi-Oh, which I can't since I don't know anything about Yu-Gi-Oh and I don't care to know anything about Yu-Gi-Oh.
2402481	2403261	No, I'm sorry.
2403761	2404481	I don't care about Yu-Gi-Oh.
2404541	2408822	I tried playing it like they do in the show and you had to get really dramatic and that makes it fun.
2409422	2414723	I can't believe you work for Konami and you're not corrupted and play Yu-Gi-Oh like all the other employees do.
2415864	2417764	Not all the other employees, just a select few.
2418277	2424883	Okay, I want to ask a question, and you don't have to answer this if you can't, or if you've never even heard of this, maybe you, you know, hold on.
2426684	2444400	There's, shush, there's this thing going on on the internet that went on like a couple months ago or whatever, where somebody packaged up an image of Silent Hill 1 for PlayStation, and like did a custom hack of an emulator for, a PlayStation emulator for a computer, and
2444904	2451073	and sent it around the internet saying that it was a PC version of Silent Hill 1, even though there has never been a PC version of Silent Hill 1.
2451754	2453817	Has Konami ever, like, said anything about this?
2453857	2456962	Have they noticed this and said, like, hey, or anything about it?
2458164	2466392	Um, I have never heard of that personally, and I pretty much can say that there never was a Silent Hill PC version.
2467353	2469995	Um, once again, it's the internet full of stupid people.
2471036	2477622	Uh, but, yeah, if there were a Silent Hill PC version, I would be one of the people to know about it, so...
2480922	2486685	Crazy question from the chat room, and I think even I could answer this one, but... Okay, let me break their hearts.
2486985	2491007	Wants to know about the Simpsons arcade game ever possibly coming out on Game Boy Advance.
2492148	2493068	And I can answer this.
2494529	2497030	Acclaim does all the licenses for the Simpsons game, correct?
2497090	2497570	Not Konami?
2497650	2498951	Yeah.
2499491	2500752	This is kind of related.
2502192	2503113	We got an email...
2504271	2508054	Some stupid person.
2508074	2509575	Yeah, I know, it's great.
2510656	2511516	I think of them highly.
2513097	2516640	Asking us to bring out a Final Fantasy VII fighting game.
2520122	2521383	Well, yeah, there's air guys, but...
2522156	2527457	I really don't remember when we merged with Square Enix, so... Squeenixnami.
2528657	2530098	Squeenixnami.
2530298	2530958	Squeenami.
2537119	2538779	I like Squeenami, I have to say.
2539420	2539920	Squeenami.
2540180	2546921	I mean, there's some funny people that send in some great emails, and that's just one of their best ones.
2548281	2550722	I want to know if you guys are going to release a good Ridge Racer.
2552668	2553969	I really like the Pac-Man car.
2576997	2579598	We each pick one song to play for you guys.
2580038	2582559	And you're going to pick your favorite of the three songs.
2582599	2592384	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio in our Bomani Music and More program, which is on the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
2593384	2593724	All right.
2595205	2598286	Last week in the... You have to be in our chat room to participate, though.
2598946	2602528	www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
2604443	2619769	Alright, and we're going to do the first song, which won last week, and it was a track that was by Outphase, quote-unquote, although we all deemed it to be fake, not really an Outphase song, but for whatever reason, you guys liked it anyway, and it was Loki's pick.
2619989	2624731	And the song is Nuon, and it won last week, so we only get to hear a clip of it, because it was the winner.
2625111	2629573	So here it is, Not Outphase with Nuon, last week's winner.
2705738	2706499	Thanks for watching!
2752956	2755117	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
2755157	2757519	DJ Taka and Tack with Outphase and Nuon.
2757599	2762662	Next up in tonight's cage match is Jamie's pick, but first... Sigurd!
2763883	2767565	Didn't you bring something else you wanted to play for our listeners tonight?
2769306	2770126	He's nodding yes.
2770467	2771828	They can't hear him because he's in the kitchen.
2772088	2775670	But I'll go ahead and play this sound clip that Sigurd wanted me to play for you guys.
2778512	2778912	That's it?
2781513	2782354	Here it is one more time.
2784997	2785358	Interesting.
2785378	2786098	Well, you know what?
2786118	2788059	We're going to help you guys out, though.
2788480	2791681	I happen to have the website that that sound clip came from.
2792622	2794243	So, enjoy.
2796044	2796605	One more time.
2798726	2800907	Alright, and I posted that website in our chat room.
2800967	2801628	Have fun, kids.
2802348	2804109	Alright, back into our cage match.
2805990	2807711	Song number two is from Jamie tonight.
2808292	2810613	And what is your pick tonight, Jamie?
2811133	2812915	Something from Basement Jax.
2812995	2813515	I don't remember.
2814133	2815794	The song was Lucky Star, if you need it again.
2815814	2816094	Oh, yeah.
2816114	2817714	Lucky Star from Basement Jacks.
2818055	2818415	All right.
2818975	2820596	Any particular reason you wanted to pick this song?
2820876	2822736	Because I like it.
2823877	2824217	All right.
2824517	2825637	I was high on NyQuil.
2826258	2826918	I mean, DayQuil.
2827298	2827598	All right.
2827658	2827998	Here it is.
2828118	2830279	Basement Jacks with Lucky Star.
2830439	2831900	It's song number two in tonight's cage match.
2831920	2832160	Enjoy.
2853837	2869027	We were up so ridiculously, beauty portrayed so innocently, us natives act immigratly, grew up carrying loads of property, little checks did cram for a while, I was born in the court of the puppeteers, I was a stand just for money on trial, robbery, fraud did affect me, kept me in the sky of the old building, but
2913152	2931200	I've come a little way in a little long time, from doing straight over reason, picking crime I've come far in a little long way, I would just like to say I feel fine Cause I was down for a little long day, straight right up here in red space, too bad I was left in a little long state, I would just like to say I feel great So don't make me laugh, put your mouth back, I've been no money for
2936607	2937528	Thank you for watching!
3108817	3111997	Welcome back, that was song number two, Basement Jax with Lucky Star.
3112017	3114538	Let's go around and see what the folks in here thought.
3114558	3118199	But remember, it's up to you guys in the end, so you have to be in our chat room too, I guess.
3118879	3119439	DarkSakura.
3119799	3124420	I like songs with a lot of beat in them, a lot of rhythm, a lot of substance.
3124440	3127081	It's not too, hi, I'm floating on air sounding, you know?
3128206	3128686	I'll go next.
3128726	3130147	I thought it was kind of cool.
3130207	3134449	It actually kind of reminded me just a little bit of some of the J-pop stuff you've been playing for me lately.
3134469	3136469	I think I can see why you like that one.
3137530	3138230	Just a little bit.
3138310	3143592	It kind of sounds like a bit of that M-flow, a little bit.
3155937	3160240	I'm not so sure I dig the rapping, but I like the instrumentation quite a bit.
3160340	3162762	So, like, seven and a half, eight-ish.
3163103	3163523	Somewhere in there.
3164163	3164664	Uh, Jonas.
3165684	3166485	Explicit, sorry.
3167025	3168847	Don't worry, you can call me anything you want.
3169567	3172990	Um... Okay, okay, okay, no kidding.
3173010	3173590	Okay, daddy.
3174511	3176012	Okay, not everything, sorry.
3176452	3178194	Anyways, I'll give it an eight out of ten.
3178434	3178974	Pretty good.
3179675	3182457	I wouldn't give it, like, a nine out of ten, because it has some flaws and stuff, but...
3183680	3186563	It's not perfect, but it's pretty good for someone to listen to.
3188524	3189325	Alright, Angel?
3191046	3192548	Good instrumental, I liked it, it was cool.
3193789	3196752	And you know what I mean by when I say instrumental, so.
3196832	3197212	On 1 to 10?
3198073	3199294	Um, probably a solid 8.
3199474	3201195	Alright, solid 8 from Angel.
3201356	3203938	Uh, Sigurd and Rice Princess, do you guys have a comment on this one?
3205659	3206680	On this song, basic chat.
3206880	3207881	We're doing age match?
3208101	3209042	I'm eating a cookie.
3209463	3210524	So I give the cookie an 8.
3212262	3212662	All right.
3213022	3215886	I'm not even going to ask Rice Princess the smart-ass thing she has to say.
3215906	3217828	I'm just going to go to the next song, which is my song.
3218428	3222513	And as I promised last week, I am bringing in Danny Minow this week.
3223544	3225285	Except this is not one of her songs.
3225546	3227767	It's a song featuring Danny Minow.
3227787	3228728	So it's just her vocals.
3229088	3234672	And actually, the artist is Riva, who did a really good remix of Ayo with Rapture.
3234833	3237354	I don't know if you guys know that song, but if you know that song, you heard it in clubs.
3237374	3238255	They did that remix.
3238315	3239016	It's really awesome.
3239396	3242698	So this is Riva featuring Danny Minow with Who Do You Love Now?
3242758	3243019	Enjoy.
3257112	3265194	And it's hard to know what you're thinking When it's hard to lock your head You're too promised in perception
3326753	3327874	Thank you for watching!
3454475	3456495	All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
3457135	3458416	Riva featuring Danny Minow.
3458536	3459736	Who do you love now?
3459836	3462297	Let's see if it was loved now or hated now.
3462417	3462977	DarkSakura.
3463698	3464398	It's Trancy.
3465998	3471400	And I like Trance, but lately I've just been so burned on Trancy Trancy.
3472160	3473981	But it was really good, so...
3477313	3479355	I'll give it a 7.5 to 8.
3479975	3481236	So yeah, it was good.
3481316	3482016	It was really solid.
3482377	3483417	Alright, sounds good.
3483617	3485259	And your voice didn't annoy me this time.
3485939	3487620	Me voting, I think it's great.
3487760	3488061	I give it a 9.
3488221	3488921	Enough said.
3489542	3489822	Loki.
3490842	3492063	Hi, my name's Danny Minow.
3492223	3494145	I don't have an original bone in my body.
3496502	3498524	She's basically Kylie Minogue, too.
3498904	3502006	I'm gonna take everything that she makes and make it my own!
3502086	3503107	Yeah!
3503728	3512114	One thing you should know if you were paying attention to the chatroom, they're talking about how they took Kylie Minogue's leg, cut it off, and grew it in a giant nascent jar with toothpicks to grow Danny.
3513515	3517779	Yeah, that's cool, you know, if you want to do that to, like, you know, some of the other hot chicks out there.
3518139	3518920	I'd be down with that.
3519740	3521101	That's all we need is hot clones.
3521682	3523003	Screw cloning ugly people.
3523403	3525405	Oh, yeah, I give it a seven, because it was...
3528666	3530107	TDR Angel, what did you think of that one?
3530547	3531047	I liked it.
3531267	3531647	Duh.
3531887	3537349	I mean, we all know why, right?
3537650	3538850	I guess I'll give it an 8.
3539070	3540110	Alright.
3540231	3543712	No, I'm not trying to compliment myself from last time, I just thought that, yeah, anyway.
3543892	3545232	Alright, an 8 from Angel.
3545472	3545793	Jonas?
3546393	3545793	8.
3547533	3548053	8, simply?
3548294	3548534	Simply 8.
3548654	3551535	Simply just sounds like, it sounds like the same, but still pretty good.
3552955	3553756	Dependent in a way.
3554156	3557337	Does anybody in the kitchen, Seager, RicePrincess, LinkSail, have a comment?
3557981	3558742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3584497	3587800	Alright, song number two tonight, Basement Jacks with Lucky Star.
3593885	3603273	Alright, song number three, Reva featuring Danny Minow, Who Do You Love Now.
3615089	3616310	All right, those are the three songs.
3616610	3621494	Place vote now, and you only have a minute to vote, so please place your vote now.
3622114	3625617	And we've got to hurry up and get through this, because I do want to open up guessing.
3625877	3626297	Not yet.
3626437	3630260	Do not send guesses on the song yet, but I'm going to open it up as soon as Cage Match Voting is over, so please hurry.
3630460	3632261	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
3632281	3635363	You know what that song sounded like, though, that Danny Minow song?
3635644	3636964	It sounded like that one...
3638183	3642724	I don't know, I don't know what to tell you.
3664516	3671358	Sigurd, I hate to tear you away from the conversation, but I had a really good question come in while the cage match was going on.
3672559	3673139	Oh, I know.
3673219	3675560	God, you mean I've got to come talk to Rob?
3675620	3676760	God, he's going to yell at me again.
3678941	3682822	Okay, what are these people interrupting my conversation in the kitchen for?
3683042	3684823	All right, let's see.
3684863	3688444	The question was... Who is it by, so I know if I'm actually going to address it?
3688464	3688904	Cutress.
3691385	3692445	Is that microphone going out?
3693556	3694277	I don't know, is it?
3694557	3695157	Hello?
3695197	3696699	Probably, I'm just hearing a lot of static.
3697660	3698280	Oh, it's the cords.
3698440	3699121	Alright, careful guys.
3701243	3704565	Was DDR involved at all in Konami's Friday press event?
3704705	3713973	GameStop's coverage didn't have anything in it at all, even though it is covered in Karaoke Revolution Xbox, or I'm sorry, even though it did cover Karaoke Revolution Xbox and Karaoke Revolution 3.
3715895	3720759	To my knowledge, I don't believe there's any DDR information, but you have to understand that
3721255	3726817	We have lives on the weekend, and I didn't even know until today that there was a press event on, what, Friday?
3727437	3731918	So, like, I first heard about that stupid Suikoden IV pushback today.
3732518	3736980	And as Rob can attest, I was kind of vocal and loud and angry about it.
3737540	3739460	But, yeah, I don't think anything was announced.
3740861	3743802	Your best source of information will always be...
3745726	3756353	Something you'll hear from like the Vivid members on DDR Freak And Orangela- Orangela- That microphone's going out, can we get some electric tape on that?
3756573	3757274	God damn it!
3757654	3759255	Stop breaking the damn mic!
3759775	3761336	I'm gonna kill all you people!
3761376	3764218	You keep replacing mics every week because you keep swinging them around!
3765159	3766760	Or maybe spilling soda on them!
3768041	3774487	I am microphone... You guys are cutting out completely on the microphone.
3775307	3779471	I'm going to go to kind of like an emergency break here while we fix the microphone.
3779571	3785036	So let's go to... I'm going to tally up the cage match votes here.
3786037	3786497	Let's see.
3786897	3787278	Stop it.
3788899	3789820	Let's go to...
3792603	3793625	No, see, you can hear it.
3793745	3794086	All right.
3795308	3798093	Let's just go to air and we'll be back.
3799034	3799255	Air.
3864113	3866474	Alright, we're back and hopefully we have that microphone fixed.
3866494	3866835	Not sure.
3866875	3867395	I yelled at it.
3867415	3868556	You yelled at it and it works?
3868576	3869056	Who's got it now?
3889008	3890749	See, it's not working right now.
3892250	3893851	I pushed it in and it sounds like it's working now.
3893871	3895151	See, I told you something was going on there.
3895171	3896572	It's because it doesn't like her.
3896652	3897232	It likes me.
3898433	3899413	This microphone likes me.
3899854	3905957	Look, it's working just fine now because I used my secret woman power on it and now it works.
3907938	3911580	I used the power of estrogen on this microphone.
3913700	3915741	The power of estrogen compels me.
3917082	3918923	I need a young priest and an old priest.
3919684	3921005	And some split pea soup.
3921665	3926568	I'm getting the last few votes for Cage Match titled It's Too Late to Submit a Vote.
3926728	3929070	Ooh, a lot of votes for that song coming in at the last minute.
3929710	3935114	But it doesn't look like it's going to be enough to top this one, who has won for this week's Cage Match.
3938736	3941058	Once again, not outphased with Nuance.
3942782	3947125	A lot of votes there coming in at the last second for Basement Jacks, but not enough.
3947506	3949747	And actually, Danny Minow almost tied it.
3949928	3951369	Almost tied it, about two votes short.
3952930	3955172	Britney Spears.
3955492	3957673	They only heard the last part of that Britney Spears thing.
3958174	3959175	Britney Spears next week.
3959355	3959755	That's it.
3960195	3960596	Next week.
3961516	3963278	Next week I make you all listen to Toxic.
3964819	3965159	Alright.
3966640	3967561	Or like more J-Lo.
3967901	3969923	I want to talk about some other Bomani news that came up.
3970063	3970683	Oh, by the way...
3972682	3981265	By the way, now you guys, you can submit three minutes, you guys, to submit a guess for the new Ultramix 2 song based off of two clues we've given you tonight.
3981645	3983726	Send a private message to Sky if you have a guess.
3984166	3988707	Remember, the winner will get to be the first to say what it is, because we'll say that they were right, and then they can tell.
3988767	3989848	And they can tell us over Skype.
3990228	3994749	If you go to our website and do the Interact With Us feature, you can tell us through Skype.
3994829	3995370	It's pretty cool.
3995790	3999651	So you have three minutes to submit a guess, so I suggest you do so.
4001612	4002112	Meanwhile,
4003567	4007253	I want to talk about some other Bomani news that came up this week.
4015613	4018316	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4040091	4041453	It was something called DDR Festival.
4041773	4046419	But then Konami pulled it off their page, but... What?
4046659	4047160	What, Sigurd?
4049683	4050964	Sigurd, come here and tell us about this.
4059414	4059715	Sigurd.
4061192	4064413	Yes, you gotta jiggle the cord if you can't hear yourself because the speaker's here.
4064493	4069354	Okay, um, I don't know why people are like, oh, they took it down, it's not real.
4069494	4072355	It's a real game, it's been announced, people are taking pre-orders for it.
4072815	4073275	Shut up.
4074156	4077016	Is there anything you can tell us about DDR Festival?
4077517	4078677	Um, not really.
4079777	4081058	Festival, not, yeah.
4081098	4081858	I'm sorry, Festival.
4082218	4084499	Um, no, not really.
4084939	4089360	I know a little bit of stuff, but nothing I can actually say.
4090436	4091957	All right, nothing you can actually say, that's fine.
4092477	4098459	All right, anything you've heard about the pop music in the 8th style stuff?
4100280	4109183	That's all, like, Konami of Japan stuff, and, you know, it's all taken care of over there, so... All right.
4109843	4113364	If it comes through our offices, though, you won't hear about it until it comes out.
4114365	4116605	Because it'd be, like, a huge thing, probably.
4118706	4121007	Alright, so what was your guys' reaction?
4121027	4127191	Because I know that there's been a lot of, like, kind of questions, like, when's Pop Music 10 going to be announced?
4127211	4136317	Because I even know that Navi, our resident Poppin' Music whore, was here a couple weeks ago, and he was kind of like, usually about now would be when they're announcing Poppin' 10, but they haven't yet.
4136617	4141800	And then to kind of get 8th style, without a two-year wait, like we, it felt like we had last time.
4141820	4147404	Well, Konami had huge success with 7th style, so obviously it made sense to them to bring out 8th.
4148064	4152948	As for Poppin Music, if you're worried about that going away anytime soon, just look at the arcade one.
4152988	4157752	It's like on, you know, Poppin Music 387, since they come out daily, pretty much.
4159286	4159806	D.R.
4159826	4161287	was a surprise, though, that's for sure.
4162108	4162408	Yeah.
4162428	4163049	It's Japan.
4163449	4168573	But, well, I guess you probably can't say if there's any truth to the eye toy thing or not, but I know that's a rumor that's going around.
4168593	4169593	That is a rumor indeed.
4169693	4172095	Alright, but you cannot, neither confirm or deny it, that's fine.
4172535	4182723	Alright, um, so, what about, like, style, I know you said this before on the show, something about 2DX8 style coming out was the biggest thing for you, and now here's the news, November 18th.
4182823	4187246	Oh, I freaking, yeah, like, 7th style, I really like the soundtrack a lot, because that was the
4188001	4193022	To me, that's the Kuria Moka soundtrack, you know, it's got the most Kuria Moka tunes as any soundtrack.
4193923	4202145	Oh yeah, 5th, it's got a lot too, but I just, every single Kuria Moka song on 7th is like my favorite, which is kind of weird, three songs being my favorite, but whatever.
4202765	4215628	Yeah, so I like 7th style, but I hated the, you know, obviously the price tag is way too high, and the whole, like, the whole problems we had to go through just to get it, you know, going on the Japanese site and getting fake, you know, information just to get them to send it here.
4216149	4216749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4246209	4247374	Hopefully they'll continue to make them.
4247996	4251732	I mean, even if they're not going to keep making DDR stuff, Japanese DDR games, then hey.
4252930	4255491	2DX is my original love anyway, so.
4256092	4256452	Alright.
4256992	4257813	Or Beatmania, whatever.
4257933	4261935	Anybody else have anything they want to say on Poppin' Music 10 or 2DX 8 Style?
4262495	4263776	Angel's coming up to say something?
4263816	4265537	Gotta make my order, you know.
4266397	4269479	I am going to be so broke between all the games in the U.S.
4269559	4270079	coming out.
4270559	4272100	Oh, God, I just want to scream.
4272140	4272761	It's so horrible.
4273721	4276222	I mean, it's great, but at the same time, my bank account is crying.
4277063	4277263	Angel.
4278354	4279035	Here goes the mic again.
4279075	4279995	Oh, never mind, I can hear myself.
4280035	4280436	Yay!
4281657	4287781	Yeah, so I am definitely going to buy 2DX 8th and Pop Music 10.
4289603	4295187	Hopefully Love is Orange is on 2DX 8th, because, well, yeah, it's Orange Lounge.
4296388	4298289	I wasn't trying to make a pun there, but I guess I just did.
4299010	4301111	And Pop Music 10... Oh, you're fading out there.
4302252	4302553	Damn it.
4302773	4303293	Okay, there we go.
4303774	4306996	Pop Music 10, obviously Goonies, because Goonies is cool.
4307631	4308031	Yes, it is.
4308752	4309032	All right.
4309873	4314538	I think we're going to go to... Oh, I wanted to do some more song guesses real fast.
4314578	4316540	Can somebody tell Sigurd to come in real fast?
4317341	4318302	Tell Sigurd to come in real fast.
4318322	4319963	They went outside to have a smoke or something.
4325149	4326250	Sorry, I got more guesses.
4326270	4326410	Yes.
4330512	4333274	William Tell William Tell William Tell William Tell
4360286	4361567	That was some good reasoning, though.
4361727	4362567	What was the reasoning?
4363068	4373837	Because he said something about tattletales, and then something about the galloping was supposed to symbolize the William Tell overture, because Tell, I don't know.
4374017	4377600	You can come up with good reasoning, and I'll give you a thumbs up for that, but still wrong.
4378120	4380422	MJSI24 says, across the nightmare.
4380562	4380782	No.
4381643	4384906	No reasoning also, so even if it was right, I wouldn't tell you.
4385577	4396161	And then we have, let's see, Kabut says, Bad Girls by Julia Roberts just because of that quote we played earlier.
4396341	4396501	No.
4396781	4396921	No.
4397241	4397561	All right.
4398481	4399782	But yay, you gave reasoning.
4399822	4400222	That's good.
4400322	4402803	I guess we'll have to do another hint somewhat soon.
4404093	4404293	Yeah.
4404613	4405113	All right.
4405173	4408094	We're going to take a break, and we'll be back to talk about more stuff.
4408214	4410534	Maybe we'll get into the FUs of the week pretty soon.
4411454	4412394	That sounds like an idea to me.
4412414	4418075	We're going to get into the FUs of the week when we come back, so you can send FUs to Sky in the chat room.
4418355	4421976	After this break, featuring music from Poppin' Music 10 and 2DX8 Style.
4422036	4422456	We'll be back.
4433701	4434582	S, Actdeft, S, Actdeft
4459505	4460668	Thanks for watching!
4522197	4530243	Alright, we had more we wanted to play, but Sigurd, you had something you wanted to ask me about.
4530303	4532445	You know that... Use my microphone.
4550066	4552968	You know that game show back in the day, Let's Make a Deal?
4553669	4554830	Yeah, I've heard of that show.
4555550	4559033	Remember when they would pick the wrong curtain and that funny thing would happen?
4559493	4561294	Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, the goat and stuff?
4561795	4563336	Yeah, that was great.
4564377	4566578	Yes, yes, I think so too.
4567039	4568320	It was clue-erific.
4569641	4570802	I think so too.
4579676	4580581	Thanks for watching!
4671898	4672883	Thanks for watching!
4726019	4727261	Thanks for watching!
4783437	4803330	Alright, Orange Lounge Radio is here, and we'll do one more song, but for some reason it's come to my attention that not everybody may have picked up what Secret and I were talking about there before that song, so can we grab Secret again real fast, tell him I'm really sorry, but for some reason some people didn't hear it, so we'll do it one more time.
4805382	4809285	Sigurd, I'm sorry, for some reason people couldn't hear what you were asking me about.
4809305	4811367	I have no idea what the hell's going on, but some people missed it.
4811968	4813329	So again, we'll use my mic here.
4813569	4815431	You wanted to ask me about something during this break.
4816091	4821636	It's not going to be as cool this time, but hey, you know that show, that game show, Let's Make a Deal?
4822457	4823918	Yes, I still remember that show.
4823938	4825379	It's the one where they dress up and shit, right?
4825860	4830644	Yeah, wasn't it, or do you remember that thing, you know, when they picked the wrong door or curtain?
4831705	4833026	I do remember that, with the goats and stuff.
4833464	4835705	Yeah, that was awesome, wasn't it?
4836526	4838547	Why, yes, I think it was.
4839547	4841789	I think it's really great that you're asking me about it.
4842309	4845311	Isn't it clue-rific, or hint-tastic?
4909522	4910183	Thanks for watching!
4985438	4991283	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
4996087	5000030	We are back and some of you guys are probably doing a little bit of research right now.
5000170	5002292	I'm very interested in some of the stuff I'm reading in the chat room.
5004131	5010937	Very interesting theories going on there, so I can't wait to open it up to do another round of guesses, because I think maybe somebody could get it this time.
5011237	5017142	I think other people are just thinking we are completely smoking crack, which wouldn't be too far from the truth, actually.
5017543	5019084	So, yeah, secrets.
5020092	5026977	Um, and you know, if you read the extreme thread, we like to throw out stuff that doesn't make any sense, or might, or might not be a clue.
5027397	5032861	Um, this is actually an honest-to-goodness clue, I'll say that right now, so if you're thinking we're just, like, blowing smoke up, no, we're not.
5033661	5039485	If somebody gets the song tonight, so we actually get to play the song, then we will explain all the clues, as well.
5039785	5040706	And you're gonna hit yourself.
5040946	5041326	Or not.
5041426	5043328	Or you'll still think we smoke crack, which is fine.
5043588	5044549	You can go ahead and think that.
5044829	5045369	Uh, screw you.
5045609	5045849	Alright.
5046770	5049753	So now we're going to get into tonight's FUs of the week.
5050293	5057899	I advise you, though, that if you send your FU via the chat room, it better be good or it may not be read, because there's a lot of people in the chat room tonight.
5057940	5061262	We are only going to have to be selective in reading chat room FUs tonight.
5061322	5064565	So, Jamie, though, this is your baby, right, the FUs of the week?
5064985	5065926	Oh, hell yeah.
5066227	5068789	And why do we love the FUs of the week?
5069729	5070610	And I can't hear you.
5070630	5071491	Jiggle that mic thing.
5071551	5072792	I have to have an outlet somehow.
5072992	5073693	All right, here we go.
5090002	5095027	My first FU goes towards the great amount of roadkill I saw on Madison.
5095687	5098290	Lots and lots and lots of roadkill.
5099010	5103334	Seriously, I like passed by like at least six dead squirrels.
5104215	5106117	One of them was like missing a head, it was gross.
5106758	5109640	And then there was this big pile of blood and gore.
5113784	5116947	I'm so glad the chatroom could not hear what you just said.
5118188	5128977	I remember one time, though, coming up here, I couldn't... By the way, to Cutress, I can't read private messages since I'm on the main cabinet.
5130078	5131178	So I'm not at home.
5131679	5133781	So don't send me any private messages, please.
5133901	5134121	Sorry.
5135147	5139288	If you want to send me a message to get it later, just send me on DarkSakura.ssf and I'll read it when I get home.
5140088	5149551	Anyway, a big F you to sinuses and allergies for totally just screwing with my head today.
5150051	5152912	I'm on so much medication that it's not even funny.
5153372	5156453	And like, my poor cat, she's like, Mama, love me?
5156853	5159854	And she gets in my lap and I'm like, get out of my lap!
5159954	5161074	You're shedding in my nose!
5162048	5162729	So I had to push her off.
5163269	5171595	And then, a big F you to people who tailgate me when, like, people are going 15 miles under the speed limit in front of me and there's nobody in front of them.
5172356	5176959	And, like, I couldn't change lanes because I was, like, a block away from here.
5177340	5178841	It would have been pointless to change lanes.
5179101	5181323	And then, like, the guy suddenly turns and I'm like, you ass.
5181463	5183684	So, I was just completely pissed off.
5183744	5189389	And also, and this is not like a true F you because I adore my fiancé.
5190629	5193751	But when I don't want to be touched, stop trying to hold my hand.
5197134	5201937	If I'm PMSing and I don't want you to hold my hand or be lovey, don't do it.
5203118	5203779	Get my clue.
5203919	5204459	Don't do it.
5204959	5206140	Give woman space, please.
5209343	5213005	And then... I don't know.
5213325	5215387	I sort of lost my thunder there for a little bit.
5215407	5215767	I'm sorry.
5216408	5216848	I'm sorry.
5217461	5218922	That's really got on my nerves.
5218942	5219402	I'm sitting here.
5219742	5221703	I'm trying to drink my Pepsi at breakfast.
5222304	5227547	And, like, I'm so tired and aggravated and everything.
5227887	5229368	And Dan's like, I want to hold your hand.
5230548	5232750	And also, F you to people who called during the show.
5233990	5236272	Don't call the home line during the show.
5237272	5239193	Unless you don't know the show exists, then you're forgiven.
5241715	5242695	Okay, I guess that was it.
5245237	5245557	All right.
5246528	5255375	Also, um, F you to having to install more crap on my computer when my computer space is supposed to be taken up by Stargate episodes.
5256496	5257096	Okay, so bye.
5258337	5260699	Alright, uh, Loki, your turn for your FUs of the week.
5262420	5267904	I'd like to start off with a big ha-ha to the fucking big rig that's out front of our apartment complex, Jackknife.
5268785	5269265	Yeah!
5269686	5271927	So, uh, basically, yeah, my sister's coming back.
5272168	5275070	Anyways, um, so F you to them because they suck.
5276411	5277931	There's a jackknife, big rig up front.
5278332	5287914	Anyways, um, and, um, also, uh, fuck you to, um, the fucking Classic Gaming Expo for being so lame.
5288314	5294176	I mean, games were cool back then, just the people, just the people that play them now aren't cool.
5294696	5295636	So, you know, hey.
5297257	5298177	Um, oh wait, that's me.
5299537	5301318	Anyways, um, then, uh,
5302054	5307217	Fuck you, the goddamn IPAC, because I had to fucking rewire my entire cabinet just to get the damn thing to work.
5308538	5310019	But it works now, so that makes me happy.
5310639	5315602	And, um, fuck you to my soda cravings, because they're making it very difficult on me.
5315943	5319085	But I have to thank, uh, Lemonade.
5320345	5322527	Okay, good soda cravings.
5322647	5324148	Diet shit doesn't count.
5325185	5326485	That's like drinking water.
5326665	5328466	Actually, it's like drinking rancid water.
5329126	5332027	You know, I'd rather drink rancid water before a diet crap.
5332347	5333348	Yeah, diet.
5334748	5335008	Okay.
5335388	5337309	But anyways, that's all I have right now.
5338069	5339810	I gotta go see this truck, because it's on fire.
5340570	5342551	Okay, we have an update.
5343011	5346472	Loki's... Wait, Loki, can we talk to Loki's sister here real fast?
5347802	5349683	Yeah, that's why I was... Hold on a minute.
5350023	5351864	Are we all stuck here right now?
5352045	5352245	Yeah.
5352745	5353686	You guys can't leave.
5353766	5355907	The big rig is across the entire road going...
5356590	5357951	Eastbound or whatever direction that is.
5358051	5358991	No cars are moving.
5359031	5360772	Everybody's turning around and going back to Granite Bay.
5367035	5369256	Jamie wants the digicam to go take pictures.
5370176	5377319	We're going to go to a quick break while we figure out what the hell is going on in the FUs to be continued in just a little bit, guys.
5377359	5379440	Sorry for the delay, but there's a little bit of chaos.
5379760	5382441	Again, we are all stuck here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5382561	5383682	We are not allowed to leave.
5384162	5386324	Because there is a jackknife truck outside.
5386344	5386764	We'll be back.
5604984	5608245	All right, we are back, and if you missed, what the hell's going on?
5608285	5624810	Basically, there's been a giant accident on a main... We live on a very major artery that connects two towns together, and there's been a truck that looks like it was carrying new vehicles or something on it that kind of has jackknifed its way across the whole road.
5625030	5627871	So no cars can cross this road right now, which means...
5628311	5634573	That for a lot of the folks here at the studio, if they have rides coming in or something, they're not going to be able to get here unless they know to come a big back way around.
5634653	5636674	So it's going to be very interesting.
5636754	5643456	So sorry about that, guys, but that was very interesting because we thought for a moment we were stuck here if there was a big fire.
5643476	5646057	But it doesn't look like it's flaming or there's a fire going on anymore.
5646497	5648098	But Jamie did run out there with my camera.
5649138	5650719	And Loki's out there, too.
5650759	5654580	We are going to continue the show and doing the FUs of the week.
5656181	5656281	So...
5657538	5661442	We still got Sigurd here in Rise Princess because you guys already saw the accident.
5661482	5662063	Did you hear it?
5662303	5662803	I didn't hear it.
5662823	5665005	I didn't even hear it.
5665045	5666367	I was inside when it happened.
5667047	5674475	But I went out there and they told me about it and I was like, well, I'm sad for the person who's in the accident, but I'm not going to go right out and see it.
5674875	5675195	Weird.
5675496	5675936	Very weird.
5676016	5676336	All right.
5677498	5679500	Let's move on with the FUs of the week, shall we?
5679520	5680901	It was my turn when we left off.
5687194	5692556	My FU of the week goes to that accident going on out there and taking away from the show.
5692576	5693337	That was crazy.
5693357	5697338	Yeah, it was too crowded in here anyway, though, so that's a good point.
5698999	5705001	Also, just a big FU to me falling asleep while driving yesterday.
5705121	5705702	Not really, though.
5707842	5709803	Wait, Jamie's back.
5710223	5710844	Jamie's back.
5711584	5712204	Hold on.
5713285	5715445	Now that Jamie is interrupting my FUs, that's all right.
5715505	5716566	All right, Jamie, what were you saying?
5717571	5720040	That was the most goddamn boring accident I've ever saw.
5720321	5721967	And it's some stupid car driver's fault.
5722409	5723312	They ran into the truck.
5724676	5729920	Okay, now, I don't, now normally, okay, you might say, okay, I don't understand how you didn't see that car.
5730260	5732502	Or, I didn't, I don't understand how you didn't see that truck.
5732782	5737266	How about, I don't know how you didn't see that truck carrying a bunch of boats.
5737586	5738907	I mean, this thing is like a gigantic.
5738927	5739587	Oh, they were boats.
5740048	5747914	Yeah, okay, this thing is carrying about, it's about, imagine a, like, 12 foot tall wall that spans about 30 feet long.
5748094	5749215	How do you miss that?
5750015	5751176	While driving down the road.
5752017	5752497	Seriously.
5753138	5754519	I just think it's funny that for once
5755137	5756598	This show wasn't the only wreck.
5757579	5758019	Shut up.
5760261	5762603	F you to Brad for that comment, you're a fucktard.
5762903	5763184	Alright.
5764705	5770690	Let's go on and hear from other folks in our studio, their FUs of the week, starting with LankyStyle, since he has a microphone.
5770710	5777535	F you goes to the proprietors of the house I'm living in, because now I have to go find a job very quickly and a new apartment.
5777735	5778436	Yay!
5780257	5784541	And I know it's very unlikely they could be listening to this show, but it's also possible they could be.
5785495	5786675	I don't fucking care what you think.
5787715	5788536	So, there you go.
5790196	5791856	Alright, very interesting.
5791936	5793897	Okay, Jonas, do you have any FUs you want to give out?
5797937	5803878	Okay, everyone probably said about the FU about the car wreck.
5804698	5805639	God, drivers.
5805979	5806999	Drive safely.
5808759	5810720	I don't have to keep mentioning this so many times.
5812060	5812520	Ugh.
5813462	5814342	No fucking comment on that.
5814602	5819064	Okay, F you to the server that I'm hosting my sims and my database on.
5819104	5820124	It keeps shutting down.
5820324	5820644	Damn it.
5821705	5825886	And people quit hacking on it and quit hitting the too much bandwidth.
5825906	5826166	Sorry.
5826966	5827747	Killing my bandwidth.
5829047	5830568	You know this is free for me, so.
5831588	5835329	Okay, F you to my current manager right now.
5836069	5837630	We're not giving me a damn raise.
5838090	5839190	Okay, I'm three steps back.
5839291	5840611	People would get paid like
5841437	5844520	A shitload, and I'm just here getting minimum wage for now.
5847062	5850345	And for the love of God, I'm helping your arcade try to get better a little bit.
5851266	5852447	Bring more business towards it.
5853628	5859994	Another F you goes to my former manager for getting two people to quit the job that I'm working at.
5860454	5865659	Thanks a lot, you're accusing people of stuff that they didn't even do.
5867222	5873106	You jumped into conclusions, immediately saying, oh, you caused a complaint.
5874227	5875388	You should not do this again.
5875408	5878029	And guess what, you just, they left.
5879630	5880171	Thanks a lot.
5880891	5889177	Okay, and another F goes to one of our former co-workers who quit immediately after some big incident that just occurred.
5889917	5890678	Thanks a lot.
5890978	5894320	The little kid who's 12 years old can no longer move.
5894380	5895261	He is paralyzed.
5895964	5909634	because you didn't watch his ass on the rock climbing it's funny that kids don't know what the hell to do now it's going to cost them, now we're going to get sued and if it goes out of business, where the hell are people going to play DDR now?
5911656	5913497	just think about it, RVL is dead
5915077	5921502	FU to Paradise Island because I tried to go there today to check it out and the state fair is going on.
5921822	5926826	Oh, another FU there for the cars being so fucking expensive, the parking.
5927566	5928827	Six bucks and stuff.
5929668	5930128	Or seven.
5933831	5938094	Well, CCL is somewhat okay, but I don't like the car system.
5938134	5938915	Anyway, sorry to interrupt.
5938935	5939175	Anyway.
5941256	5941657	Anything else?
5943018	5943118	Uh...
5944171	5945652	F you for time going fast.
5945712	5947674	I thought vacation is still like one month.
5948135	5950296	I'm now realizing that school is about to start soon.
5950817	5951537	Starting tomorrow.
5952959	5953979	Actually, I started school last week.
5954020	5954480	Sorry.
5955100	5956662	But still, time goes too fast.
5958804	5960185	I haven't gotten a chance.
5960725	5962307	I have not gotten time for any vacation.
5965549	5966290	F you for birds.
5966770	5968071	More birds shitting in my car.
5970634	5972155	Every time I clean my car, you all shit on it.
5973086	5979371	I should just get a gun, shoot the fuck out of all those birds.
5980171	5980972	Alright, anything else?
5981252	5981813	We gotta move on.
5981853	5982333	That's all.
5982453	5982713	Alright.
5982893	5983794	To be continued.
5983914	5984194	Angel.
5985415	5987817	Alright, uh, whoa, okay, mic's working, yay.
5987917	5989038	Oh wait, this is a good mic, heh.
5989098	5991280	Uh, what was I gonna say?
5991320	5991700	Dang it.
5991800	5996244	Alright, um, F you to, to Accident, because I don't know if I'm gonna get home now.
5996564	5996824	Oops.
5997945	5998826	Um, and...
6000425	6007730	Yeah, that's true, I got an R. Alright, and, oh yeah, FU to school starting, but it's okay because it's school, and maybe I can graduate.
6009331	6011093	And, what was I going to say after this?
6011253	6012213	Oh, I forgot what it was.
6012233	6012814	Oh, well.
6013474	6014635	I forgot what my FU was.
6014735	6016697	Damn it, the really good ones that I needed to say.
6016777	6017217	Oh, well.
6018458	6019338	Oh, yeah, what the hell.
6021457	6023419	All right, let's move on to the chatroom FUs.
6023539	6028904	Gonna keep going here, because I want to get another chance to guess for the clue, because the accent kind of screwed us up, and we're a little bit behind.
6028944	6030105	So let's get to chatroom FUs here.
6030125	6031226	I'm going to pick some good ones here.
6033008	6035971	Esko says, FU to the stupidest group of music fans on the earth.
6037032	6047141	See, now that I work at a rock and roll merchandise place, I see a whole variety of music fans, from the stanky slackers to the frat kids who all buy five feet tall Bob Marley posters, but only a few really get on my nerves.
6047646	6051228	One has the exceptional ability to be racially offensive and moronic all at the same time.
6051268	6052929	That is, of course, the Juggalos.
6053250	6054470	ICP fans, if you didn't know.
6054811	6060114	We recently had a guy called Anybody Killer, who is apparently a member of their running crew, do a signing in our mall.
6060134	6062416	It was like a wave of stupidity engulfed the entire mall.
6062496	6068980	Rich teens speaking ghetto and putting face paint on, attempting to blend into a culture that was originally inspired by the sins of their parents' greed.
6069360	6072102	And they steal our shit and their annoying, um...
6075063	6076845	I don't even know what he's trying to say with that last bit there.
6078146	6078626	Moving on.
6079807	6084912	John Fields says, FU to not having a job, FU to DivX for their weird new compression that's worthless.
6084952	6087975	Videos that used to be 100 megs total are ending up as a gig on 5.2.
6088555	6090057	Where's my downgrade?
6090217	6092199	FU again to Microsoft for releasing XP2.
6092359	6092859	It sucks.
6094160	6094661	Moving on.
6097723	6101227	Karma Titan says, uh...
6106420	6112184	F you to Carmel Mountain Nickel City Arcade ripping off Konami's DDR machines by using Step Mania and charging people on Step Mania.
6114145	6114706	So what?
6115046	6116367	It's fucking better than DDR.
6116727	6117187	Get a load.
6118388	6126474	I mean, unless they're putting shitty-ass step files in there, which I can understand that, but, you know, the Step Mania itself is just another fucking game.
6126614	6127995	Just get used to it, man.
6128015	6131217	At least it's not some Korean knockoff or something like that.
6131690	6134271	These don't have no fucking techno motion shit in there.
6134772	6136092	Or like, you know, I can boogie.
6138734	6139694	Alright, now moving on.
6139774	6142176	Moo says, an F you of your own for Comcast?
6142576	6143497	How could I forget?
6143557	6144857	Thank you, Moo, I agree.
6145338	6147359	A big F you to Comcast.
6148799	6149160	Alright.
6151121	6154943	Unknown Gamer says, a big ol' fuck you to people who don't pay me my goddamn money back.
6155303	6157204	Pay me back, mom, or it's your ass.
6159403	6160163	See, I like that one.
6160183	6160864	That was a funny one.
6161344	6161584	All right.
6162145	6166307	MJB says, My FU of the week goes to my friends for taking my PC and making me go on a Mac.
6166407	6168708	Oh, boo-hoo.
6168889	6173911	Cutress says, FU Orange Lounge for pwning me twice on my first listen on Orange Lounge Radio.
6174172	6175512	Please make sure you hat trick me.
6175853	6177874	I want one more pwnage before the end of the night.
6178074	6178774	We still love you.
6179895	6180515	No, pwn him.
6181536	6184337	And I hate the fact that I'm saying pwn, but he did say PWM.
6185898	6188600	I'll wait till I get to Möbius.
6188732	6189592	Yeah, we still have an hour left.
6190013	6190313	All right.
6190613	6194655	You'll have to come hang out with me at the Aladdin's Castle Ace to work at, at the cyber station.
6195615	6198497	He also says, F you to double amputees who can dance better than me.
6202159	6207641	Misty says, an F you to myself for hurting myself while playing DDR today, but I did end up getting quite a few new double A's.
6208082	6209202	Better yet, F you to school.
6211163	6215425	And Panda says, F you to losing the bid on eBay for about three gigs of RAM.
6216266	6216686	That's a lot.
6218380	6222002	and that's it for the FUs of the week.
6223803	6225184	Oh, Angel remembered her last one.
6225224	6225424	Yes.
6227265	6232048	I need a dial-up because we still have it and I need to get rid of that soon so I'm going to fix it this week.
6232348	6233248	Maybe I can get high speed.
6233349	6233629	Yay.
6234609	6235049	There we go.
6237771	6239512	Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week.
6242734	6243054	Alright.
6243774	6243834	Um...
6245690	6249834	I want to talk about Karaoke Revolution, those big announcements that came out this week.
6249894	6251976	However, we're opening it up.
6252457	6255359	Send me a private message if you have a song guess.
6255439	6256841	We've given you three clues now.
6257201	6261725	If you have a guess as to what the new Ultramix 2 song is, send it in over a private message.
6261745	6264908	And if you're the first one to get it right, you get to announce it to everybody.
6265492	6265772	What?
6265792	6265912	What?
6289032	6292654	You know what, I had to cut and trim some of the FUs tonight, so, sorry.
6293555	6295236	Plus, some folks got them in late, so sorry.
6297378	6303202	Games Are Fun is a website that's reporting that Konami is releasing two new Karaoke Revolution titles.
6303622	6310027	Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 for the PlayStation 2, and Karaoke Revolution for the Xbox.
6310942	6324372	Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 will feature an all-new song list, whereas Karaoke Revolution for the Xbox will mirror the first release on PlayStation 2, with the exception of a handful of new exclusive songs, as well as Xbox Live support.
6325533	6329136	So people can listen to how bad you sing on Xbox Live.
6329236	6331458	I'm very interested in that.
6332338	6334360	That's going to be very interesting.
6334380	6335841	I might have to do that, and I hate singing.
6342012	6344574	It's been yet another week and we still don't have the game!
6344595	6345175	Woohoo!
6348978	6349319	Alright.
6352446	6355308	Okay, let's see, moving on.
6358189	6360471	Okay, here's the song list for Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.
6360871	6361351	Here they are.
6362112	6376199	ABC, Against All Odds, Ain't No Mountain High Enough, Beat It, Burn, California Dreamin', Careless Whisper, China Grove, Come Clean, Don't You Forget About Me, Simple Mind Song,
6380922	6404647	Flashdance, What A Feelin', I love that song, Hold On, I Got You Babe, If I Ain't Got You, In The Midnight Hour, Joy To The World, Killing Me Softly, Leave, Get Out, Love Shack, Meant To Live, My Immortal, New York, New York, Oops I Did It Again, Respect, Shining Star, Someday,
6405390	6418273	Take My Breath Away, Thank You, The Reason, Twist and Shout, Unchained Melody, Under Pressure, When I'm Gone, Why Can't I, and this will be the Liz Phair song, and You're The One That I Want.
6418534	6418954	Very interesting.
6418974	6419814	What do you think about that, Loki?
6421134	6422735	Dude, that's awesome because you know what?
6423095	6428776	That means that Don't You Forget About Me could make it into Extreme 2.
6428836	6429136	Yeah.
6432745	6433546	Yeah, that's awesome.
6434126	6436529	And also, what was it?
6436549	6439211	You're the one I know that would make Nelly happy.
6439231	6441894	That's on the first one.
6441914	6442034	It is?
6442054	6442134	Yeah.
6442154	6442814	Hey, wait a second.
6442834	6444496	That is on the first one.
6446718	6447359	Repeats!
6448760	6449481	Shenanigans!
6449861	6451082	I call shenanigans!
6453324	6456427	Does that mean that the Bimani Police are going to come out and beat Rob with a broom?
6464891	6466791	What do you think about this Karaoke Revolution Vol.
6467011	6466791	3?
6467291	6469332	The franchise expanding some more, it sounds like.
6469352	6470072	What do you guys think about this?
6470512	6472032	I want my Xbox version.
6475073	6477493	I could really sort of care less about the PS2.
6477533	6492576	I mean, not that I could care less about it, but now that there's going to be an Xbox one, I would rather have it on Xbox than PS2, because PS2 games are overall more of a disappointment than the same game on the Xbox.
6497566	6498506	I love my Xbox.
6499646	6500427	My addict box.
6502827	6504927	I newly acquired Thug today.
6505627	6506548	I can't wait to play it.
6507668	6507968	Thug?
6508468	6509308	Tony Hawk Underground.
6509428	6509548	Oh!
6510468	6510748	Cool.
6511329	6511749	I had that.
6511969	6513969	Yeah, I'm renting it and I'm going to copy it.
6514289	6515769	Because I am a copier.
6516429	6517830	I have mine now.
6518390	6519770	My HD loader.
6520390	6521690	HD loader fucking rocks.
6521890	6523851	We have the ESPN football game on it.
6523871	6524831	Dan's been playing that.
6525242	6525722	Yeah.
6526383	6533526	See, Driver 3 is awesome, because, you know, I paid five bucks to get it, and that's all it was worth.
6537688	6543931	And there's no Z. No Z. Can we get Sigurd back in here for the latest clue roundup here, what's going on?
6548933	6550494	We're doing a show here.
6552697	6553058	All right.
6553698	6554460	Hi, everybody.
6554480	6556362	Are you ready to go through the clues?
6556943	6557203	Okay.
6557324	6557864	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6558746	6558986	All right.
6559006	6559346	Here we go.
6560569	6565172	Here we go, let's see, we had Karma Titan submit a guess for Armageddon.
6566472	6566792	No.
6566953	6567213	No.
6567793	6576438	Then we had WhiteRob say Secret Tale from 2DX7Style because of the tattle tales thing, and the fact that each curtain behind Let's Make a Deal had a secret behind it.
6576478	6577758	That's good reasoning, but no.
6577858	6578579	It's a very good reasoning.
6578679	6580940	I'm really, I'm shocked with that reasoning, that was great.
6580980	6587744	Kabut says my guess on the clues is Paranoia Survivor Max because the sound clip played was really fast like the song in the quote talking about tattling,
6588084	6591045	So that might mean paranoia and the curtain thing surprising.
6591445	6591645	No.
6592045	6592185	No.
6592965	6593285	Alright.
6594585	6598086	And then we had MJSI24 say, It's a song called Last Romance.
6598286	6601926	I typed in Let's Make a Deal and Awesome into Google and that was the first hit.
6602466	6602847	No.
6603807	6604107	Alright.
6606327	6607087	I like that one.
6607167	6608107	I'm going to suggest that.
6608347	6610248	And then... Just for the reasoning.
6610448	6612228	Somebody submitted the correct answer.
6612568	6613148	Oh my goodness.
6613168	6617189	So I'm about to call them right here on the air and they're going to announce...
6618021	6619322	What the song is to everybody.
6619342	6621644	So I'm hoping they're picking it up because they actually have Skype on their system board.
6621664	6622524	I seriously can't believe that.
6622544	6624366	So we're going to see if we can get it here.
6625086	6627628	I'm hoping he can pick up, otherwise he's going to have to do the chat room thing.
6628729	6629149	Let's see.
6630310	6631270	I'm hoping it's going through.
6631290	6635353	We're trying to get through.
6635373	6638536	Oh, there he is.
6638596	6638956	It's ringing.
6642418	6643639	Hello, is this Jazz?
6644360	6644720	Hello?
6645040	6645761	Hello, Jazz?
6646361	6646601	Hey.
6646881	6647322	How are you?
6648049	6648509	Pretty good.
6648789	6649089	Good.
6649109	6649950	Hey, guess what?
6649990	6650770	You got the song.
6650990	6651710	What's up?
6651750	6652150	All right.
6652330	6652650	All right.
6652770	6657032	But I have to say, two other people got it as well, but you got it first.
6657052	6657652	You got it first.
6658372	6659292	Who are the runner-ups?
6659612	6660993	All right, quick, tell us what it is.
6662393	6664274	It's called Tittle Tattle by Zonk.
6664374	6665174	That is correct.
6665214	6665494	That's correct.
6665514	6667975	The new song is Tittle Tattle by Zonk.
6668015	6669435	And what was the reasoning behind that?
6670336	6677918	Because I looked it up on Google, and I found that the Losing Things and Let's Make a Deal are called Zonks.
6678240	6678781	Tittle Tattle
6697384	6699565	and then the tattle bit and a zonk.
6699866	6706850	So ApolloChan had that right as well, and Enigma also had it right, saying one, tattle, and then two, the tapping in the song and the name of the band.
6706870	6711994	So ApolloChan had the 100% correct reasoning why, what we were doing, but Jazz, you still got it first.
6712314	6713134	Congratulations.
6714855	6715216	Alright.
6715356	6715916	How do you feel?
6716176	6716737	How do you feel?
6717617	6718758	I wanna go to Disneyland.
6718838	6719418	Good job.
6719678	6721119	You're the smart kid tonight.
6721680	6722060	Yay.
6722300	6722660	Alright.
6722780	6724642	Hey, hey, hey, did you beat Doom 3?
6725979	6728901	No, I'm waiting for someone to come over because I'm scared.
6731122	6733664	Alright, thanks for calling us, Jazz, and congratulations to you.
6734384	6734844	Thank you.
6735045	6736405	Alright, have a good one.
6736966	6737866	Alright, see, that was cool.
6737906	6738787	I like the Skype thing.
6738807	6739327	That was great.
6739747	6741869	Alright, here it is, guys.
6741889	6743069	We're going to play the song for you.
6743129	6748052	Again, as announced by the clues, this was Tiddle was the name of the sound file.
6749313	6750374	And, of course, there was the...
6751272	6752873	Mama don't like tattletales.
6753133	6757556	The tails and then the let's make a deal was a zonk when you lost.
6757936	6763039	So the song is Tittle Tattle and the artist is Zonk.
6763059	6764880	And we're going to play it for you right now.
6764920	6767802	And I got to say, this is a very interesting song.
6767822	6773225	It is not a typical kind of thing I would think about when I think about DDR.
6775907	6777888	So here it is.
6778433	6779376	I'm queuing it up here.
6779476	6783206	The artist is Zonk, and the song is called Tittle Tattle.
6783587	6783828	Enjoy.
6807631	6808816	Thanks for watching!
6855753	6857677	and yet nobody knows.
6858118	6862910	Sanitizing, hallucinations, window licking the imagination.
6885149	6886390	Thanks for watching!
6931893	6933478	Thank you for watching!
6968520	6971849	The Cadence Ladder is a synchronous symphony Tittle, tattle, shake, shake
6979372	6980153	and many more.
7015351	7021212	A new song on Ultramix 2 as revealed by Jazz, who correctly guessed the clues earlier.
7021292	7023453	That was Zonk with Tittle Tattle.
7023493	7024113	What did you guys think of that?
7024133	7025533	It was the first listen for all of us here.
7025553	7026013	What did you think?
7026553	7027333	I liked that song.
7027474	7028914	That song was cool.
7029074	7029894	It was swingy.
7030474	7032995	That was unlike a lot of other DDR songs.
7033015	7036155	I mean, you could say it's kind of like an athletic song that's really stretching it.
7036335	7037196	Really, really stretching it.
7037616	7039276	I think it's very original.
7039356	7040736	I think it's a great ad for DDR.
7042377	7042797	Lanky style.
7043137	7043557	Interesting.
7044337	7044417	It
7045185	7045405	Yeah.
7046286	7046926	Just interesting?
7047087	7049709	It just, the music production on it is just strange.
7049929	7053031	Which is good, because that's kind of the way, you know, Konami Originals are.
7053432	7053752	Strange.
7054032	7054853	So, hey, cool.
7055093	7059957	Now, um, I'm sorry, I just want to add, this is not a long version.
7060077	7063280	We just happen to only have the full cut of the song, not the edit.
7063640	7066643	So, long versions are not coming back to Ultramix 2, as far as we know.
7067383	7069325	Um, let me put that in, in...
7069705	7071806	Better words, they're not coming back at all.
7072066	7072386	Alright.
7073226	7076227	So if you're pining for a long version, go play Fifth Mix.
7076507	7076827	Alright.
7077347	7078447	Well, thank you for clearing that up.
7078807	7080428	I didn't know if you could say one way or the other.
7080448	7082448	But, okay, there you have it.
7082548	7093471	Also, people that listen to that song, if you think it's kind of odd sounding and doesn't really fit DDR or something, Ultramix 2 has a completely new direction than what you'd see on the PS2 releases.
7094071	7094411	So...
7095629	7099973	What do you guys think of that song, the rest of you guys?
7100614	7101815	I thought it was so cool.
7101835	7102436	Angel, don't trip.
7117916	7119037	I really liked that.
7119077	7120118	That was really neat.
7120258	7122379	I can't even, like, compare it to anything else.
7123040	7123861	Like, I really can't.
7124941	7130646	Maybe it's the fact that I haven't really been playing DDR that long, but I really liked it.
7130666	7133488	It was really dancey and jumpy and, yeah.
7134989	7137831	Question for Sigurd, is the tap dancing part staying in?
7139592	7139973	I don't know.
7140053	7141034	That's what somebody asked me.
7141594	7142875	He doesn't even know what the hell that means.
7146455	7159693	I have no clue what you're talking about, but for the most part, the long version of the song is, if you could just cut it in half, you keep all the music styles in it and all the singing, that's what you've got.
7159834	7162918	Think of it as a long version or doubled over from what you just heard.
7163504	7168930	I'm going to be brave and open up the Skype line for feedback on that song or Ultramix 2 in general.
7170271	7172093	So you can give us a call on the Skype line.
7172133	7177739	If you don't know how to call us on the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.org and click on Interact With Us.
7177819	7179241	It's a brand new section on our website.
7179361	7179922	Thank you, Jason.
7180522	7184503	and it talks about how you could call the show if you want.
7185163	7192026	So please do give us a call on the Skype line if you have a comment on the song or, you know, Ultramix 2 in general.
7192466	7196427	And after we field a couple calls, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge in a little bit.
7197427	7203469	We haven't done that for a few weeks now, so we definitely want to let you guys ask a question of any host here, or certainly Sigurd.
7203529	7206430	However, there will be a rule to tonight's Ask Orange Lounge.
7206790	7210411	You may not ask Sigurd anything about Ultramix 2 or DDR Extreme.
7210811	7218553	You can ask him about his sex life, you can ask him about his living... But you cannot ask him anything about Ultramix 2 or Extreme.
7218673	7220114	That's the rule for Ask Orange Lounge tonight.
7221014	7222836	The new DDR will feature ARROWS!
7246206	7249989	We're not getting any calls, so I guess nobody has any feedback on that.
7250009	7253392	The Skype thing is still new, also, as well.
7253532	7260218	A couple weeks back I was on here and I said that, you know, the new song, or one of the new songs has up arrows.
7260778	7267824	Do you know how, like, bad that sent the DDR Extreme US forum into, like, crazy shambles?
7267884	7271327	They thought, like, oh, it has up arrows, let's look for songs that have up arrows!
7271937	7274079	And it was the funniest thing ever.
7275359	7277401	I should say there's ones with left arrows this time.
7277741	7278341	See what happens.
7279502	7283605	Okay, nobody's calling on the Skype line, so I guess we'll close it and we'll open it back up later during Ask Orange Lounge.
7283625	7289709	However, again, you cannot ask him about Ultramix 2 or Extreme.
7289969	7292971	If you do, one of us will answer the question, who knows nothing about the game.
7293432	7296534	And the reason for that is the three-letter word called the...
7297575	7299556	NDA ABC Oh no problem
7320795	7323958	Maybe you'll come back after the games are released and give us some more information.
7323998	7324898	Yeah, I could probably do that.
7324998	7325379	Definitely.
7325439	7326860	So thank you, certainly.
7326880	7328921	But I know you're going to be busy the next couple months.
7329542	7329782	All right.
7331283	7332064	Let's do a break.
7332604	7336187	And then we'll come back and we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge since Skype people didn't want to call.
7336567	7337068	I see how it is.
7337088	7338669	What do you guys want to hear this break?
7338749	7339890	Sigurd, what do you want to hear this break?
7339930	7340730	I'll let you pick a song.
7340750	7342872	If I have it available, I hope.
7344915	7346255	Do you have any athletic songs?
7346315	7347776	Do I have any athletic songs?
7347836	7348536	Of course I do.
7348616	7349997	How about War Game from 8Style?
7350938	7351558	Yeah, Hit and Slap.
7351578	7352478	I want to hear Hit and Slap.
7352498	7354179	I don't know if I have Hit and Slap available.
7354199	7354899	I'll try and find it.
7356340	7357081	Firedub.
7357121	7358381	I think I have Firedub.
7358601	7360942	I will try and find Firedub for you.
7361003	7363884	Disco Dog, because Jamie wants to hear it, which is also athletics.
7364164	7365505	So we'll just make it an athletics break.
7366785	7369026	We'll be back with some Ask Orange Lounge.
7370007	7371408	Start submitting your questions now.
7371488	7371908	We'll be back.
7375332	7376173	Thank you for watching!
7416301	7416762	DarkSakura.com
7458604	7459424	Thanks for watching!
7496733	7497454	New music.
7497754	7504862	Okay, the only way I have this song is with the new music thing over it, because we added it back when it was still new, but just ignore the new music part.
7504982	7505563	It's new!
7505943	7507945	On Orange Lounge Radio.
7508246	7511629	This song's in the newest downloadable pack for DDR Ultramix.
7512050	7514012	This is Athletics with Firedub.
7566218	7583305	I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids I don't want no ice cream love, girl kids
7605339	7607061	Thanks for watching!
7627785	7628808	Thanks for watching!
7670126	7675788	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in Moore's show?
7676088	7683250	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
7683570	7685551	It's unearthly.
7685791	7689532	It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
7690012	7692493	We are back with Orange Lounge Radio.
7693294	7699758	and what we're going to do now is we're going to get into the Ask Orange Lounge section of the show.
7700338	7706001	It's been like three weeks since we've done this, so I know you guys probably have a lot of good questions to ask tonight.
7706081	7711104	And we will open up Skype even for the questions or feedback in general on the show because we're winding down.
7711824	7713385	If anybody wants to use Skype.
7714325	7715106	I think some people do.
7715146	7718608	We got added by a couple people during the break there, so I think some people are learning how to use it.
7719028	7719688	So that's cool.
7720689	7720929	Okay.
7722406	7726049	Here we go guys with Ask Orange Lounge.
7732974	7734215	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
7734795	7735896	Some stupid question.
7736417	7739659	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
7740120	7741801	But I think this week will be interesting.
7742161	7743302	Do you want to know why?
7743782	7748986	Because whenever secret comes, the rest of us don't get any attention.
7750507	7750888	Alright.
7753835	7758621	I remember when you were on this show a year ago and nobody cared.
7758641	7761003	It's because I didn't have insider information.
7761064	7762045	Yeah, you didn't work for Gnomey.
7764223	7766305	I remember you were here for our Max 2 premiere, shall we?
7766325	7767166	Yeah, I was there for that.
7767186	7770989	We were first playing Max 2, and who would have thought that you would have gotten to see the next one before everyone else?
7771009	7773211	It's probably because I like Forever Sunshine so much.
7773972	7776034	All right, let's get to the questions, shall we?
7777015	7781518	Starting it off with a question from... Let's see, we got that one.
7781859	7782980	I know John Fields had a question.
7783280	7785042	Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're going to want to answer this, Sigurd.
7785442	7786002	Question to you.
7786903	7788805	How much money do you make at Konami per year?
7790874	7792916	Yeah, I make a dollar per year.
7796780	7804008	I know, yeah, we... Well, you know, maybe somebody's interested in getting into the profession, but I believe there are contracts that you sign that say you can't disclose what you make, right?
7804028	7806591	Yeah, well, I think that's the same way with every job, pretty much.
7806651	7812798	Unless you're, like, trying to get somebody hired on, then you offer them, you know, this is how much you'll make a year, this is how much you'll make an hour, or whatever, but...
7813643	7821424	It's like either an unwritten rule or a written rule that you don't discuss your earnings at work or of your work.
7822083	7824385	Just keep imagining he's filthy, stinky rich.
7824405	7825846	Yeah, I'm rich.
7826946	7827927	With poorness.
7828988	7832710	MJSI24, I have no idea a quick way to pronounce that name.
7832770	7836713	How long has Sigurd been working at Konami, and how did he get his job?
7838014	7839675	Hoping this does not violate the NDA.
7839755	7844138	So whatever you can say that doesn't violate the NDA, although I believe you addressed this two weeks ago when you were here.
7844668	7846070	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7861420	7862461	Just look on their website.
7862501	7866705	They don't always have openings, but if they have an opening, they will post it.
7867346	7868607	Just check it out there.
7868667	7871329	I opened up the Skype line if anybody wants to contact us there.
7871389	7879096	Remember, please do not call when the Do Not Disturb light is on because that means we're either on another call or we're doing something else during the show and we're not taking your call.
7879977	7882439	We do have a couple questions over here.
7884721	7889765	Karma Titan says, I heard DDR Extreme was the last mix from the DDR series from DDRmaniacs.net.
7889785	7890346	True or false?
7890486	7891647	Actually, I'll answer this one.
7892467	7893708	I'll go ahead and answer this question.
7894549	7898552	It is absolutely... Don't believe anything that you read on that site, right?
7900313	7900754	I'm just kidding.
7900854	7904396	Do you want to try this one?
7904557	7905457	Yeah, I can do this one.
7906638	7909100	Don't listen to internet rumors or anything like that.
7909700	7912963	If there is going to be another one, just check Konami's site.
7914578	7916699	or Orange Lounge Radio.
7917079	7921222	This is from a site that just announced, hey, DDR Festival Mix is coming out.
7922742	7923503	Um, wait a second.
7923583	7924083	No, no, no.
7924103	7925624	Konami USA.
7925664	7926504	Not Japan.
7926544	7927245	Japan's weird.
7927685	7929886	Oh, yeah, because they're making money now.
7930066	7932067	Oh, stop, stop.
7932367	7933328	Where are they, Nickelodeon?
7933528	7934889	Let me answer the call we just took.
7934929	7936129	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7937030	7939551	Hi, um... Excuse me.
7941832	7942553	Yeah, um...
7944383	7945284	Are you laughing at me?
7945744	7946465	Yes, I am.
7946665	7947285	No, I'm just teasing.
7947325	7947626	What's up?
7949948	7951008	Yeah, why'd you ban me?
7952450	7953470	Oh, oh.
7953891	7955953	It's people that can't get over themselves.
7956593	7956813	Oh.
7960636	7961317	Oh, God.
7964039	7969083	I'm going to make one comment, and one comment only, although it might be a little bit at length.
7970404	7971005	Get over it!
7971625	7972146	You suck!
7974124	7974865	Get a real life!
7975145	7977867	Nobody cares about your little drama, so get over it!
7979789	7981350	That has been a public service announcement.
7981610	7983272	I'm sorry, wait a minute, I'm sorry, let me turn it one more time.
7986575	7995923	You must be really bored, have no life and no friends, if you're obsessing over being banned a year and a half ago!
7998084	7998665	Get over it!
8001076	8002440	Go bug somebody else.
8002540	8006188	Aren't you like a moderator on some unknown crappy Bimani site somewhere?
8006248	8010177	Actually, not quite an unknown site, but yeah.
8010589	8016011	Okay, if you have to have something to validate yourself, why not try the internet like everybody else does?
8016231	8019351	Alright, that 60 seconds spent too much on that topic.
8019411	8020052	Let's move on.
8020112	8023153	I'm going to reopen our newly filtered Skype line.
8026493	8029694	And see if anybody else who we care about has a question to ask.
8030795	8032455	Oh, Panda has a question for Loki, though.
8033495	8035576	Loki, do we have an update on your portal?
8038126	8038766	Shut up!
8039587	8040727	I told you, I got the germanium.
8041128	8049251	So I just need the... I just need, uh, magnet wire and... some, like, miscellaneous copper and crap.
8049832	8051413	It's just mainly, it's just magnet wire.
8051733	8052753	That's pretty much all that's left.
8053053	8053794	And dead people.
8054674	8055134	Now and now.
8055595	8057135	Next week will be interesting.
8057195	8058396	Let me just put it that way.
8059276	8061357	Next week will be very interesting.
8064039	8064299	Anyways.
8065019	8065759	Yeah.
8065780	8066640	He's gonna summon Jesus.
8068109	8069430	You can't summon Jesus!
8070150	8071211	That's a pretty cool trick, though.
8073092	8075034	Next week will be interesting.
8075254	8076575	That's all I have to say.
8078656	8083580	Alright, let's take another call and hopefully this... Turn down your Winamp!
8084120	8087362	Alright.
8088103	8088663	Who is this?
8089124	8089724	Turn down the Winamp!
8090400	8093682	I guess this is for Sigurd Does Konami read their message boards?
8117470	8122312	Um, no, of course not, because, you know, um, they're not, like, on DDR Freak or anything.
8122592	8123092	No.
8124833	8129475	Uh, really quick, um, really quickly.
8129575	8130875	Hold on, caller, we'll get to you in a minute.
8132236	8140299	Oh, um, yeah, they read their message boards, obviously, because, like, like Loki said, duh, pretty much.
8141099	8143660	Alright, caller, uh, hi, welcome to Orange Zones Radio, what's up?
8144389	8161078	Yeah, on DDR Maniacs, I also heard that the artist Naoki from the DDR series, what is it, I heard that everyone, all the artists like Revan G or Omega and all that, are Naoki.
8161098	8163439	So are they all the same, true or false?
8164820	8172824	Well, if you'll pick up a copy of DDR Max and read that instruction manual, you can see all of Naoki's handles, and there's about 20 of them, at least.
8175677	8175977	Okay?
8179539	8179820	Okay.
8180440	8181741	I guess that was a nod of acceptance.
8181781	8182101	I don't know.
8182161	8182861	Thanks for the call!
8184502	8184843	Alright.
8185643	8187344	He was listening to his radio.
8188024	8192447	First rule in radio, never listen to your radio on the phone call.
8192507	8193728	He said it wouldn't work otherwise.
8193788	8194108	I don't know.
8194368	8195249	That's stupid.
8195749	8196129	I don't know.
8196209	8196630	We'll see.
8197410	8201152	He probably had one of those non-duplex sound cards.
8201393	8203174	Oh, you know what?
8203194	8203654	That might do it.
8203694	8203974	I don't know.
8209193	8209553	All right.
8209853	8210974	No, I'm talking about Moto.
8210994	8212674	Nygma had another question I want to get to.
8213535	8217576	Are any of you or people you know going to the tournament in New York in October?
8217696	8221877	Well, seeing as we're on the West Coast, not really likely any of us are flying out there.
8221917	8222077	No.
8222218	8223218	Buy us a plane ticket.
8223278	8224798	We will gladly make a cameo.
8225859	8228000	Nobody here has any travel plans to New York in October?
8228240	8230400	I'm going at the end of September, but there's no tournament.
8230500	8231501	I might go to eight on the break, though.
8231521	8234702	Yeah, I might be going to New York in September to blow up another building.
8235022	8235502	Stop it.
8236182	8236763	Not funny.
8237383	8237923	Stop it.
8240049	8241431	It's for my birthday!
8241531	8242192	Come on!
8243734	8244556	It worked one year.
8244576	8245176	It's horrible.
8246518	8246899	Alright.
8251906	8254028	Thank you for watching!
8272222	8274723	I'm really sad we didn't get to do that last clue, Sigurd.
8274743	8276624	We actually had one more clue we were going to do.
8276984	8277404	Do you want to hear?
8277784	8278585	We want to still do it?
8279185	8279425	Okay.
8280025	8282807	Let's do that last clue we were going to do, alright?
8283087	8287469	This was the last clue you were going to hear if you didn't get it, even though Irene's not paying attention and the clue involves her.
8287909	8295892	But, uh, Sigurd... Oh, Sigurd was actually going to let me have the fourth clue, because he didn't want to say this, but this was the fourth clue.
8296433	8299374	Irene, I just want to say that you have really nice tits.
8301263	8302624	It's too bad they're kind of little.
8303965	8306347	In fact, you might call them tittles.
8309129	8310110	That was the fourth clue.
8311111	8312452	That was so awful.
8313833	8316615	That was the clue that Sigurd and I came up with earlier.
8316895	8317375	I got one.
8317435	8317776	Hold on.
8317796	8318576	I got a fifth clue.
8319737	8321178	Rob, you have a nice dick.
8321619	8322940	Too bad it's a little little.
8323840	8325441	You might call it dickle.
8326762	8327183	Dickle.
8330263	8330743	Oh, God.
8332143	8332884	No, I'm just kidding.
8332984	8334164	Rice Princess has huge boobs.
8335224	8336084	Don't believe the rumors.
8336544	8336904	All right.
8337884	8338584	The rumors?
8338665	8338885	What?
8340065	8341085	I haven't started any rumors.
8342445	8346346	Uh, Kabut says... That's the name.
8346426	8347106	It's Kabut.
8347946	8349366	Instead of Kaboom, it's Kabut.
8352407	8355627	I've said the name, like, twice already in the show because he sent other questions.
8355687	8358748	Kabut wants to know, how big is your e-penis?
8361007	8361747	Anybody want to answer?
8361807	8363148	I think Jamie should answer this one.
8363728	8365829	DarkSakura, how big is your e-penis?
8369590	8370231	Very large.
8372411	8374092	How big is your e-penis, DarkSakura?
8376033	8380355	She's holding up her hands about four feet.
8381235	8382876	She's hung like an e-horse.
8385517	8385857	Alright.
8387237	8387797	Very lovely.
8388358	8389018	Nygma has a
8391300	8392280	I like this question.
8393181	8395621	Nygma says, does Orange Lounge have t-shirts?
8396402	8398942	Not yet, but we are definitely looking into it.
8399022	8401183	We want to sell t-shirts and hopefully make some money.
8401543	8402604	So not yet, Nygma.
8402624	8403844	We do not have an official shirt.
8404164	8405204	We will very soon.
8405224	8408465	Does Orange Lounge Radio have any internet sex tapes?
8409706	8409866	No.
8412847	8413667	Last question.
8414087	8420229	Karma Titan says, how come last week, my first time on Orange Lounge Radio, how come the place looks different?
8421091	8424334	Um, didn't we have the big spider web on the camera last week?
8424374	8425254	That might be one thing.
8425755	8426735	Yeah, I'm not sure.
8426775	8428497	I think it's just because we have different people here.
8428597	8433280	The lighting might be a little different, but we... I turned the camera slightly to the left.
8433600	8433861	Oh, okay.
8433901	8434381	I guess that's it.
8434421	8435842	He turned the camera slightly to the left.
8436915	8438876	and there's more crap on the table.
8439757	8441078	Oh, John Fields has a good question.
8441458	8442519	I'll take this as the last question.
8442919	8448482	Does Orange House Radio have any... And there's Peach Girl posters on the wall, thanks to Nelly.
8448602	8449823	Oh, maybe that's what it is.
8449843	8451784	She hung up the porno posters on the wall.
8453165	8454066	Maybe that's what it is.
8454126	8454966	I thought something's different.
8455347	8455607	Alright.
8458289	8459209	Last question for John Fields.
8459229	8464172	Do we have any plans to put old episodes in MP3 on CD for sale at some point in the future?
8464553	8465113	And actually...
8466670	8474295	Well, at the Classic Gaming Show, there was another radio station that has to do with retro gaming that was selling copies of their show on DVD.
8474976	8490726	The only gray area with our show is that we actually play not only Bomani music, but thanks to our cage match, which granted wasn't in the first 20 episodes, but has been there for the majority of our show, the cage match has other real music, so we can't really turn around and sell that music.
8491327	8494769	We could go through and edit it all out, but that would be kind of a pain in the ass.
8495229	8495569	I don't know.
8496030	8498071	So we'll just kind of have to see what happens.
8499232	8502974	I don't think we can feasibly do it, but I don't know.
8503074	8507036	As far as distribution plans for getting the old episodes out there, we'll have to just see in the future.
8508077	8508397	We'll see.
8508917	8509218	All right.
8510358	8519464	Also, Angel is the official historian of Orange Lingerie and has them all on MP3, except I would like to point out that this week I forgot to start archiving until about 45 minutes into the show.
8520805	8526348	So on Thursday during the new Orange Lounge Radio Rewind at 6, you're only going to get part of the show, and that's my bad.
8526549	8526789	Sorry.
8527569	8528169	Bad, Rob.
8528310	8528650	Bad.
8530111	8533953	No, no one is going to ask me for copies.
8534413	8535114	No, they're mine.
8536675	8537195	I'm not funny.
8538336	8538616	Alright.
8539476	8543499	I guess now it's time to kind of wrap up the show, you guys.
8543959	8544339	That's it.
8544379	8546380	Thank you for asking the questions on Ask Orange Lounge.
8546440	8546821	It is 9.30.
8547601	8548782	Time to wrap up the show.
8549372	8552253	Go around and get everybody's final thought.
8552534	8557716	We're going to start off tonight's final thought from... Hand the microphone to somebody, Jimmy.
8558816	8560177	Oh, who has the second mic?
8562418	8563639	Oh, sorry, Loki.
8564679	8566060	Hand that microphone to somebody else.
8569101	8570302	Say something, somebody.
8574744	8575584	Jonas, your final thought.
8576405	8576965	I have none.
8578613	8584437	LankyStyle, your final thought.
8586018	8587338	LankyStyle, final thought.
8588039	8589620	My neck, my back.
8596804	8598705	Pass off to somebody else, have them give us their final thought.
8602548	8603988	RicePrincess, your final thought.
8606670	8608031	I'm going to miss Seegers.
8609424	8609764	Aw.
8612066	8612386	Alright.
8616268	8617109	Well, Angel.
8618910	8619530	Crash.
8620171	8622232	And everyone knows what I'm talking about.
8622892	8625454	Not that it's a big deal, because I think we can all go home now.
8626955	8627295	Yeah.
8628216	8628596	That's it.
8631337	8632838	Sigurd, your final thought.
8635080	8636901	I hope my iPod is done charging.
8641534	8642815	and Loki, your final thought.
8642835	8645758	Where's the microphone?
8646279	8647299	Oh, that's my final thought.
8647340	8648300	Where's the microphone?
8651383	8663374	And my final thought is tune in to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday and Diversion on Monday and who knows what on Wednesday and the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind on Thursday and all the good stuff in between.
8663655	8667298	The fun just doesn't end here on Orange Lounge Radio Live, that's for sure.
8667950	8668791	Jamie, your final thought.
8669551	8675675	Tuesday is Pump Up the Volume with the pre-show starting at 7 o'clock, although it did start a little bit earlier.
8676176	8682540	On that day, I will be playing the CD of 8-Bit Warriors and also the U.S.
8682580	8684561	Silent Hill 4 soundtrack in its entirety.
8685542	8687704	So make sure you're listening.
8688564	8690225	It will be Q. All right.
8690726	8694588	The final word of the show, one word to sum up the whole show.
8694949	8695269	I guess...
8697187	8698048	Yeah, Rice Princess.
8698068	8698990	We're going to give our Rice Princess.
8699010	8700292	She didn't talk a whole lot this show.
8700713	8703799	Rice Princess, the final word of the show is... Meow.

8738707	8742690	Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American dream.
8743451	8743931	About me.
8744792	8745432	About you.
8746473	8751036	About the way our American hearts beat way down in the bottom of our chests.
8751437	8754279	About that special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts.
8754859	8755900	Maybe below the cockles.
8756340	8757761	Maybe in the sub-cockle area.
8758482	8759483	Maybe in the liver.
8759943	8760944	Maybe in the kidneys.
8761704	8790707	Maybe even in the colon, we don't know I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job I'm your average white suburbanite slob I like football and porno and books about war I got an average house with a nice hardwood floor My wife and my job, my kids and my car My feet on my table
8791521	8793229	and a Cuban Cigar
8796835	8819890	But sometimes that just ain't enough to keep a man like me interested Oh no, no way, no I've gotta go out and have fun at someone else's expense Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I drive really slow in the ultra-fast lane While people behind me are going insane
8830276	8839338	I use public toilets and I piss on the seat I walk around in the summertime saying how about this heat Sometimes I bark
8848940	8861464	In Handicapped Spaces While Handicapped People Make Handicapped Faces Maybe I shouldn't be singing this song Ranting and raving and carrying on Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong
8879960	8881181	You know what I'm gonna do?
8881201	8883342	I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac Eldorado convertible.
8883382	8887404	Hot pink with a whale skin, hubcaps, and all leather cow interior and big brown baby seal eyes for headlights.
8887444	8887524	Yeah!
8887544	8890605	And I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115 miles per hour, getting one mile per gallon.
8906553	8907313	Thank you for watching!
8925558	8926278	Thanks for watching!
8945183	8947626	You know, you really are an asshole.
8947646	8949328	Why don't you just shut up and sing this song, pal?
8949388	8950068	I'm an asshole!
8950129	8950709	I'm an asshole!
8967307	8970468	I'm an asshole, and I'm proud of it.
8996027	8999708	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
9025311	9027532	Thank you for watching!
9053470	9060172	Alright, the afterbirth, the part of the show when the credits have faded to black and you think it's over, but it's really not.
9061032	9065193	We have to keep it kind of short tonight, though, because I've got to get on the road.
9066973	9070134	But, I don't know, anybody had anything they wanted to say here in this afterbirth?
9071254	9072335	I'm going to go fold my laundry.
9073495	9074115	Sounds like fun.
9075655	9079536	And then, anything else you wanted to add, Sigurd?
9080057	9081777	Anything off the record in the afterbirth of the show?
9082938	9083378	Not really.
9084319	9085019	I figured as much.
9085659	9086439	I'm kind of tired.
9087140	9088120	We're all exhausted.
9089241	9089861	We're spent.
9091141	9095763	I guess I could open up Skype and see if anybody has anything they want to say during this afterbirth.
9095803	9098924	I hope you guys enjoyed the premiere and all that fun stuff tonight.
9099425	9100705	It's fun getting to do stuff like that.
9100725	9101545	I hope we get to do more.
9103526	9104447	We'll soon see.
9104867	9110269	I do hear that there is some good stuff coming up for the show, but I can't talk about it or they might send the mob after me.
9110769	9112630	So that's all I'm going to say for right now.
9113462	9113842	Yep, yep.
9115563	9117063	I enjoy talking to myself on air.
9117083	9117744	Isn't it exciting?
9120525	9125246	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
9126267	9127227	I don't know what the hell that was.
9129368	9131228	She has a binder clip.
9132189	9132589	Yeah.
9136370	9138131	No, I'm not singing the man's song.
9143283	9143603	Alright.
9144103	9145364	There we go, Jamie's singing it.
9145384	9147464	Somebody was singing, was Jamie singing it in the back?
9147504	9149224	Now you're a man, man, man, man.
9150265	9152145	No must be the day it is.
9152685	9154686	That needs to be in Karaoke Revolution.
9154706	9156146	Oh yeah, that needs to be in Karaoke Revolution.
9156166	9157946	It's not going to be in Karaoke Revolution.
9158047	9159207	Along with Murmur Twins.
9161967	9163848	Alright, that's it, forget it.
9165848	9166488	We're spent.
9167429	9168329	And we're spent.
9169029	9171270	Oh, I'm going to give head to one of Loki's joysticks.
9171850	9172310	Oh, you should.
9172470	9172810	You should.
9174830	9178172	Alright, for the post-show tonight, you get a Bimani Potpourri.
9178232	9180854	It's a little bit of everything, commercial-free.
9181355	9188359	Enjoy, have a great night, thank you for tuning in, and we will see you again real soon, we hope.
9188499	9188840	Good night.

12750475	12751755	You bastard!
12751775	12757597	You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.
12757777	12763658	I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough whopper.
