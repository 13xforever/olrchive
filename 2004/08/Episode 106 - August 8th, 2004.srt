2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,800
And now, for our feature presentation...

3
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani, and then some.

5
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,800
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

7
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
demons from hell!

8
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

9
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good feels dumb.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Fact, drunken, stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,800
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

12
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

13
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritionist practice.

14
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,800
That was huge. Cool.

15
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

16
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Have you seen Malcolm? Lena?

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,440

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,440
to August the 8th of 2004. We are the internet talk radio program dedicated to all things

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,120
Vamani and then some. And with me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Happiest Bunny on the Farm. Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers. You know her better, Star Sacra?

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,200
Yay. Hooray for me. Hooray for you. Hooray for me. I'm, I'm, and hooray for me. You put

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,640
my meat on the cab. You poured out my meat. Yes, I did. I put your meat on our brand new

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,640
new web cam available at www www.orangeloungeradio.com is our web cam address. Also with us tonight

30
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,440
say hello to our tech master Loki. She's like Dr. Claw but instead of the arm it's a foot.

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,440
But it's not the quads, it's just a hand. It just can't be Dr. Hand, because that's just stupid.

32
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Also with us tonight, we have very few special guests here, but they're plentiful in the talent they have to bring.

33
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,440
We have somebody who has never been on the show before, and to be honest, I don't even know him that well.

34
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,440
But I think he's hilarious in what I've seen of him at our local arcade. Say hello to Andrew.

35
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,880
yes yeah what's going on i don't know if you play by your online real life

36
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,300
andrew ryan andrew is also well-known for what at that was locally here rosal

37
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:17,300
i'd just love to have a higher

38
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,160
are he's a pirate

39
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,900
how ironic i act like a pirate online

40
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,260
he dressed up as one

41
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,920
you act like one of these at work

42
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,280
All right, also with us tonight, we have somebody who frequents the show quite a bit.

43
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,440
You recognize her from our chat room, I'm sure, if you hang out there.

44
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,360
Say hello to PDR Angel.

45
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,720
Hello!

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,520
How you doing today?

47
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,080
Pretty good.

48
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,720
No, I noticed we're wearing, like, matching shirts tonight.

49
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
No, what the hell was that? I wasn't even playing that.

50
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,560
They're not technically twin shirts.

51
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,280
They're clothes.

52
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,920
They're clothes.

53
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,200
We've got, she's got the one with the little piranha plant from Super Mario Bros. that says,

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,680
bite me.

55
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Charar.

56
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
And then I have the goomba that says, you lose.

57
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,120
So it's like we're twins.

58
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,760
We'll go post on the webcam again real fast during the break.

59
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,400
All right.

60
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,360
also with us tonight we have another very special guest

61
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,640
he's somebody that has actually been on the show before

62
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,640
and he's our buddy from my Kansas who now lives here in California

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,000
it's our buddy Shane also known as Miklatos

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,200
and if I'm not mistaken

65
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,320
you have a new name now that you go by as well yes?

66
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,720
yeah if you've been on the DDR Free Chords

67
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,640
I would be the new Vivid member Seagurd

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,520
so I'm the one causing you guys pain I definitely have a lot of questions for

69
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,320
Seagurd when we get back from the break oh yeah tonight I guess maybe you guys

70
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,720
heard about this we do have a little something there's a little song out

71
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,600
there I think some of you guys are wanting to hear tonight that's all for

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,960
right now but it is your rain from brand new DDR extreme and we'll be playing

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
that a little bit later in the show, but hell, while we have a captive audience, let's do

74
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,600
our normal antics, why don't we, huh?

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Why not?

76
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Why not?

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Because we love our listeners.

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
It's a three-hour show.

79
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Let's wait till 2.59.

80
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
What do you think?

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
That works for me.

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
The song's only like a minute long.

83
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
All right.

84
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,760
No, we'll get to it somewhere after.

85
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Eventually.

86
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,520
We definitely have to do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day first, though, because that's

87
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
when we start every show.

88
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Of course.

89
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,560
But first, we're going to take a break, and in this break, we're going to hear the original

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,520
Akira Yomoka, Your Rain, from Silent Hill 4.

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,820
That song is just so hot.

92
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,320
Because the song rocked before they remixed it.

93
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,820
So I'm going to play it now.

94
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,320
Quite literally, because it is rock.

95
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,120
It is rock.

96
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,820
It is rock.

97
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
So enjoy.

98
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,120
How perceptive.

99
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,420
Yes, enjoy this, and then we will be back to play a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

100
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,020
Also tonight, boys and girls, Match Game.

101
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,120
And to play Match Game tonight, you're going to want to be on Skype.

102
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,320
Skype.org to download the client, and then you can talk to us live in the studio, and that's also available.

103
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,520
So here it is.

104
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,720
We'll be playing a remix of it tonight.

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
But here's the original from Silent Hill 4, Kiryamoka, your reign. Enjoy.

106
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Alone again, again

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,720
The rain falling on your scent

108
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
I will, I will

109
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Remind you to dance with me

110
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Nobody's showing me

111
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
How to return my love

112
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,720
You give to me, I'm gonna hold me

113
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,720
That love's a strange old name

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:07,720
I'll never learn that you'll ever bring me down

115
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:17,720
All that I need are some simple love and love

116
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:25,720
You've touched me by once, it hurts

117
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Stay with me softly, never forget

118
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Never again will be

119
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
I cry

120
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Out of my head

121
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,720
And I don't know what I've found

122
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Over and over

123
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,720
The fear that breaks me down

124
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
I'm the devil, I'm the city

125
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm a beast of the wind

126
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I see the people goin' nowhere

127
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,720
See me strokein' our heads

128
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Tell me passion doesn't matter

129
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
My resistance is waning

130
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,720
The flower in the basement

131
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Wait for our love today

132
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I want you out of my head

133
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,720
And I don't know what I've found

134
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Over and over

135
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,720
I feel it break me down

136
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm a sidewalk

137
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
I'm a city

138
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm a tree

139
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Just a river

140
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
There's a people

141
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Going nowhere

142
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
See me talking low range

143
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm a Russian

144
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm a man

145
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
My resistance is waning

146
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Like a flower in the basement

147
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Wait for our lonely death

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:36,920
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

149
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:46,400
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

150
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,120
We are back and you are listening to Orange Lawns Radio episode number 106 and if you

151
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,660
are listening to the stream right now consider yourself lucky because of that little song

152
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,640
that we have we're going to play a little later for you guys.

153
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,080
This tonight's show got hoarded out on a lot of different sites and because of that we

154
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,560
have hit what is called the cap, the live 365 listening cap.

155
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,520
We're only allowed so many listeners and we never in our imaginations thought we would

156
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,680
ever hit that limit but we hit it tonight like before the show even started.

157
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,320
So if you're in, you got lucky, don't disconnect or somebody's going to snag your spot and

158
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,980
then you're going to have to be what's called a preferred member to get back in.

159
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,240
That's out of our control, guys.

160
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Sorry.

161
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
You've done wonders for our egos.

162
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Yes.

163
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
I feel great right now, actually.

164
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
I'm like, ha, ha, ha.

165
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,400
We've got a bunch of listeners on stream.

166
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,600
We're just a popular show.

167
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,540
And then I remember, oh yeah, we got that song.

168
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,540
We're kind of lucky.

169
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,120
So it's all right.

170
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,360
Well, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lawns Radio, which it might be for

171
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
some of you, welcome and welcome to the show.

172
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,160
We are a 3 hour talk program dedicated to Bamani and video gaming because you know what?

173
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,880
We sat around here for 3 hours and talked about nothing but DDR and 2DX.

174
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
We tried.

175
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
We have tried.

176
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
We have literally tried.

177
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,240
But if we sat here and we talked about DDR and 2DX for 3 hours straight, we would be

178
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,160
like the biggest dorks ever.

179
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,080
I mean we're pretty dorky to begin with to even have this show in the first place.

180
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,680
But to talk about nothing but DDR for like 3 hours?

181
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,740
Come on, you couldn't pay me enough.

182
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
There's other things out there.

183
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
You gotta go outside once in a while.

184
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Get a job, get a girlfriend or girlfriend.

185
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Remember, sunlight helps your body make vitamin D.

186
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Exactly.

187
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
Which you need to play DDR.

188
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Exactly.

189
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
Because without it you'll die.

190
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,740
But no, we do, when all is said and done, we make a lot of fun at DDR on this show.

191
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
We really do.

192
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
But we're poking fun at ourselves when we poke fun at DDR.

193
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
Because really we do have a lot of love for DDR.

194
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,740
I would never have met Jamie, I would never have met Loki if it wasn't for DDR, 2DX, and that stuff.

195
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
I would never have met anybody here if it wasn't for that.

196
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
And for that we're thankful.

197
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,840
thankful and so we kind of always say you know what it's kind of like what

198
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,360
happens when DDR gets taken outside the arcade that's what happens with this

199
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,020
show this is DDR outside of the arcade so this is just everybody sitting around

200
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,340
having a good time so you think I sum that up pretty good Jamie I think so yeah

201
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,280
all right why do you why do you do this show Jamie I ain't got nothing else to

202
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:02,920
do yeah good answer seriously it's because um cuz well it's just fun you

203
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,020
know we all get together it's like it's like family time you know because how

204
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,180
many people just get around and have quality time yeah and then I get my

205
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,700
little segment where I get to fuss and complain exactly we'll get to that later

206
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,500
and I enjoy everybody's company and you know what the fun doesn't stop just here

207
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
because we actually do live shows throughout the week including Jamie you

208
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
got your own show I have one called pump up the volume named after the movie

209
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,520
Because that movie was awesome and had Christians later. Mm-hmm

210
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,220
But anyway, it's just a music request show. I play whatever I was supposed to do an 80s marathon

211
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,960
Last week and I like sort of got bored with that and just played whatever Cena has nothing to do with DDR

212
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,820
But it's still cool

213
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,560
But every so often I will get a mad fit and just play nothing but Bimani just because I feel like it

214
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,200
But the show is on Tuesdays pre show starts at 7 the normal show is 730 to 1030

215
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,060
30 although as of late I've just been you know really bored and starting to

216
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,820
show a little bit earlier and extending it a little bit to 1230 range so just

217
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,500
tune in and listen as long as you can all right sounds good also on this

218
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,980
station Monday night tomorrow night seven o'clock diversion which is our

219
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,660
name for the orange lounge radio remix show and that's where we play all these

220
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,180
different Bahmani remixes fan-made ones like things that were picked up in

221
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,160
tournaments and stuff like that all the way to like remixes done so well their

222
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,280
professional quality and that would be like the diverse systems albums we play

223
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,480
that stuff on the show really good Bahmani remix stuff and you know we're

224
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,200
gonna be adding to the playlist this week because there was a new remix thing

225
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,280
that just came out but we'll talk about that later in the show definitely so

226
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,560
it's out later in the show meanwhile we have to start off tonight's show the way

227
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,600
we always start off the show because it's tradition and that's a little

228
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,600
We call. How was your week? How was your day? You want to say something real fast, Loki?

229
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
No.

230
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,600
He's looking antsy and he has a Happy Noodle Boy shirt, which is cool.

231
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Why do you do this show, Loki?

232
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Because I'm here.

233
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
I don't know why.

234
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Because you sat on the floor for all of those months.

235
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I could be getting in three hours of quality Final Fantasy XI time right now.

236
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,600
And look at this. Now who is sitting on the floor? Who are we forcing to sit on the floor?

237
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
The guy that works at Konami. We're making sit on the floor today.

238
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,360
sit there and pet Loki's cock. It's okay, he has company, he has my cock in his hand,

239
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,280
so that's alright. Would you put your cock on our webcam there? If you go to our webcam,

240
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,000
www.orangelandradio.com, it's right there on the front page. Loki's gonna show off his

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,680
cock to all you guys, so you know what we're talking about. Alright. Anyway. And then you

242
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,400
better put that thing away. Yeah, you should put that thing away before it scares somebody.

243
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,000
How was your week, how was your day? We're gonna start off with the lovely lady who always

244
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
starts it off, my co-host, Dark Sakura.

245
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
My week sucked ass.

246
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Okay.

247
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,240
Well, my week was okay, except my alarm clock completely died, and I made it to work on

248
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,600
time Wednesday, but on Thursday, see, I was supposed to be at work at 7.30, okay, you

249
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,320
know what time I got out of bed?

250
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Quarter after 8.

251
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,560
My ass was there at 9 o'clock, and you know what, I didn't get written out, so it's cool.

252
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,400
And I just worked an extra 30 minutes, and it was all good, so I got some extra sleep

253
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,120
that day, but I was still tired all day. I finished one of my fanfics today. I finally

254
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:28,400
completed it. It's on fanfiction.net, somewhere. What kind of fanfic? I write fanfiction. You

255
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,140
don't want to tell us what kind? I write G.I. Joe fanfiction. A real American hero. Yes.

256
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,320
That's right. I'm also working on other stories, though. I'm actually working on a novel, which

257
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,440
is sort of on hold, because guess what? I'm not going to have free time anymore. I got

258
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,060
my award letter from ARC, which made me all bouncy, and they still haven't freakin' put

259
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,580
my money on the stupid website, so I can't get my student loan yet, but, uh, this is

260
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,940
okay, because in a couple weeks I'm gonna have a laptop. That'll make it all better.

261
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,540
Now, ARC, that's the local college here in SAC where you're-

262
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,040
American River College. Yee-haw.

263
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,920
They actually have a DDR machine there at the, um, cafeteria.

264
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
I'm just- I'm gonna go reference-

265
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Are you ever gonna touch that thing, you think?

266
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,280
I might, but I don't want to get cooties.

267
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,280
My plan was to go run track

268
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,140
on Monday and Wednesday, because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.

269
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,280
But I think after my Saturday class I might go play some DDR.

270
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Anything else you want to say about your weekend today?

271
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,760
I had some angst.

272
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,100
I had a good bit of angst.

273
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Very few times. We've done this, what, 106 weeks now? I think maybe two times you came in here not angsty about something.

274
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Okay, this isn't angry angst, okay?

275
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Okay, this is real angst.

276
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:52,100
This is, like, on the level of... it's of the same intensity as teenage high school drama angst. Which is pretty intense.

277
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Is it my fault?

278
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
No.

279
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Oh, that's good then.

280
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
If it was your fault, I'd tell you. I'd be like, nah, listen up, bitch.

281
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Alright, good.

282
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:11,600
But that was, yeah. Oh, and yesterday, I hung out with Iguana Girl and Tia, and we turned her hair from nearly jet black to bright red.

283
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,100
Is this like a girls bonding kind of thing?

284
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Girls bonding thing over low carb ice cream. And I did something stupid. Low carb ice cream is damn good. It's made with whole cream. I did something stupid. Look at this.

285
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Hey, I like your hair, though. I like it like that.

286
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I dyed my bangs blonde.

287
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
I wish you weren't camshies, you could show the other ones.

288
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,100
They had to bleach out Tia's hair to turn it red.

289
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
So I was like, hey, bleach my bangs, that'll be fun.

290
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Except the bleach was running out of activation power.

291
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:52,100
So only one side took the bleach very well and the other one's a lot lighter.

292
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
I mean, it looks okay.

293
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Except I forgot that since I had dyed my hair black before, the ends are still dark.

294
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,500
I guess I could get on the- this is the only time you're gonna get me on the cam, okay?

295
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Okay, alright.

296
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
So...

297
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I got it.

298
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
So...

299
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Pass off the microphone to somebody.

300
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,540
Alright, well we'll go to somebody else while Jamie poses on cam with a hair.

301
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,540
Uh, Angel.

302
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Angel, how was your week?

303
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,540
How was your day?

304
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Uh, pretty good.

305
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,860
Um, I'm still kind of adapting to, uh, certain things, if you want to talk about that.

306
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,700
Cause, uh, nobody really knows.

307
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,100
I mean, they kind of know, but they don't.

308
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,940
if you want to

309
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,660
talk about that for a bit. I don't know. Do you?

310
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,140
Rob? Well sure, sure, go ahead.

311
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm sorry, I was reading some other stuff going on.

312
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,740
Yeah. I'm having a laugh at some other stuff that I'm reading.

313
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,860
Hi Chat Room! Please type!

314
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,340
Okay, anyway.

315
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,380
Oh, yeah. That's all good. Anyway.

316
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,900
Alright, so about three weeks ago I

317
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,140
moved out

318
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:00,100
first time in my life, so I live here now. And that's still very strange for me to say,

319
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,820
but I assume I will get used to it as time goes on. So, I don't know, that's about it

320
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:18,220
I guess. I work here and duh. But it's cool. And I live with Magus. Everybody hide. Yeah,

321
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,100
the bad jokes go on and on and on and on.

322
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,100
And if you haven't listened to our show before, 23 Maggots is always full of bad jokes.

323
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Has he added another sheet of toilet paper to his joke book?

324
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,100
He's added many sheets of toilet paper to his notebook.

325
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:40,100
I wish I could sneak into his room in the middle of the night, take a match, and sprint it.

326
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,100
But that would be bad, because then I wouldn't have a place to live.

327
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,100
So yeah, I'll just leave it in the bathroom so his brother can mangle it or something.

328
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,020
Anyway, okay, I guess I'm done.

329
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,860
Alright, let's go over to somebody else

330
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,220
brand new to the show, never been here before. How are you doing, Andrew?

331
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,020
I'm very tired, how are you doing? How was your week, how was your day? Very busy,

332
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,540
this week was my last day working full-time at my job teaching kids. I'm

333
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,220
very excited that I don't have to do that anymore, because that was getting very stressful.

334
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,500
But beyond that, just doing usual stuff,

335
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,580
like especially avoiding jail bait. I seem to have like this 16-year-old

336
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,260
fan club which doesn't do me any good. You know, I've heard a lot of DDR guys have this

337
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,460
problem. Hey man, I don't know what it is. I had the same problem when I worked at Roundtable.

338
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,820
For some reason, the fact that I was in a shift manager position, meaning I could provide

339
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,500
free pizza. Yeah, there you go. Get a lot of fangirls that way. Yes. In fact, one day

340
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,580
would like spread rumors because my mom worked as like a yard duty at the junior high. And

341
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,060
So I'd hear rumors saying, this is a girl saying that you guys are like dating.

342
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,420
And I'm like, what?

343
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,580
That was funny.

344
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,820
Wow, yeah, it's unusual.

345
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,700
But I don't know what it is, if it's the DDR or what, or if that I look like four

346
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,740
years younger than I really am.

347
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,100
Because most people think I look like 16, I'm almost 21.

348
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,060
You do look kind of young.

349
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,140
They can probably see you on camera now.

350
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,580
Also, they want you to speak up.

351
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,100
OK, sorry.

352
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,260
Right there, got it.

353
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,620
You have to scream like I do.

354
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,020
Got it?

355
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,420
OK.

356
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,360
gotcha

357
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,380
all right so anything else you want to share besides the underage girls

358
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,940
know that that's pretty much all that goes on now

359
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,340
all right is

360
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,300
all right so uh... i guess we'll come over here then and talk to our uh...

361
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,260
other guests

362
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,720
uh... c squared

363
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,420
as he's now known what

364
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,180
why the name change again you had to go into the media

365
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,560
everybody knew who you were before you know not everybody not everybody

366
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,720
Nobody cared before you had the flashing foot. You were a nobody.

367
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,300
I was a nobody.

368
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,940
Now I changed it because I figured that would be the best course of action.

369
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,100
Apparently it doesn't matter, so you know, I made that name for no good reason.

370
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,380
Oh well.

371
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,480
So, what are we doing again right now? How was your week? How was your day?

372
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,160
Okay, my week? I worked.

373
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,660
That's pretty much it. That's all I do.

374
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,660
every week

375
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,900
uh...

376
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,880
then yesterday

377
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,380
uh... i went out to dave and busters

378
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,900
uh... which is really cool because it was my first time

379
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,500
so all those people on the airfreak

380
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,740
you guys uh...

381
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,400
that's probably why

382
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,860
you didn't get anything from any of the vivid members last night because we were

383
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,460
all at dave and busters getting drunk so

384
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,680
yeah uh...

385
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,540
so i had a good time uh... played some games

386
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,600
played that other dancing game

387
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,260
uh... you mean uh...

388
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,740
i mean pump it up

389
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,940
that's right

390
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,080
don't don't discriminate against the other games it's cool you can do the

391
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,240
pump jump

392
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,380
uh... they pull over and uh... do it

393
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,560
whatever it goes

394
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,400
awesome

395
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,760
uh...

396
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,120
me and i worked

397
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
the end

398
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,660
and uh... a obviously got my uh... vivid status on the air freak which

399
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,660
i swear you guys friday

400
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,500
me in Float Walk. If you don't know who Float Walk is, I'm not gonna tell you. We had, like,

401
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:18,500
a laugh a minute, and you guys are seriously creeping us out with the DNL Photoshop pictures.

402
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,700
It was like looking at a Fark.com Photoshop contest, honestly. It was hilarious. Just,

403
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,140
it was creepy. That's really all I can say to that. But, you know, if you happen to want

404
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:35,900
to do it again? It was funny. So, yeah. That was my week, and today I came to Sacramento

405
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:42,100
in the end. All right. Well, we'll be asking you more questions, certainly, about your

406
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,180
work this week. Oh, yeah. You guys might want to pay attention, because who knows if I give

407
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:52,900
hints or not. We don't know. I want to talk about hints with you in a little while. I

408
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,260
I have big questions to ask you about H.I.N.C.E.

409
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,340
Anyway, um, Loki, how was your week, how was your day, since, you know, I know everybody

410
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,780
out there on DDRFreak really cares how your week and your day was.

411
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
Ask, screw them.

412
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,780
What?

413
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,580
No, I'm looking, I'm looking right now.

414
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,920
They all, they're all like, man, we are such big fan- you know what?

415
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,380
Just don't bother playing the song tonight.

416
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,240
Just don't, you can save that till next week.

417
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,320
I want to know about you guys' week and your day, especially you, Loki.

418
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Especially me?

419
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
What the hell?

420
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,700
You make it look like I had an interesting week.

421
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:31,740
Okay, so this week what I was doing, I was, I, yes, I did, but that's not the point. I

422
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,700
did that towards the end of the week. The beginning of the week was even better, okay?

423
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:44,300
Basically what happened was that, no. It's too slow to play Final Fantasy, and I don't

424
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:49,860
want to have to buy another copy of it. For what would I do then? Anyways, um, so I was

425
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,840
really bored at work, like usual, um, so I browse websites. You know, when I can't browse

426
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,880
Bemani websites, because I read them too fast, and no one posts fast enough for me to read

427
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,000
everything, I browse other things. And this week, it was the Shadowlands.net. And what

428
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,740
the Shadowlands.net is, is a big paranormal website, about all, like, hauntings and shit.

429
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,700
So, I got on this, like, paranormal kick for, like, this whole week, and basically just

430
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:26,380
figuring all this stuff out. And so now, for some reason, I'm going to bid on a supposedly haunted-possessed doll that's fucked-up looking, and I'm gonna buy that.

431
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,840
Those things are cool.

432
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:38,760
No, it's supposedly a really fucked-up, real, not-not the pictures I posted, like, a real doll that is supposedly haunted. Like, and they have photographic proof and shit.

433
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Anyways, so I'm gonna buy that and put it at my desk at work to creep out my co-worker.

434
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
And that's the whole point.

435
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
That's beautiful.

436
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
I thought that'd be, that'd be great.

437
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
So I might do that.

438
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,760
I don't know, depends on how expensive it is, cause I have to also fix my cabinet, cause

439
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
I found it earlier this week, cause the way I have it set up, there's like some conflicts

440
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,760
with some of the controller things I have on there, so I need to buy a new keyboard

441
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
encoder to get the main cabinet working.

442
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,760
But I've been playing lots of games, more porno games again and Kicking Ass and Gals Panic and all that stuff because it's fun.

443
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:23,760
And, um, oh what else? Oh, I don't know, um, I actually had a pretty interesting weekend, um, on Friday night I went to a bar and, um, hung out there with co-workers that I don't like.

444
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,760
And there was a girl that supposedly asked me to dance but it was so loud in there I couldn't understand a word she was saying.

445
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:38,760
I heard this, ehhhh, outside! I'm like, huh? And then she kind of walked off really pissed.

446
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,760
And I don't know what the hell happened, and my friend standing next to me was like, actually

447
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:49,760
that was a good dance. I'm like, oh. So that was fun. And so we did that, and they had

448
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,760
a giant hippo head with a bagpipe in his mouth, so I thought that was kind of neat. And last

449
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,760
night we went and saw some comedians. There was a guy that looked like Mr. Bean, and another

450
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:08,760
It looked like Ray Romano. That was pretty cool. Then there was this Mexican guy headlining. And, because the guy was really cool, I bought his CD, so I'm gonna give you a copy, Jamie, so you can play it on your show.

451
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Awesome.

452
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,760
It's a 25-minute set of his. I can't remember the guy's name for the life of me. But, um, I think he was on Comedy Central. I could've sworn I remembered his stand-up bit on, uh...

453
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
It's funny comedy, you know? Play it.

454
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,760
But, yeah, he was, like, there's these people that are drunk really, like, next to us and stuff, and he was just ripped into them all night. It was great.

455
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:33,760
So, that's what I did last night, and then, you know, Final Fantasy XI in the middle there, so.

456
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Uh, dang.

457
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Yeah. And then, of course, there's other things I did, but we're gonna get into that later.

458
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,760
More, uh, stuff I downloaded and whatnot.

459
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,760
I, uh, my week and my day was, uh, pretty decent. This was the first week back from the East Coast.

460
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Uh, so, I was just kinda trying to catch up on everything.

461
00:29:51,760 --> 00:30:01,760
And, you know, last night I was at Dave & Buster's with Seagurd and some of the other folks there, and I went to go play Pump It Up because they don't have any other Bomani there.

462
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Although somebody told me they have the I Can Dance game there, the Itoy game. I'm sorry, I Can Boogie, which is the, it's basically Itoy Groove in the arcades. I could not find it.

463
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,760
I should have, I didn't realize it was there and I should have thought to ask Mel or somebody who goes there all the time, but...

464
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Don't worry, you didn't miss anything. It sucks ass. Oh my god, it sucks ass.

465
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Well, it's alright. So fine. I didn't get to play it.

466
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,760
So, instead I decided to play it and I realized

467
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,760
I decided to play Bump It Up and then I realized that I haven't really played DDR

468
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,760
seriously in about three months or so. So, I haven't really gotten any

469
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,760
more stamina than I had before. And of course Shane gets up on there and wants to play

470
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,760
like 9-footers. What the hell was that song you made us do last that killed me?

471
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,160
was clap your hands on crazy, and you know, we were just worn out so we didn't pass it.

472
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,240
I seriously thought I was gonna die. I had to go out in the parking lot and go hoo, hoo,

473
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:07,360
hoo. Like, it was horrible. So I ended up missing like an hour of some good gaming.

474
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,440
Some good feeding quarters into the giant crane machine because I was gonna die.

475
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,960
I actually, I experienced the same thing you felt, except I'm really out of shape because

476
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,920
I haven't played DDR in months, lots of months, and I went and played seven footers on doubles

477
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,600
and I was out of breath, like heart attack out of breath, and that's really sad. But

478
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,040
I'm working on the cabinet, it's gonna be done, DDR will be able to be played, and I

479
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,800
will get back into shape again.

480
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,320
How is that cabinet coming along? You built, now for those that haven't been listening

481
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,360
to the show for, well I mean that's a lot of you guys tonight, I frankly know, you've

482
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,660
You've been building your own home cabinet, which is like your dream machine.

483
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,820
Tell us a little bit more about this cabinet you've been building.

484
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,060
Well this thing's basically an all-in-one Bomani cabinet and arcade cabinet.

485
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,580
Right now, the first part of it's done, which is the MAME part of it, so I have a four-player

486
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,700
kind of control panel with two of the players having six buttons, three and four having

487
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
just four buttons.

488
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,900
And it's basically just set up for MAME right now.

489
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Later on, though, I'm working on a setup for DDR, Dance Maniacs, 2DX, and Poppy Music, all, um, you know, can be built.

490
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,900
And I actually have most of the stuff designed and, um, all the supplies to do it. I just have to get around to actually doing it.

491
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Um, so that's, you know, what I'm basically working on right now.

492
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:41,900
So be, you know, pretty much the whole arcade at my house just because our arcade kind of sucks as far as putting, you know, working together machines there and keeping their games away from the little kiddies.

493
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:56,900
So, I was forced to do this by them. I was forced to spend $3,000 to fix up a nice cabinet so I have working games because I like playing arcade games and I refuse to go to an arcade that has broken games.

494
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:02,020
I think that they should put all the Golf Land children in a pen and put like spider stomp in it

495
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,420
And just leave them there. We'll actually stomp on the children. Oh

496
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,940
That would be awesome

497
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,200
Like a giant troubled board game instead of having dice in the middle have children in the pop-o-matic bubble

498
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,540
That would be wonderful bang it and they go pop. I wish they had

499
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,780
How many seconds they scream is how long you can move? Oh?

500
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:28,660
Oh my god, it's kiddomatic trouble in giant size, Eep.

501
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,260
Or how about a giant catapult with piano wire above them?

502
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Ooh!

503
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,300
But no, if you kill them, you have to get more children, and that means that people

504
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,780
have to breed.

505
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
They're going to breed anyways.

506
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
Because they're stupid.

507
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,900
I still think that they should make standardized testing for breeding.

508
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,260
Not only are they going to breed, they're breeding at younger and younger ages these

509
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
days.

510
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:55,620
gonna be like a a baby that has a baby just wait a ten-year-old had a baby

511
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,940
disgusting I mean it was a bad situation that produced it but still I know man

512
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,980
they're like getting blow jobs and shit in junior high I want to know where the

513
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,180
hell was this shit when I was in junior high fucking a I've been like you know

514
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,060
I'm a little young for a blow job I'm fucked that I'd be like shit man get

515
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,260
over here you know but that shit was never there when I was in junior high

516
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:23,380
that pisses me off. Fucking kids have it so lucky nowadays. She didn't live in Alabama.

517
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,460
I don't care what they say about the tradition, you know, the whole Christian look of this,

518
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,980
uh-uh, no. Depends on where you live. People are doing it early. You see, now if I lived

519
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:39,220
in Vacaville, at least there'd be plenty of sheep and stuff, but, you know, I don't have

520
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,620
that kind of convenience here in, you know, Folsom and stuff around the area. Do you love

521
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,020
I just wanted to say about the whole little kids having kids.

522
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:53,320
My middle school, we had a couple kids there have children, and that's back in Kansas,

523
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,880
so you know there's nothing to do there.

524
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:02,200
Let's hear it for family values.

525
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Different strokes or different folks?

526
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
All right.

527
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,140
Some are stroking it.

528
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,180
And if more people stroked it, we wouldn't have a baby outbreak anyway.

529
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,180
Yeah, exactly.

530
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,300
This is why, this is why for the whole anti, you know, like what is it that they're doing

531
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,200
in, was it in Texas I think?

532
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,460
The whole abstinence, teaching abstinence instead of safe, you know, forms of intercourse.

533
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,380
Instead they should just teach the joy of masturbation.

534
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,440
Why go out when you can get it at home?

535
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,940
On that note, I think we're going to go ahead and take a break, and when we come back from

536
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,140
this break I definitely yeah and I think it's hilarious because a lot of people

537
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,780
that are listening to show right now are like why don't you guys play the song at

538
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,180
630 hey nobody said we were gonna play the song at 630 we said we're gonna play

539
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:55,060
it during the show which runs between 630 and 930 and if that happens to be at

540
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:03,540
929 you all just have to deal but maybe we'll do 928 we'll see all right no

541
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,540
we'll get it in eventually here when we feel like it when Jamie says it's time

542
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,780
lord knows what that'll be all right all right but actually no we do have some

543
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,100
fun stuff coming up for you we'll get back I guess we can talk about DDR

544
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,060
because huh I will I will play it we're gonna do some Akira this break actually

545
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:27,100
for those you know what all right since everybody's been like relatively good

546
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,220
even though there has been some shit talking on the forums out there that

547
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:35,100
makes me a little bit angry. I guess we can do, like, another little tease here. How about

548
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,020
a tease? Do you guys want another little tease?

549
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,060
Go tease it, Rob.

550
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,660
I'm gonna tease it right now, you guys. Here it is.

551
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:49,140
Oh, that's it. That's it. That was a tease. All right. All right. So, now that that tease

552
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,340
has been done, let's go to a break. When we come back, I think we'll actually talk about

553
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
some DDR6.

554
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Make it big.

555
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,900
I want to talk about how Seagurd's internet penis just grew enormous this week. Enormous.

556
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,980
and people want us to talk it's so we're going to talk to him

557
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,000
or lack thereof when we come back

558
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,240
from this break

559
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,580
and uh... i will also be giving heads as well

560
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,360
but you don't even work for coming in you've never played i think if that's

561
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,660
because i have insider info you

562
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,580
breaking more on that every and that anyone else can get but you're just you

563
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,840
fucking stupid to realize that we told you like

564
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,740
four fucking months ago or even before that what the hell do you think that

565
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,380
That's alright. I'm gonna tell you that I told you so, and you can just kiss my ass again.

566
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,940
You can blow me, just like you blew me before when it came down to, you know, fucking saying,

567
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:43,220
Oh, Sakura's not gonna be in DDR Extreme. Fuck you! Okay? That's what I have to say about that.

568
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,140
Someone's full of the anger tonight.

569
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,740
That Loki guy screams into the microphone too much. He screams. He screams into the microphone.

570
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,540
He's scary.

571
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,140
Why doesn't somebody give him a drug?

572
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,780
Why can't he just shut up and play the song?

573
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
Just shut up.

574
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
Give us a hint.

575
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,780
Give us a hint.

576
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
I have a hint for you.

577
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,220
It's called Bite My Ass.

578
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,220
Now be nice.

579
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,900
We want the listeners to come back when they realize that we're not that bad.

580
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,900
No, we're not that bad.

581
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
We're really not.

582
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
We're just messing with you guys tonight.

583
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
Seriously.

584
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
Seriously, though, just listen.

585
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
Just stay patient.

586
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
Patience is a virtue.

587
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Be virtuous.

588
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
I know it's hard, but you can wait.

589
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Okay.

590
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,900
Okay.

591
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:25,900
to us. I know it's hard, but you can wait. Ok. Alright, we'll be back after some Akira.

592
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,900
and

593
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,900
and

594
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,900
and

595
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,900

Ooh ooh, yeah ooh ooh, ooh Ooh ooh, yeah ooh ooh, ooh

614
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:39,220
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, I'm going to show you how

615
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,060
My girlfriend, Melody, can join us on all the fun together.

616
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:12,460
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

617
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,980
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

618
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,980
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

619
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,020
Hello, we are back with Orange Lounge Radio. That's our buddy, Mel B.

620
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,940
I think he's listening tonight.

621
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,860
He's hanging out in our chat room tonight.

622
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,180
Hello. Hi, Mel, if you're listening.

623
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:27,700
Hi, Mel.

624
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,140
And Melody, too, is on their house.

625
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,380
Hi, Melody.

626
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,820
And I spent some time with Melody last night.

627
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,780
Not in that way, but I spent some quality bonding time with Melody, because she's my girl.

628
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,580
So, it was good to see her.

629
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:44,440
And I'm hoping to see her again in a couple weeks, because I want to go over to San Jose for the Classic Gaming Expo.

630
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,820
You know what, I'm still skipping class for that. You need to, you need to come with me.

631
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,860
Well, Dan's going.

632
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,860
Oh, well hell, we all need to go. So Dan and I are going to have ourselves a hotel. You know Konami is having a showing

633
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,540
there at Classic Gaming Expo?

634
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,240
I wonder if there will be some twinbee for me to play.

635
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,780
I hear that Konami is going to make a showing.

636
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:10,780
But I can't say what's going on. I don't think so. But I'm very glad that it's in San Jose this year instead of in Vegas because that would have been pricey.

637
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:16,480
Yeah, at least it's drivable here. The only good thing about it being in Vegas is that I would have been able to have seen

638
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,680
Maranjan.

639
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,820
I'm making plans at another time

640
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:27,140
if someone has two hundred and fifty dollars to lend me.

641
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,140
That's a hint!

642
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
No, it's not.

643
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,140
Maybe worth money! That's a hint!

644
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:38,140
Be careful with the way you use the word hint on tonight's show, because people are gonna run with it.

645
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,140
Oh, you don't think I said that on purpose?

646
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,140
I'm teasing them.

647
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:54,140
Just so you guys know, if myself, Loki, or Dark Sakura say something as a hint, we're pretty much talking out our ass because there's this little thing called NDA, called the non-disclosure agreement,

648
00:47:54,140 --> 00:48:00,640
which means that even though our buddy works at Konami, he can't tell us what's going on, or they will fire his ass, and we don't want that to happen to him.

649
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,640
No, we don't want that to happen.

650
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,140
When I can disclose anything I want because they can fire me all they want, I don't work for them.

651
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,640
No.

652
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,640
I will disclose it all. Everything. Everything.

653
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:22,640
But, no, it's surprising, um, is, you know, this information's been out forever, and just people just... they're really... I can't say anything.

654
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,880
What we can talk about, I can't mention this, is that a few months ago, and you can go back

655
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,640
in the Orange Lounge Radio story archives, and you can look at, we had a story that talked

656
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,960
about how some folks were hacking the disc for DDR. What disc were they hacking back

657
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
at that point?

658
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,080
It was Party Collection, and there's a master list. Okay, here's how it works. When they're

659
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,520
making the games, there's a master list of all the songs that have been in all the games,

660
00:48:49,520 --> 00:49:09,520
and they're going to be in all the game, well basically whatever they're working on up to that point. It's just a master list. Think of it like if you're familiar with MAME, there's a master ROM list. Okay, well this is a master song list. So it's going to contain everything from the arcade versions, the home versions, and home versions that they're working on at the moment.

661
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:29,520
So, here's the thing right now. As I said before, you know, there are some songs in there that they, you know, they're all, oh, those are, you know, don't believe that. Because, you know, back in the day when DDR Max was first coming out, and remember there was that Orion Civilization supposedly remix of that, but it was just under a different name.

662
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Well, everyone's like, oh, those lists are wrong. And then they're saying, oh, well, Nemesis is supposed to be in Max 2 or something like that, or the DDR Extreme, and that never happened. Well, guess what? Remember the sound packs and the Nemesis was there? That's because when Konami's working on songs, they don't necessarily throw it into the very next mix that comes out.

663
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:55,440
that comes out so this you know list that was in a party collection guess

664
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,320
what there's gonna be some of those songs in the next mix and guess what I

665
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:06,320
told you fuckers that before and no everyone is wrong max period that's a

666
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,120
dumb name for a song but guess what read that it's a dumb name okay it's a dumb

667
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,800
name for a song that's so fucking wrong and then there was you know I mean all

668
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:21,180
in its piece of shit glory. This is where we point and laugh. No, but there are songs,

669
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:26,180
I mean a lot of songs actually, that are in there that are going to be in, you know, extremes.

670
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:34,780
So, I told you so. I'm actually trying to find that list from when we posted it, trying

671
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,540
to post, we were posting that list and then I distinctly remember that Diving was in that

672
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,420
list and it has been confirmed that Diving is going to be in DDR Extreme, that's no secret,

673
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,860
Four Strings Diving, because I remember we were talking about that list on an earlier

674
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,060
show and I saw Diving and I said, oh, that's another song on that Four Strings album, so

675
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,060
Diving must be in there.

676
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,420
Come to think of it, that was also in the pre-show, it was on the CD.

677
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,420
Yeah, there you go.

678
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:02,460
Alright, okay, so I'm going to dig through the archives a little more and we'll go through

679
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,060
that list again and we'll see, you know, maybe there's some song titles in there, but you

680
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,560
know what?

681
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,860
Is Konami capable of throwing red herrings our way?

682
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,860
You bet.

683
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,560
songs that are supposed to be in DDR that don't make it into DDR in the

684
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,980
final cut absolutely yes there are and there are songs that get you know

685
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:25,580
canceled like for example DDR ultra mix the Humpty dance okay I would have dug

686
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,280
it if the Humpty dance was in DDR been awesome all right but how would you make

687
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,160
steps for that and get it to look right we'll come back we'll come back to this

688
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,780
subject a little later but I wanted I wanted to keep things moving I actually

689
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,380
wanted to talk to Andrew sitting there he's sitting there in the corner and

690
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,120
he's never been here before so are you enjoying things so far oh yeah yeah

691
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,660
good like everybody wants to talk to me you came on a good night yeah everybody

692
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,980
heard you were gonna be here and now our caps are breaking and everything that's

693
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,800
what I heard and I'm really happy that I can contribute like this to your show no

694
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,900
problem you should cut you should come here more often I should appreciate it

695
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,940
in all seriousness for those who don't know you you're the guy and the reason

696
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,620
why I wanted you to be on the show is because you dress up like a pirate when

697
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,620
play DDR?

698
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,620
Yes.

699
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,620
Why?

700
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,620
Why?

701
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:15,800
Well, at first it started because I'm just a massive attention whore, and I mean honestly,

702
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:21,320
but I don't know, I mean I got there and I just started playing and some people would

703
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,640
watch, but I was never a freestyler because I'm too white for that shit, so basically

704
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,440
I just was like, I just stopped off at some party store after work one night, bought a

705
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,000
a cheap pirate costume, went into Golfland, and I noticed I turn around and there's like

706
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,340
40 or 50 people. There's like 40 or 50 people watching me, so I'm just like, okay, I'll

707
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:47,720
keep this up. So I just kind of whore it around in my signature now. I'm a toady 007 on a

708
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,920
Game Facts DDR Freak. Get a hold of me on the NorCal forums. So it's mainly an attention

709
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,520
thing. I haven't done it recently, but uh... Where did you get the idea? Have you just

710
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:04,400
always had a long-standing love for pirates, or was it an inside joke that got out of control?

711
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,480
It was an inside joke with some colleagues at work. This was before Pirates of the Caribbean

712
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,520
and all that came out. I was going to say, does this have anything to do with Johnny

713
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:17,180
Depp? No, it doesn't. I don't have a Johnny Depp fetish, or like most people. No, it was

714
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,520
just an inside joke with some people at work. I have a friend that owns a production company

715
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,120
called Shiver Me Timbers Productions, and it kind of went off from there, but, uh...

716
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,400
Shiver Me Timbers!

717
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,600
Yeah, I brought that thing into work the other day. My boss apparently lets me dress up like

718
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,880
a pirate for work, so I thought that was kind of cool.

719
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,160
Now, we all know the Roseville Golf Land, when you go to play DDR there, there's something

720
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,040
that we call the hecklers, or the assholes.

721
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,040
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

722
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,720
There's always people there that make fun of you when you're playing DDR.

723
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,720
Yeah.

724
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,040
FAG! You look like a FAG when you play that game! You're a FAG! Oh, wait, you're a chick.

725
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,040
You're a FAG!

726
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,040
Yeah, I get that anyway even when I'm not playing DDR, but you know, those people, they can kiss my ass, I don't care.

727
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:03,040
Okay, but how bad is that? I mean, what's the worst you've heard? Dressed up, not only playing DDR, but being a pirate playing DDR. What are some of the things you've heard?

728
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,040
Ironically, I don't think I've gotten any shit for the pirate thing.

729
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,040
Really?

730
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,040
If anything, I get shit when I bar rape. I thought you guys were gonna queue up like a boo sound effect when I say that.

731
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,040
No.

732
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,100
on the show. No. No, the pirate thing, most people just kind of go up and go like, what

733
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,840
in the hell is that guy doing? Because I mean, you can see the little strings on the beard,

734
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:30,120
you know, it looks totally fake. You know, but I don't really get anything, it just confuses

735
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,120
the hell out of most people, so they think it's kind of funny. And it really ticks off

736
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,160
all the good freestylers because nobody pays attention to them. Wait, we have good freestylers

737
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,960
in this town? No, I'm just kidding. Oh, okay. That's totally a joke. Wait a minute, wait

738
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,960
Oh yeah, yeah. There's no way I'm serious there.

739
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,960
Are you going to take the pirate to any DDR tournaments in the future?

740
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,960
I will try. I've only been to like two so far, and I got

741
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,960
owned at one of them, and I won the other one. But yeah, I will try.

742
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,960
I talked to some friends before a recent one in Sacramento that you were unable to

743
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,960
go to, but I wish you'd shown up. I know, it was the one that was on my birthday.

744
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,960
Yeah, yeah. That's no excuse. That's no excuse. But next one,

745
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,480
next one I'm thinking about it all right all right sounds good I'll think about

746
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,720
it there's supposed to be a big one in Milpitas Friday I don't know it's like

747
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,200
an improv tournament I want to say yeah I have a wedding on that day I have my I

748
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,840
have my alter ego I wanted to take out for that oh okay okay but I don't think

749
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,760
I'm gonna be able to do it which is too bad thing yeah is it do you know if it's

750
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,360
in the afternoon or at night yeah it's like a night it's a Friday night which

751
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,800
kind of sucks for you if you're out of town I don't get those Friday night

752
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,560
things but sometimes you just you have to do a tournament when you can do it

753
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:45,560
If it's a Friday night, I might be able to do it. I'm not going to enter, but it'll be all good.

754
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:52,560
Okay, so anything else you wanted to share about...

755
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,560
Is there anything you want to plug while you're here?

756
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,560
When guests come on talk shows, they plug things. Is there anything you want to plug?

757
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,560
You said you had a production company?

758
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,560
No, my friend.

Okay, let's go back. I want to go back to that master list. I haven't had the chocolate cake.

791
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:37,120
Jamie's been handing out chocolate cake things to everybody, and I haven't had a chance to eat it yet.

792
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Because I've been talking.

793
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:45,120
This stuff I think I posted was just the license tracks that I recognized.

794
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,120
This is a story that was posted on May 7th on our website.

795
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,120
And you can go back into our archives and have a look.

796
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,120
And these were the songs that were on the master song list that we speculated could be in DDR Extreme.

797
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,720
extremes. This is nothing new and certainly Shane is not going to confirm or deny anything

798
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:08,260
and break his NDA, but. Actually, you know, if you look at it, since it is licensed stuff,

799
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:14,880
you guys already know what it is. So, yeah, hey, the ones that you see that you've already,

800
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,120
that you know are in the game, they are totally in the game. Alright, the ones that are in

801
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,720
the game, they are definitely in the game. So we have on there, simply being loved, which

802
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,800
we know is in the game, diving, we know that's in the game, right on time. I don't think

803
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,280
we ever figured out what that one was did we don't know about that one come

804
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,680
into my world which makes me think of the Kylie Minogue song Euro mix I think

805
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:40,760
from okay okay enjoy the silence I don't know hmm go west okay we knew the pet

806
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,240
shot that got announced the pet shop boys yes locomotion another Kylie song

807
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:50,200
there we go unless it's the original which possibly one more time I think

808
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,920
about the Daft Punk song possibly but we haven't we don't know we don't know if

809
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,340
it's in DDR now we don't know we're just going off what was on that master

810
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:01,820
list planet rock that did turn up in extreme we do know that the boys of

811
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:06,580
summer DJ Sammy song we had heaven and max 2 we thought we'd get an extreme

812
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:10,060
because it was on this list but I haven't heard about it yet

813
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,900
Humpty dance they're saying was possibly something that was coming over from

814
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:23,380
Xbox don't know and Mickey so we don't know don't know but but what we do know

815
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:28,760
is that in our chat room it was said by one of our folk I think was Mel B over

816
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,520
DDR spot did say hey guess what guys if you're trying to find the list to

817
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,660
Ultramix 2 which has I think he said 46 I'm sorry I'm gonna look for what he

818
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:43,120
said where is it I don't know what he said it was something like 46 more songs

819
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:49,240
that have not been in DDR before is it 56 okay 56 56 more songs have not been

820
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:55,880
in DDR before, and none of them are on that master list, so don't even bother looking,

821
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,160
because they're not on there, so forget it.

822
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,160
Nice.

823
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,080
Of course he could be just throwing us off.

824
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,080
Is that a hint?

825
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,080
Is that a hint?

826
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,080
That's true.

827
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,080
Are you guys dropping a hint?

828
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,080
Is that a hint?

829
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
It sounds like a hint to me.

830
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,080
Is that 56 mean something?

831
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,080
If you flip the 6 upside down, it's a 9.

832
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,080
Maybe it's a Japanese character.

833
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,080
Well, here's the thing.

834
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,440
Here's the thing about that.

835
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,960
There's been a big, huge span between when Party Collection came out and when these new

836
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,400
new mixes are coming out. So obviously, you know, there's gonna be a lot of stuff that's

837
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,920
not on there. And I mean, there's a lot of stuff, you know, that would be on there. This

838
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,280
is just stuff that they were developing a while back. So there's a lot of be- a lot

839
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,760
of work being done right now on it, so. It's not surprising that there's not a lot on there,

840
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,280
but. There's some other ones that were not licensed songs that were on the master list

841
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:44,200
that I've heard that might be in there. So, um, I'm not saying anything, but, uh, there

842
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,640
There was stuff that we knew about a long time ago, and I think I even quoted on the

843
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:55,300
show scene what the songs were a long time ago, but, you know, I can't see now because

844
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:00,320
my balls are tied, so, you know, I just, I cannot say anything.

845
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
But that's it.

846
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,320
Alright.

847
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:08,880
I feel like doing another tease, what do you guys think?

848
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,880
Let's do another tease.

849
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,880
Let's tease them again.

850
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,880
Let's do it.

851
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,880
We're gonna do it soon, you guys. We have to make this last, alright?

852
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,880
We only get to have fun like this, what, once every 106 shows?

853
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,880
You guys won't listen to us otherwise, so we have to tease it now.

854
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,880
And you know, after he plays,

855
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,880
I'll probably get to have this little one-on-one chat with him,

856
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,880
so if you guys are just sticking around for the Urine remix,

857
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,880
you might miss out on some other stuff.

858
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,880
I want to chat with you first. I want to get that stuff over with because I have to get something out there.

859
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,880
Man, I've got to set some people straight.

860
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:54,880
Then forget what I said. You guys can leave right after that song plays.

861
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,880
Or no you can't.

862
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,880
Alright, hold on. Let's tease.

863
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
Okay, that's enough.

864
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,880
That was pretty sexy. I like that.

865
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,880
That was very sexy.

866
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,880
It sounded like you touched my something. Yeah.

867
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:17,880
Oh yeah, I think she said boob. I think she said boob. How many DDR's are going to love that? You touch my boob.

868
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:24,880
For everyone that enjoyed our pre-show, we had porn on the webcam, but no one seemed- I don't know if anyone paid attention to that.

869
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,880
I knew I should have got here earlier.

870
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,880
Alright, we will get to it soon, but first, I want to talk to our buddy Seagert.

871
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,880
Do you want to go to commercial first? Alright, Sigurd wants to go to commercial first so we can...

872
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,880
You're gonna... You're pissing off the chat room.

873
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,880
Tough.

874
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,880
Alright. When we get back, we're gonna talk to Sigurd. We're also gonna do some Bamani match game tonight.

875
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,880
And then, maybe we'll do the song, but maybe we'll have a cage match before that. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

876
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,880
It depends what time we're at. We'll have a look. I don't know. God, some people are gonna kick our ass if we don't do it soon.

And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

895
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,000

and more program can we talk about that no subject will ever be taboo

898

899
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,320

900
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,720
okay well

901
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,320

902
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,200
station

Welcome back, Orange Lounge Radio.

and you know I have to say I'm I'm if you haven't figured it out I'm I'm kind

913
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,340
of reading the DDR freak threat on extreme during the show and about the

914
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:48,320
last four pages have been people talking about this show and it's really starting

915
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:54,760
to piss some of you your moderators off but it's okay you're contributing to the

916
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,380

918
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:09,620
So please, you know, you guys can talk on that thread after the show, but some of the

919
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:17,300
moderators over there aren't exactly happy cappers right now because you guys have hijacked

920
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,260
the thread, so please steer things back on course.

921
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,480
We do have forums of our own, nobody posts there, but hey, you know, you could be a trend

922
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,480
setter.

923
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:37,080
Yes. No, maybe later. All right. Moving on. Let's see. I said I wanted to talk to Seagurd,

924
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:44,040
so let's talk to Seagurd. Yes, Logan. You said moving on. That was another song in DDR.

925
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:50,420
Could it be? Again, I don't know shit about what is going to be in Extreme or Ultramix

926
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:57,420
or anything down the line. Even if I did know, I don't know as far as you're concerned, okay?

927
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:04,980
That's it, alright? Alright. Moving on. Again. Uh, Secret, how are you? I'm doing pretty

928
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:10,300
good. Alright, so, no secret now, you're a vivid member on The Freak. That I am. So that

929
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:17,940
must mean I work for Konami. And what exactly do you do at Konami? I go to work for Konami.

930
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:18,940
That's what I do.

931
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:20,500
Are you allowed to talk about what you do there?

932
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,500
You know what?

933
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,700
I have no clue, and since I have no clue, I'm gonna say I work for Konami.

934
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,940
Okay, alright, fine.

935
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:26,940
Fair enough.

936
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:27,940
Alright.

937
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:28,940
But, um...

938
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:29,940
Well, you make a lot of money, right?

939
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:30,940
So you must be doing...

940
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:31,940
No, I'm kidding.

941
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:32,940
I wish I made a lot of money.

942
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,940
Alright, so fine.

943
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:38,540
We can talk about what you do, but you do have to come in contact with DDR Games at

944
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,100
some point through your job.

945
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,940
That's why I have the vivid membership.

946
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,260
Alright, alright, fine.

947
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,780
No, okay, let's talk about life before Konami then.

948
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:46,780
Okay.

949
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,180
Are you getting a backstory?

950
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:52,060
Yeah, but you've been on the show before, but nobody was listening then, but now people

951
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,060
care tonight.

952
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,060
Nobody cared then.

953
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:56,420
People seem to care tonight, suddenly, about this show for some reason.

954
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,060
I can't, for the life of me, imagine why.

955
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,060
I don't know why.

956
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,020
What exactly were you doing before Konami?

957
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,980
I worked for E.V. Games back in Kansas.

958
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,980
That's right.

959
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:12,800
I'm from the Midwest, so yeah, I worked there, and then I came out here.

960
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,540
The end, I guess.

961
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,320
What possessed you to come out here?

962
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:21,440
I had been wanting to move out here for a while, like, I'm originally way long time

963
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:27,960
ago from here, but, um, yeah, I moved to Kansas, then I decided, hey, Kansas kind of sucks.

964
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,360
Because it really does.

965
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,880
Um, so I moved out here.

966
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,360
Alright, fair enough.

967
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,360
Yeah.

968
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,440
And how, now, I don't know how much you can or can't say about this, but how did you get

969
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,440
the job at Konami?

970
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,800
Because a lot of people want to know this, like, oh, I want to work in a video game,

971
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,440
I want to play video games all day.

972
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:47,520
How do you get, and I'm sure that's exactly how you would describe some of the jobs there,

973
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,520
right?

974
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,880
Yeah, sure, right.

975
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,720
How exactly did you get the job at Konami?

976
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,820
I applied.

977
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,960
And who did you have to blow?

978
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,960
Pretty much everybody.

979
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,760
No, seriously, how did you manage to get it?

980
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,760
I applied.

981
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,680
You know, it's not like Konami is a huge secretive company.

982
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,360
go to their website and you know what, sometimes they have job offers and sometimes they don't.

983
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,720
If you look, you might be able to catch one of them when they do. So, uh, that's pretty

984
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,720
much how it works.

985
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,160
Alright, so you went to a company and you applied and, and, and who knew it? They hired

986
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,160
you.

987
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,160
Exactly. What were they thinking?

988
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,840
They obviously don't know me.

989
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,640
Now, since you do come in contact with some DDR games, you guys like to have a little

990
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,520
fun on some of the big message boards. Of course, the biggest one that comes to mind,

991
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,520
the free, right?

992
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,520
The free, yeah.

993
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:43,720
posted lately in the thread, and what do you hope to gain from posting in this thread?

994
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:51,600
I hope to gain just pretty much some laughter, because that's what I've been getting.

995
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,560
And I think what it's really doing is creating a lot of hype for the game.

996
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,640
And if you had been on the DDR Freak boards, gosh, maybe before Friday, because that's

997
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,880
when we all started coming into contact with the boards.

998
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,800
It was really not a very happy place, but you know what?

999
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,380
I think everybody's starting to realize, you know, this is DDR.

1000
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,840
This is why we're here, and we're going to enjoy it.

1001
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,800
So, I mean, people seem to be having fun again instead of just complaining.

1002
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,800
Yeah, that's good.

1003
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,840
Yeah, I noticed people were having fun with it.

1004
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,840
Especially all the photoshops.

1005
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:31,880
Oh my God, the photoshops.

1006
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:32,880
You were just in the bathroom.

1007
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,880
I'm sorry.

1008
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,880
Look at this.

1009
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,880
Look at this.

1010
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:39,880
Dark Sakura kicks our guest from Konami out of the chair so she can sit down, it's beautiful.

1011
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,880
Alright.

1012
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:45,880
She's motioning for Seeker to come sit down. I think you should go sit on her lap.

1013
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,880
Yeah, I would, but you might punch me.

1014
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,880
Seeker's afraid of being punched by Dark Sakura. Come on, Dark Sakura loves you.

1015
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,880
Dark Sakura, tell him you love him.

1016
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,880
Like a hole in the head.

1017
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,880
Alright.

1018
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,880
I love you.

1019
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,880
So back to the thread.

1020
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,880
One thing first.

1021
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:13,880
Okay, now if you've been following DDRFreakThread, which I'm sure you have,

1022
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,880
you know, DNL has all these fanboys.

1023
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,880
Where's my fanboys? I want fanboys.

1024
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,880
I don't want fangirls, I want fanboys.

1025
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,880
Oh, I see.

1026
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,880
So, come on, step it up.

1027
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,880
You and I have something in common, I see.

1028
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:28,880
Alright.

1029
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,880
And if you've listened to this show for the past 105 episodes, you know what I'm talking about.

1030
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,520
you that are just listening tonight, I don't feel like telling it again. So, you'll just

1031
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:43,400
have to be in the dark. So, yeah, anyway, well, DDR Freakboards, what were you talking

1032
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:48,640
about? Yeah, DDR Freakboards. This thing, it happens every time there's a new mix. Every

1033
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:54,420
time there's a new mix. The first mix, Conomics, all the way back there to DDR Max, Max 2,

1034
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:58,920
there's this thing called Hints. And we all know that a while back, Jason Enos, like back

1035
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,760
during comic stage, used to come on the thread and drop hints about what was going on, and

1036
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,760
and then, you know, some other folks picked up the slack for some of the later games.

1037
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,760
Yeah, Dantrex, Cryptic...

1038
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,760
Some folks you guys don't even know, right?

1039
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,760
Exactly.

1040
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,760
Even you work there and you don't know who they are.

1041
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,760
Exactly.

1042
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:12,760
Exactly.

1043
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,760
So...

1044
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,360
Because if we knew who they were, they'd probably have a Vivid foot next to their name.

1045
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:22,760
So now it comes to the point where you post, as a Vivid member, not just any Vivid member,

1046
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:26,760
but one that works for Konami, you post anything and somebody assumes it's a hint.

1047
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,760
Yes.

1048
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,760
It is a...

1049
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,760
It has to be a hint.

1050
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,760
You must be talking about a new song.

1051
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,760
Exactly.

1052
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,240
is what you want to do more than anything is spoiled your NDA and...

1053
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,080
Yes, I really want to get fired. I mean, these people...

1054
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,880
I'm glad they're picking up on that. Alright, so

1055
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,240
how many hints have you posted in the DDR Freak thread thus far?

1056
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,600
DDR Freak listeners, we

1057
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,040
as a collective group have posted exactly

1058
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,920
zero hints. Zero hints! But, but,

1059
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,280
maybe that was a hint. No, no, seriously.

1060
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:07,280
No. Oh, 01 was in seventh style. He was the, oh my gosh, oh my gosh you guys, 01's in it.

1061
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:12,280
But, yeah, I mean, I posted this earlier on the thread, you know.

1062
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,280
But it was ignored.

1063
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,280
Of course. I don't know why. I have a flashy foot by my name. Listen to me.

1064
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:25,280
So wait, but I seem to recall that one of the other folks over there posted a picture, and it had, like, a party collection bucket.

1065
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,280
Yeah, yeah.

1066
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,280
And, like, a Max 2 thing. It had, like, extreme samplers there.

1067
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,600
And, oh, would you hold up the extreme sampler for the camera? Can you do that?

1068
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,320
Somebody else can, or I guess I can.

1069
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,560
Yeah, we'll have, we'll have to see. I'll do it during the break.

1070
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,360
Yeah, we'll do it during the break.

1071
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,320
We'll do it during the break.

1072
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,680
Because it's like way over by the camera, and I don't feel like going by the camera.

1073
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,320
Well you can hold that.

1074
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,480
Yeah, hold that, that's the same size.

1075
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,440
That's not it, that's something else.

1076
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,320
It's close enough.

1077
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:49,840
All right.

1078
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,080
Um, but yeah, that picture.

1079
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,240
Is that a porno you're holding up, or what?

1080
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,880
A Fahrenheit 9-11.

1081
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,680
No, that picture, you know, with the party collection bucket and all that, it was the

1082
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:08,200
picture with the party collection bucket and whatever else.

1083
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,000
I said it has nothing to do with anything.

1084
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It's the v-rare.

1085
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,500
So, wait a minute.

1086
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:19,380
So that picture with the party collection and the tip jar and everything, that's basically

1087
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:22,960
just you guys showing off that you have a humongous internet penis right now and you're

1088
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,320
not afraid to whip it out.

1089
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,320
Exactly.

1090
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,320
Yeah.

1091
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,320
Okay.

1092
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,320
We're very family oriented.

1093
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,080
So, the picture meant nothing. There are no hidden clues in that picture.

1094
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:36,400
As a friend, you're swearing to me there is no hidden meaning in that picture,

1095
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,160
because we go way back. We go way back.

1096
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,360
Oh, you are holding it up?

1097
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,040
Stop it! Now you're even fucking with me. Alright.

1098
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,320
I swear that there were no hints.

1099
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,920
Now granted, you guys can't see me, so I could be crossing my fingers.

1100
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,200
Oh, stop.

1101
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:00,920
I said, I said on the boards, you guys will figure out when we are actually giving hints.

1102
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,080
If I say we're not, we probably aren't.

1103
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,540
If I say we aren't, we could be.

1104
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,540
That's what keeps it fun.

1105
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:10,380
Alright, but seriously, there's no hints.

1106
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:13,300
Seriously, in that picture, there are no hints.

1107
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,640
When the hints start, you guys will know, right?

1108
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,100
When the hints start, you will know.

1109
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,100
And does that mean you're going to give us a hint tonight?

1110
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,100
No.

1111
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,100
Right.

1112
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,100
No.

1113
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,100
No.

1114
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,100
No.

1115
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,100
I'm sorry guys.

1116
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,660
but because there are these things called the dawn disclosure agreements he can only

1117
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:31,780
say what he's allowed to say and we're not allowed to say anything else but you know

1118
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:36,500
what we got the song and that's enough for me right now that's more than enough so certainly

1119
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:40,900
we can't give out any more hints certainly I couldn't give out anything else because

1120
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:46,300
I don't know what the hell else is in the game but uh so apparently there's porn in

1121
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:52,980
this mix oh was that a hint that could have been a hint is it erotic oh my god oh my god

1122
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:56,060
products in it oh my gosh

1123
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:57,340
yeah

1124
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:01,540
it was yeah yeah it wasn't it was funny diversified still funny if you guys

1125
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,460
want to read into what we say go ahead it might pay off it might not

1126
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:07,020
I mean your speculation

1127
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,340
seems to run the gamut of everything

1128
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:12,380
so you might hit something randomly of course we're not going to tell you if

1129
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:15,860
you're right but you might be keep those photoshops coming though especially the

1130
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,140
ones of see your

1131
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:21,180
thankfully all I did was like my neck is in there if you can photoshop my neck

1132
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:25,320
more power to you just you guys know i didn't even and and i've known

1133
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,660
chain for a while now and we don't mind those down

1134
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:32,020
i've known him for a while now a little while now i don't we don't go away back

1135
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:35,900
but you know i'm a little early sleep here too too

1136
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,120
but um...

1137
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:41,420
i did not know it was him i was reading through and i'm like who's that guy

1138
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,420
and i didn't realize it was him

1139
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,700
that's how secretive you've been being a i didn't even know we should have

1140
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,580
thought as being simple you know me

1141
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:51,180
There's two dead giveaways. One, I talked about my hair in the picture.

1142
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:53,980
I always talk about my hair, because I love it.

1143
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:57,380
Um, two, I said Sadness. That's another trademarked meme.

1144
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:00,380
Yes, Sadness I should have known.

1145
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:01,980
I should have known.

1146
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,840
Alright.

1147
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:09,380
Okay guys, I think what we're going to do now is I think we're going to take like one

1148
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:12,460
like quick break here, and then I think we're going to do a Maimani match game maybe.

1149
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,680
Let's do the cage match now actually.

1150
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,760
Let's do that.

1151
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,520
Let's drag this out as long as possible here.

1152
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:25,560
Anything else you want to say to your adoring fanboys and possible fangirls out there, Seagrid?

1153
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:33,520
Just keep reading and we'll be posting stuff as we normally do, and love me, please.

1154
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,600
So show Seagrid a little more love, and maybe he'll start dropping those hints later,

1155
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,160
if you'll show him some love.

1156
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:46,240
Okay, as soon as I queue it up here, we're going to get into the Orange Launch Radio cage match.

1157
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,480
the cage match for you guys that have never participated before you need to be

1158
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:54,040
in our chat room w w w dot orange on twitter dot com click on chat

1159
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,480
always in their completeness because there's so many new people i'm actually

1160
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,840
thinking i think we are at this is a so many new people i think we are to make

1161
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,420
an exception tonight and play the entirety

1162
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,800
winner from last week is is a really good song

1163
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,800
mean either way why not

1164
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,240
so we're gonna do that we're gonna be special because it was low keys where

1165
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:10,880
anyway

1166
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,020
the way to match works we pick three songs he chose the song

1167
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:16,860
And they're usually big dance hits or guitar hits or something.

1168
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:20,420
They're kind of songs that we think make good Bamani selections, or we just think

1169
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,560
they're really cool and we want to play them for you guys.

1170
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,980
You guys vote. Or we want to torture you sometimes. Sometimes we want to torture you, like when

1171
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:29,500
Jamie brings J-Lo. I should have picked Britney Spears this week. Or Britney.

1172
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,860
But the thing is, you're going to pick your favorite of the three songs, and that winning

1173
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:35,400
song goes into rotation all week long

1174
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,100
here on Orange Lounge Radio. So there's definitely a prize to be won here.

1175
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:42,880
Now, last week's winner is actually pretty cool because it's a remix done by

1176
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:47,720
our very own Loki and he remixed this song you might know it from DDR called

1177
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:52,400
ecstasy and it is an excellent remix it's won two weeks now and if it wins

1178
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,160
for four we're gonna have to retire it so it's halfway there let's see if it

1179
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:01,640
adds one more week on but oh yeah I gotta have the cage match music huh all

1180
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:10,240
right last week in the orange launch radio cage match oh all right last week

1181
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:14,020
nora's ontario cage match loki one with his pick it's uh... ecstasy and what did

1182
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:16,100
you read it this with your business

1183
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,860
explain what a match mix is real fast

1184
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:22,780
well i think if you're looking for most of the stuff that's out there it's

1185
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,540
crap but uh...

1186
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:28,300
no matter if it's just basically just uh... taking two songs

1187
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:30,060
not necessarily going down

1188
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:33,500
you're basically cutting loops and you know remixing it that way with loops

1189
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,920
but probably for a lot of people is that

1190
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,820
really bad rap because you know people to throw one song on top of it another

1191
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,780
you're basically making it goldway

1192
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:45,300
it's not like other crap though

1193
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:50,460
hopefully you know that that's a little bit better than

1194
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:53,700
this song should be in the art and the story i think they think that's going to

1195
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,980
be in the air

1196
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,300
and that's okay

1197
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,420
but anyway if you have to be mixed with uh... back home

1198
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:05,100
fred's art that got into the whole job in the first place uh...

1199
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,140
comfy

1200
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:08,540
uh... with himself working hard to get here

1201
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:12,700
one of the only two songs he's ever done the other one team level coming

1202
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:16,380
he was pretty popular back in the end of uh... the nineties beginning two

1203
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,500
thousand and he did that

1204
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:22,660
generally make anything anymore just the remixes but uh... you'll take a quick

1205
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:25,580
deal a lot with the citizens and uh...

1206
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,820
came uh... and also you know

1207
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,420
stuff on the fact that john

1208
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,980
something that uh...

1209
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:33,300
he kind of a drug actually

1210
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:40,300
All right, here it is. Less talking, more playing. Here it is, a Tomski versus D complex with ecstasy, 14 hours club mix. Enjoy.

1211
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:46,180
All right, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match, Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.

1212
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:50,020
And I think it's hilarious, because the people who can't hear the show right now are just

1213
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,700
in our chat room, and they can only see what we're posting.

1214
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:56,260
And I posted, you know, as I always do every week when we play the Cage Match songs, I

1215
01:30:56,260 --> 01:31:00,460
posted, song one, Ecstasy, 14 Hours Club Mix, and somebody's like, oh my god, they're announcing

1216
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,460
the song list!

1217
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:10,460
No, that is not a song. It's going to be extreme. It's a fan song and it's song number one you can vote for tonight.

1218
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:15,460
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is brought to us by Dark Zachrow. What did you pick tonight?

1219
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:18,460
I picked something by someone.

1220
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:22,460
Do you remember what you picked or do you need a reminder?

1221
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:31,460
I know what it takes. Oh yeah, M-Flow with the... move. Oh yeah, Astro Sexy.

1222
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:36,460
Alright. M-Flow is awesome. M-Flow is in DDR. Yes, M-Flow is in DDR.

1223

Alright. M-Flow with Astro Sexy, song number two in tonight's cage match. And if you like this, you can vote for it after we're all done here. Enjoy.

Spanish

1243
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:29,760
and flow chemistry

1244
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:30,780
you know what I'm saying

1245
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:32,620
it's a global astro alliance

1246
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:30,100
Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, M-Flow with Astro Sexy, and now

1247
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:32,720
we're gonna go around and see what everybody thought of that take out the

1248
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:37,240
inner Simon Cowell in us Jamie I love them flow now the whole I have to say

1249
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:40,820
there's a whole CD all together it's not a great that has some awesome tracks on

1250
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:44,800
it and that one it just it keeps getting interesting it keeps changing it up as

1251
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,700
the song goes on so it's a real progression through the whole song and I

1252
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:51,880
really love it so I'd have to say that wouldn't get you 10 it's not talked to

1253
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:56,820
Not taco yet, but you know it still gets a 10. All right, uh angel

1254
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,960
All right, um

1255
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,360
I don't know to me. It sounded like

1256
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:09,040
Half the time kind of dancey. So I really liked it. I say

1257
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,720
9.8

1258
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:19,520
Cuz I don't know why I'm going to do that, but I guess it's because I can all right. Yeah

1259
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,480
I don't even know

1260
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:38,480
As far as the progression, I liked that. I thought it was interesting. I was like, what's going on here?

1261
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:45,480
Because I could tell something was changing in the song. And it's definitely got that, what do you say, that punkishness.

1262
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:53,480
I was thinking of Move Your Feet, that those guys too. So, yeah. Yeah. You're seeing here.

1263
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:58,480
So I'd have to give it like, maybe a 7. A good song, but not my style.

1264
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:04,440
out. Alright, good song. 7. T-gird, um, what's your name?

1265
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:08,960
Cage Match? That's what we're doing? Yeah, were you even listening to Mplo? Yeah, cause

1266
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:14,120
I remember commenting on it. Alright. Um, I've heard that song, I really like it. It

1267
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:23,120
gets a 9. Alright. Is it going to be in DDR? Maybe. Alright, lowkey. That was awesome,

1268
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,120
I love it.

1269
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:27,760
Yeah, you know, it wasn't that bad.

1270
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,040
Usually I'm kind of am with Mplo, but that was fun.

1271
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,040
I give it an eight.

1272
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,040
I give it an eight.

1273
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,040
Fun, fun, good eight.

1274
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,040
All right.

1275
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,040
Our other voters in this vote.

1276
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,040
That's right.

1277
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,040
You know what?

1278
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,120
We're not the ones who depict the winner.

1279
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:42,800
You guys do out there in Listerland, and I'm sure you have nothing better to do while waiting

1280
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,120
for your reign, which we will get to like in like 15 minutes.

1281
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:48,880
We will make sure that you vote.

1282
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,160
The more votes, the faster we'll get there.

1283
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,480
No, we'll get it.

1284
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,480
Alright, one more song. Let's get to the last song, then.

1285
01:39:54,480 --> 01:40:00,480
My song, my pick this week is a group you also know from DDR, Four Strings.

1286
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,480
And they have a brand new single, and it's called Turn It Around.

1287
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:06,480
And so that's going to be my pick for the night. So enjoy.

1288
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,480
This is Four Strings, so turn it around.

1289
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:15,480
Turn it around baby, spend more time with me

1290
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:22,480
Try to believe you, try to believe you

1291
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:29,480
Turn it around baby, spend more time with me

1292
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:36,480
It's getting insane I know, let it not be true

1293
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,480
Turn it around baby

1294
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:47,480
Turn it around

1295
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:54,480
I need you

1296
01:40:55,480 --> 01:41:01,480
I can only be myself with you

1297
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:07,480
I can only be myself

1298
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:32,360
Turn it around, turn it around

1299
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:59,860
Turn it around, turn it around

1300
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:05,860
Turn it around baby, let us break the rules

1301
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:12,860
You know I need you, I need to feel you

1302
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:19,860
Turn it around baby, and find me

1303
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:26,860
Waiting for you babe, only for you babe

1304
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:31,860
I need you

1305
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:38,860
I can only be myself with you

1306
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:44,860
I can only be myself

1307
01:42:44,860 --> 01:43:08,860
Turn it around, turn it around

1308
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:36,860
Turn it around, turn it around.

1309
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:38,860
Come on, baby

1310
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:12,580
trans compilation. I'm just sort of transed out of it. I mean, I've been listening to

1311
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:16,540
a lot of trans lately because when I'm writing my stories it's easier to listen to trans

1312
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:20,180
while I'm writing. It was very good though. I love Four Strings. I'd have to give it about

1313
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:21,860
an eight and a half.

1314
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:26,700
Alright. Andrew, what did you think of that one? Pirate. Our local pirate. Oh, he didn't

1315
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,340
vote on the last one. Oh, he's gone. That's alright.

1316
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:33,100
Yeah, I've been in the bathroom for like the past three songs. I have no idea what's going

1317
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:44,220
on okay that's fine uh angel i'm stuck okay hi um jeez i'd probably stay an eight because

1318
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:49,580
i don't know i like the trans teenage i could probably i'm gonna go into this club and

1319
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:56,300
i have no idea where i'm going with this never mind all right on 110 oh i'm sorry i missed that

1320
01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:08,300
Hey, I like it a lot. I'm into trance. Uplifting trance is kind of a newer, happier kind of thing that's going on.

1321
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:16,300
So for uplifting, I guess, I think it categorizes that anyway. It's pretty good. I give it a 9. I'm into darker trance, but it's good.

1322
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,300
Okay, sounds good. Uh, Seagurd.

1323
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:24,300
Um, I heard that song earlier today, and I really don't like it, I'm sorry.

1324
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:29,300
Nausicaa is diving, which might be on Xtreme! Except it's already been announced, so yeah.

1325
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,300
I think it is on Xtreme, Seagurd. Even I do that, and I don't work for him.

1326
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:35,300
Um, yeah, I give it a 4.

1327
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:38,300
Aw, you suck. Alright, that's fine. Loki.

1328
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:43,300
I don't know, it was pretty good, but not as good as that trance remix that's on DDR Extreme.

1329
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:49,620
are extreme oh oh of another song another song there will be a trance

1330
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:59,500
remix of another song a word I'm gonna give that a I can't do that if it's

1331
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:06,860
that'd be too obvious I'm gonna give that seven all right I I think it's

1332
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:10,540
really a great song even though it is a little bit repetitive but I love it

1333
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:19,540
9. Is that a 9 in the German sense? 9!

1334
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:25,540
Alright, let's recap and then you guys can vote. Here we go. Remember, you can only vote through private message.

01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:38,780
how it works and then you click on you know you add orange on its radio to your

1359
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:42,340
list and then you can call us on the Skype line so I'm just gonna wait for

1360
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:45,080
for somebody to hopefully call us. And you can interact with the show this way. You could

1361
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:49,440
ask Seagrid something while he's here. Hey. Alright. Oh, we are getting a call. Here we

1362
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:59,440
go. Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Hello. Can you hear us? Hey, Sky's up. Yeah,

1363
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:03,540
I can. You're, you're dropping out, dude. Do you have porno torrents going? You gotta

1364
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:09,180
close them. No. Don't have anything going. Alright. You're very spotty right now, though.

1365
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:19,180
make sure, uh, you okay? Can you hear me fine? Ah, we lost him. Ah, we lost him. That's a

1366
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:23,460
bummer. Alright, I'll try it one more time. We'll see if we can get somebody in here.

1367
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:27,180
That's what happens when you get the, oh, we'll try it one more time, same person. Hi,

1368
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:32,040
you're on the radio. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you now. Okay, good. I think because

1369
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:36,580
I am on, I was dropping out. Who is this? There you go, this is Richie. Hi, Richie.

1370
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:37,980
Hey Rich, how ya doin'?

1371
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:42,260
Hey people, um, just wanna give out a few things about, uh, Xtreme.

1372
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:46,540
Um, I'm pretty excited for it to come out here to the U.S.

1373
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:51,040
Um, just gonna, like, check out the whole, uh, new iToy support, whatever they're gonna have for it.

1374
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:56,340
Um, but the main thing I'm mainly excited about is, uh, bringing Love Love Sugar to the U.S., so...

1375
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:00,340
I, I heard about Love Love Sugar. Yes, I know.

1376
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:03,940
Now, now, now the greatness of N.O.R.E.A. shall be spread throughout this country.

1377
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:11,940
Okay, I'm not ashamed to admit it. I am a Noria fanboy. I want her to have my children.

1378
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:24,940
Richie, do you have anything you want to say to us for withholding on this Your Rain thing for like two hours now for some people? Are we jerks, or is this what you'd expect from us?

1379
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:32,940
Well, I mean, just be patient, you know. I mean, just because, like, you know, we're going to review the song doesn't even want to play it right at the beginning of the show.

1380
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:45,940
And for the people who, you know, keep asking us to drop hints about what songs are going to be on Extreme or what new songs, you know, they can't say anything. It's the same thing, disclosure thing that they have.

1381
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:49,940
So basically, you're saying, you know what, there's a reason you're not getting hints yet.

1382
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:54,940
Yeah, there's rules. The man. It's the man. Blame it on the man.

1383
01:50:54,940 --> 01:51:00,940
I know. All I have to say is, they'll tell you when they can tell you. So, you know, just wait up. We'll be good.

1384
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:02,940
Good things come to people who wait.

1385
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:06,940
Alright. Alright, well thanks for calling. Have a good one.

1386
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:07,940
Bye.

1387
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:10,940
That was fun. I'm glad to hear from him.

1388
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:14,940
We'll see. I'll give the other folks a chance to call just a minute here.

1389
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:24,940
So, yeah, we're gonna do that debut of your reign, and then we'll go to the Mani Match Game.

1390
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:29,940
I think we haven't done that in a while, so I want to get to that, and then we're gonna go to the FUs of the Week.

1391
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:34,940
We're gonna have to kind of make it fast this week, though, so we may have to limit our chatroom FUs, especially with so many people listening.

1392
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:37,940
We are going to guard our angst for you.

1393
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:41,380
Again, if you guys have friends that are trying to get in and listen to the show and they

1394
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:46,780
can't get in right now, we will play the song again after the show at 9.40 and there might

1395
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:51,860
be other surprises too at that time, so stay tuned and we'll get that for you after the

1396
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:52,860
show.

1397
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:55,740
For anyone listening in the chat room, please make an announcement for us that we will be

1398
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:57,380
playing the song again after the show.

1399
01:51:57,380 --> 01:52:01,040
Alright, yes, we'll play it again at 9.40 so those that weren't able to get in now can

1400
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,040
get in.

1401
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:05,320
Alright, nobody else is calling on Skype line so I think maybe it's about time for us to

1402
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,320
get to it.

1403
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:09,920
You've waited long enough. Yeah, you guys have waited long enough, but

1404
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:13,240
but first I want to just give some

1405
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:16,840
shout outs about this because I do definitely want to thank the folks at

1406
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:18,200

01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:36,280
hugs for us here at Orange Lounge for getting this for us.

1412
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:43,240
Alright, and just thanks a lot to you guys because, you know, it helped us get a lot

1413
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,240
of exposure.

1414
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:48,520
We've been doing this radio show for about two years now, and some folks are just finding

1415
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,580
out about us tonight, even though we've been doing it for two years.

1416
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:51,580
And you know what?

1417
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:55,340
It may not be your cup of tea, but hey, thanks for checking us out, but if you did like us,

1418
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:57,160
we do the same shit every week.

1419
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,160
And you know what?

1420
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:59,160
Every Sunday we do our talks.

1421
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:02,720
Some weeks we don't have a song to be teasing, so it's even crazier.

1422
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:06,040
Thank God you weren't here for the show where I sang, okay?

1423
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,640
That was bad enough.

1424
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:08,640
You're staying in?

1425
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:12,120
We do have karaoke revolution 2, we've still got a cover at some point.

1426
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:13,120
No!

1427
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,120
Alright, alright.

1428
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:19,160
But seriously, also keep in mind we've got our remix show on Monday, Diversion, which

1429
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:23,040
Rob is gracious and has fun with.

1430
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:27,380
And then my show is on Tuesday, where if you're hanging out in our chat room, then whatever

1431
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:30,820
you request, Bemani or not, if I have it, I'll play it, and you can even send it to

1432
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:34,240
me if you really want to hear it broadcast on the show, as long as I don't think it's

1433
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,240
a piece of crap.

1434
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:38,240
I'm flexible. Don't suck, I'll play it.

1435
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:39,240
Maybe you'll play your rain again.

1436
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,240
Maybe.

1437
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:41,240
Maybe we can work that out.

1438
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,240
Maybe.

1439
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:48,240
And then Wednesday, coming back very soon, Vanilla Sky, my show where we talk about random video game stuff.

1440
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:54,240
We just have to retool it a little bit. But hopefully soon. I might do something this week, we'll see. I don't know.

1441
01:53:54,240 --> 01:54:01,240
And maybe, sometime in the future, I'll do my show.

1442
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:02,240
Alright.

1443
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:17,240
That's a very, very, very, um, there's a.5 chance, you know, somewhere around the 99 area that, cut it out, cut it out.

1444
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:26,240
Alright, anything else anybody wants to say before we do? This is our big moment you guys, we're never going to have this captive audience ever again, so anybody want to say anything?

1445
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:28,240
I have an important announcement.

1446
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,240
Yes.

1447
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,240
I like alcohol.

1448
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:35,240
Does anybody need to come out of the closet here on the show?

1449
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:40,240
Loki is actually running in the closet.

1450
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,240
Alright.

1451
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:44,240
Um, yeah, I have something.

1452
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:45,240
Rob?

1453
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:46,240
Yes.

1454
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:47,240
Rob?

1455
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:48,240
What?

1456
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:49,240
Rob?

1457
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:50,240
What?

1458
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,240
Rob?

1459
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:52,240
What?

1460
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:53,240
Rob?

1461
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,240
What?

1462
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,240
What?

1463
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:56,240
We are forgetting the something.

1464
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:57,240
Oh Jesus.

1465
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:58,240
That was scary.

1466
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,240
It was in unison.

1467
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:00,240
They're getting restless.

1468
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,240
They're about to punch us in the face.

1469
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:08,240
Alright, alright, here we go.

1470
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:10,240
Forget it, forget it, alright.

1471
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:12,240
I love you.

1472
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,240
Alright, you guys ready?

1473
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,240
I'm ready.

1474
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,240
You ready to hear this?

1475
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:17,240
Are we ready?

1476
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,240
Alright.

1477
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:23,240
Alright, we are going to do right now the world debut of Your Rain, The Rage Mix.

1478
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,240
So enjoy everybody.

1479
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:35,240
Your Rain, The Rage Mix made possible by www.orangeloundsradio.com and www.drspot.com. Enjoy!

1480
01:55:55,240 --> 01:56:06,240
Out of my head, and I don't know what I found

1481
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:17,240
Over and over, I fear to break me down

1482
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:27,240
I'm waiting for a gentle wind, a gentle wind, a gentle wind

1483
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:32,240
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets, just a whisper

1484
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:37,240
Busy people, going nowhere, seeing dark in the rain

1485
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:42,240
Nothing but passion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

1486
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:48,240
Rain in like a flower in a basement waiting for our love

1487
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:52,240
Yeah

1488
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:57,240
Orange Lounge Radio brings you a world premiere of Your Rain, the Rage Mix

1489
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:58,240
What'd you guys think?

1490
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,240
That was sexy!

1491
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:05,240
I can't believe people have been waiting like two and a half hours for that one minute song

1492
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:09,240
But there it is, it's actually a minute twenty-nine is what that song clocks in as

1493
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,240
What'd you guys think? Dark Sakura?

1494
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:13,240
It was sexy, I still like the original better, but it was sexy.

1495
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:15,240
It was hot.

1496
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:17,240
It was very hot.

1497
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:19,240
It was hot. It's like, slow.

1498
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:24,240
It's my favorite Akira song, hands down. It's my favorite Yamaoka song, hands down.

1499
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:26,240
Cool.

1500
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:27,240
Yeah, I agree.

1501
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:35,240
What did you guys think? Andrew, you haven't really been, I don't know how much you've been following this fandom, or how big a DDR fanboy you are, but what did you think of that?

1502
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:36,240
What did you think of that?

1503
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:37,520
Well, I like that song.

1504
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:39,500
I think it's going to be pretty interesting to play.

1505
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:44,000
It sounds slow as hell, so I'm definitely going to have to bar rape that at 5x or something

1506
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
when I play that.

1507
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,920
Or excuse me, chair rape that at home, I guess.

1508
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:51,960
But yeah, that sounds pretty good.

1509
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:52,960
I like that.

1510
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:53,960
It sounds interesting.

1511
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:54,960
Alright.

1512
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:55,960
Angel.

1513
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:00,800
Yeah, like he just said, I'm totally going to have to speed mod that, because I really

1514
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,840
suck at slow songs.

1515
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:07,840
Well, I speed mod. I don't know if that makes me a loser or not, though.

1516
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:12,840
Since I call myself DDR Angel, maybe I shouldn't speed mod anymore.

1517
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,840
Okay, I'm not funny.

1518
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:20,840
I can see Wendell freestyling to this right now.

1519
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:23,840
It's a very freestylable song.

1520
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:28,840
I can see the butt shots and the kisses and everything.

1521
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:33,840
The video was great. We were able to actually see the video at E3 and play the song and the steps.

1522
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,840
The steps were pretty good, I gotta say. I think it was only like a six, but it was fun.

1523
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:41,840
The video, they made a custom video for it based around Silent Hill characters.

1524
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,840
And I gotta say, you guys, if you haven't looked at our picture gallery...

1525
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,840
It was a good video.

1526
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:48,840
Look at the picture gallery on our website. Just sign up for our website. It's free. We don't send you spam.

1527
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:52,840
Sign up for the website, and there's pictures. Dark Sakura has a gallery. I have a gallery.

1528
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:57,840
And Seagurd even has a gallery on there. It says Mikolatov, but it's actually Seagurd's photo gallery.

1529
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,840
All these pictures from E3.

1530
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:03,840
Also, just to expand upon the video information.

1531
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:08,840
In the video, you'll see Cynthia from Silent Hill 4 and Henry from Silent Hill 4.

1532
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:12,840
And then some backup dancers, and they are not in Silent Hill 4.

1533
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:15,840
There is no dancing in Silent Hill 4.

1534
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:17,840
Alright.

1535
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,840
Unless you count writhing as dancing around when you're being eaten to death.

1536
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:27,840
I've actually seen this song, the video for the song, in a lot of these preview videos.

1537
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,140
I do wish, though, that they were dancing in Silent Hill, because then I could have

1538
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:32,140
Pyramid Head dance.

1539
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:35,080
That'd be the best thing ever.

1540
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:36,080
All right.

1541
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,080
Those of you guys...

1542
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:39,400
I would like to see the disembodied heads in the wheelchairs dance.

1543
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:41,920
I know some of you guys are probably dropping the stream right now, so I just wanted to

1544
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,840
say to you guys that, later the two hours later, hey, check us out again sometime.

1545
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:48,520
I hope you guys enjoyed it, and check us out again sometime, and thanks for stopping by

1546
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:49,520
Orange Orange Radio.

1547
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:50,520
Because we're beautiful people.

1548
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:51,520
The show's not done.

1549
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:56,020
I know there's some people that didn't want to have to sit through all this to hear that song, but you did, so thank you.

1550
01:59:56,020 --> 02:00:04,020
What does our resident arcade building genius think of it? Because we didn't ask his opinion.

1551
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:06,020
Yeah, what did you think, Loki?

1552
02:00:06,020 --> 02:00:08,020
Eh.

1553
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:18,020
You know, I think, you know, it's nice that Akira Yamaoka's doing songs and remixing them for DDR, but eh.

1554
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:23,620
I don't care for that stupid fucking, um, was it, just shit?

1555
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:28,220
Um, I don't know, I don't care for that R&B crap that they have right there.

1556
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:34,620
Um, you know, give me a good, um, a Kiriyamaoka hard, um, heavy metal fucking track from Contra.

1557
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:36,820
That's the shit that I want in DDR.

1558
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:41,620
You know, fucking hard heavy metal guitars yelling, screaming, none of this.

1559
02:00:41,620 --> 02:00:47,220
I'm a survivor! I'm a survivor! Like, give me dancing! I'm a remix of a song!

1560
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:53,220
It's really stupid. I want the heavy metal. I mean, that's the shit that I want in there.

1561
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:59,220
Fuck, if they had a US Guitar Freaks, that would be awesome.

1562
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:04,220
There will not be a US Guitar Freaks, just making that clear.

1563
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:10,220
Alright, I think we're gonna go to a break, and those of you guys that wanted to drop, go ahead.

1564
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:13,220
So the other people can get in. Remember, we are gonna play the song again a little later.

1565
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:16,220
We're gonna do a Monty Match Game when we come back. Let's do that. It'll be fun.

1566
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:17,220
Have fun.

1567
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:18,220
Alright, we're going to do that.

1568
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:19,220
And I'm going to tell you guys who won the cage match.

1569
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:20,220
I'm going to tally up those votes, too.

1570
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:21,700
I'm going to do something really cool though during the break.

1571
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:22,700
What's that?

1572
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:23,700
Fold my laundry.

1573
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:24,700
Have fun.

1574
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:27,780
And in this break, I think we're actually going to play songs from Max2USA.

1575
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:28,780
I think that would be fun.

1576
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:33,500
So we're going to play some Max2USA songs, because, you know, I feel like hearing them.

1577
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:34,500
Don't you guys feel like hearing them?

1578
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,500
Yeah.

1579
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:36,500
Yeah, sure.

1580
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,500
Alright.

1581
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:44,500
so let's hear those songs and we'll be back

1582
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:16,500
I didn't know what I'd do When there was you and me

1583
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:27,500
And everything went so wrong tonight And the stars came up in the sky

1584
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:32,500
And the music too, playing really through My mind in your love

1585
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:39,500
It's so sad, cause baby when I heard you cry

1586
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:46,500
The world's worse than I knew you were meant to be

1587
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:54,500
Oh, baby when I heard you cry

1588
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:59,500
The world's worse than I knew you were

1589
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:08,500
I want you to be in my way

1590
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:23,500
Will I ever love you again?

1591
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:30,500
Will we be together again?

1592
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:36,500
Thought the love we had was strong

1593
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:40,500
Tell me what's wrong

1594
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:44,500
Where did we go wrong?

1595
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:17,500
Will I, will I, will I?

1596
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:24,500
Will I, will I, will I?

1597
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:31,500
Will I ever love you again?

1598
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:38,500
Will we be together again?

1599
02:04:38,500 --> 02:05:06,500
Tell me what's wrong, where did we go wrong?

1600
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:14,500
Shining night, another day turns into night

1601
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:20,500
Tunnel fire, waiting all my life

1602
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:27,500
Take me away, million miles away from here

1603
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:34,500
Take me away, find a place for you and me

1604
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:41,500
You're taking me higher, high as I could be

1605
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:47,500
Take me away, forever you and me

1606
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:49,500
Take me away

1607
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:01,500
Take me away

1608
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:08,500
A million miles away from me, take me away

1609
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:15,500
The final place of you and me is shaking higher

1610
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:22,500
As high as I could see, take me away

1611
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:48,420
Hey, I'm happy.

1612
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:50,020
A lot of you guys decided to stay on.

1613
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:52,380
Thank you guys for listening to us and supporting us.

1614
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:59,140
makes me a happy boy. You're happy! I am. We're about ready to play the match game,

1615
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:02,140
the Bimani match game. This is a fun little segment. We haven't done it in a long time

1616
02:07:02,140 --> 02:07:06,980
either, so this is going to be something. But, Jamie, could you explain how the match

1617
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:10,700
game works, because I'm trying to look for our theme song. This is the precursor to Mad

1618
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:15,340
Libs, honestly, if you think about it. Basically, we have two contestants. In this case, we're

1619
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:20,500
going to have somebody from one of our listeners call in on the Skype line, and then our newest

1620
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:27,020
guest on the show be our contestants. Basically, you're going to be read a sentence and at

1621
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:31,360
the end of it, the one word will be replaced with a blank and you have to fill in the blank.

1622
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:36,000
Of course, the object is, as it's called the match game, you have to match us while we

1623
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,860
think of something. And no, the answer is not propel.

1624
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:44,300
All right. Because you know what? Every game, the answer

1625
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:49,740
was always propel. And I don't drink propel anymore. Propel is no longer a sponsor of

1626
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:54,740
We're now sponsored by Dr. Atkins, even though he's dead.

1627
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:59,740
I don't know about that. I can't say I'm into that, but okay.

1628
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:04,740
Well, I don't know. Because of that, there's less of me to be here.

1629
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:09,740
That and working my ass off.

1630
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:14,740
I've been trying to find the match game song clips because I lost it when I did my reinstall.

1631
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:21,740
since we've done match game I gotta say so we need a new match game thing okay

1632
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:25,700

1633
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:30,100
difference okay okay then I'll just I'll find some porn music. Play the Price is Right music!

1634
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:34,260

1635

1638
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:55,900
pieces now Andrew doesn't get a piece of paper because he's gonna be our

1639
02:08:55,900 --> 02:09:01,860
contestant and for contestant number two we're gonna open up the skype line and

1640
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:06,660
we'll see who gives us a call over on the skype line I'm gonna write all over

1641
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:11,560
over hello kitty's face. You should do that. I'm hoping somebody will call in the skype

1642
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:14,140
line. Nobody calls in the skype line. We're going to have to take one of our chatters

1643
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:19,940
and I don't know if I want to do that. Somebody's got to call us in the skype line. Oh no, that

1644
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:26,940
piece of paper? It has clues as to what's an extreme. Let's see. Oh shit. I'm writing

1645
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:34,120
on the back of the extreme. Be rare. My bad. I've got a copy list that says milk, cheese,

1646
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:36,120
Hold on, I've got to shut this guy off.

1647
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:38,120
Hello, can you hear us? You're on Orange Town's radio.

1648
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:40,120
Hello.

1649
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:42,120
Hello, hello, hello.

1650
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:44,120
Hello.

1651
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:46,120
We cannot hear you. Sorry, buddy.

1652
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:48,120
Dismissed.

1653
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:50,120
Let's see if we can answer this one. Hello. Oh, I missed that one.

1654
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:52,120
Hello? Hello? Hello, you there?

1655
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:54,120
Yes, I am here. Oh, hello, Richie!

1656
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:56,120
You just got in. Somebody else

1657
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:58,120
was in and then they dropped

1658
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:00,120
because we couldn't hear them, so

1659
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,120
Richie, you're it. Can you guys hear me good?

1660
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:04,120
Yeah, we can hear you good, too. Sorry to the other guy.

1661
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:07,120
Oh, you found the theme song, Loki. Oh, I'm so proud. Play the theme song.

1662
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:09,120
We have to play it in between, anyway.

1663
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:11,120
Yeah, we have to. We'll play it in between.

1664
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:15,120
Ah. Much better. Much better. Can you hear that?

1665
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:17,120
Oh, God. Yeah, I can hear all of it.

1666
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:19,120
All right. Turn it down. Turn it down. Turn it off.

1667
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:22,120
All right. Here we go. Question number one is nice.

1668
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:24,120
You know how the match game works, right, Richie?

1669
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:26,120
Yeah. All right. I know how this works.

1670
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:30,120
All right. Here we go. Question number one.

1671
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:42,760
Jamie was sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad

1672
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:47,800
when she would try and play DDR. One day one of them tripped right in front of her as they

1673
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:53,640
tried to run by. Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you kid. Blank.

1674
02:10:53,640 --> 02:11:02,000
That's when you play a song, there you go.

1675
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,840
You have to think of what would be in the blank.

1676
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:09,000
Now we can't.

1677
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,120
Jamie was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and

1678
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:15,880
the pad when she would try and play DDR.

1679
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:18,880
One day one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.

1680
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:25,880
taking a look at the house that i've got one word for you can

1681
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:37,920
all right with the thing i mean

1682
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:39,720
was not in the morning

1683
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:41,720
Alright, see you're all extorted.

1684
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:43,720
You got ten seconds.

1685
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:50,720
Alright, alright, stop the music. Let's see.

1686
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:52,720
Alright, Richie, you still there with us?

1687
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:53,720
Yeah, I am.

1688
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:54,720
Alright, Richie.

1689
02:11:54,720 --> 02:12:00,720
Jamie was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad when she would try and play DDR.

1690
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:03,720
One day, one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.

1691
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:06,720
Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you, kid.

1692
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:07,720
Owned.

1693
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:11,000
owned. All right, Richie says

1694
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,520
owned. Let's see what his opponent, Andrew, has to say.

1695
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:18,920
Andrew, I've got one word for you, kid. I think it's also

1696
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:21,960
bitch is one of the chatters. Bitch!

1697
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:25,640
All right, bitch is the other one. All right, let's see. We got all our...

1698
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:29,040
Now we write these down on paper, so let's see.

1699
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:33,340
Let's go around and see what some of our persons said here. Let's start off with

1700
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:33,880
Jamie.

1701
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:37,520
Jamie, what would you have said? I've got one word for you, kid.

1702
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:43,520
Oops. Oops is not a match. Sorry. Uh, DDRholic, what'd you say?

1703
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:46,520
I'm not too creative today. Doctor.

1704
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:51,520
Doctor. Okay, that would be the nice thing to say. Unfortunately, the question was about Jamie.

1705
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:55,520
Everybody boo DDRholic. Boo. I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

1706
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,520
I wouldn't do that, but okay.

1707
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,520
Angel.

1708
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:58,520
Um, okay.

1709
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:00,520

02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,280
I came up with hardly anything so I went with propel

1720
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:34,680
even though we said it's not it's not that all hell

1721
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:42,680
Alright. Propel. Alright. Loki, I've got one word for you, kid. Classic.

1722
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:48,680
I would say that. Classic. I said, I've got one word for you, kid. Abstinence.

1723
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:56,680
That's beautiful. I think I'd say that too. No, no matches. No matches.

1724
02:13:56,680 --> 02:14:00,680
They're talking to their parents. Was that your second answer, Richie?

1725
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:04,120
What? Was that his abstinence? Was that your second answer maybe?

1726
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:08,200
No, but more like, uh, ha ha, or

1727
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:12,320
I don't know. I'm not feeling creative tonight. That's alright. Alright, let's go on to question number two then.

1728
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:17,160
Alright, it's all tied up. Nothing, nothing. Here we go. Second question.

1729
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:20,760
Get the music ready. Alright. Loki

1730
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:25,040
was getting sick and tired of the fact that whenever Andrew went to golf land

1731
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:26,080
dressed as a pirate,

1732
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:30,660
he got all the crowds watching him play DDR. In order to upstage

1733
02:14:30,660 --> 02:14:35,660
him and get the attention back. Loki decided to show up dressed as a blank.

1734
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:40,660
Oh, this one's going to be exciting.

1735
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:59,660
That music, for some reason, makes me want chicken.

1736
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:15,340
Alright, we're going to start off with Andrew this time, and hey, it would be upstaging

1737
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:16,820
you, what would Loki have to do?

1738
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:19,020
Loki showed up dressed as a...?

1739
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:22,620
I'm going to say Barwench, because I think he'd make a very sexy one.

1740
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:23,620
Barwench!

1741
02:15:23,620 --> 02:15:24,620
Yeah.

1742
02:15:24,620 --> 02:15:25,620
Barwench is Andrew's answer.

1743
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:28,900
Let's see what the competitor Richie has to say.

1744
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:35,540
as a... French maid. French maid! Well gee, this is a... That's a surprise coming from

1745
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:41,300
Richie, alright. Let's see if we've got a match. Jamie, dressed as a... I finally saw

1746
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:47,420
this, so you'll laugh at me. Dressed as Divine's role as Edna in Hairspray. Very nice, dressed

1747
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:51,100
as Divine, and nobody in the scene is ever going to get that joke, but that's okay. Uh,

1748
02:15:51,100 --> 02:16:03,100
your holic. Loki's gonna show up dressed as an Oscar Meyer wiener. You're gay. And it's

1749
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:07,680
okay for me to say that. Alright, uh, Angel showed up. Okay, this is completely unlikely

1750
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:12,220
to say, but I got to just because it's running, it's playing on words. I said you dress up

1751
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:19,860
as a cock. No, not that one! Dressed up as a cock, alright. Segerd. Segerd, uh, Loki

1752
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:25,140
in order to upstage him. Showed up dressed as a? Penis. Penis! You could have gotten

1753
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:29,140
two points! Going for the dick joke. Alright, Loki. What would you have to do? You'd have

1754
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:34,260
to show up dressed up as a? I'd have to dress up as Osama Bin Laden because he fucking rocks

1755
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:42,780
the DDR. Wow. Wow, okay. Well that would certainly get you attention. Or as a Nazi. A Nazi would

1756
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:48,060
rock too. Or if we can combine them all, we would have to have like a white hood with

1757
02:16:48,060 --> 02:16:53,940
the turban and then maybe a swastika paid in on that it could be like the the

1758
02:16:53,940 --> 02:17:01,700
Antichrist I don't know the yeah I don't get it yeah whatever that was stupid I

1759
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:08,580
sorry for wasting your 30 seconds I said in order to upstage Loki would show up

1760
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:13,140
dressed as a crack whore and when in doubt crack whore you guys crack whore

1761
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:15,620
universal joke

1762
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:18,800
but then i just blend into the crowd

1763
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:22,620
uh... i didn't think of that you would you totally get in the car and i said

1764
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:24,060
there's almost a ninja

1765
02:17:24,060 --> 02:17:26,820
because if you ever gone to realtimmapower.net

1766
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:31,060
don't you know that the mortal enemy of all ninjas are pirates

1767
02:17:31,060 --> 02:17:33,460
an l-shaped tetris block

1768
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:34,960
that would be awesome

1769
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:37,340
that would be so bad

1770
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,100

when rock came home from work and follow keys main cabinet

1775
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:54,380
he the first thing you thought to himself was g now that the thing is in

1776
02:17:54,380 --> 02:17:59,640
my house i can play nothing but blank all day long

1777
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:01,880
and may not be the obvious choice right

1778
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:08,880
I can play nothing but blank all day long. Music.

1779
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:32,120
That heavy breathing gets so dreamy on me.

1780
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:38,640
I'm teasing you, Richie.

1781
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:44,640
Alright. Oh, Richie. Dang. Yes. Alright. Richie's first this time, right?

1782
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:47,640
Richie, you're giving me a boner. Stop it. Alright.

1783
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:50,640
Hey Rob. Yeah? Um, no. Alright.

1784
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:54,640
What if Rob dressed up as a maid for you?

1785
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:56,640
I don't know.

1786
02:18:56,640 --> 02:19:01,640
Wouldn't you even get like a little bit of a boner? Like a half boner? Like a bone?

1787
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:04,640
Um, no. Alright, alright.

1788
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:08,640
Alright, you're dropping out there, buddy. Careful, we gotta hear you for this answer though, alright?

1789
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:14,640
Uh, here we go. Gee, now that this thing is in my house, I can play nothing but blank all day long. What?

1790
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:22,640
Okay, I was really gonna say, do you like horny bunnies, but then I'm gonna go into the chatroom and say, uh, um, girls panic.

1791
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:33,640
Gals panic. Gals panic. Alright, gals panic is what, uh, what he said, Richie. Andrew, what do you think? He's gonna stay home and play blank all day long.

1792
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:37,080
blank all day long. I think he's going to stay home and play with himself because that

1793
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:41,200
way Loki will be over here playing mad. And that way he doesn't feel awkward when he's

1794
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,520
doing it and Loki comes in and watches him like normal so I think it will be a lot more

1795
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:49,480
comfortable for Ross. Alright, so Andrew says he's just going to play with himself. Screw

1796
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:53,040
the machine, I'm going to play with myself. Alright, that's a very good answer actually.

1797
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:58,500
Alright, Jamie, I'm going to stay home and play Burger Time. Burger Time! The chat room

1798
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:02,500
Who was trying to get you guys to say it? Burger Time! Alright, let's see...

1799
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:05,500
Uh... DDR-Holic.

1800
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:12,500
Okay. Um, and by the way, for those of you who don't know, it's DDR-Coholic, but I let Rob call me Holic.

1801
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:14,500
Sorry, sorry. DDR-Coholic.

1802
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:17,500
No, that's your name for me. That's your name for me. Okay.

1803
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:20,500
I just like Holic.

1804
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:22,500
Okay, I thought that low-key would love...

1805
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:26,500
Richie! Hold on, Richie! Enough with the heavy breathing. You're turning me on over here.

1806
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:28,500
I know, I'm getting all wet and stuff.

1807
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:29,500
I know.

1808
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:32,500
Wait, you are over 18, right?

1809
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:34,500
Yes, I'm turning 21 in here.

1810
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:35,500
Oh boy, that's hot.

1811
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:36,500
Alright.

1812
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:37,500
Okay.

1813
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:38,500
Alright.

1814
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:39,500
I'm sorry.

1815
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:40,500
Decide to stay home and play?

1816
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:41,500
And play Q-Bert!

1817
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:42,500
Q-Bert!

1818
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:43,500
Good answer!

1819
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:45,500
Q-Bert is a game I would play all day long.

1820
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:47,500
DDR Angel, what would you say?

1821
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:48,500
What were you going to call me?

1822
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:50,500
I almost said DDRcholic again.

1823
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:52,500
DDR Angel.

1824
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:53,500
Pole Position.

1825
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:54,500
Pole Position!

1826
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,500
All these are great answers.

1827
02:20:55,500 --> 02:21:01,280
answers. I would play Pulp Position all day long. Seagurd. It's only because I saw it

1829
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:14,300
Alright, Ritchie gets a point. Alright. Loki. He decided to stay home and play. And we wonder

1830
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:19,780
why we don't play this game, you know, all the time. Anyways, no, the answer would be

1831
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:28,880
miss mr. miss oh there's a miss mr. nude world 96 that's right that is that's a

1832
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:33,700
miss world 96 with the boys in it instead of the girls yes good answer my

1833
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:38,720
answer was actually my answer was I would stay home and play miss world 96

1834
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:42,440
nude actually I also said that except I didn't say the mr. version because that

1835
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:45,640
version is broken and it keeps crashing so I just wanted to play the version

1836
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:49,200

02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:09,680
siegert can become very tired after having to be a konami slave all day long

1841
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:16,320
luckily konami takes care of its employees and keeps siegert a very happy boy with all

1842
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:23,320
of the free blank. Music. Keep Segerd a very happy boy with all of the free blank.

1843
02:22:46,320 --> 02:23:01,480
Oh, okay. I guess it's done. All right, let's see what everybody thought. Starting off with

1844
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:06,240
our contestants. Segerd can become very tired after having to be a Konami slave all day

1845
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:09,600
long. Luckily, Konami takes care of its employees and keeps Segerd a very happy boy with all

1846
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,880
of the free... Andrew?

1847
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:14,400
I'm going to say something like caffeine or coffee or something like that.

1848
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:15,400
Okay, free...

1849
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:17,400
Free coffee, let's say. Free coffee.

1850
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:18,400
Okay, okay.

1851
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:19,400
What?

1852
02:23:19,400 --> 02:23:20,400
Free stimulants.

1853
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:21,400
Yes, stimulants is good.

1854
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:22,400
All right.

1855
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:24,400
Richie, you there?

1856
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:25,400
Yes.

1857
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:26,400
All right.

1858
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:27,400
Yes, I am.

1859
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:29,400
They're going to keep Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free...

1860
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:30,400
Blowjobs.

1861
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:31,400
Blowjobs!

1862
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:34,400
All right, let's see if anybody gets a match.

1863
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,400
Okay, I didn't know...

1864
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:37,400
Oh, maybe I should go work for Konami.

1865
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:38,400
All right.

1866
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:41,400
Jamie keeps him a happy boy with all of the free...

1867
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:43,400
Politary torture sessions.

1868
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:46,600
Politary Torture Set! That wouldn't make me happy!

1869
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:48,600
That would make me sad.

1870
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:50,600
Alright.

1871
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:54,600
Keep Seagrid a very happy boy with all of the free.

1872
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,600
Did you get a hug?

1873
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:57,600
Uh, how about Red Bull?

1874
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:58,600
Red Bull!

1875
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:02,600
That's, that's a match. I think it's a match with the stimulants. Good job.

1876
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:04,600
Good job. Alright, it's all tied up now.

1877
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:05,600
Alright.

1878
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:08,600
Let's see, Angel.

1879
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:10,600
She's still writing. Come on, you're still writing.

1880
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:11,600
Shut up!

1881
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:14,000
all of the free junk

1882
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,840
junk because I didn't know what to put

1883
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:18,000
I blame I know

1884
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,400
all right all right

1885
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:21,860
that's all right no worries

1886
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:22,820
okay

1887
02:24:22,820 --> 02:24:24,240
Seegard

1888
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:26,240
they keep you happy with all of the free

1889
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:30,360
okay everybody would have thought I would say a kiriyama oka anything

1890
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:34,440
but no I put suikoden yaoi fan fix

1891
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:37,160
suikoden yaoi fan fix

1892
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:39,360
that'd make me happy

1893
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:40,440
Loki

1894
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:46,180
All of the free... I said stimulants, and when I mean stimulants, I mean Karayamaoka

1895
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:51,800
porn. All of the home videos you don't get to see.

1896
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:56,560
All right. I don't think that's a match, though. Sorry, a different kind of stimulant. All

1897
02:24:56,560 --> 02:25:03,000
right. My answer was, keep secret a very happy boy with all of the free grape-feeding men

1898
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,700
and togas. That sounds pretty stimulating.

1899
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:11,580
Don't they have that room at Konami with all the great painting men and the togas?

1900
02:25:11,580 --> 02:25:13,380
They're still looking for hints.

1901
02:25:13,380 --> 02:25:16,500
Oh my God, Toga, that's a song.

1902
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:17,500
All right.

1903
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:18,500
Let's see.

1904
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:19,500
Moving on.

1905
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:20,500
Last question, guys.

1906
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:21,500
Last question, guys.

1907
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:22,500
You ready?

1908
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:23,500
All right.

1909
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:24,500
Let's go.

1910
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:26,220
See, now this question isn't as funny anymore.

1911
02:25:26,220 --> 02:25:29,980
I was going to do it before the big premiere, but just imagine we haven't done your reign

1912
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:30,980
yet.

1913
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:31,980
Okay?

1914
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:33,980
Here it is.

1915
02:25:33,980 --> 02:25:38,060
When we told the listeners that it was all a big joke, and we weren't actually going

1916
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:43,060
to play Your Rain Tonight, the first thing the listeners did was blank the hosts.

1917
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:44,060
Music.

1918
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:45,060
Porn music.

1919
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:56,060
I swear this one makes me think like it should also be for a chicken commercial.

1920
02:25:56,060 --> 02:26:03,060
I guess we think it should also be for a chicken commercial.

1921
02:26:22,380 --> 02:26:24,780
Alright, here it is. Tiebreaker. Here's your chance.

1922
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:33,780
I'm going to start with Richie this time. Richie, when we told the listeners that it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play Your Rain tonight, the first thing the listeners did was blank the host.

1923
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:37,780
Was to have spicy hot orgasms with the host.

1924
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:43,780
Spicy hot orgasms! Interesting. Alright, let's see. Andrew, first thing they were going to do was what to the host?

1925
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:50,780
Well, tie them up and force them to listen to Good Charlotte and Linkin Park, which is more punishing than anything I can think of.

1926
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:54,500
Oh yeah, that's pretty bad. Alright. Oh, wow, okay. Let's see if we get a match.

1927
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:57,580
Jamie, they decided to blank the host.

1928
02:26:57,580 --> 02:27:02,940
Mooned. Mooned! They made us look at their... On their webcams. On their webcams.

1929
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:06,180
Good answer. Not a match. DDRHolic.

1930
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:10,660
Uh, this might be close to the steamy orgasms. Um, queefed?

1931
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:14,140
I don't think so. I think that's...

1932
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:18,020
I think that's a little bit different. Are you sure? I think it's a little different, honey.

1933
02:27:18,020 --> 02:27:18,520
No, okay.

1934
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,320
A little different, honey.

1935
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:19,820
Okay.

1936
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:20,320
All right.

1937
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:22,320
DDR Angel, they decided to...

1938
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:24,020
Flash naughty bits on a webcam.

1939
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:26,320
Flash naughty bits on their webcam to the host.

1940
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:28,320
No, doesn't work, sorry, but...

1941
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:30,320
Seagurd!

1942
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:31,320
Richie!

1943
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:32,320
Yes?

1944
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:34,320
Stop, you're making me...

1945
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:35,320
Later!

1946
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:36,320
Oh!

1947
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:38,320
Later!

1948
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:41,320
I was boring, and I just said murdered the host.

1949
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:42,320
Murdered.

1950
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:44,020
Oh, that was a good answer.

1951
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:45,820
All right, Loki.

1952
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:47,820
Banned from DDR freak.

1953
02:27:48,820 --> 02:27:50,820
That would be awfully hard.

1954
02:27:50,820 --> 02:27:53,820
Considering one of our hosts is a moderator, that would be kind of hard.

1955
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:55,820
Unless it was April Fool's time again, huh?

1956
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:57,820
That was a hilarious joke.

1957
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:58,820
Did I ever tell you that?

1958
02:27:58,820 --> 02:27:59,820
Alright.

1959
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:04,820
Hey Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1960
02:28:04,820 --> 02:28:05,820
Bitch, what?

1961
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:08,820
Fine, I won't tell you.

1962
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:11,820
Is it a hint?

1963
02:28:11,820 --> 02:28:12,820
Is it a hint?

1964
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:14,820
The hint is the new ferret mix.

1965
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:26,820
Alright, here it is. My answer. When we told the listeners it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play Your Rain tonight, the first thing the listeners did was give money to the hosts because that's what I need them to do.

1966
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:27,820
Oh, buy them.

1967
02:28:27,820 --> 02:28:29,820
Give them money for this money. Yeah. Alright.

1968
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:34,820
And El Mullet. Webcam, yo. Webcam.

1969
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:40,820
Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's match game. The final score guys, Andrew, one point. Good job.

1970
02:28:40,820 --> 02:28:45,820
Richie, one point, which means they tied. And you know what that means?

1971
02:28:45,820 --> 02:28:49,820
You both lose! You both lose! Good job.

1972
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:54,820
Richie, now that you've lost the match game, how do you feel?

1973
02:28:54,820 --> 02:28:59,820
What are you going to do now? I think I'm going to go back into the bathroom for another ten minutes.

1974
02:28:59,820 --> 02:29:08,140
Alright, sounds good. You do that! Remember to flush. Alright. Alright, Richie, thanks

1975
02:29:08,140 --> 02:29:14,700
for playing but you lose. Oh, okay. Any last words you want to say? Amy, when I come on

1976
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:19,060
that show, I am going to stuff those bears down my pants. Alright. That is all. Bye,

1977
02:29:19,060 --> 02:29:25,860
thank you. Alright. Okay, we've got, we have not even talked about Bamani news yet, and

1978
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:30,900
still got the FUs of the week to do. So, Loki, Loki's gonna catch, what, yes, Secret

1979
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:35,060
Dude. Oh, just for the listeners that aren't in the chat room, there sounds like there

1980
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:41,100
will be hints coming next week, for real. Real ones. Yeah, real ones. So, be on the

1981
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:48,140
lookout. Alright. Sounds good. Let's get to some of our other Bomani news. Loki's gonna

1982
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:53,100
kinda run down what's been going on here. Yeah, since we kinda bypassed that whole section

1983
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:58,420
of the show, because that's not important, no one really cares. Well first off, 2DX Red,

1984
02:29:58,420 --> 02:30:05,260
or 2DX11 was testing now in Japan, and of course we have the first, you know, song list

1985
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:10,540
that's out over there. There's some really cool stuff, we've got a brand new DJ setup

1986
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:20,340
track, Spiritual Galaxy, a brand new eight plus, woo, eight plus song, which is Gigadelic,

1987
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:27,340
And then there's also a bunch of other tracks that are on there. New Walls track, which is pretty sweet.

1988
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:36,340
Just a lot of cool stuff. Check it out in Bomani style or Air Japan or any other site that carries Bomani news because you've got tons of info on it.

1989
02:30:36,340 --> 02:30:42,340
New stuff that's going to be in there. They have a new ranking thing that's on the side of the screen as you're playing the game,

1990
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:46,340
which shows your combo versus the max combo on the machine, which I thought was pretty neat.

1991
02:30:46,340 --> 02:31:12,340
And, um, you know, and it's very red, hence the name 2DX Red. Of course, there'll be more songs coming out as time goes on right now, um, because with each test, of course, they add more songs to it and stuff. Um, supposedly, there's gonna be a lot more new songs coming, and it just looks pretty sweet. Um, uh, also, a Eurotrance-style version of Platonic X, which makes me sad.

1992
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:18,340
But yeah, in Secret of Love, new DJ Swan track, also did Gentle Stress, so that'd be pretty cool.

1993
02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:26,340
Aside from that kind of stuff, hmm, well I know there's a lot of Sim stuff.

1994
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:32,340
There was big Sim news this week, even if you've just been spending your time on the internet

1995
02:31:32,340 --> 02:31:38,340
doing nothing but waiting for Xtreme and UltraMix 2 hints, you're missing some of the stuff that's going on in the Sim scene

1996
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:41,620
in the sim scene and while you know that might be questionable or whatever, there is some

1997
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:44,540
good stuff going on. What is going on right now? There is some big stuff going on.

1998
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:48,820
My god, there is a bunch of big stuff going on. First off, you know, the best sim file

1999
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:53,540
makers on the face of the fucking earth, okay, the FoodMix team, they released FoodMix Plus,

2000
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:58,060
which is awesome. You need to go check it out. 15 brand new songs. Most of the songs

2001
02:31:58,060 --> 02:32:03,300
are from Diverse 7, which is also out right now. It's going to be, um, Diverse 7 is actually

2002
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:10,100
gonna be featuring three different CDs with actual key sound files for BMS players. Basically

2003
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:15,420
it's the BeatMania, 2DX, SIMS. And I gotta say these artists are fucking awesome. They

2004
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:20,240
do really kick ass Bomani remixes and you need to go check them out. If you haven't

2005
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:26,920
heard of Diverse Systems before, you can definitely check them out. It's at www.diverse.jp. And

2006
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:30,820
go check it out. They have an English page. You can order the CDs and they're really kick

2007
02:32:30,820 --> 02:32:35,820
And they were actually the ones that were distributing Bounce Connected for a while there, so definitely check it out.

2008
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:42,820
But one of the cool, some of the cool stuff that's on there, you've got a few remixes I'd like to kind of just tease a little bit.

2009
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:44,820
Maybe we can play these in a break or something.

2010
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:50,820
There was some new ones, there was a new track by Offbeat which did some really kick-ass stuff.

2011
02:32:50,820 --> 02:32:54,820
This would be the Holic remix called Holics.

2012
02:32:54,820 --> 02:32:59,820
And it was pretty sweet, so let me just play a little bit in the middle here.

2013
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:04,820
I mean, that was pretty sweet.

2014
02:33:04,820 --> 02:33:11,820
And then, we've also got, there's a brand new, what was it?

2015
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:15,820
Innocent Walls remix, which, oh my God.

2016
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:18,820
It's fucking awesome.

2017
02:33:18,820 --> 02:33:25,820
Let me see here.

2018
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:33,340
Let's see.

2019
02:33:38,300 --> 02:33:41,980
Just some really kick-ass stuff, and of course they make awesome videos that go with

2020
02:33:41,980 --> 02:33:42,620
everything.

2021
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:45,940
Steps are really good. Definitely go check it out.

2022
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:51,540
There's remixes of G2, Max 300 of course, but you know, it's really awesome.

2023
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:59,260
Um, there's remixes of, uh, 20 November, Brilliant 2 U, Haulik, as I mentioned before, the Safari,

2024
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:01,540
just a bunch of really cool stuff.

2025
02:34:01,540 --> 02:34:02,540
Go check it out.

2026
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:07,220
And, since it is all in one pack, you do get the original Food Mix as well, which there's

2027
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:11,740
tons of songs in that, all the same quality, just excellent.

2028
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:13,380
Go check that out.

2029
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:20,380
Aside from that, there's been more work being done on the front of starting to rip stuff from games.

2030
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:30,380
Actually, there's a guy working on ripping all the characters, the 3D characters from the PlayStation versions, and all the background graphics and stuff, and the progress so far has been really cool.

2031
02:34:30,380 --> 02:34:37,380
You can check that on DDR Maniacs under the StepMania forums and their themes, and that was really cool.

2032
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:47,380
And then, of course, there's DDROSC3, which is pretty cool. There's a new Stepfile contest, you know, kind of a break from Turning Mix.

2033
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:58,380
So you can check that out, too. And, of course, if you're not really into, you know, making SIM files and more of, like, the remixing type, there's remix contests going on, DDRMania X and also BomaniCell.

2034
02:34:58,380 --> 02:35:03,380
So check those out. They're pretty much, pretty similar, so you might find one that you want to enter.

2035
02:35:03,380 --> 02:35:17,380
But that's pretty much just going on right now. I've heard that there was going to be, you know, an Alpha 22 for StepMania 3-9, but apparently not yet. But, um, coming, soon.

2036
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:29,380
Alright. Thanks for catching up on the news. I know we kind of got pushed aside because of all the other crap we got going on tonight, but, you know, there is other news going on out there, so thanks for bringing it up. Anybody want to comment on any of the news?

2037
02:35:29,380 --> 02:35:33,380
Well, you guys are easy to please. Talkative bunch, talkative bunch, aren't you?

2038
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:38,380
Alright, I think what we're going to do now, actually we'll take a quick break and we're going to play some songs.

2039
02:35:38,380 --> 02:35:41,380
Oh, actually I have to announce tonight's winner of the cage match, my bad.

2040
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:49,380
Tonight's winner of the cage match, I was actually kind of surprised by this, but Loki's remix has been dethroned and we have a new winner.

2041
02:35:49,380 --> 02:35:59,020
Astro Sexy by M-Flow won tonight's cage match and will be in rotation all week long on Orange

2042
02:35:59,020 --> 02:36:03,040
Lawns Radio's Bamani Music & More program, which by the way, I know some of you guys

2043
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:07,840
just tuned into the station for the first time tonight, but we do play Bamani music

2044
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:14,480
from 2DX, DDR, home version stuff, poppin' music, Guitar Freaks drum media, dance mania

2045
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:21,480
tracks that you don't hear usually on Bahmanim playlists. So we bought that running 24-7.

2046
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:25,800
Yeah, I'm pumping up songs too. Some of the good ones. So definitely tune into that. It

2047
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:31,640
runs all day. And an MP3 Pro means you get DSL quality radio on a dial-up stream.

2048
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:37,080
We even throw in a couple of happy-to-be hardcore tracks here and there too.

2049
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:43,280
Good stuff. Alright, so M-Flow one tonight. I think we're gonna do it. We're gonna take

2050
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,920
a break, and we're actually going to play two tracks from Food Mix. I want to play the

2051
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:48,600
Max remix, because I think it's really good, and we're going to play the Safari, because

2052
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:51,640
I like that one. So I thought we'd play those for the guys.

2053
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:54,920
Those are pretty cool, yeah. They're all good. They're all good, really.

2054
02:36:54,920 --> 02:36:58,640
They're really, my favorites of the new one have to be the Instant Walls one.

2055
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:01,080
Okay, I'll take out, I'll take, I'll put in Innocent Walls, too.

2056
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:07,080
And the Innocent Walls one is fucking awesome. I mean, they, the guys from Food Mix did enter

2057
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:12,120
Turning Mix 5, but the entry that they picked was like one of the worst ones that they did.

2058
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:22,120
But if they picked one of these, oh my god, it would have owned everybody, but, whatever, you know, I'm sure they're not out to brag, because they know they're kick-ass, and they don't really need to prove it, so...

2059
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:25,120
Yeah, rocks.

2060
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:28,120
Alright, so we'll get that in there too, then, I just gotta remember...

2061
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:30,120
Is that it?

2062
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,120
Oh, sure is. Alright, then we'll do this song first, why don't we?

2063
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:38,040
We're going to do that Innocent Walls remix, and then when we come back, we are going to

2064
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:41,440
do the FUs of the week, however we have to keep it fast tonight, so we're going to run

2065
02:37:41,440 --> 02:37:46,640
through everybody in the room, and unfortunately tonight, only selected chat room FUs will

2066
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:50,720
be read, so if you send me a long one, not going to get read, so think of something really

2067
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:53,720
good if you have a good story, and I apologize in advance, but we are running on a limited

2068
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:58,640
schedule tonight, so keep them short, FUs from chat room will be limited, but send those

2069
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:00,260
to Sky over private message.

2070
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:04,720
So here it is, check it out, some remix songs from the latest Foon mix, starting off with

2071
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:08,420
an Innocent Walls vocal mix, Max remix, and then a guitar remix.

2072
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:13,100
Let me get the actual title, hold on, because I want to be correct on this.

2073
02:38:13,100 --> 02:38:20,180
This title of this remix here is called Made in Innocent, and it's a short version by OnoKen.

2074
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:27,500
OnoKen, which fucking rocks, did P8107 rumored to have a song in 2DX Red, but I think that's

2075
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:28,500
pretty much a rumor.

2076
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:35,500
It would be awesome if he did, but just a rumor for now. So yeah, check it out. Awesome work.

2077
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:38,500
Alright, and don't forget, your rain will be back again at 9.40. We're going to play that again.

2078
02:38:38,500 --> 02:38:45,500
Okay, anyway, here we go, um, some stuff we're filming, so we'll be back with EFUs of the Week.

2079
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:10,500
When I get back, it's a hot booty break-up

2080
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:12,500
Clear the phone, your keys, they come to speakin'

2081
02:39:12,500 --> 02:39:14,500
Got a lot of shit to say, but on your lips, we kept

2082
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:16,500
We always put hoodies away, them kids clap

2083
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:18,500
Hear my shit, my real technique

2084
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:20,500
I'm speakin', breakin' my bones

2085
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:22,500
Rhymes up, I'm liking to the devil's cuss bones

2086
02:39:22,500 --> 02:39:24,500
Deep into the wild blue horizon

2087
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:42,500
You want to hear

2088
02:39:44,500 --> 02:39:46,500
The teacher

2089
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:18,880
when again i can't stop breathing

2090
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:20,460
s scythe's going to tend to go to sleep

2091
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:22,180
leave me alone girl house it's a sequence

2092
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:22,720
if you stay asleep

2093
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:27,300
now we wonder what it's going to feel when it

2094
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:30,700
break, and honestly it was turn to the

2095
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:36,580
yeah

2096
02:40:36,580 --> 02:40:43,740
dealing with

2097
02:44:13,740 --> 02:44:14,440
Make a look at these

2098
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:17,340
You can't you can't you these

2099
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:20,740
You can't you can't you these

2100
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:23,940
You can't you can't you these

2101
02:44:24,540 --> 02:44:26,840
You can't you can't you these

2102
02:44:27,740 --> 02:44:30,840
You can't you can't you these

2103
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:33,840
You can't you can't you these

2104
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:36,840
You can't you can't you these

2105
02:44:36,840 --> 02:44:47,840
Niko, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,

2106
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:48,840
Oh, Ash!

2107
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:53,840
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

2108
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:57,840
Yes, we are a little bit random here on Orange Lounge Radio, if you haven't guessed.

2109
02:44:57,840 --> 02:44:58,840
A little.

2110
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:01,840
But, you know what, a lot of guys stuck around after the underage thing, so you like us.

2111
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:02,840
We appreciate you.

2112
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:03,840
You really like us.

2113
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:04,840
No, we do appreciate it.

2114
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:08,140
is to stick with us, because then we feel good about ourselves.

2115
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:09,140
We've been trying here, you guys.

2116
02:45:09,140 --> 02:45:10,540
It validates us for the week.

2117
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:12,440
We think it's a fun thing to do on a Sunday night.

2118
02:45:12,440 --> 02:45:15,540
I mean, you know, it's not like I'm going to church or anything.

2119
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:16,740
Not like we're getting paid for this.

2120
02:45:16,740 --> 02:45:17,940
Yeah, we don't get paid for this either.

2121
02:45:17,940 --> 02:45:19,040
We pay for this.

2122
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:20,340
We do.

2123
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:21,340
That's alright, that's why I couldn't...

2124
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:22,340
With our souls!

2125
02:45:22,340 --> 02:45:24,840
Yeah, it would cost me a lot of money to increase the cap

2126
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:28,140
to get more people on stream tonight, so sorry guys, couldn't do it.

2127
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:30,340
Um, anyway, we gotta get into this,

2128
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:31,540
because we don't have a lot of time left in the show,

2129
02:45:31,540 --> 02:45:33,040
but I do want to get into the FUs of the week.

2130
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:34,440
We're gonna move quickly, you guys, tonight,

2131
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:40,440
But, speaking of randomness, why do we do the FUs of the Week, for those of our new listeners, Jamie?

2132
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:45,440
We have this whole buildup of angst, and we need to have a big bad release of it, or else we, like, explode.

2133
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:52,440
Alright. Alright, here we go then, Jamie. It's time to do the FUs of the Week. You ready?

2134
02:45:52,440 --> 02:45:53,440
I'm ready, Rob.

2135
02:45:53,440 --> 02:46:13,620
I would like to give a big F.U. to the three root beers that I have had that facilitated

2136
02:46:13,620 --> 02:46:14,620
that loud belch.

2137
02:46:14,620 --> 02:46:16,540
I am normally not as unladylike.

2138
02:46:16,540 --> 02:46:18,420
I usually am a lot more unladylike.

2139
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:20,220
Nah, really.

2140
02:46:20,220 --> 02:46:26,220
A big F.U. to impatience, especially for people who drive.

2141
02:46:26,220 --> 02:46:34,220
And another F.U. goes to A.R.C. for not posting my financial aid stuff and certifying my loans so I can get my fucking money.

2142
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:40,220
That's it. I'm being nice. F.U. to freaking running out of time.

2143
02:46:40,220 --> 02:46:43,220
Alright, moving on. Loki, your turn.

2144
02:46:43,220 --> 02:46:54,420
I fucking hate stupid stanky drivers who can't fucking drive. I had this stupid bitch last

2145
02:46:54,420 --> 02:47:00,220
weekend still pissing me off. Fucking cut me off when I'm driving just to get behind

2146
02:47:00,220 --> 02:47:04,900
a slow person that was in front of me. Oh wow, guess what? You got to that intersection

2147
02:47:04,900 --> 02:47:09,720
a whole half a second faster than I did. Good, now you can go fuck another sheep and have

2148
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:17,820
your next child okay then finally cuz I'm gonna keep this short fuck you to

2149
02:47:17,820 --> 02:47:22,200
sluts at my work who get higher up in the company about fucking to your box

2150
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:28,060
and openly admitting it and bragging about it I fucking hate you and I will

2151
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:36,060
take you down and I'm not talking about in a good way. I'm done. My turn.

2152
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:50,060
I have to do it myself for the fact that I am paying about $13.95 a month to play Final Fantasy 11 and I have touched it a whopping one time this whole week.

2153
02:47:50,060 --> 02:47:56,060
Because I found better things to do for once in my life. For once in my life, no, because I found something even better than Ragnarok.

2154
02:47:56,060 --> 02:48:01,140
i went out and i went on a date this week so that was something better

2155
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:02,380
yes finally

2156
02:48:02,380 --> 02:48:03,940
uh...

2157
02:48:03,940 --> 02:48:07,560
but i thought that they had to add on it i was not too much for them

2158
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:09,220
i'd like to get the whole but anyway

2159
02:48:09,220 --> 02:48:11,700
i'm just glad i got out of the house you know i mean

2160
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:14,860
but uh...

2161
02:48:14,860 --> 02:48:17,740
that here still

2162
02:48:17,740 --> 02:48:20,920
my other if you go to on that burning

2163
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:24,260
in my car i thought like i cracked my radiator something

2164
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:28,220
but actually i just run over a plastic bag and it wrapped itself around my pipe and caught

2165
02:48:28,220 --> 02:48:29,500
itself on fire

2166
02:48:29,500 --> 02:48:34,620
so f you to people that leave plastic bags in the road what the hell you do that for?

2167
02:48:34,620 --> 02:48:36,620
stupid

2168
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:40,060
this is the best thing i've ever seen

2169
02:48:40,060 --> 02:48:45,160
moving on let's go to our other studio guests

2170
02:48:45,160 --> 02:48:49,060
starting off with who's got a microphone over there

2171
02:48:49,060 --> 02:48:52,120
mister uh... andrew what do you have to say f u to what

2172
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:56,120
Alright, well I'd like to give a big fuck you to all the bar and speed mod haters out there.

2173
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:59,120
I'd just like to piss you guys off right now before I get started.

2174
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:03,120
I wanted to talk to you more about the bar raping thing tonight, but we just ran out of time.

2175
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:04,120
I'll come back.

2176
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:05,120
You gotta come back, alright.

2177
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:06,120
We ain't got time.

2178
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:10,120
I'd also like to give a big F you to everybody that lives in Glen Rose, Texas.

2179
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:14,120
I don't care if I know you or not, but just that whole town needs to just be wiped off the map.

2180
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:19,120
And last but not least, if you're a friend that I told to listen tonight and you're not listening,

2181
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:20,120
fuck you guys.

2182
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:21,120
Don't ever talk to me again.

2183
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:26,360
me again. You are listening. I love you. In that platonic kind of way. Okay, that's all

2184
02:49:26,360 --> 02:49:27,360
I got.

2185
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:28,360
Alright, very nice. Angel.

2186
02:49:28,360 --> 02:49:31,880
Alright, I'm going to go through this real quick because I got one from Agus as well.

2187
02:49:31,880 --> 02:49:37,520
He says, F you to sitting on my ass on a perfectly good Sunday doing nothing except for answering

2188
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:42,600
people's phone calls and they happen to be going to the wrong department. And he's the

2189
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:43,600
only one there.

2190
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:58,600
Also, I'd like to say a quick F U to the stoplight on Arden and Del Paso, because it is the longest piece of crap I've ever, like, waited on, and it happened to be while I was trying to get over here.

2191
02:49:58,600 --> 02:50:08,600
So I'm going, okay, I can go now, really, I really want to get here. Yeah, because I'm, like, you know, an Orange Lounge freak like that. Anyway, next person.

2200
02:50:51,800 --> 02:50:56,040

2201
02:50:56,040 --> 02:51:01,720
a pain in the butt and it's unbelievable our public office is huge so and we're

2202
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:05,240
on the other side of the post office is all we on one end of the complex you

2203
02:51:05,240 --> 02:51:09,240
They could put it in the middle. No, they don't do that. They put it on one end.

2204
02:51:09,240 --> 02:51:12,240
So anyway, fuck into that. That's it.

2205
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:13,240
Alright.

2206
02:51:13,240 --> 02:51:15,240
Uh, moving on. Seagurd!

2207
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:22,240
F you to relatives that start charging you rent after living there a month and you have to sleep in the kitchen.

2208
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:23,240
Um...

2209
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:24,240
You're sleeping in the kitchen?

2210
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:25,240
Yeah, I'm sleeping in the kitchen.

2211
02:51:25,240 --> 02:51:27,240
You are so Cinderella. It's horrible.

2212
02:51:27,240 --> 02:51:28,240
I made that comparison the other night.

2213
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:32,240
Yeah, I didn't like it because that would mean I'd have to wear a dress or something.

2214
02:51:32,240 --> 02:51:50,240
F you to the chat room because it's funny. F you to people who read into what we say far too much and F you to your guys' crazy Photoshop skills because it's really creepy but funny so keep it up.

2215
02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:57,240
See, Konami employees are real people too, you guys. Alright, let's go to the chat room F you, shall we?

2216
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:58,240
Oh, I forgot another big one.

2217
02:51:58,240 --> 02:51:59,240
Yes, Jamie.

2218
02:51:59,240 --> 02:52:04,440
Um, and F.U. to not having time or money to go where I want to go and see who I want to see.

2219
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:05,940
Aww.

2220
02:52:05,940 --> 02:52:13,440
One really quick one, uh, F.U. to the post office for holding all of our mail because we're still trying to get forward and stuff.

2221
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:15,440
That really sucks for three weeks now.

2222
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:23,440
Yeah, yeah, you know, you, uh, Miklotov or whatever the hell you go by now, don't stress out, just, you know, mellow out, be gentle.

2223
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:25,440
Have some gentle stress.

2224
02:52:25,440 --> 02:52:27,440
Alright.

2225
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:29,440
Was that a hint?

2226
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:31,440
Was that a hint?

2227
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:34,440
Oh my god, Gentle Stress is in a version of DDR.

2228
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:36,440
Okay, here we go.

2229
02:52:36,440 --> 02:52:39,440
Oh, this is going to be good. I'm loving this first one already.

2230
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:41,440
Let's go into the chatroom FUs.

2231
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:43,440
We're going to start a fight here tonight.

2232
02:52:43,440 --> 02:52:48,440
Tora would like to give an FU to Jamie, also known as Dark Sakura.

2233
02:52:48,440 --> 02:52:49,440
Why?

2234
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:52,440
Because she gave me warning points for no reason way back when.

2235
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:56,440
Okay, if I warn you it's for a fucking reason. You did something wrong.

2236
02:52:56,440 --> 02:53:01,720

02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:23,620

2258
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:25,580
How about bootsy ass?

2259
02:54:25,580 --> 02:54:28,980

Alright.

2261
02:54:29,980 --> 02:54:34,400
MJB would like to say my FU of the week goes to my shitty internet for disconnecting me

2262
02:54:34,400 --> 02:54:38,380
from Orange Launch Radio, almost causing me to miss my FUs of the week.

2263
02:54:38,380 --> 02:54:40,180
Well we can't have that can we?

2264
02:54:40,180 --> 02:54:44,220
Any other week you would have been okay with the cap thing, I swear, tonight's just crazy.

2265
02:54:44,220 --> 02:54:49,220
I just found missed calls from two of my bestest friends.

2266
02:54:49,220 --> 02:54:51,220
But you were listening to this show, so it's okay.

2267
02:54:51,220 --> 02:54:52,220
We're your new bestest friends.

2268
02:54:52,220 --> 02:54:53,220
Ooh, I hit that.

2269
02:54:53,220 --> 02:54:54,220
F.U. to Gaps.

2270
02:54:54,220 --> 02:54:55,220
All right.

2271
02:54:55,220 --> 02:54:59,220
Ry Chan says, F.U. to Coughing Really Hard and Weezing While Trying to Play a 9-Foot

2272
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:00,220
DDR Song in the Arcade.

2273
02:55:00,220 --> 02:55:01,220
Hey, that was me last night on Pumped Up.

2274
02:55:01,220 --> 02:55:02,220
That's me.

2275
02:55:02,220 --> 02:55:03,220
That's me.

2276
02:55:03,220 --> 02:55:04,220
That's me.

2277
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:05,220
That's me.

2278
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:06,220
That's me.

2279
02:55:06,220 --> 02:55:07,220
That's me.

2280
02:55:07,220 --> 02:55:08,220
That's me.

2281
02:55:08,220 --> 02:55:09,220
That's me.

2282
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:10,220
That's me.

2283
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:11,220
That's me.

2284
02:55:11,220 --> 02:55:12,220
That's me.

2285
02:55:12,220 --> 02:55:13,220
That's me.

2286
02:55:13,220 --> 02:55:16,980
That was me last night. I'll pump it up. I thought I was gonna die brain cancer. Could you pick up maybe?

2287
02:55:18,180 --> 02:55:20,180
and lastly

2288
02:55:20,580 --> 02:55:21,620
Vandalous

2289
02:55:21,620 --> 02:55:28,500
Vandalous says my fu is for the Sacramento Kings in their recent drama. It's like a friggin soap opera full of spoiled millionaires

2290
02:55:29,580 --> 02:55:34,380
Thanks. Yeah. Amen. Thank God. They're leaving now now play nice

2291
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:37,060
Yeah, you're gonna start another fight here

2292
02:55:37,060 --> 02:55:37,900
You know what?

2293
02:55:37,900 --> 02:55:44,140
I think the people who get bent out of shape over sports rivalries really need to like get a life one more last-minute one here

2294
02:55:44,140 --> 02:55:49,020
Our Kara says F you to Andrew for not giving me my sexiness. I don't know what that's supposed to mean

2295
02:55:49,020 --> 02:55:50,260
Is that a hidden message?

2296
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:54,600
Wait about two weeks. Do you need to take this offline? No, I think we're I think we're all good

2297
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:58,820
Just give me two weeks or something. It's on on. All right

2298
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:03,980
Is somebody gonna get served I think

2299
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:10,420
think suckers gonna get Chronicle that's what's up all right um guys it's the end

2300
02:56:10,420 --> 02:56:14,740
of the show we're already here I know cry well thank you guys for listening

2301
02:56:14,740 --> 02:56:18,860
and making it a great show tonight I hope we don't need exclusives to make

2302
02:56:18,860 --> 02:56:23,060
you guys keep listening to us but I we are exclusive hopefully you liked it

2303
02:56:23,060 --> 02:56:26,300
you'll come back but if not hey thanks for wasting three hours with us tonight

2304
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:30,900
I hope you like the song but we're gonna go around and get everybody's final

2305
02:56:30,900 --> 02:56:35,340
thoughts. Let's start off with DD Archaholic. DD Archaholic, your final thought. It's like

2306
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:37,780
Jerry Springer's final thought. It's your final thought.

2307
02:56:37,780 --> 02:56:43,620
Well, quick shout out to my boyfriend, Jason, DarkChild999. I don't know if he's listening

2308
02:56:43,620 --> 02:56:54,620
or not. He might be. And final thought. Chewing gum that tastes like grape is really good.

2309
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:57,620
Um, Angel, your final thought?

2310
02:56:57,620 --> 02:57:01,620
Um, Akira Yomoko, because I can.

2311
02:57:01,620 --> 02:57:06,620
Okay. Hey, Akira is a good thing. Andrew?

2312
02:57:06,620 --> 02:57:11,620
I just want to say thanks for having me on the show. I hope to be back in the future, and this place kicks ass.

2313
02:57:11,620 --> 02:57:14,620
But there's way too much fucking Pokemon in here, man. It's creep-

2314
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:16,620
You're welcome! You're welcome!

2315
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:18,620
It's creeping me the hell out. Okay.

2316
02:57:18,620 --> 02:57:20,620
Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold that thought. Hold that thought.

2317
02:57:20,620 --> 02:57:29,620
and this is the time where we fill the air while rob goes way, better than filling air for three hours while...

2318
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:32,620
ahhh!!!

2319
02:57:33,620 --> 02:57:35,620
I'm going to put that on the cam, you guys

2320
02:57:36,620 --> 02:57:37,620
ok, you do that

2321
02:57:38,620 --> 02:57:39,620
woooo!

2322
02:57:39,620 --> 02:57:40,620
Go!

2323
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:43,620
Anyways, umm, I guess I'll do my final thought

2324
02:57:43,620 --> 02:57:47,620
my final thought is, I feel sorry for anyone that tuned in tonight just to hear that song

2325
02:57:47,620 --> 02:57:49,620
and then expose themselves to our stories

2326
02:57:49,620 --> 02:58:03,620
expose themselves to our show, because that sucks. No, but really though, I hope you guys listen some more, because there's those moments that are really cool. It's kind of like watching bad movies. You know, eventually you'll get to a moment that's like really funny and stuff.

2327
02:58:03,620 --> 02:58:09,620
It's like watching Xanadu. Exactly. No, I've never seen that, so that doesn't make any sense to me.

2328
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:11,620
It's like watching Battle Royale 2.

2329
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:12,940
God, that movie sucked.

2330
02:58:12,940 --> 02:58:15,260
Don't see Battle Royale 2.

2331
02:58:15,260 --> 02:58:19,500
Instead, instead, download the camera above Kashaan,

2332
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:21,700
because that fucking rocks.

2333
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:22,540
Okay.

2334
02:58:24,380 --> 02:58:27,180
And my final thought is,

2335
02:58:27,180 --> 02:58:29,660
please come back and listen to us again,

2336
02:58:29,660 --> 02:58:31,580
even though we're not gonna have any more premieres.

2337
02:58:31,580 --> 02:58:34,060
Please come back and listen.

2338
02:58:34,060 --> 02:58:37,060
I know, okay, I didn't say, do I always have to go last?

2339
02:58:37,060 --> 02:58:37,900
Yes.

2340
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:40,540
We, no.

2341
02:58:40,540 --> 02:58:45,720
We could. I could empty the stream. We could, like, put that clip of me singing again on,

2342
02:58:45,720 --> 02:58:51,580
you know, because that's pretty sad. Uh, Seagurd, once. You're going last? He's gonna go last.

2343
02:58:51,580 --> 02:58:55,320
Okay, then. I'm being nice. DarkSakura, you always go last, though. You're being very

2344
02:58:55,320 --> 02:58:59,340
nice tonight. I'm, I think I've shown quite a bit of restraint tonight. I think you've

2345
02:58:59,340 --> 02:59:03,620
been a very good girl. You get a cookie. No, if it's a low-carb cookie. A low-carb cookie.

2346
02:59:03,620 --> 02:59:09,300
Okay. All right. Um, I, I was such a disbeliever for this stupid Atkins diet, because, you

2347
02:59:09,300 --> 02:59:13,820
you know, sort of what your body does before it dies. But it works. So maybe I'm going

2348
02:59:13,820 --> 02:59:21,080
to die. I don't lose a lot of weight. My final thought is that Diet Hansen's root beer is

2349
02:59:21,080 --> 02:59:26,620
the best thing in the world. Alright. I agree. Second best thing in the world. It's lovely.

2350
02:59:26,620 --> 02:59:32,620
Next to orgasms. Alright. You know, I do have to say that orgasms are very nice. They are.

2351
02:59:32,620 --> 02:59:37,460
They should just sell canned orgasms. They should. For all those people who... Orgasm

2352
02:59:37,460 --> 02:59:44,940
Seagurd, your final thought?

2353
02:59:44,940 --> 02:59:48,980
My final thought is, I hope everybody liked the remix of Your Rain.

2354
02:59:48,980 --> 02:59:53,000
It's really fun in DDR, so I look forward to that.

2355
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:58,260
Also look forward to this week when it sounds like we might really be giving clues out.

2356
02:59:58,260 --> 03:00:03,500
So that's going to be cool, and thanks for listening to me whore myself out over the

2357
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:11,980
the radio. All right. And final word of the show. Are we going to give it to Andrew? All

2358
03:00:11,980 --> 03:00:15,700
right, let's give it to Andrew. It's just one word that sums up the entire show, but

2359
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:21,100
it can only be one word that sums everything up. Suckers. You're all suckers.

03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:43,020
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2396
03:04:43,020 --> 03:04:49,380
Alright, the afterbirth, the part after we fade to black, the secret part of the show,

2397
03:04:49,380 --> 03:04:55,940
the afterbirth where we do things that we couldn't do during the show, and you know

2398
03:04:55,940 --> 03:05:00,740
what guys? We haven't even really talked about this in the room, but there's one other little

2399
03:05:00,740 --> 03:05:06,220
thing we want to play for you guys. This is why it pays to listen. Yes it does, and it's

2400
03:05:06,220 --> 03:05:10,460
not DDR, it's not a DDR thing, but Secret wanted to share it with you guys anyway. It

2401
03:05:10,460 --> 03:05:16,460
something that hasn't been heard by a lot of people yet. The Silent Hill thing. Oh,

2402
03:05:16,460 --> 03:05:19,460
we're going to actually do it? Yeah, we're going to do that. It's a happy birth now.

2403
03:05:19,460 --> 03:05:25,380
Okay, I'm a DDR fan and all, but I'm more a Silent Hill fan. We are going to play you

2404
03:05:25,380 --> 03:05:34,940
a track from the US OST. It's one of the 13 special exclusive songs to the American OST.

2405
03:05:34,940 --> 03:05:36,940
It's Waver, slide mix.

2406
03:05:36,940 --> 03:05:38,940
Alright, so this is sweet.

2407
03:05:38,940 --> 03:05:41,940
It's a brand new US song, hasn't been heard yet, but we're gonna play it for you guys.

2408
03:05:41,940 --> 03:05:43,940
Waver, and it's a Kiryamoka.

2409
03:05:43,940 --> 03:05:44,940
It's another song of his.

2410
03:05:44,940 --> 03:05:47,940
See, again, that's why it pays to stay tuned to the end of the show.

2411
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:49,940
Pays to stay tuned. Enjoy.

2412
03:05:52,940 --> 03:05:55,940
Whoops, sorry, technical difficulties, my bad.

2413
03:05:55,940 --> 03:06:02,940
let's try that again

2414
03:07:25,940 --> 03:07:26,940
Woo!

2415
03:07:26,940 --> 03:07:34,100
That's alright we, that's alright we that's alright we that's alright we that's alright

2416
03:07:34,100 --> 03:07:41,800

2417

2418
03:08:47,700 --> 03:09:07,160
All right, that was pretty cool. It was from the Silent Hill US soundtrack. I kind of like

2419
03:09:07,160 --> 03:09:08,160
that. It's kind of...

2420
03:09:08,160 --> 03:09:09,160
That was kind of...

2421
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:11,040
That's like your favorite one, singer?

2422
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:16,240
That is totally my favorite Akira Yamaoka song. The original version of that is kind

2423
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:20,560
boring but that one with the crazy like singing I was listening to it on Bart at

2424
03:09:20,560 --> 03:09:26,040
night at going home from work and I was seriously freaking out it was the best

2425
03:09:26,040 --> 03:09:30,240
it sounds kind of porno in a way does sound kind of porno all right

2426
03:09:30,240 --> 03:09:34,200

2452
03:11:56,700 --> 03:11:59,060

03:12:13,840 --> 03:12:16,740
and i know they're like

2459
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:20,740
DDR Freak fans, or Orange Lounge fans, or fan fans.

2460
03:12:20,740 --> 03:12:23,740
Hopefully both after tonight's show, that's the goal.

2461
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:28,740
But you guys were really patient, so I figured I'd give you one hint, because I'm nice.

2462
03:12:28,740 --> 03:12:30,740
No way, you're actually able to give a hint?

2463
03:12:30,740 --> 03:12:31,740
Totally giving one hint.

2464
03:12:31,740 --> 03:12:34,740
Oh, wow. Okay, very sexy. All right, what is it?

2465
03:12:34,740 --> 03:12:38,740
Okay, you guys might have to read into this a little bit. I know you're good at it, so it's okay.

2466
03:12:38,740 --> 03:12:45,740
One new song in Extreme has steps.

2467
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:48,820
with up arrows.

2468
03:12:48,820 --> 03:12:51,380
Wow.

2469
03:12:51,380 --> 03:12:55,020
Up arrows. We don't see enough of them.

2470
03:12:55,020 --> 03:12:58,140
Do not underestimate the power

2471
03:12:58,140 --> 03:13:01,780
of that hint. I mean it might sound like

2472
03:13:01,780 --> 03:13:04,940
there's gonna be a song with music in it. No, this

2473
03:13:04,940 --> 03:13:08,140
is an actual hint.

2474
03:13:08,140 --> 03:13:11,940
With up arrows. And we like up arrows, don't we?

2475
03:13:11,940 --> 03:13:15,580
Although I have to say I'm partial to the right arrow or the

2476
03:13:15,580 --> 03:13:19,320
