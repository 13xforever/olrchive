1
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:26,772
And now for our feature presentation

2
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:02,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

3
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:09,968
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and then some.

4
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:17,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

5
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:26,522
[SPEAKER_19]: If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!

6
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

7
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:41,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

8
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:44,127
[SPEAKER_18]: Fast, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

9
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:48,068
[SPEAKER_18]: He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

10
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:51,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

11
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Hamburgers!

12
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,670
[SPEAKER_06]: The cornerstone of any nutritious practice.

13
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,870
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a huge one.

14
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:03,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you mind if I pick my new car for a ride?

15
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:07,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.

16
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:08,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen Malcolm?

17
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:09,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Lena?

18
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:13,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

19
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:14,464
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was you.

20
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to expose you.

21
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:16,986
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

22
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:18,787
[SPEAKER_18]: So I choose to expose myself.

23
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, there are ladies present.

24
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:22,969
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

25
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,370
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.

26
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,631
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

27
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:29,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Any time, any place, baby.

28
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:30,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

29
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:31,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Ow, my foot!

30
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:34,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

31
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:36,389
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio.

32
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,410
[SPEAKER_11]: We are live!

33
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is episode number 106 for this August the 8th of 2004.

34
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:51,214
[SPEAKER_11]: We are the internet's talk radio program dedicated to all things Vamani and then some.

35
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:54,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And with me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

36
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:56,196
[SPEAKER_11]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.

37
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:56,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello to...

38
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:59,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, DarkSakura.

39
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, hooray for me.

40
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray for you.

41
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:04,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray for me.

42
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm, I'm, and hooray for me.

43
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You put my meat on the camera, you whored out my meat.

44
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:13,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes I did, I put your meat on our brand new webcam, available at www.

45
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:15,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And now my foot is on the webcam.

46
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:19,445
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you'll ever see, is my foot.

47
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,047
[SPEAKER_11]: www.orangeloungeradio.com is our webcam address.

48
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Also with us tonight, say hello to our tech massa, Loki's.

49
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:31,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, she's like Dr. Claw, but instead of the arm, it's a foot.

50
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,819
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not the claw, it's just a hand.

51
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:38,302
[SPEAKER_13]: It just can't be Dr. Hand, because that's just stupid.

52
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:48,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Also with us tonight, we have very few special guests here, but they're plentiful in the talent they have to bring.

53
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,251
[SPEAKER_11]: We have somebody who has never been on the show before, and to be honest, I don't even know him that well.

54
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:57,172
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think he's hilarious in what I've seen of him at our local arcade.

55
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:00,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello to Andrew.

56
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:00,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes?

57
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what's going on, everybody?

58
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:04,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know if he'd call you by your online, your real... No, I just got the right answer.

59
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew.

60
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, and Andrew is also well known for what?

61
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Locally here at Roseville.

62
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:13,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I dress up like a pirate at a golf land.

63
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:16,908
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've ever seen a pirate there, that would be amazing.

64
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:18,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Arr, he's a pirate.

65
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:19,830
[SPEAKER_13]: How ironic.

66
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I act like a pirate online.

67
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:23,994
[SPEAKER_11]: He dresses up as one.

68
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:25,115
[SPEAKER_11]: You act like one.

69
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:25,795
[SPEAKER_11]: You do the deeds.

70
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:26,376
[SPEAKER_11]: It all works.

71
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, also with us tonight, we have somebody who frequents the show quite a bit.

72
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:31,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you recognize her from our chat room?

73
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure if you hang out there.

74
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

75
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:34,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello!

76
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:34,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello!

77
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:36,383
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing today?

78
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:37,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

79
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,826
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I noticed we're wearing like matching shirts tonight.

80
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,486
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what the hell is that?

81
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:41,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't even planning that.

82
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,429
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not technically twin shirts.

83
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,150
[SPEAKER_11]: They're close.

84
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,931
[SPEAKER_11]: They're close.

85
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,893
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got, she's got the one with the little piranha plant from Super Mario Bros.

86
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,215
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, bite me.

87
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:51,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I have the Goomba that says, you lose.

88
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:52,177
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like we're twins.

89
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:54,420
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go post on the webcam again real fast during the break.

90
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,120
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

91
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,081
[SPEAKER_03]: We're posing.

92
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:59,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Also with us tonight, we have another very special guest.

93
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,571
[SPEAKER_11]: He's somebody that has actually been on the show before.

94
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:07,476
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's our buddy from Kansas who now lives here in California.

95
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,052
[SPEAKER_11]: It's our buddy Shane, also known as Miquitas.

96
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:12,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

97
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:17,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I'm not mistaken, you have a new name now that you go by as well, yes?

98
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you've been on the DDR Free Chords.

99
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be the new Vivid member, Seagird.

100
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:25,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm the one causing you guys pain.

101
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:31,429
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely have a lot of questions for Seagird when we get back from the break.

102
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, tonight, I guess maybe you guys heard about this.

103
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:37,054
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have a little something.

104
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:37,394
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a

105
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,091
[SPEAKER_11]: A little song out there I think some of you guys are wanting to hear tonight.

106
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:45,851
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all for right now.

107
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:49,812
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is Your Rain from brand new DDR Extreme.

108
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:52,132
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll be playing that a little bit later in the show.

109
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:55,893
[SPEAKER_11]: But hell, while we have a captive audience, let's do our normal antics.

110
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:56,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we, huh?

111
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:58,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

112
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:01,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we love our listeners.

113
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:02,734
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a three-hour show.

114
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:03,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's wait until 2.59.

115
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:04,555
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think?

116
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:05,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That works for me.

117
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,195
[SPEAKER_11]: The song's only like a minute long.

118
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:09,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, no, we'll get to it somewhere after.

119
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:10,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Eventually.

120
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,100
[SPEAKER_11]: We definitely have to do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day first, though, because that's when we start every show.

121
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,864
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, we're going to take a break, and in this break, we're going to hear the original Akira Yamaoka, Your Rain, from Silent Hill 4.

122
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:21,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that song is just so hot.

123
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the song rocked before they remixed it.

124
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:25,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm going to play it now.

125
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite literally, because it is rock.

126
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:27,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It is rock.

127
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:28,628
[SPEAKER_11]: It is rock.

128
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:29,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So, enjoy.

129
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,029
[SPEAKER_02]: How perceptive.

130
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, enjoy this, and then we will be back to play a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

131
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:35,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Also tonight, boys and girls...

132
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:36,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Match Game.

133
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:39,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And to play Match Game tonight, you're going to want to be on Skype.

134
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:45,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Skype.org to download the client, and then you can talk to us live in the studio, and that's also available.

135
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:45,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is.

136
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,921
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be playing a remix of it tonight.

137
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,464
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the original from Silent Hill 4, Kiri Yamoka.

138
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:52,085
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right.

139
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:52,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy it.

140
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:11,036
All that I need are some simple loving words You touched my body once, it hurted

141
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:47,610
Out of my head and I don't know what I found Over and over I feel it break me down

142
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,870
Thanks for watching!

143
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:44,609
Thanks for watching!

144
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:40,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

145
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Saturday?

146
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,783
[SPEAKER_11]: We are back and you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 106.

147
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:56,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you are listening to the stream right now, consider yourself lucky because of that little song that we have we're going to play a little later for you guys.

148
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:04,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight's show got whored out on a lot of different sites and because of that we have hit what is called the cap, the Live 365 listening cap.

149
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:09,538
[SPEAKER_11]: We're only allowed so many listeners and we never in our imaginations thought we would ever hit that limit.

150
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:10,538
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next time.

151
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:34,809
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR and 2DX

152
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,702
[SPEAKER_11]: We would be like the biggest dorks ever.

153
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:02,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we're pretty dorky to begin with, to even have this show in the first place.

154
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,788
[SPEAKER_11]: But to talk about nothing but DDR for like three hours?

155
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, you couldn't pay me enough.

156
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,691
[SPEAKER_11]: There's other things out there.

157
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,273
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta go outside once in a while.

158
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:13,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Get a job, get a girlfriend or boyfriend.

159
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:16,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, sunlight helps your body make vitamin D. Exactly.

160
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you need to play DDR.

161
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

162
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:19,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Because without it, you'll die.

163
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:24,625
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, we do, when all is said and done, we make a lot of fun at DDR on this show, we really do.

164
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:28,728
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're poking fun at ourselves when we poke fun at DDR, because really, we do have a lot of love for DDR.

165
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I would never have met Jamie, I would never have met Loki if it wasn't for DDR, 2DX and that stuff.

166
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I would never have met anybody here if it wasn't for that, and for that we're thankful.

167
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:42,396
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we kind of always say, you know what, it's kind of like what happens when DDR gets taken outside the arcade.

168
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,657
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what happens with this show.

169
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:45,538
[SPEAKER_11]: This is DDR outside of the arcade.

170
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:47,980
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is just everybody sitting around having a good time, so.

171
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:50,253
[SPEAKER_11]: You think I summed that up pretty good, Jamie?

172
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:51,034
[SPEAKER_22]: I think so.

173
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,854
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty accurate.

174
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:54,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you do this show, Jamie?

175
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:56,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't got nothing else to do.

176
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:57,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, good answer.

177
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:57,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

178
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:03,219
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because, well, it's just fun, you know?

179
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,439
[SPEAKER_02]: We all get together.

180
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:08,080
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like family time, you know?

181
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Because how many people just get around and have quality time?

182
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:11,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

183
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:11,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

184
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:15,442
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I get my little segment where I get to fuss and complain.

185
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, which we'll get to now.

186
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:17,743
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get to that later.

187
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:19,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy everybody's company.

188
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:20,844
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?

189
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:27,126
[SPEAKER_11]: The fun doesn't stop just here because we actually do live shows throughout the week including, Jamie, you've got your own show.

190
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:32,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one called Pump Up the Volume named after the movie because that movie was awesome and had Christian Slater.

191
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it's just a music request show.

192
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I play whatever.

193
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to do an 80s marathon last week.

194
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:43,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I sort of got bored with that and just played whatever.

195
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:45,883
[SPEAKER_11]: So it has nothing to do with DDR, but it's still cool.

196
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:50,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But every so often I will get a mad fit and just play nothing but Bimani just because I feel like it.

197
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,005
[SPEAKER_02]: But the show is on Tuesdays.

198
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-show starts at 7.

199
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:56,186
[SPEAKER_02]: The normal show is 7.30 to 10.30.

200
00:14:56,987 --> 00:15:05,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, as of late, I've just been really bored and starting the show a little bit earlier and extending it a little bit to 12.30 range.

201
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So just tune in and listen as long as you can.

202
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, sounds good.

203
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:18,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Also on this station, Monday night, tomorrow night, 7 o'clock, Diversion, which is our name for the Orange Lounge Radio Remix Show.

204
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where we play all these different Bomani remixes.

205
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Fan-made ones, like things that were picked up in Tournamix and stuff like that.

206
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:25,613
[SPEAKER_11]: All the way to, like...

207
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:30,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Remix has done so well, they're professional quality, and that would be like the Diverse Systems albums.

208
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:41,694
[SPEAKER_11]: We play that stuff on the show, really good Bomani remix stuff, and you know, we're going to be adding to the playlist this week because there was a new remix thing that just came out, but we'll talk about that later in the show, definitely.

209
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:45,157
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we'll get to that later in the show.

210
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:52,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, we have to start off tonight's show the way we always start off the show, because it's tradition, and that's a little segment we call, How was your week?

211
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:53,564
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

212
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:54,465
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to say something real fast, Loki?

213
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:55,930
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

214
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,713
[SPEAKER_02]: He's looking at Anthony.

215
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,517
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a Happy Noodle Boy shirt, which is cool.

216
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:00,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do you do this show, Loki?

217
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm here.

218
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:04,547
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why.

219
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:05,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't.

220
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:07,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you sat on the floor for all of those months.

221
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:12,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I could be getting in three hours of quality Final Fantasy XI time right now.

222
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,272
[SPEAKER_13]: And look at this.

223
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Now who is sitting on the floor?

224
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Who are we forcing to sit on the floor?

225
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:17,715
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy that works at Konami.

226
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:19,076
[SPEAKER_11]: We're making him sit on the floor today.

227
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: But he can sit there and pet Loki's cock.

228
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:22,338
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay.

229
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:23,059
[SPEAKER_11]: He has company.

230
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:25,000
[SPEAKER_11]: He has my cock in his hand, so that's all right.

231
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:28,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you put your cock on our webcam there?

232
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:31,765
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to our webcam, www.orangelongeradio.com, it's right there on the front page.

233
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki's going to show off his cock to all you guys so you know what we're talking about.

234
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:35,027
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

235
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:39,369
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

236
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know what time I got out of bed?

237
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:04,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Quarter after eight.

238
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:06,963
[SPEAKER_02]: My ass was there at nine o'clock.

239
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:07,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

240
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:08,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get rid of that, so it's cool.

241
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:12,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just worked an extra 30 minutes, and it was all good.

242
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:16,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got some extra sleep that day, but I was still tired all day.

243
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished one of my fanfics today.

244
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:20,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally completed it.

245
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on fanfiction.net somewhere.

246
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:25,658
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of fanfic?

247
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I write fanfiction.

248
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you don't want to tell us what kind?

249
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:30,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I write G.I.

250
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:31,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe fanfiction.

251
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,368
[SPEAKER_11]: A real American hero.

252
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:33,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

253
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:34,448
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

254
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also working on other stories, though.

255
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually working on a novel, which is sort of on hold, because guess what?

256
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:41,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to have free time anymore.

257
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:54,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my award letter from ARC, which made me all bouncy, and they still haven't freaking put my money on the stupid website, so I can't get my student loan yet, but that's okay, because in a couple weeks I'm going to have a laptop.

258
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll make it all better.

259
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, ARC, that's the local college here in SAC.

260
00:17:58,652 --> 00:17:59,732
[SPEAKER_02]: American River College.

261
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:03,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you plan to be... They actually have a DDR machine there at the cafeteria.

262
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:06,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you ever going to touch that thing, you think?

263
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I might, but I don't want to get cooties.

264
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:16,639
[SPEAKER_02]: My plan was to go run track on Monday and Wednesday, because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.

265
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think after my Saturday class, I might go play some DDR.

266
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:21,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

267
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:22,361
[SPEAKER_02]: You do.

268
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to say about your week in a day?

269
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:28,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some angst.

270
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:32,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good bit of angst.

271
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Very few times.

272
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,711
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done this, what, 106 weeks now?

273
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:40,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I think maybe two times you came in here not angsty about something.

274
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:42,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this isn't angry angst, okay?

275
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:44,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is real angst.

276
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:47,357
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like on the level of

277
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:52,543
[SPEAKER_02]: It's of the same intensity as teenage high school drama angst, which is pretty intense.

278
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it my fault?

279
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:53,584
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

280
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:54,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's good then.

281
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:56,205
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was your fault, I'd tell you.

282
00:18:57,165 --> 00:18:59,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, now listen up, bitch.

283
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:00,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, good.

284
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:11,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and yesterday, I hung out with Iguana Girl and Tia, and we turned her hair from nearly jet black to bright red.

285
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this like a girls bonding kind of thing?

286
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:17,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Girls bonding thing over low carb ice cream.

287
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:19,172
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did something stupid.

288
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Milk carb ice cream is damn good.

289
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:21,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made with whole cream.

290
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:23,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I did something stupid.

291
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:24,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.

292
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I like your hair, though.

293
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:29,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it like that.

294
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I dyed my bangs blonde.

295
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish you weren't Cam Shies.

296
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:33,443
[SPEAKER_11]: You could show the others.

297
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: They bleached out... They had to bleach out Tia's hair to turn it red.

298
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:39,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, hey, bleach my bangs.

299
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:40,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.

300
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Except the bleach was running out of activation power.

301
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:45,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

302
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, only one side took the bleach very well and the other one's a lot lighter.

303
00:19:52,033 --> 00:19:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it looks okay.

304
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:57,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Except I forgot that since I had dyed my hair black before, the ends are still dark.

305
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:02,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I could get on, this is the only time you're gonna get me on the cam, okay?

306
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:03,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, alright.

307
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:07,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So, pass off the microphone to somebody.

308
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:11,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we'll go to somebody else while Jamie poses on cam with the hair.

309
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:11,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Angel.

310
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Angel, how was your week?

311
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:13,748
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

312
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:13,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

313
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:15,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

314
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:20,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still kind of adapting to certain things, if you want to talk about that.

315
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:22,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Because nobody really knows.

316
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they kind of know, but they don't.

317
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:28,627
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to talk about that for a bit.

318
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:29,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

319
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:29,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

320
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:32,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, sure, sure, go ahead.

321
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:34,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I was reading some other stuff going on.

322
00:20:35,348 --> 00:20:37,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm having a laugh at some other stuff that I'm reading.

323
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:40,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, chat room!

324
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Please type!

325
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:42,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway...

326
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:45,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, damn.

327
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:45,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

328
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:55,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so about three weeks ago, I moved out for the first time in my life, so I live here now.

329
00:20:56,425 --> 00:21:03,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's still very strange for me to say, but I assume I will get used to it as time goes on.

330
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, that's about it, I guess.

331
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I work here, and duh.

332
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:11,234
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's cool.

333
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,407
[SPEAKER_03]: and I live with Magus.

334
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:15,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody hide.

335
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:20,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the bad jokes go on and on and on and on.

336
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,311
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you haven't listened to our show before, 23 Magus is always full of bad jokes.

337
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:28,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Has he added another sheet of toilet paper to his joke book?

338
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:33,815
[SPEAKER_03]: He's added many sheets of toilet paper to his notebook.

339
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could sneak into his room in the middle of the night, take a...

340
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:42,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Match and Sprint, but that would be bad because then I wouldn't have a place to live.

341
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:47,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'll just leave it in the bathroom so his brother can mangle it or something.

342
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:49,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, okay, I guess I'm done.

343
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:53,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go over to somebody else.

344
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Brand new to the show, never been here before.

345
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:57,124
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, Andrew?

346
00:21:57,344 --> 00:21:58,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very tired.

347
00:21:58,245 --> 00:21:58,725
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you doing?

348
00:21:58,945 --> 00:21:59,426
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your week?

349
00:21:59,446 --> 00:21:59,886
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

350
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:00,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Very busy.

351
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:05,249
[SPEAKER_15]: This week was my last day working full time at my job teaching kids.

352
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:09,152
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very excited that I don't have to do that anymore because that was getting very stressful.

353
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:15,478
[SPEAKER_15]: But beyond that, just doing usual stuff, especially avoiding jailbait.

354
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:19,539
[SPEAKER_15]: I seem to have this 16-year-old fan club, which doesn't do me any good.

355
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:21,499
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I've heard a lot of DDR guys have this problem.

356
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Man, I don't know what it is.

357
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,401
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the same problem when I worked at Roundtable.

358
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:33,423
[SPEAKER_13]: For some reason, the fact that I was in a shift manager position, meaning I could provide free pizza.

359
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:34,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there you go.

360
00:22:34,756 --> 00:22:36,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Get a lot of fangirls that way.

361
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:41,937
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, one that would spread rumors, because my mom worked as a yard duty at the junior high.

362
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:47,018
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'd hear rumors, this girl's saying that you guys are dating.

363
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:48,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, what?

364
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:49,979
[SPEAKER_13]: That was funny.

365
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, yeah, it's unusual.

366
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,081
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't know what it is, if it's the DDR or what, or that I look like four years younger than I really am.

367
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:01,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, sounds good.

368
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:31,712
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so I guess we'll come over here then and talk to our other guest, Sigurd, as he's now known.

369
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:33,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Why the name change again?

370
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:34,794
[SPEAKER_11]: You had to go and change your name again.

371
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:37,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody knew who you were before.

372
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,595
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not everybody.

373
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:41,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody cared before you had the flashing foot.

374
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:42,416
[SPEAKER_09]: You were a nobody.

375
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:43,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a nobody.

376
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:49,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I changed it because I figured that would be the best course of action.

377
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:54,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, apparently it doesn't matter, so, you know, I made that name for no good reason.

378
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:55,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well.

379
00:23:57,648 --> 00:23:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so, what are we doing again right now?

380
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:00,369
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week?

381
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:00,910
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

382
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, okay, my week?

383
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:03,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I worked.

384
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:06,413
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much it.

385
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:07,174
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I do.

386
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:08,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week.

387
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:16,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, then, yesterday, I went out to Dave & Buster's, which was really cool because it was my first time.

388
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all those people on DDR Freak...

389
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:28,749
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, that's probably why you didn't get anything from any of the Vivid members last night, because we were all at Dave & Buster's, getting drunk.

390
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

391
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:37,176
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I had a good time, played some games, played that other dancing game.

392
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:39,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you mean Poop It Up?

393
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:41,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean Pump It Up.

394
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Pump It Up.

395
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,421
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

396
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:46,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't discriminate against the other games, it's cool.

397
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:47,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can do the pump jump.

398
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:49,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I worked.

399
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:49,827
[SPEAKER_09]: The end.

400
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:49,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

401
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:18,028
[SPEAKER_09]: and I obviously got my vivid status on DDR Freak, which I swear you guys, Friday, me and Floatwalk, if you don't know who Floatwalk is, I'm not going to tell you, we had like a laugh a minute, and you guys are seriously creeping us out with the DNL Photoshop pictures.

402
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:22,492
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like looking at a Fark.com Photoshop contest, honestly, it was hilarious.

403
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:24,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It was creepy.

404
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:26,484
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really all I can say to that.

405
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:29,911
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, if you happen to want to do it again, it was funny.

406
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:31,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

407
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:36,042
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my week, and today I came to Sacramento.

408
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:37,545
[SPEAKER_09]: The end.

409
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:38,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki,

410
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,139
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your week?

411
00:25:58,179 --> 00:25:58,739
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

412
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Since, you know, I know everybody out there on DDR Freak really cares how your week and your day was.

413
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:06,021
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

414
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:07,421
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm looking right now.

415
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:10,162
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all like, man, we are such big fans.

416
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:10,542
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

417
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:12,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Just don't bother playing the song tonight.

418
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:14,203
[SPEAKER_11]: You can save that until next week.

419
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:17,124
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know about you guys this week and your day.

420
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially you, Loki.

421
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:19,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially me?

422
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:20,284
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?

423
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:22,445
[SPEAKER_13]: You make it look like I had an interesting week.

424
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:25,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so this week what I was doing... Played Final Fantasy.

425
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:26,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I...

426
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did, but that's not the point.

427
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:33,476
[SPEAKER_13]: I did that towards the end of the week.

428
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:35,978
[SPEAKER_13]: The beginning of the week was even better, okay?

429
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:38,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically what happened was... Final Fantasy on two computers.

430
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:40,881
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

431
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:45,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It's too slow to play Final Fantasy, and I don't want to have to buy another copy of it.

432
00:26:45,825 --> 00:26:46,805
[SPEAKER_13]: For what would I do that?

433
00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:54,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, so I was really bored at work, like usual, so I browsed websites.

434
00:26:55,472 --> 00:27:02,897
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when I can't browse Bomani websites because I read them too fast and no one posts fast enough for me to read everything, I browse other things.

435
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:05,739
[SPEAKER_13]: And this week, it was theshadowlands.net.

436
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:11,143
[SPEAKER_13]: And what theshadowlands.net is, is a big paranormal website about all, like, hauntings and shit.

437
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:16,555
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I got this, like, paranormal kick for, like, this whole week, and basically just figuring all this stuff out.

438
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:26,258
[SPEAKER_13]: And so now, for some reason, I'm going to bid on a supposedly haunted possessed doll that's fucked up looking, and I'm gonna buy that.

439
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:27,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are cool.

440
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:35,701
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's supposedly a really fucked up, real, not the pictures that I posted, like, a real doll that is supposedly haunted.

441
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:38,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, and they have photographic proof and shit.

442
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:40,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, so I'm gonna buy that.

443
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,897
[SPEAKER_13]: and put it at my desk at work to creep out my co-worker.

444
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:45,238
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the whole point.

445
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:46,258
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.

446
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:47,719
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought that'd be great.

447
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,680
[SPEAKER_13]: So I might do that.

448
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

449
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:58,186
[SPEAKER_13]: It depends on how expensive it is because I have to also fix my cabinet because I found it earlier this week because the way I have it set up, there's like some conflicts with...

450
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:05,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the controller things I have on there, so I need to buy a new keyboard encoder to get the main cabinet working.

451
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:11,747
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've been playing lots of games, more porno games again, and kicking ass at Gal's Panic and all that stuff, because it's fun.

452
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:14,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what else?

453
00:28:15,368 --> 00:28:15,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I don't know.

454
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:18,370
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually had a pretty interesting weekend.

455
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:24,032
[SPEAKER_13]: On Friday night I went to a bar and hung out there with coworkers that I don't like.

456
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,765
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was a girl that supposedly asked me to dance, but it was so loud in there, I couldn't understand a word she was saying.

457
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard this, outside!

458
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:35,209
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, huh?

459
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,513
[SPEAKER_13]: And then she kind of walked off really pissed.

460
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:42,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know what the hell happened, and my friend standing next to me was like, she asked you to dance.

461
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:44,318
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, oh.

462
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:46,299
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was fun.

463
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,800
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we did that.

464
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,161
[SPEAKER_13]: And they had a giant hippo head with a bagpipe in his mouth.

465
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,161
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought that was kind of neat.

466
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And last night we went and saw some comedians.

467
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:01,002
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a guy that looked like Mr. Bean and another guy that looked like Ray Romano.

468
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:01,863
[SPEAKER_13]: That was pretty cool.

469
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:03,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Then there was this Mexican guy headlining.

470
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,504
[SPEAKER_13]: And because the guy was really cool, I bought his CD.

471
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,884
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to give you a copy, Jamie, so you can play it on your show.

472
00:29:09,144 --> 00:29:09,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

473
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:11,145
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a 25-minute set of his.

474
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember the guy's name for the life of me.

475
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,245
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, I think he was on Comedy Central.

476
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:19,826
[SPEAKER_13]: I could've sworn I remembered his stand-up bit on, uh... It's this funny comedy, you know, I'll play it.

477
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:26,368
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, he was like, there's these people that are drunk rolling, like, next to us and stuff, and he just ripped into them all night, it was great.

478
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:36,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so that's what I did last night, and then, you know, Final Fantasy XI in the middle there, so... Uh, yeah.

479
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,911
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, of course, there's other things I did, but we're gonna get into that later.

480
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,511
[SPEAKER_13]: More stuff I downloaded and whatnot.

481
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:47,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, my week and my day was pretty decent.

482
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:49,056
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the first week back from the East Coast.

483
00:29:49,877 --> 00:29:52,038
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was just kind of trying to catch up on everything.

484
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, last night I was at Dave & Buster's with Sigurd and some of the other folks there.

485
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:02,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went to go play Pump It Up because they don't have any other Bomani there.

486
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:05,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Although somebody told me they have the I Can Dance game there, the iToy game.

487
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:09,554
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I Can Boogie, which is basically iToy Groove in the arcades.

488
00:30:09,614 --> 00:30:11,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I could not find it.

489
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:15,117
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't realize it was there and I should have thought to ask Mel or somebody who goes there all the time.

490
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:17,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.

491
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,238
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucks ass.

492
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, it sucks ass.

493
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:23,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's alright.

494
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:24,542
[SPEAKER_11]: So fine, I didn't get to play it.

495
00:30:27,383 --> 00:30:32,866
[SPEAKER_11]: So instead I decided to play it and I realized I decided to play Pump It Up and then I realized that

496
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:42,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't really played DDR seriously in about three months or so, so I haven't really gotten any more stamina than I had before.

497
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:45,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, Shane gets up on there and wants to play, like, Ninefooters.

498
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:48,448
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell was that song you made us do last that killed me?

499
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:55,133
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Clap Your Hands on Crazy, and, you know, we were just worn out, so we didn't pass it.

500
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,481
[SPEAKER_11]: I seriously thought I was going to die.

501
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:03,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to go out in the parking lot and go, like, it was horrible.

502
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:07,124
[SPEAKER_11]: So I ended up missing like an hour of some good gaming.

503
00:31:07,384 --> 00:31:11,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Some good feeding quarters into the giant crane machine because I was going to die.

504
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:19,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually, I experienced the same thing you felt, except I'm really out of shape because I haven't played DDR in months.

505
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:21,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots of months.

506
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:24,829
[SPEAKER_13]: And I went and played seven footers on doubles and I was out of breath.

507
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:28,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, heart attack out of breath, and that's really sad.

508
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:35,420
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I'm working on the cabinet, it's gonna be done, DDR will be able to be played, and I will get back into shape again.

509
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,861
[SPEAKER_11]: How is that cabinet coming along?

510
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:42,084
[SPEAKER_11]: You built, now for those that haven't been listening to the show for, well, I mean, that's a lot of you guys tonight, I frankly know.

511
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:46,527
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been building your own home cabinet, which is like your dream machine.

512
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us a little bit more about this cabinet you've been building.

513
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this thing's basically an all-in-one Bomani cabinet and arcade cabinet.

514
00:31:51,928 --> 00:31:55,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, the first part of it's done, which is the main part of it.

515
00:31:55,189 --> 00:32:04,373
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have a four-player kind of control panel with two of the players having six buttons, three and four having just four buttons.

516
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:06,694
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's basically just set up for MAME right now.

517
00:32:06,754 --> 00:32:14,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Later on, though, I'm working on a setup for DDR, Dance Maniacs, 2DX, and Poppin' Music all together.

518
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:15,787
[SPEAKER_13]: and so on.

519
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:45,698
[SPEAKER_13]: I was forced to do this by them.

520
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:56,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I was forced to spend $3,000 to fix up a nice cabinet so I have working games because I like playing arcade games and I refuse to go to an arcade that has broken games.

521
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:02,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they should put all the Golfland children in a pen and put like spider stomp in it.

522
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:04,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And just leave them there.

523
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:06,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll actually stomp on the children.

524
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:09,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that would be awesome!

525
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:14,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like a giant troubled board game instead of having dice in the middle have children in the pop-o-matic bubble.

526
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:15,912
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be wonderful.

527
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And they bang it and they go pop!

528
00:33:17,894 --> 00:33:19,675
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish they had like a tail at Golfland.

529
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:22,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many seconds they scream is how long you get to move.

530
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:27,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's kinematic trouble in giant size, Eep.

531
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:32,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Or how about a giant catapult with piano wire above them?

532
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooooooh!

533
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:37,191
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, if you kill them, you have to get more children.

534
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:38,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that people have to breed.

535
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:41,593
[SPEAKER_13]: They're gonna breed anyways.

536
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:42,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're stupid.

537
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:45,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think that they should make standardized testing for breeding.

538
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:49,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only are they gonna breed, they're breeding at younger and younger ages these days.

539
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:52,516
[SPEAKER_11]: There's gonna be like a baby that has a baby.

540
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:53,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wait.

541
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:54,377
[SPEAKER_02]: A ten-year-old had a baby.

542
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was a bad situation that produced it, but still.

543
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care what they say about the tradition...

544
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:28,444
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the whole Christian look of this?

545
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:29,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-uh, no.

546
00:34:29,425 --> 00:34:30,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on where you live.

547
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:32,087
[SPEAKER_02]: People are doing it early.

548
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:42,334
[SPEAKER_13]: You see, now, if I lived in Vacaville, at least there'd be plenty of sheep and stuff, but, you know, I don't have that kind of convenience here in, you know, Folsom.

549
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:43,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you love animals?

550
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:47,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say about the whole little kids having kids.

551
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:55,203
[SPEAKER_09]: My middle school, we had a couple kids there have children, and that's back in Kansas, so you know there's nothing to do there.

552
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:58,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for, you know, family values.

553
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:03,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Different strokes for different folks.

554
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:03,518
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

555
00:35:03,998 --> 00:35:04,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are stroking it.

556
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,603
[SPEAKER_11]: And if more people stroked it, we wouldn't have a baby outbreak.

557
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:08,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

558
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:09,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

559
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:13,108
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why for the whole anti, you know...

560
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:16,808
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it they're doing in, was it in Texas, I think?

561
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:23,173
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole abstinence, teaching abstinence instead of safe, you know, forms of intercourse.

562
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:26,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, they should just teach the joy of masturbation.

563
00:35:29,398 --> 00:35:31,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Why go out when you can get it at home?

564
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,323
[SPEAKER_11]: On that note, I think we're going to go ahead and take a break.

565
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:42,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we come back from this break, I definitely, and I think it's hilarious because a lot of people that are listening to this show right now are like,

566
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Why didn't you guys play the song at 6.30?

567
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:47,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, nobody said we were going to play the song at 6.30.

568
00:35:48,336 --> 00:35:53,779
[SPEAKER_11]: We said we were going to play it during the show, which runs between 6.30 and 9.30.

569
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:58,081
[SPEAKER_11]: And if that happens to be at 9.29, you all just have to deal.

570
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:00,642
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe we'll do 9.28.

571
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:01,662
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

572
00:36:01,802 --> 00:36:02,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

573
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:04,964
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we'll get it in eventually here.

574
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,304
[SPEAKER_11]: When we feel like it.

575
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:07,465
[SPEAKER_11]: When Jamie says it's time.

576
00:36:09,386 --> 00:36:10,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Lord knows when that'll be.

577
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:11,929
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

578
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:12,510
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

579
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,993
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually, no, we do have some fun stuff coming up for you when we get back.

580
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:18,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we can talk about DDR because, huh?

581
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:18,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I will.

582
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:19,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I will play.

583
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,782
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do some Akira this break, actually, for those folks.

584
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:22,903
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

585
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:23,304
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

586
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:34,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Since everybody's been relatively good, even though there has been some shit talking on the forums out there, and that makes me a little bit angry, I guess we can do another little tease here.

587
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,540
[SPEAKER_11]: How about a tease?

588
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys want another little tease?

589
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:37,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Go tease it, Rob.

590
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:39,302
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to tease it right now, you guys.

591
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:39,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

592
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:41,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's it.

593
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:42,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

594
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:45,546
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a tease.

595
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:45,906
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

596
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:50,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so now that that tease has been done, let's go to a break.

597
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:52,859
[SPEAKER_11]: When we come back, I think we'll actually talk about some DDR.

598
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Make it big!

599
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to talk about how Sigurd's internet penis just grew enormous this week.

600
00:36:58,862 --> 00:36:59,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Enormous.

601
00:37:00,022 --> 00:37:01,563
[SPEAKER_11]: And people want us to talk hints.

602
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:06,545
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to talk hints, or lack thereof, when we come back from this break.

603
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:10,087
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will also be giving hints as well.

604
00:37:11,621 --> 00:37:27,357
[SPEAKER_13]: but you don't even work for Konami and you've never played- I can give him- THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVE INSIDER INFO YOU FREAKIN' MORONS THAT EVERY- THAT ANYONE ELSE CAN GET BUT YOU'RE JUST TOO FUCKING STUPID TO REALIZE THAT WE TOLD YOU, LIKE, FOUR FUCKING MONTHS AGO OR EVEN BEFORE THAT WHAT THE HELL WAS GONNA BE IN THE-

605
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:28,539
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

606
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:29,139
[SPEAKER_13]: That's alright.

607
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:33,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna tell you that I told you so, and you can just kiss my ass again.

608
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:39,912
[SPEAKER_13]: You can blow me just like you blew me before when it came down to, you know, fucking saying, Oh, Sakura's not gonna be in DDR Extreme.

609
00:37:40,212 --> 00:37:40,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you!

610
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:41,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

611
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:43,096
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I have to say about that.

612
00:37:44,705 --> 00:37:46,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone's full of the anger tonight.

613
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:48,628
[SPEAKER_11]: That Loki guy screams into the microphone too much.

614
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:49,468
[SPEAKER_11]: He screams.

615
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:51,390
[SPEAKER_11]: He's screaming in the microphone.

616
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Why doesn't somebody give him a drug?

617
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:56,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't he just shut up and play the song?

618
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:57,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Just shut up.

619
00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:57,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us a hint.

620
00:37:58,094 --> 00:37:58,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us a hint.

621
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:00,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a hint for you.

622
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:01,997
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Bite My Ass.

623
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:04,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, now, be nice.

624
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:08,041
[SPEAKER_11]: We want the listeners to come back when they realize that we're not that bad at people.

625
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:08,802
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not that bad.

626
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:09,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Really not.

627
00:38:09,182 --> 00:38:10,743
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just messing with you guys tonight.

628
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:11,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

629
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:11,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

630
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:15,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously though, just listen.

631
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:17,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stay patient.

632
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Patience is a virtue.

633
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:19,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Be virtuous.

634
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:22,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's hard, but you can wait.

635
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:23,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

636
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:24,366
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

637
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,886
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be back after some Akira.

638
00:38:43,644 --> 00:38:44,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

639
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:24,173
Thanks for watching!

640
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:42,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

641
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:09,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

642
00:42:24,122 --> 00:42:25,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

643
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:07,272
Thank you for watching!

644
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

645
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:45,428
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

646
00:46:06,227 --> 00:46:12,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

647
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,431
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

648
00:46:15,012 --> 00:46:19,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

649
00:46:20,034 --> 00:46:22,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, we are back with Orange Lounge Radio.

650
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:22,956
[SPEAKER_11]: That's our buddy Mel B.

651
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:24,593
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

652
00:46:49,955 --> 00:46:50,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, hell, we all need to go.

653
00:46:51,057 --> 00:46:53,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dan and I are going to have ourselves a hotel.

654
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:57,250
[SPEAKER_11]: You know Konami is having a showing there at Classic Gaming Expo.

655
00:46:57,591 --> 00:46:59,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there will be some Twinbee for me to play.

656
00:47:01,676 --> 00:47:01,936
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

657
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:06,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear that Konami's going to make a showing, but I can't say what's going on.

658
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,844
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm very glad, though, that it's in San Jose this year instead of in Vegas, because that would have been pricey.

659
00:47:10,904 --> 00:47:12,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, at least it's drivable here.

660
00:47:12,486 --> 00:47:22,815
[SPEAKER_02]: The only good thing about it being in Vegas is that I would have been able to have seen Mar and John, but I'm making plans at another time if someone has $250 to lend me.

661
00:47:25,996 --> 00:47:26,336
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

662
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:28,318
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a hint.

663
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:29,879
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not a hint.

664
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:30,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie wants money.

665
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,761
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a hint.

666
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:38,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Be careful with the way you use the word hint on tonight's show because people are going to run with it.

667
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:41,888
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't think I said that on purpose?

668
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:43,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm teasing them.

669
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:55,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you guys know, if myself, Loki, or DarkSakura say something as a hint, we're pretty much talking out our ass because there's this little thing called NDA, called the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which means that even though our buddy...

670
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:59,436
[SPEAKER_11]: works at Konami, he can't tell us what's going on or they will fire his ass.

671
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:00,456
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want that to happen to him.

672
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:02,316
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't want that to happen.

673
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:05,437
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can disclose anything I want because they can fire me all they want.

674
00:48:06,097 --> 00:48:07,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't work for them.

675
00:48:08,537 --> 00:48:08,838
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

676
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:09,898
[SPEAKER_13]: I will disclose it all.

677
00:48:10,478 --> 00:48:11,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything.

678
00:48:12,618 --> 00:48:13,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything.

679
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:15,959
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, it's surprising.

680
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,220
[SPEAKER_13]: This information's been out forever and people just don't realize it.

681
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:23,609
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't think of anything.

682
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:39,354
[SPEAKER_11]: What we can talk about, I can mention this, is that a few months ago, and you can go back in the Orange Lounge Radio story archives, and you can look at, we had a story that talked about how some folks were hacking the disk for DDR, what disk were they hacking back at that point?

683
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:41,692
[SPEAKER_13]: It was probably a collection.

684
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:43,153
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a master list.

685
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:44,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here's how it works.

686
00:48:44,874 --> 00:48:51,178
[SPEAKER_13]: When they're making the games, there's a master list of all the songs that have been in all the games and that are going to be in all the games.

687
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:53,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, basically, whatever they're working on up to that point.

688
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,081
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a master list.

689
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:59,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Think of it like, if you're familiar with MAME, there's a master ROM list.

690
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:00,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, this is a master song list.

691
00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:09,331
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's going to contain everything from the arcade versions, the home versions, and home versions that they're working on at the moment.

692
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:10,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

693
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:36,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing right now, as I said before, you know, there's some songs in there that they, you know, they're all, oh, those are, you know, you know, don't believe that, because, you know, back in the day when DDR Max was first coming out, and remember there was that Orion Civilization, supposedly remix of that, but it was just under a different name, well, everyone's like, oh, well, those lists are wrong, and then they're saying, oh, well, Nemesis is supposed to be in Max 2 or something like that, or

694
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:37,980
[SPEAKER_13]: D.D.R.

695
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Extreme

696
00:49:52,296 --> 00:49:54,419
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree that it's a dumb name.

697
00:50:10,313 --> 00:50:11,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, it's a dumb name for a song.

698
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:13,857
[SPEAKER_13]: That's so fucking wrong!

699
00:50:13,897 --> 00:50:17,220
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there it was, you know, all in its piece of shit glory.

700
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,882
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we point and laugh.

701
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:26,190
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but there are songs, I mean, a lot of songs actually that are in there that are going to be in, you know, extremes.

702
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,893
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I told you so.

703
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:35,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually trying to find that list from when we posted it.

704
00:50:35,524 --> 00:50:39,866
[SPEAKER_11]: We were posting that list, and I distinctly remember that Diving was in that list.

705
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:42,686
[SPEAKER_11]: It has been confirmed that Diving is going to be in DDR Extreme.

706
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,386
[SPEAKER_11]: That's no secret.

707
00:50:43,427 --> 00:50:44,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Four Strings Diving.

708
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:51,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I remember we were talking about that list on an earlier show, and I saw Diving, and I said, oh, that's another song on that Four Strings album, so Diving must be in there.

709
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:54,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to think of it, that was also in the pre-show.

710
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:55,170
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the CD.

711
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there you go.

712
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, okay, so...

713
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:05,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to dig through the archives a little more and we'll go through that list again and we'll see, you know, maybe there's some song titles in there.

714
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,396
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

715
00:51:07,476 --> 00:51:09,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Konami capable of throwing red herrings our way?

716
00:51:09,758 --> 00:51:10,178
[SPEAKER_11]: You bet.

717
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:15,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that there are songs that are supposed to be in DDR that don't make it into DDR in the final cut?

718
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:15,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

719
00:51:16,303 --> 00:51:16,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, there are.

720
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:19,485
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are songs that get, you know, cancelled.

721
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:23,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, for example, DDR Ultramix, The Humpty Dance.

722
00:51:24,529 --> 00:51:27,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I would have dug it if The Humpty Dance was in DDR.

723
00:51:28,812 --> 00:51:29,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Been awesome.

724
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:30,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

725
00:51:30,566 --> 00:51:32,866
[SPEAKER_02]: But how would you make steps for that and get it to look right?

726
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:37,567
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll come back to this subject a little later, but I wanted to keep things moving.

727
00:51:37,647 --> 00:51:38,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually wanted to talk to Andrew.

728
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:42,108
[SPEAKER_11]: He's sitting there in the corner, and he's never been here before.

729
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:44,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you enjoying things so far?

730
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:45,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

731
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:47,249
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems like everybody wants to talk to me.

732
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,489
[SPEAKER_11]: You came on a good night.

733
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:52,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody heard you were going to be here, and now our caps are breaking and everything.

734
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:56,670
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I heard, and I'm really happy that I can contribute like this to your show.

735
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,291
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.

736
00:51:57,491 --> 00:51:58,411
[SPEAKER_11]: You should come here more often.

737
00:51:58,611 --> 00:51:59,011
[SPEAKER_15]: I should.

738
00:51:59,111 --> 00:51:59,851
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

739
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:06,294
[SPEAKER_11]: In all seriousness, for those who don't know you, you're the guy, and the reason why I wanted you to be on the show is because you dress up like a pirate when you play DDR.

740
00:52:06,394 --> 00:52:06,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

741
00:52:07,035 --> 00:52:07,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

742
00:52:07,695 --> 00:52:08,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

743
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:12,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, at first it started because I'm just a massive attention whore.

744
00:52:13,018 --> 00:52:13,878
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, honestly.

745
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,500
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, I don't know.

746
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:25,324
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I got there, and I just started playing, and some people would watch, but I was never a freestyler because I'm too white for that shit.

747
00:52:26,224 --> 00:52:27,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, I just was like,

748
00:52:28,263 --> 00:52:34,766
[SPEAKER_15]: I just stopped off at some party store after work one night, bought a cheap pirate costume, went into Golfland.

749
00:52:34,786 --> 00:52:37,267
[SPEAKER_15]: I noticed I turn around and there's like 40 or 50 people.

750
00:52:38,507 --> 00:52:43,109
[SPEAKER_15]: There's like 40 or 50 people watching me, so I'm just like, okay, I'll keep this up.

751
00:52:43,149 --> 00:52:45,510
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just kind of whore it around in my signature now.

752
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a Toadie007 on GameFAQs, DDR Freak.

753
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:51,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Get a hold of me on the NorCal forums.

754
00:52:53,052 --> 00:52:53,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Johnny Depp Fetish

755
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:19,315
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it was just an inside joke with some people at work.

756
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:25,485
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a friend that owns a production company called Shiver Me Timbers Productions and it kind of went off from there.

757
00:53:29,033 --> 00:53:31,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I brought that thing into work the other day.

758
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:35,797
[SPEAKER_15]: My boss apparently lets me dress up like a pirate for work, so I thought that was kind of cool.

759
00:53:36,017 --> 00:53:37,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we all know the Roseville Golf Line.

760
00:53:37,558 --> 00:53:41,060
[SPEAKER_11]: When you go to play DDR there, there's something that we call the hecklers, or the assholes.

761
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,362
[SPEAKER_11]: All these people there that make fun of you when you're playing DDR.

762
00:53:44,942 --> 00:53:45,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Fag!

763
00:53:45,743 --> 00:53:47,944
[SPEAKER_11]: You look like a fag when you play that game!

764
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:48,905
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a fag!

765
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:49,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh wait, you're a chick.

766
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:51,486
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a fag!

767
00:53:51,786 --> 00:53:55,989
[SPEAKER_15]: I get that anyway, even when I'm not playing DDR, but you know those people, they can kiss my ass, I don't care.

768
00:53:56,229 --> 00:53:57,209
[SPEAKER_11]: But how bad is it?

769
00:53:57,229 --> 00:53:58,490
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what's the worst you've heard?

770
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Dressed up, not only playing DDR, but being a pirate playing DDR.

771
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:03,031
[SPEAKER_11]: What are some of the things you've heard?

772
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:06,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Ironically, I don't think I've gotten any shit for the pirate thing.

773
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:07,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

774
00:54:07,652 --> 00:54:09,933
[SPEAKER_15]: If anything, I get shit when I bar rape.

775
00:54:10,813 --> 00:54:14,354
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought you guys were going to cue up a boo sound effect when I say that.

776
00:54:14,374 --> 00:54:14,414
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

777
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:15,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I get heckled on the show.

778
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:15,975
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

779
00:54:17,347 --> 00:54:21,954
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the pirate thing, most people just kind of go up and go like, what in the hell is that guy doing?

780
00:54:22,114 --> 00:54:29,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, I mean, you can see the little strings on the beard, you know, it looks totally fake, you know, but I don't really get anything.

781
00:54:29,404 --> 00:54:32,889
[SPEAKER_15]: It just confuses the hell out of most people, so they think it's kind of funny.

782
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:38,042
[SPEAKER_15]: and it really ticks off all the good freestylers because nobody pays attention to them.

783
00:54:38,082 --> 00:54:39,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, we have good freestylers in this town?

784
00:54:39,663 --> 00:54:40,323
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm just kidding.

785
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

786
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,103
[SPEAKER_14]: That's totally a joke.

787
00:54:43,123 --> 00:54:44,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

788
00:54:44,524 --> 00:54:45,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, yeah.

789
00:54:45,704 --> 00:54:49,325
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no way I'm serious there.

790
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:52,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you going to take the pirate to any DDR tournaments in the future?

791
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:53,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I will try.

792
00:54:53,366 --> 00:54:55,907
[SPEAKER_15]: I've only been to like two so far and I got...

793
00:54:56,267 --> 00:54:56,607
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

794
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:57,148
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

795
00:54:57,188 --> 00:54:57,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

796
00:54:57,749 --> 00:54:59,570
[SPEAKER_15]: There's supposed to be a big one in Milpitas...

797
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:19,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Friday?

798
00:55:19,992 --> 00:55:21,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it's like an improv tournament, I want to say?

799
00:55:21,993 --> 00:55:24,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I have a wedding on that day, actually.

800
00:55:24,234 --> 00:55:26,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my alter ego I wanted to take out for that.

801
00:55:26,476 --> 00:55:27,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, okay.

802
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:29,337
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think I'm going to be able to do it, which is too bad.

803
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:30,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

804
00:55:30,337 --> 00:55:32,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know if it's in the afternoon or at night?

805
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:33,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's like a night.

806
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:35,860
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Friday night, which kind of sucks for you if you're out of town.

807
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get those Friday night things.

808
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:40,983
[SPEAKER_11]: But sometimes you have to do a tournament when you can do it, when the arcade owner says you can do it.

809
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:42,683
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's a Friday night, I might be able to do it.

810
00:55:42,723 --> 00:55:45,065
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to enter, but it'll be all good.

811
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:45,745
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

812
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:53,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, okay, so, um... Anything else you wanted to share about... Oh, is there anything you want to plug while you're here?

813
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,131
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when guests come on talk shows, they plug things.

814
00:55:56,151 --> 00:55:56,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything you want to plug?

815
00:55:57,671 --> 00:55:58,772
[SPEAKER_11]: You said you had a production company?

816
00:55:59,132 --> 00:55:59,992
[SPEAKER_11]: No, my friend, my friend.

817
00:56:00,032 --> 00:56:01,973
[SPEAKER_11]: You did a DDR video recently, didn't you?

818
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:04,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was in a DDR video.

819
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,194
[SPEAKER_15]: I whored that onto my live journal.

820
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:09,099
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just a cam whore, I guess.

821
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:14,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you want to give out that link on your live journal, but... Do you want me to give it out in the chat room?

822
00:56:14,525 --> 00:56:15,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.

823
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:17,007
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll give out the video link in the chat room.

824
00:56:17,067 --> 00:56:20,551
[SPEAKER_15]: I look like shit in the video, but still, you know, I don't care.

825
00:56:21,192 --> 00:56:24,435
[SPEAKER_15]: The more people that know my name, the bigger my ego gets, so... Right on.

826
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:25,356
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all good.

827
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:26,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Right on.

828
00:56:26,978 --> 00:56:27,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew, by the way...

829
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:38,248
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to join our chatroom, just head on over to www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com, you can check out the camera while you're there, and then you'll just click on chat.

830
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:52,513
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you have a friend who's trying to get into the station to listen to us, because we have such a great show and it has nothing to do with the Your Rain song whatsoever, your friends want to hear Andrew talk some more, we are going to play that song again at 9.40.

831
00:56:52,593 --> 00:56:56,454
[SPEAKER_11]: And Andrew will talk some more, maybe then too.

832
00:56:57,054 --> 00:56:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, we have more than one Andrew now.

833
00:56:59,095 --> 00:56:59,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone hide.

834
00:57:00,036 --> 00:57:00,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.

835
00:57:00,696 --> 00:57:01,316
[SPEAKER_11]: It's horrible.

836
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:02,357
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

837
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:05,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I found the link here.

838
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:12,482
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like it's shivermetimbersproductions.com Yeah, my friend John, who was a colleague of mine at work, he produced that video.

839
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:14,263
[SPEAKER_15]: I owe him a lot of lunches for that.

840
00:57:14,423 --> 00:57:16,344
[SPEAKER_15]: So go ahead and check his site out.

841
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:18,245
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

842
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,383
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

843
00:57:40,546 --> 00:57:44,529
[SPEAKER_13]: This stuff I think I posted was just the licensed tracks that I recognized.

844
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:51,633
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a story that was posted on May 7th on our website, and you can go back into our archives and have a look.

845
00:57:52,213 --> 00:57:57,497
[SPEAKER_11]: And these were the songs that were on the master song list that we speculated could be in DDR Extremes.

846
00:57:57,517 --> 00:58:02,980
[SPEAKER_11]: This is nothing new, and certainly Shane is not going to confirm or deny anything and break his NDA, but...

847
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:09,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, if you look at it, since it is licensed stuff, you guys already know what it is.

848
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:17,334
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, hey, the ones that you see that you know are in the game, they are totally in the game.

849
00:58:17,974 --> 00:58:20,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, the ones that are in the game, they are definitely in the game.

850
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:28,277
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have on there, Simply Being Loved, which we know is in the game, Diving, we know that's in the game, Ride on Time, I don't think we ever figured out what that one was, did we?

851
00:58:29,137 --> 00:58:29,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know about that one.

852
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:33,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Come Into My World, which makes me think of the Kylie Minogue song.

853
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:40,536
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

854
00:58:57,893 --> 00:59:00,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Planet Rock, that did turn up in Extreme, we do know that.

855
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:09,965
[SPEAKER_11]: The Boys of Summer, DJ Sammy Song, we had Heaven and Max 2, we thought we'd get it in Extreme because it was on this list, but haven't heard about it yet.

856
00:59:10,386 --> 00:59:15,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Humpty Dance, they're saying was possibly something that was coming over from Xbox, don't know.

857
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:18,314
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mickey, so we don't know.

858
00:59:19,475 --> 00:59:20,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know.

859
00:59:21,097 --> 00:59:21,217
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

860
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:38,413
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we do know is that in our chatroom it was said by one of our folks, I think it was Mel B over at DDR Spot, did say, hey guess what guys, if you're trying to find the list to Ultramix 2, which has, I think he said 46, I'm sorry, I'm going to look for what he said, where is it?

861
00:59:40,686 --> 00:59:41,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what he said.

862
00:59:41,307 --> 00:59:46,010
[SPEAKER_11]: It was something like 46 more songs that have not been in DDR before.

863
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:47,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it 56?

864
00:59:48,011 --> 00:59:48,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, 56.

865
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:50,273
[SPEAKER_11]: 56 more songs that have not been in DDR before.

866
00:59:50,894 --> 00:59:51,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

867
00:59:52,315 --> 00:59:54,336
[SPEAKER_11]: And none of them are on that master list.

868
00:59:54,536 --> 00:59:56,898
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't even bother looking, because they're not on there.

869
00:59:57,378 --> 00:59:57,959
[SPEAKER_11]: So forget it.

870
00:59:58,459 --> 00:59:58,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.

871
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course he could be just throwing us off.

872
01:00:01,121 --> 01:00:01,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a hint?

873
01:00:01,742 --> 01:00:02,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a hint?

874
01:00:02,402 --> 01:00:03,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you guys dropping a hint?

875
01:00:03,483 --> 01:00:04,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a hint?

876
01:00:04,024 --> 01:00:05,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that 56 mean something?

877
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:07,827
[SPEAKER_10]: If you flip the 6 upside down, it's a 9.

878
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:09,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it's a Japanese character.

879
01:00:09,629 --> 01:00:10,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's the thing.

880
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:11,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing about that.

881
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:17,837
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been a big, huge span between when Party Collection came out and when these new mixes are coming out.

882
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:21,020
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously, you know, there's going to be a lot of stuff that's not on there.

883
01:00:21,514 --> 01:00:39,368
[SPEAKER_13]: and I mean there's a lot of stuff that would be on there this is just stuff that they were developing a while back so there's a lot of work being done right now on it so it's not surprising that there's not a lot on there but there's some other ones that were not licensed songs that were on the master list that I've heard might be in there

884
01:00:39,989 --> 01:00:56,432
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, I'm not saying anything, but, uh, there was stuff that we knew about a long time ago, and I think I even quoted on the show seeing what the songs were a long time ago, but, you know, I can't see now because, uh, my balls are tied.

885
01:00:56,592 --> 01:00:59,833
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I just, I cannot say anything.

886
01:01:00,193 --> 01:01:00,853
[SPEAKER_13]: But, that's it.

887
01:01:05,154 --> 01:01:05,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

888
01:01:06,826 --> 01:01:08,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like doing another tease.

889
01:01:08,147 --> 01:01:08,767
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you guys think?

890
01:01:08,807 --> 01:01:09,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do another tease.

891
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:12,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's tease them again.

892
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:13,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it.

893
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:15,352
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do it soon, you guys.

894
01:01:15,752 --> 01:01:17,894
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to make this last, alright?

895
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:21,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We only get to have fun like this, what, once every 106 shows?

896
01:01:22,117 --> 01:01:22,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

897
01:01:22,477 --> 01:01:23,838
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys won't listen to us otherwise.

898
01:01:24,238 --> 01:01:25,459
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to tease it now.

899
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:25,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

900
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, a secret.

901
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:40,550
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, after he plays, I'll probably get to have this little one-on-one chat with him, so if you guys are just sticking around for the Your Rain remix, you might miss out on some other stuff.

902
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:42,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to chat with you first.

903
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:45,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to get that stuff over with, because I have to get something out there.

904
01:01:46,914 --> 01:01:48,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, I've got to set some people straight.

905
01:01:49,295 --> 01:01:50,736
[SPEAKER_09]: So then forget what I said.

906
01:01:51,597 --> 01:01:53,958
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can leave right after that song plays.

907
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:56,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Or no, you can't.

908
01:01:57,781 --> 01:01:59,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, hold on, let's tease.

909
01:02:01,243 --> 01:02:01,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's enough.

910
01:02:02,044 --> 01:02:03,405
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty sexy, I like that.

911
01:02:03,425 --> 01:02:04,625
[SPEAKER_11]: That was very sexy.

912
01:02:04,906 --> 01:02:05,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

913
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:08,708
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounded like you touched my something, yeah.

914
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:11,450
[SPEAKER_13]: You touched my... Oh yeah.

915
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I think she said boob.

916
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:14,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I think she said boob.

917
01:02:14,212 --> 01:02:15,533
[SPEAKER_11]: How many DDRs are going to love that?

918
01:02:15,573 --> 01:02:16,413
[SPEAKER_11]: You touched my boob.

919
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:16,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

920
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:24,346
[SPEAKER_13]: For everyone that enjoyed our pre-show, we had porn on the webcam, but no one seemed, I don't know if anyone paid attention to that.

921
01:02:25,806 --> 01:02:27,247
[SPEAKER_13]: I knew I should have got here earlier.

922
01:02:29,768 --> 01:02:35,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we will get to it soon, but first, I want to talk to our buddy Sigurd.

923
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:37,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to go to commercial first?

924
01:02:38,572 --> 01:02:42,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Sigurd wants to go to commercial first, so we can, you're gonna, you're pissing off the chat room.

925
01:02:45,485 --> 01:02:48,226
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, when we get back, we're going to talk to Sigurd.

926
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:51,026
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also going to do some Bomani match game tonight.

927
01:02:51,407 --> 01:02:55,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And then maybe we'll do the song, but maybe we'll have a cage match before that.

928
01:02:55,607 --> 01:02:55,867
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

929
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:56,188
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

930
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:56,588
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

931
01:02:56,748 --> 01:02:57,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Depends what time we're at.

932
01:02:58,308 --> 01:02:58,828
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have a look.

933
01:02:59,168 --> 01:02:59,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

934
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:01,609
[SPEAKER_11]: God, some people are going to kick our ass if we don't do it soon.

935
01:03:03,629 --> 01:03:04,189
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

936
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:05,289
[SPEAKER_11]: You can wait at how long?

937
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:07,950
[SPEAKER_11]: You can wait a few more minutes for us, guys.

938
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:09,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, it's for us.

939
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:10,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, come on.

940
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, guys.

941
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:12,051
[SPEAKER_11]: You're pals, Sky.

942
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:12,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Be good, sports.

943
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:24,316
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be a song, holy shit, a song in DDR Extreme that will have mix in the title.

944
01:03:28,663 --> 01:03:29,504
[SPEAKER_11]: That was an awesome hint.

945
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:29,964
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

946
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:36,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to what I think was probably most people's favorite Akira Yamaoka song previously.

947
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a lot of people.

948
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a stereotypical favorite Akira Yamaoka song.

949
01:03:40,073 --> 01:03:40,553
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know.

950
01:03:40,613 --> 01:03:42,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, guys, I might change for you guys tonight.

951
01:03:42,355 --> 01:03:42,675
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

952
01:03:42,975 --> 01:03:44,877
[SPEAKER_11]: But from Night Style, let's take this break.

953
01:03:44,957 --> 01:03:45,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Lionski.

954
01:03:45,818 --> 01:03:46,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

955
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:47,039
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

956
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:41,030
Thank you for watching!

957
01:06:48,823 --> 01:06:49,464
Thank you for watching.

958
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:18,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Atsu no Owari Uri no Tsuake, Masa de Ode Takano ga Babushii Keiyokutai no Koro no Sakotsu na Kazuki ni Shitei wa Kaware Shitei ga Uchigateta Omaiku wa Hayase no Imeishan, Mayari no Waichikari no Tamawaketa Teretara soba wa Rake datte Yume ni Sota, Kishitei yuunan no Komogari

959
01:10:31,503 --> 01:10:32,344
Abadito Voleo

960
01:10:57,012 --> 01:10:58,634
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

961
01:11:33,138 --> 01:11:42,496
[SPEAKER_19]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

962
01:11:43,224 --> 01:11:47,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

963
01:11:47,347 --> 01:11:48,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we talk about that?

964
01:11:48,588 --> 01:11:50,929
[SPEAKER_22]: No subject will ever be taboo.

965
01:11:51,229 --> 01:11:54,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

966
01:11:55,392 --> 01:11:57,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

967
01:11:58,434 --> 01:12:03,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

968
01:12:04,338 --> 01:12:05,619
[SPEAKER_16]: I collect your fucking head.

969
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like this fucker here.

970
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:13,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

971
01:12:14,145 --> 01:12:17,506
[SPEAKER_12]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

972
01:12:18,446 --> 01:12:24,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

973
01:12:26,089 --> 01:12:29,890
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

974
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:35,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back, Orange Lounge Radio.

975
01:12:36,454 --> 01:12:50,736
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, I have to say, if you haven't figured it out, I'm kind of reading the DDR Freak thread on Xtreme during the show, and about the last four pages have been people talking about this show, and it's really starting to piss some of your moderators off.

976
01:12:51,878 --> 01:12:53,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry I'm not there to help.

977
01:12:53,379 --> 01:12:55,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm contributing to the problem.

978
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:55,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop spamming DDR Freak, please.

979
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to have to go clean up.

980
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:20,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the moderators over there aren't exactly happy cappers right now because you guys have hijacked the thread, so please steer things back on course.

981
01:13:20,216 --> 01:13:21,337
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have forums of our own.

982
01:13:21,377 --> 01:13:23,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody posts there, but hey, you know, you could be a trendsetter.

983
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:26,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

984
01:13:28,102 --> 01:13:28,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe later.

985
01:13:29,323 --> 01:13:31,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

986
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:33,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on.

987
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:34,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

988
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:36,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I said I wanted to talk to Sigurd.

989
01:13:37,009 --> 01:13:38,432
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's talk to Sigurd.

990
01:13:38,753 --> 01:13:39,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Loki.

991
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:40,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You said moving on.

992
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:42,640
[SPEAKER_13]: That was another song in DDR.

993
01:13:43,863 --> 01:13:44,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Could it be?

994
01:13:45,931 --> 01:13:51,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I don't know shit about what is going to be in Extreme or Ultramix 2 or anything down the line.

995
01:13:52,272 --> 01:13:56,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if I did know, I don't know as far as you're concerned, okay?

996
01:13:57,193 --> 01:13:57,933
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it, alright?

997
01:13:58,374 --> 01:13:59,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

998
01:14:01,294 --> 01:14:01,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Again.

999
01:14:02,714 --> 01:14:03,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Sigurd, how are you?

1000
01:14:04,275 --> 01:14:05,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing pretty good.

1001
01:14:05,335 --> 01:14:08,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so, no secret now, you're a Vivid member on The Freak.

1002
01:14:09,176 --> 01:14:09,896
[SPEAKER_11]: That I am.

1003
01:14:09,996 --> 01:14:12,697
[SPEAKER_11]: So that must mean... I work for Konami.

1004
01:14:12,777 --> 01:14:14,397
[SPEAKER_11]: And what exactly do you do at Konami?

1005
01:14:14,757 --> 01:14:14,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I...

1006
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to work for Konami.

1007
01:14:17,743 --> 01:14:18,404
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I do.

1008
01:14:18,984 --> 01:14:20,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you allowed to talk about what you do there?

1009
01:14:20,444 --> 01:14:20,764
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1010
01:14:20,844 --> 01:14:21,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no clue.

1011
01:14:21,764 --> 01:14:24,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And since I have no clue, I'm going to say I work for Konami.

1012
01:14:24,825 --> 01:14:25,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1013
01:14:25,185 --> 01:14:25,445
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1014
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:25,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

1015
01:14:25,845 --> 01:14:26,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

1016
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:26,605
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1017
01:14:27,065 --> 01:14:29,646
[SPEAKER_11]: But, well, you make a lot of money, right?

1018
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:30,566
[SPEAKER_11]: So you must be doing... No, I'm kidding.

1019
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:32,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I made a lot of money.

1020
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:33,387
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1021
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:33,767
[SPEAKER_09]: So fine.

1022
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:34,847
[SPEAKER_11]: We can talk about what you do.

1023
01:14:34,907 --> 01:14:39,328
[SPEAKER_11]: But you do have to come in contact with DDR Games at some point through your job.

1024
01:14:39,928 --> 01:14:41,689
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I have the Vivid membership.

1025
01:14:42,349 --> 01:14:43,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright, fine.

1026
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,530
[SPEAKER_11]: No, okay, let's talk about life before Konami then.

1027
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:45,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1028
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:46,651
[SPEAKER_11]: You were on the show before.

1029
01:14:46,671 --> 01:14:48,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we getting a backstory?

1030
01:14:48,211 --> 01:14:51,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you've been on the show before, but nobody was listening then.

1031
01:14:51,493 --> 01:14:52,513
[SPEAKER_11]: But now people care tonight.

1032
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:53,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody cared then.

1033
01:14:53,473 --> 01:14:56,214
[SPEAKER_11]: People seem to care tonight suddenly about this show for some reason.

1034
01:14:56,254 --> 01:14:58,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't, for the life of me, imagine why.

1035
01:14:58,095 --> 01:14:58,635
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why.

1036
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,576
[SPEAKER_11]: What exactly were you doing before Konami?

1037
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:04,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I worked for EV Games back in Kansas.

1038
01:15:04,798 --> 01:15:07,118
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, I'm from the Midwest, so...

1039
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:12,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I worked there, and then I came out here.

1040
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:15,283
[SPEAKER_09]: The end, I guess.

1041
01:15:15,443 --> 01:15:16,425
[SPEAKER_09]: What possessed you to come out here?

1042
01:15:17,467 --> 01:15:19,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I had been wanting to move out here for a while.

1043
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:22,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'm originally way long time ago from here, but...

1044
01:15:23,959 --> 01:15:27,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I moved to Kansas, then I decided, hey, Kansas kind of sucks.

1045
01:15:27,762 --> 01:15:28,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it really does.

1046
01:15:30,145 --> 01:15:31,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So I moved out here.

1047
01:15:32,307 --> 01:15:33,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, fair enough.

1048
01:15:33,628 --> 01:15:38,272
[SPEAKER_11]: And how, now, I don't know how much you can or can't say about this, but how did you get the job at Konami?

1049
01:15:38,552 --> 01:15:41,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Because a lot of people want to know this, like, oh, I want to work in video games, I want to play video games all day.

1050
01:15:42,396 --> 01:15:47,340
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you, and I'm sure that's exactly how you would describe some of the jobs there, right?

1051
01:15:48,221 --> 01:15:48,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sure, right.

1052
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:50,002
[SPEAKER_11]: How...

1053
01:15:50,683 --> 01:15:51,723
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much how it works.

1054
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:23,731
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so you went to a company, and you applied, and who knew it?

1055
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:24,312
[SPEAKER_11]: They hired you.

1056
01:16:24,352 --> 01:16:24,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1057
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:25,833
[SPEAKER_09]: What were they thinking?

1058
01:16:27,193 --> 01:16:28,514
[SPEAKER_11]: They obviously don't know me.

1059
01:16:28,934 --> 01:16:34,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, since you do come in contact with some DDR games, you guys like to have a little fun on some of the big message boards.

1060
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:36,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, the biggest one that comes to mind, the Freak, right?

1061
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:36,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1062
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,462
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've been posting lately in the thread, and what do you hope to gain from posting in this thread?

1063
01:16:42,523 --> 01:16:42,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1064
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,241
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope to gain just pretty much some laughter, because that's what I've been getting.

1065
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:55,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think what it's really doing is creating a lot of hype for the game.

1066
01:16:56,443 --> 01:17:09,666
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you had been on the DDR Freak boards, gosh, maybe before Friday, because that's when we all started coming into contact with the boards, it was really not a very happy place.

1067
01:17:09,786 --> 01:17:10,406
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

1068
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:12,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I think everybody's starting to realize, you know,

1069
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:16,992
[SPEAKER_09]: This is DDR, this is why we're here, and we're going to enjoy it.

1070
01:17:18,273 --> 01:17:22,574
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, people seem to be having fun again, instead of just complaining.

1071
01:17:24,155 --> 01:17:25,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I notice people are having fun with it.

1072
01:17:25,896 --> 01:17:26,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially all the photoshops.

1073
01:17:26,996 --> 01:17:28,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, the photoshops.

1074
01:17:31,797 --> 01:17:33,399
[SPEAKER_09]: You were just in the bathroom, I'm sorry.

1075
01:17:34,299 --> 01:17:34,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at this, look at this.

1076
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,023
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura kicks our guest from Konami out of the chair so she can sit down.

1077
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:39,523
[SPEAKER_11]: It's beautiful.

1078
01:17:40,084 --> 01:17:42,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1079
01:17:43,646 --> 01:17:45,288
[SPEAKER_11]: She's motioning for Sigurd to come sit on her lap.

1080
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you should go sit on her lap.

1081
01:17:46,589 --> 01:17:49,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I would, but you might punch me.

1082
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd's afraid of being punched by DarkSakura.

1083
01:17:52,533 --> 01:17:53,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, DarkSakura loves you.

1084
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:56,176
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, tell him you love him.

1085
01:17:58,037 --> 01:17:58,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a hole in the head.

1086
01:18:00,951 --> 01:18:01,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I love you!

1087
01:18:01,351 --> 01:18:02,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I want fanboys!

1088
01:18:02,152 --> 01:18:04,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want fangirls, I want fanboys!

1089
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:23,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I see.

1090
01:18:23,285 --> 01:18:25,306
[SPEAKER_11]: So, come on, step it up.

1091
01:18:25,546 --> 01:18:27,107
[SPEAKER_09]: You and I have something in common, I see.

1092
01:18:27,607 --> 01:18:28,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1093
01:18:29,127 --> 01:18:32,248
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you've listened to this show for the past 105 episodes, you know what I'm talking about.

1094
01:18:32,549 --> 01:18:36,630
[SPEAKER_11]: But for those of you that are just listening tonight, I don't feel like telling it again.

1095
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,110
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you'll just have to be in the dark.

1096
01:18:38,611 --> 01:18:39,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, anyway.

1097
01:18:41,536 --> 01:18:43,698
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Freakboards, what were we talking about?

1098
01:18:43,818 --> 01:18:44,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, DDR Freakboards.

1099
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,242
[SPEAKER_11]: This thing, it happens every time there's a new mix, Konami puts out.

1100
01:18:48,422 --> 01:18:49,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time there's a new mix.

1101
01:18:49,864 --> 01:18:56,310
[SPEAKER_11]: The first mix, Konomics, all the way back there to DDR Max, Max 2, there's this thing called Hints.

1102
01:18:56,790 --> 01:19:02,636
[SPEAKER_11]: And we all know that a while back, Jason Enos, like back during comics days, used to come on the thread and drop hints about what was going on.

1103
01:19:02,676 --> 01:19:05,919
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, some other folks picked up the slack for some of the later games.

1104
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Death Tricks, Cryptic.

1105
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:08,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks you guys don't even know, right?

1106
01:19:08,662 --> 01:19:09,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1107
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,384
[SPEAKER_11]: You work there and you don't know who they are.

1108
01:19:10,404 --> 01:19:10,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

1109
01:19:10,904 --> 01:19:11,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

1110
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:17,129
[SPEAKER_11]: So, because if we knew who they were, they'd probably have a Vivid foot next to their name.

1111
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:26,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So now it comes to the point where you post as a Vivid member, not just any Vivid member, but one that works for Konami, you post anything and somebody assumes it's a hint.

1112
01:19:26,493 --> 01:19:26,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1113
01:19:26,913 --> 01:19:29,994
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to be a hint, you must be talking about a new song.

1114
01:19:30,054 --> 01:19:30,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

1115
01:19:30,615 --> 01:19:35,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that is what you want to do more than anything is spoil your NDA.

1116
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I really want to get fired.

1117
01:19:37,718 --> 01:19:40,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these people, I'm glad they're picking up on that.

1118
01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:47,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so, how many hints have you posted in the DDR Freak thread thus far?

1119
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:55,557
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Freak listeners, we, as a collective group, have posted exactly zero hints.

1120
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:56,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Zero hints!

1121
01:19:56,998 --> 01:19:59,400
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but, maybe that was a hint.

1122
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,741
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, seriously, no.

1123
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:06,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, zero one was in seventh style, he was the, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, you guys, zero one's in it.

1124
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:08,166
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, I mean...

1125
01:20:10,191 --> 01:20:12,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I posted this earlier on the thread, you know.

1126
01:20:12,732 --> 01:20:13,452
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was ignored.

1127
01:20:13,872 --> 01:20:14,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

1128
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:15,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.

1129
01:20:15,493 --> 01:20:16,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a flashy foot by my name.

1130
01:20:16,894 --> 01:20:17,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to me.

1131
01:20:17,574 --> 01:20:26,937
[SPEAKER_11]: So wait, but I seem to recall that one of the other folks over there posted a picture and it had like a party collection bucket and like a Max 2 thing.

1132
01:20:26,957 --> 01:20:29,118
[SPEAKER_11]: It had like extreme samplers there.

1133
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,720
[SPEAKER_11]: And, oh, would you hold up the extreme sampler for the camera?

1134
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you do that?

1135
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody else can, or I guess I can.

1136
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:37,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll have to see.

1137
01:20:37,843 --> 01:20:38,664
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do it during the break.

1138
01:20:38,684 --> 01:20:39,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll do it during the break.

1139
01:20:39,524 --> 01:20:40,185
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do it during the break.

1140
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:43,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's like way over by the camera, and I don't feel like going by the camera.

1141
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:44,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can hold that.

1142
01:20:44,508 --> 01:20:45,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hold that.

1143
01:20:45,088 --> 01:20:45,929
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the same size.

1144
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:46,629
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not it.

1145
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:47,330
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something else.

1146
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:48,451
[SPEAKER_09]: It's close enough.

1147
01:20:49,551 --> 01:20:49,832
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1148
01:20:50,752 --> 01:20:52,253
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, that picture.

1149
01:20:54,655 --> 01:20:56,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a porno you're holding up, or what?

1150
01:20:57,457 --> 01:20:58,478
[SPEAKER_11]: A Fahrenheit 911.

1151
01:20:59,358 --> 01:21:02,461
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that picture, you know, with the party collection bucket and all that?

1152
01:21:02,501 --> 01:21:02,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1153
01:21:03,432 --> 01:21:06,698
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a picture with the party collection book and whatever else.

1154
01:21:08,342 --> 01:21:10,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, it has nothing to do with anything.

1155
01:21:11,894 --> 01:21:12,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the V rare.

1156
01:21:13,115 --> 01:21:14,475
[SPEAKER_11]: So, wait a minute.

1157
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:23,940
[SPEAKER_11]: So that picture with the party collection and the tip jar and everything, that's basically just you guys showing off that you have a humongous internet penis right now and you're not afraid to whip it out.

1158
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:24,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

1159
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:24,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1160
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:25,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1161
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,401
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very family oriented.

1162
01:21:27,441 --> 01:21:28,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Just curious.

1163
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:30,162
[SPEAKER_11]: So the picture meant nothing.

1164
01:21:30,522 --> 01:21:31,983
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no hidden clues in that picture.

1165
01:21:32,863 --> 01:21:37,325
[SPEAKER_11]: As a friend, you're swearing to me there is no hidden meaning in that picture because we go way back.

1166
01:21:37,846 --> 01:21:38,586
[SPEAKER_11]: We go way back.

1167
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:40,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm holding it up right now.

1168
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:40,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you are holding it up?

1169
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:43,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it!

1170
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:45,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you're even fucking with me!

1171
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:45,860
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1172
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear that there were no hints.

1173
01:21:50,341 --> 01:21:54,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, granted, you guys can't see me, so I could be crossing my fingers or something.

1174
01:21:54,503 --> 01:21:54,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, stop.

1175
01:21:55,503 --> 01:22:00,124
[SPEAKER_09]: But, no, I said on the boards, you guys will figure out when we are actually giving hints.

1176
01:22:00,865 --> 01:22:03,586
[SPEAKER_09]: If I say we're not, we probably aren't.

1177
01:22:04,026 --> 01:22:04,766
[SPEAKER_09]: If I say we aren't,

1178
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,060
[SPEAKER_09]: We could be.

1179
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,301
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what keeps it fun.

1180
01:22:07,702 --> 01:22:10,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, but seriously, there's no hints.

1181
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:12,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, in that picture, there are no hints.

1182
01:22:13,148 --> 01:22:15,511
[SPEAKER_11]: When the hints start, you guys will know, right?

1183
01:22:15,551 --> 01:22:16,833
[SPEAKER_11]: When the hints start, you will know.

1184
01:22:16,993 --> 01:22:18,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And does that mean you're going to give us a hint tonight?

1185
01:22:19,276 --> 01:22:19,456
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1186
01:22:19,856 --> 01:22:20,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1187
01:22:20,537 --> 01:22:20,657
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1188
01:22:20,918 --> 01:22:21,058
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1189
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:22,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, guys.

1190
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,343
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that you guys are hoping to come on here and hope for a hint, but...

1191
01:22:25,663 --> 01:22:28,304
[SPEAKER_11]: because there are these things called the Dawn Disclosure Agreements.

1192
01:22:28,324 --> 01:22:31,125
[SPEAKER_11]: He can only say what he's allowed to say and we're not allowed to say anything else.

1193
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:32,026
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

1194
01:22:32,066 --> 01:22:34,047
[SPEAKER_11]: We got the song and that's enough for me right now.

1195
01:22:34,067 --> 01:22:34,987
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more than enough.

1196
01:22:35,347 --> 01:22:37,708
[SPEAKER_11]: So certainly we can't give out any more hints.

1197
01:22:39,269 --> 01:22:42,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly I couldn't give out anything else because I don't know what the hell else is in the game.

1198
01:22:45,072 --> 01:22:46,912
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently there's porn in this, Mitch.

1199
01:22:48,313 --> 01:22:48,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, was that a hint?

1200
01:22:49,053 --> 01:22:49,954
[SPEAKER_09]: That could have been a hint.

1201
01:22:49,974 --> 01:22:51,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it erotic?

1202
01:22:51,474 --> 01:22:52,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh!

1203
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:53,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Erotic's in it!

1204
01:22:53,755 --> 01:22:54,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh!

1205
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1206
01:23:17,165 --> 01:23:17,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1207
01:23:38,226 --> 01:23:39,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not know it was him.

1208
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:41,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I was reading through the thread, I'm like, who's that guy?

1209
01:23:41,448 --> 01:23:42,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't even realize it was him.

1210
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:44,811
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how secretive you've been being on there.

1211
01:23:44,871 --> 01:23:46,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even know it was you, but of course I was just being stupid.

1212
01:23:46,592 --> 01:23:48,753
[SPEAKER_09]: People who know me, there's two dead giveaways.

1213
01:23:48,994 --> 01:23:50,915
[SPEAKER_09]: One, I talked about my hair in the picture.

1214
01:23:51,255 --> 01:23:54,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I always talk about my hair, because I love it.

1215
01:23:54,678 --> 01:23:56,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, I said sadness.

1216
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:57,820
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another trademark of me.

1217
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, sadness, I should have known.

1218
01:23:59,341 --> 01:24:00,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have known.

1219
01:24:02,143 --> 01:24:02,403
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1220
01:24:04,924 --> 01:24:12,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, guys, I think what we're going to do now is I think we're going to take one quick break here, and then I think we're going to do a Mamani match game, maybe.

1221
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:13,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do the cage match now, actually.

1222
01:24:14,672 --> 01:24:16,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do that.

1223
01:24:17,914 --> 01:24:19,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's drag this out as long as possible here.

1224
01:24:20,616 --> 01:24:25,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to say to your adoring boys and possible fangirls out there, Sigurd?

1225
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:31,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Just keep reading, and we'll be posting stuff as we normally do, and love me, please.

1226
01:24:32,846 --> 01:24:33,106
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1227
01:24:33,564 --> 01:24:38,766
[SPEAKER_11]: So show Sigurd a little more love, and maybe he'll start dropping those hints later, if you'll show him some love.

1228
01:24:39,246 --> 01:24:44,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as soon as I queue it up here, we're going to get into the Orange Launch Radio cage match.

1229
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:52,710
[SPEAKER_11]: The cage match, for you guys that have never participated before, you need to be in our chat room, www.orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat.

1230
01:24:53,499 --> 01:24:56,721
[SPEAKER_13]: All three songs in their completeness because there's so many new people.

1231
01:24:57,142 --> 01:25:04,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually thinking, I think we ought to, since there's so many new people, I think we ought to make an exception tonight and play the entirety winner from last week.

1232
01:25:04,387 --> 01:25:05,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it is a really good song.

1233
01:25:05,788 --> 01:25:06,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, either way.

1234
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:06,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

1235
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

1236
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:08,751
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to do that.

1237
01:25:08,791 --> 01:25:10,292
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be special because it was Loki's winner.

1238
01:25:10,332 --> 01:25:16,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, the way the Cage Match works, we pick three songs, each host picks a song, and they're usually big dance hits or guitar hits or something.

1239
01:25:16,857 --> 01:25:22,161
[SPEAKER_11]: They're kind of songs that we think may make good Bomani selections, or we just think they're really cool and we want to play them for you guys.

1240
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:23,162
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys vote.

1241
01:25:23,182 --> 01:25:24,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we want to torture you sometimes.

1242
01:25:24,743 --> 01:25:26,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes we want to torture you, like when Jamie brings J-Lo.

1243
01:25:26,564 --> 01:25:27,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have picked Britney Spears this week.

1244
01:25:28,085 --> 01:25:29,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Britney.

1245
01:25:29,506 --> 01:25:36,691
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing is, you're going to pick your favorite of the three songs, and that winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1246
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:38,832
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's definitely a prize to be won here.

1247
01:25:39,193 --> 01:25:44,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, last week's winner is actually pretty cool because it's a remix done by our very own Loki.

1248
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:48,319
[SPEAKER_11]: And he remixed this song, you might know it from DDR, called Ecstasy.

1249
01:25:48,379 --> 01:25:49,960
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is an excellent remix.

1250
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,301
[SPEAKER_11]: It's won two weeks now.

1251
01:25:51,841 --> 01:25:54,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it wins for four, we're going to have to retire it, so it's halfway there.

1252
01:25:54,722 --> 01:25:56,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if it adds one more week on.

1253
01:25:57,323 --> 01:26:00,945
[SPEAKER_11]: But oh yeah, I've got to have the cage match music, huh?

1254
01:26:01,585 --> 01:26:13,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match... Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki won with his pick, it's Ecstasy.

1255
01:26:13,709 --> 01:26:15,290
[SPEAKER_11]: And what did you remix this with here?

1256
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:17,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Explain what a mash mix is real fast.

1257
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:23,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you're listening to most of the stuff that's out there, it's crap.

1258
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:33,468
[SPEAKER_13]: But, uh, you know, MashMix is just basically just, um, taking two songs, not necessarily going, um, you're basically cutting loops and, you know, remixing it that way with loops.

1259
01:26:33,568 --> 01:26:41,992
[SPEAKER_13]: But, the problem with a lot of people is it's gotten a really bad rap because, you know, people just throw one song on top of it and another, you know, basically mixing it in gold wave.

1260
01:26:42,832 --> 01:26:44,053
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like utter crap.

1261
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:48,435
[SPEAKER_13]: So, hopefully, you know, this stuff's a little bit better than crap.

1262
01:26:50,492 --> 01:26:51,778
[SPEAKER_11]: This song should be in DDR.

1263
01:26:51,919 --> 01:26:52,461
[SPEAKER_11]: End of story.

1264
01:26:52,562 --> 01:26:54,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I seriously think this song should be in DDR.

1265
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Eh, it's okay.

1266
01:26:58,312 --> 01:27:04,397
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyways, yeah, this is remixed with the actual trance artists that got me into the whole genre in the first place.

1267
01:27:05,117 --> 01:27:24,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Tomski, with his song 14 Hours to Save the Earth, one of the only two songs he's ever done, the other one being Love Will Come, and he was pretty popular back in the end of the 90s, beginning 2000s, and he just kind of doesn't really make anything anymore, just some remixes, but you'll basically see him a lot with the Disco Citizens and...

1268
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:30,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Decane, and also you see stuff with Dan Johnson and stuff like that.

1269
01:27:30,157 --> 01:27:32,338
[SPEAKER_13]: He kind of hangs around with that clique.

1270
01:27:33,399 --> 01:27:34,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here it is.

1271
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Less talking, more playing.

1272
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:35,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

1273
01:27:35,741 --> 01:27:38,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Atomski vs. D-Complex with Ecstasy.

1274
01:27:38,483 --> 01:27:39,844
[SPEAKER_11]: 14 hours, club mix.

1275
01:27:39,984 --> 01:27:40,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

1276
01:30:42,691 --> 01:31:01,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match, Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix, and I think it's hilarious, because the people who can't hear the show right now are just in our chat room, and they can only see what we're posting, and I posted, you know, as I always do every week when we play the Cage Match songs, I posted, song one, Ecstasy, 14 Hours Club Mix, and somebody's like, oh my god, they're announcing the song list!

1277
01:31:03,507 --> 01:31:04,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome, awesome.

1278
01:31:05,468 --> 01:31:08,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, no, that is not a song that's going to be extreme.

1279
01:31:08,068 --> 01:31:10,429
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a fan song, and it's song number one you can vote for tonight.

1280
01:31:10,729 --> 01:31:15,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is brought to us by DarkSakura.

1281
01:31:15,151 --> 01:31:15,871
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you pick tonight?

1282
01:31:16,311 --> 01:31:18,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked something by someone.

1283
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:22,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember what you picked, or do you need a reminder?

1284
01:31:24,314 --> 01:31:25,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I picked.

1285
01:31:25,534 --> 01:31:26,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, it was low.

1286
01:31:27,034 --> 01:31:28,535
[SPEAKER_02]: With the moves.

1287
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,841
[SPEAKER_02]: with, oh yeah, Astro Sexy.

1288
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:32,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1289
01:31:33,782 --> 01:31:33,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Enflo.

1290
01:31:34,023 --> 01:31:34,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Enflo is awesome.

1291
01:31:34,943 --> 01:31:35,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Enflo is in DDR.

1292
01:31:36,304 --> 01:31:37,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Enflo is in DDR.

1293
01:31:37,905 --> 01:31:38,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1294
01:31:39,306 --> 01:31:42,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Enflo with Astro Sexy, song number two in tonight's page match.

1295
01:31:42,769 --> 01:31:45,391
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you like this, you can vote for it after we're all done here.

1296
01:31:45,411 --> 01:31:45,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

1297
01:31:47,052 --> 01:31:56,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Astro Nomikaru Expo, Expo, Enflo Zenkai Soshite Nexto Astro Nomikaru Expo, Expo, Expo, Expo Let's bring it back, back Astro Nomikaru Expo

1298
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:22,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start this story somewhere, with everything we haven't talked about, as it is, the two of us.

1299
01:32:22,192 --> 01:32:26,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start this story somewhere, with everything we haven't talked about, as it is, the two of us.

1300
01:32:26,714 --> 01:32:27,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start this science talk.

1301
01:32:48,766 --> 01:32:49,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1302
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:21,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1303
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:19,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And Flow Chemistry Yo, you know what I'm saying?

1304
01:35:19,194 --> 01:35:20,115
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the global F

1305
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:16,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1306
01:37:26,598 --> 01:37:29,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Mflow with Astro Sexy.

1307
01:37:29,959 --> 01:37:32,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're going to go around and see what everybody thought of that.

1308
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Take out the inner Simon Cowell in us.

1309
01:37:34,301 --> 01:37:34,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie.

1310
01:37:35,201 --> 01:37:35,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Mflow.

1311
01:37:36,362 --> 01:37:41,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the whole, I have to say that the whole CD altogether isn't all that great, but it has some awesome tracks on it.

1312
01:37:41,604 --> 01:37:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one, it just, it keeps getting interesting, it keeps changing it up as the song goes on.

1313
01:37:46,106 --> 01:37:48,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real progression through the whole song.

1314
01:37:48,567 --> 01:37:49,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really love it.

1315
01:37:49,407 --> 01:37:50,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd have to say that one gets a 10.

1316
01:37:51,188 --> 01:37:54,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Taku yet, but you know, it still gets a 10.

1317
01:37:56,591 --> 01:37:56,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Angel.

1318
01:38:00,212 --> 01:38:08,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, to me it sounds like Daft Punk kind of dancey so I really liked it.

1319
01:38:08,657 --> 01:38:09,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say 9.8.

1320
01:38:13,772 --> 01:38:18,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I'm going to do that, but I guess it's because I can.

1321
01:38:18,535 --> 01:38:24,260
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I'm sorry, Jamie, but it just stole a whole bunch from me.

1322
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:25,501
[SPEAKER_23]: It was okay.

1323
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:26,661
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a good song.

1324
01:38:26,761 --> 01:38:28,283
[SPEAKER_23]: I just like the style.

1325
01:38:28,923 --> 01:38:31,245
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I don't even know if it's my style.

1326
01:38:31,285 --> 01:38:32,806
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm slow, actually, but...

1327
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:36,029
[SPEAKER_23]: As far as the progression, I liked that.

1328
01:38:36,069 --> 01:38:37,289
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought it was interesting.

1329
01:38:37,309 --> 01:38:38,570
[SPEAKER_23]: I was like, what's going on here?

1330
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:41,571
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I could tell something was changing in the song.

1331
01:38:41,991 --> 01:38:45,632
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's definitely got that, what do you say, dark punkishness.

1332
01:38:46,332 --> 01:38:49,153
[SPEAKER_23]: I was thinking of Move Your Feet that those guys do.

1333
01:38:49,613 --> 01:38:50,333
[SPEAKER_23]: So, yeah.

1334
01:38:50,393 --> 01:38:51,034
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1335
01:38:51,514 --> 01:38:53,854
[SPEAKER_23]: You're a senior.

1336
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:56,275
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'd have to give it maybe a 7.

1337
01:38:56,435 --> 01:38:58,816
[SPEAKER_23]: A good song, but not my style.

1338
01:38:59,056 --> 01:38:59,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1339
01:38:59,336 --> 01:39:00,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Good song, not your style.

1340
01:39:00,377 --> 01:39:00,357
7.

1341
01:39:00,577 --> 01:39:01,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd, what did you think?

1342
01:39:04,636 --> 01:39:05,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Cagematch?

1343
01:39:05,516 --> 01:39:06,137
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're doing?

1344
01:39:06,697 --> 01:39:08,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, were you even listening to Emplo?

1345
01:39:08,518 --> 01:39:10,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because I remember commenting on it.

1346
01:39:10,378 --> 01:39:10,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1347
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:13,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard that song.

1348
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:13,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like it.

1349
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:14,480
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets a 9.

1350
01:39:15,221 --> 01:39:15,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1351
01:39:15,921 --> 01:39:16,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be in DDR?

1352
01:39:19,082 --> 01:39:19,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

1353
01:39:20,003 --> 01:39:20,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Loki.

1354
01:39:22,944 --> 01:39:23,644
[SPEAKER_11]: That was awesome.

1355
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:24,284
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved it. 10.

1356
01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:27,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, it wasn't that bad.

1357
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually I'm kind of am with them flow, but that was fun.

1358
01:39:30,071 --> 01:39:30,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I give it an eight.

1359
01:39:30,771 --> 01:39:31,311
[SPEAKER_11]: I give it an eight.

1360
01:39:31,431 --> 01:39:32,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun songs get eight.

1361
01:39:32,471 --> 01:39:32,791
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1362
01:39:33,411 --> 01:39:35,392
[SPEAKER_23]: Our other voter is in the show.

1363
01:39:35,672 --> 01:39:35,952
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

1364
01:39:35,972 --> 01:39:36,432
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1365
01:39:36,552 --> 01:39:38,052
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not the ones who get to pick the winner.

1366
01:39:38,072 --> 01:39:46,174
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys do out there in listener land, and I'm sure you have nothing better to do while waiting for your reign, which we will get to in like 15 minutes.

1367
01:39:46,354 --> 01:39:48,614
[SPEAKER_02]: We will make sure that you vote.

1368
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:50,795
[SPEAKER_02]: The more votes, the faster we'll get there.

1369
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:52,555
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we'll get it.

1370
01:39:52,595 --> 01:39:53,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, one more song.

1371
01:39:53,396 --> 01:39:54,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to the last song then.

1372
01:39:55,516 --> 01:39:59,757
[SPEAKER_11]: My song, my pick this week is a group you also know from DDR, Four Strings.

1373
01:40:00,618 --> 01:40:03,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And they have a brand new single and it's called Turn It Around.

1374
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:05,899
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's going to be my pick for tonight.

1375
01:40:06,119 --> 01:40:06,559
[SPEAKER_11]: So enjoy.

1376
01:40:06,579 --> 01:40:08,120
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Four Strings with Turn It Around.

1377
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:13,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn it around baby Spend my time with me

1378
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:35,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn it around baby Spend my time with me It's getting insane I know Let it not be true Turn it around baby

1379
01:41:21,761 --> 01:41:22,202
Thanks for watching!

1380
01:42:56,938 --> 01:42:57,559
Turn it around

1381
01:43:49,032 --> 01:43:52,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, welcome back, that was Four Strings with Turn It Around, the last song in tonight's Cage Match.

1382
01:43:53,056 --> 01:43:54,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Janie, what'd you think of that?

1383
01:43:55,818 --> 01:43:59,841
[SPEAKER_21]: It was... It was good.

1384
01:44:01,563 --> 01:44:10,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it's trancy, you know, and I'm sort of, kind of, I mean, even though I went and downloaded this whole trance compilation, I'm just sort of tranced out a bit.

1385
01:44:10,931 --> 01:44:17,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been listening to a lot of trance lately because of when I'm writing my stories, it's easier to listen to trance while I'm writing.

1386
01:44:17,665 --> 01:44:18,426
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very good, though.

1387
01:44:18,466 --> 01:44:19,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I love four strings.

1388
01:44:19,366 --> 01:44:20,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to give it about an eight and a half.

1389
01:44:20,887 --> 01:44:21,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1390
01:44:22,868 --> 01:44:24,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew, what did you think of that one?

1391
01:44:24,209 --> 01:44:24,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Pirate.

1392
01:44:24,989 --> 01:44:25,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Our local pirate.

1393
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:27,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, he didn't vote in the last... Oh, he's gone.

1394
01:44:27,751 --> 01:44:28,131
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright.

1395
01:44:28,412 --> 01:44:31,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I've been in the bathroom for the past three songs.

1396
01:44:31,814 --> 01:44:32,094
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright.

1397
01:44:32,114 --> 01:44:33,294
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no idea what's going on.

1398
01:44:34,155 --> 01:44:34,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's fine.

1399
01:44:35,596 --> 01:44:35,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Angel.

1400
01:44:37,997 --> 01:44:38,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stuck.

1401
01:44:38,578 --> 01:44:39,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, hi.

1402
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:42,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez, I'd probably say...

1403
01:44:43,169 --> 01:44:53,673
[SPEAKER_03]: and Ace, because, I don't know, I like the tranciness, I could probably, I don't know, go into the club, and I have no idea where I'm going with this, never mind!

1404
01:44:53,973 --> 01:44:54,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, on 110?

1405
01:44:55,474 --> 01:44:56,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry, I missed that.

1406
01:44:56,434 --> 01:44:57,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Holly, it's either you or Holly.

1407
01:44:57,615 --> 01:45:12,801
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, um, I like it a lot, I'm into trance, um, uplifting trance is, uh, kind of a newer, happier kind of thing that's going on, um, so for uplifting, I guess, I think it's categorized as that anyway, it's pretty good.

1408
01:45:13,317 --> 01:45:13,637
[SPEAKER_23]: I give it a 9.

1409
01:45:13,897 --> 01:45:20,460
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm into Darker Trance, but it's good.

1410
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:22,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard that song earlier today.

1411
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:24,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't like it, I'm sorry.

1412
01:45:24,241 --> 01:45:29,263
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not as good as Diving, which might be on Xtreme, except it's already been announced.

1413
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is on Xtreme, Sigurd.

1414
01:45:30,723 --> 01:45:33,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Even I do that, and I don't work for them.

1415
01:45:34,445 --> 01:45:34,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it a 4.

1416
01:45:36,425 --> 01:45:36,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw, you suck.

1417
01:45:36,945 --> 01:45:37,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's fine.

1418
01:45:37,466 --> 01:45:37,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1419
01:45:39,167 --> 01:45:39,567
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1420
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,849
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty good, but not as good as that trance remix that's on DDR Extreme.

1421
01:45:43,989 --> 01:45:44,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh!

1422
01:45:44,429 --> 01:45:44,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh!

1423
01:45:44,890 --> 01:45:45,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh!

1424
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:47,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Of another song.

1425
01:45:47,891 --> 01:45:48,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Another song!

1426
01:45:48,852 --> 01:45:51,113
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be a trance remix of another song!

1427
01:45:52,674 --> 01:45:53,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, oh, where were we?

1428
01:45:54,214 --> 01:45:56,836
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna give that a, um...

1429
01:45:58,519 --> 01:45:59,239
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I can't do that.

1430
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,420
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be too obvious.

1431
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to give that a 7.

1432
01:46:01,281 --> 01:46:03,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm right here.

1433
01:46:04,843 --> 01:46:05,183
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1434
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:09,626
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really a great song, even though it is a little bit repetitive.

1435
01:46:09,726 --> 01:46:10,406
[SPEAKER_11]: But I love it.

1436
01:46:10,426 --> 01:46:10,406
9.

1437
01:46:10,807 --> 01:46:11,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a 9 in... Oh, a 9.5?

1438
01:46:13,268 --> 01:46:15,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a 9 in the German sense? 9!

1439
01:46:20,276 --> 01:46:22,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's recap and then you guys can vote.

1440
01:46:22,458 --> 01:46:23,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

1441
01:46:23,318 --> 01:46:25,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And remember, you can only vote through private message.

1442
01:46:26,181 --> 01:46:29,063
[SPEAKER_11]: If you post something public in the chatroom, it is not counted.

1443
01:46:29,103 --> 01:46:30,564
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to send a private message to Sky.

1444
01:46:30,604 --> 01:46:33,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Do not flood the chatroom with your vote or I will come over there and punch you.

1445
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:34,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1446
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:36,028
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1447
01:46:36,068 --> 01:46:38,570
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to get the paddle and spank.

1448
01:46:39,551 --> 01:46:40,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here we go.

1449
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:43,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number one, Ecstasy, 14 Hours Club Mix.

1450
01:46:49,944 --> 01:46:58,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, song number two tonight is M-Flow with Astro Sexy Song number three in tonight's cage match is Four Strings with Turn It Around

1451
01:47:14,809 --> 01:47:16,451
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, there you go.

1452
01:47:17,752 --> 01:47:23,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Send your vote over private message to Sky, and I'm going to type in the chat room how to do that real fast here.

1453
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:29,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you okay there, Jamie?

1454
01:47:29,882 --> 01:47:32,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you need to regulate something in the chat room?

1455
01:47:33,325 --> 01:47:38,050
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just make sure all of you in the chat room do not try to send anything to Bimonicade.

1456
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:40,271
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the name that we're all using.

1457
01:47:40,331 --> 01:47:41,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our personal slut name.

1458
01:47:42,597 --> 01:47:43,798
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been humping it all night.

1459
01:47:44,038 --> 01:47:46,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Secret's been on there, but it's actually our machine.

1460
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:46,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on it too.

1461
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:48,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, you were on there too, DarkSakura.

1462
01:47:48,081 --> 01:47:50,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on there too, and Andrew was on there for a little bit.

1463
01:47:51,144 --> 01:47:53,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't send anything to BinMoneyCade.

1464
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:54,607
[SPEAKER_02]: No DCC chat, no nothing.

1465
01:47:54,687 --> 01:47:57,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Please don't initiate DCC chats, because that's not the way we can do the votes.

1466
01:47:58,330 --> 01:48:00,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Just double-click to open up a window, and it'll work that way.

1467
01:48:00,692 --> 01:48:02,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send the message to Sky.

1468
01:48:02,693 --> 01:48:04,915
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking to my arcade cabinet, okay?

1469
01:48:05,075 --> 01:48:08,518
[SPEAKER_13]: It will not respond back or accept any files.

1470
01:48:09,278 --> 01:48:11,160
[SPEAKER_13]: It's merely there for arcade enjoyment.

1471
01:48:14,829 --> 01:48:16,551
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually going to open up the Skype line.

1472
01:48:16,591 --> 01:48:19,874
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very close to playing your reign.

1473
01:48:19,894 --> 01:48:23,758
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I just want to get it done and over with so that, you know, folks will stop bugging me about it.

1474
01:48:24,458 --> 01:48:27,281
[SPEAKER_22]: But I do want to open up... Huh?

1475
01:48:27,942 --> 01:48:30,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I want to get some opinions on DDR Extreme thus far.

1476
01:48:30,664 --> 01:48:31,225
[SPEAKER_11]: So Skype...

1477
01:48:31,565 --> 01:48:32,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:54,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

1479
01:48:55,999 --> 01:48:56,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear us?

1480
01:48:57,219 --> 01:48:58,060
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, Skye's up.

1481
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I can.

1482
01:49:00,161 --> 01:49:01,261
[SPEAKER_11]: You're dropping out, dude.

1483
01:49:02,081 --> 01:49:03,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have porno torrents going?

1484
01:49:03,342 --> 01:49:03,962
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta close them.

1485
01:49:04,963 --> 01:49:05,183
[SPEAKER_20]: Nope.

1486
01:49:05,563 --> 01:49:06,443
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't have any going.

1487
01:49:06,803 --> 01:49:07,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1488
01:49:07,524 --> 01:49:08,984
[SPEAKER_11]: You're very spotty right now, though.

1489
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:11,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure, uh... You okay?

1490
01:49:12,966 --> 01:49:13,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me fine?

1491
01:49:15,247 --> 01:49:15,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw, we lost him.

1492
01:49:16,688 --> 01:49:17,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw, we lost him.

1493
01:49:18,288 --> 01:49:18,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw.

1494
01:49:18,448 --> 01:49:19,049
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a bummer.

1495
01:49:19,449 --> 01:49:20,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I'll try it one more time.

1496
01:49:20,809 --> 01:49:21,910
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see if we can get somebody in here.

1497
01:49:21,970 --> 01:49:22,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw.

1498
01:49:23,271 --> 01:49:26,332
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what happens when you get the... Oh, we'll try one more time.

1499
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:26,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Same person.

1500
01:49:26,833 --> 01:49:27,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Zone Radio.

1501
01:49:27,753 --> 01:49:27,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1502
01:49:28,373 --> 01:49:28,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?

1503
01:49:29,074 --> 01:49:29,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we can hear you now.

1504
01:49:30,434 --> 01:49:30,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

1505
01:49:31,575 --> 01:49:33,736
[SPEAKER_20]: I think because I had AIM on, I was dropping out.

1506
01:49:33,776 --> 01:49:34,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Who is this?

1507
01:49:34,136 --> 01:49:34,516
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1508
01:49:34,556 --> 01:49:35,137
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Richie.

1509
01:49:35,617 --> 01:49:36,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Richie.

1510
01:49:36,597 --> 01:49:37,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Richie.

1511
01:49:37,318 --> 01:49:37,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1512
01:49:37,398 --> 01:49:37,938
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

1513
01:49:37,978 --> 01:49:38,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, people.

1514
01:49:39,259 --> 01:49:42,160
[SPEAKER_20]: Just want to give out a few P's about Xtreme.

1515
01:49:44,001 --> 01:49:46,522
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm pretty excited for it to come out here to the U.S.

1516
01:49:46,702 --> 01:49:52,045
[SPEAKER_20]: Just going to check out the whole new itoy support, whatever they're going to have for it.

1517
01:49:52,403 --> 01:50:11,888
[SPEAKER_20]: but the main thing I'm mainly excited about is they're bringing Love Love Sugar to the US, so I heard about Love Love Sugar yes, I know, now the greatness of Noria shall be spread throughout this country there you go yes, okay, I'm not ashamed to admit it, I am a Noria fanboy right I want her to have my children

1518
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:21,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie, do you have anything you want to say to us for withholding on this Your Rain thing for like two hours now for some people?

1519
01:50:21,826 --> 01:50:22,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we jerks?

1520
01:50:23,247 --> 01:50:24,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this what you'd expect from us?

1521
01:50:25,268 --> 01:50:27,809
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I mean, just be patient, you know?

1522
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:32,172
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, just because we're going to play a new song doesn't mean we're going to play it right at the beginning of the show.

1523
01:50:33,273 --> 01:50:38,516
[SPEAKER_20]: And for the people who keep asking us to drop hints about what song is going to be on Xtreme or what new songs, you know,

1524
01:50:40,324 --> 01:50:41,865
[SPEAKER_20]: They can't say anything.

1525
01:50:41,905 --> 01:50:43,205
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the same thing.

1526
01:50:43,265 --> 01:50:43,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Disclosure.

1527
01:50:44,665 --> 01:50:45,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Disclosure thing that they have.

1528
01:50:46,146 --> 01:50:50,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically you're saying, you know what, there's a reason you're not getting hints yet.

1529
01:50:50,567 --> 01:50:52,087
[SPEAKER_11]: There's rules.

1530
01:50:52,548 --> 01:50:52,988
[SPEAKER_11]: The man.

1531
01:50:53,088 --> 01:50:53,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the man.

1532
01:50:54,028 --> 01:50:54,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Blame it on the man.

1533
01:50:55,268 --> 01:50:55,488
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

1534
01:50:55,548 --> 01:50:58,969
[SPEAKER_20]: All I have to say is they'll tell you when they can tell you.

1535
01:50:59,169 --> 01:51:00,210
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, just wait up.

1536
01:51:00,230 --> 01:51:00,730
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be good.

1537
01:51:01,090 --> 01:51:02,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Good things come to people who wait.

1538
01:51:03,851 --> 01:51:04,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1539
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:05,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well thanks for calling.

1540
01:51:05,871 --> 01:51:06,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, have a good one.

1541
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:07,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1542
01:51:08,472 --> 01:51:08,972
[SPEAKER_11]: That was fun.

1543
01:51:09,386 --> 01:51:10,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad to hear from him.

1544
01:51:11,206 --> 01:51:11,526
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

1545
01:51:11,626 --> 01:51:13,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give the other folks a chance to call just a minute here.

1546
01:51:17,687 --> 01:51:24,369
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, we're going to do that debut of your reign, and then we'll go to Bomani Match Game.

1547
01:51:25,169 --> 01:51:27,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we haven't done that in a while, so I want to get to that.

1548
01:51:27,409 --> 01:51:29,469
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we're going to go to the FUs of the week.

1549
01:51:29,490 --> 01:51:31,210
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have to kind of make it fast this week, though.

1550
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:34,390
[SPEAKER_11]: We may have to limit our chatroom FUs, especially with so many people listening.

1551
01:51:34,410 --> 01:51:37,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to guard our angst for you.

1552
01:51:37,591 --> 01:51:37,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1553
01:51:38,612 --> 01:51:45,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, if you guys have friends that are trying to get in and listen to the show and they can't get in right now, we will play the song again after the show at 9.40.

1554
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:48,402
[SPEAKER_11]: And there might be other surprises, too, at that time.

1555
01:51:48,442 --> 01:51:52,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So stay tuned, and we'll get that for you after the show.

1556
01:51:52,887 --> 01:51:57,152
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone listening in the chat room, please make an announcement for us that we will be playing the song again after the show.

1557
01:51:57,392 --> 01:52:01,293
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, yes, we'll play it again at 940 so those that weren't able to get in now can get in.

1558
01:52:01,353 --> 01:52:06,113
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, nobody else is calling on Skype line, so I think maybe it's about time for us to get to it.

1559
01:52:07,154 --> 01:52:08,094
[SPEAKER_02]: You've waited long enough.

1560
01:52:08,154 --> 01:52:09,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you guys have waited long enough.

1561
01:52:10,094 --> 01:52:18,056
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, I want to just give some shout-outs about this because I do definitely want to thank the folks at DDRSpot.com.

1562
01:52:18,636 --> 01:52:22,436
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't said their name enough tonight, but they have helped us out in getting this premiere for you guys.

1563
01:52:22,456 --> 01:52:24,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much to the staff at DDRSpot.com.

1564
01:52:25,017 --> 01:52:26,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, the KDEA team.

1565
01:52:26,997 --> 01:52:27,938
[SPEAKER_11]: has been very helpful.

1566
01:52:28,498 --> 01:52:29,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of our folks at Konami.

1567
01:52:29,939 --> 01:52:34,763
[SPEAKER_11]: So Sigurd, give them big kisses and hugs for us here at Orange Lounge for getting this for us.

1568
01:52:35,879 --> 01:52:36,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1569
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:38,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1570
01:52:38,641 --> 01:52:43,946
[SPEAKER_11]: And just thanks a lot to you guys because, you know, it helped us get a lot of exposure.

1571
01:52:43,986 --> 01:52:46,568
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been doing this radio show for about two years now.

1572
01:52:47,048 --> 01:52:50,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And some folks are just finding out about us tonight, even though we've been doing it for two years.

1573
01:52:50,491 --> 01:52:51,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?

1574
01:52:51,131 --> 01:52:53,994
[SPEAKER_11]: It may not be your cup of tea, but hey, thanks for checking us out.

1575
01:52:54,034 --> 01:52:56,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you did like us, we do the same shit every week.

1576
01:52:57,476 --> 01:52:58,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Every Sunday we do our talk.

1577
01:52:58,998 --> 01:53:01,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Some weeks we don't have a song to be teasing, so it's even crazier.

1578
01:53:02,591 --> 01:53:05,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank God you weren't here for the show where I sang.

1579
01:53:05,215 --> 01:53:05,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1580
01:53:05,956 --> 01:53:06,998
[SPEAKER_13]: That was bad enough.

1581
01:53:07,539 --> 01:53:08,220
[SPEAKER_02]: You're staying in?

1582
01:53:08,581 --> 01:53:11,425
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have Karaoke Revolution 2 we've still got to cover at some point.

1583
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:13,011
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, all right.

1584
01:53:13,131 --> 01:53:17,475
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, also keep in mind we've got our remix show on Monday, Diversion.

1585
01:53:18,055 --> 01:53:18,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm, definitely.

1586
01:53:18,776 --> 01:53:22,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Which Rob is gracious and has fun with.

1587
01:53:22,439 --> 01:53:22,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1588
01:53:22,939 --> 01:53:29,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my show is on Tuesday where if you're hanging out in our chat room, then whatever you request, Bimani or not, if I have it, I'll play it.

1589
01:53:29,965 --> 01:53:32,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can even send it to me if you really want to hear it broadcast on the show.

1590
01:53:33,008 --> 01:53:33,328
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1591
01:53:33,448 --> 01:53:34,830
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I don't think it's a piece of crap.

1592
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:35,630
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1593
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:37,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm flexible.

1594
01:53:37,771 --> 01:53:38,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't suck.

1595
01:53:38,331 --> 01:53:38,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play it.

1596
01:53:38,651 --> 01:53:39,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you'll play your reign again.

1597
01:53:40,392 --> 01:53:40,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1598
01:53:40,752 --> 01:53:41,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we can work that out.

1599
01:53:42,013 --> 01:53:42,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe.

1600
01:53:42,793 --> 01:53:49,155
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Wednesday, coming back very soon, Vanilla Sky, my show where we talk about random video game stuff.

1601
01:53:49,215 --> 01:53:50,556
[SPEAKER_11]: We just have to retool it a little bit.

1602
01:53:51,256 --> 01:53:52,096
[SPEAKER_11]: But hopefully soon.

1603
01:53:52,196 --> 01:53:53,517
[SPEAKER_11]: I might do something this week.

1604
01:53:53,557 --> 01:53:53,937
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

1605
01:53:54,117 --> 01:53:54,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1606
01:53:55,618 --> 01:54:01,080
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe sometime in the future, I'll do my show.

01:54:46,408 --> 01:54:46,688
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1619
01:54:46,869 --> 01:54:47,089
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1620
01:54:47,329 --> 01:54:48,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob?

1621
01:54:48,569 --> 01:54:48,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob?

1622
01:54:49,009 --> 01:54:49,210
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1623
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:50,130
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1624
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:50,490
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1625
01:54:51,691 --> 01:54:51,971
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1626
01:54:52,031 --> 01:54:52,251
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1627
01:54:52,411 --> 01:54:56,112
[SPEAKER_10]: We are forgetting the... Oh, Jesus.

1628
01:54:56,132 --> 01:54:56,873
[SPEAKER_10]: That was scary.

1629
01:54:56,893 --> 01:54:58,213
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in unison.

1630
01:54:58,253 --> 01:54:59,134
[SPEAKER_11]: They're getting restless.

1631
01:54:59,154 --> 01:55:00,114
[SPEAKER_11]: They're about to punch us.

1632
01:55:00,414 --> 01:55:02,035
[SPEAKER_11]: They're about to punch us in the face.

1633
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:07,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright, here we go.

1634
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Forget it, forget it, alright.

1635
01:55:11,062 --> 01:55:11,882
[SPEAKER_21]: I love you.

1636
01:55:11,902 --> 01:55:12,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you guys ready?

1637
01:55:14,264 --> 01:55:14,764
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm ready.

1638
01:55:14,864 --> 01:55:15,445
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready to hear this?

1639
01:55:16,445 --> 01:55:16,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1640
01:55:18,747 --> 01:55:23,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we are going to do right now the world debut of Your Rain, The Rage Mix.

1641
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:24,411
[SPEAKER_11]: So enjoy everybody.

1642
01:55:26,993 --> 01:55:34,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Your Rain, The Rage Mix, made possible by www.orangeloungeradio.com and www.ddrspot.com.

1643
01:55:34,218 --> 01:55:34,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

1644
01:55:40,575 --> 01:55:42,493
Thanks for watching!

1645
01:56:39,782 --> 01:56:40,683
Thanks for watching!

1646
01:56:58,649 --> 01:56:59,789
[SPEAKER_11]: That was sexy!

1647
01:57:00,009 --> 01:57:04,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe people have been waiting like two and a half hours for that one minute song.

1648
01:57:05,191 --> 01:57:05,912
[SPEAKER_11]: But there it is.

1649
01:57:06,152 --> 01:57:09,093
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually a minute twenty-nine is what that song clocks in as.

1650
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:10,493
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you guys think, DarkSakura?

1651
01:57:10,673 --> 01:57:11,413
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sexy.

1652
01:57:11,473 --> 01:57:12,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like the original better.

1653
01:57:12,454 --> 01:57:13,154
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was sexy.

1654
01:57:14,554 --> 01:57:15,195
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hot.

1655
01:57:16,275 --> 01:57:17,095
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very hot.

1656
01:57:17,275 --> 01:57:17,936
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hot.

1657
01:57:18,056 --> 01:57:19,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, slow.

1658
01:57:20,877 --> 01:57:22,517
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my favorite Akira song, hands down.

1659
01:57:22,537 --> 01:57:24,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my favorite Yamaoka song, hands down.

1660
01:57:26,359 --> 01:57:26,619
Cool.

1661
01:57:26,859 --> 01:57:27,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I agree.

1662
01:57:28,947 --> 01:57:29,488
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you guys think?

1663
01:57:29,608 --> 01:57:35,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew, you haven't really been, I don't know how much you've been following this fandom or how big a DDR fanboy you are, but what did you think of that?

1664
01:57:36,172 --> 01:57:37,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I like that song.

1665
01:57:37,553 --> 01:57:39,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's going to be pretty interesting to play.

1666
01:57:39,514 --> 01:57:44,778
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds slow as hell, so I'm definitely going to have to bar-rape that at like 5x or something when I play that.

1667
01:57:44,958 --> 01:57:47,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Or excuse me, chair-rape that at home, I guess.

1668
01:57:49,601 --> 01:57:51,982
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, that sounds pretty good.

1669
01:57:52,002 --> 01:57:52,483
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

1670
01:57:52,523 --> 01:57:53,903
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds interesting.

1671
01:57:55,585 --> 01:57:56,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Angel.

1672
01:57:56,570 --> 01:58:01,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like he just said, I'm totally going to have to speed mod that because I really suck at slow songs.

1673
01:58:03,994 --> 01:58:05,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I speed mod.

1674
01:58:05,454 --> 01:58:07,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that makes me a loser or not, though.

1675
01:58:08,476 --> 01:58:11,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I call myself DDR Angel, maybe I shouldn't speed mod anymore.

1676
01:58:13,378 --> 01:58:14,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm not funny.

1677
01:58:15,399 --> 01:58:17,700
[SPEAKER_23]: DDRholic.

1678
01:58:17,881 --> 01:58:21,342
[SPEAKER_23]: I can see Wendell freestyling to this right now.

1679
01:58:21,762 --> 01:58:23,543
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very freestyling song.

1680
01:58:23,964 --> 01:58:24,564
[SPEAKER_23]: I can see the...

1681
01:58:25,004 --> 01:58:29,006
[SPEAKER_23]: I can see the butt shots and the kisses and everything.

1682
01:58:29,306 --> 01:58:30,206
[SPEAKER_11]: The video is great.

1683
01:58:30,226 --> 01:58:33,747
[SPEAKER_11]: We were able to actually see the video at E3 and play the song and the steps.

1684
01:58:33,787 --> 01:58:34,828
[SPEAKER_11]: The steps were pretty good, I gotta say.

1685
01:58:34,848 --> 01:58:36,208
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was only like a six, but it was fun.

1686
01:58:37,029 --> 01:58:41,590
[SPEAKER_11]: The video, they made a custom video for it based around Silent Hill characters.

1687
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:45,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And I gotta say, you guys, if you haven't looked at our picture gallery... It was a good video.

1688
01:58:45,292 --> 01:58:46,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at the picture gallery on our website.

1689
01:58:46,792 --> 01:58:47,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Just sign up for our website.

1690
01:58:47,673 --> 01:58:48,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It's free.

1691
01:58:48,053 --> 01:58:48,893
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't send you spam.

1692
01:58:49,593 --> 01:58:51,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Sign up for the website, and there's pictures.

1693
01:58:51,194 --> 01:58:52,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Sakura has a gallery.

1694
01:58:52,274 --> 01:58:53,095
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a gallery, and...

1695
01:58:53,835 --> 01:58:55,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd even has a gallery on there.

1696
01:58:55,176 --> 01:58:55,977
[SPEAKER_11]: It says Mikla Tavit.

1697
01:58:55,997 --> 01:58:57,258
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually Sigurd's photo gallery.

1698
01:58:58,219 --> 01:58:59,279
[SPEAKER_11]: All these pictures from E3.

1699
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:12,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, just to expand upon the video information, in the video you'll see Cynthia from Silent Hill 4 and Henry from Silent Hill 4, and then some backup dancers, and they are not in Silent Hill 4.

1700
01:59:13,050 --> 01:59:14,811
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no dancing in Silent Hill 4.

1701
01:59:15,052 --> 01:59:21,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you count writhing as dancing around when you're being eaten to death.

1702
01:59:22,617 --> 01:59:26,859
[SPEAKER_11]: You've actually seen the video for the song in a lot of these preview videos.

1703
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:32,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I do wish, though, that there were dancing in Silent Hill, because then I could have Pyramid Head dance.

1704
01:59:32,242 --> 01:59:33,402
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be the best thing ever.

1705
01:59:35,243 --> 01:59:38,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see the disembodied heads in the wheelchairs dance.

1706
01:59:39,445 --> 01:59:44,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I know some of you guys are probably dropping the stream right now, so I just wanted to say to you guys that are related to two hours ago that, hey, check us out again sometime.

1707
01:59:44,907 --> 01:59:49,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you guys enjoyed it, and check us out again sometime, and thanks for stopping by Orange Orange Radio.

1708
01:59:49,369 --> 01:59:50,289
[SPEAKER_02]: The show's not done.

1709
01:59:50,309 --> 01:59:55,791
[SPEAKER_11]: We still have an hour left to go, but I know there's some people that didn't want to have to sit through all this to hear that song, but you did, so thank you.

1710
01:59:56,011 --> 02:00:01,333
[SPEAKER_02]: What does our resident arcade building genius think of it?

1711
02:00:02,554 --> 02:00:03,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we didn't ask his opinion.

1712
02:00:04,535 --> 02:00:05,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what did you think, Loki?

1713
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:07,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh.

1714
02:00:08,662 --> 02:00:23,494
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think, you know, it's, uh, yeah, it's nice that Akira Yamaoka's doing songs and, you know, remixing them for DDR, but eh, I don't care for that stupid fucking, um, was it just shit?

1715
02:00:24,035 --> 02:00:28,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I don't know, I don't care for that R&B crap that they have right there.

1716
02:00:28,539 --> 02:00:32,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you know, give me a good, um, Akira Yamaoka hard, um, heavy metal, um,

1717
02:00:32,842 --> 02:01:02,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking track from Contra That's the shit that I want in DDR You know, fucking hard heavy metal guitars Yelling, screaming, none of this I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor Look at me dancing, I'm a remix of a song It's really stupid, I want the heavy metal I mean, that's the shit that I want in there Fuck, if they had a, you know, a US Guitar Freaks That would be awesome There will not be a US Guitar Freaks, just

1718
02:01:02,932 --> 02:01:03,652
[SPEAKER_13]: They're making that clear.

1719
02:01:06,113 --> 02:01:06,453
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1720
02:01:07,073 --> 02:01:08,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're going to go to a break.

1721
02:01:08,313 --> 02:01:10,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And those of you guys that wanted to drop, go ahead.

1722
02:01:10,494 --> 02:01:11,174
[SPEAKER_11]: So the other people can get in.

1723
02:01:11,194 --> 02:01:12,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, we are going to play the song again a little later.

1724
02:01:12,734 --> 02:01:14,854
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do a Bonnie match game when we come back.

1725
02:01:15,195 --> 02:01:15,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do that.

1726
02:01:16,135 --> 02:01:16,435
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be fun.

1727
02:01:16,475 --> 02:01:16,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, match game.

1728
02:01:16,795 --> 02:01:17,515
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to do that.

1729
02:01:17,675 --> 02:01:18,995
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to tell you guys who won the cage match.

1730
02:01:19,035 --> 02:01:19,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to tally up those votes, too.

1731
02:01:19,876 --> 02:01:21,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do something really cool during the break.

1732
02:01:21,616 --> 02:01:21,936
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

1733
02:01:22,136 --> 02:01:22,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Fold my laundry.

1734
02:01:23,076 --> 02:01:23,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun.

1735
02:01:24,016 --> 02:01:27,617
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this break, I think we're actually going to play songs from Max 2 USA.

1736
02:01:27,797 --> 02:01:28,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that'll be fun.

1737
02:01:28,417 --> 02:01:30,178
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to play some Max 2 USA songs.

1738
02:01:30,478 --> 02:01:31,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know...

1739
02:01:32,603 --> 02:01:33,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like hearing them.

1740
02:01:33,365 --> 02:01:34,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you guys feel like hearing them?

1741
02:01:35,147 --> 02:01:35,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1742
02:01:35,828 --> 02:01:36,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sure, alright.

1743
02:01:37,411 --> 02:01:39,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so let's hear those songs, and we'll be back.

1744
02:02:20,425 --> 02:02:22,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard you were alone

1745
02:02:53,098 --> 02:02:55,701
I heard for the first time I knew we were meant to be

1746
02:03:18,382 --> 02:03:22,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Will I ever love you again?

1747
02:03:25,228 --> 02:03:29,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Will we be together again?

1748
02:03:32,054 --> 02:03:36,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Thought the love we had was strong

1749
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:42,159
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1750
02:04:34,059 --> 02:04:34,940
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

[SPEAKER_11]: You're happy!

1758
02:06:54,728 --> 02:06:57,490
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the precursor to Mad Libs, honestly, if you think about it.

1759
02:07:13,394 --> 02:07:42,076
[SPEAKER_02]: basically we have two contestants in this case we're going to have somebody from one of our listeners call in on the skype line and then our newest guest on the show be our contestants basically you're going to be read a sentence and at the end of it the one word will be replaced with a blank and you have to fill in the blank of course the object is as it's called the match game you have to match us while we think of something and no the answer is not propel alright

1760
02:07:42,564 --> 02:07:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1761
02:07:43,205 --> 02:07:45,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Every game, the answer was always Propel.

1762
02:07:46,107 --> 02:07:47,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't drink Propel anymore.

1763
02:07:48,089 --> 02:07:50,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Propel is no longer a sponsor of Orange Lounge Radio.

1764
02:07:52,573 --> 02:07:55,155
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now sponsored by Dr. Atkins, even though he's dead.

1765
02:07:56,716 --> 02:07:57,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about that.

1766
02:07:57,677 --> 02:07:59,779
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't say I'm into that, but okay.

1767
02:07:59,999 --> 02:08:00,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

1768
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that, there's less of me to be here.

1769
02:08:06,004 --> 02:08:07,085
[SPEAKER_02]: That and working my ass off.

1770
02:08:09,321 --> 02:08:14,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been trying to find the match game song clips because I lost it when I did my reinstall.

1771
02:08:14,145 --> 02:08:16,566
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been that long since we've done match game, I've got to say.

1772
02:08:18,008 --> 02:08:19,489
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a new match game theme.

1773
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:23,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, do the match game theme.

1774
02:08:23,372 --> 02:08:23,692
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1775
02:08:23,732 --> 02:08:24,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn music.

1776
02:08:24,532 --> 02:08:26,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Play porn music because it's the same difference.

1777
02:08:26,294 --> 02:08:28,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, then I'll find some porn music.

1778
02:08:28,936 --> 02:08:30,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Play the Price is Right music.

1779
02:08:30,377 --> 02:08:31,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have the Price is Right music.

1780
02:08:32,979 --> 02:08:34,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Does everybody get a piece of paper and a pen?

1781
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:35,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you guys have that.

1782
02:08:37,401 --> 02:08:40,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, I'll play some erotic, that's close enough.

1783
02:08:43,365 --> 02:08:43,805
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll work.

1784
02:08:45,306 --> 02:08:46,947
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our new match game theme song.

1785
02:08:47,588 --> 02:08:48,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Sex on the phone?

1786
02:08:49,009 --> 02:08:49,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1787
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:51,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Rob.

1788
02:08:51,571 --> 02:08:53,872
[SPEAKER_11]: You might have to rip this up into little pieces.

1789
02:08:54,132 --> 02:08:56,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Andrew doesn't get a piece of paper because he's going to be our contestant.

1790
02:08:57,014 --> 02:09:01,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And for contestant number two, we're going to open up the Skype line.

1791
02:09:02,438 --> 02:09:04,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll see who gives us a call over on the Skype line.

1792
02:09:05,931 --> 02:09:07,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write all over Hello Kitty's face.

1793
02:09:08,133 --> 02:09:08,734
[SPEAKER_11]: You should do that.

1794
02:09:10,335 --> 02:09:11,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping somebody will call on the skyline.

1795
02:09:11,716 --> 02:09:15,180
[SPEAKER_11]: If nobody calls on the skyline, we're going to have to take one of our chatters, and I don't know if I want to do that.

1796
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody's got to call us on the skyline.

1797
02:09:19,464 --> 02:09:20,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, that piece of paper?

1798
02:09:20,765 --> 02:09:22,466
[SPEAKER_02]: It has clues as to what's in Extreme.

1799
02:09:24,728 --> 02:09:25,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1800
02:09:25,789 --> 02:09:26,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

1801
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:28,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm writing on the back of the Extreme V-Rare.

1802
02:09:28,792 --> 02:09:29,213
[SPEAKER_11]: My bad.

1803
02:09:31,236 --> 02:09:32,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a copy list.

1804
02:09:32,296 --> 02:09:35,698
[SPEAKER_10]: It says milk, cheese, butter.

1805
02:09:36,198 --> 02:09:36,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, can you hear us?

1806
02:09:36,938 --> 02:09:37,678
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1807
02:09:39,339 --> 02:09:39,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

1808
02:09:41,579 --> 02:09:42,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, hello, hello.

1809
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,401
[SPEAKER_11]: We cannot hear you.

1810
02:09:45,581 --> 02:09:46,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, buddy.

1811
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:47,870
[SPEAKER_20]: Dismissed!

1812
02:10:11,674 --> 02:10:13,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, much better.

1813
02:10:14,155 --> 02:10:14,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Much better.

1814
02:10:14,575 --> 02:10:15,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear that?

1815
02:10:15,275 --> 02:10:15,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

1816
02:10:15,455 --> 02:10:16,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I can hear that.

1817
02:10:16,676 --> 02:10:16,896
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1818
02:10:16,936 --> 02:10:17,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn it down.

1819
02:10:17,516 --> 02:10:17,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn it down.

1820
02:10:17,936 --> 02:10:18,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn it off.

1821
02:10:19,496 --> 02:10:19,776
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1822
02:10:20,377 --> 02:10:20,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

1823
02:10:21,177 --> 02:10:22,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Question number one.

1824
02:10:22,197 --> 02:10:23,958
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how the match game works, right, Richie?

1825
02:10:23,978 --> 02:10:24,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1826
02:10:24,518 --> 02:10:24,738
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1827
02:10:24,798 --> 02:10:25,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I know how this works.

1828
02:10:25,458 --> 02:10:25,998
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1829
02:10:26,018 --> 02:10:26,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

1830
02:10:27,439 --> 02:10:28,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Question number one.

1831
02:10:30,099 --> 02:10:31,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie was sick and tired.

1832
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:33,760
[SPEAKER_11]: You know her also, DarkSakura.

1833
02:10:34,941 --> 02:10:35,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you have to do this too, Loki.

1834
02:10:36,397 --> 02:10:44,179
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad when she would try and play DDR.

1835
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:48,761
[SPEAKER_11]: One day, one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.

1836
02:10:49,741 --> 02:10:52,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you, kid.

1837
02:10:53,302 --> 02:10:53,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Blank.

1838
02:10:57,823 --> 02:10:59,304
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when you play a song.

1839
02:11:01,905 --> 02:11:03,205
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to think of what would be in the blank.

1840
02:11:04,744 --> 02:11:05,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we can't.

1841
02:11:08,908 --> 02:11:15,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad when she would try and play DDR.

1842
02:11:15,795 --> 02:11:18,858
[SPEAKER_11]: One day one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.

1843
02:11:18,878 --> 02:11:21,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you, kid.

1844
02:11:22,302 --> 02:11:22,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Blank.

1845
02:11:30,714 --> 02:11:31,054
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1846
02:11:36,297 --> 02:11:36,637
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1847
02:11:36,697 --> 02:11:37,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's in ding?

1848
02:11:37,317 --> 02:11:37,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in.

1849
02:11:37,878 --> 02:11:38,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's not in?

1850
02:11:38,518 --> 02:11:39,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Amy's still working.

1851
02:11:39,718 --> 02:11:40,019
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1852
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:41,259
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all still working.

1853
02:11:41,299 --> 02:11:42,680
[SPEAKER_07]: You got ten seconds.

1854
02:11:44,161 --> 02:11:47,182
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1855
02:11:48,983 --> 02:11:49,323
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1856
02:11:49,363 --> 02:11:49,624
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1857
02:11:49,704 --> 02:11:50,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop the music.

1858
02:11:50,264 --> 02:11:50,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1859
02:11:50,844 --> 02:11:51,124
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1860
02:11:51,304 --> 02:11:52,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie, you still there with us?

1861
02:11:52,765 --> 02:11:53,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I am.

1862
02:11:53,205 --> 02:11:53,486
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1863
02:11:53,566 --> 02:11:53,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie.

1864
02:11:54,915 --> 02:12:00,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad when she would try and play DDR.

1865
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:03,762
[SPEAKER_11]: One day, one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.

1866
02:12:03,802 --> 02:12:06,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you, kid.

1867
02:12:07,185 --> 02:12:07,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Owned.

1868
02:12:08,326 --> 02:12:08,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Owned!

1869
02:12:09,908 --> 02:12:11,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Richie says owned.

1870
02:12:11,469 --> 02:12:14,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what his opponent, Andrew, has to say.

1871
02:12:14,652 --> 02:12:16,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew, I've got one word for you, kid.

1872
02:12:17,014 --> 02:12:17,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Owned.

1873
02:12:17,634 --> 02:12:17,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamey

1874
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:40,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops is not a match.

1875
02:12:40,611 --> 02:12:41,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1876
02:12:41,592 --> 02:12:43,933
[SPEAKER_11]: DDRholic, what did you say?

1877
02:12:43,973 --> 02:12:45,013
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not too creative today.

1878
02:12:45,413 --> 02:12:46,033
[SPEAKER_23]: Doctor.

1879
02:12:47,074 --> 02:12:48,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Doctor.

1880
02:12:48,334 --> 02:12:49,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that would be the nice thing to say.

1881
02:12:50,015 --> 02:12:51,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, the question was about Jamie.

1882
02:12:52,176 --> 02:12:53,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody boo DDRholic.

1883
02:12:53,617 --> 02:12:54,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Boo.

1884
02:12:54,857 --> 02:12:55,597
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding.

1885
02:12:55,657 --> 02:12:56,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't do that.

1886
02:12:56,618 --> 02:12:57,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Angel.

1887
02:12:57,938 --> 02:12:59,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I got one word for you, kid.

1888
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Incomplete, DarkSakura, FashionEye Die!

[SPEAKER_03]: Die!

02:13:05,622 --> 02:13:06,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Die!

1891
02:13:07,223 --> 02:13:15,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Die, alright, let's see Sigurd, you're playing knight I got one word, and maybe it's a hint, you guys No, you know what my battle cry is

1892

[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:13:17,061 --> 02:13:17,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Die of Death.

1894
02:13:17,901 --> 02:13:18,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Die of Death.

1895
02:13:18,582 --> 02:13:19,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I got one word for you, kid.

1896
02:13:20,242 --> 02:13:21,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Move your feet in extreme.

02:13:21,662 --> 02:13:22,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1898
02:13:22,063 --> 02:13:22,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1899
02:13:24,783 --> 02:13:25,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright.

1900
02:13:26,024 --> 02:13:27,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd, I've got one word for you, kid.

1901
02:13:28,164 --> 02:13:33,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I came up with hardly anything, so I went with propel, even though he said it's not going to be it.

1902
02:13:33,266 --> 02:13:33,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Propel.

1903
02:13:33,866 --> 02:13:34,566
[SPEAKER_09]: It was propel.

1904
02:13:35,146 --> 02:13:36,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, propel.

1905
02:13:36,227 --> 02:13:37,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1906
02:13:37,067 --> 02:13:39,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, I've got one word for you, kid.

1907
02:13:40,508 --> 02:13:41,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Classic.

1908
02:13:42,754 --> 02:13:43,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that.

1909
02:13:45,196 --> 02:13:46,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, I've got one word for you, kid.

1910
02:13:47,579 --> 02:13:48,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Abstinence.

1911
02:13:53,064 --> 02:13:53,884
[SPEAKER_10]: That's beautiful.

1912
02:13:54,345 --> 02:13:55,506
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no matches.

1913
02:13:55,806 --> 02:13:56,267
[SPEAKER_11]: No matches.

1914
02:13:57,928 --> 02:14:00,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that your second answer, Richie?

1915
02:14:01,331 --> 02:14:02,212
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1916
02:14:02,512 --> 02:14:03,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Abstinence, was that your second answer, maybe?

1917
02:14:04,354 --> 02:14:05,755
[SPEAKER_20]: No, but more like...

1918
02:14:07,011 --> 02:14:08,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Haha, or I don't know.

1919
02:14:08,652 --> 02:14:09,853
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not feeling creative tonight.

1920
02:14:10,013 --> 02:14:10,473
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright.

1921
02:14:10,793 --> 02:14:12,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go on to question number two then.

1922
02:14:12,734 --> 02:14:13,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, it's all tied up.

1923
02:14:13,835 --> 02:14:14,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing, nothing.

1924
02:14:14,515 --> 02:14:14,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

1925
02:14:16,296 --> 02:14:16,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Second question.

1926
02:14:17,196 --> 02:14:17,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Get the music ready.

1927
02:14:18,517 --> 02:14:18,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1928
02:14:20,098 --> 02:14:28,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki was getting sick and tired of the fact that whenever Andrew went to Golf Land dressed as a pirate, he got all the crowds watching him play DDR.

1929
02:14:29,763 --> 02:14:35,206
[SPEAKER_11]: In order to upstage him and get the attention back, Loki decided to show up dressed as a blank.

1930
02:14:38,678 --> 02:14:39,740
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, this is going to be a stink.

1931
02:14:58,897 --> 02:15:00,577
[SPEAKER_07]: That music for some reason makes me want chicken.

1932
02:15:19,042 --> 02:15:22,185
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say Barwinch, because I think he'd make a very sexy one.

1933
02:15:22,405 --> 02:15:23,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Barwinch!

1934
02:15:23,586 --> 02:15:25,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Barwinch is Andrew's answer.

1935
02:15:25,347 --> 02:15:28,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what the competitor Richie has to say.

1936
02:15:28,610 --> 02:15:30,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Dressed as a... French maid.

1937
02:15:31,132 --> 02:15:32,353
[SPEAKER_11]: French maid!

1938
02:15:32,373 --> 02:15:36,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, gee, this is a... That's a surprise coming from Richie, alright.

1939
02:15:37,217 --> 02:15:38,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if we've got a match.

1940
02:15:38,999 --> 02:15:42,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, dressed as a... I finally saw this, so you'll laugh at me.

1941
02:15:43,408 --> 02:15:50,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Dressed as Divine's role as Edna in Hairspray Very nice, dressed as Divine, and nobody in the scene is ever going to get that joke, but that's okay.

1942
02:15:51,113 --> 02:15:57,977
[SPEAKER_23]: DJaholic, Loki's going to show up dressed as... An Oscar Mayer wiener!

1943
02:15:58,778 --> 02:15:59,498
[SPEAKER_11]: You're gay!

1944
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:04,021
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's okay for me to say that.

1945
02:16:04,381 --> 02:16:10,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Angel, show up... Okay, this is completely unlike me to say it, but I got to just because it's playing on words.

1946
02:16:11,147 --> 02:16:12,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I said he would dress up as a cock.

1947
02:16:13,409 --> 02:16:14,490
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not that one!

1948
02:16:14,890 --> 02:16:16,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Dressed up as a cock, alright.

1949
02:16:17,112 --> 02:16:17,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd.

1950
02:16:18,793 --> 02:16:22,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd, Loki, in order to upstage him, showed up dressed as a penis.

1951
02:16:23,317 --> 02:16:23,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Penis!

1952
02:16:24,458 --> 02:16:27,040
[SPEAKER_11]: You could have gotten two points going for the dick joke.

1953
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:28,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Loki, what would you have to do?

1954
02:16:28,921 --> 02:16:34,906
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd have to show up dressed up as a... I'd have to dress up as Osama Bin Laden because he fucking rocks at DDR.

1955
02:16:37,148 --> 02:16:37,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

1956
02:16:38,354 --> 02:16:38,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, okay.

1957
02:16:39,035 --> 02:16:40,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that would certainly get you attention.

1958
02:16:41,136 --> 02:16:42,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Or as a Nazi.

1959
02:16:42,137 --> 02:16:43,438
[SPEAKER_13]: A Nazi would rock, too.

1960
02:16:44,299 --> 02:16:51,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if we could combine them all, we would have to have, like, a white hood with a turban and then maybe a swastika painted on that.

1961
02:16:52,025 --> 02:16:54,947
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be like the, uh... The Antichrist.

1962
02:16:55,508 --> 02:16:59,971
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, the, um... Yeah, I... I don't get it.

1963
02:17:00,111 --> 02:17:00,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, whatever.

1964
02:17:00,732 --> 02:17:01,272
[SPEAKER_13]: That was stupid.

1965
02:17:02,113 --> 02:17:04,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry for wasting your 30 seconds.

1966
02:17:06,152 --> 02:17:10,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I said in order to upstage, Loki would show up dressed as a crack whore.

1967
02:17:10,776 --> 02:17:12,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And when in doubt, crack whore, you guys.

1968
02:17:12,737 --> 02:17:13,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Crack whore.

1969
02:17:13,278 --> 02:17:13,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Universal joke.

1970
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:17,261
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I'd just blend into the crowd.

1971
02:17:19,682 --> 02:17:20,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I didn't think of that.

1972
02:17:20,663 --> 02:17:21,023
[SPEAKER_11]: You would.

1973
02:17:21,064 --> 02:17:21,904
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd totally bend into the crowd.

1974
02:17:21,924 --> 02:17:22,625
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I almost said?

1975
02:17:22,705 --> 02:17:23,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost said ninja.

1976
02:17:24,066 --> 02:17:30,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you've ever gone to realultimatepower.net, don't you know that the mortal enemy of all ninjas are pirates?

1977
02:17:31,211 --> 02:17:32,933
[SPEAKER_13]: An L-shaped Tetris block.

1978
02:17:33,513 --> 02:17:34,634
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

1979
02:17:34,974 --> 02:17:35,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be so rad.

1980
02:17:37,432 --> 02:17:38,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here we go.

1981
02:17:39,794 --> 02:17:41,956
[SPEAKER_11]: One more, or no, I'm sorry, we have three more questions, actually.

1982
02:17:41,976 --> 02:17:42,797
[SPEAKER_11]: We're making a long one tonight.

1983
02:17:43,137 --> 02:17:44,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, because we haven't done it in a while.

1984
02:17:44,558 --> 02:17:45,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, question number three.

1985
02:17:46,120 --> 02:17:57,269
[SPEAKER_11]: When Rob came home from work and saw Loki's main cabinet, the first thing he thought to himself was, gee, now that this thing is in my house, I can play nothing but blank all day long.

1986
02:17:59,731 --> 02:18:01,313
[SPEAKER_11]: It may not be the obvious choice.

1987
02:18:01,413 --> 02:18:03,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I can play nothing but blank all day long.

1988
02:18:03,695 --> 02:18:03,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Music.

1989
02:18:03,815 --> 02:18:04,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Music.

1990
02:18:09,313 --> 02:18:11,335
Dude, that heavy breathing is so turning me on.

1991
02:18:11,355 --> 02:18:11,555
Alright.

1992
02:18:11,695 --> 02:18:12,416
I'm teasing you, Richie.

1993
02:18:12,436 --> 02:18:12,496
No.

1994
02:18:39,276 --> 02:18:39,676
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1995
02:18:41,077 --> 02:18:41,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie.

1996
02:18:41,777 --> 02:18:42,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Dang.

1997
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:42,958
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1998
02:18:43,018 --> 02:18:44,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie's first this time, right?

1999
02:18:44,758 --> 02:18:45,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie, you're giving me a boner.

2000
02:18:45,839 --> 02:18:46,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it.

2001
02:18:46,259 --> 02:18:46,519
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2002
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:48,540
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, Rob.

2003
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:49,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah?

2004
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:49,780
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

2005
02:18:50,701 --> 02:18:51,241
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2006
02:18:51,261 --> 02:18:52,862
[SPEAKER_10]: What if Rob dressed up as a maid for you?

2007
02:18:55,043 --> 02:18:55,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2008
02:18:57,324 --> 02:18:59,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't you even get like a little bit of a boner?

2009
02:18:59,124 --> 02:18:59,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a half boner?

2010
02:19:00,045 --> 02:19:00,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a bone?

2011
02:19:01,676 --> 02:19:02,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, no.

2012
02:19:02,337 --> 02:19:04,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright.

2013
02:19:04,078 --> 02:19:04,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Not later, okay?

2014
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:06,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you're dropping out there, buddy.

2015
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:07,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Careful.

2016
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:08,782
[SPEAKER_11]: We gotta hear you for this answer, though, alright?

2017
02:19:09,442 --> 02:19:09,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, here we go.

2018
02:19:10,343 --> 02:19:14,566
[SPEAKER_11]: G, now that this thing is in my house, I can play nothing but blank all day long.

2019
02:19:14,626 --> 02:19:14,846
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2020
02:19:15,507 --> 02:19:22,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I was really gonna say, do you like horny bunnies, but then, I'm going to go with the chat room and say, um, let's see, girls panic.

2021
02:19:23,233 --> 02:19:24,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Gals panic.

2022
02:19:24,554 --> 02:19:25,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Gals panic.

2023
02:19:26,115 --> 02:19:30,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, gals panic is what, um, what he said, Richie.

2024
02:19:30,538 --> 02:19:30,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew?

2025
02:19:31,599 --> 02:19:32,180
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think?

2026
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:34,522
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to stay home and play blank all day long.

2027
02:19:34,602 --> 02:19:46,392
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he's going to stay home and play with himself, because that way Loki will be over here playing that, and that way he doesn't feel awkward when he's doing it, and Loki comes in and watches him like normal, so I think it'll be a lot more comfortable for Ron.

2028
02:19:46,412 --> 02:19:49,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so Andrew says he's just going to play with himself.

2029
02:19:49,354 --> 02:19:50,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Screw the machine, I'm going to play with myself.

2030
02:19:50,655 --> 02:19:52,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's a very good answer, actually.

2031
02:19:53,117 --> 02:19:55,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Jamie, I'm going to stay home and play...

2032
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:57,040
[SPEAKER_02]: BurgerTime.

2033
02:19:57,060 --> 02:19:57,980
[SPEAKER_11]: BurgerTime!

2034
02:19:58,020 --> 02:19:59,981
[SPEAKER_11]: The chat room was trying to get you guys to say it.

2035
02:20:00,001 --> 02:20:00,841
[SPEAKER_11]: BurgerTime.

2036
02:20:00,961 --> 02:20:01,661
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's see.

2037
02:20:03,262 --> 02:20:03,922
[SPEAKER_11]: DDRholic.

2038
02:20:04,822 --> 02:20:06,002
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2039
02:20:06,262 --> 02:20:12,004
[SPEAKER_23]: And by the way, for those of you who don't know, it's DDRcoholic, but I let Rob call me holic.

2040
02:20:12,024 --> 02:20:12,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, sorry.

2041
02:20:12,524 --> 02:20:13,884
[SPEAKER_11]: DDRcoholic.

2042
02:20:14,004 --> 02:20:15,405
[SPEAKER_23]: No, that's your name for me.

2043
02:20:15,765 --> 02:20:16,525
[SPEAKER_23]: That's your name for me.

2044
02:20:16,585 --> 02:20:17,025
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2045
02:20:17,605 --> 02:20:18,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I just like holic.

2046
02:20:20,246 --> 02:20:23,586
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, I thought that Loki would love... Hold on, Richie.

2047
02:20:23,786 --> 02:20:24,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Enough with the heavy breathing.

2048
02:20:24,747 --> 02:20:25,667
[SPEAKER_11]: You're turning me on over here.

2049
02:20:26,767 --> 02:20:28,068
[SPEAKER_23]: I know I'm getting like all wet and stuff.

2050
02:20:28,108 --> 02:20:28,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

2051
02:20:29,528 --> 02:20:30,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait.

2052
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, you are over 18, right?

2053
02:20:32,629 --> 02:20:34,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I am turning 21 this year.

2054
02:20:34,729 --> 02:20:35,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, boy, that's hot.

2055
02:20:35,710 --> 02:20:35,990
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2056
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:36,870
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2057
02:20:37,050 --> 02:20:37,410
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2058
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:38,130
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

2059
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:38,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

2060
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:39,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Decided to stay home and play?

2061
02:20:40,191 --> 02:20:41,311
[SPEAKER_23]: And play Q-Bert.

2062
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:42,191
[SPEAKER_23]: Q-Bert.

2063
02:20:42,251 --> 02:20:42,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Good answer.

2064
02:20:42,952 --> 02:20:44,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Q-Bert is a game I would play all day long.

2065
02:20:45,852 --> 02:20:47,113
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Angel, what would you say?

2066
02:20:47,133 --> 02:20:47,933
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you going to call me?

2067
02:20:48,733 --> 02:20:50,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost said DDR Alcoholic again.

2068
02:20:50,634 --> 02:20:51,394
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Angel.

2069
02:20:52,430 --> 02:20:53,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Pole Position.

2070
02:20:53,691 --> 02:20:54,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Pole Position!

2071
02:20:54,891 --> 02:20:55,812
[SPEAKER_11]: All these are great answers.

2072
02:20:55,852 --> 02:20:57,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I would play Pole Position all day long.

2073
02:20:57,072 --> 02:20:57,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd.

2074
02:21:00,313 --> 02:21:01,734
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only because I saw it today.

2075
02:21:01,934 --> 02:21:02,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Gals Panic.

2076
02:21:03,075 --> 02:21:04,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Gals Panic!

2077
02:21:04,435 --> 02:21:05,095
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a match!

2078
02:21:05,115 --> 02:21:05,636
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a match.

2079
02:21:05,656 --> 02:21:07,096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a match for Richie!

2080
02:21:07,577 --> 02:21:08,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Richie gets a point.

2081
02:21:09,737 --> 02:21:10,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2082
02:21:10,878 --> 02:21:11,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

2083
02:21:11,698 --> 02:21:13,259
[SPEAKER_11]: He decided to stay home and play.

2084
02:21:14,028 --> 02:21:16,990
[SPEAKER_13]: We wonder why we don't play this game all the time.

2085
02:21:18,291 --> 02:21:26,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, the answer would be Miss Mr. NudeWorld96.

2086
02:21:27,358 --> 02:21:31,841
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, that's Miss World 96 with the boys in it instead of the girls.

2087
02:21:32,762 --> 02:21:33,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Good answer.

2088
02:21:33,602 --> 02:21:35,424
[SPEAKER_11]: My answer was, actually...

2089
02:21:36,284 --> 02:21:39,565
[SPEAKER_11]: My answer was I would stay home and play Miss World 96 Nude, actually.

2090
02:21:39,625 --> 02:21:40,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I also said that.

2091
02:21:40,325 --> 02:21:43,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Except I didn't say the Mr. version because that version is broken and it keeps crashing.

2092
02:21:44,067 --> 02:21:47,028
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to play the version that has the Move Your Body song.

2093
02:21:47,568 --> 02:21:50,069
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've never played Miss World 96 Nude, go download it right now.

2094
02:21:50,109 --> 02:21:50,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It rocks.

2095
02:21:50,569 --> 02:21:50,829
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2096
02:21:51,749 --> 02:21:53,850
[SPEAKER_11]: That has been what I've been playing all day, too, honestly.

2097
02:21:54,270 --> 02:21:55,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I play that more than anything else.

2098
02:21:55,991 --> 02:21:56,331
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2099
02:21:56,891 --> 02:21:58,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie's up by one, but let's see.

2100
02:21:58,351 --> 02:21:59,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Two more questions to go.

2101
02:21:59,372 --> 02:21:59,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Ready?

2102
02:22:00,332 --> 02:22:01,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, this is a question about Sigurd.

2103
02:22:02,673 --> 02:22:02,993
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2104
02:22:05,029 --> 02:22:09,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd can become very tired after having to be a Konami slave all day long.

2105
02:22:10,893 --> 02:22:17,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Luckily, Konami takes care of its employees and keeps Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free blank.

2106
02:22:19,378 --> 02:22:19,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Music.

2107
02:22:24,537 --> 02:22:27,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free playing.

2108
02:22:55,723 --> 02:22:56,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I guess it's done.

2109
02:22:57,428 --> 02:22:59,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's see what everybody thought.

2110
02:23:00,997 --> 02:23:02,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting off with our contestants.

2111
02:23:03,507 --> 02:23:06,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd can become very tired after having to be a Konami slave all day long.

2112
02:23:06,570 --> 02:23:10,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Luckily, Konami takes care of its employees and keeps Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free... Andrew?

2113
02:23:11,073 --> 02:23:14,376
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to say something like caffeine or coffee or something like that.

2114
02:23:14,436 --> 02:23:16,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, free coffee, let's say.

2115
02:23:16,958 --> 02:23:17,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Free coffee.

2116
02:23:18,159 --> 02:23:18,359
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2117
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:20,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Free stimulants.

2118
02:23:20,781 --> 02:23:21,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Stimulants is good.

2119
02:23:21,902 --> 02:23:22,222
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2120
02:23:23,023 --> 02:23:24,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie, you there?

2121
02:23:24,664 --> 02:23:25,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I am.

2122
02:23:25,585 --> 02:23:29,028
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to keep Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free...

2123
02:23:29,841 --> 02:23:30,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Blowjobs.

2124
02:23:30,902 --> 02:23:32,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Blowjobs!

2125
02:23:32,443 --> 02:23:34,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's see if anybody gets a match.

2126
02:23:34,726 --> 02:23:36,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I didn't know, ooh, maybe I should go work for Konami.

2127
02:23:37,388 --> 02:23:37,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2128
02:23:38,629 --> 02:23:43,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, keeps him a happy boy with all of the free... Politary torture sessions.

2129
02:23:43,694 --> 02:23:45,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Politary torture sessions.

2130
02:23:45,375 --> 02:23:46,476
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't make me happy!

2131
02:23:47,477 --> 02:23:48,518
[SPEAKER_11]: That would make me sad.

2132
02:23:48,538 --> 02:23:49,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2133
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:50,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2134
02:23:52,506 --> 02:23:55,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep Seegert a very happy boy with all of the free... Did you get a hug?

2135
02:23:55,987 --> 02:23:57,127
[SPEAKER_23]: How about Red Bull?

2136
02:23:57,647 --> 02:23:58,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Red Bull!

2137
02:23:59,708 --> 02:24:00,768
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a match!

2138
02:24:00,868 --> 02:24:02,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a match with the stimulants.

2139
02:24:02,289 --> 02:24:02,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

2140
02:24:03,229 --> 02:24:04,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, it's all tied up now.

2141
02:24:05,129 --> 02:24:05,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2142
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:08,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Angel.

2143
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:10,271
[SPEAKER_11]: She's still writing.

2144
02:24:10,311 --> 02:24:10,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

2145
02:24:10,611 --> 02:24:11,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up!

2146
02:24:12,031 --> 02:24:13,291
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the free... Junk.

2147
02:24:14,052 --> 02:24:14,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Junk!

2148
02:24:14,672 --> 02:24:16,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I didn't know what to put.

2149
02:24:16,992 --> 02:24:17,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame, I know.

2150
02:24:18,153 --> 02:24:18,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright.

2151
02:24:20,487 --> 02:24:21,588
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright, no worries.

2152
02:24:21,988 --> 02:24:26,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Sigurd, they keep you happy with all of the free.

2153
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:33,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, everybody would have thought I would say Akira Yamaoka anything, but no, I put Suikoden Yaoi fanfics.

2154
02:24:34,394 --> 02:24:36,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Suikoden Yaoi fanfics!

2155
02:24:37,216 --> 02:24:38,156
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd make me happy.

2156
02:24:39,437 --> 02:24:41,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, all of the free.

2157
02:24:42,379 --> 02:24:46,521
[SPEAKER_13]: I said stimulants, and when I mean stimulants, I mean Akira Yamaoka porn.

2158
02:24:48,661 --> 02:24:50,783
[SPEAKER_13]: All of the home videos you don't get to see.

2159
02:24:52,865 --> 02:24:54,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I don't think that's a match though, sorry.

2160
02:24:54,967 --> 02:24:55,968
[SPEAKER_11]: A different kind of stimulant.

2161
02:24:56,088 --> 02:24:56,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2162
02:24:57,049 --> 02:25:03,635
[SPEAKER_11]: My answer was, keep Sigrid a very happy boy with all of the free grape-feeding men in togas.

2163
02:25:05,477 --> 02:25:06,578
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds pretty stimulating.

2164
02:25:06,598 --> 02:25:09,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't they have that room at Konami with all the great feeding men in the togas?

2165
02:25:11,523 --> 02:25:12,584
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still looking for hints.

2166
02:25:14,574 --> 02:25:16,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, Toga, that's the song.

2167
02:25:16,335 --> 02:25:16,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2168
02:25:18,576 --> 02:25:19,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

2169
02:25:19,637 --> 02:25:20,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on.

2170
02:25:20,137 --> 02:25:20,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Last question, guys.

2171
02:25:21,598 --> 02:25:22,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Last question, guys.

2172
02:25:22,179 --> 02:25:22,459
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready?

2173
02:25:23,099 --> 02:25:23,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's go.

2174
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:26,221
[SPEAKER_11]: See, now this question isn't as funny anymore.

2175
02:25:26,241 --> 02:25:30,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to do it before the big premiere, but just imagine we haven't done Your Rain yet, okay?

2176
02:25:30,343 --> 02:25:30,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

2177
02:25:32,585 --> 02:25:42,931
[SPEAKER_11]: When we told the listeners that it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play Your Rain tonight, the first thing the listeners did was blank the hosts.

2178
02:25:46,088 --> 02:25:46,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Music.

2179
02:25:51,253 --> 02:25:51,954
[SPEAKER_23]: Horn music.

2180
02:25:52,094 --> 02:25:55,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear this song makes me think it should also be for a chicken commercial.

2181
02:26:22,419 --> 02:26:23,099
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here it is.

2182
02:26:23,179 --> 02:26:23,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiebreaker.

2183
02:26:23,819 --> 02:26:24,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's your chance.

2184
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:26,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to start with Richie this time.

2185
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:33,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie, when we told the listeners that it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play Your Rain tonight, the first thing the listeners did was blank the host.

2186
02:26:34,574 --> 02:26:37,195
[SPEAKER_20]: was to have spicy hot orgasms with the host.

2187
02:26:37,315 --> 02:26:39,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Spicy hot orgasms.

2188
02:26:39,176 --> 02:26:39,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

2189
02:26:39,776 --> 02:26:40,036
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2190
02:26:40,076 --> 02:26:40,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

2191
02:26:41,156 --> 02:26:43,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew, first thing they were going to do was what to the host?

2192
02:26:43,897 --> 02:26:50,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, tie them up and force them to listen to, like, Good Charlotte and Linkin Park, which is more punishing than anything I could think of.

2193
02:26:50,919 --> 02:26:51,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

2194
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:52,120
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty bad.

2195
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:52,460
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2196
02:26:52,660 --> 02:26:53,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.

2197
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:53,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2198
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:54,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if we get a match.

2199
02:26:54,961 --> 02:26:57,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, they decided to blank the host.

2200
02:26:57,942 --> 02:26:58,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Mooned.

2201
02:26:59,142 --> 02:26:59,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Mooned!

2202
02:27:00,122 --> 02:27:01,163
[SPEAKER_11]: They made us look at their minds.

2203
02:27:01,223 --> 02:27:01,983
[SPEAKER_23]: On their webcams.

2204
02:27:02,003 --> 02:27:02,883
[SPEAKER_11]: On their webcams.

2205
02:27:03,604 --> 02:27:04,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Good answer.

2206
02:27:04,724 --> 02:27:05,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a match.

2207
02:27:05,564 --> 02:27:06,145
[SPEAKER_11]: DDRholic.

2208
02:27:06,865 --> 02:27:09,986
[SPEAKER_23]: This might be close to the steamy orgasms.

2209
02:27:10,326 --> 02:27:10,726
[SPEAKER_23]: Queefed?

2210
02:27:12,467 --> 02:27:13,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

2211
02:27:13,427 --> 02:27:15,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a little bit different.

2212
02:27:15,548 --> 02:27:16,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you sure?

2213
02:27:16,168 --> 02:27:17,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a little different, honey.

2214
02:27:18,489 --> 02:27:19,149
[SPEAKER_11]: A little different, honey.

2215
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:20,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2216
02:27:20,310 --> 02:27:21,050
[SPEAKER_11]: DDRangel.

2217
02:27:21,090 --> 02:27:23,651
[SPEAKER_03]: They decided to... Flash 90 bits on a webcam.

2218
02:27:24,022 --> 02:27:26,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Flash Naughty Bits on their webcam to the host.

2219
02:27:26,383 --> 02:27:27,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope, doesn't work.

2220
02:27:27,303 --> 02:27:27,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, bud.

2221
02:27:28,423 --> 02:27:28,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd.

2222
02:27:30,644 --> 02:27:31,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie.

2223
02:27:31,724 --> 02:27:32,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes?

2224
02:27:32,784 --> 02:27:33,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop.

2225
02:27:33,424 --> 02:27:35,205
[SPEAKER_11]: You're making me... Later.

2226
02:27:36,265 --> 02:27:36,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

2227
02:27:38,866 --> 02:27:41,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I was boring, and I just said murdered the host.

2228
02:27:41,486 --> 02:27:43,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Murdered.

2229
02:27:43,187 --> 02:27:43,867
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a good answer.

2230
02:27:44,047 --> 02:27:44,667
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Loki.

2231
02:27:45,928 --> 02:27:47,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Ban from DDR Freak.

2232
02:27:49,247 --> 02:27:50,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awfully hard.

2233
02:27:50,888 --> 02:27:53,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Considering one of our hosts is a moderator, that would be kind of hard.

2234
02:27:53,970 --> 02:27:55,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless it was April Fool's time again.

2235
02:27:56,572 --> 02:27:57,812
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a hilarious joke.

2236
02:27:57,892 --> 02:27:58,233
[SPEAKER_10]: That was funny.

2237
02:27:58,273 --> 02:27:58,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Did I ever tell you that?

2238
02:27:59,293 --> 02:28:00,694
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2239
02:28:01,414 --> 02:28:01,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Rob.

2240
02:28:01,955 --> 02:28:02,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2241
02:28:02,335 --> 02:28:02,595
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2242
02:28:02,615 --> 02:28:02,795
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2243
02:28:03,055 --> 02:28:03,376
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2244
02:28:03,396 --> 02:28:03,736
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2245
02:28:03,756 --> 02:28:04,616
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2246
02:28:05,257 --> 02:28:05,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch, what?

2247
02:28:07,318 --> 02:28:08,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine, I won't tell you.

2248
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:08,679
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2249
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:11,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a hint?

2250
02:28:11,921 --> 02:28:12,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a hint?

2251
02:28:13,021 --> 02:28:14,562
[SPEAKER_10]: The hint is the new ferret mix.

2252
02:28:14,662 --> 02:28:14,963
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2253
02:28:17,279 --> 02:28:18,099
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here it is.

2254
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:18,980
[SPEAKER_11]: My answer.

2255
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:27,264
[SPEAKER_11]: When we told the listeners it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play your reign tonight, the first thing the listeners did was give money to the hosts because that's what I need them to do.

2256
02:28:27,304 --> 02:28:27,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, bribe us.

2257
02:28:27,664 --> 02:28:28,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us money.

2258
02:28:29,865 --> 02:28:30,765
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2259
02:28:30,945 --> 02:28:32,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Webcam, yo, webcam.

2260
02:28:35,087 --> 02:28:35,587
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2261
02:28:36,027 --> 02:28:37,368
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to do it for tonight's match game.

2262
02:28:37,388 --> 02:28:38,549
[SPEAKER_11]: The final score, guys.

2263
02:28:39,129 --> 02:28:40,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew, one point.

2264
02:28:40,490 --> 02:28:40,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

2265
02:28:41,310 --> 02:28:44,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie, one point, which means they tied.

2266
02:28:44,831 --> 02:28:45,692
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what that means?

2267
02:28:46,602 --> 02:28:47,303
[SPEAKER_11]: You both lose!

2268
02:28:47,363 --> 02:28:48,344
[SPEAKER_11]: You both lose!

2269
02:28:48,724 --> 02:28:49,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job!

2270
02:28:50,666 --> 02:28:54,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And now that you've lost the match game, how do you feel?

2271
02:28:55,191 --> 02:28:55,911
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you going to do now?

2272
02:28:56,993 --> 02:28:59,595
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'm going to go back into the bathroom for another ten minutes.

2273
02:29:00,736 --> 02:29:01,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, sounds good.

2274
02:29:01,757 --> 02:29:02,418
[SPEAKER_11]: You do that.

2275
02:29:02,438 --> 02:29:03,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember to flush.

2276
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:04,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2277
02:29:06,322 --> 02:29:06,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

2278
02:29:07,163 --> 02:29:09,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Richie, thanks for playing, but you lose.

2279
02:29:10,967 --> 02:29:11,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Any last words you want to say?

2280
02:29:13,569 --> 02:29:17,071
[SPEAKER_20]: Amy, when I come on that show, I am going to stomp those bears down my pants.

2281
02:29:17,612 --> 02:29:18,032
[SPEAKER_20]: That is all.

2282
02:29:18,432 --> 02:29:19,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye, thank you.

2283
02:29:20,854 --> 02:29:21,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2284
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:23,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we've got it.

2285
02:29:23,796 --> 02:29:27,219
[SPEAKER_11]: We have not even talked about Bomani news yet, and we've still got the FUs of the week to do.

2286
02:29:27,339 --> 02:29:31,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Loki, Loki's going to cast, what, yes, Secret Dude.

2287
02:29:31,542 --> 02:29:37,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for the listeners that aren't in the chat room, there sounds like there will be hints coming next week, for real.

2288
02:29:38,047 --> 02:29:38,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Real ones.

2289
02:29:38,787 --> 02:29:39,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, real ones.

2290
02:29:39,809 --> 02:29:49,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So, be on the lookout Alright, sounds good Let's get to some of our other Bomani news Loki's going to kind of run down what's been going on here

2291
02:29:50,427 --> 02:29:55,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, since we kind of bypassed that whole section of the show, because that's not important, no one really cares.

2292
02:29:56,451 --> 02:30:01,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, first off, 2DX Red, or 2DX11, was testing now in Japan.

2293
02:30:02,475 --> 02:30:06,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, we have the first, you know, song list that's out over there.

2294
02:30:06,959 --> 02:30:08,400
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some really cool stuff.

2295
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:13,963
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a brand new DJ setup track, Spiritual Galaxy, a brand new 8th

2296
02:30:15,595 --> 02:30:24,498
[SPEAKER_13]: 8PLUS, which is Gigadelic, and then there's also a bunch of other tracks that are on there.

2297
02:30:24,958 --> 02:30:26,939
[SPEAKER_13]: New Walls track, which is pretty sweet.

2298
02:30:27,839 --> 02:30:36,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a lot of cool stuff, check it out on Bomani Style, or Air Japan, or any other site that carries Bomani news, because you've got tons of info on it.

2299
02:30:37,876 --> 02:30:38,977
[SPEAKER_13]: New stuff that's going to be in there.

2300
02:30:39,017 --> 02:30:46,543
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a new ranking thing that's on the side of the screen as you're playing the game, which shows your combo versus the max combo on the machine, which I thought was pretty neat.

2301
02:30:46,743 --> 02:30:50,526
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's very red, hence the name 2DX Red.

2302
02:30:50,946 --> 02:30:57,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, there'll be more songs coming out as time goes on right now, because with each test, of course, they add more songs to it and stuff.

2303
02:30:58,272 --> 02:31:02,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Supposedly, there's going to be a lot more new songs coming, and it just looks pretty sweet.

2304
02:31:05,278 --> 02:31:12,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, a Eurotrans-style version of Platonic X, which makes me sad.

2305
02:31:13,163 --> 02:31:18,707
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, and Secret of Love, new DJ Swan track, also did Gentle Stress, so that'd be pretty cool.

2306
02:31:19,708 --> 02:31:26,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Aside from that kind of stuff, well, I know there's a lot of Sim stuff...

2307
02:31:28,227 --> 02:31:29,868
[SPEAKER_11]: There was big sim news this week.

2308
02:31:31,049 --> 02:31:39,075
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've just been spending your time on the internet doing nothing but waiting for Extreme and Ultramix 2 hints, you're missing some of the stuff that's going on in the sim scene.

2309
02:31:39,095 --> 02:31:42,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And while that might be questionable or whatever, there is some good stuff going on.

2310
02:31:42,798 --> 02:31:43,638
[SPEAKER_11]: What is going on right now?

2311
02:31:43,658 --> 02:31:44,379
[SPEAKER_11]: There is some big stuff.

2312
02:31:44,479 --> 02:31:46,860
[SPEAKER_13]: My god, there is a bunch of big stuff going on.

2313
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:50,383
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, the best sim filmmakers on the face of the fucking earth.

2314
02:31:51,276 --> 02:31:54,377
[SPEAKER_13]: The FoonMix team, they released FoonMix Plus, which is awesome.

2315
02:31:54,417 --> 02:31:55,437
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to go check it out.

2316
02:31:55,997 --> 02:31:57,197
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 15 brand new songs.

2317
02:31:57,277 --> 02:32:01,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of the songs are from Diverse7, which is also out right now.

2318
02:32:02,339 --> 02:32:09,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Diverse7 is actually going to be featuring three different CDs with actual key sound files for BMS players.

2319
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:11,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, it's the Beatmania 2DX Sims.

2320
02:32:12,841 --> 02:32:15,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And I gotta say, these artists are fucking awesome.

2321
02:32:15,381 --> 02:32:17,862
[SPEAKER_13]: They do really kick-ass Bomani remixes.

2322
02:32:18,442 --> 02:32:19,603
[SPEAKER_13]: and you need to go check them out.

2323
02:32:19,683 --> 02:32:23,025
[SPEAKER_13]: If you haven't heard of Diverse Systems before, you can definitely check them out.

2324
02:32:23,166 --> 02:32:27,469
[SPEAKER_13]: It's at www.diverse.jp and go check it out.

2325
02:32:27,489 --> 02:32:28,389
[SPEAKER_13]: They have an English page.

2326
02:32:28,429 --> 02:32:31,171
[SPEAKER_13]: You can order the CDs and they're really kick-ass.

2327
02:32:31,251 --> 02:32:34,734
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were actually the ones that were distributing Bounce Connected for a while there, so...

2328
02:32:35,294 --> 02:32:36,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely check it out.

2329
02:32:36,515 --> 02:32:43,258
[SPEAKER_13]: But some of the cool stuff that's on there, you've got a few remixes I'd like to kind of just tease a little bit.

2330
02:32:43,278 --> 02:32:44,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we can play these in a break or something.

2331
02:32:45,259 --> 02:32:46,520
[SPEAKER_13]: There was some new ones.

2332
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:51,042
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a new track by Offbeat, which did some really kick-ass stuff.

2333
02:32:51,983 --> 02:32:55,085
[SPEAKER_13]: This would be the Holic remix called Holics.

2334
02:32:56,145 --> 02:32:59,307
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was pretty sweet, so let me just play a little bit in the middle here.

2335
02:33:04,215 --> 02:33:05,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that was pretty sweet.

2336
02:33:05,496 --> 02:33:17,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, um, we've also got, there's a brand new, um, what was it, Innocent Walls remix, which, oh my god, it's fucking awesome.

2337
02:33:17,949 --> 02:33:19,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, let's see here.

2338
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:27,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's see, ch-ch-ch.

2339
02:33:38,345 --> 02:33:42,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Just some really kick-ass stuff, and of course, they make awesome videos that go with everything.

2340
02:33:42,867 --> 02:33:44,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Steps are really good.

2341
02:33:44,687 --> 02:33:45,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely go check it out.

2342
02:33:46,048 --> 02:33:51,190
[SPEAKER_13]: There's remixes of G2, Max 300, of course, but, you know, it's really awesome.

2343
02:33:51,890 --> 02:34:00,753
[SPEAKER_13]: There's remixes of 20 November, Brilliant to You, Holic, as I mentioned before, The Safari, just a bunch of really cool stuff.

2344
02:34:01,494 --> 02:34:02,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Go check it out, and

2345
02:34:03,149 --> 02:34:11,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Since it is all in one pack, you do get the original Foon Mix as well, which there's tons of songs in that, all the same quality, just excellent.

2346
02:34:11,675 --> 02:34:12,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Go check that out.

2347
02:34:14,558 --> 02:34:20,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Aside from that, there's been more work being done on the front of starting to rip stuff from games.

2348
02:34:20,442 --> 02:34:32,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, there's a guy working on ripping all the characters, the 3D characters from the PlayStation versions, and all the background graphics and stuff, and the progress so far has been really cool, and you can check that on DDR Maniacs.

2349
02:34:33,547 --> 02:34:34,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Step Mania Forums

2350
02:35:03,564 --> 02:35:05,465
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's pretty much what's going on right now.

2351
02:35:05,665 --> 02:35:13,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard that there was going to be an Alpha 22 for Stepmania 3.9, but apparently not yet.

2352
02:35:14,188 --> 02:35:16,489
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's coming soon.

2353
02:35:17,930 --> 02:35:18,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2354
02:35:18,910 --> 02:35:20,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for catching up on the news.

2355
02:35:20,431 --> 02:35:25,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we kind of got pushed aside because of all the other crap we got going on tonight, but there is other news going on out there.

2356
02:35:26,133 --> 02:35:27,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks for bringing it up.

2357
02:35:27,173 --> 02:35:28,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody want to comment on any of the news?

2358
02:35:30,629 --> 02:35:31,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you guys are easy to please.

2359
02:35:32,009 --> 02:35:32,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Talkative bunch.

2360

[SPEAKER_11]: Talkative bunch, aren't you?

2361
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:34,290
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2362
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:38,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what we're going to do now, actually, we'll take a quick break and we're going to play some songs.

2363
02:35:38,431 --> 02:35:40,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, actually, I have to announce tonight's winner of the cage match.

2364
02:35:40,812 --> 02:35:41,212
[SPEAKER_11]: My bad.

2365
02:35:42,013 --> 02:35:43,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight's winner of the cage match.

2366
02:35:44,653 --> 02:35:49,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually kind of surprised by this, but Loki's remix has been dethroned and we have a new winner.

2367
02:35:52,512 --> 02:35:53,213
[SPEAKER_04]: ASTRO SEXY

2373
02:36:42,833 --> 02:36:45,515
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take a break, and we're actually going to play two tracks from FoonMix.

2374
02:36:45,535 --> 02:36:49,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play the Max remix, because I think it's really good, and we're going to play the Safari, because I like that one.

2375
02:36:49,537 --> 02:36:51,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought we'd play those for the guys.

2376
02:36:51,698 --> 02:36:53,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are pretty cool, yeah.

2377
02:36:53,399 --> 02:36:54,039
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all good.

2378
02:36:54,199 --> 02:36:54,940
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all good, really.

2379
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:58,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, my favorites of the new one have to be the Innocent Walls one.

2380
02:36:58,722 --> 02:37:01,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'll take out... I'll put in Innocent Walls, too.

2381
02:37:01,323 --> 02:37:03,685
[SPEAKER_13]: The Innocent Walls one is fucking awesome.

2382
02:37:03,825 --> 02:37:11,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the guys from FoonMix did enter TourneyMix 5, but the entry that they picked was one of the worst ones that they did.

2383
02:37:12,168 --> 02:37:14,751
[SPEAKER_13]: But if they picked one of these, oh my god, it would have owned everybody.

2384
02:37:14,811 --> 02:37:21,198
[SPEAKER_13]: But whatever, you know, I'm sure they're not out to brag because they know they're kick-ass and they don't really need to prove it.

2385
02:37:21,298 --> 02:37:24,902
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, rock.

2386
02:37:25,083 --> 02:37:27,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so we'll get that in there too then.

2387
02:37:27,065 --> 02:37:29,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got to remember, is that it?

2388
02:37:31,089 --> 02:37:31,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sure is.

2389
02:37:31,991 --> 02:37:34,193
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, then we'll do this song first, why don't we?

2390
02:37:35,113 --> 02:37:36,935
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do that Innocent Walls remix.

2391
02:37:36,955 --> 02:37:38,896
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when we come back, we are going to do the FUs of the week.

2392
02:37:38,936 --> 02:37:40,617
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we have to keep it fast tonight.

2393
02:37:40,938 --> 02:37:42,499
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to run through everybody in the room.

2394
02:37:42,639 --> 02:37:47,142
[SPEAKER_11]: And unfortunately tonight, only selected chatroom FUs will be read.

2395
02:37:47,182 --> 02:37:49,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you send me a long one, not going to get read.

2396
02:37:49,864 --> 02:37:55,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So think of something really good if you have a good story, and I apologize in advance, but we are running on a limited schedule tonight, so keep them short.

2397
02:37:56,288 --> 02:38:00,190
[SPEAKER_11]: FUs from chatroom will be limited, but send those to Sky over private message.

2398
02:38:00,210 --> 02:38:00,750
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is.

2399
02:38:01,090 --> 02:38:01,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.

2400
02:38:01,651 --> 02:38:06,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Some remix songs from the latest Foon Mix, starting off with an Innocent Walls vocal mix.

2401
02:38:06,533 --> 02:38:08,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Max remix, and then a guitar remix.

2402
02:38:08,354 --> 02:38:09,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me get the actual title.

2403
02:38:09,655 --> 02:38:11,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, because I want to be correct on this.

2404
02:38:12,977 --> 02:38:17,720
[SPEAKER_13]: This title of this remix here is called Made in Innocent.

2405
02:38:18,422 --> 02:38:20,023
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a short version by Onokin.

2406
02:38:20,263 --> 02:38:22,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Onokin, which fucking rocks, did P8107.

2407
02:38:23,545 --> 02:38:28,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Rumored to have a song in 2DX Red, but I think that's pretty much a rumor.

2408
02:38:28,247 --> 02:38:31,149
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be awesome if he did, but just a rumor for now.

2409
02:38:32,430 --> 02:38:33,730
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, check it out.

2410
02:38:34,031 --> 02:38:35,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome work.

2411
02:38:35,651 --> 02:38:37,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't forget, Your Rain will be back again at 9.40.

2412
02:38:37,492 --> 02:38:38,453
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to play that again.

2413
02:38:38,513 --> 02:38:39,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, anyway, here we go.

2414
02:38:40,514 --> 02:38:41,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Some stuff from Foomix.

2415
02:38:41,254 --> 02:38:42,195
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back with the FUs of the Week.

2416
02:39:25,021 --> 02:39:31,545
You are saying Let's stay together You are saying Let's stay together

2417
02:40:16,292 --> 02:40:17,292
DarkSakura.com

2418
02:40:49,778 --> 02:40:50,164
Thank you.

2419
02:42:26,933 --> 02:42:27,906
Thanks for watching!

2420
02:43:22,489 --> 02:43:24,011
What should I do with my cuteness?

2421
02:43:24,031 --> 02:43:24,572
What should I do?

2422
02:44:28,907 --> 02:44:41,672
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

2423
02:44:55,003 --> 02:44:58,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we are a little bit random here on Orange Lawns Radio, if you haven't guessed.

2424
02:44:58,105 --> 02:44:58,525
[SPEAKER_21]: A little.

2425
02:44:58,905 --> 02:44:59,426
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

2426
02:44:59,446 --> 02:45:01,367
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of guys stuck around after the Eurage thing.

2427
02:45:01,387 --> 02:45:01,707
[SPEAKER_11]: You like us.

2428
02:45:01,727 --> 02:45:02,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate you.

2429
02:45:02,327 --> 02:45:03,148
[SPEAKER_02]: You really like us.

2430
02:45:03,188 --> 02:45:04,069
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we do appreciate it.

2431
02:45:04,129 --> 02:45:08,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We like our listeners to stick with us because then we feel good about ourselves.

2432
02:45:08,231 --> 02:45:09,292
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been trying here, you guys.

2433
02:45:09,312 --> 02:45:10,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It validates us for the week.

2434
02:45:10,692 --> 02:45:12,474
[SPEAKER_11]: We think it's a fun thing to do on a Sunday night.

2435
02:45:12,534 --> 02:45:15,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, it's not like I'm going to church or anything.

2436
02:45:15,555 --> 02:45:16,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we're getting paid for this.

2437
02:45:16,816 --> 02:45:18,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we don't get paid for this either.

2438
02:45:18,077 --> 02:45:18,917
[SPEAKER_02]: We pay for this.

2439
02:45:19,178 --> 02:45:19,458
[SPEAKER_11]: We do.

2440
02:45:20,472 --> 02:45:20,812
[SPEAKER_11]: With our souls!

2441
02:45:20,832 --> 02:45:23,795
[SPEAKER_11]: We have this whole buildup of angst and we need to have a big bad release of it or else we like explode.

2442
02:45:47,782 --> 02:45:49,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here we go then.

2443
02:45:50,067 --> 02:45:52,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, it's time to do the FUs of the week.

2444
02:45:52,092 --> 02:45:52,473
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready?

2445
02:45:53,054 --> 02:45:53,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready, Rob.

2446
02:46:08,968 --> 02:46:14,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to give a big F you to the three root beers that I've had that facilitated that loud belch.

2447
02:46:14,810 --> 02:46:16,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm normally not as unladylike.

2448
02:46:16,650 --> 02:46:18,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually am a lot more unladylike.

2449
02:46:18,811 --> 02:46:20,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, really.

2450
02:46:21,212 --> 02:46:26,113
[SPEAKER_02]: A big F you to impatience, especially for people who drive.

2451
02:46:26,853 --> 02:46:34,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And another F you goes to ARC for not posting my financial aid stuff and certifying my loans so I can get my fucking money.

2452
02:46:35,536 --> 02:46:35,896
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

2453
02:46:37,217 --> 02:46:37,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being nice.

2454
02:46:38,961 --> 02:46:40,305
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the freaking running out of time.

2455
02:46:40,645 --> 02:46:41,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

2456
02:46:42,109 --> 02:46:42,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your turn.

2457
02:46:47,104 --> 02:46:51,948
[SPEAKER_13]: I fucking hate stupid skanky drivers who can't fucking drive.

2458
02:46:52,549 --> 02:46:55,912
[SPEAKER_13]: I had this stupid bitch last weekend still pissing me off.

2459
02:46:55,992 --> 02:47:02,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking cut me off when I'm driving just to get behind a slow person that was in front of me.

2460
02:47:03,138 --> 02:47:03,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh wow, guess what?

2461
02:47:03,998 --> 02:47:06,640
[SPEAKER_13]: You got to the intersection a whole half a second faster than I did.

2462
02:47:07,721 --> 02:47:10,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Good, now you can go fuck another sheep and have your next child.

2463
02:47:11,184 --> 02:47:11,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2464
02:47:12,745 --> 02:47:22,451
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, because I'm going to keep this short, um, fuck you to sluts at my work who get higher up in the company about fucking your box.

2465
02:47:23,372 --> 02:47:25,733
[SPEAKER_13]: And openly admitting it and bragging about it.

2466
02:47:26,554 --> 02:47:29,155
[SPEAKER_13]: I fucking hate you and I will take you down.

2467
02:47:29,456 --> 02:47:31,317
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not talking about it in a good way.

2468
02:47:33,238 --> 02:47:33,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm done.

2469
02:47:35,379 --> 02:47:35,760
[SPEAKER_11]: My turn.

2470
02:47:41,880 --> 02:48:00,017
[SPEAKER_11]: And a few to myself for the fact that I'm paying about $13.95 a month to play Final Fantasy XI And I have touched it a whopping one time this whole week Because I found better things to do for once in my life For once in my life, no, because I found something even better than Ragnarok I went out and I went on a date this week, so that was something better to do, so...

2471
02:48:00,938 --> 02:48:01,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's finally.

2472
02:48:03,921 --> 02:48:04,821
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's all I'm going to say.

2473
02:48:05,001 --> 02:48:08,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to talk too much because I might dig myself a hole.

2474
02:48:08,604 --> 02:48:10,406
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I'm just glad I got out of the house.

2475
02:48:10,426 --> 02:48:12,167
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

2476
02:48:14,849 --> 02:48:15,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a hint?

2477
02:48:15,489 --> 02:48:16,310
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2478
02:48:17,891 --> 02:48:21,574
[SPEAKER_11]: My other FU goes to that burning smell in my car.

2479
02:48:21,714 --> 02:48:23,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I cracked my radiator or something.

2480
02:48:24,276 --> 02:48:28,980
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually, I just ran over a plastic bag and it wrapped itself around my pipe and caught itself on fire.

2481
02:48:29,485 --> 02:48:32,027
[SPEAKER_11]: So F you to people that leave plastic bags in the road.

2482
02:48:32,287 --> 02:48:33,628
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell you do that for?

2483
02:48:34,528 --> 02:48:37,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Stupid.

2484
02:48:38,511 --> 02:48:38,831
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2485
02:48:40,072 --> 02:48:40,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on.

2486
02:48:40,612 --> 02:48:43,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to our other studio guests.

2487
02:48:45,276 --> 02:48:47,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting off with, who's got a microphone over there?

2488
02:48:48,158 --> 02:48:51,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Mr. Andrew, what do you have to say?

2489
02:48:51,380 --> 02:48:51,900
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to what?

2490
02:48:52,180 --> 02:48:56,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well I'd like to give a big fuck you to all the bar and speed mod haters out there.

2491
02:48:56,383 --> 02:48:59,245
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just like to piss you guys off right now before I get started.

2492
02:48:59,745 --> 02:49:03,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to talk to you more about the bar raping thing tonight, but we just ran out of time.

2493
02:49:03,807 --> 02:49:04,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll come back.

2494
02:49:04,248 --> 02:49:05,308
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta come back, alright.

2495
02:49:05,328 --> 02:49:05,909
[SPEAKER_15]: We ain't got time.

2496
02:49:06,209 --> 02:49:09,791
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd also like to give a big F you to everybody that lives in Glen Rose, Texas.

2497
02:49:10,352 --> 02:49:14,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care if I know you or not, but just that whole town needs to just be wiped off the map.

2498
02:49:14,875 --> 02:49:20,217
[SPEAKER_15]: And last but not least, if you're a friend that I told to listen tonight and you're not listening, fuck you guys.

2499
02:49:20,397 --> 02:49:21,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't ever talk to me again.

2500
02:49:21,617 --> 02:49:23,258
[SPEAKER_15]: If you are listening, I love you.

2501
02:49:24,218 --> 02:49:25,578
[SPEAKER_15]: In a platonic kind of way.

2502
02:49:25,838 --> 02:49:26,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's all I got.

2503
02:49:27,139 --> 02:49:28,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, very nice.

2504
02:49:28,599 --> 02:49:28,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Angel.

2505
02:49:28,899 --> 02:49:31,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm going to go through this real quick because I got one from Agus as well.

2506
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:41,763
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, F you to sitting on my ass on a perfectly good Sunday doing nothing except for answering people's phone calls and they happen to be going to the wrong department.

2507
02:49:42,244 --> 02:49:43,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's the only one there.

2508
02:49:44,408 --> 02:49:58,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I'd like to say a quick F you to the stoplight on Arden and Del Paso because it is the longest piece of crap I've ever waited on and it happened to be while I was trying to get over here.

2509
02:49:59,091 --> 02:50:02,212
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going, okay, I can go now, really, I really want to get here.

2510
02:50:02,232 --> 02:50:06,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I'm like, you know, an Orange Lounge freak like that.

2511
02:50:06,633 --> 02:50:09,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, next person.

2512
02:50:09,413 --> 02:50:10,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, one more F you.

2513
02:50:10,553 --> 02:50:12,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you to Burger King for making me shit like crazy.

2514
02:50:14,724 --> 02:50:15,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

2515
02:50:15,624 --> 02:50:16,024
[SPEAKER_11]: TMI.

2516
02:50:16,164 --> 02:50:16,504
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2517
02:50:16,985 --> 02:50:17,765
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Coholic.

2518
02:50:18,505 --> 02:50:19,605
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, hey.

2519
02:50:20,645 --> 02:50:21,165
[SPEAKER_23]: What's up?

2520
02:50:21,486 --> 02:50:21,726
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2521
02:50:22,546 --> 02:50:28,287
[SPEAKER_23]: I was going to originally start off by saying fuck you to not having any fuck you because I... I said fuck you.

2522
02:50:28,667 --> 02:50:30,848
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, because I could never participate.

2523
02:50:31,108 --> 02:50:32,348
[SPEAKER_23]: I would have to pass the microphones.

2524
02:50:32,368 --> 02:50:33,648
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't have any fuck yous.

2525
02:50:33,948 --> 02:50:35,169
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what to say.

2526
02:50:35,489 --> 02:50:37,049
[SPEAKER_23]: But now I have a little something.

2527
02:50:37,069 --> 02:50:40,570
[SPEAKER_23]: I can say like, okay, fuck you to not having any good arcades anymore around town.

2528
02:50:40,930 --> 02:50:41,430
[SPEAKER_23]: Where are they?

2529
02:50:42,424 --> 02:50:42,924
[SPEAKER_23]: Where are they?

2530
02:50:44,344 --> 02:50:47,465
[SPEAKER_23]: We should still build one, yeah.

2531
02:50:47,625 --> 02:50:51,626
[SPEAKER_23]: And then, fuck you to the post office thing that's at our apartment complex.

2532
02:50:51,686 --> 02:50:54,146
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like a mile away from my apartment.

2533
02:50:54,166 --> 02:50:55,886
[SPEAKER_23]: I have to actually drive to get there.

2534
02:50:55,966 --> 02:50:57,107
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a pain in the butt.

2535
02:50:57,947 --> 02:50:59,507
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's unbelievable.

2536
02:50:59,547 --> 02:51:00,907
[SPEAKER_23]: Our apartment complex is huge.

2537
02:51:01,487 --> 02:51:03,688
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're on the other side of the post office.

2538
02:51:03,708 --> 02:51:05,148
[SPEAKER_23]: It's all the way on one end of the complex.

2539
02:51:05,168 --> 02:51:06,008
[SPEAKER_23]: You could put it in the middle.

2540
02:51:06,248 --> 02:51:07,388
[SPEAKER_23]: No, they don't do that.

2541
02:51:07,448 --> 02:51:08,789
[SPEAKER_23]: They put it on one end.

2542
02:51:09,249 --> 02:51:10,169
[SPEAKER_23]: So anyway, fuck you to that.

2543
02:51:10,569 --> 02:51:10,969
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it.

2544
02:51:12,350 --> 02:51:14,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

2545
02:51:14,251 --> 02:51:14,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Sigurd!

2546
02:51:15,832 --> 02:51:21,576
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to relatives that start charging you rent after living there a month and you have to sleep in the kitchen.

2547
02:51:23,037 --> 02:51:24,158
[SPEAKER_20]: You're sleeping in the kitchen?

2548
02:51:24,178 --> 02:51:25,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm sleeping in the kitchen.

2549
02:51:25,119 --> 02:51:25,979
[SPEAKER_09]: You are so Cinderella.

2550
02:51:26,239 --> 02:51:26,680
[SPEAKER_09]: It's horrible.

2551
02:51:26,720 --> 02:51:27,800
[SPEAKER_11]: I made that comparison the other night.

2552
02:51:28,041 --> 02:51:31,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't like it because that would mean I'd have to wear a dress or something.

2553
02:51:33,044 --> 02:51:35,205
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the chatroom because it's funny.

2554
02:51:37,266 --> 02:51:47,491
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to people who read into what we say far too much and F you to your guys' crazy photoshop skills because

2555
02:51:48,066 --> 02:51:50,047
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really creepy, but funny, so keep it up.

2556
02:51:50,487 --> 02:51:53,489
[SPEAKER_11]: See, Konami employees are real people too, you guys.

2557
02:51:54,590 --> 02:51:57,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go to the chatroom FU, shall we?

2558
02:51:57,211 --> 02:51:58,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I forgot another big one.

2559
02:51:58,372 --> 02:51:58,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very sorry.

2560
02:51:59,933 --> 02:52:04,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And FU to not having time or money to go where I want to go and see who I want to see.

2561
02:52:06,257 --> 02:52:06,997
[SPEAKER_03]: One really quick one.

2562
02:52:07,718 --> 02:52:13,321
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the post office for holding all of our mail because we're still trying to get forwards and stuff.

2563
02:52:13,641 --> 02:52:15,082
[SPEAKER_03]: That really sucks for three weeks now.

2564
02:52:16,044 --> 02:52:22,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you know, Miklatov or whatever the hell you go by now, don't stress out, just mellow out, be gentle.

2565
02:52:24,139 --> 02:52:25,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Have some gentle stress.

2566
02:52:26,043 --> 02:52:26,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

2567
02:52:28,283 --> 02:52:29,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, was that a hint?

2568
02:52:29,604 --> 02:52:30,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that a hint?

2569
02:52:31,145 --> 02:52:31,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2570
02:52:31,805 --> 02:52:34,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Gentle Stress is in a version of DDR.

2571
02:52:34,627 --> 02:52:35,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here we go.

2572
02:52:35,848 --> 02:52:36,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this is going to be good.

2573
02:52:38,050 --> 02:52:39,270
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm loving this first one already.

2574
02:52:39,431 --> 02:52:41,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go into the chatroom FUs.

2575
02:52:42,272 --> 02:52:43,653
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start a fight here tonight.

2576
02:52:44,394 --> 02:52:47,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Tora would like to give an FU to Jamie, also known as DarkSakura.

2577
02:52:48,256 --> 02:52:48,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

2578
02:52:49,057 --> 02:52:51,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she gave me warning points for no reason way back when.

2579
02:52:53,217 --> 02:52:55,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if I warn you, it's for a fucking reason.

2580
02:52:55,818 --> 02:52:56,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You did something wrong.

2581
02:52:56,939 --> 02:52:59,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, keep in mind, you lose a freaking point a month.

2582
02:53:01,201 --> 02:53:02,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably gone.

2583
02:53:03,683 --> 02:53:05,423
[SPEAKER_11]: How could you possibly piss off DarkSakura?

2584
02:53:05,443 --> 02:53:07,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I could never imagine how you would make her mad.

2585
02:53:07,444 --> 02:53:09,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you break the rules I warn your ass.

2586
02:53:09,325 --> 02:53:10,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that easy.

2587
02:53:10,646 --> 02:53:14,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Panda says, F you to my HDD with all my stuff for crashing on me when I needed it.

2588
02:53:14,908 --> 02:53:20,051
[SPEAKER_11]: John Field says, F you to PSO, Blue Burst, Hacker, Broom.

2589
02:53:20,431 --> 02:53:21,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop hacking this thing.

2590
02:53:24,531 --> 02:53:25,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Fancy Star Online.

2591
02:53:25,552 --> 02:53:26,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't followed that game in years.

2592
02:53:26,873 --> 02:53:30,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Burst is the one for PC.

2593
02:53:30,996 --> 02:53:35,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Unknown Gamer says, I want to say a big old F you to making me wait two hours to listen to your rain.

2594
02:53:35,499 --> 02:53:37,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, F you, buddy.

2595
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:38,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It was going to be three.

2596
02:53:38,941 --> 02:53:41,023
[SPEAKER_11]: We were going to play it like the very last thing.

2597
02:53:41,423 --> 02:53:42,464
[SPEAKER_11]: We were being nice.

2598
02:53:43,344 --> 02:53:47,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Not my fault, you guys thought, because this show is from 6.30, 9.30, you'll be right at 6.30.

2599
02:53:48,090 --> 02:53:49,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Then what would we do with the rest of the show?

2600
02:53:49,992 --> 02:53:51,233
[SPEAKER_11]: What would we do with ourselves?

2601
02:53:51,393 --> 02:53:53,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be the Listen to Rob Play With Himself show.

2602
02:53:53,395 --> 02:53:53,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

2603
02:53:55,598 --> 02:53:57,280
[SPEAKER_11]: At least we're better than G4.

2604
02:53:57,840 --> 02:53:58,961
[SPEAKER_11]: We are much better than G4.

2605
02:53:58,981 --> 02:53:59,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely right.

2606
02:53:59,983 --> 02:54:01,805
[SPEAKER_11]: At least the premiere wasn't on G4.

2607
02:54:01,865 --> 02:54:02,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank your lucky stars.

2608
02:54:03,519 --> 02:54:04,679
[SPEAKER_03]: We got it first.

2609
02:54:04,920 --> 02:54:07,120
[SPEAKER_11]: El Mullet says F you to Pants.

2610
02:54:07,681 --> 02:54:09,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn Pants, the bane of all evil.

2611
02:54:10,042 --> 02:54:11,482
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, fuck Pants.

2612
02:54:11,622 --> 02:54:13,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, remember Pants was Rage?

2613
02:54:14,123 --> 02:54:15,404
[SPEAKER_23]: Ooh, Pants was Rage.

2614
02:54:15,444 --> 02:54:22,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Wizkid would like to say F you to old ladies who call the tech support line and yell at me because they're too dumb to understand what reboot means.

2615
02:54:23,567 --> 02:54:24,727
[SPEAKER_02]: How about boot to the ass?

2616
02:54:27,709 --> 02:54:28,469
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I reboot?

2617
02:54:28,940 --> 02:54:29,260
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2618
02:54:30,801 --> 02:54:37,305
[SPEAKER_11]: MJB would like to say, my FU of the week goes to my shitty internet for disconnecting me from Orange Lounge Radio, almost causing me to miss my FUs of the week.

2619
02:54:38,265 --> 02:54:39,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can't have that, can we?

2620
02:54:40,106 --> 02:54:42,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other week, you would have been okay with the cap thing, I swear.

2621
02:54:42,487 --> 02:54:43,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight's just crazy.

2622
02:54:44,088 --> 02:54:47,810
[SPEAKER_11]: EvilMalke2DX says, FU to Aqua Teen Hunger Force ending next Sunday.

2623
02:54:49,071 --> 02:54:50,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay!

2624
02:54:50,692 --> 02:54:54,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Jazz says, FU to me for leaving my cell phone on silent.

2625
02:54:55,074 --> 02:54:58,056
[SPEAKER_11]: I just found missed calls from two of my bestest friends.

2626
02:54:59,003 --> 02:55:01,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, do you have brain cancer because you hiccup?

2627
02:55:20,612 --> 02:55:25,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Vandalus says, My FU is for the Sacramento Kings and their recent drama.

2628
02:55:25,733 --> 02:55:28,614
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a friggin' soap opera full of spoiled millionaires.

2629
02:55:30,315 --> 02:55:31,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, amen.

2630
02:55:31,095 --> 02:55:32,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God they're leaving.

2631
02:55:32,835 --> 02:55:33,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, now.

2632
02:55:34,016 --> 02:55:34,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Play nice.

2633
02:55:35,756 --> 02:55:37,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you're going to start another fight here.

2634
02:55:37,497 --> 02:55:38,037
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2635
02:55:38,477 --> 02:55:42,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the people who get bent out of shape over sports rivalries really need to get a life.

2636
02:55:43,217 --> 02:55:44,158
[SPEAKER_11]: One more last minute one here.

2637
02:55:44,258 --> 02:55:47,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Arkara says, F you to Andrew for not giving me my sexiness.

2638
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:49,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

2639
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:49,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a hidden message?

2640
02:55:50,641 --> 02:55:51,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait about two weeks.

2641
02:55:51,622 --> 02:55:52,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you need to take this offline?

2642
02:55:53,162 --> 02:55:54,703
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think we're all good.

2643
02:55:55,504 --> 02:55:56,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Just give me two weeks or something.

2644
02:55:56,904 --> 02:55:57,305
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on.

2645
02:55:57,525 --> 02:55:57,925
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on.

2646
02:55:58,645 --> 02:55:58,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2647
02:56:01,507 --> 02:56:02,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't decided yet.

2648
02:56:02,307 --> 02:56:03,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Is somebody going to get served?

2649
02:56:03,948 --> 02:56:06,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Sucker's going to get chronicled.

2650
02:56:06,609 --> 02:56:07,310
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what's up.

2651
02:56:07,590 --> 02:56:07,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2652
02:56:08,711 --> 02:56:09,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys...

2653
02:56:10,106 --> 02:56:10,946
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the end of the show.

2654
02:56:11,006 --> 02:56:11,686
[SPEAKER_11]: We're already here.

2655
02:56:11,706 --> 02:56:11,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Cry.

2656
02:56:12,407 --> 02:56:13,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, cry.

2657
02:56:13,527 --> 02:56:16,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you guys for listening and making it a great show tonight.

2658
02:56:17,168 --> 02:56:20,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope we don't need exclusives to make you guys keep listening to us.

2659
02:56:20,969 --> 02:56:22,229
[SPEAKER_02]: We are exclusive.

2660
02:56:22,269 --> 02:56:26,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully you liked it and you'll come back, but if not, hey, thanks for wasting three hours with us tonight.

2661
02:56:26,430 --> 02:56:27,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you liked the song.

2662
02:56:28,451 --> 02:56:31,332
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2663
02:56:31,392 --> 02:56:32,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's start off with D.D.

2664
02:56:32,372 --> 02:56:32,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Archaholic.

2665
02:56:33,510 --> 02:56:35,090
[SPEAKER_11]: DD Alcoholic, your final thought.

2666
02:56:35,170 --> 02:56:36,571
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like Jerry Springer's final thought.

2667
02:56:36,651 --> 02:56:37,671
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your final thought.

2668
02:56:37,991 --> 02:56:42,192
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, well, quick shout out to my boyfriend, Jason, DarkChild999.

2669
02:56:42,272 --> 02:56:43,892
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if he's listening or not.

2670
02:56:44,032 --> 02:56:44,433
[SPEAKER_23]: He might be.

2671
02:56:45,213 --> 02:56:51,214
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, and final thought, uh, chewing gum that tastes like grape is really good.

2672
02:56:53,795 --> 02:56:54,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2673
02:56:54,815 --> 02:56:56,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Angel, your final thought.

2674
02:56:57,876 --> 02:57:00,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I carry a mocha because I can.

2675
02:57:01,937 --> 02:57:02,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2676
02:57:02,917 --> 02:57:02,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh,

2677
02:57:04,096 --> 02:57:05,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Akira is a good thing.

2678
02:57:06,036 --> 02:57:06,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Andrew.

2679
02:57:06,877 --> 02:57:08,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say thanks for having me on the show.

2680
02:57:08,757 --> 02:57:11,558
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope to be back in the future and this place kicks ass.

2681
02:57:11,658 --> 02:57:14,338
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's way too much fucking Pokemon in here, man.

2682
02:57:15,059 --> 02:57:15,719
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

2683
02:57:15,859 --> 02:57:17,759
[SPEAKER_15]: It's creeping me the hell out.

2684
02:57:18,139 --> 02:57:18,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a minute.

2685
02:57:18,479 --> 02:57:19,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

2686
02:57:19,020 --> 02:57:19,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold that thought.

2687
02:57:19,500 --> 02:57:20,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold that thought.

2688
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:21,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

2689
02:57:21,280 --> 02:57:21,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one minute.

2690
02:57:25,621 --> 02:57:28,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the time when we fill air while Rob goes away.

2691
02:57:28,262 --> 02:57:30,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Better than filling air for three hours while...

2692
02:57:34,622 --> 02:57:35,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna put that on the cam, you guys.

2693
02:57:56,571 --> 02:57:58,272
[SPEAKER_13]: There's those moments that are really cool.

2694
02:57:58,372 --> 02:58:00,032
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of like watching bad movies.

2695
02:58:00,393 --> 02:58:03,794
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, eventually you'll get to a moment that's really funny and stuff.

2696
02:58:03,974 --> 02:58:05,074
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like watching Xanadu.

2697
02:58:05,314 --> 02:58:05,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

2698
02:58:06,875 --> 02:58:09,176
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I've never seen that, so that doesn't make any sense to me.

2699
02:58:09,536 --> 02:58:10,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like watching Battle Royale 2.

2700
02:58:11,617 --> 02:58:12,677
[SPEAKER_13]: God, that movie sucked.

2701
02:58:12,957 --> 02:58:14,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't see Battle Royale 2.

2702
02:58:15,378 --> 02:58:20,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead, download the camera rip of Kashan, because that fucking rocks.

2703
02:58:21,741 --> 02:58:21,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2704
02:58:24,506 --> 02:58:31,358
[SPEAKER_11]: and my final thought is please come back and listen to us again even though we're not going to have any more premieres.

2705
02:58:31,618 --> 02:58:33,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Please come back and listen.

2706
02:58:34,082 --> 02:58:37,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I didn't say, do I always have to go last?

2707
02:58:37,087 --> 02:58:37,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2708
02:58:39,127 --> 02:58:40,128
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2709
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:03,481
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if it's a low-carb cookie.

2710
02:59:03,701 --> 02:59:04,101
[SPEAKER_11]: A low-carb cookie.

2711
02:59:04,121 --> 02:59:04,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2712
02:59:05,021 --> 02:59:05,641
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2713
02:59:05,921 --> 02:59:11,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I was such a disbeliever for this stupid Atkins diet because, you know, it's sort of what your body does before it dies.

2714
02:59:12,163 --> 02:59:12,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But it works.

2715
02:59:13,263 --> 02:59:14,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'm going to die.

2716
02:59:14,843 --> 02:59:15,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

2717
02:59:15,023 --> 02:59:15,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll lose a lot of weight.

2718
02:59:17,864 --> 02:59:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is that Diet Hansen's root beer is the best thing in the world.

2719
02:59:23,428 --> 02:59:23,668
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2720
02:59:24,329 --> 02:59:24,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.

2721
02:59:25,309 --> 02:59:26,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Second best thing in the world.

2722
02:59:26,110 --> 02:59:26,450
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lovely.

2723
02:59:26,470 --> 02:59:27,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Next to orgasms.

2724
02:59:27,891 --> 02:59:28,151
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2725
02:59:28,171 --> 02:59:31,774
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do have to say that orgasms are very nice.

2726
02:59:32,134 --> 02:59:32,434
[SPEAKER_11]: They are.

2727
02:59:32,474 --> 02:59:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: They should just sell canned orgasms.

2728
02:59:35,156 --> 02:59:35,636
[SPEAKER_11]: They should.

2729
02:59:36,257 --> 02:59:37,037
[SPEAKER_02]: For all those people who do.

2730
02:59:37,057 --> 02:59:37,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Orgasm array.

2731
02:59:38,866 --> 02:59:39,346
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

2732
02:59:41,688 --> 02:59:42,028
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2733
02:59:43,368 --> 02:59:44,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Sigurd, your final thought.

2734
02:59:44,949 --> 02:59:48,911
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I hope everybody liked the remix of Your Rain.

2735
02:59:48,951 --> 02:59:52,473
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really fun in DDR, so look forward to that.

2736
02:59:52,793 --> 02:59:56,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Also look forward to this week when it sounds like we might really be giving clues out.

2737
02:59:58,216 --> 03:00:03,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to be cool, and thanks for listening to me whore myself out over the radio.

2738
03:00:05,552 --> 03:00:09,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, and final word of the show.

2739
03:00:10,574 --> 03:00:11,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to give it to Andrew?

2740
03:00:11,935 --> 03:00:12,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's give it to Andrew.

2741
03:00:13,756 --> 03:00:17,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one word that sums up the entire show, but it can only be one word that sums everything up.

2742
03:00:18,458 --> 03:00:19,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Suckers.

2810
03:09:14,321 --> 03:09:24,567
[SPEAKER_09]: The original version of that is kind of boring, but that one with the crazy singing, I was listening to it on BARD at night, going home from work, and I was seriously freaking out.

2811
03:09:24,647 --> 03:09:25,568
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the best.

[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.

2817
03:09:32,416 --> 03:09:38,822
[SPEAKER_11]: We promised we were going to do it one more time, so if you're back on the stream, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, and thanks for tuning in to us tonight.

2818
03:09:38,862 --> 03:09:41,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Hope you catch our show next week when we shouldn't have these listening cap problems.

2819
03:09:41,965 --> 03:09:43,606
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to play Your Rain one more time, you guys.

03:09:56,965 --> 03:10:01,970
[SPEAKER_07]: You touched my body once, it burned.

2829
03:10:36,872 --> 03:10:57,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm waiting for a gentle rain, a gentle rain, a gentle you On the sidewalk of the city, on the streets just a whisper Busy people going nowhere, see me smoking the rain No compassion, nothing matters, my resistance is way

2832
03:11:23,906 --> 03:11:26,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anything else you guys want to say?

2833
03:11:26,588 --> 03:11:29,170
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of had all that take up our afterbirth.

2834
03:11:29,230 --> 03:11:30,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going home.

2835
03:11:31,392 --> 03:11:36,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know what, I've got to drive Secret back to the bay, so I think I've got to keep this kind of short, because it's a long drive home, but that's alright.

2836
03:11:38,297 --> 03:11:38,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mind.

2837
03:11:38,717 --> 03:11:39,978
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've got a way home too, right Angel?

2838
03:11:41,159 --> 03:11:41,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, good.

2839
03:11:42,140 --> 03:11:42,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool, everything's set.

2840
03:11:43,001 --> 03:11:43,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Angel.

2841
03:11:44,673 --> 03:11:45,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone call me at kthx, bye.

2842
03:11:46,995 --> 03:11:47,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Because nobody ever calls me.

2843
03:11:49,377 --> 03:11:50,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I can call you names.

2844
03:11:50,698 --> 03:11:51,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I can call you names.

2845
03:11:51,479 --> 03:11:52,699
[SPEAKER_11]: On the phone!

2846
03:11:53,040 --> 03:11:56,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want me to call you on the phone and call you names?

2847
03:11:56,723 --> 03:12:01,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you want to just give out your phone number over the air so that random strangers will call you?

2848
03:12:02,387 --> 03:12:04,069
[SPEAKER_10]: For a good time, call 555.

2849
03:12:04,109 --> 03:12:04,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2850
03:12:08,396 --> 03:12:09,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Sigurd, what's up?

2851
03:12:09,897 --> 03:12:11,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you guys have been patient.

2852
03:12:11,898 --> 03:12:13,559
[SPEAKER_11]: The chat room has been grilling.

2853
03:12:14,219 --> 03:12:20,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, they're like rabid DDR Freak fans, or Orange Lounge fans, or fan fans.

2854
03:12:20,783 --> 03:12:23,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully both after tonight's show, that's the goal.

2855
03:12:23,684 --> 03:12:28,447
[SPEAKER_09]: But you guys were really patient, so I figured I'd give you one hint, because I'm nice.

2856
03:12:28,587 --> 03:12:30,208
[SPEAKER_11]: No way, you're actually able to give a hint?

2857
03:12:30,268 --> 03:12:31,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally giving one hint.

2858
03:12:31,689 --> 03:12:32,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.

2859
03:12:32,809 --> 03:12:33,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, very sexy.

2860
03:12:33,590 --> 03:12:34,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what is it?

2861
03:12:34,330 --> 03:12:36,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, now you guys might have to read into this a little bit.

2862
03:12:36,251 --> 03:12:37,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're good at it, so it's okay.

2863
03:12:39,048 --> 03:12:42,490
[SPEAKER_09]: One new song in Xtreme has steps.

2864
03:12:45,852 --> 03:12:47,053
[SPEAKER_09]: With up arrows.

2865
03:12:49,014 --> 03:12:50,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2866
03:12:51,455 --> 03:12:52,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Up arrows.

2867
03:12:52,396 --> 03:12:53,457
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see enough of them.

2868
03:12:54,017 --> 03:12:54,817
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

2869
03:12:55,338 --> 03:12:59,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Do not underestimate the power of that hint.

2870
03:13:00,501 --> 03:13:04,123
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it might sound like there's going to be a song with music in it.

2871
03:13:04,203 --> 03:13:05,904
[SPEAKER_13]: No, this isn't actual hints.

2872
03:13:08,174 --> 03:13:08,895
[SPEAKER_02]: With up arrows.

2873
03:13:08,935 --> 03:13:09,876
[SPEAKER_13]: With up arrows.

2874
03:13:10,637 --> 03:13:12,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And we like up arrows, don't we?

2875
03:13:12,498 --> 03:13:18,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I have to say I'm partial to the right arrow or the right diagonal on Solo.

2876
03:13:19,426 --> 03:13:22,469
[SPEAKER_09]: One more thing, you guys, Extreme's coming soon.

2877
03:13:22,889 --> 03:13:24,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, please don't forget about Ultramix 2.

2878
03:13:25,252 --> 03:13:26,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It is awesome.

2879
03:13:26,733 --> 03:13:29,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been... We didn't get a chance to talk about that much tonight, but... I have been...

2880
03:13:31,786 --> 03:13:33,247
[SPEAKER_09]: To do with Ultramix 2.

2881
03:13:33,587 --> 03:13:36,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some things that are pretty awesome.

2882
03:13:37,390 --> 03:13:44,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't forget, it's already been mentioned, that there are only a few old Konami originals that will be in Ultramix 2.

2883
03:13:44,855 --> 03:13:47,937
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest, you know what, it's awesome.

2884
03:13:48,337 --> 03:13:52,320
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I heard the other day, and they were talking about this, they're changing up the $50 bills.

2885
03:13:53,121 --> 03:13:55,242
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to be a mighty fine dollar when that comes out.

2886
03:13:55,882 --> 03:14:00,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you know what, I would just be like, boom boom dollar KOGG3 about that.

2887
03:14:02,737 --> 03:14:05,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, fine, that's a little blatant, but... I did it before.

2888
03:14:06,059 --> 03:14:07,120
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

2889
03:14:08,281 --> 03:14:08,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

2890
03:14:10,102 --> 03:14:15,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, tonight for our post-show, enjoy this marathon of music from 2DX.
