44073	47615	He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.
48395	51277	Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.
51697	52517	Hamburgers!

87571	89736	Any time, any place, baby.
90197	91100	Ow, my foot!
91581	93446	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
97799	104502	We are live, and this is episode number 105 for this Sunday, August 1st, 2004.
104803	113227	You're tuned in to the B-Mani-themed, most strip-poker-playing radio station of all things B-Mani.
113907	114728	My name is Rob Roberts.
114788	115868	You might know me as Sky.
116168	118149	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
118549	121091	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.
121111	123512	You know her better as the angsty Dark Sakura.
127904	129885	I'm powered by meat and asparagus right now.
131246	132167	Meat and potatoes.
132327	132708	Oh, I'm sorry.
132748	133548	Meat and asparagus.
133688	134749	Yeah, meat and asparagus.
134789	135710	Potatoes are evil.
137051	137431	Evil!
137531	138792	Are you on a low-carb diet?
138952	139412	Yes, I am.
139452	141254	Low-carb diets are the antichrist.
141534	142775	You know why they're the antichrist?
143757	146499	Okay, first of all, I'm doing this to be supportive.
147139	155644	I know, but... And second of all, you know how hard I've worked my ass off, so don't... Yes, I know, but they're the Antichrist for me, because anything that says that I can't have bread and potatoes is the Antichrist.
156284	157224	You can still have bread and potatoes.
157244	157965	Those are the two best foods ever.
157985	158605	Just not all the time.
159846	161367	But I want potatoes all the time.
163688	165009	Don't take my potatoes away.
165109	165409	God.
166082	169944	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, I miss doing that.

674203	675303	Yeah.
677064	677384	Because...
678226	682648	Because Hot August Nights is this month, which I'm going to actually think I'm going to get to go to this month.
684269	687850	Yeah, having Hot August Nights in August would be... But I don't think they have that at other places.
689131	692092	I don't think, yeah, they probably don't have it at other, it's a big thing they do in Reno.
692192	694173	I don't, oh, the term I've heard before.
694774	696494	Well, yeah, the term, but... It's from the 50s.
696514	697635	I'm going to go look at cars.
699216	699776	Old cars.
700056	701737	That's such a white trash event, though.
702117	705238	It's the same weekend as Trucker Fest.
705258	706179	Muscle cars are sexy.
708270	710832	My work sponsors Hot August Nights.
712393	713654	Muscle cars are sexy.
713955	714175	What?
714315	715376	Muscle cars are sexy.
717237	718258	You like little dick cars?
719719	721500	No, little dick cars and SUV, Rob.
723642	723942	All right.
725863	727425	Also known as Mommy Mobile.
727985	728826	Soccer Mom Mobile.
729086	729426	Yeah.
729746	730046	All right.
730867	731367	We are here.
731548	734530	I was out last week, as you may have heard.
734910	735470	No!
736071	738693	No, I was here two shows ago.
739173	740834	I was here Sunday, but then I flew out Monday.
741194	743156	And I can tell you guys where I went now, because I'm not there now.
743216	748339	I went to a little place in Pennsylvania called Allentown, and there's really not a whole lot there.
749580	755944	I guess there is, like, arcades and stuff, but I was so consumed with my work that I honestly had no time to go out and look.
757645	768211	I ended up buying Sword of Mana, which, eh, it's okay.
768471	775175	I was a little bit disappointed, because Secret of Mana is one of the best games ever, and then Sword of Mana being kind of, eh, is a little disappointing.
776456	780598	But then I also bought Mario vs. Donkey Kong, which was, you know, it's corny.
780779	781399	It's what you'd expect.
782407	785930	One thing I would like to say to Panda, I don't think he had a choice.
787691	787911	What?
788311	788692	With what?
788732	790353	That you should have gone to Maryland instead.
790553	793835	Oh, you're talking about our chat room at orangewatchradio.com.
793855	794336	Click on chat.
794856	795757	Yes, nice plug.
796017	796437	Yeah, I know.
797658	798599	Yeah, no, I didn't have a choice.
798659	800540	They sent me where they tell me to send me.
800600	801741	They say, bitch, you're going to go here.
801761	803122	And I'm like, yeah, okay, don't fire me.
806004	809407	Anyway, I figure we will start off tonight's show as we always start off our shows.
809767	811348	We'll be playing a little bit of How Was Your Week?
811960	812820	How was your day?
812940	815001	And Jamie, you've got the other mic, so why don't you start us off?
815021	816202	I have a mouthful of beef.
816982	817342	That's good.
817362	817963	Beef is good for you.
817983	820624	Do you like meat in your mouth?
820704	821784	Do you like having meat in your mouth?
822124	822564	Or meat?
823445	824005	It's juicy.
827306	828387	Sorry, I had to slow that piece down.
829287	832569	You should suck out the flavor a little bit before you bite down on it.
833589	834469	I'll just take the whole thing.
834650	834950	Alright.
836790	837671	My week sucked.
838551	839031	It was hot.
839472	840432	I don't have an AC in my car.
841112	842472	Busy as hell at work.
843092	844073	And it's going to get busier.
845213	848993	I finally got this stupid financial aid notice from ARC.
849153	850254	And you know what I have to say?
851014	856475	I have to say that I'm actually very surprised I was awarded my federal loans, which means I won't have any interest on them.
856935	857775	So that makes me happy.
859095	859435	Good deal.
859835	862636	I'm getting, I don't mind saying, I'm getting, because I'm a sophomore, I'll get $3,500.
862856	868577	And I don't mind saying so because it's like damn near what everybody gets if you're a sophomore, so it doesn't matter.
869713	871234	That means I get my laptop in two weeks.
872895	876036	In two weeks, I will be sitting here with a shiny Fujitsu on my lap.
876056	877417	I want a laptop.
878057	880259	Especially after that trip, I need a laptop.
880279	881019	They're expensive.
881039	881639	I can't afford them.
881979	882720	Go to school.
883460	885861	I need to buy a used one.
886802	888643	I only want one that will let me on the internet.
888683	889263	I don't need any.
890324	892465	I know I'm actually thinking about getting a Mac laptop.
892505	893145	Isn't that scary?
893966	894266	Evil.
894566	895526	Quit giving me bad looks.
895747	896087	Stop it.
896187	896467	All of you.
899588	902549	First you start with the Xbox and now you're going to... How was my week?
902589	903449	How was my day?
903849	904049	What?
904269	904929	How was my week?
905109	905869	Yeah, how was your week?
905889	906549	How was your day?
907330	913031	Well, I ended up going to see on Friday, because one of my friends is moving back to Utah.
914071	916691	We ended up going to see The Village that night.
917452	920092	And I don't care what anybody says, that movie was awesome.
921592	922052	Excuse me.
922072	924673	I love the political aspect of it.
926175	928376	I like the whole premise behind it.
929156	929936	I love the setting.
930676	932697	I like how everybody talks in that movie.
933537	936477	Everybody just talks like, I just like it.
936617	937058	I like it.
937698	942359	I'm not going to give away anything because, of course, it's one of those, you know, twisty movies.
943019	945220	But I'm not going to say anything about it.
945280	947460	I just really, I love the whole color theme.
947540	949160	I like the way this guy directs.
949981	954762	And the movies are slow, but all the pacing makes sense at the end of the movie.
954782	955782	So I thought it was really well done.
956397	957779	Two snaps up from Jamie?
958419	960401	It gets the Artsy Award from me.
960562	960902	Alright.
962304	963705	And what did I do yesterday?
965587	973356	Yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl all day and we over the cat.
974377	975138	Her cat passed away.
977120	977821	Yeah, I'm sad.
978649	979609	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1002012	1004875	It was actually filling without the great tape.
1004895	1005395	Oh, I see.
1005976	1006617	It was okay.
1008779	1011301	And then I spent the whole rest of the night online.
1012382	1021972	And then today I got up bright and early, read my errands, got myself my comics today, read them all, devoured them, bought a Dragon Ash CD,
1022992	1023192	Oh, cool.
1023232	1024313	Because I love Dragon Ash.
1025413	1028595	And Bumper Sticker is the best one ever.
1029435	1031676	It says, stop whining and plot revenge.
1033537	1034598	Is that not me or what?
1034738	1035658	That's pretty you.
1036439	1039320	And that's me.
1039800	1040201	My week.
1040461	1040821	Alrighty.
1041291	1041911	Suck-O-Rama
1058533	1059213	Well, you know what?
1059373	1061174	I know a deaf whore, so I win.
1062035	1063096	I know one.
1064156	1065377	Did you sleep with one, though?
1065437	1069119	No, I was at the 7-Eleven, and this heroine whore came in.
1069599	1071480	She had band-aids on her inner thigh.
1075362	1076543	Yeah, she was a whore.
1076583	1077964	She was a real whore.
1078184	1080845	Of course, we were right next to the Regency Triple X Theater.
1081085	1081686	Well, there you go.
1081946	1082126	So...
1085273	1086633	How long have you lived in Sacramento?
1086653	1089494	The theater was right across from where I used to work.
1089554	1093616	And the guys in the collections department would leave during their lunch break and go over there and watch porn.
1093636	1094316	Wait a minute, Loki.
1094916	1097057	How many years have you lived in Sacramento?
1098258	1098738	A lot.
1099398	1105241	And you just now learned that there is a place over on Watt that shows XXX films all day, all night?
1105261	1106641	No, I didn't know that.
1107041	1107742	You don't know what's funny?
1108262	1111083	When the whole April Fool's thing was going on DDR Freak?
1112582	1115704	and we had the thread there listing our address and contact information.
1116164	1118626	My address on there was the address for the Regency XXX Theater.
1120267	1122388	You know there's some news about DDR Freak Forums today.
1122948	1123269	Are there?
1123429	1125550	Yeah, you guys made something awful.
1125710	1128812	Dot coms make fun of lists today or whatever they call it.
1129572	1130633	It's okay, it's not my page.
1131814	1133755	Yeah, there were no posts from you in there so you're okay.
1134515	1136396	Okay, me, me now.
1136637	1137237	Okay, sorry.
1138177	1139098	Sorry, Garrett.
1139198	1139738	That's alright.
1140179	1140619	Um, well...
1141277	1145440	Last week was kind of slow, but I made the best of it.
1145520	1149923	My parents were out on vacation, and I only got 24 hours at work, so I had four days off.
1151104	1155127	And only managed to go crazy on two days, and the rest I filled with stuff.
1156328	1158950	And I had a pretty good time on most of the days.
1159050	1162192	I met someone new that I'm interested in, and
1163004	1166726	And then I found out the bad news that I was hoping to find out sooner than later.
1167467	1170549	And hopefully it won't totally fuck everything up, but we'll see.
1170869	1173911	I just have to stop being obsessive and something.
1175472	1179494	And then I had my party on Friday, and that was really fun.
1179674	1182696	And I got really, really, really wasted.
1183397	1188200	I have never been drunk, really, before now that I was that drunk.
1188280	1189841	And I go, wow, okay, this is drunk.
1189901	1191802	Which Orange Lounge regular showed up to the party?
1193125	1201995	Um, there was Brad, Irene, Matt, and Anita, and then, um, Janae and James, the guy I met.
1202055	1202776	Oh, okay, okay.
1203016	1214889	Yeah, um, and that was it, we had fun, and people that, I don't think Brad and Irene took off till like, well, all of them pretty much left around like 3.30 or so in the morning, so that was...
1215347	1215888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1227196	1231359	Keep in mind, chatters, I'm kind of new to alcohol, so I don't know all these things.
1231559	1232279	I am naive.
1232359	1235101	Most of our chatters can't even buy alcohol.
1235541	1236802	It doesn't mean they can't get it.
1238082	1239403	Who says anything about buying?
1239663	1241624	Not that we would condone that.
1241784	1242645	Of course not.
1243105	1244886	Don't drive.
1245086	1255412	My fingers were about 25% numb, and at that time I decided we needed to play drunk 2DX and poppin' music, and I still managed to beat Murmur Twins drunk.
1256312	1264135	and I think I got as high as like a 31 on pop and music but then I tried a 39 right after that and I just stopped so I don't know, I probably ended up higher.
1266516	1273860	It reminds me of the time I played DDR in Vegas and I was drunk, really, really drunk and I got like a huge crowd around me while I was playing though, it was cool.
1274160	1280723	Cool, and then now I'm, like as of yesterday, I am officially on vacation for this whole week and I'm still trying to remember that I'm on vacation.
1280743	1283204	Wait a minute, weren't you just on vacation like two months ago?
1283784	1284004	Yeah.
1284024	1284104	Yeah.
1285199	1286740	You're always on vacation.
1286880	1288080	I only get two weeks a year.
1290161	1292182	I just decided to take it now.
1295683	1305567	Well, I mean, we usually don't get to pick our vacation until... Shit, I didn't get to pick mine until after March, I don't think.
1306208	1307968	And then we have to use it before November.
1310029	1311530	It's weird the way it works.
1312030	1314131	But yeah, I took it now, I'm on vacation.
1314982	1339280	and I hope I find something good to do this week and oh yeah and then I got all the I got all those wonderful CDs and I spent way too much money on my newfound collections that I got in the mail all week and then yesterday my sister was a bitch when my CDs came because I had to go take Janae to work and then I come back and I see the mailman like on one part of our street like but like you know his car is pointing the direction like he would have had to pass mine
1339642	1342303	I'm all, oh, I wonder, because I haven't checked my tracking number.
1342623	1347646	I go home, check my tracking number, it says, your item arrived in Sacramento at 5.30 a.m.
1347806	1348126	today.
1348686	1353028	I'm like, wait a minute, that means he would have come to my house already if his car's pointed in that direction.
1353308	1355069	So I'm all, hey, Shannon, did the mailman come?
1355089	1358211	She's all, yeah, but I didn't have any clothes on, so I didn't go get it.
1360092	1386011	and she's upstairs laying in my parents' room naked in all of my comforters and blankets that I left in there from when I was sleeping in there in the week because she was gone camping with my parents so I'm all, you bitch and then so I go running outside and I'm going to go hunt for the mailman in my neighborhood because I hate waiting for it another day or going to the mail or to the post office and then I get in my car and then all of a sudden he's on the other side of my street so I get back out of my car and run across the street
1386451	1391494	And then, you know, I see him... Chasing a mailman for some CDs.
1391534	1395516	Yeah, I see him like at least three or four times a month.
1396537	1398918	And it's always him.
1399278	1403801	And then I'm running up to him and he's looking at me like, why is he coming towards me?
1404041	1406002	And, you know, like there's any other reason.
1406062	1407043	He knows who the fuck I am.
1407788	1411809	And then I'm all, hey, you know, my sister said, you know, can't you just say, oh, I haven't come yet.
1412309	1413929	I'm all, he's all, oh, no, I have.
1413989	1414430	Okay, yeah.
1414910	1416110	And then he gives him my thing.
1416990	1419131	And so, yeah, I got, yeah, I got stuff.
1419791	1420111	All right.
1420371	1420711	Right on.
1421111	1421371	Yeah.
1422311	1422611	I think.
1423712	1425152	Is there anything else from your week in your day?
1426152	1427132	Well, no, I just wanted to say that.
1428233	1429473	No, I don't remember what I was going to say.
1431834	1433055	The Jaffro Sachs Remix Album
1451423	1457687	And it was so bad that, okay, like, I was trying to just listen to it while I was kind of napping, but I wasn't really sleepy, I was just laying on my bed.
1458327	1463911	I listened to about half the album while I was on my bed, and then I went to my computer, turned it off, and continued to go back to bed.
1464371	1466412	Did you ever figure out what his connection to Bomani was?
1466652	1467593	No, I still haven't.
1468513	1469854	Sana did one song with him.
1470655	1479340	On this remix album, what was it, Hiroshi Watanabe did a remix, and that was a Bomani artist for like 5K a long time ago.
1480474	1481495	I have no idea who he is
1510513	1513234	I'm the lazy bastard.
1513394	1513954	How was your day?
1514034	1515014	How was your week?
1542317	1550345	Um, well, uh, let's see, this week I didn't do much, I played a lot of games on my main cabinet, because I have to get the money's worth out of it.
1550685	1558232	So, by the way, I figure it, I will have to play until I die on this cabinet to get the money's worth.
1558972	1566159	Um, anyways, so, I went down, um, what was it, yesterday, we were looking for stuff to do, so...
1566559	1569740	We went down to Golf Land to go play miniature golf.
1570380	1572021	That's when we discovered, guess what?
1572141	1574961	Now they have night... What was it?
1575081	1576202	Night swims or whatever.
1576822	1579323	It's basically water slides in the dark.
1580303	1581483	So they have that there now.
1581523	1583064	So there's a ton of fucking people.
1583084	1585844	The line was like zigzagging just to get into golf.
1585924	1586885	I'm like, fuck this.
1587025	1587505	I'm leaving.
1588285	1590726	But at least I got to see what condition everything was.
1591346	1594847	And the fourth mixer, Extreme 2 Cabinet...
1595567	1597368	Not working still, and you know what?
1597528	1598168	Don't care.
1600449	1604731	Drum Mania seemed to be okay, and Guitar Freaks was okay, I guess.
1606491	1610053	Then we decided to go see The Village, and The Village was okay.
1610973	1615335	But I already knew what the plot twist was about halfway through the film anyways, so...
1616597	1617738	Whatever.
1618539	1619279	So that was alright.
1620060	1622641	But you know what movie is going to rock?
1622762	1623842	It's his next movie.
1625123	1628145	It's going to be The Sixth Sign of the Unbreakable Village.
1628966	1630067	Look for that in theaters.
1630087	1630067	2006.
1630187	1632528	It's going to rock.
1632689	1634490	It's going to combine everything that was awesome.
1635591	1638473	It's going to be a village of super humans that can see dead aliens.
1640194	1640814	It's going to rock.
1643997	1645037	You used to be funny.
1645157	1645718	What happened?
1647099	1647559	You left.
1650840	1655741	So anyways, it's funny that you should mention a crack whore, Jamie, because I did see one earlier today.
1656901	1658221	Whatever, it's the same shit.
1658422	1666203	I mean, I guess, okay, maybe she didn't have a bloody nose and she just had less track lines or whatever, but whatever.
1666223	1673685	It's still the stupid bitch, I'll get into it later, I guess, in the FUs, but anyway, some stupid bitch tried to cut me off and I flipped her off and that was fun.
1674425	1676147	Harry Camargo, White Castle
1696144	1699387	And what is your favorite adult-oriented arcade game that you've come across?
1699867	1703251	Oh, of course, this was before I even got maimed, Gals Panic, it rocks.
1704592	1705893	I'm awesome at Gals Panic.
1706774	1712659	But then I was playing, I beat the stupid, was it that Poker Gals or whatever?
1713120	1714281	It's stupid.
1714421	1717163	It's kind of disturbing watching them masturbate with like a...
1718044	1718905	Wait, wait.
1718925	1720046	You mean John Waters?
1720346	1720586	Uh, maybe.
1742762	1744963	It's about fucking time John Waters came out with a new movie.
1745023	1751867	It better be good, though, because, like, his movies, like, ever since Serial Mom, like, Serial Mom was the shit, and then, like, what was after that?
1751887	1757830	It was, um, not, no, no, no, no, after that was, there was, Cecil B. Demented was one.
1758651	1759811	I thought there was one in between, though.
1759831	1763153	I might be, I might be losing, but, like, Cecil B. Demented was, like, kind of, like, eh.
1763173	1764794	It was just eh.
1765305	1765845	Oh, Pekker!
1766085	1766906	I was in between there, too.
1766946	1768026	Pekker was kinda, eh.
1768486	1770567	And then, like, Cecil B. DiMena was even more, eh.
1770847	1772367	So he needs to, you know, come back up.
1772647	1774248	Like, Pink Flamingos, too, man.
1774308	1774788	I'm telling you.
1775128	1776529	Even if Divine's dead, I don't care.
1776549	1783631	Anyways, it's about these bunch of perverts that go into this one town, and then everyone starts getting perverted and having sex with one another and stuff like that.
1784031	1790513	But there's, like, one specific scene that I remember where this lady is, like, doing, like, some sort of dance or hokey-pokey type thing.
1791073	1792894	And she's staring at this, like, um...
1794307	1795188	One doctor there.
1795228	1799532	I guess like these people are getting injured in the head or something like that and they turn all horny.
1799912	1805717	Same way as she ends up setting down a water bottle and squatting over it and shoving it up her cooch.
1805817	1807759	So that was, that was interesting.
1808840	1811822	Yes, I'm looking at an internet movie database right now.
1811862	1815705	It is A Dirty Shame is done by John Waters, which means I will have to see it.
1816906	1819769	Even if I fucking hate Johnny Knoxville, I will have to see this movie.
1821693	1822614	I'll watch it with you.
1823274	1824795	See, now, did you see what it was?
1826576	1832860	It was basically, um, it's when a bunch of head injuries are causing people to become sex addicts.
1833540	1836102	So, I thought, I think that's pretty funny.
1837263	1839304	So, can't wait.
1840024	1840585	I like that.
1840785	1841245	What was it?
1841425	1843767	Uh, Wes Johnson, Fat Fuck Frank.
1844527	1846829	This is all I care about is Mink Stole in it.
1847523	1850886	Because Mink Stoll is the greatest actress of all time.
1851127	1852068	I don't care what you say.
1852268	1855011	And she is in it, as she has been in all of John Waters' other movies.
1855331	1859255	Anyway, the video game nerds out there have no idea what I'm talking about right now, so I'm just going to let it go.
1860796	1861537	So anyways, that's all that.
1861577	1862318	That looked pretty sweet.
1862338	1866482	Other than that, not really much happening.
1866562	1869185	Just a little bit of Final Fantasy, not that much at all.
1869605	1871447	And just working on my cabinets.
1873416	1874817	That's pretty much it.
1877058	1881361	Anyways, how about your weeks?
1882542	1889027	Yeah, I was gone for a couple weeks in Pennsylvania, and to be honest, really not a whole lot of exciting stuff went down.
1890187	1895571	I did get a chance to have one of my friends visit me over the weekend, because she lives out on the East Coast.
1895611	1899373	She's somebody I knew from college, and we went out to New York City.
1899393	1901015	We kind of drove around some areas around there.
1901955	1909382	We found ourselves on Long Island eventually, and we went to Fire Island, which is this big gay haven out on the East Coast, for those that don't know.
1909883	1914427	But I don't know what possessed us to go there, but we were just like, oh, let's go to Fire Island.
1914808	1922695	So we did, and it was like a giant gay slumber party slash summer camp that I really didn't feel like I was invited to.
1922895	1924277	So, whatever.
1925678	1926899	Thank you for watching!
1926939	1927659	See you next time!
1941665	1946508	Yes, I got some... Well, yeah, because when you pay... You have to pay to go on the tour.
1947268	1953471	You have to pay to go on the little tour thing, and then you get little tokens that you can put in machines, and you get crayons and stuff.
1955032	1957713	I'll get out the crayons later, and we can draw on the walls.
1958754	1959054	Alright.
1959858	1961079	That was pretty much it, honestly.
1961139	1964861	I mean, I haven't been playing any video games except for what I was talking about earlier on Game Boy Advance.
1965561	1969804	There's only so many times I can beat Metroid Zero before I'm like, Jesus Christ, I need a new game.
1970384	1971385	So, that was it.
1971625	1978129	But then coming home was very interesting because the house, like coming back into the apartment at 4 o'clock in the morning, because Bugs picked me up at the airport.
1978669	1985613	After, by the way, my airplane in Philadelphia sat on the runway for an hour, and so finally it comes back and it sits in
1986013	1988555	We get to Vegas, and I was only supposed to have an hour layover in Vegas.
1988575	1990737	Well, now I have five minutes to get to my other plane.
1991137	1997102	So I ran from one end of the Vegas airport to the other end, and it was like being on The Amazing Race.
1997242	1998603	I swear, it was interesting.
1999544	2003347	But I just barely made my plane to Sacramento, and all was well.
2004628	2008191	And then Bug picked me up at the airport here in Sacramento, and then we went out.
2008612	2009973	We ended up meeting Evan...
2010693	2012275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2028155	2034417	So I came here, and then when I open the door and I walk in, I'm like, holy fucking shit, when did Loki finish his cabinet?
2034617	2041339	Because our TV's gone, and it's inside the cabinet, and then, like, the whole room has been turned around 90 degrees, or at least it feels that way.
2041659	2049441	And then, like, there's just all this stuff that used to be over here, like, piled up in piles on the side of the room, but I just thought it was cool.
2049461	2052682	And then Loki was showing his cabinet to me yesterday, and, uh...
2053542	2053682	MrWorld96
2084202	2113188	so they have this but if you I don't know if you uncover certain bad parts of the picture then your bar goes down and if you fall into the bad like the picture of the girl turns into a picture of like the devil and like it starts playing this Eurobeat song that totally doesn't match it goes like everybody move your body I'm gonna play it for you guys later because I think it's just that cool I'm gonna have to do that after the break but um I'm sorry yes Jamie you want to share something with us get get Jamie Mike here
2115928	2120232	Not that I'm meaning to interrupt, but Time Magazine is encouraging people to download movies off the Internet.
2120652	2121032	Like what?
2121713	2126797	I'm reading this article about how a lot of the horror movies from Japan are being remade for the U.S.
2127158	2127538	Oh, okay.
2127578	2131602	Like the original director for The Ring 2, well, for The Ring is doing A Ring 2 over here.
2131682	2134324	Right, and The Grudge is a Japanese movie.
2134704	2136146	Right, Ju-on was the name.
2136706	2140069	But it's saying that, it says, why wait for remakes?
2140149	2142051	All of these movies are available online.
2142071	2142431	Right.
2143922	2147146	They meant through Amazon.com or your favorite online retailer.
2149529	2150290	Yes, Loki.
2151231	2159040	I heard that the new Kashan movie is available on... Actually, I have it marked on Supernova, a cam of it, though.
2159360	2162824	But still, cam that's subtitled in English.
2163345	2164046	Good enough for me.
2167381	2176383	Speaking of all this Japanese culture stuff hitting the US, Loki and I had the pleasure of going to a small little convention, quote unquote.
2176423	2177043	I don't know what you got.
2177343	2178764	It wasn't quite a convention, it was a fair.
2179264	2187886	Like a fair with an E on it, like a renaissance fair, but it was an anime fair that they had at the mall here in Sacramento, which consisted of...
2188706	2190908	Four vendor booths scattered throughout the mall.
2191309	2196393	And then in what used to be McDonald's, they had a viewing room where they were showing crappy anime all day.
2196453	2198695	And I guess they were going to show live-action Sailor Moon at some point.
2198936	2199656	Yeah, Sunrise Mall.
2201478	2203860	Yeah, the McDonald's closed at Sunrise Mall about three years ago.
2203880	2206643	A couple months ago, okay.
2206983	2209125	Not quite three years ago, a couple months ago.
2209986	2210326	All right.
2211307	2212408	But still, it's closed.
2213294	2214655	And they were showing anime in there now.
2214715	2218398	The only cool thing they were going to show was today, but I'm not much of an anime geek.
2218438	2220479	I mean, maybe there was some good stuff in there and I just don't recognize it.
2220699	2222701	But they were going to show live action Sailor Moon today.
2223441	2224162	And that would have been cool.
2224382	2227564	But anyway, like, the vendor booths were not too thrilling.
2227684	2231887	But they were, like, it was really cool to go to the mall and see, like, all the soccer moms and the brats.
2232167	2233809	And then, like, all these cosplayers.
2234189	2237411	Like, there were, like, tons of people cosplaying as all these anime characters.
2237912	2238352	Not that...
2239508	2244390	Not that there were many good cosplayers, but there were, you know, a lot of cosplayers.
2245130	2255435	No offense to cosplayers out there, but why do the majority, not all of them, but do the great majority of them have the really nasty, ugly, fat chicks?
2256495	2256876	Honestly.
2257116	2261498	I mean, I saw some really... It's like, oh my god, when did that character put on 100 pounds?
2263278	2266000	It's like, a blob has sucked her soul!
2267520	2268941	It was really nasty.
2270163	2281352	I only think that stuff is bad when they're cosplaying as Mai, or Chun-Li, or somebody really, you know, promiscuous.
2282653	2286997	Then there was that chick who was next to me, who I thought was a guy.
2287998	2289359	She looked like a dude.
2290680	2293182	And she opens her mouth, yeah, how much for this?
2293202	2295504	I'm like, oh my god, ugly!
2297205	2297946	And I started pointing.
2305221	2323308	I was just disappointed because usually at those kind of anime, even an anime expo, I'm not that into anime, I have an appreciation for some of it, like the big mainstream stuff like Miyazaki and stuff, but usually at most anime conventions, you have your video game corner, or you have your video game vendor, or something video game related, I was hoping to see that there.
2323928	2325109	Nope, not a damn thing.
2325129	2329131	The only thing video game related I could find that was interesting was the Final Fantasy XI wall scroll.
2329511	2334534	But it was just the generic stock art of the same thing that's on the cover of Final Fantasy XI.
2335194	2338676	It's the same art I've seen over and over and I have it in like a million different places anyway.
2338697	2345340	And I didn't want to spend $15 on a wall scroll that looked like it was just a bad Xerox copy anyway.
2348082	2349663	So, that was our experience at the...
2350885	2355629	I'm actually surprised you didn't go, Jamie, just to check it out or you heard about it or anything.
2355709	2358232	Because that was the one they were promoting over at A1 Comics.
2358252	2358732	Which, oh, I didn't.
2375277	2375958	It was this one.
2375978	2377080	Do we have the little flyer here?
2377220	2378342	Oh, I remember the flyer.
2378482	2381246	I just threw my flyer away and said, eh.
2382768	2383750	I had other things to do.
2384330	2385512	Like laundry.
2386133	2386474	Yeah.
2387675	2388677	But it was Saturday, right?
2390726	2391988	It was Saturday and today.
2392008	2393089	It's still going on right now.
2393109	2393750	I was doing things.
2393810	2397995	I remember I had to be over at Iguana Golf Course.
2398015	2400438	You were being support.
2401219	2408367	I feel sorry for anybody that was coming from like, according to this, they give in directions from Reno or South Lake Tahoe.
2409992	2412734	What anime do they ever do in Reno or South Lake Tahoe?
2412754	2414354	Do they ever have festivals like this up there?
2414495	2415335	I highly doubt that.
2415355	2418336	Go to a comic shop, you'll see more anime than there was at this place.
2418356	2423499	Classic Gaming Expo was in Vegas, but... Classic Gaming Expo is in San Jose this year and I really want to go.
2423739	2424459	Is it next month?
2425180	2426180	It's like next weekend, isn't it?
2427081	2427501	I don't know.
2427541	2428621	I'm going to check that out right now.
2428641	2431002	Oh crap, if it's next weekend, then I'm going to the Ren Faire.
2431022	2432923	I already have plans to go to the Bay Area next weekend.
2433123	2434524	And next weekend I'm going to the Ren Faire.
2435725	2436205	Next Saturday.
2436225	2436305	Okay.
2437611	2439473	I'm going to the Bay Area to visit people next weekend.
2439494	2442377	Wait, I have to find out now when Classic Gaming Expo is, because I have to go.
2443759	2449386	Classic Gaming Expo, for those who don't know, is supposed to be like the most tremendously awesome, neat, old school thing.
2449506	2450488	Ooh, no, it's at the end of the month.
2450888	2451569	21st and 22nd.
2453652	2455895	No, I'm not, because I don't leave until September, motherfucker.
2456892	2460954	Well, I think I can skip my introduction to Windows class that day.
2461675	2463676	Okay, I have no time to go test out of this.
2463756	2465737	This is sort of an FU, but not really.
2466538	2469980	Because I'm going to try to make this an easy A to establish a good GPA.
2470000	2474122	Ooh, Jamie, SNK just joined as a sponsor of Classic Gaming Expo.
2474142	2476984	Ooh, SNK, we're out of business.com.
2478005	2479826	We no longer support the Neo Geo.
2479906	2480947	The last game is dead.
2482888	2484749	And Konami's going to have an exhibit today.
2485851	2489094	Yeah, they're going to do Castlevania, I hope.
2489474	2490375	Oh, right on.
2490455	2491355	Oh, I have to go to this.
2491736	2492536	I'm so going to this.
2495439	2498361	Maybe we can head to San Jose after my class.
2499622	2499942	Yeah.
2500062	2500923	I get out of my class at 4.
2501163	2504046	We'll have to find out what time everything's at.
2504826	2507108	Maybe we can broadcast from Classic Gaming Expo.
2507689	2511372	Yeah, maybe we should email them or something and figure out something we can do to promote stuff.
2511412	2514714	Even though we don't really do a whole lot of classic gaming, except for, you know...
2517454	2518915	You talk about it on your spin-off show.
2519235	2521416	Which, by the way, there's news about some of our spin-off shows.
2521536	2525639	Yes, because I'm starting school in two weeks.
2525739	2529761	Starting this Tuesday, Pump Up the Volume is moving back to Tuesday, so we can use the old promo again.
2530142	2530802	Right on, okay.
2531662	2533484	And, uh, I'm, uh...
2534841	2536662	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2566860	2570402	Okay, you know, somebody in the chat room just brought up a very good point.
2570422	2582789	Somebody in the chat room brought up a very good point that as far as us promoting classic gaming, we talk about BurgerTime, or at least I do, and I do a lot of promotion for BurgerTime, which I believe to be the greatest 80s video game.
2582869	2583329	Tappin'.
2584590	2584810	What?
2585170	2585571	Tappin'.
2585851	2586231	Tappin'?
2586651	2587772	Oh, Tapper.
2588212	2588672	Tapper.
2588872	2589233	That's it.
2589433	2590013	Rupert Tapper.
2590613	2592294	Which, the original one was like a beer game.
2593035	2595056	We have a lot of good classic gaming stuff to talk about on here.
2597626	2603023	and Tubin and Supersprint and
2604366	2604606	All right.
2605426	2606347	Geographic games.
2606507	2608587	So we're going to look into what we can do about Classic Gaming Expo.
2608607	2609808	Okay, I think we're going to take a break.
2610108	2613609	And when we come back, we actually have Bimani stuff we want to talk about, believe it or not.
2613969	2614909	And, of course, the cage match.
2614949	2615510	You have to use the week.
2615550	2617650	All that fun stuff very soon.
2618171	2621952	In the meantime, we're going to play you guys some new music from Pop and Music 11.
2623072	2626953	And our resident pop and music whore is here to tell us all about the songs we're going to hear today.
2627674	2629334	So what did you pick out for us?
2629594	2631295	Okay, well, I put on...
2631815	2637417	He said three songs, so I picked songs that were not hosted on the Mani style, so they're songs you may not have heard.
2637977	2639157	So that's why I started with this.
2639518	2648961	The first one is, the genre is Nebuta, but the song is actually called Karasu instead of Tori.
2649041	2656103	I actually got really curious when the song was reading the info on the page at the official site, and it's supposed to mean crows.
2656471	2661876	Not birds, like generically like that, because it just has a kanji for bird, and most people would read it as tori.
2662556	2663277	So there's that.
2663517	2671744	I also put on the remix for Yokan Ko, the Death's Reggae song from 7, which I actually like, even though it's really minimal.
2672105	2678730	And then there's another song called, what was that, Tozancha Tachi, and...
2679730	2685174	It sounds kind of like an anime song to me, but it's actually an original song that the guy from the Parkettes made.
2685895	2686335	So yeah.
2686515	2687356	Alright, cool deal.
2687436	2694161	So this is the premiere of some Poppin' 11 music here on Orange Lounge Radio, and thank you very much for bringing this to us.
2694241	2694702	You're welcome.
2694902	2695622	Alright, here we go.
2695642	2697904	We're going to start off with Karasu.
2698485	2698705	Enjoy.
2802472	2803294	Thank you for watching!
2844585	2845851	Thanks for watching!

2976906	2977247	Yeah!
2977287	2977567	Yeah!
3004893	3008074	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
3008374	3010495	No!
3010655	3011296	Just kidding.
3011736	3012776	Orange Lounge Radio.
3012856	3014457	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
3015577	3016117	That's right.
3016197	3017038	All crap-free.
3017098	3020679	Except for this show, which you're tuned into here on this lovely Sunday evening.
3021259	3025081	As promised, I wanted to walk over to the main cabinet and play this game for you guys.
3025461	3028042	This is called Miss Mr. World 96 Nude.
3028242	3029823	And if you want to see...
3030714	3039682	If you want to see screenshots of this game, head on over to OrangeLaunchRadio.com because it's playing live right now on our webcam there.
3039902	3044666	And even though it doesn't auto refresh right now, you have to click reload every 30 seconds or so.
3045486	3047608	We're working on getting that fixed, at least for next week.
3049938	3057383	Also, later this program, we'll be opening up the Skype line for your comments over at www.orangesponsorator.com.
3057944	3061766	Look for our recent news article on Skype, and it'll tell you how to set it up.
3061846	3063988	Also, in our LiveJournal community, there's a recent post there.
3064949	3070232	So, we're going to try to get the sound, because I wanted to play the evil song for you guys, but Loki's still working on sound.
3070573	3070773	Yes?
3071053	3071773	I'm a host.
3071793	3072374	Give me my phone.
3072474	3072994	Yes, Jamie.
3074956	3076156	I saw asses.
3081424	3106005	I'm sorry, I'm not a ho There's a really lopsided lump of an outline of a penis on the screen right now But see, if you trace around the penis Like, see, watch If the little character traces around the penis Then you get to see it Oh, some of the ROMs are corrupt So some of the pictures don't work right But it's kind of a fucked up game I see more asses We're gonna see if Loki can get it hooked up I'm gonna start a game here
3107065	3110546	and hopefully we can get the sound over and Jamie will tell you all what's going on here.
3111467	3111667	Oops.
3111807	3113627	Rob is playing with the dip switches.
3115248	3115788	Hold on here.
3119289	3122210	Okay, the little line thing looks like a really stupid Pac-Man, but not.
3124271	3125471	How do I insert coins?
3128492	3129212	Up at the top, Rob.
3129373	3129793	There we go.
3133054	3135655	It's not two player at the same time, so it kind of sucks.
3136295	3136575	Alright.
3140046	3140827	Shit, I quit out!
3140887	3141867	Dammit, I hit the wrong button.
3142268	3143288	That was special, Rob.
3144189	3144950	I'm very proud of you.
3145110	3146331	This is wonderful radio right now.
3147512	3148252	Any luck on the sound?
3148272	3149873	I'm working on it.
3149893	3150574	Loki's working on it.
3150954	3153016	We could do a different topic and then come back to this, I guess.
3153776	3157159	I now need to announce that I suck at R-Type.
3158920	3160221	I used to be okay at R-Type.
3160661	3162863	My fiance is like a god at R-Type.
3164861	3166041	That's like me and DDR.
3166181	3169202	I used to be really good at DDR, but I honestly have not played DDR in a month.
3170243	3173564	Yeah, I'm going to play this for the chat room so you can hear how bad I suck.
3173604	3173864	Got it?
3173984	3174684	So we hear the sound now?
3184047	3184507	Oh, you will.
3184547	3185807	Oh, I'm hearing Jamie's game.
3185827	3187888	Hold on, take the mic away from that for a minute.
3187928	3188408	This is our type.
3188428	3188988	Can we hear this?
3189188	3190989	Hold on, if I put the coins in and do it.
3202298	3202758	Can I hear it?
3205539	3206180	No, we don't hear it.
3210742	3213823	Okay, I'm going to see... Does it work if I hold the mic up here?
3218745	3219925	Okay, we'll hold the mic up there.
3223747	3224147	Here we go.
3225668	3227188	I'm going to try and get to the evil stuff.
3227208	3228549	See, I'll trace around the penis first.
3234890	3235530	Oops, I died.
3243635	3244896	See, I got a penis, look.
3245596	3247037	Okay, now I'm going to try and make it go bad.
3253621	3255082	I'm trying very hard here to get there.
3256402	3260565	Go to the techno song, don't choke up on me on air here.
3264679	3265019	I died.
3265279	3265520	Again.
3267681	3269022	There we go.
3269042	3269322	Oh, almost.
3269342	3269482	Shit.
3269522	3270263	I died again.
3270283	3270903	Damn this game!
3298541	3299141	Yeah, here it goes.
3299361	3299662	Here it goes.
3303024	3304325	Aw, shit, it froze up!
3305466	3305966	Fuck!
3307047	3307987	Fuck your cabinet.
3308107	3308568	Fuck this.
3308988	3310349	Let me do this shit.
3310609	3311670	I gotta do it the right way.
3312270	3321036	You gotta play this game, because... God damn it.
3321176	3322517	What happened to all my controls?
3322557	3323398	What did you guys do here?
3324577	3326157	Loki is going to try to get that to work.
3326197	3331079	In the meantime, I'm going to want to tell you guys about some general gaming news that's going on out there.
3335099	3345002	I don't know if you guys heard about this, but WarioWare 2 is going to be coming out soon, which is kind of exciting for those of us who have video game attention deficit disorder.
3345722	3350223	WarioWare is a great game to have because you're the only one who'll stare back.
3351540	3354742	They're going to be coming out with this WarioWare 2, which should be exciting.
3355563	3357344	I know that they're going to have one on the DS, too.
3357364	3358845	I don't know if this is the DS version.
3358945	3359545	I don't think it is.
3359965	3361406	But they are going to have that coming out.
3362347	3365769	Also, it's updated on our website, www.orangetownsradio.com.
3365809	3370092	Speaking of the Nintendo DS, Square Enix has been doing...
3371018	3374019	Everybody moves our body Everybody moves our body Everybody moves our body
3403797	3405477	I'm going to make a DWI of that.
3406017	3407158	That's an awesome song.
3407478	3408318	Wasn't that worth it?
3408358	3412078	Wasn't that worth that wait of like 10 minutes of train wreck radio to hear that little sample?
3412158	3412419	Alright.
3413479	3414199	Anyway, moving on.
3415079	3422220	If you want to vote on the Squeenix survey for what game should they port over to the Nintendo DS, head on over to our website, orangeonstrider.com.
3422260	3424361	It's a very recent story we have on the site.
3425141	3429302	Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater, some new screenshots have been revealed.
3430462	3431802	I'm sorry, what did you say about that, Jamie?
3434500	3435561	That game makes me hot.
3464844	3466705	The minimum requirements for Doom 3 were announced
3483956	3489899	You have to have a 1.5 GHz Pentium 4 chip or an AMD Athlon 1500.
3490800	3493681	So you have to have a 1.5 something to play it.
3493981	3497103	You have to have at least 384 megabits of RAM, which isn't that hard.
3497283	3497683	Megabytes.
3497883	3498283	Megabytes.
3498764	3505927	And 2 gigs of hard drive space and of course an Nvidia GeForce 3 or an ATI 8500 graphics card.
3505947	3511310	But fear not, if you don't have a computer good enough to play it, get an Xbox because it's going to be coming out on Xbox as well.
3512691	3512971	Alright.
3515034	3517635	So that's what's going on in the gaming world right now.
3518116	3525600	I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if anybody has a comment on something we've been talking about so far this show.
3527521	3532983	I would like to hear about your favorite adult-oriented arcade game, actually, was something I'd like to hear about.
3533404	3535645	But see, Custer's Revenge wasn't an arcade game.
3539011	3540032	You need to get a mic, Jamie.
3540052	3541093	You need to get mic'd up there.
3542354	3547638	Also, if you want to talk about something going on in gaming news, we got that opened up for you.
3550120	3554263	Our chat room wants to know who that is on our webcam right now on OrangeLaunchRadio.com with the iBook.
3554783	3557545	And that is our wonderful Bugged is there.
3558206	3560408	Did you know that for our webcam... Oh, we got a call.
3560448	3561468	Let's take the call.
3562929	3564471	OrangeLaunchRadio, you are on the air.
3564491	3566132	Hello, Sky.
3566432	3566913	Siggy here.
3567513	3567993	Hey, Siggy.
3568013	3568494	How you doing?
3569466	3570227	I'm doing fine.
3570767	3574191	Yes, what is your favorite adult-oriented arcade game ever?
3574391	3580276	Well, honestly, I've never played any kind of adult-oriented video arcade game.
3580416	3583159	Ah, so you stick to just your basic pornography.
3584080	3585081	Um, not really.
3585121	3586002	Yeah, sort of.
3586022	3586842	Okay, alright, yeah.
3588317	3589278	It's all right, we're all friends.
3589638	3590938	All right, so what are you calling about then?
3591539	3595160	Well, I got some latest news in the local Las Vegas-Bimani scene.
3595421	3597201	Ooh, Las Vegas-Bimani scene news.
3597522	3599803	You know I was in Vegas for five minutes this week?
3600843	3602224	Yeah, the McCarran Airport, huh?
3602464	3602704	Yep.
3603345	3608947	I ran all the way from Terminal A, one end of Terminal A, all the way to the other end of Terminal B in five minutes.
3609167	3610808	Oh, yeah, that's a quite far run.
3612289	3613270	I impressed myself.
3613890	3616051	All right, so what's up in the Las Vegas-Bimani scene?
3616727	3622531	As of last Thursday, the Orleans Hotel and Casino has got Easy to Dance, her second move.
3622991	3626033	And her third mix from Suncoast.
3627173	3627834	Where in New Orleans?
3628254	3629175	No, no, just Las Vegas.
3629195	3630395	The New Orleans Hotel and Casino.
3631216	3633537	It's the New Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
3633557	3636059	Because, you know, they have little bits of America all over Vegas.
3636599	3641823	Yeah, it's far away from the strip, so... So a lot of people have been over there playing it?
3642683	3645605	Well, I don't... You know, yesterday I went there.
3647768	3650851	I went there yesterday, just to, you know, celebrate my 25 years.
3652372	3654233	Oh, happy birthday, by the way, from Orange Lounge Radio.
3654954	3655334	Thank you.
3656455	3662640	I played it for the first time, and it was really hard, because, you know, it only has one judgment, you know, which is cool.
3662720	3671707	I like the DDR, like, perfect, great, good, and... Agent's Dance's second move is only in one, which is, you know, which is complicated.
3672388	3672608	Huh.
3673829	3674309	Interesting.
3674409	3680691	And what's new about Easy to Dance, the second loop, is they have freezes, like freeze sensor and then freeze pad.
3681051	3683111	The Koreans love those freeze things.
3683151	3689673	I've seen it like in every knockoff of another Bomani game they have in Korea, they have a freeze something, like in Easy to DJ.
3690593	3690753	Oh.
3691213	3692633	But Easy to DJ rocks, it really does.
3693373	3693854	Ah, I see.
3694074	3694314	I see.
3694494	3694954	Yeah, and...
3696269	3700491	Circus Circus is not much fun to play, according to the Monty Locals here.
3700771	3703812	Circus Circus is my favorite hotel to stay at, though, because it's so fucking cheap.
3704573	3704953	Yeah.
3705753	3709635	I stayed there, you know, two Christmases ago.
3710015	3710996	Why would you... Before I moved here.
3711336	3715598	Oh, I was going to say, why would you stay in a hotel there when you lived there, but it was... Before I moved here.
3715738	3717018	I know, I would stay in a hotel.
3717158	3719779	Oh, by the way, Loki.
3720580	3721220	Yeah, Loki.
3721680	3721960	Yeah.
3721980	3725562	Oh, by the way, Loki, I suggest you should watch Superstar Club.
3726812	3727193	What now?
3727353	3727994	Suicide Club.
3728514	3729135	I've seen it!
3729716	3730076	I haven't.
3730096	3730737	You've seen it already?
3730917	3731918	Yeah, I haven't seen it.
3732599	3733520	Ha ha ha, yeah right.
3733820	3735883	They're doing blockbuster shelves right now.
3736444	3743632	You know, it's a Japanese movie about 54 schoolgirls committing suicide in a subway station.
3744273	3745875	That's not what the movie is about though.
3746516	3748237	Well, yeah, it's a mystery of suicide.
3748278	3750339	It's about J-pop and the evils of it.
3753262	3756184	It's about the evils of... Actually, there's a really awesome movie.
3756264	3759587	If anyone's seen Ichi the Killer, they're making Ichi the... Oh, I've seen that.
3759647	3760728	I've seen Ichi the Killer, actually.
3760748	3763090	They're making an anime version of Ichi the Killer.
3763110	3764912	That's going to be a prequel to it, I believe.
3764972	3766433	Yeah, I've seen the live version.
3767034	3772917	I haven't read the manga or watched the actual anime over the years.
3773037	3776199	There's also another movie called, I think, Three Monsters that's going to be coming out.
3776339	3783523	It's basically, I don't really know what it is, but they have a scene where they cut off some chick's fingers while she's playing the piano or something like that.
3783563	3783943	Lovely.
3785004	3785444	Yeah.
3786184	3790026	Alright, well we're going to go ahead and let you go, but thank you for calling in and letting us know what's going on here in the woods.
3790607	3791267	Alright, have a good one.
3792369	3793250	Be careful.
3793370	3793790	Watch that.
3793910	3795271	Ichi the Killer in moderation there.
3795711	3796291	Be careful there.
3796792	3797092	Alright.
3801094	3801394	Alright.
3801454	3802335	Skyblind's opened up.
3802355	3804096	We'll take another call if somebody wants to call in.
3805317	3811881	Otherwise, we'll probably... We'll probably move into some other Bomani news.
3814569	3820191	I hate it because I have all these... I know I'm going to mess up the pronunciation.
3820571	3822332	Mahjong?
3822572	3822932	Mahjong.
3823352	3825613	I have no idea how to play it and I have all these porno games of it.
3826013	3827113	You have to match the tiles.
3828474	3829294	Oh, that seems easy enough.
3830656	3831157	There's a 9 gig...
3859642	3859782	Ah!
3859802	3862363	There's a mic in my face.
3862483	3865104	Well, don't talk in this house without a microphone during the show.
3866645	3872347	Well, anyways, I was going to say, there was a 9 gigs zip that I was trying to download.
3872367	3874467	That was before we fixed our cable problem.
3875087	3876888	And so it wasn't downloading quite.
3877008	3879869	It was telling me I had like, you know, 4,000 hours left.
3879929	3880849	And I was like, fuck this.
3880909	3883150	You also need to get the Sailor Moon Final Fight game.
3883930	3885011	Sailor Moon Final Fight.
3885051	3886351	Let's see if we can find that.
3886371	3887211	It's kind of fun.
3887512	3888612	It's cheese ball.
3890635	3895363	I also have a personal request, because I noticed it wasn't on the machine, but you need to find me Ninja Gaiden, the arcade game.
3895664	3897847	Yeah, I need Ninja Gaiden.
3897887	3899229	You need Ninja Gaiden on there.
3899410	3900351	Soldier Sailor Moon?
3900552	3901353	I think that's it.
3901714	3901854	Okay.
3902463	3903063	All right, anyway.
3904004	3906525	Okay, we're not getting any calls over on Skype line, so I'm going to shut it off.
3906565	3907286	Yes, so screw you guys.
3907306	3907806	Yeah, screw you guys.
3907826	3908927	We're going to shut it off for a little bit.
3909767	3912409	We'll come back to it later, though, because I want to talk about some Bomani news.
3912529	3915211	I don't think you guys got to this last week, talking about Xtreme, right?
3915531	3917312	Do we ever talk about Bomani on the show?
3917332	3918653	What did you two guys talk about last week?
3918693	3920314	I haven't listened to this show yet.
3920394	3920814	Pinball.
3920834	3922195	We talked a lot about pinball, didn't we?
3922535	3923055	Pinball's awesome.
3923435	3930600	You know, I swear the guy that did Pin Mame, or one of his biggest promoters, is from Sacramento, because I've seen the car like three times now with the Pin Mame license plate.
3931861	3937267	The guy who runs this one really big download site does live in Carmichael, near me and Dan.
3938769	3939751	Oh, maybe that's it then.
3940071	3941773	Yeah, but we haven't talked to him or anything.
3942033	3942414	Interesting.
3943413	3951938	All right, so DDR Extreme, DDRSpot.com, we borrowed an article from them talking about the full song list was released.
3952979	3957021	Well, not the full song list, but the pre-unlocks song list was announced.
3957321	3959203	And a very wide mix of stuff.
3959323	3960944	So I'm going to run through this list real fast.
3961224	3963485	Konami Originals, you're going to see in DDR Extreme.
3963585	3971250	Firefly by B4U, Jeanne Jeanne, Jet World, Love Love Sugar, Mobile Moga, Paranoia Eternal, Pink Rose,
3971730	3972150	Doomie.
3972350	3979054	That was kind of a surprise to see that one when, you know, you say that there's the censors who may not go for that.
3979174	3980455	Ah, screw them at Texas Fox.
3981115	3982456	No, this is extreme.
3982957	3983617	It's for PS2.
3984497	3985778	Theme from Enter the Dragon.
3986118	3986859	That makes me happy.
3987419	3992144	A Stupid Barber, .59, Bad Routine, Dropout, Ecstasy, I Feel, I'm For Real, Peace Out, So In Love, Sugaru, Wild Rush,
4003977	4008842	and Your Rain, the Rage Mix, Kiryamoka, which some of those we've announced on the show previously.
4009162	4010643	And then we get into the licensed songs.
4011264	4021273	Some of these aren't a surprise because actually an article that Loki had posted a while back about going into the disc and looking at the master song list did prove some of these songs would end up in DDR.
4021433	4026398	And I noticed, I recognized the first one right away because I was hoping for this, Diving by Four Strings.
4026758	4043106	Well, here's the thing, it's like, they made, okay, the Master Song List, I mean, you work on songs for a long time, they might not make it into the actual game that time, they might save them for the next game, but it's just like, you know, all the songs that they said that would be in there, eventually made it in there, so...
4044110	4049593	Hot, all those people that say, well, it wasn't in that game, Nemesis wasn't in TDR Max!
4049914	4051615	Well, tough, this is what happens, okay?
4051635	4053576	But anyways, as you were saying.
4053776	4059580	They could have an intention to put it in a mix and prepare it for the thing and never not put it in the final release.
4060080	4061761	Things change from beta to final.
4062421	4063582	That's very true, that's very true.
4064463	4069986	I actually thought I had a clip of Diving, but I guess that's on a CD, I don't have an MP3 of it anywhere.
4070326	4073108	Oh yeah, because you ripped the Four Strings album, didn't you?
4076004	4078945	We're going to see if we can... Because diving is an awesome song.
4078965	4081185	I want to play a little clip for you guys if we can get it.
4082965	4083485	Ooh, you got it?
4085946	4088566	Play a clip through the computer.
4088586	4088826	Here we go.
4088846	4089887	Here's a little clip of diving.
4095628	4096228	It's not coming through.
4096368	4096908	Alright, well.
4098248	4099328	Loki's going to see if he can fix that.
4101069	4101469	That's alright.
4101709	4102829	I'll copy it over real fast here.
4108268	4109749	That's alright, it happens.
4110769	4112630	Let's see, we're going to get a copy of it real fast here.
4114831	4119132	Other licensed songs that are going to be in DDR, Go West by the Pet Shop Boys.
4119512	4122533	I think it's kind of funny that they have Pet Shop Boys in DDR now.
4122614	4123514	That makes me happy.
4123534	4127355	Because there's a lot of Pet Shop Boy covers that have been in DDR before.
4127375	4129556	Well, there was just New York City Boy.
4131037	4131297	Wasn't...
4133887	4136089	New York City Boy, and wasn't there another?
4136589	4137110	There's others.
4137510	4138291	Okay, Loki got it.
4138311	4138631	Here we go.
4138931	4139632	A clip of diving.
4141313	4142894	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
4142994	4143495	Turn it down a little.
4143515	4143895	There you go.
4144275	4145056	Play it in the middle somewhere.
4146677	4148238	Now it's too quiet.
4148298	4149319	There we go.
4168540	4171004	Aren't these guys a previous cage match winner with this song?
4171304	4171725	I think so.
4176318	4179201	Whatever it may take, I'll keep on trying
4198161	4199943	Move Your Feet by Junior Senior
4222562	4224343	With the video, so that's going to be very cool.
4224403	4226043	It was kind of neat seeing that at E3.
4227444	4231525	Music by Darude, which I believe I've got a clip of it somewhere.
4233426	4234486	And it's the race to find the clip.
4234566	4235926	I know, whichever one of us can find the file faster.
4235946	4236827	So far, Loki is in the lead.
4237567	4239808	He seems to be looking through his list of folders.
4240908	4241948	Doing a search would be easier.
4244429	4246610	I had it at one point, but I don't know if I do anymore.
4247290	4247630	Damn.
4247770	4249291	It's like the Iron Chef commentary.
4249491	4249911	Somewhat.
4252003	4253385	Oh no, I have next to you.
4253405	4254125	I don't have music.
4255387	4255687	Damn.
4256067	4256988	We'll see if we can get a copy.
4257409	4258269	Oh, alright, Loki's got it.
4258390	4259210	And Loki wins.
4259250	4259731	Loki wins.
4261313	4263595	Play a clip somewhere in the middle here of music by Daruk.
4277566	4279548	Alright, you're blasting people's speakers.
4280268	4280548	Alright.
4282390	4285492	Planet Rock, Paul Oakenfold vs. Afrika Bambaataa.
4285533	4287094	We've played that before, I believe, on this show.
4288355	4292198	The Reflex, Duran Duran, which was in Japanese Max 2.
4292238	4292698	That's pretty exciting.
4292718	4293839	You've gone too far this time.
4294500	4296381	Simply Being Loved by BT.
4297202	4300124	Don't Clock Me from DDR Solo Mix.
4300184	4302086	I believe that's one of our... That makes me happy.
4302186	4306910	That's one of our songs that's in normal rotation on Orange Lounge Radio, I think.
4306950	4307150	Yep.
4307771	4308372	I think it is.
4308673	4309134	Yes, it is.
4309815	4313341	So we are definitely happy that Don't Clock Me finally made it into a USDDR.
4325035	4325875	Booty-tastic.
4326175	4328236	And Highs Off You by 4Real.
4329216	4338558	And I have no idea why this song was... I know why this song is in USA DDR, but the rest of us veterans are going to cringe.
4339278	4343519	Kick the Can by Bus Stop has made its way into a DDR extreme.
4343559	4347440	You know that song never pissed me off until there was that little kid at Golfland.
4347860	4349621	You were there.
4349761	4350101	I was.
4350281	4350661	I was there.
4351982	4355744	And then he went to another machine and played like some other song repeatedly.
4356825	4357505	You'll enjoy this.
4357605	4358866	It was before the song was out.
4359166	4365190	The next song that's going to be in DDR Extreme is an old boy George cover that you like, Miracle.
4365571	4366151	Ah, play.
4367012	4368733	I don't, I only have the original.
4368833	4369733	Don't we have that in rotation?
4370714	4371515	I think so.
4371955	4373096	I'd have to dig for it though.
4373876	4374497	It's max two.
4374717	4374917	Is it?
4374937	4375577	Let me see if I have it.
4375597	4375937	Let me see.
4376058	4376238	Ah.
4379447	4381850	Everybody knows what Miracle sounds like at this point, don't they?
4383772	4384773	No, I don't have that one.
4384793	4385393	We don't have that one.
4386134	4387035	No, Miracle was the first one.
4387616	4387976	Was it?
4388376	4389157	I thought it was the second one.
4390639	4392020	Alright, Max 1, not Max 2.
4392621	4393882	Alright, let's hear a little clip of Miracle.
4403470	4411434	It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle
4433347	4434071	Thanks for watching!
4445112	4446294	Look at what you see
4467065	4470507	This is Radio Station's CJ Boogie, with a brand new world premiere song from Captain Jack, Only You.
4501966	4507607	Alright, There You'll Be, which was not in the Japanese release, was not even in there, but we get it.
4507707	4516370	There You'll Be, DJ Speedo featuring Angelica, horrible, horrible speed cover of a horrible, horrible song, but I know there's fans of it out there, so hey me.
4517190	4525372	Wonderland by Xtreme, that'll be cool, and here's our last licensed song, YMCA by the Village People.
4527762	4528503	That would be funny.
4546974	4547334	What the hell?
4547814	4552137	Okay, these are the same songs as were in, like, Karaoke Revolution.
4552177	4555739	So basically, it's like, you know, the 80s songs, but sung by some retard.
4556159	4556619	I see.
4556719	4566725	So Konami got a little creative there, and they took their licenses from Karaoke Revolution, and they took the original, I mean, the singers that they used on these songs, and they made DDR mixes out of them.
4567345	4568186	Very interesting.
4568426	4573569	What a clever move by Konami, I must say, to get some very popular songs, including Believe by Cher.
4574589	4575650	Oh my god!
4576050	4577191	Bizarre Love Triangle.
4577351	4578352	Hey, that's cool.
4578412	4578792	That's awesome.
4578812	4580473	But it's not going to be the original New Order.
4580753	4582995	It's somebody else singing it for Carrier Revolution.
4583795	4588578	Ladies Night, Waiting for Tonight, and Like a Virgin.
4589819	4590759	Will that make you happy, Rob?
4590779	4592100	Yeah, it will make me very happy.
4592180	4593481	And it's not the Eurobeat one.
4594322	4596063	No, yeah, it's not the Eurobeat one.
4596943	4597344	Also...
4598456	4601818	A whole shitload of news on the iToy modes.
4602078	4608082	This is the funny thing about DDR Extreme.
4608143	4613506	It's like having DDR, and then you've got this sequel to iToy Play in it, too.
4613766	4615567	There's all these new modes in there.
4615588	4616248	It's crazy.
4616588	4618890	Like, of course, you know, hands and feet, clean the screen.
4618930	4619830	We talked about that previously.
4620251	4622752	Coconut Panic has nothing to do with DDR.
4623032	4624874	You just shake these coconut trees.
4625294	4628116	By the way, for those who don't know what the iToy is, that's the little camera.
4628456	4630058	The Thing That Sucks Magical Ball
4645071	4647132	If it had been magical balls, it would have been funnier.
4647152	4649274	That would have been awesome.
4649294	4651195	Almost as funny as Super Monkey Ball.
4651375	4658719	There's going to be like a party mode that has some stuff, including Hyper Dash, which is like that old school Konami game, like track and field.
4658999	4660580	It's going to be like that, but with the eye toy.
4660720	4662281	So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with that.
4663782	4664783	Or no, no, I'm sorry, not eye toy.
4664803	4667024	They're just going to use the left and right arrows on DDR pads.
4667064	4668265	It's like bringing back the power pad.
4669005	4669725	So that's going to be cool.
4670566	4674148	And then basically you can hit the down button and it puts a pitfall in front of the other person.
4674168	4675549	They have to hit the up button to jump.
4676849	4677990	That's going to be very interesting.
4678650	4685254	Feeding Frenzy, which is going to, it shows animals and then every arrow on the pad is like a carrot or a fish.
4685554	4688656	And you have to feed the animal the appropriate food by stepping on the arrow.
4689296	4689816	Isn't that weird?
4690356	4690997	Sounds kind of fun.
4691097	4691697	Sounds kind of weird.
4694639	4694939	Is what?
4696578	4701405	and then there will be a challenge mode as well in DDR which is going to be interesting.
4702086	4710517	Also, there were some videos released by another website and one of them gives you a sneak peek at what some of the interface music is going to sound like.
4733134	4736335	So you kind of get a preview that they've done new interface music for it too.
4736375	4737415	And it's all happy!
4737515	4739395	It's fluffy and all happy.
4740555	4742456	But it's not as awesome as a stupid barber.
4743496	4745256	No, nothing is as awesome as a stupid barber.
4745496	4747017	Which I noticed wasn't on that list.
4747397	4747637	Or did I?
4747917	4748517	Yeah, it was on there.
4748537	4748717	Was it?
4748797	4750077	Oh, I must have just missed it completely.
4750097	4751197	Because remember I went yay.
4751597	4756578	Here's the thing, they should have really had like a porn star giant tits doing, you know, the little animation thing there.
4756878	4760039	Because they had that one chick jumping up and down that was not doing anything for me.
4763058	4766200	Alright, we opened up the Skype line again.
4766220	4772324	If you have any comments on DDR, Extreme USA, something you want to share, we'll go ahead and take your call.
4772384	4775947	Maybe something we didn't mention that you really wanted to make sure we got out there.
4776607	4780450	I know one thing that was pretty humorous was they actually ran an article on Yahoo News.
4780690	4782691	Tell us about this, Loki, because you read about this.
4782751	4785173	You actually posted the article, a link to it on our site, right?
4785873	4791157	Okay, this guy is a professional game reviewer, and I honestly don't think he's ever played this game that he reviewed.
4792017	4795000	Um, because honestly, he doesn't know shit about DDR at all.
4795401	4800065	He has kept saying DDR Max from the Xbox, and just like, crap like that.
4800145	4807352	He didn't know what the fuck he was talking about, and just comparing it with like, he pretty much was talking out of his ass throughout the whole interview.
4808133	4814940	So the whole interview, the whole review of the damn thing was just completely shit, but, you know, at least it had pictures and pretty movies.
4816570	4818831	Yeah, that's where that movie I just played for you guys came from.
4818871	4820412	Of course, you can't see movies over the radio.
4820772	4822954	But, anyway, we're going to take a call real fast.
4824154	4826196	Hello, Orange Lounge, you are on Z-Air.
4827436	4828217	Hey, Rob, can you hear me?
4828437	4829117	Yes, we can.
4829938	4831399	Hey, this is Dark Knight off of the East Coast.
4831599	4832859	Hey, Dark Knight, how are you doing?
4833560	4833980	All right.
4834360	4837202	Yeah, so a quick comment on those song lists.
4837222	4838503	This is a pretty decent list, though.
4838923	4844026	Yeah, it's surprisingly different than the arcade extreme, which is good, though.
4844046	4845447	It's a little yellow different.
4845507	4845787	Yeah.
4846641	4849883	Yeah, but some of these songs, I'm probably going to be, like, feeling miserably.
4850223	4850884	That's alright.
4850904	4851684	Hey, it takes practice.
4852105	4861991	I'm looking forward, as much as I think the eye toy is kind of a one-trick pony, I'm looking forward to having my trick the day I get extreme and being able to play the eye toy modes on there.
4862011	4863072	I think it's going to be pretty cute.
4863912	4866514	Yeah, but that sub-para-para mode, that's kind of questionable, though.
4866834	4867134	Yeah.
4867435	4868876	Well, you know, it's different.
4869116	4873859	It's the closest thing we're ever going to get to anything like it in the U.S., so we might as well deal with it.
4874537	4875517	That's true, that's true.
4875937	4878758	Anything in particular on the list that you are very excited about?
4879859	4880799	Wild Rush, mostly.
4881239	4881979	Wild Rush?
4883060	4884380	I could play that song easily.
4885180	4885921	Alright, alright.
4886061	4887001	Wild Rush is awesome.
4887021	4892423	What about the... I know, I love Wild Rush too, but I thought maybe a licensed song, like, you know, diving.
4892503	4894964	I'm so excited about diving, because I love four strings.
4895064	4895524	I love them.
4895804	4897444	And so I'm excited that diving's in there, so.
4898105	4902066	Some of the songs kind of cringe at Never Ending Story, because in my area...
4902662	4906126	That song has been played out on our fifth mix machine every time we had it.
4906146	4907267	Thank God it's gone now.
4907647	4908428	Which song is that again?
4909048	4909909	Never Ending Story.
4910009	4910690	Oh, Never Ending Story.
4910730	4912071	Hey, don't you knock that song.
4912652	4914654	I'm sorry, man.
4914754	4916336	It's been on everybody's play around.
4916396	4918478	I'm like, just skip it this once.
4919376	4919716	All right.
4920516	4923757	In our chatroom, they're saying it's not Parapara mode.
4923897	4925498	It's more like Dance Maniacs mode.
4925618	4926138	Whatever.
4926238	4927278	Whatever you want to call it.
4927558	4931239	It's the only Bomani hand thing we're going to have in the U.S., so deal.
4931819	4934320	It's like Flag Down Taxi mode is more like what it is.
4934460	4936540	It's not even Dance Maniacs.
4937580	4939121	I look like a fucking retard.
4939421	4940001	That's what it is.
4940581	4941021	You know what?
4941081	4944562	When I played Clean the Screen, I did look like a fucking retard, but it was fun.
4944822	4947743	And you know what was cool about it is that it's more of a workout.
4948183	4950325	That was the intention, I think.
4950365	4953407	Yeah, you know how a lot of people play DDR for the workout aspect of it?
4953647	4957270	When you're moving your arms in it, too, that's like three, four times the workout.
4957310	4959711	Would you rather look like a goofball or do the river dance?
4959811	4962193	I would rather look like a goofball and then have a six-pack.
4962793	4966176	How does moving your arms give you an ab workout, Rob?
4966216	4967037	Just shut up.
4968217	4969198	Don't ruin my fantasy, bitch!
4972549	4980983	No, no, I want to see pure interactivity, just like Gal's Panic, where they actually had 1-800 numbers, you could call and talk to the women once you beat that level.
4981223	4982405	That was fucking awesome.
4982505	4984108	You are being way too random.
4984168	4986572	Anyway, anything else you want to say about Extreme Dark Knight?
4987355	4988455	No, that's about it, man.
4988475	4991276	I just hope this game will be successful as everyone's, man.
4991396	4993216	Just keep it going long enough for me.
4993556	4994816	I think it's going to be huge.
4994836	4995756	You know what I think, though?
4996057	5002618	Is that this is going to get people... Between this and Ultramix 2, and I really think Ultramix 2 is going to surprise a lot of people.
5002998	5008079	I think people who have been bashing the Xbox, and I admit, I was in this category.
5008299	5014260	And then finally I got swayed and I bought Ultramix and I kind of ate my words on this show that it really isn't that bad.
5014540	5015240	But Ultramix 2...
5016360	5024343	Mark my words right here and right now, not all of you people out there that are bashing Xbox, but 80% of you are going to eat your words when Ultramix 2 comes out.
5024483	5027905	And I admit, I had to eat my words at one point, you will too.
5028825	5034307	I think between Ultramix 2 and Extreme, people are going to be rioting for a new arcade mix.
5034567	5040150	Because I think this is going to show that US knows their shit when it comes to putting these games together.
5040270	5044952	I think there's so many new things in there that people are just going to say, why can't we have a new arcade mix?
5045072	5045732	Why, why, why?
5046790	5053896	God, that they don't put a fucking Itoy thing on the arcade mix if there was ever one to come out, because that'd be the fucking stupidest thing ever.
5054636	5056958	And I could go into why that would be retarded later.
5058079	5060421	It would give you plenty of opportunity to make fun of people.
5060441	5064444	But still, just the licenses, just the new interfaces, the new stuff, there's enough.
5064484	5067326	You could take out the Itoy and you would have enough cool stuff for an arcade mix.
5067566	5070269	I'd like to go into why that's stupid right now, okay?
5070509	5075593	I played that stupid game I Can Boogie, okay, which is pretty much the arcade version of Itoy Groove.
5076153	5078316	Let me just say this, it sucks.
5078456	5085786	It's just about as good as playing iToy Groove, it's just as sensitive, it didn't detect shit, I completely failed my song, even though I was hitting it just right.
5086246	5092114	And they have really stupid music in there, like Barbie Girl and hot stuff, and like, all this like, gay-ass shit, okay?
5092835	5093796	No thank you.
5094628	5095268	All right, guys.
5095349	5095929	Thanks, man.
5096109	5096449	All right.
5096809	5098671	Yeah, we're just, like, holding you on the line, Dark Knight.
5098751	5100132	We'll let you get back to listening to the show.
5100152	5100852	Thanks for calling in.
5101352	5101733	No problem.
5101753	5101973	All right.
5101993	5102313	Take care.
5102953	5103454	That was fun.
5103814	5104154	All right.
5104835	5105875	We'll open it back up.
5105915	5107256	Maybe one more person let him through.
5108157	5108837	DDR Extreme.
5109578	5110938	Garrett, you've been awfully quiet over there.
5110958	5113400	I know you don't care as much about DDR as you do 2DX.
5113640	5113880	Hi!
5115721	5116462	And pop music.
5116482	5117483	But what do you think about all this?
5119144	5119484	Well...
5120612	5126677	The last time I played DDR was when you were over at my house and we decided to see if my red octane pad was still broken.
5126757	5129759	And that was the last time I played DDR, by the way, which was about three weeks ago, was it?
5129799	5130440	Yeah.
5130500	5141889	I had fun with it, but, you know, it's just... I mean, if they're not going to make anything new in Japan, I shouldn't be that concerned about them making anything new here because I don't really give a crap about licensed songs a lot of the time.
5141929	5143330	I'm more about the original stuff.
5144131	5147893	So... But the new modes and the new features don't do it for you?
5148234	5149635	Well, okay, like, remember...
5150492	5154314	Back in the day, that PC game called Kai's Photogu
5155635	5159638	No, no idea what you're talking about, but okay.
5159698	5164722	Yeah, I've seen screenshots of these new eye toy modes for DDR Extreme.
5164742	5165442	What the fuck is this?
5165482	5168084	It looks like some goofy piece of crap like that.
5168684	5173107	And, you know, it's like, they should just say it's a bonus game for Extreme.
5173168	5174348	It's not a part of Extreme.
5174649	5177290	It's Extreme bundled with eye toy bullshit.
5177370	5184676	But see, I give Konami a little credit for, you know, giving us new eye toy bullshit or new bullshit at all and not just, you know...
5185256	5186097	It's just not your cup of tea
5201680	5202841	It lost its value.
5203121	5204822	Wake you up when 2DX comes out.
5205202	5215005	When I want to get some exercise on again, I'll break it out and then I might buy a new, like I might buy Extreme USA when that's here if I feel like getting in shape or something.
5215325	5215926	That's about it.
5217786	5225189	I'm going to put up a thing in our forums when Ultramix 2 comes out because I want to see how many people went out and bought an Xbox because of Ultramix 2.
5227170	5230151	I think it's going to be... I don't know.
5230251	5235154	I just... There's just too much hype about it, and I think it's going to live up to the hype.
5235174	5235554	We'll see.
5236154	5236474	All right.
5237415	5237835	Moving on.
5237855	5241336	We're going to move on to the other Bomani news?
5242377	5243297	Actually, I want to save that.
5243377	5246038	I think I kind of want to get into Cage Match now, because it's 8 o'clock already.
5246058	5250060	We're already halfway through the show, so we've got to get some of our regular bits out of the way here.
5250140	5250980	All right.
5251521	5254962	Are you doing more bad video game trivia that I can suck at?
5255803	5256783	What, the Orange Crush stuff?
5257395	5260116	No, the... No, no, that was a Vanilla Sky thing.
5261296	5262297	Oh, okay.
5262357	5262717	Darn.
5262857	5263417	That's alright.
5264618	5265398	That was one of my spin-offs.
5265418	5266698	Shows you how often I come here.
5269339	5270460	Can they hear the Tetris over there?
5270520	5272100	Somebody's saying, who's playing Tetris?
5272180	5273101	Can they hear that over the air?
5274341	5274661	I don't know.
5275041	5275501	Hopefully not.
5275661	5275982	We'll see.
5276882	5279523	Alright, yeah, we're going to get into the cage match right now.
5282757	5284680	Oh, my bad, I thought they could hear it.
5286282	5293893	Just a reminder, you have to be in the chatroom if you want to participate in our cage match, but it is the chatters that pick the winners of this stuff, so let's get into it.
5296844	5311268	Last week on the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Oh, the way the Cage Match works, I should explain this Three songs picked by the hosts It used to be songs that would be good for music video games Like DDR and 2DX and stuff But it just kind of turned into What's a cool song?
5312488	5321610	Is basically what it turned into, so that's okay But each song picks a host Each host picks, each song picks a host?
5321670	5324431	No Each host picks a song And then...
5325856	5330782	We let you guys vote on them, and then the winner goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Ones Radio.
5330822	5337649	Now, I hear that while I was gone, my song lost, and it was taken over by Loki's pick.
5337709	5340252	And Loki, what did you put in the cage match last week that ended up winning?
5341113	5344917	of the Ecstasy 14 Hours Club Mix, the one that I made and played.
5344937	5346078	I was just being lazy.
5346939	5350061	All right, and I really like this mix, though, so we'll see.
5350782	5351323	So here it is.
5351423	5354425	You only get to hear a clip of it because it is last week's winner.
5354826	5358830	So we only play a little clip of it because we assume you already heard it last week, like a good listener would.
5359410	5364555	So here it is, a little clip of Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.
5364755	5365276	Enjoy, guys.
5442286	5444887	All right, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's cage match.
5444907	5448769	A very sexy remix of Ecstasy done by our very own Loki.
5449169	5450030	14 hours club mix.
5451090	5453411	So, yeah, wow, it's going to be tough to beat.
5453691	5455372	But Jamie and I are certainly going to try.
5455472	5457733	I think I have a song that might do it.
5458093	5459914	But we'll give yours a try too, Jamie.
5460194	5461815	But I got to say, looking at your pick...
5462355	5465217	This isn't what I would think you would listen to.
5465277	5467379	I'm very surprised by your pick.
5467419	5468440	Turn on your mic.
5468940	5469861	It's a Metro Mix.
5469881	5471102	I would listen to it.
5471122	5472583	Oh yeah, you like those Metro Mixes.
5472863	5476006	But the artist is somebody I would never expect you to like.
5476046	5476286	What?
5476326	5478288	Julio Iglesias has a sexy voice.
5478608	5479289	You mean Enrique?
5479409	5480269	Enrique.
5480349	5481570	Well, I used to listen to him too.
5481851	5483372	Alright, tell us about your cage match picks for tonight.
5483452	5489597	I'd take Enrique Iglesias' Hero, the Metro Mix, because it's a Metro Mix.
5490143	5492504	And so is this something that you think would be good in DDR?
5492924	5493445	It's just cool.
5493605	5494005	Why?
5494505	5495466	I don't know.
5497127	5503930	It would be playable, but I mean, it's... It's just... Good voice, good music.
5504210	5504850	Well, we'll see.
5505031	5506691	It's a Metro mix, that's enough for me.
5506891	5508172	We'll see what the folks here think.
5508212	5511214	Here it is, Enrique Iglesias with Hero, the Metro mix.
5511254	5512094	Jamie's pick for tonight.
5512194	5512574	Enjoy.
5514675	5515716	Would you dance?
5517577	5519298	If I asked you to dance?
5522077	5526920	Would you run and never look back?
5529381	5534184	Would you cry if you saw me crying?
5536785	5540007	Would you save my soul tonight?
5540047	5542308	Would you tremble if I touched your lips?
5558032	5561677	Now would you die for the one you love?
5561777	5565923	Hold me in your arms tonight
5576492	5584435	I'll be your hero, baby I can kiss away the pain I will stand by you forever You kiss me, but let me do it for me
5610652	5611232	Would you lie?
5611272	5612513	Would you remind?
5612573	5613254	Am I in too deep?
5613274	5613934	Have I lost my mind?
5649116	5661786	I will stand by you forever You can take my breath away I just wanna hold you I just wanna hold you Oh yeah Come into me
5679742	5681383	Have I lost my mind?
5681403	5685524	Well, I don't care.
5686265	5688806	You'll be here tonight.
5688966	5690366	I can be your hero, baby.
5690426	5692407	I can give away the fight.
5707902	5712264	I will stand by you forever You can take my place
5726216	5733380	I can kiss away the pain And I will stand by you Forever You can take my breath away You
5754734	5756556	Thank you for watching!
5773416	5777197	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Enrique Iglesias, Hero.
5777397	5780538	Let's go around the room now, and this is the part where we tell you what we think.
5780598	5782519	But remember, it is up to you guys.
5782559	5786680	You have to join our chat room, orangelawnradio.com, and then you can vote and tell us what you think.
5787201	5787461	Jamie.
5788681	5789141	Good voice.
5789161	5791042	Metro Max, make it like a nine for me.
5791742	5792703	All right, nine from Jamie.
5793643	5793963	Garrett.
5795684	5798865	I hear the original version of that song all damn day at work.
5798945	5799665	I don't want to hear it.
5801365	5802106	Scale of one to ten.
5803464	5804385	Bel Air Radio.
5805226	5805686	I don't know.
5806527	5807127	No comment.
5807388	5808489	Alright, uh, Bugs.
5809530	5810471	I was playing Excited Bike.
5810531	5811371	Excited Bike was better.
5813253	5814374	Alright, Loki.
5815776	5816837	It was eh.
5816857	5821401	The original song was like eh, and this is just like eh with a new beat in the background.
5821421	5823803	Like it was like a vibe.
5825271	5834054	Um, I, it's definitely, I like it better than the original, I like it with the added beat, um, so it's above average to me, so I give it like a 7, so it's pretty cool.
5834755	5838996	Um, but I've heard better Metro mixes, like I like the Daniel Bedingfield ones better, but that's alright.
5839316	5840577	Anyway, uh, moving on.
5841813	5845919	I'm going to try this from iTunes tonight, because this is a song I actually bought on iTunes.
5846620	5847801	Hopefully it works for you guys.
5849524	5856012	Song number three in tonight's cage match is my pick, and I don't know if you guys have heard, but Utada Hikaru is going to be coming out with a US album.
5856533	5857833	Thank you to Utada.com
5887552	5890273	Everybody wants me to be your angel Everybody wants something special
5915286	5915987	Thank you for watching!
5937245	5937946	Thank you for watching!
5970262	5970863	Thank you for watching!
6015064	6015605	and many more.
6062915	6064816	Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
6064936	6068298	Utada with Devil Inside.
6068338	6069939	That's her first American single.
6070720	6073521	Well, unless you count Simple and Clean, but that wasn't really a single.
6073561	6075723	Devil Inside, the Richard Vision radio edit.
6075743	6076903	Let's go around and see what everybody thought.
6077023	6077364	Jamie!
6078104	6085027	I really, really dig her voice, but that was such a boring remix that I give it a 6.
6086787	6091429	The voice gets a 10, the mix itself would get like a 4, so she gets a 6.
6091769	6096171	I honestly thought the original was so repetitive that it wouldn't have worked in Cage Match.
6096491	6099572	I agree, the remix is kind of... Garrett.
6100332	6104314	I never heard the original or the remix, and I was pretty fond of it.
6104354	6105694	I liked her voice a lot in that, too.
6105874	6107275	Everything I usually hear from her...
6107827	6118070	It sounds like they want to be like Britney or something, so it's good to hear something that sounded slightly more original vocally, so I give it a 7.
6118110	6118831	Alright, 7 from Garrett.
6119031	6120371	Bugs, if we can get him a mic.
6121311	6123252	If he's not too busy playing something on the main cabinet.
6123452	6124813	Actually, I was kind of listening to it.
6124893	6125613	Oh, okay, what did you think?
6125633	6127053	It was better than the last one.
6127693	6129154	Alright, what did you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?
6131229	6132110	Oh, scales, yeah.
6132370	6132750	Uh, seven.
6132810	6133170	Alright.
6133431	6133891	Uh, Loki!
6135412	6139154	Um, you know, I swear to God I've heard that, like, beat in another song.
6139315	6141296	I just don't remember what exactly it was.
6142036	6145699	So, it was like, eh, it was, eh.
6145799	6149721	I like her, I like her music, but that was just, like, really crappy.
6149741	6153864	She should really just take everything she's done in Japan, just bring it over here.
6154144	6159388	Don't try to, you know, make it, you know, more American by taking a shit on it, you know.
6161567	6164949	So yeah, I'll give it like a 6.
6165009	6168670	Me personally, it's very disco to me, and disco rocks, so I give it an 8.
6169951	6176034	Alright, let's review one more time, and then you can vote in our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
6176634	6181276	Song number one tonight, Ecstasy, the 14-hour club mix.
6190433	6202916	Song number two in tonight's cage match is Enrique Iglesias with Hero, the Metro Mix.
6203096	6204136	Let's try that again.
6204536	6208917	Song number two in tonight's cage match was Enrique Iglesias with Hero, the Metro Mix.
6225171	6231560	And song number three in tonight's cage match was Utada with Devil Inside, the Richard Vision radio edit.
6244123	6244643	All right.
6245124	6253028	Send those votes on over to www.orangeonthrade.com, but then click on chat and then the sky in the chat room.
6253368	6257630	So place vote now over your private message in our chat room.
6261920	6262220	All right.
6263321	6264481	And then we'll do this.
6264922	6267023	I tried to do this two weeks ago, but nobody did it.
6267263	6271485	But I will open up the Skype line if anybody wants to make a plea for one of those songs.
6271585	6273826	If anybody has a plea for one of those songs to win.
6273906	6275587	So we'll see if anybody calls in on that.
6278448	6280089	Any predictions for which you guys think will win?
6280829	6280970	Eh.
6281150	6282150	I think Loki's will win again.
6282750	6283071	Yeah.
6283311	6283551	Yeah.
6284151	6284551	We'll see.
6285192	6285672	We'll see, though.
6286032	6286892	I vote for Holic.
6287613	6288593	You can't vote for Holic.
6288633	6289794	One of these two, Holic's going to win.
6290802	6295583	Alright, um, moving on, um, I guess we'll get into the other big Bomondi news.
6295644	6298824	Okay, nobody wanted to call on that, so we'll just, uh, close the Skype line.
6298905	6300425	Alright, uh, let's see.
6300445	6303746	You know that someone said they're going, I can't get it to work!
6304086	6307247	I have to make a comment, and I can't get it to work!
6308848	6309168	Alright.
6309228	6309548	Or not.
6309988	6310648	Uh, it's alright.
6311168	6314609	Um, so who wants to tell us about the, uh, 2DX11th style news?
6315090	6315790	Garrett's raising his hand.
6315830	6316390	Me, me, me, me, me.
6317554	6318455	You know what's the weirdest thing?
6318715	6320758	I have to say, first off, are you sure this is legit?
6320798	6328487	Because when I was reading some of this stuff, it sounded very... There's one part of it that makes me go, whoa, wait a minute.
6328527	6334895	You know, it did have that kind of air to DDR Extreme 2 stuff that was going around.
6334995	6335215	Right.
6336684	6353371	Yeah, but, yeah, well, anyways, um, well, actually, the strangest thing is, um, DJP on Damani Style, like, I haven't talked to him in a long time, and then we just, like, he just messaged me, like, like, one morning, he was like, oh, they, we just found out, Eleven Style, la la la, um...
6354091	6359853	The only thing that makes it look fake is all the damn speculation that's going on it because there isn't a lot of concrete information.
6360333	6367616	There is a fax that came out.
6367976	6376418	They always send these faxes out to arcades when there's a new style coming out and test locations seem to give arcades information about the next upgrade kit and stuff.
6376558	6381080	And that was what was sent to whoever, I forgot the whole chain of people,
6381542	6399146	It went through, but they said their sources from where it came from are very legit, and I believe everything on the facts, but people are already saying that, oh, Coors K is doing the system music, oh, there's going to be an Iconoclasm song in it, and all this other crap.
6399426	6400767	And it's not just wishful thinking.
6401187	6405771	Because the part that got me was that they said that Ono Ken was going to have a song in it.
6406071	6409814	And don't get me wrong, I think that should happen because he's a very talented guy.
6409874	6410975	That's all the speculation that I have.
6410995	6415878	But that makes me go, that's so fanboyish.
6415898	6418560	Like I said, Chorus K doing the system music.
6420281	6424323	DJ Taka's done all the system music except Slake did the theme for 8th style.
6425104	6427445	Unless I'm disregarding old stuff.
6427465	6430606	But Kors K has kind of made more and more of a presence in 2DX, 9th, 10th.
6430706	6437810	I would say it would make more sense for Ryu Star to do the system music.
6438090	6444252	Because all of a sudden it went from one song in 4th, a remix in 9th, and then three new songs in 10th.
6444573	6447374	And Kors K still only has two songs in existence.
6449013	6457176	I was in a very Japanese-y mood to try and make out much of it, but one thing I did notice on there, because a lot of people are saying that it's going to be transplant-heavy,
6471822	6477027	I think that they may have misread that, or I just didn't read it thoroughly enough.
6477307	6485053	There's a part at the bottom where it mentions pop music, drum mania, and guitar freaks, but it says collaboration in Katakana.
6485674	6491819	So it may be more artists from other games are crossing over into this.
6492731	6493191	Interesting.
6493591	6496492	Also, speaking of artists, we just got this word in our chatroom.
6496873	6504115	Mel B, who passes along some official news from Konami, mentions that Shoti... I don't think he's done anything in 2DX, but DDR, of course, is a stupid barber.
6504415	6510298	Shoti has left... has parted ways with Konami, so we won't be seeing any more songs from him, which is too bad.
6510318	6511638	Aw, no more Shoichiro Hirata?
6511698	6513759	Yeah, because... Aw.
6514867	6519108	There was no more Akira Shunsuke in Poppin' Music 11.
6519429	6526451	Once I got my damn CD, I rifled through the booklet and he's gone too.
6526491	6531732	The only thing that I think is really, really weird about that fax is that it's Beatmania 2DX11-style red.
6537663	6538444	What the hell is that?
6538644	6540105	2DX Red.
6541446	6542326	Did you see the fax?
6542947	6545508	No, you can actually see the actual fax?
6545549	6546769	Yeah, you can see the fax.
6546889	6549871	They have pictures of Emall cards on it too.
6550212	6555315	They said there's going to be an upgrade for the Emall machine or system or something.
6556116	6559718	They said there will be over 300 songs included in the arcade, I think.
6560253	6562254	But yeah, just go to Bimani Style real quick.
6562294	6563414	Alright, I'm going, I'm going.
6563454	6564635	Let's see, let's check this out.
6564855	6567636	And then, it's on the last... Thank God they don't have that god-awful music.
6568236	6573378	Actually, I really like that song they used to play on here, but man, after hearing it for like three weeks... And then, down at the bottom...
6574304	6575665	Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom.
6575685	6576426	Headlines.
6576746	6577827	Alright, we're on our way.
6578167	6580429	We'll take a look at the facts here, because I haven't seen this.
6580749	6581990	Remember, I was gone for two weeks.
6582110	6583371	I'm sorry, where the hell did I go?
6583411	6585152	I was completely out of the loop for like two weeks.
6585172	6585513	Oh, there it is.
6585593	6586974	Okay, just click on the first page.
6588235	6589976	And it's a link right there.
6589996	6593899	So when I came back home, I was like, oh, interesting.
6596341	6596962	Hmm.
6597162	6597482	Yes.
6600882	6602143	Very interesting.
6602203	6603425	Let's see, there's going to be more than... What?
6603445	6604806	With a little screenshot and everything?
6605007	6612655	Yeah, okay, more than 45 new songs, more than 320 songs in the fucking arcade.
6613116	6614958	Here's all those email cards.
6616499	6617060	Blah, blah, blah.
6617080	6621044	See, there's the thing right here that says... It's like... I'm being lazy.
6621064	6622346	It's like Miscellaneous Spamani...
6623526	6631228	Uh, series, something, music, collab, collaboration, no you can't translate it, it's a scan.
6632288	6633549	Um, collaboration.
6639150	6641631	It doesn't say transplant, it says collaboration.
6643151	6644532	It's an English word they're using.
6645632	6648793	Um, poppin' music, drum and guitar freaks.
6651331	6657133	New something, something, participating, entry, user, something.
6657174	6659775	Garrett's going through and actually reading what Japanese he knows.
6659815	6661235	He's reading some of the Japanese.
6661255	6663617	The facts is all in Japanese, but he's reading some of it.
6663777	6667378	I can type it out later and do a lazy translation on it, too.
6667478	6670420	Somebody obviously already translated it.
6670440	6679144	All the people who did the speculating and said stuff about what was listed in here, I have no idea who actually did that or if they were going off their own guesses or actually translated some of it.
6679365	6683404	They have a lot of Japanese users on there that can do that though Very interesting
6685559	6704729	The pictures that they show are really shitty, but maybe, like, for instance, maybe the background for, like, that one screenshot was FMV from an Onukin song, because he does do his, you know, BMS files with, you know, full motion video, and so they might have recognized that, and that's where the speculation for that comes.
6706070	6706550	Just a guess.
6707931	6708311	Who knows?
6708531	6709512	I couldn't see anything in it.
6709792	6710132	Alright.
6710713	6711373	Well, we'll, uh,
6712967	6716691	I don't know, I mean, it's a scan of a fax, I mean, eh, you know.
6716951	6718913	No, no, it's just the fax.
6719674	6721476	Well, yeah, actually, yeah, the scan of the fax, but...
6722032	6723552	It's going to look the same either way.
6723572	6725553	I want to spit out the machine where it was faxed from.
6725713	6729754	Still, it's just that Onokan thing, it just reeks of fanboy.
6729934	6735736	And it's not that I don't want to believe it's true, because I think that's awesome, but it's just so... I don't know.
6735796	6738356	I think if it is true, that's very cool that Konami did that.
6738376	6740197	The Iconoclasm thing is very fanboy, too.
6740237	6740817	Come on.
6741137	6741417	It is.
6741797	6743258	I don't see how you would know what the...
6745317	6752636	There were so many people who planted bullshit rumors when TenthStyle was coming out.
6759641	6768025	We're being called out in the chatroom because it's not really 11th style, because now it's the 2DX Red.
6768546	6770186	It's not 11th style, it's 2DX Red.
6770467	6774889	But you know, how long were we calling it DDR6 mix before we found it?
6775309	6776349	It still has an 11 in it.
6776369	6779431	Yeah, there's a little 11 in there, so it's a reference to it.
6780478	6783301	I don't think we're going to be seeing blue or yellow or any other color.
6783401	6785483	Somebody suggested 2DX grape for 12.
6787726	6789047	I want a purple 2DX.
6790068	6790629	That's what I want.
6791289	6792971	I hope they change the interface up and stuff.
6793211	6795013	I'm sorry, what, Jamie?
6796215	6796775	We can't hear you.
6799358	6800219	I was taking a nap.
6800659	6801320	2DX burning.
6803291	6819294	Burning Heat Burning Burning Burning Nation Mix Like a 2DX Muru Mix or something Alright That'd be cool Anything else you gotta think of on 2DX When the fax came out they said that the test location was going on that day, they were wrong
6819653	6828236	They reconfirmed it, and they said that it should actually be going on within this next week, because when they send these faxes, all the test locations have happened within a week of them sending it, usually.
6828436	6830276	Oh, that's kind of quick.
6830556	6832337	Well, it's just a fax.
6832377	6833637	It's just for the test location.
6834278	6838299	They do think these things kind of last a moment anyway, so this week, hopefully, we'll probably sing...
6838479	6852350	Yeah, but it seems like the time between 8th's release and anything on 9th and then 9th's release and anything on 10th was longer than 10th's release and now this first bit of indication that there will be a continuation of the series.
6852370	6854432	10th's kind of snuck up after 9th in my opinion.
6856553	6856914	I don't know.
6857574	6860216	They'd hella jump on these things on the Drum Man and Guitar Freak stuff.
6860276	6862138	They just spew those things out.
6863118	6867663	But they said that the test location should probably be going on within a week or so.
6868024	6870827	They think that the actual arcade will be out in October.
6871708	6877676	And also, if everyone didn't know, 8th Style CS will be released before the year is over.
6878697	6878957	Good.
6879678	6880019	Good news.
6880819	6881199	All right.
6881519	6883079	Lots of fun stuff in the 2DX front then.
6883139	6884420	Good, so it's not a dying series.
6884620	6884800	No.
6885080	6885120	No.
6885140	6886160	As much as people would like you to believe.
6886600	6887020	Yay.
6887760	6888100	All right.
6889161	6891701	We're going to reveal, if that's all you've got to say on 2DX.
6891741	6891921	Yep.
6892141	6892381	All right.
6892841	6899363	We'll go ahead and open up the Skype line if somebody has a comment they want to say on 2DX 11, 2DX Red, whatever you want to call it.
6900323	6901523	Why 2DX Red?
6901803	6902103	Why?
6904304	6904664	Whatever.
6904844	6905704	I guess, why Max?
6905804	6906544	I mean, why Max?
6906644	6907124	Why anything?
6907424	6908545	Why Pokemon Red?
6908645	6909805	Why Pokemon Blue?
6910495	6915278	Why do they have all their bad English titles and their banners and stuff?
6915378	6920642	Somebody in our chatroom was comparing it to Dance Mania, being like Dance Mania Best Red and Best Yellow.
6922123	6927006	Which is interesting because 2DX isn't really related to Dance Mania, yet that kind of makes sense.
6928447	6929048	I don't know.
6929088	6930289	Maybe it's a Japanese thing, I don't know.
6931069	6932170	Alright, here comes the call.
6932230	6933991	Let's check out what's going on.
6934031	6935072	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge.
6935772	6936353	Hey, what's up?
6942285	6943705	We got a little bit of problem with your bandwidth.
6943725	6944606	You're cutting up a little bit.
6947066	6947426	Weird.
6948066	6948887	Is your stream running?
6950267	6952248	Stop the station if you have the station running.
6954428	6955308	Ooh, he's cutting out really bad.
6955509	6957129	Can he say something again?
6959110	6960690	Okay, buddy, you're cutting out really bad.
6960730	6961170	I'm sorry.
6961270	6963411	See, try calling back in a little bit.
6963511	6964491	I don't know what's going on there.
6965611	6966212	Sorry about that.
6967372	6967872	That's too bad.
6972222	6980165	Alright, um, well, we'll just, uh, try it again in a little bit.
6980685	6981265	We'll keep it open.
6982306	6984267	Um, moving on.
6984847	6990229	Well, with the sky blind still open, if anybody's got comment on 2DX, what do you think of all this, Loki?
6992530	6993410	I don't play 2DX.
6994650	6995771	Alright, Siggy's gonna try back.
6995791	6996751	We're gonna see if it works this time.
6997852	6998532	Alright, can you hear us now?
7001061	7005102	Hey, what's up?
7005642	7006243	Huh, weird.
7007343	7007803	Well, what's up?
7016126	7018406	You know what, you're still cutting out really, really bad.
7018426	7018926	I'm sorry.
7018946	7022587	We're going to have to... Send me a message in the chat room and we'll address your comments.
7022687	7023268	Sorry, bud.
7024028	7024328	All right.
7025049	7026350	Why are we playing this game?
7043720	7046961	Because it's Strider, which is the most awesome game ever.
7048281	7050962	Nobody in video games is cooler than Strider, hear you.
7051242	7055162	I asked Siggy to send me his thoughts over a private message, so we'll address those in a little bit.
7056803	7059203	Meanwhile, let's talk about the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?
7059243	7059903	That'll be exciting.
7060944	7065265	Tonight's cage match winner really isn't much of a surprise.
7065545	7066465	Loki wins it again.
7073757	7075898	with Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.
7076298	7077919	Congratulations to you, my friend.
7078139	7078519	Good job.
7079879	7080219	All right.
7082760	7090503	Okay, so, hey, speaking of which, Loki, any sim news you got going on in the world of the simulations?
7091863	7093004	Yeah, there's a little bit.
7094865	7096346	Starting off with a few things.
7096526	7100108	I downloaded this really cool theme earlier this week.
7100468	7103370	It was called Technolizer something to that effect.
7103990	7112275	Anyways, it's just some really cool Stepmania theme that's, I don't know, it just looks a little different than the rest of them.
7112315	7113496	So that's kind of cool.
7113516	7114996	You can check it out on Stepmania.
7115036	7116898	They have it under the themes form.
7116958	7121100	It's under a thread called, I found this really cool Stepmania theme.
7121843	7122084	What?
7122725	7124328	Was that the theme you were showing me the other night?
7124408	7125631	Because that was an awesome theme.
7126132	7127655	Yes, that was the one I was showing you the other night.
7128036	7129218	Anyways, so there's that one.
7131280	7141069	Other than that, some developments, as far as sim stuff goes, there's a guy that figured out how to rip the Polygon dancing characters out of the DDR games, so he's doing that now.
7141670	7142331	So that's kinda cool.
7142591	7153201	And with that, he's also getting all the graphics and background animations from the games, so pretty much everything is being able to be ripped from DDR now, so nothing really left.
7154222	7155783	Aside from that, there's also...
7157743	7164288	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7188163	7189484	And, um, so those are on there.
7190724	7205409	And, um, aside from all that, um, in case you haven't been following stuff, they actually do have support now being added in StepMania for a bunch of different game types, including BeatMania, DanceManiacs, and Technomotion, which I thought was interesting.
7206570	7215033	Um, so those you can download, actually, and play it, and I'm sure Alpha, um, I think 22 now will be coming out any time now.
7216223	7217924	So that's pretty much all that's going on right now.
7223325	7223685	All right.
7224726	7225186	Let's see.
7225326	7229567	Now what we're going to do, we're going to go to a break, I think, and then we'll come back and we'll get into the FUs of the week.
7229607	7236209	So if you have something angsty you want to send to us all, go to our chat room and send me a private message with your angst.
7236569	7241531	In the meantime, we're going to hear a couple more songs from Poppin' 11, and I believe Garrett has another surprise for us.
7241551	7243071	So tell us about what we're going to hear this break, Garrett.
7243786	7246269	Well, first, I picked another song for Rob.
7247089	7250413	It's a remix of one of his songs that has a Penguin-esque character in it.
7251034	7253997	It's a remix of Requiem from Poppin' Music 9.
7254978	7258381	And then, after that, is a CS9 song.
7258641	7260864	You know, all the CS9 songs were on this soundtrack.
7261124	7261244	It's...
7262645	7263706	Yumei Tou Genjitsu
7280991	7287317	Another remix of Yo-Kon-Ko, but this is from Death's Rose album, and it's just like a pretty much all heavy metal mix.
7287377	7296445	It's strangely, it's basically game size, but they added in another verse, so they cut off the beginning verse, and there's no reggae to it anymore.
7296886	7298127	So, but it's pretty cool.
7298567	7298928	So yeah.
7300669	7301790	All right, let's check it out.
7302391	7304933	Starting this set off with a remix of Requiem.
7304993	7305574	All right, enjoy.
7377334	7377756	Thank you.
7485976	7486683	DarkSakura
7522657	7523518	Thanks for watching!
7552233	7552998	and more.
7592800	7593600	and the rest.
7626838	7628163	Thank you for watching!
7672848	7682195	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
7682934	7687037	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
7687057	7688018	Can we talk about that?
7688298	7690659	No subject will ever be taboo.
7690939	7694562	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
7695082	7697644	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
7698144	7703488	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
7704048	7705329	I collect your fucking head.
7707293	7708794	Just like this fucker here.
7709875	7713557	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
7713858	7717220	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
7718160	7724605	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
7725826	7729548	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
7735120	7740302	Yes, everybody has a say here on Orange Lounge Radio, including you guys through our chat room, orangeloungeradio.com.
7740342	7741062	Click on chat.
7741523	7747825	And yes, that promo works again because Jamie is moving Pump Up the Volume to Tuesday night starting this week.
7748945	7753087	Jamie, I know you're over there playing something on Loki's main cabinet.
7753127	7761210	Psycho Soldier, which you can see on our webcam over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
7761230	7762151	Put the mic up to it.
7762231	7763091	It's got DigiDice singing in it.
7764851	7765452	Are we hearing it?
7769773	7770314	You died.
7771134	7773475	So tell us about Pump Up the Volume while you play Psycho Soldier here.
7774115	7776216	Um, I play good music and that's about it.
7776576	7777137	Why are you moving?
7777757	7778677	Because I'm going to school.
7780038	7783139	Alright, so what time on Tuesday nights can we expect to hear your show?
7783739	7787761	Um, I'm supposed to start my pre-show at 7 o'clock so I usually get forward and start it early.
7789082	7790544	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
7805563	7806564	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7835624	7837706	I do miss Vanilla Sky, though.
7837826	7839367	That was a great show for me.
7840308	7840968	I want to bring it back.
7841008	7841348	We'll see.
7841849	7843150	And Loki, you ever going to do anything?
7843230	7845331	Weren't you going to have a game show in 2004?
7845431	7846632	Did that get pushed back to 2005?
7848593	7849834	It got pushed back to 2000.
7849874	7850195	Never.
7851315	7851736	I don't know.
7851776	7852176	We'll see.
7852336	7854017	I'm still running into problems with MAME.
7854057	7856299	I've got to work on my cabinet a little bit.
7856319	7860382	I have to install more RAM because I'm getting lag on some of the keys.
7860422	7863304	And I have to take out Joy to Key and reset all my buttons and stuff.
7866491	7870194	The FU's of the week
7895902	7896903	Oh, this is bad.
7896923	7897403	Here is justice.
7926130	7933176	Big F you goes to work for being busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.
7933976	7935157	And did I say it was busy?
7935538	7936818	It's horrendously busy.
7938260	7941282	And also a big F you goes toward, like,
7943959	7945240	Well, I don't know.
7945341	7952108	It's just that this week I've been too busy to be angsty about things, if you can believe that.
7953049	7957454	I'd have to say another one goes toward people who have big patience issues.
7958735	7962699	I mean, there's some things it's okay to be impatient about, but not driving.
7963874	7967355	You know, do not change lanes when you are about to hit somebody.
7967976	7973938	Like this stupid fucker behind me who was right on my tail the entire time on the freeway today.
7975558	7977139	I just need to get a Humvee.
7977419	7978199	That's all there is to it.
7978680	7981101	I need to drive a Humvee with an assault rifle.
7981661	7982201	Right on the top.
7984204	7986365	and I'll need like a gunner to drive with me.
7987386	7988146	You know, it's eight turns.
7988406	7990587	I'll need a gunner, the person can drive.
7990727	7998271	What was that game with the two, where you and your friend would sit in there and like crash and, it's like Crash and Dance or something.
7998311	7999231	Bucky and Wild.
7999251	7999651	Bucky and Wild.
7999671	8001372	We had one of those at my arcade that I worked at.
8002633	8004534	But yeah, I need something like that.
8005494	8007015	Or I just need like, you know,
8008935	8010275	I'm sure it's very legal too.
8010315	8012916	It is in South Africa, but damn we're not there.
8037304	8039105	I just downloaded Lucky and Wild.
8039546	8040807	You want to know what sucks though?
8041387	8052556	As much as I would love to actually get a real Humvee and, you know, remake it, you know, you actually cannot get a Humvee anymore because they're now ordered to be destroyed due to some contract deal.
8053556	8054237	Doesn't that suck?
8054597	8055518	That's interesting.
8055578	8058520	Yeah, when they're used up, Humvee goes to the scrap heap.
8062043	8063284	Medical records in one of those.
8063764	8064985	Or the military records.
8067793	8072694	For those who didn't hear that whole sentence, Loki said they probably hid Bush's military records in one of those.
8073094	8075294	They couldn't figure out which ones they have to destroy them all.
8077735	8093057	Now, it has to do with when they were put out on the market, there was like some order for them not to be resold, so they were actually, quote, given to a distributor who sold them for the military and got the money back.
8093658	8094658	But that was all.
8094778	8095878	Now they have to all be destroyed.
8098251	8098951	Doesn't that suck?
8098971	8100552	A little bit.
8100572	8102552	I'm still going to get a Humvee one day.
8103613	8104833	I'm going to paint it camo.
8105773	8108174	And put myself a big old gun on top of it.
8109114	8110135	And drive that shit around.
8112175	8114036	I don't care if the gun works, I'm going to have one on there.
8115076	8119497	It's going to be like in Cruisin' World.
8120358	8122298	Where you could drive the Hummer.
8123518	8124059	With the gun.
8124439	8124919	I remember that.
8125822	8131065	It was always either that, the school bus, or the three-wheeled truck that I would use.
8131105	8136369	You talking about Cruise and World makes me think about Nintendo arcade games, which makes me think about how I really want to play Killer Instinct.
8136429	8138350	It still says Ultra 64 on it, isn't that sad?
8138370	8139510	I want to play Killer Instinct.
8139991	8140991	Dude, I love Killer Instinct.
8141031	8142452	Anyway, sorry to interrupt.
8143013	8144534	F you to Killer Instinct for dying.
8145794	8146475	We miss you.
8146715	8147756	Killer Instinct.
8148696	8153059	And F you goes toward Mortal Kombat Annihilation, because I finally saw it.
8154306	8156968	How could a movie that sucks... Welcome to five years ago.
8157789	8160450	I knew it was going to suck, so I just didn't bother seeing it.
8160951	8163633	But Ross made me watch it yesterday.
8164493	8165874	I brought over The Last Samurai.
8165954	8166475	Good movie.
8166515	8168456	You know what you need to play in that main cabinet right now?
8168876	8170718	Street Fighter II, the movie, the game.
8171278	8171818	Ah, no.
8172018	8172579	Hell no.
8172759	8173759	I played that game.
8174199	8177760	That game is the... It is so ass-tastic.
8177900	8178961	You wouldn't even believe.
8179161	8180181	Go back to the chat room for a second.
8180201	8180981	I need to reply to something.
8181041	8185323	The best thing about playing Street Fighter II, the movie, the game, though, is playing as Cammy.
8185563	8192765	To address Anita, you actually cannot buy them army surplus anymore because they have to be destroyed.
8192785	8194506	Okay.
8195546	8197507	People are asking me stuff and I can't read the chat room.
8199147	8200288	Street Fighter 2, The Movie, The Game.
8200308	8200889	They have to see it.
8201750	8203151	I'll relay if there's any other stuff.
8204212	8205293	You'll have to buy your own M60.
8205333	8207135	Okay.
8207776	8208076	Alright.
8208577	8213162	But another SU goes toward how long it's going to take for me to get done with school.
8213602	8216285	Because I'm probably going to be done probably...
8218081	8226323	If I can do it right, 2006, which is going to... I mean, it's an okay thing because that means that I have more time to get in shape and everything.
8227144	8230885	But I'm still planning on going into the Air Force Reserves.
8231245	8233325	So, once I lose a little bit more weight.
8234166	8235146	Okay.
8235666	8238987	But I just didn't want to have to wait another two years instead of one.
8239687	8240788	So it's pissing me off.
8241548	8244268	And another F you to Alabama for being so far away.
8244288	8245849	Because I want to go home.
8247629	8252230	There's certain places that I want to visit, certain places, certain people I want to see.
8252910	8253491	And I'm broke.
8254751	8255651	And I have no time off.
8255711	8256991	I have two days off for the rest of the year.
8257432	8259692	Not counting, though, the one day where I have to go to the dentist.
8260632	8261953	That means I can't get sick.
8262673	8264373	Because I got sick right at the beginning of the year.
8264653	8266934	I had all that surgery and all this other crap.
8267514	8273136	And then also, I need more days off so that I can do other stuff next year that I want to do.
8274256	8274356	And...
8275273	8280411	F you to me having to wait for two weeks to get my laptop because I want it now.
8281414	8283835	See, it's okay to be impatient about getting a laptop.
8284375	8285416	Because your laptops are cool.
8286236	8289858	But I found a pretty one getting this nice Fujitsu with the DVD-R.
8290878	8294100	So I can finally burn off all the crap on my hard drive and reformat.
8294580	8296641	Because I'm going to have to start sharing it with Dan.
8297301	8299502	Because he turned his computer into a main machine.
8299683	8300943	It built into a pole position.
8303324	8304525	You're very angsty tonight.
8304825	8306746	This is the longest you've taken your FUs for a while.
8307166	8307766	For a while.
8308207	8308667	I don't know.
8308687	8310808	I'm just... You know what it is, okay?
8311701	8312622	You're on your period?
8313762	8314303	Shut up!
8314463	8318025	That's just the stock excuse for women being upset.
8319106	8319967	You can just shut up.
8320007	8320627	You know I love you.
8322228	8323729	Yeah, I'd love to kick your ass.
8325791	8329433	Oh my god, this is the worst thing I've ever seen, but he was cute, I have to say.
8329453	8330634	The guy who played you in that movie?
8331394	8332075	He was pretty cute.
8332735	8338079	Oh my god, though, I'm... Is this the Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game?
8339778	8342279	Yeah, I love how they play little clips from the movie and everything.
8342639	8343140	It's awesome.
8343660	8344300	You know what, though?
8344320	8346241	I don't think that it was all that bad.
8348322	8348562	Anyway.
8349263	8353345	I mean, it was, the movie was, the game was actually kind of okay to play.
8353365	8355486	I just thought it was very funny.
8358387	8360768	I hope the chatroom's watching this, because this is damn hilarious.
8360849	8365631	Webcam, moronsoundstrater.com Alright, anyway, any more FUs from Jamie?
8367517	8367937	Excuse me.
8369219	8371621	Um, I have an F.U.
8371681	8377366	to, um, man, just stuff, okay?
8377466	8378207	Just stuff.
8378767	8379748	A big F.U.
8383572	8383932	No.
8384773	8385754	I have an F.U.
8385794	8388836	to, uh, politics and politary.
8390822	8396045	I have a big FU that goes to QRO because they're doing a storage wipe.
8396905	8404349	So that means that I had to spread 78 different individual items among four characters on QRO.
8405189	8408171	And then I tried to freakin' vend so I could get rid of some of my shit.
8409111	8410793	and it wouldn't let me vend.
8410893	8413495	It said, it just wouldn't let, it said, the item's eligible to vend.
8413575	8413755	No.
8413875	8416717	And I had the same items that other people were vending so this is really pissing me off.
8416957	8419639	Like, do I have to have a vending license to vend to this crap?
8419799	8423282	Because I can make so much zenny in that game but no.
8423642	8435612	And then an FU goes toward me not being able to afford to do Final Fantasy XI because I was going to start playing again and also with my laptop I'd be able to keep typing to people while I'm playing Final Fantasy XI but now I can't do it so it's really pissing me off and I'm out of breath.
8435812	8436412	Wow, it's...
8439252	8441234	I'm having to, like, write this all down to follow.
8443016	8450544	I'm, um, and if you do bad tasting, but perfectly textured low-carb cheesecake.
8454468	8454828	What?
8454969	8455389	Any more?
8455649	8456931	I'm waiting.
8456951	8456991	No!
8457231	8458212	All right, then moving on.
8458272	8458713	Loki.
8458953	8459293	Wait.
8459473	8459694	What?
8460325	8466127	Nevermind Let's see who our mystery guest is.
8466167	8467068	Hey Jonas!
8467468	8468968	Oh, just during a spare part of the show too.
8469248	8470649	Alright, let's get to Loki's part.
8472750	8477291	First off, fuck you, the crack whore that tried to cut me off when the lanes were merging.
8477331	8487135	Okay, so I was driving to take my fiance home, okay, and the lanes were merging, we've already established, you know, it's already one lane, and we're just like coming together, you know, to be in parallel.
8487557	8488399	So what does this dumb bitch do?
8488639	8500019	She tries to cut around me, through a double yellow, on the opposite side of the street, like going the wrong direction, cuts through there, and like, passes me up to get behind this really slow guy that's in front of me.
8501724	8502846	I'm like, what the hell?
8502906	8509135	So I flipped her off as I went by, and tried yelling at her, but, you know, she was ahead of me, so she probably couldn't hear me over my music.
8509676	8511879	But, um, yeah, she was a dumb bitch.
8511999	8517307	I normally don't flip people off, I just yell, but this bitch pushed me that far, so, fuck you to her.
8517847	8517948	And...
8518368	8521249	Fuck you the cosplayers that are fucking ugly, okay?
8521450	8524831	If you're a big fat whore, you don't need to be dressing up like an anime character.
8524851	8529553	It doesn't make you hotter, it doesn't make you any cooler, it just makes you ugly and stupid looking.
8530114	8533015	And if you're a hairy man, please don't cosplay, Yuna.
8533956	8538038	Yes, I really, I hate, you know, seeing these ugly ass people cosplaying.
8538338	8540639	We don't need any more ugly people in the world to die.
8540799	8546722	One thing in defense, I think that if you don't have the body to do like the scantily clad animatrix, that's one thing.
8547640	8550100	Last time I checked, um, Yuna didn't have a gut.
8551281	8552641	So, yeah.
8553181	8555261	Anyways, and, oh, and that's another thing.
8555941	8558442	Sailor Fatty, you're not part of the group.
8558882	8559402	So get out.
8559802	8560102	Okay?
8560922	8566883	And, um, also, you know, fuck you, the whole anime thing was just retarded, okay?
8566963	8569324	It was just really a waste of my time.
8569344	8570784	You know, the overcharging stuff.
8571064	8575925	Last time I checked, you know, I don't think baseball cards had anything to do with anime, but, you know, hey, that shit was there, too.
8576825	8576905	Um,
8578328	8587396	And also, just plain, fuck you to my cabinet because for some reason the wheels are starting to push through the bottom, which is not good if I want to move this thing.
8588136	8591779	So it's like on a little pedestal right now, so that kind of sucks.
8592340	8596203	And then, fuck you to the sluts that I saw at the mall.
8596623	8598565	I swear to God, they're just getting younger and younger.
8599906	8601187	Just all these sluts out there.
8601247	8603509	They were never around when I was in, you know, junior high.
8603529	8604329	That really sucks.
8605911	8607212	And that's it.
8610808	8618235	I'm going back to my old FU song because it was better than Bumblebee.
8620157	8625543	FU to Lehigh County in Pennsylvania for being so goddamn boring.
8626303	8631208	Although, you know what, FU to myself for not being more proactive about finding things to do.
8632426	8640752	I think next time when I go back, because I'm going to have to go back eventually, I'll be better prepared for it, because I'm going to look up where I can go nerd out and play DDR and stuff, so I'll have a better time.
8641633	8649779	But they did have one gay bar there, which I went to, and F you to the fact that there were only like 30 people in the whole place, considering this is the only gay bar for like hundreds of miles around town.
8650579	8651320	Whatever, what can you do?
8653821	8657504	Also, I'd like to give an F you for coming home and thinking the TV was stolen.
8659105	8663528	And then realizing that Loki had taken the TV and put it in the machine.
8663588	8663888	What?
8664729	8666089	Yeah, the TV had been liberated.
8666530	8673114	But F you to my future friends' reaction when they come in this house and realize you're going to have to watch movies in an arcade machine.
8674135	8676656	Until we can get something better figured out.
8677917	8678998	I think it's interesting.
8680825	8681526	Very interesting.
8682667	8687291	FU to the fact that... FU to working 10 to 12 hour days, because that gets really old after a while.
8687952	8690694	And FU to being on salary so I don't get overtime for it.
8692276	8692916	And that's about it.
8693957	8694938	That's really all I have to say.
8695339	8697461	I'm always the less angsty one of the bunch.
8698430	8698750	I don't know.
8699231	8705975	Anyway, let's move on and see what our folks in the other folks in the room here have to say angsty tonight.
8705995	8706295	Garrett!
8707996	8711859	Oh, by the way, some FU music tonight brought to us by Ryu Kosaka.
8712519	8714120	Oh, no, I got an FU song.
8714160	8715361	I think it was... No, you get this.
8715461	8716062	You get candy.
8716442	8716842	Oh, damn.
8716942	8717242	Okay.
8717483	8720765	FU this song, even though I like candy.
8722386	8723186	But I got tired of it.
8723667	8724647	Played it out too many times.
8724687	8725088	DDR.
8725368	8725548	Okay.
8726168	8729309	Fuck you starts off with my sister for being the bitch that she is.
8729729	8731130	I haven't seen her in two weeks.
8731650	8738593	And then the minute she walks in the door, she instantly starts being a bitch about everything.
8739933	8743054	But fuck her for making me chase the mailman.
8745575	8759284	Fuck her for lying to me and saying that mom knew she was drinking and that she could have some of my Smirnoff shit that was at my party and leaving it in my mom's room and stuff.
8760745	8761086	Oops.
8761986	8762807	Yeah.
8763187	8764128	Well, I didn't get in trouble for it.
8764148	8764508	She did.
8766919	8771121	Fuck Tower for having such great sales and making me buy even more toys.
8771961	8780244	They had a three day sale this week that was 25% off all their toys and I purchased twice online.
8781525	8782105	Really big.
8784166	8791029	Fuck me for having a crush right now that makes me feel like I'm 16 and the world is going to revolve around it.
8792230	8796696	I think it's fucking ridiculous and I hope I'm just having male PMS or something.
8799439	8804045	Fuck me for being on vacation right now and not knowing what I'm going to do on vacation.
8804346	8807229	I'm getting kind of tired of that right now.
8813523	8818286	Fuck my anal retentiveness and me not being happy with my room and stuff.
8818646	8820767	And I don't really have any more angstiness.
8823148	8824469	Alright, moving on.
8824769	8826090	Bug, do you have any FUs?
8827971	8828431	It's coming.
8828751	8829692	A microphone's coming to you, Bug.
8830666	8833048	mainly just a big ol' FU to my computer for not working.
8834550	8835311	Not the Mac, of course.
8837212	8838053	Next ever break.
8838273	8838894	Nice, nice.
8839535	8839895	Is that it?
8840656	8845861	Uh, well, no, yeah, because everything else I fixed this week, like the car and...
8847277	8847497	All right.
8847517	8849018	Picking somebody up at the airport at 2 a.m.
8849118	8849438	Shut up.
8850058	8850698	All right.
8850838	8851238	F you, buddy.
8851598	8851938	All right.
8853178	8856559	Let's go to Jonas, who showed up during the original angst there.
8856579	8857319	How you doing?
8857419	8860420	Also known as Explicit with the triple X. Yeah.
8860820	8861360	All right.
8861380	8861700	What's up?
8862580	8863260	Not much.
8863580	8864921	Should I just put my F yous right now?
8865101	8865481	Yeah.
8865521	8865921	Get them out.
8866521	8867041	Okay.
8867101	8868321	Remember, it's a three-hour show.
8868341	8869162	Don't worry.
8869242	8871142	I don't have that many F yous this time.
8872728	8875531	Yeah, we gotta turn, you gotta back your mic up a little bit.
8876052	8877594	Oh, is it really that loud?
8877694	8878475	Yes, yes it is.
8878960	8880742	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay.
8881582	8884084	F you to me for being long last minute this whole week.
8884985	8888428	God, showing up to work like 15 minutes late is not good.
8890730	8894573	Okay, and since I've, anybody heard about the Biggest Field California Tournament?
8895754	8895994	No.
8896815	8897255	What's this?
8897395	8906823	Good, because I went to hell, so I'm going to give an F you to some of the organizers for not taking, looking up how tournaments are supposed to be run.
8907964	8911108	Because you know how tournaments are done by PA, right?
8911268	8912049	They did it by score.
8914409	8914769	Oh dear.
8915290	8922274	Yeah, there's a lot of problems with that, and they're not taking constructive criticism from other people, which is another bad thing.
8922294	8923115	That's not a good sign.
8923475	8927398	They think it's all good and everything, but there are some flaws that they should listen to.
8929439	8935183	On the other hand, F you to certain people who try to ruin a tournament for two hours.
8935483	8938145	I heard rumors about a two-hour delay on that tournament.
8939106	8943269	I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'll say F you to whoever screwed up my tournament.
8944249	8951676	Even though I heard rumors that he was in Zuma at 4-6-9, the one who did the same thing to my tournament, if that's true, he's banned out of my tournament.
8952436	8956119	I'm serious, because nobody should be banning a tournament for that long.
8956700	8958562	Screwing a tournament for two hours is not fun.
8958922	8965488	Especially when people have to drive all the way back from San Francisco, California, or Fresno, or even SoCal.
8966772	8971916	Just to go to the tournament, then later on getting delayed for a whole lot and getting pissed off because of all the blah, blah, blah.
8971976	8973117	Wah, wah, wah.
8973717	8974938	Wah, my pussy hurts.
8974998	8975499	Wah.
8975719	8976579	Yeah, damn pussy.
8977160	8977760	Here's the thing.
8977800	8979001	Get this right, you guys.
8979522	8981623	If you don't like the rules of the tournament, don't go.
8981723	8982624	It's simple as that.
8982704	8986367	If you go to the tournament and you know the rules are fucked up, and you go, you're going to argue.
8986587	8987708	You're just causing some trouble.
8990089	8991110	Now, what would you rather do?
8991771	8993232	Would you do something like that, Dumb Sky?
8993252	8993292	Oh.
8994432	9002419	No, but I'll probably... Sacramento's so sad now at Bomani, I'm probably not even going to ever run a tournament or even help run a tournament ever again, so we'll see.
9002560	9006463	I mean, I'll still run tournaments, regardless of what's going on and stuff.
9007244	9009306	But I would never run one by score, that's for sure.
9009546	9010447	I know, that's one thing.
9010687	9011748	Never run by score.
9013930	9014531	Let's see.
9015071	9018394	F you to squirrels for eating my damn food from camping.
9019876	9020116	I don't...
9021092	9028256	Seeing a bunch of spit all over the damn steak that I've cooked for two hours and shit is not good.
9029117	9034960	Therefore, even though I whipped the living shit out of those squirrels, I'm not sure if you all saw this whip right here.
9034980	9037541	Did you borrow that from Erin?
9038082	9039322	No, this is mine, dammit.
9039362	9041484	I told you that I have my own whip.
9042064	9043505	You should have showed Erin this whip.
9043545	9044585	I'm not sure if she's interested.
9047737	9051761	And F you for getting bit by...bent the ass by ants during camping.
9055664	9057205	No fucking comment on that one.
9057325	9061469	And F you for losing my toothbrush during camping.
9062430	9064271	Not brushing your teeth for two days sucks.
9064411	9068215	Speaking of that, I saw a bear during camping.
9069352	9070032	Did you see Bigfoot?
9070592	9071553	Yes, I saw Bigfoot.
9071573	9072233	I did not get eaten.
9072253	9078035	He was just walking around sniffing on those pussies and stuff.
9078115	9078595	Okay.
9078615	9081876	Was he pussyfooting around?
9081936	9083797	Yes, he was pussyfooting around.
9086998	9095329	and Effie for the horse for fucking sweeping the tail that he took a shit on in the back of my shirt.
9095349	9096370	That was gross.
9098032	9100115	You don't wag your tail with all that shit in your...
9102117	9103758	Okay, I'm cutting you off, buddy.
9105359	9105900	Yeah, Garrett.
9106400	9106800	Okay.
9106980	9108101	I have one last major F you.
9108501	9112564	F you to my dog for having to fucking dog sit it while my parents were gone.
9112624	9116927	I had to wake up to that fucking garbage disposal vomiting peach pits one morning.
9118888	9119868	Alright, anything else?
9119989	9121209	Okay, that's all for now.
9121349	9121990	Alright, alright.
9122010	9123491	Told you it was going to be a three hour show, but...
9124523	9127964	Alright, let's move on to chatroom FUs.
9128064	9130585	Brought to us, the music is Dive Into the Night.
9130685	9131605	Camera nudity.
9131725	9132546	Camera nudity.
9132566	9132906	Camera nudity.
9133566	9134346	What's the nudity?
9134707	9136007	What's the nudity on camera now?
9138728	9139028	Nice.
9139928	9140789	What game is that?
9141789	9143269	Is that Gals Panic on the camera?
9146210	9148151	The cam's over at orangelonradio.com.
9151632	9152873	These guys are crazy.
9156949	9158910	Yeah, like, it's supposed to be, like, the Zonk stage.
9160051	9161092	Anyway, moving on.
9161772	9165675	Uh, let's go and, uh, let's see what our chatroom FUs have to say.
9166295	9175361	Uh, Dark Knight says, uh, FU to Rain, Rain, Rain, nothing but rain all week long, another being a broke-ass person yet again, and a final FU to not having no car.
9176282	9176582	Alright.
9177062	9179604	Uh, Dork wants to say an FU to myself.
9180064	9180205	Aww.
9180985	9181465	How sad.
9181485	9185048	Uh, Yaki Tora, I hope I pronounced that right.
9185388	9186629	Yaki, actually, it's probably Yaki.
9188170	9189472	I'm white, okay.
9189512	9194917	Just says, I want to send my FUs to the Kroger company because they love to fuck up people's paycheck.
9195738	9195998	Ouch.
9198781	9199822	That's a grocery store change.
9199922	9200863	Oh, okay, that's right, it is.
9202168	9202708	Oh, they're Ralphs.
9202788	9203488	Oh, they're Ralphs on here.
9203548	9204108	Okay.
9204168	9209089	StupidBaka says, wants to know if we do the FUs over PM or Skype.
9209389	9213010	PM, we don't let people do them over Skype or else they'd go on as long as Jonas does.
9213490	9213810	Alright.
9217591	9221272	DarkLionXPI says, only one FU tonight.
9221432	9227053	FU to the little blonde girl who broke my concentration while playing Paranoia Survivor on DDR Gameworks yesterday.
9227413	9229456	She moved in front of me like not knowing I was there.
9229756	9233441	People like those piss me off the most and I just wanna hurt them physically so bad!
9234738	9238081	Panda says, F you to my hair for wanting to style itself every morning.
9240082	9243725	And John Fields says, F you to getting food poisoning.
9244106	9245907	F you to no one calling me back for a job.
9245927	9249670	F you fake gamers who ruin competitive games for everyone else.
9250030	9254314	Super Metroid died today because of one of these runs.
9254714	9259238	Blown away by an emulator, the real time of 55 minutes taking down to 47 minutes.
9261340	9261720	Interesting.
9263743	9271926	Alright, DDRholic says, F you to Jason for taking off for some unknown period of time and not even talking to me about it.
9272646	9274787	F you for taking things that I say to the extreme.
9277728	9277988	Uh-oh.
9280529	9282469	I didn't see the message not to repost.
9284770	9285751	I just got someone in trouble.
9287271	9289652	I think she was only, like, kind of, like, joking with those.
9291877	9296863	Don't send me FUs unless you mean it, because honestly, since the way I get the FUs, I can't.
9296943	9300328	If you tell me don't read this or something, then I don't see it.
9300388	9302070	So sorry, guys.
9302150	9304273	Sharkskrull says, FU to the village.
9304833	9306556	I won't ruin it for everyone, but it sucked.
9306636	9308158	I want that two hours of my life back.
9308178	9309279	Hey, that movie was awesome!
9319909	9321971	This is the best news you've seen in a long time.
9322672	9328677	Alright, VidPOWER says, F you to the whole www.ilovebees.com hype for Halo 2.
9329438	9330659	It's boggling my mind.
9331020	9332881	What is ilovebees.com?
9338046	9339187	I can't hear you, bug.
9340468	9341850	I can't hear Loki either, amazing.
9348064	9350006	It's alternate reality gaming, I think.
9351028	9351728	That site.
9352489	9353090	That sucks.
9354772	9355633	More nudity on the cam.
9355813	9356274	Okay, anyways.
9360378	9360759	Alright.
9365783	9377707	Okay, uh, gosh, let's see, I guess at this time we're going to go to another break, and then we're going to come back and, what do you guys want to do, you want to do some Ask Orange Lounge, or do we have, alright, sure, why not, we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9378427	9379167	On the Skype line.
9379567	9385349	Yeah, we'll do, we'll open up the Skype line if folks, and we'll open up the Skype lines for comments as well, and some Ask Orange Lounge to close out the show.
9385729	9390191	Meanwhile, I'm going to pick some songs that sound cool for the Poppin' 11 soundtrack, I'm going to pick some on my own.
9390731	9393013	Because I know I want to play the Orange Airport song.
9393093	9393913	I definitely want to play that.
9394034	9395014	The Orange Lounge song.
9395675	9401339	I'm going to play that one because it's called Space Dog.
9401719	9402300	Oh, and it's Sana.
9402360	9402580	Cool.
9402620	9403601	I didn't even know that.
9404141	9414009	And I'll play... Okay, then I'm going to go back to number one and get some of the shorter ones.
9414429	9418392	Let's do... Wow, that has a really... Oh, we already heard that one.
9419153	9419273	Um...
9421232	9421993	I don't know, what do you think?
9423994	9425335	Hillbilly, I want to hear Hillbilly.
9427456	9428377	Alright, we're going to do Hillbilly.
9429317	9432019	Okay, so these are the songs I'm going to play this break from Poppin' Music 11.
9432259	9439925	We're going to hear Orange Lounge with Orange Airline, Sauna with Space Dog, and Taisho in the Hillbilly genre with Pa La La 42.
9440325	9441826	This should be interesting.
9443127	9447270	Send your questions in for Ask Orange Lounge, and then we're going to wrap up the show when we come back.
9447470	9447710	Enjoy.
9454262	9455412	Thank you for watching!
9561387	9564169	Hello, Pedro, I'm a play-store, to run a story over stars.
9596514	9597876	Thank you for watching!
9629734	9631595	Thank you for watching!
9658952	9660693	and the rest of the cast.
9713066	9721132	Kodou ga kurui datu Nobichiru Candy Corral Aimai na kotoba metato Kimi ga Rhythm
9737605	9750914	Pararara, so kanda mo itsumo karanmamori de Kauzen na koi wo kizumo tomerare demo Pararara, ima wa nanimo dekinai kedo Yume no tsuzuki nara pra pra pra pra
9772891	9773633	Thanks for watching!
9798192	9802055	Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.
9817591	9818672	Ask Orange Lounge
9837065	9840007	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9840507	9843810	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9844530	9845731	I know I have a question.
9846111	9847452	One thing I want to find out.
9848093	9851295	Why is Loki playing a game where guys are shaving other guys?
9858140	9862103	Question number one comes from StupidBaka.
9863144	9864745	Where did you go when you were out of town?
9865968	9871189	I went to Allentown, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour north of Philadelphia.
9872350	9874290	And it's very green out there.
9874530	9877471	And there's a restaurant called Friendly's, which was cute.
9878371	9879852	Which I think is actually a chain out there.
9879892	9880232	I don't know.
9880272	9884633	I'm so... Like, there's probably East Coast people listening to this show going, nothing special.
9884653	9888834	The last time I was on the East Coast, there was that Roy Rogers place that was utter crap.
9888954	9892075	I went to Cracker Barrel, and that place... Cracker Barrel owns...
9893672	9898595	And I have clove candy sticks from Cracker Barrel in my room, because they got me some as a going away present.
9899195	9903478	Thank you so much to the folks, I know that of course they would never listen to the show, but the folks out there were so good to me.
9903758	9909041	I mean, they made that town bearable, honestly, and they bought me gifts and stuff, so that was great.
9909101	9913444	StupidBanca also wants to know, and I can't believe somebody's asking this, but what is MAME?
9914564	9914845	What?
9916285	9918186	It's a multi-arcade machine emulator.
9918227	9922229	Caller, hold on a minute, I'll get to you in a minute, but what is MAME, is the person wants to know.
9925037	9925678	Oh, they hung up.
9926158	9926418	Oh well.
9927680	9928500	What is MAME?
9928741	9931483	The Multi Arcade Machine Emulator.
9934286	9934986	And what does it do?
9936588	9939971	It emulates multiple arcade machines.
9941793	9941953	Alright.
9942333	9943094	It's good stuff though.
9944155	9946057	I'm going to call the person back that just called us.
9953965	9955066	Aw, it says he's busy now.
9955386	9956026	What's up with that?
9958328	9958708	All right.
9960329	9961189	We'll see if he calls back.
9963811	9965872	Moving on, we'll go to number two question.
9968213	9969094	Number two question.
9970254	9973496	Yaki wants to know, or Yaki Tora, or maybe it's just Tora, I don't know.
9973856	9974577	Here's a question.
9974917	9976898	Why is Jamie so damn angsty tonight?
9977358	9979680	Her rants were as long as the horror of the village.
9980834	9982075	The Village was good!
9983417	9990966	I can't help it if the majority of people who saw that movie didn't stop to think about it, but still, it was a very good movie, okay?
9991446	9993529	Alright, well moving on, why are you so angsty?
9993549	9994770	Is that why you're so angsty?
9995211	9997894	No, I'm angsty for other, other reasons.
10000911	10001271	Many of them.
10001291	10001852	Personal reasons.
10002372	10003033	Many reasons.
10003273	10004494	Many reasons.
10004574	10005895	It's okay to be angry once in a while.
10005915	10009358	It's this time of year is when I get really horribly angsty like that.
10009418	10016103	Which is weird because with me, I'm... Tora would just like to point out they've actually never seen The Village.
10016143	10017524	They were just saying that to ruffle some feathers.
10017785	10018785	Well then go see it.
10020086	10021227	It's a good movie.
10022609	10023049	All right.
10023429	10025330	It was not just a good movie.
10025370	10026370	It was an excellent movie.
10026450	10027170	It was a movie.
10027751	10030711	It was a very smart movie, okay?
10031092	10035433	Shark Scroll says, I thought about the movie, and I still thought it sucked.
10038634	10040954	Then you obviously didn't watch it with the right frame of mind.
10041575	10041855	Well.
10042655	10044375	It wasn't intended to scare.
10045076	10049357	I think it's getting mixed reviews, so it's probably just getting mixed feedback from everybody, you know?
10050180	10051120	It wasn't scary.
10051160	10052061	It was very good.
10052101	10054461	It was the type of movie I was right in the mood to see.
10054781	10061763	I don't see, but now I'm kind of like, I've heard so many negative things, but I've heard some good things, but I'm kind of like, now maybe I'll wait for video.
10061823	10062524	I don't know.
10062924	10066425	Okay, Rob, you are going to go see it with me, and I'm going to pay for you to see it.
10067332	10068372	Well, hey, free movie!
10068933	10070433	Alright, I'll let you guys know what I thought.
10070473	10071654	We'll see.
10072834	10074975	Alright, moving on.
10077436	10077916	Let's see.
10079937	10080917	I got his questions.
10081577	10082178	Kyle!
10082518	10090381	Our old buddy Kyle Snyder wants to know, I've decided that for the next few songs I want to work on, I want to move away from techno and trance.
10091081	10096344	Would you want me to work on some genres that involve vocals, like house, two-step, and jazz?
10096905	10102969	Or should I do some non-vocal genres, like drum and bass, progressive, and big beat?
10103469	10104970	I would love to hear some drum and bass.
10105930	10106971	I like drum and bass, too.
10107031	10109313	But I would like to hear some two-step from Kyle, actually.
10109333	10110173	I think that would be kind of cool.
10113735	10114816	That would be kind of neat, I think.
10115917	10116237	We'll see.
10118405	10118685	All right.
10119465	10121246	But I guess, does anybody else have any feedback?
10122846	10123086	Anybody?
10123246	10123506	Anybody?
10124106	10124326	All right.
10124567	10124867	Fine.
10125627	10126367	Keep it to yourselves.
10128127	10131368	DDRholic wants to know, do you still love me, Rob?
10131388	10133909	And the answer is yes.
10136149	10139170	Just like Whitney Houston, I will always love you.
10141551	10143891	That was my rendition of Whitney.
10144872	10145892	I've been moved, Rob.
10146392	10146612	I know.
10147270	10148551	At least my stomach moved a little.
10151934	10152574	Let's see.
10154276	10157819	Somebody in the chatroom wants to say, what is Two-Step exactly?
10158860	10159940	What is Two-Step exactly?
10160261	10163203	Play some... I would say like Jack and Mark Get Busy.
10163263	10164004	Distant Sounds.
10165598	10167160	You know what's the funny thing about two-step?
10169362	10172526	British people claim they're the only people who can make two-step.
10173367	10180295	Just like they can only make trip-hop, because we're just supposed to be making down-tempo, because there's supposed to be a difference.
10184399	10184760	Yeah.
10186482	10189283	All right, Skype line is still open if you want to give us a call.
10190083	10192484	We'll see if anybody wants to call.
10193484	10195004	Oh, but in the meantime, we have another question.
10195585	10201346	Vid Palace says, Speaking of MAME, what is your favorite classic arcade Konami game?
10201926	10203107	Mine is The Simpsons.
10203247	10204147	Ooh, this is a good question.
10204287	10205327	Super Konami World.
10205447	10206608	We're all a bunch of Konami whores.
10206628	10207468	Super Konami World.
10207528	10208368	What's that one all about?
10208868	10211309	It was a game where they took a bunch of...
10212985	10217848	other Konami games made them into one game like these two people made it into the Konami universe or something.
10218408	10219168	There were two of them.
10219308	10220109	They were kind of fun.
10222050	10227572	Now that I think about it, I think they came out on the Famicom too, way back when.
10229934	10231154	Anybody else care to answer this one?
10232015	10232335	Bugged.
10232695	10233395	Oh, I'm sorry.
10233675	10234116	Yes, Jamie?
10234376	10234776	Twinbee.
10235216	10235917	Twinbee.
10236217	10236497	Oh, okay.
10237437	10237697	Bugged.
10239558	10240759	Stop standing on the cable.
10243123	10264022	it's hazardous for us both I can't stand the symptoms because I worked at a place that had it for two years and that's all I would hear every day was Bart and Lisa screaming like when they do that thing when they're running through it and that's when it sounded like a screaming baby yes, when I worked at Mountain Mike's do they have any shoot-em-ups?
10265543	10269507	my favorite classic, and I'm going back to classic, classic Konami arcade game
10270689	10274650	Motherfuckin' Time Pilot is my favorite classic arcade game by Konami.
10274710	10275350	Time Pilot.
10275810	10277331	Gradius, uh, what was the second one?
10277351	10277831	Life Force?
10278171	10287834	Gradius... It was Life Force on the NES in America, but it was Salamander in Arcade Japan.
10289074	10290374	I didn't go to the Arcade in Japan.
10291315	10292835	I just played it on the NES.
10293195	10294175	Yeah, Life Force is cool.
10295236	10295516	Alrighty.
10296956	10297136	No.
10298717	10299817	I don't care if you're the motherfuckin' host.
10301678	10303699	Ooh, Bugged and DarkSakura are having a fight.
10306101	10307642	But you're holding your hand like it's a gun.
10311124	10312625	I'll give her my mic if you're not careful.
10315747	10316388	Parodius.
10317528	10319870	Actually, specifically, Oshaberry Parodius.
10322031	10323552	Garrett, I know you're a big Konami whore.
10323592	10326334	What other Konami arcade game classic ones are your favorites?
10327270	10330551	I never really got to play a lot of arcade games when I was a kid.
10330591	10332392	The ones I did play, I don't remember who made them.
10333712	10334693	Yeah, it's kind of sad.
10335893	10337333	And somebody did say Pervious.
10337674	10343215	Just say, just say like, I don't know, what else was Konami?
10343235	10344996	I'm trying to think of the old school Konami games.
10345016	10348077	I can only think of... Track and Field, just say Track and Field.
10348717	10350018	I love Track and Field!
10350278	10352078	I can only think of the damn Capcom fighting games.
10353099	10353459	Alright.
10354380	10355541	They actually have a lot of games.
10355681	10358262	Like, I think Konami was involved with Frogger at one point.
10359043	10362785	But all I know is they didn't make BurgerTime, so, sorry guys.
10362885	10364225	More questions from our chatroom.
10364546	10368548	EvilNauki2DX wants to know, he just said, I have a question.
10368608	10368988	Oh, here it is.
10369468	10373651	What is that game being played on the webcam right now with all the naked anime ladies?
10374651	10375492	It's Gal's Panic.
10375552	10377793	It's simply just Gal's Panic.
10378173	10379754	Not Gal's Panic 95 or anything like that?
10379774	10379814	No.
10382964	10386427	Loki says, Galspanic Super S2 is the one he's playing right now.
10387147	10388948	So, uh... And it's beating his ass.
10390049	10392011	He's on a really advanced stage at this point, isn't he?
10393492	10393812	I don't know.
10394172	10394493	We'll see.
10395253	10395573	Alright.
10397475	10407282	Um... I guess, uh, at this point, it's almost time to kind of wrap up the show, but I was hoping that somebody would call in on the Skype line, but we didn't get anybody!
10408623	10409023	Boo!
10409544	10410084	Boo to that.
10410404	10411225	Nobody has a question.
10412995	10415479	I cry.
10415499	10416340	I see how it is.
10417762	10419585	Alright.
10421047	10423130	I'm trying to see how long the fortune cookie is tonight.
10423150	10424032	I think it's a longer one.
10424613	10425073	Yeah, it is.
10426355	10428759	So we'll probably start to wrap up the show here.
10429468	10431089	since nobody's calling us on the Skype line.
10434772	10436673	I guess let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10436693	10438514	I'm going to shut off the Skype line since nobody's using it.
10439114	10441256	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10441296	10444158	Thank you very much for those that participated in tonight's Ask Orange Lounge.
10444598	10446179	Meanwhile, final thoughts time.
10449021	10450042	Bugged, final thought.
10452904	10455105	Thank you, that was lovely.
10455205	10456526	Final thought from Jonas.
10457267	10457627	Jonas.
10460987	10461768	Sucks to be late.
10462430	10464974	Are you here to plug anything tonight since you were late?
10464994	10466536	Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?
10468159	10469021	Well, not really.
10469301	10472647	School's about to start soon and a state fair is coming up soon.
10475046	10475727	That's practically all.
10475767	10476567	That's practically all.
10476587	10477688	Alright.
10478929	10483412	Uh, I thought maybe you had like a, a tourney or a sim file or something, but I- Oh!
10483492	10489017	Well, I do have- I'm supposed to release Alpha Nova Vengeance, the one that Loki was asking for me to download.
10489037	10490898	Did somebody already do that?
10490918	10491058	Yeah.
10491118	10500065	I checked the sim file itself, it's not really that great to download, if you're in- if it's- because the sim file that I made was a little too repetitive.
10501061	10503202	and Inconsistent pattern-wise.
10504062	10504342	Alright.
10504602	10507863	Because me and MJ are supposed to make the sim file by now.
10508704	10511525	I'm not sure if Loki... Loki, didn't you say you wanted to do the background?
10511545	10514145	Nah, you can do whatever.
10514726	10514846	Okay.
10514866	10515846	Okay, I guess I'll do it.
10518147	10518567	Alright.
10518847	10519207	Alright.
10520568	10521508	Garrett, your final thought.
10521528	10523989	Thanks for coming tonight, by the way, and bringing us poppin' music stuff.
10524089	10524649	What's your final thought?
10526009	10526530	Hmm...
10530390	10531210	Very well said.
10532251	10533231	Loki, your final thought.
10535352	10537172	I want animal cookies and there's none left.
10537612	10539873	There's crumbs.
10541774	10547656	My final thought is Irish car bombs make my stomach sad, but they were very good.
10547696	10547856	Jamie.
10547876	10547976	Jamie.
10556064	10559105	My final thought is I'm going to go home and have some ice cream.
10561005	10562226	Mmm, ice cream.
10563206	10564126	Mmm, ice cream is good.
10565106	10567547	Okay, final word of the show tonight.
10567767	10569428	I'm going to give it to Garrett.
10569568	10570708	You can have the final word of tonight's show.
10570728	10571288	What do you want to say?
10572548	10573569	That's why I said home.
10573629	10574169	I don't know.
10576029	10576349	One word.
10580911	10581451	Ligament.
10581491	10581831	I don't know.
10582856	10585797	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10586358	10589699	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
10590299	10595542	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
10595762	10606247	If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10607384	10608264	I love to smoke.
10608965	10610825	I love to smoke and I love to eat red meat.
10610865	10612606	I love to eat raw fucking red meat.
10612826	10616547	Nothing I like better than sucking down a hot steaming cheeseburger and a butt at the same time.
10616728	10617268	I love to smoke.
10617308	10620429	I love to eat red meat and only eat red meat that comes from cows who smoke, okay?
10621369	10624710	Special cows they grow in Virginia with voice boxes in their necks.
10627151	10628212	I tried eating vegetarian.
10628232	10629632	I feel like a wimp going into a restaurant.
10629652	10630433	What do you want to eat, sir?
10630693	10631153	Broccoli?
10632276	10633577	Broccoli's the side dish, folks.
10633697	10635318	Always was, always will be, okay?
10635798	10637619	When they ask me what I want to say, what do you think I want?
10637659	10638139	This is America.
10638179	10639560	I want a bowl of raw red meat right now.
10639760	10640400	Forget about that.
10640580	10642582	Bring me a live cow over to the table.
10642942	10646384	I'll carve off what I want and ride the rest.
10646504	10650526	I'm going to open my own place.
10651126	10652687	Open my own restaurant and get away from you people.
10652707	10656469	I'm going to open my own restaurant with two smoking sections, ultra and regular, okay?
10657668	10675116	and we're not going to have any tables or any chairs or any napkins, none of that pussy shit, just a big wide open black space and all we're going to serve is raw meat right on the bone and only men are going to eat their naked men sitting around a big giant campfire and no men's room either, you have to piss, you mark your territory like a wolf and if some guy has a heart attack from eating too much meat, fuck him, we throw him in the fire more meat for the other meat eaters, yeah!
10677877	10678858	because you've got to have goals
10681161	10683502	Because everybody in this room knows everybody who's quitting me.
10683522	10684763	You don't have that friend who's quitting you.
10684783	10685183	You know what I mean?
10685203	10685923	The guy's quitting everything.
10685943	10686424	I quit smoking.
10686444	10686984	I quit drugs.
10687264	10687784	I quit drinking.
10687824	10689205	I quit meeting out here.
10689745	10691226	I get up in the morning with a nice big bowl of oat bran.
10691266	10692527	I go to the bathroom for three and a half hours.
10693567	10694588	I have another bowl of oat bran.
10694608	10696289	I go back in the bathroom for six more hours.
10696369	10697729	All I do is eat and shit.
10698069	10699110	I'm going to live forever.
10699370	10702452	My colon is the strongest muscle in my body right now.
10702892	10705073	I could pass Elvis through my colon right now.
10707259	10731577	And all these cereals they have, crackling oat bran and horking fiber chunks, you know Cereal used to come with free prizes, now it comes with a free roll of toilet paper in every box Guys get up on Sunday morning, forget about the New York Times, I'm gonna need the Bible, I got a big one brewing here Dad, there's a phone call, I'm on Genesis, goddammit You tell them to call back after the creation People checking their own feces for fiber, you have too much free fucking time on your hands, okay?
10735467	10738588	Red meat, white meat, blue meat, meat, oh fucking Ranma, you will eat it!
10739108	10741849	Because not eating meat is a decision, eating meat is an instinct!
10742629	10743809	Yeah, and I know what it's about!
10744169	10746410	I don't want to eat the meat because I love the animals!
10747850	10748691	I love the animals!
10748731	10749591	Hey, I love the animals too!
10749611	10750771	I love my dog, he's so cute!
10750991	10751931	My lovely little dog!
10752652	10753312	He's so cute!
10753332	10754012	There's the problem.
10754232	10756273	We only want to save the cute animals, don't we?
10756313	10756533	Yeah.
10756813	10760694	Why don't we just have animal auditions, line them up one by one, and interview them individually.
10760734	10761094	What are you?
10761274	10761714	I'm an otter.
10762739	10763199	And what do you do?
10763219	10771063	I swim around my back and do cute little human things with my hand You're free to go And what are you?
10771183	10773565	I'm a cow, get in the fucking truck, okay pal?
10773965	10786151	But I'm an animal, you're a baseball glove, get out of that truck I'm an animal, I have rights here, here's your fucking cousin, get out of the truck pal We kill the cows to make jackets out of them and then we kill each other for the jackets we made out of the cows
10787702	10791785	You will eat the meat, folks, because this country was founded on two things, meat and war.
10791825	10793486	You eat enough fucking meat, you want to kill somebody.
10793506	10794306	That's the way it works.
10794827	10797288	That was the ultimate American dream for me during that Persian Gulf War.
10797308	10803693	I was sitting in my living room naked with a can of Budweiser and a three-inch steak watching the war live on TV.
10804113	10807015	I had a six-foot erection with a giant cheeseburger on the end of it.
10808055	10812658	I ate so much meat during the war, by the time it was over, three weeks later, I was like, no, no, no, we need to keep fighting.
10812919	10814740	Make a couple of stops on our way home from the Persian Gulf.
10815518	10816899	First stop, Vietnam.
10816919	10818600	Surprise the fuck out of those people, huh?
10819561	10820521	Did you make a movie?
10820541	10821482	Not this time, pal.
10824544	10843395	Personally, I think Mama Cass said it best when she said... All the leaves are... Monday...
10851566	10855292	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
10874585	10876093	Thank you for watching!
10879986	10882308	The Afterbirth The Afterbirth The Afterbirth
10908976	10909957	I know, I know.
10910797	10912318	Aw, it's naked with a horse.
10912478	10918982	One of our Orange Lounge buddies wanted us to call them while we had a chance here over the Skype line, so I'm going to go ahead and give her a call here.
10919043	10919743	Hopefully it'll work.
10921524	10922245	Let's see if it works.
10922285	10924206	I'm going to see if she answers.
10930430	10931891	Please answer.
10933532	10933972	Dope.
10934472	10935853	Problem with remote sound device.
10935913	10936534	Oh, that sucks.
10937745	10941186	Well, I'll open up the Skype line for an afterbirth call if somebody wants to call us.
10941246	10941666	We'll see.
10942106	10945227	Otherwise, what are your big plans for this next week?
10945447	10946388	Anything exciting?
10946928	10952349	Well, I'm going to try to slack off as much as possible except for gym time.
10954190	10955710	I need to work out this week really bad.
10956190	10962172	I'm planning on going to the gym actually as much as I can during the next couple weeks.
10963432	10965193	Actually, when I start school, I'm going to start running.
10966767	10970109	I'll be at ARC Monday and Wednesday, so I'll just go running.
10970929	10971610	Or play DDR.
10975112	10979734	I really should sign up for a gym, because I think I'd actually maybe use a gym membership if I was paying for it.
10979814	10980655	Sign up for my gym.
10981175	10983316	You go to Family Fitness, right?
10983356	10983537	Yep.
10983997	10985217	That's the one I would probably sign up with.
10985237	10986198	They're everywhere.
10986938	10987899	In this area, yeah.
10989320	10989720	We'll see.
10989800	10994903	The hotel I was at had a gym thing at it, but I was just too lazy to go.
10996257	10996757	www.DarkSakura.com
11015680	11016401	That's not a bad idea.
11016421	11018222	That's what I did when I went to E3.
11018402	11019203	I have my weights with me.
11019483	11019883	Okay.
11020944	11022525	I hope we get to go to E3 again next year.
11022545	11023666	That would be blissful.
11024387	11024887	We'll get to go.
11025928	11026288	I'll be there.
11027209	11028470	Alright, we're getting a call.
11028510	11029051	Hooray.
11030932	11032914	You are on Orange Lounge Radio after birth.
11034233	11035434	I joined a gym.
11037536	11037816	Why?
11037856	11039017	Are you calling me fat?
11040098	11041359	No, I'm messing with you, man.
11041719	11047364	No, it's a good thing to join a gym, but at the same time, your first week you're going to be in pain.
11048004	11048505	I know.
11048625	11049926	I've kind of worked out before.
11050246	11052028	Couldn't I just play DDR?
11052568	11054530	Well, no, start off on the cardio, seriously.
11054550	11055871	It's the easiest thing to start with.
11056951	11059794	But the weight training, the first night I did weight training,
11061152	11064315	I could not move my arms for like five days.
11064876	11067178	I was so sore.
11067259	11069621	I want to join one that has a big pool so I could swim.
11069661	11071223	The one by my house has a pool.
11071963	11073085	You need to come to spin with me.
11074326	11075868	Didn't you say that spin kicks your ass?
11076248	11079191	It did the first couple times, but they let you take it easy the first time around.
11079371	11079852	We'll see.
11079972	11081634	You're a Jamie Yeti dude.
11081774	11082474	Do you go to a gym?
11083519	11084139	Yeah, I do.
11084219	11086080	I've recently joined one like about a week ago.
11086220	11087101	And has it been effective?
11087201	11089162	You got washboard abs and muscles now?
11090262	11091223	Too early to say.
11092183	11092704	Pretty soon.
11092804	11093544	Soon though, right?
11098427	11098987	Soon enough.
11099467	11099867	All right.
11100127	11102469	Well, I needed that, so thank you for yelling at me.
11102509	11102989	I needed it.
11103549	11104149	No problem, man.
11104169	11104390	Later.
11104510	11104770	All right.
11104790	11104990	Later.
11107868	11110109	Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Afterbirth.
11110130	11111931	Thank you guys for tuning in and supporting Orange Laws Radio.
11112531	11113752	Tomorrow night, Diversion.
11113792	11115513	Don't forget, we're doing a little bit of a schedule switch.
11115593	11116313	It's going to be permanent.
11116774	11120016	Diversion will now be on Monday nights to accommodate Jamie going back to school.
11120336	11122857	She will be doing Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night.
11123298	11124298	So definitely tune in.
11124638	11127380	And then Wednesday nights, who knows what will happen soon.
11127460	11134364	People have to put up with me bitching about school now because I'm having to take... The classes that I'm actually taking in a classroom are Business Law.
11135505	11151731	which is my Monday and Wednesday class which is going to suck ass and my other class is going to be Intro to Windows on Saturday because I can't test out of it because I don't have time to make it to the damn test because I don't have the days off you're going to be stuck doing it for a whole semester
11152349	11152929	Half semester.
11153750	11155431	Which is one good thing, it's half semester.
11156012	11161076	And I'm thinking about telling my teacher, excuse me, I know all this shit.
11161296	11162557	Can't you challenge the course?
11162957	11165059	Well, I can, I can test out of it.
11166160	11169462	But I figured at the very least it would be easy A and get me started.
11169502	11170623	I guess that's a true point.
11170663	11174806	It's on a Saturday though, so I can, since I'll have my laptop, I'll just play on the internet during class.
11174986	11175967	Play Ragnarok or something.
11177028	11177448	Seriously?
11177588	11178589	Good idea, good idea.
11181344	11183746	I'll see what his attendance policy is and I'll skip most of them.
11183987	11184327	Alright.
11185528	11187670	How's that for a good attitude to take going into school?
11188631	11189351	I'm going home.
11190913	11191193	Alright.
11191253	11191613	Bye.
11191793	11192174	Bye.
11193435	11204224	No, I would like to pass on my warm wishes to our listeners from the depths of my, excuse me, heart.
11206815	11207055	Clusterfuck
11219830	11227233	But first, I wanted to play this song in case my friend is listening and hopefully he is and he knows who he is.
11228514	11232335	Mr. Bandicoot, if you're listening, here's a song that I know you wanted to hear.
11232475	11236097	And then after this song from Castlevania, it'll go into Poppin' Music 11.
11236137	11236677	So enjoy.
11237157	11238918	And thanks for listening and tuning in to Orange Laundry.
11238938	11239518	Everybody, good night.
11266972	11267953	Thanks for watching!
11318642	11320263	Thank you for watching!
11379889	11381072	Thanks for watching!
