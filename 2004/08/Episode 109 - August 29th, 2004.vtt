And now, for our feature presentation.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.520
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

04:09.520 --> 04:17.520
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.

04:17.520 --> 04:24.520
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

04:24.520 --> 04:31.520
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

04:31.520 --> 04:33.520
demons from hell.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.520
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

04:42.520 --> 04:47.520
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.520
Tracked, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

04:50.520 --> 04:55.520
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.520
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.520
Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.520
That was huge. Cool.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.520
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

05:09.520 --> 05:13.520
Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.520

This is episode number 109 for this, August the 29th of 2004.

05:53.100 --> 06:05.480
You're tuned in to the B-Mani scenes, most competitive radio station of all things, B-Mani.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.480
My name is Rob Roberts.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.920
You might know me as Sky.

06:07.920 --> 06:12.560
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

06:12.560 --> 06:13.560
farm.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.480
You know her better as Jamie Sommers?

06:16.480 --> 06:20.920
Dark Sacra!

06:20.920 --> 06:22.160
Can't hear you.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.680
I hate pollen

06:23.680 --> 06:24.500
and I hate

06:24.500 --> 06:26.540
not having air conditioning.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.880
I hate my throat and I hate my nose.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.780
I hate my sinus passages. Is there anything you like this evening? Meat! Meat.

06:33.780 --> 06:39.940
This is some damn good meat. I just want to end things on a positive note. Positive? How about a high note?

06:39.940 --> 06:41.780
I would except my throat hurts.

06:41.780 --> 06:44.660
so i had it on a low note

06:44.660 --> 06:45.780
works for me

06:45.780 --> 06:48.340
i could try the high note

06:48.340 --> 06:49.340
but i don't want to like you know

06:49.340 --> 06:53.580
you're hecka lame

06:53.580 --> 06:55.980

07:02.180 --> 07:07.140

07:15.460 --> 07:22.300
good Kmart. Also joining us tonight, the one and only Tech Massa Loki, and I was fixing

07:22.300 --> 07:29.300
the webcam, and I stepped on something sharp. The clumsy professor as always. It's metal,

07:29.300 --> 07:31.300
It's metal! Ow.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.300
It's probably a piece of your vortex.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.300
No, it's a piece of wire.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.300
Also joining us tonight, say hello to DDR Angel.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.300
Hello! I'm here again.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.300
What, four weeks in a row?

07:41.300 --> 07:42.300
Yeah.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.300
Damn girl, get a life!

07:43.300 --> 07:44.300
Yay!

07:44.300 --> 07:45.300
I'm just kidding. Alright.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.300
I know. What is this, 109 weeks in a row?

07:48.300 --> 07:50.300
I think you're one to walk. Talk.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.300
Bawk. Cop.

07:53.300 --> 08:00.860
I can't wait till I get a week off, which I do get pretty soon, about three weeks I

08:00.860 --> 08:01.860
have a week off.

08:01.860 --> 08:02.860
A forced week off?

08:02.860 --> 08:03.860
Yes, a forced week off.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.680
My doctor says this show's not good for me.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.680
You know what?

08:07.680 --> 08:08.680
What?

08:08.680 --> 08:09.680
Your computer hates me.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.680
Why's that?

08:10.680 --> 08:15.420
It just does, but I'll make the supreme effort, but goddammit, while you're out of town we

08:15.420 --> 08:16.420
better have guests.

08:16.420 --> 08:20.660
Or else we'll take a vacation too.

08:20.660 --> 08:21.660
We'll see what happens.

08:21.660 --> 08:22.660
I'm sure I can...

08:22.660 --> 08:26.660
We'll record three hours of Loki singing.

08:26.660 --> 08:36.660
Just whip out, you know what, before I leave, I'll buy Karaoke Revolution 2 and you'll have yourself a whole three hour show right there.

08:36.660 --> 08:39.660
Can't hear you, babe.

08:39.660 --> 08:41.660
How's that?

08:41.660 --> 08:43.660
You gotta hold the mic to the bottom sometimes.

08:43.660 --> 08:51.660
I'm going to announce to everybody tonight that I am currently on DayQuilled, Tylenol Allergy Sinus, and now Benadryl.

08:51.660 --> 08:56.140
so in other words Jamie admits I am on drugs up tonight

08:56.140 --> 08:59.460
so if I start saying something really weird

08:59.460 --> 09:02.700
blame the drugs but I'm going to have ice cream so that should

09:02.700 --> 09:05.980
sorta negate it because I'll be in happy chocolate mode

09:05.980 --> 09:09.100
it's maracans ice cream you're not doing ice cream

09:09.100 --> 09:12.540
low carb ice cream is not ice cream? no it's good it's made with cream

09:12.540 --> 09:15.980
alright we'll see it's better than normal ice cream because it's good

09:15.980 --> 09:19.260
it has fat in it and fat makes it good alright

09:19.260 --> 09:24.960
We're gonna take a quick break and we'll be back. Oh, yeah, there's the money stuff too. We do talk about DDR and money crap

09:24.960 --> 09:29.860
Yeah, what is that stuff? You know, I was actually playing ultra mix before the show. I want to talk about that when we come back

09:30.660 --> 09:36.620
After this little brain, I thought it'd be funny because I want to address some folks that play on ultra mix. That's why

09:37.280 --> 09:44.380
We're gonna take a break in this break. Enjoy the music of out phase and we'll be back after this break with

09:44.380 --> 09:49.380
There is much randomness for you. Enjoy!

13:14.380 --> 13:16.380
You

13:44.380 --> 13:47.460
a

13:47.460 --> 13:50.460
a

13:50.460 --> 13:53.460
a

13:53.460 --> 13:56.460
a

13:56.460 --> 13:59.460
a

13:59.460 --> 14:02.460
a

14:02.460 --> 14:05.460
a

14:05.460 --> 14:08.500
a

14:08.500 --> 14:11.500
a

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
You

15:41.500 --> 15:54.500
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

15:54.500 --> 15:59.500
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.500
No subject will ever be taboo.

16:02.500 --> 16:06.500
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

16:06.500 --> 16:09.500
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

16:09.500 --> 16:15.000
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I collect your fucking head.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.500
Just like this fucker here.

16:22.300 --> 16:29.000
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

16:29.500 --> 16:36.500
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

16:36.500 --> 16:43.500
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

16:43.500 --> 16:49.500
We are back. Orange Lounge Radio, episode 109 is live.

16:49.500 --> 16:53.500
Uh, in a... Damn it.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.500
My bad.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
Hold on a minute. Hold on, I have an announcement.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.500
Thank you.

17:00.500 --> 17:05.500
Uh, this message was brought to you by Diet Soda.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.620
Enjoy at your local grocer. All right

17:11.060 --> 17:15.460
Okay, so we are live here I'm just trying to get my bearings out of that burp

17:15.460 --> 17:19.780
Like totally just rattled my brain inside my head and now I can't think right so

17:20.900 --> 17:27.260
We are here with your favorite program. We have stiff competition tonight, though. Did you know that we have stiff competition with this show tonight?

17:27.980 --> 17:31.980
You guys are here listening to this show, but not only is this show going on right now

17:31.980 --> 17:36.820
But and I hope I don't make people go. Oh, yeah, I forgot and then they shut off the show and go watch it

17:36.820 --> 17:39.280
But the closing ceremonies the Olympics are going on right now

17:53.900 --> 17:57.480
The women's handball team one goal and then and then Bjork would have sung

17:57.480 --> 18:06.480
Okay, I need the new Bjork album. I am more excited about Bjork than the Olympics. Bjork

18:06.480 --> 18:14.120
makes me all horny. I have new Bjork stuff. Give Tarata Skull. I actually, uh, I was looking

18:14.120 --> 18:23.120
and I found photocopies of certain Bjork albums that are out soon. So, hold on, let me, uh.

18:23.120 --> 18:28.120
See, this is what you're missing at the Olympics right now.

18:28.120 --> 18:35.120
I'm a tree that is big!

18:35.120 --> 18:39.120
Just kidding, I like Bjork, otherwise I wouldn't have the album.

18:39.120 --> 18:57.600
Wow, we've actually got people here who showed up during the break.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.720
Yeah, we do have people that showed up here during the break.

18:59.720 --> 19:04.480
We have Arkadian42 showed up with glasses.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.480
New glasses.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.200
They're not new.

19:07.200 --> 19:12.640
not new. Well they look new because you haven't worn them around me in a long time if ever.

19:12.640 --> 19:17.200
Yeah well these are like way out of date actually there's like five years this is like a prescription

19:17.200 --> 19:21.520
I got like five or six years ago I'm only wearing because I can't really wear my contacts are like

19:22.240 --> 19:28.960
weeks old I can't buy any new ones until I get a eye exam and I can't afford an eye exam for a while

19:28.960 --> 19:49.960
Last time I came here, I'd just wear them every so often. I'm only going to wear them for a few hours, but I can't wear them all day, because the contacts I have right now are way too old to wear every day, or I might get an infection in the eye or something. So it wouldn't be a good idea.

19:58.960 --> 20:04.960
Miss, also known as Ixplicit with three X's, because he's triple X-rated. He's a porn star.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.960
Hey, everybody.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.960
Is that stinking State Fair still going on by your work?

20:09.960 --> 20:12.960
Uh, yeah.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.960
I want to come play DDR at your work, but the stinking State Fair's gone.

20:15.960 --> 20:22.960
You can actually play in the weekdays. The reason why it was closed Saturday and Sunday is because that's where the business is racking up.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.960
Fridays you can actually go. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday as well.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.920
lot doesn't spill all the way back there on the weekdays no no only Saturday and

20:30.920 --> 20:36.840
Sunday maybe I will go during the week we'll see okay about it all right is

20:36.840 --> 20:40.760
there anything else uh maybe later we'll talk to you more a little bit okay oh

20:40.760 --> 20:44.120
yeah I forgot to talk about competition we had the Olympics going on and Bjork

20:44.120 --> 20:46.960
singing on actually she sang at the over she's not singing again I was kidding

20:46.960 --> 20:51.120
about that we had the Olympics going on and the Video Music Awards are going on

20:51.120 --> 20:56.160
right now in Miami is going on and I think a lot of people ditched our show

20:56.160 --> 21:03.320
to go listen to that and you suck what I know seriously MTV is so done

21:03.320 --> 21:12.800
empty fee MTV is so done and overrated and it's who won can we just get a

21:12.800 --> 21:16.680
spoiler out there who won don't we know who won now let's just get the spoilers

21:16.680 --> 21:20.000
out there and who who made out with who this year and who punched who in the

21:20.000 --> 21:24.080
face let's just get it all out that way the guys don't have to watch you can

21:24.080 --> 21:30.160
feel free to watch this, listen to this show, and watch our webcam on www.orangelawnradio.com.

21:30.160 --> 21:35.920
Interesting. You can also join our chat room there, www.orangelawnradio.com, click on chat.

21:35.920 --> 21:42.120
Just that easy. Alright, we do have some Bahmani news I want to talk about tonight, but first,

21:42.120 --> 21:45.660
we have to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show by playing a little

21:45.660 --> 21:50.400
bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, and starting us off tonight for How Was Your

21:50.400 --> 21:59.600
week, how was your day? The lovely Dark Sakura. My week was okay until my allergies started

21:59.600 --> 22:11.760
to hate me. I had a perfect score in my classes. Congrats! I'm being like a good little nerdlet.

22:11.760 --> 22:22.080
The Benadryl finally kicked in, I can breathe, but I haven't yet fallen into a coma, okay.

22:22.080 --> 22:26.040
But it's just been kind of a druggy week.

22:26.040 --> 22:30.800
I've been on the DayQuil all week, and then I had to double up all doses of everything.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.120
I've been just so drugged.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.480
But my air conditioning isn't working again at my house, so I'm going to have Dan Fuss

22:36.480 --> 22:38.680
at the apartment manager for me.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.960
Yeah, sniff.

22:40.960 --> 22:45.480
I finally broke down and bought a box of tissues, so they're going to be my best friend all

22:45.480 --> 22:46.480
weekend.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.880
But yeah, it hasn't been very interesting.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.620
It's just been filled with lots of tissue, lots of drugs.

22:54.620 --> 23:00.520
I feel like some kind of celebrity, because I'm popping pills all weekend, you know?

23:00.520 --> 23:04.960
Maybe I should like rent a hotel room and throw a wild party and like throw the bedsheets

23:04.960 --> 23:09.200
out of the window into the pool and, you know, all that kind of stuff.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.280
but I'm hoping to feel better by next weekend so I can

23:12.280 --> 23:15.880
participate in much a random shooting of things

23:15.880 --> 23:19.960
this hasn't been too interesting

23:19.960 --> 23:23.720
very drugged

23:23.720 --> 23:28.400
very very drugged

23:28.400 --> 23:29.960
and robbed stores

23:29.960 --> 23:30.960
what?

23:30.960 --> 23:32.960
see? you weren't even paying attention to me

23:32.960 --> 23:36.160
I was trying to research the VMA so I could spoil it for everyone I'm sorry

23:36.160 --> 23:42.160
Sometimes you have to take the radio show by the horns and drive it yourself for a little bit.

23:42.160 --> 23:48.160
I could have said, and Rob suddenly likes pussy.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.160
And you would go good.

23:49.160 --> 23:57.160
I wouldn't know. There are certain keywords that set off my alarm inside. Pussy being one of them, and I would have got you.

23:57.160 --> 24:04.160
No, it's actually, it's just been stuff. You know, I didn't even know the Video Music Awards were going on because I don't watch cable or watch TV.

24:04.160 --> 24:08.160
I know. I don't watch crap either, so...

24:08.160 --> 24:11.160
Well, especially since the TV is now being taken up.

24:11.160 --> 24:14.160
Except for Survivor. I'm allowed one crap show to like, and that is my crap show.

24:14.160 --> 24:19.160
You know what? You can download Survivor on the SWIN channel on BitTorrent, I found.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.160
Well, I don't need old ones. I need new ones.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.160
No, these are the new ones.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
How can they be the new ones?

24:23.160 --> 24:25.160
Well, I mean, whenever the new ones are on...

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
Oh, okay.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.160
There's one that does, like, all the reality shows.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.160
Okay.

24:29.160 --> 24:33.160
And on top of that, I'm so happy because they put up the Stargate episode, like, within 15 minutes of it airing.

24:33.160 --> 24:37.160
That's how I was keeping tabs on the Amazing Race, which most people generally agree is not a crap show.

24:37.160 --> 24:40.160
Amazing Race is cool. I like the old army guy in it.

24:40.160 --> 24:46.160
I haven't been watching this year, though, because when Sharla and Myrna got kicked off, it just lost interest.

24:46.160 --> 24:50.160
The army guy is so kick-ass. This old guy and his daughter are a team.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.160
Oh.

24:51.160 --> 24:55.160
And he had fallen in the first part of the race and sliced up his leg.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.160
Yep.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.160
But he continued. They still stayed in the race.

24:58.160 --> 25:04.560
in the race and then he did the whole um what's the the thing with the pulley and the line from

25:04.560 --> 25:09.840
the top of the swim building into a swimming pool of course chlorine with an open wound yep this guy

25:09.840 --> 25:13.600
was hardcore have you watched all the episodes yet no because i don't have tv i just caught it

25:13.600 --> 25:17.520
over at iguana girl's house okay you should watch catch up to current there's some good stuff that

25:17.520 --> 25:24.560
happens i'm busy watching stargate watch my pretty scientist man oh anyway anything else you want to

25:24.560 --> 25:28.760
you want to share about your week and your day? Uh oh. Alright then. Loki! How was your

25:28.760 --> 25:35.760
week? How was your day? Umm, I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week because it's too-

25:36.200 --> 25:43.200
Ehh! Whatever. Wait till you hear what he did today, but I'll let him tell. I am lazy

25:46.640 --> 25:53.640
okay? I am extremely lazy. Extremely, extremely lazy. Let me make this clear. I am extremely

25:53.640 --> 25:59.000
I'm extremely lazy. And, you know, before- Wait a minute, I have a question for you.

25:59.000 --> 26:05.960
I have a question. So, Loki, are you in fact lazy? Yes, extremely lazy. Anyways, so, before,

26:05.960 --> 26:10.360
you know, I had farmed, you know, for, you know, hot, really expensive items for over

26:10.360 --> 26:14.920
three weeks, today was just not one of those days. I felt like not earning my money at

26:14.920 --> 26:25.280
all. So I bought it. I bought in-game money. So in other words, you gave somebody real

26:25.280 --> 26:30.120
life money so that they could give you in-game money. I just want to make that clear for

26:30.120 --> 26:38.120
our listeners. That would be correct. You know what, they can kiss my ass because I

26:38.120 --> 26:44.120
got that money like within 15 minutes of paying and you know what, that saved me a good 10

26:44.120 --> 26:48.560
hours of gameplay. I would think about it. It's opportunity cost. Any economics teacher

26:48.560 --> 26:55.600
will teach you, you know, whether you want to spend the 10 hours or pay the $20. Okay,

26:55.600 --> 27:01.360
that's what it is. That's especially amazing considering that it takes about 45 minutes

27:01.360 --> 27:09.220
to get a GM sometimes and Loki got his money in 15 minutes. That was enough time for me

27:09.220 --> 27:12.760
to take a power nap and then go back into the game and have my money waiting for me.

27:12.760 --> 27:20.760
You know on Ragnarok all I have to do is play for 15 minutes and I'll get like 400,000 zenny.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.760
Well that's because that money's worth nothing.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.760
Well so your money's not worth anything. I could like go buy like a goat headband.

27:28.760 --> 27:31.760
And it looks cool because I have big goat horns.

27:31.760 --> 27:35.760
Which would be very perfect for your portal to hell.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.760
No.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.760
I haven't touched Ragnarok in a week.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.760
I have my magnet wire coming.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.760
At it.

27:41.760 --> 27:55.760
Oh yeah, um, oh yeah, so then I have like some other stuff that's coming for my so-called portal to hell, I have my magnet wire coming, um, I have an eight and a half pound spool of that shit, so I'll be able to make something with that.

27:55.760 --> 28:04.760
And, um, what else? Eh, oh yeah, I had to go to the doctor about my ingrown toenail that's nasty.

28:04.760 --> 28:05.760
Ew!

28:05.760 --> 28:11.760
but but well he better like fix that shit cuz you can get blood poisoning

28:11.760 --> 28:20.920
anyways so I got antibiotics that tastes like cherry milk it's that's the only

28:20.920 --> 28:25.200
way I can describe it it's like a weird ass smell and it has a weird taste to it

28:25.200 --> 28:28.920
that's like chalky and I don't even know how to describe it like milk of

28:28.920 --> 28:35.160
magnesia it's just weird weird shit and I don't even know but whatever so

28:35.160 --> 28:43.160
So anyways, so, I've been pretty much just playing a lot of Final Fantasy. Um, I watched The Exorcist last night and I must say that movie is not scary at all.

28:43.160 --> 28:50.160
Yet, my fiancÃ© was freaked out by it. Because she thinks it can really happen.

28:50.160 --> 29:03.160
Of course, then I made fun of her about that and stuff, so that was fun. And, um, I don't know, just pretty much just, uh, online games. Um, and, yeah, that kind of thing.

29:03.160 --> 29:13.160
Okay, Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

29:13.160 --> 29:21.160
Hello. Okay, um, let's see, just schoolwork and other crap, nothing too damn exciting.

29:21.160 --> 29:28.160
Um, let's see, I played a little DDR, but not too much, which kind of sucks.

29:28.160 --> 29:33.080
but I'm watching Rob make a funny face

29:33.080 --> 29:37.160
Jamie's making me try her diet food

29:37.160 --> 29:40.480
I played a little pop music as well, that's pretty cool

29:40.480 --> 29:43.960
other than that I did nothing except for homework, yay homework

29:43.960 --> 29:47.760
alright, anybody else want to go next?

29:47.760 --> 29:51.760
hmm, maybe. Arcadian

29:51.760 --> 29:55.920
this week was mostly work and on

29:55.920 --> 30:03.420
Friday, we finally talked about employing me, and so we just did the pre-work, and now I'm not an attempt anymore. Yay!

30:03.420 --> 30:04.420
Yay!

30:04.420 --> 30:05.920
Yay! Congratulations.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.920
And so one day, the first day of not being an attempt for...

30:09.920 --> 30:11.920
This is good.

30:11.920 --> 30:14.920
Sorry, that's such a good point.

30:14.920 --> 30:18.920
That is such a good point. We have a bush and a dick in the White House.

30:18.920 --> 30:21.920
That's an old joke. I can't believe you've never heard that before.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.920
I know, but I don't want to keep you up.

30:24.920 --> 30:28.920
I never had your pulse on any, uh, drink of dope.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.920
Sorry, Arcadian.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.920
That's okay.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.920
Well, she wanted to talk, so I gave it to her.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.920
Uh...

30:36.920 --> 30:37.920
Uh...

30:37.920 --> 30:39.920
Oh my god, there's an MPB here!

30:39.920 --> 30:41.920
Uh, can you not work it on? Holy shit!

30:41.920 --> 30:44.920
Yeah. Fuck MPB!

30:44.920 --> 30:46.920
The world needs to depend.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.920
Not that you can entertain any of this.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.920
Explosion killed seven.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.920
That's new.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.920
Sorry Arcadian, you keep getting interrupted.

30:54.920 --> 30:55.420
Damn.

30:55.420 --> 30:55.920
Was there anything else?

30:55.920 --> 30:58.920
Too bad that explosion didn't kill seven MTV Music Awards.

30:58.920 --> 31:01.920
That would be nice.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.920
Kill them all.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.920
Actually, I have something that somewhat relates to the news, what's going on.

31:06.920 --> 31:10.920
I'm going to continue to interrupt Arcadian's little story he's trying to tell.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.920
Not that I have much of a story, anyway.

31:12.920 --> 31:16.920
More than 100,000 protest Bush in New York City.

31:16.920 --> 31:21.920
Those are some mean, mean feminists there.

31:21.920 --> 31:26.040
Actually it's interesting because did you hear about those planes that were crashing

31:26.040 --> 31:28.960
or the Russian planes that crashed earlier?

31:28.960 --> 31:33.080
Apparently this is, I'm like the last one to ever hear anything funny that's going on

31:33.080 --> 31:38.540
but apparently Tom Brokaw said on the news, he tried to pronounce one of the Russian city

31:38.540 --> 31:43.100
names but he got it wrong and he said something else instead and here it is, thank you unknown

31:43.100 --> 31:45.480
gamer for passing this along to me, this is pretty funny.

31:45.480 --> 31:50.440
Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously

31:50.440 --> 32:04.520
today. The first crash happened in Bucocki. He said Bucocki. Tom Brokaw said Bucocki.

32:04.520 --> 32:14.200
Next intro. I say that it goes in the next intro. Hold on one more time one

32:14.200 --> 32:15.200
One more time.

32:15.200 --> 32:23.200
Crash happened in Bucocki.

32:23.200 --> 32:27.600
There was a crash that happened and it made Bucocki.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.200
Teehee.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.200
We're seven years old.

32:32.200 --> 32:36.640
Poopy poopy, Bucocki Bucocki.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.240
I don't care how old you are or how mature you think you are.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.480
That is funny when Tom Brokaw says Bucocki on accident.

32:42.480 --> 32:46.720
I'm sure he must not, when he caught his mistake, if he even knows what the word means, I'm

32:46.720 --> 32:49.880
sure when he caught his mistake, he was probably pretty pissed.

32:49.880 --> 32:54.440
I have to do it one more time.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.920
The first crash happened in Bucocki.

32:58.920 --> 33:05.680
Anyway, Arcadian, I'm sorry to keep interrupting, how was your week, how was your day?

33:05.680 --> 33:35.660
Uh, let's see, Novomani moves, uh, this weekend, like, on Friday, uh, I found a praying menace that was, uh, on the ceiling of my bathroom, and he hung out for, like, until the day, and then I decided to take him outside, and then, it seemed like it was too hot outside, it seemed, I put him in a shady spot, but he seemed to be, like, uh, melting, or something, so I put a little bit of water on him, and threw him in the bushes, and he disappeared, about a week, I mean, about an hour later, so he may have been, bird food, or may have crawled off.

33:35.680 --> 33:42.680
to find some bugs. Or, who knows. The Circle of Life. And the rest of the day was just

33:42.920 --> 33:48.920
boring. Watched a few episodes of Upright Citizens Brigade that I had on CD.

33:48.920 --> 33:55.920
That show rocks. Yeah. And Play Along the Computer. And I don't

33:57.120 --> 34:00.120
know what else. That's about everything for me.

34:00.120 --> 34:05.560
Alright. I'll talk about My Week and My Day and then we'll get to Jonas. My Week and My

34:05.560 --> 34:09.440
my day was pretty good. Didn't do a whole lot during the week. Just a lot of work, you

34:09.440 --> 34:14.560
know, the usual stuff. Then yesterday, I actually met some friends of mine from LiveJournal

34:14.560 --> 34:18.000
who live up in Seattle, and they're also on our Final Fantasy XI link shell, so I've known

34:18.000 --> 34:22.920
these guys for a long time. They go by Wither and Ataluta on our Final Fantasy XI link shell.

34:22.920 --> 34:26.280
They were down here from Seattle on a total whim, where I guess they were gonna go to

34:26.280 --> 34:30.880
Marine World for one of the birthdays. And so they called me up and was like, hey, let's

34:30.880 --> 34:34.680
hang out. So I'm like, okay. So I went down there, and I took them to San Francisco, and

34:34.680 --> 34:39.540
We all went to the Metreon, which, you know, kind of a famous place in NorCal DDR history.

34:39.540 --> 34:43.380
It was one of the first two places that really had a lot of DDR and had big tournaments.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.380
So I took them there so they could, you know, be at the Metreon.

34:45.380 --> 34:50.260
And there's just other cool stuff there too, like the official Sony PlayStation Store and

34:50.260 --> 34:51.700
things like that.

34:51.700 --> 34:54.340
And I actually played a game of DDR.

34:54.340 --> 34:58.620
Ataluta forced me to play a game of DDR up on the third floor where the movie theater

34:58.620 --> 34:59.620
is.

34:59.620 --> 35:00.620
They have a DDR machine.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.620
And I played a game.

35:01.620 --> 35:02.620
Huh?

35:02.620 --> 35:06.700
Yeah, Jamie you and I played on that back when it was a fifth mix I think but now it's an extreme and

35:07.880 --> 35:12.060
We would have gone to Pier 39 now. We would have gone to Pier 39. How do we have more time?

35:12.060 --> 35:14.060
I was a little pressed for time yesterday

35:14.220 --> 35:15.500
so I

35:15.500 --> 35:21.340
Just I only had time really to take them to the Metreon because public transit goes right by there the bar and to get on

35:21.420 --> 35:26.220
Get to Pier 39. We would have to take a bus would taken too long, but next time I'll make him come back

35:26.780 --> 35:28.780
but we went to the Metreon and

35:28.780 --> 35:30.820
and played a game there, and you know what?

35:30.820 --> 35:33.500
DDR still gets crowds of people.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.180
Like, we were playing Cowgirl,

35:35.180 --> 35:37.060
which is not that complicated of a song,

35:37.060 --> 35:38.260
it's just a fun one,

35:38.260 --> 35:39.860
but there were just huge crowds of people

35:39.860 --> 35:41.340
that hear the little gallop,

35:41.340 --> 35:42.620
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, you know?

35:42.620 --> 35:44.340
Cause we're trying to get extra stage, right?

35:44.340 --> 35:46.180
That's an easy song to get extra stage with.

35:46.180 --> 35:48.700
So, we were playing that, and it was just, it was funny.

35:48.700 --> 35:49.540
It was good.

35:49.540 --> 35:50.380
And then he played doubles,

35:50.380 --> 35:51.700
and he got a hell of a crowd doing that.

35:51.700 --> 35:52.700
It was pretty funny.

35:52.700 --> 35:53.540
So.

35:53.540 --> 35:54.380
Cowgirl.

35:54.380 --> 35:57.740
I'm just surprised that DDR still gets big crowds like that.

35:57.740 --> 36:02.620
I guess in a city like San Francisco, big touristy spot, maybe people come there, they

36:02.620 --> 36:04.220
don't get out that often, I don't know.

36:04.220 --> 36:05.220
I don't know.

36:05.220 --> 36:08.380
Well, the reason why DDR is still popular is because, one, it's the only game that has

36:08.380 --> 36:11.220
exercise involved, really.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.800
Yeah, that's true.

36:13.800 --> 36:21.920
But then I went downstairs and I bowed down to the DDR 1.5 mix that they still have there.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.620
I missed 1.5 mix a little bit.

36:23.620 --> 36:32.740
Actually, I miss 5th Mix and I miss 4th Mix+, and I miss some 3rd Mix Koreans too, because they're all either extreme or they're extreme these days.

36:32.740 --> 36:39.780
Maybe you see a Max 2 still once in a while, maybe you get a 4th Plus if you're lucky, but what happened to all the 5th Mix?

36:39.780 --> 36:44.140
I remember when I used to hate 5th Mix, but I totally have a respect for it now.

36:44.140 --> 36:48.940
I always loved 5th Mix, but there's no place that has that anymore.

36:48.940 --> 36:54.400
When it first came out, I hated it. But the reason why I hated 5th Mix when it first came out

36:54.400 --> 36:58.600
was because I was still kind of in that new phase to DDR.

36:58.600 --> 37:02.860
I was in that transitional phase. When I first played DDR, USA was all I knew.

37:02.860 --> 37:04.800
I played USA, USA, USA.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.760
And then, finally, we picked up a fourth mix.

37:07.760 --> 37:11.700
So I was really just starting to discover a bunch of those older songs, like the old

37:11.700 --> 37:14.220
Erotic songs and stuff like that, which were really

37:14.220 --> 37:17.260
my thing that I loved. And right as I was discovering those,

37:17.260 --> 37:18.640
5th Mix comes out,

37:18.640 --> 37:21.640
And when that came out, what was the first thing that Fifth Mix did?

37:21.640 --> 37:25.640
It was the first mix to delete songs from older mixes, in mass.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.640
Now I'm not talking like onesies, twosies, like Strictly Business,

37:28.640 --> 37:31.640
so many men deleting songs like that, but I'm talking Fifth Mix was the first time

37:31.640 --> 37:34.640
they cut a whole bunch of songs from second to third mix.

37:34.640 --> 37:38.640
And I was pissed, because like all the good erotic songs I liked to play were gone,

37:38.640 --> 37:44.640
and all the cheesy stuff from Third Mix, like If You Can Say Goodbye and Flashdance,

37:44.640 --> 37:45.640
all that shit was gone. It was sad.

37:45.640 --> 37:49.640
How did you point out that 4th Mix deleted stuff from 3rd Plus?

37:49.640 --> 37:53.640
They deleted a couple of the Korean songs, right?

37:53.640 --> 37:57.640
Yeah. And what other?

37:57.640 --> 38:01.640
It was one other, I thought, that they did that wasn't...

38:01.640 --> 38:05.640
I'm talking about like 30, 40 songs. 5th Mix got rid of like

38:05.640 --> 38:09.640
30, 40 old songs. And so I kind of was pissed off about it.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.640
And then add on to that, the frame rate changed, the interface was radically different.

38:13.640 --> 38:17.680
I didn't like it at first but now that you know

38:17.680 --> 38:21.440
now that I've played Max and Max 2 and Xtreme to death

38:21.440 --> 38:25.360
to go back and play 5th Mix is a lot of fun because there were a lot of songs

38:25.360 --> 38:28.360
that only ever showed up on 5th Mix. I know

38:28.360 --> 38:33.040
but too bad Konami won't put them in. I mean like Moonlight Shadow

38:33.040 --> 38:37.920
or Moving On or there's like a lot of songs on 5th Mix that are so good

38:37.920 --> 38:41.040
well the nice thing is a lot of those songs are coming out now in the US it's

38:41.040 --> 38:44.100
like it's kind of weird because between extreme and Ultramix 2 we're getting a

38:44.100 --> 38:47.840
lot of fit mix-ups. Moonlight Shadow is going to be an Ultramix 2.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.480
I heard about Ultramix 2 who's making the steps and stuff.

38:51.480 --> 38:58.620
Yeah but you know crazy. Crazy stuff. Anyway I heard this Maximizer song.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.860
Did you actually hear this song? No, I just heard about news about this Maximizer.

39:01.860 --> 39:04.660
We'll talk about all that a little bit. I'll get into extreme news a little later

39:04.660 --> 39:07.580
because there was big extreme news this week. I want to ask you guys some

39:07.580 --> 39:14.980
stuff about it. But, first off, where the hell was I? Oh yeah, the Metreon. So, we left

39:14.980 --> 39:20.260
the Metreon and then I came back and I went to a Halo party last night. Somebody was having

39:20.260 --> 39:24.300
a birthday party and they had a Halo party and as nerdy as it sounds, we actually had

39:24.300 --> 39:29.820
a lot of fun. One team had their TV outside and we ran a big cable. The inside, it was

39:29.820 --> 39:33.040
great. I was playing with this girl who I'd just met last night and she'd never played

39:33.040 --> 39:37.440
Halo before and she was hilarious. We were having fun playing. My friend whose birthday

39:37.440 --> 39:42.180
it was, we played and it was great. Halo is a great party game. When that thing gets on

39:42.180 --> 39:48.820
Xbox Live, it's over. It's over. Anyway, that was pretty much it. That's all that's worth

39:48.820 --> 39:53.960
saying about my week and my day. Moving on. Jonas, how was your week? How was your day?

39:53.960 --> 39:59.200
My day was pretty actually, this whole week's pretty good so far. I got new shoes. I actually

39:59.200 --> 40:04.200
We can play DDR hella good with them. Started to double-A a lot of stuff with it.

40:04.200 --> 40:08.200
And heard some news about Tuesday's tournament in Scandia.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.200
Not sure if you all heard about it.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.200
Oh, yeah, you heard about the overnight one or something? They're doing like a block-in?

40:13.200 --> 40:15.200
It's like back-to-school bash.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.200
Oh, yeah.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.200
Weren't we gonna go crash this tournament? Weren't we talking about going to crash it?

40:19.200 --> 40:22.200
I was gonna go as Dr. Dick and...

40:22.200 --> 40:30.200
I could if my foot was better, and it still hurts, but after ten days, that's up there.

40:30.200 --> 40:34.200
I'm so out of shape, I cannot play anything.

40:34.200 --> 40:40.200
I was all, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh!

40:40.200 --> 40:42.200
Jesus, man, Jesus.

40:42.200 --> 40:47.200
I'm kinda worried about how the rules are going to turn out. All he says is PA in freestyle.

40:47.200 --> 40:47.200
When is this tournament?

40:47.200 --> 40:49.200
Tuesday at 7 o'clock.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.200
Tuesday?

40:51.200 --> 40:59.480
7 o'clock p.m. That's during Jamie's show. I think I'm gonna go. I want to go win it.

40:59.480 --> 41:05.080
The prize is a trophy. Oooh! It's a trophy? Because I'm betting all the good players in

41:05.080 --> 41:08.520
Sacramento don't know about it, like Toady and Moogle Hunter and all that. They don't

41:08.520 --> 41:12.560
know about it. They actually know about it a little bit. God dammit, who told them? Who

41:12.560 --> 41:19.960
told them? DDRUK.com. Fuck. Blame them. Why the fuck would DDRUK be talking about a shitty

41:19.960 --> 41:25.060
little tournament at Scandia. Why? Why would anyone want to give that tournament the time

41:25.060 --> 41:29.680
of day? Well, because people are like, some of my workers at Paradise Island went to Scandia

41:29.680 --> 41:36.680
and stuff, it's just a thing. I'm going to go and I'm going to break Toady and Moogle's

41:36.880 --> 41:41.280
legs and then I'm going to win it. And I'm going to win me a shiny trophy. You can also

41:41.280 --> 41:44.880
get it for freestyle as well. There's like two people, only two people entering. That's

41:44.880 --> 41:52.880
That's right! White people can't dance! It's on! It is so on!

41:52.880 --> 41:56.880
Don't worry, I'm not competing. So, you have a high chance.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.880
Bring it! Bring it!

41:57.880 --> 41:58.880
Oh, you want me to compete?

41:58.880 --> 41:59.880
Bring it!

41:59.880 --> 42:02.880
Alright, I'll compete.

42:02.880 --> 42:08.880
I'm gonna make something up, and I'm gonna beat you. It's already been rotten!

42:08.880 --> 42:12.880
You came close on the marshmallows.

42:12.880 --> 42:15.880
That's just because I know how to work a crowd, but that's alright.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.880
Or you can reserve for SVGL on December.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.880
I'm not talking about these things yet.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.880
Okay, we'll discuss that later on.

42:24.880 --> 42:30.880
Well, we can say now there is a tournament that's going to be at Sunnyvale Golf Line in December, but I'm not...

42:30.880 --> 42:34.880
I'm thinking about doing something special, but I don't know yet.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.880
It's only DDR4++, I'm assuming.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.880
They're not using Xtreme Zola 4++ for freestyle.

42:39.880 --> 42:45.980
Oh, I know that made that's the reason why I want to do it same here stream is used fourth plus it like retro

42:45.980 --> 42:49.140
Old is new again. I love the 90s all over again, right?

42:50.740 --> 42:54.340
Hey Rob, if you're going to that thing, can I go because you need a cheering section?

42:54.340 --> 42:56.620
I hella need a cheering section

42:56.740 --> 43:00.820
I'm sure I'm sure I'll end up going if I the question is if I'm gonna enter or not

43:00.820 --> 43:06.100
I'm thinking about doing my very first like actual freestyle. That's the thing. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know

43:06.100 --> 43:08.100
You got two days unfortunate

43:08.100 --> 43:26.100
I was going to say if Rob goes then Magus and I will carpool with him maybe if he lets us and we will be his cheering section because we can.

43:26.100 --> 43:32.100
We'll see. I'll let you guys know if I end up going to this tournament Tuesday at Scandia.

43:32.100 --> 43:37.100
I'll probably be there since I didn't get any tickets for the WWE event at Arco Arena.

43:37.100 --> 43:42.100
Oh, yeah, see there's more competitors that are gonna be gone, because they'll go to that, so.

43:42.100 --> 43:43.100
Yeah.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.100
Shit.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.100
You got that SmackDown event.

43:45.100 --> 43:48.100
I got three days to come up with a routine, damn.

43:48.100 --> 43:51.100
I gotta find my copy of Extreme.

43:51.100 --> 43:54.100
Okay, let's see what else.

43:54.100 --> 43:59.100
It's also on DERFreak.com since everyone heard about it from DERUK.

43:59.100 --> 44:12.100
Okay, um, also I wanted to say fair, it was pretty good except the prices are damn expensive, 10 bucks for a ticket, 25 bucks for a wristband, or 20 if you get a coke can.

44:12.100 --> 44:14.100
How much for a hot dog on a stick?

44:14.100 --> 44:15.100
Don't ask, it's like 8 bucks or so.

44:15.100 --> 44:18.100
How much for an egg roll on a stick? And cheesecake on a stick?

44:18.100 --> 44:20.100
Let's just say the lowest price for the-

44:20.100 --> 44:21.100
And your mom on a stick.

44:21.100 --> 44:23.100
That's priceless.

44:23.100 --> 44:31.060
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, most of the stuff there is like not even, the least expensive

44:31.060 --> 44:36.340
is like six bucks. And those are the funnel cakes. The most expensive is like 25, just

44:36.340 --> 44:37.420
for regular dinner.

44:37.420 --> 44:41.780
Oh, 25 bucks for one of those shitty little carts serving you dinner?

44:41.780 --> 44:47.380
Yeah, one of them is that much. Most of them, you can see on those other restaurants, there's

44:47.380 --> 44:51.080
only one that you cannot get, it's only exclusive for State Fair, and those are the funnel cakes

44:51.080 --> 44:52.500
and the fried Twinkies.

44:52.500 --> 44:56.500
Unless you know how to make them, then you can make the fried Twinkies yourself.

44:56.500 --> 45:01.500
But Funnel Cakes is exclusive to the State Fair.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.500
Oh yeah.

45:03.500 --> 45:04.500
Alright.

45:04.500 --> 45:08.500
And the fact that parking is expensive as hell.

45:08.500 --> 45:11.500
Like seven bucks for parking. Used to be like six.

45:11.500 --> 45:15.500
And I'm assuming there's a DDR arcade section at the State Fair on the kids section.

45:15.500 --> 45:21.500
Oh yeah, don't they usually have DDR at the State Fair every year and people go to dance to show off and try to get crowds?

45:21.500 --> 45:26.260
try to get crowds, the people that love attention and stuff, which I'm certainly not accepted

45:26.260 --> 45:27.260
from that.

45:27.260 --> 45:33.100
I think it's on the eastern gate, I'm assuming, because I haven't been there yet, since I'm

45:33.100 --> 45:37.740
going there on a Saturday yet again. There goes my wallet.

45:37.740 --> 45:41.580
All right. Anything else you want to-

45:41.580 --> 45:44.140
Wait, did you say you were going on Thursday, Jonas?

45:44.140 --> 45:45.140
Saturday.

45:45.140 --> 45:49.180
Damn, I'm going on Thursday. Somebody in here knows why I'm going on Thursday.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.460
Yes, I know what's going on Thursday.

45:50.460 --> 45:53.860
There's a concert Thursday she wants to see.

45:53.860 --> 45:54.860
Interesting.

45:54.860 --> 45:55.860
Ooh.

45:55.860 --> 46:00.540
All right, anything else you want to share about your week and your day, Jonas?

46:00.540 --> 46:07.780
Not much, just work, school, and that's about it so far.

46:07.780 --> 46:08.780
Fair enough.

46:08.780 --> 46:12.300
All right, I opened up the Skype line if anybody has a comment so far.

46:12.300 --> 46:15.780
If you don't know anything about the Skype line, it's time to educate yourself.

46:15.780 --> 46:20.180
head on over to our website www.orangeloungeradio.com

46:20.180 --> 46:22.560
click on that little tab that says interact with us.

46:22.560 --> 46:25.160
Remember, when we're in that do not disturb mode

46:25.160 --> 46:28.020
with the little red circle with the line through it,

46:28.020 --> 46:29.460
means do not disturb.

46:29.460 --> 46:30.880
We're not taking calls.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.720
But we are right now.

46:31.720 --> 46:32.880
That icon's not on right now.

46:32.880 --> 46:33.940
We are taking calls.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.740
We're gonna go to a break if nobody wants to call.

46:36.740 --> 46:38.040
Ooh, we're getting a call.

46:38.980 --> 46:41.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

46:43.660 --> 46:44.660
I hope we can hear this person.

46:44.660 --> 46:46.700
Can you hear us?

46:46.700 --> 46:47.460
Yes, I can.

46:47.460 --> 46:48.040
There you are.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.940
Turn up your volume just a little bit more.

46:50.940 --> 46:53.260
Who beat this?

46:53.260 --> 46:54.580
Legend of Zaku.

46:54.580 --> 46:57.700
It's Legend of Zaku calling in, but he's very, very quiet.

46:57.700 --> 47:01.140
If there's any way you can turn up your mic volume, go for it.

47:01.140 --> 47:01.640
Huh?

47:01.640 --> 47:03.860
Oh, all right.

47:03.860 --> 47:04.780
Yes, I can.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.340
There we go.

47:05.340 --> 47:06.140
Little bit better.

47:06.140 --> 47:08.500
What's on your mind?

47:08.500 --> 47:09.500
Huh?

47:09.500 --> 47:11.300
What's on your mind?

47:11.300 --> 47:12.300
I don't know.

47:12.300 --> 47:12.800
Let me see.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.420
I just moved.

47:14.420 --> 47:21.420
you just moved

47:22.380 --> 47:24.060
yikes

47:24.060 --> 47:26.780
yes i can hear you better now

47:26.780 --> 47:29.100
what up

47:29.100 --> 47:30.380
uh...

47:30.380 --> 47:33.820
you know i'm trying to prepare i need help

47:33.820 --> 47:37.500
no i just need help for a freestyle routine because i have this big tournament in jacob

47:37.500 --> 47:40.680
davitt center in new york city

47:40.680 --> 47:43.300
he needs help with a freestyle routine what

47:43.300 --> 47:47.300
What advice can he give to somebody? I'll ask Jonas, because he's the only one here.

47:47.300 --> 47:48.300
I have one suggestion.

47:48.300 --> 47:49.300
Alright, yes, dark sacraments.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.300
Don't use an orange bat, you will lose.

47:51.300 --> 47:54.300
Yes, don't use an orange bat, you'll lose.

47:54.300 --> 47:56.300
Jamie and I know this from experience.

47:56.300 --> 48:01.300
Okay, but, yeah, they're holding the thousand up.

48:01.300 --> 48:03.300
They're holding...

48:03.300 --> 48:05.300
Alright, we're losing the connection, Zaku.

48:05.300 --> 48:06.300
I'm going to let you go.

48:06.300 --> 48:09.300
Tune into the show, we'll answer your question, okay bud?

48:09.300 --> 48:11.300
Thanks for calling.

48:11.300 --> 48:13.280
Let's answer, let's finish answering Zachary's question.

48:13.280 --> 48:15.180
How do you prepare for a freestyle?

48:15.180 --> 48:16.820
Jonas, what do you go through,

48:16.820 --> 48:17.920
what are the motions you go through

48:17.920 --> 48:19.540
when you're preparing for a freestyle routine?

48:19.540 --> 48:20.920
Okay, the first thing to do is,

48:20.920 --> 48:23.420
the best best is to put a step chart.

48:23.420 --> 48:25.700
That's my recommendation, a step chart would work

48:25.700 --> 48:28.860
because you can tell what moves you're gonna do

48:28.860 --> 48:31.260
and prepare, you know, like a documentary.

48:31.260 --> 48:32.100
Yeah.

48:34.020 --> 48:35.940
Okay, I'm losing you, Jonas.

48:35.940 --> 48:37.940
Grab the bottom of the microphone there.

48:37.940 --> 48:40.380
Push that cord back in a little bit and try again.

48:40.380 --> 48:41.380
Sorry, bud.

48:41.380 --> 48:42.380
Hello?

48:42.380 --> 48:43.380
Yes.

48:43.380 --> 48:44.380
Does it work?

48:44.380 --> 48:45.380
Yes.

48:45.380 --> 48:46.380
Okay.

48:46.380 --> 48:47.380
Damn it.

48:47.380 --> 48:48.380
Oh, okay.

48:48.380 --> 48:51.980
The best best to print a step chart, like DDMAIN.com, look for the step chart, the song

48:51.980 --> 48:57.260
you want, print out the step chart, and use that as a document, which you want to do for

48:57.260 --> 48:58.260
the song itself.

48:58.260 --> 48:59.260
All right.

48:59.260 --> 49:04.540
Like, you can write, ooh, I could do a spin here, or a split, or wave your hands.

49:04.540 --> 49:08.220
Okay, actually, yeah, he's correcting us in the channel right now.

49:08.220 --> 49:09.740
He doesn't want to know how to set it up.

49:09.740 --> 49:13.900
fine. He wants to know what song he should do. What songs should he do? What songs have

49:13.900 --> 49:18.360
not been used to all hell that are freestyle-able songs in your opinion, Jonas?

49:18.360 --> 49:24.380
It depends on what stuff he wants to do. Like if he wants to do like, achas or salsa like

49:24.380 --> 49:31.380
you can go like, La Bamba, La Copa de la Vida or anything like that.

49:31.380 --> 49:35.060
I want to see a really good routine to gamlande couple personally.

49:35.060 --> 49:37.560
That was actually pretty tough, but it's doable.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.300
If you want to do something like, um...

49:40.300 --> 49:42.320
Like, Orbeez, like...

49:42.320 --> 49:49.320
Sweet style, like, Heaven is His 57 McTighe Grey would work.

49:49.680 --> 49:53.860
Hey, God, for the love of God, no! No indeed dropping!

49:53.860 --> 49:56.840
Alright. I thought...

49:56.840 --> 50:02.200
We're gonna go... It's Raining Man. No comment. Heck yeah, it's Raining Man. Heck yeah.

50:02.200 --> 50:07.720
I'm just reading the post of Unknown Gamer's thing.

50:07.720 --> 50:13.000
If you want to go feminist, just go for it. It's Raining Man, I Do, I Do, I Do, Cowgirl,

50:13.000 --> 50:18.400
any of those B4U songs.

50:18.400 --> 50:23.760
And if you want to go old school, just play anything that's from Naoki.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.200
That works.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.760
And if you want to challenge the hell out of yourself, play

50:27.760 --> 50:36.900
like those maxes. Alright, we're going to go ahead and go to a break here, and in this

50:36.900 --> 50:41.460
break, since we were talking about Fifth Mix, I thought maybe we could, you know, respect

50:41.460 --> 50:46.700
Fifth Mix a little bit by playing some songs from it. So, we will be right back after this,

50:46.700 --> 50:53.700
you guys

51:16.700 --> 51:19.700
Far away on the other side

51:19.700 --> 51:23.200
She was caught in the middle of a different fight

51:23.200 --> 51:26.700
And she couldn't find how to push through

51:26.700 --> 51:30.200
She danced through the evening

51:30.200 --> 51:33.700
Carried away by a moonlight shed

51:33.700 --> 51:37.200
She sang her soul and breathing

51:37.200 --> 51:40.700
Carried away by a moonlight shed

51:40.700 --> 51:44.200
She pushed her toe up to feel the weather come

51:44.200 --> 51:47.200
Far away on the other side

51:47.200 --> 51:50.700
He was shot six times by a man on the run

51:50.700 --> 51:54.700
And she couldn't find how he pushed through

51:54.700 --> 52:01.200
I said, I said, I prayed to you in heaven one day

52:01.200 --> 52:04.700
Falling in the morning

52:04.700 --> 52:07.700
Carried away by a moonlight shed

52:07.700 --> 52:11.700
I watched your vision burning

52:11.700 --> 52:14.300
Carried away by a moonlight

53:14.300 --> 53:15.300
2.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.300
).

53:16.300 --> 53:17.300
3.

53:17.300 --> 53:18.300
4.

53:18.300 --> 53:19.300
5 & 4.

53:19.300 --> 53:20.300
7.

53:20.300 --> 53:21.300
8.

53:21.300 --> 53:22.300
9.

53:22.300 --> 53:23.300
10.

53:23.300 --> 53:24.300
11.

53:24.300 --> 53:25.300
12.

53:25.300 --> 53:26.300
13.

53:26.300 --> 53:27.300
14.

53:27.300 --> 53:28.300
15.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.300
16.

53:29.300 --> 53:30.300
17.

53:30.300 --> 53:31.300
18.

53:31.300 --> 53:32.300
19.

53:32.300 --> 53:33.300
20.

53:33.300 --> 53:34.300
21.

53:34.300 --> 53:35.300
22.

53:35.300 --> 53:36.300
23.

53:36.300 --> 53:37.300
24.

53:37.300 --> 53:38.300
25.

53:38.300 --> 53:39.300
26.

53:39.300 --> 53:40.300
27.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.300
28.

53:41.300 --> 53:42.300
29.

53:42.300 --> 53:43.300
30.

53:43.300 --> 54:02.500
Alright, for this last song in the fifth mix break, Jamie wanted to play this one especially

54:02.500 --> 54:03.500
for you guys.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.780
This is Dark Sakura's pick just for you.

54:05.780 --> 54:12.780
I love you guys so much that I thought you'd really want to hear this, so there you go.

54:35.780 --> 54:53.780
I'm not that innocent

54:53.780 --> 55:14.700
I think I did it again, I made you believe we're more than just friends

55:14.700 --> 55:20.500
Oh baby, you might seem like a crush, but it doesn't mean I'm serious

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
Yeah

55:50.500 --> 56:06.500
Yes, my problem is clear, I'm dreaming away Wishing I'd see you grow, that you'd make me feel

56:06.500 --> 56:16.500
I try watching nowadays, can't you see I'm a fool In so many ways, but you lose all my senses

56:16.500 --> 56:20.500
That is just so deeply clay me, oh baby

56:20.500 --> 56:23.500
Oh, I did it again

56:23.500 --> 56:24.500
I played with your heart

56:24.500 --> 56:26.500
Got lost in a game

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
Oh baby, baby

56:28.500 --> 56:30.500
You think I'm in love

56:30.500 --> 56:33.500
Then I'm done from above

56:33.500 --> 56:35.500
I'm not that innocent

56:35.500 --> 56:37.500
Oh, I did it again

56:37.500 --> 56:39.500
I played with your heart

56:39.500 --> 56:41.500
Got lost in a game

56:41.500 --> 56:42.500
Oh baby, baby

56:42.500 --> 56:44.500
Oh, you think I'm in love

56:44.500 --> 56:56.900
In a band, in a band, in a band, in a band...

56:56.900 --> 57:02.900
...happened in bu- uh, bu- uh, bu- coffee, but...

57:02.900 --> 57:31.900
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

57:31.900 --> 57:44.020
We are back. Excuse me, I'm eating a gummy worm. It's very pleasant. We are listening

57:44.020 --> 57:50.940
to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are, back with episode 109. We're talking about freestyle

57:50.940 --> 57:58.200
a little bit before the break there. And, um, oh yeah, if you're wondering what the

57:58.200 --> 58:01.260
hell happened in the chat room, if you were in our chat room, OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click

58:01.260 --> 58:06.100
on chat we had what's called a net split and this happens from time to time IRC

58:06.100 --> 58:09.740
it's a bunch of computers all linked together for the purposes of chatting

58:09.740 --> 58:13.340
and when you connect to our server you're connecting to one of them well

58:13.340 --> 58:17.380
sometimes the communication line breaks and that means half the people go one

58:17.380 --> 58:20.520
way and half the people go the other way so we had a little bit of a net split

58:20.520 --> 58:26.460
there but it looks like it's fixed we're okay now so don't don't be afraid of our

58:26.460 --> 58:29.740
chat room there's many other reasons to be afraid of our chat room other than

58:29.740 --> 58:34.460
the net splits. That's all. Jamie picked that one just for you guys, by the way.

58:34.460 --> 58:36.240
The Rochelle. Oops, I did it again.

58:36.240 --> 58:37.740
Uh, have people liked it?

58:37.740 --> 58:40.240
Yeah, I threw in a little bit of the bukkake thing, too.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.740
Because Tom Brokaw likes bukkake.

58:41.740 --> 58:42.240
Yes, he does.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.740
You heard it here on Orange Island Radio.

58:43.740 --> 58:48.740
I'm gonna run this joke into the ground tonight. I like having jokes so we can run into the ground.

58:48.740 --> 58:52.740
Crash happened in bukkake.

58:56.740 --> 58:58.740
Tom Brokaw's getting old.

58:58.740 --> 59:02.780
What? He's been doing news since I was five. He's quitting

59:02.780 --> 59:06.300
finally, like this year I think. He needs to retire. Him and Dan Rather.

59:06.300 --> 59:11.900
Dan Rather's still doing the news. You know, Phil Donahue got his clue. He ended his show.

59:11.900 --> 59:15.620
Way back. But then he got a new one on another network.

59:15.620 --> 59:18.940
No. And then it tanked. Yes he did. He was on MSNBC for about three months.

59:18.940 --> 59:21.980
Then it tanked. Because they got too used to his talk show.

59:21.980 --> 59:25.900
See, once you go, you know, public mass

59:25.900 --> 59:29.900
You know, audience, you can never go back. It's over.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.900
That's why Ricky Lake will never act again.

59:32.900 --> 59:33.900
Except in John Waters movies.

59:33.900 --> 59:35.900
Except in John Waters movies.

59:35.900 --> 59:38.900
There's a new John Waters movie coming out soon. I'm so excited.

59:38.900 --> 59:42.900
It's NC-17, so it's back to his roots. Good stuff.

59:42.900 --> 59:44.900
All right.

59:44.900 --> 59:49.900
Anyway, I thought we could actually talk about some actual Bamani news that's going on this week.

59:49.900 --> 59:50.900
How was your week? How was your day?

59:50.900 --> 59:51.900
Didn't we finish? How was your week? How was your day?

59:51.900 --> 59:53.900
Oh, that's right. We did.

59:53.900 --> 59:55.660
I'm like, drugs remember?

59:55.660 --> 01:00:00.140
Yeah, Jamie's on drugs tonight you guys, since we about doubled our listeners since the start

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.900
of the show, why don't you explain to everybody what's going on, Jamie?

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.220
My nose hates me.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:09.000
I've been like, major allergy attacks since like, Friday.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.820
So I'm on DayQuil, and Tylenol allergy sinus, and this Afrin stuff that you shoot up into

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.260
your nose.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.460
And then this Vicks stuff that looks like a dildo.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.580
Look at this!

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:23.700
I got this this one of those little it's just it has like the Vicks stuff in it so you inhale

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:27.460
the fumes you know like when you put Vicks on your nose but if you take the wrapper off

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:32.100
of it it looks like a dildo I put it up on the cam before doesn't it that kind of like

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:35.500
a little too it looks like a tampon it just sort of looks like a tampon too but can you

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:41.740
put it can I go put that on our webcam I did it once but here put on the camera again but

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:46.140
join our site at uh orange lounge radio.com and you can see the webcam right on the front

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.460
page and I'm gonna go show off this this nasty little thing my Vicks tampon you

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:58.060
feel the fumes but um I got another drug I got Benadryl now and they have

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:02.100
dacral sinus so I'm taking that too

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:12.620
don't put that I have it in my Rob is sick I'll put a tampon in his nose

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.620
Ew, Rob.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:22.980
That wasn't really in my nose, Jesus.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:23.980
Alright.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:30.020
But, um, I don't know what I like, what I hate more, because I've been, like, sniffy

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:34.060
drippy all day, and my nose had this burn in it, like I had this sneeze.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:38.460
I sneezed the whole way here, I nearly ran into some truck that was carrying, like, panes

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.460
of glass.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.700
I thought I was going to die.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.700
By the way, Rob, will you put a stack on the screen for me?

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.700
Oh, my bad.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.700
Thank you.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:52.580
So, I took Benadryl right before I came in, and I've had ice cream, so I'm hoping that

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.820
they counteract each other, but if I fall into a coma halfway through the show, blame

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.820
the drugs.

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:57.820
We won't.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.020
I'll be just like Ozzy Osbourne, back when he was cool.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.020
He's still cool.

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.020
What are you talking about?

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.520
You know what's funny?

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.940
In my law book, because I'm taking business law, they brought up that case from the 80s

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:18.700
the kid listened to the Ozzy Osbourne suicide song and shot himself, the one they thought

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:25.860
had subliminal messages and all this crap in it, and it was funny, that was in my book.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:31.220
There's also another case in there about this woman who was suing the US government because

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.100
a plane fell on her house.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.100
What?

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.260
Law is funny.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.260
Okay.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:41.180
Okay, anyway, I'm just going all the way off on tangents.

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.180
That's alright, that's alright.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.940
And as you know, the one that I'm referring to was Ozzy Osbourne because I did my homework

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:47.940
and read my book.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:50.100
So they talked about an Ozzy Osbourne case.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:58.620
About the song that, um, it was, uh, no, I read the goddamn book, don't argue with me,

01:02:58.620 --> 01:02:59.620
okay?

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:03.660
You are not taking my business law class, I am taking the business law class.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:07.000
They referred to, Ozzy Osbourne's first name is John, okay?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.240
They had him by his name in my god damn book, and it was freaking, okay, do not argue with

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.640
me because I am always right, okay?

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.760
It was an Osborne case where it was a song about how easy it is to kill yourself, about

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:25.560
you can slowly drink yourself to death, and then it was, and the guy killed himself, and

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.640
they were, his parents were trying to blame Ozzy Osborne for killing himself, for killing

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:41.640
the kid, but they actually, it got turned over because, had they ruled in the parent's

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.380
favor, it would have been a violation of the constitutional right for freedom of speech.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:53.040
By the way, speaking of freedom of speech, you remember the little thingy that I posted

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:59.200
in my live journal about the RIAA getting a finger from the 9th Court of Appeals.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.840
That was beautiful.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.600
I don't know the link off the top of my head because it was kind of long.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.960
If somebody who is on my friends list can get that out of my live journal and post in

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:16.720
the chat room for me, the federal government basically, well the 9th court of appeals basically

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:28.560
turned over that the person to person share programs like Bittorrent, there's Bearshare,

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.680
LimeWire, those like that, are legal.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:39.580
Also, they shot down the plans that they were wanting to do in the copyright laws because

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:46.540
it would have interfered with I think some of the commercial law under the Constitution

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:55.940
and I think it's pretty neat, pretty neat that the ironic thing is that the 9th Court

01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:04.060
of Appeals also was the one that did the Napster case back in the day, but yeah I was peeking

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:09.060
and through the news, I saw that and that was really cool, so.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.260
All right.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.080
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:13.920
No, that's all right.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.760
I had to load up some of the news anyway.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.220
That affects all of us.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.060
That affects the show.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.540
I know you all pirate.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:23.540
They're also saying that, like what we do through Live 365,

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.100
perfectly fine.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:28.780
Yeah, well, what we did through Live 365 was always legal.

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.620
So, anyway.

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.440
Yep.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.980
Anyway, I wanna get into some Bahmani news,

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:33.100
some actual Bahmani news.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:37.100
going on in the Bahmani world this week. And one of the biggest stories actually broke

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.320
on Monday, so it's almost old news to a lot of you guys right now, but I kind of want

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.680
to talk about some of the kind of repercussions behind this. For those of you that may not

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:49.540
have heard, get out from under your rock and here's what's going on. GamePro.com ran this

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:53.440
article on Monday that talked about the upcoming DDR Extreme that we're all getting in the

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:59.920
US. And in this article, it included some screenshots. Well, whoopsie daisy, somebody

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.800
let them have a copy of the already unlocked version of the game, and because they showed

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:12.520
off the screenshots, they blew about 18 of the unlocks. And I know for, well, I guess

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:18.280
I shouldn't say this, I know for a fact, but I know that one of them was kind of one of

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:22.800
the ones that I think Konami kind of wanted to keep a surprise, and that was You're Not

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.160
Here by Heather from Silent Hill 3. Konami kind of wanted that to be a surprise when

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.640
game actually comes out whoops cover got blown on that one as well as the cover

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:38.040
got blown on three two one stars a absolute b4u the b4 za beat mix trip

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.820
machine trip machine survivor sugaru v and of course you're not here and the

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:47.880
article went ahead and said oh by the way maximizers in the game what did I

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:53.640
say what did I say what did I say uh-huh I think so now you should listen to me

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:58.400
fucking idiots what it now for those that just started listening to show what

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.760
exactly do you mean by that I only called Maximizer like what how many

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.160
months ago how many months ago it was like at least three or four months ago

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:12.900
probably even before that anything is when DDR extreme came out the for the

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.760
Japanese console system so whenever the fuck that was probably I don't know but

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.480
I called it a long-ass time ago everyone said no that's so wrong because

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:31.480
This next period is the last one, but HA! I was right! I was right! I like being right.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:37.480
Uh, message from the chat room. Unknown Gamer says, tell Loki to shut the fuck up, he's a dork.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480
WE BAN YOU!

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:49.480
Alright, um, I'll play You're Not Here for those guys that haven't heard it, because this isn't a Kiriyamoka song, it rocks from Silent Hill 3, I will play that in this next break, but...

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:54.120
What do you guys think about this? Oh, I forgot to say Sugaru Apple Mix, my bad.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.360
Who cares? Alright. Oh, but then the screenshots also revealed that some of

01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360
the Oni songs

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.680
now have basic trip maniac steps, but some don't. Like the Wild Rush

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.400
don't. But I think... I want to say it was Sugaru

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.800
does. What's up with that? Yeah,

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.600
the Apple Mix does. Well, I think it was the Apple Mix. I know one of them I was

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.360
looking at had

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.720
a basic maniac trick steps all of a sudden.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.800
And it was like okay, so they went and did him for some but not for others

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:28.120
It might even be for you the befores the beat mix and I know hysteria 2001

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.700
They have basic trick and maniac steps. Thanks to

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:39.100
What was it the dancing stage games? So it's very possible. Those might be your mixed steps

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.680
This is true. Somebody told me that the love at first sight

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.160
You know how the maniac steps were in the there were maniac steps in dancing stage

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.960
age, but they were really easy. It was like a four-footer. That is the exact same steps

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.580
as Max2USA's trick steps. Somebody told me that a while back. I never went back to verify

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:09.480
that, but it sounds legit. Interesting. Anyway. But, I don't know. Any reaction to this, because

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.120
I was kind of, with all the clue given, you know how those folks that work at Konami,

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.400
they like to give clues, and we had Seagrid here a couple weeks ago, and he was kind of

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.680
telling us why they don't go to the extreme threat anymore.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.800
But nonetheless, they give out clues.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.680
They work hard to keep this stuff a secret.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.160
And then, kaboom, it's all spoiled.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.160
What do you guys think about that?

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.600
I think it's hilarious, trusting GamePro with

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.760
anything, because that magazine sucks.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.640
They don't even provide free demos.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.580
What the hell is that?

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:39.200
God damn it.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.160
If you want to stay competitive at this day and age,

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.640
you need to provide free demo discs so that people can steal

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:52.380
them out of your magazines. If you have a comment, you can call in on our Skype line

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:58.620
if you have something you want to say. Oh, I'm being told that the challenge songs do

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:05.140
not have new steps. Well, let me see where I got that from. It was somewhere in that

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:10.500
preview story. It talks about the screenshots. Let's see if I can find it. Where one of them

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:14.660
them had. I'm going to the site and I'm going to post the link in the chat room if I can

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:22.380
find them. There they are. Sugru Apple Mix, light, standard, heavy. Oh, right there. And

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:26.620
they say the screen shot is off center. Oh, so maybe somebody was scrolling around or

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:32.860
something was going on there. So maybe that's what happened there. Not sure. Interesting.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.780
Well, like, well, looking at it that way it does look like the song's a little bit off

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.180
So maybe the steps hadn't updated yet. Who knows?

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:48.900
Alright, well, it's nevertheless it's adding fuel to the fire that there are hidden steps or something. So whatever

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:56.720
Whatever so we might be wrong it wouldn't be the first time please. All right

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.840
Yeah, yeah, we have older makes two news too, but I'm just I'm kind of curious

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:18.840
I'm curious. GamePro kind of blowing the lid on this stuff. Is this... Do you think it could affect them getting demos from Konami in the future or do you think Konami is just kind of like eh, we were done with the extreme people anyway, forget it, let the list be spoiled or what do you guys think?

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840
Since nobody... Oh yes.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:30.240
It was bound to happen anyway because you know that always happens, you know, someone's gonna leak a list or something is gonna happen

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240
That's gonna just totally throw off the plan

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:40.640
Although honestly, I really think that before you print any screen captures or anything. You should run it by

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.660
you know

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.520
The people who are giving you the authority to do the article, right?

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.960
Yeah, it's very true very true

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.360
Uh, let's go to the Skype line.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.120
Zaku's trying to call back, so let's see if we can hear him now.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120
What's up, Zaku?

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.120
Uh, I'm hearing...

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.380
Hold on, I'm hearing that, uh, you know, I'm hearing Star Mine is gonna be up for Ultra

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:03.380
Mix 2.

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.380
Is that true?

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:05.380
Yes.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.380
Star Mine is confirmed for Ultra Mix 2.

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.560
Is there any other Beatmain and 2DX songs confirmed?

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.560
Yes.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.920
Uh, Root 80s was one of them, and who remembers the 2DX songs that were confirmed?

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.600
VJ Army was one of them.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.600
Wow.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.600
Oh hell, I don't remember the whole list right now.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600
I mean...

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.600
Some other B-menius, actually we're going to talk about Ultramix 2 in a little bit,

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.600
but those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.600
But there are brand new ones that are in Ultramix 2, it's pretty cool.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.600
Okay.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.600
Anything else?

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.600
Let me see, I'm trying to think...

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.600
Right on the light was another one. Thank you, Jason.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:50.600
Alright, well if you think of it, if you think of it, call us back later, dude.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.600
Alright, thanks.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.600
Alright, bye.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:13:00.600
So, yes, Ultramix 2, a nice little segue in Ultramix 2 because we did get some new songs announced for Ultramix 2 this week.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:09.600
We had two songs announced, Paul Oakenfold doing an Elvis remix of Rubberneckin' which was a fairly popular hit a couple months ago, earlier this year.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.560
this year so it's kind of neat to see that in DDR and we have a beat mania

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.160
song from beat mania the final we have an athletic song that was confirmed and

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.200
the song is hit and slap and I'm gonna play that for you guys right now it's

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.360
only like a little over a minute so here it is something you'll be dancing to an

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.720
Ultramix 2 this fall. Athletics with a hit and slap.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.360
I'm a cyber messenger, you at the end

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.360
Let us drop to the next zone

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.360
You know you're out of control

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.360
Come and throw to the end

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360
Yeah, let us drop to the next zone

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.360
You walking in, breaking in to the face

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360
Come and knock, child

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.360
Come and knock, child

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360
Throw, throw, throw

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.360
Keep this faith, we're at the end

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360
Come and knock, child

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.360
You're out of control

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.360
Come and throw

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.360
B-b-bit away, come and edge

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.360
I'm a conquer monster

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.360
Breathe away, you can sweat

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.360
Take the meat on first

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.360
In between, betray

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.360
Who the what must capture

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:52.200
Asletix with Hit and Slap, a new song announced for Ultramix 2 this week, kind of some mixed

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.200
reaction there in our chat room that, boy, it's rap, and usually you don't hear a lot

01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:02.020
of that in DDR. Well, I remember when Sigurd was here, he said that UltraMix 2 was kinda

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:06.320
opening up the genre. It's a lot more than your regular kinda genres you typically hear

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.140
in a DDR. For those that may not have heard him yet, I'll play little clips. We actually

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:14.420
played these songs in their entirety in previous weeks, but here are some more songs that were

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:37.700
confirmed for UltraMix II, Echo Image with Skulk.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:42.100
And of course a song we were lucky enough to be able to announce on air, Zonk with Tittle

01:15:42.100 --> 01:16:04.680
tattle.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:09.340
So it's a little weird but it's kind of, you know, I kind of like it. It's got a different

01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:13.500
little sound to it I think could be fun for DDR with the right steps and they

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:17.040
have promised us the folks that made Ultramix 2 that the steps this time

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.940
different people making them gonna be different stuff gonna be good stuff so

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:26.140
we will soon see this November is when they rumored that that game would be out

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:33.140
so we will see so let's see should we go to a break and play the other songs we

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:37.180
said we play all right why not we're gonna play in this break a Kiriyama Moka

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:42.180
with You're Not Here, which is going to be a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme USA.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.380
We're going to play that for you guys. And then we're going to play Pollock and Fold

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:49.660
with Elvis and Rubbernecken, because that's going to be in DDR UltraMix too. So you get

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:53.700
a little bit of both mixes. And actually, I encourage you all to go vote in the poll

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:57.660
on our website right now, because we're kind of taking a little poll over at orangelawnsradio.com.

01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:02.920
Look in the upper right hand corner. I'm kind of curious, which one of these two mixes are

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.260
you planning on buying this fall? Or are you going to buy them both? Or are you going to

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:10.620
neither one. Go to orangelawnsradio.com and look up in the upper right hand corner. Right

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:19.140
now, 41% plan to buy DDR Extreme. 41% also plan to buy both mixes. That's pretty good.

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:24.820
And only 6% plan to buy UltraMix 2 only. So it sounds like most people that get UltraMix

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:31.780
2 are buying Extreme as well. Kind of interesting. But go vote in our poll, orangelawnsradio.com.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.900
All right, here we go. We're going to go to this break, and we'll start off with Kiri

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:40.380
Amoka from DDR Extreme USA, you're not here. These, by the way, are full versions, so they're

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.840
about three minutes in length, not the DDR edits.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:49.840
we'll be back

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:19.840
Blue skies turn forever, raindrops blow in the wind and dancing

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:26.840
It would be a much better sight with you, with me

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:33.840
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.840
Never felt so lonely then you came along

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:42.840
So now what should I do?

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.840
I'm strong out, I need to see you

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.840
My body aches, now that you're gone

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.840
My supply fell through

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.840
You let me give me everything you had and more

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.840
You craved my happiness

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.840
When you made me feel torn in major smiles

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.840
But now, I feel your stress

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.840
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.840
No, even who has time but you?

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:21.840
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.840
To love

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.840
Oh, I feel your stress

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:54.840
Come on, come on, who has time for tears?

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.840
Come on, baby

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:04.840
Come on, come on, who has time for tears?

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:08.840
Yeah, yeah

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.820
All right now

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:24.980
Yeah, yeah

01:20:54.980 --> 01:21:19.620
And now, as promised, from Ultramix II, Elvis Presley versus Paul Oakenfold, Rubberneckin'

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:47.620
Look and listen, baby, let's find the philosophy

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:22.620
I like how you bring me to this country

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:38.620
The first thing in the mornin'

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.620
You'd rather see magic

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:46.620
Look there, everywhere I see you

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.620
Hey hey yeah

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.620
Look at this sun baby

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:54.620
I find lots of teeth

01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:57.620
It's all rough and naked

01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.620
Hey hey yeah

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:00.620
Look right with me

01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:01.620
Hey hey

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.620
People say I'm wasting time yeah

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.620
But I don't really care

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.620
I see what I like

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.620
I like what I see

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:48.120
It's my dream back home, child, all by myself

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:53.120
No team energy, I'm with you

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.120
Hey, stop, look and listen, baby

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:04.120
My philosophy is far up in neck and neck

01:24:34.120 --> 01:25:03.400
Welcome

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.600
back to Orange Lounge Radio. Certainly a different style of music there in Ultra

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.840
Mix 2. I think it's pretty cool, though. I like the direction they're going in. I

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.960
think a lot of people are kind of getting sick of all the tran- now, not me

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.200
personally. I love the trance music in the Japanese mixes and stuff, but I think

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.920
some people- I think there was a call out there for some different stuff, and Ultra

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.420
Mix 2 is certainly stepping up and answering that call, so I think it's

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:28.440
pretty cool. Honestly, I have to say that I was getting kind of tired of the trance

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.200
myself, but- How could you get tired of trance? But that's not to say Ultra Mix 2

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.480
won't have its share of trance. I mean it does have some. I was actually getting tired of the

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:42.520
happy stuff. You know like like love, love, sugar, cavity. You know that type of stuff.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:48.320
And speed mixes. I like the occasional speed mix but like too many of them is

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.540
wait. Hold on, Rice Princess is calling into the station, wants to say something.

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:57.600
What's up? Are you there?

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.880
Alright, if you can hear us, we can't hear you.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:06.720
Double check your mic and call us back. Bummer.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:11.200
Alright, also as a reminder, when you call us,

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.960
when our little red circle is on, we're probably not gonna see your call because

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.600
when we're

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.800
in do not disturb mode, that means we're doing other pieces of show.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.720
That means we're doing naughty things. Irene lucked out and I happened to be glancing over when she was

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:23.560
calling in there.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.520
But it didn't work, that's alright. We'll get back to her later.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:35.520
Meanwhile, I actually wanted to mention this before the show tonight, and I actually kind of want to make doing this a regular thing.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:39.520
Remember how I talked about starting up the Ultramix League?

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:44.520
I was actually online on DDR Ultramix before tonight's show, and it was actually kind of fun.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:50.520
Yes, there are still people, believe it or not, that are playing Ultramix. It's amazing.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:57.520
And I was on there playing, and that was the first time you'd ever really seen that in action, huh, DDRangel? You saw that. What'd you think of that, Angel?

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:03.520
The UltraMix stuff. I know I put the voices through the TV through a little bit too, although you could barely hear it, but what'd you think of that?

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:12.520
I thought it was really cool. I kinda want one now, see? But then again, I said that last week, so it looks like I need to save up my paychecks and just go for it.

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:19.120
just get everything like in a big fat bundle like if I need to save up until

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.560
ultra mix 2 comes out I'll do that and I'll just buy one and two the system

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:30.600
just everything and play so uh you have a DDR buddy now hmm

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.620
all right also what I noticed about ultra mix I thought was kind of funny

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:42.240
is that there's people on there that love to sing along to the songs with

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.360
their Xbox headsets on so that you can hear and like I was playing can't stop

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:54.880
falling in love and I heard this girl going and then you took the ferret and

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.980
you made it go off and they're like yes do it again it was funny so every now

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:03.680
and then I would just drop ferret noises on there or I would at the end I told

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.120
that woman I saw I told that girl I said something about like you're trying to

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.920
sing like Paul a Terry to throw me off aren't you but one thing that was kind

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.420
of annoying me about Ultramix that I really, really hope is fixed with Ultramix 2 is that

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:20.420
if I get a spot of lag, I get misses. Like, if I get, if I get any lag at all, I'll get

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:23.800
misses and boos. Like, even if I'm hitting the buttons, my whole game will freeze for

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.220
a minute with lag. That, I really, really hope they fixed that for Ultramix 2, because

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:30.620
that was annoying me. But tonight's the first time that's ever happened to me, actually.

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.140
It's probably because Loki was playing Final Fantasy XI at the same time.

01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:34.140
Addict.

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:37.860
Oh yeah, blame me. It's all my fault.

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:38.860
I blame you.

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:41.860
So?

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:45.860
I invoke female privilege to just offer my opinion.

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:51.860
I'm laying down like this so that one side of my nose will drain into the other and I won't be all stuffed up.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.860
Huh? I'm not on camera. My feet are.

01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.860
Alright.

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:02.860
Look at the webcam. See my feet?

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.860
Have you played DDRXBox at all?

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:10.860
even unwrapped the shrink wrapping off of it. You should sometime. I was gonna go download

01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:18.100
the song packs, but I got school. I do stuff now. I don't have a life anymore. I only played

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:22.600
for like 30 minutes before the show, it wasn't that much. I would actually sign on to Xbox

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:28.420
Live and play live on the show, but I don't know how well the voices would come out. I

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:32.100
don't know, should we try logging on right now, see if anybody's on? Sounds like a good

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:39.100
waster. No, Matt doesn't want to try it. Fine. I thought it could be an interesting piece.

01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:47.320
Let's wait and do it when we know it'll work. I'm sure it'll work, it's just, I don't think

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.240
it makes for great radio. The only problem with it is that the music drowns out the people

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.400
talking. I think it would be hilarious if we could go on there and mess with people

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.800
live on air, but unfortunately the music of the songs, they totally drown out the voices

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.800
if you're running it through the TV, so I don't think it's going to work.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.860
Oh well.

01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:11.860
This poster is disturbing and frightening.

01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:17.580
One for Rojin Z, which I've always wanted to see that and never have.

01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:21.060
It's a really creepy thing. It's a creepy old man.

01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:26.440
So anyway, my call to those of you that play on Xbox Live, please stop singing.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.860
or wait until karaoke revolution xbox comes out

01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:32.700
well you know getting that

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:35.620
see now the whole now the chat room saying do it

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:39.420
they want us to try it and do it

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.820
I should've kept my mouth shut maybe after the cage match I wanna give Loki

01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:45.120
time to set it up if we're gonna do it

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:49.720
we're gonna do the cage match first though

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:54.200
we will do hold on I'm trying to find holic

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.200
I vote for Holic.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.920
We have to set up our wires if we're going to get on DDR UltraMix, so...

01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.920
Hey Rob.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.920
What?

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.440
If I, like, bring Holic and then, like, add, like, an extra beat to the end, does that

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.440
count as a remix?

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.440
I can use Holic.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:06.440
No.

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.440
Damn.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.440
Alright.

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:13.680
Uh, let's see, we're going to go on to the Cage Match.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.720
I gotta get the song skewed up, though.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.560
Before we get to the Cage Match, let's plug our spin-off shows.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:24.000
Monday Night, Diversion, 7 O'Clock, Bamani Remixes, It Rocks!

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:30.540
to it or you suck. Tuesday night. Is Pump Up the Volume? It's like supposed to start

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:35.220
at 7 for a pre-show, but I usually get really bored and start things around a quarter till

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:41.300
sometimes 6.30. Of course that's a specific time for all of our other time zone people.

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:46.780
7.30 starts the real show because I now have to get up for work at 5.30 in the morning

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:52.580
the next day. I have been cutting it off right at 10.30, 11 o'clock. You know, if I don't

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:56.780
have to do anything the next day or, you know, if I don't foresee the need for sleep, I'll

01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:01.220
just keep going because I'll be like, oh wait, I'm still running the show, huh? Um, it's

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:05.380
supposed to be a request show, but it's really been more or less me just marathoning types

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:10.620
of music. The past few weeks I've been playing whole albums. Um, in fact, this past Tuesday

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:17.220
I played the Silent Hill 4 US soundtrack. So, um, who knows what I'll be playing this

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:22.220
Actually, I do believe that this week I'm going to be playing overclocked remixes.

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:23.220
Oh, cool.

01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:29.220
So, I might need to go download some more, but I'm probably going to be doing a whole bunch of overclocked remixes,

01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:33.220
and then maybe tossing in some anime themes, just sort of in the mood for that.

01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:42.220
But I also, it's actually a special request from one of our listeners and a very good friend of mine, Marinchan,

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:46.040
because we got talking about the overclock remixes one night so

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.480
here you go, we'll play overclock remixes Tuesday

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.680
Wednesday night on the station if you were listening last Wednesday

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:57.240
you heard a special sneak preview we didn't announce it but the brand new

01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:00.720
outside the box which is basically an upgraded version of vanilla sky

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:05.000
you remember that old show it's coming back its premiere is this Wednesday

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.800
seven o'clock on the station other video game types of chat and

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.940
random stuff so definitely tune in

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:14.880
for that okay do you want to do xbox live before after cage match

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.360
we don't want to play against people we know we want to play against random

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.080

so people know which ones me so that's good what

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:37.760
if I like they make microphones and shit

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:44.760
for the Xbox, you know, karaoke game and we can plug it in where, like, you know, the

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:51.820
normal, you know, headset thing would go. I might be able to wire something where our

01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:57.840
output can go into there. You know, while they're playing it, that'd be fun.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:04.840
Well, you know, I think you can use just a normal micro... the small jack ones on your

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:15.240
controller. Yeah, because I broke my headset one time for PSO, and there was one that got

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:19.960
like a Radio Shack. Maybe we can do something. Alright, well anyway, let's get to the Cage

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:26.280
Match, so we can do the Xbox Live thing. Alright, the way the Cage Match works, we have some

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:29.840
new people listening tonight, so let me explain this. We're going to play three songs for

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.160
you guys each host brings one song to the table you pick your favorite of the

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:39.800
three songs by placing a private vote in our chat room www.orangelongsradio.com

click on chat and our kind regulars there will tell you how to place a vote

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:46.580
remember you can't vote until all three songs have been played so wait for me to

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:52.220
tell you to vote before you vote three songs you only get to hear a clip of

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:55.100
last week's winner though because you know it's the winner and you heard it

01:34:55.100 --> 01:35:00.780
last week so I get to hear a clip and last week's winner this case was Loki

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:07.660
with two-time champion Nuon which is by supposedly it's by out phase phase out

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:11.780
but we know that the mp3 had to have been mislabeled so we're calling it

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:17.100
phase out so phase out is our two week in a row winner and here it is a clip of

01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:24.100
last week's winner, song number one you can vote for tonight, Faze Out with New On.

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:57.980
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:00.040
That was Outfazed with Nuon.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.060
Song number two comes from...

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:03.060
That's not Outfazed, actually.

01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.060
It's Phased Out.

01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:05.060
We're calling it...

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.860
Song number two comes to us from Jamie.

01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:07.860
Okay.

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:10.800
Jamie, you want me to introduce your song then?

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.240
Jamie has brought to the table Bond.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:17.620
know those four chicks with the violins that play classical music and it's called

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:22.580
shine it's the dub chakra mix and the reason why she picked this one is well

01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:29.260
she likes yeah but it has samples from Afrinova it has samples from Afrinova in

01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:32.980
it and for those that says she picked this song already she's saying it's a

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:37.140
different mix and I think it is oh you picked a different one all right well it

01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:42.520
has bond and samples of Afrinova so see if you like it although it's not really

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.520
samples of Afrinova. It's just the fact, yeah, they're public domain samples that Afrinova also used.

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:50.520
It's not the one that I used before was, um...

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.520
It started off with, um, a really...

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.520
I'll play it on Tuesday. I picked a different song before.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.520
I played this one on the show before to play the samples.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.520
Right, I remember that. I remember that. Alright. Here we go. Bond with Shine.

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:12.000
the Dubs Chakra mix with that same sample in Afrinova. Alright, here we go.

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:11.520
.

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.520
.

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.520
.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.520
.

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:31.520
.

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.920
AHHH!!

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:23.720
All right. That was song number two. Tonight's cage match. That was Bond with Shine, the

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:29.960
dub chakra mix. What do you guys think of that one?

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:35.960
I really like that song. It's just really laid back. I listen to it all the time.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:42.960
It gets a 9 from me. I mean, I've listened to it a whole bunch, but I've intended to use it per cage match once and never did.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.960
So I just figured I may as well do it now. I've said it on my show a few times.

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.960
I just really think it's different. It's really different.

01:43:51.960 --> 01:44:00.960
kostjamrh I'll give it a 9 out of 10. It's pretty good soothing. I don't have that Afrinova part I heard.

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:07.960
But other than that, it's very well done with the violin and all that stuff.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:15.960
Alright. Uh, a scale of 110? Oh, no, I'm sorry, I missed the night. Sorry. Uh, Angel?

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:26.960
Um, dammit. Okay, the mic's working. There we go. I heard myself. Um, 9.5. It's cool. I like it. It's Bond. That's like a given.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:36.920
alright Loki it's okay honestly the samples of whatever

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:43.080
after Nova the tribal people do not fit in the song at all but whatever you know

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:48.720
it's bond so I'm gonna give it a lower score because it's bond bond doesn't do

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.860
any original shit anyway so they're gonna get a seven take is I just you

01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:58.700
know I've heard that song and I'm just tired of that you know they can stop

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:05.980
anytime Bradley I thought was really cool what well the beat give it a nine I

01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:10.540
actually like that song a lot as a song I'm just not sure I'm down with it for

01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:14.900
like a cage match I don't know I just it's not just a bouncy-dancy the other

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:19.980
will you I think it would be very free-stylable I give it an eight as a

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:22.980
That's a song I give it a 9. That's a page match pick I give it an 8.

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:31.980
Alright. My turn. And I've picked a song by a band that's actually already in rotation on our station because they were on one of the Fantasia albums.

01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:35.980
They're a really popular trance band. They're on Robins Entertainment here in the U.S.

01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:41.980
Same label as Ian Vandal and Paul O'con- No. He's not on that label.

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:45.980
Ian Vandal and DJ Sammy is another big one on that label.

01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:52.240
I'm kind of surprised they haven't ended up in DDR yet. The band is Lasko and this is their brand new single that just came out

01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:57.520
It's called surrender just came out in the US this week. Actually, it's been out in Britain a little while

01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:04.520
but just come out in the US this week. It's my pick, Lasko with Surrender. Enjoy.

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:50.520
To say that I can't trust you, I don't know Every time I'm near you, I lose control

01:46:50.520 --> 01:47:01.520
be out of my mind to let you in. Maybe I should try to find my strength within.

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:15.520
It's only a matter of time and I will surrender. Just give me a little more time to open my mind.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:27.520
Only a matter of time, and I will surrender, I'll surrender to you

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.520
Go!

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:45.520
The tears are leaving far behind

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:49.520
To resist you, I don't know how

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:52.520
Love sometimes can be unkind

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.520
Should I lay my heart on the line now?

01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:03.520
When sensation comes along, I can't hide it, I can't fight it

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:06.020
Feelings inside are getting strong

01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.020
Do not deny it

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:10.020
You've got it

01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:43.020
It's only a matter of time, and I will surrender

01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:49.020
Just give me a little more time to open my mind

01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:56.020
It's only a matter of time, and I will surrender

01:48:56.020 --> 01:49:05.020
We're in love, we're in love for you

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:33.580
every week. Trans is old. Trans is very boring. You have to be in the mood for it and too

01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:41.180
much is too much of anything. However, that was still good. I like the song, but I'm just

01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:47.540
so burned out on Trans right now that I can't stay with it. So, I'm actually going to be

01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:51.820
nice. It gets an 8 from me because, I mean, overall it's really good. I'm trying to vote

01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:55.780
as though I would have voted were I'm not tired of Trans. So, yeah.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:59.700
all right who voted next uh jonas

01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:04.900
i actually heard this song before it's one of the dream dance volumes i think

01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:11.460
i'll give it an 8.5 have some repeated samples

01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:15.860
kind of sound a little repetitive but the singing was pretty good and

01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:19.940
it still sounds pretty good so all right angel

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:23.460
well uh let's see you know i'm a last girl fangirl so

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:25.460
You know it's gonna get a 10 from me.

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:27.460
At least I got one supporter, alright.

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:29.460
10 from Angel. Loki!

01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:33.460
It gets a 10 because it's not Bond.

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:35.460
Ouch!

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:39.460
And a glare. I see a glare coming from Jamie.

01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:41.460
Alright. Arcadian.

01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:45.460
That was alright. Didn't seem all that great to me, though.

01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:47.460
Sorta, sounded sorta generic.

01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:49.460
I probably wasn't really listening to it.

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.460
I'd give it like 6.5.

01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:56.540
I don't know. To me, it's like the quintessential trance pop song. Like, if somebody were to

01:50:56.540 --> 01:51:02.540
say, Rob, play me some trance pop, I'd play that. I like it. It's cute. I give it a nine.

01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:08.300
All right. Okay, here it is. We're going to recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:12.820
Let's see if Nuon goes three weeks in a row, or if we get Bond or Lasko as a new champ

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:18.820
tonight. Here we go. Here's a recap. Song number one, Phase Out with Nuon. I always

01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:21.820
I always pick that clip, I don't like it.

01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:33.820
Song number two tonight is Bond with Shine, the dub chakra mix.

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:40.820
Song number three tonight is Lasko with Surrender.

01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:15.820
Alright, guys. Place vote now. You may place your vote in the chatroom by sending a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your votes.

01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:29.820
Alright. As promised, we're going to try this horrible experiment out. I don't think this is going to go over very well, but the chatroom asked we do it, so we're going to get onto Xbox Live and harass people randomly on UltraMix.

01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:34.440
alright so let's see I have to get suited up here though let me let me head

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:39.080
over to get suited up let me get the mic over let me yeah yeah so you have to say

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:41.940
bye to the chat room for a minute Jamie because we're gonna switch it over and I

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:46.760
have to get suited up hold on somebody talk while I get suited up

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:57.120
Ah, he's putting on the headset.

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.320
You know, I remember that thing.

01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:03.080
I remember having an indention in the side of my head from playing Phantasy Star Online

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.000
for six hours.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.720
I'm kinda glad I quit.

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:14.720
Yeah, Rob?

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.040
Alright. Wait, aren't we gonna switch the camera over to Xbox, right?

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:31.520
Eh, it'll be fun.

01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:38.520
p0k3smot42o my headset broke, we have a catastrophe

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.520
My headset broke. We have a catastrophe.

01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:01.520
I'm getting suited up. Sorry guys, I broke my headset.

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:19.120
I have to set it up so we can hear the voices through the TV, which hopefully we will.

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:22.880
So I just changed the settings so that the voices will come through the TV, so hopefully

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:25.640
you guys can hear the folks that chat with me on Xbox Live.

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.720
Now chat listeners, don't join the game just because we're in it.

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:35.040
I know who you are, so I'm going to set up a match, and let's do a light song, because

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:38.660
I'm going to pretend to be somebody that doesn't know how to play DDR, and then I'm going to

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:45.660
regulate at the game, okay. So let's see, um, let's do, you want to do DXY? All right,

01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:53.020
they want DXY. It's the old DXY banner. That's cool. All right, so we're going to do a match

01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:56.000
on DXY. Okay, let's see if anybody joins. I'm going to do three public slots, we'll

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
See if anybody joins. I'm going to mute my mic for now.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Alright, so I'm waiting for people to join the match, so we'll see what happens here.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
I think you'd get more players if you were on a harder setting.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000
No, actually, you'd be surprised. You get a lot of people on the light settings here, so we're going to see if anyone joins.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Um, Loki, any feedback from our chat room? Because you're a little closer to the chat room over there.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I know you're overworked here on this show.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:26.000
this

01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:32.480
leave it to somebody to try and ruin the god damn

01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:34.300
did you see what happened there

01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:37.360
yes somebody's trying to come in and ruin our live experiment here so that's

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.640
okay i think i'm blocking

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.000
i'll try that again

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.840
fake laws who always want attention on the more on

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:53.840
the way that i remember i can buy them

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:07.760
there we go if they joined their muted so we would be able to hear and so it

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:12.400
doesn't know good to join anymore

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.700
got a lot of xbox live alright

01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:19.700
Let's try this again. Now we're sitting in there waiting for somebody to hopefully join, so...

01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:21.700
Blocked! Ha ha!

01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:23.700
Well, they're not blocked, we just can't hear them.

01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:24.700
I know.

01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:25.700
So they can do whatever they want.

01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:26.700
So it doesn't matter.

01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.700
Yeah, it doesn't matter what they say.

01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:28.700
He's an idiot.

01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:30.700
Alright.

01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:32.700
I actually wonder if there's a way we can...

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:34.700
Try booting.

01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:36.700
There is no boot option.

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.700
I'm gonna... You know what, Chat Room?

01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:43.700
If this is all we're gonna get, is one loser with nothing better to do, then we're gonna end this segment.

01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:46.700
And you guys suck for suggesting we should do it.

01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:51.700
I don't know if we can...

01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:55.700
I wonder what this does.

01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.700
I wonder if you can send, like, a screaming feedback.

01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:00.700
Nah. I'm not gonna bother. I'm not gonna bother.

01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:02.700
I'm just gonna...

01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:04.700
The thing's muted, so they can't do anything anyway.

01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:06.700
Those are no good to be on.

01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:08.700
Ooh, we got somebody.

01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:11.700
Finally.

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:16.700
Yes, we got a match. Okay, now hopefully everybody says they can start. Yes.

01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:19.700
Alright, set your mind down. I'll do commentary.

01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:20.700
Alright.

01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:27.700
Here we go. Are you ready? Dance!

01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:53.260
Does anyone know how to play this game?

01:57:53.260 --> 01:58:11.260
It looks like player one can take this one!

01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:12.260
Yeah!

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:13.260
Let's hear it!

01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:19.260
Player 2, you're on fire!

01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:25.260
Player 1 has the advantage!

01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:31.260
Watch out!

01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:41.260
Call the fire department! We've got a five-alarm dancer!

01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:43.260
Just disturb that.

01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:46.260
Oh, wow!

01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:55.260
Quick, call the fire department! We've got a five-alarm dancing!

01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:00.260
Oh, no!

01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:08.260
Player two, give it your all!

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:11.260
I missed like one step at the end there.

01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:18.260
Let's hear it for player one!

01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:20.260
Ha ha!

01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:24.260
Wow, I won. How did I do that? I won. I can't believe it.

01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:28.260
I'm so excited. I got three points.

01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:36.260
Those guys were losers. They didn't even talk at all. What a waste of a segment that was.

01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:40.660
I'm never letting the chat room pick a segment for us again.

01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:42.880
You know the only good thing we got out of that segment?

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:44.260
Was getting to hear DXY.

01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:45.100
You know what?

01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:45.920
What?

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.540
I'd like to play the chat room.

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:49.220
You wanna play against chat room listeners?

01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:50.060
No, I would like to.

01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:50.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:51.720
Yeah, we'll switch it back over to chat.

01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:54.420
Don't worry about that.

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:55.260
Loki's getting to work.

01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:56.080
Great.

01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:56.920
Yeah.

01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.040
What a fun thing that that was.

01:59:58.040 --> 01:59:58.980
What did we get?

01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:00.920
We got one person with nothing better to do

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.340
than to stalk this show.

02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:03.900
And we got two people who didn't even talk

02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:09.900
we tried to you know get him to say stuff boring I think someone has a and

02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:12.700
everybody got to see me break my combo at the end there and see what a horrible

02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:18.900
DDR player I am God yeah you know I was I was gonna come up on the show today

02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:25.220
and apologize for for you know bringing old drama in and everything you can't

02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:29.300
apologize for something that somebody else keeps perpetuating that's fucked up

02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:37.900
you need to stop that that message in the chatroom is from Loki he's mumbling

02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:43.380
incoherently at the stupidity of some people yeah right at least I won so I

02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:47.740
feel a little better at least I didn't get my ass kicked dumbass got like nearly

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:52.460
last yeah that made me feel a little pathetic that made me feel a little

02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:58.600
better and I'm on a controller I'm trying to do a hold a controller and do

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.160
the show at the same time so I just wanted to share that do you think it's

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.280
wrong of me to be playing on a controller when other people when other

02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:14.040
people are on dance pads they say no all right well I guess what we'll do is

02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:16.520
we'll go to a break and when we come back we'll find out the winner of the

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:19.880
tonight's cage match and we'll do the F use of the week but please don't send

02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:25.360
the F use yet because we'll get to those a little bit later okay guys I'm still

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:28.360
got a Cali the cage match vote so in this break what do we want to hear this

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:36.360
Let's do Five Key Stuff. I wanna hear Five Key Stuff. I wanna hear Prince on a Star. So we're gonna hear Prince on a Star.

02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:40.360
Oh my god, you have to play, um, you have to play Lynn 1999.

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:45.360
Alright. Jamie wants to hear Lynn 1999, and, uh, how about the Metal Gear Solid song from BeatMania 3?

02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:46.360
Hey, that's cool.

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:48.360
Alright, we'll be back after this. Enjoy.

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:23.360
He was walking along the road like strangers

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:28.360
Doing what they think he is more

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:35.360
He's been trying and trying for size

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:38.360
He gets lost the more that he tries

02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:40.360
Why oh why?

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:41.360
He feels all the same

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.360
He feels all the same, try oh why

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:45.360
He says he's right

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:49.360
When the moon is too high

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:03.360
He gets lost

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:05.360
The more that he tries

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:07.360
Why oh why

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:09.360
He feels all the same, try oh why

02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:16.360
I've got a woman in here I'm not afraid to help me out

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.360
RE-MAX

02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:47.360
RE-RE-RE-RE-RE-MAX

02:04:47.360 --> 02:05:05.160
We mixed.

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:45.160
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:48.160
Roll this down and take a man that wants a bag

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:52.160
I'm gonna kick your asses, beat them, kill them all

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:54.160
Down, what am I gonna do?

02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:56.160
Down, what am I gonna do?

02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:58.160
Down, what am I gonna do?

02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:12.720
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:13.720
Nooooooo!

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:20.200
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani Radio.

02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:24.280
We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, and yes, you may have noticed a little while ago

02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:29.040
that we disappeared from the Skype line for a little while because I was getting flooded

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:33.160
with phone calls. People were not understanding when the little red lights up, you don't call.

02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:36.680
So I just went offline so people would stop bugging us while we're trying to do other

02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:40.080
parts of the show. But I did bring it back up and it's online now and we're ready to

02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:45.360
take calls if somebody wants to give us a call. And look, look at that, coming in right

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.360
now.

02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:47.360
Who do we have?

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:48.360
Hello, you're on Orange On The Radio.

02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:49.360
Hey.

02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.360
Yes.

02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:51.360
Can you hear me?

02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:52.360
Yes, we can.

02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:56.360
A long time listener, first time caller.

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:58.360
Oh, yes, okay.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:02.360
I really like that show you play on Wednesdays. What's it called?

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:09.360
Oh, yes, Wednesday's show. I think it's called Outside Irene's Box. No, Outside the Box. That's what it's called.

02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:13.360
Yeah, that's a good show. Everybody should listen to that.

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:18.360
Hey, that would be a great time. I think everybody should listen to that show.

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:25.360
And, uh, is it true you guys are gonna play a remix of that song, um, what's it called, from Silent Hill 4?

02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:28.360
Um, which one? The Your Rain?

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:32.360
Yeah, aren't you gonna play a Your Rain remix? I heard about that.

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:34.360
That was a couple weeks ago that we did that.

02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:35.360
What?

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.360
We did that a couple weeks ago.

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.360
Are you saying I missed it?

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:39.360
Yes, you missed it.

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.360
Aw, fuck!

02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:45.360
But that, you know what, just for you, kind sir, I'll play it again later in the show.

02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:46.360
Aw, thank you very much.

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:49.360
Oh, you're welcome very much. Thanks for calling!

02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:53.360
Alright, bye.

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:57.360
See, that's a good Skype call right there. Alright.

02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:00.360
I've played it every week on my show.

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:01.360
Have you?

02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:02.360
Yes, I have.

02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.360
Well then, you know.

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.360
Because I have marathoned the Silent Hill 4US soundtrack.

02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.360
Oh, people should turn in.

02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.360
If people listened, they would know.

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:12.360
I know, I know.

02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:16.360
No one ever requests anything on my show either.

02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:20.360
So, Skyblind's open if you want to call in.

02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:24.360
Call us.

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:28.360
Pick up the phone.

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:32.360
1-900-HOT-POTATO

02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:36.360
Some people never learn.

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:40.360
Hey, I'm just glad they're listening and keeping our ratings up.

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.360
This is good.

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:42.360
You know what?

02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:43.360
What's that?

02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:44.360
I have a theory.

02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.360
Okay.

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:50.280
Um, I think that, that there was no sperm involved in that person's creation.

02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:51.280
Anyway.

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:52.720
I think that it was Jell-O.

02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:57.680
Let's, let's talk about who won tonight's cage match.

02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:01.880
Uh, we have a new winner in tonight's cage match, finally.

02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:02.880
Finally.

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:03.880
Loki has to pick a new song.

02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:04.880
Cause we have a new winner.

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:05.880
Woohoo!

02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:09.880
Woohoo! I don't have to do shit next week!

02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:15.880
Bond won the cage match, and better yet, we're getting another call.

02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:19.880
Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:21.880
Hey, it is Dark Knight.

02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:22.880
Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing?

02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:23.880
Hello.

02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:25.880
I'm all right, how'd I go?

02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:27.880
Uh, we're pretty good. What's on your mind?

02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:31.880
Not much. I'd say that the last call should make a classic call of the week.

02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:34.880
Yeah, I think we should make that classic call of the week.

02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:41.160
You don't want to do anything to try and one-up that call?

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:44.440
I can't come up with anything close.

02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:49.320
Alright, alright. Hey, what do you think about how Ultramix 2's shaping up?

02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.520
With some of those new songs announced this week?

02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:55.840
It's pretty decent, but

02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:59.080
I'm still like, no Xbox me, I'm not touching it.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.760
I know, it was so hard for a long time to have to kinda

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:07.200
finally say oh I got a cave them by the Xbox but I tell you what once I got it

02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:11.860
there is actually some decent games on it one or two but DDR is one of them so

02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:15.900
it's it's worth it it's worth it I'd tell you what though on that suggestion

02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:19.320
about having a few play against you yes I'm like somebody said no I'm chambering

02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:24.580
what why you didn't play a heart song because I wanted I didn't want I wanted

02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:28.140
other people that don't listen to the show to come into the game and play and

02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:31.980
we would kind of mess with them a little bit like I'd say I'd never played DDR

02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:36.020
before and hopefully they would talk, because usually the lamer people are the ones that

02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:40.460
play the light songs. So I sort of was trying to bait some of the younger players and stuff,

02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:44.340
but it didn't work. We only got a couple losers that can't get over themselves that wanted

02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:49.220
to join and people that don't talk, so. What can you do?

02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:54.540
It was yet another failed radio experiment on this show, but that's okay, it happens.

02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:56.220
Trial and error, buddy, trial and error.

02:10:56.220 --> 02:10:59.800
This whole show is one big failed experiment sometimes, it feels like, but hey, that's

02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:00.800
all right.

02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:01.800
No, it's not.

02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:02.800
All right.

02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:03.800
All right.

02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:04.800
Oh, yes, Angel.

02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:05.800
Hey, Dark Knight.

02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:06.800
Hey, Angel.

02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:09.800
Don't you have something else you want to say other than a shout-out?

02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:10.800
Hi.

02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:11.800
Hi.

02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:12.800
Hi.

02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:13.800
Hi.

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:14.800
Hi.

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:15.800
And he's cool.

02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:16.800
Hey, Rob.

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:17.800
Yes.

02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:18.800
Rob.

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:19.800
Yes.

02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.800
Rob.

02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:21.800
Yes.

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:22.800
Rob.

02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.800
What?

02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:24.800
What?

02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:25.800
What?

02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:26.800
What?

02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:27.800
What?

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:28.800
What?

02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:29.800
What?

02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.720
Zeno in our chat room raises a point about the folks on Ultramix.

02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.400
There's hardly anybody that wants to play the heavy stuff because a lot of

02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.160
them are actually on dance pads.

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:42.600
And it's kinda hard to play heavy stuff on dance pads so he says nobody plays

02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:44.680
heavy and from what I've seen that's kinda true.

02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:47.640
Zaku's calling back so I thought we'd pick up his call. What's up, Zaku?

02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:50.560
Woah!

02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:55.560
I'm just wondering, what are the chances of, um...

02:11:55.560 --> 02:12:12.560
I'm just wondering exactly why does Microsoft have favoritism towards Konami in that sense

02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:20.560
because they get downloaded songs and while PS2 users get crapped on because even though

02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:24.560
we already have a hard drive there's no way in God's green earth we're actually going

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:28.400
be able to download songs, so we're basically screwed.

02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:29.200
Good points.

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:30.360
I'm going to go ahead and let you go,

02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:31.640
because our connection's a little crappy.

02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:32.840
But I'm going to talk about this point.

02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:33.800
So tune back into the show.

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:35.480
We're going to talk about this, OK?

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.760
All right.

02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:40.720
Why is it that UltraMix 2 folks get to download songs,

02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:43.000
but the PS2 folks don't?

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.760
Why do you think that is?

02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:46.520
My own thought is that I think they've

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:49.720
been trying to take PS2 games in one direction

02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:51.280
and UltraMix in the other direction.

02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:56.240
Because if PS2 had everything the Xbox game had, same song list, same everything, you

02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:58.440
wouldn't buy both of them.

02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:01.640
I would.

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:05.720
The few hardcore folks that would just be all about supporting Bomani, yes, they still

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:06.720
would.

02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:08.220
But the majority of people would not buy both games.

02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:14.240
But if PS2 is allowed to have its iToy thing going one way, and Xbox has its live thing

02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:19.480
going one way, then, you know, that's to me kind of, I think, Konami trying to shape both

02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:20.480
games in a different way.

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.520
two of the strongest points of each system and making that the focal point.

02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:28.240
I don't think it has anything to do with Microsoft sucking Konami off to get them to do that

02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:34.360
or anything, although I do know that Microsoft uses DDR UltraMix to show other developers,

02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:37.920
hey, look what you can do with a game and how you can make money, because they've been

02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.160
making a lot of money off those song packs. So, it's a smart idea for them to be doing

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:50.000
it. As to is it fair or not, well, honestly, being an Xbox owner and a Playstation 2 owner,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:56.400
Xbox, it really, really does have the better online stuff. I mean, PS2 has good online

02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:59.380
stuff, but it's just not quite as well developed yet, so I guess...

02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:00.680
Yeah, I guess C-Star Online.

02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:05.280
Yeah, I know. So, I think that's just the way it's going to be for a little while, but

02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:10.840
PS2, I think there's going to be other things to account for that. And GameCube, don't...

02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:14.720
I mean, sucks to be a GameCube user, because you're never going to see a DDR mix, probably.

02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:19.600
Probably not. The only thing that GameCube has going for it as far as online play is

02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:24.040
new PSO that's coming out for it but apart from that. Yeah, I mean, but that has nothing

02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:29.040
to do with Konami and stuff. No. And again, it's nothing to do with favoritism or... Yes,

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:35.580
it just has, of the three, the worst online. I mean, seriously, it's not all that strong.

02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:39.920
I mean, I talk to people who get booted off of it all the time. Yeah. You know, Xbox is

02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:45.800
built to be an online system. Yes, it is. You know, you have to look, you know, I look

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:52.480
at it this way. A system is only as good as the games that are on it. And I have said

02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:57.060
this since the days where people are going, well the Saturn sucks. Well, no it doesn't.

02:14:57.060 --> 02:15:02.900
You're just playing games that suck. But if you take a look at the Xbox, it's built with

02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:08.700
the online capacity. It's built with a hard drive. Look at the PS2. These are peripherals.

02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:15.220
These are things that were added on later. The first model PS2, I have a Japanese PlayStation

02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:17.900
it doesn't have anywhere to put a hard drive in it, I'm sorry.

02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:22.740
It has to have an external hard drive. It's an afterthought.

02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:25.980
You have to look at what a system is built to do and then see,

02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:29.660
well, am I going to use this capacity that the machine has?

02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:34.900
I do understand that the point's being brought up, but it just kinda sucks that you have to pay

02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:40.180
an Xbox Live fee over and above, because on PS2 you don't usually have to pay extra fees,

02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:44.420
maybe certain games. But on Xbox, if you want to play anything online, you gotta pay that extra fee.

02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:47.300
So it's what's ten dollars a month? You know, it's nothing

02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:51.080
But it's still I mean say it's it's a lot of money

02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:56.780
Is it a lot of but a lot of the games that have online don't all don't often require that you pay for the online

02:15:56.780 --> 02:16:00.100
With the game, you know, they're getting their back in this

02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:04.860
Yeah, that's sort of a trade-off is that then the games don't really only games that I really see, you know

02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:11.020
Justifying having that extra feel like for example fantasy star online because they have to mean they have to keep the servers up, right?

02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:14.660
Well, it costs for maintenance there, so of course they're going to have to charge what

02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:16.720
the $9 a month that it is.

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:21.660
That's the thing is that, you know, you're paying that little bit a month for the Xbox

02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:25.100
Live, but for most of the other online, you're getting that for free.

02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:30.980
And then some of the others, you're paying a very minimal amount to get it over.

02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:35.260
But then, of course, it comes up, the fact that Xbox Live doesn't support dial-up.

02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:38.180
That's just because it's so intense, all the bandwidth.

02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:39.500
I mean, you saw what we were playing there.

02:16:39.500 --> 02:16:40.500
We have voice going over.

02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:45.500
You can do dial-up, but you have to get extra stuff, right? How would you hook that up, Loki?

02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:48.500
Hell if I know. I know you can do it.

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:52.500
If you go to the Microsoft site, I think that they have a dial-up adapter.

02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:58.500
There's a way to do it. I think over on DDR Freak there's a thread about how to get the service packs with dial-up.

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:03.500
I know somebody wrote an FAQ on that. I don't remember who or where it's at, but you can find it.

02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:07.500
On top of that, though, I mean these days there's hardly any excuse not to have broadband.

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:11.500
Well, you may still live in an area that doesn't have it. Very possible.

02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:14.500
Well, if you live in an area that doesn't have it, that's understandable.

02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:20.500
But if you're thinking of expense, broadband now is, you know, sometimes cheaper than, you know, another phone line.

02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:22.500
Very true.

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:26.500
All right, I'll open up the Skype line for a little bit more here, see if anybody wants to call in.

02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:28.500
But otherwise, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:34.500
We did, by the way, boys and girls, we had another net split, so about half our chat room can't get in.

02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:38.500
So, let's take this call. Our old buddy Jason's calling in. What's up?

02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.500
Hello, Rob.

02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:40.500
Hi, Jason. How ya doin'?

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:46.500
I just heard you guys start mentioning the, uh, ILUT connections to Xbox Live and thought I'd give you a ring again.

02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:47.500
Okay, yeah. What's up?

02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:52.500
Um, well, you know, as we all know now, as soon as DDR3 comes back up, um...

02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:55.500
Yeah, it's down today. What's up? Who broke it? Did you break it?

02:17:55.500 --> 02:18:03.500
I talked... I talked Blue and J-Dog and they're... they're hashing something out, so they'll get it up hopefully sometime tonight, if not tomorrow morning.

02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:07.500
I'm sorry I broke it. I was just too much for it, you know.

02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:09.500
She coughed on it and it broke.

02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:11.500
It caught my cooties.

02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:14.500
What's up with the dial-up stuff in Xbox Live?

02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:20.500
So when it's back up, there's two really good resources that Cutris posted in the console games forum.

02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:26.500
One of them is dial-up users that want to connect to Xbox Live.

02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:33.100
it's basically you have to create you have to get a connection on your

02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:37.580
computer and then have a way of running another network cable out to the Xbox

02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:41.020
because that's the only way of plugging it in and then do internet connection

02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:46.540
sharing so Xbox you know connects and then it just uses your PC's bandwidth to

02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:51.660
well to do the work what a pain in the ass it's something that I did for a

02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:54.460
while before I got my router as a matter of fact Wow

02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:59.460
UltraMix makes it really, really easy if you have anything else. Google.

02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:04.460
Alright, Google. Alright, well thanks for the tip, Jason. I'm sure some of our listeners appreciate that.

02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:05.460
No problem.

02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:09.460
Alright, you have a good one, buddy. Anything else you wanted to say? Anything else about UltraMix or any of that stuff?

02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:14.460
They'll appreciate it a lot more as soon as DDR3 comes back up and they can actually read how to do it.

02:19:14.460 --> 02:19:18.460
Alright. Hey, was it just me or did that UltraMix segment kind of suck?

02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:22.460
Uh, at the start of it sucked and yeah, it did. Nobody talked.

02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:24.960
Yeah, well. I tried, Jason. I tried for you.

02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:26.460
You're very good for doing so.

02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:27.460
Alright, take care.

02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:28.460
Thanks.

02:19:30.460 --> 02:19:33.460
Why not? We're actually getting a lot of people on Skype now. It's kind of cool.

02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:37.460
So, uh, open it up one more time. See if anybody else wants to call in.

02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:39.460
If not, we'll go into the FUs of the Week.

02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:41.960
I'm kind of waiting for our net thing to reconnect.

02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:44.460
So, I don't know what's up, guys.

02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:47.960
We may have to do the FUs of the Week with limited chatroom FUs this week.

02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:49.460
I will open up my email.

02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:53.460
Well, if we haven't reconnected yet, then I'll open up the email.

02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:56.460
So, we'll see.

02:19:56.460 --> 02:20:01.460
Alright, um, I'm gonna take this call because we haven't heard from this guy yet.

02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:04.460
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:05.460
Oh, hey.

02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:07.460
Hey, who's this?

02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:09.460
This is, uh, BlackDevilRx.

02:20:09.460 --> 02:20:12.460
BlackDevilRx, what's on your mind tonight?

02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:17.460
Uh, not much. I was just sitting here listening to the whole...

02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:21.460
Little program we have, right? Have you ever listened to this show before?

02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:25.460
Uh, no, actually, this is my first time.

02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:29.460
Yeah, it kinda sucks, huh?

02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:30.460
Nah, it's alright, it's alright.

02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:31.460
I think we suck.

02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:32.460
Don't answer that.

02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:36.460
What's on your mind? What do you think about, what do you think about, like, UltraMix 2 coming out and stuff?

02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:42.460
I mean, I don't know, I just kinda see how this works.

02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:45.460
Are we your guinea pigs for testing this program?

02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:48.900
sorta. Oh, well that's alright.

02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:52.140
What do you think about the new DDR games coming out this fall? Are you planning on

02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:54.540
picking one of them up? I think they're both great. I mean they have,

02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:58.220
you know, an awesome selection of, awesome selections really.

02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:03.380
What do you think about the whole fact that PS2 is not

02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:04.180
online

02:21:04.180 --> 02:21:08.020
and Xbox doesn't have iToy? Why do you think, what's your opinion on that? Why

02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:10.580
do you think the games are going in completely different directions?

02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:15.440
I don't know. I mean, they're both made by different companies as I understand

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:20.440
And PS2 has the Itoy thing, Xbox.

02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:26.440
You're referring to those rumors that Harmonix had something to do with Xtreme, right?

02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:27.440
Yeah.

02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:32.440
From what I understand, those were proven to be false to some extent.

02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:37.440
I don't know the details on that, but we have Konami of Hawaii.

02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:43.440
There's some sort of thing that's wrong. I'm getting some sort of double post, like some sort of echo.

02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:49.380
down your win app because you're hearing us twice, that's why. It's alright. Don't panic.

02:21:49.380 --> 02:21:54.280
Everything will be okay. Don't panic. Okay, you're talking about how UltraMix is made

02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:57.160
in Hawaii and Xtreme is made in Japan, right? Kind of that?

02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:59.480
Yeah. Oh, okay. Alright. So you think maybe that

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:00.960
has to do with it? Yeah.

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:03.480
That's an interesting theory. Alright, anything else you want to share?

02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:05.880
Uh, no. That's it. Alright, have a good one, buddy.

02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:08.880
Alright, bye. Alright, bye. I'm liking this Skype line thing

02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:12.960
now that people actually use it. Alright. Well, let's get into the FUs of the week,

02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:16.560
shall we actually wait well there was one more person we hadn't heard from

02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:20.960
that was trying to call in so I'm gonna see if if that person can get through if

02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:23.880
you've already called us this segment please don't call back I can't pick up

02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:27.280
because we already talked to you but there was somebody else trying to get

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:29.520
through that we hadn't talked to yet I was gonna give them a chance to get

02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:40.360
through see if they call hmm no we'll see this is certainly a new thing for us

02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:45.480
I don't know of any other internet radio station that does this for their listeners where they can talk on

02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:49.880
Skype and stuff. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one I forgot about I forgot that they do that to

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:57.120
Bad me station. Yeah our parents station under station live. All right for that for my mistake. I will give them a free plug

02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:04.360
www.understationlife.org listen, they're awesome Travis and Jenna. Yes. Are they they're still doing their show on like Saturdays, right?

02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:07.340
Yeah, it's something and they have spin-offs occasionally too. All right

02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:13.340
Speaking of which, we have to give a shout out to the baby, because the baby turned one this week.

02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:15.340
Aww, their baby turned one.

02:23:15.340 --> 02:23:16.340
Yup.

02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:17.340
Big radio baby.

02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:18.340
Kieran.

02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:19.340
Alright.

02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:23.340
Well, I guess that person didn't want to call in, so we'll give another chance later.

02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:25.340
But for now, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:28.340
Okay, now this is the way the FUs of the week is going to work tonight.

02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:33.340
If you are on the wrong end of the split, you can send an email with your FUs.

02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:34.340
Here's the address.

02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:35.340
I'm only going to give it once.

02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:37.340
Get a pen and paper ready. Ready?

02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:45.340
robrob.com

02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:49.340
If you have FUs and you can't get them in on the chatroom because of the split, send them over email.

02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:51.340
rob at orange lounge radio dot com.

02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:53.340
Ooh, I did it twice. I said I only do it once.

02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:56.340
Alright, let's get to tonight FUs.

02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:59.340
Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week?

02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:06.340
We're so full of to anger.

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:20.260
A big F U goes to my damn nose

02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:22.580
for being full of snot.

02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:25.760
I hate you allergies! I hate you!

02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:32.620
I hate pollen, I hate the trees, I hate the grass, I hate the little animals, I hate anything

02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:34.300
that's setting off my allergies right now.

02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:38.140
Okay, I don't hate Shermie though, she's forgiven, because Shermie is, of course, the official

02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:41.140
cat of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:50.780
Also, F you to the H2 for looking stupid, and F you to the Hummer for being expensive

02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:54.860
because I want one.

02:24:54.860 --> 02:25:03.660
Another big F.U. goes toward it being so busy at work because I, uh, it's hard to talk with

02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:08.700
my, uh, throat hurting like this and everything, so that's a big pain in the ass.

02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:10.580
F.U. to it getting hot again.

02:25:10.580 --> 02:25:14.420
It was cold, it was nice and cool for a few days, and then the hot came back.

02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:18.300
It was like 97 degrees today, that sucked.

02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:27.740
um, an F.U. goes toward, uh, shoot, I had another one to name. Yeah, my air conditioning

02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:36.020
for not working, and also to, uh, the repair guy, I don't know if it's the repair guy or

02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:41.220
my apartment complex man, I mean, she's nice and everything, but I, uh, the first time

02:25:41.220 --> 02:25:45.700
the repair guy came in, he, uh, just put Freon in it, and it was cool for, like, three hours,

02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:50.920
it got hot again and I called her called the apartment manager to have the guy

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:55.780
come back and do it again and I don't think he ever came so um I'm having Dan

02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:03.580
go talk to her. Dan is six foot four okay Dan is very tall and very large and when

02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:08.320
he asks somebody to do something usually they will so yeah. Not that you're

02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:13.300
threatening or anything. Not that we're threatening, no. I hate my nose again

02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:16.740
because like at least it's not dripping like it was earlier because it was like

02:26:16.740 --> 02:26:21.100
all day and I was sneezing all day but like the left side was all blocked up

02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:24.980
and now the right side is and I like want it to make up its mind just not to

02:26:24.980 --> 02:26:30.740
be blocked up and also a big SU to Benadryl where Benadryl works it like

02:26:30.740 --> 02:26:38.460
makes me all like goofy so I hate my sentences and everything so that's it

02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:43.460
Alright then, let's move on to Loki and his nephews of the week.

02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:57.460
Okay, so my fault actually. I bit on the wrong wire, the wrong magnet wire, because I could have gotten this other stuff much cheaper and it would have been much better for what I'm doing.

02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:27.440
And, um, so that sucks. And then also, I don't know, really nothing else to be mad about, um, just stupid drivers in general, um, people just driving like nuts, not looking where they're going, and every time, I'm sorry, Jamie, I'm sorry, this is these people, okay, not you, I'm not speaking for all women, but my God, every time there's someone stupid that cuts in front of me or does something retarded, like not looking or not signaling,

02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:32.880
or something. I always look and it's normally an SUV and it's always a woman driving. On

02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:36.480
the cell phone? On the cell phone. Always on the cell phone. It's like my god. It's

02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:40.680
like these factors. I swear people do not need to be on cell phones while driving. I

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:47.680
never answer my cell phone while driving. So that really sucks and um other than that

02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:55.600
really not too much else to be uh mad about other than um you know McDonald's food sucking

02:27:55.600 --> 02:28:02.600
with

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:06.680
my turn

02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:07.920
alright

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:10.080
uh...

02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:17.080
let's see

02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:21.280
uh... my view of the week basically goes to doubt don't get me wrong i

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:23.540
absolutely love my job

02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:27.240
But work on Friday, I just had it.

02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:29.220
I reached my breaking point Friday where I was like,

02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:30.980
Calcon, take me away.

02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:34.260
And I'm not looking forward to next week much either.

02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:35.420
But I'll get over it.

02:28:35.420 --> 02:28:37.260
I do love my job, and I love the people I work with.

02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:39.900
So it's just that there's too much drama sometimes.

02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:42.420
I can't deal with it.

02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:46.300
Also an FU to the BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit System.

02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:48.940
Because if I want to use my ATM card on BART, I have to buy

02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:51.220
a $20 ticket minimum.

02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:53.100
$20.

02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:57.020
when it only costs like eight to get to san francisco and back

02:28:57.020 --> 02:28:58.140
bastards

02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:00.340
that's highway robbery

02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:04.820
i'll lose the damn ticket

02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:08.940
alright let's go to some other FUs from our folks assembled here starting off

02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:10.580
with explicit

02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:12.760
uh...

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:15.620
three hour show buddy keep it short

02:29:15.620 --> 02:29:17.460
okay i'll keep this one short okay

02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:22.920
alright i would like to give an FU to the state fair for being so damn expensive

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:33.920
I mean, not only at the spot like my friends, you know, I'd be nice to my friends and all, but my wall, my bank's almost depleted just for the sake of fairness and shit.

02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:37.920
F you through shame for squashing the hell out of my stomach.

02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:46.920
I know I ate like funnel cakes before riding on a few rides, but squashing me on this one ride in my stomach kind of killed my appetite.

02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:51.420
I have not eaten any lunch nor dinner, both today and Saturday.

02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:53.920
Either I was full or something, yeah.

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:58.920
An F.U. for Scandia for not posting

02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:01.920
what the hell the rules are for this tournament Tuesday.

02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:03.420
Like how the hell are we gonna know?

02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:04.920
It's whatever they feel like doing.

02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:08.920
Who knows what's gonna happen? Would it screw up or would it not screw up?

02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:12.920
An F.U. to the drama about

02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:19.920
oooh sim makers vs actual people who play ddr to actually hire for the ultramix game

02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:22.480
oh ok? yeah like you know

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:24.060
how some people say oooh

02:30:24.060 --> 02:30:27.580
people get hired for connections and stuff

02:30:27.580 --> 02:30:30.700
you know like everyone knows that AJ and little B are working at

02:30:30.700 --> 02:30:34.420
ultramix some people are starting drama towards it

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:37.420
where's this drama at?

02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:38.480
i think it was

02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:41.260
i think it was in aaroninjapan.com

02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:42.780
interesting

02:30:42.780 --> 02:30:46.780
I'm not FU-ing Scandi, I'm just FU-ing some of the people who did not post the rules.

02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:54.780
Yeah, they are, Scandi has a broken pad. If they don't fix the pad before the tournament, then how are you going to have a fair tournament, basically?

02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:58.780
I think, in regards to the other FU, I think people need to withhold judgement until the game comes out.

02:30:58.780 --> 02:30:59.780
Yes.

02:30:59.780 --> 02:31:08.780
And I think no matter what happens, no matter who did the steps, if God himself came down from the heavens and wrote the steps to the next mix, somebody out there would say they sucked.

02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:11.780
There is no pleasing everybody, you're just going to have to deal with it.

02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:26.780
Honestly, people just cut it out, wait till the game comes, wait till UltraMix 2 comes out and then just from there, if it's shitty or not, or if it's good as hell or not.

02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:40.780
From what I've heard of UltraMix 2 so far, you guys are going to be very surprised. Some folks that are all anti-XBox and stuff, you're going to be hopping on the XBox train soon enough. UltraMix 2 is going to be very, very good. That's all I have to say.

02:31:40.780 --> 02:31:45.580
we'll see you first when the game comes out

02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:51.580
i can't say why i'm saying it but just it's going to be great anyway

02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:54.260
let's see

02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:55.940
and fe2

02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:58.340
school some of the teachers in school

02:31:58.340 --> 02:31:59.620
uh... notes

02:31:59.620 --> 02:32:02.820
uh... it's going to be too long for the fus

02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:06.140
so let us speak for itself alright

02:32:06.140 --> 02:32:11.140
Alright, um, here is my comedy for the FUs, if you want to laugh at it or not, Rob.

02:32:11.140 --> 02:32:16.140
Uh, FU2, ants trying to attack you when you're trying to get a good night's sleep.

02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:17.140
Ew.

02:32:17.140 --> 02:32:23.140
Yeah, I know, it's not good. And then when you're trying to sleep, you have nightmares of them trying to kill you.

02:32:23.140 --> 02:32:24.140
Ah.

02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:25.140
I know, doesn't that suck?

02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:27.140
Like big giant ants, or red ants, or what?

02:32:27.140 --> 02:32:31.140
No, I mean, they're regular house ants, but it's just like, it's annoying as hell.

02:32:31.140 --> 02:32:32.140
Alright.

02:32:32.140 --> 02:32:42.140
Yeah, you know, black ants, the little sweet ants or whatever you want to call them, and then, like, even though you, like, spray around the house, like, not even a week later, they'll come back.

02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:49.140
And then when you try to squish them, they start walking after you squish them. They have to, like, squish them multiple times. It's really annoying.

02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:59.140
So F you to that. And then also, uh, to add to Loki's F you, F you to stupid drivers that, uh, try to clip you when you're just, you know, minding your own business in your own lane.

02:32:59.140 --> 02:33:04.300

02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:09.180

02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:19.860
between 12 and 1 and then some fucking reason I wake up like 5 or 6 in the

02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:27.340
morning but it was really weird is like like last Monday I was like seven hours

02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:32.700
and I was like dead all day and then the next few days I wake up like after four

02:35:32.700 --> 02:35:39.180
five hours of sleep and then actually awake for half the day and of course I get like

02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:43.180
really sleepy towards the end of the day after looking at a computer screen all fucking day.

02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:46.700
That's just the way it is. And that's about it.

02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:52.980
Alright, let's head on and look at our chat room FUs. Let's go on and this one's from

02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:58.940
Flaronet. FU to cable news over coverage of the national conventions. It's not important

02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:04.060
to have coverage of every little detail of a new purposeless gathering of a now I'm sorry

02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:12.060
of a now purposeless gathering. My bad. What? What? I was commenting on them doing that

02:36:12.060 --> 02:36:18.620
every little thing and Bush blew his nose today. We have reported this on CNN, MSNBC

02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:24.020
and the Discovery Channel. It looks like our net split is fixed. However, if you submitted

02:36:54.020 --> 02:36:59.140
lot of people start school tomorrow. Sorry guys. Um, F.U. to President Bush for exploiting

02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:02.820
9-11 for another four years in office, hence picking New York City as the location for

02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:06.740
the Republican National Convention. F.U. to the hip-hop being the dominating force in

02:37:06.740 --> 02:37:11.740
this year's VMAs and in mainstream music in general. Did you get my F.U.? Yes, I did.

02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:16.220
Oh yeah, we said, fuck you to the video music award. Oh yes, I have to spoil those, don't

02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:21.860
I? My bad. Hold on. Who the fuck wants to know? It's all stupid crap. I know it is,

02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:26.520
But I I want to spoil it for those people that were thinking about going to watch it

02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:35.140
I'll get I'll get to it you guys here. Let's see

02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:38.700
That's it. That's it out. Where's the winners list here

02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:43.260
Video of the year was outcast. Hey, yeah

02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:49.180
Which also won the award for most overplayed song of the year. Oh wait. No, that was that was me and

02:37:49.180 --> 02:37:56.680
And best male video, Usher, big surprise. Best female video, Beyonce, big surprise. Best fruit video, no doubt.

02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:58.180
Great! Now you don't have to watch.

02:37:58.180 --> 02:38:00.180
Yay! You don't have to watch.

02:38:00.180 --> 02:38:01.180
A public service announcement.

02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:06.180
You don't have to watch one of the 500 million, three billion repeats that they play every fucking day.

02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:07.180
Alright.

02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:15.180
Elle Mullet would like to say F you to the Japanese DDR elitists who have no idea what they're talking about.

02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:18.180
And an F you to my college classes that start tomorrow.

02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:24.180
Dark Knight says, an F.U. for not having a car and an F.U. for not thinking of another F.U.

02:38:24.180 --> 02:38:31.180
Black Devil says, F.U. to my iTunes radio connection. When I was calling over Skype, I heard an echo of my voice and your voice.

02:38:31.180 --> 02:38:34.180
It was like six voices in my head and it was hard to concentrate.

02:38:34.180 --> 02:38:36.180
Turn down the volume next time you call in.

02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:42.180
Misty says, F.Me. because while I did find my karaoke revolution mic, I think it's broken.

02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:45.420
And in a lesser FU to me for not getting off my ass and driving, I could have kicked some

02:38:45.420 --> 02:38:48.660
ass in a DDR tournament this weekend.

02:38:48.660 --> 02:38:54.620
And VX JasonXV says, FU number one to OtherSideIRC, why are you unstable at the moment?

02:38:54.620 --> 02:39:00.180
FU number two from all of us at Orange Lounge Radio and then some, FU to Newt.

02:39:00.180 --> 02:39:04.940
And FU number three, FU to Netsplitz in general.

02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:06.460
All right.

02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:10.520
Now let's take a look at the FUs that came in over email, because I promised that I would

02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:12.100
read the ones on email.

02:39:12.100 --> 02:39:16.300
I apologize if I mispronounce this name because it has an extra E from what I'm used to but

02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:22.880
it looks like Renee says F U to Japanese hentai censorship and at myself for probably setting

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:28.460
a record kick action to myself so fast for a first time user. Well that's okay. You live

02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:32.820
you learn. As long as you're being good now that's the important point. Zeno would like

02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:39.440
to say F U damn IRC network splits. That and fractions. Numbers of the devil. And this

02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:45.720
weird cut on my hand that doesn't want to heal and lastly I don't have an alias

02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:50.000
for this guy I only got the full name here so we'll call him Robert B Robert

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.260
B says a big f you to dial up for being so shitty and another f you to me for

02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:59.000
not getting cable crown fractions the number of the devil but call me the

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:04.880
devil's friend aren't you a map weren't you a math major or something yes I see

02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:14.440
how it is. You're in cahoots with the devil. Now even I'm scared. Yikes. Alright. I think

02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:17.520
what we'll do is we're going to go to a break and when we come back from a break we'll do

02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:21.020
a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge. Oh but first I wanted to mention some more Bomani

02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:25.580
news going on because you know there was other news that happened this week besides the extreme

02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:31.320
unlocks being revealed. There was a preview movie for Dancing Stage Fever that came out

02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:35.320
and you can actually see a link to this video right on our website at orangeontradio.com

02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:39.880
it's about the fifth story down. What this video showed, it was very interesting, it

02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:45.580
showed some of the song banners and stuff, but it also had karaoke lyrics. Now granted,

02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:50.920
it's the Europe version of DDR, not the USA version of DDR, but, hmm, typically they use

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:57.300
very similar engines. So, hmm, you kind of wonder, is karaoke lyrics something that's

02:40:57.300 --> 02:41:01.640
coming? I don't know. Especially with the karaoke revolution crossovers, it'll make

02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:07.320
a lot of sense. But, despite that, if you do live in Europe and you have access to dancing

02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:13.740
stage games, then hey, there you go, you get karaoke lyrics. And you get a really good

02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:20.420
song list, by the way. You guys get an awesome song list. And DDR Festival was confirmed

02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:26.160
by Konami. It is coming, it does support the iToy, and it's coming November 18th. You wanna

02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:30.200
to know why it's confirmed because they set up a website for it and you can see

02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:34.360
this link right there on our website orange launch radio.com it's right there

02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:41.320
on our front page alrighty alright oops it was dancing stage

02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:45.120
fusion not fever I don't know why it says in the headline fever we've got to

02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:49.920
fix that it's actually fusion our bad our bad

02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:56.420
Alright. We will be right back after this break.

02:41:56.420 --> 02:42:00.820
Uh, Jamie wanted more Five Keys, so I said sure, because she wanted to hear

02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:05.020
more Rugged Ash. So, why not? We'll do some Rugged Ash.

02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:09.020
Rugged Ash is fun to play. Yeah, we'll do Logical Dash and, um,

02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:13.420
The Fall. Nah, we're gonna do The Fall. Fall Another. I don't have Fall Another.

02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:17.340
We'll do The Fall Regular. We'll be back after th- Oh, these songs are also short. We can fit in

02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:18.020
Salamander.

02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:21.020
Hey, do you have, um, uh, Believe Again?

02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:24.020
Or Beginning of Life?

02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:28.020
Uh, yes, and because I can't find Salamander right now, we'll do Beginning of Life.

02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:29.020
Sorry, Angel.

02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:31.020
Alright, so four names.

02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:34.020
Oh, I did, it was, it was not Renee, it was Rene.

02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:38.020
And it's just, but that, I didn't think that was right, because that would be too obvious,

02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:42.020
and usually people's names aren't quite as obvious, unless you're named Rob, like me.

02:42:42.020 --> 02:42:43.020
It was Rene.

02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:45.020
My bad, my bad.

02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:49.620
You try doing a radio show I'm pronouncing everything right. All right. We'll be back on break. Okay

02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:19.020
The

02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:23.020
The

02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:27.020
The

02:43:27.020 --> 02:43:31.020
The

02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:35.020
The

02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:39.020
The

02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:43.020
The

02:43:43.020 --> 02:44:11.140
Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously

02:44:11.140 --> 02:44:12.140
today.

02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:19.140
the first crash happened in bukaki but

02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:19.140
Bass, please. Bass, please. Bass, please.

02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:43.140
That's it.

02:46:43.140 --> 02:46:44.140
That's it.

02:46:44.140 --> 02:46:45.140
That's it.

02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:46.140
That's it.

02:47:46.140 --> 02:47:51.140
.

02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:56.140
.

02:47:56.140 --> 02:48:01.160
.

02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:06.160
.

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:11.160
.

02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:38.560
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:42.960
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:49.760
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:53.560
We are back, and I thought since we have a little bit of show left,

02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:55.960
maybe we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:00.460
So you can actually send a question over private message right now to Sky,

02:49:00.460 --> 02:49:02.420
and we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:06.160
But first, we'll go ahead and open up the Skype line,

02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:11.040
If anybody has any comments or whatever or maybe there's something they want to ask over the skype line. I don't know. I

02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:14.040
Don't know what you guys are thinking

02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:15.580
We'll see

02:49:15.580 --> 02:49:16.680
um

02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:18.680
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, I

02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:21.640
Guess I should cue the theme theme music, huh? I

02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:28.320
Was looking for something else real fast. I was gonna try and read something funny, but I don't think I'm gonna have time so

02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:33.160
Nothing is funny anymore. Yeah, I lament cry cry

02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:36.160
Zaku is calling us again. What's up?

02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:40.160
What's up?

02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:50.160
Let me see. I'm just wondering. I mean I'm having trouble playing 2DX because all I'm doing is 5P.

02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:54.160
And I want to break into 7. How do I make that jump?

02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:59.160
Alright, I'm going to go ahead and go because our connection is a little messed up. I'm going to answer that for you, okay?

02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:04.160
Alright, keep listening. How do you make the jump from 5 key to 7 key?

02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:07.160
But before we answer the question, I have to do the theme music.

02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:18.160
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:22.160
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:25.160
When we use the Skype Line, random people call in.

02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:32.160
call in, but I sure hope that one guy doesn't call us anymore, and I hope he got a life.

02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:37.700
But I'm not gonna wish for things that won't happen. Alright. Anyway, let's go back to

02:50:37.700 --> 02:50:44.700
people we do like to hear from. Zaku, how do you make the jump from 5 key to 7 key?

02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:52.060
You just do it. Yeah, honestly, you just have to do it. My advice, honestly, when you play

02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:57.280
play 2DX, don't play 5 key, ever, because you'll just be kind of ruining it. But here's

02:50:57.280 --> 02:51:02.900
the thing, start on light 7, use beginner mode if you can, just whatever it does to

02:51:02.900 --> 02:51:06.740
ease you into the 7 keys. Just because you can do a 4 star on 5 key, it doesn't mean

02:51:06.740 --> 02:51:11.080
you can do a 4 star on 7 key. Adding those two extra buttons will do so much. So just

02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:15.460
go back to the ones, and that's really the only way you can do it. Put your turntable

02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:19.820
on the same side that you had it in 5 key games if you're playing from there, if that

02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:25.580
helps you I don't know otherwise you just have to practice there's no magic

02:51:25.580 --> 02:51:30.380
way to do it learn how to pinky scratch drill mode if you have six or seven

02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:34.100
style or I'm sorry fifth or sixth style and I think it was the seventh to use

02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:37.780
drill mode it really really helps and teach you a lot teaches you a lot of

02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:42.860
tricks it can be a little repetitive at first but it really really helps so do

02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:48.060
yourself a favor and try that okay you might want to also when I first started

02:51:48.060 --> 02:51:54.600
doing it I had to learn to recenter my hands. A lot of people will do five to

02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:58.440
five keys and then use two to the other. I actually just center my hands

02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:05.080
completely over the middle four and play like that. I use my thumbs a lot. I mean

02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:08.520
so it's how you position your fingers too with a lot of it. Just keep

02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:12.660
experimenting until you find something that's comfortable. All right. It'll just

02:52:12.660 --> 02:52:17.640
click one moment. It will. All right, moving on. Let's, I want to take some

02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:22.120
questions that came in from the chat room, including

02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:26.400
puppy has a question for us. Puppy wants to know when are we gonna go out and

02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:28.040
have boba with him again?

02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:31.640
Um, whenever I can cheat.

02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:34.720
When you buy me my humbee.

02:52:34.720 --> 02:52:40.400
I do think a boba trip is in order, I just don't know when yet.

02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:45.520
Sorry guys. I don't know when yet. I've been kind of busy lately.

02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:49.320
We do have a three-day weekend coming up, but I promise, promise, promise

02:52:49.320 --> 02:52:52.880
a special somebody that I would go to the club with him Sunday night after the show

02:52:52.880 --> 02:52:56.040
next week, so. Okay. But maybe next time.

02:52:56.040 --> 02:52:59.880
We'll see. Certainly by the next time VX JasonXV visits,

02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:04.900
that's for sure. Uh, Zaku wants to submit another question. Skyline's open, too, if you

02:53:04.900 --> 02:53:05.560
want to call in.

02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:09.160
Um, what was the worst summer job you ever had?

02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:13.440
I worked at a grocery store for a week.

02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:16.920
for a week what happened? It was supposed to be my first job

02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:20.320
I was gonna work at the grocery store. I had been offered a job at the game room

02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:21.320
during orientation

02:53:21.320 --> 02:53:24.880
at my college but I wasn't actually a student yet so

02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:27.880
to earn some money over the summer I was gonna work at a grocery store

02:53:27.880 --> 02:53:31.640
and it turned out that they were

02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:35.600
if I was supposed to get off at like nine I didn't get off work

02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:39.400
until midnight. I was like excuse me screw this

02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:43.000
so I quit took my last paycheck and then like

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Two weeks later I was working on campus.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Well, uh, here's just a simple question. Didn't you get my instant message over the forums lately?

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Oh, yes, about Popin' Music 12. Yes, I did.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Yeah, I was just wondering.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:28.000
You want us to whore out Popin' Music 12. We can do that.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:29.000
Yep.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Alright, we'll talk Popin' Music 12 just for you, Siggy.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Just after this.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Okay.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.000
After this segment.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Well, we don't have much time left in the show, so we'll probably get to that and finish out the show here.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Just finish this right now.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:50.040
right now. Alrighty. Thanks for the reminder. Alright. Alright, later. Later. Yes, I did

02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:56.160
want to get to that. Darkline had sent us a message over the forums. Let me go grab

02:54:56.160 --> 02:55:01.280
that right now. We actually have to wrap up the show so I just want to do a few more news

02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:06.800
items and then we'll finish up here. Let me see. Let me get in there. We did briefly mention

02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:11.600
it in one of our other news articles but Pava Music 12 is location testing right now. That's

02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:15.640
really high for a Bomani Game 12 mix or whatever, but they don't call it mix. It's just popping

02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:21.000
12. It has a bunch of new licenses in it. Well, not a bunch, but at least three that

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:24.640
have been announced so far. Cruel Angels Thesis is one of them.

02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:28.840
Dude, that's like as the Evangelion theme. Exactly, so there's tons of people who are

02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:32.920
going to love that. And then some new Konami originals as well. I see the Parkettes are

02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:39.100
in there. Jimmy Weckl has one, and D. Crew has a song. You can head over to Bomani Style.

02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:42.860
actually posted about this a couple days ago I'd feel a little weird just copying

02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:46.700
and pasting what they wrote so honestly just head over my style they've got all

02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:50.380
the news on it they also have screenshots and it looks like they're

02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:53.420
kind of you know how the recent Papa musics they've kind of had a theme like

02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:57.820
Papa music 11 was like world travel was kind of what that was all about it looks

02:55:57.820 --> 02:56:03.340
like Papa music 12 theme is traditional Japan because you notice that the the

02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:09.080
mascots are wearing the kind of like kimono and every all the artwork looks

02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:14.540
looks, for lack of a better word, looks a little chinky. That's basically what it's

02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:19.700
about, so. Pop Meets the Twelve, we will definitely, when we find out more information about it,

02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:27.580
we will post it on over to our website over on OrangelaungeRadio.com. Alright, what else

02:56:27.580 --> 02:56:33.940
was news? Oh, I know, not necessarily a Bamani game, but you know Taiko no Tatujin, right?

02:56:33.940 --> 02:56:34.940
You know that game.

02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:35.940
Yep.

02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:39.120
Well you know it's coming to the U.S. and it's going to be called Taiko Drum Master

02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:41.320
here in the U.S. Close enough name.

02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:47.900
Well guess what? The song list has been announced for Taiko Drum Master and there's some very

02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:53.200
interesting stuff in it. Like to be expected, you have your classical songs. You have your

02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:59.640
Beethoven Symphony No. 5, Carmen, William Tell Overture, Hungarian Dances No. 5. You

02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:05.680
have all that stuff. Then you have Namco originals such as Soul Calibur II's Brave Sword, Braver

02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:14.180
Soul and the Ridge Racer theme, but then we get the licenses, some very interesting licensed

02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:24.180
songs in Taiko Drum Master, My Sharona, Material Girl, Lady Marmalade, the theme from Jimmy

02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:36.860
Neutron and the theme from Dragon Ball Z and then get this toxic and DDR crossovers tub

02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:45.900
thumping you remember that second mix tub thumping and that's the way I like it I wonder

02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:52.700
if they're gonna make the drum any more stable for if you want to see that list it's over

02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:56.420
on our website orangelontrado.com. We did post the whole list. It's the fourth story

02:57:56.420 --> 02:58:02.460
down right now. Very interesting. Donkey Konga's almost out. I think there's only a couple

02:58:02.460 --> 02:58:05.500
more weeks till that's out. And if you go to a GameStop, they have the demo set up so

02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:10.820
you can try it out. It's interesting. You know, I can't personally be too excited about

02:58:10.820 --> 02:58:18.200
Donkey Konga after I played it. Because the clapping thing is aggravating, you know? But

02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:22.840
I wonder, I wonder though, do they, have they put out a song list for Donkey Konga yet?

02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:28.340
Uh, yes, it's way back in our archives, you'd have to do a search, but there was a song

02:58:28.340 --> 02:58:29.340
list announced.

02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:33.320
I know that the Japanese version had a bunch of J-pop in it, it was actually pretty, you

02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:36.960
know, it had pretty good songs selection.

02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:41.000
I just sort of blanked out over Donkey Konga, but that's, you know, it's really cool that

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:45.600
it's coming out over here, but it's one of the ones I never thought that we'd see.

02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:49.600
Alright, I'm going to jam through the last few questions here, then we've got to wrap up the show.

02:58:49.600 --> 02:58:54.600
Three more questions, no more questions please. I'm going to get these last few ones.

02:58:54.600 --> 02:58:57.600
Dark Knight, a quick question, has anyone visited Virginia before?

02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:01.600
The reason why was because Loki had that Virginia shirt on the webcam.

02:59:01.600 --> 02:59:08.600
As I said before in the chat room, but no one was paying attention, my aunt and uncle live in Virginia.

02:59:08.600 --> 02:59:14.600
And so, you know, as a staple, everyone has to bring you back the shirt that says what city they visited.

02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:20.200
so, you know, I have this shirt. Basically, you know, if you want to know the logic with

02:59:20.200 --> 02:59:25.760
me wearing this shirt, it was on top of the clean pile. It was the first shirt I saw.

02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:34.120
And that's how it goes. Speaking of traveling, I'm going to be back on the East Coast in

02:59:34.120 --> 02:59:38.460
a couple weeks. I'm going to try and go to 8 on the break, because I want to check out

02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:42.680
in the groove, and I hear they have it there. And so I'm going to go to 8 on the break,

02:59:42.680 --> 02:59:47.320
So, for those of you guys that live out there, I don't know if I should clue the stalkers

02:59:47.320 --> 02:59:50.480
into what day I'm going to be there, but I'll let you know a little closer to the day, because

02:59:50.480 --> 02:59:51.480
that's why I'm planning.

02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:52.720
I don't know for sure if I'm going to get to go either.

02:59:52.720 --> 02:59:56.320
I don't want to make promises I can't keep, but I'm going to be about an hour drive from

02:59:56.320 --> 02:59:57.320
there.

02:59:57.320 --> 02:59:59.760
So I'm going to try and go to it on the break, because I want to go check it out.

02:59:59.760 --> 03:00:02.380
So we will see.

03:00:02.380 --> 03:00:03.380
Question from Black Devil.

03:00:03.380 --> 03:00:07.480
When I call and I want to not hear an echo of the conversation, do I turn down my master

03:00:07.480 --> 03:00:10.000
volume or microphone volume?

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:11.760
Don't turn down your mic volume.

03:00:11.760 --> 03:00:16.400
down your speakers, or, well, I shouldn't say your speakers, turn down your Winamp or

03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:20.400
if you're iTunes, turn it off while you call the show. Whatever you're using to listen

03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:24.380
to the station, turn it off while you call the show, because that's what causes the echo.

03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:27.700
But don't, yeah, don't turn off your speakers because then you can't hear us through Skype

03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:34.160
and then you're talking to nothing. So, yeah. Shut off Winamp or iTunes or whatever you

03:00:34.160 --> 03:00:39.800
use to listen to the show. And lastly, Legend of Zaku, one more question. What are the chances

03:00:39.800 --> 03:00:46.800
that we Americans will get other Bomani besides DDR and karaoke revolution.

03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:54.040
We did get keyboard mania. To some extent, not necessarily on Playstation.

03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:57.880
But we got the Yamaha. Yeah, a little hard to get. A lot of people

03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:02.420
don't even know about it, it's so rare. But we did get it.

03:01:02.420 --> 03:01:07.520
I don't know. I don't want to say never. Never say never. Let's just put it that way, never

03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:10.960
say never. You know what I want to see come out in the States is some of the Namco music

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:15.760
games. Well you get... Namco did, I'm not talking about Taiko no Tatsujin, I'm talking

03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:19.880
about like the guitar game that Namco did and the drum one that Namco did. Alright.

03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:23.880
Cause they did a bunch of, they're supposed to be really good music games, just we haven't

03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:30.740
seen them. Alright. It's all on the namco.jp site. Alright, we are going to wrap up the

03:01:30.740 --> 03:01:36.200
show now guys. It is time, we're almost running over here, so please let us get everybody's

03:01:36.200 --> 03:01:40.000
Final thought, and we'll start off tonight's final thought with Angel.

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:41.720
Um...

03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:46.000
Well, no, I wanted to save it for Last Word if you want to let me have it, but, uh...

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.080
Uh...

03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:50.340
Buffalo wings.

03:01:50.340 --> 03:01:52.600
Alright, uh, Arcadian.

03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:53.920
Final thought.

03:01:53.920 --> 03:01:55.560
If we can get him a mic.

03:01:55.560 --> 03:02:00.800
Final thought from Arcadian42. Yay, more money soon!

03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:07.800
Alright, uh, Jonas, your final thought?

03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:11.000
Tournament Tuesday.

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:12.060
Oh god.

03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:14.240
Uh, Loki!

03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:17.600
Loki, your final thought?

03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:19.960
I am working on

03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:22.160
next week's winning song.

03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:23.720
Ha ha ha!

03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:26.960
Bond will be the Drudeezy.

03:02:26.960 --> 03:02:28.980
You're just mad because Bond won't put out for you.

03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:35.300
Alright, uh, my final thought is listen to Outside the Box on Wednesday. Listen, or I'll

03:02:35.300 --> 03:02:41.100
come to your house and beat you up. And, shut up. Jamie, your final thought.

03:02:41.100 --> 03:02:48.100
I hate my allergies. Okay. And, uh, for the final word of the show,

03:02:48.100 --> 03:02:49.580
we actually- We should all announce it.

03:02:49.580 --> 03:02:54.180
We actually have a celebrity final word of the show tonight, you guys. So, here is tonight's

03:02:54.180 --> 03:02:57.860
final word of the show, and, uh, thank you very much for listening, everybody. Have a

03:02:57.860 --> 03:03:04.860

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:54.540
After listening to a couple albums, well, they all start to sound the same

03:03:56.340 --> 03:03:59.040
So he tried to change his musical style

03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:02.540
He tossed all his ballads in the circular vial

03:04:02.540 --> 03:04:06.540
Then he found the punk sound breaking ground all around his spell

03:04:06.540 --> 03:04:08.340
Billie told of me

03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:14.140
What's the matter with the tune he's writing?

03:04:14.140 --> 03:04:16.840
Well, you know it's gonna be a smash

03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:23.840
It's so nice when you're a big name, or it just doesn't matter if it sounds like trash.

03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:27.840
Now everybody thinks the new wave is super.

03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:30.840
Just ask if there's one that'll even have a scooper.

03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:32.840
It's a big hit, isn't it?

03:04:32.840 --> 03:04:37.840
Even if it's a piece of junk, it's still Billy Joel to me.

03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:39.840
Whoa!

03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:42.840
It doesn't matter what the greetings say about him.

03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:45.840
He doesn't worry how they feel.

03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:52.840
When your records tell a million cents to go in triple plasm, you don't worry about your next meal

03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:55.840
The money is no big deal

03:04:58.840 --> 03:05:04.840
Maybe he should dye his hair bright pink and thick and safety pin through his cheeks

03:05:04.840 --> 03:05:11.840
Well then he really missed the new wave image but he couldn't sit down for weeks

03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:14.840
Don't you know about the record bills of money?

03:05:14.840 --> 03:05:18.840
You gotta be trendy if you wanna make some money

03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:21.840
Everybody's saying that he sure sounds funny

03:05:21.840 --> 03:05:24.840
But if Bill Billy told on me

03:05:24.840 --> 03:05:26.840
All right!

03:05:43.840 --> 03:05:50.840
Oh, I can hardly wait till his next album

03:05:50.840 --> 03:05:53.840
I bet it's gonna be the rage

03:05:53.840 --> 03:05:59.840
Buy a ticket to his next big console, well, I wonder what he'll do on stage

03:06:00.840 --> 03:06:03.840
It might be disco and it might be the blues

03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:06.840
Or maybe something like the B-50 shoes

03:06:06.840 --> 03:06:09.840
Just a hand clap, finger snap, demonism

03:06:09.840 --> 03:06:12.840
Mindless half a cell barely jolt on me

03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:16.840
Everybody's saying that he sure sounds funny

03:06:16.840 --> 03:06:23.840
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:06:46.840 --> 03:07:07.120
Hello, there we are.

03:07:07.120 --> 03:07:14.080
We are back with the Orange Lawns Radio Afterbirth, the part after the credits have faded to black.

03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:20.520
Right now I'm trying to upload that bukkake clip to our website so I can let you people

03:07:20.520 --> 03:07:21.520
download it.

03:07:21.520 --> 03:07:22.520
Nice pun, Rob.

03:07:22.520 --> 03:07:23.520
I'm sure you'll have tons of fun.

03:07:23.520 --> 03:07:24.520
What?

03:07:24.520 --> 03:07:25.520
I said nice pun.

03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:28.520
The ACDC back and forth.

03:07:28.520 --> 03:07:29.520
Oh, whatever.

03:07:29.520 --> 03:07:30.520
Yeah.

03:07:30.520 --> 03:07:31.520
Okay, I'm not funny.

03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:32.520
Fine.

03:07:32.520 --> 03:07:33.520
That's alright.

03:07:33.520 --> 03:07:35.360
You don't get paid to be funny.

03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:36.520
You paid to sit there and look pretty.

03:07:36.520 --> 03:07:38.080
I live with someone who's not that funny.

03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:39.080
No, just kidding.

03:07:39.080 --> 03:07:40.080
I'm not going to go there.

03:07:40.080 --> 03:07:41.080
I think he's starting to rub off on you.

03:07:41.080 --> 03:07:42.080
Be careful.

03:07:42.080 --> 03:07:43.080
I hope not.

03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:46.520
Ah, ah, God.

03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:50.600
You all at home are very glad you did not hear what Jamie just said, that's for damn sure.

03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:55.640
I can repeat it! No! Can you repeat it? Because none of it is true, dammit!

03:07:55.640 --> 03:07:59.760
I don't want to hear about the person she lives with rubbing off on anyone.

03:07:59.760 --> 03:08:03.480
Wah, wah, wah.

03:08:03.480 --> 03:08:09.480
That sucks. I wish I still had that drumroll noise.

03:08:09.480 --> 03:08:12.680
Yeah, we do. People should pay us to do this show, you know?

03:08:12.680 --> 03:08:15.680
Yeah, and I'd get less than minimum wage.

03:08:15.680 --> 03:08:17.680
I want to tease the...

03:08:17.680 --> 03:08:19.680
Oh, you want to tease your new remix, Loki?

03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:20.680
Yeah.

03:08:20.680 --> 03:08:21.680
All right, tease it.

03:08:21.680 --> 03:08:22.680
Wait.

03:08:22.680 --> 03:08:23.680
Hi, puppy!

03:08:23.680 --> 03:08:25.680
Loki wants to tease his newest remix for you all.

03:08:25.680 --> 03:08:27.680
Fine. Do it.

03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:40.040
That was more than a tease, that was, you grabbed my balls and fondled them right there.

03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:42.000
That was very interesting.

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.920
Wow, what is, wow, that is pretty cool.

03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:46.320
What is that, what's that all about?

03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:48.160
Tell us about that one.

03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:49.560
It's just something with radical faith.

03:09:49.560 --> 03:09:54.160
I heard this one remix that someone did and it sucked and I thought, eh, I'll try something

03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:55.160
like that.

03:09:55.160 --> 03:09:58.160
I was instantly drawn to the TAC.

03:09:58.160 --> 03:10:02.160
I don't know. Not listening to it through your speakers, I have to change a few things.

03:10:02.160 --> 03:10:05.160
But that's just the beginning of it. The end kind of gets weird.

03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:14.160
Let me play a clip here, because I can't really transition into this part yet, but it's kind of cool. Let's see.

03:10:35.160 --> 03:10:45.160
Anyway, it's that stuff. Yeah. Nice. Very nice.

03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:57.160
For those of you guys that wanted that bukkake clip, I'm trying to get it on our site, but

03:10:57.160 --> 03:11:00.280
I'm having problems right now. So sometime this week, just keep checking our forums,

03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:04.800
you guys, which we could use some activity on there anyway. I will post that to a forums.

03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:07.680
or maybe if you ask unknown gamer really nicely he'll give it to you but here it

03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:08.120
is again

03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:11.320
two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people

03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:15.360
crashed almost simultaneously today the first crash happened

03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:18.360
in Bukhalki

03:11:18.360 --> 03:11:21.400
I played it 10 times tonight and it's still not old I'm sorry

03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:24.720
it is still funny. Nope, still funny. Alright

03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:28.520
I don't know for some reason I can't get that uploaded right now but

03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:33.760
I'll just try it again later

03:11:33.760 --> 03:11:40.760
Alright, uh, so I guess that's gonna do it for the afterbirth, um, for the post-show tonight, you guys.

03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:52.760
Uh, John Fields sent this to me and I actually think it's kinda cool, um, actually it's a video file, uh, of this animation mix, but obviously this is radio, duh, so why would I play a video file on the radio?

03:11:52.760 --> 03:12:08.760
The CD they use is called Deep Dance 50, which is pretty cool because it's all these songs, all these dance songs, but it's only like 45 seconds of each song. It's like all the good parts of every dance song, and then it goes into another song. And it's all mixed together. It's pretty cool. Yes?

03:12:08.760 --> 03:12:14.760
If you want to upload it, there's the URL in the chatroom, I think.

03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:17.760
Aww, FlareOnA was very kind to upload that to you all.

03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:24.760
Yeah, I know it's on GeoShitties, but hopefully enough you guys can get it before GeoShitties locks them out.

03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:26.760
So, good luck you guys.

03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:29.760
Alright, enjoy the post-show tonight. Have a great one.

03:12:29.760 --> 03:12:32.760
Thank you again for tuning into and supporting Orange Launch Radio.

03:12:32.760 --> 03:12:39.760
We love you, good night.

03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:46.960
I forgot the thing has this whole little intro so you just kind of have to sit through it

03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:53.960
Nice!

03:13:16.960 --> 03:13:18.960
...

03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:23.960
Ahh... A viewer?

03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:24.960
Yes!

03:13:25.960 --> 03:13:28.960
The decision is made!

03:13:31.960 --> 03:13:34.960
You are about to embark on a musical journey.

03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:37.960
A journey made up of beats and basslines.

03:13:37.960 --> 03:13:40.960
Prepare yourselves, for you are about to enter...

03:13:40.960 --> 03:13:41.960
...the deep gap!

03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:43.960
You want this, you need this!

03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:45.960
Then what if you are like this?

03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:47.980
You'll follow her here, follow her there

03:13:47.980 --> 03:13:49.980
You'll get in everywhere

03:13:49.980 --> 03:13:51.980
You want this, you need this

03:13:51.980 --> 03:13:53.940
You want it, you have to like this

03:13:53.940 --> 03:13:55.940
You'll follow her here, follow her there

03:13:55.940 --> 03:13:57.940
You'll get in everywhere

03:13:57.940 --> 03:14:01.240
Well remember, capture is such a source of passion

03:14:01.240 --> 03:14:03.660
Keep us fitted everywhere

03:14:03.660 --> 03:14:05.160
Everywhere

03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:06.860
So let your hands and voices

03:14:06.860 --> 03:14:08.980
Free your mind and order

03:14:08.980 --> 03:14:11.980
You can fill it in the end

03:14:11.980 --> 03:14:13.760
Oh

03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:21.760
It's a passion, oh, you can feel it, yeah, oh

03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:27.760
It's a passion, oh, oh

03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:31.760
Wonderful is every moment, hand it around

03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:35.760
We got to get down, rock it out from this shaky ground

03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:38.760
I'm on it, spread out your heart and party wood everywhere

03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:42.460
They see you people laugh, the people push it out
