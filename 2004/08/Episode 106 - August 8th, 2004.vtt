00:30.000 --> 00:52.800
And now, for our feature presentation...

00:52.800 --> 01:02.800
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

01:02.800 --> 01:09.800
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani, and then some.

01:09.800 --> 01:17.800
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

01:17.800 --> 01:24.800
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

01:24.800 --> 01:26.800
demons from hell!

01:27.800 --> 01:31.800
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

01:35.800 --> 01:40.800
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good feels dumb.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.800
Fact, drunken, stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.800
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.800
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.800
Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritionist practice.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.800
That was huge. Cool.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.800
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

02:02.800 --> 02:06.800
Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.800
Have you seen Malcolm? Lena?

02:08.800 --> 02:12.800
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

02:12.800 --> 02:18.440

02:18.440 --> 02:22.000

like orange lounge radio we are live and this is episode number 106 for this

02:42.720 --> 02:49.440
to August the 8th of 2004. We are the internet talk radio program dedicated to all things

02:49.440 --> 02:55.120
Vamani and then some. And with me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the

02:55.120 --> 03:00.120
Happiest Bunny on the Farm. Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers. You know her better, Star Sacra?

03:00.120 --> 03:07.200
Yay. Hooray for me. Hooray for you. Hooray for me. I'm, I'm, and hooray for me. You put

03:07.200 --> 03:10.640
my meat on the cab. You poured out my meat. Yes, I did. I put your meat on our brand new

03:10.640 --> 03:17.640
new web cam available at www www.orangeloungeradio.com is our web cam address. Also with us tonight

03:24.440 --> 03:31.440
say hello to our tech master Loki. She's like Dr. Claw but instead of the arm it's a foot.

03:31.440 --> 03:38.440
But it's not the quads, it's just a hand. It just can't be Dr. Hand, because that's just stupid.

03:38.440 --> 03:48.440
Also with us tonight, we have very few special guests here, but they're plentiful in the talent they have to bring.

03:48.440 --> 03:53.440
We have somebody who has never been on the show before, and to be honest, I don't even know him that well.

03:53.440 --> 04:00.440
But I think he's hilarious in what I've seen of him at our local arcade. Say hello to Andrew.

04:00.440 --> 04:05.880
yes yeah what's going on i don't know if you play by your online real life

04:05.880 --> 04:10.300
andrew ryan andrew is also well-known for what at that was locally here rosal

04:10.300 --> 04:17.300
i'd just love to have a higher

04:17.720 --> 04:19.160
are he's a pirate

04:19.160 --> 04:22.900
how ironic i act like a pirate online

04:22.900 --> 04:24.260
he dressed up as one

04:24.260 --> 04:26.920
you act like one of these at work

04:26.920 --> 04:30.280
All right, also with us tonight, we have somebody who frequents the show quite a bit.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.440
You recognize her from our chat room, I'm sure, if you hang out there.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.360
Say hello to PDR Angel.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.720
Hello!

04:35.720 --> 04:36.520
How you doing today?

04:36.520 --> 04:37.080
Pretty good.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.720
No, I noticed we're wearing, like, matching shirts tonight.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.480
No, what the hell was that? I wasn't even playing that.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.560
They're not technically twin shirts.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.280
They're clothes.

04:44.280 --> 04:44.920
They're clothes.

04:44.920 --> 04:48.200
We've got, she's got the one with the little piranha plant from Super Mario Bros. that says,

04:48.200 --> 04:48.680
bite me.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.240
Charar.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.240
And then I have the goomba that says, you lose.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.120
So it's like we're twins.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.760
We'll go post on the webcam again real fast during the break.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.400
All right.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.360
also with us tonight we have another very special guest

04:59.360 --> 05:03.640
he's somebody that has actually been on the show before

05:03.640 --> 05:07.640
and he's our buddy from my Kansas who now lives here in California

05:07.640 --> 05:11.000
it's our buddy Shane also known as Miklatos

05:11.000 --> 05:14.200
and if I'm not mistaken

05:14.200 --> 05:17.320
you have a new name now that you go by as well yes?

05:17.320 --> 05:20.720
yeah if you've been on the DDR Free Chords

05:20.720 --> 05:23.640
I would be the new Vivid member Seagurd

05:23.640 --> 05:28.520
so I'm the one causing you guys pain I definitely have a lot of questions for

05:28.520 --> 05:35.320
Seagurd when we get back from the break oh yeah tonight I guess maybe you guys

05:35.320 --> 05:38.720
heard about this we do have a little something there's a little song out

05:38.720 --> 05:45.600
there I think some of you guys are wanting to hear tonight that's all for

05:45.600 --> 05:50.960
right now but it is your rain from brand new DDR extreme and we'll be playing

05:50.960 --> 05:54.880
that a little bit later in the show, but hell, while we have a captive audience, let's do

05:54.880 --> 05:57.600
our normal antics, why don't we, huh?

05:57.600 --> 05:58.600
Why not?

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
Why not?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.600
Because we love our listeners.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.960
It's a three-hour show.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
Let's wait till 2.59.

06:03.960 --> 06:04.960
What do you think?

06:04.960 --> 06:05.960
That works for me.

06:05.960 --> 06:06.960
The song's only like a minute long.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
All right.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.760
No, we'll get to it somewhere after.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.760
Eventually.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.520
We definitely have to do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day first, though, because that's

06:12.520 --> 06:13.520
when we start every show.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
Of course.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.560
But first, we're going to take a break, and in this break, we're going to hear the original

06:17.560 --> 06:20.520
Akira Yomoka, Your Rain, from Silent Hill 4.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.820
That song is just so hot.

06:21.820 --> 06:24.320
Because the song rocked before they remixed it.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.820
So I'm going to play it now.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.320
Quite literally, because it is rock.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.120
It is rock.

06:28.120 --> 06:28.820
It is rock.

06:28.820 --> 06:29.820
So enjoy.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.120
How perceptive.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.420
Yes, enjoy this, and then we will be back to play a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

06:34.420 --> 06:37.020
Also tonight, boys and girls, Match Game.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.120
And to play Match Game tonight, you're going to want to be on Skype.

06:39.120 --> 06:45.320
Skype.org to download the client, and then you can talk to us live in the studio, and that's also available.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.520
So here it is.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.720
We'll be playing a remix of it tonight.

06:48.720 --> 06:52.720
But here's the original from Silent Hill 4, Kiryamoka, your reign. Enjoy.

07:18.720 --> 07:24.720
Alone again, again

07:24.720 --> 07:29.720
The rain falling on your scent

07:29.720 --> 07:32.720
I will, I will

07:32.720 --> 07:37.720
Remind you to dance with me

07:37.720 --> 07:40.720
Nobody's showing me

07:40.720 --> 07:44.720
How to return my love

07:44.720 --> 07:50.720
You give to me, I'm gonna hold me

07:50.720 --> 07:56.720
That love's a strange old name

07:58.720 --> 08:07.720
I'll never learn that you'll ever bring me down

08:07.720 --> 08:17.720
All that I need are some simple love and love

08:17.720 --> 08:25.720
You've touched me by once, it hurts

08:25.720 --> 08:31.720
Stay with me softly, never forget

08:31.720 --> 08:35.720
Never again will be

08:35.720 --> 08:38.720
I cry

08:38.720 --> 08:42.720
Out of my head

08:42.720 --> 08:48.720
And I don't know what I've found

08:48.720 --> 08:53.720
Over and over

08:53.720 --> 08:59.720
The fear that breaks me down

09:09.720 --> 09:11.720
I'm the devil, I'm the city

09:11.720 --> 09:13.720
I'm a beast of the wind

09:13.720 --> 09:16.720
I see the people goin' nowhere

09:16.720 --> 09:19.720
See me strokein' our heads

09:19.720 --> 09:21.720
Tell me passion doesn't matter

09:21.720 --> 09:24.720
My resistance is waning

09:24.720 --> 09:27.720
The flower in the basement

09:27.720 --> 09:33.720
Wait for our love today

09:57.720 --> 10:04.720
I want you out of my head

10:04.720 --> 10:10.720
And I don't know what I've found

10:10.720 --> 10:15.720
Over and over

10:15.720 --> 10:21.720
I feel it break me down

10:31.720 --> 10:32.720
I'm a sidewalk

10:32.720 --> 10:33.720
I'm a city

10:33.720 --> 10:34.720
I'm a tree

10:34.720 --> 10:36.720
Just a river

10:36.720 --> 10:37.720
There's a people

10:37.720 --> 10:38.720
Going nowhere

10:38.720 --> 10:41.720
See me talking low range

10:41.720 --> 10:42.720
I'm a Russian

10:42.720 --> 10:43.720
I'm a man

10:43.720 --> 10:46.720
My resistance is waning

10:46.720 --> 10:48.720
Like a flower in the basement

10:48.720 --> 10:55.720
Wait for our lonely death

11:18.720 --> 11:36.920
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

11:36.920 --> 11:46.400
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.120
We are back and you are listening to Orange Lawns Radio episode number 106 and if you

11:50.120 --> 11:54.660
are listening to the stream right now consider yourself lucky because of that little song

11:54.660 --> 11:57.640
that we have we're going to play a little later for you guys.

11:57.640 --> 12:01.080
This tonight's show got hoarded out on a lot of different sites and because of that we

12:01.080 --> 12:04.560
have hit what is called the cap, the live 365 listening cap.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.520
We're only allowed so many listeners and we never in our imaginations thought we would

12:08.520 --> 12:12.680
ever hit that limit but we hit it tonight like before the show even started.

12:12.680 --> 12:17.320
So if you're in, you got lucky, don't disconnect or somebody's going to snag your spot and

12:17.320 --> 12:19.980
then you're going to have to be what's called a preferred member to get back in.

12:19.980 --> 12:21.240
That's out of our control, guys.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.240
Sorry.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.240
You've done wonders for our egos.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.240
Yes.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.240
I feel great right now, actually.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.360
I'm like, ha, ha, ha.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.400
We've got a bunch of listeners on stream.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.600
We're just a popular show.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.540
And then I remember, oh yeah, we got that song.

12:31.540 --> 12:32.540
We're kind of lucky.

12:32.540 --> 12:35.120
So it's all right.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.360
Well, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lawns Radio, which it might be for

12:38.360 --> 12:40.360
some of you, welcome and welcome to the show.

12:40.360 --> 12:46.160
We are a 3 hour talk program dedicated to Bamani and video gaming because you know what?

12:46.160 --> 12:49.880
We sat around here for 3 hours and talked about nothing but DDR and 2DX.

12:49.880 --> 12:50.880
We tried.

12:50.880 --> 12:51.880
We have tried.

12:51.880 --> 12:52.880
We have literally tried.

12:52.880 --> 12:57.240
But if we sat here and we talked about DDR and 2DX for 3 hours straight, we would be

12:57.240 --> 12:59.160
like the biggest dorks ever.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.080
I mean we're pretty dorky to begin with to even have this show in the first place.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.680
But to talk about nothing but DDR for like 3 hours?

13:05.680 --> 13:07.740
Come on, you couldn't pay me enough.

13:07.740 --> 13:08.740
There's other things out there.

13:08.740 --> 13:10.740
You gotta go outside once in a while.

13:10.740 --> 13:12.740
Get a job, get a girlfriend or girlfriend.

13:12.740 --> 13:15.740
Remember, sunlight helps your body make vitamin D.

13:15.740 --> 13:16.740
Exactly.

13:16.740 --> 13:17.740
Which you need to play DDR.

13:17.740 --> 13:18.740
Exactly.

13:18.740 --> 13:19.740
Because without it you'll die.

13:19.740 --> 13:23.740
But no, we do, when all is said and done, we make a lot of fun at DDR on this show.

13:23.740 --> 13:24.740
We really do.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.740
But we're poking fun at ourselves when we poke fun at DDR.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.740
Because really we do have a lot of love for DDR.

13:28.740 --> 13:32.740
I would never have met Jamie, I would never have met Loki if it wasn't for DDR, 2DX, and that stuff.

13:32.740 --> 13:34.740
I would never have met anybody here if it wasn't for that.

13:34.740 --> 13:35.740
And for that we're thankful.

13:35.740 --> 13:38.840
thankful and so we kind of always say you know what it's kind of like what

13:38.840 --> 13:43.360
happens when DDR gets taken outside the arcade that's what happens with this

13:43.360 --> 13:47.020
show this is DDR outside of the arcade so this is just everybody sitting around

13:47.020 --> 13:51.340
having a good time so you think I sum that up pretty good Jamie I think so yeah

13:51.340 --> 13:56.280
all right why do you why do you do this show Jamie I ain't got nothing else to

13:56.280 --> 14:02.920
do yeah good answer seriously it's because um cuz well it's just fun you

14:02.920 --> 14:09.020
know we all get together it's like it's like family time you know because how

14:09.020 --> 14:13.180
many people just get around and have quality time yeah and then I get my

14:13.180 --> 14:17.700
little segment where I get to fuss and complain exactly we'll get to that later

14:17.700 --> 14:22.500
and I enjoy everybody's company and you know what the fun doesn't stop just here

14:22.500 --> 14:26.500
because we actually do live shows throughout the week including Jamie you

14:26.500 --> 14:30.500
got your own show I have one called pump up the volume named after the movie

14:30.500 --> 14:33.520
Because that movie was awesome and had Christians later. Mm-hmm

14:34.340 --> 14:39.220
But anyway, it's just a music request show. I play whatever I was supposed to do an 80s marathon

14:39.860 --> 14:44.960
Last week and I like sort of got bored with that and just played whatever Cena has nothing to do with DDR

14:44.960 --> 14:45.820
But it's still cool

14:45.820 --> 14:50.560
But every so often I will get a mad fit and just play nothing but Bimani just because I feel like it

14:51.340 --> 14:56.200
But the show is on Tuesdays pre show starts at 7 the normal show is 730 to 1030

14:56.200 --> 15:01.060
30 although as of late I've just been you know really bored and starting to

15:01.060 --> 15:07.820
show a little bit earlier and extending it a little bit to 1230 range so just

15:07.820 --> 15:12.500
tune in and listen as long as you can all right sounds good also on this

15:12.500 --> 15:15.980
station Monday night tomorrow night seven o'clock diversion which is our

15:15.980 --> 15:19.660
name for the orange lounge radio remix show and that's where we play all these

15:19.660 --> 15:23.180
different Bahmani remixes fan-made ones like things that were picked up in

15:23.180 --> 15:28.160
tournaments and stuff like that all the way to like remixes done so well their

15:28.160 --> 15:31.280
professional quality and that would be like the diverse systems albums we play

15:31.280 --> 15:35.480
that stuff on the show really good Bahmani remix stuff and you know we're

15:35.480 --> 15:39.200
gonna be adding to the playlist this week because there was a new remix thing

15:39.200 --> 15:43.280
that just came out but we'll talk about that later in the show definitely so

15:43.280 --> 15:47.560
it's out later in the show meanwhile we have to start off tonight's show the way

15:47.560 --> 15:50.600
we always start off the show because it's tradition and that's a little

15:50.600 --> 15:55.600
We call. How was your week? How was your day? You want to say something real fast, Loki?

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
No.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.600
He's looking antsy and he has a Happy Noodle Boy shirt, which is cool.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.600
Why do you do this show, Loki?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.600
Because I'm here.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.600
I don't know why.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.600
Because you sat on the floor for all of those months.

16:07.600 --> 16:12.600
I could be getting in three hours of quality Final Fantasy XI time right now.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.600
And look at this. Now who is sitting on the floor? Who are we forcing to sit on the floor?

16:16.600 --> 16:19.600
The guy that works at Konami. We're making sit on the floor today.

16:19.600 --> 16:24.360
sit there and pet Loki's cock. It's okay, he has company, he has my cock in his hand,

16:24.360 --> 16:29.280
so that's alright. Would you put your cock on our webcam there? If you go to our webcam,

16:29.280 --> 16:33.000
www.orangelandradio.com, it's right there on the front page. Loki's gonna show off his

16:33.000 --> 16:37.680
cock to all you guys, so you know what we're talking about. Alright. Anyway. And then you

16:37.680 --> 16:42.400
better put that thing away. Yeah, you should put that thing away before it scares somebody.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.000
How was your week, how was your day? We're gonna start off with the lovely lady who always

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
starts it off, my co-host, Dark Sakura.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
My week sucked ass.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Okay.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.240
Well, my week was okay, except my alarm clock completely died, and I made it to work on

16:57.240 --> 17:02.600
time Wednesday, but on Thursday, see, I was supposed to be at work at 7.30, okay, you

17:02.600 --> 17:04.320
know what time I got out of bed?

17:04.320 --> 17:05.320
Quarter after 8.

17:05.320 --> 17:09.560
My ass was there at 9 o'clock, and you know what, I didn't get written out, so it's cool.

17:09.560 --> 17:14.400
And I just worked an extra 30 minutes, and it was all good, so I got some extra sleep

17:14.400 --> 17:20.120
that day, but I was still tired all day. I finished one of my fanfics today. I finally

17:20.120 --> 17:28.400
completed it. It's on fanfiction.net, somewhere. What kind of fanfic? I write fanfiction. You

17:28.400 --> 17:34.140
don't want to tell us what kind? I write G.I. Joe fanfiction. A real American hero. Yes.

17:34.140 --> 17:38.320
That's right. I'm also working on other stories, though. I'm actually working on a novel, which

17:38.320 --> 17:43.440
is sort of on hold, because guess what? I'm not going to have free time anymore. I got

17:43.440 --> 17:48.060
my award letter from ARC, which made me all bouncy, and they still haven't freakin' put

17:48.060 --> 17:52.580
my money on the stupid website, so I can't get my student loan yet, but, uh, this is

17:52.580 --> 17:55.940
okay, because in a couple weeks I'm gonna have a laptop. That'll make it all better.

17:55.940 --> 17:58.540
Now, ARC, that's the local college here in SAC where you're-

17:58.540 --> 18:01.040
American River College. Yee-haw.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.920
They actually have a DDR machine there at the, um, cafeteria.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.920
I'm just- I'm gonna go reference-

18:04.920 --> 18:06.720
Are you ever gonna touch that thing, you think?

18:06.720 --> 18:10.280
I might, but I don't want to get cooties.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.280
My plan was to go run track

18:13.280 --> 18:17.140
on Monday and Wednesday, because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.

18:17.140 --> 18:23.280
But I think after my Saturday class I might go play some DDR.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.280
Anything else you want to say about your weekend today?

18:26.280 --> 18:30.760
I had some angst.

18:30.760 --> 18:34.100
I had a good bit of angst.

18:34.100 --> 18:40.100
Very few times. We've done this, what, 106 weeks now? I think maybe two times you came in here not angsty about something.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.100
Okay, this isn't angry angst, okay?

18:43.100 --> 18:44.100
Okay, this is real angst.

18:44.100 --> 18:52.100
This is, like, on the level of... it's of the same intensity as teenage high school drama angst. Which is pretty intense.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.100
Is it my fault?

18:53.100 --> 18:54.100
No.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.100
Oh, that's good then.

18:55.100 --> 18:59.100
If it was your fault, I'd tell you. I'd be like, nah, listen up, bitch.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.100
Alright, good.

19:01.100 --> 19:11.600
But that was, yeah. Oh, and yesterday, I hung out with Iguana Girl and Tia, and we turned her hair from nearly jet black to bright red.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.100
Is this like a girls bonding kind of thing?

19:13.100 --> 19:24.100
Girls bonding thing over low carb ice cream. And I did something stupid. Low carb ice cream is damn good. It's made with whole cream. I did something stupid. Look at this.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.100
Hey, I like your hair, though. I like it like that.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.100
I dyed my bangs blonde.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
I wish you weren't camshies, you could show the other ones.

19:33.100 --> 19:38.100
They had to bleach out Tia's hair to turn it red.

19:38.100 --> 19:40.100
So I was like, hey, bleach my bangs, that'll be fun.

19:40.100 --> 19:45.100
Except the bleach was running out of activation power.

19:45.100 --> 19:52.100
So only one side took the bleach very well and the other one's a lot lighter.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.100
I mean, it looks okay.

19:53.100 --> 19:58.100
Except I forgot that since I had dyed my hair black before, the ends are still dark.

19:58.100 --> 20:02.500
I guess I could get on the- this is the only time you're gonna get me on the cam, okay?

20:02.500 --> 20:03.500
Okay, alright.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.500
So...

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
I got it.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.500
So...

20:06.500 --> 20:07.500
Pass off the microphone to somebody.

20:07.500 --> 20:11.540
Alright, well we'll go to somebody else while Jamie poses on cam with a hair.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.540
Uh, Angel.

20:12.540 --> 20:13.540
Angel, how was your week?

20:13.540 --> 20:14.540
How was your day?

20:14.540 --> 20:15.540
Uh, pretty good.

20:15.540 --> 20:20.860
Um, I'm still kind of adapting to, uh, certain things, if you want to talk about that.

20:20.860 --> 20:22.700
Cause, uh, nobody really knows.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.100
I mean, they kind of know, but they don't.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.940
if you want to

20:27.940 --> 20:31.660
talk about that for a bit. I don't know. Do you?

20:31.660 --> 20:33.140
Rob? Well sure, sure, go ahead.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.100
I'm sorry, I was reading some other stuff going on.

20:35.100 --> 20:39.740
Yeah. I'm having a laugh at some other stuff that I'm reading.

20:39.740 --> 20:41.860
Hi Chat Room! Please type!

20:41.860 --> 20:45.340
Okay, anyway.

20:45.340 --> 20:47.380
Oh, yeah. That's all good. Anyway.

20:47.380 --> 20:51.900
Alright, so about three weeks ago I

20:51.900 --> 20:53.140
moved out

20:53.140 --> 21:00.100
first time in my life, so I live here now. And that's still very strange for me to say,

21:00.100 --> 21:06.820
but I assume I will get used to it as time goes on. So, I don't know, that's about it

21:06.820 --> 21:18.220
I guess. I work here and duh. But it's cool. And I live with Magus. Everybody hide. Yeah,

21:18.220 --> 21:21.100
the bad jokes go on and on and on and on.

21:21.100 --> 21:25.100
And if you haven't listened to our show before, 23 Maggots is always full of bad jokes.

21:25.100 --> 21:30.100
Has he added another sheet of toilet paper to his joke book?

21:30.100 --> 21:34.100
He's added many sheets of toilet paper to his notebook.

21:34.100 --> 21:40.100
I wish I could sneak into his room in the middle of the night, take a match, and sprint it.

21:40.100 --> 21:43.100
But that would be bad, because then I wouldn't have a place to live.

21:43.100 --> 21:48.100
So yeah, I'll just leave it in the bathroom so his brother can mangle it or something.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.020
Anyway, okay, I guess I'm done.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.860
Alright, let's go over to somebody else

21:53.860 --> 21:57.220
brand new to the show, never been here before. How are you doing, Andrew?

21:57.220 --> 22:01.020
I'm very tired, how are you doing? How was your week, how was your day? Very busy,

22:01.020 --> 22:05.540
this week was my last day working full-time at my job teaching kids. I'm

22:05.540 --> 22:10.220
very excited that I don't have to do that anymore, because that was getting very stressful.

22:10.220 --> 22:13.500
But beyond that, just doing usual stuff,

22:13.500 --> 22:17.580
like especially avoiding jail bait. I seem to have like this 16-year-old

22:17.580 --> 22:21.260
fan club which doesn't do me any good. You know, I've heard a lot of DDR guys have this

22:21.260 --> 22:26.460
problem. Hey man, I don't know what it is. I had the same problem when I worked at Roundtable.

22:26.460 --> 22:32.820
For some reason, the fact that I was in a shift manager position, meaning I could provide

22:32.820 --> 22:37.500
free pizza. Yeah, there you go. Get a lot of fangirls that way. Yes. In fact, one day

22:37.500 --> 22:42.580
would like spread rumors because my mom worked as like a yard duty at the junior high. And

22:42.580 --> 22:47.060
So I'd hear rumors saying, this is a girl saying that you guys are like dating.

22:47.060 --> 22:49.420
And I'm like, what?

22:49.420 --> 22:50.580
That was funny.

22:50.580 --> 22:54.820
Wow, yeah, it's unusual.

22:54.820 --> 22:58.700
But I don't know what it is, if it's the DDR or what, or if that I look like four

22:58.700 --> 23:00.740
years younger than I really am.

23:00.740 --> 23:03.100
Because most people think I look like 16, I'm almost 21.

23:03.100 --> 23:04.060
You do look kind of young.

23:04.060 --> 23:05.140
They can probably see you on camera now.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.580
Also, they want you to speak up.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.100
OK, sorry.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.260
Right there, got it.

23:09.260 --> 23:10.620
You have to scream like I do.

23:10.620 --> 23:11.020
Got it?

23:11.020 --> 23:12.420
OK.

23:12.420 --> 23:17.360
gotcha

23:17.360 --> 23:20.380
all right so anything else you want to share besides the underage girls

23:20.380 --> 23:22.940
know that that's pretty much all that goes on now

23:22.940 --> 23:25.340
all right is

23:25.340 --> 23:28.300
all right so uh... i guess we'll come over here then and talk to our uh...

23:28.300 --> 23:29.260
other guests

23:29.260 --> 23:30.720
uh... c squared

23:30.720 --> 23:32.420
as he's now known what

23:32.420 --> 23:35.180
why the name change again you had to go into the media

23:35.180 --> 23:39.560
everybody knew who you were before you know not everybody not everybody

23:39.560 --> 23:42.720
Nobody cared before you had the flashing foot. You were a nobody.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.300
I was a nobody.

23:44.300 --> 23:49.940
Now I changed it because I figured that would be the best course of action.

23:49.940 --> 23:55.100
Apparently it doesn't matter, so you know, I made that name for no good reason.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.380
Oh well.

23:58.380 --> 24:01.480
So, what are we doing again right now? How was your week? How was your day?

24:01.480 --> 24:04.160
Okay, my week? I worked.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.660
That's pretty much it. That's all I do.

24:07.660 --> 24:08.660
every week

24:08.660 --> 24:09.900
uh...

24:09.900 --> 24:11.880
then yesterday

24:11.880 --> 24:14.380
uh... i went out to dave and busters

24:14.380 --> 24:16.900
uh... which is really cool because it was my first time

24:16.900 --> 24:19.500
so all those people on the airfreak

24:19.500 --> 24:20.740
you guys uh...

24:20.740 --> 24:22.400
that's probably why

24:22.400 --> 24:25.860
you didn't get anything from any of the vivid members last night because we were

24:25.860 --> 24:30.460
all at dave and busters getting drunk so

24:30.460 --> 24:32.680
yeah uh...

24:32.680 --> 24:35.540
so i had a good time uh... played some games

24:35.540 --> 24:37.600
played that other dancing game

24:37.600 --> 24:40.260
uh... you mean uh...

24:40.260 --> 24:42.740
i mean pump it up

24:42.740 --> 24:43.940
that's right

24:43.940 --> 24:47.080
don't don't discriminate against the other games it's cool you can do the

24:47.080 --> 24:48.240
pump jump

24:48.240 --> 24:51.380
uh... they pull over and uh... do it

24:51.380 --> 24:52.560
whatever it goes

24:52.560 --> 24:53.400
awesome

24:53.400 --> 24:55.760
uh...

24:55.760 --> 24:57.120
me and i worked

24:57.120 --> 24:59.120
the end

24:59.120 --> 25:04.660
and uh... a obviously got my uh... vivid status on the air freak which

25:04.660 --> 25:06.660
i swear you guys friday

25:06.660 --> 25:12.500
me in Float Walk. If you don't know who Float Walk is, I'm not gonna tell you. We had, like,

25:12.500 --> 25:18.500
a laugh a minute, and you guys are seriously creeping us out with the DNL Photoshop pictures.

25:18.500 --> 25:23.700
It was like looking at a Fark.com Photoshop contest, honestly. It was hilarious. Just,

25:23.700 --> 25:28.140
it was creepy. That's really all I can say to that. But, you know, if you happen to want

25:28.140 --> 25:35.900
to do it again? It was funny. So, yeah. That was my week, and today I came to Sacramento

25:35.900 --> 25:42.100
in the end. All right. Well, we'll be asking you more questions, certainly, about your

25:42.100 --> 25:46.180
work this week. Oh, yeah. You guys might want to pay attention, because who knows if I give

25:46.180 --> 25:52.900
hints or not. We don't know. I want to talk about hints with you in a little while. I

25:52.900 --> 25:55.260
I have big questions to ask you about H.I.N.C.E.

25:55.260 --> 26:00.340
Anyway, um, Loki, how was your week, how was your day, since, you know, I know everybody

26:00.340 --> 26:03.780
out there on DDRFreak really cares how your week and your day was.

26:03.780 --> 26:04.780
Ask, screw them.

26:04.780 --> 26:05.780
What?

26:05.780 --> 26:07.580
No, I'm looking, I'm looking right now.

26:07.580 --> 26:10.920
They all, they're all like, man, we are such big fan- you know what?

26:10.920 --> 26:12.380
Just don't bother playing the song tonight.

26:12.380 --> 26:14.240
Just don't, you can save that till next week.

26:14.240 --> 26:19.320
I want to know about you guys' week and your day, especially you, Loki.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.320
Especially me?

26:20.320 --> 26:21.320
What the hell?

26:21.320 --> 26:22.700
You make it look like I had an interesting week.

26:22.700 --> 26:31.740
Okay, so this week what I was doing, I was, I, yes, I did, but that's not the point. I

26:31.740 --> 26:36.700
did that towards the end of the week. The beginning of the week was even better, okay?

26:36.700 --> 26:44.300
Basically what happened was that, no. It's too slow to play Final Fantasy, and I don't

26:44.300 --> 26:49.860
want to have to buy another copy of it. For what would I do then? Anyways, um, so I was

26:49.860 --> 26:56.840
really bored at work, like usual, um, so I browse websites. You know, when I can't browse

26:56.840 --> 27:00.880
Bemani websites, because I read them too fast, and no one posts fast enough for me to read

27:00.880 --> 27:06.000
everything, I browse other things. And this week, it was the Shadowlands.net. And what

27:06.000 --> 27:11.740
the Shadowlands.net is, is a big paranormal website, about all, like, hauntings and shit.

27:11.740 --> 27:15.700
So, I got on this, like, paranormal kick for, like, this whole week, and basically just

27:15.700 --> 27:26.380
figuring all this stuff out. And so now, for some reason, I'm going to bid on a supposedly haunted-possessed doll that's fucked-up looking, and I'm gonna buy that.

27:26.380 --> 27:27.840
Those things are cool.

27:27.840 --> 27:38.760
No, it's supposedly a really fucked-up, real, not-not the pictures I posted, like, a real doll that is supposedly haunted. Like, and they have photographic proof and shit.

27:38.760 --> 27:43.760
Anyways, so I'm gonna buy that and put it at my desk at work to creep out my co-worker.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.760
And that's the whole point.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
That's beautiful.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.760
I thought that'd be, that'd be great.

27:48.760 --> 27:49.760
So I might do that.

27:49.760 --> 27:53.760
I don't know, depends on how expensive it is, cause I have to also fix my cabinet, cause

27:53.760 --> 27:57.760
I found it earlier this week, cause the way I have it set up, there's like some conflicts

27:57.760 --> 28:03.760
with some of the controller things I have on there, so I need to buy a new keyboard

28:03.760 --> 28:05.760
encoder to get the main cabinet working.

28:05.760 --> 28:11.760
But I've been playing lots of games, more porno games again and Kicking Ass and Gals Panic and all that stuff because it's fun.

28:11.760 --> 28:23.760
And, um, oh what else? Oh, I don't know, um, I actually had a pretty interesting weekend, um, on Friday night I went to a bar and, um, hung out there with co-workers that I don't like.

28:23.760 --> 28:30.760
And there was a girl that supposedly asked me to dance but it was so loud in there I couldn't understand a word she was saying.

28:30.760 --> 28:38.760
I heard this, ehhhh, outside! I'm like, huh? And then she kind of walked off really pissed.

28:38.760 --> 28:42.760
And I don't know what the hell happened, and my friend standing next to me was like, actually

28:42.760 --> 28:49.760
that was a good dance. I'm like, oh. So that was fun. And so we did that, and they had

28:49.760 --> 28:55.760
a giant hippo head with a bagpipe in his mouth, so I thought that was kind of neat. And last

28:55.760 --> 28:59.760
night we went and saw some comedians. There was a guy that looked like Mr. Bean, and another

28:59.760 --> 29:08.760
It looked like Ray Romano. That was pretty cool. Then there was this Mexican guy headlining. And, because the guy was really cool, I bought his CD, so I'm gonna give you a copy, Jamie, so you can play it on your show.

29:08.760 --> 29:09.760
Awesome.

29:09.760 --> 29:17.760
It's a 25-minute set of his. I can't remember the guy's name for the life of me. But, um, I think he was on Comedy Central. I could've sworn I remembered his stand-up bit on, uh...

29:17.760 --> 29:19.760
It's funny comedy, you know? Play it.

29:19.760 --> 29:26.760
But, yeah, he was, like, there's these people that are drunk really, like, next to us and stuff, and he was just ripped into them all night. It was great.

29:26.760 --> 29:33.760
So, that's what I did last night, and then, you know, Final Fantasy XI in the middle there, so.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.760
Uh, dang.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.760
Yeah. And then, of course, there's other things I did, but we're gonna get into that later.

29:39.760 --> 29:43.760
More, uh, stuff I downloaded and whatnot.

29:43.760 --> 29:48.760
I, uh, my week and my day was, uh, pretty decent. This was the first week back from the East Coast.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.760
Uh, so, I was just kinda trying to catch up on everything.

29:51.760 --> 30:01.760
And, you know, last night I was at Dave & Buster's with Seagurd and some of the other folks there, and I went to go play Pump It Up because they don't have any other Bomani there.

30:01.760 --> 30:10.760
Although somebody told me they have the I Can Dance game there, the Itoy game. I'm sorry, I Can Boogie, which is the, it's basically Itoy Groove in the arcades. I could not find it.

30:10.760 --> 30:15.760
I should have, I didn't realize it was there and I should have thought to ask Mel or somebody who goes there all the time, but...

30:15.760 --> 30:20.760
Don't worry, you didn't miss anything. It sucks ass. Oh my god, it sucks ass.

30:20.760 --> 30:24.760
Well, it's alright. So fine. I didn't get to play it.

30:24.760 --> 30:29.760
So, instead I decided to play it and I realized

30:29.760 --> 30:34.760
I decided to play Bump It Up and then I realized that I haven't really played DDR

30:34.760 --> 30:39.760
seriously in about three months or so. So, I haven't really gotten any

30:39.760 --> 30:44.760
more stamina than I had before. And of course Shane gets up on there and wants to play

30:44.760 --> 30:49.760
like 9-footers. What the hell was that song you made us do last that killed me?

30:49.760 --> 30:56.160
was clap your hands on crazy, and you know, we were just worn out so we didn't pass it.

30:56.160 --> 31:01.240
I seriously thought I was gonna die. I had to go out in the parking lot and go hoo, hoo,

31:01.240 --> 31:07.360
hoo. Like, it was horrible. So I ended up missing like an hour of some good gaming.

31:07.360 --> 31:12.440
Some good feeding quarters into the giant crane machine because I was gonna die.

31:12.440 --> 31:16.960
I actually, I experienced the same thing you felt, except I'm really out of shape because

31:16.960 --> 31:23.920
I haven't played DDR in months, lots of months, and I went and played seven footers on doubles

31:23.920 --> 31:29.600
and I was out of breath, like heart attack out of breath, and that's really sad. But

31:29.600 --> 31:34.040
I'm working on the cabinet, it's gonna be done, DDR will be able to be played, and I

31:34.040 --> 31:35.800
will get back into shape again.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.320
How is that cabinet coming along? You built, now for those that haven't been listening

31:38.320 --> 31:43.360
to the show for, well I mean that's a lot of you guys tonight, I frankly know, you've

31:43.360 --> 31:46.660
You've been building your own home cabinet, which is like your dream machine.

31:46.660 --> 31:48.820
Tell us a little bit more about this cabinet you've been building.

31:48.820 --> 31:52.060
Well this thing's basically an all-in-one Bomani cabinet and arcade cabinet.

31:52.060 --> 31:56.580
Right now, the first part of it's done, which is the MAME part of it, so I have a four-player

31:56.580 --> 32:03.700
kind of control panel with two of the players having six buttons, three and four having

32:03.700 --> 32:04.700
just four buttons.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.900
And it's basically just set up for MAME right now.

32:06.900 --> 32:16.900
Later on, though, I'm working on a setup for DDR, Dance Maniacs, 2DX, and Poppy Music, all, um, you know, can be built.

32:16.900 --> 32:22.900
And I actually have most of the stuff designed and, um, all the supplies to do it. I just have to get around to actually doing it.

32:22.900 --> 32:27.900
Um, so that's, you know, what I'm basically working on right now.

32:27.900 --> 32:41.900
So be, you know, pretty much the whole arcade at my house just because our arcade kind of sucks as far as putting, you know, working together machines there and keeping their games away from the little kiddies.

32:41.900 --> 32:56.900
So, I was forced to do this by them. I was forced to spend $3,000 to fix up a nice cabinet so I have working games because I like playing arcade games and I refuse to go to an arcade that has broken games.

32:56.900 --> 33:02.020
I think that they should put all the Golf Land children in a pen and put like spider stomp in it

33:03.460 --> 33:06.420
And just leave them there. We'll actually stomp on the children. Oh

33:07.260 --> 33:08.940
That would be awesome

33:08.940 --> 33:14.200
Like a giant troubled board game instead of having dice in the middle have children in the pop-o-matic bubble

33:14.580 --> 33:18.540
That would be wonderful bang it and they go pop. I wish they had

33:19.500 --> 33:22.780
How many seconds they scream is how long you can move? Oh?

33:22.780 --> 33:28.660
Oh my god, it's kiddomatic trouble in giant size, Eep.

33:28.660 --> 33:33.260
Or how about a giant catapult with piano wire above them?

33:33.260 --> 33:34.260
Ooh!

33:34.260 --> 33:38.300
But no, if you kill them, you have to get more children, and that means that people

33:38.300 --> 33:40.780
have to breed.

33:40.780 --> 33:41.780
They're going to breed anyways.

33:41.780 --> 33:42.780
Because they're stupid.

33:42.780 --> 33:45.900
I still think that they should make standardized testing for breeding.

33:45.900 --> 33:49.260
Not only are they going to breed, they're breeding at younger and younger ages these

33:49.260 --> 33:50.260
days.

33:50.260 --> 33:55.620
gonna be like a a baby that has a baby just wait a ten-year-old had a baby

33:55.620 --> 34:00.940
disgusting I mean it was a bad situation that produced it but still I know man

34:00.940 --> 34:04.980
they're like getting blow jobs and shit in junior high I want to know where the

34:04.980 --> 34:09.180
hell was this shit when I was in junior high fucking a I've been like you know

34:09.180 --> 34:13.060
I'm a little young for a blow job I'm fucked that I'd be like shit man get

34:13.060 --> 34:17.260
over here you know but that shit was never there when I was in junior high

34:17.260 --> 34:23.380
that pisses me off. Fucking kids have it so lucky nowadays. She didn't live in Alabama.

34:23.380 --> 34:28.460
I don't care what they say about the tradition, you know, the whole Christian look of this,

34:28.460 --> 34:33.980
uh-uh, no. Depends on where you live. People are doing it early. You see, now if I lived

34:33.980 --> 34:39.220
in Vacaville, at least there'd be plenty of sheep and stuff, but, you know, I don't have

34:39.220 --> 34:43.620
that kind of convenience here in, you know, Folsom and stuff around the area. Do you love

34:43.620 --> 34:48.020
I just wanted to say about the whole little kids having kids.

34:48.020 --> 34:53.320
My middle school, we had a couple kids there have children, and that's back in Kansas,

34:53.320 --> 34:55.880
so you know there's nothing to do there.

34:55.880 --> 35:02.200
Let's hear it for family values.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.200
Different strokes or different folks?

35:03.200 --> 35:04.200
All right.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.140
Some are stroking it.

35:06.140 --> 35:09.180
And if more people stroked it, we wouldn't have a baby outbreak anyway.

35:09.180 --> 35:10.180
Yeah, exactly.

35:10.180 --> 35:15.300
This is why, this is why for the whole anti, you know, like what is it that they're doing

35:15.300 --> 35:17.200
in, was it in Texas I think?

35:17.200 --> 35:24.460
The whole abstinence, teaching abstinence instead of safe, you know, forms of intercourse.

35:24.460 --> 35:29.380
Instead they should just teach the joy of masturbation.

35:29.380 --> 35:32.440
Why go out when you can get it at home?

35:32.440 --> 35:36.940
On that note, I think we're going to go ahead and take a break, and when we come back from

35:36.940 --> 35:41.140
this break I definitely yeah and I think it's hilarious because a lot of people

35:41.140 --> 35:44.780
that are listening to show right now are like why don't you guys play the song at

35:44.780 --> 35:49.180
630 hey nobody said we were gonna play the song at 630 we said we're gonna play

35:49.180 --> 35:55.060
it during the show which runs between 630 and 930 and if that happens to be at

35:55.060 --> 36:03.540
929 you all just have to deal but maybe we'll do 928 we'll see all right no

36:03.540 --> 36:08.540
we'll get it in eventually here when we feel like it when Jamie says it's time

36:08.540 --> 36:13.780
lord knows what that'll be all right all right but actually no we do have some

36:13.780 --> 36:17.100
fun stuff coming up for you we'll get back I guess we can talk about DDR

36:17.100 --> 36:21.060
because huh I will I will play it we're gonna do some Akira this break actually

36:21.060 --> 36:27.100
for those you know what all right since everybody's been like relatively good

36:27.100 --> 36:30.220
even though there has been some shit talking on the forums out there that

36:30.220 --> 36:35.100
makes me a little bit angry. I guess we can do, like, another little tease here. How about

36:35.100 --> 36:37.020
a tease? Do you guys want another little tease?

36:37.020 --> 36:38.060
Go tease it, Rob.

36:38.060 --> 36:39.660
I'm gonna tease it right now, you guys. Here it is.

36:39.660 --> 36:49.140
Oh, that's it. That's it. That was a tease. All right. All right. So, now that that tease

36:49.140 --> 36:52.340
has been done, let's go to a break. When we come back, I think we'll actually talk about

36:52.340 --> 36:53.340
some DDR6.

36:53.340 --> 36:54.340
Make it big.

36:54.340 --> 36:59.900
I want to talk about how Seagurd's internet penis just grew enormous this week. Enormous.

36:59.900 --> 37:03.980
and people want us to talk it's so we're going to talk to him

37:03.980 --> 37:06.000
or lack thereof when we come back

37:06.000 --> 37:07.240
from this break

37:07.240 --> 37:11.580
and uh... i will also be giving heads as well

37:11.580 --> 37:14.360
but you don't even work for coming in you've never played i think if that's

37:14.360 --> 37:16.660
because i have insider info you

37:16.660 --> 37:20.580
breaking more on that every and that anyone else can get but you're just you

37:20.580 --> 37:23.840
fucking stupid to realize that we told you like

37:23.840 --> 37:28.740
four fucking months ago or even before that what the hell do you think that

37:28.740 --> 37:33.380
That's alright. I'm gonna tell you that I told you so, and you can just kiss my ass again.

37:33.380 --> 37:37.940
You can blow me, just like you blew me before when it came down to, you know, fucking saying,

37:37.940 --> 37:43.220
Oh, Sakura's not gonna be in DDR Extreme. Fuck you! Okay? That's what I have to say about that.

37:44.540 --> 37:46.140
Someone's full of the anger tonight.

37:46.140 --> 37:50.740
That Loki guy screams into the microphone too much. He screams. He screams into the microphone.

37:50.740 --> 37:51.540
He's scary.

37:51.540 --> 37:53.140
Why doesn't somebody give him a drug?

37:53.140 --> 37:56.780
Why can't he just shut up and play the song?

37:56.780 --> 37:57.780
Just shut up.

37:57.780 --> 37:58.780
Give us a hint.

37:58.780 --> 37:59.780
Give us a hint.

37:59.780 --> 38:00.780
I have a hint for you.

38:00.780 --> 38:03.220
It's called Bite My Ass.

38:03.220 --> 38:04.220
Now be nice.

38:04.220 --> 38:07.900
We want the listeners to come back when they realize that we're not that bad.

38:07.900 --> 38:08.900
No, we're not that bad.

38:08.900 --> 38:09.900
We're really not.

38:09.900 --> 38:10.900
We're just messing with you guys tonight.

38:10.900 --> 38:11.900
Seriously.

38:11.900 --> 38:12.900
Seriously, though, just listen.

38:12.900 --> 38:13.900
Just stay patient.

38:13.900 --> 38:14.900
Patience is a virtue.

38:14.900 --> 38:15.900
Be virtuous.

38:15.900 --> 38:16.900
I know it's hard, but you can wait.

38:16.900 --> 38:17.900
Okay.

38:17.900 --> 38:18.900
Okay.

38:18.900 --> 38:25.900
to us. I know it's hard, but you can wait. Ok. Alright, we'll be back after some Akira.

Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, I'm going to show you how

46:02.220 --> 46:06.060
My girlfriend, Melody, can join us on all the fun together.

46:06.060 --> 46:12.460
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

46:12.460 --> 46:14.980
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

46:14.980 --> 46:19.980
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

46:19.980 --> 46:24.020
Hello, we are back with Orange Lounge Radio. That's our buddy, Mel B.

46:24.020 --> 46:24.940
I think he's listening tonight.

46:24.940 --> 46:25.860
He's hanging out in our chat room tonight.

46:25.860 --> 46:27.180
Hello. Hi, Mel, if you're listening.

46:27.180 --> 46:27.700
Hi, Mel.

46:27.700 --> 46:29.140
And Melody, too, is on their house.

46:29.140 --> 46:30.380
Hi, Melody.

46:30.380 --> 46:32.820
And I spent some time with Melody last night.

46:32.820 --> 46:37.780
Not in that way, but I spent some quality bonding time with Melody, because she's my girl.

46:37.780 --> 46:39.580
So, it was good to see her.

46:39.580 --> 46:44.440
And I'm hoping to see her again in a couple weeks, because I want to go over to San Jose for the Classic Gaming Expo.

46:44.440 --> 46:48.820
You know what, I'm still skipping class for that. You need to, you need to come with me.

46:48.820 --> 46:49.860
Well, Dan's going.

46:49.860 --> 46:54.860
Oh, well hell, we all need to go. So Dan and I are going to have ourselves a hotel. You know Konami is having a showing

46:54.860 --> 46:57.540
there at Classic Gaming Expo?

46:57.540 --> 47:02.240
I wonder if there will be some twinbee for me to play.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.780
I hear that Konami is going to make a showing.

47:04.780 --> 47:10.780
But I can't say what's going on. I don't think so. But I'm very glad that it's in San Jose this year instead of in Vegas because that would have been pricey.

47:10.780 --> 47:16.480
Yeah, at least it's drivable here. The only good thing about it being in Vegas is that I would have been able to have seen

47:16.480 --> 47:19.680
Maranjan.

47:19.680 --> 47:21.820
I'm making plans at another time

47:21.820 --> 47:27.140
if someone has two hundred and fifty dollars to lend me.

47:27.140 --> 47:29.140
That's a hint!

47:29.140 --> 47:30.140
No, it's not.

47:30.140 --> 47:32.140
Maybe worth money! That's a hint!

47:32.140 --> 47:38.140
Be careful with the way you use the word hint on tonight's show, because people are gonna run with it.

47:38.140 --> 47:40.140
Oh, you don't think I said that on purpose?

47:40.140 --> 47:44.140
I'm teasing them.

47:44.140 --> 47:54.140
Just so you guys know, if myself, Loki, or Dark Sakura say something as a hint, we're pretty much talking out our ass because there's this little thing called NDA, called the non-disclosure agreement,

47:54.140 --> 48:00.640
which means that even though our buddy works at Konami, he can't tell us what's going on, or they will fire his ass, and we don't want that to happen to him.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.640
No, we don't want that to happen.

48:02.640 --> 48:07.140
When I can disclose anything I want because they can fire me all they want, I don't work for them.

48:07.140 --> 48:08.640
No.

48:08.640 --> 48:13.640
I will disclose it all. Everything. Everything.

48:14.640 --> 48:22.640
But, no, it's surprising, um, is, you know, this information's been out forever, and just people just... they're really... I can't say anything.

48:22.640 --> 48:28.880
What we can talk about, I can't mention this, is that a few months ago, and you can go back

48:28.880 --> 48:32.640
in the Orange Lounge Radio story archives, and you can look at, we had a story that talked

48:32.640 --> 48:38.960
about how some folks were hacking the disc for DDR. What disc were they hacking back

48:38.960 --> 48:39.960
at that point?

48:39.960 --> 48:45.080
It was Party Collection, and there's a master list. Okay, here's how it works. When they're

48:45.080 --> 48:49.520
making the games, there's a master list of all the songs that have been in all the games,

48:49.520 --> 49:09.520
and they're going to be in all the game, well basically whatever they're working on up to that point. It's just a master list. Think of it like if you're familiar with MAME, there's a master ROM list. Okay, well this is a master song list. So it's going to contain everything from the arcade versions, the home versions, and home versions that they're working on at the moment.

49:09.520 --> 49:29.520
So, here's the thing right now. As I said before, you know, there are some songs in there that they, you know, they're all, oh, those are, you know, don't believe that. Because, you know, back in the day when DDR Max was first coming out, and remember there was that Orion Civilization supposedly remix of that, but it was just under a different name.

49:29.520 --> 49:49.520
Well, everyone's like, oh, those lists are wrong. And then they're saying, oh, well, Nemesis is supposed to be in Max 2 or something like that, or the DDR Extreme, and that never happened. Well, guess what? Remember the sound packs and the Nemesis was there? That's because when Konami's working on songs, they don't necessarily throw it into the very next mix that comes out.

49:49.520 --> 49:55.440
that comes out so this you know list that was in a party collection guess

49:55.440 --> 50:00.320
what there's gonna be some of those songs in the next mix and guess what I

50:00.320 --> 50:06.320
told you fuckers that before and no everyone is wrong max period that's a

50:06.320 --> 50:11.120
dumb name for a song but guess what read that it's a dumb name okay it's a dumb

50:11.120 --> 50:15.800
name for a song that's so fucking wrong and then there was you know I mean all

50:15.800 --> 50:21.180
in its piece of shit glory. This is where we point and laugh. No, but there are songs,

50:21.180 --> 50:26.180
I mean a lot of songs actually, that are in there that are going to be in, you know, extremes.

50:26.180 --> 50:34.780
So, I told you so. I'm actually trying to find that list from when we posted it, trying

50:34.780 --> 50:39.540
to post, we were posting that list and then I distinctly remember that Diving was in that

50:39.540 --> 50:43.420
list and it has been confirmed that Diving is going to be in DDR Extreme, that's no secret,

50:43.420 --> 50:46.860
Four Strings Diving, because I remember we were talking about that list on an earlier

50:46.860 --> 50:51.060
show and I saw Diving and I said, oh, that's another song on that Four Strings album, so

50:51.060 --> 50:52.060
Diving must be in there.

50:52.060 --> 50:55.420
Come to think of it, that was also in the pre-show, it was on the CD.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.420
Yeah, there you go.

50:57.420 --> 51:02.460
Alright, okay, so I'm going to dig through the archives a little more and we'll go through

51:02.460 --> 51:06.060
that list again and we'll see, you know, maybe there's some song titles in there, but you

51:06.060 --> 51:07.560
know what?

51:07.560 --> 51:09.860
Is Konami capable of throwing red herrings our way?

51:09.860 --> 51:10.860
You bet.

51:10.860 --> 51:14.560
songs that are supposed to be in DDR that don't make it into DDR in the

51:14.560 --> 51:18.980
final cut absolutely yes there are and there are songs that get you know

51:18.980 --> 51:25.580
canceled like for example DDR ultra mix the Humpty dance okay I would have dug

51:25.580 --> 51:31.280
it if the Humpty dance was in DDR been awesome all right but how would you make

51:31.280 --> 51:35.160
steps for that and get it to look right we'll come back we'll come back to this

51:35.160 --> 51:37.780
subject a little later but I wanted I wanted to keep things moving I actually

51:37.780 --> 51:40.380
wanted to talk to Andrew sitting there he's sitting there in the corner and

51:40.380 --> 51:45.120
he's never been here before so are you enjoying things so far oh yeah yeah

51:45.120 --> 51:49.660
good like everybody wants to talk to me you came on a good night yeah everybody

51:49.660 --> 51:52.980
heard you were gonna be here and now our caps are breaking and everything that's

51:52.980 --> 51:56.800
what I heard and I'm really happy that I can contribute like this to your show no

51:56.800 --> 51:59.900
problem you should cut you should come here more often I should appreciate it

51:59.900 --> 52:02.940
in all seriousness for those who don't know you you're the guy and the reason

52:02.940 --> 52:05.620
why I wanted you to be on the show is because you dress up like a pirate when

52:05.620 --> 52:06.620
play DDR?

52:06.620 --> 52:07.620
Yes.

52:07.620 --> 52:08.620
Why?

52:08.620 --> 52:09.620
Why?

52:09.620 --> 52:15.800
Well, at first it started because I'm just a massive attention whore, and I mean honestly,

52:15.800 --> 52:21.320
but I don't know, I mean I got there and I just started playing and some people would

52:21.320 --> 52:26.640
watch, but I was never a freestyler because I'm too white for that shit, so basically

52:26.640 --> 52:32.440
I just was like, I just stopped off at some party store after work one night, bought a

52:32.440 --> 52:36.000
a cheap pirate costume, went into Golfland, and I noticed I turn around and there's like

52:36.000 --> 52:42.340
40 or 50 people. There's like 40 or 50 people watching me, so I'm just like, okay, I'll

52:42.340 --> 52:47.720
keep this up. So I just kind of whore it around in my signature now. I'm a toady 007 on a

52:47.720 --> 52:54.920
Game Facts DDR Freak. Get a hold of me on the NorCal forums. So it's mainly an attention

52:54.920 --> 52:58.520
thing. I haven't done it recently, but uh... Where did you get the idea? Have you just

52:58.520 --> 53:04.400
always had a long-standing love for pirates, or was it an inside joke that got out of control?

53:04.400 --> 53:08.480
It was an inside joke with some colleagues at work. This was before Pirates of the Caribbean

53:08.480 --> 53:10.520
and all that came out. I was going to say, does this have anything to do with Johnny

53:10.520 --> 53:17.180
Depp? No, it doesn't. I don't have a Johnny Depp fetish, or like most people. No, it was

53:17.180 --> 53:21.520
just an inside joke with some people at work. I have a friend that owns a production company

53:21.520 --> 53:28.120
called Shiver Me Timbers Productions, and it kind of went off from there, but, uh...

53:28.120 --> 53:29.400
Shiver Me Timbers!

53:29.400 --> 53:33.600
Yeah, I brought that thing into work the other day. My boss apparently lets me dress up like

53:33.600 --> 53:35.880
a pirate for work, so I thought that was kind of cool.

53:35.880 --> 53:39.160
Now, we all know the Roseville Golf Land, when you go to play DDR there, there's something

53:39.160 --> 53:41.040
that we call the hecklers, or the assholes.

53:41.040 --> 53:42.040
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

53:42.040 --> 53:44.720
There's always people there that make fun of you when you're playing DDR.

53:44.720 --> 53:45.720
Yeah.

53:45.720 --> 53:50.040
FAG! You look like a FAG when you play that game! You're a FAG! Oh, wait, you're a chick.

53:50.040 --> 53:51.040
You're a FAG!

53:51.040 --> 53:56.040
Yeah, I get that anyway even when I'm not playing DDR, but you know, those people, they can kiss my ass, I don't care.

53:56.040 --> 54:03.040
Okay, but how bad is that? I mean, what's the worst you've heard? Dressed up, not only playing DDR, but being a pirate playing DDR. What are some of the things you've heard?

54:03.040 --> 54:07.040
Ironically, I don't think I've gotten any shit for the pirate thing.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.040
Really?

54:08.040 --> 54:14.040
If anything, I get shit when I bar rape. I thought you guys were gonna queue up like a boo sound effect when I say that.

54:14.040 --> 54:15.040
No.

54:15.040 --> 54:20.100
on the show. No. No, the pirate thing, most people just kind of go up and go like, what

54:20.100 --> 54:24.840
in the hell is that guy doing? Because I mean, you can see the little strings on the beard,

54:24.840 --> 54:30.120
you know, it looks totally fake. You know, but I don't really get anything, it just confuses

54:30.120 --> 54:35.120
the hell out of most people, so they think it's kind of funny. And it really ticks off

54:35.120 --> 54:39.160
all the good freestylers because nobody pays attention to them. Wait, we have good freestylers

54:39.160 --> 54:43.960
in this town? No, I'm just kidding. Oh, okay. That's totally a joke. Wait a minute, wait

54:43.960 --> 54:47.960
Oh yeah, yeah. There's no way I'm serious there.

54:47.960 --> 54:51.960
Are you going to take the pirate to any DDR tournaments in the future?

54:51.960 --> 54:55.960
I will try. I've only been to like two so far, and I got

54:55.960 --> 54:59.960
owned at one of them, and I won the other one. But yeah, I will try.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.960
I talked to some friends before a recent one in Sacramento that you were unable to

55:03.960 --> 55:07.960
go to, but I wish you'd shown up. I know, it was the one that was on my birthday.

55:07.960 --> 55:11.960
Yeah, yeah. That's no excuse. That's no excuse. But next one,

55:11.960 --> 55:16.480
next one I'm thinking about it all right all right sounds good I'll think about

55:16.480 --> 55:20.720
it there's supposed to be a big one in Milpitas Friday I don't know it's like

55:20.720 --> 55:24.200
an improv tournament I want to say yeah I have a wedding on that day I have my I

55:24.200 --> 55:27.840
have my alter ego I wanted to take out for that oh okay okay but I don't think

55:27.840 --> 55:30.760
I'm gonna be able to do it which is too bad thing yeah is it do you know if it's

55:30.760 --> 55:34.360
in the afternoon or at night yeah it's like a night it's a Friday night which

55:34.360 --> 55:36.800
kind of sucks for you if you're out of town I don't get those Friday night

55:36.800 --> 55:39.560
things but sometimes you just you have to do a tournament when you can do it

55:39.560 --> 55:45.560
If it's a Friday night, I might be able to do it. I'm not going to enter, but it'll be all good.

55:45.560 --> 55:52.560
Okay, so anything else you wanted to share about...

55:52.560 --> 55:54.560
Is there anything you want to plug while you're here?

55:54.560 --> 55:57.560
When guests come on talk shows, they plug things. Is there anything you want to plug?

55:57.560 --> 55:59.560
You said you had a production company?

55:59.560 --> 56:00.560
No, my friend.

56:00.560 --> 56:02.560
You did a DDR video recently, didn't you?

56:02.560 --> 56:06.560
Yeah, I was in a DDR video. I hoard that onto my live journal.

56:06.560 --> 56:10.200
I guess I'm just the cam whore I guess I don't know if you want to give out that

Oh, I found the link here. It looks like it's shivermetimbersproductions.com.

57:08.120 --> 57:12.120
Yeah, my friend John, who was a colleague of mine at work, he produced that video.

57:12.120 --> 57:17.120
I owe him a lot of lunches for that. So, go ahead and check his site out.

57:17.120 --> 57:19.120
Alright.

57:19.120 --> 57:20.120
Okay, so...

57:20.120 --> 57:23.120
View his bandwidth. I don't want him to have any bandwidth by the end of the week.

57:23.120 --> 57:26.120
Yeah, everybody download that. In fact, open it in multiple windows.

57:26.120 --> 57:27.120
Yes.

57:27.120 --> 57:28.120
Alright.

57:28.120 --> 57:29.120
Yeah.

57:29.120 --> 57:33.120
Okay, let's go back. I want to go back to that master list. I haven't had the chocolate cake.

57:33.120 --> 57:37.120
Jamie's been handing out chocolate cake things to everybody, and I haven't had a chance to eat it yet.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.120
Because I've been talking.

57:40.120 --> 57:45.120
This stuff I think I posted was just the license tracks that I recognized.

57:45.120 --> 57:49.120
This is a story that was posted on May 7th on our website.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.120
And you can go back into our archives and have a look.

57:52.120 --> 57:57.120
And these were the songs that were on the master song list that we speculated could be in DDR Extreme.

57:57.120 --> 58:01.720
extremes. This is nothing new and certainly Shane is not going to confirm or deny anything

58:01.720 --> 58:08.260
and break his NDA, but. Actually, you know, if you look at it, since it is licensed stuff,

58:08.260 --> 58:14.880
you guys already know what it is. So, yeah, hey, the ones that you see that you've already,

58:14.880 --> 58:19.120
that you know are in the game, they are totally in the game. Alright, the ones that are in

58:19.120 --> 58:22.720
the game, they are definitely in the game. So we have on there, simply being loved, which

58:22.720 --> 58:26.800
we know is in the game, diving, we know that's in the game, right on time. I don't think

58:26.800 --> 58:30.280
we ever figured out what that one was did we don't know about that one come

58:30.280 --> 58:34.680
into my world which makes me think of the Kylie Minogue song Euro mix I think

58:34.680 --> 58:40.760
from okay okay enjoy the silence I don't know hmm go west okay we knew the pet

58:40.760 --> 58:45.240
shot that got announced the pet shop boys yes locomotion another Kylie song

58:45.240 --> 58:50.200
there we go unless it's the original which possibly one more time I think

58:50.200 --> 58:54.920
about the Daft Punk song possibly but we haven't we don't know we don't know if

58:54.920 --> 58:57.340
it's in DDR now we don't know we're just going off what was on that master

58:57.340 --> 59:01.820
list planet rock that did turn up in extreme we do know that the boys of

59:01.820 --> 59:06.580
summer DJ Sammy song we had heaven and max 2 we thought we'd get an extreme

59:06.580 --> 59:10.060
because it was on this list but I haven't heard about it yet

59:10.060 --> 59:13.900
Humpty dance they're saying was possibly something that was coming over from

59:13.900 --> 59:23.380
Xbox don't know and Mickey so we don't know don't know but but what we do know

59:23.380 --> 59:28.760
is that in our chat room it was said by one of our folk I think was Mel B over

59:28.760 --> 59:32.520
DDR spot did say hey guess what guys if you're trying to find the list to

59:32.520 --> 59:37.660
Ultramix 2 which has I think he said 46 I'm sorry I'm gonna look for what he

59:37.660 --> 59:43.120
said where is it I don't know what he said it was something like 46 more songs

59:43.120 --> 59:49.240
that have not been in DDR before is it 56 okay 56 56 more songs have not been

59:49.240 --> 59:55.880
in DDR before, and none of them are on that master list, so don't even bother looking,

59:55.880 --> 59:58.160
because they're not on there, so forget it.

59:58.160 --> 59:59.160
Nice.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.080
Of course he could be just throwing us off.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080
Is that a hint?

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080
Is that a hint?

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080
That's true.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.080
Are you guys dropping a hint?

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.080
Is that a hint?

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.080
It sounds like a hint to me.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.080
Is that 56 mean something?

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.080
If you flip the 6 upside down, it's a 9.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.080
Maybe it's a Japanese character.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.080
Well, here's the thing.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.440
Here's the thing about that.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.960
There's been a big, huge span between when Party Collection came out and when these new

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.400
new mixes are coming out. So obviously, you know, there's gonna be a lot of stuff that's

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.920
not on there. And I mean, there's a lot of stuff, you know, that would be on there. This

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.280
is just stuff that they were developing a while back. So there's a lot of be- a lot

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.760
of work being done right now on it, so. It's not surprising that there's not a lot on there,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:37.280
but. There's some other ones that were not licensed songs that were on the master list

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:44.200
that I've heard that might be in there. So, um, I'm not saying anything, but, uh, there

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.640
There was stuff that we knew about a long time ago, and I think I even quoted on the

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:55.300
show scene what the songs were a long time ago, but, you know, I can't see now because

01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.320
my balls are tied, so, you know, I just, I cannot say anything.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320
But that's it.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320
Alright.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:08.880
I feel like doing another tease, what do you guys think?

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.880
Let's do another tease.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.880
Let's tease them again.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880
Let's do it.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.880
We're gonna do it soon, you guys. We have to make this last, alright?

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.880
We only get to have fun like this, what, once every 106 shows?

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.880
You guys won't listen to us otherwise, so we have to tease it now.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.880
And you know, after he plays,

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.880
I'll probably get to have this little one-on-one chat with him,

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.880
so if you guys are just sticking around for the Urine remix,

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.880
you might miss out on some other stuff.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.880
I want to chat with you first. I want to get that stuff over with because I have to get something out there.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.880
Man, I've got to set some people straight.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.880
Then forget what I said. You guys can leave right after that song plays.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.880
Or no you can't.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.880
Alright, hold on. Let's tease.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880
Okay, that's enough.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.880
That was pretty sexy. I like that.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.880
That was very sexy.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.880
It sounded like you touched my something. Yeah.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:17.880
Oh yeah, I think she said boob. I think she said boob. How many DDR's are going to love that? You touch my boob.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:24.880
For everyone that enjoyed our pre-show, we had porn on the webcam, but no one seemed- I don't know if anyone paid attention to that.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.880
I knew I should have got here earlier.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.880
Alright, we will get to it soon, but first, I want to talk to our buddy Seagert.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.880
Do you want to go to commercial first? Alright, Sigurd wants to go to commercial first so we can...

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.880
You're gonna... You're pissing off the chat room.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.880
Tough.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.880
Alright. When we get back, we're gonna talk to Sigurd. We're also gonna do some Bamani match game tonight.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.880
And then, maybe we'll do the song, but maybe we'll have a cage match before that. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.880
It depends what time we're at. We'll have a look. I don't know. God, some people are gonna kick our ass if we don't do it soon.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:08.660

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
You're almost not gonna live or die

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I cannot lie, I'm a killer

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.500
I am a sick and gay girl

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500
I cannot lie, I'm a killer

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:37.000
I am a sick and gay girl

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Oh

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:39.440
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.000
the new programming coming to orange lounge radio

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.520
uh... jamie i have a suggestion about some of the music in arab amani music

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:51.220
and more program can we talk about that no subject will ever be taboo

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:55.320
well i was thinking maybe we should move pump up the volume from tuesday night

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.320
except of course the subject that was just under discussion

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.720
okay well

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.320
what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.200
station

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.520
i collect your fucking head

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.120
Just like this fucker here.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.020
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.720
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.520
Now if any of you sons of bitches

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.020

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.120
NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:30.020
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.720
Welcome back, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.460
and you know I have to say I'm I'm if you haven't figured it out I'm I'm kind

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:43.340
of reading the DDR freak threat on extreme during the show and about the

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:48.320
last four pages have been people talking about this show and it's really starting

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:54.760
to piss some of you your moderators off but it's okay you're contributing to the

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.380
problem yeah you're contributing but no it's it's all good you guys it's all in

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:03.260
good fun long good fun but yeah guys we do have our own chat room and it's over

01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:09.620
So please, you know, you guys can talk on that thread after the show, but some of the

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:17.300
moderators over there aren't exactly happy cappers right now because you guys have hijacked

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.260
the thread, so please steer things back on course.

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:23.480
We do have forums of our own, nobody posts there, but hey, you know, you could be a trend

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.480
setter.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:37.080
Yes. No, maybe later. All right. Moving on. Let's see. I said I wanted to talk to Seagurd,

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:44.040
so let's talk to Seagurd. Yes, Logan. You said moving on. That was another song in DDR.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:50.420
Could it be? Again, I don't know shit about what is going to be in Extreme or Ultramix

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:57.420
or anything down the line. Even if I did know, I don't know as far as you're concerned, okay?

01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:04.980
That's it, alright? Alright. Moving on. Again. Uh, Secret, how are you? I'm doing pretty

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:10.300
good. Alright, so, no secret now, you're a vivid member on The Freak. That I am. So that

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:17.940
must mean I work for Konami. And what exactly do you do at Konami? I go to work for Konami.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:18.940
That's what I do.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.500
Are you allowed to talk about what you do there?

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.500
You know what?

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.700
I have no clue, and since I have no clue, I'm gonna say I work for Konami.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.940
Okay, alright, fine.

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:26.940
Fair enough.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:27.940
Alright.

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:28.940
But, um...

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:29.940
Well, you make a lot of money, right?

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.940
So you must be doing...

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:31.940
No, I'm kidding.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:32.940
I wish I made a lot of money.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.940
Alright, so fine.

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.540
We can talk about what you do, but you do have to come in contact with DDR Games at

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.100
some point through your job.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.940
That's why I have the vivid membership.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.260
Alright, alright, fine.

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.780
No, okay, let's talk about life before Konami then.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:46.780
Okay.

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.180
Are you getting a backstory?

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:52.060
Yeah, but you've been on the show before, but nobody was listening then, but now people

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.060
care tonight.

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:54.060
Nobody cared then.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:56.420
People seem to care tonight, suddenly, about this show for some reason.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.060
I can't, for the life of me, imagine why.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.060
I don't know why.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.020
What exactly were you doing before Konami?

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:04.980
I worked for E.V. Games back in Kansas.

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:05.980
That's right.

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:12.800
I'm from the Midwest, so yeah, I worked there, and then I came out here.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.540
The end, I guess.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.320
What possessed you to come out here?

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.440
I had been wanting to move out here for a while, like, I'm originally way long time

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:27.960
ago from here, but, um, yeah, I moved to Kansas, then I decided, hey, Kansas kind of sucks.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.360
Because it really does.

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.880
Um, so I moved out here.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.360
Alright, fair enough.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.360
Yeah.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.440
And how, now, I don't know how much you can or can't say about this, but how did you get

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.440
the job at Konami?

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.800
Because a lot of people want to know this, like, oh, I want to work in a video game,

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.440
I want to play video games all day.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:47.520
How do you get, and I'm sure that's exactly how you would describe some of the jobs there,

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.520
right?

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.880
Yeah, sure, right.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.720
How exactly did you get the job at Konami?

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.820
I applied.

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.960
And who did you have to blow?

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960
Pretty much everybody.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:01.760
No, seriously, how did you manage to get it?

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:02.760
I applied.

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:08.680
You know, it's not like Konami is a huge secretive company.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:13.360
go to their website and you know what, sometimes they have job offers and sometimes they don't.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:18.720
If you look, you might be able to catch one of them when they do. So, uh, that's pretty

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.720
much how it works.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.160
Alright, so you went to a company and you applied and, and, and who knew it? They hired

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.160
you.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.160
Exactly. What were they thinking?

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.840
They obviously don't know me.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.640
Now, since you do come in contact with some DDR games, you guys like to have a little

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.520
fun on some of the big message boards. Of course, the biggest one that comes to mind,

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.520
the free, right?

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.520
The free, yeah.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.720
posted lately in the thread, and what do you hope to gain from posting in this thread?

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:51.600
I hope to gain just pretty much some laughter, because that's what I've been getting.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:56.560
And I think what it's really doing is creating a lot of hype for the game.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:02.640
And if you had been on the DDR Freak boards, gosh, maybe before Friday, because that's

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.880
when we all started coming into contact with the boards.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.800
It was really not a very happy place, but you know what?

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.380
I think everybody's starting to realize, you know, this is DDR.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.840
This is why we're here, and we're going to enjoy it.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.800
So, I mean, people seem to be having fun again instead of just complaining.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.800
Yeah, that's good.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.840
Yeah, I noticed people were having fun with it.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.840
Especially all the photoshops.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.880
Oh my God, the photoshops.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.880
You were just in the bathroom.

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:33.880
I'm sorry.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880
Look at this.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.880
Look at this.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:39.880
Dark Sakura kicks our guest from Konami out of the chair so she can sit down, it's beautiful.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.880
Alright.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.880
She's motioning for Seeker to come sit down. I think you should go sit on her lap.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.880
Yeah, I would, but you might punch me.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.880
Seeker's afraid of being punched by Dark Sakura. Come on, Dark Sakura loves you.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.880
Dark Sakura, tell him you love him.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.880
Like a hole in the head.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.880
Alright.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:03.880
I love you.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.880
So back to the thread.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.880
One thing first.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:13.880
Okay, now if you've been following DDRFreakThread, which I'm sure you have,

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.880
you know, DNL has all these fanboys.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.880
Where's my fanboys? I want fanboys.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.880
I don't want fangirls, I want fanboys.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.880
Oh, I see.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.880
So, come on, step it up.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.880
You and I have something in common, I see.

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:28.880
Alright.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.880
And if you've listened to this show for the past 105 episodes, you know what I'm talking about.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.520
you that are just listening tonight, I don't feel like telling it again. So, you'll just

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:43.400
have to be in the dark. So, yeah, anyway, well, DDR Freakboards, what were you talking

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:48.640
about? Yeah, DDR Freakboards. This thing, it happens every time there's a new mix. Every

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:54.420
time there's a new mix. The first mix, Conomics, all the way back there to DDR Max, Max 2,

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:58.920
there's this thing called Hints. And we all know that a while back, Jason Enos, like back

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:02.760
during comic stage, used to come on the thread and drop hints about what was going on, and

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.760
and then, you know, some other folks picked up the slack for some of the later games.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.760
Yeah, Dantrex, Cryptic...

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.760
Some folks you guys don't even know, right?

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.760
Exactly.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.760
Even you work there and you don't know who they are.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.760
Exactly.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760
Exactly.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:13.760
So...

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.360
Because if we knew who they were, they'd probably have a Vivid foot next to their name.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.760
So now it comes to the point where you post, as a Vivid member, not just any Vivid member,

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.760
but one that works for Konami, you post anything and somebody assumes it's a hint.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:27.760
Yes.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.760
It is a...

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.760
It has to be a hint.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.760
You must be talking about a new song.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.760
Exactly.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.240
is what you want to do more than anything is spoiled your NDA and...

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.080
Yes, I really want to get fired. I mean, these people...

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.880
I'm glad they're picking up on that. Alright, so

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.240
how many hints have you posted in the DDR Freak thread thus far?

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.600
DDR Freak listeners, we

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.040
as a collective group have posted exactly

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.920
zero hints. Zero hints! But, but,

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.280
maybe that was a hint. No, no, seriously.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.280
No. Oh, 01 was in seventh style. He was the, oh my gosh, oh my gosh you guys, 01's in it.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.280
But, yeah, I mean, I posted this earlier on the thread, you know.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.280
But it was ignored.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.280
Of course. I don't know why. I have a flashy foot by my name. Listen to me.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:25.280
So wait, but I seem to recall that one of the other folks over there posted a picture, and it had, like, a party collection bucket.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.280
And, like, a Max 2 thing. It had, like, extreme samplers there.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.600
And, oh, would you hold up the extreme sampler for the camera? Can you do that?

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.320
Somebody else can, or I guess I can.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.560
Yeah, we'll have, we'll have to see. I'll do it during the break.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.360
Yeah, we'll do it during the break.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.320
We'll do it during the break.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.680
Because it's like way over by the camera, and I don't feel like going by the camera.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.320
Well you can hold that.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.480
Yeah, hold that, that's the same size.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.440
That's not it, that's something else.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.320
It's close enough.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:49.840
All right.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.080
Um, but yeah, that picture.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.240
Is that a porno you're holding up, or what?

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.880
A Fahrenheit 9-11.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.680
No, that picture, you know, with the party collection bucket and all that, it was the

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.200
picture with the party collection bucket and whatever else.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.000
I said it has nothing to do with anything.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It's the v-rare.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.500
So, wait a minute.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:19.380
So that picture with the party collection and the tip jar and everything, that's basically

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:22.960
just you guys showing off that you have a humongous internet penis right now and you're

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.320
not afraid to whip it out.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.320
Exactly.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.320
Yeah.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.320
Okay.

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.320
We're very family oriented.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.080
So, the picture meant nothing. There are no hidden clues in that picture.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.400
As a friend, you're swearing to me there is no hidden meaning in that picture,

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:40.160
because we go way back. We go way back.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.360
Oh, you are holding it up?

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.040
Stop it! Now you're even fucking with me. Alright.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.320
I swear that there were no hints.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.920
Now granted, you guys can't see me, so I could be crossing my fingers.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.200
Oh, stop.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.920
I said, I said on the boards, you guys will figure out when we are actually giving hints.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:04.080
If I say we're not, we probably aren't.

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.540
If I say we aren't, we could be.

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:07.540
That's what keeps it fun.

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:10.380
Alright, but seriously, there's no hints.

01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:13.300
Seriously, in that picture, there are no hints.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.640
When the hints start, you guys will know, right?

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.100
When the hints start, you will know.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.100
And does that mean you're going to give us a hint tonight?

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.100
No.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.100
Right.

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.100
No.

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.100
No.

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.100
No.

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.100
I'm sorry guys.

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:28.660
but because there are these things called the dawn disclosure agreements he can only

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:31.780
say what he's allowed to say and we're not allowed to say anything else but you know

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:36.500
what we got the song and that's enough for me right now that's more than enough so certainly

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:40.900
we can't give out any more hints certainly I couldn't give out anything else because

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:46.300
I don't know what the hell else is in the game but uh so apparently there's porn in

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:52.980
this mix oh was that a hint that could have been a hint is it erotic oh my god oh my god

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:56.060
products in it oh my gosh

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:57.340
yeah

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:01.540
it was yeah yeah it wasn't it was funny diversified still funny if you guys

01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:05.460
want to read into what we say go ahead it might pay off it might not

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.020
I mean your speculation

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:09.340
seems to run the gamut of everything

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.380
so you might hit something randomly of course we're not going to tell you if

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.860
you're right but you might be keep those photoshops coming though especially the

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:17.140
ones of see your

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:21.180
thankfully all I did was like my neck is in there if you can photoshop my neck

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:25.320
more power to you just you guys know i didn't even and and i've known

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:28.660
chain for a while now and we don't mind those down

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.020
i've known him for a while now a little while now i don't we don't go away back

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:35.900
but you know i'm a little early sleep here too too

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.120
but um...

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.420
i did not know it was him i was reading through and i'm like who's that guy

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.420
and i didn't realize it was him

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.700
that's how secretive you've been being a i didn't even know we should have

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.580
thought as being simple you know me

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:51.180
There's two dead giveaways. One, I talked about my hair in the picture.

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.980
I always talk about my hair, because I love it.

01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:57.380
Um, two, I said Sadness. That's another trademarked meme.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:00.380
Yes, Sadness I should have known.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:01.980
I should have known.

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:04.840
Alright.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:09.380
Okay guys, I think what we're going to do now is I think we're going to take like one

01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:12.460
like quick break here, and then I think we're going to do a Maimani match game maybe.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:14.680
Let's do the cage match now actually.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.760
Let's do that.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.520
Let's drag this out as long as possible here.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:25.560
Anything else you want to say to your adoring fanboys and possible fangirls out there, Seagrid?

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:33.520
Just keep reading and we'll be posting stuff as we normally do, and love me, please.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.600
So show Seagrid a little more love, and maybe he'll start dropping those hints later,

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.160
if you'll show him some love.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:46.240
Okay, as soon as I queue it up here, we're going to get into the Orange Launch Radio cage match.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:49.480
the cage match for you guys that have never participated before you need to be

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:54.040
in our chat room w w w dot orange on twitter dot com click on chat

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.480
always in their completeness because there's so many new people i'm actually

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.840
thinking i think we are at this is a so many new people i think we are to make

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.420
an exception tonight and play the entirety

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:05.800
winner from last week is is a really good song

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.800
mean either way why not

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.240
so we're gonna do that we're gonna be special because it was low keys where

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:10.880
anyway

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.020
the way to match works we pick three songs he chose the song

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.860
And they're usually big dance hits or guitar hits or something.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.420
They're kind of songs that we think make good Bamani selections, or we just think

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.560
they're really cool and we want to play them for you guys.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.980
You guys vote. Or we want to torture you sometimes. Sometimes we want to torture you, like when

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:29.500
Jamie brings J-Lo. I should have picked Britney Spears this week. Or Britney.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.860
But the thing is, you're going to pick your favorite of the three songs, and that winning

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:35.400
song goes into rotation all week long

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.100
here on Orange Lounge Radio. So there's definitely a prize to be won here.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.880
Now, last week's winner is actually pretty cool because it's a remix done by

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.720
our very own Loki and he remixed this song you might know it from DDR called

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:52.400
ecstasy and it is an excellent remix it's won two weeks now and if it wins

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.160
for four we're gonna have to retire it so it's halfway there let's see if it

01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:01.640
adds one more week on but oh yeah I gotta have the cage match music huh all

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:10.240
right last week in the orange launch radio cage match oh all right last week

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.020
nora's ontario cage match loki one with his pick it's uh... ecstasy and what did

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.100
you read it this with your business

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:19.860
explain what a match mix is real fast

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.780
well i think if you're looking for most of the stuff that's out there it's

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.540
crap but uh...

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:28.300
no matter if it's just basically just uh... taking two songs

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:30.060
not necessarily going down

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:33.500
you're basically cutting loops and you know remixing it that way with loops

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.920
but probably for a lot of people is that

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:39.820
really bad rap because you know people to throw one song on top of it another

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.780
you're basically making it goldway

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.300
it's not like other crap though

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:50.460
hopefully you know that that's a little bit better than

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.700
this song should be in the art and the story i think they think that's going to

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.980
be in the air

01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.300
and that's okay

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:01.420
but anyway if you have to be mixed with uh... back home

01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:05.100
fred's art that got into the whole job in the first place uh...

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.140
comfy

01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:08.540
uh... with himself working hard to get here

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:12.700
one of the only two songs he's ever done the other one team level coming

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:16.380
he was pretty popular back in the end of uh... the nineties beginning two

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:18.500
thousand and he did that

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:22.660
generally make anything anymore just the remixes but uh... you'll take a quick

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.580
deal a lot with the citizens and uh...

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.820
came uh... and also you know

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.420
stuff on the fact that john

01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:30.980
something that uh...

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:33.300
he kind of a drug actually

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:40.300
All right, here it is. Less talking, more playing. Here it is, a Tomski versus D complex with ecstasy, 14 hours club mix. Enjoy.

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:46.180
All right, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match, Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.

01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:50.020
And I think it's hilarious, because the people who can't hear the show right now are just

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:52.700
in our chat room, and they can only see what we're posting.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.260
And I posted, you know, as I always do every week when we play the Cage Match songs, I

01:30:56.260 --> 01:31:00.460
posted, song one, Ecstasy, 14 Hours Club Mix, and somebody's like, oh my god, they're announcing

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:01.460
the song list!

01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:10.460
No, that is not a song. It's going to be extreme. It's a fan song and it's song number one you can vote for tonight.

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:15.460
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is brought to us by Dark Zachrow. What did you pick tonight?

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:18.460
I picked something by someone.

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:22.460
Do you remember what you picked or do you need a reminder?

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:31.460
I know what it takes. Oh yeah, M-Flow with the... move. Oh yeah, Astro Sexy.

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:36.460
Alright. M-Flow is awesome. M-Flow is in DDR. Yes, M-Flow is in DDR.

01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:45.460
Alright. M-Flow with Astro Sexy, song number two in tonight's cage match. And if you like this, you can vote for it after we're all done here. Enjoy.

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:45.960
Enjoy!

Spanish

01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:29.760
and flow chemistry

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.780
you know what I'm saying

01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:32.620
it's a global astro alliance

01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:30.100
Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, M-Flow with Astro Sexy, and now

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:32.720
we're gonna go around and see what everybody thought of that take out the

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.240
inner Simon Cowell in us Jamie I love them flow now the whole I have to say

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:40.820
there's a whole CD all together it's not a great that has some awesome tracks on

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:44.800
it and that one it just it keeps getting interesting it keeps changing it up as

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:48.700
the song goes on so it's a real progression through the whole song and I

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:51.880
really love it so I'd have to say that wouldn't get you 10 it's not talked to

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.820
Not taco yet, but you know it still gets a 10. All right, uh angel

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.960
All right, um

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.360
I don't know to me. It sounded like

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:09.040
Half the time kind of dancey. So I really liked it. I say

01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.720
9.8

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:19.520
Cuz I don't know why I'm going to do that, but I guess it's because I can all right. Yeah

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:31.480
I don't even know

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:38.480
As far as the progression, I liked that. I thought it was interesting. I was like, what's going on here?

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:45.480
Because I could tell something was changing in the song. And it's definitely got that, what do you say, that punkishness.

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:53.480
I was thinking of Move Your Feet, that those guys too. So, yeah. Yeah. You're seeing here.

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:58.480
So I'd have to give it like, maybe a 7. A good song, but not my style.

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:04.440
out. Alright, good song. 7. T-gird, um, what's your name?

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:08.960
Cage Match? That's what we're doing? Yeah, were you even listening to Mplo? Yeah, cause

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:14.120
I remember commenting on it. Alright. Um, I've heard that song, I really like it. It

01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:23.120
gets a 9. Alright. Is it going to be in DDR? Maybe. Alright, lowkey. That was awesome,

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.120
I love it.

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.760
Yeah, you know, it wasn't that bad.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:30.040
Usually I'm kind of am with Mplo, but that was fun.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.040
I give it an eight.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.040
I give it an eight.

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.040
Fun, fun, good eight.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.040
All right.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.040
Our other voters in this vote.

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.040
That's right.

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.040
You know what?

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:38.120
We're not the ones who depict the winner.

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.800
You guys do out there in Listerland, and I'm sure you have nothing better to do while waiting

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.120
for your reign, which we will get to like in like 15 minutes.

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.880
We will make sure that you vote.

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.160
The more votes, the faster we'll get there.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.480
No, we'll get it.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:54.480
Alright, one more song. Let's get to the last song, then.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:00.480
My song, my pick this week is a group you also know from DDR, Four Strings.

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.480
And they have a brand new single, and it's called Turn It Around.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:06.480
And so that's going to be my pick for the night. So enjoy.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.480
This is Four Strings, so turn it around.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:15.480
Turn it around baby, spend more time with me

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:22.480
Try to believe you, try to believe you

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:29.480
Turn it around baby, spend more time with me

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:36.480
It's getting insane I know, let it not be true

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.480
Turn it around baby

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:47.480
Turn it around

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:54.480
I need you

01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:01.480
I can only be myself with you

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:07.480
I can only be myself

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:32.360
Turn it around, turn it around

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:59.860
Turn it around, turn it around

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:05.860
Turn it around baby, let us break the rules

01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:12.860
You know I need you, I need to feel you

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:19.860
Turn it around baby, and find me

01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:26.860
Waiting for you babe, only for you babe

01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:31.860
I need you

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:38.860
I can only be myself with you

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:44.860
I can only be myself

01:42:44.860 --> 01:43:08.860
Turn it around, turn it around

01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:36.860
Turn it around, turn it around.

01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:38.860
Come on, baby

01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:12.580
trans compilation. I'm just sort of transed out of it. I mean, I've been listening to

01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:16.540
a lot of trans lately because when I'm writing my stories it's easier to listen to trans

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:20.180
while I'm writing. It was very good though. I love Four Strings. I'd have to give it about

01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:21.860
an eight and a half.

01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:26.700
Alright. Andrew, what did you think of that one? Pirate. Our local pirate. Oh, he didn't

01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.340
vote on the last one. Oh, he's gone. That's alright.

01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:33.100
Yeah, I've been in the bathroom for like the past three songs. I have no idea what's going

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:44.220
on okay that's fine uh angel i'm stuck okay hi um jeez i'd probably stay an eight because

01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:49.580
i don't know i like the trans teenage i could probably i'm gonna go into this club and

01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:56.300
i have no idea where i'm going with this never mind all right on 110 oh i'm sorry i missed that

01:44:56.300 --> 01:45:08.300
Hey, I like it a lot. I'm into trance. Uplifting trance is kind of a newer, happier kind of thing that's going on.

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:16.300
So for uplifting, I guess, I think it categorizes that anyway. It's pretty good. I give it a 9. I'm into darker trance, but it's good.

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:18.300
Okay, sounds good. Uh, Seagurd.

01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:24.300
Um, I heard that song earlier today, and I really don't like it, I'm sorry.

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:29.300
Nausicaa is diving, which might be on Xtreme! Except it's already been announced, so yeah.

01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:32.300
I think it is on Xtreme, Seagurd. Even I do that, and I don't work for him.

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.300
Um, yeah, I give it a 4.

01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:38.300
Aw, you suck. Alright, that's fine. Loki.

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:43.300
I don't know, it was pretty good, but not as good as that trance remix that's on DDR Extreme.

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:49.620
are extreme oh oh of another song another song there will be a trance

01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:59.500
remix of another song a word I'm gonna give that a I can't do that if it's

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:06.860
that'd be too obvious I'm gonna give that seven all right I I think it's

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:10.540
really a great song even though it is a little bit repetitive but I love it

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:19.540
9. Is that a 9 in the German sense? 9!

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:25.540

close them. No. Don't have anything going. Alright. You're very spotty right now, though.

01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:19.180
make sure, uh, you okay? Can you hear me fine? Ah, we lost him. Ah, we lost him. That's a

01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:23.460
bummer. Alright, I'll try it one more time. We'll see if we can get somebody in here.

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:27.180
That's what happens when you get the, oh, we'll try it one more time, same person. Hi,

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:32.040
you're on the radio. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you now. Okay, good. I think because

01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.580
I am on, I was dropping out. Who is this? There you go, this is Richie. Hi, Richie.

01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:37.980
Hey Rich, how ya doin'?

01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:42.260
Hey people, um, just wanna give out a few things about, uh, Xtreme.

01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:46.540
Um, I'm pretty excited for it to come out here to the U.S.

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:51.040
Um, just gonna, like, check out the whole, uh, new iToy support, whatever they're gonna have for it.

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:56.340
Um, but the main thing I'm mainly excited about is, uh, bringing Love Love Sugar to the U.S., so...

01:49:56.340 --> 01:50:00.340
I, I heard about Love Love Sugar. Yes, I know.

01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:03.940
Now, now, now the greatness of N.O.R.E.A. shall be spread throughout this country.

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:11.940
Okay, I'm not ashamed to admit it. I am a Noria fanboy. I want her to have my children.

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:24.940
Richie, do you have anything you want to say to us for withholding on this Your Rain thing for like two hours now for some people? Are we jerks, or is this what you'd expect from us?

01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:32.940
Well, I mean, just be patient, you know. I mean, just because, like, you know, we're going to review the song doesn't even want to play it right at the beginning of the show.

01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:45.940
And for the people who, you know, keep asking us to drop hints about what songs are going to be on Extreme or what new songs, you know, they can't say anything. It's the same thing, disclosure thing that they have.

01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:49.940
So basically, you're saying, you know what, there's a reason you're not getting hints yet.

01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:54.940
Yeah, there's rules. The man. It's the man. Blame it on the man.

01:50:54.940 --> 01:51:00.940
I know. All I have to say is, they'll tell you when they can tell you. So, you know, just wait up. We'll be good.

01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:02.940
Good things come to people who wait.

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:06.940
Alright. Alright, well thanks for calling. Have a good one.

01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:07.940
Bye.

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.940
That was fun. I'm glad to hear from him.

01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:14.940
We'll see. I'll give the other folks a chance to call just a minute here.

01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:24.940
So, yeah, we're gonna do that debut of your reign, and then we'll go to the Mani Match Game.

01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:29.940
I think we haven't done that in a while, so I want to get to that, and then we're gonna go to the FUs of the Week.

01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:34.940
We're gonna have to kind of make it fast this week, though, so we may have to limit our chatroom FUs, especially with so many people listening.

01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:37.940
We are going to guard our angst for you.

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:41.380
Again, if you guys have friends that are trying to get in and listen to the show and they

01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:46.780
can't get in right now, we will play the song again after the show at 9.40 and there might

01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:51.860
be other surprises too at that time, so stay tuned and we'll get that for you after the

01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:52.860
show.

01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:55.740
For anyone listening in the chat room, please make an announcement for us that we will be

01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:57.380
playing the song again after the show.

01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:01.040
Alright, yes, we'll play it again at 9.40 so those that weren't able to get in now can

01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:02.040
get in.

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:05.320
Alright, nobody else is calling on Skype line so I think maybe it's about time for us to

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:06.320
get to it.

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:09.920
You've waited long enough. Yeah, you guys have waited long enough, but

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:13.240
but first I want to just give some

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:16.840
shout outs about this because I do definitely want to thank the folks at

01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:18.200
ddrspot.com

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.520
I haven't said their name enough tonight, but they have helped us out in getting this

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.800
premiere for you guys. Thank you very much to the staff at ddrspot.com

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.040
also the KDEA team has been very helpful

01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:32.360
some of our folks at Konami. So Seegard, give them big kisses and

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.280
hugs for us here at Orange Lounge for getting this for us.

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:43.240
Alright, and just thanks a lot to you guys because, you know, it helped us get a lot

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.240
of exposure.

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:48.520
We've been doing this radio show for about two years now, and some folks are just finding

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.580
out about us tonight, even though we've been doing it for two years.

01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:51.580
And you know what?

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:55.340
It may not be your cup of tea, but hey, thanks for checking us out, but if you did like us,

01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:57.160
we do the same shit every week.

01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.160
And you know what?

01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.160
Every Sunday we do our talks.

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:02.720
Some weeks we don't have a song to be teasing, so it's even crazier.

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:06.040
Thank God you weren't here for the show where I sang, okay?

01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:07.640
That was bad enough.

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:08.640
You're staying in?

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:12.120
We do have karaoke revolution 2, we've still got a cover at some point.

01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:13.120
No!

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.120
Alright, alright.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:19.160
But seriously, also keep in mind we've got our remix show on Monday, Diversion, which

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:23.040
Rob is gracious and has fun with.

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:27.380
And then my show is on Tuesday, where if you're hanging out in our chat room, then whatever

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:30.820
you request, Bemani or not, if I have it, I'll play it, and you can even send it to

01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:34.240
me if you really want to hear it broadcast on the show, as long as I don't think it's

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.240
a piece of crap.

01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:38.240
I'm flexible. Don't suck, I'll play it.

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.240
Maybe you'll play your rain again.

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.240
Maybe.

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.240
Maybe we can work that out.

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.240
Maybe.

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:48.240
And then Wednesday, coming back very soon, Vanilla Sky, my show where we talk about random video game stuff.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:54.240
We just have to retool it a little bit. But hopefully soon. I might do something this week, we'll see. I don't know.

01:53:54.240 --> 01:54:01.240
And maybe, sometime in the future, I'll do my show.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:02.240
Alright.

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:17.240
That's a very, very, very, um, there's a.5 chance, you know, somewhere around the 99 area that, cut it out, cut it out.

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:26.240
Alright, anything else anybody wants to say before we do? This is our big moment you guys, we're never going to have this captive audience ever again, so anybody want to say anything?

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.240
I have an important announcement.

01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.240
Yes.

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.240
I like alcohol.

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.240
Does anybody need to come out of the closet here on the show?

01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:40.240
Loki is actually running in the closet.

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:41.240
Alright.

01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:44.240
Um, yeah, I have something.

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:45.240
Rob?

01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.240
Yes.

01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:47.240
Rob?

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:48.240
What?

01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.240
Rob?

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:50.240
What?

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.240
Rob?

01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:52.240
What?

01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:53.240
Rob?

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.240
What?

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.240
What?

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240
We are forgetting the something.

01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.240
Oh Jesus.

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.240
That was scary.

01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.240
It was in unison.

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:00.240
They're getting restless.

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.240
They're about to punch us in the face.

01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.240
Alright, alright, here we go.

01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:10.240
Forget it, forget it, alright.

01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:12.240
I love you.

01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.240
Alright, you guys ready?

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:15.240
I'm ready.

01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:16.240
You ready to hear this?

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:17.240
Are we ready?

01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.240
Alright.

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:23.240
Alright, we are going to do right now the world debut of Your Rain, The Rage Mix.

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:25.240
So enjoy everybody.

01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:35.240
Your Rain, The Rage Mix made possible by www.orangeloundsradio.com and www.drspot.com. Enjoy!

01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:06.240
Out of my head, and I don't know what I found

01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:17.240
Over and over, I fear to break me down

01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:27.240
I'm waiting for a gentle wind, a gentle wind, a gentle wind

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:32.240
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets, just a whisper

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:37.240
Busy people, going nowhere, seeing dark in the rain

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:42.240
Nothing but passion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.240
Rain in like a flower in a basement waiting for our love

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:52.240
Yeah

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:57.240
Orange Lounge Radio brings you a world premiere of Your Rain, the Rage Mix

01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:58.240
What'd you guys think?

01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.240
That was sexy!

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:05.240
I can't believe people have been waiting like two and a half hours for that one minute song

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:09.240
But there it is, it's actually a minute twenty-nine is what that song clocks in as

01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.240
What'd you guys think? Dark Sakura?

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:13.240
It was sexy, I still like the original better, but it was sexy.

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:15.240
It was hot.

01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.240
It was very hot.

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:19.240
It was hot. It's like, slow.

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:24.240
It's my favorite Akira song, hands down. It's my favorite Yamaoka song, hands down.

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:26.240
Cool.

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.240
Yeah, I agree.

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:35.240
What did you guys think? Andrew, you haven't really been, I don't know how much you've been following this fandom, or how big a DDR fanboy you are, but what did you think of that?

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:36.240
What did you think of that?

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:37.520
Well, I like that song.

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.500
I think it's going to be pretty interesting to play.

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:44.000
It sounds slow as hell, so I'm definitely going to have to bar rape that at 5x or something

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000
when I play that.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.920
Or excuse me, chair rape that at home, I guess.

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:51.960
But yeah, that sounds pretty good.

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:52.960
I like that.

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:53.960
It sounds interesting.

01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:54.960
Alright.

01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:55.960
Angel.

01:57:55.960 --> 01:58:00.800
Yeah, like he just said, I'm totally going to have to speed mod that, because I really

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.840
suck at slow songs.

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.840
Well, I speed mod. I don't know if that makes me a loser or not, though.

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:12.840
Since I call myself DDR Angel, maybe I shouldn't speed mod anymore.

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:14.840
Okay, I'm not funny.

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:20.840
I can see Wendell freestyling to this right now.

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:23.840
It's a very freestylable song.

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:28.840
I can see the butt shots and the kisses and everything.

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:33.840
The video was great. We were able to actually see the video at E3 and play the song and the steps.

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.840
The steps were pretty good, I gotta say. I think it was only like a six, but it was fun.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:41.840
The video, they made a custom video for it based around Silent Hill characters.

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:43.840
And I gotta say, you guys, if you haven't looked at our picture gallery...

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:44.840
It was a good video.

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:48.840
Look at the picture gallery on our website. Just sign up for our website. It's free. We don't send you spam.

01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:52.840
Sign up for the website, and there's pictures. Dark Sakura has a gallery. I have a gallery.

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:57.840
And Seagurd even has a gallery on there. It says Mikolatov, but it's actually Seagurd's photo gallery.

01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:59.840
All these pictures from E3.

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:03.840
Also, just to expand upon the video information.

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:08.840
In the video, you'll see Cynthia from Silent Hill 4 and Henry from Silent Hill 4.

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:12.840
And then some backup dancers, and they are not in Silent Hill 4.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:15.840
There is no dancing in Silent Hill 4.

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.840
Alright.

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:22.840
Unless you count writhing as dancing around when you're being eaten to death.

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:27.840
I've actually seen this song, the video for the song, in a lot of these preview videos.

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:31.140
I do wish, though, that they were dancing in Silent Hill, because then I could have

01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:32.140
Pyramid Head dance.

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:35.080
That'd be the best thing ever.

01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:36.080
All right.

01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:37.080
Those of you guys...

01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:39.400
I would like to see the disembodied heads in the wheelchairs dance.

01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:41.920
I know some of you guys are probably dropping the stream right now, so I just wanted to

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:44.840
say to you guys that, later the two hours later, hey, check us out again sometime.

01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:48.520
I hope you guys enjoyed it, and check us out again sometime, and thanks for stopping by

01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:49.520
Orange Orange Radio.

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:50.520
Because we're beautiful people.

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.520
The show's not done.

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:56.020
I know there's some people that didn't want to have to sit through all this to hear that song, but you did, so thank you.

01:59:56.020 --> 02:00:04.020
What does our resident arcade building genius think of it? Because we didn't ask his opinion.

02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:06.020
Yeah, what did you think, Loki?

02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:08.020
Eh.

02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:18.020
You know, I think, you know, it's nice that Akira Yamaoka's doing songs and remixing them for DDR, but eh.

02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:23.620
I don't care for that stupid fucking, um, was it, just shit?

02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:28.220
Um, I don't know, I don't care for that R&B crap that they have right there.

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:34.620
Um, you know, give me a good, um, a Kiriyamaoka hard, um, heavy metal fucking track from Contra.

02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:36.820
That's the shit that I want in DDR.

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:41.620
You know, fucking hard heavy metal guitars yelling, screaming, none of this.

02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:47.220
I'm a survivor! I'm a survivor! Like, give me dancing! I'm a remix of a song!

02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:53.220
It's really stupid. I want the heavy metal. I mean, that's the shit that I want in there.

02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:59.220
Fuck, if they had a US Guitar Freaks, that would be awesome.

02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:04.220
There will not be a US Guitar Freaks, just making that clear.

02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:10.220
Alright, I think we're gonna go to a break, and those of you guys that wanted to drop, go ahead.

02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:13.220
So the other people can get in. Remember, we are gonna play the song again a little later.

02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:16.220
We're gonna do a Monty Match Game when we come back. Let's do that. It'll be fun.

02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:17.220
Have fun.

02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:18.220
Alright, we're going to do that.

02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:19.220
And I'm going to tell you guys who won the cage match.

02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:20.220
I'm going to tally up those votes, too.

02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:21.700
I'm going to do something really cool though during the break.

02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:22.700
What's that?

02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:23.700
Fold my laundry.

02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:24.700
Have fun.

02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:27.780
And in this break, I think we're actually going to play songs from Max2USA.

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:28.780
I think that would be fun.

02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:33.500
So we're going to play some Max2USA songs, because, you know, I feel like hearing them.

02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:34.500
Don't you guys feel like hearing them?

02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:35.500
Yeah.

02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:36.500
Yeah, sure.

02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:37.500
Alright.

02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:44.500
so let's hear those songs and we'll be back

02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:16.500
I didn't know what I'd do When there was you and me

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:27.500
And everything went so wrong tonight And the stars came up in the sky

02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:32.500
And the music too, playing really through My mind in your love

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:39.500
It's so sad, cause baby when I heard you cry

02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:46.500
The world's worse than I knew you were meant to be

02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:54.500
Oh, baby when I heard you cry

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:59.500
The world's worse than I knew you were

02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:08.500
I want you to be in my way

02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:23.500
Will I ever love you again?

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:30.500
Will we be together again?

02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:36.500
Thought the love we had was strong

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:40.500
Tell me what's wrong

02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:44.500
Where did we go wrong?

02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:17.500
Will I, will I, will I?

02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:24.500
Will I, will I, will I?

02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:31.500
Will I ever love you again?

02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:38.500
Will we be together again?

02:04:38.500 --> 02:05:06.500
Tell me what's wrong, where did we go wrong?

02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:14.500
Shining night, another day turns into night

02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:20.500
Tunnel fire, waiting all my life

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:27.500
Take me away, million miles away from here

02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:34.500
Take me away, find a place for you and me

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:41.500
You're taking me higher, high as I could be

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:47.500
Take me away, forever you and me

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:49.500
Take me away

02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:01.500
Take me away

02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:08.500
A million miles away from me, take me away

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:15.500
The final place of you and me is shaking higher

02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:22.500
As high as I could see, take me away

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:48.420
Hey, I'm happy.

02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:50.020
A lot of you guys decided to stay on.

02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:52.380
Thank you guys for listening to us and supporting us.

02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:59.140
makes me a happy boy. You're happy! I am. We're about ready to play the match game,

02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:02.140
the Bimani match game. This is a fun little segment. We haven't done it in a long time

02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:06.980
either, so this is going to be something. But, Jamie, could you explain how the match

02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:10.700
game works, because I'm trying to look for our theme song. This is the precursor to Mad

02:07:10.700 --> 02:07:15.340
Libs, honestly, if you think about it. Basically, we have two contestants. In this case, we're

02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:20.500
going to have somebody from one of our listeners call in on the Skype line, and then our newest

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:27.020
guest on the show be our contestants. Basically, you're going to be read a sentence and at

02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:31.360
the end of it, the one word will be replaced with a blank and you have to fill in the blank.

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:36.000
Of course, the object is, as it's called the match game, you have to match us while we

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.860
think of something. And no, the answer is not propel.

02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:44.300
All right. Because you know what? Every game, the answer

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:49.740
was always propel. And I don't drink propel anymore. Propel is no longer a sponsor of

02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:54.740
We're now sponsored by Dr. Atkins, even though he's dead.

02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:59.740
I don't know about that. I can't say I'm into that, but okay.

02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:04.740
Well, I don't know. Because of that, there's less of me to be here.

02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:09.740
That and working my ass off.

02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:14.740
I've been trying to find the match game song clips because I lost it when I did my reinstall.

02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:21.740
since we've done match game I gotta say so we need a new match game thing okay

02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:25.700
do the match game thing. Porn music! Play porn music because it's the same

02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:30.100
difference okay okay then I'll just I'll find some porn music. Play the Price is Right music!

02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:34.260
I don't have the Price is Right music does everybody everybody get a piece of

02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:38.060
paper and a pen I hope you guys have that play some um here I'll play I'll

game theme song sex on the phone yes you might have to rip this up a little

02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:55.900
pieces now Andrew doesn't get a piece of paper because he's gonna be our

02:08:55.900 --> 02:09:01.860
contestant and for contestant number two we're gonna open up the skype line and

02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:06.660
we'll see who gives us a call over on the skype line I'm gonna write all over

02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:11.560
over hello kitty's face. You should do that. I'm hoping somebody will call in the skype

02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:14.140
line. Nobody calls in the skype line. We're going to have to take one of our chatters

02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:19.940
and I don't know if I want to do that. Somebody's got to call us in the skype line. Oh no, that

02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:26.940
piece of paper? It has clues as to what's an extreme. Let's see. Oh shit. I'm writing

02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:34.120
on the back of the extreme. Be rare. My bad. I've got a copy list that says milk, cheese,

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:36.120
Hold on, I've got to shut this guy off.

02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:38.120
Hello, can you hear us? You're on Orange Town's radio.

02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:40.120
Hello.

02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:42.120
Hello, hello, hello.

02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:44.120
Hello.

02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:46.120
We cannot hear you. Sorry, buddy.

02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.120
Dismissed.

02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:50.120
Let's see if we can answer this one. Hello. Oh, I missed that one.

02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:52.120
Hello? Hello? Hello, you there?

02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:54.120
Yes, I am here. Oh, hello, Richie!

02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.120
You just got in. Somebody else

02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:58.120
was in and then they dropped

02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:00.120
because we couldn't hear them, so

02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:02.120
Richie, you're it. Can you guys hear me good?

02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:04.120
Yeah, we can hear you good, too. Sorry to the other guy.

02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:07.120
Oh, you found the theme song, Loki. Oh, I'm so proud. Play the theme song.

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.120
We have to play it in between, anyway.

02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:11.120
Yeah, we have to. We'll play it in between.

02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:15.120
Ah. Much better. Much better. Can you hear that?

02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:17.120
Oh, God. Yeah, I can hear all of it.

02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:19.120
All right. Turn it down. Turn it down. Turn it off.

02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.120
All right. Here we go. Question number one is nice.

02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:24.120
You know how the match game works, right, Richie?

02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:26.120
Yeah. All right. I know how this works.

02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.120
All right. Here we go. Question number one.

02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:42.760
Jamie was sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:47.800
when she would try and play DDR. One day one of them tripped right in front of her as they

02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:53.640
tried to run by. Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you kid. Blank.

02:10:53.640 --> 02:11:02.000
That's when you play a song, there you go.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.840
You have to think of what would be in the blank.

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:09.000
Now we can't.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.120
Jamie was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and

02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:15.880
the pad when she would try and play DDR.

02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:18.880
One day one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.

02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:25.880
taking a look at the house that i've got one word for you can

02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:37.920

02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:39.720

02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:41.720
Alright, see you're all extorted.

02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:43.720
You got ten seconds.

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:50.720
Alright, alright, stop the music. Let's see.

02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:52.720
Alright, Richie, you still there with us?

02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:53.720
Yeah, I am.

02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:54.720
Alright, Richie.

02:11:54.720 --> 02:12:00.720
Jamie was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad when she would try and play DDR.

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:03.720
One day, one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.

02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:06.720
Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you, kid.

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:07.720
Owned.

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:11.000
owned. All right, Richie says

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.520
owned. Let's see what his opponent, Andrew, has to say.

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:18.920
Andrew, I've got one word for you, kid. I think it's also

02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:21.960

02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:25.640
All right, bitch is the other one. All right, let's see. We got all our...

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.040
Now we write these down on paper, so let's see.

02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:33.340
Let's go around and see what some of our persons said here. Let's start off with

02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:33.880
Jamie.

02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:37.520
Jamie, what would you have said? I've got one word for you, kid.

02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:43.520
Oops. Oops is not a match. Sorry. Uh, DDRholic, what'd you say?

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:46.520
I'm not too creative today. Doctor.

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:51.520
Doctor. Okay, that would be the nice thing to say. Unfortunately, the question was about Jamie.

02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:55.520
Everybody boo DDRholic. Boo. I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.520

02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:58.520
Um, okay.

I would say that. Classic. I said, I've got one word for you, kid. Abstinence.

That's beautiful. I think I'd say that too. No, no matches. No matches.

02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.680
They're talking to their parents. Was that your second answer, Richie?

02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:04.120

02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:17.160
Alright, it's all tied up. Nothing, nothing. Here we go. Second question.

02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:20.760
Get the music ready. Alright. Loki

02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.040
was getting sick and tired of the fact that whenever Andrew went to golf land

02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:26.080
dressed as a pirate,

02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:30.660
he got all the crowds watching him play DDR. In order to upstage

02:14:30.660 --> 02:14:35.660
him and get the attention back. Loki decided to show up dressed as a blank.

02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:40.660
Oh, this one's going to be exciting.

02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:59.660
That music, for some reason, makes me want chicken.

02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:15.340
Alright, we're going to start off with Andrew this time, and hey, it would be upstaging

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:16.820
you, what would Loki have to do?

02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:19.020
Loki showed up dressed as a...?

02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:22.620
I'm going to say Barwench, because I think he'd make a very sexy one.

02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:23.620
Barwench!

02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:24.620
Yeah.

02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:25.620
Barwench is Andrew's answer.

02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:28.900
Let's see what the competitor Richie has to say.

02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:35.540
as a... French maid. French maid! Well gee, this is a... That's a surprise coming from

02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:41.300
Richie, alright. Let's see if we've got a match. Jamie, dressed as a... I finally saw

02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:47.420
this, so you'll laugh at me. Dressed as Divine's role as Edna in Hairspray. Very nice, dressed

02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:51.100
as Divine, and nobody in the scene is ever going to get that joke, but that's okay. Uh,

02:15:51.100 --> 02:16:03.100
your holic. Loki's gonna show up dressed as an Oscar Meyer wiener. You're gay. And it's

02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:07.680
okay for me to say that. Alright, uh, Angel showed up. Okay, this is completely unlikely

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:12.220
to say, but I got to just because it's running, it's playing on words. I said you dress up

02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:19.860
as a cock. No, not that one! Dressed up as a cock, alright. Segerd. Segerd, uh, Loki

02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:25.140
in order to upstage him. Showed up dressed as a? Penis. Penis! You could have gotten

02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:29.140
two points! Going for the dick joke. Alright, Loki. What would you have to do? You'd have

02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:34.260
to show up dressed up as a? I'd have to dress up as Osama Bin Laden because he fucking rocks

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:42.780
the DDR. Wow. Wow, okay. Well that would certainly get you attention. Or as a Nazi. A Nazi would

02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:48.060
rock too. Or if we can combine them all, we would have to have like a white hood with

02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:53.940
the turban and then maybe a swastika paid in on that it could be like the the

02:16:53.940 --> 02:17:01.700
Antichrist I don't know the yeah I don't get it yeah whatever that was stupid I

02:17:01.700 --> 02:17:08.580
sorry for wasting your 30 seconds I said in order to upstage Loki would show up

02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:13.140
dressed as a crack whore and when in doubt crack whore you guys crack whore

02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:15.620
universal joke

02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:18.800
but then i just blend into the crowd

02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:22.620
uh... i didn't think of that you would you totally get in the car and i said

02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:24.060
there's almost a ninja

02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:26.820
because if you ever gone to realtimmapower.net

02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:31.060
don't you know that the mortal enemy of all ninjas are pirates

02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.460
an l-shaped tetris block

02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:34.960
that would be awesome

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:37.340
that would be so bad

02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:39.100
alright here we go

02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:42.460
uh... one more are no answer we have three more questions actually in a long

02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:44.540
one right here because i'm done in a while

02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:46.080
alright question three

02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:50.620
when rock came home from work and follow keys main cabinet

02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:54.380
he the first thing you thought to himself was g now that the thing is in

02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:59.640
my house i can play nothing but blank all day long

02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:01.880
and may not be the obvious choice right

02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:08.880
I can play nothing but blank all day long. Music.

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:32.120
That heavy breathing gets so dreamy on me.

02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:38.640
I'm teasing you, Richie.

02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:44.640
Alright. Oh, Richie. Dang. Yes. Alright. Richie's first this time, right?

02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:47.640
Richie, you're giving me a boner. Stop it. Alright.

02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:50.640
Hey Rob. Yeah? Um, no. Alright.

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:54.640
What if Rob dressed up as a maid for you?

02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.640
I don't know.

02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:01.640
Wouldn't you even get like a little bit of a boner? Like a half boner? Like a bone?

02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:04.640
Um, no. Alright, alright.

02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.640
Alright, you're dropping out there, buddy. Careful, we gotta hear you for this answer though, alright?

02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:14.640
Uh, here we go. Gee, now that this thing is in my house, I can play nothing but blank all day long. What?

02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:22.640
Okay, I was really gonna say, do you like horny bunnies, but then I'm gonna go into the chatroom and say, uh, um, girls panic.

02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:33.640
Gals panic. Gals panic. Alright, gals panic is what, uh, what he said, Richie. Andrew, what do you think? He's gonna stay home and play blank all day long.

02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.080
blank all day long. I think he's going to stay home and play with himself because that

02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.200
way Loki will be over here playing mad. And that way he doesn't feel awkward when he's

02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:45.520
doing it and Loki comes in and watches him like normal so I think it will be a lot more

02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:49.480
comfortable for Ross. Alright, so Andrew says he's just going to play with himself. Screw

02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:53.040
the machine, I'm going to play with myself. Alright, that's a very good answer actually.

02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:58.500
Alright, Jamie, I'm going to stay home and play Burger Time. Burger Time! The chat room

02:19:58.500 --> 02:20:02.500
Who was trying to get you guys to say it? Burger Time! Alright, let's see...

02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:05.500
Uh... DDR-Holic.

02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:12.500
Okay. Um, and by the way, for those of you who don't know, it's DDR-Coholic, but I let Rob call me Holic.

02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:14.500
Sorry, sorry. DDR-Coholic.

02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:17.500
No, that's your name for me. That's your name for me. Okay.

02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:20.500
I just like Holic.

02:20:20.500 --> 02:20:22.500
Okay, I thought that low-key would love...

02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:26.500
Richie! Hold on, Richie! Enough with the heavy breathing. You're turning me on over here.

02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:28.500
I know, I'm getting all wet and stuff.

02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:29.500
I know.

02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:32.500
Wait, you are over 18, right?

02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:34.500
Yes, I'm turning 21 in here.

02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:35.500
Oh boy, that's hot.

02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:36.500
Alright.

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:37.500
Okay.

02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:38.500
Alright.

02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:39.500
I'm sorry.

02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:40.500
Decide to stay home and play?

02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:41.500
And play Q-Bert!

02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:42.500

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:43.500
Good answer!

02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:45.500
Q-Bert is a game I would play all day long.

02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:47.500
DDR Angel, what would you say?

02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:48.500
What were you going to call me?

02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:50.500
I almost said DDRcholic again.

02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:52.500
DDR Angel.

02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:53.500
Pole Position.

02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:54.500
Pole Position!

02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:55.500
All these are great answers.

02:20:55.500 --> 02:21:01.280
answers. I would play Pulp Position all day long. Seagurd. It's only because I saw it

02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:07.500
today. Gals panic. Gals panic! That's a match! That's a match. It's a match for Ritchie!

02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:14.300
Alright, Ritchie gets a point. Alright. Loki. He decided to stay home and play. And we wonder

02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:19.780
why we don't play this game, you know, all the time. Anyways, no, the answer would be

02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:28.880

02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:42.440

our contestants. Segerd can become very tired after having to be a Konami slave all day

02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:09.600

02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:10.880
of the free... Andrew?

02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:14.400
I'm going to say something like caffeine or coffee or something like that.

02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:15.400
Okay, free...

02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:17.400
Free coffee, let's say. Free coffee.

02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:18.400
Okay, okay.

02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:19.400
What?

02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:20.400
Free stimulants.

02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:21.400
Yes, stimulants is good.

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:22.400
All right.

02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:24.400
Richie, you there?

02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:25.400
Yes.

02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:26.400
All right.

02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:27.400
Yes, I am.

02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:29.400
They're going to keep Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free...

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:30.400
Blowjobs.

02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:31.400
Blowjobs!

02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:34.400
All right, let's see if anybody gets a match.

02:23:34.400 --> 02:23:35.400
Okay, I didn't know...

02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:37.400
Oh, maybe I should go work for Konami.

02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:38.400
All right.

02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:41.400
Jamie keeps him a happy boy with all of the free...

02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:43.400
Politary torture sessions.

02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:46.600
Politary Torture Set! That wouldn't make me happy!

02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:48.600
That would make me sad.

02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:50.600
Alright.

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:54.600
Keep Seagrid a very happy boy with all of the free.

02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:55.600
Did you get a hug?

02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:57.600
Uh, how about Red Bull?

02:23:57.600 --> 02:23:58.600
Red Bull!

02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:02.600
That's, that's a match. I think it's a match with the stimulants. Good job.

02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:04.600
Good job. Alright, it's all tied up now.

02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:05.600
Alright.

02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:08.600
Let's see, Angel.

02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:10.600
She's still writing. Come on, you're still writing.

02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:11.600
Shut up!

02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:14.000
all of the free junk

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.840
junk because I didn't know what to put

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:18.000
I blame I know

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.400
all right all right

02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:21.860
that's all right no worries

02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:22.820
okay

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:24.240
Seegard

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:26.240
they keep you happy with all of the free

02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:30.360
okay everybody would have thought I would say a kiriyama oka anything

02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:34.440
but no I put suikoden yaoi fan fix

02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:37.160
suikoden yaoi fan fix

02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:39.360
that'd make me happy

02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:40.440
Loki

02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:46.180
All of the free... I said stimulants, and when I mean stimulants, I mean Karayamaoka

02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:51.800
porn. All of the home videos you don't get to see.

02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:56.560
All right. I don't think that's a match, though. Sorry, a different kind of stimulant. All

02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:03.000
right. My answer was, keep secret a very happy boy with all of the free grape-feeding men

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.700
and togas. That sounds pretty stimulating.

02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:11.580
Don't they have that room at Konami with all the great painting men and the togas?

02:25:11.580 --> 02:25:13.380
They're still looking for hints.

02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:16.500
Oh my God, Toga, that's a song.

02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:17.500
All right.

02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:18.500
Let's see.

02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:19.500
Moving on.

02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:20.500
Last question, guys.

02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:21.500
Last question, guys.

02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:22.500
You ready?

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:23.500
All right.

02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:24.500
Let's go.

02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:26.220
See, now this question isn't as funny anymore.

02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:29.980
I was going to do it before the big premiere, but just imagine we haven't done your reign

02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:30.980
yet.

02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:31.980
Okay?

02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:33.980
Here it is.

02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:38.060
When we told the listeners that it was all a big joke, and we weren't actually going

02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:43.060
to play Your Rain Tonight, the first thing the listeners did was blank the hosts.

02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:44.060
Music.

02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:45.060
Porn music.

02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:56.060
I swear this one makes me think like it should also be for a chicken commercial.

02:25:56.060 --> 02:26:03.060
I guess we think it should also be for a chicken commercial.

02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:24.780
Alright, here it is. Tiebreaker. Here's your chance.

02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:33.780
I'm going to start with Richie this time. Richie, when we told the listeners that it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play Your Rain tonight, the first thing the listeners did was blank the host.

02:26:33.780 --> 02:26:37.780
Was to have spicy hot orgasms with the host.

02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:43.780
Spicy hot orgasms! Interesting. Alright, let's see. Andrew, first thing they were going to do was what to the host?

02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:50.780
Well, tie them up and force them to listen to Good Charlotte and Linkin Park, which is more punishing than anything I can think of.

02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:54.500
Oh yeah, that's pretty bad. Alright. Oh, wow, okay. Let's see if we get a match.

02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:57.580
Jamie, they decided to blank the host.

02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:02.940
Mooned. Mooned! They made us look at their... On their webcams. On their webcams.

02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:06.180
Good answer. Not a match. DDRHolic.

02:27:06.180 --> 02:27:10.660
Uh, this might be close to the steamy orgasms. Um, queefed?

02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:14.140
I don't think so. I think that's...

02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:18.020
I think that's a little bit different. Are you sure? I think it's a little different, honey.

02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:18.520
No, okay.

02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:19.320
A little different, honey.

02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:19.820
Okay.

02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:20.320
All right.

02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:22.320
DDR Angel, they decided to...

02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:24.020
Flash naughty bits on a webcam.

02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:26.320
Flash naughty bits on their webcam to the host.

02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:28.320
No, doesn't work, sorry, but...

02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:30.320
Seagurd!

02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:31.320
Richie!

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:32.320
Yes?

02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.320
Stop, you're making me...

02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:35.320
Later!

02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:36.320
Oh!

02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:38.320
Later!

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:41.320
I was boring, and I just said murdered the host.

02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:42.320
Murdered.

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:44.020
Oh, that was a good answer.

02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:45.820
All right, Loki.

02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:47.820
Banned from DDR freak.

02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:50.820
That would be awfully hard.

02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:53.820
Considering one of our hosts is a moderator, that would be kind of hard.

02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:55.820
Unless it was April Fool's time again, huh?

02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:57.820
That was a hilarious joke.

02:27:57.820 --> 02:27:58.820
Did I ever tell you that?

02:27:58.820 --> 02:27:59.820
Alright.

02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:04.820
Hey Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:05.820
Bitch, what?

02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:08.820
Fine, I won't tell you.

02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:11.820
Is it a hint?

02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:12.820
Is it a hint?

02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:14.820
The hint is the new ferret mix.

02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:26.820
Alright, here it is. My answer. When we told the listeners it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play Your Rain tonight, the first thing the listeners did was give money to the hosts because that's what I need them to do.

02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:27.820
Oh, buy them.

02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:29.820
Give them money for this money. Yeah. Alright.

02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:34.820
And El Mullet. Webcam, yo. Webcam.

02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:40.820
Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's match game. The final score guys, Andrew, one point. Good job.

02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:45.820
Richie, one point, which means they tied. And you know what that means?

02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:49.820
You both lose! You both lose! Good job.

02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:54.820
Richie, now that you've lost the match game, how do you feel?

02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:59.820
What are you going to do now? I think I'm going to go back into the bathroom for another ten minutes.

02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:08.140
Alright, sounds good. You do that! Remember to flush. Alright. Alright, Richie, thanks

02:29:08.140 --> 02:29:14.700
for playing but you lose. Oh, okay. Any last words you want to say? Amy, when I come on

02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:19.060
that show, I am going to stuff those bears down my pants. Alright. That is all. Bye,

02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:25.860
thank you. Alright. Okay, we've got, we have not even talked about Bamani news yet, and

02:29:25.860 --> 02:29:30.900
still got the FUs of the week to do. So, Loki, Loki's gonna catch, what, yes, Secret

02:29:30.900 --> 02:29:35.060
Dude. Oh, just for the listeners that aren't in the chat room, there sounds like there

02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:41.100
will be hints coming next week, for real. Real ones. Yeah, real ones. So, be on the

02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:48.140
lookout. Alright. Sounds good. Let's get to some of our other Bomani news. Loki's gonna

02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:53.100
kinda run down what's been going on here. Yeah, since we kinda bypassed that whole section

02:29:53.100 --> 02:29:58.420
of the show, because that's not important, no one really cares. Well first off, 2DX Red,

02:29:58.420 --> 02:30:05.260
or 2DX11 was testing now in Japan, and of course we have the first, you know, song list

02:30:05.260 --> 02:30:10.540
that's out over there. There's some really cool stuff, we've got a brand new DJ setup

02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:20.340
track, Spiritual Galaxy, a brand new eight plus, woo, eight plus song, which is Gigadelic,

02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:27.340
And then there's also a bunch of other tracks that are on there. New Walls track, which is pretty sweet.

02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:36.340
Just a lot of cool stuff. Check it out in Bomani style or Air Japan or any other site that carries Bomani news because you've got tons of info on it.

02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:42.340
New stuff that's going to be in there. They have a new ranking thing that's on the side of the screen as you're playing the game,

02:30:42.340 --> 02:30:46.340
which shows your combo versus the max combo on the machine, which I thought was pretty neat.

02:30:46.340 --> 02:31:12.340
And, um, you know, and it's very red, hence the name 2DX Red. Of course, there'll be more songs coming out as time goes on right now, um, because with each test, of course, they add more songs to it and stuff. Um, supposedly, there's gonna be a lot more new songs coming, and it just looks pretty sweet. Um, uh, also, a Eurotrance-style version of Platonic X, which makes me sad.

02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:18.340
But yeah, in Secret of Love, new DJ Swan track, also did Gentle Stress, so that'd be pretty cool.

02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:26.340
Aside from that kind of stuff, hmm, well I know there's a lot of Sim stuff.

02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:32.340
There was big Sim news this week, even if you've just been spending your time on the internet

02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:38.340
doing nothing but waiting for Xtreme and UltraMix 2 hints, you're missing some of the stuff that's going on in the Sim scene

02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:41.620
in the sim scene and while you know that might be questionable or whatever, there is some

02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:44.540
good stuff going on. What is going on right now? There is some big stuff going on.

02:31:44.540 --> 02:31:48.820
My god, there is a bunch of big stuff going on. First off, you know, the best sim file

02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:53.540
makers on the face of the fucking earth, okay, the FoodMix team, they released FoodMix Plus,

02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:58.060
which is awesome. You need to go check it out. 15 brand new songs. Most of the songs

02:31:58.060 --> 02:32:03.300
are from Diverse 7, which is also out right now. It's going to be, um, Diverse 7 is actually

02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:10.100
gonna be featuring three different CDs with actual key sound files for BMS players. Basically

02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:15.420
it's the BeatMania, 2DX, SIMS. And I gotta say these artists are fucking awesome. They

02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:20.240
do really kick ass Bomani remixes and you need to go check them out. If you haven't

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:26.920
heard of Diverse Systems before, you can definitely check them out. It's at www.diverse.jp. And

02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:30.820
go check it out. They have an English page. You can order the CDs and they're really kick

02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:35.820
And they were actually the ones that were distributing Bounce Connected for a while there, so definitely check it out.

02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:42.820
But one of the cool, some of the cool stuff that's on there, you've got a few remixes I'd like to kind of just tease a little bit.

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:44.820
Maybe we can play these in a break or something.

02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:50.820
There was some new ones, there was a new track by Offbeat which did some really kick-ass stuff.

02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:54.820
This would be the Holic remix called Holics.

02:32:54.820 --> 02:32:59.820
And it was pretty sweet, so let me just play a little bit in the middle here.

02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:04.820
I mean, that was pretty sweet.

02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:11.820
And then, we've also got, there's a brand new, what was it?

02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:15.820
Innocent Walls remix, which, oh my God.

02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:18.820
It's fucking awesome.

02:33:18.820 --> 02:33:25.820
Let me see here.

02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:33.340
Let's see.

02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:41.980
Just some really kick-ass stuff, and of course they make awesome videos that go with

02:33:41.980 --> 02:33:42.620
everything.

02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:45.940
Steps are really good. Definitely go check it out.

02:33:45.940 --> 02:33:51.540
There's remixes of G2, Max 300 of course, but you know, it's really awesome.

02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:59.260
Um, there's remixes of, uh, 20 November, Brilliant 2 U, Haulik, as I mentioned before, the Safari,

02:33:59.260 --> 02:34:01.540
just a bunch of really cool stuff.

02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:02.540
Go check it out.

02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:07.220
And, since it is all in one pack, you do get the original Food Mix as well, which there's

02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:11.740
tons of songs in that, all the same quality, just excellent.

02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:13.380
Go check that out.

02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:20.380
Aside from that, there's been more work being done on the front of starting to rip stuff from games.

02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:30.380
Actually, there's a guy working on ripping all the characters, the 3D characters from the PlayStation versions, and all the background graphics and stuff, and the progress so far has been really cool.

02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:37.380
You can check that on DDR Maniacs under the StepMania forums and their themes, and that was really cool.

02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:47.380
And then, of course, there's DDROSC3, which is pretty cool. There's a new Stepfile contest, you know, kind of a break from Turning Mix.

02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:58.380
So you can check that out, too. And, of course, if you're not really into, you know, making SIM files and more of, like, the remixing type, there's remix contests going on, DDRMania X and also BomaniCell.

02:34:58.380 --> 02:35:03.380
So check those out. They're pretty much, pretty similar, so you might find one that you want to enter.

02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:17.380
But that's pretty much just going on right now. I've heard that there was going to be, you know, an Alpha 22 for StepMania 3-9, but apparently not yet. But, um, coming, soon.

02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:29.380
Alright. Thanks for catching up on the news. I know we kind of got pushed aside because of all the other crap we got going on tonight, but, you know, there is other news going on out there, so thanks for bringing it up. Anybody want to comment on any of the news?

02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:33.380
Well, you guys are easy to please. Talkative bunch, talkative bunch, aren't you?

02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:38.380
Alright, I think what we're going to do now, actually we'll take a quick break and we're going to play some songs.

02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:41.380
Oh, actually I have to announce tonight's winner of the cage match, my bad.

02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:49.380
Tonight's winner of the cage match, I was actually kind of surprised by this, but Loki's remix has been dethroned and we have a new winner.

02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:59.020
Astro Sexy by M-Flow won tonight's cage match and will be in rotation all week long on Orange

02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:03.040
Lawns Radio's Bamani Music & More program, which by the way, I know some of you guys

02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:07.840
just tuned into the station for the first time tonight, but we do play Bamani music

02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:14.480
from 2DX, DDR, home version stuff, poppin' music, Guitar Freaks drum media, dance mania

02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:21.480
tracks that you don't hear usually on Bahmanim playlists. So we bought that running 24-7.

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:25.800
Yeah, I'm pumping up songs too. Some of the good ones. So definitely tune into that. It

02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:31.640
runs all day. And an MP3 Pro means you get DSL quality radio on a dial-up stream.

02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:37.080
We even throw in a couple of happy-to-be hardcore tracks here and there too.

02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:43.280
Good stuff. Alright, so M-Flow one tonight. I think we're gonna do it. We're gonna take

02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:45.920
a break, and we're actually going to play two tracks from Food Mix. I want to play the

02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:48.600
Max remix, because I think it's really good, and we're going to play the Safari, because

02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:51.640
I like that one. So I thought we'd play those for the guys.

02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:54.920
Those are pretty cool, yeah. They're all good. They're all good, really.

02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:58.640
They're really, my favorites of the new one have to be the Instant Walls one.

02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:01.080
Okay, I'll take out, I'll take, I'll put in Innocent Walls, too.

02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:07.080
And the Innocent Walls one is fucking awesome. I mean, they, the guys from Food Mix did enter

02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:12.120
Turning Mix 5, but the entry that they picked was like one of the worst ones that they did.

02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:22.120
But if they picked one of these, oh my god, it would have owned everybody, but, whatever, you know, I'm sure they're not out to brag, because they know they're kick-ass, and they don't really need to prove it, so...

02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:25.120
Yeah, rocks.

02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:28.120
Alright, so we'll get that in there too, then, I just gotta remember...

02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:30.120
Is that it?

02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:34.120
Oh, sure is. Alright, then we'll do this song first, why don't we?

02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:38.040
We're going to do that Innocent Walls remix, and then when we come back, we are going to

02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:41.440
do the FUs of the week, however we have to keep it fast tonight, so we're going to run

02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:46.640
through everybody in the room, and unfortunately tonight, only selected chat room FUs will

02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.720
be read, so if you send me a long one, not going to get read, so think of something really

02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:53.720
good if you have a good story, and I apologize in advance, but we are running on a limited

02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:58.640
schedule tonight, so keep them short, FUs from chat room will be limited, but send those

02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:00.260
to Sky over private message.

02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:04.720
So here it is, check it out, some remix songs from the latest Foon mix, starting off with

02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:08.420
an Innocent Walls vocal mix, Max remix, and then a guitar remix.

02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:13.100
Let me get the actual title, hold on, because I want to be correct on this.

02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:20.180
This title of this remix here is called Made in Innocent, and it's a short version by OnoKen.

02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:27.500
OnoKen, which fucking rocks, did P8107 rumored to have a song in 2DX Red, but I think that's

02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:28.500
pretty much a rumor.

02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:35.500
It would be awesome if he did, but just a rumor for now. So yeah, check it out. Awesome work.

02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:38.500
Alright, and don't forget, your rain will be back again at 9.40. We're going to play that again.

02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:45.500
Okay, anyway, here we go, um, some stuff we're filming, so we'll be back with EFUs of the Week.

02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:10.500
When I get back, it's a hot booty break-up

02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:12.500
Clear the phone, your keys, they come to speakin'

02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:14.500
Got a lot of shit to say, but on your lips, we kept

02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:16.500
We always put hoodies away, them kids clap

02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:18.500
Hear my shit, my real technique

02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:20.500
I'm speakin', breakin' my bones

02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:22.500
Rhymes up, I'm liking to the devil's cuss bones

02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:24.500
Deep into the wild blue horizon

02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:42.500
You want to hear

02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:46.500
The teacher

02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:18.880
when again i can't stop breathing

02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:20.460
s scythe's going to tend to go to sleep

02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:22.180
leave me alone girl house it's a sequence

02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:22.720
if you stay asleep

02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:27.300
now we wonder what it's going to feel when it

02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:30.700
break, and honestly it was turn to the

02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:36.580
yeah

02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:43.740
dealing with

02:44:13.740 --> 02:44:14.440
Make a look at these

02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:17.340
You can't you can't you these

02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:20.740
You can't you can't you these

02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:23.940
You can't you can't you these

02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:26.840
You can't you can't you these

02:44:27.740 --> 02:44:30.840
You can't you can't you these

02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:33.840
You can't you can't you these

02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:36.840
You can't you can't you these

02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:47.840
Niko, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,

02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:48.840
Oh, Ash!

02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:53.840
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:57.840
Yes, we are a little bit random here on Orange Lounge Radio, if you haven't guessed.

02:44:57.840 --> 02:44:58.840
A little.

02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:01.840
But, you know what, a lot of guys stuck around after the underage thing, so you like us.

02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:02.840
We appreciate you.

02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:03.840
You really like us.

02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:04.840
No, we do appreciate it.

02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:08.140
is to stick with us, because then we feel good about ourselves.

02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:09.140
We've been trying here, you guys.

02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:10.540
It validates us for the week.

02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:12.440
We think it's a fun thing to do on a Sunday night.

02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:15.540
I mean, you know, it's not like I'm going to church or anything.

02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:16.740
Not like we're getting paid for this.

02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:17.940
Yeah, we don't get paid for this either.

02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:19.040
We pay for this.

02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:20.340
We do.

02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:21.340
That's alright, that's why I couldn't...

02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:22.340
With our souls!

02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:24.840
Yeah, it would cost me a lot of money to increase the cap

02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:28.140
to get more people on stream tonight, so sorry guys, couldn't do it.

02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:30.340
Um, anyway, we gotta get into this,

02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:31.540
because we don't have a lot of time left in the show,

02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:33.040
but I do want to get into the FUs of the week.

02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:34.440
We're gonna move quickly, you guys, tonight,

02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:40.440
But, speaking of randomness, why do we do the FUs of the Week, for those of our new listeners, Jamie?

02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:45.440
We have this whole buildup of angst, and we need to have a big bad release of it, or else we, like, explode.

02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:52.440
Alright. Alright, here we go then, Jamie. It's time to do the FUs of the Week. You ready?

02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:53.440
I'm ready, Rob.

02:45:53.440 --> 02:46:13.620
I would like to give a big F.U. to the three root beers that I have had that facilitated

02:46:13.620 --> 02:46:14.620
that loud belch.

02:46:14.620 --> 02:46:16.540
I am normally not as unladylike.

02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:18.420
I usually am a lot more unladylike.

02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:20.220
Nah, really.

02:46:20.220 --> 02:46:26.220
A big F.U. to impatience, especially for people who drive.

02:46:26.220 --> 02:46:34.220
And another F.U. goes to A.R.C. for not posting my financial aid stuff and certifying my loans so I can get my fucking money.

02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:40.220
That's it. I'm being nice. F.U. to freaking running out of time.

02:46:40.220 --> 02:46:43.220
Alright, moving on. Loki, your turn.

02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:54.420
I fucking hate stupid stanky drivers who can't fucking drive. I had this stupid bitch last

02:46:54.420 --> 02:47:00.220
weekend still pissing me off. Fucking cut me off when I'm driving just to get behind

02:47:00.220 --> 02:47:04.900
a slow person that was in front of me. Oh wow, guess what? You got to that intersection

02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:09.720
a whole half a second faster than I did. Good, now you can go fuck another sheep and have

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:17.820
your next child okay then finally cuz I'm gonna keep this short fuck you to

02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:22.200
sluts at my work who get higher up in the company about fucking to your box

02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:28.060
and openly admitting it and bragging about it I fucking hate you and I will

02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:36.060
take you down and I'm not talking about in a good way. I'm done. My turn.

02:47:42.060 --> 02:47:50.060
I have to do it myself for the fact that I am paying about $13.95 a month to play Final Fantasy 11 and I have touched it a whopping one time this whole week.

02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:56.060
Because I found better things to do for once in my life. For once in my life, no, because I found something even better than Ragnarok.

02:47:56.060 --> 02:48:01.140
i went out and i went on a date this week so that was something better

02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:02.380
yes finally

02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:03.940
uh...

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:07.560
but i thought that they had to add on it i was not too much for them

02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:09.220
i'd like to get the whole but anyway

02:48:09.220 --> 02:48:11.700
i'm just glad i got out of the house you know i mean

02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:14.860
but uh...

02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:17.740
that here still

02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:20.920
my other if you go to on that burning

02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:24.260
in my car i thought like i cracked my radiator something

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:28.220
but actually i just run over a plastic bag and it wrapped itself around my pipe and caught

02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:29.500
itself on fire

02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:34.620
so f you to people that leave plastic bags in the road what the hell you do that for?

02:48:34.620 --> 02:48:36.620
stupid

02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:40.060
this is the best thing i've ever seen

02:48:40.060 --> 02:48:45.160
moving on let's go to our other studio guests

02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:49.060
starting off with who's got a microphone over there

02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:52.120
mister uh... andrew what do you have to say f u to what

02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:56.120
Alright, well I'd like to give a big fuck you to all the bar and speed mod haters out there.

02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:59.120
I'd just like to piss you guys off right now before I get started.

02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:03.120
I wanted to talk to you more about the bar raping thing tonight, but we just ran out of time.

02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:04.120
I'll come back.

02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:05.120
You gotta come back, alright.

02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:06.120
We ain't got time.

02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:10.120
I'd also like to give a big F you to everybody that lives in Glen Rose, Texas.

02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:14.120
I don't care if I know you or not, but just that whole town needs to just be wiped off the map.

02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:19.120
And last but not least, if you're a friend that I told to listen tonight and you're not listening,

02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:20.120
fuck you guys.

02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:21.120
Don't ever talk to me again.

02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:26.360
me again. You are listening. I love you. In that platonic kind of way. Okay, that's all

02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:27.360
I got.

02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:28.360
Alright, very nice. Angel.

02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:31.880
Alright, I'm going to go through this real quick because I got one from Agus as well.

02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:37.520
He says, F you to sitting on my ass on a perfectly good Sunday doing nothing except for answering

02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:42.600
people's phone calls and they happen to be going to the wrong department. And he's the

02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:43.600
only one there.

02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:58.600
Also, I'd like to say a quick F U to the stoplight on Arden and Del Paso, because it is the longest piece of crap I've ever, like, waited on, and it happened to be while I was trying to get over here.

02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:08.600
So I'm going, okay, I can go now, really, I really want to get here. Yeah, because I'm, like, you know, an Orange Lounge freak like that. Anyway, next person.

They could put it in the middle. No, they don't do that. They put it on one end.

02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:12.240
So anyway, fuck into that. That's it.

02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:13.240

You're sleeping in the kitchen?

02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:25.240
Yeah, I'm sleeping in the kitchen.

02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:27.240
You are so Cinderella. It's horrible.

02:51:27.240 --> 02:51:28.240
I made that comparison the other night.

02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:32.240
Yeah, I didn't like it because that would mean I'd have to wear a dress or something.

02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:50.240
F you to the chat room because it's funny. F you to people who read into what we say far too much and F you to your guys' crazy Photoshop skills because it's really creepy but funny so keep it up.

02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:57.240
See, Konami employees are real people too, you guys. Alright, let's go to the chat room F you, shall we?

02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:58.240
Oh, I forgot another big one.

02:51:58.240 --> 02:51:59.240
Yes, Jamie.

02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:04.440
Um, and F.U. to not having time or money to go where I want to go and see who I want to see.

02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:05.940
Aww.

02:52:05.940 --> 02:52:13.440
One really quick one, uh, F.U. to the post office for holding all of our mail because we're still trying to get forward and stuff.

02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:15.440
That really sucks for three weeks now.

02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:23.440
Yeah, yeah, you know, you, uh, Miklotov or whatever the hell you go by now, don't stress out, just, you know, mellow out, be gentle.

02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:25.440
Have some gentle stress.

02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:27.440
Alright.

02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:29.440
Was that a hint?

02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:31.440
Was that a hint?

02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:34.440
Oh my god, Gentle Stress is in a version of DDR.

02:52:34.440 --> 02:52:36.440
Okay, here we go.

02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:39.440
Oh, this is going to be good. I'm loving this first one already.

Let's go into the chatroom FUs.

02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:43.440
We're going to start a fight here tonight.

02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:48.440
Tora would like to give an FU to Jamie, also known as Dark Sakura.

02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:49.440
Why?

02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:52.440
Because she gave me warning points for no reason way back when.

02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:56.440
Okay, if I warn you it's for a fucking reason. You did something wrong.

02:52:56.440 --> 02:53:01.720

02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:25.580
How about bootsy ass?

02:54:25.580 --> 02:54:28.980
Why do I reboot?

02:54:28.980 --> 02:54:29.980
Alright.

02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:34.400
MJB would like to say my FU of the week goes to my shitty internet for disconnecting me

02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:38.380
from Orange Launch Radio, almost causing me to miss my FUs of the week.

02:54:38.380 --> 02:54:40.180
Well we can't have that can we?

02:54:40.180 --> 02:54:44.220
Any other week you would have been okay with the cap thing, I swear, tonight's just crazy.

02:54:44.220 --> 02:54:49.220
I just found missed calls from two of my bestest friends.

02:54:49.220 --> 02:54:51.220
But you were listening to this show, so it's okay.

02:54:51.220 --> 02:54:52.220
We're your new bestest friends.

02:54:52.220 --> 02:54:53.220
Ooh, I hit that.

02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:54.220
F.U. to Gaps.

02:54:54.220 --> 02:54:55.220
All right.

02:54:55.220 --> 02:54:59.220
Ry Chan says, F.U. to Coughing Really Hard and Weezing While Trying to Play a 9-Foot

02:54:59.220 --> 02:55:00.220
DDR Song in the Arcade.

02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:01.220
Hey, that was me last night on Pumped Up.

02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:02.220
That's me.

02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:03.220
That's me.

02:55:03.220 --> 02:55:04.220
That's me.

02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:05.220
That's me.

02:55:05.220 --> 02:55:06.220
That's me.

02:55:06.220 --> 02:55:07.220
That's me.

02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:08.220
That's me.

02:55:08.220 --> 02:55:09.220
That's me.

02:55:09.220 --> 02:55:10.220
That's me.

02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:11.220
That's me.

02:55:11.220 --> 02:55:12.220
That's me.

02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:13.220
That's me.

02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:16.980
That was me last night. I'll pump it up. I thought I was gonna die brain cancer. Could you pick up maybe?

02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:20.180
and lastly

02:55:20.580 --> 02:55:21.620
Vandalous

02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:28.500
Vandalous says my fu is for the Sacramento Kings in their recent drama. It's like a friggin soap opera full of spoiled millionaires

02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:34.380
Thanks. Yeah. Amen. Thank God. They're leaving now now play nice

02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:37.060
Yeah, you're gonna start another fight here

02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:37.900
You know what?

02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:44.140
I think the people who get bent out of shape over sports rivalries really need to like get a life one more last-minute one here

02:55:44.140 --> 02:55:49.020
Our Kara says F you to Andrew for not giving me my sexiness. I don't know what that's supposed to mean

02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:50.260
Is that a hidden message?

02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:54.600
Wait about two weeks. Do you need to take this offline? No, I think we're I think we're all good

02:55:55.140 --> 02:55:58.820
Just give me two weeks or something. It's on on. All right

02:56:00.980 --> 02:56:03.980
Is somebody gonna get served I think

02:56:03.980 --> 02:56:10.420
think suckers gonna get Chronicle that's what's up all right um guys it's the end

02:56:10.420 --> 02:56:14.740
of the show we're already here I know cry well thank you guys for listening

02:56:14.740 --> 02:56:18.860
and making it a great show tonight I hope we don't need exclusives to make

02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:23.060
you guys keep listening to us but I we are exclusive hopefully you liked it

02:56:23.060 --> 02:56:26.300
you'll come back but if not hey thanks for wasting three hours with us tonight

02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:30.900
I hope you like the song but we're gonna go around and get everybody's final

02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:35.340
thoughts. Let's start off with DD Archaholic. DD Archaholic, your final thought. It's like

02:56:35.340 --> 02:56:37.780
Jerry Springer's final thought. It's your final thought.

02:56:37.780 --> 02:56:43.620
Well, quick shout out to my boyfriend, Jason, DarkChild999. I don't know if he's listening

02:56:43.620 --> 02:56:54.620
or not. He might be. And final thought. Chewing gum that tastes like grape is really good.

02:56:54.620 --> 02:56:57.620
Um, Angel, your final thought?

02:56:57.620 --> 02:57:01.620
Um, Akira Yomoko, because I can.

02:57:01.620 --> 02:57:06.620
Okay. Hey, Akira is a good thing. Andrew?

02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:11.620
I just want to say thanks for having me on the show. I hope to be back in the future, and this place kicks ass.

02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:14.620
But there's way too much fucking Pokemon in here, man. It's creep-

02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:16.620
You're welcome! You're welcome!

02:57:16.620 --> 02:57:18.620
It's creeping me the hell out. Okay.

02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:20.620
Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold that thought. Hold that thought.

02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:29.620
and this is the time where we fill the air while rob goes way, better than filling air for three hours while...

02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:32.620
ahhh!!!

02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:35.620
I'm going to put that on the cam, you guys

02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:37.620
ok, you do that

02:57:38.620 --> 02:57:39.620
woooo!

02:57:39.620 --> 02:57:40.620
Go!

02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:43.620
Anyways, umm, I guess I'll do my final thought

02:57:43.620 --> 02:57:47.620
my final thought is, I feel sorry for anyone that tuned in tonight just to hear that song

02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:49.620
and then expose themselves to our stories

02:57:49.620 --> 02:58:03.620
expose themselves to our show, because that sucks. No, but really though, I hope you guys listen some more, because there's those moments that are really cool. It's kind of like watching bad movies. You know, eventually you'll get to a moment that's like really funny and stuff.

02:58:03.620 --> 02:58:09.620
It's like watching Xanadu. Exactly. No, I've never seen that, so that doesn't make any sense to me.

02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:11.620
It's like watching Battle Royale 2.

02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:12.940
God, that movie sucked.

02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:15.260
Don't see Battle Royale 2.

02:58:15.260 --> 02:58:19.500
Instead, instead, download the camera above Kashaan,

02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:21.700
because that fucking rocks.

02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:22.540
Okay.

02:58:24.380 --> 02:58:27.180
And my final thought is,

02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:29.660
please come back and listen to us again,

02:58:29.660 --> 02:58:31.580
even though we're not gonna have any more premieres.

02:58:31.580 --> 02:58:34.060
Please come back and listen.

02:58:34.060 --> 02:58:37.060
I know, okay, I didn't say, do I always have to go last?

02:58:37.060 --> 02:58:37.900
Yes.

02:58:39.140 --> 02:58:40.540
We, no.

02:58:40.540 --> 02:58:45.720
We could. I could empty the stream. We could, like, put that clip of me singing again on,

02:58:45.720 --> 02:58:51.580
you know, because that's pretty sad. Uh, Seagurd, once. You're going last? He's gonna go last.

02:58:51.580 --> 02:58:55.320
Okay, then. I'm being nice. DarkSakura, you always go last, though. You're being very

02:58:55.320 --> 02:58:59.340
nice tonight. I'm, I think I've shown quite a bit of restraint tonight. I think you've

02:58:59.340 --> 02:59:03.620
been a very good girl. You get a cookie. No, if it's a low-carb cookie. A low-carb cookie.

02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:09.300
Okay. All right. Um, I, I was such a disbeliever for this stupid Atkins diet, because, you

02:59:09.300 --> 02:59:13.820
you know, sort of what your body does before it dies. But it works. So maybe I'm going

02:59:13.820 --> 02:59:21.080
to die. I don't lose a lot of weight. My final thought is that Diet Hansen's root beer is

02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:26.620
the best thing in the world. Alright. I agree. Second best thing in the world. It's lovely.

02:59:26.620 --> 02:59:32.620
Next to orgasms. Alright. You know, I do have to say that orgasms are very nice. They are.

02:59:32.620 --> 02:59:37.460
They should just sell canned orgasms. They should. For all those people who... Orgasm

02:59:37.460 --> 02:59:44.940
Seagurd, your final thought?

02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:48.980
My final thought is, I hope everybody liked the remix of Your Rain.

02:59:48.980 --> 02:59:53.000
It's really fun in DDR, so I look forward to that.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:58.260
Also look forward to this week when it sounds like we might really be giving clues out.

02:59:58.260 --> 03:00:03.500
So that's going to be cool, and thanks for listening to me whore myself out over the

03:00:03.500 --> 03:00:11.980
the radio. All right. And final word of the show. Are we going to give it to Andrew? All

03:00:11.980 --> 03:00:15.700
right, let's give it to Andrew. It's just one word that sums up the entire show, but

03:00:15.700 --> 03:00:21.100
it can only be one word that sums everything up. Suckers. You're all suckers.

03:00:21.100 --> 03:00:28.300

On the Star Trek Enterprise, on the Star Trek universe

03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:53.800
Star trekking across the universe

And it's worse than that, he's dead, Jim

03:02:08.700 --> 03:02:09.780
Dead, Jim, dead

03:02:09.780 --> 03:02:11.700
It's life, Jim, but not as we know it

03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:13.280
Not as we know it, not as we know it

03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:15.060
It's life, Jim, but not as we know it

03:02:15.060 --> 03:02:15.960
Not as we know it

03:02:15.960 --> 03:02:18.020
Now spare Klingons on the starboard bow

03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:19.460
Starboard Bow. starboard Bow

03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:21.200
Spare Klingons on the starboard bow

03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:22.720
starboard bow, Jim

03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:24.920

03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:27.140
Volcano

03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:28.880
Ah, ah, ah

03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:29.780

I'M A CHAMPION!

03:03:37.780 --> 03:03:39.180
You better change your script, Jim.

03:03:39.180 --> 03:03:40.280
I'll see you, Jimmy!

03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:41.580
First, let us finish you!

03:03:41.580 --> 03:03:42.780
Register, enter room.

03:03:42.780 --> 03:03:43.780
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

03:03:43.780 --> 03:03:46.780
I don't know if I can get any more shit for all of them!

03:04:13.780 --> 03:04:43.020
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:04:43.020 --> 03:04:49.380
Alright, the afterbirth, the part after we fade to black, the secret part of the show,

03:04:49.380 --> 03:04:55.940
the afterbirth where we do things that we couldn't do during the show, and you know

03:04:55.940 --> 03:05:00.740
what guys? We haven't even really talked about this in the room, but there's one other little

03:05:00.740 --> 03:05:06.220
thing we want to play for you guys. This is why it pays to listen. Yes it does, and it's

03:05:06.220 --> 03:05:10.460
not DDR, it's not a DDR thing, but Secret wanted to share it with you guys anyway. It

03:05:10.460 --> 03:05:16.460
something that hasn't been heard by a lot of people yet. The Silent Hill thing. Oh,

03:05:16.460 --> 03:05:19.460
we're going to actually do it? Yeah, we're going to do that. It's a happy birth now.

03:05:19.460 --> 03:05:25.380
Okay, I'm a DDR fan and all, but I'm more a Silent Hill fan. We are going to play you

03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:34.940
a track from the US OST. It's one of the 13 special exclusive songs to the American OST.

03:05:34.940 --> 03:05:36.940
It's Waver, slide mix.

03:05:36.940 --> 03:05:38.940
Alright, so this is sweet.

03:05:38.940 --> 03:05:41.940
It's a brand new US song, hasn't been heard yet, but we're gonna play it for you guys.

03:05:41.940 --> 03:05:43.940
Waver, and it's a Kiryamoka.

03:05:43.940 --> 03:05:44.940
It's another song of his.

03:05:44.940 --> 03:05:47.940
See, again, that's why it pays to stay tuned to the end of the show.

03:05:47.940 --> 03:05:49.940
Pays to stay tuned. Enjoy.

03:05:52.940 --> 03:05:55.940
Whoops, sorry, technical difficulties, my bad.

03:05:55.940 --> 03:06:02.940
let's try that again

03:07:25.940 --> 03:07:26.940
Woo!

03:07:26.940 --> 03:07:34.100
That's alright we, that's alright we that's alright we that's alright we that's alright

03:07:34.100 --> 03:07:41.800

03:08:47.700 --> 03:09:07.160
All right, that was pretty cool. It was from the Silent Hill US soundtrack. I kind of like

03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:08.160
that. It's kind of...

03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:09.160
That was kind of...

03:09:09.160 --> 03:09:11.040
That's like your favorite one, singer?

03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:16.240
That is totally my favorite Akira Yamaoka song. The original version of that is kind

03:09:16.240 --> 03:09:20.560
boring but that one with the crazy like singing I was listening to it on Bart at

03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:26.040
night at going home from work and I was seriously freaking out it was the best

03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:30.240
it sounds kind of porno in a way does sound kind of porno all right

03:09:30.240 --> 03:09:34.200
that's porno I like it we promised we were gonna do it one more time so if

Over and over

03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:45.320
Waiting for a gentle rain

post-show things. I'm going home. Yeah, you know what, I gotta drive Secret back to the

03:11:33.180 --> 03:11:36.400
bay, so I think I gotta keep this kind of short, because it's a long drive home, but

03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:41.400
that's alright. Um, I don't mind. And you got a way home too, right Angel? Alright,

03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:47.420

03:11:55.700 --> 03:11:56.700

03:11:56.700 --> 03:11:59.060
did you want to just uh...

03:11:59.060 --> 03:12:02.360
give out your phone number over the air so that random strangers will call you

03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:03.700

03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:08.340

okay you guys have been doing the chat room has been grilling

03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:16.740
and i know they're like

03:12:16.740 --> 03:12:20.740
DDR Freak fans, or Orange Lounge fans, or fan fans.

03:12:20.740 --> 03:12:23.740
Hopefully both after tonight's show, that's the goal.

03:12:23.740 --> 03:12:28.740
But you guys were really patient, so I figured I'd give you one hint, because I'm nice.

03:12:28.740 --> 03:12:30.740
No way, you're actually able to give a hint?

03:12:30.740 --> 03:12:31.740
Totally giving one hint.

03:12:31.740 --> 03:12:34.740
Oh, wow. Okay, very sexy. All right, what is it?

03:12:34.740 --> 03:12:38.740
Okay, you guys might have to read into this a little bit. I know you're good at it, so it's okay.

03:12:38.740 --> 03:12:45.740
One new song in Extreme has steps.

03:12:45.740 --> 03:12:48.820
with up arrows.

03:12:48.820 --> 03:12:51.380
Wow.

03:12:51.380 --> 03:12:55.020
Up arrows. We don't see enough of them.

03:12:55.020 --> 03:12:58.140
Do not underestimate the power

03:12:58.140 --> 03:13:01.780
of that hint. I mean it might sound like

03:13:01.780 --> 03:13:04.940
there's gonna be a song with music in it. No, this

03:13:04.940 --> 03:13:08.140
is an actual hint.

03:13:08.140 --> 03:13:11.940
With up arrows. And we like up arrows, don't we?

03:13:11.940 --> 03:13:15.580
Although I have to say I'm partial to the right arrow or the

03:13:15.580 --> 03:13:19.320
up by the right diagonal on

03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:21.340
