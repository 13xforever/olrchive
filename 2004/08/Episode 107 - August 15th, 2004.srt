1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And now for our feature presentation.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani, and Bensum.

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,920
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

6
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,320
demons from hell!

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:04,320
Now you've seen that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,320
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Well, makes you look like an ass, is what he does, Ed.

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,320
Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,320
That was huge. Cool.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Catherine, the only thing you're gonna be riding is me.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
Have you seen Malcolm?

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Lena?

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,320
So it was you. I was going to expose you.

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
I know. So I choose to expose myself.

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Please, there are ladies present.

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Dark Sakura.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Skye.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:02:09,440
We are live and this is episode number 107 for this, August the 15th of 2004.

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,280
You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most unexciting radio station of all things B-Money.

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,840
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,960
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,040
farm, Ms. Jamie Summers.

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,520
You know her better as Dark Saffron.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,160
That was very anti-climactic, your little bee.

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
I know.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,000
But we're old.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We're old?

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I know.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You realize, you, me, Loki, we're about five years older than the Balmani average, right?

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If not, maybe ten.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We, we, I don't know if our show's ready for retirement or the nursing home or something.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We're still kicking.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm gonna turn our mics up just a tad. Do not adjust your volume on your own. Okay, we're up a little bit.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Um, what was I gonna say? Oh, you're ready to quit doing this show already?

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, okay.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I think you have to bring your hate to the master.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to quit for like five seconds. I quit.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Jamie! Jamie!

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, I don't quit anymore.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, good.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Funny enough, that's not the first time she's threatened to quit the show.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
When have I ever?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Ah, you know, I'm kidding.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Alright.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Also joining us is our third co-host, our third wheel, the tech master, Loki!

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hi! The mic is quite loud today!

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, that means you do not scream in it, you just talk like normal, there you go.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You got a loud voice, you got a loud man voice, you can take it away from your mouth a little.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The whole show is going to be like, oh I'm level.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How are you doing?

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You going to go?

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Alright, also joining us tonight, we have some very special guests.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
have somebody who hasn't been here in a few weeks he's always kind of here he's

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,880
like our mascot I think he's kind of like a mascot because he's here he

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,780
doesn't talk a whole lot but neither does the guy in the chicken suit at the

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,940
football game so I'm dubbing him our mascot it's Arcadian 42 yeah I had gas

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:24,780
today oops I'm in my car again yesterday can I get a go team go go stop stop

67
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:35,880
don't go anymore. Go, go, go, go. And where have you been, young man? In my apartment.

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,460
You missed a big show last week. Yeah, I didn't have a guest last week. We actually had like

69
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,720
a big show last week. I'm actually afraid to see how many people come back because last

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,760
week our show was dominated by this song, I don't know, this cure-ed song that I guess

71
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,320
was big or something. We had to play and there was tons of people here, so I'm kind of curious

72
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,080
how many actually come back to hear what the real train wreck sounds like tonight. Because

73
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:14,900
on tonight's platter, you guys, absolutely nothing! Alright. Alright. Anyway, also with

74
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,480
us tonight, the lovely DDR Angel is back this week. Hello! I have cheesed it. Yeah.

75
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Czestas, what kind?

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Uh, chugger and jack, I don't ask.

77
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Alright, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit more later.

78
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,480
We're going to definitely play some How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day when we come back, and then I suppose we're going to do some Bamani news too, we should take care of.

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Attention John Field, my name is not Jammie.

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Thank you, 1M please.

81
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Jamie will scold you if you want to join our chat room www.orangelaungeradio.com

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Click on chat and be paraded by the lovely dark chakra.

83
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Alright, in this break I thought we could do some booty-riffic music from DDR Solo 2000

84
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Cause I wanted to hear I'm Alive. We'll do some Don't Clock Me and maybe some Captain Jack too in this break.

85
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:11,480
in this break. So we'll be back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio.

86
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Baby, I'm alive, yeah, yeah

87
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
I love you, baby

88
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
The feelings all around me

89
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,480
I want you, baby, all night long

90
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
We're together

91
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
The dream has no ending

92
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Let's come together and sing our song

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,480
I can't say I love you, love you

94
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I wanna love you, love you

95
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I can't say I love you

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
I feel

97
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,700
But I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, baby I'm alive

98
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Yeah baby

99
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,680
Yes I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, baby I'm alive

100
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,520
I'm alive, I'm alive

101
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm alive, baby I'm alive

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Cause I'm a-la-la-la-la-alive Baby, I'm alive, a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on, baby Let's dream a dream together

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A dream that is real

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't die, don't die Don't die, don't die

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,500
It's the only way you'll be before you're making me free

107
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da

108
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Don't try to stop me, don't wait up and go

109
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't watch me, don't be, don't watch me

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't try to stop me, don't wait up and go

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Don't watch me

112
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,000
Crockin' like a nut, crackin' crust is a nut

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is a vice for my rifle when I'm on the cut

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
After end, you memorialize the state of your birth

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Back then you're like Gatorade when I'm quitchin' my serve

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm the fashionist at the end, you're the fable

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I touch it like my duty, just a record on the table

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm on a fox, get off the battleground

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're no master for the gods, I could beat you down

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:15,720
Just rock me, don't try to stop me Don't wait up and, yo

121
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Just clap for me, don't try to stop me Don't wait up and yell, don't clap me to

122
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,720
beat Just clap for me, don't try to stop me, yo

123
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Don't try to fly me!

124
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Bye-bye, baby.

125
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Yeah, two cents, yeah.

126
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Give us money.

127
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Give me money.

128
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,800
Actually, I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about putting a poll on the website next week.

129
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,300
You should go to our website and always take the poll and take old polls too, because polls

130
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
are important.

131
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,420
But remember, when you're done taking them, give them back.

132
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,560
What is this week's poll anyway?

133
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
I forget.

134
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Over on orangeontario.com.

135
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
I think it has something to do with Xbox.

136
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,320
I think it was about that quad mode, which we'll talk about later, that quad mode on

137
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
UltraMix.

138
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Yeah.

139
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,160
I want to know what you guys think about quad mode on UltraMix too.

140
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
talk about this later. We gotta go vote in our poll on orangeloungerator.com. There will

141
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,280
be a poll coming up soon about who wants to buy an orange lounge t-shirt, because I happen

142
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,720
to have a friend at work who has a friend that owns a t-shirt business, who can get

143
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,000
us some deals on t-shirts. I'm thinking about doing a little money making for the show,

144
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,520
so especially if we're going to have to raise that cap thanks to last week's show, so we'll

145
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,880
see. Nobody's locked out of the stream tonight though. Plenty of spots still available if

146
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,760
you have a friend who wants to listen to the show. Definitely. And if they don't want to

147
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,000
make them. That's right. And certainly, you know, there's all these past polls on the

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,680
site too that you can still go take. Then we'll see who wants a shirt. The polls are

149
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,320
fun. Yeah, the polls are fun. They're interesting. They are. In a poll-like way. Yeah. Not a

150
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,360
whole lot of sites that do DDR polling out there. I mean, of course there's DDR Freak,

151
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,240
but unfortunately we only get one new poll a month there. And who else does polls on

152
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,400
their site. I can't think of any. There's a few other, but they're not really

153
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,720
Bemani related. They're not us. That's the important thing. Yeah, they're not us.

154
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,720
So go support the Orange Laundrio poll. Of course, tonight, lots to talk about in

155
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,500
the Bemani world. I think what we're going to do tonight, because last week was kind

156
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,360
of dominated by Segerd being here among our other guests. Segerd might be back, by the

157
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,400
way. Segerd... He was cool. He should come back.

158
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,960
I don't know. Well, I mean, of course, he's been a longtime guest of the show. It's just

159
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,240
now people care who he is because he works for Konami, but... We always care about him.

160
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,280
We always loved him. We knew Seagurd when he was underground, okay? Yeah, we knew him

161
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,120
back in the days of his old nickname. We listened to him when he was underground. We saw him

162
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,920
dunk. Well, here's the thing is that the weekend he comes back, I don't know if I should say

163
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,160
what weekend he might come back, because it depends on work. Because, you know, they work

164
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,960
those Konami employees. Is this the weekend I'm thinking it is? It's the weekend that

165
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,920
Jamie might be going camping. Let me put it this way, it's the next weekend we're probably

166
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,920
going to do a dunk show? What would that be? When I'm going camping. Oh, you suck! Alright,

167
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,120
alright, we'll see, we'll see. I want to go... In two weeks we're doing a drug show, or at

168
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,680
least I'm doing a drug show. Do you have Monday offers? No, I'll take Monday off on my birthday

169
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:19,760
weekend. Oh, okay. Jamie will do... To celebrate the crashing of planes. If I'm here, I'll

170
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,120
I'll do a shot of tequila, but I'm not going to drink like I did last time.

171
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,680
You know how I drank last time.

172
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Yeah.

173
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Oh, yeah.

174
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Oh, yeah.

175
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
I remember that.

176
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,400
Tequila is not low carb.

177
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,200
So we'll have Seagrid back in a few weeks.

178
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,300
But since last week was kind of dominated by him being here, not only that, but us teasing

179
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,240
everybody with the Urine thing, and then we also had Pirate Power was here, and who else

180
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
was here?

181
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,820
Angel was here, and Anita.

182
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,380
So we kind of pushed all the Maimani news aside, except for the Uran thing, and hints.

183
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,920
The running gag last week was that everything was a hint.

184
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,480
So now we're actually going to go back and talk about some of the Maimani news from last

185
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,620
week and this week, because there's been a lot in the past two weeks.

186
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,620
A lot of Maimanias.

187
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
I did notice, though, general consensus.

188
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,740
I think a lot of people like the original better.

189
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
I don't.

190
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
I prefer the remix.

191
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,740
I do prefer the remix.

192
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,860
Did I have to say I like the original better?

193
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,740
I think it's certainly better suited for DDR.

194
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,440
Well, yeah, for DDR, but I mean as a song.

195
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,320
I think I like, I think it would just depend on the mood I'm in. Like, I think the original

196
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,280
works better in the scope of a Silent Hill soundtrack, but the new one works better for

197
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,440
a Dancy soundtrack, so. Well, true.

198
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,720
We'll play it, we'll play it again tonight, because I know some people may have missed

199
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,480
it last week, so we'll play it again tonight at some point. We won't make it wait two hours

200
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,240
this time, we'll play it soon. But I'll have some other songs we have to play too, because

201
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,440
you know, they announced a bunch of stuff for Ultra Mix, and some of you guys, even

202
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,840
though they're from 2DX, you haven't heard it before, so we definitely want to make sure

203
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,200
you hear this before the game comes out. Oh, Rob.

204
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,200
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

205
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm just getting out of the way early.

206
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Damn it. My prop isn't working. My baby won't work for you.

207
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,200
My prop isn't working. Oh shit. All my work is about to fall off the table.

208
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Throw me the baby. Hold on. Hold on.

209
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Whee! Babies. Alright. Anyway.

210
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,040
Moving on, we've got to get this out of the way though because this is how we start off

211
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
every show.

212
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,320
We have to talk a little bit about how was your week, how was your day, and starting

213
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,160
us off as always the lovely Dark Sakura is going to say how her week was and how her

214
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
day was.

215
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,480
My week was pretty dull, yeah it was just work, except that I started class on Wednesday.

216
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,560
I had my first orientation for one of my online classes and I took another orientation on

217
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,720
Saturday and dropped some really retarded class that

218
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,400
they're making me take, which was Intro to Windows.

219
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,200
When I found out what the last course was, I

220
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
dropped it so fast.

221
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,480
The last assignment in that class, Rob, is how to rename

222
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,320
and move files.

223
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
Wow, that sounds difficult.

224
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,720
That sounds really stupid.

225
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,440
I know five-year-olds that can rename files, OK?

226
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,960
So I dropped the class, and I'm going to

227
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,520
petition the dean next quarter uh... next semester to let me uh... test out

228
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,000
of it

229
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,100
i could do that with mike

230
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,560
you know windows three point one

231
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,120
way back when

232
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
i could rename files and dot

233
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,600
who

234
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800
so yeah

235
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,000
you remember i would remember who were using windows back when it was

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,120
underground

237
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,960
asher way back back when this little you know

238
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,640
kid and college thought he was brilliant and was going to make a different operating system.

239
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,400
Back when they were an indie band, you were using Windows.

240
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,560
But I'm going to, there's a bunch of classes I'm going to test out of because they're really

241
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,560
stupid.

242
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:07,040
And I'm also planning on going back to finish, I'm thinking about double majoring, so I'm

243
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,820
still sort of considering that but it's just been work school stuff a little bit

244
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:19,120
of a personal drama in my life not nothing major I've I've been kind of

245
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,320
stressed out so but I'm working on trying to stay positive trying to stay

246
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:33,280
happy trying to you know not erupt into random bouts of bitchiness over things

247
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:45,480
beyond my control I have a song to dedicate to you Jamie no why cuz it's no

248
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,320
more drama haven't you heard this song yeah it's from one of the stupid soap

249
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,840
operas well it's actually raps on the sample so hold on hold on let it kick in

250
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:03,160
here that is desperation okay that's almost as bad as when the Fuji's ripped

251
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:10,160
that Enya song. Okay? That's really, really bad. Really bad.

252
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,500
This definitely should be in DDR. I know a lot of people that could use that song.

253
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah, I don't think that there's anything really all that major that happened in my

254
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:31,220
I don't think that there's anything really all that major that happened in my week. Nothing of notable circumstance, so

255
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,980
Well, aren't you boring? I'm just kidding. Well, bite me

256
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,500
I'm just teasing you. You know, boring. It occurs since there was a curse that says may you live in interesting times

257
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,300
Interesting. There's also another one that says may the fleas of a thousand camels rest in your genitals, but I don't go through that one

258
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,420
I'm gonna pass on the mic.

259
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,160
Alright, moving on. Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week and her day was.

260
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,060
Angel. Hi, um, oh jeez.

261
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,620
Okay, here, hold on. Oh, Jamie wants to say one more thing. I broke Dan's main cabinet.

262
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,820
How'd you break it? Actually, I pulled the joystick thing loose from the thing

263
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,980
with my, uh... You pulled the thing from the thing? The joystick mechanism.

264
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,820
I pulled it, it's attached underneath the panel, and I pulled it loose

265
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
So it sunk into the panel.

266
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,820
Because his machine could not withstand my mad Street Fighter Alpha 2 prowess.

267
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
I see.

268
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,820
Anyway, hi.

269
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
Hi Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

270
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Pretty good. Just been working and stuff.

271
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,820
I signed up for classes yesterday.

272
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,820
So, oh my god, we're all going to meet in the cafeteria and be like lunchtime high school crap.

273
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Yeah, I guess so. Here, wait, let the, let the ferret talk for a second.

274
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,820
See, he likes it too.

275
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Okay.

276
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,820
I still want to set the ferrets on fire.

277
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,820
No! No! Anyway, um, yeah, so...

278
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
Maybe for Halloween.

279
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
Just work, and gonna be school soon, and...

280
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,820
I don't know, my life's pretty boring now that I'm up here.

281
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,820
But it's okay, I guess.

282
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,820
How has your last five weeks been?

283
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,820
Right on. That'd be good.

284
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
Which is nice.

285
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,820
Like, in a few months I get more money, so that would be good.

286
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,820
And not sitting at home all day every day like I usually do.

287
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Just go out to the stores and not play anything else.

288
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,820
Uh, I haven't played any Bimani in, like, a long time.

289
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,820
And because, uh, data entry all day doesn't really mess very well with the Beatmania.

290
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:19,820
the only thing I have at home that I can play anymore because I sold everything else.

291
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,820
Okay, and that's about all. Today I just sat around, watched a little bit of something

292
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,820
on tape that I taped a long time ago that I wanted to watch again, and then played on

293
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,820
play on the computer, and, came here!

294
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Exciting.

295
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Alright.

296
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
Loki!

297
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,820
Hey buddy, how was your week, how was your day?

298
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,820
Uh, I didn't do anything, just played Final Fantasy, and uh,

299
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,820
I was working on my cabinet because I got the new thing to fix it so there's no lag,

300
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,820
but, um, that didn't work too well so I need to rewire the whole damn thing,

301
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Which will, in the end, be better anyways, because it's a real mess as far as wires go.

302
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:12,820
And, um, I don't know. Just, like, sitting there at work and reading the internet, that's pretty much all I do.

303
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,820
Nothing interesting, I'm afraid. Damn, that would suck.

304
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Yeah, so what's up? Wow, am I the only one that actually tried to go play some DDR this week?

305
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:52,820
Which is what? I played step mania. I don't know if step mania counts. Step mania is not DDR. It is not DDR. No, that's a message to everybody. Step mania is not DDR. If you triple A something in step mania, it doesn't mean shit. Okay? Why? Why does it mean shit? Because I said so. Because it's not the same thing. Using your fingers and using your feet are two different things. But you're playing on a pad. If you're playing on a pad, it still doesn't count because step mania is not DDR and it's different timing.

306
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,500
You can actually make the timing exact so what do you have to say about that? I think it's a load of crap

307
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,780
It's still not DDR and you can buy me. So how was your week? Oh my week?

308
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,900
My week I spent making fun of Statmania people who say it's DDR. No. Ah continuation

309
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,100
I forgot to mention because I'm sure Rob want to talk about this anyways

310
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:25,100
The other thing I was doing this week is researching interdimensional communication and yeah, I'm going to build a device.

311
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Let me say that again for those that didn't catch it. Loki is studying interdimensional communication and he's going to build a device. What kind of device?

312
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
He's ripping in a portal to hell.

313
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,380
a germane

314
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,580
no it's a germane

315
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,420
no it's not a pearl to hell god damn it that's the same thing i said

316
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,700
i said he's building a vortex to hell is what he's making right now

317
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,980
this show is a vortex to hell

318
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,820
i am i'm basically uh...

319
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,020
recreating an experiment done by some guy who is now dead

320
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,420
and we know why

321
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,420
okay anyways

322
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,520
it's basically it's uh... it's

323
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,640
called a germanium communicator. The reason why it's called a germanium communicator is

324
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,360
because isn't a germanium what you keep gerbils in? It's a plant. You're trying to talk to

325
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:26,440
plants. No, I'm not germanium. People at my work do that. Germanium. Like german with

326
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,280
an i-u-m. Isn't that an element? Exactly. That's what it is. It's an element. It's like

327
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,020
one of the- Number 37 on the periodical chart, it has the same comp- or the same compounds

328
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:47,300
as, uh, silicon almost. You can make boobs out of it! Silicon, not silicone! God! Adding

329
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,400
letters to my stuff. Anyways, no, so I'm gonna buy- I'm buying an in-go of this stuff off

330
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,860
the internet since they don't really, you know, sell- which you can make by synthesizing

331
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,380
for the ore plus a fire crystal. Just for the record. And you say, I'm a Final Fantasy

332
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:09,980
addict. God. So I'm buying an Ingo of this stuff. Basically what it does is you use that,

333
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,580
you put pressure on it with some sort of screw that makes a focal point or whatever. Then

334
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,780
you wire that to two coils and run that to, you know, your stereo in jack. And you're

335
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:25,540
supposed to be able to then record the dead or the, you know, people on another dimension.

336
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:31,540
Anyways, this is an experiment. It did work, like, about ten years ago, so I don't see why it wouldn't work now.

337
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,540
I know everyone thinks I'm crazy, but I'm gonna laugh at you when it works. I'm gonna laugh at you.

338
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,540
How do you know if they're dead? What if they're really demons?

339
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,540
Well, here's the thing. What if you're picking up, like, a baby monitor upstairs or something?

340
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,540
I hear something noise.

341
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:53,540
Well, that's funny you should mention that, because this in no way can pick up radio waves or, you know, any sort of broadcast of that form.

342
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:00,260
it only picks up I think magnetic frequencies so sorry it doesn't work that

343
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:07,540
way you can't do radio do you have Final Fantasy 11 in hell no it's hell of

344
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,980
course we have it I will post in the chat room the website that I'm going to

345
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,980
they actually have recordings of this that's been done a while back and funny

346
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,980
enough the guy that was basically doing this who also won a Nobel Prize and has

347
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,820
a PhD in experimental sciences. All things that you don't have. All things that I don't

348
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,360
have. I don't fucking care, okay? Because what I don't have, I'm going to make better

349
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:39,580
because his device only had a small piece that was a 2mm by 3.5mm piece of germanium.

350
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,280
I'm using an inch by an inch piece of germanium. It's 25 times the size. I'm just multiplying

351
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,860
everything by 25. So are you an advocate that bigger is better? Notice how Loki has taken

352
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,840
what you do for cookies, like when you have too much cookie dough, you just double the

353
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,560
recipe for everything, right? He's taken that and now he's gonna multiply everything on

354
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,320
this talking to the dead communicator by 25. He's gonna build a vortex to hell, I'm telling

355
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
you.

356
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:19,760
So basically he's applying the math behind cookie dough to metaphysical communication.

357
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,920
Now what I suggested over dinner when Loki was telling us the first time is that we could

358
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,500
take this device to golf land and really mess with people.

359
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,200
Like I think we should hook it up so that it's in that area between the pad and the

360
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,920
screen so when little kids run in front of it, they have, zoop, they get sucked into

361
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
hell.

362
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:43,520
Okay, first off, like I said before, it's not a fucking vortex to hell.

363
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,120
That's another device to which I do not have the schematics for.

364
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,140
Can you build one of those? Because I really want to get rid of some of those people at

365
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,140
golf line.

366
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,460
Did you ever see the gate? You have to dig a hole in your backyard.

367
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,700
Okay, listen now. Honestly, seriously, I am, you know, interested in this stuff. I don't

368
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,740
know if it's a phase or something, but I am so fucking bored at work, I have nothing to

369
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,300
do. And this is what they're forcing me to do.

370
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,740
So first it's cursed dolls. Now it's communicating with the dead. You can touch your dolly!

371
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:23,460
That's what this is all about, is that Loki needs to talk to his dolls. Oh, you're a genius,

372
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,060
Jamie. First off, I don't have any haunted dolls because I forgot to bid on the goddamn

373
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:35,620
thing in the beginning. And second of all, okay, this doesn't have anything to do with

374
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:42,220
fucking talking to dolls, okay? God damn it. Don't you want to talk to the demon or dead

375
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,180
thing that possessed the doll? I'm loving this chat room feedback we have here. I thought

376
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,600
there already was a vortex to hell. It's called Roseville Golf Land. That's the Bomani. That's

377
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,620
where Bomani machines go to die. The Scandia is where Bomani goes to die. The Scandia is

378
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:04,260
where Bomani goes to die again. Like, re-death. Alright, listen now. Okay. This basically,

379
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,280
all this is right here, it's another form of EVP as I was talking about before, which

380
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,120
which is, you know, electronic voice phenomena. It's basically what happens is you can record,

381
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,240
you record voices that you don't hear. And they're done through, um, manipulation of

382
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,520
the diaphragm in a microphone. Basically, you can record things like, you know, that

383
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:30,080
normal humans can't hear. This would be like, they do this all the fucking time. Like, ghost

384
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,280
researchers and stuff, they record-

385
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
So they would be able to hear what dogs hear?

386
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,680
Not necessarily, but that's a theory of mine that that's why you know

387
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,320
You'll see dogs reacting to the Supernaturals because they can hear it or see it and we can't but anyways

388
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,000
That's not the point

389
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,040
The point is that this is a common you can anybody can go out there and do this and they don't even need to build

390
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
a device like this and

391
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,100
Don't even yet. Okay, anybody could do this with a tape recorder

392
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,760
They can do this and you can actually wire something up very simple with a germanium

393
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,760
It's a titanium diode that they supposedly sell at Radio Shack, but I sure as hell can find it today.

394
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Anyways, you can do that, and it will actually only record, um, just, you know, what you can't hear, and it will block everything else out.

395
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,760
And it's very interesting hearing people do that, and you get some really creepy shit on there.

396
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,760
But sure, mock me as you will. I will fucking send the vortex after you.

397
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Speaking of mocking Loki, we have a comment from the chatroom.

398
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
This is the best comment ever.

399
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,800
unknown neighbor says, Loki does want to talk to his dolls, he wants to talk to his final

400
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,160
fantasy figurines and see if Tifa and Yuna love him.

401
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,840
I don't even have dolls, and that's stupid.

402
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,160
He wants to talk to his chocobogos, see if his chocobogos work at him.

403
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Can I make a joke?

404
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Can I make a joke?

405
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Okay.

406
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,640
If you're able to build this machine and talk to the dead, will you be able to communicate

407
00:31:51,640 --> 00:32:03,640
it with Miss Cleo's career. Yes. You know what? Enough of this. I'm just reminded of

408
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,640
that scene from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. To hell with all you people. With all of...

409
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,640
No, no, don't say that. Don't say that, Loki, because you will do it. I know you will with

410
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:07,900
this machine. No, but like that scene when they're having the seance. Honestly, R

411
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,020
No! Don't say that!

412
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,420
Don't say that, Loki, because you will do it. I know you will with this machine.

413
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,820
No, but like that scene when they're having the séance.

414
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,900
Honestly, Ragh, how many things have I built that have actually worked?

415
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,020
That's a very good point.

416
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,900
You know what? In defense of Loki's little idea,

417
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,140
I'm supporting it. I'm curious.

418
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,180
Is this what we're calling it now? It's officially the

419
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,620
little idea? Your little idea.

420
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:42,620
I will support this. I'm interested to see how it turns out.

421
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:50,620
But I'm also wondering though, is it what you would use to record visual data?

422
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,620
Actually, they have that.

423
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,620
Really?

424
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,620
It's been done. And it's really strange how it works too.

425
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,620
It's basically everything revolves around white noise.

426
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,620
In this case, what they use, a common way they use to record it,

427
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,620
they have some other complicated devices, but the easiest way you can do it now

428
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:13,060
now. So you take a video camera and you record, you basically put the output onto a TV, then

429
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,080
you record that. And it creates interference because it's recording the same fucking thing

430
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,460
over and over. But in that, when you record that, you go back frame by frame, and you'll

431
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,780
actually see shit on there. And they have pictures of it that have been done. It's very

432
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,820
interesting. But the guy that did the experiments, he actually had his own device, because this

433
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:34,420
is like way back in the day when, you know, TVs and shit were fucking expensive, and,

434
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,780
you know computers are the size of football fields and whatnot we need to

435
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,940
have to take it like a billion magnets and put them in a room to make exactly

436
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,900
kill the pipe so so basically you know this is something he made a while back

437
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,260
and supposedly what happened was is later on people recreated this

438
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,140
experiment in the 90s the most recent I've heard of this experiment being

439
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,820
recreated was in 2003 I don't really know there's I guess for some reason

440
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,100
like for a few years they had no results recreating the same thing because there's a lot of other

441
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,820
factors that they can't figure in that they don't know what the hell, you know, why it

442
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,820
doesn't work or why it works. It goes to camera shy? No, it's not camera shy. It's complicated.

443
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,020
Anyways, I'll give you guys the websites. You can go look at it. You can think I'm crazy.

444
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,620
That's fine, but this is what I'm reading up on and I mean I'm not a real believer in

445
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,620
the paranormal and whatnot, but I'm a believer in science and, you know, they have scientific

446
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,920
proof to prove this they just can't explain it it's obviously beyond our

447
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,760
knowledge now so I don't know it just sounds interesting and if it's so easy

448
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,160
to recreate the experiment then you know why not but yeah I'm crazy but the thing

449
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,520
is though the guy there's another guy there's another guy to create this thing

450
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,360
called illuminator which is basically it's some sort of device that it it's

451
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,640
uses fans or something it blows water through rings of water or air through

452
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,320
rings of water I don't know how the fuck that happens but anyway supposedly that

453
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,160
creates a weird field or something if you photograph someone with that field

454
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,520
you'll actually see like someone else's face on theirs it's kind of weird then

455
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,960
the guy supposedly put three of these in like a triangle configuration and that

456
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,520
created the vortex you know that you were also talking about and he saw the

457
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,640
Triforce no but I was gonna ask something about the I was my train of

458
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,720
thought because I've made the Triforce joke never mind keep talking anyways I

459
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,960
will post the links in the chat room but there's some interesting stuff there's a

460
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,040
whole bunch of stuff on EVPs you can listen to they're really creepy look

461
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,800
sounding stuff but it's a lot of documentation on this there's a lot of

462
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,480
people recreate in the same way so I mean if they're you didn't a lot of

463
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,120
people that are getting these results, I mean, scientifically you can prove it.

464
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,840
Is it like the dead boy in Three Men and a Baby?

465
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,320
Uh, what? You know what I was thinking is that you should

466
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,120
take this whole little idea of yours and you should film it all and put it on like public

467
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,920
access TV. You could be the new Mr. Wizard. Wouldn't that be cool?

468
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:18,280
No. No, but, um, you know, their, I don't know, their results were just kind of, like,

469
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,800
weird, because the one thing that they were saying that's important about this is resonance,

470
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,880
and anyone that doesn't know what resonance means, that's just, like, for example, resonance

471
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,280
on a radio would be tuning in, because you have all the, um, frequencies out there, and

472
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,560
each station has its own frequencies, so you tune it to whatever station, and then you're

473
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,220
in resonance with that station when you're and you basically get audio that

474
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,380
way well the thing with this is you have to be resonance with your thoughts or

475
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,460
your basically your aura or whatever and that's the thing that's difficult

476
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,580
because it's not only you it's the people around you and those all affect

477
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,760
your environment plus you know other factors so it's a lot of complex shit

478
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,140
there but I don't know I'm gonna do it until I get bored with it and then then

479
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,700
I'm ready to talk about my week and my day now.

480
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,700
You got my joke.

481
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
What joke?

482
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,620
Didn't you ever see the thing about three men and a baby?

483
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
No.

484
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,620
Loki?

485
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
No.

486
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,660
About the one scene where they're walking in front of a window and there's a little

487
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,020
boy standing behind this curtain and he was supposed to have been like some ghost who

488
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,140
imprinted himself on the film.

489
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,220
He like blew his head off with a shotgun or something and then they walk by again and

490
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,720
I've seen it, the shotgun's there.

491
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
You're crazy talkin'.

492
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Oh, I had the movie on tape, I can show it to you.

493
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Bitch, please.

494
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,920
But I was, um, my friend was at a theater and said that it, well, I actually cleared

495
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,560
out the theater because everyone saw it and was freaked out by it.

496
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
That is strange.

497
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Three Minute Baby.

498
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,920
Oh, God, now you've got Loki on another thing.

499
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
It was in Three Minute Baby.

500
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,080
Now he's going to start inserting ghosts into movies.

501
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:00,360
Well, no, seriously, because he's, he's like, and you, you can fully see him there.

502
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,720
I wouldn't I wouldn't just say this if I have I mean

503
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,380
I'm sure that the logical thing is that it's some prop or something

504
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,440
But the other is that see

505
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Interesting didn't I tell you

506
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:21,100
It's like shows up several times. You put that link in our chat room for those that want to check that out. All right. Hey anyway

507
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,360
You're weak Rob. Yes my week. I actually went out and played DDR this week one night

508
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,060
I went to Roosevelt Golf Land, because my friend had never seen DDR before.

509
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,260
Well, I mean, actually he'd seen DDR, but he wanted to see me play DDR, because he hadn't seen, like, Extreme.

510
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,560
So I went, and I played, and I felt really stupid.

511
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,360
Like, I don't know how you guys feel about playing DDR for your friends for the first time,

512
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,360
when you're, like, pretty good at DDR.

513
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,760
Like, I can play at a maniac level, like I'm sure a lot of people listening to the show can.

514
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,660
And to those that don't really see DDR a whole lot, I think it really weirds them out sometimes.

515
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
I don't know maybe it's just me

516
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,900
But he seemed to get a kick out of that

517
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:06,460
but the thing was is that the up arrow on extreme was broken so like half my notes weren't registering and then I went to

518
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,460
try and play guitar freaks and

519
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,820
Frickin that machine was sucking too. So

520
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:17,080
The hell with that place money machines go to die, but I did at least go out to play the ER this week

521
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,740
I was gonna try and play at home, but my stupid ignition pads broken

522
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,060
So either I'm gonna have to buy a new ignition pad or Loki's gonna have to finish his DDR pads

523
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,460
But since he's too busy building vortexes to hell, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.

524
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,060
I was going to work on that. That's why I'm rewiring everything.

525
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,060
Sure. All right. We'll see.

526
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,060
Anyway, I guess that's pretty... I don't really have a whole lot to say about my week and my day.

527
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,060
It wasn't that exciting.

528
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I had a fine weekend. I went to a little gathering last night, and that was cool, I guess.

529
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:55,760
then two days ago, what did I do Friday night? I went out to a party with some friends and

530
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:03,820
then went to a bar. Isn't that exciting? That's it. Excitement is now. They have pinball machines

531
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:10,900
at this bar now though. Which ones? Uh, what was it, Monopoly? They have that everywhere.

532
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:17,460
And the one with the aliens in the hologram, Revenge of Mars. Ooh. Yeah. Cool. But it's

533
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,540
just kind of funny to see those that you know at a game are. If anybody in town happens

534
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:28,860
to find a Black Knight 2000 pinball, tell me. Cause Black Knight 2000 pinball is like

535
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,700
the most awesome pinball ever. Maybe they'll have one at the Classic Gaming Expo, which

536
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,860
you know we're going to be making an appearance at. Woohoo! Classic Gaming Expo, alright.

537
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,180
Cause I, um Konami is supposed to be doing something there. Yes, Konami is doing something

538
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,820
there. Some of our buddies at KDA are actually working the booth there. They're working a

539
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,820
I sort of know what's going on, but I think it's supposed to be a secret, so I can't repeat it.

540
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,820
It's a secret to everyone.

541
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,820
It's not Bamani related, but it's very cool nonetheless.

542
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,820
Unless we play track and field.

543
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,820
That would be cool.

544
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,820
That would be awesome.

545
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:05,820
Alright. But I definitely want to go. So we'll be making an appearance there next weekend.

546
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,820
It may affect next week's show, actually, but we're not sure yet. We think we might still have a show next weekend.

547
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,820
But Jamie's still going to be there.

548
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,820
Minus one.

549
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:24,820
I'm actually going to be there partly for the show and partly with my fiancé.

550
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
Right.

551
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,820
Well, we'll have to pre-tape the show if we decide to be at Classic Gaming Expo all next week.

552
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,820
So, we'll figure something out.

553
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,820
Alright.

554
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,820
I think what we do now is we're going to go to break.

555
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,820
And when we come back we'll actually talk about some Bahmani stuff.

556
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,820
There's been lots of Ultramix 2 news and DDR Extreme news this week.

557
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,820
Speaking of DDR Extreme, I think in this break we're going to play some music from DDR Extreme,

558
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,820
including, why not? We'll do Your Rain the Rage Mix again.

559
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,820
Let's start off.

560
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,820
That's right, we're going to start off with Your Rain the Rage Mix.

561
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,820
So enjoy Your Rain the Rage Mix, presented by Orangelaunchradio.com and Derspot.com.

562
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,820
We'll be back after this

563
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,820
And I don't know what I've found

564
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:47,820
Over and over I feel it break me down

565
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,820
I'm waiting for a gentle rain

566
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,820
A gentle rain, a gentle rain

567
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,820
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets just for a whisper

568
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:07,820
Busy people, going nowhere, seeing a joke in the rain

569
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,820
Nothing but passion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

570
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:21,820
Like a flower in a basement, waiting for our love again

571
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:49,820
Look at what you see Hey, the mirror of a dream

572
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,820
Never of a dream

573
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,820
Made believe I'm everywhere

574
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,820
Living in your eyes

575
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,820
Return on the pages

576
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,820
If she ever does do a

577
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,820
Never ending story

578
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

579
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,820
Never ending story

580
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,820
We are

581
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,820
Why'd you keep that secret

582
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,820
When I fall behind the clouds

583
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,820
There upon the rainbow

584
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,820
The answer to my terror ends

585
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:28,140
Okay y'all this is it, now pump it, the mic will sing as soon as I touch it, do this smooth

586
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,620
and easy like, so we might get hyped to hear tonight, she might, relax, and see from the

587
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,220
back, if you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap, that could smack

588
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,380
this my whoop if they jack, when I start no crap, give it a little bit of heart and soul

589
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,700
As we do it till you in your ear hole, huh I ain't goin' out like a sucka

590
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,380
And if you think so, boy, then pucker Off your chips, I better get clear and sit

591
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,380
It's slow and I might burn up this groove That you do move you

592
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,380
Fight people now, it's time to

593
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:30,380
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

594
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,380
Nooooooo!

595
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,180
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

596
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,580
Yes, mostly crap-free, except for this show, of course.

597
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,580
You are tuned into Orange Lounge Radio, and we are here with episode number 107.

598
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,580
I want to take a little break there talking about some new songs that are going to be

599
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,580
in D.R.

600
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,580
Extreme.

601
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,860
you know, not all new. Of course, Your Rain was new, but we have some old classics there,

602
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,700
Never Ending Story and Wonderland. I noticed this kind of seems to be happening quite a

603
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,020
bit where they're getting a lot of old songs and putting them in these new DR games we

604
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,780
have coming out. What else did we have in Extreme that was going to be in there? Well,

605
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:14,500
Only You, There You'll Be, Kick the Can, Don't Clock Me from Solo, like all these old-ass

606
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:21,400
songs. I think it's kind of cool though. Sugaru, that's kind of old now. I don't know. Dot

607
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:30,940
five nine. Alright. So we are here on Orange Orange Radio and kind of talking about some

608
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,800
news that happened last week. I wanted to talk about some things that happened while

609
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:39,260
we were here. We were doing that show last week but we were kind of sidetracked so we

610
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,760
didn't get to talk a whole lot about some of the news that had been going on last week.

611
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,920
I kind of want to bring some of that up now, including all this stuff that was going on

612
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,920
about 2DX Red.

613
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,320
Have you guys heard about this?

614
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:54,120
This 2DX 11th style, or whatever you want to call it, is now kind of a project named

615
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:00,200
2DX Red, and it's got all these different songs in there, a new DJ Simon song, Back

616
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,480
to the Dance Floor, new Orange Lounge songs in it, new Naoki song, and all this stuff

617
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,260
in 2DX Red, and supposedly there's this really, really hard song that's in it, that has this

618
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,260
really hard note pattern and actually one of my buddies was kind enough to

619
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,260
send me a video of it so I'll show you guys kind of what this looks like now

620
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,140
he's playing it on random in this video and I know this is gonna be great radio

621
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,700
but at least you can hear the song a little bit but the song is called

622
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:32,100
gigadelic gigadelic and let's see if we can get a little bit of what it looks

623
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,460
like here that's kind of what the interface looks like pretty yeah it's

624
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,460
Very pretty, isn't it?

625
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,460
Oh, they're using the towel method.

626
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,460
Yes, they are using the towel method. Explain what the towel method is.

627
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,460
It...

628
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,460
I will, I guess, read just your eyesight or something in the way you can read it easier.

629
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,460
Let me show you what the end of the song looks like here.

630
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,460
Actually, that part doesn't look so hard, but...

631
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,460
There you go.

632
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,460
Kind of a crazy song in the end there.

633
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,460
I like the video.

634
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:08,460
It looks like they've made the interface a lot prettier, that they have the bars.

635
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:14,460
Basically what they did in 2DX Red, I noticed, is that they took one half of the screen.

636
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,460
You remember when you would play 2DX, the side, if you were just in one player mode,

637
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:25,460
the other half of the screen would have nothing, like it would just be a blank place for notes to fall.

638
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,460
What they've done is they've kind of done the keyboard mania thing.

639
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,460
I don't know how many of you guys have played keyboard mania, but keyboard mania had two monitors.

640
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,660
monitors. And if you were playing it just in one player mode, it would show you like

641
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,900
a little bar on the other side that would show you like how you were doing with your

642
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,700
combo and stuff. It's not quite that what they're doing in 2DX Red, but they've taken

643
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:46,700
it and now it's showing a graph of your score compared to the top score on the machine.

644
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,860
So I thought that was kind of cool is that you'd have a little bar that would go up as

645
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:56,220
you did really good or really crappy on the song. So I thought that was kind of neat.

646
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,180
So that's something that's going to be new in 2DX Red.

647
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,660
So I don't know when this game is supposed to be out, but it looks kind of exciting.

648
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:08,240
So there's some old news on 2DX Red on our website, of course, if you want to check that

649
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,940
out over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

650
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,580
Also something we kind of had to gloss through real fast last week, Loki, and you've had

651
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,020
a chance to really sit down with us now, we've had another week go by and play this, what

652
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,940
about Food Mix?

653
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,940
There was a Food Mix Plus release last week.

654
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,940
It was fucking awesome, that's all I have to say.

655
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:37,940
There was about 15 new songs that they added, brand new interface, brand new non-stop O&E courses, and it's beautiful.

656
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:45,940
They made what Food Mix was before, which was really awesome, and made it even better. It's just really kickass.

657
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:53,940
From what I hear, though, the double steps leave a little bit to be desired, but their single steps are awesome, because I haven't gotten to play doubles yet.

658
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,940
But really beautiful, awesome, brand new videos. Just really awesome.

659
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:10,940
They've got a lot of nifty stuff that you can do now in StepMania. Like, for instance, the results screen has a type of graph that you would see in BeatMania where it shows you how you did and everything, and your combo and all that.

660
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:35,940
I noticed something interesting they did with the movies is that they put a watermark of the song name in there, like at least that one for Made in Innocent that had the anime girl in it and stuff. They kind of put a watermark on the movie. Was there an issue where some of their movies were being pirated on other step files or something?

661
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:42,940
No, it was just a little cool thing in the bottom. That's all. It was just for the one song. It just looked cool.

662
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:51,940
But, um, it was just, um, they actually, what I like about them is they use video and, you know, still images just like you would in, uh, BMS files.

663
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:57,940
Because, I mean, these guys are coming from BMS files, and just the animations that they do in that are just awesome.

664
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:09,940
I really wish a lot of the US people would go and start doing BMS sim files first and then going to DWIs, but it's just amazing the amount of work that they put in these.

665
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,940
But it was just the maiden innocent that had that? I thought I saw it on another one.

666
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,940
Alright, so I'm going to crack. I don't care.

667
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:38,940
There's a few of them that say Foon Mix Plus in them, but that's about... I mean, so what? Who cares?

668
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:49,940
It's just awesome. That's pretty much it. They just have really awesome stuff. Like I said before, a lot of the music that's actually featured on there is going to be on Diverse 7, which you can find.

669
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,940
And that comes in three different varieties, which I can talk about now or later either way.

670
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,940
Sure, why not?

671
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:02,620
transition into that. Anyways, Diverse System 7, which is out I think now, or pretty soon

672
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:07,300
either way, they've got a bunch of different ways you can get this, and I'm not sure, now

673
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,220
what I'm gathering from this, because it's all in Japanese, is that they either have

674
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,660
three CDs, and I think two of them are BMS files, which are basically your BeatMania

675
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:21,780
sim files, and they're really awesome. Like, for instance, we'll go down with FiveKey and

676
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,720
what they have on there we have a remix of super highway called super highway

677
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:33,120
the cafe electro mix by a guy named Oni or only I should say a remix of what's

678
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:38,640
next with song title what with a bunch of question marks at the end there by a

679
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:46,200
guy named new keep on moving romantic blue style by a guy named Teo we've got

680
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Gnaw, which is a remix of Area Code, and we've got a Ska, The Good Mix, that's a Ska, A Go Go remix.

681
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Ninja Blast, Hayabusa Mix, which is a remix of Overblast.

682
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Acid Bomb, the Overdosing remix is a remix of Acid Bomb.

683
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Slash Tracks, which is a remix of Thrash Tracks.

684
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,900
Recycle, a remix of Cycle by Splunker, which is awesome. He's done some really

685
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:25,600
good stuff. SDZ, which is The Gleam, which is a remix of SDZ. I'm not

686
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,120
familiar with that one. And then, oh man, I'm gonna fuck this up.

687
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:36,280
Notch Musik, which is You Gotta Groove remix, and that's of course a remix of

688
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:41,240
You Gotta Groove. And then Seven Keys, some of the other ones that they have on

689
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:46,360
here they have a remix of murmur twins the oh hey we've got some demo mp3s here

690
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,080
but uh I'll get those later we could play them maybe during a break or

691
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:58,560
something anyways murmur twins the 460 beat mix reality the alpha 0.2 mix some

692
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:04,800
other song in Japanese bad boy bass the switch back to 93 remix maiden innocent

693
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:12,040
which is featured in Food Mix Plus. I just hope that Bad Boy Bass remix has that sample

694
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,200
still in it. One more time with the Bad Boy Bass. One more time with the Bad Boy Bass.

695
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:25,600
I'm sure it will. YSQ, let's see, number one, or number 12.8, Holix, which is also in Food

696
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:32,480
Mix Plus. Love Heart Sign. We have X2, which is a G2 remix, also in Food Mix Plus. And

697
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,420
Small Voyager which is obviously a remix of the big Voyager and then they have

698
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:44,340
one last one which is other mixes and that's Timepiece Phase 2 High

699
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:49,820
Transparency Mix which is a one phase blues I think a remix. Healing

700
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:56,000
Vision remix which is just that. Over the Drive, Mirrorball Satellite 2004 which is

701
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,260
in the original Foon mix. That sounds awesome because that's an info song. Yeah

702
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:16,260
Yeah, and it was pretty good. Then there's a few other ones I'll see here. Yamadajet, Coaster Girl, which is a Yamadajet remix. It's kind of funny. Implantation, DVMix, Lamb of God, Trip Machine, Dark Core Mix, and some other ones.

703
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:26,260
But I'm going to get some of these demo MP3s and we can maybe play them on a break or something, because they're usually about 30 seconds long, so we'll get a bunch of different songs there.

704
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,260
Sure, that sounds like fun. Why not?

705
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:53,260
I'm going to change gears here because I want to talk about Ultramix 2 because the Ultramix 2 news has been flying really fast this week. There's been a lot of new stuff announced for Ultramix 2 within this week and last week and that's including some songs. Some new songs have been announced for these games so I want to see if we can address what some of those songs are.

706
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:56,740
Some things that have been figured out is that

707
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,140
we got some early songs have been announced for UltraMix 2 including

708
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,140
321 Stars by DJ Simon

709
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,500
A by DJ Amuro and B4U by Naoki which were all

710
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,500
if I remember right in the E3 demo so none of that's a surprise but get this

711
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,340
here's your first licensed song

712
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,620
from UltraMix 2, Brick House by the Commodores

713
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,780
Isn't that crazy? Is it

714
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,860
like a remix of it? No, it's the original. She's a brick

715
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,860
Oh, cool. Yeah, that's going to be cool.

716
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:28,660
I wish I had a clip of that so I could play it for you guys. It's pretty cool.

717
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,980
And Dead End by NNS. Drop out, NW260, LeadingCyber, DJ Taka,

718
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:39,380
LoveHeartShine, Coscariu, Make a Jam, U1, Make Your Move, Good Cool, featuring JP

719
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,900
Miles, Max Unlimited is going to be in it. Then we get into some more

720
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,420
licenses we haven't had in the US yet. Moonlight Shadow

721
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,780
by Missing Heart from Fifth Mix. Very popular license track.

722
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,940
Yeah, very popular license track, getting a lot of people really geared up for Ultra

723
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,980
Mix 2, very happy about that.

724
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,620
My summer love, Night in Motion, which was actually a license track.

725
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:06,780
A lot of people think that that is a Konami original, but it was actually a license track

726
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,740
from DDR4thMix.

727
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:12,700
And you would know this song, definitely, because it has that really catchy hook at

728
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,700
the beginning of it.

729
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,700
Here's a little bit of it.

730
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:21,540
Wait, let me get a little bit of the hook here.

731
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:36,020
Everybody knows that song, all right, so that one's going to be in a DDR Ultra Mix.

732
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:41,860
Right on the Light by Mr. T. Now wait a minute, that's a 2DX song that's being ported over

733
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,860
for DDR.

734
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,860
That's cool.

735
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:48,100
So that is something brand new that we've never had in DDR before, and it doesn't stop

736
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,100
there.

737
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,900
Um, Route 80s by Sampling Masters Mega.

738
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,900
Cool.

739
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,900
From DDR.

740
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,900
The attention.

741
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,900
Attention.

742
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,900
Yeah.

743
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,900
We're actually gonna play some of these songs.

744
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,900
For those of you that haven't heard them.

745
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,900
Do it for the next break.

746
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,900
Yeah, we'll do that in the next break.

747
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,780
We're gonna play some of these songs for those that haven't heard them before.

748
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,980
Star Mine by Ryu from 2DX4 style.

749
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,980
You remember that?

750
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,020
With Tran with the little fan in a doo doo doo doo doo.

751
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,500
Star Mine will be fun.

752
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:20,980
going to be very fun on DDR. Well, this is the interesting thing is that they have said

753
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:27,100
in the thread that different people are doing the steps than did them for UltraMix 1. So,

754
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:32,420
you're not going to see steps like you saw in UltraMix 1. And supposedly they have people

755
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:38,820
that know their stuff on DDR that are making these steps, so. So it's not Konami of Hawaii?

756
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:49,820
Well, I don't think they really said one way or the other. I haven't been keeping tabs on the information thread, and also I don't want to cross the line from what I've been told.

757
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:59,820
Yeah, I can't. I don't know what I can say and what I can't, so I'm just going to move on to the next song, which is from 2DX, VJ Army by Good Cool.

758
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,820
Now that's cool. VJ Army will be fun.

759
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:05,500
army is going to be fun. A lot of people have said that should be in DDR for a long time,

760
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,020
so that's very cool that that one's going to make it in there. So, it's okay, if you've

761
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,600
never played 2DX and you've never heard these songs before, we're going to play them for

762
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,380
you in the next break, so you can get a feel of what you're going to be dancing to pretty

763
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:23,860
soon. God dammit, does that mean I have to buy an Xbox? This is very interesting. When

764
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:29,020
Ultramix 2 was first announced, a lot of people were like, yeah, whatever. Cause I think Ultramix

765
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:34,020
was very successful for those that already had an Xbox, but it didn't really convert

766
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:38,800
a whole lot of people. I'm an exception, I did buy an Xbox pretty much so I could play

767
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,880
UltraMix, UltraMix and Halo. This new one's sounding like it's going to be a big selling

768
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:47,640
point. But this new one, Microsoft should be sucking Konami's cock for this one, seriously,

769
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,480
because they're going to sell a lot of Xboxes with this mix, I think, based on DDR fans

770
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:57,620
alone, because... Microsoft better put out. Seriously, Microsoft should be putting out...

771
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:02,260
I don't know, maybe I should put a poll up over and see how many people are

772
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,660
seriously contemplating buying an Xbox just because of UltraMix 2. Because a lot of

773
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,700
people were saying

774
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,900
when UltraMix 2 was first announced, yeah, yeah, yeah, great, UltraMix 2, yeah, whatever,

775
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,300
you know, Xbox people will enjoy it. But now that the song list is starting to come out and

776
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,100
people are like, whoa, we're getting Moonlight Shadow and

777
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,060
these 2DX songs that have never been in DDR before.

778
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:26,300
Actually, I have to agree with Kyle in the chat room. I think I actually

779
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,300
I wouldn't mind seeing Get On Beat Wildstyle.

780
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:31,300
Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing the original Get On Beat.

781
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,300
Well, this certainly is not the full list.

782
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:37,300
This is just what we know so far about UltraMix 2.

783
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:40,300
Or Lab. They need to put Lab.

784
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Here's one thing I think is kind of different about UltraMix 2.

785
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,300
They just announced this this week.

786
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,300
There's going to be a brand new dance mode in UltraMix 2.

787
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:55,300
What makes an Xbox different than a PlayStation 2?

788
01:01:55,300 --> 01:02:01,060
the other than the obvious Microsoft and it has you can store a small family

789
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:06,380
inside of it besides that it has a really big hard drive and four port ah

790
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:11,620
it has four ports as opposed to two which means what you can plug in four

791
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:16,660
dance pads you don't need a multi tab yeah you don't need a multi tab but no

792
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:21,140
now you can plug in four dance pads at once and you can play a brand new mode

793
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:25,140
The code called Quad Mode is going to be in Ultramix 2.

794
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,140
How four? Wow!

795
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:32,140
It's going to be four... No, it's four pads. It's a whole new set of steps for one person on four pads.

796
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,140
It's doubles doubles.

797
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,140
Evil.

798
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:40,140
So you could have arrows that take you all the way from pad number one, way on the left, to pad number four.

799
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:44,140
And a lot of people were talking about, well, what's the configuration going to be?

800
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:47,140
Because if you think about Tetris, you could have four squares a lot of different ways.

801
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,140
It's going to be one giant line.

802
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,900
I'd have to say that I copyrighted this about two years ago, they will be hearing from my

803
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,900
lawyers.

804
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:59,620
Okay, because I was making edits for two machines that use all four panels.

805
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,460
Two different sets of edits to play one song.

806
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,980
That was my quad mode.

807
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:08,020
God damn it, they stole it from me.

808
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,700
I actually remember doing something like this.

809
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,700
Like I remember one time in Arcade Infinity starting two machines at the same time to

810
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,460
do some kind of like quad thing.

811
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,460
but I don't remember what the joke was, but there was something we were trying to do.

812
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,740
But yeah, but you know what? What does it seem like happening with this mix though?

813
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,260
With the song list and

814
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,060
it looks like they're listing their fan base a little more, so I wouldn't be

815
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:29,740
surprised

816
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,380
if they did look out there and see that maybe there are people, crazy as they

817
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,100
might be,

818
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:38,020
that want this quad mode in DDR. Now, me personally, I'm kinda like,

819
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:41,420
well I think it's a nice idea, like the quad mode, I think it's kinda cute,

820
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,620
but who's gonna have four dance pads? It's innovative, I'll say that.

821
01:03:45,620 --> 01:04:00,620
But then, okay, here's the argument to that, is that quad mode is only going to be available in something called the party mode on UltraMix 2, so it's obviously set up for DDR parties, I mean, as cheesy as that might sound, where your friends bring their dance pads over to your house, so now you have four dances.

822
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,620
Or maybe it's going to be something cool, like two people can play doubles.

823
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:05,620
Well, I don't...

824
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:06,620
They have doubles versus, sorry.

825
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,620
Yeah, you can do doubles versus, apparently, as well.

826
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,620
That's right.

827
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:14,240
I think that was something in UltraMix 1, but yeah, now you're gonna be able to have this quad mode

828
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,420
So a whole new set of steps and it's not just once they are doing beginner light

829
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,620
Medium heavy whatever the hell they call it these days

830
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,300
No, I think they said it was gonna be a full for beginner light standard and heavy

831
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:32,600
I'd have to relook through but I'm almost positive. They said it was gonna be a full new set. We'll see

832
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,940
so

833
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,880
That's very interesting, huh? I want them to do

834
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:45,880
Do another best hits on Xbox and bring out the individual mixes on one DVD.

835
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,880
The old arcade mixes.

836
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,880
But remember, the US isn't Japan.

837
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,880
Unless they put it out for Japanese Xbox, but they'll never do it because Xbox wasn't really popular over there.

838
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,880
It's still in stuff.

839
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,880
But not quite the prevalence it has in the US market. Let's put it that way.

840
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,880
I don't think that it would be neat so that I can, you know, not have to break out my Dreamcast every time I want to play Second Mix.

841
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,880
Well, they do have Second Mix on PlayStation.

842
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,880
You can go to that bowling alley in Auburn.

843
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,880
There you go.

844
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,880
Let's see, what else?

845
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,880
Multiple players on, this is another interesting thing about UltraMix 2.

846
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,880
Now you can have multiple players on one Xbox going onto Xbox Live to play.

847
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:34,880
So now you don't have to be, you know, you have to stay home, you can, it's kind of going more into the multiplayer and party functions where you can have multiple people over.

848
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:50,880
The song list will contain 70 songs not including the song packs, which means that if you buy your song packs from service pack 1 through 6 for UltraMix 1, you can use these on UltraMix 2.

849
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,880
So think about this, that's 30 songs between service packs 1 through 6, right?

850
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,480
I speculated this while somebody was out of town.

851
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,800
I do believe I did.

852
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
Yeah.

853
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
Yeah.

854
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,800
Wow.

855
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,800
There you go.

856
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:09,160
But that's going to be 100 songs playable in UltraMix from the start.

857
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,160
Crazy.

858
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,160
Alright.

859
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,760
Thank you, Konami.

860
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,760
We love you.

861
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,120
And there's going to be inside that 14 Konami original DDR songs, so we kind of saw some

862
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,480
of those, Star Mine and all that stuff.

863
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,800
So that's going to be very interesting.

864
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,680
Very, very interesting.

865
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,640
But they are going to have this downloadable edits thing, which I'm kind of curious how

866
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,640
that's going to work.

867
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,840
If like anybody can submit edits, or if they're going to have some kind of screening process

868
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,200
where they only take like good edits or what they're going to do.

869
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
It'll be very interesting.

870
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,240
Oh, and Panda, I do believe the Xbox is region coded.

871
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,240
Is it?

872
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,960
Yes, I do believe it is.

873
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,440
Very interesting.

874
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,080
I'm kind of excited to see this mix now.

875
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,860
I know it's been difficult in the past to get excited about anything Xbox, but boy they're

876
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:57,380
really doing DDR right on there I say I'm looking forward to it how about you

877
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,620
Jamie what do you think about this UltraMix 2 so far this is just so far

878
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:04,340
get it we still haven't heard everything about it yet what I'm gonna get it you

879
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:08,460
know I'll have it even if I played or not I have UltraMix 1 that have you

880
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,900
know my UltraMix 1 is unopened really it is because I never had time because

881
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,060
by the time I got around to playing it I was doing other things well at least you

882
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,780
bought it oh yeah I have it I have that dance pad everything but it'll give me a

883
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:27,780
a good excuse to break it out and start downloading the song packs.

884
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:53,780
Sounds like something you'll go over to somebody else's house and play?

885
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:54,780
Yeah.

886
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,780
Alright, fair enough.

887
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,780
What about you, Angel?

888
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:05,780
Maybe, but I'm afraid that if I ever decided to get one, Magus would kill me.

889
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,780
He just has this thing against Xbox, I guess.

890
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,780
But it's CDR, he'll get over it.

891
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,780
Yeah, he should get over it because he's a Halo addict.

892
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,780
There you go, so you can play Halo on it, too.

893
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:18,780
Okay, you know what? I want to know how his opinion should affect you buying something you want.

894
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:21,460
Ooh, slam.

895
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,580
I guess you could get over it.

896
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:26,260
So maybe I will.

897
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,660
I don't know.

898
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:28,980
Damn straight he'll get over it.

899
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,580
If you want an Xbox, you should get an Xbox.

900
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:32,500
He'll just have to live.

901
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,180
Interesting comment from the chat room.

902
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,980
And I'm not sure if I'm reading too far into this.

903
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,040
But truthfully, it's going to be only those

904
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,380
that don't know about the Sims that will get the Xbox,

905
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,380
says John Fields.

906
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,760
The others will download the steps

907
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,300
that they have for every mix.

908
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,100
But again, I go back to what I said earlier.

909
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,100
step mania is not ddr

910
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,100
and i don't think the step mania is going to have

911
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,100
xbox live

912
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,420
it doesn't have xbox live

913
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,340
it does not have xbox live

914
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,940
but but that ok but there

915
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:05,940
they're saying rumor is that they're going to have an internet thing whatever

916
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,100
i know that's what i said

917
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:11,740
do they have step mania online already i've never seen you play it

918
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,460
because i just don't care

919
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:15,460
But they already have step mania online

920
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,780
Well, I don't know I'm still I couldn't get that stupid thing to work

921
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:28,380
Working on it. I just I think the person looks like is already up. I think the percentage

922
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,620
Did you say X likes live?

923
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:37,660
I just think it's such a small percentage of people that would that would opt out of

924
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:39,180
Ultramix to for step me

925
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:43,140
I think that's why Konami hasn't sued the pants off a step mania yet is because it's gonna be such a small

926
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,640
or percentage of people that it's really negligent. Remember the DDR community that you see online

927
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,040
and in chatrooms and stuff is not the scope of the DDR community as a whole.

928
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,940
And there's going to be people who go, oh look it's another game for the Xbox that's

929
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:02,280
going to get my, you know, couch potato kid off of his ass. You know, I've talked to plenty

930
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:07,500
of parents, you know, who go into, you know, Gamestop and say, oh well this is going to

931
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,380
keep my kid from being, you know, lazy.

932
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:13,380
All right, I'm actually going to open up the Skype line because I'm curious what some folks

933
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,560
out there think about UltraMix 2.

934
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,020
I especially like to hear from people who are contemplating buying an Xbox over this

935
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,600
whole thing and so we'll open up that Skype line.

936
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,880
If you want to call us, we have some information on our website, but just go to Skype.org and

937
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,040
download the client there.

938
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,040
It's a free client.

939
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,040
It's a free program.

940
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,480
All you have to have, you have to have a broadband connection and a microphone and just add Orange

941
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,480
lounge radio all one word to your contact list and you will be able to

947
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,760

01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,760
I am.

949
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,760
Oh, he's disguising his voice because he doesn't want his friends to find out he listens to this show.

950
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,760
Don't be embarrassed. We won't bite. Much.

951
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,760
What do you think about UltraMix 2?

952
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,760
It's okay.

953
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,760
It's okay?

954
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,760
Yeah.

955
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,760
Was there any songs that you're getting really excited about that you're going to be able to play?

956
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,760
Moonlight Fucking Shadow.

957
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,280
moonlight fucking shadow is the word hey

958
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,340
unknown gamer if you can turn up your mic volume on your end a little bit

959
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:39,100
so we can hear you a little better

960
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:43,420
but he says moonlight fucking shadow why moonlight shadow

961
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,700
because i'm fucking obsessed with erotics

962
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,980
because he's obsessed with erotics

963
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:52,780
uh... huh i see how it is okay are you like stalker obsessed

964
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:55,420

965
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,180
very hot

966
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,340
that hot

967
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,820
do you have do you already have an xbox

968
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:00,820
No, I do not.

969
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:01,820
No, you do not.

970
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:02,820
Are you thinking about getting one?

971
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,820
Yes, I am.

972
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,460
That is obsession.

973
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,460
Just because of Moonlight Shadow?

974
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:08,460
Yeah.

975
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,380
Now, that is an obsession.

976
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,380
That is definitely an obsession.

977
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,980
You could get one of the nifty green Halo ones.

978
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,980
That's what I bought.

979
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:15,980
Oh, there you go.

980
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,600
If you like us, have a green one.

981
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,820
They don't make them in hot pink erotic flavor yet.

982
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,820
Damn it.

983
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:21,820
Maybe soon.

984
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,660
Okay, I don't think that erotic flavor would be hot pink.

985
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,340
I think it would be blood red or something.

986
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,340
It would be sex.

987
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,340
It would be milky colored.

988
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,340
It would be like purple.

989
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,340
We have to clarify something for folks in our chat room because people are going,

990
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:36,340
Wait a minute, Moonlight Shadow is an erotic song?

991
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:39,340
Actually, do you want to explain this one unknown game or you want me to?

992
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:43,340
Do you want me to explain it with the way my microphone sounds right now?

993
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,340
Okay, yeah, you're right. I better explain it.

994
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:53,340
Alright, so the reason why Moonlight Shadow is tied to erotic is that actually the old lead singer from erotic

995
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:57,980
went and she joined this new band called missing heart she kind of went off on

996
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:01,940
her own and did this missing heart so that's why it gets tied back to erotic a

997
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,940
lot because it's the same vocalist that you hear in a lot of the old erotic

998
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:10,420
songs so that's why moonlight shadow it kind of has ties to erotic it's just

999
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:14,580
but the only difference is that she's not going carried away by a moonlight

1000
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:43,580
I'm gonna type to you the story of what happened and then you just tell people what happened.

1001
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:47,040
typing it to me and I'm gonna tell people what happened so I'm gonna wait

1002
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,540
for that. And I'm gonna work on getting a microphone that doesn't suck. All right you do

1003
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:55,800
that and then you call us back. Yeah. But thanks for calling us. Oh I like that. You

1004
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:05,600
have a good one. You too. Bye bye. I need dessert. I want dessert. I have some diverse system

1005
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,440
seven tracks I would like to play. What no wait we have to wait for those

1006
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,100
because we're getting another call real fast. No I'm gonna take this call.

1007
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,100
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1008
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,100
Hello.

1009
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,100
Hello.

1010
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,100
He wants some ZZ7 tracks.

1011
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,100
He does not want to...

1012
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,100
Can you...

1013
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,100
We cannot hear you.

1014
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,100
Please speak up.

1015
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,100
Aww, bummer.

1016
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,100
Uh, call us back when you get your mic thing rearranged.

1017
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,100
Yeah.

1018
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,100
Alright.

1019
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,100
That's too bad.

1020
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,100
Okay, hold on.

1021
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,100
I'm getting the story with Moonlight Shadow here.

1022
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,100
Oh, I thought I was.

1023
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,100
Alright, we'll get that.

1024
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,100
Alright, fine.

1025
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,100
No, I don't want to.

1026
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:18,580
different, but it's pretty cool nonetheless. Anyways, here we go.

1027
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:28,400
Oops, gotta take that off there. Okay. Anyways, the next one, real quick, is a Trip Machine

1028
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:34,680
Dark Core mix, and my God, I have to say, this is for Trip Machine what P8107 was for

1029
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:41,680
paranoia. So, it's gonna be fucking awesome, that's all I gotta say.

1030
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:10,380
Two things to love, two things to destroy

1031
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:15,380
Two things to love, two things to destroy

1032
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:22,180
Two things to love, two things to destroy

1033
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,880
Two things to love, two things to destroy

1034
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:32,880
Two things to love, two things to destroy

1035
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:48,520
Okay, and then, um, one that's really cool, I don't really know what exactly this is,

1036
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,480
it's um, it says it's Reality Alpha 0.2 mix, it sounds like what it is, it's just a bunch

1037
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,920
of different songs kind of mixed in the one, which is still kind of cool, but um, it's

1038
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:04,920
it's pretty hardcore so check it out

1039
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,920
Go!

1040
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,920
Go!

1041
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,920
I will take it!

1042
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,920
Yeah!

1043
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,920
Yeah!

1044
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,920
I'll take it!

1045
01:18:51,920 --> 01:19:09,800
Ok, so that was a few of those.

1046
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:13,440
So if they want to order this album of all these Bhumani remixes, although we'll be playing

1047
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:18,280
them on Diversions Monday night, where can they go to order the CD?

1048
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:32,280
Well, Diverse Systems, that's www.diverse.jp, I don't think they're up for sale yet. I think, usually they have their own English page, which, you know, they sell most of their CDs, but it's not on there yet.

1049
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:44,280
So, I remember before, they did wait a little bit before they were available for the US. I don't know, you know, whether they're getting, you know, taking care of the Japanese first or whatnot.

1050
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:49,160
there's I don't know when exactly these are going to be up right now it's

1051
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:54,960
checking right now you can purchase them they have a few links on the right hand

1052
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,000
side where you can purchase them from and I don't know why they're selling them

1053
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,080
there dojinshi sites so you can get those there but right now available from

1054
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:11,200
their site they don't have them yet so I'm looking to see right now if it's on

1055
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:17,860
their ordering page no actually it is on their Japanese ordering page but not in

1056
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:22,140
their English ordering page you might be able to I don't know you can Mike might

1057
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:25,140
be able to send them an email or something if you can not speak Japanese

1058
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:31,340
but right now yeah and it's gonna be three different CDs they're all press

1059
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:37,820
CDs gonna be about 15 bucks apiece that's a d7 five keys d7 seven keys and

1060
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:44,160
D7 other mixture. So definitely look for those and I will be getting those as soon as I can

1061
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,160
order them.

1062
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:49,760
Alright, I was going to open the Skype line back up because our caller wanted to call

1063
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,840
back because he had something he wanted to share with us. So we're going to open back

1064
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:58,960
up that Skype line there so you can call us if you want. Skype.org to download the client.

1065
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,380
And pretty soon we're going to be going to break here and in the break we'll be hearing

1066
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:06,660
some songs that are going to be in UltraMix 2. Some of those port overs from 2DX. So

1067
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:09,660
For those of you guys that haven't heard the songs yet, can I have a chance to hear them?

1068
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:12,660
Because, you know, we want you to be able to hear the songs.

1069
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,660
Alright, let's take this call.

1070
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,660
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1071
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,660
Hello there, Rob. Hello, everybody.

1072
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,660
Hello, this is Mr. VXJsonXV, is it not?

1073
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,660
You would be correct, sir.

1074
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:25,660
How are you doing, sir?

1075
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:26,660
I'm doing pretty good.

1076
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:29,660
Alright, what did you want to talk to us with about UltraMix II?

1077
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:33,660
I basically wanted to add in something about how the song packs are going to work.

1078
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:38,660
Um, for all of you that have UltraMix already and have gotten the song packs and didn't know this,

1079
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:42,660
basically what's gonna happen is if you have the song packs purchased and downloaded,

1080
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,660
when you fire up UltraMix 2, it's just gonna work.

1081
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,660
They're gonna be on the list, you're gonna play them, it's gonna be beautiful.

1082
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:50,660
The only catch is...

1083
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,660
It's plug and play.

1084
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,660
What was that?

1085
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,660
It's plug and play.

1086
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,660
It is plug and play.

1087
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:00,660
Um, what's gonna happen though is that the videos are gonna be different.

1088
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:05,960
You know, obviously UltraMix is going to cycle video content, but Order of Chaos on DDRFreak

1089
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,840
said that there's going to be exclusive videos, brand new videos for those songs now on UltraMix

1090
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,840
2.

1091
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:13,840
Really?

1092
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,320
So basically the media is going to be already on the DVD, but the steps and, you know, actually

1093
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,620
showing up is going to be off your hard drive for downloading the content.

1094
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:27,120
I've heard rumors that there's going to be a lot of new videos in UltraMix 2.

1095
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,120
That's what they're pushing for.

1096
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:32,120
I don't know how much I can say, but I hear that there's a lot of new videos on Ultramix 2.

1097
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:36,120
That if you're wanting to see some new videos, Ultramix 2 is going to give you plenty.

1098
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,120
Yeah, that'd be shitty.

1099
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,120
We'll see.

1100
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:45,120
Yep. And then you can, you will still be able to buy the first six song packs on Ultramix 2.

1101
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:50,120
The only catch is if you do that, you can only use them for Ultramix 2 and not for the first one.

1102
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:55,120
Oh, interesting. So if you're smart, you'll buy your packs on Ultramix 1 now.

1103
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:05,120
That is what I want to do, because there's no word yet if the song packs are going to be removed from purchase for UltraMix 1, I'm hoping not, so I can get them too, but you know.

1104
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,120
Do you actually have UltraMix 1 right now?

1105
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,120
No, I don't even have an Xbox.

1106
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,120
Is UltraMix 2 making you change your mind here?

1107
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:20,120
I've wanted to get one for a while, I've just never really had a good amount of incentive, but this is definitely making me want one even more now.

1108
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:24,120
So you're telling me that Jets Already a Future was not enough?

1109
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:28,120
I never played the first one, it was in...

1110
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,120
Halo 2?

1111
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,120
Well now that you can get, if you get your Xbox you should also get Jets Already a Future since it's cheap now.

1112
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,120
Sure, why not? It's a good game.

1113
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,120
And the Buffy game.

1114
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,120
The Buffy game.

1115
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,120
Okay, Buffy, yeah.

1116
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:46,120
Alright Jason, when you get your Xbox we're going to have a battle on Xbox Live, alright?

1117
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,120
Sounds awesome.

1118
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,120
I'm gonna serve you on Xbox Live.

1119
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,120
Oh no! Oh no!

1120
01:23:53,120 --> 01:24:00,120
I'm actually thinking about this. I don't know. I'm gonna kind of put some feelers out in the chat room and kind of see what you guys think about this.

1121
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:06,120
What would you guys think about starting up some kind of Sunday night Ultramix League? Like right after the show.

1122
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:10,120
We all jump on Xbox Live and play. I would do it. I'll even jump on there and play.

1123
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,120
Orange Lounge DR team?

1124
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:17,600
Yeah, it'll be well. It'll be like our Sunday night. You know ultra mix night like post show thing

1125
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:22,280
I don't know how many people would be enough or if that's like way too dorky for you guys. I don't know

1126
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:28,760
If I don't know if it brings people together and gets them gets us some good playtime in

1127
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,140
Sounds good by me cuz I've actually been on Xbox Live after the show

1128
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:36,880
There's um some a couple well at least one person in our chat room that sometimes likes to get on there and play

1129
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,780
play different songs after the show sometimes. So I'm thinking, why not expand it and get

1130
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:44,680
a lot of people on there? It might be kind of fun. So we'll see.

1131
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,120
I've heard that people that are getting on live, that there's very few people that play

1132
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,180
on live anymore. Well, anymore. But think about when the first

1133
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,560
game came out, too. That's true.

1134
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:57,560
You know, it's almost a year old now. Of course there's not a lot of people still on Xbox

1135
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,460
Live. But, hey, that's the thing, is that we want

1136
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:03,780
to start something up, too. Let's start it. Let's get old so it makes, it's kind of like

1137
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:07,620
and I love the 90s thing. Remember when the old stuff was cool? Remember when UltraMix

1138
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:11,020
was cool? Kind of bringing it back. So let's see.

1139
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:15,180
I've been playing new songs. Everybody's going to come back around. Those numbers are going

1140
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,580
to shoot up the day that UltraMix 2 come out.

1141
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:21,420
I think so too. Another thing a lot of people don't consider when they're playing UltraMix

1142
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:28,020
on Xbox Live is that it doesn't show you everybody that's playing. It only shows you who's looking

1143
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:32,380
for a game right now. So when you're in the lobby looking for people to play, the folks

1144
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:36,680
that are already having a match, or are having private matches, you don't see them because

1145
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:40,020
they're already playing the game. So even though it only looks like there's one or two

1146
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:45,580
people on, there's probably at least ten. Which for a game that's a year old, it's DDR,

1147
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:52,660
probably isn't that bad. Yeah. Interesting. Very interesting. Alright. Alright. Anything

1148
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:57,000
else you want to share about UltraMix stuff, Jason? Somebody should buy me an Xbox and

1149
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,420
all the song packs and a live subscription for a few years, because I don't have money

1150
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:04,260
yet and I have bills to pay but well I'm sure that's the same boat a lot of

1151
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:07,140
folks are in maybe they'll drop the price of an Xbox again not likely but

1152
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:11,140
you never know hopefully what are they right now 150 175 I think 150 but you

1153
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:16,260
could get a refurbed one at that is very true places for 120 130 you know what

1154
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:19,860
say version ones are a lot better anyways I have I have the super halo

1155
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:23,380
ones so I don't know I might you know you can hack them if you have a memory

1156
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:29,260
stick yep I have heard there's plenty of you have to use the first release of

1157
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,160
of like uh... mecha-salt

1158
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:34,420
yeah friend of ours can do it

1159
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:37,340
so we're going to test that theory soon

1160
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,660
oh did someone get married?

1161
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,260

1167
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,820
uh...

1168
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:58,820
i'm serious about this xbox live thing after the show i think it would be fun

1169
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,380
Would you guys play?

1170
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,540
I'm eating making pouty faces and blinking my eyelashes.

1171
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:09,020
On Sunday? Now wait a minute Loki, with Ultramix 2 multiple people can

1172
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,820
play for one Xbox so you and I could both play

1173
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:12,660
on the Ultramix.

1174
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,140
Wow, really?

1175
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:17,600
Don't say, don't care.

1176
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,260
I'll play Final Fantasy 11.

1177
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,780
Jerk, jerk.

1178
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:25,220
Yes Angel. Screw it, I'm gonna twist Magus's arm and make him

1179
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:30,220
But don't worry, those demons that come through my demonic vortex can play with you.

1180
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:37,220
Wonderful. Now some folks in the chat room are saying we should do it before the show, but...

1181
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:40,220
After the show would be too late, because honestly, I'm driving home.

1182
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,220
Yeah.

1183
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:47,220
And keep in mind, I also work an earlier schedule now. I have to get up at 5.30 in the morning to go to work.

1184
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,220
Well, I'll have to think. I don't know. We'll see.

1185
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,220
Because my ass is going to school.

1186
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:54,580
time for me personally like I have to get my Sunday stuff done before the show

1187
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:58,660
so I don't know we'll see well but how about a different night

1188
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:03,860
no that might work too yeah set up for a different night you know probably I'm

1189
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,500
gonna be going home busting my ass to get my homework done too yeah there you

1190
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,420
go yeah we'll see what we can do if there's an interest for doing something

1191
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:13,500
like that we'll set something up we'll see yeah soon as I tell Magus what songs

1192
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:19,300
are on the new UltraMix 2 he'll probably get one maybe we're not even we haven't

1193
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:23,260
even really we've only heard like one new license song brick house by

1194
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:26,420
Commodores we haven't even heard about any of the other stuff and there might

1195
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:30,460
be some really good stuff that's good I would just play it for the Commodore

1196
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:37,300
song that's an inside joke between the pixie dust and I so yeah we'll see we'll

1197
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:41,020
see all right what we're gonna do now actually I think we'll go ahead and take

1198
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:44,480
a break and we're gonna play those songs from Ultramix 2 that are being ported

1199
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,800
over from 2dx so in this break you're gonna hear route 80s star mine and

1200
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:54,160
and VJ Army. So we'll be back right after this. You are tuned into Orange Lounge

After the break we might get into the cage match I think. We need to do that at

1203
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:58,600
some point

1204
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:02,320

Steppin' into the groove of it Steppin' into the groove of it

1226
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:20,540
Hey, did you hear about that show?

1227
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:21,540
What show?

1228
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:24,660
Well, they play a lot of great Samani and video of East End music, but if you listen

1229
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:26,820
to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

1230
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,540
Oh, I've heard of that station.

1231
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:33,540
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago. Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

1232
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,540
Well, you die.

1233
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:42,540
I what? Hey, wait! What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen? Ahhhhh!

1234
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:46,540
Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!

1235
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:55,540
We are back with Orange Lounge Radio. Now we're talking before the break a little bit about UltraMix 2.

1236
01:34:55,540 --> 01:35:01,420
too. Not to leave it out, but DDR Extreme is going to be coming out very soon, just

1237
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:06,260
before we know it. We're about a month away, just a little over a month away from DDR Extreme

1238
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:09,820
coming out, so that's kind of crazy. And we'll probably start hearing a little more news

1239
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:14,460
on it, including we got a couple weeks ago, and we kind of missed it when we were talking

1240
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:19,240
about last week, we were talking about some of the other stuff dealing with DDR Extreme

1241
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:24,480
last week, but we kind of glossed over the iToy modes. There's actually like some brand

1242
01:35:54,480 --> 01:36:00,560
You know what I think is cool though is that for working out purposes the itoy thing is cool

1243
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:05,800
Like that's the only reason I would use it. Is that hands of heat mode too? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

1244
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:13,080
And then they have that feed the animals game which I haven't really seen a whole lot about but it looks very interesting

1245
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:14,760
That's for sure

1246
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:19,660
That's the one where you're gonna step on the different food and you feed it to the animal that's on the screen

1247
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,240
It's crazy

1248
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,240
Very crazy.

1249
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,240
Trying to find some more information about some of these modes.

1250
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:31,240
What else do we have? We have the Hyper Dash, which looks like the old school track and field,

1251
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:34,240
which I have no idea how that's going to work with the iToy.

1252
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:38,240
I think it might actually just be using the dance pad, where you're just going to run in place, like all,

1253
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:43,240
every single old school Nintendo Power Pad game was just like running in place as fast as you can.

1254
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,240
And that was your workout, remember?

1255
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:52,240
Dance Aerobics

1256
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,240
magical ball

1257
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,940
You can show Konami your magical balls

1258
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:26,580
I'm definitely looking forward to feeding time. I think that's going to be a very cool one

1259
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:30,480
For those of you that may have missed it. We'll link you guys again to that story

1260
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:37,460
Over on yahoo games domain, which is hilarious because they talk about it being for the Xbox. It's really funny. So

1261
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:40,340
Definitely check that one out

1262
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:48,340
So that's pretty much all I have to say about DDR Extreme. Have you guys pre-ordered your DDR Extreme yet?

1263
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:54,340
That might be the only way you can get that VRare. Everybody looks so enthused.

1264
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:59,340
I'll have to order it. Then again, my man does manage a webcam.

1265
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:03,340
A webcam? What kind of business is your man in?

1266
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:08,340
I was typing webcam on the thing. It's GameStop.

1267
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,340
You sure?

1268
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:10,340
Yes.

1269
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,340
Rob.

1270
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,340
What?

1271
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:13,340
Rob.

1272
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,340
What?

1273
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:15,340
What?

1274
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,340
Rob.

1275
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,340
What?

1276
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,340
Bite me.

1277
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:19,340
Okay.

1278
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:20,340
Alright.

1279
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:29,700
Well, I guess if no one has anything else to say on the DDR Extreme, why don't we just

1280
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:31,380
go ahead and have ourselves a cage match?

1281
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,380
How's that sound?

1282
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:33,380
Sure.

1283
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:34,380
Alright.

1284
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:35,380
We'll do it.

1285
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:36,380
I got to be lazy today.

1286
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:37,380
What do you mean, you got to be lazy?

1287
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,380
What do you mean you have to be lazy today?

1288
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,380
I'd have to bring one.

1289
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,380
That's right, because you won last week, didn't you?

1290
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:44,380
Uh-huh.

1291
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,380
That's right.

1292
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:46,380
Finally.

1293
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:49,380
Alright, so just as a reminder, the way the cage match works...

1294
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:53,380
You have to be in our chat room at www.orangelauntrader.com.

1295
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:54,380
Click on chat.

1296
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:56,380
We're going to play three songs for you guys.

1297
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:01,380
A clip of last week's winner, because, you know, you were listening last week, so you've already heard it.

1298
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,380
So we're only going to play a clip of it.

1299
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:09,380
And then we'll hear two new songs brought to the table from each host, and you will vote on your favorite.

1300
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:15,380
And the winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's...

1301
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:22,380
I'm sorry, Orange Lounge Radio's the Monty Music and More program, which plays on the station 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we aren't live.

1302
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:32,380
Alright, so here we go. Last week's winner was Jamie, and she brought to the table a song by M-Flow, which you know from old school DDR games and 2DX.

1303
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:36,280
so uh... this is their new album from their new album it's a song called

1304
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,560
astro sexy

1305
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,100
chemistry and it's last week's winner and so here's a clip of it

1306
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,360
so you can decide if you want it to win again tonight song number one m flow

1307
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,360
So astro-sexy

1308
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:21,360
and

1309
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:29,560
alright over the clip song number one in tonight's cage match

1310
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:33,560
m flow with astro-sexy alright the next pick

1311
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,600
in tonight's cage match the first challenger comes from

1312
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,680
our very own loki loki what did you pick for tonight's cage match

1313
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:43,500
i picked a song bro i don't know it from

1314
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:51,700
It's, they said it was from Outfaze, I don't think it's from Outfaze, but it's called Nuon.

1315
01:42:54,200 --> 01:43:01,800
So this is one of those songs where somebody has decided they are going to say it's from Outfaze, even though they have no particular proof of this, right?

1316
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,700
Exactly.

1317
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,100
But you liked it anyway, so you're putting it in a cage match.

1318
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,800
That and I just don't care.

1319
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,600
Alright. Fair enough. So here it is.

1320
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:19,440
An unknown group that we're going to call Not Outfades, maybe somebody will recognize

1321
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,720
this and help us out, who knows.

1322
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:26,520
And the song is called Nuon, and this is Loki's pick in Night's Cage Match.

1323
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,520
Enjoy!

1324
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,520
Oh

1325
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:45,720
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, a group that they are saying is

1326
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:48,760
out phase, but we're kind of skeptical at this point.

1327
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:52,360
But Nuon is the song, and both of you liked it so much, you put it in tonight's cage match.

1328
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:53,360
What did the rest of us think?

1329
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,360
Jamie?

1330
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:55,360
That doesn't sound like any out phase to me.

1331
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:59,760
And it did not detect the presence of Taku in that.

1332
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,480
And I would know.

1333
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:04,600
Because some people have various types of radar.

1334
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,360
I have Takudar.

1335
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,000
And it didn't go off.

1336
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,160
It didn't even blink.

1337
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:15,840
So it sounds pretty generic in Japan, honestly, to me.

1338
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,520
So it gets a seven for being average.

1339
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,960
All right, seven for being average from Jamie.

1340
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,520
DDR Angel, what did you think of Nuon?

1341
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:35,520
I thought it was pretty good, I mean, pretty good for like background music if you need to do your homework, or something, you know, if you're just playing around, photo editing, or whatever.

1342
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:39,520
Um, I'd probably say... an eight and a half.

1343
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,520
Arcadian 42.

1344
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,520
Yeah, yeah, I still see how that sounds.

1345
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,520
It sounded way too generic for me.

1346
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,520
It wasn't too bad, I'd give it a 7.5.

1347
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:49,520
Alright, Loki.

1348
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:51,520
Take it to Nate.

1349
01:48:51,520 --> 01:49:01,520
If that is out phase, it's very generic and very sad direction for them, so I remain highly skeptical as to that being out phase.

1350
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:07,520
It's a little generic, but it's not bad. I've just heard better trance, so I give it a 7.

1351
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:14,520
Alright, but our opinions don't count, it's you in the chatroom that has a final say, and now you get my pick in tonight's Page Match.

1352
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:21,200
Cage match and I am I'm being very adventurous tonight because I I haven't

1353
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:25,880
even completely heard the song I'm putting in ever I heard it at the club

1354
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:30,900
the other night and then I downloaded it and now I'm putting it in and I have no

1355
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:34,720
idea if I even like this song as much as I thought I did but I'm kind of

1356
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:40,200
desperate and I like the fact that it's another old song being resampled so

1357
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:45,220
So enjoy my pick in tonight's cage match, it's a group called the Royal Jigglos, which

1358
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:46,960
you know you gotta love them by the name alone.

1359
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,960
And the song they're doing is California Dreamin', enjoy.

1360
01:49:49,960 --> 01:50:04,960
Hold me my sweet, hold me now, hold me God, and I shout, the sound of the storm, a portal,

1361
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,960
I channelled through time

1362
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:09,460
And my senses burned

1363
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:12,460
The heart broke in life

1364
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,960
The broken hand burned

1365
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:16,960
How are you?

1366
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,960
How are you?

1367
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,960
Oh

1368
01:50:48,960 --> 01:51:11,320
I am going to heaven for the dream, and I'm not your way to stay.

1369
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:18,440
I am going to heaven for the dream, and I'm not your way to stay.

1370
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:50,440
Oh

1371
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:19,440
I'm such a Wednesday

1372
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:23,440
I'll be where you are and save the world

1373
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:27,440
You're all I need, it's all that I need

1374
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,440
No one here is for this reason

1375
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:35,440
Even if I'm such a Wednesday

1376
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:20,440
Hold me God, hold me God, hold me, hold me

1377
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:30,560
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, a song I've never heard before,

1378
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,080
Royal Gigalos with California Dreamin'.

1379
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,080
Jamie?

1380
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:38,280
You know what?

1381
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:43,480
That was really, and I understand you, had you heard it through all the way, I'm sure

1382
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:47,360
you would have reconsidered your choice.

1383
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,360
You know what?

1384
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:50,200
The mix I heard was actually a little different.

1385
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,160
That one was more repetitive in our mouth.

1386
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,440
I remember it being like, transier, actually.

1387
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:57,400
I was kind of getting into it at first, because I was like, hey, this is kind of cool.

1388
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:59,640
And then I was like, ugh.

1389
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:03,360
And then, the bitches singing, because I don't think it was a sample of the Mombus and the

1390
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,360
Poppers.

1391
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,360
I don't think it was either.

1392
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,360
In the video, it wasn't.

1393
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:13,400
If you're going to be a professional singer, a requirement is that you hold a key.

1394
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:25,400
However, there's Politary. However, where I would normally have given that a 4, because of the name of the band, I said I'd give him a bonus points to get a 5.

1395
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:28,400
Alright. DDR Angel.

1396
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:37,240
you know what I've actually heard better better keys held by like band newbies

1397
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:42,840
by band newbies if you've never been in a saxophone class with sixth graders who

1398
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:47,000
have never played a saxophone before it sounds like cows being beaten to death

1399
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Alright, DDR Angel.

1400
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Moo.

1401
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Okay.

1402
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Gee, I don't know.

1403
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
The song was okay.

1404
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I mean, it was kind of dancy, it was kind of cool, so...

1405
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Maybe I'll be generous and give it an 8.

1406
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Alright.

1407
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
A pity point from DDR Angel.

1408
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Arcadian!

1409
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I'm gonna follow the same guidelines that Dark Sakura gives the song. I'm gonna have to give it a 1.

1410
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,500
Which is the lowest score I've ever given one of my own songs.

1411
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:47,000
I think that's the lowest score anybody's given their own song.

1412
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,000
To quote Muffin Juice, it sounds more like an elephant getting a pineapple shoved up its ass.

1413
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,500
All right. You guys are mean.

1414
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:54,500
That would be...

1415
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
All right. Well, let's see. You know what? The chat room may have felt a little differently than the rest two, right?

1416
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,500
I have no way to imitate that.

1417
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:04,500
And it is up to them to choose between these three songs.

1418
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:19,460
1. M-Flow – Astro Sexy 2. Not Out Phase – Nuon

1419
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:24,460
That's a horrible clip. Let's try again.

1420
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:35,460
Alright, and song number three, Royal Gigalows, California Dreamin'.

1421
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:36,460
California Dreaming.

1422
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:53,100
All right, place, vote now.

1423
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:56,780
Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote.

1424
01:56:56,780 --> 01:57:00,080
Remember, you must send it over private message.

1425
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:04,860
If you yell it out in the main chat room, you will not only not have your vote counted,

1426
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:11,860
you will be mocked openly for not listening to the directions. By Jamie. Alright, so uh...

1427
01:57:11,860 --> 01:57:19,180
What else am I here for? But probably mockery. If caning were to be brought back, somehow

1428
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:24,220
I imagine you would be involved. You would be the administrator. Dude, that'd be cool.

1429
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:30,940
I still think my opinion is to solve all the world's problems. What? Two methods. Standardized

1430
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:36,060
test and battle royale all right i seriously think they should take all the inmates put them on an

1431
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:41,980
island kill who they made a movie out of that with ray leoto is called no escape but they need to

1432
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:46,140
when they have one left and he thinks he's all winner and going back to become a productive

1433
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:54,620
member of society then they they sink his boat you guys are horrible televise it new reality tv

1434
01:57:54,620 --> 01:58:01,820
you guys are horrible all right we're gonna take a break pretty soon here

1435
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:06,780
while we tally up those cage match votes and when we excuse me I burped a little

1436
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:12,020
bit when we come back from the break we're gonna hear um oh I'm sorry we're

1437
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:16,300
gonna hear us doing a segment called list lists which we have not done in a

1438
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:19,540
long long time on the show but we figured you know what we have some time

1439
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:23,440
to fill we have some new people listening tonight we want to do list

1440
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:29,560
list and tonight's topic, and this is where we determine on this show the definitive top

1441
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:33,640
three of something. You know, cause top shows are very popular, like we have the top ten

1442
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:39,000
games and top ten this, so we here on Orange Lounge Radio are gonna come up with our very

1443
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:46,640
own top three and tonight's topic is iToy game I would most like to see on DDR. So some

1444
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:49,920
of you guys may have a suggestion out there in the chat room so you might want to type

1445
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,080
those out cause you never know, one of the hosts or the guests might pick that up and

1446
01:58:53,080 --> 01:59:01,560
use it as their suggestion. So we shall see. Meanwhile, I'd actually like to go over some...

1447
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:08,240
well, we'll do the FUs as well when we come back. But first off, I want to talk about

1448
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:12,860
some other video game news that came up this week and last week while we were having our

1449
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:17,640
crazy show. So I just kind of wanted to run over some of that real fast. Xbox is going

1450
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:22,080
to have a brand new Sonic Mega collection coming out for it. That's going to be pretty

1451
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:30,560
20 different games, one Xbox, including Sonic, Sonic 3, Sonic Knuckles, Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic

1452
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,360
and Knuckles when you put them together is going to be on there, and a bunch of Game

1453
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:38,300
Gear titles, and then these other titles that seemingly have nothing to do with Sonic, The

1454
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,840
Ooze, Comic Zone, Flicky, and Ristar.

1455
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,380
You will notice, however, that Sonic CD is not on it.

1456
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:46,620
You know what?

1457
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:48,520
We need Sonic CD.

1458
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,640
Maybe it's an unlock, you never know.

1459
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:53,300
We need the Japanese version of Sonic CD that has the better music.

1460
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:54,300
You never know.

1461
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,300
We need nights.

1462
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,300
We need a new nights game.

1463
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:57,300
We will see.

1464
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:04,840
Real quick, rumor is that we'll get our first glimpse of Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater

1465
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:05,840
this October.

1466
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:09,320
It's going to be launched in Japan this October is the current rumor.

1467
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:12,100
We'll confirm that for you as soon as we find out.

1468
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:16,200
Coming out on the Game Boy Advance, you know those Nintendo games that you're paying 20

1469
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:19,700
bucks for to play the same damn game you played 15 years ago?

1470
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:25,220
There's even more coming out this time, Dr. Mario, Metroid, which seems completely pointless

1471
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:29,100
to me, because if you want to play the old Metroid, fucking buy Metroid Zero, because

1472
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:32,320
not only will you get the old Metroid, but you should get a fucking awesome Metroid game

1473
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,740
with it, based off the old Metroid.

1474
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:41,740
And wasn't there a way you can supposedly link the original, your Game Boy Advance with,

1475
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:47,060
what was it, Metroid Prime? Yes, Prime and Fusion could link together and you can also

1476
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:52,060
the original Metroid that way, so this will be the third time we've had the original Metroid available.

1477
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:53,060
You know what?

1478
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:54,060
In the past few years, yes.

1479
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:55,060
Guardian Legend.

1480
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:56,060
I know, I know.

1481
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:57,060
Guardian Legend!

1482
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:58,060
I tried to get people to vote for it.

1483
02:00:58,060 --> 02:00:59,060
I told Guardian Legend.

1484
02:00:59,060 --> 02:01:01,060
Well, there are two more that we're going to get.

1485
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:04,060
Castlevania is coming out.

1486
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:05,060
That is cool.

1487
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:06,060
That's a must-have.

1488
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:10,060
Of course, if you have a PlayStation, you could also just get Castlevania Chronicles.

1489
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:14,060
Or you could just fucking get Symphony of the Night and get a really good Castlevania game.

1490
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:15,060
First, that was good.

1491
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:18,060
I've been playing a lot of Aria of Sorrow recently.

1492
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:21,060
Castlevania 3 was the best of the Nintendo ones, the Japanese ones.

1493
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:28,060
I haven't been playing a whole lot of new Castlevania games on Game Boy Advance, but I've been playing this Aria of Sorrow a lot. I actually really like it, it's pretty cool.

1494
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:33,060
Also, Zelda 2, the Adventure of Link, I think we all knew that was a good one.

1495
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:34,060
That would make Dan happy.

1496
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:35,060
At some point.

1497
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:39,060
I could not get into Zelda 2, but he loves that game.

1498
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:40,060
Yep.

1499
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:43,060
Also another video game, yes, Logie?

1500
02:01:43,060 --> 02:02:00,060
I'd like to mention beforehand. Um, we do remember, like, you know, Advent Children, of course, being the direct sequel to, uh, Final Fantasy VII. Before Crisis being the cell phone game. Well, now there's a new trademark for the U.S. Actually, there's two trademarks for the U.S. First of all, Before Crisis is coming out over in the U.S.

1501
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,060
On cell phones?

1502
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:21,060
Whether it be a cell phone or a Gameboy Advance title, that's my guess. And then another one called Dawn of Souls, which is also tied in with the Final Fantasy VII thing, so whatever that is. But it was rumored that they were going to be making a spinoff with Vincent being the lead.

1503
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:27,060
Now that would just make me so happy, because Vincent was my favorite character in Final Fantasy VII.

1504
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:28,060
Yeah, so...

1505
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:35,060
Like, my last party was Yuffie, Vincent, and of course Cloud, because you couldn't go without him.

1506
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:37,060
If I could have ditched Cloud, I would have so fast.

1507
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:50,060
They have some really kick-ass scans online, too. If you go to www.adventchildren.net, they've got some awesome scans, and then there's some retard trying to make his own game and stuff.

1508
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:54,620
stuff and yeah yeah yeah but like you know this is kind of bad radio but I'm

1509
02:02:54,620 --> 02:03:02,380
going to show this in studio here we've got a nice picture of Vincent here that

1510
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:07,900
is said there was whatever okay I meant I was looking at Vincent that's it shut

1511
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:14,500
up kiss my ass there's another kick-ass one of a sit here hitting god knows what

1512
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:17,880
I know what you could do why don't you post this link in our chat room so the

1513
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:21,520
chatters can play along and see some of these pictures because they are very nice pictures

1514
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:35,480
I got to say. All right. Any other pictures you want to show us in the studio though?

1515
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:45,680
Yeah, there's a really kick ass one of Vincent. Okay. That one's pretty. Now that is my man.

1516
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:50,960
that's pretty sweet and we've got of course the return of red 13

1517
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:55,080
you know what's funny is that the whole time I ever played Final Fantasy 7 I never

1518
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:59,720
got Vincent. UVS, Vincent no. Go figure.

1519
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:02,760
last call for cage match votes in our chat room FYI

1520
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:07,200
also in other video gaming news recently Metroid Prime will be having a

1521
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,160
GameCube

1522
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:12,160
bundle coming out of course with the release of Metroid Prime 2 on the way

1523
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:15,360
if you're thinking about getting a GameCube now's a good time because Metroid Prime

1524
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:20,120
Prime will be released with the GameCube, and they'll also have a sneak peek at Metroid

1525
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:22,960
Prime 2 Echoes.

1526
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:28,300
Also there's going to be some new games coming out for the Nintendo DS, which sounds kind

1527
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:29,720
of cool.

1528
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:33,360
Lots of games being announced, I'm just going to, I'm going to see what Konami's got planned.

1529
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:37,340
Konami is going to be coming out with a Castlevania game as well as a game called Boktai, I don't

1530
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:39,080
know that one.

1531
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:45,280
There's going to be a Goemon game on Nintendo DS, as well as a pro baseball game, of course

1532
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:48,400
these are in works for Japan so who knows how many of these will actually

1533
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:53,000
come over here. I dig a Goemon game. Survival Kids and the Winning Eleven series are

1534
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,360
coming out. I'm looking at other games that sound interesting. Sonic DS. There's

1535
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:03,580
going to be a Megaman Battle Network game from Capcom. Of course the

1536
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:07,840
mandatory Bust-A-Move title. I know you must hate that name but that is what

1537
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:13,800
they call it here in the US or Puzzle Bobble if you must. And for you,

1538
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,800
Didi or Angel, Monster Rancher.

1539
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:17,800
I'm sorry, not Monster Rancher.

1540
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:18,800
Oh, shut up.

1541
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:19,800
No, I'm sorry, not that one.

1542
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:20,800
I was thinking Harvest Moon.

1543
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:21,800
There you go.

1544
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:22,800
That's what I was thinking of, Harvest Moon.

1545
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:23,800
Monster Rancher.

1546
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:24,800
Although, there is a Monster Rancher as well.

1547
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:25,800
You're a Monster Rancher.

1548
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:26,800
All right.

1549
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:27,800
Anyway, do you want to know what Booktie really is?

1550
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:28,800
What?

1551
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,080
It's like a, I want to say it's like a vampire type thing, but like, I don't know, something

1552
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,080
more cartoony.

1553
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,080
Mm-hmm.

1554
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:37,440
But, uh, it's got some sun sensor thing or whatever on it.

1555
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:38,720
Oh, they have that game here.

1556
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:39,720
Yeah.

1557
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:41,560
I forget the name of it here, but they, they do have it here.

1558
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:42,560
I thought that was a book tie.

1559
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,560
Yeah, with the sunlight.

1560
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,560
Maybe it was called that.

1561
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,560
Sorry, sorry, I almost...

1562
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:46,560
Oh, okay.

1563
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,560
All right.

1564
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:48,560
I almost bought that.

1565
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,680
I almost bought that, but I bought Sword of Mana instead, and I wish I'd bought the other

1566
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:53,560
game because I don't like Sword of Mana.

1567
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:54,560
So...

1568
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,560
Oh, well.

1569
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:56,560
You live, you learn.

1570
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:57,560
All right.

1571
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:03,000
That's it for other gaming news tonight, so we're going to wrap up the cage match voting,

1572
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,560
and you guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1573
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:06,560
Sure, Rob.

1574
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:07,560
All right.

1575
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:16,440
one stinking vote one vote we have a new champion new on is tonight's winner by

1576
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:22,800
one vote over astro sexy who says every vote doesn't count boys and girls I

1577
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:28,140
thought astro sexy was guaranteed win again yeah cuz you know if the one

1578
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:31,020
person that voted for California dreamin would have voted for the other song

1579
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:35,000
could have been different but the one person that voted for California

1580
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Oh well. Now I'm not going to say every vote is cast in secret, but if you want to out yourself on air, go ahead.

1581
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I'll just make another inflow song next week.

1582
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
There you go.

1583
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Better watch it, I'll pick Toxic.

1584
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I almost put Toxic in tonight.

1585
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I'll make you guys listen to Britney.

1586
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
You guys are getting Danny Minnow again next week.

1587
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Okay, I'm not going to torture you guys that badly, I'll pick some inflow.

1588
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Alright. I think we're going to go to a break. What should we hear in this break? I don't know. Just let me give me an idea for a theme for this video.

1589
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Taku.

1590
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Some Taku? Alright. Some Taku?

1591
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
No. Play Thrash Tracks.

1592
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Oh God. Is that Taku?

1593
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Yeah.

1594
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Was it really?

1595
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Thrash Tracks and Tetraku.

1596
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Alright, fine.

1597
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I want old Taku stuff.

1598
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:33,540
All right, we'll hear some of that and then we'll be back and we're gonna do tonight's episode of listless

1599
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:36,340
and remember we're still looking for your ideas from the chatroom.

1600
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:39,840
Itoygame I'd most like to see in DDR.

1601
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:46,840
we'll be back

1602
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:50,960
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1603
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:55,120
We are back, and as promised, we're going to get into tonight's edition of Listless.

1604
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:57,360
I think we need a theme song for Listless.

1605
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:00,280
What's a good Bomani song that's like a theme song for Listless?

1606
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:01,680
Um, Holic.

1607
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:04,560
You can't do Holic again.

1608
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:12,060
I know, the one that was the pop music video. It sounds very game show-y.

1609
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:13,560
Oh, Linus.

1610
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:14,560
Yeah.

1611
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:18,560
Shit, do I have Linus? I don't have that song readily available to me.

1612
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:21,560
Oh, but I thought...

1613
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:26,060
Let's see if I can find it. Oh, damn, all my pop music special stuff is gone.

1614
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:28,560
Oh, I know a good one. I know a good one, because you said pop music.

1615
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:31,560
That made me think of a pop music song that would be really good if I could find it.

1616
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:36,740
crap oh here it is here it is yes it's that it's that um that toy sounding song

1617
02:13:36,740 --> 02:13:45,240
from nine it's time to play listless

1618
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:54,840
can't fire rod you're not in tonight's edition of listless we will be

1619
02:13:54,840 --> 02:14:00,780
determining the i-toy game we most want to see in a TDR game the way that

1620
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:09,780
The list list works is that each host and each guest will make their list of three games that they want to see in an IToy DDR.

1621
02:14:09,780 --> 02:14:16,780
After that, we will have the elimination round, where each person will take one thing off of the list.

1622
02:14:16,780 --> 02:14:23,780
After that, the chat room will be able to vote. So if you're not in the chat room, join in now.

1624
02:14:26,780 --> 02:14:28,780
Click on chat.

1625
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:35,780
And now, let's play, Listless!

1626
02:14:36,220 --> 02:14:39,620
Rob, you've scared me.

1627
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:43,180
Beyond all capacity to be scared!

1628
02:14:43,180 --> 02:14:47,060
Except there's no slugs involved. If there were slugs involved, I'd be even more scared.

1629
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:50,360
In all seriousness, let's get to tonight's list.

1630
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:54,840
Alright, let's see. Eye toy game I most want to see in DDR. Starting off tonight,

1631
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:58,060
who always starts us off? The lovely Dark Sakura.

1632
02:14:58,060 --> 02:15:02,980
Damn straight on lovely. She's a trendsetter. I sure am. Number three iToy game you most

1633
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:13,100
want to see in DDR? Car Wash the Game. Car Wash the Game. Explain how this works. You'd

1634
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:19,420
have your buckets on the ground and one would be your sponge and you'd wash the car and

1635
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:24,060
then you'd have the hose that you'd spray down the car. And would this actually relate

1636
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:29,540
to DDR at all? No. Alright, fine. How about, it'll play Eurobeat while you do it. Okay.

1637
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:34,180
Alright, there you go. I know, I know. Better yet, how about Bikini Car Wash the game? Alright.

1638
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:38,940
Then like your icon, you just like, you know, and so like, the better you do, the hotter

1639
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:42,640
you are and the more tips you get. Okay, Bikini Car Wash the game. Alright, fine. That works.

1640
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:46,440
I'll change it there. Alright. And if it's a guy, then it's Speedo Car Wash. I see, I

1641
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:52,420
was thinking the movie Car Wash. At the Car Wash, yeah. Alright, I could be playing in

1642
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:58,180
in the background. All right, Angel. All right, then let's go to RKDN42 since Angel's working

1643
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:02,460
there. RKDN42, number three iToy game you would most like to see in DDR.

1644
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:07,300
I just made a comment about that car wash. As long as no one's carrying around a bucket

1645
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:11,460
of piss. Okay.

1646
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:14,220
That wasn't that car wash. That could be like negative points.

1647
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:19,140
That wasn't car wash. Someone was carrying around a thing of piss. I don't know why.

1648
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:21,140
Alright, the movie sucked.

1649
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:23,140
Alright, anyway.

1650
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:25,140
Number three, Lice Invaders.

1651
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:29,140
Watch out, they're coming down from the sky to attack your head.

1652
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:31,140
Lice Invaders.

1653
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:33,140
Okay, Lice Invaders.

1654
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:39,140
And to relate this to DDR, Lice Invaders would also play Eurobeat in the background, correct?

1655
02:16:39,140 --> 02:16:41,140
Alright, alright, fine.

1656
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:43,140
Alright, Lice Invaders.

1657
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:46,140
Alright, DDR Angel.

1658
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:49,020
Number three itoy game you would most like to see in DDR?

1659
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:53,540
I couldn't really come up with anything for number three, so I just said mini pop music or mini 2dx

1660
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:57,460
Like a mini like a chibi 2dx. How about I say that? Chibi 2dx?

1661
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:05,640
Yeah, cuz I couldn't come up with anything else original. Oh well. All right, that's fine. That's fine a little chibi game

1662
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:07,640
That'll be cute. All right, Loki your

1663
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:13,080
Number three pick for a itoy game. I would most like to see in DDR

1664
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:30,080
My game is so awesome. It's called Break Shit. Basically, um...

1665
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:32,080
You are so bad in the face.

1666
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:38,080
Okay. Damn this yogurt! Anyways, um, no basically...

1667
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:40,080
Is your yogurt that hot?

1668
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:49,080
Yes it is. It makes me giggle. Anyways, no, basically what you do is an object would come on the screen and you break it.

1669
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:52,080
Alright.

1670
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:58,080
Alright, Loki suggesting Break Shit is the iToy game he would most like to see in DDR. Alright.

1671
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:03,080
And again, to relate this to DDR, Eurobeat Music would be playing in the background. Alright.

1672
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:04,080
You break shit.

1673
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:05,080
Daikinkai.

1674
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:06,080
Yeah, Daikinkai.

1675
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:12,080
My number three game I would most like to see in DDR, Whack-a-Child.

1676
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:16,080
That sounds brilliant.

1677
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:24,080
Whack-a-Child. Basically as you play DDR, little children come on the screen and you have to whack them away.

1678
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:26,080
Do you have the big orange bat icon?

1679
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:28,080
You could. That would be like the bonus stage.

1680
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,080
Okay.

1681
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:34,080
Number two pick now from Jamie.

1682
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:36,520
It would be something like the candy bar doll maker.

1683
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:39,000
I don't know if you've seen all the dolls I've been posting in my live journal.

1684
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
No.

1685
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:46,800
Oh, well, I did have this thing with the candy bar doll maker, and this is, it's like an

1686
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:51,360
interactive thing where you make the outfits and choose the hair and everything, but you

1687
02:18:51,360 --> 02:19:00,120
could use it to, if you want to see what the original candy bar was, it's candybar.co.kr,

1688
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:03,520
but there's also an English one if you look it up on Google.

1689
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:08,840
But anyway, you use the doll maker and you make your character for DDR and then you play

1690
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:09,840
as that character.

1691
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:14,880
So you can drag the hair over and you can make him a boy or make him a girl.

1692
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:17,360
That's the gayest game I've ever heard of, but alright fine.

1693
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:21,320
Candy Bar Doll Game is what... and Eurobeat would play in the background while you do

1694
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:22,320
it.

1695
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:23,320
Nope.

1696
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:24,320
Nope.

1697
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:25,320
It would be like the OHA music.

1698
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:26,320
Okay, the OHA music.

1699
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:30,920
Alright, Arkadium42, your number two pick.

1700
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:36,700
Originally I came up with the idea of head explode mode, or head explode mode, explode

1701
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:40,580
mode if you want, but I thought it would maybe make it cooler, be the evade the assassins

1702
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:47,840
bullet game, where you see the red dot on your head and you have to avoid it.

1703
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:48,840
And if you don't...

1704
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:55,160
Evade the assassins bullet game, so a little red laser would appear on your head, and if

1705
02:19:55,160 --> 02:20:00,500
you don't move out of the way, then boom, your head explodes, and if it actually explodes

1706
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:03,740
that would make it a little bit more dangerous and maybe a bit more fun.

1707
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:09,060
It would work for coming in silent scope mode. Yes, there you go, silent scope mode.

1708
02:20:09,060 --> 02:20:12,220
Alright, brilliant. I like it. I'm going to put that in parenthesis.

1709
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:15,780
Silent scope. Alright.

1710
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:19,220
Angel, your number two pick.

1711
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:23,880
Let's see. Um, hell.

1712
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:26,900
Okay, how about, um, mini Flashwater?

1713
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:31,820
Do you remember that game from Mario Paint? The thing where you just take the mouse and

1714
02:20:31,820 --> 02:20:36,660
then like swaddle the flies and crap? Mini Fly, so the fly swatting game. Yes, Nat

1715
02:20:36,660 --> 02:20:40,460
Attack, that's what it was called. I don't know, I just thought maybe that'd be kind

1716
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:44,860
of cool. I'm not funny tonight. Oh well. That's alright, we're going to need some serious

1717
02:20:44,860 --> 02:20:50,160
ones in here anyway. Alright, Loki, your number two pick for iToy game that you would like

1718
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:56,540
to see in DDR. I'm looking at your list, because I can see your list over on your computer

1719
02:20:56,540 --> 02:21:01,940
and I can't help it because it's funny. Alright. Answer the damn question. You're number two

1720
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:11,940
pick. I can't. He's laughing too hard. It's funny. Say it. No. It's all your damn fault.

1721
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:16,260
See, he starts giggling and then I can't. Okay, here's some serious thoughts. Things

1722
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:26,520
that you like. You know. Okay. Shooting RBGL children in the head. Shh. Okay. My next

1723
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:30,520
This one is awesome. It's basically, I'm itchy.

1724
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:37,520
It sounds like a personal problem.

1725
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:43,520
I think it's pretty self-explanatory. You see the spot on your body gets red. It's it.

1726
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:46,520
Do you have jock itch?

1727
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:49,520
I'm itchy is Loki's number two pick.

1728
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:56,000
pick. If Whack-A-Child wasn't quite good enough for you, then we have, um, Whack-A-Parent

1729
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,820
would be the iToy game I would like to see. Whack-A-Parent. Because we all know that it's

1730
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:05,620
not really the kids' fault, it's their parents. So Whack-A-Parent is my number two pick.

1731
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:12,280
I would so own it at. Alright. Alright, uh, Jamie, you're number two. I'm sorry, you're

1732
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:18,200
number one. My last one, the thing is, I don't, it would require that you be able to play

1733
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:23,600
with two y-toys, honestly. Well that's fine, you're innovative. Okay. It would be called

1734
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:30,600
fuck with the other player's arrows mode. Where you would basically reach over on their

1735
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:36,960
side and move their arrows. You would actually reach over and rearrange their arrows. Exactly.

1736
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:41,840
Alright, I like that idea. Seriously, think about how crazy that would be. That would

1737
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:46,800
like fill a hole in your spin on Dance Battle. Could you just like knock all your own arrows

1738
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:51,800
Yeah, you can do that. You can shove your arrows over to their side.

1739
02:22:51,800 --> 02:23:06,800
Actually, that reminds me of, I don't know if anybody played You Don't Know Jack, but volume 4 has this mode where it's nail mode where you just pound the end key and all these nails go on a question so you can't read it and the person has to guess. They're like forced to guess.

1740
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:15,800
Alright, let's get the mic on over to Artadium42 for his number one pick for iToygame I would most like to see in DDR.

1741
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:21,800
Alright, my number one pick will be Dandruff White Christmas.

1742
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:26,800
There will be little people on the bottom of the screen and they're so wishing for a white Christmas.

1743
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:28,800
And you are the number one producer of Dandruff.

1744
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:32,160
And you are going to give them a nice white Christmas by shaking your head

1745
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:38,240
Into various directions to make sure they have a beautiful beautiful Christmas a lot of DDR players

1746
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:41,640
I know wouldn't need an eye toy actually for this. No. I'm kidding all right

1747
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:45,420
The ender of white Christmas mode very interesting, okay?

1748
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:49,240
Um DDR angel you're number one pick

1749
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:56,120
Actually, I'm gonna be completely kidding and go to the mini, but game darn it laughs the mini, but game. How does that work?

1750
02:23:56,120 --> 02:24:19,120
In WarioWare, there's this game where it says shoot, and you have to shoot water on this flower to make it spin, but the flower looks like an asshole.

1751
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:27,120
So it looks like this moving bidet that you're using to shoot water up somebody's asshole.

1752
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:32,120
So Angel wants to turn this into an itoy game. What was your real answer?

1753
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:36,120
My real answer was going to be mini Burger King time, but I don't know if that was going to work.

1754
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:42,120
I like the mini butt game. I'm going to actually take that to mini water in your asshole.

1755
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:55,120
Oh my god, how old are we people?

1756
02:24:55,120 --> 02:25:06,120
Oh shit!

1757
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:09,240
Rob is all red in the face now, this has got to be good.

1758
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:10,240
Oh god I love this.

1759
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:11,240
Here take the mic.

1760
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:12,240
Damn you!

1761
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:17,880
Alright I'll do it, I'll do it.

1762
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:24,720
No make, no make, make him do it, make him do it.

1763
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:25,720
Make him say it.

1764
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:34,440
Come here, come here, come here, it's okay, deep breaths.

1765
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:35,440
Alright, let's see.

1766
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:36,440
Oh, the next one.

1767
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:38,720
And my final one, number one.

1768
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:41,960
I have plenty more where this came from too, this just happens to be the one that comes

1769
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,960
to my head right now.

1770
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:45,400
Yeah, I pulled it out of my ass.

1771
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:49,120
This next one is basically like a quiz show game.

1772
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:55,320
It's kind of like you don't know Jack, where you get like three questions.

1773
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:59,200
And the problem will be that they're very hard.

1774
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:04,200
So, if you get the question wrong, you catch fire.

1775
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:13,200
It's called answer question or catch fire, and you can't play around too much because

1776
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:23,200
otherwise, you know, fire burns faster when you're moving, so that's, yeah.

1777
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:30,160
Another question or catch fire is Loki's choice and don't flail around too much because the

1778
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:34,240
fire just grows that way.

1779
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:35,240
Alright.

1780
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:39,640
It should have been burn victim the game.

1781
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:42,680
Now Loki's saying burn victim the game, nope too late.

1782
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:45,000
It's answer question or catch fire.

1783
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,840
Alright and again to relate this to DDR Eurobeat music would play in the background I should

1784
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:50,840
play.

1785
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:57,720
Alright, my number one pick for IToyGame I would like to see in DDR, you've seen Wacka

1786
02:26:57,720 --> 02:27:04,280
Child, you've seen Wacka Parent, but the best one by far is Wackapolitary, is my number

1787
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:05,280
one choice.

1788
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:06,280
Wackapolitary.

1789
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:07,280
Wackapolitary.

1790
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:11,480
Do you think you'd see that in like, Derby owners club?

1791
02:27:11,480 --> 02:27:13,400
Well, yeah, but that's a little different.

1792
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:17,680
Actually, Politary would come out on the screen, she would actually sing, broken my heart,

1793
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:20,680
and you can punch her in the stomach.

1794
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:27,680
to get her to stop so alright so that's my number one answer whack-a-policary

1795
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:31,960
alright now unfortunately comes the part

1796
02:27:31,960 --> 02:27:35,760
where we have to eliminate one off the list a piece

1797
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:39,320
so right now here is the list as it stands. Do you want to read this Jamie?

1798
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:43,800
Can you read it from back there? Okay. Alright. Bikini car wash the game

1799
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:48,720
life invaders chibi TDX for popin' music

1800
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:55,720
Break shit. Whack a child. Candy bar doll game. Evade the assassin's bullet

1801
02:27:55,720 --> 02:28:04,720
silent scope. Mini fly swatter nat attack. I'm itchy. Whack a parent. Fuck with the other

1802
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:13,720
player's arrows. Dandruff white Christmas. Mini water in your asshole day. Stop that.

1803
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:17,200
You're trying to make me bust up, okay?

1804
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:20,440
Answer a question or catch fire, or whack-a-policary.

1805
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:23,800
You know what, I should have read it like in that Margaret Cho- since we're talking about

1806
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:25,560
Margaret Cho and the chapter, I should have done,

1807
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:30,000
Galloping Critterous. Alright, this is hard. Honestly, these are all really good.

1808
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:34,320
I've got money. This is a very difficult elimination round for us, because there's a lot of these that are

1809
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:37,440
fucking funny. Yes, Angel? One comment about the whole thing is,

1810
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:41,320
oh my god, it's I Toy Meets WarioWare. I Toy Meets WarioWare.

1811
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:46,320
Alright, Jamie, you gotta take one off the list. Which number is coming off?

1812
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,320
Uh, dandruff white christmas goes.

1813
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:50,320
Alright, dandruff white christmas.

1814
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:51,320
Dandruff is nasty.

1815
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:54,320
Alright, that's too bad. Alright.

1816
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:55,320
Fired!

1817
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:58,320
Uh, Arkadian, your turn. You gotta take one off the list.

1818
02:28:58,320 --> 02:29:03,320
I see I have too many whack things to say. Whack a parent. It's more fun to whack kids.

1819
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:09,320
Alright, because it's more fun to whack kids than whack parents, uh, whack a parent is coming off the list. Alright.

1820
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:11,320
Angel, one of these has to come off the list.

1821
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:17,320
Um...

1822
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:22,320
I don't know. Candy Bar Doll Game.

1823
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:27,320
Candy Bar Doll Game. Yeah, that was a little gay, Jamie. Even you have to admit.

1824
02:29:29,320 --> 02:29:30,320
Alright.

1825
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:32,320
Loki, which one of these is coming off the list?

1826
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:41,440
off the list? Um, you know, as much as I don't like her, uh, wack-a-policary, because wack-a-child

1827
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:47,960
is the best. Yeah, wack-a-child is pretty. All right, wack-a-policary comes off the list,

1828
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:54,000
that's fine. Uh, me, I have to take one off the list, and I've got to say, I'm just not

1829
02:29:54,000 --> 02:30:00,280
feeling it for, um, chibi2dx, I'm sorry. Sorry, Angel. Yeah, why have a bimani-related game

1830
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:05,480
yeah one of the money related game anything all right

1831
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:07,640
by the fact that

1832
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:13,100
you can see if you can use the lucky method and pull it out of your ass

1833
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:15,560

02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:44,200
see it. Yeah, we were too busy laughing at answer question or catch fire. They were all

1865
02:32:44,200 --> 02:32:50,520
red in the face. It was cute. Actually, I was thinking you could combine the DER pad

1866
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:54,520
with the eye toy to create something sort of like a samurai game.

1867
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:55,520
He's saying...

1868
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:56,520
...run at each other.

1869
02:32:56,520 --> 02:32:57,520
We're having a hard time hearing you.

1870
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:02,520
I'm going to say that he's saying something about you could combine the DDR pad with the

1871
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:06,520
eye toy to make like a samurai game where you could run at each other type thing.

1872
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:07,520
Kind of like a...

1873
02:33:07,520 --> 02:33:08,520
Right.

1874
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:09,520
And then a punch to attack, basically.

1875
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:10,520
That's kind of like mocap.

1876
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:12,520
See, now that's a good, serious answer.

1877
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:17,520
Unfortunately, it's not funny, but it's actually a good answer as far as serious ones are concerned.

1878
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:21,520
I always thought they should have used the iToy to make a mocap boxing at home.

1879
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:24,520
Any other suggestions you got for us, John?

1880
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:25,520
Uh, that was it, basically.

1881
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:29,520
Alright, well that's actually a decent one, so you might want to send that on over to Konami, you never know.

1882
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:31,520
Alright, thanks for calling.

1883
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:32,520
No problem.

1884
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:33,520
Bye-bye.

1885
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:35,520
Let's see if I can answer this call real fast that's coming in.

1886
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:38,520
Uh, hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1887
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:39,520
Hello, Skype, Siggy here.

1888
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:42,520
Hey, Siggy, how you doing?

1889
02:33:42,520 --> 02:33:43,520
Yeah, hey, I'm doing fine.

1890
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:44,520
What's your suggestion?

1891
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:46,820
What's your suggestion?

1892
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:50,900
I never had that kind of laugh since episode sixty nine. He has not laughed that hard since

1893
02:33:50,900 --> 02:33:56,660
episode sixty nine when Loki sang I'm Coming Out. I wasn't here. I know you weren't even here, Jamie.

1894
02:33:56,660 --> 02:34:00,080
Alright, well, which one made you laugh the most?

1895
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:03,720
Well, of course, the one that says number thirteen.

1896
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:05,300
I really, you know,

1897
02:34:05,300 --> 02:34:09,840
the chatters right now, go for number thirteen. Number thirteen, the mini water in your

1898
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:12,980
asshole game is the one that made him laugh the most.

1899
02:34:12,980 --> 02:34:14,980
I was laughing really hard.

1900
02:34:14,980 --> 02:34:17,980
Oh, my stomach, you know, my stomach's really hurting.

1901
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,980
Well, I'm glad we could cause you such pain here on Orange Lake Radio.

1902
02:34:21,980 --> 02:34:22,980
Uh...

1903
02:34:22,980 --> 02:34:23,980
Take a deep breath.

1904
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:24,980
Are you okay?

1905
02:34:24,980 --> 02:34:25,980
Breathe in.

1906
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:28,980
Did you have any suggestions you wanted to pass along?

1907
02:34:28,980 --> 02:34:29,980
Well, I...

1908
02:34:29,980 --> 02:34:30,980
We can barely hear you.

1909
02:34:30,980 --> 02:34:32,980
Speak into your mic a little more.

1910
02:34:32,980 --> 02:34:33,980
Just, uh, yeah, that's it.

1911
02:34:33,980 --> 02:34:34,980
Just, uh, episode.

1912
02:34:34,980 --> 02:34:35,980
Yeah, I mean, uh, episode.

1913
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:37,980
I mean, uh, vote for number 13.

1914
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:38,980
All right, he's just saying,

1915
02:34:38,980 --> 02:34:39,980
vote for number 13.

1916
02:34:39,980 --> 02:34:40,980
Many water in your asshole game.

1917
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:43,980
Alright, we'll see, Siggy. We'll see. Thanks for calling.

1918
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:44,980
Later.

1919
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:45,980
Have a good one.

1920
02:34:45,980 --> 02:34:48,980
Oh, I love this phone thing. I love being able to talk to listeners. It's so cool.

1921
02:34:48,980 --> 02:34:52,980
Alright, we'll take more calls a little later, but we're going to take a break so we can tally up the votes.

1922
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:55,980
And when we come back, we're going to have the FUs of the week. But please don't send them in yet.

1923
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:57,980
Don't wait until we start the segment to send them in.

1924
02:34:57,980 --> 02:35:04,980
So, we'll be back after this break, featuring, since we did TAC songs, I thought maybe we could do some TACa songs.

1925
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:07,980
Including Leading Cyber Another, which Jamie wanted to hear earlier.

1926
02:35:07,980 --> 02:35:10,980
Being cyber or another makes me all, like, squishy.

1927
02:35:10,980 --> 02:35:15,100
Alright, so we'll be back after this break of Taka music while you guys vote on tonight's

1928
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:22,100
listless enjoy

1929
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:52,100
They can't control my mind

1930
02:35:52,100 --> 02:35:59,100
They can't control my mind

1931
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:35,100
My bad, I got a location test one in there, so let's do a better quality Taka song. Let's do this one.

1932
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:31,100
Oh

1933
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:01,100
Oh

1934
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:31,100
You

1935
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:49,700
For them steps wide to orange clouds, this GDR sucks!

1936
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:50,700
Holla!

1937
02:41:50,700 --> 02:41:51,700
Stop!

1938
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:52,700
Stop!

1939
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:53,700
Stop!

1940
02:41:53,700 --> 02:41:54,700
Stop!

1941
02:41:54,700 --> 02:41:55,700
Stop!

1942
02:41:55,700 --> 02:42:03,420
All right, we are back and we're about ready to get into the FUs of the week.

1943
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:08,580
We just have to wait for the chairman of the FU board to get back here and then we can

1944
02:42:08,580 --> 02:42:09,580
start things off.

1945
02:42:09,580 --> 02:42:10,580
Oh, what do you know?

1946
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:11,580
There she is.

1947
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:12,580
Excuse me.

1948
02:42:12,580 --> 02:42:14,580
I need to do a 10 to something.

1949
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:15,580
Thank you.

1950
02:42:15,580 --> 02:42:16,580
All right.

1951
02:42:16,580 --> 02:42:19,380
Yeah, you had to go worship the porcelain goddess.

1952
02:42:19,380 --> 02:42:20,380
No.

1953
02:42:20,380 --> 02:42:22,380
I'm just teasing.

1954
02:42:22,380 --> 02:42:23,380
Okay.

1955
02:42:23,380 --> 02:42:24,380
All right.

1956
02:42:24,380 --> 02:42:25,380
So we got to get this in.

1957
02:42:25,380 --> 02:42:28,500
Hopefully we have a little bit of time for Ask Orange Lounge, but I don't know.

1958
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:29,900
We definitely have to get this segment in.

1959
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:34,100
Why is it, Jamie, that we have to do these FUs every single week?

1960
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:36,100
Sometimes you just gotta let it out.

1961
02:42:36,100 --> 02:43:01,220
My first FU goes to the almost entirety of traffic on the road today, which is why I

1962
02:43:01,220 --> 02:43:06,820
stand by my desire to have a Humvee with a freaking missile launcher on it so that...

1963
02:43:06,820 --> 02:43:13,580
I finally saw it in action. I found a movie file on military.com of a Humvee with a missile

1964
02:43:13,580 --> 02:43:19,260
launcher blowing up a tank. And that like totally, you know, was so hot to me. So I

1965
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:30,260
decided that I really, really have to have one now. So I need one for traffic. Another

1966
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:37,820
Another F.U. goes toward, uh, I'm getting a little panicky about school so I guess this

1967
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:40,740
sort of goes to me for being kind of panicky about it.

1968
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:47,860
Another F.U. goes toward not having time and money and the ability to go visit who I want

1969
02:43:47,860 --> 02:43:48,860
to.

1970
02:43:48,860 --> 02:43:54,340
Although, I am planning on going to Alabama in November, so I'll come back action and

1971
02:43:54,340 --> 02:44:01,660
all and you'll have to make fun of me and I'll go off with y'all another one

1972
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:08,020
goes toward I'm gonna be very general with this and say people who just don't

1973
02:44:08,020 --> 02:44:14,220
get it you know you tell them and you point it out and they just don't get it

1974
02:44:14,220 --> 02:44:24,860
you know those people know another as you goes toward that stupid introduction

1975
02:44:24,860 --> 02:44:29,900
to Windows class that I have to take well you know what I say dear class fuck

1976
02:44:29,900 --> 02:44:33,780
you I'm petitioning the Dean so I can test out of it thank you I think I'm

1977
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:37,260
done oh yeah and then one goes to allergies not having any sinus medicine

1978
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:42,260
Alright, let's move on to Loki and his FUs of the week.

1979
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:49,260
Um, my first FU goes to the stupid trees which the limbs keep falling off of.

1980
02:44:49,260 --> 02:44:55,260
I swear to God, I know I'm going to be walking to the apartment during the night, all of a sudden this limb is going to fall on me.

1981
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:57,260
And that's going to suck.

1982
02:44:57,260 --> 02:45:26,260
Also, fuck you, the SUV drivers. I swear to God, I just saw, like, um, yesterday, two, um, different instances where SUVs crashed into things. First one being into a truck, and the second time, a Humvee jumped the rail and hit another car, because it was, um, an H2. It's not a real Hummer. Yeah, it's not a real Hummer, but, you know.

1983
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:31,780
in h2 because you know some and and it was a woman was a woman driving it I

1984
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:37,900
bet you she was on a cell phone too I want to sort of insert a nephew there to

1985
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:42,220
the h2 they look like shit yeah if you want a hummer you freaking get one that

1986
02:45:42,220 --> 02:45:47,620
looks like it's you know armored that it can run over buildings and live I don't

1987
02:45:47,620 --> 02:45:50,840
have a problem with women driving SUVs or anything like that it's just when you

1988
02:45:50,840 --> 02:45:54,820
drive with cell phones and don't pay attention to shit then you get in an

1989
02:45:54,820 --> 02:46:00,680
Accidents and they kill people because I know there was the stretcher there and they were sure as hell blocking traffic. So

1990
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:04,440
huh, anyways, fuck you them and

1991
02:46:06,820 --> 02:46:08,880
Fuck you to Alien vs. Predator

1992
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:11,580
God damn it. That was a waste of two hours

1993
02:46:12,180 --> 02:46:14,180
But it was a funny-ass movie

1994
02:46:14,980 --> 02:46:16,820
Alien vs. Predator

1995
02:46:16,820 --> 02:46:20,100
Yeah, who do I thunk it that it was a buddy comedy?

1996
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:30,860
my god lame but you know I should have known better going into it and finally I

1997
02:46:30,860 --> 02:46:35,900
don't know that's it I'm done oh that's right talk to you to my co-worker

1998
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:40,500
actually this is quite funny because the one that was sleeping around she's

1999
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:51,360
getting demoted she couldn't cut it shows you that it takes more than just

2000
02:46:51,360 --> 02:47:04,960
sleeping around to get into sales bitch all right that's all my turn F you to

2001
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:09,960
getting sick and F you to having a special friend that you keep passing

2002
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:18,440
diseases back and forth too. I mean like colds, people. Don't think dirty. Also, I would like

2003
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:24,240
to say a big F you to faggoty drama queens, and I know that faggot is a derogatory term

2004
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:28,200
and I don't use it unless I really mean it, okay? This guy I know, he's a real faggot,

2005
02:47:28,200 --> 02:47:31,600
okay? And I'm gay, so I'm allowed to say that word. Like there's a difference between a

2006
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:37,120
gay person and like a total faggot, okay? And this guy fizzes me off because he is such

2007
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:40,480
a fucking drama queen you wouldn't even imagine

2008
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:42,580
i haven't seen this guy in like five years

2009
02:47:42,580 --> 02:47:46,580
and then like last night i ran into him and there was just this aura

2010
02:47:46,580 --> 02:47:48,440
of just like

2011
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:51,600
drama-ness that you wouldn't even look me in the eye

2012

uh... every fifty minutes god damn kids come on

2025
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:30,880
yes that there is a life but he made the polls on the commercial

2026
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:33,680
damn kids are so fucking annoying

2027
02:48:33,680 --> 02:48:38,120
I want to shoot the goddamn radio for this stupid kid.

2028
02:48:38,120 --> 02:48:41,120
Looks like it stabbed him through the radio.

2029
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:42,720
Oh no, I'm dying.

2030
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:44,800
Oh, Kenny, where are you?

2031
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:46,980
Oh, let's see what else.

2032
02:48:46,980 --> 02:48:50,080
Fuck you though, radio commercials that have songs that

2033
02:48:50,080 --> 02:48:52,560
take, oh, I like this song.

2034
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:54,120
And then it's a fucking commercial.

2035
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:56,920
I hope your business goes down in flames.

2036
02:48:56,920 --> 02:48:59,720
Unfortunately, it's like one of those damn

2037
02:48:59,720 --> 02:49:02,200
car dealerships of Satan that

2038
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:04,400
going forever

2039
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:07,220
uh... but into the trees of work that uh...

2040
02:49:07,220 --> 02:49:09,240
or staff on the

2041
02:49:09,240 --> 02:49:10,680
one week are

2042
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:13,880
i can only afford uh... and for you that i can afford that you know

2043
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:14,800
for what they did

2044
02:49:14,800 --> 02:49:17,400
really felt that often

2045
02:49:17,400 --> 02:49:23,000
scraping scrub and everything

2046
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,440
being nearly penniless

2047
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:25,680
have been planned out

2048
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:27,300
months in advance

2049
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:28,880
where my money's going

2050
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:32,660
But hopefully that will change in like a month or two.

2051
02:49:32,660 --> 02:49:35,260
And fuck you to not be able to go places.

2052
02:49:35,260 --> 02:49:40,340
And not be able to go to the arcades or anything.

2053
02:49:40,340 --> 02:49:41,560
Yay, that's all.

2054
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:43,320
Alright, DDR Angel.

2055
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:45,880
Alright, uh, well...

2056
02:49:45,880 --> 02:49:51,400
I know you guys have said this FU over and over and over again, but see, now that I live here,

2057
02:49:51,400 --> 02:49:54,240
I really know what you're talking about.

2058
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:57,260
FUs are the freakin' stupid drivers around here.

2059
02:49:57,260 --> 02:50:06,560
They've almost killed us, like, I don't know, at least five times as I can recall this week while driving around Sacramento, so it's like, wow.

2060
02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:22,260
And, um, also F.U. to the main post office that, eh, I can talk, post office in Sacramento because they, uh, have still decided to hold our mail, so we're not getting all of it like we should be.

2061
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:25,440
Oh well, I guess that's the

2062
02:50:25,440 --> 02:50:27,020
downside to moving.

2063
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:28,540
Also,

2064
02:50:28,540 --> 02:50:31,660
Magus wants to send an F.U. to

2065
02:50:31,660 --> 02:50:36,900
big workservers going down, because now he's going to have to explain himself

2066
02:50:36,900 --> 02:50:39,420
on Wednesday

2067
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:42,980
as to why the server went down for four hours.

2068
02:50:42,980 --> 02:50:47,260
So he's going to have some extra work to do, it looks like. Oh well.

2069
02:50:47,260 --> 02:50:49,460
Alright, I guess that's uh, I don't know.

2070
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:51,460
I guess that's it. I'm done. Whatever.

2071
02:51:19,460 --> 02:51:21,460
That's so cool.

2072
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:54,760
information pan duh I counted your vote for song two because I saw that you

2073
02:51:54,760 --> 02:52:01,760

2074
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:08,400

all right moving on violent hyper girl says f you to fanboys nephew to

2076
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:20,500
three-dimensional calculus when it involves solving the moment of inertia in some solid

2077
02:52:20,500 --> 02:52:24,240
object because it involves three intervals, each of which takes almost a third of a page.

2078
02:52:24,240 --> 02:52:28,920
Okay, I'm getting bored here. Also, F you to leaving my friend's birthday party on Saturday

2079
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:32,040
night. If I didn't have to go to Davis the next day, I would have stayed all night and

2080
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:35,720
just caught a ride with someone. But yeah, an F you to ants. They need to die. Heart

2081
02:52:35,720 --> 02:52:42,240
raid. By the way, an F you goes to a particular person who acts like they know everything.

2082
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:47,240
are an idiot, period. I don't like saying F.U.'s to individuals in particular.

2083
02:52:47,240 --> 02:52:50,840
Ry Chan says, F.U. to drama queens that blame the drama on everyone else and break up a

2084
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:54,840
community in the process. Ooh, I agree with that. F.U. to garbage that is on welfare and

2085
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:59,840
feels they need to have children because their boyfriend is going to take care of me.

2086
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:02,960
Amen to that.

2087
02:53:02,960 --> 02:53:07,340
Dark Tetsuya says, F.U. to keyboard hotkeys. I hit one on accident and it shut down my

2088
02:53:07,340 --> 02:53:14,600
on my computer. MJB says, my FU of the week goes to god damn toys and joys dot com for

2089
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:20,820
sending me my Max 2 Japanese after two weeks of waiting but forgetting to send party collection.

2090
02:53:20,820 --> 02:53:26,500
I hate you toys and joys. You know what, I've got a free copy of fantasy star collection

2091
02:53:26,500 --> 02:53:35,380
out of them. John Field says, FU to Microsoft and XP service pack 2 again because I'm still

2092
02:53:35,380 --> 02:53:38,500
crashing f you to the laws of physics it would be much easier if I didn't need to

02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:45,420
use any fuel to drive my car f you to moving between dorm rooms misty says the

2094
02:53:45,420 --> 02:53:48,940
closest thing to a real f you that I've gotten this week is to myself for not

2095
02:53:48,940 --> 02:53:53,820
being able to think shit up for my RPG and the works of fanfiction I've got

2096
02:53:53,820 --> 02:53:58,180
linaria says f you to physical distance because I found the guy online that I

2097
02:53:58,180 --> 02:54:02,380
really like but he lives hundreds of miles from me

2098
02:54:02,380 --> 02:54:09,380
Dark Knight says, F you to the USA basketball team for getting the ass kicked by Puerto Rico today.

2099
02:54:09,380 --> 02:54:12,380
That is kind of funny.

2100
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:15,380
Zao Zao, I hope I said that right.

2101
02:54:15,380 --> 02:54:19,380
Zao Zao says, F you to my connection for being so shitty. Fuck you.

2102
02:54:19,380 --> 02:54:26,380
F you, Nickel City, for ripping off Konami and using StepMania.

2103
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:29,380
Nickel City.

2104
02:54:59,380 --> 02:55:06,380
And lastly, oh, that wasn't even the nephew, but, uh, it was a personal question for me from somebody. So I guess that was the last one.

2105
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:08,380
Aw. Aw, I know. Sad, huh?

2106
02:55:08,380 --> 02:55:21,380
Wow, uh, about the Toys and Joys' nephew, that's the first time I've actually heard someone, like, negatively bash them except for when I didn't get my controller, but, you know, I got it, like, five days later.

2107
02:55:21,380 --> 02:55:26,140
actually heard someone like negatively bash them except for when I didn't get

2108
02:55:26,140 --> 02:55:32,100
my controller but you know I got it like five days later so it doesn't matter all

2109
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:36,260
right I have never had a problem with toys and toys when I when we were really

2110
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:42,380
big into the Sega Aegis 2500 we had ordered a bunch of games from there and

2111
02:55:42,380 --> 02:55:47,460
all of our others arrived they actually sent me an email saying you know fantasy

2112
02:55:47,460 --> 02:55:50,500

02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:57,800

02:55:57,800 --> 02:56:06,560

2129
02:57:12,320 --> 02:57:20,460
oh and answer question or catch fire also got third place this is where

2130
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:26,780
angels thought bubble goes dot dot dot I won what I know me too dot dot dot yeah

2131
02:57:26,780 --> 02:57:29,860
but she had a little help from the rest of us you were gonna say you were gonna

2132
02:57:29,860 --> 02:57:33,260
say the WarioWare thing and nobody got that was much funnier when we said water

2133
02:57:33,260 --> 02:57:40,140
in your asshole that is the WarioWare nevermind I guess it was better than I

2134
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:42,140
I guess it was better than that BurgerTime thing.

2135
02:57:44,140 --> 02:57:59,140
Alright, and showing the true mentality age of most of our chat room chatters and our listeners, the game that has the word asshole in it wins, so good job.

2136
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:02,140
I think that's the first time that that's actually happened.

2137
02:58:02,140 --> 02:58:13,140
Other thoughts of mine were like, regulate your bitches mode, you know, where you just get to bitch slap your fucking hoes and shit. I thought that was funny.

2138
02:58:14,140 --> 02:58:15,140
What? Here.

2139
02:58:15,140 --> 02:58:17,140
I could have had whack a hoe.

2140
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:19,140
No, it's pimpin' hoes mode.

2141
02:58:19,140 --> 02:58:21,140
Pimpin' hoes mode, yeah.

2142
02:58:21,140 --> 02:58:40,140
Or, like, um, my favorite, uh, call the assurance expector, um, at a toy factory mode. Basically, you get to throw in a bunch of, like, sharp razor blades and stuff into, like, the stuffed animals. But, see, you have certain items that you can put in the animals, and you just have to get the right one, you know, depending on what it is.

2143
02:58:40,140 --> 02:58:55,140
I'm thinking of one that's like, there was one of those little Flash games that was where you would have this phallus and shoot into these condoms as they went by. They should have, like, Condom Tester the game.

2144
02:58:55,140 --> 02:59:01,140
Um, Angel, I have some questions for you as the author of, um...

2145
02:59:01,140 --> 02:59:02,140
Oh, shit!

2146
02:59:02,140 --> 02:59:03,140
What?

2147
02:59:03,140 --> 02:59:04,140
What?

2148
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:05,140
Loki, what?

2149
02:59:05,140 --> 02:59:12,940
Oh, this is, this is like, okay, there's the line, and I'm crossing it, okay, um...

2150
02:59:12,940 --> 02:59:15,140
Do your own abortion mode!

2151
02:59:15,140 --> 02:59:17,800
Stop it!

2152
02:59:17,800 --> 02:59:18,800
You're horrible.

2153
02:59:18,800 --> 02:59:19,800
Alright.

2154
02:59:19,800 --> 02:59:20,900
uh...

2155
02:59:20,900 --> 02:59:23,980
angel as the author of uh...

2156
02:59:23,980 --> 02:59:27,060
uh... many water in your asshole game i have some questions

2157
02:59:27,060 --> 02:59:29,180
uh... have you ever played i toy groove

2158
02:59:29,180 --> 02:59:33,220
no i don't like where group takes pictures and video of you as you play

2159
02:59:33,220 --> 02:59:38,100
would armament many water in your asshole game do the same thing

2160
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:41,500
okay i don't know what you know that you know um... that you could actually drop

2161
02:59:41,500 --> 02:59:45,100
trial in front of the camera and said that we're going to have a really it

2162
02:59:45,100 --> 02:59:48,620
What was that really fucked up Japanese game that had the vibrator shit?

2163
02:59:48,620 --> 02:59:51,860
Rez? Rez. God.

2164
02:59:51,860 --> 02:59:57,500
I know, like, there's the Abunga game, where you stick the finger in the ass.

2165
02:59:57,500 --> 03:00:01,080
Abunga-bunga. Somebody in our chat room actually suggested that. I saw that go by.

2166
03:00:01,080 --> 03:00:04,560
I can't believe, though, that Abunga actually was, like, a real game and they had a party

2167
03:00:04,560 --> 03:00:07,580
for it and everything.

2168
03:00:07,580 --> 03:00:10,540
My other question about mini water in your asshole game.

2169
03:00:10,540 --> 03:00:14,220
once you get the water in your asshole would you be able to shoot it back out?

2170
03:00:14,220 --> 03:00:20,900
on that note it's about time to end

2171
03:00:20,900 --> 03:00:24,440
the show here so we're gonna go around and get everybody's final

2172
03:00:24,440 --> 03:00:30,740
thought. DDR Angel, your final thought please.

2173
03:00:30,740 --> 03:00:34,140
I did not expect the

2174
03:00:34,140 --> 03:00:37,860
butt thing to win but okay whatever. You just don't know this show well enough

2175
03:00:37,860 --> 03:00:42,180
You've been listening how long now and you're the official historian of the show and you

2176
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:47,700
don't know that some joke, a dick and fart joke, a dick fart or asshole joke is always

2177
03:00:47,700 --> 03:00:48,700
going to win.

2178
03:00:48,700 --> 03:00:49,700
Always.

2179
03:00:49,700 --> 03:00:50,700
Of course.

2180
03:00:50,700 --> 03:00:51,700
You should know better.

2181
03:00:51,700 --> 03:00:52,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2182
03:00:52,700 --> 03:00:53,700
Okay.

2183
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:54,700
Well, okay.

2184
03:00:54,700 --> 03:00:56,900
The fact that it was my pick kind of messed it all up.

2185
03:00:56,900 --> 03:00:57,900
I'm like, wow.

2186
03:00:57,900 --> 03:00:59,940
I actually, I don't know.

2187
03:00:59,940 --> 03:01:01,580
People actually chose what I wanted to do.

2188
03:01:01,580 --> 03:01:02,580
All right.

2189
03:01:02,580 --> 03:01:03,580
Get over yourself.

2190
03:01:03,580 --> 03:01:04,580
All right.

2191
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:08,580
Arkadian42, your final thought, please.

2192
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:17,580
Things may be looking up, my future may be coming on, yay.

2193
03:01:18,580 --> 03:01:20,580
Loki, your final thought, please.

2194
03:01:25,580 --> 03:01:27,580
I'm... tired.

2195
03:01:28,580 --> 03:01:31,580
I got yogurt. That's gonna suck later.

2196
03:01:31,580 --> 03:01:38,580
I hope you all have a wonderful week, and listen to Orangelan's radio lots.

2197
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:06,620
By Popular Demand, The Orange On It Radio Rewind, and probably, we're looking, I actually

2198
03:02:06,620 --> 03:02:10,000
might bump it up a little bit to like six o'clock so our East Coast friends don't have

2199
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:14,380
to stay up so late to hear the show, maybe even five, we'll see.

2200
03:02:14,380 --> 03:02:21,740
My final thought is actually listen to Pump Up The Volume on Tuesday night, starting at,

2201
03:02:21,740 --> 03:02:24,980
I tend to start around a quarter to seven if I get early, but usually pre-show starts

2202
03:02:24,980 --> 03:02:29,580
at seven, show starts at seven thirty, goes to whenever, I will likely be doing homework

2203
03:02:29,580 --> 03:02:36,420
the whole time but uh I'm thinking you know I play a lot of dancy happy crappy

2204
03:02:36,420 --> 03:02:42,540
stuff I'm just gonna go for broke and say screw you RIAA I'm playing Metallica

2205
03:02:42,540 --> 03:02:51,340
S&M concert and like a bunch of hair rock and like some Rumsstein and and I

2206
03:02:51,340 --> 03:02:57,480
don't know I might go in some like Danzig and Henry Rollins just for the

2207
03:02:57,480 --> 03:03:02,880
hell of it. Nothing happy, dancy, poppy for me. Okay, maybe a little bit. Maybe a free

2208
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:09,280
show. And some inflow. I'll play some inflow to make the inflow people happy. I will play

2209
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:16,480
some inflow in Crystal K. How's that? It's mostly going to be the Metallica S&M concert

2210
03:03:16,480 --> 03:03:20,160
because that's just really, really freaking rad. That's it.

2211
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:22,480
Alright. That should be a very interesting show then.

2212
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:30,480
Oh hell yeah! Excuse me. I used to stay up late watching Saturday Night Live and then Headbanger's Ball.

2213
03:03:30,480 --> 03:03:36,480
And then it was 120 minutes for a long time. So yeah, I remember the days of Headbanger's Ball.

2214
03:03:38,480 --> 03:03:45,480
Alright, the final word of the show, I'm actually going to give it to Angel because she whispered a good one in my ear so I want her to say it.

2215
03:03:45,480 --> 03:03:47,480
Oh, do you want me to say the whole thing or just the one word?

2216
03:03:47,480 --> 03:03:49,480
No, just the one word. The final word of the show is...

2217
03:03:49,480 --> 03:03:50,480
Vortex!

2218
03:03:50,480 --> 03:03:54,480

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2223
03:04:40,480 --> 03:04:44,480
For the good thing he's found

2224
03:04:44,480 --> 03:04:49,480
If he is his friend, he can't see it

2225
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:53,480
She can't do no wrong

2226
03:04:53,480 --> 03:04:56,480
Rhode Island Red is his best friend

2227
03:04:56,480 --> 03:04:59,480
He can't put her down

2228
03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:04,480
When a man wants a chicken

2229
03:05:04,480 --> 03:05:08,480
Spend his very last dime

2230
03:05:08,480 --> 03:05:14,480
Buying her fresh corn down at the grain and feed

2231
03:05:14,480 --> 03:05:19,480
If he'll build a nest for her comfort

2232
03:05:19,480 --> 03:05:23,480
And sleep out in the coop

2233
03:05:23,480 --> 03:05:29,480
If she says that's the way it's got to be

2234
03:05:29,480 --> 03:05:45,480
Well, this man loves his chicken She lays them all the eggs she had

2235
03:05:45,480 --> 03:05:58,480
Tell the farmer that nothing's gone wrong Believe me, she's cockin' just cause she's blind

2236
03:05:58,480 --> 03:06:04,480
When a man loves a chicken

2237
03:06:04,480 --> 03:06:08,480
And people think that it is wrong

2238
03:06:08,480 --> 03:06:11,480
He shouldn't think he speaks

2239
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:14,480
And words don't belong

2240
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:19,480
Just when a man loves a chicken

2241
03:06:19,480 --> 03:06:23,480
I know exactly how he speaks

2242
03:06:23,480 --> 03:06:25,480
Hey baby, baby, baby

2243
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:41,480
When a man loves a chicken, you know exactly how he feels, shacked up into his house with

2244
03:06:41,480 --> 03:06:44,480
the good things he found.

2245
03:06:44,480 --> 03:06:54,480
When a man loves a chicken, people think that he's insane, but all he can do is wing it

2246
03:06:54,480 --> 03:07:18,120
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
