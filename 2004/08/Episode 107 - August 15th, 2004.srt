1
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,870
And now for our feature presentation.

2
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:25,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

3
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:32,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.

4
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:40,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

5
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:49,555
[SPEAKER_15]: If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!

6
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:54,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

7
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:04,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

8
00:01:04,423 --> 00:01:06,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

9
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,981
[SPEAKER_21]: He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

10
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

11
00:01:15,062 --> 00:01:15,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Hamburgers!

12
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:18,722
[SPEAKER_21]: The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

13
00:01:18,982 --> 00:01:20,343
[SPEAKER_21]: That was huge.

14
00:01:21,303 --> 00:01:21,823
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.

15
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:26,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

16
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:30,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.

17
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen my... Lena?

18
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

19
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:37,286
[SPEAKER_21]: So it was you.

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,421
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

21
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:08,475
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live, and this is episode number 107 for this August the 15th of 2004.

22
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:17,703
[SPEAKER_05]: You're tuned in to the Bee Money Scene's most unexciting radio station of all things, Bee Money.

23
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:21,286
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

24
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:27,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

25
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,613
[SPEAKER_05]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

26
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:34,551
[SPEAKER_19]: That was very anticlimactic, your little... I know.

27
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:36,552
[SPEAKER_18]: We're old.

28
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:38,353
[SPEAKER_05]: We're old?

29
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:39,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

30
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You realize, you, me, Loki, we're about five years older than the Bomani average, right?

31
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:47,637
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, maybe ten.

32
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:53,420
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if our show's ready for retirement or it's a nursing home or something.

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,540
[SPEAKER_19]: We're still kicking.

34
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to turn our mics up just a tad.

35
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:59,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not adjust your volume on your... Okay, we're up a little bit there.

36
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:04,097
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I going to say?

37
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:05,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're ready to quit doing this show?

38
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:06,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

39
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:09,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have to bring your hate to the masses.

40
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,381
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to quit for like five seconds.

41
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:11,801
[SPEAKER_19]: I quit.

42
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie!

43
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:14,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie!

44
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:16,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'm not quitting anymore.

45
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

46
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough, that's not the first time she's threatened to quit the show.

47
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:21,805
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

48
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:22,485
[SPEAKER_04]: When have I ever?

49
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:22,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

50
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:23,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

51
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:24,846
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

52
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us is our third co-host, our third wheel.

53
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,833
[SPEAKER_05]: The Tech Master, Loki!

54
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:33,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi!

55
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,155
[SPEAKER_05]: The mic is quite loud today!

56
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,936
[SPEAKER_05]: That means you do not scream in it, you just talk like normal.

57
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:39,437
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

58
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:41,338
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a loud voice.

59
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:44,519
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a loud man voice, so you can take it away from the mouth a little.

60
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:49,081
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole show I'm just going to be like, I'm going to mubble.

61
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:50,002
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?

62
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:51,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

63
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:52,923
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?

64
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:55,433
[SPEAKER_05]: You going to go?

65
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:56,994
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

66
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us tonight, we have some very special guests.

67
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,942
[SPEAKER_05]: We have somebody who hasn't been here in a few weeks.

68
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:04,703
[SPEAKER_05]: He's always kind of here.

69
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:05,985
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like our mascot.

70
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's kind of like the mascot because he's here.

71
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:11,411
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't talk a whole lot, but neither does the guy in the chicken suit at the football game.

72
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:13,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm dubbing him our mascot.

73
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:14,855
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Arcadian42.

74
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:17,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, I had gas today.

75
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:19,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops, I'm in my car and I had gas today.

76
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:21,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get a go team go?

77
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:25,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Go team... Stop, stop, don't go anymore.

78
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:31,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'm not going.

79
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:33,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And where have you been, young man?

80
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:33,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Where have you been?

81
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:35,777
[SPEAKER_05]: At my apartment.

82
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,178
[SPEAKER_05]: You missed a big show last week.

83
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:41,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I didn't have a guess last week, though.

84
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,468
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually had a big show last week.

85
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually afraid to see how many people come back.

86
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:49,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Because last week, our show was dominated by this song.

87
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, this Akira song that I guess was big or something.

88
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,591
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to play, and there was tons of people here.

89
00:04:55,631 --> 00:05:00,272
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm kind of curious how many actually come back to hear what the real train wreck sounds like tonight.

90
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:04,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Because on tonight's platter, you guys, absolutely nothing.

91
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:08,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

92
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:11,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

93
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:18,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, also with us tonight, the lovely DDR Angel is back this week.

94
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:19,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

95
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,420
[SPEAKER_17]: I have cheese-its.

96
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

97
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:23,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Mmm, cheese-its.

98
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:24,361
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind?

99
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:26,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, cheddar and jack.

100
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:26,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't ask.

101
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:30,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit more later.

102
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:33,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to definitely play some How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day when we come back.

103
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:36,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I suppose we have some Bomani news too we should take care of.

104
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:39,250
[SPEAKER_19]: Attention, John Field, my name is not Jammie.

105
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:42,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

106
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:44,273
[SPEAKER_19]: One M, please.

107
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:47,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, we'll scold you if you want to join our chatroom.

108
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:52,998
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, and be berated by the lovely DarkSakura.

109
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:53,579
[SPEAKER_04]: This one?

110
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:54,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you're welcome.

111
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, in this break, I thought we could do some booty-rific music from DDR Solo 2000.

112
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:01,569
[SPEAKER_05]: because I wanted to hear I'm Alive.

113
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:05,435
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do some Don't Clock Me and maybe some Captain Jack too in this break.

114
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:09,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio.

115
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:49,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dream a dream together A dream that is real

116
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:54,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to rock!

117
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:42,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch, get a new song.

118
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:46,025
[SPEAKER_04]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

119
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:11,609
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

120
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:12,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, hello.

121
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,011
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, bitch.

122
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:15,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a new song, Orange Lines Radio.

123
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:19,676
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the old school promos back when it sounded like we were talking through two tin cans.

124
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:20,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.

125
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:21,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were at that time.

126
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:25,101
[SPEAKER_18]: We were emulating our hero, the tin can lady from DDR Solo.

127
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:28,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we have a budget all of a sudden, suddenly here on this show.

128
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:28,764
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.

129
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:29,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, two cents.

130
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us money.

131
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me money.

132
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:36,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm thinking about putting a poll on the website next week.

133
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,539
[SPEAKER_05]: You should go to our website and always take the poll.

134
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:40,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And take old polls, too, because polls are important.

135
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,021
[SPEAKER_18]: But remember, when you're done taking them, give them back.

136
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:46,521
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this week's poll, anyway?

137
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:46,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget.

138
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:47,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Over on OrangeLaundry.com.

139
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it has something to do with Xbox.

140
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:51,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was about that quad mode.

141
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Which we'll talk about later, that quad mode on Ultramix.

142
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:57,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to know what you guys think about quad mode on Ultramix 2.

143
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about this later.

144
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,761
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to go vote in our poll on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

145
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:06,204
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a poll coming up soon about who wants to buy an Orange Lounge t-shirt.

146
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:11,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I happen to have a friend at work who has a friend that owns a t-shirt business.

147
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:14,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Who can get us some deals on t-shirts.

148
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:17,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about doing a little money making for the show, so...

149
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:21,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if we're going to have to raise that cap thanks to last week's show, so we'll see.

150
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's locked out of the stream tonight, though.

151
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Plenty of spots still available if you have a friend that wants to listen to the show.

152
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:28,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

153
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:31,311
[SPEAKER_19]: And if they don't want to, make them.

154
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:31,951
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

155
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:37,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly, you know, there's all these past polls on the site, too, that you can still go take.

156
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll see who wants a shirt.

157
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:40,093
[SPEAKER_19]: The polls are fun.

158
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:40,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the polls are fun.

159
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:41,713
[SPEAKER_19]: They're interesting.

160
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:42,113
[SPEAKER_19]: They are.

161
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,394
[SPEAKER_19]: In a poll-like way.

162
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:44,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

163
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:48,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a whole lot of sites that do DDR polling out there.

164
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:52,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, of course there's DDR Freak, but unfortunately we only get one new poll a month there.

165
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And who else does polls on their site?

166
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:56,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of any.

167
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,191
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a few other, but they're not really Bimani related.

168
00:12:59,231 --> 00:12:59,872
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not us.

169
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:00,753
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the important thing.

170
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:01,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're not us.

171
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So go support the Orange Lawn Radio poll.

172
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, tonight, lots to talk about in the Bimani world.

173
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we're going to do tonight, because last week was kind of,

174
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:15,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

175
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:35,204
[SPEAKER_19]: We knew him back in the days of his old nickname.

176
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:36,625
[SPEAKER_05]: We listened to him when he was underground.

177
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:38,507
[SPEAKER_18]: We saw him dunk.

178
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the thing, is that the weekend he comes back, I don't know if I should say what weekend he might come back, because it depends on work.

179
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:52,138
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's the weekend I'm thinking it is, it's the weekend that Jamie might be going camping.

180
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:54,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way, it's the next weekend we're probably going to do a dunk show.

181
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:56,922
[SPEAKER_05]: When would that be?

182
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:58,623
[SPEAKER_19]: When I'm going camping.

183
00:13:59,003 --> 00:13:59,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you suck!

184
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:03,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright, we'll see, we'll see.

185
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:07,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to go... Two weeks we're doing a drug show, or at least I'm doing a drug show.

186
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:08,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have Monday off or something?

187
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:13,020
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'll take Monday off on my birthday weekend.

188
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

189
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie will do... We'll celebrate the crashing of planes.

190
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:22,425
[SPEAKER_19]: If I'm here, I'll do a shot of tequila, but I'm not going to drink like I did last time.

191
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,367
[SPEAKER_19]: You know how I drank last time.

192
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I remember that.

193
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:33,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Tequila is not low-carb.

194
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll have Sigrid back in a few weeks.

195
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:46,645
[SPEAKER_05]: But since last week was kind of dominated by him being here, not only that, but us teasing everybody with the Uran thing, and then we also had Pirate Power was here, and who else was here?

196
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel was here, Anita.

197
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:53,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kind of pushed all the Mamani news aside, except for the Uran thing, and hints.

198
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,470
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the running gag last week was that everything was a hint.

199
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

200
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:01,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're actually going to go back and talk about some of the Bimani news from last week and this week.

201
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's been a lot in the past two weeks.

202
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,430
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of Bimani news.

203
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,512
[SPEAKER_19]: I did notice, though, a general consensus.

204
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,795
[SPEAKER_19]: I think a lot of people like the original better.

205
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:09,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.

206
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:10,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer the remix.

207
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I do prefer the remix.

208
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:12,859
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to say I like the original better.

209
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's certainly better suited for DDR.

210
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:17,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, yeah, for DDR, but I mean as a song.

211
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:20,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would just depend on the mood I'm in.

212
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:27,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I think the original works better in the scope of a Silent Hill soundtrack, but the new one works better for a dance-y soundtrack.

213
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:28,094
[SPEAKER_18]: True.

214
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:33,420
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll play it again tonight, because I know some people may have missed it last week, so we'll play it again tonight at some point.

215
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,542
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't make you wait two hours this time, we'll play it soon.

216
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:46,612
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'll have some other songs we have to play too because, you know, they announced a bunch of stuff for Ultramix and some of you guys, even though they're from 2DX, you haven't heard it before so we definitely want to make sure you hear this before the game comes out.

217
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:47,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Rob.

218
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:47,452
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

219
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:48,312
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

220
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:48,713
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

221
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:49,353
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

222
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:49,733
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

223
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:50,133
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

224
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:50,413
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

225
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:51,334
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just getting out of the way early.

226
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:56,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

227
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:59,077
[SPEAKER_05]: My baby won't work for you.

228
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:00,498
[SPEAKER_05]: My prop isn't working.

229
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:00,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit.

230
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,919
[SPEAKER_05]: All my work is about to fall off the table.

231
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:04,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Throw me the baby.

232
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold on.

233
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:05,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

234
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:11,235
[SPEAKER_19]: Wee, babies.

235
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:14,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, moving on.

236
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,538
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to get this out of the way, though, because this is how we start off every show.

237
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:21,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to talk a little bit about how was your week, how was your day.

238
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And starting us off, as always, the lovely DarkSakura is going to say how her week was and how her day was.

239
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:30,044
[SPEAKER_19]: My week was pretty dull.

240
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it was just work.

241
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Except that I started class on Wednesday.

242
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,993
[SPEAKER_19]: I had my first orientation for one of my online classes.

243
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:48,361
[SPEAKER_19]: And I took another orientation on Saturday and dropped some really retarded class that they're making me take, which was Intro to Windows.

244
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:51,063
[SPEAKER_19]: When I found out what the last course was, I dropped it so fast.

245
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:57,329
[SPEAKER_19]: The last assignment in that class, Rob, is How to Rename and Move Files.

246
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that sounds difficult.

247
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,766
[SPEAKER_19]: That sounds really stupid.

248
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:04,986
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, I know five-year-olds that can rename files, okay?

249
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:13,768
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I just, I dropped the class, and I'm going to petition the dean next quarter, next semester, to let me test out of it.

250
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:21,189
[SPEAKER_19]: Since I could do that with, like, you know, Windows 3.1, way back when.

251
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,830
[SPEAKER_19]: I could rename files in DOS.

252
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:26,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

253
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:29,945
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah.

254
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember DOS?

255
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:31,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember?

256
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:33,508
[SPEAKER_05]: You were using Windows back when it was underground.

257
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:34,789
[SPEAKER_19]: I sure was.

258
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,675
[SPEAKER_19]: Back when this little, you know, kid in college thought he was brilliant and was going to make a different operating system.

259
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:44,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Back when they were an indie band, you were using Windows.

260
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:51,964
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but, um... But I'm going to... There's a bunch of classes I'm going to test out because they're really stupid.

261
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:55,807
[SPEAKER_19]: But, um... And, uh...

262
00:17:57,045 --> 00:18:08,315
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also planning on going back to finish... I'm thinking about double majoring, so I'm still sort of considering that.

263
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:15,020
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's just been work, school stuff, a little bit of personal drama in my life.

264
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:16,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing major.

265
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:24,749
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been kind of stressed out, so... But I'm working on trying to stay positive, trying to stay happy...

266
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:34,270
[SPEAKER_19]: Trying to, you know, not erupt into random bouts of bitchiness over things beyond my control.

267
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a song to dedicate to you, Jamie.

268
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:36,771
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

269
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:38,071
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

270
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:43,693
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

271
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's no more drama.

272
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:47,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Haven't you heard this song?

273
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,255
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's from one of those stupid soap operas.

274
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it actually raps on the samples.

275
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:54,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, hold on.

276
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it kick in here.

277
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,554
[SPEAKER_19]: That is desperation, okay?

278
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,976
[SPEAKER_19]: That's almost as bad as when the Sujis ripped that Enya song.

279
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:05,096
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay?

280
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:08,999
[SPEAKER_19]: That's really, really bad.

281
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:10,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Really bad.

282
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,941
[SPEAKER_05]: This definitely should be in a DDR.

283
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:15,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people that could use... Yeah, that actually would be pretty good.

284
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:16,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people that could use that song.

285
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:22,206
[SPEAKER_19]: But, um... Yeah, I don't think that...

286
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,310
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think that there's anything really all that major that happened in my week.

287
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,731
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing of notable circumstance.

288
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't you boring?

289
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:33,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

290
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:35,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, bite me.

291
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:37,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing you.

292
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,456
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, boring.

293
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,699
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a curse that says, may you live in interesting times.

294
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:46,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

295
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,695
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also another one that says, May the fleas of a thousand camels rest in your genitals, but I won't go into that one.

296
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,298
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to pass on the mic.

297
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:55,279
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, moving on.

298
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk to DDR Angel and see how her week and her day was.

299
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:00,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel?

300
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:01,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

301
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:03,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, geez.

302
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:03,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, here, hold on.

303
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Jamie wants to say one more thing.

304
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:06,534
[SPEAKER_19]: I broke Dan's main cabinet.

305
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:07,694
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd you break it?

306
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:12,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I pulled the joystick thing loose from the thing with my... You pulled the thing from the thing?

307
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:20,359
[SPEAKER_19]: The joystick mechanism, I pulled it... It's attached underneath the panel, and I pulled it loose, so it sunk into the panel.

308
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:20,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

309
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,402
[SPEAKER_19]: Because his machine could not withstand my mad Street Fighter Alpha 2 prowess.

310
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:26,882
[SPEAKER_18]: I see.

311
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, hi!

312
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:31,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Angel!

313
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:31,727
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your week?

314
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:32,127
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

315
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:32,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, pretty good.

316
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:35,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, just been working and stuff.

317
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I signed up for classes yesterday, so... Yay!

318
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:46,037
[SPEAKER_17]: So, oh my god, we're all gonna meet in the cafeteria and be like... Lunchtime high school crap.

319
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:46,958
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Heather's.

320
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:48,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I guess so.

321
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:48,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Here, wait.

322
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Let the ferret talk for a second.

323
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:53,763
[SPEAKER_17]: See?

324
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:54,463
[SPEAKER_17]: He likes it too.

325
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:56,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

326
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:56,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

327
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want to set the ferrets on fire.

328
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:00,096
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

329
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:01,477
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

330
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:02,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

331
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:04,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for Halloween.

332
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:07,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Just work and going to be school soon.

333
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,800
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

334
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,761
[SPEAKER_17]: My life's pretty boring now that I'm up here.

335
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:13,161
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's okay, I guess.

336
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:16,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

337
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:23,166
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

338
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:24,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, moving on then.

339
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:26,554
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a nice space, Dead Air, thank you.

340
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:29,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian42, how was your week, how was your day?

341
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:43,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, uh, a week has been work, and, and, apartment, uh, work, I've been at this place for about three months, and now they offer me that, uh, that I can be their actual employee instead of a temp.

342
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:44,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm probably gonna take it.

343
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:46,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Right on.

344
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,159
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be good.

345
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:49,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is nice.

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, in a few months I get more money, so.

347
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:54,744
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be good.

348
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:58,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And not sitting at home all day every day like I usually do.

349
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:03,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go out to the stores and not play anything else.

350
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:06,309
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played any Mimani in like a long time.

351
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:12,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And because data entry all day doesn't really mesh very well with Beatmania.

352
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:18,434
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the only thing I have at home that I can play anymore because I sold everything else.

353
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:20,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and that's about all.

354
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:22,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Today I just sat around

355
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:24,536
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't do anything.

356
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:26,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Just played Final Fantasy.

357
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:26,377
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh...

358
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:53,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I was working on my cabinet because I got the new thing to fix it so there's no lag.

359
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,816
[SPEAKER_09]: But that didn't work too well, so I need to rewire the whole damn thing.

360
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:00,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Which will, in the end, be better anyways.

361
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:03,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's a real mess as far as wires go.

362
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:09,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And, I don't know, just sitting there at work and reading the internet.

363
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,880
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much all I do.

364
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:14,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing interesting, I'm afraid.

365
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:16,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, that would suck.

366
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:19,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so what's up?

367
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:24,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, am I the only one that actually tried to go play some DDR this week?

368
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is... I played Step Mania.

369
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:29,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Step Mania counts.

370
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:30,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Step Mania is not DDR!

371
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:32,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not DDR!

372
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,711
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's a message to everybody.

373
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:35,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Step Mania is not DDR.

374
00:23:35,512 --> 00:23:37,853
[SPEAKER_05]: If you AAA something in Step Mania, it doesn't mean shit.

375
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:39,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

376
00:23:39,414 --> 00:23:39,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

377
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:41,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does it mean shit?

378
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:43,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I said so.

379
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:44,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not the same thing.

380
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Using your fingers and using your feet are two different things.

381
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:47,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're playing on a pad.

382
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,042
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're playing on a pad, it still doesn't count because Stepmania is not DDR and it's different timing.

383
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,924
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually make the timing exact.

384
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what do you have to say about that?

385
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a load of crap.

386
00:23:58,726 --> 00:23:59,226
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still not DDR.

387
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:00,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can bite me.

388
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:00,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So how was your week?

389
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:01,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my week?

390
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:07,792
[SPEAKER_05]: My week, I spent making fun of Stepmania people who say it's DDR.

391
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:07,932
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

392
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:08,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, continuation.

393
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:21,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to mention, because I'm sure Rob wanted to talk about this anyways, the other thing I was doing this week is researching interdimensional communication.

394
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, I'm going to build a device.

395
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:29,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me say that again for those that didn't catch it.

396
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:33,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki is studying interdimensional communication.

397
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:35,958
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's going to build a device.

398
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:36,859
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of device?

399
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:38,121
[SPEAKER_17]: He's zipping in a portal to hell.

400
00:24:39,402 --> 00:24:42,025
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a... No, it's not a portal to hell!

401
00:24:42,485 --> 00:24:44,147
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same thing I said.

402
00:24:44,688 --> 00:24:48,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I said he's building a vortex to hell is what he's making right now.

403
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:52,835
[SPEAKER_09]: This show is a vortex to hell.

404
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:58,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I am basically recreating an experiment done by some guy who is now dead.

405
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know why.

406
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:02,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, anyways.

407
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:08,127
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically called a germanium communicator.

408
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:14,452
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why it's called a germanium communicator is because isn't a germanium what you keep gerbils in?

409
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:15,293
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a plant.

410
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,875
[SPEAKER_18]: You're trying to talk to plants.

411
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,227
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm not.

412
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:21,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Not Geranium.

413
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:22,808
[SPEAKER_09]: People at my work do that.

414
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:23,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Germanium.

415
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Like German with an I-U-M.

416
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't that an element?

417
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:31,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, that's what it is.

418
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:32,398
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an element.

419
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:36,042
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like one of the... Number 37 on the periodical chart.

420
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:40,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the same compounds as silicon almost.

421
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:42,797
[SPEAKER_19]: You can make boobs out of it.

422
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Silicon, not silicone.

423
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:46,279
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

424
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Adding letters to my stuff.

425
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:49,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

426
00:25:50,062 --> 00:26:00,429
[SPEAKER_09]: No, so I'm gonna buy... I'm buying an ingo of this stuff off the internet since they don't really, you know, sell... Which you can make by synthesizing four of the ore plus a fire crystal, just for the record.

427
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,772
[SPEAKER_09]: And you say, I'm a Final Fantasy addict.

428
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:04,252
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

429
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,374
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm buying an ingo of this stuff.

430
00:26:07,394 --> 00:26:08,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically what it does...

431
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

432
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:10,825
[SPEAKER_09]: See you next time.

433
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:31,650
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't see why it wouldn't work now.

434
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:35,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I know everyone thinks I'm crazy, but I'm gonna laugh at you when it works.

435
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:36,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna laugh at you.

436
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:37,794
[SPEAKER_18]: How do you know if they're dead?

437
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:39,235
[SPEAKER_18]: What if they're really demons?

438
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:40,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the thing.

439
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,919
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you're picking up, like, a baby monitor upstairs or something?

440
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear something noise.

441
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:53,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's funny you should mention that, because this in no way can pick up radio waves or, you know, any sort of broadcast of that form.

442
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:57,328
[SPEAKER_09]: It only picks up, um, I think magnetic frequencies, so...

443
00:26:58,823 --> 00:27:00,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, it doesn't work that way.

444
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:02,344
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't tune radio with this.

445
00:27:02,444 --> 00:27:04,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have Final Fantasy XI in hell?

446
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:07,185
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's hell.

447
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:07,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course we have it.

448
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:11,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I will post in the chat room the website that I'm going to.

449
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:15,346
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually have recordings of this that's been done a while back.

450
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:24,468
[SPEAKER_09]: And funny enough, the guy that was basically doing this, who also won a Nobel Prize and has a PhD in experimental sciences... All things that you don't have.

451
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:26,088
[SPEAKER_09]: All things that I don't have.

452
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:28,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't fucking care, okay?

453
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:39,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what I don't have, I'm going to make better because his device only had, you know, a small little piece that was a two millimeter by three and a half millimeter piece of germanium.

454
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:42,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm using an inch by an inch piece of germanium.

455
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,221
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 25 times the size.

456
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just multiplying everything by 25.

457
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:48,605
[SPEAKER_19]: So are you an advocate that bigger is better?

458
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:52,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Notice how Loki has taken what you do for cookies.

459
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:56,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you have too much cookie dough, you just double the recipe for everything, right?

460
00:27:56,815 --> 00:28:02,718
[SPEAKER_05]: He's taken that and now he's going to multiply everything on this talking to the dead communicator by 25.

461
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,480
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to build a vortex to hell, I'm telling you.

462
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:18,104
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically he's applying the math behind cookie dough to metaphysical communication.

463
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:18,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

464
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:26,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what I suggested over dinner when Loki was telling us the first time is that we could take this device to Golf Land and really mess with people.

465
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:34,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I think we should hook it up so that it's in that area between the pad and the screen so when little kids run in front of it, they get sucked into hell.

466
00:28:36,836 --> 00:28:42,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, first off, like I said before, it's not a fucking vortex to hell.

467
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,600
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another device to which I do not have the schematics for.

468
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:48,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you build one of those?

469
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:51,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I really want to get rid of some of those people at Golfline.

470
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,191
[SPEAKER_19]: Didn't you ever see the gate?

471
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:55,273
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to dig a hole in your backyard.

472
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, listen now.

473
00:28:56,994 --> 00:29:00,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, seriously, I am interested in this stuff.

474
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:06,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's a phase or something, but I am so fucking bored at work, I have nothing to do.

475
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what they're forcing me to do.

476
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,981
[SPEAKER_19]: So first it's cursed dolls.

477
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:12,622
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it's communicating with the dead.

478
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:13,823
[SPEAKER_19]: You can touch your dolly.

479
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:21,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, that's what this is all about, is that Loki needs to talk to his dolls.

480
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're a genius, Jamie.

481
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:28,898
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, I don't have any haunted dolls, because I forgot to bid on the goddamn thing in the beginning.

482
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:37,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And second of all... Second of all, okay, this doesn't have anything to do with fucking talking to dolls, okay?

483
00:29:39,008 --> 00:29:39,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit.

484
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:43,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't you want to talk to the demon or dead thing that possessed the doll?

485
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:45,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm loving this chatroom feedback we have here.

486
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there already was a vortex to hell.

487
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Roseville Golf Land.

488
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:52,409
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Bomani.

489
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:54,271
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where Bomani machines go to die.

490
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Scandia is where Bomani goes to die.

491
00:29:57,215 --> 00:29:59,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Scandia is where Bomani goes to die again.

492
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:00,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, re-death.

493
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, listen now.

494
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:02,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

495
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:09,929
[SPEAKER_09]: This basically, all this is right here, it's another form of EVP, as I was talking before, which is, you know, electronic voice phenomenon.

496
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:12,092
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, what happens is you can record...

497
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:14,822
[SPEAKER_09]: You record voices that you don't hear.

498
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:20,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're done through manipulation of the diaphragm and a microphone.

499
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:25,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you can record things that normal humans can't hear.

500
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,607
[SPEAKER_09]: They do this all the fucking time.

501
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,508
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

502
00:30:52,294 --> 00:30:53,635
[SPEAKER_09]: and don't even yet, okay?

503
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:56,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody can do this with a tape recorder.

504
00:30:56,557 --> 00:31:05,464
[SPEAKER_09]: They can do this, and you can actually wire something up very simple with a germanium diode that they supposedly sell at Radio Shack, but I sure as hell could find it today.

505
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:14,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, you can do that, and it'll actually only record just, you know, what you can't hear, and it'll block everything else out.

506
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:18,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's very interesting hearing people do that, and you get some really creepy shit on there.

507
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:22,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Butcher, mock me as you will.

508
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:24,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I will fucking send the vortex after you.

509
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of mocking Loki, we have a comment from the chatroom.

510
00:31:27,862 --> 00:31:28,843
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the best comment ever.

511
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:31,647
[SPEAKER_05]: UnknownGamer says, Loki does want to talk to his dolls.

512
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:36,012
[SPEAKER_05]: He wants to talk to his Final Fantasy figurines and see if Tifa and Yuna love him.

513
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even have dolls.

514
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:40,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's stupid.

515
00:31:40,784 --> 00:31:44,066
[SPEAKER_19]: He wants to talk to his chocobo to see if his chocobo goes work at him.

516
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:44,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I make a joke?

517
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I make a joke?

518
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:47,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

519
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:52,772
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're able to build this machine and talk to the dead, will you be able to communicate with Miss Cleo's career?

520
00:31:56,635 --> 00:31:57,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

521
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:00,117
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

522
00:32:00,978 --> 00:32:01,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough of this.

523
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:05,668
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just reminded of that scene from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.

524
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:06,869
[SPEAKER_09]: To hell with all you people.

525
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:07,750
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, don't say that!

526
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:10,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say that, Loki, because you will do it.

527
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you will with this machine.

528
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:15,775
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but like that scene when they're having the seance.

529
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:19,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, Rob, how many things have I built that have actually worked?

530
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,039
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good point.

531
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,624
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, in defense of Loki's little idea, I'm supporting it.

532
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,045
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm curious...

533
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:32,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this what we're calling it now?

534
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:34,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's officially the little idea?

535
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Your little idea.

536
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

537
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:41,068
[SPEAKER_19]: I will support this.

538
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,789
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm interested to see how it turns out.

539
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:50,755
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm also wondering, though, what you would use to record visual data.

540
00:32:51,204 --> 00:32:52,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, they have that.

541
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:53,245
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?

542
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:54,026
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been done.

543
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:56,307
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really strange how it works, too.

544
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:59,069
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically everything revolves around white noise.

545
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:17,581
[SPEAKER_09]: In this case, what they use, a common way they use to record it, they have some other complicated devices, but the easiest way you can do it now is you take a video camera and you record, you basically put the output onto a TV, then you record that, and it creates interference because it's recording the same fucking thing over and over.

546
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:22,805
[SPEAKER_09]: But in that, when you record that, you go back frame by frame and you'll actually see shit on there.

547
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:25,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have pictures of it that have been done.

548
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:26,368
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very interesting.

549
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:37,196
[SPEAKER_09]: But the guy that did the experiments, he actually had his own device because this is like way back in the day when TVs and shit were fucking expensive and computers were the size of football fields and whatnot.

550
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:38,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

551
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:42,956
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to have to take a bazillion magnets and put them in a room to make a kilobyte.

552
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:53,402
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, this is something he made a while back, and supposedly what happened was later on people recreated this experiment in the 90s.

553
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:57,404
[SPEAKER_09]: The most recent I've heard of this experiment being recreated was in 2003.

554
00:33:58,184 --> 00:33:58,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know.

555
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:07,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess for some reason, for a few years they had no results recreating the same thing, because there's a lot of other factors that they can't figure in, that they don't know what the hell...

556
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:10,094
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, why it doesn't work or why it works.

557
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:11,274
[SPEAKER_18]: It goes to camera shy?

558
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:12,795
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not camera shy.

559
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:14,295
[SPEAKER_09]: It's complicated.

560
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:15,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'll give you guys the websites.

561
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:16,656
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go look at it.

562
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:18,096
[SPEAKER_09]: You can think I'm crazy.

563
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:18,717
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

564
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:20,397
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is what I'm reading up on.

565
00:34:20,637 --> 00:34:24,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And, I mean, I'm not a real believer in the paranormal and whatnot.

566
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,619
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm a believer in science.

567
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:29,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, they have scientific proof to prove this.

568
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,681
[SPEAKER_09]: They just can't explain it.

569
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,222
[SPEAKER_09]: It's obviously beyond our knowledge now.

570
00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:34,062
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

571
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:36,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it just sounds interesting.

572
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:40,317
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's so easy to recreate the experiment, then why not?

573
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,360
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I'm crazy.

574
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,341
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing is, though, there's another guy.

575
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:57,426
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another guy that created a thing called Luminator, which is basically... It's some sort of device that... It uses fans or something, and it blows water through rings of water.

576
00:34:57,786 --> 00:34:59,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Or air through rings of water.

577
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:07,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how the fuck that happens, but... Anyway, supposedly that creates a weird field or something, and if you photograph someone with that field, you'll actually see...

578
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:10,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Like someone else's face on theirs.

579
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:10,994
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of weird.

580
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:20,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the guy supposedly put three of these in like a triangle configuration and that created the vortex, you know, that you were also talking about.

581
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:22,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And he saw the Triforce.

582
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:22,326
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

583
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:29,074
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I was going to ask something about the... I lost my train of thought because I made the Triforce joke.

584
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:30,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind, keep talking.

585
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:33,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I will post the links in the chat room.

586
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:36,637
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's some interesting stuff.

587
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:42,143
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole bunch of stuff on EVPs that you can listen to that are really creepy sounding stuff.

588
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:45,126
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a lot of documentation on this.

589
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:47,127
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of people recreating it the same way.

590
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,791
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, you're getting a lot of people that are getting these results.

591
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, scientifically, you can prove it.

592
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it like the dead boy in Three Men and a Baby?

593
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:57,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what?

594
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:05,920
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I was thinking is that you should take this whole little idea of yours and you should film it all and put it on like public access TV.

595
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,240
[SPEAKER_05]: You could be the new Mr. Wizard.

596
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be cool?

597
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:11,142
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

598
00:36:13,322 --> 00:36:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but, um, you know...

599
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:41,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, their results were just kind of like weird because one thing that they were saying that's important about this is resonance and anyone that doesn't know what resonance means that's just like, for example, resonance on a radio would be tuning in because you have all the frequencies out there and each station has its own frequency so you tune it to whatever station and then you're in resonance with that station and you basically get audio that way.

00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the thing with this is you have to be resonance with

601
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:56,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Your thoughts or basically your aura or whatever, and that's the thing that's difficult because it's not only you, it's the people around you, and those all affect your environment plus other factors.

602
00:36:57,713 --> 00:37:01,654
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a lot of complex shit there, but I don't know.

603
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:06,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to do it until I get bored with it, and then I'll work on my cabinet some more.

604
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:08,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ready to talk about my week and my day now.

605
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:09,396
[SPEAKER_19]: You got my joke.

606
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:10,276
[SPEAKER_05]: What joke?

607
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,477
[SPEAKER_19]: Didn't you ever see the thing about three men and a baby?

608
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:14,758
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

609
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:15,278
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki?

610
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:36,603
[SPEAKER_19]: about the one scene where they're walking in front of a window and there's a little boy standing behind this curtain and he was supposed to have been like some ghost who imprinted himself on the film he like blew his head off with a shotgun or something and then they walk by again I've seen it, the shotgun's there you're crazy talking

611
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,342
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

612
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:51,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, now you got Loki on another thing.

613
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:54,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's going to start inserting ghosts into movies.

614
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,614
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, no, seriously, because he's like, and you can fully see him there.

615
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:09,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wouldn't just say this if I had, I mean, I'm sure that the logical thing is that it's some prop or something, but the other is that, see?

616
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:13,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

617
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:14,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Didn't I tell you?

618
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:17,047
[SPEAKER_19]: It shows up several times.

619
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you post that link in our chat room for those that want to check that out?

620
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:20,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

621
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:21,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

622
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Your week, Rob.

623
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, my week.

624
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually went out and played DDR this week, one night.

625
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:26,917
[SPEAKER_19]: Holy shit, you did?

626
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:30,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Roseville Golf Land, because my friend had never seen DDR before.

627
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:35,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, actually, he'd seen DDR, but he wanted to see me play DDR, because he hadn't seen, like, Extreme.

628
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:38,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went, and I played, and I felt really stupid.

629
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:45,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know how you guys feel about playing DDR for your friends for the first time, when you're, like, pretty good at DDR, like...

630
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:50,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I can play at a maniac level like I'm sure a lot of people listening to this show can.

631
00:38:51,842 --> 00:38:55,745
[SPEAKER_05]: And to those that don't really see DDR a whole lot, I think it really weirds them out sometimes.

632
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:56,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

633
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:57,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's just me.

634
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:00,929
[SPEAKER_05]: But he seemed to get a kick out of that.

635
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:05,612
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing was that the up arrow on Extreme was broken, so like half my notes weren't registering.

636
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:10,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went to try and play Guitar Freaks, and frickin' that machine was suckin' too, so...

637
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:13,018
[SPEAKER_05]: The hell with that place.

638
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Machines go to die.

639
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,061
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did at least go out to play DDR this week.

640
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:19,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to try and play at home, but my stupid ignition pad's broken.

641
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:24,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So either I'm going to have to buy a new ignition pad, or Loki's going to have to finish his DDR pads.

642
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:28,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But since he's too busy building vortexes to hell, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.

643
00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:30,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to work on that, and that's why I'm rewiring everything.

644
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:31,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, alright.

645
00:39:33,012 --> 00:39:33,393
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

646
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:36,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway...

647
00:39:36,952 --> 00:39:40,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's pretty... I don't really have a whole lot to say about my week and my day.

648
00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:42,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't that exciting.

649
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:45,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a fine weekend.

650
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to a little gathering last night and that was cool, I guess.

651
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:52,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two days ago... What did I do Friday night?

652
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:57,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I went out to a party with some friends and then went to a bar.

653
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that exciting?

654
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:00,181
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

655
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:01,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Excitement is now.

656
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:04,783
[SPEAKER_05]: They have pinball machines at this bar now, though.

657
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:05,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Which ones?

658
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:06,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

659
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:15,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Monopoly, and the one with the aliens in the hologram, Revenge of Mars.

660
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:19,639
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just kind of funny to see those at a gay bar.

661
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,622
[SPEAKER_19]: If anybody in town happens to find a Black Knight 2000 pinball, tell me.

662
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:31,364
[SPEAKER_19]: Because Black Knight 2000 pinball is the most awesome pinball ever.

663
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll have one at the Classic Gaming Expo, which you know we're going to be making an appearance at.

664
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:35,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

665
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:36,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Classic Gaming Expo!

666
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

667
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Konami's supposed to be doing something there.

668
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:41,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Konami is doing something there.

669
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:44,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our buddies at KDA are actually working the booth there.

670
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:47,128
[SPEAKER_18]: They're working a booth.

671
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of know what's going on, but I think it's supposed to be a secret, so I can't repeat it.

672
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:52,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a secret to everyone.

673
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:54,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Bimani related, but it's very cool nonetheless.

674
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:55,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Unless we play track and field.

675
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:58,477
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be cool.

676
00:40:58,697 --> 00:40:59,378
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

677
00:40:59,538 --> 00:40:59,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

678
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:03,050
[SPEAKER_05]: But I definitely want to go.

679
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be making an appearance there next weekend.

680
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:09,455
[SPEAKER_05]: It may affect next week's show, actually, but we're not sure yet.

681
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:10,957
[SPEAKER_05]: We think we might still have a show next weekend.

682
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:13,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But Jamie's still going to be there.

683
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:24,750
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm actually going to be there partly for the show and partly with my fiancé.

684
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

685
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:32,128
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to pre-tape a show if we decide to be at Classic Gaming Expo all next week.

686
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll figure something out.

687
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:33,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

688
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we do now is we're going to go to break.

689
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we come back, we'll actually talk about some Bomani stuff.

690
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:44,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's been lots of Ultramix 2 news and DDR Extreme news this week.

691
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:50,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of DDR Extreme, I think in this break we're going to play some music from DDR Extreme, including... Why not?

692
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:51,797
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do Your Rain the Rage Mix again.

693
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:53,026
[SPEAKER_18]: You touched my body once, it burned

694
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:10,704
Thanks for watching!

695
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:44,818
What you see is me, baby

696
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:52,292
All my brothers and sisters, all in all, over 10 billion listeners, many a year, we do want to hear the hypest and ripest sound of the year.

697
00:44:52,312 --> 00:44:54,354
Up and kiss the butt of the agent, up, up, up.

698
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:42,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay y'all, this is it, I fucked it, it's a life we'll see soon as I touch it Through this smooth and easy life, so we might get hyped in here tonight Be nice, be light, MC for the back, if you ain't with that, I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap That can smash this mouth up, if they jack, we don't start no crap Giving a little bit of heart and soul, as we do it, so you in your ear holes

699
00:45:48,907 --> 00:45:49,811
Thank you for watching!

700
00:46:26,926 --> 00:46:30,128
[SPEAKER_05]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

701
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:32,610
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

702
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

703
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

704
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

705
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, mostly crap-free, except for this show, of course.

706
00:46:40,535 --> 00:46:45,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You are tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, and we're here with episode number 107.

707
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:50,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to take a little break there talking about some new songs that are going to be in DDR Extreme.

708
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, not all new.

709
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:57,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Your Rain was new, but we have some old classics there, Never Ending Story and Wonderland.

710
00:46:57,753 --> 00:47:03,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed this kind of seems to be happening quite a bit where they're getting a lot of old songs and putting them in these new DDR games we have coming out.

711
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:06,178
[SPEAKER_05]: What else did we have in Extreme that was going to be in there?

712
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:14,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Only You, There You'll Be, Kick the Can, Don't Clock Me from Solo, like all these old-ass songs.

713
00:47:14,963 --> 00:47:15,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of cool, though.

714
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:21,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Sugaru, that's kind of old now, I don't know, .59.

715
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:32,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we are here on Orange Orange Radio and kind of talking about some news that happened last week.

716
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:34,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to talk about some things that happened while we were here.

717
00:47:36,684 --> 00:47:37,545
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

718
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:05,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's got all these different songs in there, a new DJ Simon song, Back to the Dance Floor, new Orange Lounge songs in it, new Naoki song, and all this stuff in 2DX Red.

719
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:11,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And supposedly there's this really, really hard song that's in it, that has this really hard note pattern.

720
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:17,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, one of my buddies was kind enough to send me a video of it, so I'll show you guys kind of what this looks like.

721
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:18,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's playing it on random.

722
00:48:18,712 --> 00:48:23,074
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

723
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:48,146
[SPEAKER_19]: I will, I guess, read just your eyesight or something, the way you can read it easier.

724
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:50,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me show you what the end of the song looks like here.

725
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:53,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that part doesn't look so hard, but kinda, there you go.

726
00:48:55,147 --> 00:48:56,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Kinda crazy song in the end there.

727
00:49:01,168 --> 00:49:01,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the video.

728
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:06,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like they've made the interface a lot prettier.

729
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:12,411
[SPEAKER_05]: That they have the, um, barred... They, they, basically what they did in 2DX Red, I noticed, is that they took...

730
00:49:13,386 --> 00:49:25,109
[SPEAKER_05]: One half of the screen, you remember when you would play 2DX, the side, if you were just in one player mode, the other half of the screen would have nothing, like it would just be a blank place for notes to fall.

731
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what they've done is they've kind of done the keyboard mania thing.

732
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:37,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how many of you guys have played keyboard mania, but keyboard mania had two monitors, and if you were playing it just in one player mode, it would show you like a little bar on the other side that would show you like how you were doing with your combo and stuff.

733
00:49:38,072 --> 00:49:46,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not quite that what they're doing in 2DX Red, but they've taken it, and now it's showing a graph of your score compared to the top score on the machine.

734
00:49:46,764 --> 00:49:52,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought that was kind of cool, is that you'd have a little bar that would go up as you did really good or really crappy on the song.

735
00:49:52,732 --> 00:49:54,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I thought that was kind of neat.

736
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:57,890
[SPEAKER_05]: FoonMix

737
00:50:22,782 --> 00:50:23,543
[SPEAKER_05]: FoodMix Plus.

738
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,084
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a FoodMix Plus release last week.

739
00:50:26,245 --> 00:50:27,386
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fucking awesome.

740
00:50:27,426 --> 00:50:28,627
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I have to say.

741
00:50:29,007 --> 00:50:37,834
[SPEAKER_09]: There was about 15 new songs that they added, brand new interface, brand new non-stop ONI courses, and it's beautiful.

742
00:50:38,414 --> 00:50:44,219
[SPEAKER_09]: They made what FoodMix was before, which was really awesome and made it even better.

743
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,301
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just really kick-ass.

744
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:50,304
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I hear, though, the double steps leave a little bit to be desired, but

745
00:50:51,331 --> 00:50:54,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Their single sets are awesome because I haven't gotten to play doubles yet.

746
00:50:54,572 --> 00:50:57,572
[SPEAKER_09]: But really beautiful, awesome brand new videos.

747
00:50:58,072 --> 00:50:59,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Just really awesome.

748
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:02,613
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got a lot of nifty stuff that you can do now in Step Mania.

749
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:09,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, for instance, the results screen has a type of graph that you would see in Beat Mania where it shows you how you did and everything.

750
00:51:10,215 --> 00:51:11,575
[SPEAKER_09]: And your combo and all that.

751
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:15,376
[SPEAKER_09]: And just some really cool stuff that they did with the background.

752
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:17,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Just really pushing Step Mania to its limits.

753
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:31,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed something interesting they did with the movies, is that they put a watermark of the song name in there, like at least that one for Made and Innocent that had the anime girl in it and stuff, they kind of put a watermark on the movie.

754
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:35,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there an issue where some of their movies were being pirated on other step files or something?

755
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:37,643
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was just a little cool thing in the bottom.

756
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,124
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all.

757
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:40,466
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just for the one song, it just...

758
00:51:41,098 --> 00:52:09,394
[SPEAKER_09]: look cool but it was just they actually what I like about them is they use video and still images just like you would in BMS files because I mean these guys are coming from BMS files and just the animations that they do in that are just awesome I really wish a lot of the US people would go and start doing BMS sim files first and then going to DWIs but it's just amazing the amount of work that they put in these

759
00:52:12,486 --> 00:52:21,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought maybe all of their movies had the little watermark in the corner because their movies are so kick-ass.

760
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:25,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be surprised if people were stealing them and putting them on their own step files and stuff.

761
00:52:26,374 --> 00:52:27,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of ties it to that one song.

762
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:29,656
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was just the Made in Innocence that had that?

763
00:52:29,716 --> 00:52:30,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I saw it on another one.

764
00:52:31,992 --> 00:52:32,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so I'm on crack.

765
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:33,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

766
00:52:33,574 --> 00:52:38,218
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few of them that say Foon Mix Plus in them, but that's about... I mean, so what?

767
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:38,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

768
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:39,639
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just awesome.

769
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,221
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much it.

770
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:43,483
[SPEAKER_09]: They just have really awesome stuff.

771
00:52:43,503 --> 00:52:49,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said before, a lot of the music that's actually featured on there is going to be on Diverse 7, which you can find.

772
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:54,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And that comes in three different varieties, which I could talk about now or later, either way.

773
00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:54,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, why?

774
00:52:55,374 --> 00:52:55,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

775
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:19,093
[SPEAKER_09]: is that they either have three CDs, and I think two of them are BMS files, which are basically your Beatmania sim files, and they're really awesome.

776
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:22,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, for instance, we'll go down with 5Key and what they have on there.

777
00:53:23,314 --> 00:53:30,797
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a remix of Superhighway called Superhighway the Cafe Electromix by a guy named Oni, or Only, I should say.

778
00:53:32,118 --> 00:53:36,299
[SPEAKER_09]: A remix of What's Next with the song title What?

779
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:38,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep On Movin' Romantic Blue Style T.O.

780
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Na Remix of Area Code

781
00:53:53,372 --> 00:54:01,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Ska, The Good Mix, Ninja Blast, Hayabusa Mix, Acid Bomb, The Overdosing Remix, Slash Trax,

782
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:17,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Recycle, a remix of Cycle by Spelunker, which is awesome.

783
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:19,001
[SPEAKER_09]: He's done some really good stuff.

784
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:24,485
[SPEAKER_09]: SDZ, which is The Gleam, which is a remix of SDZ.

785
00:54:24,545 --> 00:54:26,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not familiar with that one.

786
00:54:26,707 --> 00:54:26,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

787
00:54:28,628 --> 00:54:29,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, I'm going to fuck this up.

788
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:33,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Notch Music, which is You Gotta Groove remix.

789
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's, of course, a remix of You Gotta Groove.

790
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:41,474
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Seven Keys, some of the other ones that they have on here.

791
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:42,935
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a remix of Murmur Twins.

792
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:46,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh hey, we've got some demo MP3s here.

793
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:48,718
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll get those later.

794
00:54:48,758 --> 00:54:50,719
[SPEAKER_09]: We can play them maybe during a break or something.

795
00:54:50,759 --> 00:54:54,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, Murmur Twins, the 4-6-0 beat mix.

796
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:56,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Reality, the Alpha 0.2 mix.

797
00:54:58,371 --> 00:55:00,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other song in Japanese.

798
00:55:00,652 --> 00:55:03,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Boy Bass, the Switchback to 93 remix.

799
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:09,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Maiden Innocent, which is featured in Spoon Mix Plus.

800
00:55:09,696 --> 00:55:12,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope that Bad Boy Bass remix has that sample still in it.

801
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:13,698
[SPEAKER_18]: One more time with the Bad Boy Bass!

802
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:15,099
[SPEAKER_18]: One more time with the Bad Boy Bass!

803
00:55:16,332 --> 00:55:20,175
[SPEAKER_09]: YSQ, Number 12.8, Holix, Loveheart Sign, X2, and Small Voyager

804
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:40,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they have one last one, which is other mixes.

805
00:55:40,907 --> 00:55:49,169
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's Time Piece Phase 2, High Transparency Mix, which is One Phase Blues, I think, remix.

806
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:52,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Healing Vision remix, which is just that.

807
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the Drive.

808
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Mirrorball Satellite 2004, which is in the original Foon mix.

809
00:55:57,731 --> 00:55:59,732
[SPEAKER_19]: That sounds awesome, because that's an inflow song.

810
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it was pretty good.

811
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:04,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there's a few other ones I'll see here.

812
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:08,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Yama Da Jet, Coaster Girl, which is a Yama Jet remix.

813
00:56:08,747 --> 00:56:09,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of funny.

814
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:15,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Implantation, DV Mix, Lamb of God, Trip Machine, Dark Core Mix, and some other ones.

815
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:21,814
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to get some of these demo MP3s and maybe play them on a break or something.

816
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:25,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're usually about 30 seconds long, so we'll get a bunch of different songs there.

817
00:56:26,556 --> 00:56:27,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, that sounds like fun.

818
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:27,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

819
00:56:27,957 --> 00:56:29,638
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll do that.

820
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:41,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to change gears here because I want to talk about Ultramix 2 because the Ultramix 2 news has been flying really fast this week.

821
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:47,009
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of new stuff announced for Ultramix 2 within this week and last week, and that's including some songs.

822
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:52,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Some new songs have been announced for these games, so I want to see if we can address what some of those songs are.

823
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:53,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

824
00:56:54,858 --> 00:57:09,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things that have been figured out is that we got some early songs that have been announced for Ultramix 2, including 321 Stars by DJ Simon, A by DJ Amuro, and B4U by Naoki, which were all, if I remember right, in the E3 demo, so none of that's a surprise.

825
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:15,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But get this, here's your first licensed song from Ultramix 2, Brick House by The Commodores.

826
00:57:16,669 --> 00:57:17,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that crazy?

827
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,031
[SPEAKER_19]: That's kind of, is it like a remix of it?

828
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:21,752
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's the original, she's on brick.

829
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:26,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Moonlight Shadow by Missing Heart from Fifth Mix

830
00:57:48,223 --> 00:57:49,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Very popular licensed track.

831
00:57:49,304 --> 00:57:49,965
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me happy.

832
00:57:49,985 --> 00:57:51,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very popular licensed track.

833
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:54,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting a lot of people really geared up for Ultramix, too.

834
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:55,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Very happy about that.

835
00:57:55,969 --> 00:58:00,873
[SPEAKER_05]: My Summer Love, Night in Motion, which was actually a licensed track.

836
00:58:01,073 --> 00:58:02,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Night in Motion, cool.

837
00:58:02,515 --> 00:58:08,099
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people think that that is a Konami original, but it was actually a licensed track from DDR4thMix.

838
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:13,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And you would know this song, definitely, because it has that really catchy hook at the beginning of it.

839
00:58:13,363 --> 00:58:14,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a little bit of it.

840
00:58:14,484 --> 00:58:14,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, let me...

841
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get a little bit of the hook here.

842
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:32,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows that song.

843
00:58:32,198 --> 00:58:34,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so that one's going to be in a DDR Ultra Mix.

844
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on the Light by Mr. T. Now, wait a minute.

845
00:58:39,602 --> 00:58:42,684
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a 2DX song that's being ported over for DDR.

846
00:58:42,804 --> 00:58:43,164
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

847
00:58:43,763 --> 00:58:46,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is something brand new that we've never had in DDR before.

848
00:58:47,185 --> 00:58:48,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't stop there.

849
00:58:49,266 --> 00:58:51,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Route 80s by Sampling Masters Mega.

850
00:58:51,687 --> 00:58:52,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

851
00:58:52,427 --> 00:58:53,408
[SPEAKER_05]: From DDR.

852
00:58:53,528 --> 00:58:54,449
[SPEAKER_18]: Attention.

853
00:58:54,529 --> 00:58:55,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Attention.

854
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:57,150
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually going to play some of these songs.

855
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,130
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you that haven't heard them.

856
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Do that for the next break.

857
00:58:59,191 --> 00:59:00,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll do that in the next break.

858
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:01,932
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play some of these songs for those that haven't heard them before.

859
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:05,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Mine by Ryu from 2DX4 style.

860
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:06,435
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember that?

861
00:59:06,475 --> 00:59:07,695
[SPEAKER_05]: With Tran with a little fan.

862
00:59:09,176 --> 00:59:09,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Mine will be fun.

863
00:59:10,317 --> 00:59:11,677
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be very fun on DDR.

864
00:59:16,043 --> 00:59:44,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Act 6 to do stuff well this is the interesting thing is that they have said they have said in the thread that different people are doing the steps than did them for Ultramix 1 so you're not going to see steps like you saw in Ultramix 1 and supposedly they have people that know their stuff on DDR that are making these steps so so it's not Konami of Hawaii well they didn't really I don't think they really said one way or the other I haven't been keeping tabs on the information thread um

865
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:49,348
[SPEAKER_05]: and also I don't want to cross the line from what I've been told.

866
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:53,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what I can say and what I can't.

867
00:59:53,311 --> 00:59:56,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to move on to the next song, which is from 2DX.

868
00:59:57,374 --> 00:59:59,595
[SPEAKER_05]: VJ Army by Good Cool.

869
00:59:59,635 --> 01:00:00,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that's cool.

870
01:00:00,415 --> 01:00:01,396
[SPEAKER_19]: VJ Army will be fun.

871
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:02,437
[SPEAKER_05]: VJ Army is going to be fun.

872
01:00:02,457 --> 01:00:04,978
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people have said that should be in DDR for a long time.

873
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:07,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's very cool that that one's going to make it in there.

874
01:00:08,744 --> 01:00:14,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's okay if you've never played 2DX and you've never heard these songs before, we're going to play them for you in the next break.

875
01:00:14,488 --> 01:00:16,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can get a feel of what you're going to be dancing to pretty soon.

876
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Goddammit, does that mean I have to buy an Xbox?

877
01:00:20,251 --> 01:00:22,293
[SPEAKER_05]: This is very interesting.

878
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:27,135
[SPEAKER_05]: When Ultramix 2 was first announced, a lot of people were like, yeah, whatever.

879
01:00:27,516 --> 01:00:34,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think Ultramix was very successful for those that already had an Xbox, but it didn't really convert a whole lot of people.

880
01:00:36,084 --> 01:00:36,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an exception.

881
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:39,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I did buy an Xbox pretty much so I could play Ultramix.

882
01:00:39,247 --> 01:00:39,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultramix and Halo.

883
01:00:40,108 --> 01:00:42,231
[SPEAKER_19]: This new one sounds like it's going to be a big selling point.

884
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:46,775
[SPEAKER_05]: But this new one, Microsoft should be sucking Konami's cock for this one.

885
01:00:46,835 --> 01:00:47,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

886
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:50,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're going to sell a lot of Xboxes with this mix, I think.

887
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on DDR fans alone.

888
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:53,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Microsoft better put out.

889
01:00:54,023 --> 01:00:54,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

890
01:00:54,644 --> 01:00:55,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft should be putting out.

891
01:00:57,518 --> 01:01:04,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It's... I don't know, maybe I should put a poll up over and see how many people are seriously contemplating buying an Xbox just because of Ultramix 2.

892
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:12,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of people were saying, when Ultramix 2 was first announced, yeah, yeah, yeah, great, Ultramix 2, yeah, whatever, you know, Xbox people will enjoy it.

893
01:01:13,322 --> 01:01:20,844
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that the song list is starting to come out and people are like, whoa, we're getting Moonlight Shadow and these 2DX songs that have never been in DDR before...

894
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:24,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I have to agree with Kyle in the chat room.

895
01:01:25,297 --> 01:01:27,917
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I actually wouldn't mind seeing Get On Beat Wildstyle.

896
01:01:28,297 --> 01:01:30,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing the original Get On Beat.

897
01:01:31,718 --> 01:01:33,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this certainly is not the full list.

898
01:01:33,698 --> 01:01:37,059
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just what we know so far about Ultramix 2.

899
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:38,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Lab.

900
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:39,700
[SPEAKER_19]: They need to put Lab.

901
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one thing I think is kind of different about Ultramix 2.

902
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:46,481
[SPEAKER_05]: They just announced this this week.

903
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:50,325
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a brand new dance mode in Ultramix 2.

904
01:01:51,005 --> 01:01:53,527
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes an Xbox different than a PlayStation 2?

905
01:01:55,269 --> 01:02:01,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than the obvious Microsoft and... It has... You can store a small family inside of it.

906
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:03,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides that.

907
01:02:03,726 --> 01:02:06,287
[SPEAKER_19]: It has a really big hard drive and four ports.

908
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:10,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, it has four ports, as opposed to two, which means what?

909
01:02:10,709 --> 01:02:12,270
[SPEAKER_05]: You can plug in four dance pads at once.

910
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Which means you don't need a multi-tap.

911
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:15,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you don't need a multi-tap.

912
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:16,211
[SPEAKER_19]: To play Bomberman.

913
01:02:16,312 --> 01:02:22,654
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, now you can plug in four dance pads at once, and you can play a brand new mode called Quad Mode.

914
01:02:23,315 --> 01:02:24,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be in Ultramix 2.

915
01:02:25,015 --> 01:02:26,136
[SPEAKER_19]: For four, wow!

916
01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:28,657
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be four, no, it's four pads.

917
01:02:28,737 --> 01:02:31,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a whole new set of steps for one person on four pads.

918
01:02:32,479 --> 01:02:33,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It's doubles-doubles.

919
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:34,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Evil.

920
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:40,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could have arrows that take you all the way from pad number one, way on the left, to pad number four.

921
01:02:40,408 --> 01:02:43,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people were talking about, well, what's the configuration going to be?

922
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:46,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you think about Tetris, you could have four squares a lot of different ways.

923
01:02:46,752 --> 01:02:47,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be one giant line.

924
01:02:49,173 --> 01:02:51,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to say that I copyrighted this about two years ago.

925
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:53,455
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be hearing from my lawyers.

926
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:58,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, because I was making edits for two machines to use all four panels.

927
01:02:59,539 --> 01:03:01,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Two different sets of edits to play one song.

928
01:03:02,304 --> 01:03:03,605
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my quad mode.

929
01:03:03,985 --> 01:03:05,686
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it, they stole it from me.

930
01:03:08,127 --> 01:03:10,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually remember doing something like this.

931
01:03:10,608 --> 01:03:16,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I remember one time at Arcade Infinity starting two machines at the same time to do some kind of, like, quad thing.

932
01:03:16,671 --> 01:03:20,312
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't even... I don't remember what the joke was, but there was something we were trying to do.

933
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:21,833
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, but you know what?

934
01:03:22,948 --> 01:03:26,012
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it seem like is happening with this mix, though, with the song list?

935
01:03:26,632 --> 01:03:36,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like they're listing their fanbase a little more, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did look out there and see that maybe there are people, crazy as they might be, that want this quad mode in DDR.

936
01:03:36,143 --> 01:03:41,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, me personally, I'm kind of like, well, I think it's a nice idea, like the quad mode, I think it's kind of cute, but...

937
01:03:42,868 --> 01:03:44,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's going to have four dance pads?

938
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,531
[SPEAKER_19]: It's innovative, I'll say that.

939
01:03:45,932 --> 01:03:48,334
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, okay, here's the argument to that.

940
01:03:48,815 --> 01:03:52,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Quad mode is only going to be available in something called the party mode on Ultramix 2.

941
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's obviously set up for DDR parties.

942
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:56,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as cheesy as that might sound.

943
01:03:56,824 --> 01:03:59,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Where your friends bring their dance pads over to your house.

944
01:04:00,348 --> 01:04:03,612
[SPEAKER_19]: Or maybe it's going to be something cool like two people can play doubles.

945
01:04:04,795 --> 01:04:06,035
[SPEAKER_05]: They have doubles versus, aren't they?

946
01:04:06,796 --> 01:04:07,096
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

947
01:04:07,116 --> 01:04:08,556
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think they said it was going to be a full four.

948
01:04:08,576 --> 01:04:09,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Beginner, light, standard, and heavy.

949
01:04:09,777 --> 01:04:13,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to re-look through, but I'm almost positive they said it was going to be a full new set.

950
01:04:13,778 --> 01:04:14,278
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

951
01:04:14,298 --> 01:04:14,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

952
01:04:35,356 --> 01:04:35,636
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

953
01:04:35,656 --> 01:04:36,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be very interesting, huh?

954
01:04:37,077 --> 01:04:45,780
[SPEAKER_19]: I want them to do another Best Hits on Xbox and bring out the individual mixes on one DVD.

955
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:47,741
[SPEAKER_19]: Guild Arcade mixes.

956
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:49,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, but remember, U.S.

957
01:04:49,862 --> 01:04:57,165
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't Japan, so unless they put it out for Japanese Xbox, which, you know, but they'll never do it because Xbox wasn't really popular over there.

958
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:58,425
[SPEAKER_19]: It's selling stuff.

959
01:04:58,785 --> 01:04:59,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but not quite.

960
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:08,732
[SPEAKER_19]: I still think that it would be neat so that I can, you know, not have to break out my Dreamcast every time I want to play Second Mix.

961
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:12,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they do have Second Mix on PlayStation.

962
01:05:12,593 --> 01:05:14,574
[SPEAKER_19]: You can go to that bowling alley in Auburn.

963
01:05:14,734 --> 01:05:16,555
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

964
01:05:16,615 --> 01:05:17,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what else?

965
01:05:18,383 --> 01:05:40,764
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple players on this is another interesting thing about Ultramix 2 now you can have multiple players on one Xbox going on Xbox Live to play so now you don't have to be you have to stay home it's kind of going more into the multiplayer and party functions where you can have multiple people over the song list will contain 70 songs not including the song packs which means that

966
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:50,406
[SPEAKER_05]: If you buy your song packs from Service Pack 1 through 6 for Ultramix 1, you can use these on Ultramix 2.

967
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:52,167
[SPEAKER_05]: So, think about this.

968
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:54,688
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 30 songs between Service Packs 1 through 6, right?

969
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:57,129
[SPEAKER_19]: And who speculated this while somebody was out of town?

970
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:00,510
[SPEAKER_19]: I do believe I did.

971
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

972
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:02,411
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

973
01:06:02,511 --> 01:06:02,911
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

974
01:06:03,331 --> 01:06:08,233
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's going to be 100 songs playable in Ultramix from the start.

975
01:06:09,554 --> 01:06:09,654
Crazy.

976
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:09,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.

977
01:06:11,164 --> 01:06:12,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Konami.

978
01:06:12,705 --> 01:06:13,165
[SPEAKER_19]: We love you.

979
01:06:13,485 --> 01:06:17,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's going to be inside that 14 Konami original DDR songs.

980
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:18,368
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kind of saw some of those.

981
01:06:19,228 --> 01:06:20,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Mine and all that stuff.

982
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:22,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to be very interesting.

983
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very interesting.

984
01:06:24,571 --> 01:06:28,233
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are going to have this downloadable edits thing, which I'm kind of curious how that's going to work.

985
01:06:28,273 --> 01:06:34,056
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody can submit edits, or if they're going to have some kind of screening process where they only take good edits or what they're going to do.

986
01:06:34,076 --> 01:06:35,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be very interesting.

987
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:38,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and Panda, I do believe the Xbox is region coded.

988
01:06:38,938 --> 01:06:39,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

989
01:06:39,598 --> 01:06:40,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I do believe it is.

990
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

991
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:43,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

992
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of excited to see this mix now.

993
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:53,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's been difficult in the past to get excited about anything Xbox, but boy, they're really doing DDR right on there, I say.

994
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:56,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to it.

995
01:06:57,087 --> 01:06:57,707
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you, Jamie?

996
01:06:57,928 --> 01:06:59,829
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this Ultramix 2 so far?

997
01:06:59,869 --> 01:07:00,409
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just so far.

998
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:01,049
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to get it.

999
01:07:01,229 --> 01:07:02,970
[SPEAKER_05]: We still haven't heard everything about it yet.

1000
01:07:03,091 --> 01:07:03,271
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1001
01:07:03,591 --> 01:07:04,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to get it.

1002
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,212
[SPEAKER_19]: You know I'll have it, even if I play it or not.

1003
01:07:06,933 --> 01:07:08,313
[SPEAKER_19]: I have Ultramix 1.

1004
01:07:08,414 --> 01:07:09,954
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, my Ultramix 1 is unopened.

1005
01:07:09,974 --> 01:07:10,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1006
01:07:10,695 --> 01:07:10,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Really.

1007
01:07:11,385 --> 01:07:16,447
[SPEAKER_19]: It is because I never had time, because by the time I got around to playing it, I was doing other things.

1008
01:07:16,587 --> 01:07:17,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least you bought it.

1009
01:07:17,707 --> 01:07:18,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, yeah, I have it.

1010
01:07:18,728 --> 01:07:19,908
[SPEAKER_19]: I have the dance pad and everything.

1011
01:07:20,168 --> 01:07:23,809
[SPEAKER_19]: But it'll give me a good excuse to break it out and start downloading the songpacks.

1012
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:24,250
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1013
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:27,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1014
01:07:28,051 --> 01:07:32,292
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you guys here that don't have an Xbox yet, like DDR Angel and Arcadian?

1015
01:07:32,312 --> 01:07:32,713
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

1016
01:07:32,773 --> 01:07:38,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this kind of making you go, oh boy, I might have to get an Xbox, or what do you think?

1017
01:07:38,995 --> 01:07:39,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

1018
01:07:40,816 --> 01:07:41,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm afraid that...

1019
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:05,224
[SPEAKER_17]: If I ever decided to get one, Magus would kill me.

1020
01:08:06,385 --> 01:08:08,085
[SPEAKER_17]: He just has this thing against Xbox, I guess.

1021
01:08:08,105 --> 01:08:08,766
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's DDR.

1022
01:08:08,806 --> 01:08:09,546
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll get over it.

1023
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:11,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, he should get over it because he's a Halo addict.

1024
01:08:12,407 --> 01:08:13,087
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1025
01:08:13,147 --> 01:08:14,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can play Halo on it, too.

1026
01:08:14,388 --> 01:08:15,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, you know what?

1027
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:18,309
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to know how his opinion should affect you buying something you want.

1028
01:08:18,809 --> 01:08:19,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, slam.

1029
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,591
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess he'd get over it.

1030
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:25,572
[SPEAKER_17]: So maybe I will.

1031
01:08:26,272 --> 01:08:26,612
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1032
01:08:27,653 --> 01:08:28,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn straight he'll get over it.

1033
01:08:28,873 --> 01:08:30,654
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want an Xbox, you should get an Xbox.

1034
01:08:31,513 --> 01:08:32,293
[SPEAKER_19]: So they just have to live.

1035
01:08:32,513 --> 01:08:34,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comment from the chat room.

1036
01:08:34,154 --> 01:08:41,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if I'm reading too far into this, but truthfully, it's going to be only those that don't know about the Sims that will get the Xbox, says John Fields.

1037
01:08:41,316 --> 01:08:43,737
[SPEAKER_05]: The others will download the steps as they have for every mix.

1038
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:45,958
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I go back to what I said earlier.

1039
01:08:46,018 --> 01:08:47,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Stepmania is not DDR.

1040
01:08:49,179 --> 01:08:49,599
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not.

1041
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,340
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think that Stepmania is going to have... Xbox Live.

1042
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,800
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't have Xbox Live.

1043
01:08:56,321 --> 01:08:58,281
[SPEAKER_19]: It does not have Xbox Live.

1044
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but they're...

1045
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, they're saying rumor is that they're going to have an internet thing, whatever.

1046
01:09:04,263 --> 01:09:05,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Eh.

1047
01:09:05,924 --> 01:09:06,965
[SPEAKER_05]: They have Step Mania online already.

1048
01:09:07,985 --> 01:09:09,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have Step Mania online already?

1049
01:09:09,426 --> 01:09:10,447
[SPEAKER_09]: How come I've never seen you play it?

1050
01:09:11,288 --> 01:09:12,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I just don't care.

1051
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:14,970
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but they already have Step Mania online.

1052
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:20,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't know, I'm still... I couldn't get that stupid thing to work.

1053
01:09:20,854 --> 01:09:23,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're still working on it.

1054
01:09:24,537 --> 01:09:26,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I think the percentage... But Xbox Live is already up.

1055
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:28,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the percentage...

1056
01:09:30,577 --> 01:09:31,307
[SPEAKER_19]: X-Lax Live

1057
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:39,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's such a small percentage of people that would opt out of Ultramix 2 for Step Mania.

1058
01:09:39,223 --> 01:09:41,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's why Konami hasn't sued the pants off of Step Mania yet.

1059
01:09:41,885 --> 01:09:46,207
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because it's going to be such a small percentage of people that it's really negligent.

1060
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:52,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, the DDR community that you see online and in chat rooms and stuff is not the scope of the DDR community as a whole.

1061
01:09:52,991 --> 01:10:00,296
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's going to be people who go, Oh, look, it's another game for the Xbox that's going to get my couch potato kid off of his ass.

1062
01:10:01,601 --> 01:10:09,302
[SPEAKER_19]: I've talked to plenty of parents who go into GameStop and say, oh, well, this is going to keep my kid from being lazy.

1063
01:10:10,285 --> 01:10:14,887
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm actually going to open up the Skype line because I'm curious what some folks out there think about Ultramix 2.

1064
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:19,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I especially like to hear from people who are contemplating buying an Xbox over this whole thing.

1065
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:21,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll open up that Skype line.

1066
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:27,913
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to call us, we have some information on our website, but just go to Skype.org and download the client there.

1067
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:28,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a free client.

1068
01:10:28,893 --> 01:10:29,774
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a free program.

1069
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:38,878
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to have, you have to have a broadband connection and a microphone and just add Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, to your contact list and you will be able to call us.

1070
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:39,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1071
01:10:39,398 --> 01:10:39,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1072
01:10:39,518 --> 01:10:39,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is this?

1073
01:10:57,509 --> 01:10:58,450
[SPEAKER_05]: and Unknown Gamer.

1074
01:11:21,734 --> 01:11:22,195
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

1075
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:23,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay?

1076
01:11:23,755 --> 01:11:24,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1077
01:11:24,736 --> 01:11:28,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there any songs that you're getting really excited about that you're going to be able to play?

1078
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Moonlight fucking Shadow.

1079
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:32,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Moonlight fucking Shadow is the word.

1080
01:11:32,759 --> 01:11:37,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, unknown gamer, if you can, turn up your mic volume on your end a little bit so we can hear you a little better.

1081
01:11:39,122 --> 01:11:40,903
[SPEAKER_05]: But he says Moonlight fucking Shadow.

1082
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:41,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Why Moonlight Shadow?

1083
01:11:43,384 --> 01:11:45,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm fucking obsessed with erotics.

1084
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he's obsessed with erotic.

1085
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:48,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-huh.

1086
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:49,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I see how it is.

1087
01:11:49,862 --> 01:11:50,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1088
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:51,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you like stalker obsessed?

1089
01:11:52,022 --> 01:11:52,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1090
01:11:53,363 --> 01:11:54,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh.

1091
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot.

1092
01:11:55,404 --> 01:11:55,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Very hot.

1093
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:56,744
[SPEAKER_19]: That hot.

1094
01:11:57,505 --> 01:11:59,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you already have an Xbox?

1095
01:11:59,845 --> 01:12:00,346
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I do not.

1096
01:12:00,726 --> 01:12:01,106
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you do not.

1097
01:12:01,146 --> 01:12:02,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you thinking about getting one?

1098
01:12:02,867 --> 01:12:03,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am.

1099
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:04,447
[SPEAKER_05]: That is obsession.

1100
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:06,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because of Moonlight Shadow?

1101
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:07,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1102
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:09,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that is an obsession.

1103
01:12:10,269 --> 01:12:11,270
[SPEAKER_05]: That is definitely an obsession.

1104
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,231
[SPEAKER_19]: You could get one of the nifty green Halo ones.

1105
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:14,351
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I bought.

1106
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Be like us, have a green one.

1107
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,760
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't make them in hot pink erotic flavor yet.

1108
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe soon.

1109
01:12:21,861 --> 01:12:24,621
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I don't think that erotic flavor would be hot pink.

1110
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:26,362
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it would be like blood red or something.

1111
01:12:26,382 --> 01:12:26,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be sex.

1112
01:12:27,422 --> 01:12:29,182
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be, yeah, it would be nookie colored.

1113
01:12:29,923 --> 01:12:30,663
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be like purple.

1114
01:12:31,383 --> 01:12:35,944
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to clarify something for folks in our chat room because people are going, wait a minute, Moonlight Shadow is an erotic song?

1115
01:12:36,984 --> 01:12:39,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, do you want to explain this one, Unknown Gamer, or do you want me to?

1116
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:43,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to explain it with the way my microphone sounds right now?

1117
01:12:43,758 --> 01:12:44,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, you're right.

1118
01:12:44,438 --> 01:12:45,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I better explain it.

1119
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:56,868
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why Moonlight Shadow is tied to Erotic is that actually the old lead singer from Erotic went and she joined this new band called Missing Heart.

1120
01:12:57,268 --> 01:12:59,290
[SPEAKER_05]: She kind of went off on her own and did this Missing Heart.

1121
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:05,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why it gets tied back to Erotic a lot because it's the same vocalist that you hear in a lot of the old Erotic songs.

1122
01:13:05,755 --> 01:13:09,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why Moonlight Shadow kind of has ties to Erotic.

1123
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:15,033
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only difference is that she's not going, Carried away by a moonlight shadow.

1124
01:13:18,535 --> 01:13:18,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob.

1125
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:19,816
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1126
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:20,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob.

1127
01:13:21,116 --> 01:13:22,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Never do that again, please.

1128
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:22,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1129
01:13:23,338 --> 01:13:23,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try.

1130
01:13:26,379 --> 01:13:28,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I screwed that up.

1131
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Lunarius is correcting me in the chat room.

1132
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:34,803
[SPEAKER_05]: He says it was originally sung by the vocalist for Erotic and then redone by the Missing Hearts singer.

1133
01:13:35,263 --> 01:13:36,204
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I fucked that up.

1134
01:13:36,264 --> 01:13:36,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1135
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:43,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to type to you the story of what happened and then you just tell people what happened.

1136
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:01,077
[SPEAKER_09]: You have dessert.

1137
01:14:01,257 --> 01:14:01,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I need dessert.

1138
01:14:02,297 --> 01:14:03,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I want dessert.

1139
01:14:03,118 --> 01:14:03,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I already ate it.

1140
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:07,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some Diverse System 7 tracks I would like to play.

1141
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:08,719
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1142
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:11,859
[SPEAKER_05]: No, wait, we have to wait for those, because we're getting another call real fast.

1143
01:14:11,919 --> 01:14:12,980
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm going to take this call.

1144
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:14,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1145
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:17,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1146
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:18,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1147
01:14:18,661 --> 01:14:20,081
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants Diverse System 7 tracks.

1148
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:22,102
[SPEAKER_05]: He does not want dessert.

1149
01:14:22,282 --> 01:14:23,222
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot hear you.

1150
01:14:23,342 --> 01:14:23,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Please speak up.

1151
01:14:26,555 --> 01:14:27,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, bummer.

1152
01:14:27,515 --> 01:14:29,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, call us back when you get your mic thing rearranged.

1153
01:14:29,956 --> 01:14:30,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1154
01:14:30,676 --> 01:14:30,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1155
01:14:31,456 --> 01:14:31,876
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too bad.

1156
01:14:31,996 --> 01:14:32,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, hold on.

1157
01:14:32,617 --> 01:14:34,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting the story with Moonlight Shadow here.

1158
01:14:37,058 --> 01:14:37,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought I was.

1159
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:40,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll get that.

1160
01:14:40,618 --> 01:14:41,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

1161
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:44,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the Diverse 7 stuff and then... Yes, you do.

1162
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:47,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Play the Diverse 7 stuff and then we'll come back to the story of Moonlight Shadow.

1163
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:51,541
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll open up the Skype line again later, guys.

1164
01:14:58,956 --> 01:14:59,596
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1165
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,381
Thanks for watching!

1166
01:16:23,533 --> 01:16:24,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, got to take that off there.

1167
01:16:25,254 --> 01:16:35,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, the next one, real quick, is a Trip Machine Dark Core mix, and my god, I have to say, this is, for Trip Machine, what P8107 was for Paranoia.

1168
01:16:35,778 --> 01:16:39,040
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's going to be fucking awesome, that's all I've got to say.

1169
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:39,040
... ... ...

1170
01:16:56,764 --> 01:16:58,025
Thanks for watching!

1171
01:17:23,587 --> 01:17:24,689
Thank you for watching!

1172
01:17:43,442 --> 01:17:48,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and then one that's really cool, I don't really know what exactly this is.

1173
01:17:48,385 --> 01:17:51,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It says it's Reality Alpha 0.2 mix.

1174
01:17:51,747 --> 01:17:59,472
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like what it is is just a bunch of different songs kind of mixed in the one, which is still kind of cool, but it's pretty hardcore, so check it out.

1175
01:19:07,088 --> 01:19:08,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that was a few of those.

1176
01:19:09,709 --> 01:19:17,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they want to order this album of all these Bomani remixes, although we'll be playing them on Diversions Monday night, where can they go to order the CD?

1177
01:19:18,093 --> 01:19:24,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Diverse Systems, that's www.diverse.jp, I don't think they're up for sale yet.

1178
01:19:24,696 --> 01:19:32,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, usually they have their own English page, which, you know, they sell most of their CDs, but it's not on there yet.

1179
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:32,900
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1180
01:19:33,863 --> 01:19:38,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember before, they did wait a little bit before they were available for the U.S.

1181
01:19:38,544 --> 01:19:48,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, you know, whether they're getting, you know, taking care of the Japanese first or whatnot, but, um, there's, I don't know when exactly these are going to be up right now.

1182
01:19:48,966 --> 01:19:52,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I was checking, um, right now, you can purchase them.

1183
01:19:52,207 --> 01:20:02,889
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a few links on, um, the right-hand side where you can purchase them from, um, and I don't know why they're selling them there, uh, Dojinci sites, um, so you can get those there, but, um,

1184
01:20:03,926 --> 01:20:07,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now available from their site, they don't have them yet.

1185
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:12,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm looking to see right now if it's on their ordering page.

1186
01:20:14,028 --> 01:20:18,889
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually it is on their Japanese ordering page, but not on their English ordering page.

1187
01:20:19,109 --> 01:20:25,531
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be able to, I don't know, you might be able to send them an email or something if you can speak Japanese, but...

1188
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:30,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, yeah, and it's going to be three different CDs.

1189
01:20:30,712 --> 01:20:31,753
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all pressed CDs.

1190
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:33,874
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be about $15 a piece.

1191
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:39,117
[SPEAKER_09]: That's D7 5 keys, D7 7 keys, and D7 Other Mixture.

1192
01:20:40,338 --> 01:20:44,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So definitely look for those, and I will be getting those as soon as I can order them.

1193
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:51,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I was going to open the Skype line back up because our caller wanted to call back because he had something he wanted to share with us.

1194
01:20:51,863 --> 01:20:53,924
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to open back up that Skype line there.

1195
01:20:54,004 --> 01:20:56,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can call us if you want.

1196
01:20:57,126 --> 01:20:58,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Skype.org to download the client.

1197
01:20:58,867 --> 01:21:04,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And pretty soon we're going to be going to break here and in the break we'll be hearing some songs that are going to be in Ultramix 2.

1198
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those port overs from 2DX.

1199
01:21:06,512 --> 01:21:09,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So those of you guys that haven't heard the songs yet can have a chance to hear them.

1200
01:21:10,094 --> 01:21:12,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, we want you to be able to hear the songs.

1201
01:21:13,316 --> 01:21:14,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's take this call.

1202
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1203
01:21:17,632 --> 01:21:18,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello there, Rob.

1204
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:19,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everybody.

1205
01:21:19,534 --> 01:21:20,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1206
01:21:20,195 --> 01:21:22,718
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Mr. VXJasonXV, is it not?

1207
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:24,159
[SPEAKER_06]: You would be correct.

1208
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:25,240
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, sir?

1209
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:26,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing pretty good.

1210
01:21:27,142 --> 01:21:27,463
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1211
01:21:27,523 --> 01:21:29,465
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want to talk to us with about Ultramix 2?

1212
01:21:30,246 --> 01:21:33,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I basically wanted to add in something about how the songpacks are going to work.

1213
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:37,974
[SPEAKER_06]: For all of you that have Ultramix already and have gotten the songpacks and didn't know this,

1214
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:45,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically what's going to happen is if you have the songpacks purchased and downloaded, when you fire up Ultramix 2, it's just going to work.

1215
01:21:45,545 --> 01:21:48,788
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be on the list, you're going to play them, it's going to be beautiful.

1216
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:53,031
[SPEAKER_06]: The only catch is the songpacks... What was that?

1217
01:21:53,231 --> 01:21:54,072
[SPEAKER_05]: It's plug and play.

1218
01:21:54,612 --> 01:21:56,033
[SPEAKER_06]: It is plug and play.

1219
01:21:57,695 --> 01:22:00,177
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen though is that the videos are going to be different.

1220
01:22:00,377 --> 01:22:03,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, obviously Ultramix is going to cycle video content.

1221
01:22:03,743 --> 01:22:11,745
[SPEAKER_06]: But Order of Chaos on DDR Freak said that there's going to be exclusive videos, brand new videos for those songs now on Ultramix 2.

1222
01:22:12,285 --> 01:22:12,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1223
01:22:12,985 --> 01:22:20,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically the media is going to be already on the DVD, but the steps and actually showing up is going to be off your hard drive for downloading the content.

1224
01:22:20,808 --> 01:22:25,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard rumors that there's going to be a lot of new videos in Ultramix 2.

1225
01:22:26,932 --> 01:22:27,893
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're pushing for.

1226
01:22:27,953 --> 01:22:31,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how much I can say, but I hear that there's a lot of new videos in Ultramix 2.

1227
01:22:32,335 --> 01:22:35,637
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're wanting to see some new videos, Ultramix 2 is going to give you plenty.

1228
01:22:37,097 --> 01:22:37,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

1229
01:22:38,438 --> 01:22:38,858
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1230
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:44,521
[SPEAKER_06]: You will still be able to buy the first six song packs on Ultramix 2.

1231
01:22:45,222 --> 01:22:50,144
[SPEAKER_06]: The only catch is if you do that, you can only use them for Ultramix 2 and not for the first one.

1232
01:22:50,825 --> 01:22:51,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

1233
01:22:51,645 --> 01:22:54,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're smart, you'll buy your packs on Ultramix 1 now.

1234
01:22:55,458 --> 01:23:01,563
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what I want to do, because there's no word yet if the songpacks are going to be removed from purchase for Ultramix 1.

1235
01:23:01,863 --> 01:23:04,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping not, so I can get them too, but, you know.

1236
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you actually have Ultramix 1 right now?

1237
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:09,069
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't even have an Xbox.

1238
01:23:09,389 --> 01:23:11,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Ultramix 2 making you change your mind here?

1239
01:23:11,971 --> 01:23:20,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I've wanted to get one for a while, I've just never really had a good amount of incentive, but this is definitely making me want one even more now.

1240
01:23:20,618 --> 01:23:23,881
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're telling me that Jet Set Radio Future was not enough?

1241
01:23:24,501 --> 01:23:24,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1242
01:23:25,638 --> 01:23:26,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I never played the first one.

1243
01:23:26,659 --> 01:23:28,421
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in... Halo 2?

1244
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:32,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, now that you can get Jet... If you get your Xbox, you should also get Jet Star Radio Future since it's cheap now.

1245
01:23:33,185 --> 01:23:33,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1246
01:23:33,725 --> 01:23:34,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1247
01:23:34,226 --> 01:23:34,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good game.

1248
01:23:35,767 --> 01:23:36,408
[SPEAKER_19]: And the Buffy game.

1249
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:38,730
[SPEAKER_19]: The Buffy game.

1250
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Buffy, yeah.

1251
01:23:41,092 --> 01:23:42,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Jason, when you... I wanna look into that.

1252
01:23:42,613 --> 01:23:45,656
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get your Xbox, we're gonna have a battle on Xbox Live, alright?

1253
01:23:46,176 --> 01:23:46,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds awesome.

1254
01:23:46,937 --> 01:23:48,078
[SPEAKER_12]: You're gonna get served!

1255
01:23:48,118 --> 01:23:50,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm gonna serve you on Xbox Live.

1256
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:51,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no!

1257
01:23:51,341 --> 01:23:51,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no!

1258
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:55,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually thinking about this.

1259
01:23:55,289 --> 01:23:55,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1260
01:23:55,809 --> 01:24:00,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to kind of put some feelers out in the chat room and kind of see what you guys think about this.

1261
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:04,671
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you guys think about starting up some kind of Sunday night Ultramix League?

1262
01:24:05,032 --> 01:24:06,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Like right after the show.

1263
01:24:06,432 --> 01:24:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: We all jump on Xbox Live and play.

1264
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:08,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do it.

1265
01:24:09,093 --> 01:24:10,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll even jump on there and play.

1266
01:24:10,773 --> 01:24:12,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge DDR team?

1267
01:24:12,474 --> 01:24:16,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it'll be like our Sunday night, you know, Ultramix night.

1268
01:24:16,475 --> 01:24:17,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Like post-show thing.

1269
01:24:18,536 --> 01:24:19,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how many people would be interested.

1270
01:24:20,036 --> 01:24:21,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if that's like way too dorky for you guys.

1271
01:24:21,957 --> 01:24:22,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1272
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:29,820
[SPEAKER_06]: If it brings people together and gets us some good playtime in, sounds good by me.

1273
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've actually been on Xbox Live after the show.

1274
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:39,963
[SPEAKER_05]: There's at least one person in our chatroom that sometimes likes to get on there and play different songs after the show sometimes.

1275
01:24:40,003 --> 01:24:42,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm thinking, why not expand it and get a lot of people on there?

1276
01:24:42,584 --> 01:24:43,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be kind of fun.

1277
01:24:43,524 --> 01:24:43,924
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

1278
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:49,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard the people that are getting on live that there's very few people that play on live anymore.

1279
01:24:49,274 --> 01:24:52,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anymore, but think about when the first game came out, too.

1280
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:53,258
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1281
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,540
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's almost a year old now.

1282
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:57,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course there's not a lot of people still on Xbox Live.

1283
01:24:57,942 --> 01:25:00,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But, hey, that's the thing, is that we want to start something up, too.

1284
01:25:00,865 --> 01:25:01,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start it.

1285
01:25:01,465 --> 01:25:02,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get Ultramix.

1286
01:25:03,347 --> 01:25:05,048
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like an I Love the 90s thing.

1287
01:25:05,088 --> 01:25:06,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when the old stuff was cool?

1288
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:08,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when Ultramix was cool?

1289
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:08,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of bringing it back.

1290
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:10,874
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see.

1291
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:12,280
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1292
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:12,480
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1293
01:25:35,638 --> 01:25:35,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1294
01:25:35,778 --> 01:25:36,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1295
01:25:36,199 --> 01:25:41,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody should buy me an Xbox and all the songpacks and a live subscription for a few years, because I don't have money yet, and I have bills to pay.

1296
01:26:02,445 --> 01:26:04,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sure that's the same boat a lot of folks are in.

1297
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:06,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll drop the price of an Xbox again.

1298
01:26:06,527 --> 01:26:07,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Not likely, but you never know.

1299
01:26:07,688 --> 01:26:08,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully.

1300
01:26:08,188 --> 01:26:08,909
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they right now?

1301
01:26:08,929 --> 01:26:08,909
$150?

1302
01:26:09,109 --> 01:26:14,372
[SPEAKER_05]: $175?

1303
01:26:09,209 --> 01:26:14,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I think $150, but you could get a refurbed one at one of those places for $120, $130.

1304
01:26:14,732 --> 01:26:15,653
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1305
01:26:16,253 --> 01:26:18,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say version 1s are a lot better anyways.

1306
01:26:18,614 --> 01:26:20,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the Super Halo ones, so I don't know.

1307
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:23,697
[SPEAKER_18]: You know you can hack them if you have a memory stick.

1308
01:26:24,918 --> 01:26:25,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I have heard.

1309
01:26:25,898 --> 01:26:26,859
[SPEAKER_06]: There's plenty of those.

1310
01:26:26,879 --> 01:26:30,721
[SPEAKER_19]: And you have to use the first release of, like, Mecha Assault.

1311
01:26:31,178 --> 01:26:32,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1312
01:26:32,218 --> 01:26:33,559
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, a friend of ours can do it.

1313
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:35,800
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going to test that theory soon.

1314
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:38,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, did someone get married?

1315
01:26:39,301 --> 01:26:39,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1316
01:26:40,702 --> 01:26:41,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well thanks for calling, Jason.

1317
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:42,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1318
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:43,283
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a good one.

1319
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:44,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Call back anytime.

1320
01:26:44,603 --> 01:26:45,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Anytime, my friend, anytime.

1321
01:26:46,484 --> 01:26:46,704
Bye.

1322
01:26:46,804 --> 01:26:47,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1323
01:26:47,844 --> 01:26:52,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll keep the Skype line open if anybody else has something they want to comment on with Ultramix 2.

1324
01:26:55,247 --> 01:26:57,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm serious about this Xbox Live thing after the show.

1325
01:26:57,848 --> 01:26:58,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be fun.

1326
01:26:58,829 --> 01:26:59,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you guys play?

1327
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making pouty faces and blinking my eyelashes.

1328
01:27:04,681 --> 01:27:05,241
[SPEAKER_18]: On Sunday?

1329
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:06,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, wait a minute, Loki.

1330
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:12,363
[SPEAKER_05]: With Ultramix 2, multiple people can play from one Xbox, so you and I can both play on the Ultramix.

1331
01:27:12,663 --> 01:27:13,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, really?

1332
01:27:14,183 --> 01:27:16,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, don't say... Don't care.

1333
01:27:17,604 --> 01:27:18,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play Final Fantasy XI.

1334
01:27:20,305 --> 01:27:20,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerk.

1335
01:27:21,045 --> 01:27:21,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerk.

1336
01:27:21,805 --> 01:27:22,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Angel.

1337
01:27:22,345 --> 01:27:25,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Screw it, I'm gonna twist Magus' arm and make him buy me an Xbox.

1338
01:27:25,526 --> 01:27:29,527
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't worry, those demons that come through my demonic vortex can play with you.

1339
01:27:31,815 --> 01:27:32,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

1340
01:27:33,596 --> 01:27:36,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Now some folks in the chat room are saying we should do it before the show.

1341
01:27:37,217 --> 01:27:39,638
[SPEAKER_19]: After the show would be too late, because honestly, I'm driving home.

1342
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:40,278
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1343
01:27:40,678 --> 01:27:43,759
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also work an earlier schedule now.

1344
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:47,020
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to get up at 5.30 in the morning to go to work.

1345
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll have to think.

1346
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:49,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1347
01:27:49,241 --> 01:27:49,681
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1348
01:27:49,701 --> 01:27:50,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Because my ass is going to school.

1349
01:27:50,981 --> 01:27:54,702
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, for me personally, I have to get my Sunday stuff done before the show.

1350
01:27:54,762 --> 01:27:55,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

1351
01:27:55,443 --> 01:27:55,803
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1352
01:27:56,363 --> 01:27:57,483
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll butt heads on it.

1353
01:27:57,503 --> 01:27:58,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, how about a different night?

1354
01:27:59,084 --> 01:27:59,664
[SPEAKER_05]: That might work, too.

1355
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:08,076
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we'll see what we can do.

1356
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,558
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's an interest for doing something like that, we'll set something up.

1357
01:28:10,798 --> 01:28:11,139
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1358
01:28:11,779 --> 01:28:17,144
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, as soon as I tell Magus what songs are on the new Ultramix 2, he'll probably get one.

1359
01:28:17,546 --> 01:28:17,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe.

1360
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:23,733
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not even... We haven't even really... We've only heard, like, one new licensed song, Brick House, by Commodores.

1361
01:28:24,013 --> 01:28:28,799
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't even heard about any of the other stuff, and there might be some really good stuff that's going to tell us next time.

1362
01:28:28,819 --> 01:28:30,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit, I would just play it for the Commodores song.

1363
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:35,487
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an inside joke between Pixie Dust and I, so, yeah.

1364
01:28:35,667 --> 01:28:36,087
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1365
01:28:37,168 --> 01:28:37,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1366
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:38,410
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1367
01:28:39,288 --> 01:28:45,272
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're going to do now, actually, I think we'll go ahead and take a break, and we're going to play those songs from Ultramix 2 that are being ported over from 2DX.

1368
01:28:45,332 --> 01:28:50,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this break, you're going to hear Route 80s, Star Mine, and VJ Army.

1369
01:28:50,715 --> 01:28:52,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be back right after this.

1370
01:28:52,576 --> 01:28:54,638
[SPEAKER_05]: You are tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.

1371
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:57,299
[SPEAKER_05]: After the break, we might get into the cage match, I think.

1372
01:28:57,339 --> 01:28:58,540
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do that at some point.

1373
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And so much more, as soon as we can think of it.

1374
01:29:02,422 --> 01:29:03,503
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll be back.

1375
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,022
Thanks for watching!

1376
01:29:30,089 --> 01:29:31,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't the movie on?

1377
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:31,930
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the time!

1378
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Why isn't the movie on?

1379
01:29:34,891 --> 01:29:35,712
You have the time!

1380
01:30:02,281 --> 01:30:02,942
Thanks for watching!

1381
01:30:33,211 --> 01:30:35,012
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a movie and you understand?

1382
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:38,151
Thanks for watching!

1383
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:41,810
Thank you for watching!

1384
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:19,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, did you hear about that show?

1385
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:20,980
[SPEAKER_10]: What show?

1386
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:26,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

1387
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:28,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I've heard of that station.

1388
01:34:28,521 --> 01:34:28,881
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?

1389
01:34:29,281 --> 01:34:31,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

1390
01:34:31,862 --> 01:34:34,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

1391
01:34:34,342 --> 01:34:35,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you die.

1392
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:36,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I, what?

1393
01:34:37,283 --> 01:34:41,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

1394
01:34:41,484 --> 01:34:41,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Ahhhh!

1395
01:34:43,707 --> 01:34:44,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1396
01:34:44,988 --> 01:34:46,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen or die!

1397
01:34:57,433 --> 01:34:57,553
[SPEAKER_05]: D.D.R.

1398
01:34:57,653 --> 01:34:57,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Extreme

1399
01:35:22,854 --> 01:35:27,497
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually some brand new eye toy modes in DDR, and it's very interesting.

1400
01:35:28,137 --> 01:35:30,479
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Clean the Screen, of course, which is nothing new.

1401
01:35:30,539 --> 01:35:33,640
[SPEAKER_05]: That was in the E3 demo, you remember that?

1402
01:35:34,241 --> 01:35:39,604
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there's one called Coconut Panic, which, by the way, has nothing to do with DDR at all.

1403
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:42,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I thought was very interesting.

1404
01:35:42,831 --> 01:35:44,791
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all these coconuts falling in, you know.

1405
01:35:45,752 --> 01:35:47,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have to clean the screen.

1406
01:35:47,893 --> 01:35:51,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to look at some of these screenshots, which we linked from OrangeloungeRadio.com.

1407
01:35:51,354 --> 01:35:53,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Cleaning the screen was neat, but it'd be kind of annoying to play, I think.

1408
01:35:54,876 --> 01:36:00,699
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I think is cool, though, is that for working out purposes, the eye toy thing is cool.

1409
01:36:00,999 --> 01:36:01,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

1410
01:36:01,159 --> 01:36:04,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's the only reason I would use it, is that... Hands and feet mode, too.

1411
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1412
01:36:05,601 --> 01:36:05,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1413
01:36:07,568 --> 01:36:13,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then they have that Feed the Animals game, which I haven't really seen a whole lot about, but it looks very interesting, that's for sure.

1414
01:36:15,173 --> 01:36:19,735
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one where you're gonna step on the different food, and you feed it to the animal that's on the screen.

1415
01:36:20,656 --> 01:36:21,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

1416
01:36:23,035 --> 01:36:23,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Very crazy.

1417
01:36:24,355 --> 01:36:27,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I find some more information about some of these modes?

1418
01:36:27,556 --> 01:36:28,096
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do we have?

1419
01:36:28,136 --> 01:36:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Hyper Dash, which looks like the old school track and field, which I have no idea how that's going to work with the Eye Toy.

1420
01:36:34,498 --> 01:36:43,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might actually just be using the dance pad where you're just going to run in place like all, every single old school Nintendo Power Pad game was just like running in place as fast as you can.

1421
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was your workout, remember?

1422
01:36:48,062 --> 01:36:48,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they have...

1423
01:36:50,754 --> 01:36:52,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Aerobics was a little different.

1424
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:54,716
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool 8-bit sounds and stuff.

1425
01:36:55,136 --> 01:36:58,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they have this one called Magical Ball.

1426
01:36:59,218 --> 01:37:04,501
[SPEAKER_05]: This new iToy game, Magical Ball, which, again, doesn't appear to have anything to do with DDR.

1427
01:37:04,661 --> 01:37:08,743
[SPEAKER_05]: It just is like Breakout, you know, the old school game Breakout or Arachnoid.

1428
01:37:09,243 --> 01:37:10,423
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's Arachnoid, whatever.

1429
01:37:10,784 --> 01:37:15,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But you use your hands as a paddle, which I think is very interesting.

1430
01:37:15,686 --> 01:37:16,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Magical Ball.

1431
01:37:18,187 --> 01:37:20,068
[SPEAKER_05]: You can show Konami your Magical Balls.

1432
01:37:23,433 --> 01:37:23,573
[SPEAKER_05]: V-Rare

1433
01:37:53,052 --> 01:37:54,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody looks so enthused.

1434
01:37:54,713 --> 01:37:55,793
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have to order it.

1435
01:37:56,574 --> 01:37:58,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, then again, my man does manage a webcam.

1436
01:37:59,595 --> 01:37:59,875
[SPEAKER_19]: A webcam.

1437
01:37:59,895 --> 01:38:00,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say webcam.

1438
01:38:01,096 --> 01:38:03,097
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of business is your man in?

1439
01:38:03,497 --> 01:38:06,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Look, I was typing webcam on the thing.

1440
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:07,779
[SPEAKER_19]: It's GameStop.

1441
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:08,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1442
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:09,420
[SPEAKER_05]: You sure?

1443
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:10,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1444
01:38:11,441 --> 01:38:11,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob.

1445
01:38:12,442 --> 01:38:12,662
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1446
01:38:12,782 --> 01:38:13,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

1447
01:38:13,102 --> 01:38:14,043
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1448
01:38:14,303 --> 01:38:14,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

1449
01:38:14,563 --> 01:38:14,703
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1450
01:38:15,704 --> 01:38:15,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Bite me.

1451
01:38:16,324 --> 01:38:17,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1452
01:38:20,226 --> 01:38:20,546
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1453
01:38:23,942 --> 01:38:31,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess if no one has anything else to say on the DDR Extreme, why don't we just go ahead and have ourselves a cage match?

1454
01:38:31,324 --> 01:38:31,964
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that sound?

1455
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:34,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1456
01:38:34,645 --> 01:38:35,385
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll do it.

1457
01:38:35,985 --> 01:38:37,025
[SPEAKER_19]: I got to be lazy today.

1458
01:38:37,045 --> 01:38:38,766
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean you got to be lazy today?

1459
01:38:39,126 --> 01:38:40,306
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't have to bring one.

1460
01:38:40,946 --> 01:38:42,727
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, because you won last week, didn't you?

1461
01:38:42,907 --> 01:38:43,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-huh.

1462
01:38:43,687 --> 01:38:44,167
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1463
01:38:44,387 --> 01:38:44,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Finally.

1464
01:38:45,367 --> 01:38:48,788
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so just as a reminder, the way the cage match works,

1465
01:38:49,656 --> 01:38:54,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be in our chat room at www.orangeloundtrader.com Click on chat.

1466
01:38:54,059 --> 01:38:56,000
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play three songs for you guys.

1467
01:38:56,501 --> 01:39:01,484
[SPEAKER_05]: A clip of last week's winner because, you know, you were listening last week so you've already heard it.

1468
01:39:01,905 --> 01:39:03,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're only going to play a clip of it.

1469
01:39:03,946 --> 01:39:07,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll hear two new songs brought to the table from each host.

1470
01:39:07,789 --> 01:39:09,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And you will vote on your favorite.

1471
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:21,892
[SPEAKER_05]: and the winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's, I'm sorry, Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program, which plays on this station 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we aren't live.

1472
01:39:22,852 --> 01:39:24,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so here we go.

1473
01:39:25,113 --> 01:39:31,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week's winner was Jamie and she brought to the table a song by Mflow, which you know from old school DDR games and 2DX.

1474
01:39:32,423 --> 01:39:34,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is their new album.

1475
01:39:34,685 --> 01:39:38,087
[SPEAKER_05]: From their new album, it's a song called Astro Sexy Chemistry.

1476
01:39:38,407 --> 01:39:39,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's last week's winner.

1477
01:39:39,768 --> 01:39:40,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here's a clip of it.

1478
01:39:41,129 --> 01:39:43,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can decide if you want it to win again tonight.

1479
01:39:43,351 --> 01:39:45,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one, M-Flow, Astro Sexy.

1480
01:39:45,553 --> 01:39:47,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Astro Sexy Chemistry

1481
01:40:09,495 --> 01:40:10,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1482
01:41:34,115 --> 01:41:34,896
Thank you for watching!

1483
01:42:08,038 --> 01:42:10,861
All right, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's cage match.

1484
01:42:10,881 --> 01:42:12,542
M-Flow with Astro Sexy.

1485
01:42:32,423 --> 01:42:37,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, the next pick in tonight's cage match, the first challenger comes from our very own Loki.

1486
01:42:37,828 --> 01:42:39,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what did you pick for tonight's cage match?

1487
01:42:41,451 --> 01:42:43,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I picked a song, but I don't know what it's from.

1488
01:42:43,553 --> 01:42:47,937
[SPEAKER_09]: It's... They said it was from Outphase.

1489
01:42:48,557 --> 01:42:51,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's from Outphase, but it's called Nuance.

1490
01:42:54,284 --> 01:43:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of those songs where somebody has decided they are going to say it's from Outphase even though they have no particular proof of this, right?

1491
01:43:02,991 --> 01:43:03,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1492
01:43:03,951 --> 01:43:05,973
[SPEAKER_05]: But you liked it anyway, so you're putting it in a cage match.

1493
01:43:06,794 --> 01:43:07,694
[SPEAKER_07]: That and I just don't care.

1494
01:43:08,295 --> 01:43:08,615
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1495
01:43:09,264 --> 01:43:26,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough, so here it is, an unknown group that we're going to call, not Outphase, Inphase, maybe somebody will recognize us and help us out, who knows, and the song is called Nuon, and this is Loki's pick in tonight's cage match, enjoy.

1496
01:43:44,122 --> 01:43:44,923
Thanks for watching!

1497
01:46:04,972 --> 01:46:05,773
Thanks for watching!

1498
01:46:48,056 --> 01:46:49,117
Thanks for watching!

1499
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:43,981
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1500
01:47:44,081 --> 01:47:48,142
[SPEAKER_05]: A group that they are saying is out-phased, but we're kind of skeptical at this point.

1501
01:47:48,602 --> 01:47:52,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But Nuon is the song, and Loki liked it so much he put it in tonight's cage match.

1502
01:47:52,283 --> 01:47:53,463
[SPEAKER_05]: What did the rest of us think?

1503
01:47:53,563 --> 01:47:53,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie?

1504
01:47:53,963 --> 01:47:55,483
[SPEAKER_19]: That doesn't sound like any out-phase to me.

1505
01:47:55,824 --> 01:47:58,124
[SPEAKER_19]: I did not detect the presence of Taku in that.

1506
01:47:59,864 --> 01:48:00,805
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would know!

1507
01:48:01,405 --> 01:48:04,105
[SPEAKER_19]: Because, see, some people have various types of radar.

1508
01:48:04,686 --> 01:48:05,386
[SPEAKER_19]: I have Takudar.

1509
01:48:07,443 --> 01:48:08,244
[SPEAKER_19]: And it didn't go off.

1510
01:48:09,064 --> 01:48:09,885
[SPEAKER_19]: It didn't even blink.

1511
01:48:11,145 --> 01:48:15,408
[SPEAKER_19]: So, it sounds pretty generic-y trance, honestly, to me.

1512
01:48:15,888 --> 01:48:17,870
[SPEAKER_19]: So it gets the 7 for being average.

1513
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:20,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, 7 for being average from Jamie.

1514
01:48:21,012 --> 01:48:22,973
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Angel, what did you think of Nuance?

1515
01:48:24,594 --> 01:48:25,415
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was pretty good.

1516
01:48:25,475 --> 01:48:31,620
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, pretty good for like background music if you need to do your homework or something.

1517
01:48:32,121 --> 01:48:35,404
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, if you're just playing around, photo editing or whatever.

1518
01:48:35,424 --> 01:48:39,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd probably say an 8.5.

1519
01:48:40,788 --> 01:48:41,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian 42.

1520
01:48:41,549 --> 01:48:46,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll say it sounded way too generic for me.

1521
01:48:46,834 --> 01:48:47,635
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't too bad.

1522
01:48:47,695 --> 01:48:48,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give it a 7.5.

1523
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:50,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki.

1524
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:51,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give it an 8.

1525
01:48:52,697 --> 01:48:58,526
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and my thought is if that is out phase, it's very generic and very sad direction for them.

1526
01:48:58,606 --> 01:49:02,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So I remain highly skeptical as to that being out phase.

1527
01:49:02,933 --> 01:49:05,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little generic, but it's not bad.

1528
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:07,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just heard Better Trance, so I give it a 7.

1529
01:49:08,752 --> 01:49:24,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but our opinions don't count, it's you in the chatroom that has the final say, and now you get my pick in tonight's page match, and I am being very adventurous tonight, because I haven't even completely heard the song I'm putting in, ever.

1530
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:33,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard it at the club the other night, and then I downloaded it, and now I'm putting it in, and I have no idea if I even like this song as much as I thought I did,

1531
01:49:34,153 --> 01:49:35,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold me my sweet, hold me now, hold me God

1532
01:50:24,468 --> 01:50:25,389
and many more.

1533
01:51:21,528 --> 01:51:22,249
Thanks for watching!

1534
01:52:08,524 --> 01:52:09,645
Thanks for watching!

1535
01:52:50,896 --> 01:52:52,418
Power of New Life Sweets

1536
01:53:27,079 --> 01:53:29,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that was song number three in tonight's Cage Match.

1537
01:53:29,379 --> 01:53:30,480
[SPEAKER_05]: A song I've never heard before.

1538
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Royal Gigolos with California Dreamin'.

1539
01:53:33,601 --> 01:53:33,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie.

1540
01:53:35,601 --> 01:53:36,122
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

1541
01:53:37,982 --> 01:53:45,385
[SPEAKER_19]: That was really... And I understand you... Had you heard it through all the way, I'm sure you would have reconsidered your choice.

1542
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:45,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1543
01:53:47,252 --> 01:53:47,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1544
01:53:47,612 --> 01:53:49,953
[SPEAKER_05]: The mix I heard was actually a little different.

1545
01:53:50,033 --> 01:53:54,415
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was more repetitive than our... I remember it being, like, trancier, actually.

1546
01:53:54,455 --> 01:53:56,856
[SPEAKER_19]: I was kind of getting into it at first, because I was like, hey, this is kind of cool.

1547
01:53:57,057 --> 01:53:58,517
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it was like, eh.

1548
01:53:59,498 --> 01:54:03,419
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the bitches singing, because I don't think it was a sample of the Mamas and the Poppers.

1549
01:54:03,439 --> 01:54:04,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was either.

1550
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:05,460
[SPEAKER_05]: In the video, it wasn't.

1551
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:12,243
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're going to be a professional singer, a requirement is that you hold a key.

1552
01:54:14,584 --> 01:54:16,225
[SPEAKER_19]: However, there's Politary...

1553
01:54:17,822 --> 01:54:25,645
[SPEAKER_19]: However, where I would normally have given that a 4, because of the name of the band, I said I'd give them a bonus point so they get a 5.

1554
01:54:26,145 --> 01:54:26,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1555
01:54:27,926 --> 01:54:28,806
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Angel.

1556
01:54:29,246 --> 01:54:29,606
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

1557
01:54:29,686 --> 01:54:36,809
[SPEAKER_19]: I've actually heard better keys held by band newbies.

1558
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:38,910
[SPEAKER_19]: By band newbies.

1559
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:46,853
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you've never been in a saxophone class with 6th graders who have never played a saxophone before, it sounds like cows being beaten to death.

1560
01:54:48,015 --> 01:54:49,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, DDR Angel.

1561
01:54:50,057 --> 01:54:50,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Moo.

1562
01:54:50,697 --> 01:54:51,018
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1563
01:54:51,038 --> 01:54:57,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, gee, I don't know.

1564
01:54:58,463 --> 01:55:01,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, the song was okay.

1565
01:55:01,426 --> 01:55:04,328
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it was kind of dancey, it was kind of cool, so.

1566
01:55:05,689 --> 01:55:07,230
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe I'll be generous and give it an 8.

1567
01:55:07,971 --> 01:55:10,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, a pity point from, uh, DDR Angel.

1568
01:55:11,053 --> 01:55:11,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian.

1569
01:55:13,075 --> 01:55:14,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was alright.

1570
01:55:14,396 --> 01:55:15,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, nothing special.

1571
01:55:16,138 --> 01:55:16,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, 6.

1572
01:55:17,307 --> 01:55:18,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki.

1573
01:55:19,349 --> 01:55:25,295
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm going to follow the same guidelines that, you know, DarkSakura gives the song, I'm going to have to give it a 1.

1574
01:55:28,601 --> 01:55:32,904
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote Muffin Juice, it sounds more like an elephant getting a pineapple shoved up its ass.

1575
01:55:32,924 --> 01:55:33,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you guys are mean.

1576
01:55:33,665 --> 01:55:34,065
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be...

1577
01:55:56,401 --> 01:55:56,801
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1578
01:55:56,861 --> 01:55:57,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's see.

1579
01:55:57,441 --> 01:55:57,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1580
01:55:57,922 --> 01:56:00,482
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room may have felt a little differently than the rest of you, right?

1581
01:56:00,502 --> 01:56:01,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no way to imitate that.

1582
01:56:01,443 --> 01:56:04,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is up to them to choose between these three songs.

1583
01:56:04,864 --> 01:56:07,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one, M-Flow, Astro Sexy.

1584
01:56:08,065 --> 01:56:10,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two, Not Out Phase with Nuon.

1585
01:56:10,826 --> 01:56:12,046
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a horrible clip.

1586
01:56:12,086 --> 01:56:13,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try again.

1587
01:56:32,438 --> 01:56:36,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and song number three, Royal Gigolo's California Dreamin'.

1588
01:56:48,983 --> 01:56:52,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, place vote now.

1589
01:56:52,966 --> 01:56:56,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.

1590
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:59,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, you must send it over private message.

1591
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:07,919
[SPEAKER_05]: If you yell it out in the main chatroom, you will not only not have your vote counted, but you will be mocked openly for not listening to the directions.

1592
01:57:08,959 --> 01:57:09,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, Jamie.

1593
01:57:10,961 --> 01:57:14,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, so... What else am I here for but public mockery?

1594
01:57:16,869 --> 01:57:20,733
[SPEAKER_05]: If caning were to be brought back, somehow I imagine you would be involved.

1595
01:57:20,773 --> 01:57:21,934
[SPEAKER_05]: You would be the administrator.

1596
01:57:22,134 --> 01:57:23,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, that'd be cool.

1597
01:57:25,337 --> 01:57:28,440
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I still think my opinion is to solve all the world's problems?

1598
01:57:28,701 --> 01:57:28,921
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1599
01:57:29,301 --> 01:57:29,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Two methods.

1600
01:57:30,342 --> 01:57:32,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Standardized test and battle royale.

1601
01:57:33,105 --> 01:57:33,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1602
01:57:34,006 --> 01:57:36,348
[SPEAKER_19]: I seriously think they should take all the inmates, put them on nylons,

1603
01:57:37,536 --> 01:57:39,697
[SPEAKER_05]: They made a movie out of that with Ray Liotta.

1604
01:57:39,717 --> 01:57:40,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called No Escape.

1605
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:49,220
[SPEAKER_19]: But they need to, when they have one left, and he thinks he's a winner and going back to become a productive member of society, then they sink his boat.

1606
01:57:51,461 --> 01:57:52,122
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are horrible.

1607
01:57:53,722 --> 01:57:54,742
[SPEAKER_19]: New reality TV.

1608
01:57:55,443 --> 01:57:56,363
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are horrible.

1609
01:57:57,844 --> 01:57:58,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1610
01:58:00,184 --> 01:58:04,246
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a break pretty soon here while we tally up those cage match votes, and when we

1611
01:58:05,424 --> 01:58:06,225
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1612
01:58:25,521 --> 01:58:30,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where we determine on this show the definitive top three of something.

1613
01:58:30,648 --> 01:58:32,431
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because top shows are very popular.

1614
01:58:32,671 --> 01:58:40,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we have the top ten games and top ten... So we here on Orange Lounge Radio are going to come up with our very own top three.

1615
01:58:40,121 --> 01:58:41,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight's topic...

1616
01:58:41,583 --> 01:58:45,366
[SPEAKER_05]: is I toy game I would most like to see on DDR.

1617
01:58:45,807 --> 01:58:49,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of you guys may have a suggestion out there in the chat room.

1618
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:50,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might want to type those out because you never know.

1619
01:58:51,452 --> 01:58:55,095
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the hosts or the guests might pick that up and use it as their suggestion.

1620
01:58:55,155 --> 01:58:56,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So we shall see.

1621
01:58:58,021 --> 01:58:58,622
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1622
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:21,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox is going to have a brand new Sonic Mega Collection coming out for it.

1623
01:59:21,422 --> 01:59:22,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be pretty cool.

1624
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:25,963
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 different games, one Xbox, including Sonic.

1625
01:59:26,323 --> 01:59:27,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a nice game in it.

1626
01:59:27,783 --> 01:59:35,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic Knuckles, Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic and Knuckles, when you put them together, is going to be on there, and a bunch of Game Gear titles.

1627
01:59:35,366 --> 01:59:41,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these other titles that seemingly have nothing to do with Sonic, The Ooze, Comic Zone, Flicky, and Ristar.

1628
01:59:41,788 --> 01:59:44,909
[SPEAKER_05]: You will notice, however, that Sonic CD is not on it.

1629
01:59:45,309 --> 01:59:45,909
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

1630
01:59:46,559 --> 01:59:47,720
[SPEAKER_19]: We need Sonic CD.

1631
01:59:48,301 --> 01:59:49,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's an unlock, you never know.

1632
01:59:50,563 --> 01:59:53,025
[SPEAKER_19]: We need the Japanese version of Sonic CD that has better music.

1633
01:59:53,225 --> 01:59:53,725
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1634
01:59:53,825 --> 01:59:54,446
[SPEAKER_19]: We need Nights.

1635
01:59:54,706 --> 01:59:55,587
[SPEAKER_19]: We need a new Nights game.

1636
01:59:55,947 --> 01:59:56,428
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see.

1637
01:59:56,448 --> 01:59:57,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick.

1638
02:00:00,874 --> 02:00:06,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumor is that we'll get our first glimpse of Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater this October.

1639
02:00:06,301 --> 02:00:08,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be launched in Japan this October is the current rumor.

1640
02:00:09,224 --> 02:00:11,067
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll confirm that for you as soon as we find out.

1641
02:00:11,908 --> 02:00:18,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on the Game Boy Advance, you know those Nintendo games that you're paying 20 bucks for to play the same damn game you played 15 years ago?

1642
02:00:19,557 --> 02:00:21,078
[SPEAKER_05]: There's even more coming out this time.

1643
02:00:21,178 --> 02:00:28,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Mario, Metroid, which seems completely pointless to me because if you want to play the old Metroid, fucking buy Metroid Zero.

1644
02:00:28,824 --> 02:00:34,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Because not only will you get the old Metroid, but you'll get a fucking awesome Metroid game with it based off the old Metroid.

1645
02:00:34,685 --> 02:00:36,687
[SPEAKER_19]: And wasn't there a way you could bring out the Guardian Legend?

1646
02:00:36,907 --> 02:00:44,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't there a way you could supposedly link your Game Boy Advance with, what was it, Metroid Prime?

1647
02:00:44,732 --> 02:00:48,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Prime and Fusion could link together and you could also unlock the original Metroid that way.

1648
02:00:48,915 --> 02:00:51,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will be the third time we've had the original Metroid available.

1649
02:00:52,258 --> 02:00:52,738
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1650
02:00:52,838 --> 02:00:53,919
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past few years, yes.

1651
02:00:54,399 --> 02:00:55,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Guardian Legend.

1652
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:55,820
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, I know.

1653
02:00:55,841 --> 02:00:56,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Guardian Legend.

1654
02:00:56,161 --> 02:00:57,061
[SPEAKER_19]: I tried to get people to vote for it.

1655
02:00:58,162 --> 02:00:59,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I told them Guardian Legend.

1656
02:00:59,203 --> 02:01:00,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are two more that we're going to get.

1657
02:01:00,804 --> 02:01:01,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania!

1658
02:01:01,144 --> 02:01:01,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania!

1659
02:01:03,135 --> 02:01:03,956
[SPEAKER_05]: is coming out.

1660
02:01:04,036 --> 02:01:04,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That is cool.

1661
02:01:04,776 --> 02:01:05,957
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a must-have.

1662
02:01:06,017 --> 02:01:09,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, if you have a PlayStation, you could also just get Castlevania Chronicles.

1663
02:01:10,041 --> 02:01:15,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you could just fucking get Symphony of the Night and get a really good Castlevania game.

1664
02:01:15,665 --> 02:01:17,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing a lot of Aria of Sorrow recently.

1665
02:01:17,947 --> 02:01:21,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Castlevania III was the best of the Nintendo ones, the Japanese one.

1666
02:01:21,830 --> 02:01:26,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been playing a whole lot of new Castlevania games on Game Boy Advance, but I've been playing this Aria of Sorrow a lot.

1667
02:01:26,454 --> 02:01:27,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually really like it.

1668
02:01:27,335 --> 02:01:27,775
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.

1669
02:01:29,409 --> 02:01:31,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Zelda 2, The Adventure of Link.

1670
02:01:31,832 --> 02:01:32,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all knew that was a given.

1671
02:01:33,014 --> 02:01:33,796
[SPEAKER_05]: That would make Dan happy.

1672
02:01:33,816 --> 02:01:34,356
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point.

1673
02:01:35,418 --> 02:01:36,560
[SPEAKER_19]: I could not get into Zelda 2.

1674
02:01:37,561 --> 02:01:38,623
[SPEAKER_19]: But he loves that game.

1675
02:01:39,104 --> 02:01:39,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1676
02:01:40,286 --> 02:01:41,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Also another video game.

1677
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:42,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Loki.

1678
02:01:42,967 --> 02:01:43,047
Hmm.

1679
02:02:10,669 --> 02:02:14,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is also tied in with the Final Fantasy 7 thing, so whatever that is.

1680
02:02:15,531 --> 02:02:20,672
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was rumored that they were going to be making a spin-off with Vincent being the lead.

1681
02:02:21,192 --> 02:02:22,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that would just make me so happy.

1682
02:02:23,393 --> 02:02:26,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Because Vincent was my favorite character in Final Fantasy 7.

1683
02:02:26,994 --> 02:02:34,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so... Like, my last party was Yuffie, Vincent, and of course Cloud, because you couldn't go without him.

1684
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:36,857
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could have ditched Cloud, I would have so fast.

1685
02:02:37,196 --> 02:02:37,676
[SPEAKER_09]: www.adventchildren.net

1686
02:03:02,267 --> 02:03:02,987
[SPEAKER_09]: That is Sid.

1687
02:03:03,687 --> 02:03:04,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, okay?

1688
02:03:05,728 --> 02:03:06,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking at Vincent.

1689
02:03:06,908 --> 02:03:07,448
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Sid.

1690
02:03:07,688 --> 02:03:08,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1691
02:03:08,629 --> 02:03:09,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Kiss my ass.

1692
02:03:09,649 --> 02:03:14,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's another kick-ass one of Sid here hitting God knows what.

1693
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:16,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you could do.

1694
02:03:16,051 --> 02:03:22,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you post this link in our chat room so the chatters can play along and see some of these pictures because they are very nice pictures, I gotta say.

1695
02:03:24,433 --> 02:03:24,713
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1696
02:03:30,095 --> 02:03:31,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other pictures you want to show us in the studio, though?

1697
02:03:35,361 --> 02:03:37,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a really kick-ass one of Vincent!

1698
02:03:39,082 --> 02:03:41,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1699
02:03:44,305 --> 02:03:45,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that is my man.

1700
02:03:45,625 --> 02:03:46,626
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that's pretty sweet.

1701
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:48,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we've got, of course, Return of Red XIII.

1702
02:03:51,008 --> 02:03:55,890
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny is that the whole time I ever played Final Fantasy VII, I never got Vincent.

1703
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:57,590
[SPEAKER_05]: UVS, Vincent, no.

1704
02:03:57,610 --> 02:03:58,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Go figure.

1705
02:03:58,491 --> 02:03:58,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Go figure.

1706
02:03:59,798 --> 02:04:03,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Last call for cage match votes in our chat room, FYI.

1707
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:11,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Also in other video gaming news recently, Metroid Prime will be having a GameCube bundle coming out, of course with the release of Metroid Prime 2 on the way.

1708
02:04:12,126 --> 02:04:15,829
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're thinking about getting a GameCube, now's a good time because Metroid Prime...

1709
02:04:16,289 --> 02:04:21,354
[SPEAKER_05]: will be released with the GameCube, and they'll also have a sneak peek at Metroid Prime 2 Echoes.

1710
02:04:22,736 --> 02:04:28,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there's going to be some new games coming out for the Nintendo DS, which sounds kind of cool.

1711
02:04:29,482 --> 02:04:30,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of games being announced.

1712
02:04:31,064 --> 02:04:32,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to see what Konami's got planned.

1713
02:04:33,266 --> 02:04:37,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami is going to be coming out with a Castlevania game, as well as a game called Boktai?

1714
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:37,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that one.

1715
02:04:38,491 --> 02:04:38,952
[SPEAKER_05]: SONIC DS

1716
02:04:58,201 --> 02:05:02,142
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a Mega Man Battle Network game from Capcom.

1717
02:05:02,962 --> 02:05:05,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the mandatory Bust a Move title.

1718
02:05:06,043 --> 02:05:10,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you must hate that name, but that is what they call it here in the U.S., or Puzzle Bobble, if you must.

1719
02:05:12,244 --> 02:05:16,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And for you, DDR Angel, Monster Rancher.

1720
02:05:16,825 --> 02:05:18,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, not Monster Rancher.

1721
02:05:18,325 --> 02:05:19,105
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm sorry, not that one.

1722
02:05:19,145 --> 02:05:20,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking Harvest Moon.

1723
02:05:20,325 --> 02:05:21,006
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

1724
02:05:21,026 --> 02:05:22,246
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was thinking of, Harvest Moon.

1725
02:05:22,966 --> 02:05:24,926
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a Monster Rancher.

1726
02:05:26,187 --> 02:05:27,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, do you want to know what book that really is?

1727
02:05:27,952 --> 02:05:28,152
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1728
02:05:28,512 --> 02:05:33,774
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a... I want to say it's like a vampire type thing, but like, I don't know, something more cartoony.

1729
02:05:34,274 --> 02:05:37,195
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's got some sun sensor thing or whatever on it.

1730
02:05:37,455 --> 02:05:38,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they have that game here.

1731
02:05:39,095 --> 02:05:41,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget the name of it here, but they do have it here.

1732
02:05:41,616 --> 02:05:42,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought that was Boktai.

1733
02:05:42,636 --> 02:05:43,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, with the sunlight.

1734
02:05:43,416 --> 02:05:44,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was called that.

1735
02:05:44,336 --> 02:05:44,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, sorry, I'll move.

1736
02:05:45,617 --> 02:05:45,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1737
02:05:46,117 --> 02:05:46,437
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1738
02:05:46,757 --> 02:05:47,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost bought that.

1739
02:05:48,838 --> 02:05:52,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost bought that, but I bought Sword of Mana instead, and I wish I'd bought the other game, because I don't like Sword of Mana.

1740
02:05:53,139 --> 02:05:54,959
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Oh, well.

1741
02:05:55,239 --> 02:05:55,780
[SPEAKER_05]: You live, you learn.

1742
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:57,280
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1743
02:05:58,024 --> 02:05:59,925
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for other gaming news tonight.

1744
02:06:00,005 --> 02:06:02,285
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to wrap up the cage match voting.

1745
02:06:02,846 --> 02:06:05,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1746
02:06:06,107 --> 02:06:06,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, Rob.

1747
02:06:06,907 --> 02:06:07,247
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1748
02:06:07,347 --> 02:06:13,089
[SPEAKER_05]: By one stinking vote, one vote, we have a new champion.

1749
02:06:13,109 --> 02:06:18,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Nuon is tonight's winner by one vote over Astro Sexy.

1750
02:06:19,251 --> 02:06:21,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Who says every vote doesn't count, boys and girls?

1751
02:06:23,572 --> 02:06:25,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Astro Sexy was guaranteed to win again.

1752
02:06:26,733 --> 02:06:33,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because the other... You know, if the one person that voted for California Dreamin' would have voted for the other song, it could have been different, but... The one person?

1753
02:06:33,196 --> 02:06:35,396
[SPEAKER_05]: The one person that voted for California Dreamin'.

1754
02:06:37,057 --> 02:06:37,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.

1755
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:44,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm not going to say every vote is cast in secret, but if you want to... If you want to out yourself on air, go ahead.

1756
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:45,841
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1757
02:06:46,101 --> 02:06:47,681
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll just pick another Inflow song next week.

1758
02:06:47,941 --> 02:06:49,602
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1759
02:06:49,622 --> 02:06:50,402
[SPEAKER_19]: Or better watch it.

1760
02:06:50,602 --> 02:06:51,643
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll pick Toxic.

1761
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:54,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost put Toxic in tonight.

1762
02:06:54,231 --> 02:06:55,491
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll make you guys listen to Britney.

1763
02:06:55,932 --> 02:06:57,672
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are getting Danny Minow again next week.

1764
02:06:57,712 --> 02:06:59,273
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say.

1765
02:06:59,373 --> 02:07:00,054
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, okay.

1766
02:07:00,234 --> 02:07:01,795
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to torture you guys that badly.

1767
02:07:01,995 --> 02:07:02,815
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll pick some inflow.

1768
02:07:03,075 --> 02:07:03,395
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1769
02:07:05,176 --> 02:07:06,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to go to a break.

1770
02:07:07,417 --> 02:07:08,558
[SPEAKER_05]: What should we hear in this break?

1771
02:07:08,858 --> 02:07:09,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1772
02:07:09,398 --> 02:07:11,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody give me an idea for a theme for this break.

1773
02:07:11,179 --> 02:07:11,359
[SPEAKER_19]: Taku.

1774
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:12,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Some Taku?

1775
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:13,240
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1776
02:07:13,701 --> 02:07:14,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Some Tako?

1777
02:07:14,841 --> 02:07:15,041
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1778
02:07:15,581 --> 02:07:16,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Play Thrashtrax.

1779
02:07:17,242 --> 02:07:17,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

1780
02:07:17,983 --> 02:07:18,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Taku?

1781
02:07:19,003 --> 02:07:19,183
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1782
02:07:19,383 --> 02:07:19,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Was it really?

1783
02:07:20,304 --> 02:07:22,425
[SPEAKER_19]: Thrashtrax and Tetraku.

1784
02:07:22,853 --> 02:07:23,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

1785
02:07:24,776 --> 02:07:26,218
[SPEAKER_19]: I want old Taku stuff.

1786
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:33,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll hear some of that, and then we'll be back, and we're going to do tonight's episode of Listless.

1787
02:07:33,648 --> 02:07:35,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember, we're still looking for your ideas from the chat room.

1788
02:07:36,551 --> 02:07:39,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I toy game I'd most like to see in DDR.

1789
02:07:39,936 --> 02:07:40,397
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

1790
02:09:08,089 --> 02:09:08,249
and more.

1791
02:09:42,170 --> 02:09:42,831
Thanks for watching!

1792
02:12:44,813 --> 02:12:48,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1793
02:12:48,635 --> 02:12:50,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1794
02:12:50,897 --> 02:12:55,440
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back, and as promised, we're going to get into tonight's edition of Listless.

1795
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:57,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need a theme song for Listless.

1796
02:12:57,561 --> 02:12:59,862
[SPEAKER_05]: What's a good Bomani song that's like a theme song for Listless?

1797
02:13:00,563 --> 02:13:01,523
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Holic.

1798
02:13:02,624 --> 02:13:04,105
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do Holic again.

1799
02:13:04,965 --> 02:13:09,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I know the one that was the poppin' music video.

1800
02:13:10,609 --> 02:13:11,710
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds very game show-y.

1801
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:13,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Linus.

1802
02:13:13,531 --> 02:13:13,791
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1803
02:13:13,811 --> 02:13:13,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1804
02:13:14,712 --> 02:13:16,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, shit, do I have Linus?

1805
02:13:17,093 --> 02:13:20,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have that song readily available to me, um, oh!

1806
02:13:20,574 --> 02:13:25,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought, ooh, let's see if I can find, oh, damn, all my poppin' music special stuff is gone.

1807
02:13:26,316 --> 02:13:31,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know a good one, I know a good, because you said poppin' music, that made me think of a poppin' music song that would be really good, if I can find it.

1808
02:13:32,658 --> 02:13:33,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, crap, oh, here it is, here it is.

1809
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:37,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's that, it's that, um, that toy-sounding song from Nine.

1810
02:13:41,482 --> 02:13:43,425
[SPEAKER_12]: It's time to play Listless!

1811
02:13:47,119 --> 02:13:49,080
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't fire a rod, you're not on the cast.

1812
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:52,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not on staff, you can't fire a rod.

1813
02:13:52,341 --> 02:13:59,823
[SPEAKER_12]: In tonight's edition of Listless, we will be determining the eye toy game we most want to see in a DDR game.

1814
02:14:00,304 --> 02:14:09,287
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that Listless works is that each host and each guest will make their list of three games that they want to see in an eye toy DDR.

1815
02:14:09,787 --> 02:14:15,989
[SPEAKER_05]: After that, we will have the elimination round, where each person will take one thing off of the list.

1816
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:20,092
[SPEAKER_05]: After that, the chatroom will be able to vote!

1817
02:14:20,432 --> 02:14:23,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're not in the chatroom, join it now!

1819
02:14:28,917 --> 02:14:32,019
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, let's play Listless!

1820
02:14:36,302 --> 02:14:38,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob, you've scared me.

1821
02:14:39,644 --> 02:14:41,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Beyond all capacity to be scared!

1822
02:14:43,326 --> 02:14:44,847
[SPEAKER_19]: Except there's no slugs involved.

1823
02:14:45,307 --> 02:14:46,828
[SPEAKER_19]: If there were slugs involved, I'd be even more scared.

1824
02:14:47,139 --> 02:14:50,200
[SPEAKER_05]: In all seriousness, let's get to tonight's list.

1825
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:51,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's see.

1826
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:53,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Eye toy game I most want to see in DDR.

1827
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:56,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting off tonight, who always starts us off?

1828
02:14:56,081 --> 02:14:57,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The lovely DarkSakura.

1829
02:14:58,102 --> 02:14:59,062
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn straight I'm lovely.

1830
02:14:59,082 --> 02:14:59,962
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a trendsetter.

1831
02:15:00,462 --> 02:15:01,002
[SPEAKER_19]: I sure am.

1832
02:15:01,082 --> 02:15:03,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three eye toy game you most want to see in DDR.

1833
02:15:04,503 --> 02:15:05,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Car wash the game.

1834
02:15:08,724 --> 02:15:10,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Car wash the game.

1835
02:15:10,085 --> 02:15:11,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Explain how this works.

1836
02:15:13,065 --> 02:15:15,226
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd have your buckets on the ground and one would be your...

1837
02:15:16,232 --> 02:15:22,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Your, uh, you know, sponge, and you'd wash the car, and then you'd have the hose, and you'd spray down the car.

1838
02:15:22,354 --> 02:15:25,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, would this actually relate to DDR at all?

1839
02:15:25,235 --> 02:15:25,395
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1840
02:15:26,656 --> 02:15:27,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

1841
02:15:27,456 --> 02:15:29,137
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you'll play Eurobeat while you do it?

1842
02:15:29,237 --> 02:15:29,497
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1843
02:15:29,617 --> 02:15:30,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you go.

1844
02:15:30,557 --> 02:15:32,878
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, I know, better yet, how about Bikini Car Wash the game?

1845
02:15:33,198 --> 02:15:33,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1846
02:15:33,859 --> 02:15:40,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Then, like, your icon, you just, like, you know, and so, like, the better you do, the hotter you are, and the more tips you get.

1847
02:15:40,321 --> 02:15:41,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Bikini Car Wash the game.

1848
02:15:41,862 --> 02:15:42,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

1849
02:15:42,242 --> 02:15:42,542
[SPEAKER_19]: That works.

1850
02:15:42,702 --> 02:15:43,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll change it there, alright.

1851
02:15:43,662 --> 02:15:46,003
[SPEAKER_19]: And if it's a guy, then it's Speedo Car Wash.

1852
02:15:46,164 --> 02:15:47,724
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I was thinking the movie Car Wash.

1853
02:15:48,084 --> 02:15:50,765
[SPEAKER_19]: At the car wash, yeah!

1854
02:15:51,066 --> 02:15:52,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that could be playing in the background.

1855
02:15:52,766 --> 02:15:53,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Angel.

1856
02:15:55,488 --> 02:15:58,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, then let's go to Arcadian42, since Angel's working here.

1857
02:15:58,269 --> 02:16:02,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian42, number three eye toy game you would most like to see in DDR.

1858
02:16:02,531 --> 02:16:05,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I just made a comment about that Car Wash.

1859
02:16:05,192 --> 02:16:07,753
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as no one's carrying around a bucket of piss.

1860
02:16:09,413 --> 02:16:09,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay!

1861
02:16:11,431 --> 02:16:11,812
[SPEAKER_10]: 3.

1862
02:16:11,471 --> 02:16:11,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Lice Invaders

1863
02:16:25,663 --> 02:16:28,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch out, they're coming down from the sky to attack your head.

1864
02:16:29,304 --> 02:16:31,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Lice, Lice Invaders.

1865
02:16:32,124 --> 02:16:33,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Lice Invaders.

1866
02:16:34,065 --> 02:16:38,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And to relate this to DDR, Lice Invaders would also play Eurobeat in the background, correct?

1867
02:16:39,326 --> 02:16:39,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

1868
02:16:39,786 --> 02:16:40,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright, fine.

1869
02:16:40,866 --> 02:16:42,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Lice Invaders.

1870
02:16:44,627 --> 02:16:45,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DDR Angel.

1871
02:16:46,347 --> 02:16:49,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three eye toy game you would most like to see in DDR?

1872
02:16:49,668 --> 02:16:53,589
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't really come up with anything for number three, so I just said Mini Papa Music or Mini 2DX.

1873
02:16:54,150 --> 02:16:56,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a mini, like a chibi 2DX.

1874
02:16:56,212 --> 02:16:56,812
[SPEAKER_05]: How about I say that?

1875
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:57,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Chibi 2DX.

1876
02:16:57,553 --> 02:17:03,457
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, because I couldn't come up with anything else original.

1877
02:17:03,857 --> 02:17:04,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's fine, that's fine.

1878
02:17:04,958 --> 02:17:05,718
[SPEAKER_05]: A little chibi game.

1879
02:17:05,778 --> 02:17:06,299
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be cute.

1880
02:17:06,399 --> 02:17:13,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki, your number three pick for a high toy game I would most like to see in DDR.

1881
02:17:14,104 --> 02:17:15,445
[SPEAKER_05]: My game is so awesome.

1882
02:17:19,088 --> 02:17:20,289
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Break Shit.

1883
02:17:25,751 --> 02:17:31,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, um... You are so bad in the face.

1884
02:17:32,077 --> 02:17:34,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1885
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:35,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn this yogurt!

1886
02:17:36,522 --> 02:17:39,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, um, no, basically... Is your yogurt that hot?

1887
02:17:40,105 --> 02:17:40,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

1888
02:17:40,726 --> 02:17:41,566
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me giggle.

1889
02:17:42,067 --> 02:17:46,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, um, no, basically what you do is an object would come on the screen.

1890
02:17:48,055 --> 02:17:51,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're breaking!

1891
02:17:51,716 --> 02:17:53,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki's suggesting break shit.

1892
02:17:54,237 --> 02:17:57,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the iToy game he would most like to see in DDR.

1893
02:17:57,518 --> 02:18:01,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and again, to relate this to DDR, Eurobeat Music would be playing in the background.

1894
02:18:01,919 --> 02:18:03,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, she breaks shit.

1895
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:05,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Daikin Kai.

1896
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:11,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, my number three game I would most like to see, iToy game I would most like to see in DDR, Whack-A-Child.

1897
02:18:13,242 --> 02:18:14,843
[SPEAKER_19]: That sounds brilliant.

1898
02:18:16,989 --> 02:18:17,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Whack a child.

1899
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:23,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, as you play DDR, little children come on the screen and you have to whack them away.

1900
02:18:23,593 --> 02:18:25,754
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would be my... Do you have the big orange bat icon?

1901
02:18:26,294 --> 02:18:26,714
[SPEAKER_05]: You could.

1902
02:18:26,754 --> 02:18:27,935
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be like the bonus stage.

1903
02:18:28,075 --> 02:18:28,315
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1904
02:18:28,615 --> 02:18:28,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1905
02:18:30,456 --> 02:18:33,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two pick now from Jamie.

1906
02:18:34,118 --> 02:18:36,379
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be something like the candy bar doll maker.

1907
02:18:36,399 --> 02:18:38,680
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you've seen all the dolls I've been posting in my live journal.

1908
02:18:39,181 --> 02:18:39,421
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1909
02:18:39,841 --> 02:18:44,904
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, well, I've been having this thing with the candy bar doll maker and this is...

1910
02:18:46,129 --> 02:18:50,812
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like an interactive thing where you make the outfits and choose the hair and everything.

1911
02:18:51,112 --> 02:18:59,257
[SPEAKER_19]: But you could use it to... If you want to see what the original candy bar was, it's candybar.co.kr.

1912
02:19:00,058 --> 02:19:03,020
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's also an English one if you look it up on Google.

1913
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:07,363
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyway, you use the doll maker and you make your character for DDR.

1914
02:19:07,783 --> 02:19:09,524
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you play as that character.

1915
02:19:10,489 --> 02:19:14,890
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can drag the hair over and make him a boy or make him a girl.

1916
02:19:14,910 --> 02:19:17,091
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the gayest game I've ever heard of, but all right, fine.

1917
02:19:17,131 --> 02:19:21,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Candy bar doll game is what... And Eurobeat would play in the background while you do it.

1918
02:19:21,732 --> 02:19:22,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Nope.

1919
02:19:22,593 --> 02:19:22,873
[SPEAKER_19]: Nope.

1920
02:19:23,233 --> 02:19:24,753
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be like the Oha music.

1921
02:19:24,873 --> 02:19:25,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the Oha music.

1922
02:19:26,214 --> 02:19:26,514
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1923
02:19:27,534 --> 02:19:29,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian42, your number two pick.

1924
02:19:30,935 --> 02:19:34,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Originally, I came up with the idea of head explode mode.

1925
02:19:35,076 --> 02:19:36,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Or head explode mode, if you want to.

1926
02:19:38,018 --> 02:19:41,219
[SPEAKER_10]: But I thought it'd maybe make it cooler, be the Evade the Assassin's Bullet game.

1927
02:19:41,539 --> 02:19:43,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Where you see the red dot on your head, you have to avoid it.

1928
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:53,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Evade the Assassin's Bullet game, so a little red laser would appear on your head.

1929
02:19:54,042 --> 02:19:54,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1930
02:19:54,982 --> 02:19:59,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't move out of the way, then boom, your head explodes.

1931
02:19:59,503 --> 02:20:02,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it actually explodes, that would make it a little bit more dangerous, and maybe a bit more fun.

1932
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:06,222
[SPEAKER_19]: It would work for Kami in Silent Scope mode.

1933
02:20:06,422 --> 02:20:07,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, there you go, Silent Scope mode.

1934
02:20:07,964 --> 02:20:08,945
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go, Silent Scope mode.

1935
02:20:09,185 --> 02:20:10,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, brilliant.

1936
02:20:10,406 --> 02:20:10,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

1937
02:20:10,786 --> 02:20:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to put that in parentheses, Silent Scope.

1938
02:20:15,471 --> 02:20:15,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1939
02:20:17,793 --> 02:20:19,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, your number two pick.

1940
02:20:20,055 --> 02:20:20,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

1941
02:20:21,957 --> 02:20:23,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, hell.

1942
02:20:23,979 --> 02:20:26,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, how about Mini Flashwater?

1943
02:20:27,462 --> 02:20:29,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you remember that game from Mario Paint?

1944
02:20:30,427 --> 02:20:33,588
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing where you just take the mouse and then like swaddle the flies and crap?

1945
02:20:33,728 --> 02:20:35,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Mini fly, so the fly swatting game.

1946
02:20:36,189 --> 02:20:38,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Nat Attack, that's what it was called, Nat Attack.

1947
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:40,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I don't know, I just thought maybe that'd be kind of cool.

1948
02:20:41,811 --> 02:20:43,151
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not funny tonight, oh well.

1949
02:20:43,491 --> 02:20:45,692
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright, we're going to need some serious ones in here anyway.

1950
02:20:46,032 --> 02:20:50,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki, your number two pick for eye toy game that you would like to see in DDR.

1951
02:20:51,934 --> 02:20:55,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at your list tonight because I can see your list over...

1952
02:20:55,879 --> 02:20:58,560
[SPEAKER_05]: on your computer, and I can't help it, because it's funny.

1953
02:21:00,101 --> 02:21:00,381
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1954
02:21:00,481 --> 02:21:01,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Answer the damn question.

1955
02:21:01,301 --> 02:21:02,062
[SPEAKER_05]: You're number two pick.

1956
02:21:02,522 --> 02:21:03,282
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't.

1957
02:21:03,703 --> 02:21:04,643
[SPEAKER_12]: He's laughing to her.

1958
02:21:04,683 --> 02:21:05,223
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny.

1959
02:21:06,204 --> 02:21:06,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Say it.

1960
02:21:07,544 --> 02:21:08,185
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1961
02:21:10,466 --> 02:21:11,506
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all your damn fault.

1962
02:21:11,986 --> 02:21:14,387
[SPEAKER_08]: See, he starts giggling, and then I can't.

1963
02:21:14,547 --> 02:21:16,068
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, here's some serious thoughts.

1964
02:21:16,108 --> 02:21:16,948
[SPEAKER_19]: Things that you like.

1965
02:21:17,589 --> 02:21:17,949
[SPEAKER_19]: You know.

1966
02:21:19,089 --> 02:21:19,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1967
02:21:19,710 --> 02:21:21,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Shooting RBGL children in the head.

1968
02:21:21,651 --> 02:21:21,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Shh.

1969
02:21:24,522 --> 02:21:27,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, my next one is awesome.

1970
02:21:27,743 --> 02:21:29,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, I'm itchy.

1971
02:21:29,184 --> 02:21:35,726
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like a personal problem.

1972
02:21:37,447 --> 02:21:38,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

1973
02:21:39,127 --> 02:21:41,888
[SPEAKER_09]: You see this spot on your body, it gets red, itch it.

1974
02:21:43,029 --> 02:21:44,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have jock itch?

1975
02:21:46,028 --> 02:21:48,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Itchy is Loki's number two pick.

1976
02:21:49,049 --> 02:21:57,831
[SPEAKER_05]: My number two pick, if Whack-A-Child wasn't quite good enough for you, then we have Whack-A-Parent would be the iToy game I would like to see.

1977
02:21:57,911 --> 02:22:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Whack-A-Parent, because we all know that it's not really the kids' fault, it's their parents.

1978
02:22:03,293 --> 02:22:05,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So Whack-A-Parent is my number two pick.

1979
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:07,021
[SPEAKER_19]: I would so own it at.

1980
02:22:07,621 --> 02:22:07,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1981
02:22:09,462 --> 02:22:11,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Jamie, you're number two.

1982
02:22:11,804 --> 02:22:12,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you're number one.

1983
02:22:13,865 --> 02:22:19,909
[SPEAKER_19]: My last one, the thing is, I don't, it would require that you be able to play with two eye toys, honestly.

1984
02:22:20,089 --> 02:22:21,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's fine, you're innovative.

1985
02:22:21,630 --> 02:22:21,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1986
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:25,852
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be called, fuck with the other player's arrows mode.

1987
02:22:28,706 --> 02:22:31,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Where you would basically reach over on their side.

1988
02:22:31,388 --> 02:22:35,851
[SPEAKER_05]: You would actually reach over and rearrange their arrows.

1989
02:22:36,292 --> 02:22:36,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

1990
02:22:38,253 --> 02:22:39,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I like that idea.

1991
02:22:39,694 --> 02:22:41,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously, think about how crazy that would be.

1992
02:22:41,596 --> 02:22:43,978
[SPEAKER_19]: That would, like, do a whole new spin on Dance Battle.

1993
02:22:44,818 --> 02:22:47,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you just, like, knock all your own arrows off the screen?

1994
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:48,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you could do that.

1995
02:22:48,981 --> 02:22:50,703
[SPEAKER_17]: You could shove your arrows over to their side.

1996
02:22:51,303 --> 02:22:51,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1997
02:22:52,004 --> 02:22:53,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, that reminds me of...

1998
02:22:54,144 --> 02:23:05,891
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if anybody played You Don't Know Jack, but Volume 4 has this mode where it's nail mode where you just pound the N key and all these nails go on the question so you can't read it and the person has to guess.

1999
02:23:06,311 --> 02:23:07,271
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like forced to guess.

2000
02:23:07,332 --> 02:23:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2001
02:23:09,453 --> 02:23:15,516
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get the mic on over to Arcadium42 for his number one pick for iToy game I would most like to see in DDR.

2002
02:23:16,497 --> 02:23:16,837
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2003
02:23:19,056 --> 02:23:21,621
[SPEAKER_10]: My number one pick will be Dandruff White Christmas.

2004
02:23:21,941 --> 02:23:26,390
[SPEAKER_10]: There would be little people on the bottom of the screen, and they're so wishing for a white Christmas.

2005
02:23:26,795 --> 02:23:37,242
[SPEAKER_10]: and you are the number one producer of Dandruff and you are going to give them a nice white Christmas by shaking your head in various directions to make sure they have a beautiful, beautiful Christmas.

2006
02:23:37,342 --> 02:23:40,704
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of DDR players I know wouldn't need an eye toy actually for this.

2007
02:23:40,784 --> 02:23:41,264
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

2008
02:23:41,565 --> 02:23:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2009
02:23:42,705 --> 02:23:44,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Dandruff white Christmas mode.

2010
02:23:44,326 --> 02:23:45,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

2011
02:23:45,207 --> 02:23:47,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2012
02:23:47,708 --> 02:23:49,510
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Angel, your number one pick.

2013
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:52,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I'm going to be completely kidding and go with the mini butt game.

2014
02:23:53,332 --> 02:23:53,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Darn it.

2015
02:23:53,852 --> 02:23:54,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Laugh.

2016
02:23:54,533 --> 02:23:55,573
[SPEAKER_05]: The mini butt game?

2017
02:23:55,614 --> 02:23:56,234
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that work?

2018
02:23:57,525 --> 02:24:00,366
[SPEAKER_17]: The WarioWare thing, remember?

2019
02:24:00,426 --> 02:24:02,407
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to explain for those that don't know, though, our listeners.

2020
02:24:02,427 --> 02:24:07,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, well, okay, well, I wasn't, I was actually kidding about this answer, but I guess I'll keep it.

2021
02:24:07,068 --> 02:24:07,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you didn't keep it?

2022
02:24:08,569 --> 02:24:10,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll explain for those.

2023
02:24:10,429 --> 02:24:18,912
[SPEAKER_05]: In WarioWare, there's this game where it says shoot, and you have to shoot water on this flower to make it spin, but the flower looks like an asshole.

2024
02:24:21,561 --> 02:24:27,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like this moving bidet that you're using to shoot water up somebody's asshole.

2025
02:24:27,447 --> 02:24:28,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to know my real answer?

2026
02:24:28,628 --> 02:24:31,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So Angel wants to turn this into an eye toy game.

2027
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:32,111
[SPEAKER_05]: What was your real answer?

2028
02:24:32,231 --> 02:24:36,095
[SPEAKER_17]: My real answer was going to be Mini Burger Time, but I don't know if that was going to work.

2029
02:24:36,155 --> 02:24:37,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I like the mini butt game.

2030
02:24:38,878 --> 02:24:42,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to actually change that to Mini Water in Your Asshole.

2031
02:24:47,415 --> 02:24:51,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so this is a mini water in your asshole.

2032
02:24:53,617 --> 02:24:55,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, how old are we, people?

2033
02:25:05,261 --> 02:25:06,041
Oh shit!

2034
02:25:06,601 --> 02:25:09,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Roth is all red in the face now, this has got to be good.

2035
02:25:09,282 --> 02:25:10,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh god, I love this.

2036
02:25:10,502 --> 02:25:11,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Here, take the mic.

2037
02:25:15,390 --> 02:25:16,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, I'll do it, I'll do it.

2038
02:25:17,831 --> 02:25:19,972
[SPEAKER_12]: No, make, no, make, make him do it.

2039
02:25:20,492 --> 02:25:23,494
[SPEAKER_19]: Make him do it.

2040
02:25:24,554 --> 02:25:25,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Make him say it.

2041
02:25:25,715 --> 02:25:26,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Come here.

2042
02:25:27,256 --> 02:25:27,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Come here.

2043
02:25:28,376 --> 02:25:28,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Come here.

2044
02:25:29,277 --> 02:25:29,697
[SPEAKER_19]: It's okay.

2045
02:25:30,377 --> 02:25:30,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Deep breaths.

2046
02:25:34,439 --> 02:25:34,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

2047
02:25:34,979 --> 02:25:35,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the next one.

2048
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:38,401
[SPEAKER_09]: And my final one, number one.

2049
02:25:38,861 --> 02:25:40,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I have plenty more where this came from, too.

2050
02:25:40,742 --> 02:25:41,402
[SPEAKER_09]: This just happened to me.

2051
02:25:41,422 --> 02:25:41,683
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2052
02:25:41,723 --> 02:25:42,603
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes to my head right now.

2053
02:25:43,743 --> 02:25:44,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I pulled it out of my ass.

2054
02:25:45,428 --> 02:25:47,832
[SPEAKER_09]: This next one is basically like a quiz show game.

2055
02:25:49,053 --> 02:25:53,239
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like You Don't Know Jack, where you get like three questions.

2056
02:25:55,262 --> 02:25:57,425
[SPEAKER_09]: And the problem will be that they're very hard.

2057
02:25:59,147 --> 02:26:02,232
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if you get the question wrong...

2058
02:26:02,924 --> 02:26:03,744
[SPEAKER_09]: You catch fire.

2059
02:26:06,366 --> 02:26:08,547
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called answer question or catch fire.

2060
02:26:10,948 --> 02:26:18,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't flare around too much because otherwise fire burns faster when you're moving.

2061
02:26:23,024 --> 02:26:26,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Answer question or catch fire is Loki's choice.

2062
02:26:27,211 --> 02:26:32,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't flail around too much because the fire just grows that way.

2063
02:26:34,221 --> 02:26:34,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2064
02:26:39,577 --> 02:26:41,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Loki's saying Burn Victim, the game.

2065
02:26:41,477 --> 02:26:42,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, too late.

2066
02:26:42,598 --> 02:26:44,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Answer Question or Catch Fire.

2067
02:26:45,458 --> 02:26:49,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and again, to relate this to DDR, Eurobeat Music would play in the background.

2068
02:26:49,679 --> 02:26:50,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I should play.

2069
02:26:50,459 --> 02:26:50,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2070
02:26:52,259 --> 02:27:04,682
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one pick for iToy game I would like to see in DDR, you've seen Whack-A-Child, you've seen Whack-A-Parent, but the best one by far is Whack-A-Politary is my number one choice.

2071
02:27:04,702 --> 02:27:05,502
[SPEAKER_19]: Whack-A-Politary.

2072
02:27:07,682 --> 02:27:08,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Wacka Politary.

2073
02:27:09,223 --> 02:27:11,225
[SPEAKER_19]: Can't you just do that in, like, Tribuners Club?

2074
02:27:11,446 --> 02:27:13,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but that's a little different.

2075
02:27:13,207 --> 02:27:15,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Politary would come out on the screen.

2076
02:27:15,269 --> 02:27:22,155
[SPEAKER_05]: She would actually sing Broken My Heart, and you can punch her in the stomach to get her to stop.

2077
02:27:25,928 --> 02:27:28,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so that's my number one answer, Wackapolitary.

2078
02:27:28,689 --> 02:27:35,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now unfortunately comes the part where we have to eliminate one off the list apiece.

2079
02:27:35,812 --> 02:27:38,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So, right now, here is the list as it stands.

2080
02:27:38,393 --> 02:27:39,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to read this, Jamie?

2081
02:27:40,433 --> 02:27:41,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you read it from back there?

2082
02:27:41,274 --> 02:27:41,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2083
02:27:41,794 --> 02:27:42,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2084
02:27:42,334 --> 02:27:53,398
[SPEAKER_19]: Bikini Car Wash the Game, Life Invaders, Chibi 2D Extra Poppin' Music, Break Shit, Wacka Child, Candy Bar Doll Game,

2085
02:27:54,348 --> 02:28:12,025
[SPEAKER_19]: Evade the Assassin's Bullet Silent Scope, Mini Flyswatter Nat Attack, I'm Itchy, Whack a Parent, Fuck with the Other Player's Arrows, Dandruff White Christmas, Mini Water in Your Ass all day.

2086
02:28:13,086 --> 02:28:15,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop that, you're just trying to make me bust up, okay?

2087
02:28:17,327 --> 02:28:20,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Answer Question or Catch Fire, or Whack-A-Politary.

2088
02:28:21,008 --> 02:28:21,388
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

2089
02:28:21,448 --> 02:28:24,588
[SPEAKER_19]: I should have read it like in that Margaret Cho, since we're talking about Margaret Cho in the chat room.

2090
02:28:24,608 --> 02:28:26,529
[SPEAKER_19]: I should have done, God, I've been clitoris.

2091
02:28:27,309 --> 02:28:27,569
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2092
02:28:27,849 --> 02:28:28,469
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hard.

2093
02:28:28,609 --> 02:28:30,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, these are all really good.

2094
02:28:30,389 --> 02:28:30,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my pick.

2095
02:28:30,769 --> 02:28:35,070
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very difficult elimination round for us because there's a lot of these that are fucking funny.

2096
02:28:35,250 --> 02:28:35,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Angel?

2097
02:28:35,810 --> 02:28:39,951
[SPEAKER_17]: One comment about the whole thing is, oh, my God, it's iToyMeetsWarriorWare.

2098
02:28:40,231 --> 02:28:41,251
[SPEAKER_05]: iToyMeetsWarriorWare.

2099
02:28:41,631 --> 02:28:41,991
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2100
02:28:42,971 --> 02:28:44,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you've got to take one off the list.

2101
02:28:44,912 --> 02:28:45,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Which number is coming off?

2102
02:28:46,748 --> 02:28:48,089
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, Dandruff White Christmas goes.

2103
02:28:48,449 --> 02:28:50,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Dandruff White Christmas, number 12.

2104
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:51,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Dandruff is nasty.

2105
02:28:52,271 --> 02:28:53,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's too bad.

2106
02:28:54,032 --> 02:28:54,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2107
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:55,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Fired!

2108
02:28:55,973 --> 02:28:57,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Arcadian, your turn.

2109
02:28:57,354 --> 02:28:58,594
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta take one off the list.

2110
02:28:59,095 --> 02:29:00,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I see I have too many whack things to say.

2111
02:29:00,775 --> 02:29:01,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Whack a parent.

2112
02:29:02,016 --> 02:29:02,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more fun to whack kids.

2113
02:29:04,117 --> 02:29:08,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, because it's more fun to whack kids than whack parents, whack a parent is coming off the list.

2114
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:09,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2115
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:11,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, one of these has to come off the list.

2116
02:29:16,601 --> 02:29:20,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I don't know.

2117
02:29:21,404 --> 02:29:22,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Candy Bar Doll Game.

2118
02:29:23,946 --> 02:29:25,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Candy Bar Doll Game.

2119
02:29:25,086 --> 02:29:27,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a little gay, Jamie, even you have to admit.

2120
02:29:28,088 --> 02:29:28,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2121
02:29:29,649 --> 02:29:30,109
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2122
02:29:30,849 --> 02:29:32,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, which one of these is coming off the list?

2123
02:29:35,732 --> 02:29:42,016
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as much as I don't like her, Wackapolitary, because Wacka Child is the best.

2124
02:29:44,702 --> 02:29:45,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Wacka Child is pretty.

2125
02:29:45,983 --> 02:29:48,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Wackapolitary comes off the list, that's fine.

2126
02:29:49,345 --> 02:29:56,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, I have to take one off the list, and I've got to say, I'm just not feeling it for Chibi 2DX.

2127
02:29:56,629 --> 02:29:57,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2128
02:29:57,630 --> 02:29:58,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Angel.

2129
02:29:58,310 --> 02:30:00,392
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, why have a Bimani-related game in VR?

2130
02:30:00,412 --> 02:30:02,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, why have a Bimani-related game in VR?

2131
02:30:02,373 --> 02:30:04,194
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I couldn't think of anything!

2132
02:30:04,354 --> 02:30:04,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2133
02:30:05,295 --> 02:30:06,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine, it's fine.

2134
02:30:07,716 --> 02:30:10,818
[SPEAKER_19]: You could just use the Loki method and just pull it out of your ass.

2135
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:13,520
[SPEAKER_19]: Ow.

2136
02:30:13,540 --> 02:30:13,580
[SPEAKER_19]: Ow.

2137
02:30:15,723 --> 02:30:16,905
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you say?

2138
02:30:17,245 --> 02:30:18,407
[SPEAKER_12]: What were you going to do?

2139
02:30:18,547 --> 02:30:18,848
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

2140
02:30:19,168 --> 02:30:20,730
[SPEAKER_19]: We are not putting that on the air.

2141
02:30:20,951 --> 02:30:22,272
[SPEAKER_19]: We are not putting that on the air.

2142
02:30:22,413 --> 02:30:23,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, damn.

2143
02:30:24,135 --> 02:30:32,687
[SPEAKER_19]: See, that's why you people need to be in the studio to hear all of the really socially incorrect, politically incorrect statements that Loki makes when you can't hear him.

2144
02:30:32,947 --> 02:30:33,508
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.

2145
02:30:33,808 --> 02:30:34,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

2146
02:30:34,148 --> 02:30:36,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Eye toy game I most want to see in DDR.

2147
02:30:36,331 --> 02:30:39,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is the list that you can vote for now in the chat.

2148
02:30:39,414 --> 02:30:45,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Send one vote, your favorite, over to Sky via private message.

2149
02:30:45,521 --> 02:30:45,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

2150

[SPEAKER_05]: Whack A Child 7.

2155
02:30:56,071 --> 02:30:59,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Evade The Assassin's Bullet 8.

2156
02:30:59,914 --> 02:31:01,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Mini Flyswatter 9.

2157
02:31:02,756 --> 02:31:03,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Itchy 11.

2158
02:31:04,878 --> 02:31:06,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck With The Other Player's Arrows 13.

2159
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:10,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Mini Water In Your Asshole Game 14.

2160
02:31:10,682 --> 02:31:12,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Answer Question Or Catch Fire

2161
02:31:13,837 --> 02:31:15,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Place vote now.

2162
02:31:16,399 --> 02:31:24,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your choice for what you would like to see win tonight's listless segment.

2163
02:31:24,244 --> 02:31:30,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll put that all together and we'll put that out on the air as soon as we have everybody's vote.

2164
02:31:32,557 --> 02:31:33,438
[SPEAKER_05]: You got some other ones.

2165
02:31:33,478 --> 02:31:33,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Loki.

2166
02:31:34,460 --> 02:31:35,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a crappy raver mode.

2167
02:31:36,883 --> 02:31:38,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, crappy raver mode would be fun.

2168
02:31:38,885 --> 02:31:43,031
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know what my original number one was?

2169
02:31:43,071 --> 02:31:44,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Interactive gal panic.

2170
02:31:47,256 --> 02:31:49,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Dangle baby over balcony mode.

2171
02:31:51,934 --> 02:31:54,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to open up the Skype line right now.

2172
02:31:54,476 --> 02:32:01,261
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody would like to send... Even though your suggestion is a little late to make the list, maybe there's something you want to vote for.

2173
02:32:01,322 --> 02:32:03,803
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to persuade other people to vote on the list.

2174
02:32:03,844 --> 02:32:10,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe you have a suggestion that was just really good and we missed it and that's just too damn bad because, you know, you don't make the list.

2175
02:32:10,389 --> 02:32:12,170
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Skype line is open right now.

2176
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:14,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if anybody gives us a call.

2177
02:32:14,892 --> 02:32:17,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I guess we're just going to have to go to a break, aren't we?

2178
02:32:18,135 --> 02:32:19,256
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my ever...

2179
02:32:20,757 --> 02:32:22,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Sky, this is John Fields, can you hear me?

2180
02:32:22,418 --> 02:32:22,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi!

2181
02:32:36,914 --> 02:32:40,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I posted this a couple of times in the chat, but I guess you didn't see it.

2182
02:32:41,036 --> 02:32:44,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we were too busy laughing at answer question or catch fire.

2183
02:32:44,058 --> 02:32:44,798
[SPEAKER_16]: They were all red in the face.

2184
02:32:44,858 --> 02:32:45,398
[SPEAKER_16]: It was cute.

2185
02:32:46,419 --> 02:32:54,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I was thinking you could combine the DDR pad with the eye toy to create something sort of like a samurai game.

2186
02:32:54,983 --> 02:32:57,724
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying... We're having a hard time hearing you.

2187
02:32:57,744 --> 02:33:00,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say that he's saying something about you could combine the DDR...

2188
02:33:02,167 --> 02:33:06,150
[SPEAKER_05]: with the eye toy to make like a samurai game where you could run at each other type thing.

2189
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:08,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, and then a punch to attack, basically.

2190
02:33:09,112 --> 02:33:10,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of like mo-cap.

2191
02:33:10,693 --> 02:33:12,575
[SPEAKER_05]: See, now that's a good serious answer.

2192
02:33:13,175 --> 02:33:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it's not funny, but it's actually a good answer as far as serious ones are concerned.

2193
02:33:17,859 --> 02:33:21,202
[SPEAKER_19]: I always thought they should have used the eye toy to make like a mo-cap boxing at home.

2194
02:33:22,703 --> 02:33:24,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other suggestions you got for us, John?

2195
02:33:25,065 --> 02:33:25,765
[SPEAKER_16]: That was it, basically.

2196
02:33:25,845 --> 02:33:28,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well that's actually a decent one, so you might want to send that on over to Konami.

2197
02:33:28,988 --> 02:33:29,348
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

2198
02:33:30,424 --> 02:33:31,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, thanks for calling.

2199
02:33:32,366 --> 02:33:32,746
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

2200
02:33:32,846 --> 02:33:33,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

2201
02:33:34,287 --> 02:33:36,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if I can answer this call real fast, it's coming in.

2202
02:33:36,989 --> 02:33:38,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2203
02:33:38,891 --> 02:33:40,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Sky, Siggy here.

2204
02:33:40,332 --> 02:33:41,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Siggy, how you doing?

2205
02:33:42,714 --> 02:33:44,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, hey, I'm doing fine.

2206
02:33:44,555 --> 02:33:45,476
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your suggestion?

2207
02:33:46,917 --> 02:33:48,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I never had that kind of laugh since episode 69.

2208
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:53,483
[SPEAKER_05]: He has not laughed that hard since episode 69 when Loki sang I'm Coming Out.

2209
02:33:53,503 --> 02:33:54,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't here.

2210
02:33:54,523 --> 02:33:55,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, you weren't even here, Jamie.

2211
02:33:56,145 --> 02:33:58,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, which one made you laugh the most?

2212
02:33:59,650 --> 02:34:02,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, of course, the one that says number 13.

2213
02:34:03,751 --> 02:34:06,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I really can, you know, the chatters right now.

2214
02:34:06,551 --> 02:34:07,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for number 13.

2215
02:34:07,912 --> 02:34:12,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 13, the mini water in your asshole game is the one that made him laugh the most.

2216
02:34:13,073 --> 02:34:14,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I was laughing really hard.

2217
02:34:15,153 --> 02:34:17,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my stomach, you know, my stomach's really hurting.

2218
02:34:18,414 --> 02:34:21,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad we could cause you such pain here on Orange Log Radio.

2219
02:34:22,755 --> 02:34:23,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a deep breath.

2220
02:34:24,035 --> 02:34:25,195
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you okay?

2221
02:34:25,415 --> 02:34:25,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Breathe in.

2222
02:34:26,156 --> 02:34:28,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have any suggestions you wanted to pass along?

2223
02:34:30,874 --> 02:34:31,474
[SPEAKER_05]: We can barely hear you.

2224
02:34:31,494 --> 02:34:32,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Speak into your mic a little more.

2225
02:34:33,055 --> 02:34:34,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Just, uh, that's it.

2226
02:34:34,036 --> 02:34:34,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Just an episode.

2227
02:34:34,856 --> 02:34:35,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, uh, episode.

2228
02:34:35,937 --> 02:34:38,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, uh, vote for number 13.

2229
02:34:38,198 --> 02:34:40,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, he's just saying vote for number 13, Mini Water in Your Asshole Game.

2230
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:41,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll see, Siggy.

2231
02:34:41,761 --> 02:34:42,121
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2232
02:34:43,035 --> 02:34:43,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for calling!

2233
02:34:44,256 --> 02:34:44,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Later!

2234
02:34:44,616 --> 02:34:45,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one!

2235
02:35:11,330 --> 02:35:15,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we'll be back after this break of Taka music while you guys vote on tonight's list list.

2236
02:35:15,675 --> 02:35:15,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy!

2237
02:36:39,961 --> 02:36:40,722
Thanks for watching!

2238
02:37:30,376 --> 02:37:34,397
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad, I got a location test one in there, so let's do a better quality Takasong.

2239
02:37:34,477 --> 02:37:34,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do this one.

2240
02:37:42,694 --> 02:37:44,477
Thank you for watching!

2241
02:39:00,491 --> 02:39:00,793
Thank you.

2242
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:07,981
Thanks for watching!

2243
02:40:40,625 --> 02:40:41,466
Thanks for watching!

2244
02:41:10,289 --> 02:41:11,289
Thank you for watching!

2245
02:41:44,850 --> 02:41:49,631
[SPEAKER_20]: From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

2246
02:41:50,032 --> 02:42:00,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla, Holla,

2247
02:42:15,382 --> 02:42:15,742
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2248
02:42:16,803 --> 02:42:18,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you had to go worship the porcelain goddess.

2249
02:42:20,704 --> 02:42:21,125
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2250
02:42:21,465 --> 02:42:22,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing.

2251
02:42:22,105 --> 02:42:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2252
02:42:22,365 --> 02:42:22,605
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2253
02:42:24,326 --> 02:42:25,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got to get this in.

2254
02:42:25,406 --> 02:42:27,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we have a little bit of time for Ask Orange Lounge, but I don't know.

2255
02:42:28,448 --> 02:42:29,648
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely have to get this segment in.

2256
02:42:30,069 --> 02:42:33,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is it, Jamie, that we have to do these FUs every single week?

2257
02:42:34,090 --> 02:42:35,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes you've just got to let it out.

2258
02:42:54,238 --> 02:42:59,859
[SPEAKER_19]: My first FU goes to the almost entirety of traffic on the road today.

2259
02:43:00,339 --> 02:43:05,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Which is why I stand by my desire to have a Humvee with a freaking missile launcher on it.

2260
02:43:06,881 --> 02:43:08,041
[SPEAKER_19]: I finally saw it in action.

2261
02:43:08,081 --> 02:43:14,903
[SPEAKER_19]: I found a movie file on Military.com of a Humvee with a missile launcher blowing up a tank.

2262
02:43:15,763 --> 02:43:17,224
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was so hot to me.

2263
02:43:18,928 --> 02:43:21,689
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I decided that I really, really have to have one now.

2264
02:43:23,249 --> 02:43:29,110
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh... So, I need one for traffic.

2265
02:43:30,050 --> 02:43:40,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Another FU goes toward, uh... I'm getting a little panicky about school, so I guess this sort of goes to me for being kind of panicky about it.

2266
02:43:40,552 --> 02:43:48,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Another FU goes toward not having time and money and the ability to go visit who I want to.

2267
02:43:48,254 --> 02:43:48,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Although...

2268
02:43:49,255 --> 02:43:57,780
[SPEAKER_19]: I am planning on going to Alabama in November, so I'll come back, accent and all, and you'll have to make fun of me, and I'll go, I'll fuck y'all.

2269
02:44:01,181 --> 02:44:08,425
[SPEAKER_19]: Another one goes toward, I'm going to be very general with this and say people who just don't get it.

2270
02:44:09,186 --> 02:44:14,689
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, you tell them, and you point it out, and they just don't get it, you know?

2271
02:44:15,149 --> 02:44:17,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Those people just, uh-uh-uh, no.

2272
02:44:18,491 --> 02:44:18,571
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

2273
02:44:21,767 --> 02:44:26,389
[SPEAKER_19]: Another FU goes toward that stupid introduction to Windows class that I have to take.

2274
02:44:26,970 --> 02:44:28,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know what I say?

2275
02:44:28,771 --> 02:44:30,151
[SPEAKER_19]: Dear class, fuck you.

2276
02:44:30,191 --> 02:44:32,292
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm petitioning the dean so I can test out of it.

2277
02:44:32,412 --> 02:44:32,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2278
02:44:33,393 --> 02:44:34,013
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I'm done.

2279
02:44:34,293 --> 02:44:36,775
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, another one goes to allergies and not having any sinus medicine.

2280
02:44:38,235 --> 02:44:41,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on to Loki and his FUs of the week.

2281
02:44:45,879 --> 02:44:49,401
[SPEAKER_09]: My first FU goes to stupid trees which limbs keep falling off of.

2282
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:55,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to God, I know I'm going to be walking to the apartment during the night all of a sudden this limb is going to fall on me.

2283
02:44:55,624 --> 02:44:56,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to suck.

2284
02:44:58,526 --> 02:45:00,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, fuck you, the SUV drivers.

2285
02:45:01,088 --> 02:45:09,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to God, I just saw, like, yesterday, two different instances where SUVs crashed into things.

2286
02:45:09,935 --> 02:45:11,796
[SPEAKER_09]: First one being into a truck.

2287
02:45:13,257 --> 02:45:17,500
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second time, a Humvee jumped the rail and hit another car.

2288
02:45:18,001 --> 02:45:18,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Because...

2289
02:45:19,858 --> 02:45:22,283
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an H2.

2290
02:45:22,403 --> 02:45:23,324
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a real Hummer.

2291
02:45:23,805 --> 02:45:25,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not a real Hummer, but, you know.

2292
02:45:27,512 --> 02:45:29,095
[SPEAKER_09]: An H2.

2293
02:45:29,535 --> 02:45:30,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a woman.

2294
02:45:30,737 --> 02:45:31,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a woman driving it.

2295
02:45:31,759 --> 02:45:33,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you she was on a cell phone, too.

2296
02:45:35,955 --> 02:45:38,516
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to sort of insert a nephew there to the H2.

2297
02:45:38,637 --> 02:45:39,437
[SPEAKER_19]: They look like shit.

2298
02:45:39,797 --> 02:45:40,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2299
02:45:40,337 --> 02:45:44,339
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want a Hummer, you freaking get one that looks like it's, you know, armored.

2300
02:45:44,700 --> 02:45:47,021
[SPEAKER_19]: That it can run over buildings and live.

2301
02:45:47,301 --> 02:45:50,162
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I don't have a problem with women driving SUVs or anything like that.

2302
02:45:50,282 --> 02:45:53,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just when you drive with cell phones and don't pay attention to shit.

2303
02:45:54,164 --> 02:46:00,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you get into accidents and they kill people because I know there was a stretcher there and they were sure as hell blocking traffic, so...

2304
02:46:02,309 --> 02:46:04,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, fuck you to them.

2305
02:46:04,971 --> 02:46:08,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um... Fuck you to Alien vs. Predator.

2306
02:46:09,975 --> 02:46:11,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddammit, that was a waste of two hours.

2307
02:46:12,597 --> 02:46:14,218
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was a funny-ass movie.

2308
02:46:15,259 --> 02:46:16,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Alien vs. Predator.

2309
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:20,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, who'd have thunk it that it was a buddy comedy?

2310
02:46:21,664 --> 02:46:22,624
[SPEAKER_09]: My god, lame.

2311
02:46:22,664 --> 02:46:24,506
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I should have known better going into it.

2312
02:46:26,848 --> 02:46:28,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And, finally, um...

2313
02:46:31,644 --> 02:46:32,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, that's it.

2314
02:46:32,365 --> 02:46:32,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

2315
02:46:33,645 --> 02:46:34,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.

2316
02:46:34,946 --> 02:46:35,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to my co-worker.

2317
02:46:36,547 --> 02:46:39,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, this is quite funny because this is the one that was sleeping around.

2318
02:46:40,310 --> 02:46:41,911
[SPEAKER_01]: She's getting demoted.

2319
02:46:46,614 --> 02:46:47,595
[SPEAKER_01]: She couldn't cut it.

2320
02:46:49,436 --> 02:46:53,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Shows you that it takes more than just sleeping around to get into sales, bitch.

2321
02:46:54,479 --> 02:46:55,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's all.

2322
02:47:03,649 --> 02:47:04,090
[SPEAKER_05]: My turn.

2323
02:47:04,671 --> 02:47:05,573
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to getting sick.

2324
02:47:06,115 --> 02:47:11,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And F you to having a special friend that you keep passing diseases back and forth to.

2325
02:47:13,385 --> 02:47:14,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, colds, people.

2326
02:47:15,126 --> 02:47:16,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't think dirty.

2327
02:47:16,967 --> 02:47:21,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I would like to say a big F you to faggoty drama queens.

2328
02:47:21,850 --> 02:47:26,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that faggot is a derogatory term, and I don't use it unless I really mean it, okay?

2329
02:47:26,432 --> 02:47:28,513
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy I know, he's a real faggot, okay?

2330
02:47:29,414 --> 02:47:30,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm gay, so I'm allowed to say that word.

2331
02:47:30,815 --> 02:47:33,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's a difference between a gay person and, like, a total faggot, okay?

2332
02:47:33,936 --> 02:47:38,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy pisses me off because he is such a fucking drama queen.

2333
02:47:38,299 --> 02:47:39,379
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't even imagine.

2334
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:42,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I haven't seen this guy in, like, five years.

2335
02:47:42,614 --> 02:47:50,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like, last night, I ran into him, and there was just this aura of just, like, drama-ness that you wouldn't even look me in the eye.

2336
02:47:51,819 --> 02:47:58,902
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I just wanted to say hi and just be like, okay, so, like, hi, you know, our drama's five years old, let's get over it.

2337
02:47:59,483 --> 02:48:00,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, denied.

2338
02:48:00,663 --> 02:48:01,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever.

2339
02:48:01,804 --> 02:48:02,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

2340
02:48:03,265 --> 02:48:03,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

2341
02:48:05,306 --> 02:48:06,206
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's all I have to say.

2342
02:48:08,107 --> 02:48:10,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, let's go to Angel and Arcadian.

2343
02:48:10,708 --> 02:48:11,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Who has a mic?

2344
02:48:11,149 --> 02:48:11,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian!

2345
02:48:16,007 --> 02:48:23,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, first off, uh, fuck you to these horrible commercials, these horrible radio commercials, fucking kids.

2346
02:48:24,070 --> 02:48:26,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, like every 15 minutes these goddamn kids come on.

2347
02:48:26,832 --> 02:48:27,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, eh!

2348
02:48:27,692 --> 02:48:30,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's the commercial I fucking hate the Paul Zonka commercial.

2349
02:48:30,853 --> 02:48:32,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Those damn kids are so fucking annoying.

2350
02:48:32,934 --> 02:48:36,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to shoot the goddamn radio for the stupid kids.

2351
02:48:38,096 --> 02:48:39,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Wish I could stab them through the radio.

2352
02:48:39,577 --> 02:48:42,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh no, I'm dying.

2353
02:48:42,718 --> 02:48:43,739
[SPEAKER_14]: No, can't do more radio.

2354
02:48:45,230 --> 02:48:46,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, let's see, what else?

2355
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:52,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, fuck you to radio commercials that have songs that say, oh, I like this song.

2356
02:48:52,512 --> 02:48:53,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's a fucking commercial.

2357
02:48:54,152 --> 02:48:55,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope your business goes down in flames.

2358
02:48:56,833 --> 02:49:04,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, it's like one of those damn car dealerships of Satan that will keep going forever in the space of a 20.

2359
02:49:04,775 --> 02:49:09,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, fuck you to the trees that work that pour sap on my car.

2360
02:49:10,825 --> 02:49:18,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really afford to, and fuck you that I can't afford to actually go to the car wash to get at least some of it off without having to scrape and scrub and everything.

2361
02:49:20,293 --> 02:49:28,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yeah, fuck you to not, uh, being nearly penniless, having to plan out months in advance where my money is going.

2362
02:49:28,899 --> 02:49:31,061
[SPEAKER_10]: But hopefully that'll change in like a month or two.

2363
02:49:32,782 --> 02:49:34,263
[SPEAKER_10]: And fuck you to not be able to go places.

2364
02:49:34,784 --> 02:49:37,406
[SPEAKER_10]: And not be able to go to the arcades or anything.

2365
02:49:39,281 --> 02:49:41,023
[SPEAKER_10]: and, yeah, that's all.

2366
02:49:41,663 --> 02:49:42,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DDR Angel.

2367
02:49:43,405 --> 02:49:53,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, uh, well, I know you guys have, uh, said this FU over and over and over again, but see, now that I live here, I really know what you're talking about.

2368
02:49:53,573 --> 02:50:05,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, FU to the freaking stupid drivers around here, because they've almost killed us, like, I don't know, at least, uh, five times that I can recall this week while driving around Sacramento, so it's like,

2369
02:50:06,905 --> 02:50:21,653
[SPEAKER_17]: and also FU to the main post office in Sacramento because they have still decided to hold our mail so we're not getting all of it like we should be.

2370
02:50:22,334 --> 02:50:24,215
[SPEAKER_17]: But well, I guess that's the...

2371
02:50:25,589 --> 02:50:26,869
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, downside to moving.

2372
02:50:27,609 --> 02:50:33,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, Magus wants to send an FU to big work servers going down.

2373
02:50:33,831 --> 02:50:42,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Because now he's going to have to explain himself on Wednesday as to why the server went down for four hours.

2374
02:50:43,013 --> 02:50:45,513
[SPEAKER_17]: So he's going to have some extra work to do, it looks like.

2375
02:50:45,773 --> 02:50:46,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh well.

2376
02:50:47,333 --> 02:50:48,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, I guess that's it.

2377
02:50:49,074 --> 02:50:51,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's move on to our chatroom FUs, shall we?

2378
02:50:51,814 --> 02:50:52,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2379
02:50:57,307 --> 02:51:09,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Unknown Gamer wants to say, I want to send a big heaping F you to Loki for calling your reign R&B shit.

2380
02:51:10,311 --> 02:51:13,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Go back and tend to whatever Bomani artist you're into.

2381
02:51:13,272 --> 02:51:15,153
[SPEAKER_05]: To his cock, fanboy.

2382
02:51:16,073 --> 02:51:18,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can throw in an I love DarkSakura thing.

2383
02:51:18,094 --> 02:51:19,294
[SPEAKER_05]: She's my online hag now.

2384
02:51:20,711 --> 02:51:21,452
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so cool.

2385
02:51:21,832 --> 02:51:26,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Any response to you being an asshole for calling your reign R&B shit?

2386
02:51:27,176 --> 02:51:27,416
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

2387
02:51:27,456 --> 02:51:32,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's still shit, even though, whether you think it's not or, you know, whatever.

2388
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:33,020
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still shit.

2389
02:51:33,160 --> 02:51:33,861
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll always be shit.

2390
02:51:35,462 --> 02:51:35,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

2391
02:51:37,944 --> 02:51:38,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

2392
02:51:38,965 --> 02:51:39,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Panda wants to say...

2393
02:51:41,112 --> 02:51:45,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Panda wants to say F you to Sky for counting my vote as California Dreamin'.

2394
02:51:45,734 --> 02:51:48,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I like the version off the DJ Sammy CD better.

2395
02:51:49,036 --> 02:51:55,479
[SPEAKER_05]: For your information, Panda, I counted your vote for song 2 because I saw that you changed it.

2396
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:56,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch!

2397
02:51:58,861 --> 02:51:59,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that was really brutal.

2398
02:52:00,022 --> 02:52:03,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I just probably, I just totally chastised one of our listeners.

2399
02:52:04,504 --> 02:52:04,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2400
02:52:04,664 --> 02:52:06,525
[SPEAKER_05]: See, now this is crap, okay?

2401
02:52:07,746 --> 02:52:08,306
[SPEAKER_05]: This is crap.

2402
02:52:11,736 --> 02:52:13,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

2403
02:52:13,898 --> 02:52:20,965
[SPEAKER_05]: ViolentHyperGirl says, F you to fabboys and F you to three-dimensional calculus when it involves solving the moment of inertia in some solid object.

2404
02:52:21,285 --> 02:52:24,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it involves three intervals, each of which takes almost a third of a page.

2405
02:52:24,208 --> 02:52:25,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm getting bored here.

2406
02:52:26,470 --> 02:52:29,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, F you to leaving my friend's birthday party on Saturday night.

2407
02:52:29,673 --> 02:52:32,996
[SPEAKER_05]: If I didn't have to go to Davis the next day, I would have stayed all night and just caught a ride with someone.

2408
02:52:33,016 --> 02:52:34,297
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, and F you to ants.

2409
02:52:34,357 --> 02:52:35,138
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to die.

2410
02:52:35,458 --> 02:52:36,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart raid.

2411
02:52:38,489 --> 02:52:42,171
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, an FU goes to a particular person who acts like they know everything.

2412
02:52:42,211 --> 02:52:43,372
[SPEAKER_05]: You are an idiot, period.

2413
02:52:43,933 --> 02:52:46,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like saying FUs to individuals in particular.

2414
02:52:47,355 --> 02:52:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: RightChan says, FU to drama queens that blame the drama on everyone else and break up a community in the process.

2415
02:52:51,978 --> 02:52:52,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I agree with that.

2416
02:52:53,279 --> 02:52:58,602
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to garbage that is on welfare and feels they need to have children because their boyfriend is going to take care of me.

2417
02:52:58,842 --> 02:52:59,843
[SPEAKER_19]: Amen to that.

2418
02:53:02,975 --> 02:53:05,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya says, F you to keyboard hotkeys.

2419
02:53:05,636 --> 02:53:07,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I hit one on accident and it shut down my computer.

2420
02:53:09,559 --> 02:53:20,544
[SPEAKER_05]: MJB says, my F you of the week goes to goddamn toysandjoys.com for sending me my Max 2 Japanese after two weeks of waiting but forgetting to send party collection.

2421
02:53:20,945 --> 02:53:22,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate you, Toys and Joys.

2422
02:53:22,886 --> 02:53:23,186
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

2423
02:53:23,226 --> 02:53:26,468
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a free copy of Fantasy Star Collection.

2424
02:53:26,488 --> 02:53:26,808
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

2425
02:53:29,306 --> 02:53:35,970
[SPEAKER_05]: John Field says, F you to Microsoft and XP Service Pack 2 again because I'm still crashing.

2426
02:53:36,130 --> 02:53:37,151
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to the laws of physics.

2427
02:53:37,171 --> 02:53:39,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be much easier if I didn't need to use any fuel to drive my car.

2428
02:53:40,333 --> 02:53:41,634
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to moving between dorm rooms.

2429
02:53:44,616 --> 02:53:52,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Misty says, the closest thing to a real F you that I've gotten this week is to myself for not being able to think shit up for my RPG and the works of fanfiction I've got.

2430
02:53:54,551 --> 02:54:01,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Lunarius says F you to physical distance because I found a guy online that I really like but he lives hundreds of miles from me.

2431
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:08,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Knight says F you to the USA basketball team for getting the ass kicked by Puerto Rico today.

2432
02:54:10,084 --> 02:54:10,765
[SPEAKER_05]: That is kind of funny.

2433
02:54:13,823 --> 02:54:28,597
[SPEAKER_05]: SaoZao, I hope I said that right, SaoZao says, uh, F you to my connection for being so shitty, fuck you, uh, F you Nickel City for ripping off Konami and using Step Mania, woo, uh, Konami, or uh, Nickel City.

2434
02:54:30,202 --> 02:54:38,750
[SPEAKER_05]: DDRHolic says, F you to people who get pissed at you when you aren't driving fast enough and when the reason you aren't driving fast enough is because the idiot in front of you isn't driving fast enough.

2435
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:47,357
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to people who think that they own the entire public road system and drive like there are no fucking rules anywhere but their own rules, driving wherever they want, whenever they want.

2436
02:54:48,118 --> 02:54:53,563
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to people who think they have special privileges, such as parking in front of the grocery store in the red zone to load their fucking groceries.

2437
02:54:54,332 --> 02:54:56,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Load their fucking groceries like the rest of us motherfuckers.

2438
02:54:57,075 --> 02:55:05,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I've even seen someone pull their SUV out of the handicap parking spot to the front of the store to load their fucking groceries like they weren't close enough to the grocery store in the first place.

2439
02:55:07,945 --> 02:55:13,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, oh, that wasn't even an FU, but it was a personal question for me from somebody.

2440
02:55:13,390 --> 02:55:14,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that was the last one.

2441
02:55:16,393 --> 02:55:16,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know.

2442
02:55:17,013 --> 02:55:17,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad, huh?

2443
02:55:18,061 --> 02:55:30,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, about the Toys and Joys FU, that's the first time I've actually heard someone negatively bash them, except for when I didn't get my controller, but I got it five days later, so it doesn't matter.

2444
02:55:32,407 --> 02:55:34,408
[SPEAKER_19]: I have never had a problem with Toys and Joys.

2445
02:55:34,688 --> 02:55:43,512
[SPEAKER_19]: When we were really big into the Sega Ages 2500, we had ordered a bunch of games from there, and all of our others arrived,

2446
02:55:44,056 --> 02:55:49,301
[SPEAKER_19]: They actually sent me an email saying, you know, Fantasy Star, we were at a Fantasy Star collection.

2447
02:55:49,781 --> 02:55:50,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to cancel the order?

2448
02:55:50,822 --> 02:55:52,463
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, well, sure, go ahead and cancel it.

2449
02:55:52,563 --> 02:55:53,404
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we'll wait on that.

2450
02:55:53,905 --> 02:55:55,106
[SPEAKER_19]: And they had shipped it anyway.

2451
02:55:56,487 --> 02:55:58,889
[SPEAKER_19]: So we were actually never charged for a Fantasy Star collection.

2452
02:56:01,331 --> 02:56:02,812
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we are done.

2453
02:56:05,314 --> 02:56:09,558
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, when I ordered my Guitar Freaks controllers, I had them two days later.

2454
02:56:11,573 --> 02:56:11,873
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2455
02:56:14,454 --> 02:56:15,614
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for the FUs tonight.

2456
02:56:15,674 --> 02:56:16,655
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got all our FUs in.

2457
02:56:17,575 --> 02:56:20,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we ready to hear about tonight's listless?

2458
02:56:20,896 --> 02:56:21,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, Rob.

2459
02:56:22,697 --> 02:56:23,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we ready?

2460
02:56:26,278 --> 02:56:29,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And now to announce the winners of tonight's listless.

2461
02:56:30,079 --> 02:56:30,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck this song.

2462
02:56:30,900 --> 02:56:33,040
[SPEAKER_05]: As a reminder, here is tonight's topic.

2463
02:56:34,141 --> 02:56:38,162
[SPEAKER_05]: A iToy minigame I would most like to see in DDR.

2464
02:56:38,622 --> 02:56:40,823
[SPEAKER_05]: You voted, and here are the results.

2465
02:56:41,602 --> 02:56:43,883
[SPEAKER_05]: In third place, we have a tie.

2466
02:56:44,724 --> 02:56:48,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Our third place winner number one is Break Shit.

2467
02:56:48,806 --> 02:56:50,307
Yay!

2468
02:56:50,707 --> 02:56:54,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Our third place winner number two is Whack A Child.

2469
02:56:54,630 --> 02:56:55,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

2470
02:56:56,731 --> 02:57:02,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Our second place winner in tonight's list list is Fuck With The Other Players Arrows.

2471
02:57:02,054 --> 02:57:02,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

2472
02:57:04,202 --> 02:57:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight's winner for iToy minigame I would most like to see in DDR is... Mini Water in Your Asshole game!

2473
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:19,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and Answer Question or Catch Fire also got third place!

2474
02:57:20,053 --> 02:57:23,496
[SPEAKER_17]: This is where Angel's, uh, thought bubble goes dot dot dot, I won?

2475
02:57:23,676 --> 02:57:23,796
[SPEAKER_17]: What?! !

2476
02:57:25,202 --> 02:57:25,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, me too.

2477
02:57:25,963 --> 02:57:26,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Dot, dot, dot.

2478
02:57:26,623 --> 02:57:28,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you had a little help from the rest of us.

2479
02:57:28,625 --> 02:57:31,787
[SPEAKER_05]: You were going to say the WarioWare thing, and nobody got that.

2480
02:57:31,807 --> 02:57:34,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It was much funnier when we said water in your asshole.

2481
02:57:34,370 --> 02:57:35,611
[SPEAKER_17]: That is the WarioWare thing.

2482
02:57:35,651 --> 02:57:36,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Never mind.

2483
02:57:37,912 --> 02:57:40,415
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess it was better than that BurgerTime thing.

2484
02:57:43,917 --> 02:57:58,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and showing the true mentality age of most of our chat room chatters and our listeners, the game that has the word asshole in it wins, so good job.

2485
02:57:58,526 --> 02:58:02,068
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's the first time that that's actually happened.

2486
02:58:02,208 --> 02:58:05,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts of mine were like, regulate your brain.

2487
02:58:05,871 --> 02:58:06,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

2488
02:58:21,593 --> 02:58:28,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like, my favorite, call the assurance inspector at a toy factory mode.

2489
02:58:28,179 --> 02:58:33,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you get to throw in a bunch of sharp razor blades and stuff into the stuffed animals.

2490
02:58:34,024 --> 02:58:39,809
[SPEAKER_09]: But see, you have certain items that you can put in the animals, and you just have to get the right one, depending on what it is.

2491
02:58:39,889 --> 02:58:46,936
[SPEAKER_19]: I was thinking of one that's like that, there was one of those little flash games that was where you would have this

2492
02:58:48,732 --> 02:58:52,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Phallus, and shoot into these condoms as they went by.

2493
02:58:53,194 --> 02:58:54,935
[SPEAKER_19]: They should have, like, Condom Tester, the game.

2494
02:58:56,535 --> 02:59:02,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, I have some questions for you as the author of... Oh, shit.

2495
02:59:02,998 --> 02:59:03,998
[SPEAKER_09]: What, Loki, what?

2496
02:59:06,980 --> 02:59:11,661
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like, okay, there's the line, and I'm crossing it.

2497
02:59:12,922 --> 02:59:14,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Do your own abortion mode.

2498
02:59:14,543 --> 02:59:15,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

2499
02:59:17,697 --> 02:59:18,477
[SPEAKER_05]: You're horrible.

2500
02:59:19,118 --> 02:59:19,438
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2501
02:59:21,018 --> 02:59:26,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, as the author of Mini Water in Your Asshole Game, I have some questions.

2502
02:59:27,301 --> 02:59:28,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever played Eye Toy Groove?

2503
02:59:29,341 --> 02:59:29,521
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2504
02:59:29,601 --> 02:59:32,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how Eye Toy Groove takes pictures and video of you as you play?

2505
02:59:33,403 --> 02:59:36,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Would Mini Water in Your Asshole Game do the same thing?

2506
02:59:38,260 --> 02:59:48,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh god, now I'm thinking of that stupid, um... What was that really fucked up Japanese game that had the vibrator shit?

2507
02:59:48,722 --> 02:59:49,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Rez?

2508
02:59:49,262 --> 02:59:49,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Rez.

2509
02:59:50,263 --> 02:59:50,623
[SPEAKER_17]: God.

2510
02:59:50,643 --> 02:59:53,703
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, like, there's the Abunga game.

2511
02:59:54,323 --> 02:59:55,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Where you stick the finger in the ass.

2512
02:59:57,584 --> 02:59:58,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Abunga Bunga.

2513
02:59:58,344 --> 02:59:59,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in our chatroom actually suggested that.

2514
03:00:00,005 --> 03:00:00,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that go by.

2515
03:00:01,425 --> 03:00:05,366
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't believe, though, that Abunga actually was, like, a real game and they had a party for it and everything.

2516
03:00:06,426 --> 03:00:06,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

2517
03:00:07,682 --> 03:00:10,263
[SPEAKER_05]: My other question about mini water in your asshole game.

2518
03:00:10,763 --> 03:00:14,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you get the water in your asshole, would you be able to shoot it back out?

2519
03:00:18,866 --> 03:00:21,807
[SPEAKER_05]: On that note, it's about time to end the show here.

2520
03:00:21,907 --> 03:00:24,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2521
03:00:24,929 --> 03:00:27,169
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Angel, your final thought, please.

2522
03:00:32,311 --> 03:00:33,752
[SPEAKER_17]: I did not expect the...

2523
03:00:34,676 --> 03:00:35,716
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2524
03:00:59,272 --> 03:00:59,612
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

2525
03:00:59,732 --> 03:01:01,133
[SPEAKER_17]: People actually chose what I wanted to do.

2526
03:01:01,513 --> 03:01:01,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2527
03:01:02,113 --> 03:01:02,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Get over yourself.

2528
03:01:02,993 --> 03:01:05,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2529
03:01:05,994 --> 03:01:08,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcadian42, your final thought, please.

2530
03:01:14,397 --> 03:01:15,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Things may be looking up.

2531
03:01:15,517 --> 03:01:16,758
[SPEAKER_10]: My future may be coming on.

2532
03:01:17,498 --> 03:01:18,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

2533
03:01:18,859 --> 03:01:20,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought, please.

2534
03:01:25,661 --> 03:01:26,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm tired.

2535
03:01:28,302 --> 03:01:28,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I like my yogurt.

2536
03:01:29,980 --> 03:01:31,000
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to suck later.

2537
03:01:33,461 --> 03:01:41,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, my final thought is I hope you all have a wonderful week and listen to Orange Launch Radio lots.

2538
03:01:43,505 --> 03:01:50,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going to make an announcement about Vanilla Sky coming back, but I guess we'll wait for next week.

2539
03:01:50,307 --> 03:01:51,747
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't plugged the shows!

2540
03:01:52,167 --> 03:01:53,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we haven't plugged the shows.

2541
03:01:53,628 --> 03:01:56,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to Orange Launch Radio every weeknight and hear something cool.

2542
03:01:56,329 --> 03:01:56,609
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

2543
03:01:57,679 --> 03:02:27,195
[SPEAKER_05]: because the rewinds are coming back as well the rewinds will be back on Thursday Thursday nights by popular demand the Orange Lounge Radio Rewind and probably we're looking I actually might bump it up a little bit to like 6 o'clock so our East Coast friends don't have to stay up so late to hear the show maybe even 5 we'll see my final thought is actually listen to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night starting at I tend to start around a quarter to 7 if I get early but usually pre-show starts at 7 show starts at 7.30 goes to whenever

2544
03:02:28,470 --> 03:02:30,312
[SPEAKER_19]: I will likely be doing homework the whole time.

2545
03:02:31,112 --> 03:02:36,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but, uh, I'm thinking, you know, I play a lot of dancey, happy, crappy stuff.

2546
03:02:37,417 --> 03:02:41,060
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just gonna go for broke and say, screw you, R-I-A-A.

2547
03:02:41,640 --> 03:02:53,970
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm playing Metallica S&M concert and, like, a bunch of hair rock and, like, some Rammstein and, uh, and, uh, I don't know, I might throw in some, like, uh,

2548
03:02:55,149 --> 03:02:56,570
[SPEAKER_19]: Danzig, and Henry Rollins.

2549
03:02:57,151 --> 03:02:57,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Just for the hell of it.

2550
03:02:58,832 --> 03:03:00,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing happy, dancy, poppy for me.

2551
03:03:01,514 --> 03:03:02,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, maybe a little bit.

2552
03:03:02,354 --> 03:03:02,975
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe the pre-show.

2553
03:03:04,956 --> 03:03:05,577
[SPEAKER_19]: And some Enflo.

2554
03:03:05,637 --> 03:03:08,179
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll play some Enflo to make the Enflo people happy.

2555
03:03:08,979 --> 03:03:11,421
[SPEAKER_19]: I will play some Enflo and Crystal K. I love that.

2556
03:03:11,941 --> 03:03:16,165
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's mostly going to be the Metallica S&M concert.

2557
03:03:16,425 --> 03:03:18,927
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that's just really, really freaking rad.

2558
03:03:20,047 --> 03:03:20,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2559
03:03:20,868 --> 03:03:22,309
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be a very interesting show then.

2560
03:03:22,809 --> 03:03:23,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, hell yeah!

2561
03:03:24,130 --> 03:03:24,851
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me.

2562
03:03:25,333 --> 03:03:25,613
