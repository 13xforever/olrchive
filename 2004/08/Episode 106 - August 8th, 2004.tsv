25411	26772	And now for our feature presentation
58798	62401	Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.
63142	69968	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and then some.
70748	77294	Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.
78415	86522	If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!
88064	91525	Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
96426	101207	Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
101507	104127	Fast, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.
104527	108068	He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.
108968	111749	Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.
112149	112989	Hamburgers!
113649	115670	The cornerstone of any nutritious practice.
115690	116870	That was a huge one.
118736	123519	Do you mind if I pick my new car for a ride?
123539	127141	Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.
127621	128481	Have you seen Malcolm?
129022	129382	Lena?
129782	133404	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.
133684	134464	So it was you.
135285	136325	I was going to expose you.
136546	136986	I know.
137466	138787	So I choose to expose myself.
139047	140488	Please, there are ladies present.
140748	142969	That would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
143089	144370	DarkSakura.
144650	146631	Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!
148046	149367	Any time, any place, baby.
149687	150187	Loki.
150787	151587	Ow, my foot!
151948	154168	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
154568	156389	Orange Lounge Radio.
157850	159410	We are live!
159830	164952	And this is episode number 106 for this August the 8th of 2004.
165932	171214	We are the internet's talk radio program dedicated to all things Vamani and then some.
171794	174455	And with me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
174535	176196	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
176236	176796	Say hello to...
177492	179353	Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, DarkSakura.
179573	182215	Yay, hooray for me.
182615	183555	Hooray for you.
183575	184756	Hooray for me.
184936	186377	I'm, I'm, and hooray for me.
186897	189059	You put my meat on the camera, you whored out my meat.
189139	193561	Yes I did, I put your meat on our brand new webcam, available at www.
193581	195262	And now my foot is on the webcam.
196783	199445	That's all you'll ever see, is my foot.
199465	203047	www.orangeloungeradio.com is our webcam address.
203287	207049	Also with us tonight, say hello to our tech massa, Loki's.
207987	211272	Yeah, she's like Dr. Claw, but instead of the arm, it's a foot.
213495	215819	But it's not the claw, it's just a hand.
216059	218302	It just can't be Dr. Hand, because that's just stupid.
222549	228470	Also with us tonight, we have very few special guests here, but they're plentiful in the talent they have to bring.
228510	233251	We have somebody who has never been on the show before, and to be honest, I don't even know him that well.
233772	237172	But I think he's hilarious in what I've seen of him at our local arcade.
237572	240173	Say hello to Andrew.
240593	240853	Yes?
240953	242033	Yeah, what's going on, everybody?
242073	244934	I didn't know if he'd call you by your online, your real... No, I just got the right answer.
246039	246359	Andrew.
246379	248621	Alright, and Andrew is also well known for what?
249362	250263	Locally here at Roseville.
250523	253425	I dress up like a pirate at a golf land.
253445	256908	If you've ever seen a pirate there, that would be amazing.
257989	258770	Arr, he's a pirate.
259210	259830	How ironic.
260071	261452	I act like a pirate online.
262993	263994	He dresses up as one.
264354	265115	You act like one.
265135	265795	You do the deeds.
265915	266376	It all works.
267016	270279	Alright, also with us tonight, we have somebody who frequents the show quite a bit.
270299	271560	Do you recognize her from our chat room?
271580	272501	I'm sure if you hang out there.
272541	274242	Say hello to DDR Angel.
274463	274843	Hello!
274863	274963	Hello!
275822	276383	How you doing today?
276563	277023	Pretty good.
277143	279826	No, I noticed we're wearing like matching shirts tonight.
279846	280486	No, what the hell is that?
280526	281507	I wasn't even planning that.
281547	283429	They're not technically twin shirts.
283649	284150	They're close.
284390	284931	They're close.
285051	287893	We've got, she's got the one with the little piranha plant from Super Mario Bros.
287953	289215	It says, bite me.
289335	291217	And then I have the Goomba that says, you lose.
291337	292177	So it's like we're twins.
292197	294420	We'll go post on the webcam again real fast during the break.
294860	295120	All right.
295420	296081	We're posing.
297322	299906	Also with us tonight, we have another very special guest.
301168	303571	He's somebody that has actually been on the show before.
304232	307476	And he's our buddy from Kansas who now lives here in California.
308470	311052	It's our buddy Shane, also known as Miquitas.
311753	312053	Hi.
312714	317317	And if I'm not mistaken, you have a new name now that you go by as well, yes?
318018	320760	Yeah, you've been on the DDR Free Chords.
321221	323623	I would be the new Vivid member, Seagird.
323843	325824	So I'm the one causing you guys pain.
326705	331429	I definitely have a lot of questions for Seagird when we get back from the break.
332990	336033	Oh yeah, tonight, I guess maybe you guys heard about this.
336093	337054	We do have a little something.
337094	337394	There's a
337950	341091	A little song out there I think some of you guys are wanting to hear tonight.
345171	345851	That's all for right now.
346772	349812	But it is Your Rain from brand new DDR Extreme.
350352	352132	And we'll be playing that a little bit later in the show.
352172	355893	But hell, while we have a captive audience, let's do our normal antics.
355933	356633	Why don't we, huh?
357633	358474	Why not?
358494	361534	Because we love our listeners.
361554	362734	It's a three-hour show.
362794	363814	Let's wait until 2.59.
364095	364555	What do you think?
364715	365095	That works for me.
365115	366195	The song's only like a minute long.
366877	369498	Alright, no, we'll get to it somewhere after.
369538	370019	Eventually.
370139	373100	We definitely have to do How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day first, though, because that's when we start every show.
373500	379864	But first, we're going to take a break, and in this break, we're going to hear the original Akira Yamaoka, Your Rain, from Silent Hill 4.
380244	381725	Because that song is just so hot.
381865	384086	Because the song rocked before they remixed it.
384446	385747	So, I'm going to play it now.
385767	387328	Quite literally, because it is rock.
387388	387928	It is rock.
388188	388628	It is rock.
388908	389849	So, enjoy.
390009	391029	How perceptive.
391230	394491	Yes, enjoy this, and then we will be back to play a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
394571	395632	Also tonight, boys and girls...
396212	396693	Match Game.
397113	399054	And to play Match Game tonight, you're going to want to be on Skype.
399174	405299	Skype.org to download the client, and then you can talk to us live in the studio, and that's also available.
405339	405840	So here it is.
406580	407921	We'll be playing a remix of it tonight.
408722	411464	But here's the original from Silent Hill 4, Kiri Yamoka.
411784	412085	You're right.
412165	412545	Enjoy it.
484694	491036	All that I need are some simple loving words You touched my body once, it hurted
516927	527610	Out of my head and I don't know what I found Over and over I feel it break me down
581249	582870	Thanks for watching!
643687	644609	Thanks for watching!
691724	700310	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
700350	705674	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Saturday?
706340	709783	We are back and you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 106.
709843	716548	And if you are listening to the stream right now, consider yourself lucky because of that little song that we have we're going to play a little later for you guys.
717869	724194	Tonight's show got whored out on a lot of different sites and because of that we have hit what is called the cap, the Live 365 listening cap.
724454	729538	We're only allowed so many listeners and we never in our imaginations thought we would ever hit that limit.
729898	730538	We'll see you next time.
754489	754809	DDR and 2DX
776960	778702	We would be like the biggest dorks ever.
778822	782105	I mean, we're pretty dorky to begin with, to even have this show in the first place.
782405	784788	But to talk about nothing but DDR for like three hours?
785548	787410	Come on, you couldn't pay me enough.
787590	788691	There's other things out there.
788831	790273	You gotta go outside once in a while.
790753	793075	Get a job, get a girlfriend or boyfriend.
793135	796579	Remember, sunlight helps your body make vitamin D. Exactly.
796679	798180	Which you need to play DDR.
798240	798741	Exactly.
798801	799982	Because without it, you'll die.
800202	804625	But no, we do, when all is said and done, we make a lot of fun at DDR on this show, we really do.
804645	808728	But we're poking fun at ourselves when we poke fun at DDR, because really, we do have a lot of love for DDR.
809108	812970	I would never have met Jamie, I would never have met Loki if it wasn't for DDR, 2DX and that stuff.
813010	816172	I would never have met anybody here if it wasn't for that, and for that we're thankful.
816473	822396	And so we kind of always say, you know what, it's kind of like what happens when DDR gets taken outside the arcade.
822556	823657	That's what happens with this show.
823977	825538	This is DDR outside of the arcade.
825819	827980	So this is just everybody sitting around having a good time, so.
829073	830253	You think I summed that up pretty good, Jamie?
830514	831034	I think so.
831154	832854	That was pretty accurate.
832955	834575	Why do you do this show, Jamie?
835456	836396	I ain't got nothing else to do.
836496	837116	Yeah, good answer.
837396	837916	Seriously.
838337	843219	It's because, well, it's just fun, you know?
844559	845439	We all get together.
845539	848080	It's like family time, you know?
848701	851302	Because how many people just get around and have quality time?
851582	851682	Yeah.
851702	851922	Yeah.
852321	855442	and then I get my little segment where I get to fuss and complain.
855522	856663	Exactly, which we'll get to now.
856943	857743	We'll get to that later.
858363	859844	I enjoy everybody's company.
860324	860844	And you know what?
860924	867126	The fun doesn't stop just here because we actually do live shows throughout the week including, Jamie, you've got your own show.
867466	872648	I have one called Pump Up the Volume named after the movie because that movie was awesome and had Christian Slater.
874709	877090	But anyway, it's just a music request show.
877130	877770	I play whatever.
878090	880651	I was supposed to do an 80s marathon last week.
881361	883582	I sort of got bored with that and just played whatever.
883702	885883	So it has nothing to do with DDR, but it's still cool.
886163	890544	But every so often I will get a mad fit and just play nothing but Bimani just because I feel like it.
891725	893005	But the show is on Tuesdays.
893525	894646	Pre-show starts at 7.
894786	896186	The normal show is 7.30 to 10.30.
896987	905049	Although, as of late, I've just been really bored and starting the show a little bit earlier and extending it a little bit to 12.30 range.
905630	909371	So just tune in and listen as long as you can.
910160	910841	Alright, sounds good.
911902	918387	Also on this station, Monday night, tomorrow night, 7 o'clock, Diversion, which is our name for the Orange Lounge Radio Remix Show.
918727	920929	And that's where we play all these different Bomani remixes.
921290	924292	Fan-made ones, like things that were picked up in Tournamix and stuff like that.
924893	925613	All the way to, like...
926622	930986	Remix has done so well, they're professional quality, and that would be like the Diverse Systems albums.
931006	941694	We play that stuff on the show, really good Bomani remix stuff, and you know, we're going to be adding to the playlist this week because there was a new remix thing that just came out, but we'll talk about that later in the show, definitely.
942055	945157	So, we'll get to that later in the show.
945758	952964	Meanwhile, we have to start off tonight's show the way we always start off the show, because it's tradition, and that's a little segment we call, How was your week?
953044	953564	How was your day?
953584	954465	You want to say something real fast, Loki?
955709	955930	No.
956671	957713	He's looking at Anthony.
957733	959517	He has a Happy Noodle Boy shirt, which is cool.
959537	960399	Why do you do this show, Loki?
961320	962162	Because I'm here.
963905	964547	I don't know why.
965467	965807	I really don't.
965827	967789	Because you sat on the floor for all of those months.
967889	972252	I could be getting in three hours of quality Final Fantasy XI time right now.
972772	973272	And look at this.
973472	974633	Now who is sitting on the floor?
974673	975994	Who are we forcing to sit on the floor?
976334	977715	The guy that works at Konami.
977815	979076	We're making him sit on the floor today.
979096	981738	But he can sit there and pet Loki's cock.
981818	982338	It's okay.
982378	983059	He has company.
983119	985000	He has my cock in his hand, so that's all right.
986341	988342	Would you put your cock on our webcam there?
988382	991765	If you go to our webcam, www.orangelongeradio.com, it's right there on the front page.
992245	994526	Loki's going to show off his cock to all you guys so you know what we're talking about.
994747	995027	All right.
995887	999369	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1022239	1023500	Okay, you know what time I got out of bed?
1024161	1024841	Quarter after eight.
1025582	1026963	My ass was there at nine o'clock.
1027003	1027343	And you know what?
1027363	1028364	I didn't get rid of that, so it's cool.
1029485	1032027	And I just worked an extra 30 minutes, and it was all good.
1032267	1036070	So I got some extra sleep that day, but I was still tired all day.
1037331	1039333	I finished one of my fanfics today.
1039733	1040594	I finally completed it.
1040714	1043336	It's on fanfiction.net somewhere.
1044938	1045658	What kind of fanfic?
1046859	1047740	I write fanfiction.
1048260	1049341	Oh, you don't want to tell us what kind?
1050102	1050642	I write G.I.
1050662	1051243	Joe fanfiction.
1052287	1053368	A real American hero.
1053528	1053768	Yes.
1053988	1054448	That's right.
1054828	1056349	I'm also working on other stories, though.
1056369	1060531	I'm actually working on a novel, which is sort of on hold, because guess what?
1060591	1061852	I'm not going to have free time anymore.
1063232	1074178	I got my award letter from ARC, which made me all bouncy, and they still haven't freaking put my money on the stupid website, so I can't get my student loan yet, but that's okay, because in a couple weeks I'm going to have a laptop.
1074890	1075730	That'll make it all better.
1075910	1078331	Now, ARC, that's the local college here in SAC.
1078652	1079732	American River College.
1079752	1083714	Do you plan to be... They actually have a DDR machine there at the cafeteria.
1084274	1086475	Are you ever going to touch that thing, you think?
1086875	1088315	I might, but I don't want to get cooties.
1091277	1096639	My plan was to go run track on Monday and Wednesday, because my classes are Monday and Wednesday.
1097159	1099640	But I think after my Saturday class, I might go play some DDR.
1100781	1101061	Right on.
1102161	1102361	You do.
1102381	1104422	Anything else you want to say about your week in a day?
1105044	1108906	I had some angst.
1110787	1112328	I had a good bit of angst.
1114229	1115090	Very few times.
1115130	1116711	We've done this, what, 106 weeks now?
1117031	1120213	I think maybe two times you came in here not angsty about something.
1120373	1122654	Okay, this isn't angry angst, okay?
1122834	1124015	Okay, this is real angst.
1124495	1127357	This is like on the level of
1128401	1132543	It's of the same intensity as teenage high school drama angst, which is pretty intense.
1132583	1133203	Is it my fault?
1133384	1133584	No.
1133744	1134364	Oh, that's good then.
1134924	1136205	If it was your fault, I'd tell you.
1137165	1139547	I'd be like, now listen up, bitch.
1139647	1140827	Alright, good.
1141187	1151232	Oh, and yesterday, I hung out with Iguana Girl and Tia, and we turned her hair from nearly jet black to bright red.
1151252	1153273	Is this like a girls bonding kind of thing?
1153293	1157275	Girls bonding thing over low carb ice cream.
1157831	1159172	and I did something stupid.
1159993	1161234	Milk carb ice cream is damn good.
1161254	1161994	It's made with whole cream.
1162935	1163776	I did something stupid.
1163816	1164216	Look at this.
1167458	1168559	Hey, I like your hair, though.
1168679	1169420	I like it like that.
1169440	1170761	I dyed my bangs blonde.
1171221	1172382	I wish you weren't Cam Shies.
1172402	1173443	You could show the others.
1173563	1177646	They bleached out... They had to bleach out Tia's hair to turn it red.
1178246	1179747	So I was like, hey, bleach my bangs.
1179767	1180388	That'll be fun.
1180708	1184251	Except the bleach was running out of activation power.
1185191	1185411	So...
1187290	1192013	I, uh, only one side took the bleach very well and the other one's a lot lighter.
1192033	1192814	I mean, it looks okay.
1193254	1197037	Except I forgot that since I had dyed my hair black before, the ends are still dark.
1198438	1202280	I guess I could get on, this is the only time you're gonna get me on the cam, okay?
1202761	1203501	Okay, alright.
1203521	1207544	So, pass off the microphone to somebody.
1207584	1211086	Alright, we'll go to somebody else while Jamie poses on cam with the hair.
1211426	1211887	Uh, Angel.
1212667	1213328	Angel, how was your week?
1213348	1213748	How was your day?
1213768	1213848	Okay.
1214664	1215144	Pretty good.
1215764	1220285	I'm still kind of adapting to certain things, if you want to talk about that.
1221585	1222806	Because nobody really knows.
1222846	1224226	I mean, they kind of know, but they don't.
1225066	1228627	If you want to talk about that for a bit.
1228787	1229167	I don't know.
1229347	1229607	Do you?
1231547	1232807	Well, sure, sure, go ahead.
1233007	1234528	I'm sorry, I was reading some other stuff going on.
1235348	1237488	I'm having a laugh at some other stuff that I'm reading.
1239368	1240449	Hi, chat room!
1240489	1241449	Please type!
1241649	1242149	Okay, anyway...
1244677	1245478	Oh, damn.
1245558	1245818	Anyway.
1246999	1255624	Alright, so about three weeks ago, I moved out for the first time in my life, so I live here now.
1256425	1263329	And that's still very strange for me to say, but I assume I will get used to it as time goes on.
1265070	1267271	So, I don't know, that's about it, I guess.
1267912	1269373	I work here, and duh.
1270193	1271234	But it's cool.
1272586	1274407	and I live with Magus.
1274787	1275387	Everybody hide.
1277948	1280730	Yeah, the bad jokes go on and on and on and on.
1281270	1284311	And if you haven't listened to our show before, 23 Magus is always full of bad jokes.
1285472	1288013	Has he added another sheet of toilet paper to his joke book?
1290114	1293815	He's added many sheets of toilet paper to his notebook.
1294336	1297177	I wish I could sneak into his room in the middle of the night, take a...
1298522	1302707	Match and Sprint, but that would be bad because then I wouldn't have a place to live.
1302827	1307171	So, yeah, I'll just leave it in the bathroom so his brother can mangle it or something.
1308192	1309394	Anyway, okay, I guess I'm done.
1311115	1313438	Alright, let's go over to somebody else.
1314322	1316224	Brand new to the show, never been here before.
1316304	1317124	How are you doing, Andrew?
1317344	1318205	I'm very tired.
1318245	1318725	How are you doing?
1318945	1319426	How was your week?
1319446	1319886	How was your day?
1320186	1320887	Very busy.
1321227	1325249	This week was my last day working full time at my job teaching kids.
1325349	1329152	I'm very excited that I don't have to do that anymore because that was getting very stressful.
1330256	1335478	But beyond that, just doing usual stuff, especially avoiding jailbait.
1335718	1339539	I seem to have this 16-year-old fan club, which doesn't do me any good.
1339579	1341499	You know, I've heard a lot of DDR guys have this problem.
1342099	1343540	Man, I don't know what it is.
1344120	1346401	I had the same problem when I worked at Roundtable.
1346501	1353423	For some reason, the fact that I was in a shift manager position, meaning I could provide free pizza.
1353443	1354043	Yeah, there you go.
1354756	1356256	Get a lot of fangirls that way.
1356436	1361937	In fact, one that would spread rumors, because my mom worked as a yard duty at the junior high.
1362498	1367018	And so I'd hear rumors, this girl's saying that you guys are dating.
1367038	1368259	And I'm like, what?
1369359	1369979	That was funny.
1370579	1373440	Wow, yeah, it's unusual.
1374840	1380081	But I don't know what it is, if it's the DDR or what, or that I look like four years younger than I really am.
1380714	1381194	Alright, sounds good.
1405430	1411712	All right, so I guess we'll come over here then and talk to our other guest, Sigurd, as he's now known.
1412513	1413753	Why the name change again?
1413793	1414794	You had to go and change your name again.
1415294	1417114	Everybody knew who you were before.
1417334	1418595	No, not everybody.
1419755	1421536	Nobody cared before you had the flashing foot.
1421556	1422416	You were a nobody.
1422436	1423757	I was a nobody.
1425057	1429379	I changed it because I figured that would be the best course of action.
1430143	1434306	Um, apparently it doesn't matter, so, you know, I made that name for no good reason.
1435206	1435566	Oh well.
1437648	1439789	Um, so, what are we doing again right now?
1439849	1440369	How was your week?
1440409	1440910	How was your day?
1441830	1442951	Um, okay, my week?
1443131	1443571	I worked.
1445332	1446413	That's pretty much it.
1446473	1447174	That's all I do.
1447754	1448234	Every week.
1449035	1456499	Um, then, yesterday, I went out to Dave & Buster's, which was really cool because it was my first time.
1457000	1458901	So, all those people on DDR Freak...
1459502	1468749	You guys, that's probably why you didn't get anything from any of the Vivid members last night, because we were all at Dave & Buster's, getting drunk.
1469570	1471712	So, yeah.
1472752	1477176	So, I had a good time, played some games, played that other dancing game.
1477616	1479778	Oh, you mean Poop It Up?
1480418	1481419	I mean Pump It Up.
1481439	1482500	I like Pump It Up.
1482760	1483421	That's right.
1484221	1486363	Don't discriminate against the other games, it's cool.
1486463	1487664	Because you can do the pump jump.
1488584	1489266	I worked.
1489306	1489827	The end.
1489907	1489947	Oh!
1499270	1518028	and I obviously got my vivid status on DDR Freak, which I swear you guys, Friday, me and Floatwalk, if you don't know who Floatwalk is, I'm not going to tell you, we had like a laugh a minute, and you guys are seriously creeping us out with the DNL Photoshop pictures.
1518508	1522492	It was like looking at a Fark.com Photoshop contest, honestly, it was hilarious.
1523713	1524274	It was creepy.
1524901	1526484	That's really all I can say to that.
1526644	1529911	But, you know, if you happen to want to do it again, it was funny.
1530692	1531694	So, yeah.
1532556	1536042	That was my week, and today I came to Sacramento.
1537264	1537545	The end.
1538706	1538866	Loki,
1557679	1558139	How was your week?
1558179	1558739	How was your day?
1558799	1564941	Since, you know, I know everybody out there on DDR Freak really cares how your week and your day was.
1565821	1566021	What?
1566061	1567421	No, I'm looking right now.
1567501	1570162	They're all like, man, we are such big fans.
1570182	1570542	You know what?
1570782	1572182	Just don't bother playing the song tonight.
1573103	1574203	You can save that until next week.
1574423	1577124	I want to know about you guys this week and your day.
1577244	1578044	Especially you, Loki.
1578964	1579624	Especially me?
1579704	1580284	What the hell?
1580504	1582445	You make it look like I had an interesting week.
1582925	1585886	Okay, so this week what I was doing... Played Final Fantasy.
1586466	1586486	I...
1587952	1589973	Yes, I did, but that's not the point.
1591655	1593476	I did that towards the end of the week.
1593716	1595978	The beginning of the week was even better, okay?
1596318	1598900	Basically what happened was... Final Fantasy on two computers.
1600721	1600881	No.
1602122	1605764	It's too slow to play Final Fantasy, and I don't want to have to buy another copy of it.
1605825	1606805	For what would I do that?
1607426	1614991	Anyways, so I was really bored at work, like usual, so I browsed websites.
1615472	1622897	You know, when I can't browse Bomani websites because I read them too fast and no one posts fast enough for me to read everything, I browse other things.
1623277	1625739	And this week, it was theshadowlands.net.
1625799	1631143	And what theshadowlands.net is, is a big paranormal website about all, like, hauntings and shit.
1631693	1636555	So, I got this, like, paranormal kick for, like, this whole week, and basically just figuring all this stuff out.
1637275	1646258	And so now, for some reason, I'm going to bid on a supposedly haunted possessed doll that's fucked up looking, and I'm gonna buy that.
1646418	1647358	Those things are cool.
1647979	1655701	No, it's supposedly a really fucked up, real, not the pictures that I posted, like, a real doll that is supposedly haunted.
1656442	1658262	Like, and they have photographic proof and shit.
1658842	1660483	Anyways, so I'm gonna buy that.
1661195	1663897	and put it at my desk at work to creep out my co-worker.
1664437	1665238	That's the whole point.
1665638	1666258	That's beautiful.
1666358	1667719	I thought that'd be great.
1668660	1669680	So I might do that.
1669840	1670121	I don't know.
1670141	1678186	It depends on how expensive it is because I have to also fix my cabinet because I found it earlier this week because the way I have it set up, there's like some conflicts with...
1679522	1685805	Some of the controller things I have on there, so I need to buy a new keyboard encoder to get the main cabinet working.
1686345	1691747	But I've been playing lots of games, more porno games again, and kicking ass at Gal's Panic and all that stuff, because it's fun.
1692687	1694848	Oh, what else?
1695368	1695949	Oh, I don't know.
1696149	1698370	I actually had a pretty interesting weekend.
1699370	1704032	On Friday night I went to a bar and hung out there with coworkers that I don't like.
1704839	1710765	And there was a girl that supposedly asked me to dance, but it was so loud in there, I couldn't understand a word she was saying.
1711125	1713528	I heard this, outside!
1713548	1715209	I'm like, huh?
1716591	1718513	And then she kind of walked off really pissed.
1718773	1722977	And I don't know what the hell happened, and my friend standing next to me was like, she asked you to dance.
1722997	1724318	I'm like, oh.
1725699	1726299	So that was fun.
1726679	1728800	And so we did that.
1729380	1733161	And they had a giant hippo head with a bagpipe in his mouth.
1733181	1734161	So I thought that was kind of neat.
1734901	1737542	And last night we went and saw some comedians.
1737862	1741002	There was a guy that looked like Mr. Bean and another guy that looked like Ray Romano.
1741222	1741863	That was pretty cool.
1741883	1743623	Then there was this Mexican guy headlining.
1744143	1746504	And because the guy was really cool, I bought his CD.
1746544	1748884	So I'm going to give you a copy, Jamie, so you can play it on your show.
1749144	1749744	Awesome.
1749764	1751145	It's a 25-minute set of his.
1751165	1752985	I can't remember the guy's name for the life of me.
1753585	1755245	But, um, I think he was on Comedy Central.
1755265	1759826	I could've sworn I remembered his stand-up bit on, uh... It's this funny comedy, you know, I'll play it.
1760587	1766368	But yeah, he was like, there's these people that are drunk rolling, like, next to us and stuff, and he just ripped into them all night, it was great.
1767248	1776710	Um, so that's what I did last night, and then, you know, Final Fantasy XI in the middle there, so... Uh, yeah.
1777170	1779911	And then, of course, there's other things I did, but we're gonna get into that later.
1781690	1783511	More stuff I downloaded and whatnot.
1784813	1787234	Alright, my week and my day was pretty decent.
1787355	1789056	This was the first week back from the East Coast.
1789877	1792038	So I was just kind of trying to catch up on everything.
1792559	1797262	And, you know, last night I was at Dave & Buster's with Sigurd and some of the other folks there.
1797763	1802066	And I went to go play Pump It Up because they don't have any other Bomani there.
1802106	1805369	Although somebody told me they have the I Can Dance game there, the iToy game.
1806232	1809554	I'm sorry, I Can Boogie, which is basically iToy Groove in the arcades.
1809614	1811615	I could not find it.
1812015	1815117	I didn't realize it was there and I should have thought to ask Mel or somebody who goes there all the time.
1815937	1817238	Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.
1817358	1818238	It sucks ass.
1818999	1820259	Oh my god, it sucks ass.
1822761	1823441	Well, it's alright.
1823461	1824542	So fine, I didn't get to play it.
1827383	1832866	So instead I decided to play it and I realized I decided to play Pump It Up and then I realized that
1833678	1842304	I haven't really played DDR seriously in about three months or so, so I haven't really gotten any more stamina than I had before.
1842784	1845887	And, of course, Shane gets up on there and wants to play, like, Ninefooters.
1846307	1848448	What the hell was that song you made us do last that killed me?
1849669	1855133	It was Clap Your Hands on Crazy, and, you know, we were just worn out, so we didn't pass it.
1856181	1857481	I seriously thought I was going to die.
1857581	1863043	I had to go out in the parking lot and go, like, it was horrible.
1863563	1867124	So I ended up missing like an hour of some good gaming.
1867384	1871225	Some good feeding quarters into the giant crane machine because I was going to die.
1872466	1879968	I actually, I experienced the same thing you felt, except I'm really out of shape because I haven't played DDR in months.
1880588	1881388	Lots of months.
1881688	1884829	And I went and played seven footers on doubles and I was out of breath.
1885273	1888675	Like, heart attack out of breath, and that's really sad.
1888855	1895420	But, I'm working on the cabinet, it's gonna be done, DDR will be able to be played, and I will get back into shape again.
1895820	1896861	How is that cabinet coming along?
1896901	1902084	You built, now for those that haven't been listening to the show for, well, I mean, that's a lot of you guys tonight, I frankly know.
1903205	1906527	You've been building your own home cabinet, which is like your dream machine.
1906567	1908248	Tell us a little bit more about this cabinet you've been building.
1908706	1911908	Well, this thing's basically an all-in-one Bomani cabinet and arcade cabinet.
1911928	1915149	Right now, the first part of it's done, which is the main part of it.
1915189	1924373	So I have a four-player kind of control panel with two of the players having six buttons, three and four having just four buttons.
1924473	1926694	And it's basically just set up for MAME right now.
1926754	1934158	Later on, though, I'm working on a setup for DDR, Dance Maniacs, 2DX, and Poppin' Music all together.
1934946	1935787	and so on.
1956611	1965698	I was forced to do this by them.
1965938	1976086	I was forced to spend $3,000 to fix up a nice cabinet so I have working games because I like playing arcade games and I refuse to go to an arcade that has broken games.
1977458	1982002	I think that they should put all the Golfland children in a pen and put like spider stomp in it.
1982942	1984704	And just leave them there.
1984764	1986245	And we'll actually stomp on the children.
1987466	1989107	Oh, that would be awesome!
1989247	1994171	Or like a giant troubled board game instead of having dice in the middle have children in the pop-o-matic bubble.
1994952	1995912	That would be wonderful.
1995993	1997434	And they bang it and they go pop!
1997894	1999675	I wish they had like a tail at Golfland.
1999775	2002598	And how many seconds they scream is how long you get to move.
2004687	2007948	Oh my god, it's kinematic trouble in giant size, Eep.
2008628	2012370	Or how about a giant catapult with piano wire above them?
2013250	2014150	Ooooooh!
2015191	2017191	But no, if you kill them, you have to get more children.
2017671	2018832	And that means that people have to breed.
2020652	2021593	They're gonna breed anyways.
2022093	2022853	Because they're stupid.
2023153	2025314	I still think that they should make standardized testing for breeding.
2025734	2029475	Not only are they gonna breed, they're breeding at younger and younger ages these days.
2030015	2032516	There's gonna be like a baby that has a baby.
2032616	2033157	Just wait.
2033557	2034377	A ten-year-old had a baby.
2036829	2039970	I mean, it was a bad situation that produced it, but still.
2040490	2042531	I don't care what they say about the tradition...
2066383	2068444	You know, the whole Christian look of this?
2068665	2069185	Uh-uh, no.
2069425	2070626	Depends on where you live.
2070886	2072087	People are doing it early.
2072988	2082334	You see, now, if I lived in Vacaville, at least there'd be plenty of sheep and stuff, but, you know, I don't have that kind of convenience here in, you know, Folsom.
2082354	2083155	Do you love animals?
2084696	2087498	I just wanted to say about the whole little kids having kids.
2088018	2095203	My middle school, we had a couple kids there have children, and that's back in Kansas, so you know there's nothing to do there.
2095689	2098913	Let's hear it for, you know, family values.
2101976	2103137	Different strokes for different folks.
2103237	2103518	All right.
2103998	2104759	Some are stroking it.
2106080	2108603	And if more people stroked it, we wouldn't have a baby outbreak.
2108663	2108883	Anyway.
2109104	2109564	Exactly.
2109864	2113108	This is why for the whole anti, you know...
2114366	2116808	What is it they're doing in, was it in Texas, I think?
2117129	2123173	The whole abstinence, teaching abstinence instead of safe, you know, forms of intercourse.
2124094	2126756	Instead, they should just teach the joy of masturbation.
2129398	2131480	Why go out when you can get it at home?
2132421	2135323	On that note, I think we're going to go ahead and take a break.
2136184	2142909	And when we come back from this break, I definitely, and I think it's hilarious because a lot of people that are listening to this show right now are like,
2143274	2144755	Why didn't you guys play the song at 6.30?
2145135	2147436	Hey, nobody said we were going to play the song at 6.30.
2148336	2153779	We said we were going to play it during the show, which runs between 6.30 and 9.30.
2154099	2158081	And if that happens to be at 9.29, you all just have to deal.
2159121	2160642	But maybe we'll do 9.28.
2160902	2161662	We'll see.
2161802	2162082	Alright.
2163463	2164964	No, we'll get it in eventually here.
2165504	2166304	When we feel like it.
2166344	2167465	When Jamie says it's time.
2169386	2170267	Lord knows when that'll be.
2171549	2171929	All right.
2172250	2172510	All right.
2172550	2174993	But actually, no, we do have some fun stuff coming up for you when we get back.
2175554	2178177	I guess we can talk about DDR because, huh?
2178758	2178978	I will.
2179058	2179479	I will play.
2179499	2181782	We're going to do some Akira this break, actually, for those folks.
2182323	2182903	You know what?
2183024	2183304	All right.
2184434	2194820	Since everybody's been relatively good, even though there has been some shit talking on the forums out there, and that makes me a little bit angry, I guess we can do another little tease here.
2194940	2195540	How about a tease?
2195580	2196621	Do you guys want another little tease?
2197041	2197901	Go tease it, Rob.
2198082	2199302	I'm going to tease it right now, you guys.
2199322	2199642	Here it is.
2200303	2201423	Oh, that's it.
2202064	2202404	That's it.
2203745	2205546	That was a tease.
2205646	2205906	All right.
2207717	2210358	Alright, so now that that tease has been done, let's go to a break.
2210378	2212859	When we come back, I think we'll actually talk about some DDR.
2212919	2214160	Make it big!
2214220	2218442	I want to talk about how Sigurd's internet penis just grew enormous this week.
2218862	2219382	Enormous.
2220022	2221563	And people want us to talk hints.
2221903	2226545	So we're going to talk hints, or lack thereof, when we come back from this break.
2227446	2230087	And I will also be giving hints as well.
2231621	2247357	but you don't even work for Konami and you've never played- I can give him- THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVE INSIDER INFO YOU FREAKIN' MORONS THAT EVERY- THAT ANYONE ELSE CAN GET BUT YOU'RE JUST TOO FUCKING STUPID TO REALIZE THAT WE TOLD YOU, LIKE, FOUR FUCKING MONTHS AGO OR EVEN BEFORE THAT WHAT THE HELL WAS GONNA BE IN THE-
2248118	2248539	No!
2248779	2249139	That's alright.
2249179	2253244	I'm gonna tell you that I told you so, and you can just kiss my ass again.
2253585	2259912	You can blow me just like you blew me before when it came down to, you know, fucking saying, Oh, Sakura's not gonna be in DDR Extreme.
2260212	2260853	Fuck you!
2261113	2261374	Okay?
2261794	2263096	That's what I have to say about that.
2264705	2266306	Someone's full of the anger tonight.
2266326	2268628	That Loki guy screams into the microphone too much.
2268668	2269468	He screams.
2269729	2271390	He's screaming in the microphone.
2271550	2273111	Why doesn't somebody give him a drug?
2273651	2276713	Why can't he just shut up and play the song?
2276753	2277274	Just shut up.
2277314	2277814	Give us a hint.
2278094	2278595	Give us a hint.
2279916	2280796	I have a hint for you.
2280836	2281997	It's called Bite My Ass.
2283218	2284118	Now, now, be nice.
2284759	2288041	We want the listeners to come back when they realize that we're not that bad at people.
2288061	2288802	No, we're not that bad.
2288822	2289162	Really not.
2289182	2290743	We're just messing with you guys tonight.
2291003	2291363	Seriously.
2291383	2291864	Seriously.
2294361	2295961	Seriously though, just listen.
2296362	2297282	Just stay patient.
2297362	2298463	Patience is a virtue.
2298543	2299183	Be virtuous.
2300284	2302585	I know it's hard, but you can wait.
2303085	2303605	Okay.
2304085	2304366	All right.
2304386	2305886	We'll be back after some Akira.
2323644	2324304	Thanks for watching!
2363131	2364173	Thanks for watching!
2441369	2442171	Thank you for watching!
2468597	2469500	Thank you for watching!
2544122	2545066	Thank you for watching!
2646252	2647272	Thank you for watching!
2675458	2676078	Thanks for watching!
2739304	2745428	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
2766227	2772210	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
2772550	2774431	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
2775012	2779354	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
2780034	2782115	Hello, we are back with Orange Lounge Radio.
2782135	2782956	That's our buddy Mel B.
2784133	2784593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2809955	2810897	Oh, well, hell, we all need to go.
2811057	2813041	So Dan and I are going to have ourselves a hotel.
2813102	2817250	You know Konami is having a showing there at Classic Gaming Expo.
2817591	2819595	I wonder if there will be some Twinbee for me to play.
2821676	2821936	All right.
2822477	2826080	I hear that Konami's going to make a showing, but I can't say what's going on.
2826300	2830844	But I'm very glad, though, that it's in San Jose this year instead of in Vegas, because that would have been pricey.
2830904	2832386	Yeah, at least it's drivable here.
2832486	2842815	The only good thing about it being in Vegas is that I would have been able to have seen Mar and John, but I'm making plans at another time if someone has $250 to lend me.
2845996	2846336	All right.
2847597	2848318	That's a hint.
2848858	2849879	No, it's not a hint.
2849899	2850720	Jamie wants money.
2850960	2851761	That's a hint.
2853001	2858506	Be careful with the way you use the word hint on tonight's show because people are going to run with it.
2858526	2861888	You don't think I said that on purpose?
2862909	2863890	I'm teasing them.
2864070	2875659	Just so you guys know, if myself, Loki, or DarkSakura say something as a hint, we're pretty much talking out our ass because there's this little thing called NDA, called the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which means that even though our buddy...
2876215	2879436	works at Konami, he can't tell us what's going on or they will fire his ass.
2879456	2880456	We don't want that to happen to him.
2881016	2882316	No, we don't want that to happen.
2882696	2885437	But I can disclose anything I want because they can fire me all they want.
2886097	2887017	I don't work for them.
2888537	2888838	No.
2889038	2889898	I will disclose it all.
2890478	2891178	Everything.
2892618	2893498	Everything.
2894799	2895959	But no, it's surprising.
2897599	2901220	This information's been out forever and people just don't realize it.
2902048	2903609	I can't think of anything.
2904829	2919354	What we can talk about, I can mention this, is that a few months ago, and you can go back in the Orange Lounge Radio story archives, and you can look at, we had a story that talked about how some folks were hacking the disk for DDR, what disk were they hacking back at that point?
2920871	2921692	It was probably a collection.
2922132	2923153	And there's a master list.
2923713	2924574	Okay, here's how it works.
2924874	2931178	When they're making the games, there's a master list of all the songs that have been in all the games and that are going to be in all the games.
2931338	2933640	Well, basically, whatever they're working on up to that point.
2933720	2935081	It's just a master list.
2935121	2939124	Think of it like, if you're familiar with MAME, there's a master ROM list.
2939204	2940705	Okay, well, this is a master song list.
2940745	2949331	So, it's going to contain everything from the arcade versions, the home versions, and home versions that they're working on at the moment.
2950072	2950252	So...
2951232	2976499	Here's the thing right now, as I said before, you know, there's some songs in there that they, you know, they're all, oh, those are, you know, you know, don't believe that, because, you know, back in the day when DDR Max was first coming out, and remember there was that Orion Civilization, supposedly remix of that, but it was just under a different name, well, everyone's like, oh, well, those lists are wrong, and then they're saying, oh, well, Nemesis is supposed to be in Max 2 or something like that, or
2977660	2977980	D.D.R.
2978060	2978541	Extreme
2992296	2994419	I agree that it's a dumb name.
3010313	3011875	Okay, it's a dumb name for a song.
3011895	3013857	That's so fucking wrong!
3013897	3017220	And then there it was, you know, all in its piece of shit glory.
3017240	3018882	This is where we point and laugh.
3018922	3026190	No, but there are songs, I mean, a lot of songs actually that are in there that are going to be in, you know, extremes.
3026250	3028893	So, I told you so.
3030603	3035184	I'm actually trying to find that list from when we posted it.
3035524	3039866	We were posting that list, and I distinctly remember that Diving was in that list.
3040186	3042686	It has been confirmed that Diving is going to be in DDR Extreme.
3042706	3043386	That's no secret.
3043427	3044047	Four Strings Diving.
3044307	3051929	Because I remember we were talking about that list on an earlier show, and I saw Diving, and I said, oh, that's another song on that Four Strings album, so Diving must be in there.
3052129	3054069	Come to think of it, that was also in the pre-show.
3054389	3055170	It was on the CD.
3055430	3056150	Yeah, there you go.
3057030	3058951	Alright, okay, so...
3060311	3065655	I'm going to dig through the archives a little more and we'll go through that list again and we'll see, you know, maybe there's some song titles in there.
3065855	3066396	But you know what?
3067476	3069698	Is Konami capable of throwing red herrings our way?
3069758	3070178	You bet.
3070278	3075102	Do you think that there are songs that are supposed to be in DDR that don't make it into DDR in the final cut?
3075322	3075842	Absolutely.
3076303	3076883	Yes, there are.
3077083	3079485	And there are songs that get, you know, cancelled.
3079525	3083188	Like, for example, DDR Ultramix, The Humpty Dance.
3084529	3087271	Okay, I would have dug it if The Humpty Dance was in DDR.
3088812	3089252	Been awesome.
3089829	3090103	Alright.
3090566	3092866	But how would you make steps for that and get it to look right?
3093126	3097567	We'll come back to this subject a little later, but I wanted to keep things moving.
3097647	3098687	I actually wanted to talk to Andrew.
3098727	3102108	He's sitting there in the corner, and he's never been here before.
3103168	3104148	Are you enjoying things so far?
3104548	3105269	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3105489	3107249	It seems like everybody wants to talk to me.
3107449	3108489	You came on a good night.
3109329	3112770	Everybody heard you were going to be here, and now our caps are breaking and everything.
3112810	3116670	That's what I heard, and I'm really happy that I can contribute like this to your show.
3116690	3117291	No problem.
3117491	3118411	You should come here more often.
3118611	3119011	I should.
3119111	3119851	I appreciate it.
3120111	3126294	In all seriousness, for those who don't know you, you're the guy, and the reason why I wanted you to be on the show is because you dress up like a pirate when you play DDR.
3126394	3126714	Yes.
3127035	3127455	Why?
3127695	3128115	Why?
3128335	3132097	Well, at first it started because I'm just a massive attention whore.
3133018	3133878	I mean, honestly.
3135639	3137500	But, uh, I don't know.
3137520	3145324	I mean, I got there, and I just started playing, and some people would watch, but I was never a freestyler because I'm too white for that shit.
3146224	3147465	Basically, I just was like,
3148263	3154766	I just stopped off at some party store after work one night, bought a cheap pirate costume, went into Golfland.
3154786	3157267	I noticed I turn around and there's like 40 or 50 people.
3158507	3163109	There's like 40 or 50 people watching me, so I'm just like, okay, I'll keep this up.
3163149	3165510	So I just kind of whore it around in my signature now.
3166010	3169372	I'm a Toadie007 on GameFAQs, DDR Freak.
3170052	3171893	Get a hold of me on the NorCal forums.
3173052	3173753	Johnny Depp Fetish
3196531	3199315	No, it was just an inside joke with some people at work.
3199335	3205485	I have a friend that owns a production company called Shiver Me Timbers Productions and it kind of went off from there.
3209033	3211415	I brought that thing into work the other day.
3211475	3215797	My boss apparently lets me dress up like a pirate for work, so I thought that was kind of cool.
3216017	3217538	Now, we all know the Roseville Golf Line.
3217558	3221060	When you go to play DDR there, there's something that we call the hecklers, or the assholes.
3221180	3224362	All these people there that make fun of you when you're playing DDR.
3224942	3225543	Fag!
3225743	3227944	You look like a fag when you play that game!
3228264	3228905	You're a fag!
3228965	3229625	Oh wait, you're a chick.
3230166	3231486	You're a fag!
3231786	3235989	I get that anyway, even when I'm not playing DDR, but you know those people, they can kiss my ass, I don't care.
3236229	3237209	But how bad is it?
3237229	3238490	I mean, what's the worst you've heard?
3238550	3241991	Dressed up, not only playing DDR, but being a pirate playing DDR.
3242011	3243031	What are some of the things you've heard?
3243351	3246692	Ironically, I don't think I've gotten any shit for the pirate thing.
3247212	3247552	Really?
3247652	3249933	If anything, I get shit when I bar rape.
3250813	3254354	I thought you guys were going to cue up a boo sound effect when I say that.
3254374	3254414	No.
3254434	3255795	Because I get heckled on the show.
3255875	3255975	No.
3257347	3261954	No, the pirate thing, most people just kind of go up and go like, what in the hell is that guy doing?
3262114	3269364	Because, I mean, you can see the little strings on the beard, you know, it looks totally fake, you know, but I don't really get anything.
3269404	3272889	It just confuses the hell out of most people, so they think it's kind of funny.
3274161	3278042	and it really ticks off all the good freestylers because nobody pays attention to them.
3278082	3279643	Wait, we have good freestylers in this town?
3279663	3280323	No, I'm just kidding.
3280343	3281623	Oh, okay.
3281663	3283103	That's totally a joke.
3283123	3284024	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
3284524	3285444	Oh yeah, yeah.
3285704	3289325	There's no way I'm serious there.
3289565	3292226	Are you going to take the pirate to any DDR tournaments in the future?
3292626	3293326	I will try.
3293366	3295907	I've only been to like two so far and I got...
3296267	3296607	All right.
3296748	3297148	All right.
3297188	3297729	Sounds good.
3297749	3299570	There's supposed to be a big one in Milpitas...
3319332	3319972	Friday?
3319992	3321973	I don't know, it's like an improv tournament, I want to say?
3321993	3324154	Yeah, I have a wedding on that day, actually.
3324234	3326175	I have my alter ego I wanted to take out for that.
3326476	3327156	Oh, okay, okay.
3327196	3329337	But I don't think I'm going to be able to do it, which is too bad.
3329377	3330097	Thank you.
3330337	3332378	Do you know if it's in the afternoon or at night?
3332398	3333319	Yeah, it's like a night.
3333519	3335860	It's a Friday night, which kind of sucks for you if you're out of town.
3335880	3337001	I don't get those Friday night things.
3337041	3340983	But sometimes you have to do a tournament when you can do it, when the arcade owner says you can do it.
3341023	3342683	If it's a Friday night, I might be able to do it.
3342723	3345065	I'm not going to enter, but it'll be all good.
3345445	3345745	All right.
3347648	3353850	Um, okay, so, um... Anything else you wanted to share about... Oh, is there anything you want to plug while you're here?
3354250	3356131	You know, when guests come on talk shows, they plug things.
3356151	3356971	Is there anything you want to plug?
3357671	3358772	You said you had a production company?
3359132	3359992	No, my friend, my friend.
3360032	3361973	You did a DDR video recently, didn't you?
3362533	3364273	Yeah, I was in a DDR video.
3364794	3366194	I whored that onto my live journal.
3367358	3369099	I'm just a cam whore, I guess.
3369219	3374164	I don't know if you want to give out that link on your live journal, but... Do you want me to give it out in the chat room?
3374525	3375466	Go for it.
3375506	3377007	I'll give out the video link in the chat room.
3377067	3380551	I look like shit in the video, but still, you know, I don't care.
3381192	3384435	The more people that know my name, the bigger my ego gets, so... Right on.
3384815	3385356	It's all good.
3385796	3386517	Right on.
3386978	3387899	Andrew, by the way...
3389685	3398248	If you want to join our chatroom, just head on over to www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com, you can check out the camera while you're there, and then you'll just click on chat.
3399188	3412513	And if you have a friend who's trying to get into the station to listen to us, because we have such a great show and it has nothing to do with the Your Rain song whatsoever, your friends want to hear Andrew talk some more, we are going to play that song again at 9.40.
3412593	3416454	And Andrew will talk some more, maybe then too.
3417054	3419035	Oh my god, we have more than one Andrew now.
3419095	3419835	Everyone hide.
3420036	3420636	I know, I know.
3420696	3421316	It's horrible.
3422077	3422357	All right.
3424258	3425278	Oh, I found the link here.
3425518	3432482	It looks like it's shivermetimbersproductions.com Yeah, my friend John, who was a colleague of mine at work, he produced that video.
3432742	3434263	I owe him a lot of lunches for that.
3434423	3436344	So go ahead and check his site out.
3437985	3438245	All right.
3439502	3442383	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3460546	3464529	This stuff I think I posted was just the licensed tracks that I recognized.
3465589	3471633	This is a story that was posted on May 7th on our website, and you can go back into our archives and have a look.
3472213	3477497	And these were the songs that were on the master song list that we speculated could be in DDR Extremes.
3477517	3482980	This is nothing new, and certainly Shane is not going to confirm or deny anything and break his NDA, but...
3485251	3489492	Actually, if you look at it, since it is licensed stuff, you guys already know what it is.
3490792	3497334	So, yeah, hey, the ones that you see that you know are in the game, they are totally in the game.
3497974	3500335	Alright, the ones that are in the game, they are definitely in the game.
3500755	3508277	So we have on there, Simply Being Loved, which we know is in the game, Diving, we know that's in the game, Ride on Time, I don't think we ever figured out what that one was, did we?
3509137	3509857	Don't know about that one.
3510117	3513338	Come Into My World, which makes me think of the Kylie Minogue song.
3513769	3520536	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3537893	3540816	Planet Rock, that did turn up in Extreme, we do know that.
3541317	3549965	The Boys of Summer, DJ Sammy Song, we had Heaven and Max 2, we thought we'd get it in Extreme because it was on this list, but haven't heard about it yet.
3550386	3555231	Humpty Dance, they're saying was possibly something that was coming over from Xbox, don't know.
3555851	3558314	And Mickey, so we don't know.
3559475	3560076	Don't know.
3561097	3561217	But...
3562637	3578413	But what we do know is that in our chatroom it was said by one of our folks, I think it was Mel B over at DDR Spot, did say, hey guess what guys, if you're trying to find the list to Ultramix 2, which has, I think he said 46, I'm sorry, I'm going to look for what he said, where is it?
3580686	3581286	I don't know what he said.
3581307	3586010	It was something like 46 more songs that have not been in DDR before.
3586210	3587291	Is it 56?
3588011	3588172	Okay, 56.
3588352	3590273	56 more songs that have not been in DDR before.
3590894	3591314	Wow.
3592315	3594336	And none of them are on that master list.
3594536	3596898	So don't even bother looking, because they're not on there.
3597378	3597959	So forget it.
3598459	3598839	Nice.
3599740	3600921	Of course he could be just throwing us off.
3601121	3601621	Is that a hint?
3601742	3602282	Is that a hint?
3602402	3603463	Are you guys dropping a hint?
3603483	3604004	Is that a hint?
3604024	3605805	Is that 56 mean something?
3606166	3607827	If you flip the 6 upside down, it's a 9.
3607887	3609349	Maybe it's a Japanese character.
3609629	3610490	Well, here's the thing.
3610530	3611771	Here's the thing about that.
3612292	3617837	There's been a big, huge span between when Party Collection came out and when these new mixes are coming out.
3618277	3621020	So obviously, you know, there's going to be a lot of stuff that's not on there.
3621514	3639368	and I mean there's a lot of stuff that would be on there this is just stuff that they were developing a while back so there's a lot of work being done right now on it so it's not surprising that there's not a lot on there but there's some other ones that were not licensed songs that were on the master list that I've heard might be in there
3639989	3656432	So, um, I'm not saying anything, but, uh, there was stuff that we knew about a long time ago, and I think I even quoted on the show seeing what the songs were a long time ago, but, you know, I can't see now because, uh, my balls are tied.
3656592	3659833	So, you know, I just, I cannot say anything.
3660193	3660853	But, that's it.
3665154	3665514	Alright.
3666826	3668087	I feel like doing another tease.
3668147	3668767	What do you guys think?
3668807	3669668	Let's do another tease.
3671770	3672630	Let's tease them again.
3672930	3673571	Let's do it.
3673851	3675352	We're going to do it soon, you guys.
3675752	3677894	We have to make this last, alright?
3678394	3681897	We only get to have fun like this, what, once every 106 shows?
3682117	3682437	Yeah.
3682477	3683838	You guys won't listen to us otherwise.
3684238	3685459	So we have to tease it now.
3685599	3685760	Yes.
3686740	3687361	Yes, a secret.
3688141	3700550	And you know, after he plays, I'll probably get to have this little one-on-one chat with him, so if you guys are just sticking around for the Your Rain remix, you might miss out on some other stuff.
3701850	3702891	I want to chat with you first.
3703251	3705913	I want to get that stuff over with, because I have to get something out there.
3706914	3708455	Man, I've got to set some people straight.
3709295	3710736	So then forget what I said.
3711597	3713958	You guys can leave right after that song plays.
3715139	3716040	Or no, you can't.
3717781	3719302	Alright, hold on, let's tease.
3721243	3721803	Okay, that's enough.
3722044	3723405	That was pretty sexy, I like that.
3723425	3724625	That was very sexy.
3724906	3725206	Alright.
3725906	3728708	It sounded like you touched my something, yeah.
3728748	3731450	You touched my... Oh yeah.
3731770	3732791	I think she said boob.
3733231	3734172	I think she said boob.
3734212	3735533	How many DDRs are going to love that?
3735573	3736413	You touched my boob.
3736433	3736834	Okay.
3738663	3744346	For everyone that enjoyed our pre-show, we had porn on the webcam, but no one seemed, I don't know if anyone paid attention to that.
3745806	3747247	I knew I should have got here earlier.
3749768	3755411	Alright, we will get to it soon, but first, I want to talk to our buddy Sigurd.
3756811	3757992	Do you want to go to commercial first?
3758572	3762994	Alright, Sigurd wants to go to commercial first, so we can, you're gonna, you're pissing off the chat room.
3765485	3768226	All right, when we get back, we're going to talk to Sigurd.
3768266	3771026	We're also going to do some Bomani match game tonight.
3771407	3775587	And then maybe we'll do the song, but maybe we'll have a cage match before that.
3775607	3775867	I don't know.
3775887	3776188	We'll see.
3776248	3776588	We'll see.
3776748	3777868	Depends what time we're at.
3778308	3778828	We'll have a look.
3779168	3779488	I don't know.
3779608	3781609	God, some people are going to kick our ass if we don't do it soon.
3783629	3784189	That's right.
3784309	3785289	You can wait at how long?
3786170	3787950	You can wait a few more minutes for us, guys.
3788550	3789350	Come on, it's for us.
3789430	3790050	Yeah, come on.
3790230	3790891	Come on, guys.
3790991	3792051	You're pals, Sky.
3792171	3792951	Be good, sports.
3795461	3804316	There will be a song, holy shit, a song in DDR Extreme that will have mix in the title.
3808663	3809504	That was an awesome hint.
3809644	3809964	All right.
3811265	3816550	Let's go to what I think was probably most people's favorite Akira Yamaoka song previously.
3816690	3817290	Like a lot of people.
3817310	3819572	It's kind of a stereotypical favorite Akira Yamaoka song.
3820073	3820553	But I don't know.
3820613	3822315	Tonight, guys, I might change for you guys tonight.
3822355	3822675	We'll see.
3822975	3824877	But from Night Style, let's take this break.
3824957	3825718	Lionski.
3825818	3826198	Enjoy.
3826719	3827039	All right.
3880225	3881030	Thank you for watching!
4008823	4009464	Thank you for watching.

4257012	4258634	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
4293138	4302496	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
4303224	4307327	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
4307347	4308328	Can we talk about that?
4308588	4310929	No subject will ever be taboo.
4311229	4314852	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
4315392	4317914	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
4318434	4323778	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
4324338	4325619	I collect your fucking head.
4327583	4329084	Just like this fucker here.
4330164	4333845	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
4334145	4337506	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
4338446	4344908	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
4346089	4349890	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
4353851	4355532	Welcome back, Orange Lounge Radio.
4356454	4370736	And you know, I have to say, if you haven't figured it out, I'm kind of reading the DDR Freak thread on Xtreme during the show, and about the last four pages have been people talking about this show, and it's really starting to piss some of your moderators off.
4371878	4373279	Sorry I'm not there to help.
4373379	4375040	I'm contributing to the problem.
4375060	4375680	Stop spamming DDR Freak, please.
4375700	4376821	I don't want to have to go clean up.
4392270	4400196	Some of the moderators over there aren't exactly happy cappers right now because you guys have hijacked the thread, so please steer things back on course.
4400216	4401337	We do have forums of our own.
4401377	4403759	Nobody posts there, but hey, you know, you could be a trendsetter.
4406060	4406721	Yes.
4408102	4408502	Maybe later.
4409323	4411264	Alright.
4413442	4413823	Moving on.
4414544	4414985	Let's see.
4415366	4416789	I said I wanted to talk to Sigurd.
4417009	4418432	So let's talk to Sigurd.
4418753	4419193	Yes, Loki.
4419374	4420576	You said moving on.
4420857	4422640	That was another song in DDR.
4423863	4424664	Could it be?
4425931	4431832	Again, I don't know shit about what is going to be in Extreme or Ultramix 2 or anything down the line.
4432272	4436233	Even if I did know, I don't know as far as you're concerned, okay?
4437193	4437933	That's it, alright?
4438374	4439914	Alright, moving on.
4441294	4441534	Again.
4442714	4443695	Uh, Sigurd, how are you?
4444275	4445275	I'm doing pretty good.
4445335	4448816	Alright, so, no secret now, you're a Vivid member on The Freak.
4449176	4449896	That I am.
4449996	4452697	So that must mean... I work for Konami.
4452777	4454397	And what exactly do you do at Konami?
4454757	4454777	I...
4455663	4457343	Go to work for Konami.
4457743	4458404	That's what I do.
4458984	4460324	Are you allowed to talk about what you do there?
4460444	4460764	You know what?
4460844	4461604	I have no clue.
4461764	4464665	And since I have no clue, I'm going to say I work for Konami.
4464825	4465145	Okay.
4465185	4465445	All right.
4465485	4465745	Fine.
4465845	4466185	Fair enough.
4466365	4466605	All right.
4467065	4469646	But, well, you make a lot of money, right?
4469666	4470566	So you must be doing... No, I'm kidding.
4470686	4472407	I wish I made a lot of money.
4473067	4473387	All right.
4473427	4473767	So fine.
4473787	4474847	We can talk about what you do.
4474907	4479328	But you do have to come in contact with DDR Games at some point through your job.
4479928	4481689	That's why I have the Vivid membership.
4482349	4483309	Alright, alright, fine.
4483610	4485530	No, okay, let's talk about life before Konami then.
4485670	4485750	Okay.
4485770	4486651	You were on the show before.
4486671	4488011	Are we getting a backstory?
4488211	4491473	Yeah, but you've been on the show before, but nobody was listening then.
4491493	4492513	But now people care tonight.
4492533	4493453	Nobody cared then.
4493473	4496214	People seem to care tonight suddenly about this show for some reason.
4496254	4498035	I can't, for the life of me, imagine why.
4498095	4498635	I don't know why.
4498875	4500576	What exactly were you doing before Konami?
4501296	4504137	I worked for EV Games back in Kansas.
4504798	4507118	That's right, I'm from the Midwest, so...
4509013	4512098	Yeah, I worked there, and then I came out here.
4512739	4515283	The end, I guess.
4515443	4516425	What possessed you to come out here?
4517467	4519650	I had been wanting to move out here for a while.
4519690	4522795	Like, I'm originally way long time ago from here, but...
4523959	4527162	Yeah, I moved to Kansas, then I decided, hey, Kansas kind of sucks.
4527762	4528703	Because it really does.
4530145	4531526	So I moved out here.
4532307	4533007	Alright, fair enough.
4533628	4538272	And how, now, I don't know how much you can or can't say about this, but how did you get the job at Konami?
4538552	4541975	Because a lot of people want to know this, like, oh, I want to work in video games, I want to play video games all day.
4542396	4547340	How do you, and I'm sure that's exactly how you would describe some of the jobs there, right?
4548221	4548901	Yeah, sure, right.
4549842	4550002	How...
4550683	4551723	That's pretty much how it works.
4580009	4583731	All right, so you went to a company, and you applied, and who knew it?
4583771	4584312	They hired you.
4584352	4584852	Exactly.
4585052	4585833	What were they thinking?
4587193	4588514	They obviously don't know me.
4588934	4594198	Now, since you do come in contact with some DDR games, you guys like to have a little fun on some of the big message boards.
4594238	4596319	Of course, the biggest one that comes to mind, the Freak, right?
4596539	4596799	Yeah.
4597039	4601462	So you've been posting lately in the thread, and what do you hope to gain from posting in this thread?
4602523	4602703	Um...
4603800	4609241	I hope to gain just pretty much some laughter, because that's what I've been getting.
4611482	4615763	And I think what it's really doing is creating a lot of hype for the game.
4616443	4629666	And if you had been on the DDR Freak boards, gosh, maybe before Friday, because that's when we all started coming into contact with the boards, it was really not a very happy place.
4629786	4630406	But you know what?
4630867	4632687	I think everybody's starting to realize, you know,
4633311	4636992	This is DDR, this is why we're here, and we're going to enjoy it.
4638273	4642574	So, I mean, people seem to be having fun again, instead of just complaining.
4644155	4645575	Yeah, I notice people are having fun with it.
4645896	4646916	Especially all the photoshops.
4646996	4648677	Oh my god, the photoshops.
4651797	4653399	You were just in the bathroom, I'm sorry.
4654299	4654940	Look at this, look at this.
4655680	4659023	DarkSakura kicks our guest from Konami out of the chair so she can sit down.
4659083	4659523	It's beautiful.
4660084	4662666	Alright.
4663646	4665288	She's motioning for Sigurd to come sit on her lap.
4665328	4666429	I think you should go sit on her lap.
4666589	4669251	I would, but you might punch me.
4670832	4672513	Sigurd's afraid of being punched by DarkSakura.
4672533	4673774	Come on, DarkSakura loves you.
4674174	4676176	DarkSakura, tell him you love him.
4678037	4678898	Like a hole in the head.
4680951	4681291	I love you!
4681351	4682012	I want fanboys!
4682152	4684294	I don't want fangirls, I want fanboys!
4702365	4703085	Oh, I see.
4703285	4705306	So, come on, step it up.
4705546	4707107	You and I have something in common, I see.
4707607	4708007	Alright.
4709127	4712248	And if you've listened to this show for the past 105 episodes, you know what I'm talking about.
4712549	4716630	But for those of you that are just listening tonight, I don't feel like telling it again.
4716750	4718110	So, you'll just have to be in the dark.
4718611	4719451	So, yeah, anyway.
4721536	4723698	DDR Freakboards, what were we talking about?
4723818	4724579	Yeah, DDR Freakboards.
4725199	4728242	This thing, it happens every time there's a new mix, Konami puts out.
4728422	4729463	Every time there's a new mix.
4729864	4736310	The first mix, Konomics, all the way back there to DDR Max, Max 2, there's this thing called Hints.
4736790	4742636	And we all know that a while back, Jason Enos, like back during comics days, used to come on the thread and drop hints about what was going on.
4742676	4745919	And then, you know, some other folks picked up the slack for some of the later games.
4746040	4747121	Death Tricks, Cryptic.
4747161	4748622	Some folks you guys don't even know, right?
4748662	4749183	Exactly.
4749203	4750384	You work there and you don't know who they are.
4750404	4750844	Exactly.
4750904	4751285	Exactly.
4752347	4757129	So, because if we knew who they were, they'd probably have a Vivid foot next to their name.
4757289	4766433	So now it comes to the point where you post as a Vivid member, not just any Vivid member, but one that works for Konami, you post anything and somebody assumes it's a hint.
4766493	4766733	Yes.
4766913	4769994	It has to be a hint, you must be talking about a new song.
4770054	4770515	Exactly.
4770615	4775157	Because that is what you want to do more than anything is spoil your NDA.
4775437	4777097	Yes, I really want to get fired.
4777718	4780679	I mean, these people, I'm glad they're picking up on that.
4781587	4787151	Alright, so, how many hints have you posted in the DDR Freak thread thus far?
4787491	4795557	DDR Freak listeners, we, as a collective group, have posted exactly zero hints.
4795917	4796658	Zero hints!
4796998	4799400	But, but, maybe that was a hint.
4800320	4801741	No, no, seriously, no.
4802082	4806845	Oh, zero one was in seventh style, he was the, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, you guys, zero one's in it.
4807225	4808166	But, yeah, I mean...
4810191	4812332	I posted this earlier on the thread, you know.
4812732	4813452	But it was ignored.
4813872	4814253	Of course.
4814893	4815433	I don't know why.
4815493	4816794	I have a flashy foot by my name.
4816894	4817394	Listen to me.
4817574	4826937	So wait, but I seem to recall that one of the other folks over there posted a picture and it had like a party collection bucket and like a Max 2 thing.
4826957	4829118	It had like extreme samplers there.
4829558	4832720	And, oh, would you hold up the extreme sampler for the camera?
4832960	4833500	Can you do that?
4833740	4836262	Somebody else can, or I guess I can.
4836542	4837763	Yeah, we'll have to see.
4837843	4838664	I'll do it during the break.
4838684	4839504	Yeah, we'll do it during the break.
4839524	4840185	We'll do it during the break.
4840405	4843847	Because it's like way over by the camera, and I don't feel like going by the camera.
4843867	4844488	Well, you can hold that.
4844508	4845068	Yeah, hold that.
4845088	4845929	That's the same size.
4845949	4846629	That's not it.
4846649	4847330	That's something else.
4847630	4848451	It's close enough.
4849551	4849832	All right.
4850752	4852253	But yeah, that picture.
4854655	4856396	Is that a porno you're holding up, or what?
4857457	4858478	A Fahrenheit 911.
4859358	4862461	No, that picture, you know, with the party collection bucket and all that?
4862501	4862721	Yeah.
4863432	4866698	It was a picture with the party collection book and whatever else.
4868342	4870947	I said, it has nothing to do with anything.
4871894	4872855	It's the V rare.
4873115	4874475	So, wait a minute.
4875436	4883940	So that picture with the party collection and the tip jar and everything, that's basically just you guys showing off that you have a humongous internet penis right now and you're not afraid to whip it out.
4884120	4884620	Exactly.
4884700	4884920	Yeah.
4885580	4885820	Okay.
4885900	4887401	We're very family oriented.
4887441	4888061	Just curious.
4888321	4890162	So the picture meant nothing.
4890522	4891983	There are no hidden clues in that picture.
4892863	4897325	As a friend, you're swearing to me there is no hidden meaning in that picture because we go way back.
4897846	4898586	We go way back.
4898606	4900167	I'm holding it up right now.
4900187	4900927	Oh, you are holding it up?
4903319	4903819	Stop it!
4903859	4905040	Now you're even fucking with me!
4905540	4905860	All right.
4907940	4909941	I swear that there were no hints.
4910341	4914483	Now, granted, you guys can't see me, so I could be crossing my fingers or something.
4914503	4914663	Oh, stop.
4915503	4920124	But, no, I said on the boards, you guys will figure out when we are actually giving hints.
4920865	4923586	If I say we're not, we probably aren't.
4924026	4924766	If I say we aren't,
4925379	4926060	We could be.
4926320	4927301	That's what keeps it fun.
4927702	4930325	Alright, but seriously, there's no hints.
4930385	4932848	Seriously, in that picture, there are no hints.
4933148	4935511	When the hints start, you guys will know, right?
4935551	4936833	When the hints start, you will know.
4936993	4938535	And does that mean you're going to give us a hint tonight?
4939276	4939456	No.
4939856	4940477	Right.
4940537	4940657	No.
4940918	4941058	No.
4941358	4942459	I'm sorry, guys.
4942680	4945343	I know that you guys are hoping to come on here and hope for a hint, but...
4945663	4948304	because there are these things called the Dawn Disclosure Agreements.
4948324	4951125	He can only say what he's allowed to say and we're not allowed to say anything else.
4951426	4952026	But you know what?
4952066	4954047	We got the song and that's enough for me right now.
4954067	4954987	That's more than enough.
4955347	4957708	So certainly we can't give out any more hints.
4959269	4962170	Certainly I couldn't give out anything else because I don't know what the hell else is in the game.
4965072	4966912	So apparently there's porn in this, Mitch.
4968313	4968873	Oh, was that a hint?
4969053	4969954	That could have been a hint.
4969974	4971014	Is it erotic?
4971474	4972335	Oh my gosh!
4972875	4973655	Erotic's in it!
4973755	4974296	Oh my gosh!
4975596	4978559	Thank you for watching!
4997165	4997926	Thank you for watching!
5018226	5019327	I did not know it was him.
5019447	5021148	I was reading through the thread, I'm like, who's that guy?
5021448	5022869	And I didn't even realize it was him.
5023430	5024811	That's how secretive you've been being on there.
5024871	5026572	I didn't even know it was you, but of course I was just being stupid.
5026592	5028753	People who know me, there's two dead giveaways.
5028994	5030915	One, I talked about my hair in the picture.
5031255	5034337	I always talk about my hair, because I love it.
5034678	5036259	Two, I said sadness.
5036499	5037820	That's another trademark of me.
5037840	5039321	Yes, sadness, I should have known.
5039341	5040962	I should have known.
5042143	5042403	All right.
5044924	5052330	Okay, guys, I think what we're going to do now is I think we're going to take one quick break here, and then I think we're going to do a Mamani match game, maybe.
5052490	5053771	Let's do the cage match now, actually.
5054672	5056953	Let's do that.
5057914	5059736	Let's drag this out as long as possible here.
5060616	5065200	Anything else you want to say to your adoring boys and possible fangirls out there, Sigurd?
5066321	5071985	Just keep reading, and we'll be posting stuff as we normally do, and love me, please.
5072846	5073106	All right.
5073564	5078766	So show Sigurd a little more love, and maybe he'll start dropping those hints later, if you'll show him some love.
5079246	5084928	Okay, as soon as I queue it up here, we're going to get into the Orange Launch Radio cage match.
5086248	5092710	The cage match, for you guys that have never participated before, you need to be in our chat room, www.orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat.
5093499	5096721	All three songs in their completeness because there's so many new people.
5097142	5104367	I'm actually thinking, I think we ought to, since there's so many new people, I think we ought to make an exception tonight and play the entirety winner from last week.
5104387	5105548	Because it is a really good song.
5105788	5106329	I mean, either way.
5106469	5106969	Why not?
5107270	5107630	Why not?
5107890	5108751	So we're going to do that.
5108791	5110292	We're going to be special because it was Loki's winner.
5110332	5116677	Anyway, the way the Cage Match works, we pick three songs, each host picks a song, and they're usually big dance hits or guitar hits or something.
5116857	5122161	They're kind of songs that we think may make good Bomani selections, or we just think they're really cool and we want to play them for you guys.
5122601	5123162	You guys vote.
5123182	5124502	Or we want to torture you sometimes.
5124743	5126544	Sometimes we want to torture you, like when Jamie brings J-Lo.
5126564	5127945	I should have picked Britney Spears this week.
5128085	5129166	Or Britney.
5129506	5136691	But the thing is, you're going to pick your favorite of the three songs, and that winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5136791	5138832	So there's definitely a prize to be won here.
5139193	5144556	Now, last week's winner is actually pretty cool because it's a remix done by our very own Loki.
5144916	5148319	And he remixed this song, you might know it from DDR, called Ecstasy.
5148379	5149960	And it is an excellent remix.
5150200	5151301	It's won two weeks now.
5151841	5154662	And if it wins for four, we're going to have to retire it, so it's halfway there.
5154722	5156283	Let's see if it adds one more week on.
5157323	5160945	But oh yeah, I've got to have the cage match music, huh?
5161585	5173669	Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match... Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki won with his pick, it's Ecstasy.
5173709	5175290	And what did you remix this with here?
5176190	5177891	Explain what a mash mix is real fast.
5179881	5183383	Well, if you're listening to most of the stuff that's out there, it's crap.
5183483	5193468	But, uh, you know, MashMix is just basically just, um, taking two songs, not necessarily going, um, you're basically cutting loops and, you know, remixing it that way with loops.
5193568	5201992	But, the problem with a lot of people is it's gotten a really bad rap because, you know, people just throw one song on top of it and another, you know, basically mixing it in gold wave.
5202832	5204053	It sounds like utter crap.
5204133	5208435	So, hopefully, you know, this stuff's a little bit better than crap.
5210492	5211778	This song should be in DDR.
5211919	5212461	End of story.
5212562	5214129	I seriously think this song should be in DDR.
5216250	5217731	Eh, it's okay.
5218312	5224397	But anyways, yeah, this is remixed with the actual trance artists that got me into the whole genre in the first place.
5225117	5244793	Tomski, with his song 14 Hours to Save the Earth, one of the only two songs he's ever done, the other one being Love Will Come, and he was pretty popular back in the end of the 90s, beginning 2000s, and he just kind of doesn't really make anything anymore, just some remixes, but you'll basically see him a lot with the Disco Citizens and...
5245473	5250036	Decane, and also you see stuff with Dan Johnson and stuff like that.
5250157	5252338	He kind of hangs around with that clique.
5253399	5254099	Alright, here it is.
5254280	5255160	Less talking, more playing.
5255180	5255480	Here it is.
5255741	5258463	Atomski vs. D-Complex with Ecstasy.
5258483	5259844	14 hours, club mix.
5259984	5260224	Enjoy.
5442691	5461164	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match, Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix, and I think it's hilarious, because the people who can't hear the show right now are just in our chat room, and they can only see what we're posting, and I posted, you know, as I always do every week when we play the Cage Match songs, I posted, song one, Ecstasy, 14 Hours Club Mix, and somebody's like, oh my god, they're announcing the song list!
5463507	5464747	Awesome, awesome.
5465468	5468048	Alright, no, that is not a song that's going to be extreme.
5468068	5470429	That was a fan song, and it's song number one you can vote for tonight.
5470729	5475131	Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is brought to us by DarkSakura.
5475151	5475871	What did you pick tonight?
5476311	5478972	I picked something by someone.

5484314	5485414	I know what I picked.
5485534	5486334	Oh yeah, it was low.
5487034	5488535	With the moves.

5492341	5492722	Alright.

5496304	5497805	Yes, Enflo is in DDR.
5497905	5498226	Alright.
5499306	5502368	Enflo with Astro Sexy, song number two in tonight's page match.
5502769	5505391	And if you like this, you can vote for it after we're all done here.
5505411	5505831	Enjoy.

5856362	5861024	Now the whole, I have to say that the whole CD altogether isn't all that great, but it has some awesome tracks on it.
5861604	5865645	And that one, it just, it keeps getting interesting, it keeps changing it up as the song goes on.
5866106	5868166	So it's a real progression through the whole song.
5868567	5869387	And I really love it.
5869407	5870787	So I'd have to say that one gets a 10.
5871188	5874409	It's not Taku yet, but you know, it still gets a 10.
5876591	5876951	Angel.
5880212	5888196	I don't know, to me it sounds like Daft Punk kind of dancey so I really liked it.
5888657	5889257	I'd say 9.8.
5893772	5898035	I don't know why I'm going to do that, but I guess it's because I can.
5898535	5904260	Um, I'm sorry, Jamie, but it just stole a whole bunch from me.
5904980	5905501	It was okay.
5905561	5906661	It was a good song.
5906761	5908283	I just like the style.
5908923	5911245	Um, I don't even know if it's my style.
5911285	5912806	I'm slow, actually, but...
5914008	5916029	As far as the progression, I liked that.
5916069	5917289	I thought it was interesting.
5917309	5918570	I was like, what's going on here?
5918630	5921571	Because I could tell something was changing in the song.
5921991	5925632	And it's definitely got that, what do you say, dark punkishness.
5926332	5929153	I was thinking of Move Your Feet that those guys do.
5929613	5930333	So, yeah.
5930393	5931034	Yeah.
5931514	5933854	You're a senior.
5934595	5936275	So I'd have to give it maybe a 7.
5936435	5938816	A good song, but not my style.
5939056	5939316	Right.
5939336	5940357	Good song, not your style.
5940377	5940357	7.
5940577	5941777	Sigurd, what did you think?
5944636	5945196	Cagematch?
5945516	5946137	That's what we're doing?
5946697	5948298	Yeah, were you even listening to Emplo?
5948518	5950298	Yeah, because I remember commenting on it.
5950378	5950699	Alright.
5952479	5953160	I've heard that song.
5953240	5953920	I really like it.
5954080	5954480	It gets a 9.
5955221	5955581	Alright.
5955921	5956781	Is it going to be in DDR?
5959082	5959782	Maybe.
5960003	5960963	Alright, Loki.
5962944	5963644	That was awesome.
5963724	5964284	I loved it. 10.
5966590	5967650	Yeah, you know, it wasn't that bad.
5967750	5969931	Usually I'm kind of am with them flow, but that was fun.
5970071	5970611	I give it an eight.
5970771	5971311	I give it an eight.
5971431	5972231	Fun songs get eight.
5972471	5972791	All right.
5973411	5975392	Our other voter is in the show.
5975672	5975952	That's right.
5975972	5976432	You know what?
5976552	5978052	We're not the ones who get to pick the winner.
5978072	5986174	You guys do out there in listener land, and I'm sure you have nothing better to do while waiting for your reign, which we will get to in like 15 minutes.
5986354	5988614	We will make sure that you vote.
5988875	5990795	The more votes, the faster we'll get there.
5991735	5992555	No, we'll get it.
5992595	5993356	Alright, one more song.
5993396	5994996	Let's get to the last song then.
5995516	5999757	My song, my pick this week is a group you also know from DDR, Four Strings.
6000618	6003239	And they have a brand new single and it's called Turn It Around.
6004319	6005899	And so that's going to be my pick for tonight.
6006119	6006559	So enjoy.
6006579	6008120	This is Four Strings with Turn It Around.
6009380	6013001	Turn it around baby Spend my time with me
6023220	6035966	Turn it around baby Spend my time with me It's getting insane I know Let it not be true Turn it around baby
6081761	6082202	Thanks for watching!
6176938	6177559	Turn it around
6229032	6232956	Alright, welcome back, that was Four Strings with Turn It Around, the last song in tonight's Cage Match.
6233056	6234237	Janie, what'd you think of that?
6235818	6239841	It was... It was good.
6241563	6250570	It was, it's trancy, you know, and I'm sort of, kind of, I mean, even though I went and downloaded this whole trance compilation, I'm just sort of tranced out a bit.
6250931	6257056	I mean, I've been listening to a lot of trance lately because of when I'm writing my stories, it's easier to listen to trance while I'm writing.
6257665	6258426	It was very good, though.
6258466	6259326	I love four strings.
6259366	6260867	I'd have to give it about an eight and a half.
6260887	6261808	Alright.
6262868	6264129	Andrew, what did you think of that one?
6264209	6264549	Pirate.
6264989	6265970	Our local pirate.
6266330	6267671	Oh, he didn't vote in the last... Oh, he's gone.
6267751	6268131	That's alright.
6268412	6271794	Yeah, I've been in the bathroom for the past three songs.
6271814	6272094	That's alright.
6272114	6273294	I have no idea what's going on.
6274155	6274895	Okay, that's fine.
6275596	6275896	Angel.
6277997	6278458	I'm stuck.
6278578	6279118	Okay, hi.
6280859	6282260	Jeez, I'd probably say...
6283169	6293673	and Ace, because, I don't know, I like the tranciness, I could probably, I don't know, go into the club, and I have no idea where I'm going with this, never mind!
6293973	6294474	Alright, on 110?
6295474	6296274	Oh, I'm sorry, I missed that.
6296434	6297335	Holly, it's either you or Holly.
6297615	6312801	Hey, um, I like it a lot, I'm into trance, um, uplifting trance is, uh, kind of a newer, happier kind of thing that's going on, um, so for uplifting, I guess, I think it's categorized as that anyway, it's pretty good.
6313317	6313637	I give it a 9.
6313897	6320460	I'm into Darker Trance, but it's good.
6320700	6322160	I heard that song earlier today.
6322820	6324221	I really don't like it, I'm sorry.
6324241	6329263	It's not as good as Diving, which might be on Xtreme, except it's already been announced.
6329323	6330683	I think it is on Xtreme, Sigurd.
6330723	6333884	Even I do that, and I don't work for them.
6334445	6334965	I give it a 4.
6336425	6336885	Aw, you suck.
6336945	6337446	Alright, that's fine.
6337466	6337786	Loki.
6339167	6339567	I don't know.
6339667	6343849	It was pretty good, but not as good as that trance remix that's on DDR Extreme.
6343989	6344109	Oh!
6344429	6344569	Oh!
6344890	6345030	Oh!
6346270	6347151	Of another song.
6347891	6348672	Another song!
6348852	6351113	There will be a trance remix of another song!
6352674	6353774	Uh, oh, where were we?
6354214	6356836	I'm gonna give that a, um...
6358519	6359239	No, I can't do that.
6359320	6360420	That would be too obvious.
6360440	6361121	I'm going to give that a 7.
6361281	6363842	I'm right here.
6364843	6365183	All right.
6366444	6369626	I think it's really a great song, even though it is a little bit repetitive.
6369726	6370406	But I love it.
6370426	6370406	9.
6370807	6371347	Is that a 9 in... Oh, a 9.5?
6373268	6375450	Is that a 9 in the German sense? 9!
6380276	6382418	Alright, let's recap and then you guys can vote.
6382458	6383038	Here we go.
6383318	6385880	And remember, you can only vote through private message.
6386181	6389063	If you post something public in the chatroom, it is not counted.
6389103	6390564	You have to send a private message to Sky.
6390604	6393767	Do not flood the chatroom with your vote or I will come over there and punch you.
6394087	6394387	Alright.
6394928	6396028	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6396068	6398570	We have to get the paddle and spank.
6399551	6400232	Alright, here we go.
6400512	6403094	Song number one, Ecstasy, 14 Hours Club Mix.
6409944	6418557	Alright, song number two tonight is M-Flow with Astro Sexy Song number three in tonight's cage match is Four Strings with Turn It Around
6434809	6436451	All right, there you go.
6437752	6443717	Send your vote over private message to Sky, and I'm going to type in the chat room how to do that real fast here.
6447781	6449622	Are you okay there, Jamie?
6449882	6452425	Do you need to regulate something in the chat room?
6453325	6458050	No, just make sure all of you in the chat room do not try to send anything to Bimonicade.
6458510	6460271	That is the name that we're all using.
6460331	6461953	It's our personal slut name.
6462597	6463798	We've been humping it all night.
6464038	6466180	Secret's been on there, but it's actually our machine.
6466200	6466500	I was on it too.
6466520	6468041	Oh yeah, you were on there too, DarkSakura.
6468081	6470343	I was on there too, and Andrew was on there for a little bit.
6471144	6473246	Don't send anything to BinMoneyCade.
6473266	6474607	No DCC chat, no nothing.
6474687	6477869	Please don't initiate DCC chats, because that's not the way we can do the votes.
6478330	6480672	Just double-click to open up a window, and it'll work that way.
6480692	6482573	I'll send the message to Sky.
6482693	6484915	You're talking to my arcade cabinet, okay?
6485075	6488518	It will not respond back or accept any files.
6489278	6491160	It's merely there for arcade enjoyment.
6494829	6496551	I'm actually going to open up the Skype line.
6496591	6499874	We're very close to playing your reign.
6499894	6503758	I think I just want to get it done and over with so that, you know, folks will stop bugging me about it.
6504458	6507281	But I do want to open up... Huh?
6507942	6510584	Yeah, I want to get some opinions on DDR Extreme thus far.
6510664	6511225	So Skype...
6511565	6512506	Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
6534158	6534558	Hello.
6535999	6536679	Can you hear us?
6537219	6538060	Hey, Skye's up.
6538900	6540121	Yeah, I can.
6540161	6541261	You're dropping out, dude.
6542081	6543322	Do you have porno torrents going?
6543342	6543962	You gotta close them.
6544963	6545183	Nope.
6545563	6546443	Don't have any going.
6546803	6547164	Alright.
6547524	6548984	You're very spotty right now, though.
6549084	6551545	Make sure, uh... You okay?
6552966	6553706	Can you hear me fine?
6555247	6555967	Aw, we lost him.
6556688	6557208	Aw, we lost him.
6558288	6558368	Aw.
6558448	6559049	That's a bummer.
6559449	6560789	Alright, I'll try it one more time.
6560809	6561910	We'll see if we can get somebody in here.
6561970	6562010	Aw.
6563271	6566332	That's what happens when you get the... Oh, we'll try one more time.
6566393	6566793	Same person.
6566833	6567733	Hi, you're on Orange Zone Radio.
6567753	6567873	Hello?
6568373	6568794	Can you hear me?
6569074	6569894	Yes, we can hear you now.
6570434	6570915	Okay, good.
6571575	6573736	I think because I had AIM on, I was dropping out.
6573776	6574096	Who is this?
6574136	6574516	There you go.
6574556	6575137	This is Richie.
6575617	6576237	Hi, Richie.
6576597	6577078	Hey, Richie.
6577318	6577378	Hi.
6577398	6577938	How you doing?
6577978	6578418	Hey, people.
6579259	6582160	Just want to give out a few P's about Xtreme.
6584001	6586522	I'm pretty excited for it to come out here to the U.S.
6586702	6592045	Just going to check out the whole new itoy support, whatever they're going to have for it.
6592403	6611888	but the main thing I'm mainly excited about is they're bringing Love Love Sugar to the US, so I heard about Love Love Sugar yes, I know, now the greatness of Noria shall be spread throughout this country there you go yes, okay, I'm not ashamed to admit it, I am a Noria fanboy right I want her to have my children
6614201	6621045	Richie, do you have anything you want to say to us for withholding on this Your Rain thing for like two hours now for some people?
6621826	6622466	Are we jerks?
6623247	6624387	Is this what you'd expect from us?
6625268	6627809	Well, I mean, just be patient, you know?
6627829	6632172	I mean, just because we're going to play a new song doesn't mean we're going to play it right at the beginning of the show.
6633273	6638516	And for the people who keep asking us to drop hints about what song is going to be on Xtreme or what new songs, you know,
6640324	6641865	They can't say anything.
6641905	6643205	It's the same thing.
6643265	6643805	Disclosure.
6644665	6645986	Disclosure thing that they have.
6646146	6650107	So basically you're saying, you know what, there's a reason you're not getting hints yet.
6650567	6652087	There's rules.
6652548	6652988	The man.
6653088	6653928	It's the man.
6654028	6654788	Blame it on the man.
6655268	6655488	I know.
6655548	6658969	All I have to say is they'll tell you when they can tell you.
6659169	6660210	So, you know, just wait up.
6660230	6660730	We'll be good.
6661090	6662370	Good things come to people who wait.
6663851	6664151	Alright.
6664511	6665431	Alright, well thanks for calling.
6665871	6666631	Alright, have a good one.
6666671	6667312	Bye.
6668472	6668972	That was fun.
6669386	6670106	I'm glad to hear from him.
6671206	6671526	We'll see.
6671626	6673967	I'll give the other folks a chance to call just a minute here.
6677687	6684369	So, yeah, we're going to do that debut of your reign, and then we'll go to Bomani Match Game.
6685169	6687329	I think we haven't done that in a while, so I want to get to that.
6687409	6689469	And then we're going to go to the FUs of the week.
6689490	6691210	We're going to have to kind of make it fast this week, though.
6691830	6694390	We may have to limit our chatroom FUs, especially with so many people listening.
6694410	6697291	We are going to guard our angst for you.
6697591	6697891	Yeah.
6698612	6705839	Again, if you guys have friends that are trying to get in and listen to the show and they can't get in right now, we will play the song again after the show at 9.40.
6706380	6708402	And there might be other surprises, too, at that time.
6708442	6712146	So stay tuned, and we'll get that for you after the show.
6712887	6717152	For anyone listening in the chat room, please make an announcement for us that we will be playing the song again after the show.
6717392	6721293	All right, yes, we'll play it again at 940 so those that weren't able to get in now can get in.
6721353	6726113	All right, nobody else is calling on Skype line, so I think maybe it's about time for us to get to it.
6727154	6728094	You've waited long enough.
6728154	6729794	Yeah, you guys have waited long enough.
6730094	6738056	But first, I want to just give some shout-outs about this because I do definitely want to thank the folks at DDRSpot.com.
6738636	6742436	I haven't said their name enough tonight, but they have helped us out in getting this premiere for you guys.
6742456	6744657	Thank you very much to the staff at DDRSpot.com.
6745017	6746597	Also, the KDEA team.
6746997	6747938	has been very helpful.
6748498	6749639	Some of our folks at Konami.
6749939	6754763	So Sigurd, give them big kisses and hugs for us here at Orange Lounge for getting this for us.
6755879	6756139	Okay.
6757460	6758401	Alright.
6758641	6763946	And just thanks a lot to you guys because, you know, it helped us get a lot of exposure.
6763986	6766568	We've been doing this radio show for about two years now.
6767048	6770411	And some folks are just finding out about us tonight, even though we've been doing it for two years.
6770491	6771111	And you know what?
6771131	6773994	It may not be your cup of tea, but hey, thanks for checking us out.
6774034	6776676	But if you did like us, we do the same shit every week.
6777476	6778898	Every Sunday we do our talk.
6778998	6781760	Some weeks we don't have a song to be teasing, so it's even crazier.
6782591	6785035	Thank God you weren't here for the show where I sang.
6785215	6785536	Okay.
6785956	6786998	That was bad enough.
6787539	6788220	You're staying in?
6788581	6791425	We do have Karaoke Revolution 2 we've still got to cover at some point.
6792350	6793011	All right, all right.
6793131	6797475	But seriously, also keep in mind we've got our remix show on Monday, Diversion.
6798055	6798756	Mm-hmm, definitely.
6798776	6802199	Which Rob is gracious and has fun with.
6802439	6802659	Yeah.
6802939	6809925	And then my show is on Tuesday where if you're hanging out in our chat room, then whatever you request, Bimani or not, if I have it, I'll play it.
6809965	6812768	And you can even send it to me if you really want to hear it broadcast on the show.
6813008	6813328	All right.
6813448	6814830	As long as I don't think it's a piece of crap.
6815350	6815630	All right.
6816791	6817611	I'm flexible.
6817771	6818271	Don't suck.
6818331	6818631	I'll play it.
6818651	6819972	Maybe you'll play your reign again.
6820392	6820732	Maybe.
6820752	6821512	Maybe we can work that out.
6822013	6822393	Maybe.
6822793	6829155	And then Wednesday, coming back very soon, Vanilla Sky, my show where we talk about random video game stuff.
6829215	6830556	We just have to retool it a little bit.
6831256	6832096	But hopefully soon.
6832196	6833517	I might do something this week.
6833557	6833937	We'll see.
6834117	6834437	I don't know.
6835618	6841080	And maybe sometime in the future, I'll do my show.
6844449	6846297	That's a very, very, very...
6849825	6860554	There's a .5 chance, somewhere around the 99 area Cut it out, cut it out Alright, anything else anybody wants to say before we do it?
6860574	6866038	This is our big moment you guys, we're never going to have this captive audience ever again So anybody want to say anything?
6866378	6874925	I have an important announcement Yes I like alcohol And I like meat Does anybody need to come out of the closet here on the show?
6876624	6880026	Loki just, oh, Loki is actually running in the closet.
6880946	6881206	Alright.
6882247	6884448	Um, yeah, I have something.
6884468	6884708	Rob?

6891691	6891971	What?
6892031	6892251	What?
6892411	6896112	We are forgetting the... Oh, Jesus.
6896132	6896873	That was scary.
6896893	6898213	It was in unison.
6898253	6899134	They're getting restless.
6899154	6900114	They're about to punch us.
6900414	6902035	They're about to punch us in the face.
6906198	6907319	Alright, alright, here we go.
6909080	6910121	Forget it, forget it, alright.
6911062	6911882	I love you.
6911902	6912743	Alright, you guys ready?
6914264	6914764	I'm ready.
6914864	6915445	You ready to hear this?
6916445	6916765	Alright.
6918747	6923050	Alright, we are going to do right now the world debut of Your Rain, The Rage Mix.
6923310	6924411	So enjoy everybody.
6926993	6934058	Your Rain, The Rage Mix, made possible by www.orangeloungeradio.com and www.ddrspot.com.
6934218	6934478	Enjoy.
6940575	6942493	Thanks for watching!
6999782	7000683	Thanks for watching!
7018649	7019789	That was sexy!
7020009	7024871	I can't believe people have been waiting like two and a half hours for that one minute song.
7025191	7025912	But there it is.
7026152	7029093	It's actually a minute twenty-nine is what that song clocks in as.
7029333	7030493	What did you guys think, DarkSakura?
7030673	7031413	It was sexy.
7031473	7032434	I still like the original better.
7032454	7033154	But it was sexy.
7034554	7035195	It was hot.
7036275	7037095	It was very hot.
7037275	7037936	It was hot.
7038056	7039736	It's like, slow.
7040877	7042517	It's my favorite Akira song, hands down.
7042537	7044098	It's my favorite Yamaoka song, hands down.
7046359	7046619	Cool.
7046859	7047379	Yeah, I agree.
7048947	7049488	What do you guys think?
7049608	7055812	Andrew, you haven't really been, I don't know how much you've been following this fandom or how big a DDR fanboy you are, but what did you think of that?
7056172	7057533	Well, I like that song.
7057553	7059314	I think it's going to be pretty interesting to play.
7059514	7064778	It sounds slow as hell, so I'm definitely going to have to bar-rape that at like 5x or something when I play that.
7064958	7067980	Or excuse me, chair-rape that at home, I guess.
7069601	7071982	But yeah, that sounds pretty good.
7072002	7072483	I like that.
7072523	7073903	It sounds interesting.
7075585	7076245	Alright, Angel.
7076570	7081913	Yeah, like he just said, I'm totally going to have to speed mod that because I really suck at slow songs.
7083994	7085114	Well, I speed mod.
7085454	7087575	I don't know if that makes me a loser or not, though.
7088476	7091718	Since I call myself DDR Angel, maybe I shouldn't speed mod anymore.
7093378	7094079	Okay, I'm not funny.
7095399	7097700	DDRholic.
7097881	7101342	I can see Wendell freestyling to this right now.
7101762	7103543	It's a very freestyling song.
7103964	7104564	I can see the...
7105004	7109006	I can see the butt shots and the kisses and everything.
7109306	7110206	The video is great.
7110226	7113747	We were able to actually see the video at E3 and play the song and the steps.
7113787	7114828	The steps were pretty good, I gotta say.
7114848	7116208	I think it was only like a six, but it was fun.
7117029	7121590	The video, they made a custom video for it based around Silent Hill characters.
7121830	7125252	And I gotta say, you guys, if you haven't looked at our picture gallery... It was a good video.
7125292	7126772	Look at the picture gallery on our website.
7126792	7127633	Just sign up for our website.
7127673	7128013	It's free.
7128053	7128893	We don't send you spam.
7129593	7131094	Sign up for the website, and there's pictures.
7131194	7132194	Dark Sakura has a gallery.
7132274	7133095	I have a gallery, and...
7133835	7135156	Sigurd even has a gallery on there.
7135176	7135977	It says Mikla Tavit.
7135997	7137258	It's actually Sigurd's photo gallery.
7138219	7139279	All these pictures from E3.
7140020	7152029	Also, just to expand upon the video information, in the video you'll see Cynthia from Silent Hill 4 and Henry from Silent Hill 4, and then some backup dancers, and they are not in Silent Hill 4.
7153050	7154811	There is no dancing in Silent Hill 4.
7155052	7161777	Unless you count writhing as dancing around when you're being eaten to death.
7162617	7166859	You've actually seen the video for the song in a lot of these preview videos.
7167920	7172042	I do wish, though, that there were dancing in Silent Hill, because then I could have Pyramid Head dance.
7172242	7173402	That'd be the best thing ever.
7175243	7178685	I would like to see the disembodied heads in the wheelchairs dance.
7179445	7184787	I know some of you guys are probably dropping the stream right now, so I just wanted to say to you guys that are related to two hours ago that, hey, check us out again sometime.
7184907	7189189	I hope you guys enjoyed it, and check us out again sometime, and thanks for stopping by Orange Orange Radio.
7189369	7190289	The show's not done.
7190309	7195791	We still have an hour left to go, but I know there's some people that didn't want to have to sit through all this to hear that song, but you did, so thank you.
7196011	7201333	What does our resident arcade building genius think of it?
7202554	7203654	Because we didn't ask his opinion.
7204535	7205375	Yeah, what did you think, Loki?
7206940	7207080	Eh.
7208662	7223494	You know, I think, you know, it's, uh, yeah, it's nice that Akira Yamaoka's doing songs and, you know, remixing them for DDR, but eh, I don't care for that stupid fucking, um, was it just shit?
7224035	7228198	Um, I don't know, I don't care for that R&B crap that they have right there.
7228539	7232522	Um, you know, give me a good, um, Akira Yamaoka hard, um, heavy metal, um,
7232842	7262505	Fucking track from Contra That's the shit that I want in DDR You know, fucking hard heavy metal guitars Yelling, screaming, none of this I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor Look at me dancing, I'm a remix of a song It's really stupid, I want the heavy metal I mean, that's the shit that I want in there Fuck, if they had a, you know, a US Guitar Freaks That would be awesome There will not be a US Guitar Freaks, just
7262932	7263652	They're making that clear.
7266113	7266453	All right.
7267073	7268193	I think we're going to go to a break.
7268313	7270474	And those of you guys that wanted to drop, go ahead.
7270494	7271174	So the other people can get in.
7271194	7272714	Remember, we are going to play the song again a little later.
7272734	7274854	We're going to do a Bonnie match game when we come back.
7275195	7275715	Let's do that.
7276135	7276435	It'll be fun.
7276475	7276775	Yay, match game.
7276795	7277515	All right, we're going to do that.
7277675	7278995	And I'm going to tell you guys who won the cage match.
7279035	7279856	I'm going to tally up those votes, too.
7279876	7281476	I'm going to do something really cool during the break.
7281616	7281936	What's that?
7282136	7282696	Fold my laundry.
7283076	7283516	Have fun.
7284016	7287617	And in this break, I think we're actually going to play songs from Max 2 USA.
7287797	7288397	I think that'll be fun.
7288417	7290178	So we're going to play some Max 2 USA songs.
7290478	7291478	Because, you know...
7292603	7293324	I feel like hearing them.
7293365	7294346	Don't you guys feel like hearing them?
7295147	7295808	Yeah!
7295828	7296750	Yeah, sure, alright.
7297411	7299394	Yeah, so let's hear those songs, and we'll be back.
7340425	7342526	I heard you were alone
7373098	7375701	I heard for the first time I knew we were meant to be
7398382	7402706	Will I ever love you again?
7405228	7409572	Will we be together again?
7412054	7416198	Thought the love we had was strong
7417856	7422159	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7474059	7474940	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
7518379	7543192	Take me away, millions of miles away from here Take me away, find a place for you and me You're taking me higher, high as I could be Take me away
7545578	7549419	Forever you and me Take me away
7599091	7608381	Hey, I'm happy.
7608421	7609982	A lot of you guys decided to stay on.
7610022	7612265	Thank you guys for listening to us and supporting us.
7612285	7613306	That makes me a happy boy.
7614468	7614708	You're happy!
7614728	7617490	This is the precursor to Mad Libs, honestly, if you think about it.
7633394	7662076	basically we have two contestants in this case we're going to have somebody from one of our listeners call in on the skype line and then our newest guest on the show be our contestants basically you're going to be read a sentence and at the end of it the one word will be replaced with a blank and you have to fill in the blank of course the object is as it's called the match game you have to match us while we think of something and no the answer is not propel alright
7662564	7663105	You know what?
7663205	7665207	Every game, the answer was always Propel.
7666107	7667408	And I don't drink Propel anymore.
7668089	7670731	Propel is no longer a sponsor of Orange Lounge Radio.
7672573	7675155	We're now sponsored by Dr. Atkins, even though he's dead.
7676716	7677577	I don't know about that.
7677677	7679779	I can't say I'm into that, but okay.
7679999	7680520	Well, I don't know.
7680580	7682922	Because of that, there's less of me to be here.
7686004	7687085	That and working my ass off.
7689321	7694125	I've been trying to find the match game song clips because I lost it when I did my reinstall.
7694145	7696566	It's been that long since we've done match game, I've got to say.
7698008	7699489	We need a new match game theme.
7701550	7703352	Okay, do the match game theme.
7703372	7703692	No, no.
7703732	7704392	Porn music.
7704532	7706134	Play porn music because it's the same difference.
7706294	7708916	Okay, then I'll find some porn music.
7708936	7710137	Play the Price is Right music.
7710377	7711938	I don't have the Price is Right music.
7712979	7714960	Does everybody get a piece of paper and a pen?
7715000	7715841	I hope you guys have that.
7717401	7720003	Here, I'll play some erotic, that's close enough.
7723365	7723805	That'll work.
7725306	7726947	This is our new match game theme song.
7727588	7728449	Sex on the phone?
7729009	7729229	Yes.
7730270	7731030	Dear Rob.
7731571	7733872	You might have to rip this up into little pieces.
7734132	7736534	Now, Andrew doesn't get a piece of paper because he's going to be our contestant.
7737014	7741738	And for contestant number two, we're going to open up the Skype line.
7742438	7744640	And we'll see who gives us a call over on the Skype line.
7745931	7747933	I'm going to write all over Hello Kitty's face.
7748133	7748734	You should do that.
7750335	7751696	I'm hoping somebody will call on the skyline.
7751716	7755180	If nobody calls on the skyline, we're going to have to take one of our chatters, and I don't know if I want to do that.
7755240	7756721	Somebody's got to call us on the skyline.
7759464	7760545	Oh, no, that piece of paper?
7760765	7762466	It has clues as to what's in Extreme.
7764728	7765369	Let's see.
7765789	7766590	Oh, shit.
7766790	7768732	I'm writing on the back of the Extreme V-Rare.
7768792	7769213	My bad.
7771236	7772216	I've got a copy list.
7772296	7775698	It says milk, cheese, butter.
7776198	7776918	Hello, can you hear us?
7776938	7777678	You're on Orange Sounds Radio.
7779339	7779679	Hello.
7781579	7782380	Hello, hello, hello.
7784400	7785401	We cannot hear you.
7785581	7786121	Sorry, buddy.
7787250	7787870	Dismissed!
7811674	7813115	Oh, much better.
7814155	7814535	Much better.
7814575	7815135	Can you hear that?
7815275	7815435	Oh, God.
7815455	7816656	Yeah, I can hear that.
7816676	7816896	All right.
7816936	7817476	Turn it down.
7817516	7817896	Turn it down.
7817936	7818416	Turn it off.
7819496	7819776	All right.
7820377	7820817	Here we go.
7821177	7822157	Question number one.
7822197	7823958	You know how the match game works, right, Richie?
7823978	7824238	Yeah.
7824518	7824738	All right.
7824798	7825438	I know how this works.
7825458	7825998	All right.
7826018	7826378	Here we go.
7827439	7828659	Question number one.
7830099	7831980	Jamie was sick and tired.
7832340	7833760	You know her also, DarkSakura.
7834941	7835781	Yes, you have to do this too, Loki.
7836397	7844179	DarkSakura was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad when she would try and play DDR.
7845420	7848761	One day, one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.
7849741	7852582	Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you, kid.
7853302	7853622	Blank.
7857823	7859304	That's when you play a song.
7861905	7863205	You have to think of what would be in the blank.
7864744	7865164	Now we can't.
7868908	7875034	Jamie was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad when she would try and play DDR.
7875795	7878858	One day one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.
7878878	7881461	Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you, kid.
7882302	7882662	Blank.
7890714	7891054	All right.
7896297	7896637	All right.
7896697	7897277	Who's in ding?
7897317	7897637	I'm in.
7897878	7898418	Who's not in?
7898518	7899098	Amy's still working.
7899718	7900019	All right.
7900359	7901259	You're all still working.
7901299	7902680	You got ten seconds.
7904161	7907182	All right.
7908983	7909323	All right.
7909363	7909624	All right.
7909704	7910244	Stop the music.
7910264	7910644	Let's see.
7910844	7911124	All right.
7911304	7912105	Richie, you still there with us?
7912765	7913085	Yeah, I am.
7913205	7913486	All right.
7913566	7913886	Richie.
7914915	7920700	Jamie was getting sick and tired of all the children that would run in between her and the pad when she would try and play DDR.
7921160	7923762	One day, one of them tripped right in front of her as they tried to run by.
7923802	7926305	Jamie looked at the child and said, I've got one word for you, kid.
7927185	7927406	Owned.
7928326	7928767	Owned!
7929908	7931409	Alright, Richie says owned.
7931469	7934451	Let's see what his opponent, Andrew, has to say.
7934652	7936994	Andrew, I've got one word for you, kid.
7937014	7937114	Owned.
7937634	7937914	Jamey
7957990	7960551	Oops is not a match.
7960611	7961091	Sorry.
7961592	7963933	DDRholic, what did you say?
7963973	7965013	I'm not too creative today.
7965413	7966033	Doctor.
7967074	7968054	Doctor.
7968334	7969955	Okay, that would be the nice thing to say.
7970015	7971476	Unfortunately, the question was about Jamie.
7972176	7973577	Everybody boo DDRholic.
7973617	7974797	Boo.
7974857	7975597	I'm just kidding.
7975657	7976498	I wouldn't do that.
7976618	7977258	Angel.
7977938	7979439	I got one word for you, kid.
7981000	7983241	Incomplete, DarkSakura, FashionEye Die!
7983861	7984382	Die!
7985622	7986082	Die!
7987223	7995647	Die, alright, let's see Sigurd, you're playing knight I got one word, and maybe it's a hint, you guys No, you know what my battle cry is
7996621	7996841	What?
7997061	7997701	Die of Death.
7997901	7998261	Die of Death.
7998582	7999822	I got one word for you, kid.
8000242	8001622	Move your feet in extreme.
8001662	8002043	Yeah.
8002063	8002943	Alright.
8004783	8005383	Alright, alright.
8006024	8007804	Sigurd, I've got one word for you, kid.
8008164	8013186	I came up with hardly anything, so I went with propel, even though he said it's not going to be it.
8013266	8013846	Propel.
8013866	8014566	It was propel.
8015146	8016207	Alright, propel.
8016227	8017027	Alright.
8017067	8019467	Loki, I've got one word for you, kid.
8020508	8021028	Classic.
8022754	8023515	I would say that.
8025196	8026878	I said, I've got one word for you, kid.
8027579	8028099	Abstinence.
8033064	8033884	That's beautiful.
8034345	8035506	No, no matches.
8035806	8036267	No matches.
8037928	8040150	Was that your second answer, Richie?
8041331	8042212	What?
8042512	8043994	Abstinence, was that your second answer, maybe?
8044354	8045755	No, but more like...
8047011	8048632	Haha, or I don't know.
8048652	8049853	I'm not feeling creative tonight.
8050013	8050473	That's alright.
8050793	8052174	Alright, let's go on to question number two then.
8052734	8053715	Alright, it's all tied up.
8053835	8054475	Nothing, nothing.
8054515	8054975	Here we go.
8056296	8056996	Second question.
8057196	8057857	Get the music ready.
8058517	8058857	Alright.
8060098	8068822	Loki was getting sick and tired of the fact that whenever Andrew went to Golf Land dressed as a pirate, he got all the crowds watching him play DDR.
8069763	8075206	In order to upstage him and get the attention back, Loki decided to show up dressed as a blank.
8078678	8079740	Oh, this is going to be a stink.
8098897	8100577	That music for some reason makes me want chicken.
8119042	8122185	I'm going to say Barwinch, because I think he'd make a very sexy one.
8122405	8123086	Barwinch!
8123586	8125327	Barwinch is Andrew's answer.
8125347	8128190	Let's see what the competitor Richie has to say.
8128610	8130832	Dressed as a... French maid.
8131132	8132353	French maid!
8132373	8136337	Well, gee, this is a... That's a surprise coming from Richie, alright.
8137217	8138418	Let's see if we've got a match.
8138999	8142422	Jamie, dressed as a... I finally saw this, so you'll laugh at me.
8143408	8150432	Dressed as Divine's role as Edna in Hairspray Very nice, dressed as Divine, and nobody in the scene is ever going to get that joke, but that's okay.
8151113	8157977	DJaholic, Loki's going to show up dressed as... An Oscar Mayer wiener!
8158778	8159498	You're gay!
8162920	8164021	And it's okay for me to say that.
8164381	8170565	Alright, Angel, show up... Okay, this is completely unlike me to say it, but I got to just because it's playing on words.
8171147	8172768	I said he would dress up as a cock.
8173409	8174490	No, not that one!
8174890	8176571	Dressed up as a cock, alright.
8177112	8177592	Sigurd.
8178793	8182836	Sigurd, Loki, in order to upstage him, showed up dressed as a penis.
8183317	8183777	Penis!
8184458	8187040	You could have gotten two points going for the dick joke.
8187120	8188901	Alright, Loki, what would you have to do?
8188921	8194906	You'd have to show up dressed up as a... I'd have to dress up as Osama Bin Laden because he fucking rocks at DDR.
8197148	8197408	Wow.
8198354	8198995	Wow, okay.
8199035	8200596	Well, that would certainly get you attention.
8201136	8202057	Or as a Nazi.
8202137	8203438	A Nazi would rock, too.
8204299	8211084	Or if we could combine them all, we would have to have, like, a white hood with a turban and then maybe a swastika painted on that.
8212025	8214947	It could be like the, uh... The Antichrist.
8215508	8219971	I don't know, the, um... Yeah, I... I don't get it.
8220111	8220512	Yeah, whatever.
8220732	8221272	That was stupid.
8222113	8224615	I'm sorry for wasting your 30 seconds.
8226152	8230175	I said in order to upstage, Loki would show up dressed as a crack whore.
8230776	8232637	And when in doubt, crack whore, you guys.
8232737	8233197	Crack whore.
8233278	8233958	Universal joke.
8235599	8237261	But then I'd just blend into the crowd.
8239682	8240623	Oh, I didn't think of that.
8240663	8241023	You would.
8241064	8241904	You'd totally bend into the crowd.
8241924	8242625	You know what I almost said?
8242705	8243646	I almost said ninja.
8244066	8250090	Because if you've ever gone to realultimatepower.net, don't you know that the mortal enemy of all ninjas are pirates?
8251211	8252933	An L-shaped Tetris block.
8253513	8254634	That would be awesome.
8254974	8255875	That would be so rad.
8257432	8258353	Alright, here we go.
8259794	8261956	One more, or no, I'm sorry, we have three more questions, actually.
8261976	8262797	We're making a long one tonight.
8263137	8264318	Alright, because we haven't done it in a while.
8264558	8265359	Alright, question number three.
8266120	8277269	When Rob came home from work and saw Loki's main cabinet, the first thing he thought to himself was, gee, now that this thing is in my house, I can play nothing but blank all day long.
8279731	8281313	It may not be the obvious choice.
8281413	8283675	Alright, I can play nothing but blank all day long.
8283695	8283795	Music.
8283815	8284015	Music.
8289313	8291335	Dude, that heavy breathing is so turning me on.
8291355	8291555	Alright.
8291695	8292416	I'm teasing you, Richie.
8292436	8292496	No.
8319276	8319676	All right.
8321077	8321477	Richie.
8321777	8322077	Dang.
8322718	8322958	All right.
8323018	8324218	Richie's first this time, right?
8324758	8325799	Richie, you're giving me a boner.
8325839	8326179	Stop it.
8326259	8326519	All right.
8327940	8328540	Hey, Rob.
8328740	8329220	Yeah?
8329560	8329780	No.
8330701	8331241	All right.
8331261	8332862	What if Rob dressed up as a maid for you?
8335043	8335643	I don't know.
8337324	8339044	Wouldn't you even get like a little bit of a boner?
8339124	8339885	Like a half boner?
8340045	8340485	Like a bone?
8341676	8342177	Um, no.
8342337	8344058	Alright, alright.
8344078	8344959	Not later, okay?
8345359	8346940	Alright, you're dropping out there, buddy.
8346960	8347240	Careful.
8347260	8348782	We gotta hear you for this answer, though, alright?
8349442	8349942	Uh, here we go.
8350343	8354566	G, now that this thing is in my house, I can play nothing but blank all day long.
8354626	8354846	What?
8355507	8362552	Okay, I was really gonna say, do you like horny bunnies, but then, I'm going to go with the chat room and say, um, let's see, girls panic.
8363233	8364013	Gals panic.
8364554	8365494	Gals panic.
8366115	8370118	Alright, gals panic is what, um, what he said, Richie.
8370538	8370879	Andrew?
8371599	8372180	What do you think?
8372640	8374522	He's going to stay home and play blank all day long.
8374602	8386392	I think he's going to stay home and play with himself, because that way Loki will be over here playing that, and that way he doesn't feel awkward when he's doing it, and Loki comes in and watches him like normal, so I think it'll be a lot more comfortable for Ron.
8386412	8389114	Alright, so Andrew says he's just going to play with himself.
8389354	8390615	Screw the machine, I'm going to play with myself.
8390655	8392757	Alright, that's a very good answer, actually.
8393117	8395800	Alright, Jamie, I'm going to stay home and play...
8396320	8397040	BurgerTime.
8397060	8397980	BurgerTime!
8398020	8399981	The chat room was trying to get you guys to say it.
8400001	8400841	BurgerTime.
8400961	8401661	All right, let's see.
8403262	8403922	DDRholic.
8404822	8406002	Okay.
8406262	8412004	And by the way, for those of you who don't know, it's DDRcoholic, but I let Rob call me holic.
8412024	8412404	Sorry, sorry.
8412524	8413884	DDRcoholic.
8414004	8415405	No, that's your name for me.
8415765	8416525	That's your name for me.
8416585	8417025	Okay.
8417605	8418385	I just like holic.
8420246	8423586	Okay, I thought that Loki would love... Hold on, Richie.
8423786	8424727	Enough with the heavy breathing.
8424747	8425667	You're turning me on over here.
8426767	8428068	I know I'm getting like all wet and stuff.
8428108	8428488	I know.
8429528	8430108	Wait, wait.
8430848	8431909	Wait, you are over 18, right?
8432629	8434589	Yes, I am turning 21 this year.
8434729	8435630	Oh, boy, that's hot.
8435710	8435990	All right.
8436610	8436870	Okay.
8437050	8437410	All right.
8437810	8438130	All right.
8438210	8438570	I'm sorry.
8438950	8439951	Decided to stay home and play?
8440191	8441311	And play Q-Bert.
8441631	8442191	Q-Bert.
8442251	8442912	Good answer.
8442952	8444392	Q-Bert is a game I would play all day long.
8445852	8447113	DDR Angel, what would you say?
8447133	8447933	What were you going to call me?
8448733	8450154	I almost said DDR Alcoholic again.
8450634	8451394	DDR Angel.
8452430	8453250	Uh, Pole Position.
8453691	8454451	Pole Position!
8454891	8455812	All these are great answers.
8455852	8457012	I would play Pole Position all day long.
8457072	8457412	Sigurd.
8460313	8461734	It's only because I saw it today.
8461934	8462734	Gals Panic.
8463075	8464035	Gals Panic!
8464435	8465095	That's a match!
8465115	8465636	That's a match.
8465656	8467096	It's a match for Richie!
8467577	8468917	Alright, Richie gets a point.
8469737	8470058	Alright.
8470878	8471318	Loki.
8471698	8473259	He decided to stay home and play.
8474028	8476990	We wonder why we don't play this game all the time.
8478291	8486497	Anyways, the answer would be Miss Mr. NudeWorld96.
8487358	8491841	That's right, that's Miss World 96 with the boys in it instead of the girls.
8492762	8493242	Good answer.
8493602	8495424	My answer was, actually...
8496284	8499565	My answer was I would stay home and play Miss World 96 Nude, actually.
8499625	8500285	I also said that.
8500325	8503987	Except I didn't say the Mr. version because that version is broken and it keeps crashing.
8504067	8507028	So I just wanted to play the version that has the Move Your Body song.
8507568	8510069	If you've never played Miss World 96 Nude, go download it right now.
8510109	8510449	It rocks.
8510569	8510829	All right.
8511749	8513850	That has been what I've been playing all day, too, honestly.
8514270	8515290	I play that more than anything else.
8515991	8516331	All right.
8516891	8518311	Richie's up by one, but let's see.
8518351	8519312	Two more questions to go.
8519372	8519592	Ready?
8520332	8521672	Ooh, this is a question about Sigurd.
8522673	8522993	All right.
8525029	8529752	Sigurd can become very tired after having to be a Konami slave all day long.
8530893	8537497	Luckily, Konami takes care of its employees and keeps Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free blank.
8539378	8539658	Music.
8544537	8547278	Keep Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free playing.
8575723	8576666	Okay, I guess it's done.
8577428	8579694	Alright, let's see what everybody thought.
8580997	8582241	Starting off with our contestants.
8583507	8586510	Sigurd can become very tired after having to be a Konami slave all day long.
8586570	8590653	Luckily, Konami takes care of its employees and keeps Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free... Andrew?
8591073	8594376	I'm going to say something like caffeine or coffee or something like that.
8594436	8596898	Okay, free coffee, let's say.
8596958	8597539	Free coffee.
8598159	8598359	What?
8599480	8600481	Free stimulants.
8600781	8601542	Stimulants is good.
8601902	8602222	All right.
8603023	8604644	Richie, you there?
8604664	8605405	Yes, I am.
8605585	8609028	They're going to keep Sigurd a very happy boy with all of the free...
8609841	8610702	Blowjobs.
8610902	8612203	Blowjobs!
8612443	8614565	Alright, let's see if anybody gets a match.
8614726	8616847	Okay, I didn't know, ooh, maybe I should go work for Konami.
8617388	8617668	Alright.
8618629	8623534	Jamie, keeps him a happy boy with all of the free... Politary torture sessions.
8623694	8625355	Politary torture sessions.
8625375	8626476	That wouldn't make me happy!
8627477	8628518	That would make me sad.
8628538	8629219	Alright.
8630040	8630380	Alright.
8632506	8635967	Keep Seegert a very happy boy with all of the free... Did you get a hug?
8635987	8637127	How about Red Bull?
8637647	8638688	Red Bull!
8639708	8640768	That's a match!
8640868	8642189	I think it's a match with the stimulants.
8642289	8642809	Good job.
8643229	8644329	Alright, it's all tied up now.
8645129	8645529	Alright.
8647830	8648610	Let's see, Angel.
8649510	8650271	She's still writing.
8650311	8650511	Come on.
8650611	8651031	Shut up!
8652031	8653291	All of the free... Junk.
8654052	8654392	Junk!
8654672	8656272	Because I didn't know what to put.
8656992	8657833	I blame, I know.
8658153	8658793	Alright, alright.
8660487	8661588	That's alright, no worries.
8661988	8666010	Okay, Sigurd, they keep you happy with all of the free.
8666290	8673914	Okay, everybody would have thought I would say Akira Yamaoka anything, but no, I put Suikoden Yaoi fanfics.
8674394	8676496	Suikoden Yaoi fanfics!
8677216	8678156	That'd make me happy.
8679437	8681418	Loki, all of the free.
8682379	8686521	I said stimulants, and when I mean stimulants, I mean Akira Yamaoka porn.
8688661	8690783	All of the home videos you don't get to see.
8692865	8694927	Alright, I don't think that's a match though, sorry.
8694967	8695968	A different kind of stimulant.
8696088	8696388	Alright.
8697049	8703635	My answer was, keep Sigrid a very happy boy with all of the free grape-feeding men in togas.
8705477	8706578	That sounds pretty stimulating.
8706598	8709721	Don't they have that room at Konami with all the great feeding men in the togas?
8711523	8712584	They're still looking for hints.
8714574	8716155	Oh my god, Toga, that's the song.
8716335	8716675	Alright.
8718576	8719137	Let's see.
8719637	8720077	Moving on.
8720137	8720938	Last question, guys.
8721598	8722159	Last question, guys.
8722179	8722459	You ready?
8723099	8723980	Alright, let's go.
8724300	8726221	See, now this question isn't as funny anymore.
8726241	8730323	I was going to do it before the big premiere, but just imagine we haven't done Your Rain yet, okay?
8730343	8730664	Here it is.
8732585	8742931	When we told the listeners that it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play Your Rain tonight, the first thing the listeners did was blank the hosts.
8746088	8746409	Music.
8751253	8751954	Horn music.
8752094	8755337	I swear this song makes me think it should also be for a chicken commercial.
8782419	8783099	All right, here it is.
8783179	8783739	Tiebreaker.
8783819	8784460	Here's your chance.
8784840	8786060	I'm going to start with Richie this time.
8786100	8793284	Richie, when we told the listeners that it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play Your Rain tonight, the first thing the listeners did was blank the host.
8794574	8797195	was to have spicy hot orgasms with the host.
8797315	8799096	Spicy hot orgasms.
8799176	8799636	Interesting.
8799776	8800036	All right.
8800076	8800436	Let's see.
8801156	8803517	Andrew, first thing they were going to do was what to the host?
8803897	8810899	Well, tie them up and force them to listen to, like, Good Charlotte and Linkin Park, which is more punishing than anything I could think of.
8810919	8811300	Oh, yeah.
8811320	8812120	That's pretty bad.
8812160	8812460	All right.
8812660	8813200	Oh, wow.
8813240	8813480	Okay.
8813560	8814361	Let's see if we get a match.
8814961	8817462	Jamie, they decided to blank the host.
8817942	8818302	Mooned.
8819142	8819622	Mooned!
8820122	8821163	They made us look at their minds.
8821223	8821983	On their webcams.
8822003	8822883	On their webcams.
8823604	8824204	Good answer.
8824724	8825144	Not a match.
8825564	8826145	DDRholic.
8826865	8829986	This might be close to the steamy orgasms.
8830326	8830726	Queefed?
8832467	8833347	I don't think so.
8833427	8835448	I think that's a little bit different.
8835548	8836148	Are you sure?
8836168	8837929	I think it's a little different, honey.
8838489	8839149	A little different, honey.
8839730	8840050	Alright.
8840310	8841050	DDRangel.
8841090	8843651	They decided to... Flash 90 bits on a webcam.
8844022	8846283	Flash Naughty Bits on their webcam to the host.
8846383	8847243	Nope, doesn't work.
8847303	8847783	Sorry, bud.
8848423	8848943	Sigurd.
8850644	8851064	Richie.
8851724	8852044	Yes?
8852784	8853404	Stop.
8853424	8855205	You're making me... Later.
8856265	8856845	Later.
8858866	8861306	I was boring, and I just said murdered the host.
8861486	8863167	Murdered.
8863187	8863867	That was a good answer.
8864047	8864667	All right, Loki.
8865928	8867508	Ban from DDR Freak.
8869247	8870388	That would be awfully hard.
8870888	8873430	Considering one of our hosts is a moderator, that would be kind of hard.
8873970	8875491	Unless it was April Fool's time again.
8876572	8877812	That was a hilarious joke.
8877892	8878233	That was funny.
8878273	8878873	Did I ever tell you that?
8879293	8880694	All right.
8881414	8881775	Hey, Rob.
8881955	8882215	Yes.
8882335	8882595	What?
8882615	8882795	What?
8883055	8883376	What?
8883396	8883736	What?
8883756	8884616	What?
8885257	8885817	Bitch, what?
8887318	8888199	Fine, I won't tell you.
8888319	8888679	All right.
8890520	8891040	Is it a hint?
8891921	8892401	Is it a hint?
8893021	8894562	The hint is the new ferret mix.
8894662	8894963	All right.
8897279	8898099	All right, here it is.
8898440	8898980	My answer.
8899320	8907264	When we told the listeners it was all a big joke and we weren't actually going to play your reign tonight, the first thing the listeners did was give money to the hosts because that's what I need them to do.
8907304	8907644	Oh, bribe us.
8907664	8908264	Give us money.
8909865	8910765	All right.
8910945	8912406	Webcam, yo, webcam.
8915087	8915587	All right.
8916027	8917368	That's going to do it for tonight's match game.
8917388	8918549	The final score, guys.
8919129	8920449	Andrew, one point.
8920490	8920910	Good job.
8921310	8924351	Richie, one point, which means they tied.
8924831	8925692	And you know what that means?
8926602	8927303	You both lose!
8927363	8928344	You both lose!
8928724	8929445	Good job!
8930666	8934930	And now that you've lost the match game, how do you feel?
8935191	8935911	What are you going to do now?
8936993	8939595	I think I'm going to go back into the bathroom for another ten minutes.
8940736	8941597	Alright, sounds good.
8941757	8942418	You do that.
8942438	8943039	Remember to flush.
8944300	8944720	Alright.
8946322	8946682	Alright.
8947163	8949025	Richie, thanks for playing, but you lose.
8950967	8951987	Any last words you want to say?
8953569	8957071	Amy, when I come on that show, I am going to stomp those bears down my pants.
8957612	8958032	That is all.
8958432	8959193	Bye, thank you.
8960854	8961174	Alright.
8962816	8963656	Okay, we've got it.
8963796	8967219	We have not even talked about Bomani news yet, and we've still got the FUs of the week to do.
8967339	8971482	So, Loki, Loki's going to cast, what, yes, Secret Dude.
8971542	8977466	Just for the listeners that aren't in the chat room, there sounds like there will be hints coming next week, for real.
8978047	8978627	Real ones.
8978787	8979388	Yeah, real ones.
8979809	8989668	So, be on the lookout Alright, sounds good Let's get to some of our other Bomani news Loki's going to kind of run down what's been going on here
8990427	8995911	Yeah, since we kind of bypassed that whole section of the show, because that's not important, no one really cares.
8996451	9001695	Well, first off, 2DX Red, or 2DX11, was testing now in Japan.
9002475	9006238	Of course, we have the first, you know, song list that's out over there.
9006959	9008400	There's some really cool stuff.
9008520	9013963	We've got a brand new DJ setup track, Spiritual Galaxy, a brand new 8th
9015595	9024498	8PLUS, which is Gigadelic, and then there's also a bunch of other tracks that are on there.
9024958	9026939	New Walls track, which is pretty sweet.
9027839	9036062	Just a lot of cool stuff, check it out on Bomani Style, or Air Japan, or any other site that carries Bomani news, because you've got tons of info on it.
9037876	9038977	New stuff that's going to be in there.
9039017	9046543	They have a new ranking thing that's on the side of the screen as you're playing the game, which shows your combo versus the max combo on the machine, which I thought was pretty neat.
9046743	9050526	And it's very red, hence the name 2DX Red.
9050946	9057972	Of course, there'll be more songs coming out as time goes on right now, because with each test, of course, they add more songs to it and stuff.
9058272	9062796	Supposedly, there's going to be a lot more new songs coming, and it just looks pretty sweet.
9065278	9072503	Also, a Eurotrans-style version of Platonic X, which makes me sad.
9073163	9078707	But yeah, and Secret of Love, new DJ Swan track, also did Gentle Stress, so that'd be pretty cool.
9079708	9086253	Aside from that kind of stuff, well, I know there's a lot of Sim stuff...
9088227	9089868	There was big sim news this week.
9091049	9099075	If you've just been spending your time on the internet doing nothing but waiting for Extreme and Ultramix 2 hints, you're missing some of the stuff that's going on in the sim scene.
9099095	9102517	And while that might be questionable or whatever, there is some good stuff going on.
9102798	9103638	What is going on right now?
9103658	9104379	There is some big stuff.
9104479	9106860	My god, there is a bunch of big stuff going on.
9106920	9110383	First off, the best sim filmmakers on the face of the fucking earth.
9111276	9114377	The FoonMix team, they released FoonMix Plus, which is awesome.
9114417	9115437	You need to go check it out.
9115997	9117197	It's 15 brand new songs.
9117277	9121058	Most of the songs are from Diverse7, which is also out right now.
9122339	9129660	Diverse7 is actually going to be featuring three different CDs with actual key sound files for BMS players.
9129700	9131901	Basically, it's the Beatmania 2DX Sims.
9132841	9135361	And I gotta say, these artists are fucking awesome.
9135381	9137862	They do really kick-ass Bomani remixes.
9138442	9139603	and you need to go check them out.
9139683	9143025	If you haven't heard of Diverse Systems before, you can definitely check them out.
9143166	9147469	It's at www.diverse.jp and go check it out.
9147489	9148389	They have an English page.
9148429	9151171	You can order the CDs and they're really kick-ass.
9151251	9154734	And they were actually the ones that were distributing Bounce Connected for a while there, so...
9155294	9156175	Definitely check it out.
9156515	9163258	But some of the cool stuff that's on there, you've got a few remixes I'd like to kind of just tease a little bit.
9163278	9164859	Maybe we can play these in a break or something.
9165259	9166520	There was some new ones.
9166620	9171042	There was a new track by Offbeat, which did some really kick-ass stuff.
9171983	9175085	This would be the Holic remix called Holics.
9176145	9179307	And it was pretty sweet, so let me just play a little bit in the middle here.
9184215	9185276	I mean, that was pretty sweet.
9185496	9197108	And then, um, we've also got, there's a brand new, um, what was it, Innocent Walls remix, which, oh my god, it's fucking awesome.
9197949	9199670	Um, let's see here.
9199690	9207358	Uh, let's see, ch-ch-ch.
9218345	9222507	Just some really kick-ass stuff, and of course, they make awesome videos that go with everything.
9222867	9224007	Steps are really good.
9224687	9225888	Definitely go check it out.
9226048	9231190	There's remixes of G2, Max 300, of course, but, you know, it's really awesome.
9231890	9240753	There's remixes of 20 November, Brilliant to You, Holic, as I mentioned before, The Safari, just a bunch of really cool stuff.
9241494	9242414	Go check it out, and
9243149	9251655	Since it is all in one pack, you do get the original Foon Mix as well, which there's tons of songs in that, all the same quality, just excellent.
9251675	9252596	Go check that out.
9254558	9260082	Aside from that, there's been more work being done on the front of starting to rip stuff from games.
9260442	9272471	Actually, there's a guy working on ripping all the characters, the 3D characters from the PlayStation versions, and all the background graphics and stuff, and the progress so far has been really cool, and you can check that on DDR Maniacs.
9273547	9274248	Step Mania Forums
9303564	9305465	But that's pretty much what's going on right now.
9305665	9313968	I've heard that there was going to be an Alpha 22 for Stepmania 3.9, but apparently not yet.
9314188	9316489	But it's coming soon.
9317930	9318230	Alright.
9318910	9320391	Thanks for catching up on the news.
9320431	9325393	I know we kind of got pushed aside because of all the other crap we got going on tonight, but there is other news going on out there.
9326133	9327133	So thanks for bringing it up.
9327173	9328634	Anybody want to comment on any of the news?
9330629	9331989	Well, you guys are easy to please.
9332009	9332670	Talkative bunch.
9332990	9333710	Talkative bunch, aren't you?
9334010	9334290	All right.
9334910	9338291	I think what we're going to do now, actually, we'll take a quick break and we're going to play some songs.
9338431	9340632	Oh, actually, I have to announce tonight's winner of the cage match.
9340812	9341212	My bad.
9342013	9343293	Tonight's winner of the cage match.
9344653	9349075	I was actually kind of surprised by this, but Loki's remix has been dethroned and we have a new winner.
9352512	9353213	ASTRO SEXY
9369395	9376278	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9396960	9397621	Good stuff.
9397802	9399886	Alright, so Mflow one tonight.
9400427	9401048	I think we're going to do it.
9401068	9401549	We're going to take a...
9402833	9405515	We're going to take a break, and we're actually going to play two tracks from FoonMix.
9405535	9409177	I want to play the Max remix, because I think it's really good, and we're going to play the Safari, because I like that one.
9409537	9411298	So I thought we'd play those for the guys.
9411698	9413379	Those are pretty cool, yeah.
9413399	9414039	They're all good.
9414199	9414940	They're all good, really.
9415340	9418642	Really, my favorites of the new one have to be the Innocent Walls one.
9418722	9421143	Okay, I'll take out... I'll put in Innocent Walls, too.
9421323	9423685	The Innocent Walls one is fucking awesome.
9423825	9431549	I mean, the guys from FoonMix did enter TourneyMix 5, but the entry that they picked was one of the worst ones that they did.
9432168	9434751	But if they picked one of these, oh my god, it would have owned everybody.
9434811	9441198	But whatever, you know, I'm sure they're not out to brag because they know they're kick-ass and they don't really need to prove it.
9441298	9444902	So, yeah, rock.
9445083	9447045	Alright, so we'll get that in there too then.
9447065	9449748	I just got to remember, is that it?
9451089	9451570	Oh, sure is.
9451991	9454193	All right, then we'll do this song first, why don't we?
9455113	9456935	We're going to do that Innocent Walls remix.
9456955	9458896	And then when we come back, we are going to do the FUs of the week.
9458936	9460617	However, we have to keep it fast tonight.
9460938	9462499	So we're going to run through everybody in the room.
9462639	9467142	And unfortunately tonight, only selected chatroom FUs will be read.
9467182	9469544	So if you send me a long one, not going to get read.
9469864	9475227	So think of something really good if you have a good story, and I apologize in advance, but we are running on a limited schedule tonight, so keep them short.
9476288	9480190	FUs from chatroom will be limited, but send those to Sky over private message.
9480210	9480750	So here it is.
9481090	9481611	Check it out.
9481651	9486213	Some remix songs from the latest Foon Mix, starting off with an Innocent Walls vocal mix.
9486533	9488314	Max remix, and then a guitar remix.
9488354	9489595	Let me get the actual title.
9489655	9491756	Hold on, because I want to be correct on this.
9492977	9497720	This title of this remix here is called Made in Innocent.
9498422	9500023	It's a short version by Onokin.
9500263	9502904	Onokin, which fucking rocks, did P8107.
9503545	9508227	Rumored to have a song in 2DX Red, but I think that's pretty much a rumor.
9508247	9511149	It'd be awesome if he did, but just a rumor for now.
9512430	9513730	So yeah, check it out.
9514031	9515311	Awesome work.
9515651	9517452	And don't forget, Your Rain will be back again at 9.40.
9517492	9518453	We're going to play that again.
9518513	9519473	Okay, anyway, here we go.
9520514	9521234	Some stuff from Foomix.
9521254	9522195	We'll be back with the FUs of the Week.

9616292	9617292	DarkSakura.com
9649778	9650164	Thank you.
9746933	9747906	Thanks for watching!
9802489	9804011	What should I do with my cuteness?
9804031	9804572	What should I do?
9868907	9881672	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
9895003	9898005	Yes, we are a little bit random here on Orange Lawns Radio, if you haven't guessed.
9898105	9898525	A little.
9898905	9899426	But you know what?
9899446	9901367	A lot of guys stuck around after the Eurage thing.
9901387	9901707	You like us.
9901727	9902307	We appreciate you.
9902327	9903148	You really like us.
9903188	9904069	No, we do appreciate it.
9904129	9908191	We like our listeners to stick with us because then we feel good about ourselves.
9908231	9909292	We've been trying here, you guys.
9909312	9910552	It validates us for the week.
9910692	9912474	We think it's a fun thing to do on a Sunday night.
9912534	9915535	I mean, you know, it's not like I'm going to church or anything.
9915555	9916796	It's not like we're getting paid for this.
9916816	9918037	Yeah, we don't get paid for this either.
9918077	9918917	We pay for this.
9919178	9919458	We do.
9920472	9920812	With our souls!
9920832	9923795	We have this whole buildup of angst and we need to have a big bad release of it or else we like explode.
9947782	9949807	Alright, here we go then.
9950067	9952072	Jamie, it's time to do the FUs of the week.
9952092	9952473	You ready?
9953054	9953716	I'm ready, Rob.
9968968	9974350	I would like to give a big F you to the three root beers that I've had that facilitated that loud belch.
9974810	9976410	I'm normally not as unladylike.
9976650	9978211	I usually am a lot more unladylike.
9978811	9980131	Nah, really.
9981212	9986113	A big F you to impatience, especially for people who drive.
9986853	9994415	And another F you goes to ARC for not posting my financial aid stuff and certifying my loans so I can get my fucking money.
9995536	9995896	That's it.
9997217	9997899	I'm being nice.
9998961	10000305	F you to the freaking running out of time.
10000645	10001507	Alright, moving on.
10002109	10002971	Loki, your turn.
10007104	10011948	I fucking hate stupid skanky drivers who can't fucking drive.
10012549	10015912	I had this stupid bitch last weekend still pissing me off.
10015992	10022737	Fucking cut me off when I'm driving just to get behind a slow person that was in front of me.
10023138	10023958	Oh wow, guess what?
10023998	10026640	You got to the intersection a whole half a second faster than I did.
10027721	10030523	Good, now you can go fuck another sheep and have your next child.
10031184	10031584	Okay.
10032745	10042451	And then finally, because I'm going to keep this short, um, fuck you to sluts at my work who get higher up in the company about fucking your box.
10043372	10045733	And openly admitting it and bragging about it.
10046554	10049155	I fucking hate you and I will take you down.
10049456	10051317	And I'm not talking about it in a good way.
10053238	10053618	I'm done.
10055379	10055760	My turn.
10061880	10080017	And a few to myself for the fact that I'm paying about $13.95 a month to play Final Fantasy XI And I have touched it a whopping one time this whole week Because I found better things to do for once in my life For once in my life, no, because I found something even better than Ragnarok I went out and I went on a date this week, so that was something better to do, so...
10080938	10081919	Yeah, that's finally.
10083921	10084821	But that's all I'm going to say.
10085001	10088584	I don't want to talk too much because I might dig myself a hole.
10088604	10090406	But anyway, I'm just glad I got out of the house.
10090426	10092167	You know what I mean?
10094849	10095369	Is that a hint?
10095489	10096310	No.
10097891	10101574	My other FU goes to that burning smell in my car.
10101714	10103856	I thought I cracked my radiator or something.
10104276	10108980	But actually, I just ran over a plastic bag and it wrapped itself around my pipe and caught itself on fire.
10109485	10112027	So F you to people that leave plastic bags in the road.
10112287	10113628	What the hell you do that for?
10114528	10117430	Stupid.
10118511	10118831	All right.
10120072	10120572	Moving on.
10120612	10123014	Let's go to our other studio guests.
10125276	10127898	Starting off with, who's got a microphone over there?
10128158	10131240	Oh, Mr. Andrew, what do you have to say?
10131380	10131900	F you to what?
10132180	10136363	Alright, well I'd like to give a big fuck you to all the bar and speed mod haters out there.
10136383	10139245	I'd just like to piss you guys off right now before I get started.
10139745	10143787	I wanted to talk to you more about the bar raping thing tonight, but we just ran out of time.
10143807	10144228	I'll come back.
10144248	10145308	You gotta come back, alright.
10145328	10145909	We ain't got time.
10146209	10149791	I'd also like to give a big F you to everybody that lives in Glen Rose, Texas.
10150352	10154314	I don't care if I know you or not, but just that whole town needs to just be wiped off the map.
10154875	10160217	And last but not least, if you're a friend that I told to listen tonight and you're not listening, fuck you guys.
10160397	10161597	Don't ever talk to me again.
10161617	10163258	If you are listening, I love you.
10164218	10165578	In a platonic kind of way.
10165838	10166639	Okay, that's all I got.
10167139	10168519	Alright, very nice.
10168599	10168839	Angel.
10168899	10171400	Alright, I'm going to go through this real quick because I got one from Agus as well.
10171820	10181763	He says, F you to sitting on my ass on a perfectly good Sunday doing nothing except for answering people's phone calls and they happen to be going to the wrong department.
10182244	10183204	And he's the only one there.
10184408	10198491	Also, I'd like to say a quick F you to the stoplight on Arden and Del Paso because it is the longest piece of crap I've ever waited on and it happened to be while I was trying to get over here.
10199091	10202212	So I'm going, okay, I can go now, really, I really want to get here.
10202232	10206413	Yeah, because I'm like, you know, an Orange Lounge freak like that.
10206633	10209313	Anyway, next person.
10209413	10210293	Oh, one more F you.
10210553	10212934	Fuck you to Burger King for making me shit like crazy.
10214724	10215124	Wow.
10215624	10216024	TMI.
10216164	10216504	All right.
10216985	10217765	DDR Coholic.
10218505	10219605	Oh, hey.
10220645	10221165	What's up?
10221486	10221726	Okay.
10222546	10228287	I was going to originally start off by saying fuck you to not having any fuck you because I... I said fuck you.
10228667	10230848	Yes, because I could never participate.
10231108	10232348	I would have to pass the microphones.
10232368	10233648	I don't have any fuck yous.
10233948	10235169	I don't know what to say.
10235489	10237049	But now I have a little something.
10237069	10240570	I can say like, okay, fuck you to not having any good arcades anymore around town.
10240930	10241430	Where are they?
10242424	10242924	Where are they?
10244344	10247465	We should still build one, yeah.
10247625	10251626	And then, fuck you to the post office thing that's at our apartment complex.
10251686	10254146	It's like a mile away from my apartment.
10254166	10255886	I have to actually drive to get there.
10255966	10257107	It's a pain in the butt.
10257947	10259507	And it's unbelievable.
10259547	10260907	Our apartment complex is huge.
10261487	10263688	And we're on the other side of the post office.
10263708	10265148	It's all the way on one end of the complex.
10265168	10266008	You could put it in the middle.
10266248	10267388	No, they don't do that.
10267448	10268789	They put it on one end.
10269249	10270169	So anyway, fuck you to that.
10270569	10270969	That's it.
10272350	10274131	Alright, moving on.
10274251	10274692	Sigurd!
10275832	10281576	F you to relatives that start charging you rent after living there a month and you have to sleep in the kitchen.
10283037	10284158	You're sleeping in the kitchen?
10284178	10285099	Yeah, I'm sleeping in the kitchen.
10285119	10285979	You are so Cinderella.
10286239	10286680	It's horrible.
10286720	10287800	I made that comparison the other night.
10288041	10291083	Yeah, I didn't like it because that would mean I'd have to wear a dress or something.
10293044	10295205	F you to the chatroom because it's funny.
10297266	10307491	F you to people who read into what we say far too much and F you to your guys' crazy photoshop skills because
10308066	10310047	It's really creepy, but funny, so keep it up.
10310487	10313489	See, Konami employees are real people too, you guys.
10314590	10317151	Alright, let's go to the chatroom FU, shall we?
10317211	10318272	Oh, I forgot another big one.
10318372	10318912	I'm very sorry.
10319933	10324356	And FU to not having time or money to go where I want to go and see who I want to see.
10326257	10326997	One really quick one.
10327718	10333321	FU to the post office for holding all of our mail because we're still trying to get forwards and stuff.
10333641	10335082	That really sucks for three weeks now.
10336044	10342957	Yeah, you know, Miklatov or whatever the hell you go by now, don't stress out, just mellow out, be gentle.
10344139	10345242	Have some gentle stress.
10346043	10346404	Nice.
10348283	10349524	Oh, was that a hint?
10349604	10350184	Was that a hint?
10351145	10351445	Alright.
10351805	10354167	Oh my god, Gentle Stress is in a version of DDR.
10354627	10355408	Okay, here we go.
10355848	10356849	Oh, this is going to be good.
10358050	10359270	I'm loving this first one already.
10359431	10361252	Let's go into the chatroom FUs.
10362272	10363653	We're going to start a fight here tonight.
10364394	10367956	Tora would like to give an FU to Jamie, also known as DarkSakura.
10368256	10368557	Why?
10369057	10371639	Because she gave me warning points for no reason way back when.
10373217	10375778	Okay, if I warn you, it's for a fucking reason.
10375818	10376799	You did something wrong.
10376939	10379841	Also, keep in mind, you lose a freaking point a month.
10381201	10382162	It's probably gone.
10383683	10385423	How could you possibly piss off DarkSakura?
10385443	10387244	I could never imagine how you would make her mad.
10387444	10389245	Look, you break the rules I warn your ass.
10389325	10390046	It's that easy.
10390646	10394788	Panda says, F you to my HDD with all my stuff for crashing on me when I needed it.
10394908	10400051	John Field says, F you to PSO, Blue Burst, Hacker, Broom.
10400431	10401632	Stop hacking this thing.
10404531	10405492	Fancy Star Online.
10405552	10406853	I haven't followed that game in years.
10406873	10410856	Blue Burst is the one for PC.
10410996	10415459	Unknown Gamer says, I want to say a big old F you to making me wait two hours to listen to your rain.
10415499	10417400	Hey, F you, buddy.
10417720	10418761	It was going to be three.
10418941	10421023	We were going to play it like the very last thing.
10421423	10422464	We were being nice.
10423344	10427849	Not my fault, you guys thought, because this show is from 6.30, 9.30, you'll be right at 6.30.
10428090	10429731	Then what would we do with the rest of the show?
10429992	10431233	What would we do with ourselves?
10431393	10433375	It'd be the Listen to Rob Play With Himself show.
10433395	10433896	Exactly.
10435598	10437280	At least we're better than G4.
10437840	10438961	We are much better than G4.
10438981	10439662	Absolutely right.
10439983	10441805	At least the premiere wasn't on G4.
10441865	10442826	Thank your lucky stars.
10443519	10444679	We got it first.
10444920	10447120	El Mullet says F you to Pants.
10447681	10449521	Damn Pants, the bane of all evil.
10450042	10451482	Yeah, fuck Pants.
10451622	10453323	Yeah, remember Pants was Rage?
10454123	10455404	Ooh, Pants was Rage.
10455444	10462066	Wizkid would like to say F you to old ladies who call the tech support line and yell at me because they're too dumb to understand what reboot means.
10463567	10464727	How about boot to the ass?
10467709	10468469	How do I reboot?
10468940	10469260	All right.
10470801	10477305	MJB would like to say, my FU of the week goes to my shitty internet for disconnecting me from Orange Lounge Radio, almost causing me to miss my FUs of the week.
10478265	10479766	Well, we can't have that, can we?
10480106	10482427	Any other week, you would have been okay with the cap thing, I swear.
10482487	10483348	Tonight's just crazy.
10484088	10487810	EvilMalke2DX says, FU to Aqua Teen Hunger Force ending next Sunday.
10489071	10490332	Yay!
10490692	10494694	Jazz says, FU to me for leaving my cell phone on silent.
10495074	10498056	I just found missed calls from two of my bestest friends.
10499003	10501224	Rob, do you have brain cancer because you hiccup?
10520612	10525653	Vandalus says, My FU is for the Sacramento Kings and their recent drama.
10525733	10528614	It's like a friggin' soap opera full of spoiled millionaires.
10530315	10531075	Yeah, amen.
10531095	10532015	Thank God they're leaving.
10532835	10533375	Now, now.
10534016	10534576	Play nice.
10535756	10537116	Yeah, you're going to start another fight here.
10537497	10538037	You know what?
10538477	10542878	I think the people who get bent out of shape over sports rivalries really need to get a life.
10543217	10544158	One more last minute one here.
10544258	10547039	Arkara says, F you to Andrew for not giving me my sexiness.
10548040	10549080	I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
10549120	10549881	Is that a hidden message?
10550641	10551602	Wait about two weeks.
10551622	10552782	Do you need to take this offline?
10553162	10554703	No, I think we're all good.
10555504	10556844	Just give me two weeks or something.
10556904	10557305	It's on.
10557525	10557925	It's on.
10558645	10558885	Alright.
10561507	10562267	I haven't decided yet.
10562307	10563428	Is somebody going to get served?
10563948	10566569	I think Sucker's going to get chronicled.
10566609	10567310	That's what's up.
10567590	10567950	Alright.
10568711	10569111	Guys...
10570106	10570946	It's the end of the show.
10571006	10571686	We're already here.
10571706	10571766	Cry.
10572407	10573127	I know, cry.
10573527	10576468	Well, thank you guys for listening and making it a great show tonight.
10577168	10580089	I hope we don't need exclusives to make you guys keep listening to us.
10580969	10582229	We are exclusive.
10582269	10586410	Hopefully you liked it and you'll come back, but if not, hey, thanks for wasting three hours with us tonight.
10586430	10587230	I hope you liked the song.
10588451	10591332	But we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10591392	10592252	Let's start off with D.D.
10592372	10592872	Archaholic.
10593510	10595090	DD Alcoholic, your final thought.
10595170	10596571	It's like Jerry Springer's final thought.
10596651	10597671	It's your final thought.
10597991	10602192	Um, well, quick shout out to my boyfriend, Jason, DarkChild999.
10602272	10603892	I don't know if he's listening or not.
10604032	10604433	He might be.
10605213	10611214	Uh, and final thought, uh, chewing gum that tastes like grape is really good.
10613795	10614095	Alright.
10614815	10616836	Um, Angel, your final thought.
10617876	10620876	Um, I carry a mocha because I can.
10621937	10622257	Okay.
10622917	10622977	Uh,
10624096	10625556	Hey, Akira is a good thing.
10626036	10626257	Andrew.
10626877	10628657	I just want to say thanks for having me on the show.
10628757	10631558	I hope to be back in the future and this place kicks ass.
10631658	10634338	But there's way too much fucking Pokemon in here, man.
10635059	10635719	You're welcome.
10635859	10637759	It's creeping me the hell out.
10638139	10638459	Wait a minute.
10638479	10639000	Hold on.
10639020	10639460	Hold that thought.
10639500	10640320	Hold that thought.
10640920	10641200	Hold on.
10641280	10641740	Just one minute.
10645621	10648242	And this is the time when we fill air while Rob goes away.
10648262	10650022	Better than filling air for three hours while...
10654622	10655983	I'm gonna put that on the cam, you guys.
10676571	10678272	There's those moments that are really cool.
10678372	10680032	It's kind of like watching bad movies.
10680393	10683794	You know, eventually you'll get to a moment that's really funny and stuff.
10683974	10685074	It's like watching Xanadu.
10685314	10685995	Exactly.
10686875	10689176	No, I've never seen that, so that doesn't make any sense to me.
10689536	10690577	It's like watching Battle Royale 2.
10691617	10692677	God, that movie sucked.
10692957	10694838	Don't see Battle Royale 2.
10695378	10700560	Instead, download the camera rip of Kashan, because that fucking rocks.
10701741	10701901	Okay.
10704506	10711358	and my final thought is please come back and listen to us again even though we're not going to have any more premieres.
10711618	10713040	Please come back and listen.
10714082	10717027	I know, I didn't say, do I always have to go last?
10717087	10717368	Yes.
10719127	10720128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10741520	10743481	No, if it's a low-carb cookie.
10743701	10744101	A low-carb cookie.
10744121	10744281	Okay.
10745021	10745641	All right.
10745921	10751222	I was such a disbeliever for this stupid Atkins diet because, you know, it's sort of what your body does before it dies.
10752163	10752623	But it works.
10753263	10754223	So maybe I'm going to die.
10754843	10755003	Maybe.
10755023	10755864	Then I'll lose a lot of weight.
10757864	10762025	My final thought is that Diet Hansen's root beer is the best thing in the world.
10763428	10763668	All right.
10764329	10764649	I agree.
10765309	10766090	Second best thing in the world.
10766110	10766450	It's lovely.
10766470	10767191	Next to orgasms.
10767891	10768151	All right.
10768171	10771774	You know, I do have to say that orgasms are very nice.
10772134	10772434	They are.
10772474	10774876	They should just sell canned orgasms.
10775156	10775636	They should.
10776257	10777037	For all those people who do.
10777057	10777718	Orgasm array.
10778866	10779346	That's cool.
10781688	10782028	All right.
10783368	10784469	Sigurd, your final thought.
10784949	10788911	My final thought is I hope everybody liked the remix of Your Rain.
10788951	10792473	It's really fun in DDR, so look forward to that.
10792793	10796955	Also look forward to this week when it sounds like we might really be giving clues out.
10798216	10803899	So that's going to be cool, and thanks for listening to me whore myself out over the radio.
10805552	10809454	Alright, and final word of the show.
10810574	10811495	Are we going to give it to Andrew?
10811935	10812715	Alright, let's give it to Andrew.
10813756	10817637	Just one word that sums up the entire show, but it can only be one word that sums everything up.
10818458	10819158	Suckers.

11097418	11114471	We haven't even really talked about this in the room, but there's one other little thing we want to play for you guys This is why it pays to listen Yes it does, and it's not DDR, it's not a DDR thing, but Secret wanted to share it with you guys anyway It is something that hasn't been heard by a lot of people yet The Silent Hill thing
11116269	11117130	Oh, we're going to actually do that?
11117150	11119611	Yeah, we're going to do that.
11119972	11123534	Okay, I'm a DDR fan and all, but I'm more a Silent Hill fan.
11123835	11128998	We are going to play you a track from the US OST.
11129058	11134202	It's one of the 13 special exclusive songs to the American OST.
11134883	11136924	It's Waverer, Slide Mix.
11137705	11138745	Alright, so this is sweet.
11138905	11142148	It's a brand new US song, hasn't been heard yet, but we're going to play it for you guys.
11142168	11143609	It's Waverer, and it's a Kiriyamaoka.
11144421	11147566	See you again, that's why it pays to stay tuned to the end of the show.

11153415	11155157	Whoops, sorry, technical difficulties, my bad.
11155938	11157140	Let's try that again.
11157400	11157681	Here we go.

11281598	11282662	Thanks for watching!
11343274	11344135	All right, that was pretty cool.
11344215	11346136	It was from the Silent Hill U.S.
11346176	11346436	soundtrack.
11346456	11347136	I kind of like that.
11347196	11350819	That was kind of... That's like your favorite one, Sigur?
11351179	11353941	That is totally my favorite Akira Yamaoka song.
11354321	11364567	The original version of that is kind of boring, but that one with the crazy singing, I was listening to it on BARD at night, going home from work, and I was seriously freaking out.
11364647	11365568	It was the best.
11367071	11368532	It sounds kind of porno, in a way.
11368552	11369613	It does sound kind of porno.
11369713	11370034	Alright.
11370995	11371695	Just porno.
11371715	11372316	I like it.

11436872	11457680	I'm waiting for a gentle rain, a gentle rain, a gentle you On the sidewalk of the city, on the streets just a whisper Busy people going nowhere, see me smoking the rain No compassion, nothing matters, my resistance is way

11483906	11486468	Alright, anything else you guys want to say?
11486588	11489170	We kind of had all that take up our afterbirth.
11489230	11490791	I'm going home.
11491392	11496916	Yeah, you know what, I've got to drive Secret back to the bay, so I think I've got to keep this kind of short, because it's a long drive home, but that's alright.
11498297	11498697	I don't mind.
11498717	11499978	And you've got a way home too, right Angel?
11501159	11501640	Alright, good.
11502140	11502840	Cool, everything's set.
11503001	11503441	Yes, Angel.
11504673	11505874	Someone call me at kthx, bye.
11506995	11507956	Because nobody ever calls me.
11509377	11510378	I can call you names.
11510698	11511459	I can call you names.
11511479	11512699	On the phone!
11513040	11516222	Do you want me to call you on the phone and call you names?
11516723	11521627	Did you want to just give out your phone number over the air so that random strangers will call you?
11522387	11524069	For a good time, call 555.
11524109	11524389	Alright.
11528396	11529337	Yeah, Sigurd, what's up?
11529897	11531858	Okay, you guys have been patient.
11531898	11533559	The chat room has been grilling.
11534219	11540743	I know, they're like rabid DDR Freak fans, or Orange Lounge fans, or fan fans.
11540783	11543304	Hopefully both after tonight's show, that's the goal.
11543684	11548447	But you guys were really patient, so I figured I'd give you one hint, because I'm nice.
11548587	11550208	No way, you're actually able to give a hint?
11550268	11551188	Totally giving one hint.
11551689	11552449	Oh, wow.
11552809	11553550	Okay, very sexy.
11553590	11554090	Alright, what is it?
11554330	11556211	Okay, now you guys might have to read into this a little bit.
11556251	11557752	I know you're good at it, so it's okay.
11559048	11562490	One new song in Xtreme has steps.
11565852	11567053	With up arrows.
11569014	11570035	Wow.
11571455	11572076	Up arrows.
11572396	11573457	We don't see enough of them.
11574017	11574817	No, no, no.
11575338	11579620	Do not underestimate the power of that hint.
11580501	11584123	I mean, it might sound like there's going to be a song with music in it.
11584203	11585904	No, this isn't actual hints.
11588174	11588895	With up arrows.
11588935	11589876	With up arrows.
11590637	11592398	And we like up arrows, don't we?
11592498	11598304	Although I have to say I'm partial to the right arrow or the right diagonal on Solo.
11599426	11602469	One more thing, you guys, Extreme's coming soon.
11602889	11604691	Also, please don't forget about Ultramix 2.
11605252	11606593	It is awesome.
11606733	11609736	I have been... We didn't get a chance to talk about that much tonight, but... I have been...
11611786	11613247	To do with Ultramix 2.
11613587	11616029	I know some things that are pretty awesome.
11617390	11624795	Don't forget, it's already been mentioned, that there are only a few old Konami originals that will be in Ultramix 2.
11624855	11627937	The rest, you know what, it's awesome.
11628337	11632320	You know what I heard the other day, and they were talking about this, they're changing up the $50 bills.
11633121	11635242	That's going to be a mighty fine dollar when that comes out.
11635882	11640906	Oh, you know what, I would just be like, boom boom dollar KOGG3 about that.
11642737	11645699	Okay, fine, that's a little blatant, but... I did it before.
11646059	11647120	It's okay.
11648281	11648681	Whatever.
11650102	11655205	Alright, tonight for our post-show, enjoy this marathon of music from 2DX.
11655405	11658427	Everything from 2nd style through 10th style.
11658467	11659007	Enjoy, you guys.
