Oh, get your man, get your man

21
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
And now, for our feature presentation.

22
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

23
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.

24
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

25
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,520
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

26
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
demons from hell.

27
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

28
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

29
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Tracked, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

30
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,520
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

31
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

32
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

33
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,520
That was huge. Cool.

34
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

35
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Catherine, the only thing you're going to be riding is me.

36
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Have you seen Malcolm? Lena?

37
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,520

This is episode number 109 for this, August the 29th of 2004.

44
00:05:53,100 --> 00:06:05,480
You're tuned in to the B-Mani scenes, most competitive radio station of all things, B-Mani.

45
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
My name is Rob Roberts.

46
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,920
You might know me as Sky.

47
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,560
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

48
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
farm.

49
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,480
You know her better as Jamie Sommers?

50
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,920
Dark Sacra!

51
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,160
Can't hear you.

52
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,680
I hate pollen

53
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,500
and I hate

54
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,540
not having air conditioning.

55
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,880
I hate my throat and I hate my nose.

56
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,780
I hate my sinus passages. Is there anything you like this evening? Meat! Meat.

57
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,940
This is some damn good meat. I just want to end things on a positive note. Positive? How about a high note?

58
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,780
I would except my throat hurts.

59
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,660
so i had it on a low note

60
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,780
works for me

61
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,340
i could try the high note

62
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
but i don't want to like you know

63
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,580

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,980

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,140

68
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,140

69
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:22,300
good Kmart. Also joining us tonight, the one and only Tech Massa Loki, and I was fixing

70
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,300
the webcam, and I stepped on something sharp. The clumsy professor as always. It's metal,

71
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,300
It's metal! Ow.

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
It's probably a piece of your vortex.

73
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
No, it's a piece of wire.

74
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Also joining us tonight, say hello to DDR Angel.

75
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Hello! I'm here again.

76
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
What, four weeks in a row?

77
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Yeah.

78
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Damn girl, get a life!

79
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Yay!

80
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
I'm just kidding. Alright.

81
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
I know. What is this, 109 weeks in a row?

82
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
I think you're one to walk. Talk.

83
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Bawk. Cop.

84
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:00,860
I can't wait till I get a week off, which I do get pretty soon, about three weeks I

85
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
have a week off.

86
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
A forced week off?

87
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
Yes, a forced week off.

88
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,680
My doctor says this show's not good for me.

89
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
You know what?

90
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
What?

91
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Your computer hates me.

92
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Why's that?

93
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,420
It just does, but I'll make the supreme effort, but goddammit, while you're out of town we

94
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
better have guests.

95
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,660
Or else we'll take a vacation too.

96
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
We'll see what happens.

97
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,660
I'm sure I can...

98
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,660
We'll record three hours of Loki singing.

99
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Just whip out, you know what, before I leave, I'll buy Karaoke Revolution 2 and you'll have yourself a whole three hour show right there.

100
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Can't hear you, babe.

101
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
How's that?

102
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,660
You gotta hold the mic to the bottom sometimes.

103
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:51,660
I'm going to announce to everybody tonight that I am currently on DayQuilled, Tylenol Allergy Sinus, and now Benadryl.

104
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,140
so in other words Jamie admits I am on drugs up tonight

105
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,460
so if I start saying something really weird

106
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,700
blame the drugs but I'm going to have ice cream so that should

107
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,980
sorta negate it because I'll be in happy chocolate mode

108
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,100
it's maracans ice cream you're not doing ice cream

109
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,540
low carb ice cream is not ice cream? no it's good it's made with cream

110
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,980
alright we'll see it's better than normal ice cream because it's good

111
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,260
it has fat in it and fat makes it good alright

112
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,960
We're gonna take a quick break and we'll be back. Oh, yeah, there's the money stuff too. We do talk about DDR and money crap

113
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah, what is that stuff? You know, I was actually playing ultra mix before the show. I want to talk about that when we come back

114
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,620
After this little brain, I thought it'd be funny because I want to address some folks that play on ultra mix. That's why

115
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:44,380
We're gonna take a break in this break. Enjoy the music of out phase and we'll be back after this break with

116
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,380
There is much randomness for you. Enjoy!

117
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,380
You

118
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,460
a

119
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,460
a

120
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,460
a

121
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,460
a

122
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,460
a

123
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,460
a

124
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,460
a

125
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,500
a

126
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
a

127
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
You

128
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:54,500
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

129
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

130
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
No subject will ever be taboo.

131
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

132
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

133
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

134
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I collect your fucking head.

135
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Just like this fucker here.

136
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

137
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

138
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

139
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,500
We are back. Orange Lounge Radio, episode 109 is live.

140
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Uh, in a... Damn it.

141
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
My bad.

142
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Hold on a minute. Hold on, I have an announcement.

143
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Thank you.

144
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Uh, this message was brought to you by Diet Soda.

145
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,620
Enjoy at your local grocer. All right

146
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,460
Okay, so we are live here I'm just trying to get my bearings out of that burp

147
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,780
Like totally just rattled my brain inside my head and now I can't think right so

148
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,260
We are here with your favorite program. We have stiff competition tonight, though. Did you know that we have stiff competition with this show tonight?

149
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,980
You guys are here listening to this show, but not only is this show going on right now

150
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,820
But and I hope I don't make people go. Oh, yeah, I forgot and then they shut off the show and go watch it

151
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,280
But the closing ceremonies the Olympics are going on right now

152
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,480
The women's handball team one goal and then and then Bjork would have sung

153
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Okay, I need the new Bjork album. I am more excited about Bjork than the Olympics. Bjork

154
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,120
makes me all horny. I have new Bjork stuff. Give Tarata Skull. I actually, uh, I was looking

155
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:23,120
and I found photocopies of certain Bjork albums that are out soon. So, hold on, let me, uh.

156
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,120
See, this is what you're missing at the Olympics right now.

157
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:35,120
I'm a tree that is big!

158
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Just kidding, I like Bjork, otherwise I wouldn't have the album.

159
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:57,600
Wow, we've actually got people here who showed up during the break.

160
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,720
Yeah, we do have people that showed up here during the break.

161
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,480
We have Arkadian42 showed up with glasses.

162
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
New glasses.

163
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,200
They're not new.

164
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,640
not new. Well they look new because you haven't worn them around me in a long time if ever.

165
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,200
Yeah well these are like way out of date actually there's like five years this is like a prescription

166
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,520
I got like five or six years ago I'm only wearing because I can't really wear my contacts are like

167
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,960
weeks old I can't buy any new ones until I get a eye exam and I can't afford an eye exam for a while

168
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Last time I came here, I'd just wear them every so often. I'm only going to wear them for a few hours, but I can't wear them all day, because the contacts I have right now are way too old to wear every day, or I might get an infection in the eye or something. So it wouldn't be a good idea.

169
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Miss, also known as Ixplicit with three X's, because he's triple X-rated. He's a porn star.

170
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Hey, everybody.

171
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Is that stinking State Fair still going on by your work?

172
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Uh, yeah.

173
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,960
I want to come play DDR at your work, but the stinking State Fair's gone.

174
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,960
You can actually play in the weekdays. The reason why it was closed Saturday and Sunday is because that's where the business is racking up.

175
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Fridays you can actually go. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday as well.

176
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,920
lot doesn't spill all the way back there on the weekdays no no only Saturday and

177
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,840
Sunday maybe I will go during the week we'll see okay about it all right is

178
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,760

179
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,120

180
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,960
singing on actually she sang at the over she's not singing again I was kidding

181
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,120
about that we had the Olympics going on and the Video Music Awards are going on

182
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,160
right now in Miami is going on and I think a lot of people ditched our show

183
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:03,320
to go listen to that and you suck what I know seriously MTV is so done

184

190
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,120
Just that easy. Alright, we do have some Bahmani news I want to talk about tonight, but first,

191
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,660
we have to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show by playing a little

192
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,400
bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, and starting us off tonight for How Was Your

193
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:59,600
week, how was your day? The lovely Dark Sakura. My week was okay until my allergies started

194
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:11,760
to hate me. I had a perfect score in my classes. Congrats! I'm being like a good little nerdlet.

195
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:22,080
The Benadryl finally kicked in, I can breathe, but I haven't yet fallen into a coma, okay.

196
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,040
But it's just been kind of a druggy week.

197
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,800
I've been on the DayQuil all week, and then I had to double up all doses of everything.

198
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,120
I've been just so drugged.

199
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,480
But my air conditioning isn't working again at my house, so I'm going to have Dan Fuss

200
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,680
at the apartment manager for me.

201
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,960
Yeah, sniff.

202
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,480
I finally broke down and bought a box of tissues, so they're going to be my best friend all

203
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
weekend.

204
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,880
But yeah, it hasn't been very interesting.

205
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,620
It's just been filled with lots of tissue, lots of drugs.

206
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,520
I feel like some kind of celebrity, because I'm popping pills all weekend, you know?

207
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,960
Maybe I should like rent a hotel room and throw a wild party and like throw the bedsheets

208
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,200
out of the window into the pool and, you know, all that kind of stuff.

209
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,280
but I'm hoping to feel better by next weekend so I can

210
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,880
participate in much a random shooting of things

211
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,960
this hasn't been too interesting

212
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,720
very drugged

213
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,400
very very drugged

214
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,960
and robbed stores

215
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
what?

216
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
see? you weren't even paying attention to me

217
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,160
I was trying to research the VMA so I could spoil it for everyone I'm sorry

218
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Sometimes you have to take the radio show by the horns and drive it yourself for a little bit.

219
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,160
I could have said, and Rob suddenly likes pussy.

220
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
And you would go good.

221
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:57,160
I wouldn't know. There are certain keywords that set off my alarm inside. Pussy being one of them, and I would have got you.

222
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:04,160
No, it's actually, it's just been stuff. You know, I didn't even know the Video Music Awards were going on because I don't watch cable or watch TV.

223
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,160
I know. I don't watch crap either, so...

224
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,160
Well, especially since the TV is now being taken up.

225
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Except for Survivor. I'm allowed one crap show to like, and that is my crap show.

226
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,160
You know what? You can download Survivor on the SWIN channel on BitTorrent, I found.

227
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Well, I don't need old ones. I need new ones.

228
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
No, these are the new ones.

229
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
How can they be the new ones?

230
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Well, I mean, whenever the new ones are on...

231
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Oh, okay.

232
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
There's one that does, like, all the reality shows.

233
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Okay.

234
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,160
And on top of that, I'm so happy because they put up the Stargate episode, like, within 15 minutes of it airing.

235
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,160
That's how I was keeping tabs on the Amazing Race, which most people generally agree is not a crap show.

236
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Amazing Race is cool. I like the old army guy in it.

237
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,160
I haven't been watching this year, though, because when Sharla and Myrna got kicked off, it just lost interest.

238
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,160
The army guy is so kick-ass. This old guy and his daughter are a team.

239
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Oh.

240
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,160
And he had fallen in the first part of the race and sliced up his leg.

241
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Yep.

242
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
But he continued. They still stayed in the race.

243
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,560
in the race and then he did the whole um what's the the thing with the pulley and the line from

244
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,840
the top of the swim building into a swimming pool of course chlorine with an open wound yep this guy

245
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,600
was hardcore have you watched all the episodes yet no because i don't have tv i just caught it

246
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,520
over at iguana girl's house okay you should watch catch up to current there's some good stuff that

247
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,560
happens i'm busy watching stargate watch my pretty scientist man oh anyway anything else you want to

248
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,760
you want to share about your week and your day? Uh oh. Alright then. Loki! How was your

249
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,760
week? How was your day? Umm, I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week because it's too-

250
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Ehh! Whatever. Wait till you hear what he did today, but I'll let him tell. I am lazy

251
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,640
okay? I am extremely lazy. Extremely, extremely lazy. Let me make this clear. I am extremely

252
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm extremely lazy. And, you know, before- Wait a minute, I have a question for you.

253
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,960
I have a question. So, Loki, are you in fact lazy? Yes, extremely lazy. Anyways, so, before,

254
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,360
you know, I had farmed, you know, for, you know, hot, really expensive items for over

255
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,920
three weeks, today was just not one of those days. I felt like not earning my money at

256
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:25,280
all. So I bought it. I bought in-game money. So in other words, you gave somebody real

257
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,120
life money so that they could give you in-game money. I just want to make that clear for

258
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:38,120
our listeners. That would be correct. You know what, they can kiss my ass because I

259
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:44,120
got that money like within 15 minutes of paying and you know what, that saved me a good 10

260
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,560
hours of gameplay. I would think about it. It's opportunity cost. Any economics teacher

261
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:55,600
will teach you, you know, whether you want to spend the 10 hours or pay the $20. Okay,

262
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,360
that's what it is. That's especially amazing considering that it takes about 45 minutes

263
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:09,220
to get a GM sometimes and Loki got his money in 15 minutes. That was enough time for me

264
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,760
to take a power nap and then go back into the game and have my money waiting for me.

265
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:20,760
You know on Ragnarok all I have to do is play for 15 minutes and I'll get like 400,000 zenny.

266
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Well that's because that money's worth nothing.

267
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Well so your money's not worth anything. I could like go buy like a goat headband.

268
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,760
And it looks cool because I have big goat horns.

269
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Which would be very perfect for your portal to hell.

270
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
No.

271
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
I haven't touched Ragnarok in a week.

272
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
I have my magnet wire coming.

273
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
At it.

274
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Oh yeah, um, oh yeah, so then I have like some other stuff that's coming for my so-called portal to hell, I have my magnet wire coming, um, I have an eight and a half pound spool of that shit, so I'll be able to make something with that.

275
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:04,760
And, um, what else? Eh, oh yeah, I had to go to the doctor about my ingrown toenail that's nasty.

276
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Ew!

277
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,760
but but well he better like fix that shit cuz you can get blood poisoning

278
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:20,920
anyways so I got antibiotics that tastes like cherry milk it's that's the only

279
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,200
way I can describe it it's like a weird ass smell and it has a weird taste to it

280
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,920
that's like chalky and I don't even know how to describe it like milk of

281
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,160
magnesia it's just weird weird shit and I don't even know but whatever so

282
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:43,160
So anyways, so, I've been pretty much just playing a lot of Final Fantasy. Um, I watched The Exorcist last night and I must say that movie is not scary at all.

283
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Yet, my fiancÃ© was freaked out by it. Because she thinks it can really happen.

284
00:28:50,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Of course, then I made fun of her about that and stuff, so that was fun. And, um, I don't know, just pretty much just, uh, online games. Um, and, yeah, that kind of thing.

285
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Okay, Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

286
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Hello. Okay, um, let's see, just schoolwork and other crap, nothing too damn exciting.

287
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Um, let's see, I played a little DDR, but not too much, which kind of sucks.

288
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,080
but I'm watching Rob make a funny face

289
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,160
Jamie's making me try her diet food

290
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,480
I played a little pop music as well, that's pretty cool

291
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,960
other than that I did nothing except for homework, yay homework

292
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,760
alright, anybody else want to go next?

293
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,760
hmm, maybe. Arcadian

294
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,920
this week was mostly work and on

295
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:03,420
Friday, we finally talked about employing me, and so we just did the pre-work, and now I'm not an attempt anymore. Yay!

296
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
Yay!

297
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,920
Yay! Congratulations.

298
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,920
And so one day, the first day of not being an attempt for...

299
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
This is good.

300
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Sorry, that's such a good point.

301
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,920
That is such a good point. We have a bush and a dick in the White House.

302
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,920
That's an old joke. I can't believe you've never heard that before.

303
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,920
I know, but I don't want to keep you up.

304
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,920
I never had your pulse on any, uh, drink of dope.

305
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Sorry, Arcadian.

306
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
That's okay.

307
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Well, she wanted to talk, so I gave it to her.

308
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Uh...

309
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Uh...

310
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Oh my god, there's an MPB here!

311
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Uh, can you not work it on? Holy shit!

312
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Yeah. Fuck MPB!

313
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
The world needs to depend.

314
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Not that you can entertain any of this.

315
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Explosion killed seven.

316
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
That's new.

317
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Sorry Arcadian, you keep getting interrupted.

318
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,420
Damn.

319
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:55,920
Was there anything else?

320
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,920
Too bad that explosion didn't kill seven MTV Music Awards.

321
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,920
That would be nice.

322
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Kill them all.

323
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Actually, I have something that somewhat relates to the news, what's going on.

324
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,920
I'm going to continue to interrupt Arcadian's little story he's trying to tell.

325
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Not that I have much of a story, anyway.

326
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,920
More than 100,000 protest Bush in New York City.

327
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Those are some mean, mean feminists there.

328
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,040
Actually it's interesting because did you hear about those planes that were crashing

329
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,960
or the Russian planes that crashed earlier?

330
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,080
Apparently this is, I'm like the last one to ever hear anything funny that's going on

331
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,540
but apparently Tom Brokaw said on the news, he tried to pronounce one of the Russian city

332
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:43,100
names but he got it wrong and he said something else instead and here it is, thank you unknown

333
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,480
gamer for passing this along to me, this is pretty funny.

334
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,440
Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously

335
00:31:50,440 --> 00:32:04,520
today. The first crash happened in Bucocki. He said Bucocki. Tom Brokaw said Bucocki.

336
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:14,200
Next intro. I say that it goes in the next intro. Hold on one more time one

337
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
One more time.

338
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Crash happened in Bucocki.

339
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,600
There was a crash that happened and it made Bucocki.

340
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,200
Teehee.

341
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
We're seven years old.

342
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,640
Poopy poopy, Bucocki Bucocki.

343
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,240
I don't care how old you are or how mature you think you are.

344
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,480
That is funny when Tom Brokaw says Bucocki on accident.

345
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,720
I'm sure he must not, when he caught his mistake, if he even knows what the word means, I'm

346
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,880
sure when he caught his mistake, he was probably pretty pissed.

347
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,440
I have to do it one more time.

348
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,920
The first crash happened in Bucocki.

349
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:05,680
Anyway, Arcadian, I'm sorry to keep interrupting, how was your week, how was your day?

350
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:35,660
Uh, let's see, Novomani moves, uh, this weekend, like, on Friday, uh, I found a praying menace that was, uh, on the ceiling of my bathroom, and he hung out for, like, until the day, and then I decided to take him outside, and then, it seemed like it was too hot outside, it seemed, I put him in a shady spot, but he seemed to be, like, uh, melting, or something, so I put a little bit of water on him, and threw him in the bushes, and he disappeared, about a week, I mean, about an hour later, so he may have been, bird food, or may have crawled off.

351
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:42,680
to find some bugs. Or, who knows. The Circle of Life. And the rest of the day was just

352
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,920
boring. Watched a few episodes of Upright Citizens Brigade that I had on CD.

353
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:55,920
That show rocks. Yeah. And Play Along the Computer. And I don't

354
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,120
know what else. That's about everything for me.

355
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,560
Alright. I'll talk about My Week and My Day and then we'll get to Jonas. My Week and My

356
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,440
my day was pretty good. Didn't do a whole lot during the week. Just a lot of work, you

357
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,560
know, the usual stuff. Then yesterday, I actually met some friends of mine from LiveJournal

358
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,000
who live up in Seattle, and they're also on our Final Fantasy XI link shell, so I've known

359
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,920
these guys for a long time. They go by Wither and Ataluta on our Final Fantasy XI link shell.

360
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,280
They were down here from Seattle on a total whim, where I guess they were gonna go to

361
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,880
Marine World for one of the birthdays. And so they called me up and was like, hey, let's

362
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,680
hang out. So I'm like, okay. So I went down there, and I took them to San Francisco, and

363
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:39,540
We all went to the Metreon, which, you know, kind of a famous place in NorCal DDR history.

364
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,380
It was one of the first two places that really had a lot of DDR and had big tournaments.

365
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,380
So I took them there so they could, you know, be at the Metreon.

366
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,260
And there's just other cool stuff there too, like the official Sony PlayStation Store and

367
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,700
things like that.

368
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,340
And I actually played a game of DDR.

369
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,620
Ataluta forced me to play a game of DDR up on the third floor where the movie theater

370
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,620
is.

371
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,620
They have a DDR machine.

372
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
And I played a game.

373
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,620
Huh?

374
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,700
Yeah, Jamie you and I played on that back when it was a fifth mix I think but now it's an extreme and

375
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,060
We would have gone to Pier 39 now. We would have gone to Pier 39. How do we have more time?

376
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,060
I was a little pressed for time yesterday

377
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,500
so I

378
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:21,340
Just I only had time really to take them to the Metreon because public transit goes right by there the bar and to get on

379
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,220
Get to Pier 39. We would have to take a bus would taken too long, but next time I'll make him come back

380
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
but we went to the Metreon and

381
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,820
and played a game there, and you know what?

382
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,500
DDR still gets crowds of people.

383
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,180
Like, we were playing Cowgirl,

384
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,060
which is not that complicated of a song,

385
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,260
it's just a fun one,

386
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,860
but there were just huge crowds of people

387
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,340
that hear the little gallop,

388
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,620
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, you know?

389
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,340
Cause we're trying to get extra stage, right?

390
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,180
That's an easy song to get extra stage with.

391
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,700
So, we were playing that, and it was just, it was funny.

392
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,540
It was good.

393
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,380
And then he played doubles,

394
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,700
and he got a hell of a crowd doing that.

395
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
It was pretty funny.

396
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,540
So.

397
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,380
Cowgirl.

398
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,740
I'm just surprised that DDR still gets big crowds like that.

399
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,620
I guess in a city like San Francisco, big touristy spot, maybe people come there, they

400
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,220
don't get out that often, I don't know.

401
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,220
I don't know.

402
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,380
Well, the reason why DDR is still popular is because, one, it's the only game that has

403
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,220
exercise involved, really.

404
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,800
Yeah, that's true.

405
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:21,920
But then I went downstairs and I bowed down to the DDR 1.5 mix that they still have there.

406
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,620
I missed 1.5 mix a little bit.

407
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:32,740
Actually, I miss 5th Mix and I miss 4th Mix+, and I miss some 3rd Mix Koreans too, because they're all either extreme or they're extreme these days.

408
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:39,780
Maybe you see a Max 2 still once in a while, maybe you get a 4th Plus if you're lucky, but what happened to all the 5th Mix?

409
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,140
I remember when I used to hate 5th Mix, but I totally have a respect for it now.

410
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,940
I always loved 5th Mix, but there's no place that has that anymore.

411
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,400
When it first came out, I hated it. But the reason why I hated 5th Mix when it first came out

412
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,600
was because I was still kind of in that new phase to DDR.

413
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,860
I was in that transitional phase. When I first played DDR, USA was all I knew.

414
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,800
I played USA, USA, USA.

415
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,760
And then, finally, we picked up a fourth mix.

416
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,700
So I was really just starting to discover a bunch of those older songs, like the old

417
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,220
Erotic songs and stuff like that, which were really

418
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,260
my thing that I loved. And right as I was discovering those,

419
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,640
5th Mix comes out,

420
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,640
And when that came out, what was the first thing that Fifth Mix did?

421
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,640
It was the first mix to delete songs from older mixes, in mass.

422
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Now I'm not talking like onesies, twosies, like Strictly Business,

423
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,640
so many men deleting songs like that, but I'm talking Fifth Mix was the first time

424
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,640
they cut a whole bunch of songs from second to third mix.

425
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,640
And I was pissed, because like all the good erotic songs I liked to play were gone,

426
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,640
and all the cheesy stuff from Third Mix, like If You Can Say Goodbye and Flashdance,

427
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
all that shit was gone. It was sad.

428
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,640
How did you point out that 4th Mix deleted stuff from 3rd Plus?

429
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,640
They deleted a couple of the Korean songs, right?

430
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Yeah. And what other?

431
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,640
It was one other, I thought, that they did that wasn't...

432
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,640
I'm talking about like 30, 40 songs. 5th Mix got rid of like

433
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,640
30, 40 old songs. And so I kind of was pissed off about it.

434
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,640
And then add on to that, the frame rate changed, the interface was radically different.

435
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,680
I didn't like it at first but now that you know

436
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,440
now that I've played Max and Max 2 and Xtreme to death

437
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,360
to go back and play 5th Mix is a lot of fun because there were a lot of songs

438
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,360
that only ever showed up on 5th Mix. I know

439
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,040
but too bad Konami won't put them in. I mean like Moonlight Shadow

440
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,920
or Moving On or there's like a lot of songs on 5th Mix that are so good

441
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,040
well the nice thing is a lot of those songs are coming out now in the US it's

442
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,100
like it's kind of weird because between extreme and Ultramix 2 we're getting a

443
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,840
lot of fit mix-ups. Moonlight Shadow is going to be an Ultramix 2.

444
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,480
I heard about Ultramix 2 who's making the steps and stuff.

445
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:58,620
Yeah but you know crazy. Crazy stuff. Anyway I heard this Maximizer song.

446
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,860
Did you actually hear this song? No, I just heard about news about this Maximizer.

447
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,660
We'll talk about all that a little bit. I'll get into extreme news a little later

448
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,580
because there was big extreme news this week. I want to ask you guys some

449
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:14,980
stuff about it. But, first off, where the hell was I? Oh yeah, the Metreon. So, we left

450
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:20,260
the Metreon and then I came back and I went to a Halo party last night. Somebody was having

451
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,300
a birthday party and they had a Halo party and as nerdy as it sounds, we actually had

452
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,820
a lot of fun. One team had their TV outside and we ran a big cable. The inside, it was

453
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,040
great. I was playing with this girl who I'd just met last night and she'd never played

454
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,440
Halo before and she was hilarious. We were having fun playing. My friend whose birthday

455
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,180
it was, we played and it was great. Halo is a great party game. When that thing gets on

456
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:48,820
Xbox Live, it's over. It's over. Anyway, that was pretty much it. That's all that's worth

457
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,960
saying about my week and my day. Moving on. Jonas, how was your week? How was your day?

458
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,200
My day was pretty actually, this whole week's pretty good so far. I got new shoes. I actually

459
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,200
We can play DDR hella good with them. Started to double-A a lot of stuff with it.

460
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,200
And heard some news about Tuesday's tournament in Scandia.

461
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Not sure if you all heard about it.

462
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Oh, yeah, you heard about the overnight one or something? They're doing like a block-in?

463
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
It's like back-to-school bash.

464
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Oh, yeah.

465
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Weren't we gonna go crash this tournament? Weren't we talking about going to crash it?

466
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I was gonna go as Dr. Dick and...

467
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:30,200
I could if my foot was better, and it still hurts, but after ten days, that's up there.

468
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I'm so out of shape, I cannot play anything.

469
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,200
I was all, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh!

470
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Jesus, man, Jesus.

471
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,200
I'm kinda worried about how the rules are going to turn out. All he says is PA in freestyle.

472
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,200
When is this tournament?

473
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Tuesday at 7 o'clock.

474
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Tuesday?

475
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:59,480
7 o'clock p.m. That's during Jamie's show. I think I'm gonna go. I want to go win it.

476
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,080
The prize is a trophy. Oooh! It's a trophy? Because I'm betting all the good players in

477
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,520
Sacramento don't know about it, like Toady and Moogle Hunter and all that. They don't

478
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,560
know about it. They actually know about it a little bit. God dammit, who told them? Who

479
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,960
told them? DDRUK.com. Fuck. Blame them. Why the fuck would DDRUK be talking about a shitty

480
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,060
little tournament at Scandia. Why? Why would anyone want to give that tournament the time

481
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,680
of day? Well, because people are like, some of my workers at Paradise Island went to Scandia

482
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:36,680
and stuff, it's just a thing. I'm going to go and I'm going to break Toady and Moogle's

483
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,280
legs and then I'm going to win it. And I'm going to win me a shiny trophy. You can also

484
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,880
get it for freestyle as well. There's like two people, only two people entering. That's

485
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:52,880
That's right! White people can't dance! It's on! It is so on!

486
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Don't worry, I'm not competing. So, you have a high chance.

487
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Bring it! Bring it!

488
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Oh, you want me to compete?

489
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Bring it!

490
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Alright, I'll compete.

491
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,880
I'm gonna make something up, and I'm gonna beat you. It's already been rotten!

492
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,880
You came close on the marshmallows.

493
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,880
That's just because I know how to work a crowd, but that's alright.

494
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Or you can reserve for SVGL on December.

495
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
I'm not talking about these things yet.

496
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Okay, we'll discuss that later on.

497
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,880
Well, we can say now there is a tournament that's going to be at Sunnyvale Golf Line in December, but I'm not...

498
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,880
I'm thinking about doing something special, but I don't know yet.

499
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
It's only DDR4++, I'm assuming.

500
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
They're not using Xtreme Zola 4++ for freestyle.

501
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,980
Oh, I know that made that's the reason why I want to do it same here stream is used fourth plus it like retro

502
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,140
Old is new again. I love the 90s all over again, right?

503
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,340
Hey Rob, if you're going to that thing, can I go because you need a cheering section?

504
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,620
I hella need a cheering section

505
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,820
I'm sure I'm sure I'll end up going if I the question is if I'm gonna enter or not

506
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:06,100
I'm thinking about doing my very first like actual freestyle. That's the thing. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know

507
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
You got two days unfortunate

508
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:26,100
I was going to say if Rob goes then Magus and I will carpool with him maybe if he lets us and we will be his cheering section because we can.

509
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:32,100
We'll see. I'll let you guys know if I end up going to this tournament Tuesday at Scandia.

510
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,100
I'll probably be there since I didn't get any tickets for the WWE event at Arco Arena.

511
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,100
Oh, yeah, see there's more competitors that are gonna be gone, because they'll go to that, so.

512
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,100
Yeah.

513
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,100
Shit.

514
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,100
You got that SmackDown event.

515
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,100
I got three days to come up with a routine, damn.

516
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,100
I gotta find my copy of Extreme.

517
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,100
Okay, let's see what else.

518
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:59,100
It's also on DERFreak.com since everyone heard about it from DERUK.

519
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:12,100
Okay, um, also I wanted to say fair, it was pretty good except the prices are damn expensive, 10 bucks for a ticket, 25 bucks for a wristband, or 20 if you get a coke can.

520
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,100
How much for a hot dog on a stick?

521
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,100
Don't ask, it's like 8 bucks or so.

522
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,100
How much for an egg roll on a stick? And cheesecake on a stick?

523
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
Let's just say the lowest price for the-

524
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,100
And your mom on a stick.

525
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
That's priceless.

526
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:31,060
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, most of the stuff there is like not even, the least expensive

527
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:36,340
is like six bucks. And those are the funnel cakes. The most expensive is like 25, just

528
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,420
for regular dinner.

529
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,780
Oh, 25 bucks for one of those shitty little carts serving you dinner?

530
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:47,380
Yeah, one of them is that much. Most of them, you can see on those other restaurants, there's

531
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,080
only one that you cannot get, it's only exclusive for State Fair, and those are the funnel cakes

532
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,500
and the fried Twinkies.

533
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,500
Unless you know how to make them, then you can make the fried Twinkies yourself.

534
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,500
But Funnel Cakes is exclusive to the State Fair.

535
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
Oh yeah.

536
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Alright.

537
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,500
And the fact that parking is expensive as hell.

538
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Like seven bucks for parking. Used to be like six.

539
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,500
And I'm assuming there's a DDR arcade section at the State Fair on the kids section.

540
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Oh yeah, don't they usually have DDR at the State Fair every year and people go to dance to show off and try to get crowds?

541
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,260
try to get crowds, the people that love attention and stuff, which I'm certainly not accepted

542
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,260
from that.

543
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:33,100
I think it's on the eastern gate, I'm assuming, because I haven't been there yet, since I'm

544
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,740
going there on a Saturday yet again. There goes my wallet.

545
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,580
All right. Anything else you want to-

546
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,140
Wait, did you say you were going on Thursday, Jonas?

547
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,140
Saturday.

548
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,180
Damn, I'm going on Thursday. Somebody in here knows why I'm going on Thursday.

549
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,460
Yes, I know what's going on Thursday.

550
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,860
There's a concert Thursday she wants to see.

551
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,860
Interesting.

552
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,860
Ooh.

553
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,540
All right, anything else you want to share about your week and your day, Jonas?

554
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:07,780
Not much, just work, school, and that's about it so far.

555
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,780
Fair enough.

556
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,300
All right, I opened up the Skype line if anybody has a comment so far.

557
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,780
If you don't know anything about the Skype line, it's time to educate yourself.

558
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,180
head on over to our website www.orangeloungeradio.com

559
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,560
click on that little tab that says interact with us.

560
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,160
Remember, when we're in that do not disturb mode

561
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,020
with the little red circle with the line through it,

562
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,460
means do not disturb.

563
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,880
We're not taking calls.

564
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,720
But we are right now.

565
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,880
That icon's not on right now.

566
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,940
We are taking calls.

567
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,740
We're gonna go to a break if nobody wants to call.

568
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,040
Ooh, we're getting a call.

569
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

570
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,660
I hope we can hear this person.

571
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,700
Can you hear us?

572
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,460
Yes, I can.

573
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,040
There you are.

574
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,940
Turn up your volume just a little bit more.

575
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,260
Who beat this?

576
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,580
Legend of Zaku.

577
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,700
It's Legend of Zaku calling in, but he's very, very quiet.

578
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,140
If there's any way you can turn up your mic volume, go for it.

579
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,640
Huh?

580
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,860
Oh, all right.

581
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,780
Yes, I can.

582
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,340
There we go.

583
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,140
Little bit better.

584
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,500
What's on your mind?

585
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Huh?

586
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,300
What's on your mind?

587
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,300
I don't know.

588
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:12,800
Let me see.

589
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,420
I just moved.

590
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:21,420
you just moved

591
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,060
yikes

592
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,780
yes i can hear you better now

593
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,100
what up

594
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,380
uh...

595
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,820
you know i'm trying to prepare i need help

596
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,500
no i just need help for a freestyle routine because i have this big tournament in jacob

597
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,680
davitt center in new york city

598
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,300
he needs help with a freestyle routine what

599
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,300
What advice can he give to somebody? I'll ask Jonas, because he's the only one here.

600
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,300
I have one suggestion.

601
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,300
Alright, yes, dark sacraments.

602
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,300
Don't use an orange bat, you will lose.

603
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,300
Yes, don't use an orange bat, you'll lose.

604
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,300
Jamie and I know this from experience.

605
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,300
Okay, but, yeah, they're holding the thousand up.

606
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,300
They're holding...

607
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,300
Alright, we're losing the connection, Zaku.

608
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,300
I'm going to let you go.

609
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,300
Tune into the show, we'll answer your question, okay bud?

610
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,300
Thanks for calling.

611
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,280
Let's answer, let's finish answering Zachary's question.

612
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,180
How do you prepare for a freestyle?

613
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,820
Jonas, what do you go through,

614
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,920
what are the motions you go through

615
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,540
when you're preparing for a freestyle routine?

616
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,920
Okay, the first thing to do is,

617
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,420
the best best is to put a step chart.

618
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,700
That's my recommendation, a step chart would work

619
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,860
because you can tell what moves you're gonna do

620
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,260
and prepare, you know, like a documentary.

621
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,100
Yeah.

622
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,940
Okay, I'm losing you, Jonas.

623
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,940
Grab the bottom of the microphone there.

624
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,380
Push that cord back in a little bit and try again.

625
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,380
Sorry, bud.

626
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,380
Hello?

627
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,380
Yes.

628
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,380
Does it work?

629
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,380
Yes.

630
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,380
Okay.

631
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,380
Damn it.

632
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,380
Oh, okay.

633
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,980
The best best to print a step chart, like DDMAIN.com, look for the step chart, the song

634
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,260
you want, print out the step chart, and use that as a document, which you want to do for

635
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,260
the song itself.

636
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,260
All right.

637
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:04,540
Like, you can write, ooh, I could do a spin here, or a split, or wave your hands.

638
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,220
Okay, actually, yeah, he's correcting us in the channel right now.

639
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,740
He doesn't want to know how to set it up.

640
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,900
fine. He wants to know what song he should do. What songs should he do? What songs have

641
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,360
not been used to all hell that are freestyle-able songs in your opinion, Jonas?

642
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,380
It depends on what stuff he wants to do. Like if he wants to do like, achas or salsa like

643
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:31,380
you can go like, La Bamba, La Copa de la Vida or anything like that.

644
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,060
I want to see a really good routine to gamlande couple personally.

645
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,560
That was actually pretty tough, but it's doable.

646
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,300
If you want to do something like, um...

647
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,320
Like, Orbeez, like...

648
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Sweet style, like, Heaven is His 57 McTighe Grey would work.

649
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,860
Hey, God, for the love of God, no! No indeed dropping!

650
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,840
Alright. I thought...

651
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:02,200
We're gonna go... It's Raining Man. No comment. Heck yeah, it's Raining Man. Heck yeah.

652
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,720
I'm just reading the post of Unknown Gamer's thing.

653
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:13,000
If you want to go feminist, just go for it. It's Raining Man, I Do, I Do, I Do, Cowgirl,

654
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,400
any of those B4U songs.

655
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,760
And if you want to go old school, just play anything that's from Naoki.

656
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,200
That works.

657
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,760
And if you want to challenge the hell out of yourself, play

658
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:36,900
like those maxes. Alright, we're going to go ahead and go to a break here, and in this

659
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,460
break, since we were talking about Fifth Mix, I thought maybe we could, you know, respect

660
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:46,700
Fifth Mix a little bit by playing some songs from it. So, we will be right back after this,

661
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:53,700
you guys

662
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,700
Far away on the other side

663
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,200
She was caught in the middle of a different fight

664
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,700
And she couldn't find how to push through

665
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,200
She danced through the evening

666
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,700
Carried away by a moonlight shed

667
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,200
She sang her soul and breathing

668
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,700
Carried away by a moonlight shed

669
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,200
She pushed her toe up to feel the weather come

670
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,200
Far away on the other side

671
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,700
He was shot six times by a man on the run

672
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,700
And she couldn't find how he pushed through

673
00:51:54,700 --> 00:52:01,200
I said, I said, I prayed to you in heaven one day

674
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,700
Falling in the morning

675
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,700
Carried away by a moonlight shed

676
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,700
I watched your vision burning

677
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,300
Carried away by a moonlight

678
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,300
2.

679
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,300
).

680
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,300
3.

681
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,300
4.

682
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,300
5 & 4.

683
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,300
7.

684
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,300
8.

685
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,300
9.

686
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,300
10.

687
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,300
11.

688
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,300
12.

689
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,300
13.

690
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,300
14.

691
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,300
15.

692
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,300
16.

693
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,300
17.

694
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,300
18.

695
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,300
19.

696
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,300
20.

697
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,300
21.

698
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,300
22.

699
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,300
23.

700
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,300
24.

701
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,300
25.

702
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,300
26.

703
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,300
27.

704
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,300
28.

705
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,300
29.

706
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,300
30.

707
00:53:43,300 --> 00:54:02,500
Alright, for this last song in the fifth mix break, Jamie wanted to play this one especially

708
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,500
for you guys.

709
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,780
This is Dark Sakura's pick just for you.

710
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:12,780
I love you guys so much that I thought you'd really want to hear this, so there you go.

711
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:53,780
I'm not that innocent

712
00:54:53,780 --> 00:55:14,700
I think I did it again, I made you believe we're more than just friends

713
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:20,500
Oh baby, you might seem like a crush, but it doesn't mean I'm serious

714
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Yeah

715
00:55:50,500 --> 00:56:06,500
Yes, my problem is clear, I'm dreaming away Wishing I'd see you grow, that you'd make me feel

716
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:16,500
I try watching nowadays, can't you see I'm a fool In so many ways, but you lose all my senses

717
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,500
That is just so deeply clay me, oh baby

718
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,500
Oh, I did it again

719
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
I played with your heart

720
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Got lost in a game

721
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
Oh baby, baby

722
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,500
You think I'm in love

723
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Then I'm done from above

724
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,500
I'm not that innocent

725
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,500
Oh, I did it again

726
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
I played with your heart

727
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
Got lost in a game

728
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,500
Oh baby, baby

729
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500
Oh, you think I'm in love

730
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:56,900
In a band, in a band, in a band, in a band...

731
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:02,900
...happened in bu- uh, bu- uh, bu- coffee, but...

732
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:31,900
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

733
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:44,020
We are back. Excuse me, I'm eating a gummy worm. It's very pleasant. We are listening

734
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:50,940
to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are, back with episode 109. We're talking about freestyle

735
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:58,200
a little bit before the break there. And, um, oh yeah, if you're wondering what the

736
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,260
hell happened in the chat room, if you were in our chat room, OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click

737
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,100
on chat we had what's called a net split and this happens from time to time IRC

738
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,740
it's a bunch of computers all linked together for the purposes of chatting

739
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,340
and when you connect to our server you're connecting to one of them well

740
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,380
sometimes the communication line breaks and that means half the people go one

741
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,520
way and half the people go the other way so we had a little bit of a net split

742
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:26,460
there but it looks like it's fixed we're okay now so don't don't be afraid of our

743
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,740
chat room there's many other reasons to be afraid of our chat room other than

744
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:34,460
the net splits. That's all. Jamie picked that one just for you guys, by the way.

745
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,240
The Rochelle. Oops, I did it again.

746
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,740
Uh, have people liked it?

747
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,240
Yeah, I threw in a little bit of the bukkake thing, too.

748
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,740
Because Tom Brokaw likes bukkake.

749
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,240
Yes, he does.

750
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,740
You heard it here on Orange Island Radio.

751
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,740
I'm gonna run this joke into the ground tonight. I like having jokes so we can run into the ground.

752
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,740
Crash happened in bukkake.

753
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,740
Tom Brokaw's getting old.

754
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,780
What? He's been doing news since I was five. He's quitting

755
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,300
finally, like this year I think. He needs to retire. Him and Dan Rather.

756
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:11,900
Dan Rather's still doing the news. You know, Phil Donahue got his clue. He ended his show.

757
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,620
Way back. But then he got a new one on another network.

758
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,940
No. And then it tanked. Yes he did. He was on MSNBC for about three months.

759
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,980
Then it tanked. Because they got too used to his talk show.

760
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,900
See, once you go, you know, public mass

761
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,900
You know, audience, you can never go back. It's over.

762
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,900
That's why Ricky Lake will never act again.

763
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,900
Except in John Waters movies.

764
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,900
Except in John Waters movies.

765
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,900
There's a new John Waters movie coming out soon. I'm so excited.

766
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,900
It's NC-17, so it's back to his roots. Good stuff.

767
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,900
All right.

768
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,900
Anyway, I thought we could actually talk about some actual Bamani news that's going on this week.

769
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,900
How was your week? How was your day?

770
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,900
Didn't we finish? How was your week? How was your day?

771
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,900
Oh, that's right. We did.

772
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,660
I'm like, drugs remember?

773
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:00,140
Yeah, Jamie's on drugs tonight you guys, since we about doubled our listeners since the start

774
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,900
of the show, why don't you explain to everybody what's going on, Jamie?

775
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,220
My nose hates me.

776
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:09,000
I've been like, major allergy attacks since like, Friday.

777
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,820
So I'm on DayQuil, and Tylenol allergy sinus, and this Afrin stuff that you shoot up into

778
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,260
your nose.

779
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,460
And then this Vicks stuff that looks like a dildo.

780
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,580
Look at this!

781
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:23,700
I got this this one of those little it's just it has like the Vicks stuff in it so you inhale

782
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,460
the fumes you know like when you put Vicks on your nose but if you take the wrapper off

783
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:32,100
of it it looks like a dildo I put it up on the cam before doesn't it that kind of like

784
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,500
a little too it looks like a tampon it just sort of looks like a tampon too but can you

785
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:41,740
put it can I go put that on our webcam I did it once but here put on the camera again but

786
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:46,140
join our site at uh orange lounge radio.com and you can see the webcam right on the front

787
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:51,460
page and I'm gonna go show off this this nasty little thing my Vicks tampon you

788
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:58,060
feel the fumes but um I got another drug I got Benadryl now and they have

789
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:02,100
dacral sinus so I'm taking that too

790
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:12,620
don't put that I have it in my Rob is sick I'll put a tampon in his nose

791
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,620
Ew, Rob.

792
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:22,980
That wasn't really in my nose, Jesus.

793
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,980
Alright.

794
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:30,020
But, um, I don't know what I like, what I hate more, because I've been, like, sniffy

795
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:34,060
drippy all day, and my nose had this burn in it, like I had this sneeze.

796
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:38,460
I sneezed the whole way here, I nearly ran into some truck that was carrying, like, panes

797
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,460
of glass.

798
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,700
I thought I was going to die.

799
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,700
By the way, Rob, will you put a stack on the screen for me?

800
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,700
Oh, my bad.

801
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,700
Thank you.

802
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:52,580
So, I took Benadryl right before I came in, and I've had ice cream, so I'm hoping that

803
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,820
they counteract each other, but if I fall into a coma halfway through the show, blame

804
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,820
the drugs.

805
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,820
We won't.

806
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:01,020
I'll be just like Ozzy Osbourne, back when he was cool.

807
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,020
He's still cool.

808
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,020
What are you talking about?

809
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,520
You know what's funny?

810
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:09,940
In my law book, because I'm taking business law, they brought up that case from the 80s

811
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:18,700
the kid listened to the Ozzy Osbourne suicide song and shot himself, the one they thought

812
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:25,860
had subliminal messages and all this crap in it, and it was funny, that was in my book.

813
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:31,220
There's also another case in there about this woman who was suing the US government because

814
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,100
a plane fell on her house.

815
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,100
What?

816
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,260
Law is funny.

817
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,260
Okay.

818
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,180
Okay, anyway, I'm just going all the way off on tangents.

819
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,180
That's alright, that's alright.

820
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:46,940
And as you know, the one that I'm referring to was Ozzy Osbourne because I did my homework

821
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:47,940
and read my book.

822
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,100
So they talked about an Ozzy Osbourne case.

823
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:58,620
About the song that, um, it was, uh, no, I read the goddamn book, don't argue with me,

824
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,620
okay?

825
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:03,660
You are not taking my business law class, I am taking the business law class.

826
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,000
They referred to, Ozzy Osbourne's first name is John, okay?

827
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,240
They had him by his name in my god damn book, and it was freaking, okay, do not argue with

828
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,640
me because I am always right, okay?

829
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:19,760
It was an Osborne case where it was a song about how easy it is to kill yourself, about

830
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,560
you can slowly drink yourself to death, and then it was, and the guy killed himself, and

831
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,640
they were, his parents were trying to blame Ozzy Osborne for killing himself, for killing

832
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:41,640
the kid, but they actually, it got turned over because, had they ruled in the parent's

833
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,380
favor, it would have been a violation of the constitutional right for freedom of speech.

834
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:53,040
By the way, speaking of freedom of speech, you remember the little thingy that I posted

835
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:59,200
in my live journal about the RIAA getting a finger from the 9th Court of Appeals.

836
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,840
That was beautiful.

837
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,600
I don't know the link off the top of my head because it was kind of long.

838
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,960
If somebody who is on my friends list can get that out of my live journal and post in

839
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:16,720
the chat room for me, the federal government basically, well the 9th court of appeals basically

840
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:28,560
turned over that the person to person share programs like Bittorrent, there's Bearshare,

841
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,680
LimeWire, those like that, are legal.

842
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:39,580
Also, they shot down the plans that they were wanting to do in the copyright laws because

843
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:46,540
it would have interfered with I think some of the commercial law under the Constitution

844
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:55,940
and I think it's pretty neat, pretty neat that the ironic thing is that the 9th Court

845
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:04,060
of Appeals also was the one that did the Napster case back in the day, but yeah I was peeking

846
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:09,060
and through the news, I saw that and that was really cool, so.

847
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,260
All right.

848
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,080
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

849
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,920
No, that's all right.

850
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,760
I had to load up some of the news anyway.

851
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,220
That affects all of us.

852
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,060
That affects the show.

853
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,540
I know you all pirate.

854
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:23,540
They're also saying that, like what we do through Live 365,

855
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,100
perfectly fine.

856
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,780
Yeah, well, what we did through Live 365 was always legal.

857
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,620
So, anyway.

858
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,440
Yep.

859
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,980
Anyway, I wanna get into some Bahmani news,

860
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,100
some actual Bahmani news.

861
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,100
going on in the Bahmani world this week. And one of the biggest stories actually broke

862
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,320
on Monday, so it's almost old news to a lot of you guys right now, but I kind of want

863
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:44,680
to talk about some of the kind of repercussions behind this. For those of you that may not

864
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:49,540
have heard, get out from under your rock and here's what's going on. GamePro.com ran this

865
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:53,440
article on Monday that talked about the upcoming DDR Extreme that we're all getting in the

866
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:59,920
US. And in this article, it included some screenshots. Well, whoopsie daisy, somebody

867
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,800
let them have a copy of the already unlocked version of the game, and because they showed

868
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:12,520
off the screenshots, they blew about 18 of the unlocks. And I know for, well, I guess

869
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:18,280
I shouldn't say this, I know for a fact, but I know that one of them was kind of one of

870
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,800
the ones that I think Konami kind of wanted to keep a surprise, and that was You're Not

871
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:27,160
Here by Heather from Silent Hill 3. Konami kind of wanted that to be a surprise when

872
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:31,640
game actually comes out whoops cover got blown on that one as well as the cover

873
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:38,040
got blown on three two one stars a absolute b4u the b4 za beat mix trip

874
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,820
machine trip machine survivor sugaru v and of course you're not here and the

875
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:47,880
article went ahead and said oh by the way maximizers in the game what did I

876
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,640
say what did I say what did I say uh-huh I think so now you should listen to me

877
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,400
fucking idiots what it now for those that just started listening to show what

878
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,760
exactly do you mean by that I only called Maximizer like what how many

879
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,160
months ago how many months ago it was like at least three or four months ago

880
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,900
probably even before that anything is when DDR extreme came out the for the

881
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,760
Japanese console system so whenever the fuck that was probably I don't know but

882
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,480
I called it a long-ass time ago everyone said no that's so wrong because

883
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:31,480
This next period is the last one, but HA! I was right! I was right! I like being right.

884
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,480
Uh, message from the chat room. Unknown Gamer says, tell Loki to shut the fuck up, he's a dork.

885
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,480
WE BAN YOU!

886
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:49,480
Alright, um, I'll play You're Not Here for those guys that haven't heard it, because this isn't a Kiriyamoka song, it rocks from Silent Hill 3, I will play that in this next break, but...

887
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:54,120
What do you guys think about this? Oh, I forgot to say Sugaru Apple Mix, my bad.

888
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,360
Who cares? Alright. Oh, but then the screenshots also revealed that some of

889
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,360
the Oni songs

890
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,680
now have basic trip maniac steps, but some don't. Like the Wild Rush

891
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,400
don't. But I think... I want to say it was Sugaru

892
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,800
does. What's up with that? Yeah,

893
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,600
the Apple Mix does. Well, I think it was the Apple Mix. I know one of them I was

894
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,360
looking at had

895
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,720
a basic maniac trick steps all of a sudden.

896
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,800
And it was like okay, so they went and did him for some but not for others

897
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:28,120
It might even be for you the befores the beat mix and I know hysteria 2001

898
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,700
They have basic trick and maniac steps. Thanks to

899
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:39,100
What was it the dancing stage games? So it's very possible. Those might be your mixed steps

900
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,680
This is true. Somebody told me that the love at first sight

901
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:48,160
You know how the maniac steps were in the there were maniac steps in dancing stage

902
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,960
age, but they were really easy. It was like a four-footer. That is the exact same steps

903
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,580
as Max2USA's trick steps. Somebody told me that a while back. I never went back to verify

904
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:09,480
that, but it sounds legit. Interesting. Anyway. But, I don't know. Any reaction to this, because

905
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,120
I was kind of, with all the clue given, you know how those folks that work at Konami,

906
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,400
they like to give clues, and we had Seagrid here a couple weeks ago, and he was kind of

907
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,680
telling us why they don't go to the extreme threat anymore.

908
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,800
But nonetheless, they give out clues.

909
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,680
They work hard to keep this stuff a secret.

910
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,160
And then, kaboom, it's all spoiled.

911
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,160
What do you guys think about that?

912
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,600
I think it's hilarious, trusting GamePro with

913
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,760
anything, because that magazine sucks.

914
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,640
They don't even provide free demos.

915
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,580
What the hell is that?

916
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:39,200
God damn it.

917
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,160
If you want to stay competitive at this day and age,

918
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,640
you need to provide free demo discs so that people can steal

919
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:52,380
them out of your magazines. If you have a comment, you can call in on our Skype line

920
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:58,620
if you have something you want to say. Oh, I'm being told that the challenge songs do

921
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:05,140
not have new steps. Well, let me see where I got that from. It was somewhere in that

922
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:10,500
preview story. It talks about the screenshots. Let's see if I can find it. Where one of them

923
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,660
them had. I'm going to the site and I'm going to post the link in the chat room if I can

924
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:22,380
find them. There they are. Sugru Apple Mix, light, standard, heavy. Oh, right there. And

925
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,620
they say the screen shot is off center. Oh, so maybe somebody was scrolling around or

926
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:32,860
something was going on there. So maybe that's what happened there. Not sure. Interesting.

927
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:37,780
Well, like, well, looking at it that way it does look like the song's a little bit off

928
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:40,180
So maybe the steps hadn't updated yet. Who knows?

929
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:48,900
Alright, well, it's nevertheless it's adding fuel to the fire that there are hidden steps or something. So whatever

930
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:56,720
Whatever so we might be wrong it wouldn't be the first time please. All right

931
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,840
Yeah, yeah, we have older makes two news too, but I'm just I'm kind of curious

932
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:18,840
I'm curious. GamePro kind of blowing the lid on this stuff. Is this... Do you think it could affect them getting demos from Konami in the future or do you think Konami is just kind of like eh, we were done with the extreme people anyway, forget it, let the list be spoiled or what do you guys think?

933
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,840
Since nobody... Oh yes.

934
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:30,240
It was bound to happen anyway because you know that always happens, you know, someone's gonna leak a list or something is gonna happen

935
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,240
That's gonna just totally throw off the plan

936
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:40,640
Although honestly, I really think that before you print any screen captures or anything. You should run it by

937
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,660
you know

938
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:45,520
The people who are giving you the authority to do the article, right?

939
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,960
Yeah, it's very true very true

940
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,360
Uh, let's go to the Skype line.

941
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,120
Zaku's trying to call back, so let's see if we can hear him now.

942
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,120
What's up, Zaku?

943
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,120
Uh, I'm hearing...

944
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,380
Hold on, I'm hearing that, uh, you know, I'm hearing Star Mine is gonna be up for Ultra

945
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,380
Mix 2.

946
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,380
Is that true?

947
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,380
Yes.

948
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,380
Star Mine is confirmed for Ultra Mix 2.

949
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:09,560
Is there any other Beatmain and 2DX songs confirmed?

950
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,560
Yes.

951
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,920
Uh, Root 80s was one of them, and who remembers the 2DX songs that were confirmed?

952
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,600
VJ Army was one of them.

953
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,600
Wow.

954
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,600
Oh hell, I don't remember the whole list right now.

955
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,600
I mean...

956
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,600
Some other B-menius, actually we're going to talk about Ultramix 2 in a little bit,

957
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,600
but those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head.

958
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,600
But there are brand new ones that are in Ultramix 2, it's pretty cool.

959
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,600
Okay.

960
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,600
Anything else?

961
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,600
Let me see, I'm trying to think...

962
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,600
Right on the light was another one. Thank you, Jason.

963
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:50,600
Alright, well if you think of it, if you think of it, call us back later, dude.

964
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
Alright, thanks.

965
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,600
Alright, bye.

966
01:12:52,600 --> 01:13:00,600
So, yes, Ultramix 2, a nice little segue in Ultramix 2 because we did get some new songs announced for Ultramix 2 this week.

967
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:09,600
We had two songs announced, Paul Oakenfold doing an Elvis remix of Rubberneckin' which was a fairly popular hit a couple months ago, earlier this year.

968
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,560
this year so it's kind of neat to see that in DDR and we have a beat mania

969
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,160
song from beat mania the final we have an athletic song that was confirmed and

970
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,200
the song is hit and slap and I'm gonna play that for you guys right now it's

971
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,360
only like a little over a minute so here it is something you'll be dancing to an

972
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,720
Ultramix 2 this fall. Athletics with a hit and slap.

973
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,360
I'm a cyber messenger, you at the end

974
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,360
Let us drop to the next zone

975
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,360
You know you're out of control

976
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,360
Come and throw to the end

977
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,360
Yeah, let us drop to the next zone

978
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,360
You walking in, breaking in to the face

979
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,360
Come and knock, child

980
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,360
Come and knock, child

981
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,360
Throw, throw, throw

982
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,360
Keep this faith, we're at the end

983
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,360
Come and knock, child

984
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,360
You're out of control

985
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,360
Come and throw

986
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,360
B-b-bit away, come and edge

987
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,360
I'm a conquer monster

988
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,360
Breathe away, you can sweat

989
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,360
Take the meat on first

990
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,360
In between, betray

991
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,360
Who the what must capture

992
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:52,200
Asletix with Hit and Slap, a new song announced for Ultramix 2 this week, kind of some mixed

993
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:56,200
reaction there in our chat room that, boy, it's rap, and usually you don't hear a lot

994
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:02,020
of that in DDR. Well, I remember when Sigurd was here, he said that UltraMix 2 was kinda

995
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:06,320
opening up the genre. It's a lot more than your regular kinda genres you typically hear

996
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,140
in a DDR. For those that may not have heard him yet, I'll play little clips. We actually

997
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:14,420
played these songs in their entirety in previous weeks, but here are some more songs that were

998
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:37,700
confirmed for UltraMix II, Echo Image with Skulk.

999
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:42,100
And of course a song we were lucky enough to be able to announce on air, Zonk with Tittle

1000
01:15:42,100 --> 01:16:04,680
tattle.

1001
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:09,340
So it's a little weird but it's kind of, you know, I kind of like it. It's got a different

1002
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:13,500
little sound to it I think could be fun for DDR with the right steps and they

1003
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:17,040
have promised us the folks that made Ultramix 2 that the steps this time

1004
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,940
different people making them gonna be different stuff gonna be good stuff so

1005
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:26,140
we will soon see this November is when they rumored that that game would be out

1006
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:33,140
so we will see so let's see should we go to a break and play the other songs we

1007
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:37,180
said we play all right why not we're gonna play in this break a Kiriyama Moka

1008
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:42,180
with You're Not Here, which is going to be a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme USA.

1009
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,380
We're going to play that for you guys. And then we're going to play Pollock and Fold

1010
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:49,660
with Elvis and Rubbernecken, because that's going to be in DDR UltraMix too. So you get

1011
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:53,700
a little bit of both mixes. And actually, I encourage you all to go vote in the poll

1012
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:57,660
on our website right now, because we're kind of taking a little poll over at orangelawnsradio.com.

1013
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:02,920
Look in the upper right hand corner. I'm kind of curious, which one of these two mixes are

1014
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,260
you planning on buying this fall? Or are you going to buy them both? Or are you going to

1015
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:10,620
neither one. Go to orangelawnsradio.com and look up in the upper right hand corner. Right

1016
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:19,140
now, 41% plan to buy DDR Extreme. 41% also plan to buy both mixes. That's pretty good.

1017
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:24,820
And only 6% plan to buy UltraMix 2 only. So it sounds like most people that get UltraMix

1018
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:31,780
2 are buying Extreme as well. Kind of interesting. But go vote in our poll, orangelawnsradio.com.

1019
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,900
All right, here we go. We're going to go to this break, and we'll start off with Kiri

1020
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:40,380
Amoka from DDR Extreme USA, you're not here. These, by the way, are full versions, so they're

1021
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,840
about three minutes in length, not the DDR edits.

1022
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:49,840
we'll be back

1023
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:19,840
Blue skies turn forever, raindrops blow in the wind and dancing

1024
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:26,840
It would be a much better sight with you, with me

1025
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:33,840
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

1026
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,840
Never felt so lonely then you came along

1027
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,840
So now what should I do?

1028
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,840
I'm strong out, I need to see you

1029
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,840
My body aches, now that you're gone

1030
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,840
My supply fell through

1031
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:58,840
You let me give me everything you had and more

1032
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,840
You craved my happiness

1033
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,840
When you made me feel torn in major smiles

1034
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,840
But now, I feel your stress

1035
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,840
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair

1036
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,840
No, even who has time but you?

1037
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:21,840
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

1038
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,840
To love

1039
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,840
Oh, I feel your stress

1040
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:54,840
Come on, come on, who has time for tears?

1041
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,840
Come on, baby

1042
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:04,840
Come on, come on, who has time for tears?

1043
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,840
Yeah, yeah

1044
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,820
All right now

1045
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:24,980
Yeah, yeah

1046
01:20:54,980 --> 01:21:19,620
And now, as promised, from Ultramix II, Elvis Presley versus Paul Oakenfold, Rubberneckin'

1047
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:47,620
Look and listen, baby, let's find the philosophy

1048
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:22,620
I like how you bring me to this country

1049
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:38,620
The first thing in the mornin'

1050
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,620
You'd rather see magic

1051
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:46,620
Look there, everywhere I see you

1052
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,620
Hey hey yeah

1053
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:51,620
Look at this sun baby

1054
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:54,620
I find lots of teeth

1055
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:57,620
It's all rough and naked

1056
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:58,620
Hey hey yeah

1057
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,620
Look right with me

1058
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,620
Hey hey

1059
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:04,620
People say I'm wasting time yeah

1060
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:07,620
But I don't really care

1061
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,620
I see what I like

1062
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:11,620
I like what I see

1063
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:48,120
It's my dream back home, child, all by myself

1064
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:53,120
No team energy, I'm with you

1065
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:58,120
Hey, stop, look and listen, baby

1066
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:04,120
My philosophy is far up in neck and neck

1067
01:24:34,120 --> 01:25:03,400
Welcome

1068
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:08,600
back to Orange Lounge Radio. Certainly a different style of music there in Ultra

1069
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,840
Mix 2. I think it's pretty cool, though. I like the direction they're going in. I

1070
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,960
think a lot of people are kind of getting sick of all the tran- now, not me

1071
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,200
personally. I love the trance music in the Japanese mixes and stuff, but I think

1072
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,920
some people- I think there was a call out there for some different stuff, and Ultra

1073
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,420
Mix 2 is certainly stepping up and answering that call, so I think it's

1074
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,440
pretty cool. Honestly, I have to say that I was getting kind of tired of the trance

1075
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,200
myself, but- How could you get tired of trance? But that's not to say Ultra Mix 2

1076
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,480
won't have its share of trance. I mean it does have some. I was actually getting tired of the

1077
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:42,520
happy stuff. You know like like love, love, sugar, cavity. You know that type of stuff.

1078
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:48,320
And speed mixes. I like the occasional speed mix but like too many of them is

1079
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,540
wait. Hold on, Rice Princess is calling into the station, wants to say something.

1080
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:57,600
What's up? Are you there?

1081
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,880
Alright, if you can hear us, we can't hear you.

1082
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:06,720
Double check your mic and call us back. Bummer.

1083
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:11,200
Alright, also as a reminder, when you call us,

1084
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,960
when our little red circle is on, we're probably not gonna see your call because

1085
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,600
when we're

1086
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,800
in do not disturb mode, that means we're doing other pieces of show.

1087
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,720
That means we're doing naughty things. Irene lucked out and I happened to be glancing over when she was

1088
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,560
calling in there.

1089
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,520
But it didn't work, that's alright. We'll get back to her later.

1090
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:35,520
Meanwhile, I actually wanted to mention this before the show tonight, and I actually kind of want to make doing this a regular thing.

1091
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,520
Remember how I talked about starting up the Ultramix League?

1092
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,520
I was actually online on DDR Ultramix before tonight's show, and it was actually kind of fun.

1093
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:50,520
Yes, there are still people, believe it or not, that are playing Ultramix. It's amazing.

1094
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:57,520
And I was on there playing, and that was the first time you'd ever really seen that in action, huh, DDRangel? You saw that. What'd you think of that, Angel?

1095
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:03,520
The UltraMix stuff. I know I put the voices through the TV through a little bit too, although you could barely hear it, but what'd you think of that?

1096
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:12,520
I thought it was really cool. I kinda want one now, see? But then again, I said that last week, so it looks like I need to save up my paychecks and just go for it.

1097
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:19,120
just get everything like in a big fat bundle like if I need to save up until

1098
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,560
ultra mix 2 comes out I'll do that and I'll just buy one and two the system

1099
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:30,600
just everything and play so uh you have a DDR buddy now hmm

1100
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:37,620
all right also what I noticed about ultra mix I thought was kind of funny

1101
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:42,240
is that there's people on there that love to sing along to the songs with

1102
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,360
their Xbox headsets on so that you can hear and like I was playing can't stop

1103
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:54,880
falling in love and I heard this girl going and then you took the ferret and

1104
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,980
you made it go off and they're like yes do it again it was funny so every now

1105
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:03,680
and then I would just drop ferret noises on there or I would at the end I told

1106
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,120
that woman I saw I told that girl I said something about like you're trying to

1107
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,920
sing like Paul a Terry to throw me off aren't you but one thing that was kind

1108
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:14,420
of annoying me about Ultramix that I really, really hope is fixed with Ultramix 2 is that

1109
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:20,420
if I get a spot of lag, I get misses. Like, if I get, if I get any lag at all, I'll get

1110
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,800
misses and boos. Like, even if I'm hitting the buttons, my whole game will freeze for

1111
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:27,220
a minute with lag. That, I really, really hope they fixed that for Ultramix 2, because

1112
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:30,620
that was annoying me. But tonight's the first time that's ever happened to me, actually.

1113
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:33,140
It's probably because Loki was playing Final Fantasy XI at the same time.

1114
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,140
Addict.

1115
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:37,860
Oh yeah, blame me. It's all my fault.

1116
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:38,860
I blame you.

1117
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:41,860
So?

1118
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:45,860
I invoke female privilege to just offer my opinion.

1119
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:51,860
I'm laying down like this so that one side of my nose will drain into the other and I won't be all stuffed up.

1120
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,860
Huh? I'm not on camera. My feet are.

1121
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,860
Alright.

1122
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:02,860
Look at the webcam. See my feet?

1123
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:05,860
Have you played DDRXBox at all?

1124
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:10,860
even unwrapped the shrink wrapping off of it. You should sometime. I was gonna go download

1125
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:18,100
the song packs, but I got school. I do stuff now. I don't have a life anymore. I only played

1126
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:22,600
for like 30 minutes before the show, it wasn't that much. I would actually sign on to Xbox

1127
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:28,420
Live and play live on the show, but I don't know how well the voices would come out. I

1128
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:32,100
don't know, should we try logging on right now, see if anybody's on? Sounds like a good

1129
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:39,100
waster. No, Matt doesn't want to try it. Fine. I thought it could be an interesting piece.

1130
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:47,320
Let's wait and do it when we know it'll work. I'm sure it'll work, it's just, I don't think

1131
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:51,240
it makes for great radio. The only problem with it is that the music drowns out the people

1132
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,400
talking. I think it would be hilarious if we could go on there and mess with people

1133
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,800
live on air, but unfortunately the music of the songs, they totally drown out the voices

1134
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,800
if you're running it through the TV, so I don't think it's going to work.

1135
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,860
Oh well.

1136
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:11,860
This poster is disturbing and frightening.

1137
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:17,580
One for Rojin Z, which I've always wanted to see that and never have.

1138
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:21,060
It's a really creepy thing. It's a creepy old man.

1139
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:26,440
So anyway, my call to those of you that play on Xbox Live, please stop singing.

1140
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:29,860
or wait until karaoke revolution xbox comes out

1141
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:32,700
well you know getting that

1142
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,620
see now the whole now the chat room saying do it

1143
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:39,420
they want us to try it and do it

1144
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:42,820
I should've kept my mouth shut maybe after the cage match I wanna give Loki

1145
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:45,120
time to set it up if we're gonna do it

1146
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:49,720
we're gonna do the cage match first though

1147
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:54,200
we will do hold on I'm trying to find holic

1148
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,200
I vote for Holic.

1149
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,920
We have to set up our wires if we're going to get on DDR UltraMix, so...

1150
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,920
Hey Rob.

1151
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,920
What?

1152
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,440
If I, like, bring Holic and then, like, add, like, an extra beat to the end, does that

1153
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,440
count as a remix?

1154
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,440
I can use Holic.

1155
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:06,440
No.

1156
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:07,440
Damn.

1157
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,440
Alright.

1158
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:13,680
Uh, let's see, we're going to go on to the Cage Match.

1159
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,720
I gotta get the song skewed up, though.

1160
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,560
Before we get to the Cage Match, let's plug our spin-off shows.

1161
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:24,000
Monday Night, Diversion, 7 O'Clock, Bamani Remixes, It Rocks!

1162
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,540
to it or you suck. Tuesday night. Is Pump Up the Volume? It's like supposed to start

1163
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:35,220
at 7 for a pre-show, but I usually get really bored and start things around a quarter till

1164
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:41,300
sometimes 6.30. Of course that's a specific time for all of our other time zone people.

1165
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:46,780
7.30 starts the real show because I now have to get up for work at 5.30 in the morning

1166
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:52,580
the next day. I have been cutting it off right at 10.30, 11 o'clock. You know, if I don't

1167
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:56,780
have to do anything the next day or, you know, if I don't foresee the need for sleep, I'll

1168
01:31:56,780 --> 01:32:01,220
just keep going because I'll be like, oh wait, I'm still running the show, huh? Um, it's

1169
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:05,380
supposed to be a request show, but it's really been more or less me just marathoning types

1170
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:10,620
of music. The past few weeks I've been playing whole albums. Um, in fact, this past Tuesday

1171
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:17,220
I played the Silent Hill 4 US soundtrack. So, um, who knows what I'll be playing this

1172
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:22,220
Actually, I do believe that this week I'm going to be playing overclocked remixes.

1173
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:23,220
Oh, cool.

1174
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:29,220
So, I might need to go download some more, but I'm probably going to be doing a whole bunch of overclocked remixes,

1175
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:33,220
and then maybe tossing in some anime themes, just sort of in the mood for that.

1176
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:42,220
But I also, it's actually a special request from one of our listeners and a very good friend of mine, Marinchan,

1177
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:46,040
because we got talking about the overclock remixes one night so

1178
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,480
here you go, we'll play overclock remixes Tuesday

1179
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:53,680
Wednesday night on the station if you were listening last Wednesday

1180
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,240
you heard a special sneak preview we didn't announce it but the brand new

1181
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,720
outside the box which is basically an upgraded version of vanilla sky

1182
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:05,000
you remember that old show it's coming back its premiere is this Wednesday

1183
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,800
seven o'clock on the station other video game types of chat and

1184
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,940
random stuff so definitely tune in

1185
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:14,880
for that okay do you want to do xbox live before after cage match

1186
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,280
let's do it after we're gonna do after we'll get some folks in time to sign on

1187
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,000
there too although

1188
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,360
we don't want to play against people we know we want to play against random

1189
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,080
people's we can mess with them so don't

1190
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:28,920
log on just trying to find us is a good thing my name on xbox live is an orange

1191
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,000
on radio or something

1192
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,200
so people know which ones me so that's good what

1193
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,760
if I like they make microphones and shit

1194
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:44,760
for the Xbox, you know, karaoke game and we can plug it in where, like, you know, the

1195
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:51,820
normal, you know, headset thing would go. I might be able to wire something where our

1196
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:57,840
output can go into there. You know, while they're playing it, that'd be fun.

1197
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:04,840
Well, you know, I think you can use just a normal micro... the small jack ones on your

1198
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:15,240
controller. Yeah, because I broke my headset one time for PSO, and there was one that got

1199
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:19,960
like a Radio Shack. Maybe we can do something. Alright, well anyway, let's get to the Cage

1200
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:26,280
Match, so we can do the Xbox Live thing. Alright, the way the Cage Match works, we have some

1201
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:29,840
new people listening tonight, so let me explain this. We're going to play three songs for

1202
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,160

1203
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:39,800
three songs by placing a private vote in our chat room www.orangelongsradio.com

01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:52,220
tell you to vote before you vote three songs you only get to hear a clip of

1207
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:55,100
last week's winner though because you know it's the winner and you heard it

1208
01:34:55,100 --> 01:35:00,780
last week so I get to hear a clip and last week's winner this case was Loki

1209
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:07,660
with two-time champion Nuon which is by supposedly it's by out phase phase out

1210
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,780
but we know that the mp3 had to have been mislabeled so we're calling it

1211
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:17,100
phase out so phase out is our two week in a row winner and here it is a clip of

1212
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:24,100
last week's winner, song number one you can vote for tonight, Faze Out with New On.

1213
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:57,980
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

1214
01:37:57,980 --> 01:38:00,040
That was Outfazed with Nuon.

1215
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,060
Song number two comes from...

1216
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,060
That's not Outfazed, actually.

1217
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:04,060
It's Phased Out.

1218
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,060
We're calling it...

1219
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:06,860
Song number two comes to us from Jamie.

1220
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:07,860
Okay.

1221
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:10,800
Jamie, you want me to introduce your song then?

1222
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,240
Jamie has brought to the table Bond.

1223
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:17,620
know those four chicks with the violins that play classical music and it's called

1224
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:22,580
shine it's the dub chakra mix and the reason why she picked this one is well

1225
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:29,260
she likes yeah but it has samples from Afrinova it has samples from Afrinova in

1226
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:32,980
it and for those that says she picked this song already she's saying it's a

1227
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:37,140
different mix and I think it is oh you picked a different one all right well it

1228
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:42,520
has bond and samples of Afrinova so see if you like it although it's not really

1229
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:46,520
samples of Afrinova. It's just the fact, yeah, they're public domain samples that Afrinova also used.

1230
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:50,520
It's not the one that I used before was, um...

1231
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,520
It started off with, um, a really...

1232
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:58,520
I'll play it on Tuesday. I picked a different song before.

1233
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:02,520
I played this one on the show before to play the samples.

1234
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,520
Right, I remember that. I remember that. Alright. Here we go. Bond with Shine.

1235
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:12,000
the Dubs Chakra mix with that same sample in Afrinova. Alright, here we go.

1236
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:11,520
.

1237
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:16,520
.

1238
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:21,520
.

1239
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:26,520
.

1240
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:31,520
.

1241
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:36,920
AHHH!!

1242
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:23,720
All right. That was song number two. Tonight's cage match. That was Bond with Shine, the

1243
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:29,960
dub chakra mix. What do you guys think of that one?

1244
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:35,960
I really like that song. It's just really laid back. I listen to it all the time.

1245
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:42,960
It gets a 9 from me. I mean, I've listened to it a whole bunch, but I've intended to use it per cage match once and never did.

1246
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,960
So I just figured I may as well do it now. I've said it on my show a few times.

1247
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,960
I just really think it's different. It's really different.

1248
01:43:51,960 --> 01:44:00,960
kostjamrh I'll give it a 9 out of 10. It's pretty good soothing. I don't have that Afrinova part I heard.

1249
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:07,960
But other than that, it's very well done with the violin and all that stuff.

1250
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:15,960
Alright. Uh, a scale of 110? Oh, no, I'm sorry, I missed the night. Sorry. Uh, Angel?

1251
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:26,960
Um, dammit. Okay, the mic's working. There we go. I heard myself. Um, 9.5. It's cool. I like it. It's Bond. That's like a given.

1252
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:36,920
alright Loki it's okay honestly the samples of whatever

1253
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:43,080
after Nova the tribal people do not fit in the song at all but whatever you know

1254
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:48,720
it's bond so I'm gonna give it a lower score because it's bond bond doesn't do

1255
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:54,860
any original shit anyway so they're gonna get a seven take is I just you

1256
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:58,700
know I've heard that song and I'm just tired of that you know they can stop

1257
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:05,980
anytime Bradley I thought was really cool what well the beat give it a nine I

1258
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:10,540
actually like that song a lot as a song I'm just not sure I'm down with it for

1259
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:14,900
like a cage match I don't know I just it's not just a bouncy-dancy the other

1260
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:19,980
will you I think it would be very free-stylable I give it an eight as a

1261
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,980
That's a song I give it a 9. That's a page match pick I give it an 8.

1262
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:31,980
Alright. My turn. And I've picked a song by a band that's actually already in rotation on our station because they were on one of the Fantasia albums.

1263
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:35,980
They're a really popular trance band. They're on Robins Entertainment here in the U.S.

1264
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:41,980
Same label as Ian Vandal and Paul O'con- No. He's not on that label.

1265
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:45,980
Ian Vandal and DJ Sammy is another big one on that label.

1266
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:52,240
I'm kind of surprised they haven't ended up in DDR yet. The band is Lasko and this is their brand new single that just came out

1267
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:57,520
It's called surrender just came out in the US this week. Actually, it's been out in Britain a little while

1268
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:04,520
but just come out in the US this week. It's my pick, Lasko with Surrender. Enjoy.

1269
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:50,520
To say that I can't trust you, I don't know Every time I'm near you, I lose control

1270
01:46:50,520 --> 01:47:01,520
be out of my mind to let you in. Maybe I should try to find my strength within.

1271
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:15,520
It's only a matter of time and I will surrender. Just give me a little more time to open my mind.

1272
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:27,520
Only a matter of time, and I will surrender, I'll surrender to you

1273
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,520
Go!

1274
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:45,520
The tears are leaving far behind

1275
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,520
To resist you, I don't know how

1276
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,520
Love sometimes can be unkind

1277
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:56,520
Should I lay my heart on the line now?

1278
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:03,520
When sensation comes along, I can't hide it, I can't fight it

1279
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,020
Feelings inside are getting strong

1280
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:08,020
Do not deny it

1281
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:10,020
You've got it

1282
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:43,020
It's only a matter of time, and I will surrender

1283
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:49,020
Just give me a little more time to open my mind

1284
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:56,020
It's only a matter of time, and I will surrender

1285
01:48:56,020 --> 01:49:05,020
We're in love, we're in love for you

1286
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:33,580
every week. Trans is old. Trans is very boring. You have to be in the mood for it and too

1287
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:41,180
much is too much of anything. However, that was still good. I like the song, but I'm just

1288
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:47,540
so burned out on Trans right now that I can't stay with it. So, I'm actually going to be

1289
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:51,820
nice. It gets an 8 from me because, I mean, overall it's really good. I'm trying to vote

1290
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:55,780
as though I would have voted were I'm not tired of Trans. So, yeah.

1291
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:59,700
all right who voted next uh jonas

1292
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:04,900
i actually heard this song before it's one of the dream dance volumes i think

1293
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:11,460
i'll give it an 8.5 have some repeated samples

1294
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:15,860
kind of sound a little repetitive but the singing was pretty good and

1295
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,940
it still sounds pretty good so all right angel

1296
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:23,460
well uh let's see you know i'm a last girl fangirl so

1297
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:25,460
You know it's gonna get a 10 from me.

1298
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:27,460
At least I got one supporter, alright.

1299
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:29,460
10 from Angel. Loki!

1300
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:33,460
It gets a 10 because it's not Bond.

1301
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,460
Ouch!

1302
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:39,460
And a glare. I see a glare coming from Jamie.

1303
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:41,460
Alright. Arcadian.

1304
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:45,460
That was alright. Didn't seem all that great to me, though.

1305
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:47,460
Sorta, sounded sorta generic.

1306
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,460
I probably wasn't really listening to it.

1307
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:51,460
I'd give it like 6.5.

1308
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:56,540
I don't know. To me, it's like the quintessential trance pop song. Like, if somebody were to

1309
01:50:56,540 --> 01:51:02,540
say, Rob, play me some trance pop, I'd play that. I like it. It's cute. I give it a nine.

1310
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:08,300
All right. Okay, here it is. We're going to recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1311
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:12,820
Let's see if Nuon goes three weeks in a row, or if we get Bond or Lasko as a new champ

1312
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:18,820
tonight. Here we go. Here's a recap. Song number one, Phase Out with Nuon. I always

1313
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,820
I always pick that clip, I don't like it.

1314
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:33,820
Song number two tonight is Bond with Shine, the dub chakra mix.

1315
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:40,820
Song number three tonight is Lasko with Surrender.

1316
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:15,820
Alright, guys. Place vote now. You may place your vote in the chatroom by sending a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your votes.

1317
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:29,820
Alright. As promised, we're going to try this horrible experiment out. I don't think this is going to go over very well, but the chatroom asked we do it, so we're going to get onto Xbox Live and harass people randomly on UltraMix.

1318
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:34,440
alright so let's see I have to get suited up here though let me let me head

1319
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:39,080
over to get suited up let me get the mic over let me yeah yeah so you have to say

1320
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:41,940
bye to the chat room for a minute Jamie because we're gonna switch it over and I

1321
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:46,760
have to get suited up hold on somebody talk while I get suited up

1322
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:57,120
Ah, he's putting on the headset.

1323
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:59,320
You know, I remember that thing.

1324
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:03,080
I remember having an indention in the side of my head from playing Phantasy Star Online

1325
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,000
for six hours.

1326
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,720
I'm kinda glad I quit.

1327
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:14,720
Yeah, Rob?

1328
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:28,040
Alright. Wait, aren't we gonna switch the camera over to Xbox, right?

1329
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:31,520
Eh, it'll be fun.

1330
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:38,520
p0k3smot42o my headset broke, we have a catastrophe

1331
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:41,520
My headset broke. We have a catastrophe.

1332
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,520
I'm getting suited up. Sorry guys, I broke my headset.

1333
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:19,120
I have to set it up so we can hear the voices through the TV, which hopefully we will.

1334
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:22,880
So I just changed the settings so that the voices will come through the TV, so hopefully

1335
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,640
you guys can hear the folks that chat with me on Xbox Live.

1336
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:29,720
Now chat listeners, don't join the game just because we're in it.

1337
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:35,040
I know who you are, so I'm going to set up a match, and let's do a light song, because

1338
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:38,660
I'm going to pretend to be somebody that doesn't know how to play DDR, and then I'm going to

1339
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:45,660
regulate at the game, okay. So let's see, um, let's do, you want to do DXY? All right,

1340
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:53,020
they want DXY. It's the old DXY banner. That's cool. All right, so we're going to do a match

1341
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:56,000
on DXY. Okay, let's see if anybody joins. I'm going to do three public slots, we'll

1342
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
See if anybody joins. I'm going to mute my mic for now.

1343
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Alright, so I'm waiting for people to join the match, so we'll see what happens here.

1344
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I think you'd get more players if you were on a harder setting.

1345
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
No, actually, you'd be surprised. You get a lot of people on the light settings here, so we're going to see if anyone joins.

1346
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Um, Loki, any feedback from our chat room? Because you're a little closer to the chat room over there.

1347
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I know you're overworked here on this show.

1348
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:26,000
this

1349
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:32,480
leave it to somebody to try and ruin the god damn

1350
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,300
did you see what happened there

1351
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:37,360
yes somebody's trying to come in and ruin our live experiment here so that's

1352
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,640
okay i think i'm blocking

1353
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:42,000
i'll try that again

1354
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,840
fake laws who always want attention on the more on

1355
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:53,840
the way that i remember i can buy them

1356
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,760
there we go if they joined their muted so we would be able to hear and so it

1357
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:12,400
doesn't know good to join anymore

1358
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,700
got a lot of xbox live alright

1359
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:19,700
Let's try this again. Now we're sitting in there waiting for somebody to hopefully join, so...

1360
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:21,700
Blocked! Ha ha!

1361
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:23,700
Well, they're not blocked, we just can't hear them.

1362
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:24,700
I know.

1363
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:25,700
So they can do whatever they want.

1364
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:26,700
So it doesn't matter.

1365
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,700
Yeah, it doesn't matter what they say.

1366
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:28,700
He's an idiot.

1367
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:30,700
Alright.

1368
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:32,700
I actually wonder if there's a way we can...

1369
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:34,700
Try booting.

1370
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:36,700
There is no boot option.

1371
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:38,700
I'm gonna... You know what, Chat Room?

1372
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:43,700
If this is all we're gonna get, is one loser with nothing better to do, then we're gonna end this segment.

1373
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:46,700
And you guys suck for suggesting we should do it.

1374
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,700
I don't know if we can...

1375
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,700
I wonder what this does.

1376
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,700
I wonder if you can send, like, a screaming feedback.

1377
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:00,700
Nah. I'm not gonna bother. I'm not gonna bother.

1378
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:02,700
I'm just gonna...

1379
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:04,700
The thing's muted, so they can't do anything anyway.

1380
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:06,700
Those are no good to be on.

1381
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:08,700
Ooh, we got somebody.

1382
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,700
Finally.

1383
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:16,700
Yes, we got a match. Okay, now hopefully everybody says they can start. Yes.

1384
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:19,700
Alright, set your mind down. I'll do commentary.

1385
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:20,700
Alright.

1386
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:27,700
Here we go. Are you ready? Dance!

1387
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:53,260
Does anyone know how to play this game?

1388
01:57:53,260 --> 01:58:11,260
It looks like player one can take this one!

1389
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:12,260
Yeah!

1390
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:13,260
Let's hear it!

1391
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:19,260
Player 2, you're on fire!

1392
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:25,260
Player 1 has the advantage!

1393
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:31,260
Watch out!

1394
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:41,260
Call the fire department! We've got a five-alarm dancer!

1395
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:43,260
Just disturb that.

1396
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:46,260
Oh, wow!

1397
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:55,260
Quick, call the fire department! We've got a five-alarm dancing!

1398
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:00,260
Oh, no!

1399
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:08,260
Player two, give it your all!

1400
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:11,260
I missed like one step at the end there.

1401
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:18,260
Let's hear it for player one!

1402
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:20,260
Ha ha!

1403
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:24,260
Wow, I won. How did I do that? I won. I can't believe it.

1404
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:28,260
I'm so excited. I got three points.

1405
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:36,260
Those guys were losers. They didn't even talk at all. What a waste of a segment that was.

1406
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:40,660
I'm never letting the chat room pick a segment for us again.

1407
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:42,880
You know the only good thing we got out of that segment?

1408
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,260
Was getting to hear DXY.

1409
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,100
You know what?

1410
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:45,920
What?

1411
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,540
I'd like to play the chat room.

1412
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:49,220
You wanna play against chat room listeners?

1413
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,060
No, I would like to.

1414
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:50,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

1415
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:51,720
Yeah, we'll switch it back over to chat.

1416
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:54,420
Don't worry about that.

1417
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:55,260
Loki's getting to work.

1418
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:56,080
Great.

1419
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:56,920
Yeah.

1420
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,040
What a fun thing that that was.

1421
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:58,980
What did we get?

1422
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:00,920
We got one person with nothing better to do

1423
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:02,340
than to stalk this show.

1424
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:03,900
And we got two people who didn't even talk

1425
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:09,900
we tried to you know get him to say stuff boring I think someone has a and

1426
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:12,700
everybody got to see me break my combo at the end there and see what a horrible

1427
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:18,900
DDR player I am God yeah you know I was I was gonna come up on the show today

1428
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:25,220
and apologize for for you know bringing old drama in and everything you can't

1429
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:29,300
apologize for something that somebody else keeps perpetuating that's fucked up

1430
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:37,900
you need to stop that that message in the chatroom is from Loki he's mumbling

1431
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:43,380
incoherently at the stupidity of some people yeah right at least I won so I

1432
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:47,740
feel a little better at least I didn't get my ass kicked dumbass got like nearly

1433
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:52,460
last yeah that made me feel a little pathetic that made me feel a little

1434
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:58,600
better and I'm on a controller I'm trying to do a hold a controller and do

1435
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:03,160
the show at the same time so I just wanted to share that do you think it's

1436
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:06,280
wrong of me to be playing on a controller when other people when other

1437
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:14,040
people are on dance pads they say no all right well I guess what we'll do is

1438
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,520
we'll go to a break and when we come back we'll find out the winner of the

1439
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:19,880
tonight's cage match and we'll do the F use of the week but please don't send

1440
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:25,360
the F use yet because we'll get to those a little bit later okay guys I'm still

1441
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:28,360
got a Cali the cage match vote so in this break what do we want to hear this

1442
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:36,360
Let's do Five Key Stuff. I wanna hear Five Key Stuff. I wanna hear Prince on a Star. So we're gonna hear Prince on a Star.

1443
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:40,360
Oh my god, you have to play, um, you have to play Lynn 1999.

1444
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:45,360
Alright. Jamie wants to hear Lynn 1999, and, uh, how about the Metal Gear Solid song from BeatMania 3?

1445
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,360
Hey, that's cool.

1446
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:48,360
Alright, we'll be back after this. Enjoy.

1447
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:23,360
He was walking along the road like strangers

1448
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:28,360
Doing what they think he is more

1449
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:35,360
He's been trying and trying for size

1450
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:38,360
He gets lost the more that he tries

1451
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:40,360
Why oh why?

1452
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:41,360
He feels all the same

1453
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,360
He feels all the same, try oh why

1454
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,360
He says he's right

1455
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:49,360
When the moon is too high

1456
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:03,360
He gets lost

1457
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,360
The more that he tries

1458
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:07,360
Why oh why

1459
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:09,360
He feels all the same, try oh why

1460
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:16,360
I've got a woman in here I'm not afraid to help me out

1461
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:41,360
RE-MAX

1462
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,360
RE-RE-RE-RE-RE-MAX

1463
02:04:47,360 --> 02:05:05,160
We mixed.

1464
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:45,160
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

1465
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:48,160
Roll this down and take a man that wants a bag

1466
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:52,160
I'm gonna kick your asses, beat them, kill them all

1467
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:54,160
Down, what am I gonna do?

1468
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:56,160
Down, what am I gonna do?

1469
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:58,160
Down, what am I gonna do?

1470
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:12,720
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

1471
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:13,720
Nooooooo!

1472
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:20,200
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani Radio.

1473
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:24,280
We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, and yes, you may have noticed a little while ago

1474
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:29,040
that we disappeared from the Skype line for a little while because I was getting flooded

1475
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:33,160
with phone calls. People were not understanding when the little red lights up, you don't call.

1476
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:36,680
So I just went offline so people would stop bugging us while we're trying to do other

1477
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:40,080
parts of the show. But I did bring it back up and it's online now and we're ready to

1478
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:45,360
take calls if somebody wants to give us a call. And look, look at that, coming in right

1479
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,360
now.

1480
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:47,360
Who do we have?

1481
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:48,360
Hello, you're on Orange On The Radio.

1482
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:49,360
Hey.

1483
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,360
Yes.

1484
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:51,360
Can you hear me?

1485
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:52,360
Yes, we can.

1486
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:56,360
A long time listener, first time caller.

1487
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:58,360
Oh, yes, okay.

1488
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:02,360
I really like that show you play on Wednesdays. What's it called?

1489
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:09,360
Oh, yes, Wednesday's show. I think it's called Outside Irene's Box. No, Outside the Box. That's what it's called.

1490
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:13,360
Yeah, that's a good show. Everybody should listen to that.

1491
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:18,360
Hey, that would be a great time. I think everybody should listen to that show.

1492
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:25,360
And, uh, is it true you guys are gonna play a remix of that song, um, what's it called, from Silent Hill 4?

1493
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:28,360
Um, which one? The Your Rain?

1494
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:32,360
Yeah, aren't you gonna play a Your Rain remix? I heard about that.

1495
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:34,360
That was a couple weeks ago that we did that.

1496
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:35,360
What?

1497
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:37,360
We did that a couple weeks ago.

1498
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:38,360
Are you saying I missed it?

1499
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:39,360
Yes, you missed it.

1500
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,360
Aw, fuck!

1501
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:45,360
But that, you know what, just for you, kind sir, I'll play it again later in the show.

1502
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,360
Aw, thank you very much.

1503
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:49,360
Oh, you're welcome very much. Thanks for calling!

1504
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:53,360
Alright, bye.

1505
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:57,360
See, that's a good Skype call right there. Alright.

1506
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:00,360
I've played it every week on my show.

1507
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:01,360
Have you?

1508
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:02,360
Yes, I have.

1509
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,360
Well then, you know.

1510
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:06,360
Because I have marathoned the Silent Hill 4US soundtrack.

1511
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,360
Oh, people should turn in.

1512
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:10,360
If people listened, they would know.

1513
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:12,360
I know, I know.

1514
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:16,360
No one ever requests anything on my show either.

1515
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:20,360
So, Skyblind's open if you want to call in.

1516
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:24,360
Call us.

1517
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:28,360
Pick up the phone.

1518
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:32,360
1-900-HOT-POTATO

1519
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:36,360
Some people never learn.

1520
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:40,360
Hey, I'm just glad they're listening and keeping our ratings up.

1521
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,360
This is good.

1522
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,360
You know what?

1523
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:43,360
What's that?

1524
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:44,360
I have a theory.

1525
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,360
Okay.

1526
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:50,280
Um, I think that, that there was no sperm involved in that person's creation.

1527
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:51,280
Anyway.

1528
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:52,720
I think that it was Jell-O.

1529
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:57,680
Let's, let's talk about who won tonight's cage match.

1530
02:08:57,680 --> 02:09:01,880
Uh, we have a new winner in tonight's cage match, finally.

1531
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:02,880
Finally.

1532
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:03,880
Loki has to pick a new song.

1533
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:04,880
Cause we have a new winner.

1534
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:05,880
Woohoo!

1535
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:09,880
Woohoo! I don't have to do shit next week!

1536
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:15,880
Bond won the cage match, and better yet, we're getting another call.

1537
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:19,880
Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1538
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:21,880
Hey, it is Dark Knight.

1539
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:22,880
Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing?

1540
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:23,880
Hello.

1541
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:25,880
I'm all right, how'd I go?

1542
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:27,880
Uh, we're pretty good. What's on your mind?

1543
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:31,880
Not much. I'd say that the last call should make a classic call of the week.

1544
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:34,880
Yeah, I think we should make that classic call of the week.

1545
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:41,160
You don't want to do anything to try and one-up that call?

1546
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:44,440
I can't come up with anything close.

1547
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:49,320
Alright, alright. Hey, what do you think about how Ultramix 2's shaping up?

1548
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:52,520
With some of those new songs announced this week?

1549
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:55,840
It's pretty decent, but

1550
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:59,080
I'm still like, no Xbox me, I'm not touching it.

1551
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:02,760
I know, it was so hard for a long time to have to kinda

1552
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:07,200
finally say oh I got a cave them by the Xbox but I tell you what once I got it

1553
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:11,860
there is actually some decent games on it one or two but DDR is one of them so

1554
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:15,900
it's it's worth it it's worth it I'd tell you what though on that suggestion

1555
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:19,320
about having a few play against you yes I'm like somebody said no I'm chambering

1556
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:24,580
what why you didn't play a heart song because I wanted I didn't want I wanted

1557
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:28,140
other people that don't listen to the show to come into the game and play and

1558
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:31,980
we would kind of mess with them a little bit like I'd say I'd never played DDR

1559
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:36,020
before and hopefully they would talk, because usually the lamer people are the ones that

1560
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:40,460
play the light songs. So I sort of was trying to bait some of the younger players and stuff,

1561
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:44,340
but it didn't work. We only got a couple losers that can't get over themselves that wanted

1562
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:49,220
to join and people that don't talk, so. What can you do?

1563
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:54,540
It was yet another failed radio experiment on this show, but that's okay, it happens.

1564
02:10:54,540 --> 02:10:56,220
Trial and error, buddy, trial and error.

1565
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:59,800
This whole show is one big failed experiment sometimes, it feels like, but hey, that's

1566
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:00,800
all right.

1567
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:01,800
No, it's not.

1568
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:02,800
All right.

1569
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:03,800
All right.

1570
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:04,800
Oh, yes, Angel.

1571
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:05,800
Hey, Dark Knight.

1572
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:06,800
Hey, Angel.

1573
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:09,800
Don't you have something else you want to say other than a shout-out?

1574
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:10,800
Hi.

1575
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:11,800
Hi.

1576
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:12,800
Hi.

1577
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:13,800
Hi.

1578
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:14,800
Hi.

1579
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,800
And he's cool.

1580
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:16,800
Hey, Rob.

1581
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:17,800
Yes.

1582
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:18,800
Rob.

1583
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:19,800
Yes.

1584
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:20,800
Rob.

1585
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:21,800
Yes.

1586
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:22,800
Rob.

1587
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:23,800
What?

1588
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:24,800
What?

1589
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,800
What?

1590
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:26,800
What?

1591
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:27,800
What?

1592
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,800
What?

1593
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:29,800
What?

1594
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:33,720
Zeno in our chat room raises a point about the folks on Ultramix.

1595
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:37,400
There's hardly anybody that wants to play the heavy stuff because a lot of

1596
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:39,160
them are actually on dance pads.

1597
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:42,600
And it's kinda hard to play heavy stuff on dance pads so he says nobody plays

1598
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:44,680
heavy and from what I've seen that's kinda true.

1599
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:47,640
Zaku's calling back so I thought we'd pick up his call. What's up, Zaku?

1600
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:50,560
Woah!

1601
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:55,560
I'm just wondering, what are the chances of, um...

1602
02:11:55,560 --> 02:12:12,560
I'm just wondering exactly why does Microsoft have favoritism towards Konami in that sense

1603
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:20,560
because they get downloaded songs and while PS2 users get crapped on because even though

1604
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:24,560
we already have a hard drive there's no way in God's green earth we're actually going

1605
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:28,400
be able to download songs, so we're basically screwed.

1606
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,200
Good points.

1607
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:30,360
I'm going to go ahead and let you go,

1608
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:31,640
because our connection's a little crappy.

1609
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:32,840
But I'm going to talk about this point.

1610
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:33,800
So tune back into the show.

1611
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:35,480
We're going to talk about this, OK?

1612
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,760
All right.

1613
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:40,720
Why is it that UltraMix 2 folks get to download songs,

1614
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:43,000
but the PS2 folks don't?

1615
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,760
Why do you think that is?

1616
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:46,520
My own thought is that I think they've

1617
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:49,720
been trying to take PS2 games in one direction

1618
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:51,280
and UltraMix in the other direction.

1619
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:56,240
Because if PS2 had everything the Xbox game had, same song list, same everything, you

1620
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:58,440
wouldn't buy both of them.

1621
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:01,640
I would.

1622
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:05,720
The few hardcore folks that would just be all about supporting Bomani, yes, they still

1623
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:06,720
would.

1624
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,220
But the majority of people would not buy both games.

1625
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:14,240
But if PS2 is allowed to have its iToy thing going one way, and Xbox has its live thing

1626
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:19,480
going one way, then, you know, that's to me kind of, I think, Konami trying to shape both

1627
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:20,480
games in a different way.

1628
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:23,520
two of the strongest points of each system and making that the focal point.

1629
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:28,240
I don't think it has anything to do with Microsoft sucking Konami off to get them to do that

1630
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:34,360
or anything, although I do know that Microsoft uses DDR UltraMix to show other developers,

1631
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:37,920
hey, look what you can do with a game and how you can make money, because they've been

1632
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:43,160
making a lot of money off those song packs. So, it's a smart idea for them to be doing

1633
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:50,000
it. As to is it fair or not, well, honestly, being an Xbox owner and a Playstation 2 owner,

1634
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:56,400
Xbox, it really, really does have the better online stuff. I mean, PS2 has good online

1635
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:59,380
stuff, but it's just not quite as well developed yet, so I guess...

1636
02:13:59,380 --> 02:14:00,680
Yeah, I guess C-Star Online.

1637
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:05,280
Yeah, I know. So, I think that's just the way it's going to be for a little while, but

1638
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:10,840
PS2, I think there's going to be other things to account for that. And GameCube, don't...

1639
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:14,720
I mean, sucks to be a GameCube user, because you're never going to see a DDR mix, probably.

1640
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:19,600
Probably not. The only thing that GameCube has going for it as far as online play is

1641
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:24,040
new PSO that's coming out for it but apart from that. Yeah, I mean, but that has nothing

1642
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:29,040
to do with Konami and stuff. No. And again, it's nothing to do with favoritism or... Yes,

1643
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:35,580
it just has, of the three, the worst online. I mean, seriously, it's not all that strong.

1644
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:39,920
I mean, I talk to people who get booted off of it all the time. Yeah. You know, Xbox is

1645
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:45,800
built to be an online system. Yes, it is. You know, you have to look, you know, I look

1646
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:52,480
at it this way. A system is only as good as the games that are on it. And I have said

1647
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:57,060
this since the days where people are going, well the Saturn sucks. Well, no it doesn't.

1648
02:14:57,060 --> 02:15:02,900
You're just playing games that suck. But if you take a look at the Xbox, it's built with

1649
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:08,700
the online capacity. It's built with a hard drive. Look at the PS2. These are peripherals.

1650
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:15,220
These are things that were added on later. The first model PS2, I have a Japanese PlayStation

1651
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:17,900
it doesn't have anywhere to put a hard drive in it, I'm sorry.

1652
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:22,740
It has to have an external hard drive. It's an afterthought.

1653
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:25,980
You have to look at what a system is built to do and then see,

1654
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:29,660
well, am I going to use this capacity that the machine has?

1655
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:34,900
I do understand that the point's being brought up, but it just kinda sucks that you have to pay

1656
02:15:34,900 --> 02:15:40,180
an Xbox Live fee over and above, because on PS2 you don't usually have to pay extra fees,

1657
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:44,420
maybe certain games. But on Xbox, if you want to play anything online, you gotta pay that extra fee.

1658
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:47,300
So it's what's ten dollars a month? You know, it's nothing

1659
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:51,080
But it's still I mean say it's it's a lot of money

1660
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:56,780
Is it a lot of but a lot of the games that have online don't all don't often require that you pay for the online

1661
02:15:56,780 --> 02:16:00,100
With the game, you know, they're getting their back in this

1662
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:04,860
Yeah, that's sort of a trade-off is that then the games don't really only games that I really see, you know

1663
02:16:05,380 --> 02:16:11,020
Justifying having that extra feel like for example fantasy star online because they have to mean they have to keep the servers up, right?

1664
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:14,660
Well, it costs for maintenance there, so of course they're going to have to charge what

1665
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:16,720
the $9 a month that it is.

1666
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:21,660
That's the thing is that, you know, you're paying that little bit a month for the Xbox

1667
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:25,100
Live, but for most of the other online, you're getting that for free.

1668
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:30,980
And then some of the others, you're paying a very minimal amount to get it over.

1669
02:16:30,980 --> 02:16:35,260
But then, of course, it comes up, the fact that Xbox Live doesn't support dial-up.

1670
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:38,180
That's just because it's so intense, all the bandwidth.

1671
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:39,500
I mean, you saw what we were playing there.

1672
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:40,500
We have voice going over.

1673
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:45,500
You can do dial-up, but you have to get extra stuff, right? How would you hook that up, Loki?

1674
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:48,500
Hell if I know. I know you can do it.

1675
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:52,500
If you go to the Microsoft site, I think that they have a dial-up adapter.

1676
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:58,500
There's a way to do it. I think over on DDR Freak there's a thread about how to get the service packs with dial-up.

1677
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:03,500
I know somebody wrote an FAQ on that. I don't remember who or where it's at, but you can find it.

1678
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:07,500
On top of that, though, I mean these days there's hardly any excuse not to have broadband.

1679
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:11,500
Well, you may still live in an area that doesn't have it. Very possible.

1680
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:14,500
Well, if you live in an area that doesn't have it, that's understandable.

1681
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:20,500
But if you're thinking of expense, broadband now is, you know, sometimes cheaper than, you know, another phone line.

1682
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:22,500
Very true.

1683
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:26,500
All right, I'll open up the Skype line for a little bit more here, see if anybody wants to call in.

1684
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:28,500
But otherwise, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1685
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:34,500
We did, by the way, boys and girls, we had another net split, so about half our chat room can't get in.

1686
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:38,500
So, let's take this call. Our old buddy Jason's calling in. What's up?

1687
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:39,500
Hello, Rob.

1688
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:40,500
Hi, Jason. How ya doin'?

1689
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:46,500
I just heard you guys start mentioning the, uh, ILUT connections to Xbox Live and thought I'd give you a ring again.

1690
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:47,500
Okay, yeah. What's up?

1691
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:52,500
Um, well, you know, as we all know now, as soon as DDR3 comes back up, um...

1692
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:55,500
Yeah, it's down today. What's up? Who broke it? Did you break it?

1693
02:17:55,500 --> 02:18:03,500
I talked... I talked Blue and J-Dog and they're... they're hashing something out, so they'll get it up hopefully sometime tonight, if not tomorrow morning.

1694
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:07,500
I'm sorry I broke it. I was just too much for it, you know.

1695
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:09,500
She coughed on it and it broke.

1696
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:11,500
It caught my cooties.

1697
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:14,500
What's up with the dial-up stuff in Xbox Live?

1698
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:20,500
So when it's back up, there's two really good resources that Cutris posted in the console games forum.

1699
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:26,500
One of them is dial-up users that want to connect to Xbox Live.

1700
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:33,100
it's basically you have to create you have to get a connection on your

1701
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:37,580
computer and then have a way of running another network cable out to the Xbox

1702
02:18:37,580 --> 02:18:41,020
because that's the only way of plugging it in and then do internet connection

1703
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:46,540
sharing so Xbox you know connects and then it just uses your PC's bandwidth to

1704
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:51,660
well to do the work what a pain in the ass it's something that I did for a

1705
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:54,460
while before I got my router as a matter of fact Wow

1706
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:59,460
UltraMix makes it really, really easy if you have anything else. Google.

1707
02:18:59,460 --> 02:19:04,460
Alright, Google. Alright, well thanks for the tip, Jason. I'm sure some of our listeners appreciate that.

1708
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:05,460
No problem.

1709
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:09,460
Alright, you have a good one, buddy. Anything else you wanted to say? Anything else about UltraMix or any of that stuff?

1710
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:14,460
They'll appreciate it a lot more as soon as DDR3 comes back up and they can actually read how to do it.

1711
02:19:14,460 --> 02:19:18,460
Alright. Hey, was it just me or did that UltraMix segment kind of suck?

1712
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:22,460
Uh, at the start of it sucked and yeah, it did. Nobody talked.

1713
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:24,960
Yeah, well. I tried, Jason. I tried for you.

1714
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:26,460
You're very good for doing so.

1715
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:27,460
Alright, take care.

1716
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:28,460
Thanks.

1717
02:19:30,460 --> 02:19:33,460
Why not? We're actually getting a lot of people on Skype now. It's kind of cool.

1718
02:19:33,460 --> 02:19:37,460
So, uh, open it up one more time. See if anybody else wants to call in.

1719
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:39,460
If not, we'll go into the FUs of the Week.

1720
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:41,960
I'm kind of waiting for our net thing to reconnect.

1721
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:44,460
So, I don't know what's up, guys.

1722
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:47,960
We may have to do the FUs of the Week with limited chatroom FUs this week.

1723
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:49,460
I will open up my email.

1724
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:53,460
Well, if we haven't reconnected yet, then I'll open up the email.

1725
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:56,460
So, we'll see.

1726
02:19:56,460 --> 02:20:01,460
Alright, um, I'm gonna take this call because we haven't heard from this guy yet.

1727
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:04,460
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1728
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:05,460
Oh, hey.

1729
02:20:05,460 --> 02:20:07,460
Hey, who's this?

1730
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:09,460
This is, uh, BlackDevilRx.

1731
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:12,460
BlackDevilRx, what's on your mind tonight?

1732
02:20:12,460 --> 02:20:17,460
Uh, not much. I was just sitting here listening to the whole...

1733
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:21,460
Little program we have, right? Have you ever listened to this show before?

1734
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:25,460
Uh, no, actually, this is my first time.

1735
02:20:25,460 --> 02:20:29,460
Yeah, it kinda sucks, huh?

1736
02:20:29,460 --> 02:20:30,460
Nah, it's alright, it's alright.

1737
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:31,460
I think we suck.

1738
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:32,460
Don't answer that.

1739
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:36,460
What's on your mind? What do you think about, what do you think about, like, UltraMix 2 coming out and stuff?

1740
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:42,460
I mean, I don't know, I just kinda see how this works.

1741
02:20:42,460 --> 02:20:45,460
Are we your guinea pigs for testing this program?

1742
02:20:45,460 --> 02:20:48,900
sorta. Oh, well that's alright.

1743
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:52,140
What do you think about the new DDR games coming out this fall? Are you planning on

1744
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:54,540
picking one of them up? I think they're both great. I mean they have,

1745
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:58,220
you know, an awesome selection of, awesome selections really.

1746
02:20:58,220 --> 02:21:03,380
What do you think about the whole fact that PS2 is not

1747
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:04,180
online

1748
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:08,020
and Xbox doesn't have iToy? Why do you think, what's your opinion on that? Why

1749
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:10,580
do you think the games are going in completely different directions?

1750
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:15,440
I don't know. I mean, they're both made by different companies as I understand

1751
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:20,440
And PS2 has the Itoy thing, Xbox.

1752
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:26,440
You're referring to those rumors that Harmonix had something to do with Xtreme, right?

1753
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:27,440
Yeah.

1754
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:32,440
From what I understand, those were proven to be false to some extent.

1755
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:37,440
I don't know the details on that, but we have Konami of Hawaii.

1756
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:43,440
There's some sort of thing that's wrong. I'm getting some sort of double post, like some sort of echo.

1757
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:49,380
down your win app because you're hearing us twice, that's why. It's alright. Don't panic.

1758
02:21:49,380 --> 02:21:54,280
Everything will be okay. Don't panic. Okay, you're talking about how UltraMix is made

1759
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:57,160
in Hawaii and Xtreme is made in Japan, right? Kind of that?

1760
02:21:57,160 --> 02:21:59,480
Yeah. Oh, okay. Alright. So you think maybe that

1761
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:00,960
has to do with it? Yeah.

1762
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:03,480
That's an interesting theory. Alright, anything else you want to share?

1763
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:05,880
Uh, no. That's it. Alright, have a good one, buddy.

1764
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:08,880
Alright, bye. Alright, bye. I'm liking this Skype line thing

1765
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:12,960
now that people actually use it. Alright. Well, let's get into the FUs of the week,

1766
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:16,560
shall we actually wait well there was one more person we hadn't heard from

1767
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:20,960
that was trying to call in so I'm gonna see if if that person can get through if

1768
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:23,880
you've already called us this segment please don't call back I can't pick up

1769
02:22:23,880 --> 02:22:27,280
because we already talked to you but there was somebody else trying to get

1770
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:29,520
through that we hadn't talked to yet I was gonna give them a chance to get

1771
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:40,360
through see if they call hmm no we'll see this is certainly a new thing for us

1772
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:45,480
I don't know of any other internet radio station that does this for their listeners where they can talk on

1773
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:49,880
Skype and stuff. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one I forgot about I forgot that they do that to

1774
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:57,120
Bad me station. Yeah our parents station under station live. All right for that for my mistake. I will give them a free plug

1775
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:04,360
www.understationlife.org listen, they're awesome Travis and Jenna. Yes. Are they they're still doing their show on like Saturdays, right?

1776
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:07,340
Yeah, it's something and they have spin-offs occasionally too. All right

1777
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:13,340
Speaking of which, we have to give a shout out to the baby, because the baby turned one this week.

1778
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:15,340
Aww, their baby turned one.

1779
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:16,340
Yup.

1780
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:17,340
Big radio baby.

1781
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:18,340
Kieran.

1782
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:19,340
Alright.

1783
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:23,340
Well, I guess that person didn't want to call in, so we'll give another chance later.

1784
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:25,340
But for now, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

1785
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:28,340
Okay, now this is the way the FUs of the week is going to work tonight.

1786
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:33,340
If you are on the wrong end of the split, you can send an email with your FUs.

1787
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:34,340
Here's the address.

1788
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,340
I'm only going to give it once.

1789
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:37,340
Get a pen and paper ready. Ready?

1790
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:45,340
robrob.com

1791
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:49,340
If you have FUs and you can't get them in on the chatroom because of the split, send them over email.

1792
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:51,340
rob at orange lounge radio dot com.

1793
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:53,340
Ooh, I did it twice. I said I only do it once.

1794
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:56,340
Alright, let's get to tonight FUs.

1795
02:23:56,340 --> 02:23:59,340
Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week?

1796
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:06,340
We're so full of to anger.

1797
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:20,260
A big F U goes to my damn nose

1798
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:22,580
for being full of snot.

1799
02:24:22,580 --> 02:24:25,760
I hate you allergies! I hate you!

1800
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:32,620
I hate pollen, I hate the trees, I hate the grass, I hate the little animals, I hate anything

1801
02:24:32,620 --> 02:24:34,300
that's setting off my allergies right now.

1802
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:38,140
Okay, I don't hate Shermie though, she's forgiven, because Shermie is, of course, the official

1803
02:24:38,140 --> 02:24:41,140
cat of Orange Lounge Radio.

1804
02:24:41,140 --> 02:24:50,780
Also, F you to the H2 for looking stupid, and F you to the Hummer for being expensive

1805
02:24:50,780 --> 02:24:54,860
because I want one.

1806
02:24:54,860 --> 02:25:03,660
Another big F.U. goes toward it being so busy at work because I, uh, it's hard to talk with

1807
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:08,700
my, uh, throat hurting like this and everything, so that's a big pain in the ass.

1808
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,580
F.U. to it getting hot again.

1809
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:14,420
It was cold, it was nice and cool for a few days, and then the hot came back.

1810
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:18,300
It was like 97 degrees today, that sucked.

1811
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:27,740
um, an F.U. goes toward, uh, shoot, I had another one to name. Yeah, my air conditioning

1812
02:25:27,740 --> 02:25:36,020
for not working, and also to, uh, the repair guy, I don't know if it's the repair guy or

1813
02:25:36,020 --> 02:25:41,220
my apartment complex man, I mean, she's nice and everything, but I, uh, the first time

1814
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:45,700
the repair guy came in, he, uh, just put Freon in it, and it was cool for, like, three hours,

1815
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:50,920
it got hot again and I called her called the apartment manager to have the guy

1816
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:55,780
come back and do it again and I don't think he ever came so um I'm having Dan

1817
02:25:55,780 --> 02:26:03,580
go talk to her. Dan is six foot four okay Dan is very tall and very large and when

1818
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:08,320
he asks somebody to do something usually they will so yeah. Not that you're

1819
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:13,300
threatening or anything. Not that we're threatening, no. I hate my nose again

1820
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:16,740
because like at least it's not dripping like it was earlier because it was like

1821
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:21,100
all day and I was sneezing all day but like the left side was all blocked up

1822
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:24,980
and now the right side is and I like want it to make up its mind just not to

1823
02:26:24,980 --> 02:26:30,740
be blocked up and also a big SU to Benadryl where Benadryl works it like

1824
02:26:30,740 --> 02:26:38,460
makes me all like goofy so I hate my sentences and everything so that's it

1825
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:43,460
Alright then, let's move on to Loki and his nephews of the week.

1826
02:26:46,460 --> 02:26:57,460
Okay, so my fault actually. I bit on the wrong wire, the wrong magnet wire, because I could have gotten this other stuff much cheaper and it would have been much better for what I'm doing.

1827
02:26:57,460 --> 02:27:27,440
And, um, so that sucks. And then also, I don't know, really nothing else to be mad about, um, just stupid drivers in general, um, people just driving like nuts, not looking where they're going, and every time, I'm sorry, Jamie, I'm sorry, this is these people, okay, not you, I'm not speaking for all women, but my God, every time there's someone stupid that cuts in front of me or does something retarded, like not looking or not signaling,

1828
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:32,880
or something. I always look and it's normally an SUV and it's always a woman driving. On

1829
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:36,480
the cell phone? On the cell phone. Always on the cell phone. It's like my god. It's

1830
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:40,680
like these factors. I swear people do not need to be on cell phones while driving. I

1831
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:47,680
never answer my cell phone while driving. So that really sucks and um other than that

1832
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:55,600
really not too much else to be uh mad about other than um you know McDonald's food sucking

1833
02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:02,600
with

1834
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:06,680
my turn

1835
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:07,920
alright

1836
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:10,080
uh...

1837
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:17,080
let's see

1838
02:28:18,460 --> 02:28:21,280
uh... my view of the week basically goes to doubt don't get me wrong i

1839
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:23,540
absolutely love my job

1840
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:27,240
But work on Friday, I just had it.

1841
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:29,220
I reached my breaking point Friday where I was like,

1842
02:28:29,220 --> 02:28:30,980
Calcon, take me away.

1843
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:34,260
And I'm not looking forward to next week much either.

1844
02:28:34,260 --> 02:28:35,420
But I'll get over it.

1845
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:37,260
I do love my job, and I love the people I work with.

1846
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:39,900
So it's just that there's too much drama sometimes.

1847
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:42,420
I can't deal with it.

1848
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:46,300
Also an FU to the BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit System.

1849
02:28:46,300 --> 02:28:48,940
Because if I want to use my ATM card on BART, I have to buy

1850
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:51,220
a $20 ticket minimum.

1851
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:53,100
$20.

1852
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:57,020
when it only costs like eight to get to san francisco and back

1853
02:28:57,020 --> 02:28:58,140
bastards

1854
02:28:58,140 --> 02:29:00,340
that's highway robbery

1855
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:04,820
i'll lose the damn ticket

1856
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:08,940
alright let's go to some other FUs from our folks assembled here starting off

1857
02:29:08,940 --> 02:29:10,580
with explicit

1858
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:12,760
uh...

1859
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:15,620
three hour show buddy keep it short

1860
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:17,460
okay i'll keep this one short okay

1861
02:29:17,460 --> 02:29:22,920
alright i would like to give an FU to the state fair for being so damn expensive

1862
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:33,920
I mean, not only at the spot like my friends, you know, I'd be nice to my friends and all, but my wall, my bank's almost depleted just for the sake of fairness and shit.

1863
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:37,920
F you through shame for squashing the hell out of my stomach.

1864
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:46,920
I know I ate like funnel cakes before riding on a few rides, but squashing me on this one ride in my stomach kind of killed my appetite.

1865
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:51,420
I have not eaten any lunch nor dinner, both today and Saturday.

1866
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:53,920
Either I was full or something, yeah.

1867
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:58,920
An F.U. for Scandia for not posting

1868
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:01,920
what the hell the rules are for this tournament Tuesday.

1869
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:03,420
Like how the hell are we gonna know?

1870
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:04,920
It's whatever they feel like doing.

1871
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:08,920
Who knows what's gonna happen? Would it screw up or would it not screw up?

1872
02:30:10,420 --> 02:30:12,920
An F.U. to the drama about

1873
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:19,920
oooh sim makers vs actual people who play ddr to actually hire for the ultramix game

1874
02:30:20,140 --> 02:30:22,480
oh ok? yeah like you know

1875
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:24,060
how some people say oooh

1876
02:30:24,060 --> 02:30:27,580
people get hired for connections and stuff

1877
02:30:27,580 --> 02:30:30,700
you know like everyone knows that AJ and little B are working at

1878
02:30:30,700 --> 02:30:34,420
ultramix some people are starting drama towards it

1879
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:37,420
where's this drama at?

1880
02:30:37,420 --> 02:30:38,480
i think it was

1881
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:41,260
i think it was in aaroninjapan.com

1882
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:42,780
interesting

1883
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:46,780
I'm not FU-ing Scandi, I'm just FU-ing some of the people who did not post the rules.

1884
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:54,780
Yeah, they are, Scandi has a broken pad. If they don't fix the pad before the tournament, then how are you going to have a fair tournament, basically?

1885
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:58,780
I think, in regards to the other FU, I think people need to withhold judgement until the game comes out.

1886
02:30:58,780 --> 02:30:59,780
Yes.

1887
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:08,780
And I think no matter what happens, no matter who did the steps, if God himself came down from the heavens and wrote the steps to the next mix, somebody out there would say they sucked.

1888
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:11,780
There is no pleasing everybody, you're just going to have to deal with it.

1889
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:26,780
Honestly, people just cut it out, wait till the game comes, wait till UltraMix 2 comes out and then just from there, if it's shitty or not, or if it's good as hell or not.

1890
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:40,780
From what I've heard of UltraMix 2 so far, you guys are going to be very surprised. Some folks that are all anti-XBox and stuff, you're going to be hopping on the XBox train soon enough. UltraMix 2 is going to be very, very good. That's all I have to say.

1891
02:31:40,780 --> 02:31:45,580
we'll see you first when the game comes out

1892
02:31:45,580 --> 02:31:51,580
i can't say why i'm saying it but just it's going to be great anyway

1893
02:31:51,580 --> 02:31:54,260
let's see

1894
02:31:54,260 --> 02:31:55,940
and fe2

1895
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:58,340
school some of the teachers in school

1896
02:31:58,340 --> 02:31:59,620
uh... notes

1897
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:02,820
uh... it's going to be too long for the fus

1898
02:32:02,820 --> 02:32:06,140
so let us speak for itself alright

1899
02:32:06,140 --> 02:32:11,140
Alright, um, here is my comedy for the FUs, if you want to laugh at it or not, Rob.

1900
02:32:11,140 --> 02:32:16,140
Uh, FU2, ants trying to attack you when you're trying to get a good night's sleep.

1901
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:17,140
Ew.

1902
02:32:17,140 --> 02:32:23,140
Yeah, I know, it's not good. And then when you're trying to sleep, you have nightmares of them trying to kill you.

1903
02:32:23,140 --> 02:32:24,140
Ah.

1904
02:32:24,140 --> 02:32:25,140
I know, doesn't that suck?

1905
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:27,140
Like big giant ants, or red ants, or what?

1906
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:31,140
No, I mean, they're regular house ants, but it's just like, it's annoying as hell.

1907
02:32:31,140 --> 02:32:32,140
Alright.

1908
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:42,140
Yeah, you know, black ants, the little sweet ants or whatever you want to call them, and then, like, even though you, like, spray around the house, like, not even a week later, they'll come back.

1909
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:49,140
And then when you try to squish them, they start walking after you squish them. They have to, like, squish them multiple times. It's really annoying.

1910
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:59,140
So F you to that. And then also, uh, to add to Loki's F you, F you to stupid drivers that, uh, try to clip you when you're just, you know, minding your own business in your own lane.

1911
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:04,300
because I almost got killed going to Walmart because we had to get some stuff

1912

1938
02:35:19,860 --> 02:35:27,340
morning but it was really weird is like like last Monday I was like seven hours

1939
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:32,700
and I was like dead all day and then the next few days I wake up like after four

1940
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:39,180
five hours of sleep and then actually awake for half the day and of course I get like

1941
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:43,180
really sleepy towards the end of the day after looking at a computer screen all fucking day.

1942
02:35:43,180 --> 02:35:46,700
That's just the way it is. And that's about it.

1943
02:35:46,700 --> 02:35:52,980
Alright, let's head on and look at our chat room FUs. Let's go on and this one's from

1944
02:35:52,980 --> 02:35:58,940
Flaronet. FU to cable news over coverage of the national conventions. It's not important

1945
02:35:58,940 --> 02:36:04,060
to have coverage of every little detail of a new purposeless gathering of a now I'm sorry

1946
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:12,060
of a now purposeless gathering. My bad. What? What? I was commenting on them doing that

1947
02:36:12,060 --> 02:36:18,620
every little thing and Bush blew his nose today. We have reported this on CNN, MSNBC

1948
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:24,020
and the Discovery Channel. It looks like our net split is fixed. However, if you submitted

1949
02:36:54,020 --> 02:36:59,140
lot of people start school tomorrow. Sorry guys. Um, F.U. to President Bush for exploiting

1950
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:02,820
9-11 for another four years in office, hence picking New York City as the location for

1951
02:37:02,820 --> 02:37:06,740
the Republican National Convention. F.U. to the hip-hop being the dominating force in

1952
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:11,740
this year's VMAs and in mainstream music in general. Did you get my F.U.? Yes, I did.

1953
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:16,220
Oh yeah, we said, fuck you to the video music award. Oh yes, I have to spoil those, don't

1954
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:21,860
I? My bad. Hold on. Who the fuck wants to know? It's all stupid crap. I know it is,

1955
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:26,520
But I I want to spoil it for those people that were thinking about going to watch it

1956
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:35,140
I'll get I'll get to it you guys here. Let's see

1957
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:38,700
That's it. That's it out. Where's the winners list here

1958
02:37:40,460 --> 02:37:43,260
Video of the year was outcast. Hey, yeah

1959
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:49,180
Which also won the award for most overplayed song of the year. Oh wait. No, that was that was me and

1960
02:37:49,180 --> 02:37:56,680
And best male video, Usher, big surprise. Best female video, Beyonce, big surprise. Best fruit video, no doubt.

1961
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:58,180
Great! Now you don't have to watch.

1962
02:37:58,180 --> 02:38:00,180
Yay! You don't have to watch.

1963
02:38:00,180 --> 02:38:01,180
A public service announcement.

1964
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:06,180
You don't have to watch one of the 500 million, three billion repeats that they play every fucking day.

1965
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:07,180
Alright.

1966
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:15,180
Elle Mullet would like to say F you to the Japanese DDR elitists who have no idea what they're talking about.

1967
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:18,180
And an F you to my college classes that start tomorrow.

1968
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:24,180
Dark Knight says, an F.U. for not having a car and an F.U. for not thinking of another F.U.

1969
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:31,180
Black Devil says, F.U. to my iTunes radio connection. When I was calling over Skype, I heard an echo of my voice and your voice.

1970
02:38:31,180 --> 02:38:34,180
It was like six voices in my head and it was hard to concentrate.

1971
02:38:34,180 --> 02:38:36,180
Turn down the volume next time you call in.

1972
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:42,180
Misty says, F.Me. because while I did find my karaoke revolution mic, I think it's broken.

1973
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:45,420
And in a lesser FU to me for not getting off my ass and driving, I could have kicked some

1974
02:38:45,420 --> 02:38:48,660
ass in a DDR tournament this weekend.

1975
02:38:48,660 --> 02:38:54,620
And VX JasonXV says, FU number one to OtherSideIRC, why are you unstable at the moment?

1976
02:38:54,620 --> 02:39:00,180
FU number two from all of us at Orange Lounge Radio and then some, FU to Newt.

1977
02:39:00,180 --> 02:39:04,940
And FU number three, FU to Netsplitz in general.

1978
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:06,460
All right.

1979
02:39:06,460 --> 02:39:10,520
Now let's take a look at the FUs that came in over email, because I promised that I would

1980
02:39:10,520 --> 02:39:12,100
read the ones on email.

1981
02:39:12,100 --> 02:39:16,300
I apologize if I mispronounce this name because it has an extra E from what I'm used to but

1982
02:39:16,300 --> 02:39:22,880
it looks like Renee says F U to Japanese hentai censorship and at myself for probably setting

1983
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:28,460
a record kick action to myself so fast for a first time user. Well that's okay. You live

1984
02:39:28,460 --> 02:39:32,820
you learn. As long as you're being good now that's the important point. Zeno would like

1985
02:39:32,820 --> 02:39:39,440
to say F U damn IRC network splits. That and fractions. Numbers of the devil. And this

1986
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:45,720
weird cut on my hand that doesn't want to heal and lastly I don't have an alias

1987
02:39:45,720 --> 02:39:50,000
for this guy I only got the full name here so we'll call him Robert B Robert

1988
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:54,260
B says a big f you to dial up for being so shitty and another f you to me for

1989
02:39:54,260 --> 02:39:59,000
not getting cable crown fractions the number of the devil but call me the

1990
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:04,880
devil's friend aren't you a map weren't you a math major or something yes I see

1991
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:14,440
how it is. You're in cahoots with the devil. Now even I'm scared. Yikes. Alright. I think

1992
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:17,520
what we'll do is we're going to go to a break and when we come back from a break we'll do

1993
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:21,020
a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge. Oh but first I wanted to mention some more Bomani

1994
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:25,580
news going on because you know there was other news that happened this week besides the extreme

1995
02:40:25,580 --> 02:40:31,320
unlocks being revealed. There was a preview movie for Dancing Stage Fever that came out

1996
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:35,320
and you can actually see a link to this video right on our website at orangeontradio.com

1997
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:39,880
it's about the fifth story down. What this video showed, it was very interesting, it

1998
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:45,580
showed some of the song banners and stuff, but it also had karaoke lyrics. Now granted,

1999
02:40:45,580 --> 02:40:50,920
it's the Europe version of DDR, not the USA version of DDR, but, hmm, typically they use

2000
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:57,300
very similar engines. So, hmm, you kind of wonder, is karaoke lyrics something that's

2001
02:40:57,300 --> 02:41:01,640
coming? I don't know. Especially with the karaoke revolution crossovers, it'll make

2002
02:41:01,640 --> 02:41:07,320
a lot of sense. But, despite that, if you do live in Europe and you have access to dancing

2003
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:13,740
stage games, then hey, there you go, you get karaoke lyrics. And you get a really good

2004
02:41:13,740 --> 02:41:20,420
song list, by the way. You guys get an awesome song list. And DDR Festival was confirmed

2005
02:41:20,420 --> 02:41:26,160
by Konami. It is coming, it does support the iToy, and it's coming November 18th. You wanna

2006
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:30,200
to know why it's confirmed because they set up a website for it and you can see

2007
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:34,360
this link right there on our website orange launch radio.com it's right there

2008
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:41,320
on our front page alrighty alright oops it was dancing stage

2009
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:45,120
fusion not fever I don't know why it says in the headline fever we've got to

2010
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:49,920
fix that it's actually fusion our bad our bad

2011
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:56,420
Alright. We will be right back after this break.

2012
02:41:56,420 --> 02:42:00,820
Uh, Jamie wanted more Five Keys, so I said sure, because she wanted to hear

2013
02:42:00,820 --> 02:42:05,020
more Rugged Ash. So, why not? We'll do some Rugged Ash.

2014
02:42:05,020 --> 02:42:09,020
Rugged Ash is fun to play. Yeah, we'll do Logical Dash and, um,

2015
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:13,420
The Fall. Nah, we're gonna do The Fall. Fall Another. I don't have Fall Another.

2016
02:42:13,420 --> 02:42:17,340
We'll do The Fall Regular. We'll be back after th- Oh, these songs are also short. We can fit in

2017
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:18,020
Salamander.

2018
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:21,020
Hey, do you have, um, uh, Believe Again?

2019
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:24,020
Or Beginning of Life?

2020
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:28,020
Uh, yes, and because I can't find Salamander right now, we'll do Beginning of Life.

2021
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:29,020
Sorry, Angel.

2022
02:42:29,020 --> 02:42:31,020
Alright, so four names.

2023
02:42:31,020 --> 02:42:34,020
Oh, I did, it was, it was not Renee, it was Rene.

2024
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:38,020
And it's just, but that, I didn't think that was right, because that would be too obvious,

2025
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:42,020
and usually people's names aren't quite as obvious, unless you're named Rob, like me.

2026
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:43,020
It was Rene.

2027
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:45,020
My bad, my bad.

2028
02:42:45,020 --> 02:42:49,620
You try doing a radio show I'm pronouncing everything right. All right. We'll be back on break. Okay

The

2031
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:27,020
The

2032
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:31,020
The

2033
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:35,020
The

2034
02:43:35,020 --> 02:43:39,020
The

2035
02:43:39,020 --> 02:43:43,020
The

2036
02:43:43,020 --> 02:44:11,140
Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously

2037
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:12,140
today.

2038
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:19,140

02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:45,140
That's it.

2043
02:46:45,140 --> 02:46:46,140
That's it.

2044
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:51,140

2049
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:38,560
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

2050
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:42,960
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

2051
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:49,760
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

2052
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:53,560
We are back, and I thought since we have a little bit of show left,

2053
02:48:53,560 --> 02:48:55,960
maybe we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2054
02:48:55,960 --> 02:49:00,460
So you can actually send a question over private message right now to Sky,

2055
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:02,420
and we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

2056
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:06,160
But first, we'll go ahead and open up the Skype line,

2057
02:49:06,160 --> 02:49:11,040
If anybody has any comments or whatever or maybe there's something they want to ask over the skype line. I don't know. I

2058
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:14,040
Don't know what you guys are thinking

2059
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:15,580
We'll see

2060
02:49:15,580 --> 02:49:16,680
um

2061
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:18,680
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, I

2062
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:21,640
Guess I should cue the theme theme music, huh? I

2063
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:28,320
Was looking for something else real fast. I was gonna try and read something funny, but I don't think I'm gonna have time so

2064
02:49:28,940 --> 02:49:33,160
Nothing is funny anymore. Yeah, I lament cry cry

2065
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:36,160
Zaku is calling us again. What's up?

2066
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:40,160
What's up?

2067
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:50,160
Let me see. I'm just wondering. I mean I'm having trouble playing 2DX because all I'm doing is 5P.

2068
02:49:51,160 --> 02:49:54,160
And I want to break into 7. How do I make that jump?

2069
02:49:55,160 --> 02:49:59,160
Alright, I'm going to go ahead and go because our connection is a little messed up. I'm going to answer that for you, okay?

2070
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:04,160
Alright, keep listening. How do you make the jump from 5 key to 7 key?

2071
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:07,160
But before we answer the question, I have to do the theme music.

2072
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:18,160
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2073
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:22,160
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2074
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:25,160
When we use the Skype Line, random people call in.

2075
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:32,160
call in, but I sure hope that one guy doesn't call us anymore, and I hope he got a life.

2076
02:50:32,340 --> 02:50:37,700
But I'm not gonna wish for things that won't happen. Alright. Anyway, let's go back to

2077
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:44,700
people we do like to hear from. Zaku, how do you make the jump from 5 key to 7 key?

2078
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:52,060
You just do it. Yeah, honestly, you just have to do it. My advice, honestly, when you play

2079
02:50:52,060 --> 02:50:57,280
play 2DX, don't play 5 key, ever, because you'll just be kind of ruining it. But here's

2080
02:50:57,280 --> 02:51:02,900
the thing, start on light 7, use beginner mode if you can, just whatever it does to

2081
02:51:02,900 --> 02:51:06,740
ease you into the 7 keys. Just because you can do a 4 star on 5 key, it doesn't mean

2082
02:51:06,740 --> 02:51:11,080
you can do a 4 star on 7 key. Adding those two extra buttons will do so much. So just

2083
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:15,460
go back to the ones, and that's really the only way you can do it. Put your turntable

2084
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:19,820
on the same side that you had it in 5 key games if you're playing from there, if that

2085
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:25,580
helps you I don't know otherwise you just have to practice there's no magic

2086
02:51:25,580 --> 02:51:30,380
way to do it learn how to pinky scratch drill mode if you have six or seven

2087
02:51:30,380 --> 02:51:34,100
style or I'm sorry fifth or sixth style and I think it was the seventh to use

2088
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:37,780
drill mode it really really helps and teach you a lot teaches you a lot of

2089
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:42,860
tricks it can be a little repetitive at first but it really really helps so do

2090
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:48,060
yourself a favor and try that okay you might want to also when I first started

2091
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:54,600
doing it I had to learn to recenter my hands. A lot of people will do five to

2092
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:58,440
five keys and then use two to the other. I actually just center my hands

2093
02:51:58,440 --> 02:52:05,080
completely over the middle four and play like that. I use my thumbs a lot. I mean

2094
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:08,520
so it's how you position your fingers too with a lot of it. Just keep

2095
02:52:08,520 --> 02:52:12,660
experimenting until you find something that's comfortable. All right. It'll just

2096
02:52:12,660 --> 02:52:17,640
click one moment. It will. All right, moving on. Let's, I want to take some

2097
02:52:17,640 --> 02:52:22,120
questions that came in from the chat room, including

2098
02:52:22,120 --> 02:52:26,400
puppy has a question for us. Puppy wants to know when are we gonna go out and

2099
02:52:26,400 --> 02:52:28,040
have boba with him again?

2100
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:31,640
Um, whenever I can cheat.

2101
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:34,720
When you buy me my humbee.

2102
02:52:34,720 --> 02:52:40,400
I do think a boba trip is in order, I just don't know when yet.

2103
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:45,520
Sorry guys. I don't know when yet. I've been kind of busy lately.

2104
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:49,320
We do have a three-day weekend coming up, but I promise, promise, promise

2105
02:52:49,320 --> 02:52:52,880
a special somebody that I would go to the club with him Sunday night after the show

2106
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:56,040
next week, so. Okay. But maybe next time.

2107
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:59,880
We'll see. Certainly by the next time VX JasonXV visits,

2108
02:52:59,880 --> 02:53:04,900
that's for sure. Uh, Zaku wants to submit another question. Skyline's open, too, if you

2109
02:53:04,900 --> 02:53:05,560
want to call in.

2110
02:53:05,560 --> 02:53:09,160
Um, what was the worst summer job you ever had?

2111
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:13,440
I worked at a grocery store for a week.

2112
02:53:13,440 --> 02:53:16,920
for a week what happened? It was supposed to be my first job

2113
02:53:16,920 --> 02:53:20,320
I was gonna work at the grocery store. I had been offered a job at the game room

2114
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:21,320
during orientation

2115
02:53:21,320 --> 02:53:24,880
at my college but I wasn't actually a student yet so

2116
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:27,880
to earn some money over the summer I was gonna work at a grocery store

2117
02:53:27,880 --> 02:53:31,640
and it turned out that they were

2118
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:35,600
if I was supposed to get off at like nine I didn't get off work

2119
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:39,400
until midnight. I was like excuse me screw this

2120
02:53:39,400 --> 02:53:43,000
so I quit took my last paycheck and then like

2121
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Two weeks later I was working on campus.

2122
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Well, uh, here's just a simple question. Didn't you get my instant message over the forums lately?

2123
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Oh, yes, about Popin' Music 12. Yes, I did.

2124
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Yeah, I was just wondering.

2125
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:28,000
You want us to whore out Popin' Music 12. We can do that.

2126
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Yep.

2127
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Alright, we'll talk Popin' Music 12 just for you, Siggy.

2128
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Just after this.

2129
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Okay.

2130
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,000
After this segment.

2131
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Well, we don't have much time left in the show, so we'll probably get to that and finish out the show here.

2132
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Just finish this right now.

2133
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:50,040
right now. Alrighty. Thanks for the reminder. Alright. Alright, later. Later. Yes, I did

2134
02:54:50,040 --> 02:54:56,160
want to get to that. Darkline had sent us a message over the forums. Let me go grab

2135
02:54:56,160 --> 02:55:01,280
that right now. We actually have to wrap up the show so I just want to do a few more news

2136
02:55:01,280 --> 02:55:06,800
items and then we'll finish up here. Let me see. Let me get in there. We did briefly mention

2137
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:11,600
it in one of our other news articles but Pava Music 12 is location testing right now. That's

2138
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:15,640
really high for a Bomani Game 12 mix or whatever, but they don't call it mix. It's just popping

2139
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:21,000
12. It has a bunch of new licenses in it. Well, not a bunch, but at least three that

2140
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:24,640
have been announced so far. Cruel Angels Thesis is one of them.

2141
02:55:24,640 --> 02:55:28,840
Dude, that's like as the Evangelion theme. Exactly, so there's tons of people who are

2142
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:32,920
going to love that. And then some new Konami originals as well. I see the Parkettes are

2143
02:55:32,920 --> 02:55:39,100
in there. Jimmy Weckl has one, and D. Crew has a song. You can head over to Bomani Style.

2144
02:55:39,100 --> 02:55:42,860
actually posted about this a couple days ago I'd feel a little weird just copying

2145
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:46,700
and pasting what they wrote so honestly just head over my style they've got all

2146
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:50,380
the news on it they also have screenshots and it looks like they're

2147
02:55:50,380 --> 02:55:53,420
kind of you know how the recent Papa musics they've kind of had a theme like

2148
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:57,820
Papa music 11 was like world travel was kind of what that was all about it looks

2149
02:55:57,820 --> 02:56:03,340
like Papa music 12 theme is traditional Japan because you notice that the the

2150
02:56:03,340 --> 02:56:09,080
mascots are wearing the kind of like kimono and every all the artwork looks

2151
02:56:09,080 --> 02:56:14,540
looks, for lack of a better word, looks a little chinky. That's basically what it's

2152
02:56:14,540 --> 02:56:19,700
about, so. Pop Meets the Twelve, we will definitely, when we find out more information about it,

2153
02:56:19,700 --> 02:56:27,580
we will post it on over to our website over on OrangelaungeRadio.com. Alright, what else

2154
02:56:27,580 --> 02:56:33,940
was news? Oh, I know, not necessarily a Bamani game, but you know Taiko no Tatujin, right?

2155
02:56:33,940 --> 02:56:34,940
You know that game.

2156
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:35,940
Yep.

2157
02:56:35,940 --> 02:56:39,120
Well you know it's coming to the U.S. and it's going to be called Taiko Drum Master

2158
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:41,320
here in the U.S. Close enough name.

2159
02:56:41,320 --> 02:56:47,900
Well guess what? The song list has been announced for Taiko Drum Master and there's some very

2160
02:56:47,900 --> 02:56:53,200
interesting stuff in it. Like to be expected, you have your classical songs. You have your

2161
02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:59,640
Beethoven Symphony No. 5, Carmen, William Tell Overture, Hungarian Dances No. 5. You

2162
02:56:59,640 --> 02:57:05,680
have all that stuff. Then you have Namco originals such as Soul Calibur II's Brave Sword, Braver

2163
02:57:05,680 --> 02:57:14,180
Soul and the Ridge Racer theme, but then we get the licenses, some very interesting licensed

2164
02:57:14,180 --> 02:57:24,180
songs in Taiko Drum Master, My Sharona, Material Girl, Lady Marmalade, the theme from Jimmy

2165
02:57:24,180 --> 02:57:36,860
Neutron and the theme from Dragon Ball Z and then get this toxic and DDR crossovers tub

2166
02:57:36,860 --> 02:57:45,900
thumping you remember that second mix tub thumping and that's the way I like it I wonder

2167
02:57:45,900 --> 02:57:52,700
if they're gonna make the drum any more stable for if you want to see that list it's over

2168
02:57:52,700 --> 02:57:56,420
on our website orangelontrado.com. We did post the whole list. It's the fourth story

2169
02:57:56,420 --> 02:58:02,460
down right now. Very interesting. Donkey Konga's almost out. I think there's only a couple

2170
02:58:02,460 --> 02:58:05,500
more weeks till that's out. And if you go to a GameStop, they have the demo set up so

2171
02:58:05,500 --> 02:58:10,820
you can try it out. It's interesting. You know, I can't personally be too excited about

2172
02:58:10,820 --> 02:58:18,200
Donkey Konga after I played it. Because the clapping thing is aggravating, you know? But

2173
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:22,840
I wonder, I wonder though, do they, have they put out a song list for Donkey Konga yet?

2174
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:28,340
Uh, yes, it's way back in our archives, you'd have to do a search, but there was a song

2175
02:58:28,340 --> 02:58:29,340
list announced.

2176
02:58:29,340 --> 02:58:33,320
I know that the Japanese version had a bunch of J-pop in it, it was actually pretty, you

2177
02:58:33,320 --> 02:58:36,960
know, it had pretty good songs selection.

2178
02:58:36,960 --> 02:58:41,000
I just sort of blanked out over Donkey Konga, but that's, you know, it's really cool that

2179
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:45,600
it's coming out over here, but it's one of the ones I never thought that we'd see.

2180
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:49,600
Alright, I'm going to jam through the last few questions here, then we've got to wrap up the show.

2181
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:54,600
Three more questions, no more questions please. I'm going to get these last few ones.

2182
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:57,600
Dark Knight, a quick question, has anyone visited Virginia before?

2183
02:58:57,600 --> 02:59:01,600
The reason why was because Loki had that Virginia shirt on the webcam.

2184
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:08,600
As I said before in the chat room, but no one was paying attention, my aunt and uncle live in Virginia.

2185
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:14,600
And so, you know, as a staple, everyone has to bring you back the shirt that says what city they visited.

2186
02:59:14,600 --> 02:59:20,200
so, you know, I have this shirt. Basically, you know, if you want to know the logic with

2187
02:59:20,200 --> 02:59:25,760
me wearing this shirt, it was on top of the clean pile. It was the first shirt I saw.

2188
02:59:25,760 --> 02:59:34,120
And that's how it goes. Speaking of traveling, I'm going to be back on the East Coast in

2189
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:38,460
a couple weeks. I'm going to try and go to 8 on the break, because I want to check out

2190
02:59:38,460 --> 02:59:42,680
in the groove, and I hear they have it there. And so I'm going to go to 8 on the break,

2191
02:59:42,680 --> 02:59:47,320
So, for those of you guys that live out there, I don't know if I should clue the stalkers

2192
02:59:47,320 --> 02:59:50,480
into what day I'm going to be there, but I'll let you know a little closer to the day, because

2193
02:59:50,480 --> 02:59:51,480
that's why I'm planning.

2194
02:59:51,480 --> 02:59:52,720
I don't know for sure if I'm going to get to go either.

2195
02:59:52,720 --> 02:59:56,320
I don't want to make promises I can't keep, but I'm going to be about an hour drive from

2196
02:59:56,320 --> 02:59:57,320
there.

2197
02:59:57,320 --> 02:59:59,760
So I'm going to try and go to it on the break, because I want to go check it out.

2198
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:02,380
So we will see.

2199
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:03,380
Question from Black Devil.

2200
03:00:03,380 --> 03:00:07,480
When I call and I want to not hear an echo of the conversation, do I turn down my master

2201
03:00:07,480 --> 03:00:10,000
volume or microphone volume?

2202
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:11,760
Don't turn down your mic volume.

2203
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:16,400
down your speakers, or, well, I shouldn't say your speakers, turn down your Winamp or

2204
03:00:16,400 --> 03:00:20,400
if you're iTunes, turn it off while you call the show. Whatever you're using to listen

2205
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:24,380
to the station, turn it off while you call the show, because that's what causes the echo.

2206
03:00:24,380 --> 03:00:27,700
But don't, yeah, don't turn off your speakers because then you can't hear us through Skype

2207
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:34,160
and then you're talking to nothing. So, yeah. Shut off Winamp or iTunes or whatever you

2208
03:00:34,160 --> 03:00:39,800
use to listen to the show. And lastly, Legend of Zaku, one more question. What are the chances

2209
03:00:39,800 --> 03:00:46,800
that we Americans will get other Bomani besides DDR and karaoke revolution.

2210
03:00:49,360 --> 03:00:54,040
We did get keyboard mania. To some extent, not necessarily on Playstation.

2211
03:00:54,040 --> 03:00:57,880
But we got the Yamaha. Yeah, a little hard to get. A lot of people

2212
03:00:57,880 --> 03:01:02,420
don't even know about it, it's so rare. But we did get it.

2213
03:01:02,420 --> 03:01:07,520
I don't know. I don't want to say never. Never say never. Let's just put it that way, never

2214
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:10,960
say never. You know what I want to see come out in the States is some of the Namco music

2215
03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:15,760
games. Well you get... Namco did, I'm not talking about Taiko no Tatsujin, I'm talking

2216
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:19,880
about like the guitar game that Namco did and the drum one that Namco did. Alright.

2217
03:01:19,880 --> 03:01:23,880
Cause they did a bunch of, they're supposed to be really good music games, just we haven't

2218
03:01:23,880 --> 03:01:30,740
seen them. Alright. It's all on the namco.jp site. Alright, we are going to wrap up the

2219
03:01:30,740 --> 03:01:36,200
show now guys. It is time, we're almost running over here, so please let us get everybody's

2220
03:01:36,200 --> 03:01:40,000
Final thought, and we'll start off tonight's final thought with Angel.

2221
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:41,720
Um...

2222
03:01:41,720 --> 03:01:46,000
Well, no, I wanted to save it for Last Word if you want to let me have it, but, uh...

2223
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,080
Uh...

2224
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:50,340
Buffalo wings.

2225
03:01:50,340 --> 03:01:52,600
Alright, uh, Arcadian.

2226
03:01:52,600 --> 03:01:53,920
Final thought.

2227
03:01:53,920 --> 03:01:55,560
If we can get him a mic.

2228
03:01:55,560 --> 03:02:00,800
Final thought from Arcadian42. Yay, more money soon!

2229
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:07,800
Alright, uh, Jonas, your final thought?

2230
03:02:08,960 --> 03:02:11,000
Tournament Tuesday.

2231
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:12,060
Oh god.

2232
03:02:12,060 --> 03:02:14,240
Uh, Loki!

2233
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:17,600
Loki, your final thought?

2234
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:19,960
I am working on

2235
03:02:19,960 --> 03:02:22,160
next week's winning song.

2236
03:02:22,160 --> 03:02:23,720
Ha ha ha!

2237
03:02:23,720 --> 03:02:26,960
Bond will be the Drudeezy.

2238
03:02:26,960 --> 03:02:28,980
You're just mad because Bond won't put out for you.

2239
03:02:28,980 --> 03:02:35,300
Alright, uh, my final thought is listen to Outside the Box on Wednesday. Listen, or I'll

2240
03:02:35,300 --> 03:02:41,100
come to your house and beat you up. And, shut up. Jamie, your final thought.

2241
03:02:41,100 --> 03:02:48,100
I hate my allergies. Okay. And, uh, for the final word of the show,

2242
03:02:48,100 --> 03:02:49,580
we actually- We should all announce it.

2243
03:02:49,580 --> 03:02:54,180
We actually have a celebrity final word of the show tonight, you guys. So, here is tonight's

2244
03:02:54,180 --> 03:02:57,860
final word of the show, and, uh, thank you very much for listening, everybody. Have a

2245
03:02:57,860 --> 03:03:04,860
a great night. Well, cocky, but I... You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange

2246
03:03:05,220 --> 03:03:12,220
Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura,

2247
03:03:12,340 --> 03:03:19,340
Sky and Loki. If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

2248
03:03:19,340 --> 03:03:26,340
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2249
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:54,540
After listening to a couple albums, well, they all start to sound the same

2250
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:59,040
So he tried to change his musical style

2251
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:02,540
He tossed all his ballads in the circular vial

2252
03:04:02,540 --> 03:04:06,540
Then he found the punk sound breaking ground all around his spell

2253
03:04:06,540 --> 03:04:08,340
Billie told of me

2254
03:04:11,540 --> 03:04:14,140
What's the matter with the tune he's writing?

2255
03:04:14,140 --> 03:04:16,840
Well, you know it's gonna be a smash

2256
03:04:16,840 --> 03:04:23,840
It's so nice when you're a big name, or it just doesn't matter if it sounds like trash.

2257
03:04:23,840 --> 03:04:27,840
Now everybody thinks the new wave is super.

2258
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:30,840
Just ask if there's one that'll even have a scooper.

2259
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:32,840
It's a big hit, isn't it?

2260
03:04:32,840 --> 03:04:37,840
Even if it's a piece of junk, it's still Billy Joel to me.

2261
03:04:37,840 --> 03:04:39,840
Whoa!

2262
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:42,840
It doesn't matter what the greetings say about him.

2263
03:04:42,840 --> 03:04:45,840
He doesn't worry how they feel.

2264
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:52,840
When your records tell a million cents to go in triple plasm, you don't worry about your next meal

2265
03:04:52,840 --> 03:04:55,840
The money is no big deal

2266
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:04,840
Maybe he should dye his hair bright pink and thick and safety pin through his cheeks

2267
03:05:04,840 --> 03:05:11,840
Well then he really missed the new wave image but he couldn't sit down for weeks

2268
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:14,840
Don't you know about the record bills of money?

2269
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:18,840
You gotta be trendy if you wanna make some money

2270
03:05:18,840 --> 03:05:21,840
Everybody's saying that he sure sounds funny

2271
03:05:21,840 --> 03:05:24,840
But if Bill Billy told on me

2272
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:26,840
All right!

2273
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:50,840
Oh, I can hardly wait till his next album

2274
03:05:50,840 --> 03:05:53,840
I bet it's gonna be the rage

2275
03:05:53,840 --> 03:05:59,840
Buy a ticket to his next big console, well, I wonder what he'll do on stage

2276
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:03,840
It might be disco and it might be the blues

2277
03:06:03,840 --> 03:06:06,840
Or maybe something like the B-50 shoes

2278
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:09,840
Just a hand clap, finger snap, demonism

2279
03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:12,840
Mindless half a cell barely jolt on me

2280
03:06:13,840 --> 03:06:16,840
Everybody's saying that he sure sounds funny

2281
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:23,840
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2282
03:06:46,840 --> 03:07:07,120
Hello, there we are.

2283
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:14,080
We are back with the Orange Lawns Radio Afterbirth, the part after the credits have faded to black.

2284
03:07:14,080 --> 03:07:20,520
Right now I'm trying to upload that bukkake clip to our website so I can let you people

2285
03:07:20,520 --> 03:07:21,520
download it.

2286
03:07:21,520 --> 03:07:22,520
Nice pun, Rob.

2287
03:07:22,520 --> 03:07:23,520
I'm sure you'll have tons of fun.

2288
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:24,520
What?

2289
03:07:24,520 --> 03:07:25,520
I said nice pun.

2290
03:07:25,520 --> 03:07:28,520
The ACDC back and forth.

2291
03:07:28,520 --> 03:07:29,520
Oh, whatever.

2292
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:30,520
Yeah.

2293
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:31,520
Okay, I'm not funny.

2294
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:32,520
Fine.

2295
03:07:32,520 --> 03:07:33,520
That's alright.

2296
03:07:33,520 --> 03:07:35,360
You don't get paid to be funny.

2297
03:07:35,360 --> 03:07:36,520
You paid to sit there and look pretty.

2298
03:07:36,520 --> 03:07:38,080
I live with someone who's not that funny.

2299
03:07:38,080 --> 03:07:39,080
No, just kidding.

2300
03:07:39,080 --> 03:07:40,080
I'm not going to go there.

2301
03:07:40,080 --> 03:07:41,080
I think he's starting to rub off on you.

2302
03:07:41,080 --> 03:07:42,080
Be careful.

2303
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:43,080
I hope not.

2304
03:07:43,080 --> 03:07:46,520
Ah, ah, God.

2305
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:50,600
You all at home are very glad you did not hear what Jamie just said, that's for damn sure.

2306
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:55,640
I can repeat it! No! Can you repeat it? Because none of it is true, dammit!

2307
03:07:55,640 --> 03:07:59,760
I don't want to hear about the person she lives with rubbing off on anyone.

2308
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:03,480
Wah, wah, wah.

2309
03:08:03,480 --> 03:08:09,480
That sucks. I wish I still had that drumroll noise.

2310
03:08:09,480 --> 03:08:12,680
Yeah, we do. People should pay us to do this show, you know?

2311
03:08:12,680 --> 03:08:15,680
Yeah, and I'd get less than minimum wage.

2312
03:08:15,680 --> 03:08:17,680
I want to tease the...

2313
03:08:17,680 --> 03:08:19,680
Oh, you want to tease your new remix, Loki?

2314
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:20,680
Yeah.

2315
03:08:20,680 --> 03:08:21,680
All right, tease it.

2316
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:22,680
Wait.

2317
03:08:22,680 --> 03:08:23,680
Hi, puppy!

2318
03:08:23,680 --> 03:08:25,680
Loki wants to tease his newest remix for you all.

2319
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:27,680
Fine. Do it.

2320
03:09:25,680 --> 03:09:40,040
That was more than a tease, that was, you grabbed my balls and fondled them right there.

2321
03:09:40,040 --> 03:09:42,000
That was very interesting.

2322
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,920
Wow, what is, wow, that is pretty cool.

2323
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:46,320
What is that, what's that all about?

2324
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:48,160
Tell us about that one.

2325
03:09:48,160 --> 03:09:49,560
It's just something with radical faith.

2326
03:09:49,560 --> 03:09:54,160
I heard this one remix that someone did and it sucked and I thought, eh, I'll try something

2327
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:55,160
like that.

2328
03:09:55,160 --> 03:09:58,160
I was instantly drawn to the TAC.

2329
03:09:58,160 --> 03:10:02,160
I don't know. Not listening to it through your speakers, I have to change a few things.

2330
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:05,160
But that's just the beginning of it. The end kind of gets weird.

2331
03:10:05,160 --> 03:10:14,160
Let me play a clip here, because I can't really transition into this part yet, but it's kind of cool. Let's see.

2332
03:10:35,160 --> 03:10:45,160
Anyway, it's that stuff. Yeah. Nice. Very nice.

2333
03:10:45,160 --> 03:10:57,160
For those of you guys that wanted that bukkake clip, I'm trying to get it on our site, but

2334
03:10:57,160 --> 03:11:00,280
I'm having problems right now. So sometime this week, just keep checking our forums,

2335
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:04,800
you guys, which we could use some activity on there anyway. I will post that to a forums.

2336
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:07,680
or maybe if you ask unknown gamer really nicely he'll give it to you but here it

2337
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:08,120
is again

2338
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:11,320
two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people

2339
03:11:11,320 --> 03:11:15,360
crashed almost simultaneously today the first crash happened

2340
03:11:15,360 --> 03:11:18,360
in Bukhalki

2341
03:11:18,360 --> 03:11:21,400
I played it 10 times tonight and it's still not old I'm sorry

2342
03:11:21,400 --> 03:11:24,720
it is still funny. Nope, still funny. Alright

2343
03:11:24,720 --> 03:11:28,520
I don't know for some reason I can't get that uploaded right now but

2344
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:33,760
I'll just try it again later

2345
03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:40,760
Alright, uh, so I guess that's gonna do it for the afterbirth, um, for the post-show tonight, you guys.

2346
03:11:40,760 --> 03:11:52,760
Uh, John Fields sent this to me and I actually think it's kinda cool, um, actually it's a video file, uh, of this animation mix, but obviously this is radio, duh, so why would I play a video file on the radio?

2347
03:11:52,760 --> 03:12:08,760
The CD they use is called Deep Dance 50, which is pretty cool because it's all these songs, all these dance songs, but it's only like 45 seconds of each song. It's like all the good parts of every dance song, and then it goes into another song. And it's all mixed together. It's pretty cool. Yes?

2348
03:12:08,760 --> 03:12:14,760
If you want to upload it, there's the URL in the chatroom, I think.

2349
03:12:14,760 --> 03:12:17,760
Aww, FlareOnA was very kind to upload that to you all.

2350
03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:24,760
Yeah, I know it's on GeoShitties, but hopefully enough you guys can get it before GeoShitties locks them out.

2351
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:26,760
So, good luck you guys.

2352
03:12:26,760 --> 03:12:29,760
Alright, enjoy the post-show tonight. Have a great one.

2353
03:12:29,760 --> 03:12:32,760

03:12:32,760 --> 03:12:39,760
We love you, good night.

2355
03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:46,960
I forgot the thing has this whole little intro so you just kind of have to sit through it

2356
03:12:46,960 --> 03:12:53,960
Nice!

2357
03:13:16,960 --> 03:13:18,960
...

2358
03:13:20,960 --> 03:13:23,960
Ahh... A viewer?

2359
03:13:23,960 --> 03:13:24,960
Yes!

2360
03:13:25,960 --> 03:13:28,960
The decision is made!

2361
03:13:31,960 --> 03:13:34,960
You are about to embark on a musical journey.

2362
03:13:34,960 --> 03:13:37,960
A journey made up of beats and basslines.

2363
03:13:37,960 --> 03:13:40,960
Prepare yourselves, for you are about to enter...

2364
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:41,960
...the deep gap!

2365
03:13:41,960 --> 03:13:43,960
You want this, you need this!

2366
03:13:43,960 --> 03:13:45,960
Then what if you are like this?

2367
03:13:45,960 --> 03:13:47,980
You'll follow her here, follow her there

2368
03:13:47,980 --> 03:13:49,980
You'll get in everywhere

2369
03:13:49,980 --> 03:13:51,980
You want this, you need this

2370
03:13:51,980 --> 03:13:53,940
You want it, you have to like this

2371
03:13:53,940 --> 03:13:55,940
You'll follow her here, follow her there

2372
03:13:55,940 --> 03:13:57,940
You'll get in everywhere

2373
03:13:57,940 --> 03:14:01,240
Well remember, capture is such a source of passion

2374
03:14:01,240 --> 03:14:03,660
Keep us fitted everywhere

2375
03:14:03,660 --> 03:14:05,160
Everywhere

2376
03:14:05,160 --> 03:14:06,860
So let your hands and voices

2377
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:08,980
Free your mind and order

2378
03:14:08,980 --> 03:14:11,980
You can fill it in the end

2379
03:14:11,980 --> 03:14:13,760
Oh

2380
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:21,760
It's a passion, oh, you can feel it, yeah, oh

2381
03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:27,760
It's a passion, oh, oh

2382
03:14:27,760 --> 03:14:31,760
Wonderful is every moment, hand it around

2383
03:14:31,760 --> 03:14:35,760
We got to get down, rock it out from this shaky ground

2384
03:14:35,760 --> 03:14:38,760
I'm on it, spread out your heart and party wood everywhere

2385
03:14:38,760 --> 03:14:42,460
They see you people laugh, the people push it out
