00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:11,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:56,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomei!

5
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:36,370
And now for our feature presentation

6
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:09,329
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

7
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:16,913
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.

8
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:25,477
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

9
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:33,441
[SPEAKER_28]: If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell.

10
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:38,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

11
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:46,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

12
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:07,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

13
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:37,149
[SPEAKER_28]: Any time, any place, baby.

14
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:38,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Ow, my foot!

15
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

16
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:52,531
[SPEAKER_21]: We are live and this is episode number 109 for this, August the 29th of 2004.

17
00:05:52,971 --> 00:06:04,216
[SPEAKER_21]: You're tuned in to the B-Money Scenes, most competitive radio station of all things B-Money.

18
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,477
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

19
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:10,319
[SPEAKER_21]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

20
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,980
[SPEAKER_21]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.

21
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,847
[SPEAKER_21]: You know her better as Jamie Summers.

22
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:17,307
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura!

23
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:21,368
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't hear you.

24
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:22,969
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate pollen.

25
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,730
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hate not having air conditioning.

26
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,110
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hate my throat and I hate my nose.

27
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:30,291
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate my sinus passages.

28
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,472
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there anything you like this evening?

29
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Meat.

30
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:34,492
[SPEAKER_13]: This is some damn good meat.

31
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:36,353
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to end things on a positive note.

32
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:37,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Positive?

33
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:38,414
[SPEAKER_13]: How about a high note?

34
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:39,394
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

35
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:39,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

36
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,327
[SPEAKER_13]: I would, except my throat hurts.

37
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:42,668
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did it on a low note.

38
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:45,510
[SPEAKER_20]: Works for me.

39
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,291
[SPEAKER_13]: I could try the high note.

40
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:49,313
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't want to like, you know.

41
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:50,133
[SPEAKER_20]: You're hecka lame.

42
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:52,555
[SPEAKER_13]: That me!

43
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:55,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, I finally saw a basketball.

44
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:56,658
[SPEAKER_19]: What'd you think?

45
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:59,020
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not my how was my week, how was my day yet.

46
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,900
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

47
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:05,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, she's feisty tonight, Miss Jamie Summers is here.

48
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:07,694
[SPEAKER_13]: I just counted she because my flicks is all fucked up.

49
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,115
[SPEAKER_21]: She's here and she's feisty.

50
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:10,295
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, she's Catwoman.

51
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:13,036
[SPEAKER_13]: My nose is full of snot.

52
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:15,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a new nose, Rob.

53
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:16,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Good Kmart.

54
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:21,260
[SPEAKER_21]: Also joining us tonight, the one and only Tech Massa Loki.

55
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,521
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was fixing a webcam and I stepped on something sharp.

56
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:29,458
[SPEAKER_21]: S, The Clumsy Professor, as always.

57
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:30,518
[SPEAKER_17]: It's metal.

58
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:30,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Ow.

59
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,358
[SPEAKER_21]: It's probably a piece of your vortex.

60
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,999
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's a piece of wire.

61
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to DDR Angel.

62
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

63
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,480
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm here again.

64
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,520
[SPEAKER_18]: What, four weeks in a row?

65
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

66
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn, girl, get a life.

67
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:43,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey.

68
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:44,361
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kidding.

69
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:44,821
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

70
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:47,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

71
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:48,322
[SPEAKER_18]: What is this, 109 weeks in a row?

72
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:53,083
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're one to walk, talk, balk, cock.

73
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:53,443
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

74
00:07:57,108 --> 00:08:00,069
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't wait till I get a week off, which I do get pretty soon.

75
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,430
[SPEAKER_21]: About three weeks, I have a week off.

76
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,490
[SPEAKER_13]: A forced week off?

77
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, a forced week off.

78
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,532
[SPEAKER_21]: My doctor says this show's not good for me.

79
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:07,173
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

80
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:08,093
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

81
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Your computer hates me.

82
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:10,414
[SPEAKER_19]: Why's that?

83
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:16,277
[SPEAKER_13]: It just does, but I'll make the supreme effort, but goddammit, while you're out of town, we better have guests.

84
00:08:17,878 --> 00:08:19,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we'll... Or else we'll take a vacation too.

85
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,660
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see what happens.

86
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,622
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure I can... We'll re-record three hours of Loki singing.

87
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:35,760
[SPEAKER_21]: Just whip out, you know what, before I leave, I'll buy Karaoke Revolution 2 and you'll have yourself a whole three hour show right there.

88
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:37,701
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't hear you babe.

89
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:40,343
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that?

90
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,665
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta hold the mic to the bottom sometimes.

91
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:52,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to announce to everybody tonight that I am currently on Dayquil Tylenol Allergy Sinus and now Benadryl.

92
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:55,233
[SPEAKER_22]: In other words, Jamie admits that she's on drugs.

93
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:56,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I am fucked up tonight.

94
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:00,392
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I start saying something really weird, blame the drugs.

95
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:05,918
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm going to have ice cream, so that should sort of negate it, because I'll be in happy chocolate mode.

96
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:07,419
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my Lincoln's ice cream.

97
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, never mind.

98
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:10,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Low-carb ice cream is not ice cream.

99
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:11,663
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's good.

100
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:12,444
[SPEAKER_13]: It's made with cream.

101
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,505
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, we'll see.

102
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:15,287
[SPEAKER_13]: It's better than normal ice cream, because it's good.

103
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,269
[SPEAKER_13]: It has fat in it, and fat makes it good.

104
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:21,318
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back.

105
00:09:21,398 --> 00:09:22,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, there's Bimani stuff too.

106
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,260
[SPEAKER_21]: We do talk about DDR and stuff.

107
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,060
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that Bimani crap?

108
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, what is that stuff?

109
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,282
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I was actually playing Ultramix before the show.

110
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:30,023
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to talk about that when we come back.

111
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:32,144
[SPEAKER_21]: After this little break.

112
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:33,985
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it would be funny.

113
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,707
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I want to address some folks that play on Ultramix, that's why.

114
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:38,488
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to take a break.

115
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:41,429
[SPEAKER_21]: In this break, enjoy the music of Outphase.

116
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,072
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll be back after this break with much randomness for you.

117
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:48,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy.

118
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:36,326
Thank you.

119
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,184
Thanks for watching!

120
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:19,801
Thanks for watching!

121
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,540
Thanks for watching!

122
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:53,688
[SPEAKER_28]: and now let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio

123
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:58,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

124
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we talk about that?

125
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:02,159
[SPEAKER_03]: No subject will ever be taboo.

126
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:06,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

127
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,142
[SPEAKER_21]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

128
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:14,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

129
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:16,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I collect your fucking head.

130
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like this fucker here.

131
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:25,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

132
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,701
[SPEAKER_29]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

133
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:36,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

134
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:41,025
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

135
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:45,292
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back.

136
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:49,053
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio episode 109 is live.

137
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:51,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, in a... Damn it.

138
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:55,034
[SPEAKER_21]: My bad.

139
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:56,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on a minute.

140
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:56,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on.

141
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:57,615
[SPEAKER_21]: I have an announcement.

142
00:16:58,915 --> 00:16:59,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

143
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:04,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, this message was brought to you by Diet Soda.

144
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy at your local grocer.

145
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:08,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

146
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:13,378
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we are live here

147
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,077
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

148
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:39,443
[SPEAKER_21]: and I hope I don't make people go, oh yeah, I forgot, and then they shut off the show and go watch it, but the closing ceremonies at the Olympics are going on right now.

149
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:41,043
[SPEAKER_17]: They're done!

150
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:41,883
[SPEAKER_17]: They're done!

151
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:42,883
[SPEAKER_17]: It sucked!

152
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:44,324
[SPEAKER_17]: It sucked!

153
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:48,905
[SPEAKER_17]: And trust me, if you watch the closing ceremonies, they're like, well, that was cool, maybe I should watch it next year!

154
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,105
[SPEAKER_17]: But the women's handball team won the gold, right?

155
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,246
[SPEAKER_21]: He has glasses.

156
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,906
[SPEAKER_13]: The women's handball team won gold.

157
00:17:55,986 --> 00:18:02,248
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Bjork would have sung... Okay, I need the new Bjork album.

158
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:06,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I am more excited about Bjork than the Olympics.

159
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Bjork makes me all horny.

160
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,136
[SPEAKER_21]: I have new Bjork stuff.

161
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:10,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Give Turat a skull.

162
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:17,503
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually, uh, I was looking and I found photocopies of certain Bjork albums that are out soon.

163
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:27,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hold on, let me, uh... See, this is what you're missing at the Olympics right now.

164
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:36,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a tree that is big!

165
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:38,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Just kidding, I like Bjork, otherwise I wouldn't have the album.

166
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:48,002
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

167
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:54,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, we've actually got people.

168
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,656
[SPEAKER_13]: here who showed up during the break.

169
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:59,617
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we do have people that showed up here during the break.

170
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:03,497
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Arcadian42 showed up with glasses.

171
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,018
[SPEAKER_21]: New glasses.

172
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:07,638
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not new.

173
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:12,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, they look new because you haven't worn them around me in a long time, if ever.

174
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,919
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, well, these are, like, way out of date, actually.

175
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:15,880
[SPEAKER_24]: This is, like, five years.

176
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,480
[SPEAKER_24]: This is, like, a prescription I got, like, five or six years ago.

177
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,861
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm only wearing it because my contacts are, like, weeks old.

178
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,011
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't buy any new ones until I get an eye exam, and I can't afford an eye exam for a while.

179
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:35,493
[SPEAKER_24]: Last time I came here, I just wear them every so often.

180
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:47,578
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm only wearing them for a few hours, but I can't wear them all day, because the contacts I have right now are way too old to wear every day, or I might get an infection in the eye or something.

181
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:49,459
[SPEAKER_24]: So it wouldn't be a good idea.

182
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:53,745
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

183
00:19:55,647 --> 00:20:03,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Also here with us tonight that came during the break was Jonas, also known as Explicit with three X's, because he's triple X rated.

184
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:04,053
[SPEAKER_21]: He's a porn star.

185
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,075
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, everybody.

186
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:09,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that stinking state fair still going on by your work?

187
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:11,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, yeah.

188
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,783
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to come play DDR at your work, but the stinking state fair's gone.

189
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:17,304
[SPEAKER_26]: You can actually play in the weekdays.

190
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:22,368
[SPEAKER_26]: The reason why it was closed on Saturday and Sunday is because that's where the business is racking up.

191
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:24,025
[SPEAKER_26]: Friday's you can actually go.

192
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:26,206
[SPEAKER_26]: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday as well.

193
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:29,548
[SPEAKER_21]: So the parking lot doesn't spill all the way back there on the weekdays?

194
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:29,948
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

195
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:31,249
[SPEAKER_26]: Only Saturday and Sunday.

196
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:33,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe I will go during the week.

197
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,590
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

198
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:33,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

199
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:34,531
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll think about it.

200
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:36,632
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

201
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:37,413
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there anything else?

202
00:20:38,557 --> 00:20:39,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, maybe later.

203
00:20:39,457 --> 00:20:40,478
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll talk to you more a little bit later.

204
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:40,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

205
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, I forgot to talk about competition.

206
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,479
[SPEAKER_21]: We had the Olympics going on, and Bjork's singing.

207
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:45,579
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, no, actually, she sang at the Olympics.

208
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,460
[SPEAKER_21]: She's not singing again.

209
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,340
[SPEAKER_21]: I was kidding about that.

210
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,682
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, we had the Olympics going on, and the Video Music Awards are going on right now.

211
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:52,782
[SPEAKER_21]: In Miami.

212
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:58,384
[SPEAKER_21]: Is going on, and I think a lot of people ditched our show to go listen to that, and, uh, you suck.

213
00:20:58,584 --> 00:20:58,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Why?

214
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:00,044
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, seriously.

215
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:01,805
[SPEAKER_21]: MTV is so done.

216
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:07,627
[SPEAKER_26]: MTV is so done, and overrated, and, ugh.

217
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:11,829
[SPEAKER_21]: Who won?

218
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:13,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we just get a spoiler out there?

219
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,310
[SPEAKER_21]: Who won?

220
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,391
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't we know who won now?

221
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:20,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just get the spoilers out there and who made out with who this year and who punched who in the face.

222
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:21,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just get it all out.

223
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,896
[SPEAKER_21]: That way the guys don't have to watch.

224
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:32,862
[SPEAKER_21]: You can feel free to listen to this show and watch our webcam on www.orangelongeradio.com You can also join our chat room there.

225
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:36,444
[SPEAKER_21]: www.orangelongeradio.com Just that easy.

226
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:47,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we do have some Bomani news I want to talk about tonight, but first, we have to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show by playing a little bit of How was your week?

227
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:48,704
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day?

228
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:50,605
[SPEAKER_21]: And starting us off tonight for How was your week?

229
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,205
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day?

230
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,866
[SPEAKER_21]: The lovely DarkSakura.

231
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,448
[SPEAKER_13]: My week was... Oh.

232
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,131
[SPEAKER_13]: My week was okay until my allergies started to hate me.

233
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,894
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a perfect score in my classes.

234
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:05,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Congrats.

235
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

236
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,347
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm being like a good little nerdlet.

237
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:12,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Benadryl finally kicked in.

238
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:13,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I can breathe.

239
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,294
[SPEAKER_13]: But I haven't yet fallen into a coma, okay?

240
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:26,023
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's just been kind of a druggy week.

241
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,504
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been on the DayQuil all week.

242
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:30,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I had to double up all doses of everything.

243
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:32,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been just so drugged.

244
00:22:33,027 --> 00:22:37,769
[SPEAKER_13]: But my air conditioning isn't working again at my house, so I'm going to have Dan Fusset, the apartment manager, for me.

245
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sniff.

246
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:45,873
[SPEAKER_13]: I finally broke down and bought a box of tissues, so they're going to be my best friend all weekend.

247
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:50,775
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, it hasn't been very interesting.

248
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:53,717
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just been filled with lots of tissue, lots of drugs.

249
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:58,339
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like some kind of celebrity, because I'm popping pills all weekend, you know?

250
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:09,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I should rent a hotel room and throw a wild party and throw the bed sheets out of the window into the pool and all that kind of stuff.

251
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,842
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm hoping to feel better by next weekend so I can participate in much random shooting of things.

252
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:19,863
[SPEAKER_13]: This hasn't been too interesting.

253
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:21,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Very drugged.

254
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:24,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Very, very drugged.

255
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:29,285
[SPEAKER_13]: And Rob snores.

256
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:30,329
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

257
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:31,250
[SPEAKER_13]: See?

258
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,230
[SPEAKER_13]: You weren't even paying attention to me.

259
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,632
[SPEAKER_18]: I was trying to research the VMA so I could spoil it for everyone.

260
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:36,052
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

261
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,834
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes you have to take the radio show by the horns and drive it yourself for a little bit.

262
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I could have said, and Rob suddenly likes pussy.

263
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:49,978
[SPEAKER_13]: And you would go, I wouldn't know.

264
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:53,580
[SPEAKER_21]: There are certain keywords that set off my alarm inside.

265
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Pussy being one of them.

266
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,161
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would have got you.

267
00:23:58,411 --> 00:24:00,372
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's actually, it's just been stuff.

268
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,854
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I didn't even know the Video Music Awards were going on, because I don't watch cable.

269
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:04,454
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't watch TV.

270
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:04,915
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, I know.

271
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:06,356
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't watch crap either, so.

272
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:10,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, especially since the TV is now being taken up.

273
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:11,618
[SPEAKER_21]: Except for Survivor.

274
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:14,760
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm allowed one crap show to like, and that is my crap show.

275
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,100
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

276
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,142
[SPEAKER_13]: You can download Survivor on the Swin Channel on BitTorrent, I found.

277
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:20,183
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I don't need old ones.

278
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:20,784
[SPEAKER_21]: I need new ones.

279
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:21,564
[SPEAKER_13]: No, these are the new ones.

280
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:22,949
[SPEAKER_13]: How can they be the new ones?

281
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:27,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, whenever the new ones are on, there's one that does all the reality shows.

282
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:33,133
[SPEAKER_13]: And on top of that, I'm so happy because they put up the Stargate episode within 15 minutes of it airing.

283
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:37,454
[SPEAKER_21]: That's how I was keeping tabs on The Amazing Race, which most people generally agree is not a crap show.

284
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:38,674
[SPEAKER_13]: The Amazing Race is cool.

285
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:40,635
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the old army guy in it.

286
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:46,177
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't been watching this year, though, because when Sharla and Myrna got kicked off, it just lost interest.

287
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:47,797
[SPEAKER_13]: The army guy is so kick-ass.

288
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:50,338
[SPEAKER_13]: This old guy and his daughter are a team.

289
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:50,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

290
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:55,790
[SPEAKER_13]: And he had fallen, like, in the first part of the race and sliced up his leg.

291
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

292
00:24:56,651 --> 00:24:57,471
[SPEAKER_13]: But he continued.

293
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:58,692
[SPEAKER_13]: They still stayed in the race.

294
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:03,876
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he did the whole, um, what's the thing with the pulley and the line?

295
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,618
[SPEAKER_13]: From the top of the swim building into a swimming pool.

296
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:08,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, chlorine with an open wound.

297
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

298
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:10,621
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy was hardcore.

299
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:11,862
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you watched all the episodes yet?

300
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:13,243
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because I don't have TV.

301
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,624
[SPEAKER_13]: I just caught it over at Iguana Girl's house.

302
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

303
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:16,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, catch up to Current.

304
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:18,267
[SPEAKER_21]: There's some good stuff that happens in the series.

305
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:19,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm busy watching Stargate.

306
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:22,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Watch my pretty scientist man.

307
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:23,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

308
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:25,559
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

309
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-uh.

310
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:26,760
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, then.

311
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, how was your week?

312
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:29,381
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day?

313
00:25:33,424 --> 00:25:36,425
[SPEAKER_17]: I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week because it's too hard.

314
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:40,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, whatever.

315
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:42,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait till you hear what he did today, but I'll let him tell.

316
00:25:45,617 --> 00:25:46,960
[SPEAKER_17]: I am lazy, okay?

317
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,944
[SPEAKER_17]: I am extremely lazy.

318
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:51,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Extremely, extremely lazy.

319
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:53,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me make this clear.

320
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:54,937
[SPEAKER_17]: I am extremely lazy.

321
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:59,392
[SPEAKER_17]: and, you know, before... I have a question.

322
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:01,554
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Loki, are you in fact lazy?

323
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:03,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, extremely lazy.

324
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:10,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, so, before, you know, I had farmed, you know, for, you know, really expensive items for over three weeks.

325
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:12,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Today was just not one of those days.

326
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:15,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I felt like not earning my money at all.

327
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:16,607
[SPEAKER_17]: So I bought it.

328
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:19,049
[SPEAKER_17]: I bought in-game money.

329
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:28,860
[SPEAKER_21]: So in other words, you gave somebody real life money so that they could give you in-game money.

330
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,681
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to make that clear for our listeners.

331
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:32,602
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be correct.

332
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:36,251
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

333
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:40,833
[SPEAKER_17]: They can kiss my ass because I got that money within 15 minutes of paying it.

334
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:41,554
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what?

335
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:45,696
[SPEAKER_17]: That saved me a good 10 hours of gameplay.

336
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:46,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Think about it.

337
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:47,477
[SPEAKER_17]: It's opportunity cost.

338
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:50,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Any economics teacher will teach you.

339
00:26:50,718 --> 00:26:53,980
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to spend the 10 hours or pay the $20.

340
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that's what it is.

341
00:26:57,898 --> 00:27:03,640
[SPEAKER_21]: That's especially amazing considering that it takes about 45 minutes to get a GM sometimes.

342
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,381
[SPEAKER_21]: And Loki got his money in 15 minutes.

343
00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:12,864
[SPEAKER_17]: That was enough time for me to take a power nap and then go back into the game and have my money waiting for me.

344
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:20,807
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, in Ragnarok, all I have to do is play for 15 minutes and I'll get, like, 400,000 zeny.

345
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:23,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's because that money's worth nothing.

346
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:25,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, so your money's not worth anything?

347
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I could go buy a goat headband.

348
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:31,646
[SPEAKER_13]: And it looks cool because I have big goat horns.

349
00:27:33,228 --> 00:27:35,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Which would be very perfect for your portal to hell.

350
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:36,830
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

351
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:38,632
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't touched Ragnarok in a week.

352
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:41,397
[SPEAKER_17]: I have my magnet wire coming.

353
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:48,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, so then I have some other stuff that's coming for my so-called portal to hell.

354
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:50,007
[SPEAKER_17]: I have my magnet wire coming.

355
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:55,454
[SPEAKER_17]: I have an eight and a half pound spool of that shit, so I'll be able to make something with that.

356
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:59,018
[SPEAKER_17]: And what else?

357
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:06,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, I had to go to the doctor about my ingrown toenail that's nasty.

358
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,774
[SPEAKER_17]: But, well, he better fix that shit because you can get blood poisoning.

359
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:12,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, so I...

360
00:28:16,218 --> 00:28:17,339
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

361
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:49,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Angel, how was your week?

362
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:49,575
[SPEAKER_17]: How was your day?

363
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:49,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, okay, um...

364
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:20,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, just schoolwork and other crap, nothing too damn exciting.

365
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:28,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, I played a little DDR, but not too much, which kind of sucks.

366
00:29:28,804 --> 00:29:33,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm watching Rob make a funny face!

367
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:35,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie's making you try her diet food.

368
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:39,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I played a little pop music as well, that's pretty cool.

369
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:42,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, I did nothing except for homework.

370
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:43,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, homework.

371
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:47,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anybody else want to go next?

372
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:48,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm, maybe.

373
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:49,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Arcadian.

374
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:50,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

375
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,601
[SPEAKER_24]: This week was mostly work.

376
00:29:55,423 --> 00:30:02,629
[SPEAKER_24]: And on Friday we finally talked about employing me, and so we just did the pre-work and now I'm not an attempt anymore.

377
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:03,190
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay!

378
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:04,852
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay!

379
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:05,452
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations.

380
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:10,617
[SPEAKER_24]: And so one day will be the first day of not being an attempt, which is good.

381
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,660
[SPEAKER_13]: That is such a good point.

382
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,101
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a bush and a dick in the White House.

383
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:20,421
[SPEAKER_21]: That's an old joke.

384
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:21,822
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't believe you've never heard that before.

385
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:25,883
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway.

386
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,583
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, Arcadian.

387
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:31,364
[SPEAKER_24]: That's okay.

388
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,265
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, she wanted to talk, so I gave it to her.

389
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:42,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

390
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:43,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck MPB!

391
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:54,385
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, I keep getting interrupted.

392
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:55,506
[SPEAKER_21]: Was there anything else?

393
00:30:55,526 --> 00:30:58,288
[SPEAKER_24]: Too bad that Explosion didn't kill seven at the MTV Music Awards.

394
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:00,990
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be nice.

395
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,431
[SPEAKER_24]: Just kill them all.

396
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I have something that somewhat relates to the news, what's going on.

397
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:10,265
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to continue to interrupt Arcadian's little story he's trying to tell.

398
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,006
[SPEAKER_24]: Not going to have much of a story, anyway.

399
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:15,848
[SPEAKER_17]: More than 100,000 protest bush in New York City.

400
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:20,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are some mean, mean feminists there.

401
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:28,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, it's interesting, because did you hear about those planes that were crashing, or the Russian planes that crashed earlier?

402
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:39,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Apparently this is, I'm like the last one to ever hear anything funny that's going on, but apparently Tom Brokaw said on the news, he tried to pronounce one of the Russian city names, but he got it wrong.

403
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,641
[SPEAKER_21]: and he said something else instead.

404
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:42,341
[SPEAKER_21]: And here it is.

405
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:44,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Unknown Gamer, for passing this along to me.

406
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:45,022
[SPEAKER_21]: This is pretty funny.

407
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:50,864
[SPEAKER_23]: Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.

408
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:56,247
[SPEAKER_23]: The first crash happened in Bukhaki.

409
00:31:57,107 --> 00:31:58,247
[SPEAKER_23]: He said Bukhaki.

410
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:01,449
[SPEAKER_29]: He said that in the next intro.

411
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:07,151
[SPEAKER_29]: Tom Brokaw said Bukhaki.

412
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:07,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Next intro.

413
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,532
[SPEAKER_17]: I say that it goes in the next intro.

414
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,521
[SPEAKER_23]: Hold on, one more time, one more time.

415
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:18,564
[SPEAKER_23]: Crash happened in Bukkake.

416
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,449
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a crash that happened and it made Bukkake.

417
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,171
[SPEAKER_29]: Tee hee.

418
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:31,393
[SPEAKER_21]: We're seven years old.

419
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,075
[SPEAKER_29]: Poopy, poopy, Bukkake, Bukkake.

420
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:42,180
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care how old you are, how mature you think you are, that is funny when Tom Brokaw says Bukkake on accident.

421
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:49,224
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure he must not have, when he caught his mistake, if he even knows what the word means, I'm sure when he caught his mistake, he was probably pretty pissed.

422
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,407
[SPEAKER_23]: I have to do it one more time.

423
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:58,550
[SPEAKER_23]: The first crash happened in Bukkake.

424
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:03,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, Arcadian, I'm sorry to keep interrupting.

425
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,073
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your week?

426
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:04,974
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day?

427
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:33,424
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, uh, let's see, NovamaniMoves, uh, this weekend, like, on Friday, uh, I found a praying menace that was, uh, on the ceiling of my bathroom, and he hung out for, like, until today, and then I decided to take him outside, and then, seemed like it was too hot outside, he seemed, I put him in a shady spot, but he seemed to be, like, uh, melting or something, so I put a little bit of water on him and threw him in the bushes, and he disappeared about a week, I mean, about an hour later, so he may have been

428
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,377
[SPEAKER_24]: Birdfood, or may have crawled off to find some bugs.

429
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:38,858
[SPEAKER_24]: Or, who knows.

430
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:40,378
[SPEAKER_24]: The Circle of Life.

431
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,959
[SPEAKER_24]: And the rest of the day was just boring.

432
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:49,221
[SPEAKER_24]: Watched a few episodes of Upright Citizens Brigade that I had on CD.

433
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:49,941
[SPEAKER_21]: That show rocks.

434
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

435
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:54,883
[SPEAKER_24]: And Play on the Computer.

436
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:57,724
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't know what else.

437
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,244
[SPEAKER_24]: That's about everything for me.

438
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:00,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

439
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,706
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll talk about my week and my day, and then we'll get to Jonas.

440
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,388
[SPEAKER_21]: My week and my day was pretty good.

441
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:10,290
[SPEAKER_21]: Didn't do a whole lot during the week, just a lot of work, you know, the usual stuff.

442
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:18,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Then yesterday, I actually met some friends of mine from LiveJournal who live up in Seattle, and they're also on our Final Fantasy XI link shell, so I've known these guys for a long time.

443
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:28,219
[SPEAKER_21]: They go by Wither and Ataluta on our Final Fantasy XI link shell, and they were down here from Seattle on a total whim, where I guess they were going to go to Marine World for one of the birthdays.

444
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,207
[SPEAKER_21]: And so they called me up and was like, hey, let's hang out.

445
00:34:31,227 --> 00:34:31,868
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm like, okay.

446
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:39,492
[SPEAKER_21]: So I went down there and I took them to San Francisco and we all went to the Metreon, which, you know, kind of a famous place in NorCal DDR history.

447
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:43,334
[SPEAKER_21]: It was one of the first two places that really had a lot of DDR and had big tournaments.

448
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:45,455
[SPEAKER_21]: So I took them there so they could, you know, be at the Metreon.

449
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:50,918
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's just other cool stuff there too, like the official Sony PlayStation Store and things like that.

450
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,814
[SPEAKER_21]: and I actually played a game of DDR.

451
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:58,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Adeluda forced me to play a game of DDR up on the third floor where the movie theater is.

452
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,541
[SPEAKER_21]: They have a DDR machine.

453
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:01,203
[SPEAKER_21]: And I played a game.

454
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:02,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh?

455
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:05,589
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Jamie, you and I played on that back when it was a fifth mix, I think.

456
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:06,550
[SPEAKER_21]: But now it's an extreme...

457
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,414
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um, we would have gone to Pier 39.

458
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:12,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, we would have gone to Pier 39 had we had more time.

459
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:23,823
[SPEAKER_21]: I was a little pressed for time yesterday, so I just, I only had time really to take them to the Metreon, because public transit goes right by there, the bar, and to get on, get to Pier 39, we would have had to take a bus.

460
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:26,265
[SPEAKER_21]: It would have taken too long, but next time, I'll make them come back.

461
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,086
[SPEAKER_21]: But we went to the Metreon.

462
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,696
[SPEAKER_21]: and played a game there, and you know what?

463
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:32,917
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR still gets crowds of people.

464
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:45,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, we were playing Cowgirl, which is not that complicated of a song, it's just a fun one, but there were just huge crowds of people that hear the little gallop, you know, because we're trying to get extra stage, right?

465
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:48,423
[SPEAKER_21]: So we were playing that, and it was funny.

466
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:51,484
[SPEAKER_21]: And then he played Doubles, and he got a hell of a crowd doing that.

467
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,164
[SPEAKER_21]: It was pretty funny.

468
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:53,465
[SPEAKER_26]: Cowgirl...

469
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:57,600
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just surprised that DDR still gets big crowds like that.

470
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:03,683
[SPEAKER_21]: But I guess in a city like San Francisco, big touristy spot, maybe people come there, they don't get out that often.

471
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:04,104
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

472
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:04,624
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

473
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:09,387
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, the reason why DDR is still popular is because, one, it's the only game that has exercise involved.

474
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:10,527
[SPEAKER_26]: Really.

475
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:11,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

476
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:12,989
[SPEAKER_26]: That's true.

477
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:20,073
[SPEAKER_21]: But then I went downstairs and I bowed down to the DDR 1.5 mix that they still have there.

478
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,391
[SPEAKER_21]: I miss 1.5 mix a little bit.

479
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I miss 5th mix and I miss 4th mix plus.

480
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:28,096
[SPEAKER_21]: And I miss some 3rd mix Koreans too.

481
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:32,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they're all either extreme or they're extreme these days.

482
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:34,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe you see a max 2 still once in a while.

483
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:37,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe you get a 4th plus if you're lucky.

484
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:39,828
[SPEAKER_18]: But what happened to all the 5th mix?

485
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:43,512
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember when I used to hate 5th mix, but I totally have a respect for it now.

486
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:48,723
[SPEAKER_26]: I always loved Fifth Mix, but there's no place outside anymore.

487
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:51,084
[SPEAKER_21]: When it first came out, I hated it.

488
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:58,087
[SPEAKER_21]: But the reason why I hated Fifth Mix when it first came out was because I was still kind of in that new phase to DDR.

489
00:36:58,687 --> 00:36:59,827
[SPEAKER_21]: I was in that transitional phase.

490
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,588
[SPEAKER_21]: When I first played DDR, USA was all I knew.

491
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,389
[SPEAKER_21]: I played USA, USA, USA.

492
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:07,350
[SPEAKER_21]: And then finally we picked up a fourth mix.

493
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:13,833
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was really just starting to discover a bunch of those older songs, like the old erotic songs and stuff like that, which were really my...

494
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:21,695
[SPEAKER_21]: My Thing That I Love, and then right as I was discovering those, Fifth Mix comes out, and when that came out, what was the first thing that Fifth Mix did?

495
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:25,636
[SPEAKER_21]: It was the first mix to delete songs from older mixes, in mass.

496
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:39,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I'm not talking like onesies, twosies, like Strictly Business, So Many Men, deleting songs like that, but I'm talking Fifth Mix was the first time they cut a whole bunch of songs from second and third mix, and I was pissed, because like all the good erotic songs I like to play were gone, and all the

497
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Cheesy stuff from 3rd Mix, like If You Can Say Goodbye and Flashdance, all that shit was gone.

498
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:49,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to point out that 4th Mix deleted stuff from 3rd Plus.

499
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:53,269
[SPEAKER_21]: They deleted a couple of the Korean songs, right?

500
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:54,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

501
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,571
[SPEAKER_10]: And one other.

502
00:37:58,452 --> 00:38:02,134
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one other I thought that they did that wasn't... But I'm talking about like 30, 40 songs.

503
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,835
[SPEAKER_21]: 5th Mix got rid of like 30, 40 old songs.

504
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:04,456
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I kind of...

505
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:08,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I know.

506
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:10,492
[SPEAKER_21]: But too bad Konami won't put them in.

507
00:38:10,512 --> 00:38:12,712
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, like Moonlight Shadow, or Moving On, or...

508
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:37,831
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like a lot of songs in Fifth Mix are so good.

509
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,914
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the nice thing is a lot of those songs are coming out now in the US.

510
00:38:40,974 --> 00:38:44,718
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like, it's kind of weird because between Extreme and Ultramix 2, we're getting a lot of Fifth Mix songs.

511
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Moonlight Shadow is going to be in Ultramix 2.

512
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, interesting.

513
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:50,204
[SPEAKER_26]: I heard about Ultramix 2 who's making the steps and stuff.

514
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:52,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but, you know.

515
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:55,127
[SPEAKER_21]: Crazy stuff.

516
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,728
[SPEAKER_26]: And I heard this Maximizer song.

517
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:59,408
[SPEAKER_26]: Did you actually hear this song?

518
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:01,589
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I just heard news about this Maximizer.

519
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:02,869
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll talk about all that a little bit.

520
00:39:03,129 --> 00:39:06,311
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll get into the extreme news a little later because there was big extreme news this week.

521
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:08,011
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to ask you guys some stuff about it.

522
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:12,993
[SPEAKER_21]: But first off, where the hell was I?

523
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:13,753
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, the Metreon.

524
00:39:14,373 --> 00:39:19,175
[SPEAKER_21]: So we left the Metreon and then I came back and I went to a Halo party last night.

525
00:39:19,653 --> 00:39:20,314
[SPEAKER_21]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

526
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,220
[SPEAKER_21]: That was pretty much it.

527
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,821
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all that's worth saying about my week and my day.

528
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:51,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Moving on.

529
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:52,462
[SPEAKER_21]: Jonas, how was your week?

530
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:52,902
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day?

531
00:39:53,922 --> 00:39:57,243
[SPEAKER_26]: My day was pretty, actually, this whole week's pretty good so far.

532
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:58,204
[SPEAKER_26]: I got new shoes.

533
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,704
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually can play DDR hella good with them.

534
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:03,145
[SPEAKER_26]: Started to double lay a lot of stuff with it.

535
00:40:04,426 --> 00:40:06,886
[SPEAKER_26]: And heard some news about Tuesday's tournament in Scandia.

536
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:09,047
[SPEAKER_26]: Not sure if you all heard about it.

537
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:12,528
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, you heard about the overnight one or something?

538
00:40:12,548 --> 00:40:13,388
[SPEAKER_18]: They're doing like a lock-in?

539
00:40:13,408 --> 00:40:14,689
[SPEAKER_26]: It's called Back to School Bash.

540
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:14,749
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh.

541
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:17,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Weren't we going to go crash this tournament?

542
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Weren't we talking about going to crash it?

543
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,526
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to go as Dr. Dick.

544
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:29,653
[SPEAKER_17]: I could if my foot was better, and it still hurts, but, you know, after ten days, that's, you know, up there.

545
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:35,755
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so out of shape, I cannot play anything.

546
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:40,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus, man, Jesus.

547
00:40:40,496 --> 00:40:41,256
[SPEAKER_21]: But anyways.

548
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:42,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Blow out everybody's speakers.

549
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,297
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm kind of worried about how the rules are going to turn out.

550
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,257
[SPEAKER_26]: All he says is P.A.

551
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:46,937
[SPEAKER_26]: and freestyle.

552
00:40:47,017 --> 00:40:47,877
[SPEAKER_21]: When is this tournament?

553
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:49,177
[SPEAKER_26]: Tuesday at 7 o'clock.

554
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:50,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Tuesday?

555
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:51,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Tuesday at 7 o'clock P.M.

556
00:40:53,123 --> 00:40:54,384
[SPEAKER_21]: That's during Jamie's show.

557
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:55,784
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

558
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:56,664
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm going to go.

559
00:40:57,745 --> 00:40:58,585
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to go win it.

560
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,686
[SPEAKER_21]: The prize is a trophy.

561
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:03,147
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a trophy?

562
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:07,929
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I'm betting all the good players in Sacramento don't know about it, like Toadie and Moogle Hunter and all that.

563
00:41:08,129 --> 00:41:08,889
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't know about it.

564
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:10,470
[SPEAKER_26]: They actually know about it a little bit.

565
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,270
[SPEAKER_26]: God damn it.

566
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:11,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Who told them?

567
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:12,971
[SPEAKER_26]: Who told them?

568
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,492
[SPEAKER_26]: DDRUK.com.

569
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:14,972
[SPEAKER_26]: Fuck.

570
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:16,512
[SPEAKER_26]: Blame them.

571
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:21,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Why the fuck would DDRUK be talking about a shitty little tournament at Scandia?

572
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:22,575
[SPEAKER_21]: Why?

573
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:25,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Why would anyone want to give that tournament the time of day?

574
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:38,326
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, because people are like... Some of my workers at Paradise Island went to Scandia and stuff, just to see... I'm gonna go and I'm gonna break Toadie and Moogle's legs, and then I'm gonna win it.

575
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:40,407
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm gonna win me a shiny trophy.

576
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:42,448
[SPEAKER_26]: You could also get it for freestyle as well.

577
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:44,509
[SPEAKER_26]: There's like two people, only two people entering.

578
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,190
[SPEAKER_26]: That's right!

579
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,951
[SPEAKER_26]: White people can't dance!

580
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:51,213
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm totally... I'm gonna... Oh, I'm gonna... It's on.

581
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:52,314
[SPEAKER_20]: It is so on.

582
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:52,394
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

583
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:53,814
[SPEAKER_26]: No way, I'm not competing.

584
00:41:54,535 --> 00:41:55,975
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you have a high chance.

585
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:56,795
[SPEAKER_26]: Bring it.

586
00:41:57,175 --> 00:41:57,576
[SPEAKER_26]: Bring it.

587
00:41:58,076 --> 00:41:58,976
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, you want me to compete?

588
00:41:59,036 --> 00:41:59,436
[SPEAKER_26]: Bring it.

589
00:42:00,457 --> 00:42:01,517
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, I'll compete.

590
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,178
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to make something up, and I'm going to beat you up.

591
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,559
[SPEAKER_21]: It's already been brought in.

592
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:11,380
[SPEAKER_26]: You came close on the Marsh Madness.

593
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:14,761
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just because I know how to work a crowd.

594
00:42:15,221 --> 00:42:15,861
[SPEAKER_21]: That's alright.

595
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:20,163
[SPEAKER_26]: Or you can reserve for SPGL on December.

596
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,090
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not talking about these things yet.

597
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:23,831
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

598
00:42:24,031 --> 00:42:25,431
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll discuss that later on.

599
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:34,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we can say now there is a tournament that's going to be at Sunnyvale Golf Line in December, but I'm thinking about doing something special.

600
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:35,054
[SPEAKER_21]: But I don't know yet.

601
00:42:35,154 --> 00:42:37,154
[SPEAKER_26]: It's only DDR4++, I'm assuming.

602
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:39,995
[SPEAKER_26]: They're not using Xtreme's old 4++ for freestyle.

603
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I know.

604
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:42,456
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the reason why I want to do it.

605
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:43,396
[SPEAKER_26]: Same here.

606
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:44,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Xtreme is used.

607
00:42:44,977 --> 00:42:46,097
[SPEAKER_21]: 4++, like retro.

608
00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:47,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Old is new again.

609
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:49,218
[SPEAKER_21]: I love the 90s all over again, right?

610
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:49,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

611
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:53,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey Rob, if you're going to that thing, can I go?

612
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:54,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you need a cheering section.

613
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,675
[SPEAKER_21]: I hella need a cheering section.

614
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:57,596
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure.

615
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:58,897
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure I'll end up going.

616
00:42:59,497 --> 00:43:00,898
[SPEAKER_21]: The question is if I'm going to enter or not.

617
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:04,200
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm thinking about doing my very first actual freestyle.

618
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,061
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the thing.

619
00:43:05,281 --> 00:43:05,741
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know yet.

620
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:06,222
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know yet.

621
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:07,622
[SPEAKER_26]: You got two days, unfortunately.

622
00:43:08,443 --> 00:43:08,643
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no.

623
00:43:08,663 --> 00:43:09,364
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm talking about Spiggle.

624
00:43:09,844 --> 00:43:10,804
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, oh, ooh.

625
00:43:12,005 --> 00:43:13,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, because there you go.

626
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:17,188
[SPEAKER_26]: Make that five months or so, I'm assuming.

627
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:19,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, if Rob goes, then...

628
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:23,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Magus and I will carpool with him, maybe, if he lets us.

629
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:25,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will be his cheering section, because we can.

630
00:43:28,331 --> 00:43:28,692
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

631
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:31,913
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll let you guys know if I end up going to this tournament Tuesday at Scandia.

632
00:43:32,053 --> 00:43:32,574
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll let you guys know.

633
00:43:32,614 --> 00:43:36,576
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll probably be there, since I didn't get any tickets for the WWE Event Arc Arena.

634
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:38,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

635
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:41,699
[SPEAKER_21]: See, there's more competitors that are going to be gone, because they'll go to that.

636
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:42,779
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

637
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:43,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Shit.

638
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,421
[SPEAKER_26]: You got that SmackDown event.

639
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:47,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I got three days to come up with a routine.

640
00:43:47,182 --> 00:43:47,482
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn.

641
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:47,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn.

642
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,354
[SPEAKER_21]: I gotta find my copy of Extreme.

643
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,317
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, let's see what else.

644
00:43:54,738 --> 00:43:58,161
[SPEAKER_26]: It's also on DDRfreak.com since everyone heard about it from DDRUK.

645
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:02,164
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, also I wanted to say fair.

646
00:44:04,045 --> 00:44:06,688
[SPEAKER_26]: It was pretty good, except the prices are too damn expensive.

647
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:11,672
[SPEAKER_26]: 10 bucks for a ticket, 25 bucks for a wristband, or 20 if you get a Coke can.

648
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,413
[SPEAKER_21]: How much for a hot dog on a stick?

649
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,415
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't ask, it's like 8 bucks or so.

650
00:44:15,455 --> 00:44:16,676
[SPEAKER_21]: How much for an egg roll on a stick?

651
00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:18,097
[SPEAKER_21]: And cheesecake on a stick?

652
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,631
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's just say the lowest price for the... And your mom on a stick.

653
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,413
[SPEAKER_26]: That's priceless.

654
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:25,335
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

655
00:44:25,535 --> 00:44:26,575
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, okay, okay.

656
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:31,819
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, most of the stuff there is like not even... The least expensive is like six bucks.

657
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:33,260
[SPEAKER_26]: And those are the funnel cakes.

658
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:37,403
[SPEAKER_26]: The most expensive is like 25, just for regular dinner.

659
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:41,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, 25 bucks for one of those shitty little carts serving you dinner?

660
00:44:42,106 --> 00:44:43,647
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, one of them is that much.

661
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:43,807
[SPEAKER_26]: Jeez.

662
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:47,157
[SPEAKER_26]: Most of them you can see on the other restaurants.

663
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:48,597
[SPEAKER_26]: There's only one that you cannot get.

664
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:50,238
[SPEAKER_26]: It's only exclusive for State Fair.

665
00:44:50,258 --> 00:44:52,119
[SPEAKER_26]: And those are the funnel cakes and the fried Twinkies.

666
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:53,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the fried Twinkies.

667
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,981
[SPEAKER_26]: Unless you know how to make them, then you can make the fried Twinkies yourself.

668
00:44:56,481 --> 00:45:00,382
[SPEAKER_26]: But funnel cakes is exclusive to the State Fair.

669
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:02,063
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah.

670
00:45:04,124 --> 00:45:04,404
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

671
00:45:04,644 --> 00:45:06,725
[SPEAKER_26]: And the fact that parking is expensive as hell.

672
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:09,847
[SPEAKER_26]: Like seven bucks for parking.

673
00:45:09,947 --> 00:45:10,667
[SPEAKER_26]: Used to be like six.

674
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:15,848
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm assuming that there's a DDR arcade section at the State Fair on the kids section.

675
00:45:15,928 --> 00:45:23,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, don't they usually have DDR at the State Fair every year and people go to dance to show off and try to get crowds, the people that love attention and stuff?

676
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:26,691
[SPEAKER_21]: Which I'm certainly not accepted from that.

677
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:30,612
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's on the Eastern Gate, I'm assuming.

678
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,153
[SPEAKER_26]: Because I haven't been there yet.

679
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:34,933
[SPEAKER_26]: Since I'm going there on a Saturday yet again.

680
00:45:36,274 --> 00:45:37,834
[SPEAKER_26]: There goes my wallet.

681
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:40,395
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

682
00:45:41,345 --> 00:45:43,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, did you say you were going on Thursday, Jonas?

683
00:45:44,146 --> 00:45:44,506
[SPEAKER_21]: Saturday.

684
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:46,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn, I'm going on Thursday.

685
00:45:47,006 --> 00:45:49,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody in here knows why I'm going on Thursday.

686
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:50,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I know what's going on Thursday.

687
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:53,268
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a concert Thursday she wants to see.

688
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:55,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

689
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, anything else you want to share about your week and your day, Jonas?

690
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:00,769
[SPEAKER_26]: Not much.

691
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:02,190
[SPEAKER_26]: Just work, school.

692
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,031
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's about it so far.

693
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:08,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair enough.

694
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:12,196
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I opened up the Skype line if anybody has a comment so far.

695
00:46:12,256 --> 00:46:15,717
[SPEAKER_21]: If you don't know anything about the Skype line, it's time to educate yourself.

696
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:22,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Head on over to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on that little tab that says interact with us.

697
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:29,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, when we're in that do not disturb mode with the little red circle with the line through it, it means do not disturb.

698
00:46:29,424 --> 00:46:30,284
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not taking calls.

699
00:46:30,865 --> 00:46:31,645
[SPEAKER_21]: But we are right now.

700
00:46:31,685 --> 00:46:32,826
[SPEAKER_21]: That icon's not on right now.

701
00:46:32,866 --> 00:46:33,606
[SPEAKER_21]: We are taking calls.

702
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:36,628
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go to a break if nobody wants to call.

703
00:46:36,748 --> 00:46:37,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, we're getting a call.

704
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,657
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

705
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:44,600
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope we can hear this person.

706
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,140
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear us?

707
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:47,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can.

708
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:47,802
[SPEAKER_21]: There you are.

709
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:49,683
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, turn up your volume just a little bit more.

710
00:46:50,924 --> 00:46:51,604
[SPEAKER_21]: Who be's this?

711
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:53,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku.

712
00:46:54,626 --> 00:46:57,668
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Legend of Zaku calling in, but he's very, very quiet.

713
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,170
[SPEAKER_21]: If there's any way you can turn up your mic volume, go for it.

714
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

715
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:02,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, alright.

716
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:04,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can.

717
00:47:04,752 --> 00:47:05,173
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

718
00:47:05,193 --> 00:47:05,893
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit better.

719
00:47:06,153 --> 00:47:06,694
[SPEAKER_21]: What's on your mind?

720
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:08,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

721
00:47:09,505 --> 00:47:10,345
[SPEAKER_21]: What's on your mind?

722
00:47:11,326 --> 00:47:13,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, uh, let me see, I just moved.

723
00:47:14,408 --> 00:47:15,188
[SPEAKER_21]: You just moved?

724
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:22,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh... I think, ah, oh, yike!

725
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:23,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm up?

726
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:25,193
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can hear you better now.

727
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:26,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

728
00:47:26,754 --> 00:47:27,835
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

729
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:38,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... You know, I'm trying to prepare, I need help trying to, like... No, I just need help for a freestyle routine, because I have this big tournament in Jacob Javits Center in New York City...

730
00:47:40,646 --> 00:47:42,647
[SPEAKER_21]: He needs help with a freestyle routine.

731
00:47:43,288 --> 00:47:44,789
[SPEAKER_21]: What advice can he give to somebody?

732
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:45,850
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll ask Jonas.

733
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,771
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one suggestion.

734
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't use an orange bat.

735
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:51,074
[SPEAKER_13]: You will lose.

736
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:53,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, don't use an orange bat.

737
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:53,595
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll lose.

738
00:47:53,996 --> 00:48:02,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie and I know this from experience.

739
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:04,823
[SPEAKER_21]: We're losing the connection, Zaku.

740
00:48:05,124 --> 00:48:05,904
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to let you go.

741
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:06,725
[SPEAKER_21]: Tune into the show.

742
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:07,645
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll answer your question.

743
00:48:09,026 --> 00:48:09,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for calling.

744
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:13,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's finish answering Zaku's question.

745
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:14,867
[SPEAKER_21]: How do you prepare for a freestyle?

746
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:16,789
[SPEAKER_21]: Jonas, what do you go through?

747
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:19,392
[SPEAKER_21]: What are the motions you go through when you're preparing for a freestyle routine?

748
00:48:19,572 --> 00:48:22,355
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, the first thing to do is, the best is to put a step chart.

749
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:24,697
[SPEAKER_26]: That's my recommendation.

750
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:30,443
[SPEAKER_26]: A step chart would work because you can tell what moves you want to do, you know, like a documentary.

751
00:48:31,304 --> 00:48:31,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

752
00:48:34,058 --> 00:48:35,678
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm losing you, Jonas.

753
00:48:36,018 --> 00:48:37,279
[SPEAKER_21]: Grab the bottom of the microphone there.

754
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:39,320
[SPEAKER_21]: Push that cord back in a little bit.

755
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,340
[SPEAKER_21]: And try again.

756
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:40,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, bud.

757
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:41,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

758
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:41,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

759
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:42,501
[SPEAKER_26]: Does it work?

760
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:43,021
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

761
00:48:43,562 --> 00:48:43,882
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

762
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:45,222
[SPEAKER_26]: Damn it.

763
00:48:45,362 --> 00:48:46,443
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, okay.

764
00:48:46,783 --> 00:48:50,785
[SPEAKER_26]: The best bet is to print a step chart, like ddrmain.com.

765
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:52,486
[SPEAKER_26]: Look for the song you want.

766
00:48:52,906 --> 00:48:57,988
[SPEAKER_26]: Print out the step chart and use that as a document, which you want to do for the song itself.

767
00:48:58,962 --> 00:48:59,242
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

768
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:04,246
[SPEAKER_26]: Like you can write, ooh, I could do a spin here, or a splits, or wave your hands.

769
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:08,189
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, actually, yeah, he's correcting us in the chat room right now.

770
00:49:08,229 --> 00:49:09,550
[SPEAKER_21]: He doesn't want to know how to set it up.

771
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:10,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, fine.

772
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,992
[SPEAKER_21]: He wants to know what song he should do.

773
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:13,213
[SPEAKER_21]: What song should he do?

774
00:49:13,273 --> 00:49:17,916
[SPEAKER_21]: What songs have not been used to all hell that are freestyable songs, in your opinion, Jonas?

775
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:19,938
[SPEAKER_26]: Depends on what song he wants to do.

776
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:28,284
[SPEAKER_26]: Like if he wants to do, like, hachas or salsa, like, he can go, like, La Bamba, La Copa de la Vida, or...

777
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,781
[SPEAKER_26]: Anything like that.

778
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:34,444
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to see a really good routine to Gamelan Day Couple, personally.

779
00:49:35,085 --> 00:49:37,047
[SPEAKER_26]: That was actually pretty tough, but it's doable.

780
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:46,035
[SPEAKER_26]: If you want to do something like, um, like, oldies, like, sweet style, like, Heaven This Is 57 McTodd Grey would work.

781
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:48,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Alrighty.

782
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:52,481
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, God, for the love of God, no, no knee dropping!

783
00:49:53,963 --> 00:49:54,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

784
00:49:54,443 --> 00:49:55,244
[SPEAKER_26]: I saw it, I'm...

785
00:49:57,114 --> 00:49:58,095
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Raining Men.

786
00:49:58,576 --> 00:49:59,797
[SPEAKER_26]: No comment.

787
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:01,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Heck yeah, it's Raining Men.

788
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:01,558
[SPEAKER_21]: Heck yeah.

789
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:04,661
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just reading the post of Unknown Gamers.

790
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:09,505
[SPEAKER_26]: If you want to go feminist, just go for it.

791
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:15,691
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Raining Men, I Do, I Do, I Do, Cowgirl, any of those B4U songs.

792
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,396
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you want to go old school, just play anything that's from Naoki.

793
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:24,206
[SPEAKER_19]: That works.

794
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:24,967
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

795
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:28,709
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you want to challenge the hell out of yourself, play like those Maxes.

796
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:32,592
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

797
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:34,993
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go ahead and go to a break here.

798
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:43,679
[SPEAKER_21]: And in this break, since we were talking about Fifth Mix, I thought maybe we could, you know, respect Fifth Mix a little bit by playing some songs from it.

799
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:47,121
[SPEAKER_21]: So we will be right back after this, you guys.

800
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:56,527
Thanks for watching!

801
00:51:45,712 --> 00:51:49,474
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

802
00:53:57,279 --> 00:54:03,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, for this last song in the fifth mix break, Jamie wanted to play this one especially for you guys.

803
00:54:03,242 --> 00:54:05,783
[SPEAKER_21]: This is DarkSakura's pick just for you.

804
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:09,144
[SPEAKER_13]: I love you guys so much that I thought that you'd really want to hear this.

805
00:54:09,244 --> 00:54:09,944
[SPEAKER_13]: So, there you go.

806
00:54:53,487 --> 00:55:15,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I did it again I made you believe We're more than just friends Oh baby

807
00:55:32,008 --> 00:55:43,363
I played with your heart, got lost in the game Oh baby, baby, oh, you think I'm in love That I'm sent from above I'm not that innocent

808
00:56:02,575 --> 00:56:20,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a fool in so many ways But you lose all my senses That is just so typically me Oh baby, ooh, oops, I did it again I played with your heart Got lost in this game Oh baby, baby, oops, you think I'm in love Then I'm running from it

809
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:43,573
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

810
00:57:25,805 --> 00:57:33,973
[SPEAKER_27]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry We are back

811
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Excuse me, I'm eating a gummy worm.

812
00:57:40,272 --> 00:57:41,013
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very pleasant.

813
00:57:43,556 --> 00:57:44,938
[SPEAKER_21]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

814
00:57:44,978 --> 00:57:46,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we are back with episode 109.

815
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:52,107
[SPEAKER_21]: We were talking about freestyle a little bit before the break there.

816
00:57:54,518 --> 00:58:01,740
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um... Oh yeah, if you were wondering what the hell happened in the chatroom, if you were in our chatroom, orangehoundsradio.com, click on chat.

817
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,941
[SPEAKER_21]: We had what's called a net split.

818
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:05,461
[SPEAKER_21]: And this happens from time to time.

819
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:09,743
[SPEAKER_21]: IRC, it's a bunch of computers all linked together for the purposes of chatting.

820
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,784
[SPEAKER_21]: And when you connect to our server, you're connecting to one of them.

821
00:58:13,244 --> 00:58:15,905
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, sometimes the communication line breaks.

822
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:18,565
[SPEAKER_21]: And that means half the people go one way and half the people go the other way.

823
00:58:18,905 --> 00:58:21,986
[SPEAKER_21]: So we had a little bit of a net split there, but it looks like it's fixed.

824
00:58:22,386 --> 00:58:23,267
[SPEAKER_21]: We're okay now.

825
00:58:23,467 --> 00:58:23,987
[SPEAKER_21]: So, um...

826
00:58:25,616 --> 00:58:26,997
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't be afraid of our chat room.

827
00:58:27,398 --> 00:58:30,780
[SPEAKER_21]: There's many other reasons to be afraid of our chat room other than the net splits, that's all.

828
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:34,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie picked that one just for you guys, by the way.

829
00:58:34,563 --> 00:58:35,984
[SPEAKER_21]: The Rochelle with the oops, I did it again.

830
00:58:36,825 --> 00:58:37,585
[SPEAKER_13]: People liked it.

831
00:58:37,966 --> 00:58:39,827
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I threw in a little bit of the Bukkake thing, too.

832
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:41,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Tom Brokaw likes Bukkake.

833
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:42,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, he does.

834
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:43,770
[SPEAKER_13]: You heard it here on Orange Challenge Radio.

835
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:46,592
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to run this joke into the ground tonight.

836
00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:48,854
[SPEAKER_21]: I like having jokes so we can run into the ground.

837
00:58:49,054 --> 00:58:51,015
[SPEAKER_23]: Crash happened in Bukkake.

838
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Tom Brokaw's getting old.

839
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:01,901
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been doing news since I was five.

840
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,222
[SPEAKER_21]: He's quitting, finally.

841
00:59:03,722 --> 00:59:04,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, this year, I think.

842
00:59:04,382 --> 00:59:04,982
[SPEAKER_13]: He needs to retire.

843
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:06,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Him and Dan Rather.

844
00:59:07,183 --> 00:59:08,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan Rather's still doing the news.

845
00:59:09,564 --> 00:59:11,084
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Phil Donahue got his clue.

846
00:59:11,164 --> 00:59:11,804
[SPEAKER_13]: He ended his show.

847
00:59:13,365 --> 00:59:13,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Way back.

848
00:59:13,765 --> 00:59:15,565
[SPEAKER_21]: But then he got a new one on another network.

849
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:15,625
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

850
00:59:15,665 --> 00:59:16,366
[SPEAKER_21]: And then it tanked.

851
00:59:16,466 --> 00:59:16,886
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, he did.

852
00:59:16,906 --> 00:59:18,846
[SPEAKER_21]: He was on MSNBC for about three months.

853
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:19,787
[SPEAKER_21]: And then it tanked.

854
00:59:20,107 --> 00:59:21,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they got too used to his talk show.

855
00:59:22,908 --> 00:59:24,348
[SPEAKER_13]: See, once you go, you know...

856
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Public Mass, you know, audience, you can never go back.

857
00:59:28,802 --> 00:59:29,182
[SPEAKER_13]: It's over.

858
00:59:29,842 --> 00:59:31,363
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why Ricky Lake will never act again.

859
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Except in John Waters movies, and that's okay.

860
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:35,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Except in John Waters movies.

861
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:38,587
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a new John Waters movie coming out soon, I'm so excited.

862
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:40,828
[SPEAKER_21]: It's NC-17, so it's back to his roots.

863
00:59:41,688 --> 00:59:42,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Good stuff.

864
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:43,809
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

865
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:49,632
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, I thought we could actually talk about some actual Bomani news that's going on this week.

866
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:51,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Didn't we finish?

867
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:51,733
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your week?

868
00:59:51,753 --> 00:59:52,093
[SPEAKER_21]: How was your day?

869
00:59:52,294 --> 00:59:53,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's right, we did.

870
00:59:53,931 --> 00:59:55,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like drugs, remember?

871
00:59:55,573 --> 00:59:57,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Jamie's on drugs tonight, you guys.

872
00:59:58,075 --> 01:00:02,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Since we about doubled our listeners since the start of the show, why don't you explain to everybody what's going on, Jamie?

873
01:00:02,859 --> 01:00:03,840
[SPEAKER_13]: My nose hates me.

874
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been, like, major allergy attack since, like, Friday.

875
01:00:08,925 --> 01:00:14,269
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm on Dayquil and Tylenol allergy sinus and this Afrin stuff that you shoot up into your nose.

876
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And then this Vic stuff that looks like a dildo.

877
01:00:17,392 --> 01:00:17,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at this.

878
01:00:18,653 --> 01:00:20,455
[SPEAKER_13]: I got this, one of those little...

879
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:25,715
[SPEAKER_13]: It has the Vicks stuff in it so you inhale the fumes when you put Vicks on your nose.

880
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:28,576
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you take the wrapper off of it, it looks like a dildo.

881
01:00:28,616 --> 01:00:31,097
[SPEAKER_13]: I put it up on the cam before, doesn't it?

882
01:00:31,557 --> 01:00:33,578
[SPEAKER_22]: That kind of looks like a tampon.

883
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:35,099
[SPEAKER_13]: It does sort of look like a tampon, too.

884
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:37,000
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I go put that on our webcam?

885
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I did it once.

886
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, put it on the cam again.

887
01:00:41,562 --> 01:00:46,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Join our site at orangeloungeradio.com and you can see the webcam right on the front page.

888
01:00:46,384 --> 01:00:48,805
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go show off this nasty little thing.

889
01:00:50,175 --> 01:01:00,197
[SPEAKER_13]: I got another drug, I got Benadryl now, and they have Dayquil Sinus, so I'm taking that too.

890
01:01:02,677 --> 01:01:07,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't put that, Rob, I had that in my, Rob is sick.

891
01:01:09,338 --> 01:01:10,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob put a tampon in his nose.

892
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew, Rob, you didn't like that?

893
01:01:20,865 --> 01:01:22,706
[SPEAKER_19]: That wasn't really in my nose, Jesus.

894
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:24,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

895
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:28,128
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, I don't know what I like, what I hate more.

896
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:33,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I've been, like, sniffy-drippy all day, and my nose had this burn in it, like I had to sneeze.

897
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:35,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I sneezed the whole way here.

898
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:39,033
[SPEAKER_13]: I nearly ran into some truck that was carrying, like, panes of glass.

899
01:01:39,553 --> 01:01:40,554
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought I was going to die.

900
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:43,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, by the way, Rob, will you put this back on the show for me?

901
01:01:43,175 --> 01:01:43,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my bad.

902
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:43,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

903
01:01:45,616 --> 01:01:49,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I took Benadryl right before I came in, and I've had ice cream.

904
01:01:50,316 --> 01:01:56,361
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm hoping that they counteract each other, but if I fall into a coma halfway through the show, blame the drugs.

905
01:01:57,002 --> 01:01:59,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be just like Ozzy Osbourne, back when he was cool.

906
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,486
[SPEAKER_21]: He's still cool, what are you talking about?

907
01:02:03,647 --> 01:02:04,368
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's funny?

908
01:02:04,508 --> 01:02:15,337
[SPEAKER_13]: In my law book, because I'm taking business law, they brought up that case from the 80s where the kid listened to the Ozzy Osbourne suicide song and shot himself.

909
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah-ha.

910
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:18,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Law is funny.

911
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:37,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

912
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:40,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I'm just going all the way off on tangents.

913
01:02:40,994 --> 01:02:41,574
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all right.

914
01:02:41,614 --> 01:02:42,095
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all right.

915
01:02:42,355 --> 01:02:47,520
[SPEAKER_13]: And Legend of Takuno, the one that I'm referring to was Ozzy Osbourne because I did my homework and read my book.

916
01:02:47,861 --> 01:02:49,382
[SPEAKER_13]: So they talked about an Ozzy Osbourne case.

917
01:02:49,903 --> 01:02:50,884
[SPEAKER_13]: About the song that's...

918
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:58,654
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, uh, no, I read the goddamn book, don't argue with me, okay?

919
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:03,178
[SPEAKER_13]: You are not taking my business law class, I am taking the business law class.

920
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:06,540
[SPEAKER_13]: They referred to, Ozzy Osbourne's first name is John, okay?

921
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:13,926
[SPEAKER_13]: It had him by his name in my goddamn book, and it was freaking, okay, do not argue with me because I am always right, okay?

922
01:03:15,607 --> 01:03:18,950
[SPEAKER_13]: It was an Osbourne case where it was a song about how easy it is to kill yourself.

923
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,452
[SPEAKER_13]: About you can slowly drink yourself to death.

924
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:48,282
[SPEAKER_13]: and then it was and the guy killed himself and his parents were trying to blame Ozzy Osbourne for killing himself for killing the kid but they actually it got turned over because it was had they ruled in the parents favor it would have been a violation of the constitutional right for freedom of speech by the way speaking of freedom of speech

925
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:50,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

926
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:50,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

927
01:03:50,944 --> 01:03:51,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

928
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:31,086
[SPEAKER_13]: The federal government basically, well, the Ninth Court of Appeals basically turned over that the person-to-person share programs like BitTorrent, BearShare, LimeWire, those like that, are legal.

929
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:40,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, they shot down the plans that they were wanting to do in the copyright laws because it would...

930
01:04:41,418 --> 01:04:49,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I think some of the commercial law under the constitution and I think it's pretty neat.

931
01:04:50,204 --> 01:05:01,112
[SPEAKER_13]: And the ironic thing is that the 9th Court of Appeals though also was the one that did the Napster case back in the day.

932
01:05:02,313 --> 01:05:08,377
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I was peeking through the news and I saw that and that was really cool.

933
01:05:09,418 --> 01:05:09,618
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

934
01:05:11,403 --> 01:05:11,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

935
01:05:12,163 --> 01:05:12,964
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

936
01:05:12,984 --> 01:05:13,424
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's alright.

937
01:05:13,964 --> 01:05:15,165
[SPEAKER_10]: That affects all of us.

938
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:16,866
[SPEAKER_13]: That affects the show.

939
01:05:16,886 --> 01:05:17,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you all pirate.

940
01:05:18,467 --> 01:05:24,870
[SPEAKER_13]: They're also saying that, you know, like what we did through Life 365, perfectly fine.

941
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:25,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

942
01:05:25,711 --> 01:05:28,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, what we did through Life 365 was always legal.

943
01:05:28,752 --> 01:05:29,513
[SPEAKER_21]: So, anyway.

944
01:05:29,533 --> 01:05:29,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

945
01:05:30,137 --> 01:05:34,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, I want to get into some Bomani news, some actual Bomani news that's going on in the Bomani world this week.

946
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:42,946
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the biggest stories actually broke on Monday, so it's almost old news to a lot of you guys right now, but I kind of want to talk about some of the repercussions behind this.

947
01:05:43,927 --> 01:05:47,549
[SPEAKER_21]: For those of you that may not have heard, get out from under your rock, and here's what's going on.

948
01:05:47,669 --> 01:05:53,713
[SPEAKER_21]: GamePro.com ran this article on Monday that talked about the upcoming DDR Extreme that we're all getting in the US.

949
01:05:54,134 --> 01:05:56,615
[SPEAKER_21]: And in this article, it included some screenshots.

950
01:05:57,256 --> 01:05:57,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Well...

951
01:05:58,385 --> 01:06:09,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Whoopsie daisy, somebody let them have a copy of the already unlocked version of the game and because they showed off the screenshots, they blew about 18 of the unlocks.

952
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:20,859
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know for, well, I guess I shouldn't say this, I know this for a fact, but I know that one of them was kind of one of the ones that I think Konami kind of wanted to keep a surprise.

953
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:24,401
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was You're Not Here by Heather from Silent Hill 3.

954
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:28,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Konami kind of wanted that to be a surprise when the game actually comes out.

955
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:28,810
[SPEAKER_21]: Whoops!

956
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:29,831
[SPEAKER_21]: Cover got blown on that one.

957
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:46,336
[SPEAKER_21]: As well as the cover got blown on 321 Stars, A, Absolute, B4U, the B4ZA beatmix, Trip Machine, Trip Machine Survivor, Sugaru, V, and of course you're not here, and the article went ahead and said, oh by the way, Maximizer's in the game.

958
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:48,317
[SPEAKER_21]: What did I say?

959
01:06:48,678 --> 01:06:49,578
[SPEAKER_17]: What did I say?

960
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:50,779
[SPEAKER_17]: What did I say?

961
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:52,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-huh, I think so.

962
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Now you should listen to me, you fucking idiots.

963
01:06:56,282 --> 01:06:59,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, for those that just started listening to the show, what exactly do you mean by that?

964
01:07:00,244 --> 01:07:03,346
[SPEAKER_17]: I only called Maximizer, like, what, how many months ago?

965
01:07:04,426 --> 01:07:05,326
[SPEAKER_17]: How many months ago?

966
01:07:05,506 --> 01:07:07,227
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like at least three or four months ago?

967
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:08,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably even before that?

968
01:07:09,268 --> 01:07:21,552
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was when DDR Extreme came out for the Japanese console system, so whatever the fuck that was, probably... I don't know, but I called it a long-ass time ago, and everyone said, No!

969
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:24,953
[SPEAKER_17]: That's so wrong because Max Period's the last one!

970
01:07:25,093 --> 01:07:25,733
[SPEAKER_17]: But, ha!

971
01:07:25,953 --> 01:07:26,613
[SPEAKER_17]: I was right!

972
01:07:27,534 --> 01:07:28,234
[SPEAKER_17]: I was right!

973
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,015
[SPEAKER_17]: I like being right.

974
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:37,065
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, message from the chatroom, UnknownGamer says, tell Loki to shut the fuck up, he's a dork.

975
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:40,228
[SPEAKER_21]: WE BAN YOU!

976
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:49,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, um, I'll play You're Not Here for those guys who haven't heard it, because this is an Akira Yamaoka song, it rocks, from Silent Hill 3, I will play that in this next break, but...

977
01:07:50,314 --> 01:07:51,334
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you guys think about this?

978
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:54,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I forgot to say Sugaru Apple Mix, my bad.

979
01:07:54,476 --> 01:07:54,896
[SPEAKER_21]: Who cares?

980
01:07:55,036 --> 01:07:55,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

981
01:07:55,896 --> 01:08:02,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, but then the screenshots also revealed that some of the Oni songs now have basic Trip Maniac steps, but some don't.

982
01:08:02,759 --> 01:08:03,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Like the Wild Rush?

983
01:08:03,859 --> 01:08:04,119
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't.

984
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:07,260
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think, I want to say it was Sugaru?

985
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:07,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Does.

986
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:09,741
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up with that?

987
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:11,882
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the Apple Mix does.

988
01:08:12,763 --> 01:08:13,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think it was the Apple Mix.

989
01:08:13,983 --> 01:08:16,584
[SPEAKER_21]: I know one of them I was looking at had basic Maniac

990
01:08:18,431 --> 01:08:21,894
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was like, okay, so they went and did them for some, but not for others.

991
01:08:23,335 --> 01:08:35,505
[SPEAKER_17]: It might even be for you, the Before the Beat mix, and I know Hysteria2001, they have basic trick and maniac steps thanks to, what was it, the Dancing Stage games.

992
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:39,228
[SPEAKER_17]: So, it's very possible those might be your mixed steps.

993
01:08:40,812 --> 01:08:41,333
[SPEAKER_21]: This is true.

994
01:08:41,593 --> 01:08:45,376
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody told me that the Love at First Sight, you know how the maniac steps were in?

995
01:08:46,097 --> 01:08:49,300
[SPEAKER_21]: There were maniac steps in Dancing Stage, but they were really easy.

996
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,080
[SPEAKER_21]: It was like a four-footer.

997
01:08:50,801 --> 01:08:55,165
[SPEAKER_21]: That is the exact same steps as Max 2 USA's trick steps.

998
01:08:56,426 --> 01:08:57,507
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody told me that a while back.

999
01:08:57,547 --> 01:09:00,970
[SPEAKER_21]: I never went back to verify that, but it sounds legit.

1000
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:02,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1001
01:09:02,231 --> 01:09:02,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

1002
01:09:06,124 --> 01:09:09,205
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't know, any reaction to this?

1003
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:18,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I was kind of, with all the clue giving, you know how those folks that work at Konami, they like to give clues, and we had Sigurd here a couple weeks ago, and he was kind of telling us why they don't go to the extreme threat anymore.

1004
01:09:18,648 --> 01:09:25,009
[SPEAKER_21]: But nonetheless, they give out clues, they work hard to keep this stuff a secret, and then, kaboom, it's all spoiled.

1005
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:26,950
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you guys think about that?

1006
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:32,451
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's hilarious, trusting GamePro with anything, because that magazine sucks.

1007
01:09:33,472 --> 01:09:33,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me too.

1008
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:36,580
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't even provide free demos.

1009
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,561
[SPEAKER_17]: What the hell is that?

1010
01:09:38,563 --> 01:09:39,103
[SPEAKER_17]: God damn it.

1011
01:09:39,283 --> 01:09:45,711
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to stay competitive at this day and age, you need to provide free demo discs so that people can steal them out of your magazines.

1012
01:09:50,154 --> 01:09:54,277
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have a comment, you can call in on our Skype line if you have something you want to say.

1013
01:09:55,998 --> 01:09:59,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I'm being told that the challenge songs do not have new steps.

1014
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,661
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, let me see where I got that from.

1015
01:10:04,043 --> 01:10:06,024
[SPEAKER_21]: It was somewhere in that preview story.

1016
01:10:06,104 --> 01:10:07,545
[SPEAKER_21]: It talks about the screenshots.

1017
01:10:07,565 --> 01:10:08,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see if I can find it.

1018
01:10:09,907 --> 01:10:15,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Where one of them had... I'm going to the site, and I'm going to post the link in the chat room if I can find them.

1019
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:16,211
[SPEAKER_21]: There they are.

1020
01:10:17,324 --> 01:10:19,085
[SPEAKER_21]: Sugru Apple Mix, light, standard, heavy.

1021
01:10:19,705 --> 01:10:20,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, right there.

1022
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,988
[SPEAKER_21]: And they say the screenshot is off-center.

1023
01:10:24,248 --> 01:10:27,870
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, so maybe somebody was scrolling around or something was going on there.

1024
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:29,451
[SPEAKER_21]: So maybe that's what happened there.

1025
01:10:30,411 --> 01:10:30,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Not sure.

1026
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:32,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1027
01:10:33,553 --> 01:10:39,836
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, looking at it that way, it does look like the song's a little bit off, so maybe the steps hadn't updated yet.

1028
01:10:39,896 --> 01:10:40,376
[SPEAKER_21]: Who knows?

1029
01:10:41,197 --> 01:10:46,720
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, well, nevertheless, it's adding fuel to the fire that there are hidden steps.

1030
01:10:47,398 --> 01:10:49,100
[SPEAKER_21]: And Ultramix 2, there we go.

1031
01:11:04,998 --> 01:11:07,220
[SPEAKER_21]: GamePro kind of blowing the lid on this stuff.

1032
01:11:08,381 --> 01:11:11,104
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you think it could affect them getting demos from Konami in the future?

1033
01:11:11,124 --> 01:11:14,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Or do you think Konami's just kind of like, eh, we were done with the extreme people anyway.

1034
01:11:15,007 --> 01:11:15,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Forget it.

1035
01:11:16,728 --> 01:11:17,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Let the list be spoiled.

1036
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:18,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Or what do you guys think?

1037
01:11:24,355 --> 01:11:25,536
[SPEAKER_13]: It was bound to happen anyway.

1038
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:27,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you know that always happens.

1039
01:11:28,219 --> 01:11:31,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone's going to leak a list or something is going to happen that's going to just totally throw off the plan.

1040
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:45,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, honestly, I really think that before you print any screen captures or anything, you should run it by, you know, the people who are giving you the authority to do the article.

1041
01:11:45,424 --> 01:11:45,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1042
01:11:45,664 --> 01:11:49,065
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's very true.

1043
01:11:49,285 --> 01:11:49,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Very true.

1044
01:11:50,966 --> 01:11:52,026
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go to the Skype line.

1045
01:11:52,287 --> 01:11:54,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Zaku's trying to call back, so let's see if we can hear him now.

1046
01:11:54,987 --> 01:11:55,688
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up, Zaku?

1047
01:11:56,968 --> 01:11:58,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing... Hold on.

1048
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:58,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing that...

1049
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:03,377
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm hearing Starmine is going to be up for Ultramix 2, is that true?

1050
01:12:03,397 --> 01:12:05,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any other Beatmania 2DX songs confirmed?

1051
01:12:05,057 --> 01:12:05,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

1052
01:12:05,218 --> 01:12:05,418
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean...

1053
01:12:22,113 --> 01:12:33,262
[SPEAKER_21]: some other beat manias actually we're going to talk about Ultramix 2 in a little bit but those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head but there are brand new ones that are in Ultramix 2 it's pretty cool okay anything else?

1054
01:12:34,623 --> 01:12:50,876
[SPEAKER_02]: let me see I'm trying to think right on the light was another one thank you Jason alright alright well if you think of it if you think of it call us back later dude

1055
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:52,719
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, bye.

1056
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,160
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yes, Ultramix 2.

1057
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,841
[SPEAKER_21]: A nice little segue in Ultramix 2 because we did get some new songs announced for Ultramix 2 this week.

1058
01:13:01,641 --> 01:13:02,822
[SPEAKER_21]: We had two songs announced.

1059
01:13:02,942 --> 01:13:10,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Paul Oakenfold doing an Elvis remix of Rubberneckin', which was a fairly popular hit a couple months ago, earlier this year.

1060
01:13:10,623 --> 01:13:12,044
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's kind of neat to see that in DDR.

1061
01:13:12,244 --> 01:13:13,984
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have a Beatmania song.

1062
01:13:14,024 --> 01:13:18,045
[SPEAKER_21]: From Beatmania the final, we have an Athletics song that was confirmed.

1063
01:13:18,405 --> 01:13:21,070
[SPEAKER_21]: and the song is Hit and Slap and I'm going to play that for you guys right now.

1064
01:13:21,111 --> 01:13:22,253
[SPEAKER_21]: It's only like a little over a minute.

1065
01:13:22,593 --> 01:13:27,784
[SPEAKER_21]: So here it is, something you'll be dancing to in Ultra Mix 2 this fall, Athletics with Hit and Slap.

1066
01:13:53,032 --> 01:13:53,874
Thank you for watching!

1067
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:23,919
B-Track, HudaWa, Muscatra, Control Your Messalance, WayUnaida

1068
01:14:47,523 --> 01:14:51,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Athletics with Hit and Slap, a new song announced for Ultramix 2 this week.

1069
01:14:51,628 --> 01:14:56,975
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind of some mixed reaction there in our chatroom that, boy, it's rap, and usually you don't hear a lot of that in DDR.

1070
01:14:57,296 --> 01:15:01,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I remember when Sigurd was here, he said that Ultramix 2 was kind of...

1071
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:02,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Echo Image with Skulk

1072
01:15:37,561 --> 01:15:42,588
[SPEAKER_21]: and of course a song we were lucky enough to be able to announce on air, Zonk with Tittle Tattle.

1073
01:16:04,617 --> 01:16:08,682
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a little weird, but I kind of like it.

1074
01:16:08,723 --> 01:16:10,144
[SPEAKER_21]: It's got a different little sound to it.

1075
01:16:10,164 --> 01:16:12,888
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it could be fun for DDR with the right steps.

1076
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:20,258
[SPEAKER_21]: And they have promised us, the folks that made Ultramix 2, that the steps this time, different people making them, going to be different stuff.

1077
01:16:20,931 --> 01:16:21,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Going to be good stuff.

1078
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:23,113
[SPEAKER_21]: So we will soon see.

1079
01:16:23,213 --> 01:16:26,235
[SPEAKER_21]: This November is when they rumored that that game would be out.

1080
01:16:26,335 --> 01:16:27,095
[SPEAKER_21]: So we will see.

1081
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:30,558
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's see.

1082
01:16:30,618 --> 01:16:33,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Should we go to a break and play the other songs we said we'd play?

1083
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,781
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, why not?

1084
01:16:35,233 --> 01:16:42,338
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to play in this break Akira Yamaoka with You're Not Here, which is going to be a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme USA.

1085
01:16:42,358 --> 01:16:43,319
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to play that for you guys.

1086
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:49,143
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we're going to play Paul Oakenfold with Elvis and Rubberneckin, because that's going to be in DDR Ultra Mix 2.

1087
01:16:49,183 --> 01:16:50,744
[SPEAKER_21]: So you get a little bit of both mixes.

1088
01:16:51,224 --> 01:16:57,668
[SPEAKER_21]: And actually, I encourage you all to go vote in the poll on our website right now, because we're kind of taking a little poll over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1089
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:58,869
[SPEAKER_21]: Look in the upper right-hand corner.

1090
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:01,011
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm kind of curious, which...

1091
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:04,628
[SPEAKER_21]: One of these two mixes, are you planning on buying this fall?

1092
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:05,548
[SPEAKER_21]: Or are you going to buy them both?

1093
01:17:05,568 --> 01:17:06,848
[SPEAKER_21]: Or are you going to buy neither one?

1094
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,369
[SPEAKER_21]: Go to OrangeLawnsRadio.com and look up in the upper right-hand corner.

1095
01:17:10,449 --> 01:17:15,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now, 41% plan to buy DDR Extreme.

1096
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,371
[SPEAKER_21]: 41% also plan to buy both mixes.

1097
01:17:17,751 --> 01:17:18,392
[SPEAKER_21]: That's pretty good.

1098
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:22,653
[SPEAKER_21]: And only 6% plan to buy Ultra Mix 2 only.

1099
01:17:23,113 --> 01:17:26,434
[SPEAKER_21]: So it sounds like most people that get Ultra Mix 2 are buying Extreme as well.

1100
01:17:26,554 --> 01:17:27,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind of interesting.

1101
01:17:27,674 --> 01:17:29,735
[SPEAKER_21]: But go vote in our poll.

1102
01:17:30,155 --> 01:17:30,935
[SPEAKER_21]: OrangeLawnsRadio.com

1103
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:32,524
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, here we go.

1104
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:37,306
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go to this break, and we'll start off with Kiri Yamoka from DDR Extreme USA.

1105
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:38,647
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not here.

1106
01:17:38,707 --> 01:17:42,788
[SPEAKER_21]: These, by the way, are full versions, so they're about three minutes in length, not the DDR edits.

1107
01:17:42,848 --> 01:17:43,268
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be back.

1108
01:17:44,969 --> 01:17:46,049
We'll be back.

1109
01:18:10,151 --> 01:18:22,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue sky to forever, green grass blows in the wind It would be a much better sight with you, with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

1110
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,871
So now what should I do?

1111
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:53,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches now that you're gone My sublime fell through You let me give me everything you had and more You craved my happiness when you made me feel torn

1112
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,712
and many more.

1113
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:43,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

1114
01:19:43,887 --> 01:19:44,588
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

1115
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:19,695
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, as promised, from Ultramix 2, Elvis Presley vs. Paul Oakenfold, Rubberneckin'.

1116
01:21:51,764 --> 01:22:02,589
That's all right with me Look and listen, baby My philosophy Call up and back and baby That's all right with me They don't really know Like what I see See why all I count

1117
01:22:46,844 --> 01:22:47,385
Thank you.

1118
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:53,882
Thank you for watching.

1119
01:24:16,058 --> 01:24:17,098
Thank you for watching!

1120
01:24:49,358 --> 01:24:54,227
[SPEAKER_05]: From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

1121
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:57,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!

1122
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1123
01:25:06,145 --> 01:25:08,848
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly a different style of music there in Ultramix 2.

1124
01:25:09,288 --> 01:25:10,449
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's pretty cool, though.

1125
01:25:10,469 --> 01:25:11,710
[SPEAKER_21]: I like the direction they're going in.

1126
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:15,433
[SPEAKER_21]: I think a lot of people are kind of getting sick of all the... Now, not me, personally.

1127
01:25:15,453 --> 01:25:25,842
[SPEAKER_21]: I love the trance music and the Japanese mixes and stuff, but I think some people... I think there was a call out there for some different stuff, and Ultramix 2 is certainly stepping up and answering that call, so I think it's pretty cool.

1128
01:25:26,122 --> 01:25:29,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, I have to say that I was getting kind of tired of the trance myself, but

1129
01:25:29,793 --> 01:25:30,794
[SPEAKER_21]: How could you get tired of trance?

1130
01:25:31,094 --> 01:25:33,315
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's not to say Ultramix 2 won't have its share of trance.

1131
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:34,216
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it does have some trance.

1132
01:25:34,276 --> 01:25:36,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just getting tired of the happy stuff.

1133
01:25:37,197 --> 01:25:40,679
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like, love, love, sugar, cavity.

1134
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,640
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that type of stuff.

1135
01:25:43,341 --> 01:25:44,101
[SPEAKER_13]: And speed mixes.

1136
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:46,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the occasional speed mix, but, like, too many of them.

1137
01:25:49,424 --> 01:25:52,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, Rice Princess is calling into the station, wants to say something.

1138
01:25:52,586 --> 01:25:52,966
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up?

1139
01:25:55,128 --> 01:25:55,688
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you there?

1140
01:25:58,732 --> 01:26:00,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, if you can hear us, we can't hear you.

1141
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Double check your mic and call us back.

1142
01:26:06,393 --> 01:26:06,653
[SPEAKER_30]: Bummer.

1143
01:26:08,134 --> 01:26:18,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, also as a reminder, when you call us, when our little red circle is on, we're probably not going to see your call because when we're in Do Not Disturb mode, that means we're doing other pieces of show.

1144
01:26:18,936 --> 01:26:20,196
[SPEAKER_10]: It means we're doing naughty things.

1145
01:26:20,636 --> 01:26:23,476
[SPEAKER_21]: Irene lucked out and I happened to be glancing over when she was calling in there.

1146
01:26:24,216 --> 01:26:25,597
[SPEAKER_21]: But it didn't work, that's alright.

1147
01:26:26,497 --> 01:26:27,397
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get back to her later.

1148
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:35,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Meanwhile, I actually wanted to mention this before the show tonight, and I actually kind of want to make doing this a regular thing.

1149
01:26:35,538 --> 01:26:37,898
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember how I talked about starting up the Ultramix League?

1150
01:26:39,698 --> 01:26:44,099
[SPEAKER_21]: I was actually online on DDR Ultramix before tonight's show, and it was actually kind of fun.

1151
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:48,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, there are still people, believe it or not, that are playing Ultramix.

1152
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,220
[SPEAKER_21]: It's amazing.

1153
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:55,802
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was on there playing, and that was the first time you'd ever really seen that in action, huh, DDR Angel?

1154
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:56,302
[SPEAKER_21]: You saw that.

1155
01:26:56,382 --> 01:26:57,442
[SPEAKER_21]: What'd you think of that, Angel?

1156
01:26:58,002 --> 01:26:59,062
[SPEAKER_21]: The Ultramix stuff.

1157
01:26:59,883 --> 01:27:03,844
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I put the voices through the TV for a little bit, too, although you can barely hear it, but what did you think of that?

1158
01:27:04,204 --> 01:27:05,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was really cool.

1159
01:27:06,005 --> 01:27:07,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of want one now, see?

1160
01:27:07,525 --> 01:27:12,687
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, I said that last week, so it looks like I need to save up my paychecks and just go for it.

1161
01:27:12,947 --> 01:27:15,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Just get everything in a big, fat bundle.

1162
01:27:17,909 --> 01:27:24,851
[SPEAKER_11]: If I need to save up until Ultramix 2 comes out, I'll do that, and I'll just buy 1 and 2, the system, just everything, and play.

1163
01:27:25,686 --> 01:27:27,667
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have a DDR buddy now.

1164
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:34,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1165
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:45,015
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, what I noticed about Ultramix that I thought was kind of funny is that there's people on there that love to sing along to the songs with their Xbox headsets on so that you can hear.

1166
01:27:45,115 --> 01:27:52,378
[SPEAKER_21]: And like, I was playing Count Stop Falling in Love and I heard this girl going, Kids of our love, kids of our love.

1167
01:27:53,829 --> 01:27:55,411
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1168
01:28:10,071 --> 01:28:11,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, blame me It's all my fault I blame you

1169
01:28:43,604 --> 01:28:46,347
[SPEAKER_13]: I invoke female privilege to just offer my opinion.

1170
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:51,713
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm laying down like this so that one side of my nose will drain into the other and I won't be all stuffed up.

1171
01:28:53,655 --> 01:28:53,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

1172
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:54,876
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not on camera.

1173
01:28:55,036 --> 01:28:55,457
[SPEAKER_13]: My feet are.

1174
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:58,740
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1175
01:29:01,018 --> 01:29:02,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the webcam, see my feet!

1176
01:29:02,698 --> 01:29:04,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you played DDRXbox at all?

1177
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:08,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I haven't even unwrapped the shrink wrapping off of it.

1178
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:09,560
[SPEAKER_21]: You should, sometime.

1179
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:15,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I was gonna go download the songpacks, but I got school, I do stuff now.

1180
01:29:16,322 --> 01:29:20,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I only played for like 30 minutes before the show, it wasn't that much.

1181
01:29:20,983 --> 01:29:27,405
[SPEAKER_21]: I would actually sign on to Xbox Live and play live on the show, but I don't know how well the voices would come out.

1182
01:29:28,373 --> 01:29:30,014
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, should we try logging on right now?

1183
01:29:30,094 --> 01:29:30,814
[SPEAKER_21]: See if anybody's on?

1184
01:29:31,434 --> 01:29:32,514
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds like a good time waster.

1185
01:29:35,155 --> 01:29:36,656
[SPEAKER_21]: No, Matt doesn't want to try it.

1186
01:29:36,736 --> 01:29:37,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Fine.

1187
01:29:39,897 --> 01:29:41,237
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it could be an interesting piece.

1188
01:29:42,018 --> 01:29:43,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's wait and do it when we know it'll work.

1189
01:29:44,738 --> 01:29:46,239
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure it'll work, it's just...

1190
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:48,338
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think it makes for great radio.

1191
01:29:48,358 --> 01:29:51,440
[SPEAKER_21]: The only problem with it is that the music drowns out the people talking.

1192
01:29:51,840 --> 01:30:01,806
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it would be hilarious if we could go on there and mess with people live on air, but unfortunately the music of the songs, they totally drown out the voices if you're running it through the TV, so I don't think it's going to work.

1193
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:05,308
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh well.

1194
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:10,931
[SPEAKER_13]: This poster is disturbing and frightening.

1195
01:30:11,952 --> 01:30:12,272
[SPEAKER_13]: What one?

1196
01:30:12,292 --> 01:30:15,694
[SPEAKER_13]: One for Rojin Z, which I've always wanted to see that and never have.

1197
01:30:17,665 --> 01:30:19,305
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a really creepy thing.

1198
01:30:19,325 --> 01:30:20,506
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a creepy old man.

1199
01:30:21,186 --> 01:30:25,227
[SPEAKER_21]: So anyway, my call to those of you that play on Xbox Live, please stop singing.

1200
01:30:26,507 --> 01:30:29,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Or wait until Karaoke Revolution Xbox comes out.

1201
01:30:30,068 --> 01:30:31,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I am so getting that.

1202
01:30:32,809 --> 01:30:34,989
[SPEAKER_21]: See, now the chat room is saying do it.

1203
01:30:35,649 --> 01:30:37,010
[SPEAKER_21]: They want us to try it and do it.

1204
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:40,510
[SPEAKER_21]: I should have kept my mouth shut.

1205
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:41,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe after the cage match.

1206
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:44,251
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to give Loki time to set it up if we're going to do it.

1207
01:30:44,631 --> 01:30:46,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we're going to do the cage match first though.

1208
01:30:50,255 --> 01:30:53,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, we will do... Hold on, I'm trying to find Holic.

1209
01:30:54,277 --> 01:30:55,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I vote for Holic.

1210
01:30:55,457 --> 01:30:59,639
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to set up our wires if we're going to get on DDR Ultramix, so... Hey, Rob.

1211
01:30:59,679 --> 01:30:59,879
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1212
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:04,941
[SPEAKER_13]: If I, like, bring Holic and then, like, add, like, an extra beat to the end, does that count as a remix so I can use Holic?

1213
01:31:05,261 --> 01:31:05,521
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1214
01:31:06,121 --> 01:31:06,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn.

1215
01:31:08,662 --> 01:31:09,003
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1216
01:31:09,963 --> 01:31:10,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, let's see.

1217
01:31:10,603 --> 01:31:13,664
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go on to the cage match.

1218
01:31:13,704 --> 01:31:15,125
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got to get the song skewed up, though.

1219
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:19,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Before we get to the cage match, let's plug our spin-off shows.

1220
01:31:19,533 --> 01:31:22,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Monday night, Diversion, 7 o'clock, Bomani Remixes.

1221
01:31:23,116 --> 01:31:23,656
[SPEAKER_21]: It rocks.

1222
01:31:23,777 --> 01:31:24,978
[SPEAKER_21]: Listen to it or you suck.

1223
01:31:25,158 --> 01:31:25,718
[SPEAKER_21]: Tuesday night.

1224
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:27,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Pump Up the Volume?

1225
01:31:29,662 --> 01:31:35,587
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to start at 7 for a pre-show, but I usually get really bored and start things around a quarter till, sometimes 6.30.

1226
01:31:35,627 --> 01:31:40,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, that's a specific time for all of our other time zone people.

1227
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:41,493
[SPEAKER_13]: 7.30 starts the real show.

1228
01:31:43,502 --> 01:31:47,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I now have to get up for work at 5.30 in the morning the next day.

1229
01:31:48,126 --> 01:31:51,008
[SPEAKER_13]: I have been cutting it off right at 10.30, 11 o'clock.

1230
01:31:51,969 --> 01:32:00,075
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if I don't have to do anything the next day, or, you know, if I don't foresee the need for sleep, I'll just keep going, because I'll be like, oh, wait, I'm still running the show, huh?

1231
01:32:00,856 --> 01:32:05,980
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to be a request show, but it's really been more or less me just marathoning types of music.

1232
01:32:06,421 --> 01:32:08,662
[SPEAKER_13]: The past few weeks I've been playing whole albums.

1233
01:32:09,523 --> 01:32:12,946
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, this past Tuesday I played the Silent Hill 4 US soundtrack.

1234
01:32:14,244 --> 01:32:14,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Maren-chan

1235
01:32:42,847 --> 01:32:43,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1236
01:33:10,049 --> 01:33:12,350
[SPEAKER_21]: So, definitely tune in for that.

1237
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:14,812
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, do you want to do Xbox Live before or after Cage Match?

1238
01:33:15,592 --> 01:33:16,172
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do it after.

1239
01:33:16,192 --> 01:33:16,393
[SPEAKER_21]: After.

1240
01:33:16,413 --> 01:33:17,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I said we were going to do after.

1241
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:19,674
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get some folks some time to sign on there too.

1242
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:21,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Although, we don't want to play against people we know.

1243
01:33:22,016 --> 01:33:24,637
[SPEAKER_21]: We want to play against random people so we can mess with them.

1244
01:33:24,697 --> 01:33:26,778
[SPEAKER_21]: So don't log on just trying to find us.

1245
01:33:26,818 --> 01:33:29,920
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a good thing my name on Xbox Live isn't Orange Lounge Radio or something.

1246
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,881
[SPEAKER_21]: So people won't know which one's me.

1247
01:33:31,901 --> 01:33:32,421
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's good.

1248
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:33,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Isn't it going to be awesome?

1249
01:33:33,962 --> 01:33:34,182
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1250
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:38,665
[SPEAKER_17]: If, uh, like, they make microphones and shit for, um...

1251
01:33:39,707 --> 01:33:48,472
[SPEAKER_17]: The Xbox, you know, karaoke game, and we can plug it in where, like, you know, the normal, um, you know, headset thing would go.

1252
01:33:49,213 --> 01:33:53,315
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I might be able to wire something where our output can go into there.

1253
01:33:53,656 --> 01:33:56,818
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, while they're playing, you know, that'd be fun.

1254
01:33:57,818 --> 01:34:07,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, I think you can use just a normal, um, micro, the small jack ones on your, uh, controller.

1255
01:34:07,164 --> 01:34:07,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1256
01:34:08,004 --> 01:34:08,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1257
01:34:08,744 --> 01:34:12,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because I broke my headset one time for PSO.

1258
01:34:13,286 --> 01:34:13,846
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1259
01:34:13,866 --> 01:34:16,127
[SPEAKER_13]: And we just went, there was one that got like a radio shack.

1260
01:34:16,727 --> 01:34:17,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe we can do something.

1261
01:34:17,567 --> 01:34:17,808
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1262
01:34:18,108 --> 01:34:21,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, anyway, let's get to the gauge match so we can do the Xbox Live thing.

1263
01:34:24,088 --> 01:34:28,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, the way the cage match works, we have some new people listening tonight, so let me explain this.

1264
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,350
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to play three songs for you guys.

1265
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:32,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Each host brings one song to the table.

1266
01:34:32,791 --> 01:34:39,914
[SPEAKER_21]: You pick your favorite of the three songs by placing a private vote in our chat room, www.orangelondradio.com.

1267
01:34:39,934 --> 01:34:42,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Click on chat and our kind regulars there will tell you how to place a vote.

1268
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:47,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, you can't vote until all three songs have been played, so wait for me to tell you to vote before you vote.

1269
01:34:49,693 --> 01:34:50,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Three songs.

1270
01:34:50,933 --> 01:34:55,515
[SPEAKER_21]: You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because, you know, it's the winner and you heard it last week.

1271
01:34:55,535 --> 01:34:56,356
[SPEAKER_21]: So you only get to hear a clip.

1272
01:34:56,696 --> 01:35:07,061
[SPEAKER_21]: And last week's winner in this case was... Loki with two-time champion Nuon, which is by, supposedly it's by Outphase.

1273
01:35:07,121 --> 01:35:07,801
[SPEAKER_10]: By Phase Out.

1274
01:35:08,221 --> 01:35:12,363
[SPEAKER_21]: But we know that the MP3 had to have been mislabeled, so we're calling it Phase Out.

1275
01:35:12,955 --> 01:35:17,859
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Phase Out is our two-week-in-a-row winner, and here it is, a clip of last week's winner.

1276
01:35:17,899 --> 01:35:20,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number one you can vote for tonight, Phase Out with Nuon.

1277
01:36:17,665 --> 01:36:18,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1278
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:57,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

1279
01:37:57,881 --> 01:37:59,862
[SPEAKER_21]: That was Outphase with Nuon.

1280
01:37:59,902 --> 01:38:03,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number two comes from... That's not Outphase, actually.

1281
01:38:03,104 --> 01:38:03,664
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Phase Out.

1282
01:38:03,684 --> 01:38:06,186
[SPEAKER_21]: We're calling it... Song number two comes to us from Jamie.

1283
01:38:07,907 --> 01:38:09,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, Jamie, you want me to introduce your song, then?

1284
01:38:10,869 --> 01:38:12,870
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie has brought to the table Bond.

1285
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:16,452
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, those four chicks with the violins that play classical music.

1286
01:38:17,112 --> 01:38:18,453
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's called Shine.

1287
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,314
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the dub Chakra mix.

1288
01:38:20,354 --> 01:38:23,136
[SPEAKER_21]: And the reason why she picked this one is, well, she likes...

1289
01:38:24,502 --> 01:38:26,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but it has samples from Afronova.

1290
01:38:27,844 --> 01:38:29,444
[SPEAKER_21]: It has samples from Afronova in it.

1291
01:38:29,905 --> 01:38:33,586
[SPEAKER_21]: And for those that said she picked this song already, she's saying it's a different mix.

1292
01:38:33,726 --> 01:38:34,407
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it is.

1293
01:38:35,527 --> 01:38:36,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you picked a different one.

1294
01:38:36,428 --> 01:38:36,708
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1295
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:41,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it has Bond and samples of Afronova, so see if you like it.

1296
01:38:41,810 --> 01:38:46,953
[SPEAKER_21]: Although it's not really samples of Afronova, it's just the fact... Yeah, they're public domain samples that Afronova also used.

1297
01:38:46,973 --> 01:38:52,936
[SPEAKER_13]: The one that I used before was... It started off with a really...

1298
01:38:54,232 --> 01:38:55,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll play it on Tuesday.

1299
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:56,794
[SPEAKER_13]: I picked a different song before.

1300
01:38:57,294 --> 01:38:57,554
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1301
01:38:57,894 --> 01:38:58,235
[SPEAKER_19]: It's fine.

1302
01:38:58,595 --> 01:38:58,875
[SPEAKER_19]: Here it is.

1303
01:38:58,915 --> 01:39:02,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I played this one on the show before to play the samples.

1304
01:39:02,457 --> 01:39:02,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1305
01:39:02,697 --> 01:39:03,378
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember that.

1306
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:03,898
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember that.

1307
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:04,238
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1308
01:39:04,699 --> 01:39:05,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

1309
01:39:05,219 --> 01:39:09,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Bond with Shine, the Dub Chakra mix with that same sample in Afronova.

1310
01:39:09,562 --> 01:39:09,782
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1311
01:39:09,802 --> 01:39:10,022
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we go.

1312
01:39:25,275 --> 01:39:26,078
Thanks for watching!

1313
01:43:15,806 --> 01:43:19,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, that was song number two.

1314
01:43:20,909 --> 01:43:24,650
[SPEAKER_21]: Tonight's cage match, that was Bond with Shine, the Dub Chakra mix.

1315
01:43:27,752 --> 01:43:28,712
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you guys think of that one?

1316
01:43:30,233 --> 01:43:33,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I really like that song, it's just really laid back, I listen to it all the time.

1317
01:43:35,996 --> 01:43:38,097
[SPEAKER_13]: It gets a 9 from me, I mean I've listened to it a whole bunch.

1318
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:44,725
[SPEAKER_13]: but I intended to use it for cage match once and never did so I just figured I may as well do it now.

1319
01:43:44,745 --> 01:43:45,846
[SPEAKER_13]: I played it on my show a few times.

1320
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:49,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I just really think it's different.

1321
01:43:49,469 --> 01:43:50,190
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really different.

1322
01:43:53,713 --> 01:43:54,994
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, moving on.

1323
01:43:55,634 --> 01:43:55,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Jonas.

1324
01:43:56,975 --> 01:43:57,896
[SPEAKER_26]: I give it a 9 out of 10.

1325
01:43:57,936 --> 01:43:59,057
[SPEAKER_26]: It's pretty good, soothing.

1326
01:43:59,197 --> 01:44:00,759
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't have that Afronuva part I heard.

1327
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:07,064
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than that, it's very well done with the violin and all that stuff.

1328
01:44:09,293 --> 01:44:09,553
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1329
01:44:10,734 --> 01:44:11,614
[SPEAKER_19]: A scale of 110?

1330
01:44:12,814 --> 01:44:13,054
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, no.

1331
01:44:13,094 --> 01:44:13,394
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

1332
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:13,934
[SPEAKER_19]: I missed the knife.

1333
01:44:14,075 --> 01:44:15,475
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1334
01:44:15,575 --> 01:44:15,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel?

1335
01:44:17,636 --> 01:44:17,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn it.

1336
01:44:18,016 --> 01:44:18,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1337
01:44:18,316 --> 01:44:18,876
[SPEAKER_11]: The mic's working.

1338
01:44:18,916 --> 01:44:19,336
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

1339
01:44:19,376 --> 01:44:22,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard myself.

1340
01:44:22,197 --> 01:44:22,177
9.5.

1341
01:44:22,857 --> 01:44:23,197
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cool.

1342
01:44:23,457 --> 01:44:23,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.

1343
01:44:24,298 --> 01:44:24,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Bond.

1344
01:44:25,738 --> 01:44:26,598
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like a given.

1345
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:27,999
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1346
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:28,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki?

1347
01:44:32,805 --> 01:44:34,125
[SPEAKER_17]: It's okay.

1348
01:44:34,225 --> 01:44:40,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, the samples of whatever, Afronova, the tribal people do not fit in the song at all.

1349
01:44:41,488 --> 01:44:44,709
[SPEAKER_17]: But, whatever, you know, it's Bond.

1350
01:44:45,969 --> 01:44:47,730
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to give it a lower score because it's Bond.

1351
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Because Bond doesn't do any original shit.

1352
01:44:50,711 --> 01:44:52,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, so they're going to get a 7.

1353
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:57,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, because I just, you know, I've heard that song and I'm just tired of them.

1354
01:44:58,013 --> 01:44:59,273
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they can stop anytime.

1355
01:45:01,434 --> 01:45:01,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, Bradley.

1356
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:03,302
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought it was really cool.

1357
01:45:03,342 --> 01:45:04,043
[SPEAKER_24]: What was the beat?

1358
01:45:04,503 --> 01:45:04,984
[SPEAKER_24]: Give it a 9.

1359
01:45:06,365 --> 01:45:07,746
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually like that song a lot.

1360
01:45:07,786 --> 01:45:08,427
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a song.

1361
01:45:08,647 --> 01:45:11,510
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just not sure I'm down with it for like a cage match.

1362
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:12,331
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

1363
01:45:12,991 --> 01:45:15,013
[SPEAKER_21]: It's bouncy, dancey as the others.

1364
01:45:15,734 --> 01:45:17,075
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it would be very freestyle-able.

1365
01:45:17,095 --> 01:45:17,996
[SPEAKER_13]: We were talking about that.

1366
01:45:18,637 --> 01:45:19,077
[SPEAKER_21]: I give it an 8.

1367
01:45:19,978 --> 01:45:21,079
[SPEAKER_21]: As a song, I give it a 9.

1368
01:45:21,159 --> 01:45:22,160
[SPEAKER_21]: As a cage match pick, I give it an 8.

1369
01:45:22,801 --> 01:45:23,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1370
01:45:24,262 --> 01:45:24,723
[SPEAKER_21]: My turn.

1371
01:45:25,343 --> 01:45:32,105
[SPEAKER_21]: and I've picked a song by a band that's actually already in rotation on our station because they were on one of the Fantasia albums.

1372
01:45:32,465 --> 01:45:33,906
[SPEAKER_21]: They're a really popular trance band.

1373
01:45:33,926 --> 01:45:36,066
[SPEAKER_21]: They're on Robbins Entertainment here in the U.S.

1374
01:45:36,146 --> 01:45:41,808
[SPEAKER_21]: Same label as Ian Vandal and Paul Oaken... No, he's not on that label.

1375
01:45:42,148 --> 01:45:45,809
[SPEAKER_21]: Ian Vandal and DJ Sammy is another big one on that label.

1376
01:45:46,429 --> 01:45:48,430
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm kind of surprised they haven't ended up in DDR yet.

1377
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:52,371
[SPEAKER_21]: The band is Lasko and this is their brand new single that just came out.

1378
01:45:52,856 --> 01:45:54,178
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called Surrender.

1379
01:45:54,599 --> 01:45:55,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Just came out in the U.S.

1380
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:56,441
[SPEAKER_21]: this week, actually.

1381
01:45:56,461 --> 01:45:58,264
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been out in Britain a little while, but just came out in the U.S.

1382
01:45:58,284 --> 01:45:58,564
[SPEAKER_21]: this week.

1383
01:45:58,965 --> 01:46:01,088
[SPEAKER_21]: It's my pick, Lasko with Surrender.

1384
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:01,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy.

1385
01:46:36,815 --> 01:46:42,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I said I can't trust you, I don't know Every time I'm near you, I lose control I must be out of my mind to let you in

1386
01:47:58,677 --> 01:48:00,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1387
01:49:14,997 --> 01:49:17,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1388
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:19,661
[SPEAKER_21]: That was Lasko with Surrender.

1389
01:49:19,781 --> 01:49:20,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see what everybody thought of that.

1390
01:49:21,042 --> 01:49:21,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie.

1391
01:49:22,903 --> 01:49:26,486
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to say the same thing that I say every week.

1392
01:49:27,687 --> 01:49:28,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Trance is old.

1393
01:49:29,609 --> 01:49:30,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Trance is very boring.

1394
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:36,154
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to be in the mood for it and too much is too much of anything.

1395
01:49:36,214 --> 01:49:37,315
[SPEAKER_13]: However, that was still good.

1396
01:49:37,615 --> 01:49:38,296
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the song.

1397
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:43,560
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm just so burned out on Trance right now that I can't

1398
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:47,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually heard this song before in one of the Dream Dance volumes, I think.

1399
01:49:48,002 --> 01:49:48,402
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it an 8.5.

1400
01:49:48,482 --> 01:49:49,363
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some repeated samples.

1401
01:50:11,727 --> 01:50:17,588
[SPEAKER_26]: It kind of sounded a little repetitive, but the singing was pretty good, and it still sounds pretty good.

1402
01:50:18,128 --> 01:50:18,468
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1403
01:50:19,088 --> 01:50:19,368
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel.

1404
01:50:20,068 --> 01:50:21,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's see.

1405
01:50:21,249 --> 01:50:24,809
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I'm a Lascaux fangirl, so you know it's going to get a 10 from me.

1406
01:50:25,889 --> 01:50:26,950
[SPEAKER_21]: At least I got one supporter.

1407
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:27,270
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1408
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:28,350
[SPEAKER_21]: 10 from Angel.

1409
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:28,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki.

1410
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:32,010
[SPEAKER_21]: It gets a 10 because it's not Bond.

1411
01:50:34,531 --> 01:50:34,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Ouch.

1412
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:36,611
[SPEAKER_20]: And a glare.

1413
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:38,111
[SPEAKER_20]: I see a glare coming from Jamie.

1414
01:50:39,472 --> 01:50:39,812
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1415
01:50:39,832 --> 01:50:40,472
[SPEAKER_20]: Arcadian.

1416
01:50:40,512 --> 01:50:40,972
[SPEAKER_20]: Arcadian.

1417
01:50:42,026 --> 01:50:42,766
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1418
01:50:42,786 --> 01:50:46,368
[SPEAKER_24]: To me, it's like the quintessential trance pop song.

1419
01:50:46,388 --> 01:50:49,969
[SPEAKER_24]: Like if somebody were to say, Rob, play me some trance pop, I'd play that.

1420
01:50:50,009 --> 01:50:50,289
[SPEAKER_24]: I like it.

1421
01:50:50,309 --> 01:50:50,550
[SPEAKER_24]: It's cute.

1422
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:52,310
[SPEAKER_24]: I give it a 9.

1423
01:51:02,446 --> 01:51:02,746
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1424
01:51:04,147 --> 01:51:04,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here it is.

1425
01:51:04,707 --> 01:51:06,907
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1426
01:51:08,168 --> 01:51:13,069
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see if Nuon goes three weeks in a row, or if we get Bond or Lasko as the new champ tonight.

1427
01:51:13,129 --> 01:51:13,649
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

1428
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's a recap.

1429
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:17,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number one, Phase Out with Nuon.

1430
01:51:19,611 --> 01:51:20,532
[SPEAKER_21]: I always pick that clip.

1431
01:51:20,552 --> 01:51:20,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it.

1432
01:51:29,008 --> 01:51:33,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Song number two tonight is Bond with Shine, the dub Chakra Mix.

1433
01:51:47,837 --> 01:51:51,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And song number three tonight is Lasko with Surrender.

1434
01:52:04,856 --> 01:52:08,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright guys, place vote now.

1435
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:15,382
[SPEAKER_21]: You may place your vote in the chat room by sending a private message to Sky in the chat room with your votes.

1436
01:52:15,743 --> 01:52:16,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1437
01:52:18,364 --> 01:52:21,006
[SPEAKER_21]: As promised, we're going to try this horrible...

1438
01:52:21,804 --> 01:52:22,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Experiment Out.

1439
01:52:22,725 --> 01:52:30,392
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think this is going to go over very well, but the chatroom asked we do it, so we're going to get on to Xbox Live and harass people randomly on Ultramix, alright?

1440
01:52:31,133 --> 01:52:33,575
[SPEAKER_21]: So, let's see, I have to get suited up here, though.

1441
01:52:34,156 --> 01:52:35,357
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me head over to get suited up.

1442
01:52:35,877 --> 01:52:36,638
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me get the mic over.

1443
01:52:37,419 --> 01:52:41,223
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so you'll have to say bye to the chatroom for a minute, Jamie, because we're going to switch it over.

1444
01:52:41,823 --> 01:52:42,684
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have to get suited up.

1445
01:52:42,724 --> 01:52:43,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on.

1446
01:52:43,545 --> 01:52:44,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody talk while I get suited up.

1447
01:52:51,102 --> 01:52:53,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, he's putting on the headset.

1448
01:52:57,066 --> 01:52:58,367
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I remember that thing.

1449
01:52:59,428 --> 01:53:03,852
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember having an indention in the side of my head from playing Phantasy Star Online for six hours.

1450
01:53:05,133 --> 01:53:06,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kind of glad I quit.

1451
01:53:07,775 --> 01:53:08,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Rob...

1452
01:53:24,255 --> 01:53:27,938
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, wait, are we going to switch the cam over to Xbox, right?

1453
01:53:28,638 --> 01:53:31,400
[SPEAKER_19]: Eh, it'll be fine.

1454
01:53:31,741 --> 01:53:33,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold on, we're going to switch the cam over to Xbox real fast.

1455
01:53:39,206 --> 01:53:41,268
[SPEAKER_21]: My headset broke, we have a catastrophe.

1456
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:45,611
[SPEAKER_30]: There, put it over here.

1457
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:01,522
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm getting suited up, sorry guys, I broke my headset.

1458
01:54:07,466 --> 01:54:13,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright guys, first things first, I have to make sure that both my mics are working.

1459
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:16,293
[SPEAKER_21]: Then I have to set it up so that we can hear the voices through the TV, which hopefully we will.

1460
01:54:19,025 --> 01:54:25,248
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just changed the settings so that the voices will come through the TV so hopefully you guys can hear the folks that chat with me on Xbox Live.

1461
01:54:25,548 --> 01:54:29,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, chat listeners, don't join the game just because we're in it.

1462
01:54:29,751 --> 01:54:30,511
[SPEAKER_21]: I know who you are.

1463
01:54:31,511 --> 01:54:32,632
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to set up a match.

1464
01:54:33,973 --> 01:54:37,454
[SPEAKER_21]: And let's do a light song because I'm going to pretend to be somebody that doesn't know how to play DDR.

1465
01:54:37,735 --> 01:54:39,796
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I'm going to regulate the game, okay?

1466
01:54:40,416 --> 01:54:40,916
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's see.

1467
01:54:42,697 --> 01:54:44,758
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's do... You want to do DXY?

1468
01:54:45,999 --> 01:54:46,439
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1469
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:48,020
[SPEAKER_20]: They want DXY.

1470
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:50,272
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the old DXY banner.

1471
01:54:50,992 --> 01:54:51,593
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

1472
01:54:52,233 --> 01:54:53,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so we're going to do a match on DXY.

1473
01:54:53,394 --> 01:54:54,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, let's see if anybody joins.

1474
01:54:54,575 --> 01:54:55,876
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to do three public slots.

1475
01:54:55,896 --> 01:54:56,677
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see if anybody joins.

1476
01:54:56,697 --> 01:54:58,158
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to mute my mic for now.

1477
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:02,462
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so I'm waiting for people to join the match.

1478
01:55:02,502 --> 01:55:03,543
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll see what happens here.

1479
01:55:05,364 --> 01:55:07,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you'd get more players if you were in a harder setting.

1480
01:55:08,954 --> 01:55:10,175
[SPEAKER_21]: No, actually, you'd be surprised.

1481
01:55:10,215 --> 01:55:11,796
[SPEAKER_21]: You get a lot of people on the light settings here.

1482
01:55:11,816 --> 01:55:12,897
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to see if anyone joins.

1483
01:55:13,778 --> 01:55:15,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, any feedback from our chatroom?

1484
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:16,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you're a little closer to the chatroom over there.

1485
01:55:17,881 --> 01:55:19,602
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you're overworked here on this show.

1486
01:55:24,966 --> 01:55:33,432
[SPEAKER_21]: They're talking about... Leave it to somebody to try and ruin the goddamn... Did you see what happened there?

1487
01:55:34,373 --> 01:55:36,975
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, somebody's trying to come in and ruin our live experiment here.

1488
01:55:37,135 --> 01:55:37,595
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's okay.

1489
01:55:37,615 --> 01:55:38,316
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I can block them.

1490
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:40,419
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to try that again.

1491
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:42,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Who do you think?

1492
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:44,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Who always wants attention on this show?

1493
01:55:44,421 --> 01:55:45,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the moron?

1494
01:55:45,742 --> 01:55:46,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1495
01:55:46,042 --> 01:55:48,663
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm pretty sure I can boot him.

1496
01:55:53,526 --> 01:55:53,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

1497
01:55:53,986 --> 01:55:54,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on here.

1498
01:55:56,227 --> 01:55:57,148
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm pretty sure we can do this.

1499
01:55:57,168 --> 01:55:58,208
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's try this again.

1500
01:56:04,707 --> 01:56:05,067
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

1501
01:56:05,227 --> 01:56:08,908
[SPEAKER_21]: If they join, they're muted, so we wouldn't be able to hear them, so it doesn't know good to join anymore.

1502
01:56:09,528 --> 01:56:09,828
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1503
01:56:12,348 --> 01:56:13,428
[SPEAKER_21]: God, I love Xbox Live.

1504
01:56:13,468 --> 01:56:13,789
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1505
01:56:15,669 --> 01:56:16,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's try this again.

1506
01:56:16,489 --> 01:56:21,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Now we're sitting in there waiting for somebody to hopefully join, so... Blocked.

1507
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:21,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Ha ha.

1508
01:56:21,830 --> 01:56:23,590
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, they're not blocked, we just can't hear them.

1509
01:56:23,890 --> 01:56:24,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1510
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:25,511
[SPEAKER_21]: So they can do whatever they want.

1511
01:56:25,531 --> 01:56:26,171
[SPEAKER_13]: So it doesn't matter.

1512
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:27,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it doesn't matter what they say.

1513
01:56:27,251 --> 01:56:27,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Stupid idiot.

1514
01:56:29,271 --> 01:56:29,551
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1515
01:56:31,271 --> 01:56:34,132
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually wonder if there's a way we can... Try booting.

1516
01:56:34,868 --> 01:56:35,909
[SPEAKER_21]: There is no boot option.

1517
01:56:37,351 --> 01:56:38,132
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, chat room?

1518
01:56:38,212 --> 01:56:43,818
[SPEAKER_21]: If this is all we're going to get is one loser with nothing better to do, then we're going to end this segment.

1519
01:56:44,118 --> 01:56:46,060
[SPEAKER_21]: And you guys suck for suggesting we should do it.

1520
01:56:50,805 --> 01:56:56,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if you can send a screaming feedback.

1521
01:56:59,542 --> 01:57:00,182
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to bother.

1522
01:57:00,323 --> 01:57:00,903
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to bother.

1523
01:57:01,323 --> 01:57:04,985
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just going to... The thing's muted, so they can't do anything anyway.

1524
01:57:05,005 --> 01:57:06,045
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no good to be on.

1525
01:57:07,005 --> 01:57:07,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we got somebody.

1526
01:57:10,067 --> 01:57:10,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally.

1527
01:57:12,228 --> 01:57:13,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we got a match.

1528
01:57:13,388 --> 01:57:15,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, now hopefully everybody says they can start.

1529
01:57:16,269 --> 01:57:17,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1530
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:19,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, take your mic down.

1531
01:57:19,611 --> 01:57:20,171
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll do commentary.

1532
01:57:20,511 --> 01:57:20,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1533
01:57:24,853 --> 01:57:25,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

1534
01:57:25,613 --> 01:57:26,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you ready?

1535
01:57:27,034 --> 01:57:27,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance!

1536
01:57:41,874 --> 01:57:43,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Does anyone know how to play this game?

1537
01:57:43,274 --> 01:57:44,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't stop, Player 3!

1538
01:57:50,136 --> 01:57:50,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah!

1539
01:57:51,036 --> 01:57:51,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Player 2!

1540
01:57:54,877 --> 01:57:55,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah!

1541
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:04,239
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like Player 1 can take this one!

1542
01:58:11,337 --> 01:58:13,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's hear it!

1543
01:58:13,919 --> 01:58:14,920
Player 2-0 on fire!

1544
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:16,021
Player 1 has the advantage!

1545
01:58:37,714 --> 01:58:38,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Call the fire department!

1546
01:58:39,035 --> 01:58:40,936
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a five alarm dancer!

1547
01:58:40,976 --> 01:58:43,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Just disturbed, guys.

1548
01:58:43,557 --> 01:58:44,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God!

1549
01:58:44,358 --> 01:58:45,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick, call the fire department!

1550
01:58:45,818 --> 01:58:47,059
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a five alarm dancer!

1551
01:58:47,099 --> 01:58:47,339
Oh, no!

1552
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:11,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed like one step at the end there.

1553
01:59:14,413 --> 01:59:15,073
I'm so excited.

1554
01:59:15,133 --> 01:59:15,593
I got three points.

1555
01:59:32,469 --> 01:59:33,410
[SPEAKER_21]: Those guys were losers.

1556
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:34,570
[SPEAKER_21]: They didn't even talk at all.

1557
01:59:34,610 --> 01:59:36,151
[SPEAKER_21]: What a waste of a segment that was.

1558
01:59:36,191 --> 01:59:38,473
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm never letting the chatroom pick a segment for us again.

1559
01:59:40,534 --> 01:59:43,856
[SPEAKER_21]: You know the only good thing we got out of that segment was getting to hear DXY.

1560
01:59:43,876 --> 01:59:44,636
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1561
01:59:44,917 --> 01:59:45,177
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1562
01:59:45,597 --> 01:59:47,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to play the chatroom.

1563
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:49,139
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to play against chatroom listeners?

1564
01:59:49,159 --> 01:59:50,480
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I would like to... Oh, I'm sorry.

1565
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:51,681
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we'll switch it back over to chat.

1566
01:59:51,701 --> 01:59:52,181
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't worry about that.

1567
01:59:54,335 --> 01:59:55,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki's getting to work.

1568
01:59:55,196 --> 01:59:55,536
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1569
01:59:55,896 --> 01:59:56,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1570
01:59:56,356 --> 01:59:57,677
[SPEAKER_21]: What a fun thing that that was.

1571
01:59:57,978 --> 01:59:58,558
[SPEAKER_21]: What did we get?

1572
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:02,000
[SPEAKER_21]: We got one person with nothing better to do than to stalk this show.

1573
02:00:02,241 --> 02:00:05,743
[SPEAKER_21]: And we got two people who didn't even talk when we tried to, you know, get them to say stuff.

1574
02:00:06,303 --> 02:00:06,724
[SPEAKER_21]: Boring.

1575
02:00:08,365 --> 02:00:13,588
[SPEAKER_21]: I think someone has a... And everybody got to see me break my combo at the end there and see what a horrible DDR player I am.

1576
02:00:14,869 --> 02:00:15,250
God.

1577
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:15,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1578
02:00:16,651 --> 02:00:22,835
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I was going to come up on the show today and apologize for, you know, bringing old drama...

1579
02:00:24,933 --> 02:00:28,615
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't apologize for something that somebody else keeps perpetuating.

1580
02:00:28,635 --> 02:00:29,436
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fucked up.

1581
02:00:30,136 --> 02:00:31,037
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to stop that.

1582
02:00:31,437 --> 02:00:33,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Here.

1583
02:00:34,078 --> 02:00:35,679
[SPEAKER_13]: That message in the chat room is for Loki.

1584
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:40,101
[SPEAKER_13]: He's mumbling incoherently at the stupidity of some people.

1585
02:00:42,322 --> 02:00:44,143
[SPEAKER_21]: At least I won, so I feel a little better.

1586
02:00:44,183 --> 02:00:45,224
[SPEAKER_21]: At least I didn't get my ass kicked.

1587
02:00:45,244 --> 02:00:48,305
[SPEAKER_13]: At least dumbass got nearly last.

1588
02:00:49,886 --> 02:00:50,867
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that made me feel a little better.

1589
02:00:50,887 --> 02:00:51,267
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pathetic.

1590
02:00:51,786 --> 02:00:51,826
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1591
02:00:51,846 --> 02:00:51,886
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1592
02:00:51,926 --> 02:00:52,146
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1593
02:01:13,271 --> 02:01:19,033
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I guess what we'll do is we'll go to our break, and when we come back, we'll find out the winner of tonight's cage match, and we'll do the FUs of the week.

1594
02:01:19,073 --> 02:01:22,495
[SPEAKER_21]: But please don't send the FUs yet, because we'll get to those a little bit later.

1595
02:01:22,515 --> 02:01:22,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, guys?

1596
02:01:24,995 --> 02:01:26,776
[SPEAKER_21]: I've still got to tally the cage match votes.

1597
02:01:26,796 --> 02:01:28,617
[SPEAKER_21]: So in this break, what do we want to hear in this break?

1598
02:01:28,637 --> 02:01:32,458
[SPEAKER_21]: We want to hear... Let's do five-key stuff.

1599
02:01:32,718 --> 02:01:33,599
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to hear five-key stuff.

1600
02:01:33,619 --> 02:01:34,739
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to hear Prince on a Star.

1601
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:36,660
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to hear Prince on a Star.

1602
02:01:38,769 --> 02:01:39,810
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to play Lin 1999.

1603
02:01:40,471 --> 02:01:40,791
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1604
02:01:41,151 --> 02:01:42,613
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie wants to hear Lin 1999.

1605
02:01:43,013 --> 02:01:45,395
[SPEAKER_21]: And how about the Metal Gear Solid song from Beatmania 3?

1606
02:01:45,515 --> 02:01:46,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, that's cool.

1607
02:01:46,316 --> 02:01:46,596
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1608
02:01:46,616 --> 02:01:47,557
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be back after this.

1609
02:01:48,238 --> 02:01:48,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy.

02:05:56,224 --> 02:05:57,265
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't, what am I gonna do?

[SPEAKER_21]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

02:06:12,948 --> 02:06:15,009
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

1634
02:07:34,660 --> 02:07:34,980
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1635
02:07:35,561 --> 02:07:36,702
[SPEAKER_21]: We did that a couple weeks ago.

1636
02:07:37,082 --> 02:07:38,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you saying I missed it?

1637
02:07:38,243 --> 02:07:39,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you missed it.

1638
02:07:39,504 --> 02:07:41,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, fuck!

1639
02:07:42,186 --> 02:07:45,108
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, just for you, kind sir, I'll play it again later in the show.

1640
02:07:45,488 --> 02:07:46,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, thank you very much.

1641
02:07:46,549 --> 02:07:47,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you're welcome very much.

1642
02:07:48,462 --> 02:07:49,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for calling.

1643
02:07:50,023 --> 02:07:50,643
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, bye.

1644
02:07:53,564 --> 02:07:55,565
[SPEAKER_21]: See, that's a good Skype call right there.

1645
02:07:56,405 --> 02:07:56,745
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1646
02:07:57,486 --> 02:07:59,327
[SPEAKER_13]: I've played it every week on my show.

1647
02:08:00,787 --> 02:08:01,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you?

1648
02:08:01,387 --> 02:08:01,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I have.

1649
02:08:02,008 --> 02:08:02,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, then, you know.

1650
02:08:02,888 --> 02:08:05,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I marathoned the Silent Hill 4 U.S.

1651
02:08:05,269 --> 02:08:05,729
[SPEAKER_13]: soundtrack.

1652
02:08:06,049 --> 02:08:07,090
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, people should turn it in.

1653
02:08:08,190 --> 02:08:09,891
[SPEAKER_13]: If people listened, they would know.

1654
02:08:10,751 --> 02:08:11,732
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, I know.

1655
02:08:13,012 --> 02:08:14,613
[SPEAKER_13]: No one ever requests anything on my show, either.

1656
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:19,062
[SPEAKER_21]: So Skype line's open if you want to call in.

1657
02:08:22,485 --> 02:08:23,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Call us.

1658
02:08:23,946 --> 02:08:28,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Pick up the phone.

1659
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:35,135
[SPEAKER_21]: 1-900-HOT-POTATO I had to block some people there because certain people are still trying to get through.

1660
02:08:35,155 --> 02:08:36,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people never learn.

1661
02:08:37,757 --> 02:08:40,319
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, I'm just glad they're listening and keeping our ratings up.

1662
02:08:40,379 --> 02:08:40,880
[SPEAKER_21]: This is good.

1663
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:41,841
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1664
02:08:42,001 --> 02:08:42,261
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up?

1665
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:42,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a theory.

1666
02:08:43,382 --> 02:08:44,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1667
02:08:45,163 --> 02:08:46,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that

1668
02:08:47,479 --> 02:08:49,981
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no sperm involved in that person's creation.

1669
02:08:50,441 --> 02:08:50,841
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

1670
02:08:51,262 --> 02:08:52,623
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it was Jell-O.

1671
02:08:54,424 --> 02:08:58,588
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's talk about who won tonight's cage match.

1672
02:08:58,648 --> 02:09:01,250
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a new winner in tonight's cage match, finally.

1673
02:09:02,071 --> 02:09:04,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally, Loki has to pick a new song, because we have a new winner.

1674
02:09:07,896 --> 02:09:09,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have to do shit next week.

1675
02:09:11,419 --> 02:09:15,142
[SPEAKER_21]: Bond won the cage match, and better yet, we're getting another call.

1676
02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:17,458
[SPEAKER_21]: Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1677
02:09:20,459 --> 02:09:21,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, it is Dark Knight.

1678
02:09:21,819 --> 02:09:23,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing?

1679
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:25,800
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm alright, how about y'all?

1680
02:09:25,820 --> 02:09:26,921
[SPEAKER_14]: We're pretty good, what's on your mind?

1681
02:09:28,181 --> 02:09:31,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Not much, I'll tell you what, that last call should make Classic Call of the Week.

1682
02:09:32,222 --> 02:09:34,823
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think we should make that Classic Call of the Week.

1683
02:09:35,443 --> 02:09:35,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1684
02:09:35,903 --> 02:09:38,644
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just put the blunt side of it.

1685
02:09:38,944 --> 02:09:41,064
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't want to do anything to try and one-up that call?

1686
02:09:42,905 --> 02:09:44,405
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't come up with anything close.

1687
02:09:45,027 --> 02:09:46,247
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, alright.

1688
02:09:46,767 --> 02:09:49,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, what do you think about how Ultramix 2 is shaping up?

1689
02:09:50,668 --> 02:09:52,068
[SPEAKER_21]: With some of those new songs announced this week.

1690
02:09:54,449 --> 02:09:59,530
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty decent, but I'm still like, no Xbox for me, I'm not touching it.

1691
02:09:59,610 --> 02:10:09,231
[SPEAKER_21]: It was so hard for a long time to have to kind of finally say, oh, I gotta cave and buy the Xbox, but I tell you what, once I got it, there was actually some decent games on it.

1692
02:10:09,411 --> 02:10:12,872
[SPEAKER_21]: One or two, but DDR is one of them, so it's worth it.

1693
02:10:13,132 --> 02:10:13,512
[SPEAKER_21]: It's worth it.

1694
02:10:14,577 --> 02:10:20,984
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you what, though, on that suggestion about having other people play against you, like somebody said, Chamberlain, why you didn't play a hard song?

1695
02:10:21,929 --> 02:10:46,862
[SPEAKER_21]: because I wanted other people that don't listen to the show to come into the game and play and we would kind of mess with them a little bit like I'd say I'd never played DDR before and hopefully they would talk because usually the lamer people are the ones that play the light songs so I sort of was trying to bait some of the younger players and stuff but it didn't work we only got a couple losers that can't get over themselves that wanted to join and people that don't talk so what can you do?

1696
02:10:48,203 --> 02:10:49,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Dark Knight Hey Angel Hi

1697
02:11:10,771 --> 02:11:12,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, this is Dark Knight.

1698
02:11:12,092 --> 02:11:12,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1699
02:11:12,613 --> 02:11:13,233
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's cool.

1700
02:11:13,433 --> 02:11:13,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Rob.

1701
02:11:14,094 --> 02:11:14,314
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1702
02:11:14,354 --> 02:11:15,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob.

1703
02:11:15,355 --> 02:11:15,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob.

1704
02:11:15,776 --> 02:11:16,036
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1705
02:11:16,116 --> 02:11:16,316
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1706
02:11:16,456 --> 02:11:16,736
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1707
02:11:16,817 --> 02:11:17,037
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1708
02:11:17,117 --> 02:11:17,277
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1709
02:11:17,357 --> 02:11:18,398
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got Dark Knight on the phone.

1710
02:11:18,418 --> 02:11:19,179
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you talking to me for?

1711
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:22,001
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'm going to let him go now.

1712
02:11:22,101 --> 02:11:23,423
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you take care, Dark Knight.

1713
02:11:23,443 --> 02:11:24,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for calling.

1714
02:11:24,684 --> 02:11:24,984
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

1715
02:11:25,004 --> 02:11:25,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.

1716
02:11:25,745 --> 02:11:25,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1717
02:11:25,885 --> 02:11:26,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Bye-bye.

1718
02:11:26,986 --> 02:11:28,667
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, Zeno in our chat room raises...

1719
02:11:30,968 --> 02:11:33,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Zeno in our chatroom raises a point about the folks on Ultramix.

1720
02:11:34,649 --> 02:11:38,970
[SPEAKER_21]: There's hardly anybody that wants to play the heavy stuff because a lot of them are actually on dance pads.

1721
02:11:39,390 --> 02:11:41,411
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's kind of hard to play heavy stuff on dance pads.

1722
02:11:41,451 --> 02:11:42,891
[SPEAKER_21]: So he says nobody plays heavy.

1723
02:11:42,931 --> 02:11:44,532
[SPEAKER_21]: And from what I've seen, that's kind of true.

1724
02:11:44,932 --> 02:11:46,892
[SPEAKER_21]: Zaku's calling back, so I thought we'd pick up his call.

1725
02:11:46,912 --> 02:11:47,532
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up, Zaku?

1726
02:11:49,933 --> 02:11:54,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering, what are the chances of another...

1727
02:11:59,955 --> 02:12:00,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, spit it out.

1728
02:12:00,696 --> 02:12:12,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering exactly why, you know, why does Microsoft have favoritism towards, you know, why do they have favoritism towards Konami in that sense?

1729
02:12:12,526 --> 02:12:26,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they get downloaded songs, and while PS2 users get crapped on, because even though we already have a hard drive, there's no way in God's green earth we're actually going to be able to download songs, so we're basically screwed.

1730
02:12:28,664 --> 02:12:29,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Good points.

1731
02:12:29,184 --> 02:12:32,770
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to go ahead and let you go because our connection is a little crappy, but I'm going to talk about this point.

1732
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:33,751
[SPEAKER_21]: So tune back into the show.

1733
02:12:33,771 --> 02:12:34,752
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to talk about this, okay?

1734
02:12:36,844 --> 02:12:42,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Why is it that Ultramix 2 folks get to download songs but the PS2 folks don't?

1735
02:12:42,948 --> 02:12:43,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Why do you think that is?

1736
02:12:44,789 --> 02:12:57,718
[SPEAKER_21]: My own thought is that I think they've been trying to take PS2 games in one direction and Ultramix in the other direction because if PS2 had everything the Xbox game had, same song list, same everything, you wouldn't buy both of them.

1737
02:12:58,839 --> 02:12:59,439
[SPEAKER_22]: I would.

1738
02:13:01,588 --> 02:13:05,750
[SPEAKER_21]: The few hardcore folks that would just be all about supporting Bomani, yes, they still would.

1739
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:08,072
[SPEAKER_21]: But the majority of people would not buy both games.

1740
02:13:08,132 --> 02:13:15,596
[SPEAKER_21]: But if PS2 is allowed to have its iToy thing going one way, and Xbox has its live thing going one way, then, you know...

1741
02:13:16,056 --> 02:13:19,977
[SPEAKER_21]: That's, to me, kind of, I think, Konami trying to shape both games in a way.

1742
02:13:19,997 --> 02:13:23,338
[SPEAKER_13]: They're taking two of the strongest points of each system and making that the focal point.

1743
02:13:23,538 --> 02:13:39,421
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think it has anything to do with Microsoft sucking Konami off to get them to do that or anything, although I do know that Microsoft uses DDR Ultramix to show other developers, hey, look what you can do with a game and how you can make money, because they've been making a lot of money off those songpacks.

1744
02:13:39,921 --> 02:13:40,101
[SPEAKER_21]: So...

1745
02:13:41,317 --> 02:13:41,717
[SPEAKER_21]: GameCube

1746
02:14:10,891 --> 02:14:14,434
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, sucks to be a GameCube user, because you're never going to see a DDR mix, probably.

1747
02:14:14,754 --> 02:14:15,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably not.

1748
02:14:15,895 --> 02:14:25,743
[SPEAKER_13]: The only thing the GameCube has going for it as far as online play is the new PSO that's coming out for it, but apart from that... Yeah, I mean, but that has nothing to do with Konami and stuff.

1749
02:14:26,324 --> 02:14:32,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, it's nothing to do with favoritism or... PS2 just has, of the three, the worst online.

1750
02:14:32,509 --> 02:14:33,270
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, seriously.

1751
02:14:33,890 --> 02:14:35,291
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not all that strong.

1752
02:14:35,672 --> 02:14:37,694
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I talk to people who get booted off of it all the time.

1753
02:14:37,914 --> 02:14:38,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1754
02:14:39,063 --> 02:14:41,944
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Xbox is built to be an online system.

1755
02:14:42,204 --> 02:14:42,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it is.

1756
02:14:43,464 --> 02:14:46,504
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you have to look... You know, I look at it this way.

1757
02:14:48,265 --> 02:14:50,665
[SPEAKER_13]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1758
02:14:51,365 --> 02:14:55,646
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have said this, you know, since the days where people are going, Well, the Saturn sucks.

1759
02:14:55,866 --> 02:14:56,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no, it doesn't.

1760
02:14:56,966 --> 02:14:58,086
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just playing games that suck.

1761
02:15:00,587 --> 02:15:04,467
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you take a look at the Xbox, it's built with the online capacity.

1762
02:15:04,527 --> 02:15:05,788
[SPEAKER_13]: It's built with a hard drive.

1763
02:15:06,068 --> 02:15:06,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at the PS2.

1764
02:15:06,888 --> 02:15:08,128
[SPEAKER_13]: These are peripherals, you know.

1765
02:15:08,567 --> 02:15:11,070
[SPEAKER_13]: These are things that were added on later.

1766
02:15:12,692 --> 02:15:17,777
[SPEAKER_13]: The first model PS2, I have a Japanese PlayStation 2, it doesn't have anywhere to put a hard drive in it, I'm sorry.

1767
02:15:18,398 --> 02:15:19,959
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to have an external hard drive.

1768
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,682
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an afterthought.

1769
02:15:22,923 --> 02:15:29,610
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to look at what a system is built to do and then see, well, am I going to use this capacity that the machine has?

1770
02:15:31,347 --> 02:15:44,305
[SPEAKER_21]: I do understand though the points being brought up, but it just kind of sucks that you have to pay an Xbox Live fee over and above, because on PS2 you don't usually have to pay extra fees, maybe certain games, but on Xbox, if you want to play anything online, you've got to pay that extra fee.

1771
02:15:45,006 --> 02:15:45,486
[SPEAKER_13]: What's $10 a month?

1772
02:15:45,506 --> 02:15:45,907
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nothing.

1773
02:15:48,681 --> 02:15:51,123
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's still, I mean, it's a lot of money.

1774
02:15:51,583 --> 02:15:58,247
[SPEAKER_13]: But a lot of the games that have online don't often require that you pay for the online with the game.

1775
02:15:58,287 --> 02:16:00,148
[SPEAKER_13]: They're getting their back in this.

1776
02:16:00,168 --> 02:16:02,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's sort of the trade-off is that then the games don't really charge.

1777
02:16:02,910 --> 02:16:11,095
[SPEAKER_13]: The only games that I really see justifying having that extra fee, like for example, Phantasy Star Online, because they have to keep the servers up, right?

1778
02:16:11,996 --> 02:16:16,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it costs for maintenance there, so of course they're going to have to charge what the $9 a month that it is.

1779
02:16:16,598 --> 02:16:17,519
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the thing is that

1780
02:16:17,898 --> 02:16:24,621
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you're paying that little bit a month for the Xbox Live, but for most of the other online, you're getting that for free.

1781
02:16:25,841 --> 02:16:30,003
[SPEAKER_13]: And then some of the others, you're paying a very minimal amount to get it over.

1782
02:16:30,903 --> 02:16:34,805
[SPEAKER_21]: But then, of course, it comes up the fact that Xbox Live doesn't support dial-up.

1783
02:16:34,985 --> 02:16:38,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's just because it's so intense, all the bandwidth.

1784
02:16:38,286 --> 02:16:40,407
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you saw while we were playing there, we have voice going over.

1785
02:16:40,627 --> 02:16:41,728
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't do it dial-up.

1786
02:16:41,808 --> 02:16:44,049
[SPEAKER_21]: You can do dial-up, but you have to get extra stuff, right?

1787
02:16:44,089 --> 02:16:45,429
[SPEAKER_21]: How would you hook that up, Loki?

1788
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:46,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Hell if I know.

1789
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:46,970
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1790
02:16:47,429 --> 02:16:48,631
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you can do it.

1791
02:16:48,771 --> 02:16:52,977
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go to the Microsoft site, I think that they have a dial-up adapter.

1792
02:16:53,018 --> 02:16:53,839
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a way to do it.

1793
02:16:54,159 --> 02:16:58,506
[SPEAKER_21]: I think over on DDR Freak there's a thread about how to get the service packs with dial-up.

1794
02:16:58,626 --> 02:17:00,409
[SPEAKER_21]: I know somebody wrote an FAQ on that.

1795
02:17:00,429 --> 02:17:01,891
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't remember who or where it's at, but...

1796
02:17:03,450 --> 02:17:07,632
[SPEAKER_13]: On top of that though, these days there's hardly any excuse not to have broadband.

1797
02:17:08,132 --> 02:17:10,754
[SPEAKER_21]: You may still live in an area that doesn't have it.

1798
02:17:10,894 --> 02:17:11,514
[SPEAKER_21]: Very possible.

1799
02:17:11,614 --> 02:17:14,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you live in an area that doesn't have it, that's understandable.

1800
02:17:14,135 --> 02:17:19,978
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you're thinking of expense, broadband now is sometimes cheaper than another phone line.

1801
02:17:21,779 --> 02:17:22,079
[SPEAKER_21]: Very true.

1802
02:17:22,605 --> 02:17:28,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'll open up the Skype line for a little bit more here, see if anybody wants to call in, but otherwise we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1803
02:17:28,706 --> 02:17:34,168
[SPEAKER_21]: We did, by the way, boys and girls, we had another net split, so about half our chat room can't get in.

1804
02:17:34,268 --> 02:17:35,668
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's take this call.

1805
02:17:35,788 --> 02:17:37,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Our old buddy Jason's calling in.

1806
02:17:37,309 --> 02:17:37,789
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up?

1807
02:17:38,709 --> 02:17:39,309
[SPEAKER_30]: Hello, Rob.

1808
02:17:39,529 --> 02:17:40,049
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Jason.

1809
02:17:40,069 --> 02:17:40,489
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing?

1810
02:17:41,089 --> 02:17:46,291
[SPEAKER_30]: I just heard you guys start mentioning the ILF Connections to Xbox Live and thought I'd give you a ring again.

1811
02:17:46,631 --> 02:17:47,371
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, yeah, what's up?

1812
02:17:48,264 --> 02:17:53,429
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, you know, as we all know now, as soon as DDR Freak comes back up... Yeah, it's down today.

1813
02:17:53,489 --> 02:17:53,890
[SPEAKER_22]: What's up?

1814
02:17:53,950 --> 02:17:54,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Who broke it?

1815
02:17:54,650 --> 02:17:55,311
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you break it?

1816
02:17:55,992 --> 02:18:03,819
[SPEAKER_30]: I talked Blue and J-Dog, and they're hashing something out, so they'll get it up, hopefully sometime tonight, if not tomorrow morning.

1817
02:18:04,019 --> 02:18:04,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1818
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:05,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry I broke it.

1819
02:18:06,141 --> 02:18:07,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just too much for it, you know?

1820
02:18:07,863 --> 02:18:09,164
[SPEAKER_22]: She coughed on it, and it broke.

1821
02:18:09,544 --> 02:18:10,345
[SPEAKER_13]: It caught my cooties.

1822
02:18:12,887 --> 02:18:14,829
[SPEAKER_22]: What's up with the dial-up stuff in Xbox Live?

1823
02:18:15,393 --> 02:18:21,138
[SPEAKER_30]: So when it's back up, there's two really good resources that Cutris posted in the console games forum.

1824
02:18:21,298 --> 02:18:26,542
[SPEAKER_30]: One of them is dial-up users that want to connect to Xbox Live.

1825
02:18:26,963 --> 02:18:43,416
[SPEAKER_30]: It's basically you have to get a connection on your computer and then have a way of running another network cable out to the Xbox, because that's the only way of plugging it in, and then do internet connection sharing so Xbox connects.

1826
02:18:44,051 --> 02:18:48,194
[SPEAKER_30]: and then it just uses your PC's bandwidth to, well, to do the work.

1827
02:18:48,534 --> 02:18:49,555
[SPEAKER_22]: What a pain in the ass.

1828
02:18:50,615 --> 02:18:53,778
[SPEAKER_30]: It's something that I did for a while before I got my router, as a matter of fact.

1829
02:18:53,918 --> 02:18:54,318
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow.

1830
02:18:54,958 --> 02:18:56,439
[SPEAKER_30]: ZXP makes it really, really easy.

1831
02:18:56,499 --> 02:18:59,021
[SPEAKER_30]: If you have anything else, Google.

1832
02:18:59,882 --> 02:19:00,742
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Google.

1833
02:19:01,283 --> 02:19:02,483
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, thanks for the tip, Jason.

1834
02:19:02,503 --> 02:19:04,184
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure some of our listeners appreciate that.

1835
02:19:04,685 --> 02:19:05,145
[SPEAKER_30]: No problem.

1836
02:19:05,385 --> 02:19:06,366
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, you have a good one, buddy.

1837
02:19:06,686 --> 02:19:07,587
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else you wanted to say?

1838
02:19:07,767 --> 02:19:09,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else about Ultramix or any of that stuff?

1839
02:19:09,948 --> 02:19:13,851
[SPEAKER_30]: They'll appreciate it a lot more as soon as DDR Free comes back up and they can actually read how to do it.

1840
02:19:14,373 --> 02:19:17,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, was it just me or did that Ultramix segment kind of suck?

1841
02:19:19,334 --> 02:19:20,495
[SPEAKER_30]: The start of it sucked.

1842
02:19:21,175 --> 02:19:21,715
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, it did.

1843
02:19:21,755 --> 02:19:22,315
[SPEAKER_30]: Nobody talked.

1844
02:19:22,595 --> 02:19:23,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, well.

1845
02:19:23,295 --> 02:19:24,035
[SPEAKER_21]: I tried, Jason.

1846
02:19:24,075 --> 02:19:24,716
[SPEAKER_21]: I tried for you.

1847
02:19:25,356 --> 02:19:26,356
[SPEAKER_30]: You're very good for doing so.

1848
02:19:26,536 --> 02:19:27,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, take care.

1849
02:19:27,876 --> 02:19:28,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1850
02:19:30,877 --> 02:19:31,137
[SPEAKER_22]: Why not?

1851
02:19:31,157 --> 02:19:32,858
[SPEAKER_22]: We're actually getting a lot of people on Skype now.

1852
02:19:32,878 --> 02:19:33,418
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of cool.

1853
02:19:33,478 --> 02:19:35,398
[SPEAKER_22]: So, open it up one more time.

1854
02:19:35,438 --> 02:19:36,739
[SPEAKER_22]: See if anybody else wants to call in.

1855
02:19:38,139 --> 02:19:39,359
[SPEAKER_22]: If not, we'll go into the FUs of the week.

1856
02:19:39,539 --> 02:19:41,760
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm kind of waiting for our net thing to reconnect.

1857
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:42,300
[SPEAKER_22]: So...

1858
02:19:43,373 --> 02:19:45,094
[SPEAKER_22]: BlackDevilRx, what's on your mind tonight?

1859
02:20:12,522 --> 02:20:17,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Not much, I was just sitting here listening to the whole Ultramix thing.

1860
02:20:18,064 --> 02:20:19,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Little program we have, right?

1861
02:20:19,845 --> 02:20:20,986
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you ever listened to the show before?

1862
02:20:22,726 --> 02:20:25,308
[SPEAKER_16]: No, actually, this is my first time.

1863
02:20:25,468 --> 02:20:26,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it kind of sucks, huh?

1864
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:30,830
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's alright, it's alright.

1865
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:31,570
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we suck.

1866
02:20:31,610 --> 02:20:32,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't answer that.

1867
02:20:33,491 --> 02:20:34,091
[SPEAKER_22]: What's on your mind?

1868
02:20:34,131 --> 02:20:36,912
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you think about Ultramix 2 coming out?

1869
02:20:36,932 --> 02:20:40,474
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I don't know, I just kind of see how this works.

1870
02:20:42,839 --> 02:20:46,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we your guinea pigs for testing this program?

1871
02:20:47,502 --> 02:20:47,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Sort of.

1872
02:20:48,203 --> 02:20:48,823
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, well, that's all right.

1873
02:20:49,083 --> 02:20:51,725
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, what do you think about the new DDR games coming out this fall?

1874
02:20:51,745 --> 02:20:52,846
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you planning on picking one of them up?

1875
02:20:52,886 --> 02:20:53,767
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they're both great.

1876
02:20:53,807 --> 02:20:58,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they have, you know, an awesome selections of, awesome selections, really.

1877
02:20:58,590 --> 02:21:06,175
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you think about the whole fact that PS2 is not online and Xbox doesn't have iToy?

1878
02:21:06,235 --> 02:21:07,956
[SPEAKER_22]: Why do you think, what's your opinion on that?

1879
02:21:07,996 --> 02:21:10,438
[SPEAKER_22]: Why do you think the games are going in completely different directions?

1880
02:21:11,772 --> 02:21:19,556
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I mean, they're both made by different companies, as I understand, and they're, you know, PS2 has the eye toy thing.

1881
02:21:19,876 --> 02:21:25,819
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, so sort of, you're referring to those rumors that Harmonix had something to do with Xtreme, right?

1882
02:21:26,359 --> 02:21:26,899
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, yeah.

1883
02:21:27,139 --> 02:21:31,721
[SPEAKER_22]: From what I understand, those were proven to be false to some extent.

1884
02:21:32,622 --> 02:21:34,503
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know the details on that, but regardless.

1885
02:21:34,823 --> 02:21:36,204
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have Konami of Hawaii.

1886
02:21:36,224 --> 02:21:36,964
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't really go...

1887
02:21:38,086 --> 02:21:39,706
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some sort of thing that's wrong.

1888
02:21:39,786 --> 02:21:42,727
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm getting some sort of double post, like some sort of echo.

1889
02:21:43,227 --> 02:21:44,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Turn down your Win app because you're hearing us twice.

1890
02:21:45,028 --> 02:21:45,368
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why.

1891
02:21:47,368 --> 02:21:47,728
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all right.

1892
02:21:48,228 --> 02:21:48,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't panic.

1893
02:21:49,449 --> 02:21:50,169
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything will be okay.

1894
02:21:50,469 --> 02:21:50,869
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't panic.

1895
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:56,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, you're talking about how Ultramix is made in Hawaii and Extreme is made in Japan, right?

1896
02:21:56,731 --> 02:21:57,171
[SPEAKER_22]: Kind of that?

1897
02:21:57,211 --> 02:21:57,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1898
02:21:57,651 --> 02:21:58,071
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

1899
02:21:58,431 --> 02:21:58,691
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1900
02:21:58,871 --> 02:22:00,031
[SPEAKER_22]: So you think maybe that has to do with it?

1901
02:22:00,692 --> 02:22:00,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1902
02:22:01,012 --> 02:22:01,812
[SPEAKER_22]: That's an interesting theory.

1903
02:22:01,832 --> 02:22:02,072
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1904
02:22:02,092 --> 02:22:02,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else you want to share?

1905
02:22:03,772 --> 02:22:04,272
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's it.

1906
02:22:04,492 --> 02:22:04,753
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1907
02:22:04,793 --> 02:22:05,353
[SPEAKER_22]: Have a good one, buddy.

1908
02:22:05,913 --> 02:22:06,153
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1909
02:22:06,213 --> 02:22:06,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

1910
02:22:06,413 --> 02:22:06,553
[SPEAKER_22]: Bye.

1911
02:22:07,779 --> 02:22:10,000
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm liking this Skype line thing now that people actually use it.

1912
02:22:10,220 --> 02:22:10,500
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1913
02:22:11,641 --> 02:22:13,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, let's get into the FUs of the week, shall we?

1914
02:22:14,322 --> 02:22:14,842
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, wait.

1915
02:22:14,862 --> 02:22:17,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there was one more person we hadn't heard from that was trying to call in.

1916
02:22:17,924 --> 02:22:20,865
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to see if that person can get through.

1917
02:22:20,925 --> 02:22:23,226
[SPEAKER_21]: If you've already called us this segment, please don't call back.

1918
02:22:23,366 --> 02:22:24,927
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't pick up because we already talked to you.

1919
02:22:25,427 --> 02:22:28,389
[SPEAKER_21]: But there was somebody else trying to get through that we hadn't talked to yet.

1920
02:22:28,409 --> 02:22:29,890
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to give them a chance to get through.

1921
02:22:29,910 --> 02:22:33,931
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see if they call.

1922
02:22:35,452 --> 02:22:36,833
[SPEAKER_21]: Hmm.

1923
02:22:36,853 --> 02:22:37,113
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

1924
02:22:39,295 --> 02:22:40,596
[SPEAKER_21]: This is certainly a new thing for us, too.

1925
02:22:40,696 --> 02:22:46,838
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know of any other internet radio station that does this for their listeners, where they can talk on Skype and stuff.

1926
02:22:47,138 --> 02:22:48,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, there's one.

1927
02:22:48,259 --> 02:22:50,039
[SPEAKER_21]: I forgot that they do that, too.

1928
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:51,820
[SPEAKER_21]: Bad Me.

1929
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:54,301
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, our parent station, Understation Live.

1930
02:22:54,341 --> 02:22:57,262
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, for that, for my mistake, I will give them a free plug.

1931
02:22:57,622 --> 02:22:59,403
[SPEAKER_21]: www.understationlive.org.

1932
02:22:59,563 --> 02:22:59,843
[SPEAKER_21]: Listen.

1933
02:23:00,143 --> 02:23:00,703
[SPEAKER_13]: They're awesome.

1934
02:23:00,863 --> 02:23:01,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Travis and Jenna.

1935
02:23:01,684 --> 02:23:01,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1936
02:23:02,704 --> 02:23:04,665
[SPEAKER_21]: They're still doing their show on, like, Saturdays, right?

1937
02:23:04,805 --> 02:23:06,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and they have spinoffs occasionally, too.

1938
02:23:07,126 --> 02:23:07,386
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1939
02:23:09,005 --> 02:23:13,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of which, we have to give a shout out to the baby, because the baby turned one this week.

1940
02:23:13,707 --> 02:23:15,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Aww, their baby turned one.

1941
02:23:15,087 --> 02:23:15,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1942
02:23:15,428 --> 02:23:16,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Big radio baby.

1943
02:23:16,428 --> 02:23:16,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Kira.

1944
02:23:16,808 --> 02:23:17,908
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1945
02:23:18,869 --> 02:23:23,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I guess that person didn't want to call in, so we'll give them another chance later.

1946
02:23:23,331 --> 02:23:25,551
[SPEAKER_21]: But for now, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

1947
02:23:25,672 --> 02:23:28,533
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, now this is the way the FUs of the week is going to work tonight.

1948
02:23:28,593 --> 02:23:33,335
[SPEAKER_21]: If you are on the wrong end of the split, you can send an email with your FUs.

1949
02:23:33,455 --> 02:23:34,175
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's the address.

1950
02:23:34,195 --> 02:23:35,235
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm only going to give it once.

1951
02:23:35,855 --> 02:23:36,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Get a pen and paper ready.

1952
02:23:36,856 --> 02:23:37,016
[SPEAKER_21]: Ready?

1953
02:23:37,036 --> 02:23:37,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Ready?

1954
02:23:38,647 --> 02:23:49,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob, R-O-B, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you have FUs and you can't get them in on the chat room because of the split, send them over email.

1955
02:23:49,833 --> 02:23:52,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Ooh, I did it twice.

1956
02:23:52,254 --> 02:23:52,935
[SPEAKER_21]: I said I only do it once.

1957
02:23:53,015 --> 02:23:53,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1958
02:23:54,315 --> 02:23:54,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1959
02:23:55,216 --> 02:23:56,556
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's get to tonight's FUs.

1960
02:23:56,616 --> 02:23:57,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie's.

1961
02:23:57,357 --> 02:23:59,098
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week?

1962
02:23:59,378 --> 02:24:01,079
[SPEAKER_13]: We're so full of anger.

1963
02:24:16,949 --> 02:24:21,652
[SPEAKER_13]: A big F you goes to my damn nose for being full of snot.

1964
02:24:22,713 --> 02:24:23,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate you allergies.

1965
02:24:23,934 --> 02:24:24,635
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate you.

1966
02:24:25,916 --> 02:24:26,836
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate pollen.

1967
02:24:26,956 --> 02:24:27,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate the trees.

1968
02:24:27,977 --> 02:24:28,818
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate the grass.

1969
02:24:29,458 --> 02:24:30,959
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate the little animals.

1970
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,221
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate anything that's setting off my allergies right now.

1971
02:24:34,402 --> 02:24:35,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I don't hate Shermie though.

1972
02:24:35,582 --> 02:24:36,183
[SPEAKER_13]: She's forgiven.

1973
02:24:36,627 --> 02:24:43,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Shermie is, of course, the official cat of Warner Sounds Radio.

1974
02:24:44,114 --> 02:24:47,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, F you to the H2 for looking stupid.

1975
02:24:48,697 --> 02:24:51,520
[SPEAKER_13]: And F you to the Hummer for being expensive, because I want one.

1976
02:24:54,863 --> 02:25:04,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Another big F you goes toward it being so busy at work because it's hard to talk with my...

1977
02:25:05,587 --> 02:25:10,349
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to it getting hot again.

1978
02:25:10,569 --> 02:25:14,291
[SPEAKER_13]: It was nice and cool for a few days, and then the hot came back.

1979
02:25:14,991 --> 02:25:16,872
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like 97 degrees today, that sucked.

1980
02:25:18,473 --> 02:25:24,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and FU goes toward, uh, shoot, I had another one to name.

1981
02:25:26,256 --> 02:25:28,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, my air conditioning for not working.

1982
02:25:29,337 --> 02:25:30,438
[SPEAKER_13]: And also to, uh,

1983
02:25:33,115 --> 02:25:37,116
[SPEAKER_13]: The repair guy, I don't know if it's the repair guy or my apartment complex manager.

1984
02:25:37,136 --> 02:25:45,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, she's nice and everything, but... The first time the repair guy came in, he just put Freon in it, and it was cool for like three hours.

1985
02:25:45,599 --> 02:25:46,540
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it got hot again.

1986
02:25:48,260 --> 02:25:56,563
[SPEAKER_13]: And I called the apartment manager to have the guy come back and do it again, and I don't think he ever came, so I'm having Dan go talk to her.

1987
02:25:57,023 --> 02:25:59,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan is 6'4", okay?

1988
02:25:59,824 --> 02:26:02,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan is very tall and very large.

1989
02:26:03,379 --> 02:26:05,620
[SPEAKER_13]: And when he asks somebody to do something, usually they will.

1990
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:07,700
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

1991
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Not that you're threatening or anything.

1992
02:26:09,061 --> 02:26:11,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that we're threatening, no.

1993
02:26:12,342 --> 02:26:18,464
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate my nose again, because, like, at least it's not dripping like it was earlier, because it was, like, all day, and I was sneezing all day.

1994
02:26:19,104 --> 02:26:25,606
[SPEAKER_13]: But, like, the left side was all blocked up, and now the right side is, and I, like, want it to make up its mind just not to be blocked up.

1995
02:26:26,146 --> 02:26:28,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, a big F you to Benadryl.

1996
02:26:28,707 --> 02:26:32,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Where Benadryl works, it, like, makes me all, like, goofy.

1997
02:26:33,462 --> 02:26:36,663
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I hate my sentences and everything.

1998
02:26:37,383 --> 02:26:38,303
[SPEAKER_13]: So, that's it.

1999
02:26:39,403 --> 02:26:42,704
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, then, let's move on to Loki and his FUs of the week.

2000
02:26:45,845 --> 02:26:49,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so, my fault, actually.

2001
02:26:49,505 --> 02:26:57,107
[SPEAKER_17]: I bit on the wrong wire, the wrong magnet wire, because I could have gotten this other stuff much cheaper, and it would have been much better for what I'm doing.

2002
02:26:57,947 --> 02:26:59,587
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, so that sucks.

2003
02:27:00,428 --> 02:27:01,768
[SPEAKER_17]: And then also...

2004
02:27:03,018 --> 02:27:05,866
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, really nothing else to be mad about.

2005
02:27:06,768 --> 02:27:08,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Just stupid drivers in general.

2006
02:27:09,415 --> 02:27:09,997
[SPEAKER_17]: People just

2007
02:27:10,990 --> 02:27:11,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

2008
02:27:36,383 --> 02:27:37,484
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like these factors.

2009
02:27:37,664 --> 02:27:40,327
[SPEAKER_17]: I swear, people do not need to be on cell phones while driving.

2010
02:27:40,627 --> 02:27:42,469
[SPEAKER_17]: I never answer my cell phone while driving.

2011
02:27:43,350 --> 02:27:45,051
[SPEAKER_17]: So, that really sucks.

2012
02:27:45,331 --> 02:27:52,798
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, other than that, really not too much else to be mad about.

2013
02:27:53,279 --> 02:27:57,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Other than, um, you know, McDonald's food sucking, but I keep eating it for some reason.

2014
02:27:59,825 --> 02:28:00,105
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all.

2015
02:28:04,403 --> 02:28:04,963
[SPEAKER_19]: My turn.

2016
02:28:06,725 --> 02:28:08,766
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

2017
02:28:10,127 --> 02:28:10,628
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

2018
02:28:18,742 --> 02:28:26,568
[SPEAKER_21]: My FU of the week basically goes to, now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my job, but work on Friday, I just had it.

2019
02:28:27,289 --> 02:28:30,431
[SPEAKER_21]: I reached my breaking point Friday where I was like, Calgon, take me away.

2020
02:28:31,151 --> 02:28:34,214
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not looking forward to next week incredibly much either.

2021
02:28:34,294 --> 02:28:35,334
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'll get over it.

2022
02:28:35,495 --> 02:28:37,496
[SPEAKER_21]: I do love my job and I love the people I work with.

2023
02:28:38,157 --> 02:28:39,838
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just that there's too much drama sometimes.

2024
02:28:39,918 --> 02:28:40,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't deal with it.

2025
02:28:40,778 --> 02:28:41,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Also an FU to The Bart.

2026
02:28:44,693 --> 02:29:10,430
[SPEAKER_21]: The Bay Area Rapid Transit System Because if I want to use my ATM card on BART I have to buy a $20 ticket minimum $20 When it only costs like $8 To get to San Francisco and back Bastards That's highway robbery I'll lose the damn ticket Bastards Alright, let's go to some other FUs From our folks assembled here Starting off with Explicit Uh

2027
02:29:12,956 --> 02:29:14,297
[SPEAKER_21]: 3 hour show buddy, keep it short.

2028
02:29:14,557 --> 02:29:16,437
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I'll keep this one short, okay.

2029
02:29:16,457 --> 02:29:21,559
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, I would like to give an F you to the State Fair for being so damn expensive.

2030
02:29:22,939 --> 02:29:32,823
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, not only have the spot like my friends, you know, I have to be nice to my friends and all, but my wall, my bank's almost depleted just for the State Fair and shit.

2031
02:29:34,143 --> 02:29:36,824
[SPEAKER_26]: F you to Shane for squashing the hell out of my stomach.

2032
02:29:38,125 --> 02:29:41,746
[SPEAKER_26]: I know I ate like funnel cakes before riding on a few rides, but

2033
02:29:42,739 --> 02:29:46,140
[SPEAKER_26]: Squashing me in this one ride in my stomach killed my appetite.

2034
02:29:47,721 --> 02:29:51,303
[SPEAKER_26]: I have not eaten any lunch nor dinner both today and Saturday.

2035
02:29:52,643 --> 02:30:01,827
[SPEAKER_26]: An F you for Scandia for not posting what the hell the rules are for this tournament Tuesday.

2036
02:30:02,628 --> 02:30:03,568
[SPEAKER_26]: Like how the hell are we going to know?

2037
02:30:03,588 --> 02:30:04,769
[SPEAKER_21]: It's whatever they feel like doing.

2038
02:30:05,969 --> 02:30:07,050
[SPEAKER_26]: Who knows what's going to happen?

2039
02:30:07,090 --> 02:30:08,810
[SPEAKER_26]: Would it screw up or would it not screw up?

2040
02:30:10,501 --> 02:30:18,687
[SPEAKER_26]: And F you to the drama about, ooh, sim makers versus actual people who play DDR2 actually hired for the Ultramix game.

2041
02:30:20,248 --> 02:30:20,688
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

2042
02:30:20,908 --> 02:30:25,872
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, like, you know, how some people say, ooh, people get hired for connections and stuff.

2043
02:30:27,633 --> 02:30:30,255
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, like, everyone knows that AJ and Lil B are working at Ultramix.

2044
02:30:30,815 --> 02:30:32,076
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, right, right.

2045
02:30:32,236 --> 02:30:34,277
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people are starting drama towards it.

2046
02:30:34,578 --> 02:30:35,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's this drama at?

2047
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:38,040
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it was...

2048
02:30:38,550 --> 02:30:41,952
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it was in AaronInJapan.com, I'm not... Interesting.

2049
02:30:42,873 --> 02:30:46,615
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not F-U-ing Scandi, I'm just F-U-ing some of the people who did not post the rules.

2050
02:30:49,256 --> 02:30:50,957
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, Scandi has a broken pad.

2051
02:30:50,997 --> 02:30:54,539
[SPEAKER_26]: If they don't fix the pad before the tournament, then how are you going to have a fair tournament, basically?

2052
02:30:54,699 --> 02:30:58,662
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, in regards to your other F-U, I think people need to withhold judgment until the game comes out.

2053
02:30:59,466 --> 02:30:59,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2054
02:31:00,006 --> 02:31:08,570
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think no matter what happens, no matter who did the steps, if God himself came down from the heavens and wrote the steps to the next mix, somebody out there would say they sucked.

2055
02:31:08,810 --> 02:31:10,210
[SPEAKER_21]: There is no pleasing everybody.

2056
02:31:10,230 --> 02:31:11,471
[SPEAKER_21]: You're just going to have to deal with it.

2057
02:31:11,591 --> 02:31:11,951
[SPEAKER_26]: I know.

2058
02:31:12,011 --> 02:31:12,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly.

2059
02:31:14,092 --> 02:31:26,317
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, people just cut it out, wait till the game comes, wait till Ultramix 2 comes out, and then just from there, it goes, if it's shitty or not, or if it's good as hell or not.

2060
02:31:26,577 --> 02:31:29,038
[SPEAKER_21]: From what I've heard of Ultramix 2 so far...

2061
02:31:30,615 --> 02:31:31,896
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are going to be very surprised.

2062
02:31:31,936 --> 02:31:36,419
[SPEAKER_21]: Some folks that are all anti-Xbox and stuff, you're going to be hopping on the Xbox train soon enough.

2063
02:31:36,779 --> 02:31:38,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Ultramix 2 is going to be very, very good.

2064
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,261
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I have to say.

2065
02:31:40,521 --> 02:31:42,623
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll see first when the game comes out.

2066
02:31:43,603 --> 02:31:48,646
[SPEAKER_21]: I... I can't say why I'm saying it, but just, it's going to be great.

2067
02:31:49,227 --> 02:31:49,507
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

2068
02:31:51,124 --> 02:31:54,847
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see.

2069
02:31:54,887 --> 02:31:57,508
[SPEAKER_26]: And FU2 School, some of the teachers in school.

2070
02:31:58,749 --> 02:31:59,310
[SPEAKER_26]: Ah, nope.

2071
02:31:59,810 --> 02:32:01,591
[SPEAKER_26]: Ah, that's going to be too long for the FUs.

2072
02:32:02,772 --> 02:32:03,893
[SPEAKER_26]: So let it speak for itself.

2073
02:32:04,153 --> 02:32:04,493
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

2074
02:32:05,174 --> 02:32:05,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel.

2075
02:32:06,074 --> 02:32:11,218
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here is my comedy for the FUs, if you want to laugh at it or not, Rob.

2076
02:32:12,499 --> 02:32:16,341
[SPEAKER_11]: FU2 Ants Trying to Attack You When You're Trying to Get a Good Night's Sleep.

2077
02:32:16,982 --> 02:32:17,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Ew.

2078
02:32:17,342 --> 02:32:17,402
[SPEAKER_19]: Ew.

2079
02:32:17,814 --> 02:32:19,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know, it's not good.

2080
02:32:19,836 --> 02:32:22,799
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when you're trying to sleep, you have nightmares of them trying to kill you.

2081
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:23,640
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah.

2082
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:25,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, doesn't that suck?

2083
02:32:25,081 --> 02:32:27,023
[SPEAKER_22]: Like big giant ants, or red ants, or what?

2084
02:32:27,383 --> 02:32:30,887
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, they're regular house ants, but it's just like, it's annoying as hell.

2085
02:32:31,167 --> 02:32:31,948
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

2086
02:32:32,408 --> 02:32:33,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, black ants.

2087
02:32:34,490 --> 02:32:36,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Little sweet ants, or whatever you want to call them.

2088
02:32:36,832 --> 02:32:41,797
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, like, even though you spray around the house, like, not even a week later, they'll come back.

2089
02:32:43,004 --> 02:32:46,226
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when you try to squish them, they start walking after you squish them.

2090
02:32:46,246 --> 02:32:48,127
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to like squish them multiple times.

2091
02:32:48,187 --> 02:32:48,948
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really annoying.

2092
02:32:49,508 --> 02:32:50,248
[SPEAKER_11]: So F you to that.

2093
02:32:50,849 --> 02:32:58,934
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also, to add to Loki's F you, F you to stupid drivers that try to clip you when you're just, you know, minding your own business in your own lane.

2094
02:32:59,714 --> 02:33:02,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I almost got killed going to Walmart.

2095
02:33:03,076 --> 02:33:04,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we had to get some stuff or whatever.

2096
02:33:05,017 --> 02:33:06,298
[SPEAKER_11]: But that really sucked.

2097
02:33:06,758 --> 02:33:08,179
[SPEAKER_11]: So I almost died today.

2098
02:33:08,439 --> 02:33:09,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Or not today, but this week.

2099
02:33:10,261 --> 02:33:10,761
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not good.

2100
02:33:11,061 --> 02:33:11,541
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not.

2101
02:33:12,262 --> 02:33:12,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

2102
02:33:14,815 --> 02:33:19,378
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me add that to the female drivers of referring to what Loki said.

2103
02:33:19,398 --> 02:33:23,701
[SPEAKER_26]: After you did this one lady, you threw a fucking soda can on my windshield.

2104
02:33:24,101 --> 02:33:24,461
[SPEAKER_29]: What?

2105
02:33:25,322 --> 02:33:26,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I was like, ooh, he cut me off.

2106
02:33:27,103 --> 02:33:29,384
[SPEAKER_26]: Ooh, let's throw a windshield on my windshield.

2107
02:33:29,404 --> 02:33:31,305
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's throw a soda bottle on my windshield.

2108
02:33:31,365 --> 02:33:32,026
[SPEAKER_26]: Interesting.

2109
02:33:32,886 --> 02:33:33,267
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2110
02:33:33,687 --> 02:33:33,907
[SPEAKER_26]: Huh.

2111
02:33:34,884 --> 02:33:39,213
[SPEAKER_26]: Luckily it didn't hit any of my paint or else I would really go after that son of a bitch.

2112
02:33:39,293 --> 02:33:40,095
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna rant her over.

2113
02:33:41,558 --> 02:33:45,165
[SPEAKER_26]: And F you too, there was some girls flicking us off in the...

2114
02:33:47,009 --> 02:33:48,690
[SPEAKER_26]: and the Ferris Wheel.

2115
02:33:48,910 --> 02:33:50,231
[SPEAKER_26]: What the hell did we do?

2116
02:33:50,451 --> 02:33:51,751
[SPEAKER_26]: We just flipped us off out of nowhere.

2117
02:33:51,911 --> 02:33:53,232
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have flipped him off back.

2118
02:33:53,292 --> 02:33:55,433
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have flashed my penis.

2119
02:33:55,673 --> 02:33:56,714
[SPEAKER_20]: But anyway.

2120
02:33:56,974 --> 02:33:57,954
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I mooned him, so.

2121
02:33:58,054 --> 02:33:58,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that works.

2122
02:34:00,155 --> 02:34:02,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, even though they don't deserve to taste some of that.

2123
02:34:03,477 --> 02:34:06,478
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, let's move on and see what Arcadian has to say.

2124
02:34:06,538 --> 02:34:07,319
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we done, Angel?

2125
02:34:08,179 --> 02:34:08,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

2126
02:34:10,040 --> 02:34:11,561
[SPEAKER_11]: If I think of my last one, it's all good.

2127
02:34:11,581 --> 02:34:14,942
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, Arcadian.

2128
02:34:14,962 --> 02:34:16,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you, the heat's coming back.

2129
02:34:17,049 --> 02:34:20,431
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you to TreeSap for still getting on my car, especially because of the damn heat.

2130
02:34:22,172 --> 02:34:38,620
[SPEAKER_24]: And even, and fuck you to the people, the, the, by the, like the rental place or whatever it is that rents out the place that my company works at for choosing these shitty trees that actually drop this stuff all over cars in the winter, in the summer.

2131
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:43,362
[SPEAKER_24]: You better search the damn things and find one that don't drop that shit on you.

2132
02:34:44,788 --> 02:34:49,549
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, fuck you to traffic that comes up like 8.30 a.m.

2133
02:34:49,569 --> 02:34:52,390
[SPEAKER_24]: Damn it, you're supposed to be at work already!

2134
02:34:54,090 --> 02:34:56,451
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want this fucking traffic when I'm coming to work late.

2135
02:34:57,111 --> 02:34:59,511
[SPEAKER_24]: But what's cool about my work, I can actually come in late.

2136
02:34:59,651 --> 02:35:01,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, why don't you start coming in later?

2137
02:35:01,572 --> 02:35:03,972
[SPEAKER_24]: Because now that I'm an employee, I can actually be there late.

2138
02:35:05,913 --> 02:35:11,294
[SPEAKER_24]: And also, fuck you to my fucked up sleep schedule and my damn body for fucking waking me up

2139
02:35:11,803 --> 02:35:12,904
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometimes, like, at 5 a.m.

2140
02:35:12,924 --> 02:35:19,590
[SPEAKER_24]: in the morning, get to sleep at, like, between 12 and 1, and then for some fucking reason I wake up, like, 5 or 6 a.m.

2141
02:35:19,630 --> 02:35:20,231
[SPEAKER_24]: in the morning.

2142
02:35:21,832 --> 02:35:22,893
[SPEAKER_24]: It was really weird.

2143
02:35:22,913 --> 02:35:29,279
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, last Monday I slept for, like, 7 hours and I was, like, dead all day.

2144
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:35,725
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the next few days I wake up, like, after 4 or 5 hours of sleep and then actually awake for half the day.

2145
02:35:37,627 --> 02:35:37,707
[SPEAKER_24]: And...

2146
02:35:38,476 --> 02:35:43,879
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2147
02:36:10,538 --> 02:36:14,221
[SPEAKER_13]: I was commenting on them doing the every little thing, and Bush blew his nose today.

2148
02:36:15,042 --> 02:36:20,126
[SPEAKER_13]: We have reported this on CNN, PSNBC, and the Discovery Channel.

2149
02:36:21,247 --> 02:36:22,988
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, looks like our net split is fixed.

2150
02:36:23,048 --> 02:36:26,691
[SPEAKER_22]: However, if you submitted the FU over email, do not send it again.

2151
02:36:27,072 --> 02:36:28,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2152
02:36:28,333 --> 02:36:33,137
[SPEAKER_21]: Flaronay also says, FU to Zim for breaking the Scandia DDR machine in Santa Rosa.

2153
02:36:33,657 --> 02:36:34,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Make that Rohnert Park.

2154
02:36:36,860 --> 02:36:38,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Angel's freaking out because that's where she's from.

2155
02:36:40,427 --> 02:36:40,847
[SPEAKER_11]: You suck!

2156
02:36:41,328 --> 02:36:44,669
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, you suck, but, um, I don't live there anymore, so, ha ha!

2157
02:36:45,970 --> 02:36:50,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to having to wash pots in a summer camp this summer.

2158
02:36:50,753 --> 02:36:52,834
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to the fact that I start school tomorrow.

2159
02:36:53,355 --> 02:36:55,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, ouch, I could have a lot of people start school tomorrow.

2160
02:36:55,136 --> 02:36:55,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, guys.

2161
02:36:56,176 --> 02:37:04,181
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, F you to President Bush for exploiting 9-11 for another four years in office, hence picking New York City as the location for the Republican National Convention.

2162
02:37:04,201 --> 02:37:08,944
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to the hip-hop being the dominating force in this year's VMAs and in mainstream music in general.

2163
02:37:10,040 --> 02:37:10,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you get my FU?

2164
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:11,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I did.

2165
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:16,422
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah, we said... Yeah, fuck you to the video music and we'll... Oh, yes, I have to spoil those, don't I?

2166
02:37:16,582 --> 02:37:16,982
[SPEAKER_21]: My bad.

2167
02:37:17,162 --> 02:37:17,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on.

2168
02:37:17,522 --> 02:37:20,263
[SPEAKER_24]: Who fucking wants to know?

2169
02:37:20,283 --> 02:37:21,203
[SPEAKER_21]: It's all stupid crap.

2170
02:37:21,283 --> 02:37:26,505
[SPEAKER_21]: I know it is, but I... I want to spoil it for those people that were thinking about going to watch it.

2171
02:37:27,345 --> 02:37:33,066
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, good.

2172
02:37:33,106 --> 02:37:34,387
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll get to it, you guys.

2173
02:37:34,627 --> 02:37:35,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Here, let's see.

2174
02:37:35,487 --> 02:37:37,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Um... Da-da-da-da-da.

2175
02:37:37,788 --> 02:37:38,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Where's the winners list here?

2176
02:37:40,670 --> 02:37:47,636
[SPEAKER_21]: Video of the Year was OutKast, Hey Ya, which also won the award for most overplayed song of the year.

2177
02:37:47,756 --> 02:37:48,997
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh wait, no, that was me.

2178
02:37:49,697 --> 02:37:53,000
[SPEAKER_21]: And Best Male Video, Usher, big surprise.

2179
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,342

02:37:55,382 --> 02:37:56,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Best Group Video, No Doubt.

2181
02:37:56,663 --> 02:37:57,003
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

2182
02:37:57,323 --> 02:37:58,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Now you don't have to watch.

2183
02:37:59,044 --> 02:38:00,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay, you don't have to watch.

2184
02:38:00,305 --> 02:38:01,366
[SPEAKER_21]: A public service announcement.

2185
02:38:01,386 --> 02:38:06,330
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't have to watch one of the 500 million trillion, six billion repeats that they play every fucking day.

2186
02:38:06,991 --> 02:38:07,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2187
02:38:07,811 --> 02:38:09,092
[SPEAKER_21]: El Mullet would like to say, F you.

2188
02:38:09,112 --> 02:38:09,933
[SPEAKER_31]: I have nothing original.

2189
02:38:10,712 --> 02:38:18,117
[SPEAKER_21]: HellMullet would like to say F you to the Japanese DDR elitists who have no idea what they're talking about and an F you to my college classes that start tomorrow.

2190
02:38:19,138 --> 02:38:23,300
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkKnight says an F you for not having a car and an F you for not thinking of another F you.

2191
02:38:24,461 --> 02:38:28,564
[SPEAKER_21]: BlackDevil says F you to my iTunes radio connection when I was calling over Skype.

2192
02:38:28,924 --> 02:38:30,946
[SPEAKER_21]: I heard an echo of my voice and your voice.

2193
02:38:31,326 --> 02:38:34,008
[SPEAKER_21]: It was like six voices in my head and it was hard to concentrate.

2194
02:38:34,768 --> 02:38:36,049
[SPEAKER_21]: Turn down the volume next time you call in.

2195
02:38:36,932 --> 02:38:41,776
[SPEAKER_21]: Misty says, F me, because while I did find my karaoke revolution mic, I think it's broken.

2196
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:46,920
[SPEAKER_21]: And in a lesser F you to me for not getting off my ass and driving, I could have kicked some ass in a DDR tournament this weekend.

2197
02:38:48,502 --> 02:38:53,986
[SPEAKER_21]: And VXJasonXV says, F you number one to Other Side IRC, why are you unstable at the moment?

2198
02:38:54,567 --> 02:38:58,990
[SPEAKER_21]: F you number two from all of us at Orange Lounge Radio and then some, F you to Newt.

2199
02:39:00,011 --> 02:39:02,713
[SPEAKER_21]: And F you number three, F you to NetSplits in general.

2200
02:39:04,875 --> 02:39:05,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2201
02:39:06,354 --> 02:39:11,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Now let's take a look at the FUs that came in over email, because I promised that I would read the ones on email.

2202
02:39:12,138 --> 02:39:26,309
[SPEAKER_21]: I apologize if I mispronounce this name, because it has an extra E from what I'm used to, but it looks like Renee says, FU to Japanese hentai censorship, and at myself for probably setting a record kick action to myself so fast for a first-time user.

2203
02:39:26,749 --> 02:39:27,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's okay.

2204
02:39:28,190 --> 02:39:28,831
[SPEAKER_21]: You live, you learn.

2205
02:39:29,577 --> 02:39:31,558
[SPEAKER_21]: As long as you're being good now, that's the important point.

2206
02:39:32,038 --> 02:39:35,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, Zeno would like to say, F you, damn IRC network splits.

2207
02:39:35,719 --> 02:39:36,819
[SPEAKER_21]: That and fractions.

2208
02:39:37,279 --> 02:39:38,280
[SPEAKER_21]: Numbers of the devil.

2209
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:41,401
[SPEAKER_21]: And this weird cut on my hand that doesn't want to heal.

2210
02:39:43,821 --> 02:39:55,265
[SPEAKER_21]: And lastly, uh, I don't have an alias for this guy, I only got the full name here, so we'll call him Robert B. Robert B says, a big F you to dial up for being so shitty, and another F you to me for not getting cable.

2211
02:39:55,465 --> 02:39:55,825
[SPEAKER_24]: Frown.

2212
02:39:56,886 --> 02:39:57,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Fractions?

2213
02:39:57,366 --> 02:39:58,066
[SPEAKER_21]: The number of the devil?

2214
02:39:58,444 --> 02:39:59,845
[SPEAKER_24]: but call me the devil's friend.

2215
02:40:00,146 --> 02:40:03,028
[SPEAKER_21]: Weren't you a math major or something?

2216
02:40:03,188 --> 02:40:03,509
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2217
02:40:04,670 --> 02:40:05,170
[SPEAKER_21]: I see how it is.

2218
02:40:05,190 --> 02:40:07,773
[SPEAKER_21]: You're in cahoots with the devil.

2219
02:40:10,175 --> 02:40:11,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Now even I'm scared.

2220
02:40:11,216 --> 02:40:11,556
[SPEAKER_21]: Yikes.

2221
02:40:12,277 --> 02:40:12,597
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2222
02:40:14,168 --> 02:40:18,690
[SPEAKER_21]: I think what we'll do is we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from a break, we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

2223
02:40:19,090 --> 02:40:26,753
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, but first, I wanted to mention some more Bomani news going on, because, you know, there was other news that happened this week, besides the Extreme Unlocks being revealed.

2224
02:40:27,193 --> 02:40:35,316
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a preview movie for Dancing Stage Fever that came out, and you can actually see a link to this video right on our website at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2225
02:40:35,336 --> 02:40:36,437
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about the fifth story down.

2226
02:40:37,777 --> 02:40:43,878
[SPEAKER_21]: What this video showed, it was very interesting, it showed some of the song banners and stuff, but it also had karaoke lyrics.

2227
02:40:44,439 --> 02:40:52,421
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, granted, it's the Europe version of DDR, not the USA version of DDR, but, hmm, typically they use very similar engines.

2228
02:40:53,081 --> 02:40:57,722
[SPEAKER_21]: So, hmm, you kind of wonder, is karaoke lyrics something that's coming?

2229
02:40:58,422 --> 02:40:58,982
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2230
02:40:59,522 --> 02:41:02,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Especially with the Karaoke Revolution crossovers, it would make a lot of sense, but,

2231
02:41:03,703 --> 02:41:09,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Despite that, if you do live in Europe and you have access to dancing stage games, then...

2232
02:41:10,908 --> 02:41:14,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, there you go, you get karaoke lyrics, and you get a really good song list, by the way.

2233
02:41:14,489 --> 02:41:15,829
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys get an awesome song list.

2234
02:41:17,310 --> 02:41:21,151
[SPEAKER_21]: And DDR Festival was confirmed by Konami.

2235
02:41:21,231 --> 02:41:25,552
[SPEAKER_21]: It is coming, it does support the iToy, and it's coming November 18th.

2236
02:41:25,892 --> 02:41:27,273
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to know why it's confirmed?

2237
02:41:27,613 --> 02:41:33,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they set up a website for it, and you can see this link right there on our website, orangeloungeradio.com.

2238
02:41:33,735 --> 02:41:35,355
[SPEAKER_21]: It's right there on our front page.

2239
02:41:36,095 --> 02:41:36,595
[SPEAKER_21]: All righty?

2240
02:41:38,036 --> 02:41:38,296
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2241
02:41:40,063 --> 02:41:42,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Oops, it was Dancing Stage Fusion, not Fever.

2242
02:41:42,604 --> 02:41:43,125
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know why.

2243
02:41:43,465 --> 02:41:44,685
[SPEAKER_21]: It says in the headline, Fever.

2244
02:41:44,745 --> 02:41:45,466
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got to fix that.

2245
02:41:45,546 --> 02:41:46,366
[SPEAKER_21]: It's actually Fusion.

2246
02:41:46,967 --> 02:41:47,447
[SPEAKER_29]: Our bad.

2247
02:41:47,947 --> 02:41:48,347
[SPEAKER_22]: Our bad.

2248
02:41:50,708 --> 02:41:51,009
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2249
02:41:53,590 --> 02:41:56,651
[SPEAKER_21]: We will be right back after this break.

2250
02:41:56,711 --> 02:41:59,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie wanted more 5-key, so I said sure.

2251
02:41:59,593 --> 02:42:02,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Because she wanted to hear more Rugged Ash.

2252
02:42:03,095 --> 02:42:03,795
[SPEAKER_21]: So why not?

2253
02:42:03,835 --> 02:42:04,896
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do some Rugged Ash.

2254
02:42:05,116 --> 02:42:06,216
[SPEAKER_21]: Rugged Ash is fun to play.

2255
02:42:06,316 --> 02:42:09,758
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll do Logical Dash and The Fall.

2256
02:42:10,489 --> 02:42:11,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Fall Another Hey, do you have Believe Again?

2257
02:42:11,710 --> 02:42:12,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Or Beginning of Life?

2258
02:42:12,931 --> 02:42:14,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, Angel Alright, so four names

2259
02:42:31,738 --> 02:42:34,600
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I did, it was not Renee, it was Rini.

2260
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:42,045
[SPEAKER_21]: But I didn't think that was right, because that would be too obvious, and usually people's names aren't quite as obvious unless you're named Rob, like me.

2261
02:42:42,485 --> 02:42:43,026
[SPEAKER_21]: It was Rini.

2262
02:42:43,146 --> 02:42:44,046
[SPEAKER_21]: My bad, my bad.

2263
02:42:45,427 --> 02:42:47,909
[SPEAKER_21]: You try doing a radio show and pronouncing everything right, alright?

2264
02:42:48,369 --> 02:42:49,530
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be back after this break.

2265
02:44:06,053 --> 02:44:11,475
[SPEAKER_23]: Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.

2266
02:44:12,056 --> 02:44:14,397
[SPEAKER_23]: The first crash happened in Bukovka.

2267
02:44:52,928 --> 02:44:53,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2268
02:47:06,952 --> 02:47:08,273
Thank you for watching!

2269
02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:41,941
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

2270
02:48:41,981 --> 02:48:48,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

2271
02:48:49,803 --> 02:48:55,884
[SPEAKER_21]: We are back, and I thought since we have a little bit of show left, maybe we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2272
02:48:55,944 --> 02:49:02,346
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can actually send a question over private message right now to Sky, and we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

2273
02:49:02,406 --> 02:49:03,046
[SPEAKER_21]: But first...

2274
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:03,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Cry, cry

2275
02:49:34,483 --> 02:49:36,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Zaku's calling us again, what's up?

2276
02:49:39,286 --> 02:49:39,626
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up?

2277
02:49:41,787 --> 02:49:48,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and go because our connection is a little messed up, but I'm gonna answer that for you, okay?

2278
02:50:00,239 --> 02:50:01,380
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, keep listening.

2279
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:04,482
[SPEAKER_21]: How do you make the jump from 5 key to 7 key?

2280
02:50:04,742 --> 02:50:07,444
[SPEAKER_21]: But before we answer the question, I have to do the theme music.

2281
02:50:15,230 --> 02:50:18,132
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2282
02:50:18,652 --> 02:50:21,914
[SPEAKER_21]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2283
02:50:22,615 --> 02:50:29,560
[SPEAKER_21]: When we use the Skype line, random people call in, but I sure hope that one guy doesn't call us anymore, and I hope he got a live...

2284
02:50:32,243 --> 02:50:35,144
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm not going to wish for things that won't happen.

2285
02:50:35,605 --> 02:50:35,865
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2286
02:50:36,865 --> 02:50:39,106
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, let's go back to people we do like to hear from.

2287
02:50:39,166 --> 02:50:41,928
[SPEAKER_21]: Zaku, how do you make the jump from 5Key to 7Key?

2288
02:50:44,958 --> 02:50:45,638
[SPEAKER_10]: You just do it.

2289
02:50:46,098 --> 02:50:48,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, honestly, you just have to do it.

2290
02:50:49,159 --> 02:50:54,561
[SPEAKER_21]: My advice, honestly, when you play 2DX, don't play 5-key, ever.

2291
02:50:54,901 --> 02:50:56,341
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you'll just be kind of ruining it.

2292
02:50:56,661 --> 02:51:00,323
[SPEAKER_21]: But here's the thing, start on light 7, use beginner mode if you can.

2293
02:51:01,263 --> 02:51:03,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Just whatever it does to ease you into the 7-keys.

2294
02:51:04,164 --> 02:51:08,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because you can do a 4-star on 5-key, it doesn't mean you can do a 4-star on 7-key.

2295
02:51:08,565 --> 02:51:10,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Adding those two extra buttons will do so much.

2296
02:51:10,806 --> 02:51:11,806
[SPEAKER_21]: So just go back to the 1s.

2297
02:51:12,486 --> 02:51:14,048
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's really the only way you can do it.

2298
02:51:14,608 --> 02:51:18,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Put your turntable on the same side that you had it in five key games if you're playing from there.

2299
02:51:19,614 --> 02:51:20,915
[SPEAKER_21]: If that helps you, I don't know.

2300
02:51:21,636 --> 02:51:24,018
[SPEAKER_21]: Otherwise, you just have to practice.

2301
02:51:24,839 --> 02:51:26,120
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no magic way to do it.

2302
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:27,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Learn how to pinky scratch.

2303
02:51:28,531 --> 02:51:29,091
[SPEAKER_21]: Drill mode.

2304
02:51:29,251 --> 02:51:34,856
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have 6th or 7th style, or I'm sorry, 5th or 6th style, and I think it was in 7th too, use drill mode.

2305
02:51:35,256 --> 02:51:38,078
[SPEAKER_21]: It really, really helps and it teaches you a lot of the tricks.

2306
02:51:38,118 --> 02:51:41,521
[SPEAKER_21]: It can be a little repetitive at first, but it really, really helps.

2307
02:51:41,942 --> 02:51:44,504
[SPEAKER_21]: So do yourself a favor and try that.

2308
02:51:44,964 --> 02:51:45,224
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay?

2309
02:51:46,045 --> 02:51:50,148
[SPEAKER_13]: You might want to also, when I first started doing it, I had to learn to recenter my hands.

2310
02:51:51,730 --> 02:51:56,714
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people will do 5 to 5 keys and then use 2 to the other.

2311
02:51:57,365 --> 02:51:58,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2312
02:52:14,867 --> 02:52:16,288
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, moving on.

2313
02:52:16,428 --> 02:52:19,810
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to take some questions that came in from the chat room.

2314
02:52:21,471 --> 02:52:24,072
[SPEAKER_21]: Including, Puppy has a question for us.

2315
02:52:24,432 --> 02:52:27,914
[SPEAKER_21]: Puppy wants to know, when are we going to go out and have boba with him again?

2316
02:52:30,576 --> 02:52:31,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Whenever I can cheat.

2317
02:52:33,337 --> 02:52:34,618
[SPEAKER_13]: When you buy me my Humvee.

2318
02:52:37,880 --> 02:52:40,361
[SPEAKER_21]: I do think a boba trip is in order, I just don't know when yet.

2319
02:52:40,522 --> 02:52:40,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry guys.

2320
02:52:42,583 --> 02:52:43,123
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know when yet.

2321
02:52:44,293 --> 02:52:45,394
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been kind of busy lately.

2322
02:52:46,374 --> 02:52:53,377
[SPEAKER_21]: We do have a three-day weekend coming up, but I promise, promise, promise a special somebody that I would go to the club with him Sunday night after the show next week.

2323
02:52:53,618 --> 02:52:54,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2324
02:52:55,218 --> 02:52:55,959
[SPEAKER_21]: But maybe next time.

2325
02:52:56,479 --> 02:52:56,819
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

2326
02:52:57,399 --> 02:52:59,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Certainly by the next time VXChase and XV visits.

2327
02:52:59,961 --> 02:53:00,521
[SPEAKER_22]: That's for sure.

2328
02:53:02,242 --> 02:53:03,943
[SPEAKER_21]: Zaku wants to submit another question.

2329
02:53:03,983 --> 02:53:05,483
[SPEAKER_21]: Skyplane's open too if you want to call in.

2330
02:53:06,864 --> 02:53:09,085
[SPEAKER_21]: What was the worst summer job you ever had?

2331
02:53:11,506 --> 02:53:13,247
[SPEAKER_13]: I worked at a grocery store for a week.

2332
02:53:14,830 --> 02:53:16,871
[SPEAKER_13]: It was supposed to be my first job.

2333
02:53:17,112 --> 02:53:18,953
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to work at the grocery store.

2334
02:53:19,013 --> 02:53:27,798
[SPEAKER_13]: I had been offered a job at the game room during orientation at my college, but I wasn't actually a student yet, so to earn some money over the summer, I was going to work at a grocery store.

2335
02:53:28,579 --> 02:53:36,724
[SPEAKER_13]: And it turned out that they were... If I was supposed to get off at like 9, I didn't get off work until midnight.

2336
02:53:36,744 --> 02:53:39,706
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, excuse me, screw this, so...

2337
02:53:40,612 --> 02:53:44,755
[SPEAKER_13]: I quit, took my last paycheck, and then like two weeks later I was working on campus.

2338
02:53:45,616 --> 02:53:47,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we're going to go to the Skype line.

2339
02:53:47,717 --> 02:53:48,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Siggy's on the Skype line.

2340
02:53:48,678 --> 02:53:49,018
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up?

2341
02:53:49,618 --> 02:53:50,639
[SPEAKER_31]: Hello, Sky.

2342
02:53:50,959 --> 02:53:51,700
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, how you doing?

2343
02:53:52,398 --> 02:53:55,039
[SPEAKER_31]: Are we still in the Ask Orange Slown segment yet?

2344
02:53:55,199 --> 02:53:55,979
[SPEAKER_21]: You sure can.

2345
02:53:56,559 --> 02:54:00,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to share one thing real fast, though, to answer Zaku's question about the worst summer job.

2346
02:54:01,581 --> 02:54:08,603
[SPEAKER_21]: I once worked at a video store, and we happened to rent pornography, and one of my friends from childhood, his dad came in to rent a porno once.

2347
02:54:08,623 --> 02:54:10,283
[SPEAKER_21]: That was really awkward.

2348
02:54:10,604 --> 02:54:11,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

2349
02:54:11,504 --> 02:54:12,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, you had a question, Siggy.

2350
02:54:13,164 --> 02:54:15,485
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, here's just a simple question.

2351
02:54:15,785 --> 02:54:18,526
[SPEAKER_31]: Didn't you get my instant message over the forums lately?

2352
02:54:20,061 --> 02:54:21,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yes, about Poppin' Music 12.

2353
02:54:21,763 --> 02:54:22,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I did.

2354
02:54:23,224 --> 02:54:25,466
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I was just wondering.

2355
02:54:25,686 --> 02:54:27,027
[SPEAKER_21]: You want us to whore out Poppin' Music 12.

2356
02:54:27,107 --> 02:54:27,888
[SPEAKER_21]: We can do that.

2357
02:54:28,349 --> 02:54:28,609
[SPEAKER_31]: Yep.

2358
02:54:29,229 --> 02:54:31,772
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, we'll talk Poppin' Music 12 just for you, Siggy.

2359
02:54:32,272 --> 02:54:33,994
[SPEAKER_31]: Just after this.

2360
02:54:34,534 --> 02:54:34,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2361
02:54:34,834 --> 02:54:35,615
[SPEAKER_31]: After this segment.

2362
02:54:35,975 --> 02:54:39,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we don't have much time left in the show, so we'll probably get to that and finish out the show here.

2363
02:54:40,159 --> 02:54:42,521
[SPEAKER_31]: Just finish this right now.

2364
02:54:42,761 --> 02:54:43,122
[SPEAKER_21]: All righty.

2365
02:54:43,642 --> 02:54:45,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for the reminder.

2366
02:54:45,544 --> 02:54:45,784
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

2367
02:54:45,884 --> 02:54:46,304
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, later.

2368
02:54:46,745 --> 02:54:46,865
[SPEAKER_31]: Later.

2369
02:54:46,885 --> 02:54:46,985
[SPEAKER_31]: Later.

2370
02:54:49,586 --> 02:54:50,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I did want to get to that.

2371
02:54:50,686 --> 02:54:55,387
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkLine had sent us a message over the forums.

2372
02:54:55,427 --> 02:54:56,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me go grab that right now.

2373
02:54:57,848 --> 02:55:02,829
[SPEAKER_21]: We actually have to wrap up the show, so I just want to do a few more news items, and then we'll finish up here.

2374
02:55:04,089 --> 02:55:04,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me see.

2375
02:55:04,509 --> 02:55:05,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me get in there.

2376
02:55:05,690 --> 02:55:11,371
[SPEAKER_21]: We did briefly mention it in one of our other news articles, but Poppin' Music 12 is location testing right now.

2377
02:55:11,431 --> 02:55:13,151
[SPEAKER_21]: That's really high for a Bomani game.

2378
02:55:13,171 --> 02:55:15,112
[SPEAKER_21]: 12 Mix or whatever, but they don't call it Mix.

2379
02:55:15,172 --> 02:55:15,672
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just Poppin' 12.

2380
02:55:16,372 --> 02:55:18,434
[SPEAKER_21]: It has a bunch of new licenses in it.

2381
02:55:18,454 --> 02:55:21,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, not a bunch, but at least three that have been announced so far.

2382
02:55:22,317 --> 02:55:24,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Cruel Angels Thesis is one of them.

2383
02:55:24,679 --> 02:55:26,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, that's like the Evangelion theme.

2384
02:55:26,981 --> 02:55:27,522
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

2385
02:55:27,622 --> 02:55:29,423
[SPEAKER_21]: So tons of people are going to love that.

2386
02:55:29,804 --> 02:55:31,926
[SPEAKER_21]: And then some new Konami originals as well.

2387
02:55:31,966 --> 02:55:33,247
[SPEAKER_21]: I see the Parkettes are in there.

2388
02:55:33,587 --> 02:55:37,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Jimmy Weckl has one, and D.Crew has a song.

2389
02:55:37,669 --> 02:55:38,990
[SPEAKER_21]: You can head over to Bomani Style.

2390
02:55:39,030 --> 02:55:40,991
[SPEAKER_21]: They actually posted about this a couple days ago.

2391
02:55:41,372 --> 02:55:46,314
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd feel a little weird just copying and pasting what they wrote, so honestly, just head over to Bomani Style.

2392
02:55:46,334 --> 02:55:47,335
[SPEAKER_21]: They've got all the news on it.

2393
02:55:48,115 --> 02:55:52,998
[SPEAKER_21]: They also have screenshots, and it looks like they're kind of... You know how the recent pop-up musics, they've kind of had a theme?

2394
02:55:53,338 --> 02:55:57,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, Pop-Up Music 11 was like world travel, was kind of what that was all about?

2395
02:55:57,621 --> 02:56:00,863
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like Pop-Up Music 12's theme is traditional Japan.

2396
02:56:01,963 --> 02:56:02,203
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool.

2397
02:56:02,223 --> 02:56:11,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you notice that the mascots are wearing the kind of kimono and all the artwork looks, for lack of a better word, looks a little chinky.

2398
02:56:13,486 --> 02:56:14,807
[SPEAKER_21]: That's basically what it's about.

2399
02:56:16,447 --> 02:56:24,670
[SPEAKER_21]: PopMesa 12, we will definitely, when we find out more information about it, we will post it on over to our website over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2400
02:56:25,530 --> 02:56:25,850
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2401
02:56:27,327 --> 02:56:28,087
[SPEAKER_21]: What else was news?

2402
02:56:28,348 --> 02:56:29,008
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I know.

2403
02:56:29,429 --> 02:56:33,933
[SPEAKER_21]: Not necessarily a Bomani game, but you know Taiko No Tatooine, right?

2404
02:56:33,973 --> 02:56:34,574
[SPEAKER_21]: You know that game.

2405
02:56:34,794 --> 02:56:35,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

2406
02:56:35,875 --> 02:56:39,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know it's coming to the U.S., and it's going to be called Taiko Drum Master here in the U.S.

2407
02:56:40,420 --> 02:56:41,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Close enough name.

2408
02:56:41,241 --> 02:56:42,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, guess what?

2409
02:56:43,163 --> 02:56:49,129
[SPEAKER_21]: The song list has been announced for Taiko Drum Master, and there's some very interesting stuff in it.

2410
02:56:50,357 --> 02:56:52,898
[SPEAKER_21]: Like to be expected, you have your classical songs.

2411
02:56:52,938 --> 02:56:55,600
[SPEAKER_21]: You have your Beethoven Symphony No.

2412
02:56:55,620 --> 02:56:59,401
[SPEAKER_21]: 5, Carmen, William Tell Overture, Hungarian Dances No.

2413
02:56:59,541 --> 02:56:59,401
5.

2414
02:56:59,561 --> 02:57:00,382
[SPEAKER_21]: You have all that stuff.

2415
02:57:01,102 --> 02:57:08,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Then you have Namco originals, such as Soul Calibur II's Brave Sword, Braver Soul, and the Ridge Racer theme.

2416
02:57:08,505 --> 02:57:09,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.

2417
02:57:09,926 --> 02:57:11,367
[SPEAKER_21]: But then we get the licenses.

2418
02:57:12,167 --> 02:57:16,929
[SPEAKER_21]: Some very interesting license songs in Taiko Drum Master.

2419
02:57:17,430 --> 02:57:18,190
[SPEAKER_21]: My Sharona...

2420
02:57:18,996 --> 02:57:44,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Material Girl, Lady Marmalade, the theme from Jimmy Neutron, and the theme from Dragon Ball Z, and then get this, Toxic, and DDR Crossovers, Tub Thumping, you remember that, second mix, Tub Thumping, and that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh.

2421
02:57:45,666 --> 02:57:50,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if they're going to make the drum any more stable.

2422
02:57:51,171 --> 02:57:54,473
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to see that list, it's over on our website, orangelauntredo.com.

2423
02:57:54,493 --> 02:57:55,574
[SPEAKER_21]: We did post the whole list.

2424
02:57:55,634 --> 02:57:57,155
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the fourth story down right now.

2425
02:57:57,976 --> 02:57:59,838
[SPEAKER_21]: Very interesting.

2426
02:58:00,478 --> 02:58:01,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Donkey Konga is almost out.

2427
02:58:01,859 --> 02:58:03,340
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there's only a couple more weeks until that's out.

2428
02:58:03,360 --> 02:58:06,323
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you go to GameStop, they have the demo set up so you can try it out.

2429
02:58:06,483 --> 02:58:07,043
[SPEAKER_21]: It's interesting.

2430
02:58:07,204 --> 02:58:12,488
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I can't personally be too excited about Donkey Konga after I played it.

2431
02:58:13,325 --> 02:58:16,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the clapping thing is aggravating, you know?

2432
02:58:17,387 --> 02:58:22,469
[SPEAKER_13]: But I wonder, though, have they put out a song list for Donkey Konga yet?

2433
02:58:24,991 --> 02:58:26,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, it's way back in our archives.

2434
02:58:26,712 --> 02:58:28,853
[SPEAKER_21]: You'd have to do a search, but there was a song list announced.

2435
02:58:28,893 --> 02:58:32,214
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the Japanese version had a bunch of J-pop in it.

2436
02:58:32,334 --> 02:58:35,136
[SPEAKER_13]: It had a pretty good song selection.

2437
02:58:37,057 --> 02:58:42,039
[SPEAKER_13]: I just sort of blanked out over Donkey Konga, but it's really cool that it's coming out over here, but

2438
02:58:43,757 --> 02:58:45,319
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the ones I never thought that we'd see.

2439
02:58:46,540 --> 02:58:49,984
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'm going to jam through the last few questions here then we've got to wrap up the show.

2440
02:58:50,325 --> 02:58:51,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Three more questions.

2441
02:58:51,326 --> 02:58:52,267
[SPEAKER_21]: No more questions, please.

2442
02:58:52,527 --> 02:58:54,589
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to get these last few ones.

2443
02:58:55,110 --> 02:58:56,211
[SPEAKER_21]: Dark Knight, a quick question.

2444
02:58:56,251 --> 02:58:57,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Has anyone visited Virginia before?

2445
02:58:58,033 --> 02:59:01,257
[SPEAKER_21]: The reason why was because Loki had that Virginia shirt on the webcam.

2446
02:59:02,998 --> 02:59:08,500
[SPEAKER_17]: As I said before in the chatroom, but no one was paying attention, my aunt and uncle live in Virginia.

2447
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:14,461
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, as a staple, everyone has to bring you back the shirt that says what city they visited.

2448
02:59:14,641 --> 02:59:17,242
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I have this shirt.

2449
02:59:17,642 --> 02:59:22,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, you know, if you want to know the logic with me wearing this shirt, it was on top of the clean pile.

2450
02:59:23,504 --> 02:59:24,924
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the first shirt I saw.

2451
02:59:25,845 --> 02:59:26,905
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's how it goes.

2452
02:59:29,885 --> 02:59:30,906
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for watching.

2453
02:59:30,926 --> 02:59:31,526
[SPEAKER_21]: See you next time.

2454
02:59:46,022 --> 02:59:46,843
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2455
03:00:02,124 --> 03:00:31,311
[SPEAKER_21]: question from BlackDevil when I call and I want to not hear an echo of the conversation do I turn down my master volume or microphone volume don't turn down your mic volume turn down your speakers or well I shouldn't say your speakers turn down your Winamp or if you're iTunes turn it off while you call the show whatever you're using to listen to the station turn it off while you call the show because that's what causes the echo but don't yeah don't turn off your speakers because then you can't hear us through Skype and then you're talking to nothing so yeah

2456
03:00:32,338 --> 03:00:34,799
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut off Winamp or iTunes or whatever you use to listen to the show.

2457
03:00:36,399 --> 03:00:38,620
[SPEAKER_21]: And lastly, Legend of Zaku, one more question.

2458
03:00:39,020 --> 03:00:44,141
[SPEAKER_21]: What are the chances that we Americans will get other Bomani besides DDR and Karaoke Revolution?

2459
03:00:49,322 --> 03:00:50,342
[SPEAKER_13]: We did get Keyboard Mania.

2460
03:00:51,823 --> 03:00:52,743
[SPEAKER_21]: To some extent.

2461
03:00:52,803 --> 03:00:54,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Not necessarily on PlayStation.

2462
03:00:54,303 --> 03:00:55,264
[SPEAKER_13]: But we got the Yamaha.

2463
03:00:56,064 --> 03:00:56,944
[SPEAKER_21]: A little hard to get.

2464
03:00:56,964 --> 03:00:58,644
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of people don't even know about it.

2465
03:00:58,724 --> 03:00:59,144
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so rare.

2466
03:00:59,885 --> 03:00:59,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

2467
03:01:02,512 --> 03:01:02,992
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2468
03:01:03,953 --> 03:01:04,973
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to say never.

2469
03:01:05,654 --> 03:01:06,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Never say never.

2470
03:01:06,574 --> 03:01:07,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just put it that way.

2471
03:01:07,394 --> 03:01:07,995
[SPEAKER_21]: Never say never.

2472
03:01:08,115 --> 03:01:11,316
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I want to see come out in the States is some of the Namco music games.

2473
03:01:12,637 --> 03:01:15,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Namco did... I'm not talking about Taiko no Tatsujin.

2474
03:01:15,378 --> 03:01:19,080
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm talking about the guitar game that Namco did and the drum one that Namco did.

2475
03:01:19,100 --> 03:01:19,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2476
03:01:20,421 --> 03:01:24,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they did a bunch of... They're supposed to be really good music games, just we haven't seen them.

2477
03:01:25,263 --> 03:01:25,603
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2478
03:01:25,623 --> 03:01:27,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all on the Namco.jp site.

2479
03:01:28,669 --> 03:01:31,590
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we are going to wrap up the show now, guys.

2480
03:01:31,830 --> 03:01:32,690
[SPEAKER_21]: It is time.

2481
03:01:32,810 --> 03:01:37,131
[SPEAKER_21]: We're almost running over here, so please let us get everybody's final thought.

2482
03:01:37,151 --> 03:01:38,972
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll start off tonight's final thought with Angel.

2483
03:01:40,232 --> 03:01:43,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... Well, no, I wanted to save it for last word.

2484
03:01:43,413 --> 03:01:49,015
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want it, let me have it, but, uh... Uh... Buffalo Wings.

2485
03:01:50,395 --> 03:01:51,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, uh, Arcadian.

2486
03:01:52,656 --> 03:01:53,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Final thought.

2487
03:01:53,856 --> 03:01:54,656
[SPEAKER_19]: If we can get him a mic.

2488
03:01:55,596 --> 03:01:56,297
[SPEAKER_19]: Final thought from Arcadian42.

2489
03:01:56,437 --> 03:01:57,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay, more money soon.

2490
03:02:01,708 --> 03:02:02,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Jonas, your final thought?

2491
03:02:08,970 --> 03:02:10,090
[SPEAKER_26]: Tournament Tuesday.

2492
03:02:11,170 --> 03:02:11,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God.

2493
03:02:12,931 --> 03:02:15,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, your final thought?

2494
03:02:18,392 --> 03:02:21,653
[SPEAKER_17]: I am working on next week's winning song.

03:07:31,532 --> 03:07:32,112
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all right.

2524
03:07:33,032 --> 03:07:34,133
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't get paid to be funny.

2525
03:07:35,253 --> 03:07:36,654
[SPEAKER_21]: You get paid to sit there and look pretty.

2526
03:07:36,674 --> 03:07:38,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I live with someone who's not that funny.

03:07:39,095 --> 03:07:40,415

03:07:41,936 --> 03:07:42,516

2533
03:07:46,859 --> 03:07:49,681

2534
03:07:49,721 --> 03:07:50,482
[SPEAKER_21]: That's for damn sure.

2535
03:07:50,502 --> 03:07:52,143
[SPEAKER_21]: I can repeat it.

2536
03:07:52,163 --> 03:07:52,403
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

2537
03:07:52,423 --> 03:07:53,164
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't repeat it?

2538
03:07:53,864 --> 03:07:55,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Because none of it is true, damn it.

2539
03:07:56,787 --> 03:07:59,669
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to hear about the person she lives with rubbing off on anyone.

2540
03:08:03,712 --> 03:08:04,473
[SPEAKER_21]: That sucks.

2541
03:08:04,693 --> 03:08:10,197
[SPEAKER_21]: I wish I still had that drumroll noise.

2542
03:08:10,517 --> 03:08:12,539
[SPEAKER_21]: People should pay us to do this show, you know?

2543
03:08:13,720 --> 03:08:15,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I'd get less than minimum wage.

2544
03:08:15,442 --> 03:08:19,949
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to tease the... Oh, you want to tease your new remix, Loki?

2545
03:08:19,969 --> 03:08:20,049
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2546
03:08:20,449 --> 03:08:21,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, tease it.

2547
03:08:21,531 --> 03:08:21,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait.

2548
03:08:22,332 --> 03:08:23,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, puppy!

2549
03:08:23,273 --> 03:08:25,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki wants to tease his newest remix for you all.

2550
03:08:25,777 --> 03:08:26,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Fine, do it.

2551
03:09:36,041 --> 03:09:37,622
[SPEAKER_21]: That was more than a tease.

2552
03:09:37,722 --> 03:09:39,804
[SPEAKER_21]: You grabbed my balls and fondled them right there.

2553
03:09:40,404 --> 03:09:42,886
[SPEAKER_21]: That was very interesting.

2554
03:09:42,966 --> 03:09:44,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, that is pretty cool.

2555
03:09:44,828 --> 03:09:46,169
[SPEAKER_21]: What's that all about?

2556
03:09:46,209 --> 03:09:46,949
[SPEAKER_21]: Tell us about that one.

2557
03:09:48,090 --> 03:09:49,551
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just something with radical faith.

2558
03:09:49,611 --> 03:09:54,535
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard this one remix that someone did and it sucked, and I thought, I'll try something like that.

2559
03:09:56,176 --> 03:09:57,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I was instantly drawn to the tech.

2560
03:09:58,958 --> 03:09:59,339
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2561
03:09:59,659 --> 03:10:03,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Now listening to it through your speakers, I have to change a few things, but it's just the beginning of it.

2562
03:10:03,802 --> 03:10:04,863
[SPEAKER_17]: The end kind of gets weird sometimes.

2563
03:10:06,184 --> 03:10:08,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me play a clip here.

2564
03:10:08,892 --> 03:10:12,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I can't really transition in this part yet, but it's kind of cool.

2565
03:10:13,324 --> 03:10:13,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

2566
03:10:41,215 --> 03:10:42,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, that stuff.

2567
03:10:42,402 --> 03:10:42,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2568
03:10:43,206 --> 03:10:43,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

2569
03:10:44,111 --> 03:10:45,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.

2570
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:56,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.

2571
03:11:14,069 --> 03:11:18,231
[SPEAKER_23]: The first crash happened in Bukalki.

2572
03:11:18,391 --> 03:11:20,753
[SPEAKER_21]: I played it ten times tonight and it's still not old.

2573
03:11:20,813 --> 03:11:21,273
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

2574
03:11:22,033 --> 03:11:23,154
[SPEAKER_21]: It is still funny.

2575
03:11:23,434 --> 03:11:24,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope, still funny.

2576
03:11:24,415 --> 03:11:24,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2577
03:11:25,936 --> 03:11:26,196
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2578
03:11:26,216 --> 03:11:33,640
[SPEAKER_21]: For some reason I can't get that uploaded right now, but... I'll just try it again later.

2579
03:11:34,992 --> 03:11:36,473
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2580
03:11:57,711 --> 03:12:01,575
[SPEAKER_21]: Flare One uploaded it, there's the URL in the chatroom Flare One was very kind to upload that to you all

2581
03:12:20,033 --> 03:12:23,956
[SPEAKER_21]: I know it's on GeoShitties, but hopefully enough of you guys can get it before GeoShitties locks them out.

2582
03:12:25,397 --> 03:12:26,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Good luck, you guys.

2583
03:12:27,319 --> 03:12:28,620

[SPEAKER_21]: I forgot.

2589
03:12:44,214 --> 03:12:46,976
[SPEAKER_21]: The thing has this whole little intro, so you just kind of have to sit through it.

2590
03:12:49,800 --> 03:12:50,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

2591
03:12:59,153 --> 03:12:59,513
