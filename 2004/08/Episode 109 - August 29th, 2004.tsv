274982	278463	Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
278924	286666	Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
305564	307624	Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!
334526	337149	Any time, any place, baby.
337569	338490	Ow, my foot!
338971	340832	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
344807	352531	We are live and this is episode number 109 for this, August the 29th of 2004.
352971	364216	You're tuned in to the B-Money Scenes, most competitive radio station of all things B-Money.
365456	367477	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
367697	370319	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
370739	372980	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
373666	375847	You know her better as Jamie Summers.
376467	377307	DarkSakura!
380908	381368	Can't hear you.
382209	382969	I hate pollen.
383709	385730	And I hate not having air conditioning.
386550	388110	And I hate my throat and I hate my nose.
388911	390291	I hate my sinus passages.
390411	392472	Is there anything you like this evening?
392792	393032	Meat.
393132	394492	This is some damn good meat.
394673	396353	I just wanted to end things on a positive note.
397093	397573	Positive?
397633	398414	How about a high note?
399114	399394	Okay.
399414	399494	Okay.
400026	401327	I would, except my throat hurts.
401747	402668	So I did it on a low note.
404729	405510	Works for me.
405810	407291	I could try the high note.
408312	409313	But I don't want to like, you know.
409353	410133	You're hecka lame.
411975	412555	That me!
413596	415057	Oh my god, I finally saw a basketball.
416057	416658	What'd you think?
417178	419020	It's not my how was my week, how was my day yet.
419200	419900	Alright.
422392	425273	Oh, she's feisty tonight, Miss Jamie Summers is here.
425293	427694	I just counted she because my flicks is all fucked up.
427734	429115	She's here and she's feisty.
429135	430295	I don't know, she's Catwoman.
431496	433036	My nose is full of snot.
434637	435477	Give me a new nose, Rob.
435497	436078	Good Kmart.
437198	441260	Also joining us tonight, the one and only Tech Massa Loki.
441620	444521	And I was fixing a webcam and I stepped on something sharp.
447137	449458	S, The Clumsy Professor, as always.
449918	450518	It's metal.
450858	450918	Ow.
450958	453358	It's probably a piece of your vortex.
453799	454999	No, it's a piece of wire.
455359	458880	Also joining us tonight, say hello to DDR Angel.
459020	459360	Hello.
459880	460480	I'm here again.
460500	461520	What, four weeks in a row?
461740	462080	Yeah.
462220	463221	Damn, girl, get a life.
463401	463881	Hey.
463901	464361	I'm just kidding.
464521	464821	All right.
466981	467261	I know.
467622	468322	What is this, 109 weeks in a row?
468442	473083	I think you're one to walk, talk, balk, cock.
473263	473443	No.
477108	480069	Can't wait till I get a week off, which I do get pretty soon.
480229	481430	About three weeks, I have a week off.
481590	482490	A forced week off?
482590	483571	Yes, a forced week off.
483811	485532	My doctor says this show's not good for me.
486632	487173	You know what?
487973	488093	What?
488113	489354	Your computer hates me.
489994	490414	Why's that?
491375	496277	It just does, but I'll make the supreme effort, but goddammit, while you're out of town, we better have guests.
497878	499659	Alright, we'll... Or else we'll take a vacation too.
500559	501660	We'll see what happens.
501760	505622	I'm sure I can... We'll re-record three hours of Loki singing.
508795	515760	Just whip out, you know what, before I leave, I'll buy Karaoke Revolution 2 and you'll have yourself a whole three hour show right there.
517101	517701	Can't hear you babe.
519883	520343	How's that?
520904	523665	You gotta hold the mic to the bottom sometimes.
524346	532111	I'm going to announce to everybody tonight that I am currently on Dayquil Tylenol Allergy Sinus and now Benadryl.
532952	535233	In other words, Jamie admits that she's on drugs.
535253	536074	I am fucked up tonight.
536949	540392	So if I start saying something really weird, blame the drugs.
540893	545918	But I'm going to have ice cream, so that should sort of negate it, because I'll be in happy chocolate mode.
546238	547419	It's my Lincoln's ice cream.
547559	548620	Oh, never mind.
548961	550823	Low-carb ice cream is not ice cream.
550863	551663	No, it's good.
551724	552444	It's made with cream.
552464	553505	All right, we'll see.
553525	555287	It's better than normal ice cream, because it's good.
555587	557269	It has fat in it, and fat makes it good.
558877	561318	Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back.
561398	562879	Oh yeah, there's Bimani stuff too.
562919	564260	We do talk about DDR and stuff.
564280	565060	What's that Bimani crap?
565220	566061	Yeah, what is that stuff?
566301	568282	You know, I was actually playing Ultramix before the show.
568762	570023	I want to talk about that when we come back.
570964	572144	After this little break.
572825	573985	I thought it would be funny.
574005	576707	Because I want to address some folks that play on Ultramix, that's why.
577667	578488	We're going to take a break.
578528	581429	In this break, enjoy the music of Outphase.
582150	587072	And we'll be back after this break with much randomness for you.
587773	588113	Enjoy.
636144	636326	Thank you.
694041	695184	Thanks for watching!
799238	799801	Thanks for watching!
867839	868540	Thanks for watching!
944346	953688	and now let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio
954435	958537	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
958557	959517	Can we talk about that?
959797	962159	No subject will ever be taboo.
962439	966060	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
966580	969142	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
969642	974984	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
975544	976825	I collect your fucking head.
978777	980278	Just like this fucker here.
981378	985059	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
985339	988701	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
989641	996083	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
997324	1001025	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
1004332	1005292	We are back.
1005432	1009053	Orange Lounge Radio episode 109 is live.
1010013	1011934	Uh, in a... Damn it.
1014594	1015034	My bad.
1016194	1016695	Hold on a minute.
1016735	1016915	Hold on.
1016935	1017615	I have an announcement.
1018915	1019275	Thank you.
1019295	1024136	Uh, this message was brought to you by Diet Soda.
1025776	1027237	Enjoy at your local grocer.
1028377	1028717	Alright.
1031278	1033378	Okay, so we are live here
1033916	1035077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1053041	1059443	and I hope I don't make people go, oh yeah, I forgot, and then they shut off the show and go watch it, but the closing ceremonies at the Olympics are going on right now.
1060483	1061043	They're done!
1061343	1061883	They're done!
1062063	1062883	It sucked!
1063644	1064324	It sucked!
1064464	1068905	And trust me, if you watch the closing ceremonies, they're like, well, that was cool, maybe I should watch it next year!
1068925	1071105	But the women's handball team won the gold, right?
1073606	1074246	He has glasses.
1074306	1075906	The women's handball team won gold.
1075986	1082248	And then Bjork would have sung... Okay, I need the new Bjork album.
1083951	1086173	I am more excited about Bjork than the Olympics.
1086253	1087314	Bjork makes me all horny.
1087955	1089136	I have new Bjork stuff.
1089916	1090857	Give Turat a skull.
1091658	1097503	I actually, uh, I was looking and I found photocopies of certain Bjork albums that are out soon.
1098804	1107732	So, hold on, let me, uh... See, this is what you're missing at the Olympics right now.
1110536	1116278	I'm a tree that is big!
1116578	1118959	Just kidding, I like Bjork, otherwise I wouldn't have the album.
1127722	1128002	Anyway.
1128082	1134965	Wow, we've actually got people.
1135936	1137656	here who showed up during the break.
1137676	1139617	Yeah, we do have people that showed up here during the break.
1139657	1143497	We have Arcadian42 showed up with glasses.
1144458	1145018	New glasses.
1147118	1147638	They're not new.
1148498	1152099	Well, they look new because you haven't worn them around me in a long time, if ever.
1152739	1154919	Yeah, well, these are, like, way out of date, actually.
1154939	1155880	This is, like, five years.
1156400	1158480	This is, like, a prescription I got, like, five or six years ago.
1159100	1162861	I'm only wearing it because my contacts are, like, weeks old.
1164289	1169011	I can't buy any new ones until I get an eye exam, and I can't afford an eye exam for a while.
1172852	1175493	Last time I came here, I just wear them every so often.
1175674	1187578	I'm only wearing them for a few hours, but I can't wear them all day, because the contacts I have right now are way too old to wear every day, or I might get an infection in the eye or something.
1188699	1189459	So it wouldn't be a good idea.
1193405	1193745	Alright.
1195647	1203173	Also here with us tonight that came during the break was Jonas, also known as Explicit with three X's, because he's triple X rated.
1203353	1204053	He's a porn star.
1204454	1206075	Hey, everybody.
1206896	1209578	Is that stinking state fair still going on by your work?
1210639	1211599	Uh, yeah.
1212780	1215783	I want to come play DDR at your work, but the stinking state fair's gone.
1215803	1217304	You can actually play in the weekdays.
1218245	1222368	The reason why it was closed on Saturday and Sunday is because that's where the business is racking up.
1223004	1224025	Friday's you can actually go.
1224165	1226206	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday as well.
1226446	1229548	So the parking lot doesn't spill all the way back there on the weekdays?
1229788	1229948	No.
1230309	1231249	Only Saturday and Sunday.
1231849	1233030	Maybe I will go during the week.
1233090	1233590	We'll see.
1233871	1233971	Okay.
1233991	1234531	I'll think about it.
1236332	1236632	Alright.
1236812	1237413	Is there anything else?
1238557	1239217	Uh, maybe later.
1239457	1240478	We'll talk to you more a little bit later.
1240498	1240618	Okay.
1240798	1242298	Oh, yeah, I forgot to talk about competition.
1242538	1244479	We had the Olympics going on, and Bjork's singing.
1244539	1245579	Oh, no, actually, she sang at the Olympics.
1245599	1246460	She's not singing again.
1246500	1247340	I was kidding about that.
1247880	1251682	Uh, we had the Olympics going on, and the Video Music Awards are going on right now.
1252162	1252782	In Miami.
1253942	1258384	Is going on, and I think a lot of people ditched our show to go listen to that, and, uh, you suck.
1258584	1258744	Why?
1259184	1260044	I know, seriously.
1260665	1261805	MTV is so done.
1264126	1267627	MTV is so done, and overrated, and, ugh.
1271288	1271829	Who won?
1272269	1273790	Can we just get a spoiler out there?
1273850	1274310	Who won?
1274370	1275391	Don't we know who won now?
1275791	1280354	Let's just get the spoilers out there and who made out with who this year and who punched who in the face.
1280694	1281655	Let's just get it all out.
1282115	1283896	That way the guys don't have to watch.
1283916	1292862	You can feel free to listen to this show and watch our webcam on www.orangelongeradio.com You can also join our chat room there.
1293342	1296444	www.orangelongeradio.com Just that easy.
1298177	1307363	Alright, we do have some Bomani news I want to talk about tonight, but first, we have to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show by playing a little bit of How was your week?
1307963	1308704	How was your day?
1309084	1310605	And starting us off tonight for How was your week?
1310625	1311205	How was your day?
1311686	1312866	The lovely DarkSakura.
1313487	1315448	My week was... Oh.
1316429	1320131	My week was okay until my allergies started to hate me.
1321652	1323894	I had a perfect score in my classes.
1325074	1325595	Congrats.
1325875	1326035	Yep.
1326866	1328347	I'm being like a good little nerdlet.
1329068	1332991	And the Benadryl finally kicked in.
1333031	1333592	I can breathe.
1334392	1336294	But I haven't yet fallen into a coma, okay?
1341899	1346023	But it's just been kind of a druggy week.
1346083	1347504	I've been on the DayQuil all week.
1348285	1350387	And then I had to double up all doses of everything.
1350948	1352369	I've been just so drugged.
1353027	1357769	But my air conditioning isn't working again at my house, so I'm going to have Dan Fusset, the apartment manager, for me.
1358730	1360050	Yeah, sniff.
1361031	1365873	I finally broke down and bought a box of tissues, so they're going to be my best friend all weekend.
1369155	1370775	But yeah, it hasn't been very interesting.
1370835	1373717	It's just been filled with lots of tissue, lots of drugs.
1374697	1378339	I feel like some kind of celebrity, because I'm popping pills all weekend, you know?
1380378	1389020	Maybe I should rent a hotel room and throw a wild party and throw the bed sheets out of the window into the pool and all that kind of stuff.
1389840	1395842	But I'm hoping to feel better by next weekend so I can participate in much random shooting of things.
1398702	1399863	This hasn't been too interesting.
1401263	1401843	Very drugged.
1403784	1404544	Very, very drugged.
1408525	1409285	And Rob snores.
1410089	1410329	What?
1410969	1411250	See?
1412110	1413230	You weren't even paying attention to me.
1413250	1415632	I was trying to research the VMA so I could spoil it for everyone.
1415652	1416052	I'm sorry.
1417833	1421834	Sometimes you have to take the radio show by the horns and drive it yourself for a little bit.
1425016	1427857	I could have said, and Rob suddenly likes pussy.
1428517	1429978	And you would go, I wouldn't know.
1430238	1433580	There are certain keywords that set off my alarm inside.
1434300	1435300	Pussy being one of them.
1435340	1436161	And I would have got you.
1438411	1440372	No, it's actually, it's just been stuff.
1440772	1443854	You know, I didn't even know the Video Music Awards were going on, because I don't watch cable.
1443994	1444454	I don't watch TV.
1444475	1444915	I know, I know.
1444935	1446356	I don't watch crap either, so.
1448297	1450718	Well, especially since the TV is now being taken up.
1450738	1451618	Except for Survivor.
1451739	1454760	I'm allowed one crap show to like, and that is my crap show.
1454800	1455100	You know what?
1455140	1458142	You can download Survivor on the Swin Channel on BitTorrent, I found.
1459063	1460183	Well, I don't need old ones.
1460223	1460784	I need new ones.
1460804	1461564	No, these are the new ones.
1461949	1462949	How can they be the new ones?
1462969	1467911	Well, I mean, whenever the new ones are on, there's one that does all the reality shows.
1468311	1473133	And on top of that, I'm so happy because they put up the Stargate episode within 15 minutes of it airing.
1473413	1477454	That's how I was keeping tabs on The Amazing Race, which most people generally agree is not a crap show.
1477474	1478674	The Amazing Race is cool.
1479254	1480635	I like the old army guy in it.
1480855	1486177	I haven't been watching this year, though, because when Sharla and Myrna got kicked off, it just lost interest.
1486197	1487797	The army guy is so kick-ass.
1487817	1490338	This old guy and his daughter are a team.
1490886	1490986	Oh.
1491086	1495790	And he had fallen, like, in the first part of the race and sliced up his leg.
1495830	1495990	Yep.
1496651	1497471	But he continued.
1497531	1498692	They still stayed in the race.
1499233	1503876	And then he did the whole, um, what's the thing with the pulley and the line?
1504577	1506618	From the top of the swim building into a swimming pool.
1507059	1508800	Of course, chlorine with an open wound.
1509240	1509460	Yep.
1509721	1510621	This guy was hardcore.
1510661	1511862	Have you watched all the episodes yet?
1512122	1513243	No, because I don't have TV.
1513263	1514624	I just caught it over at Iguana Girl's house.
1514804	1515545	Oh, okay.
1515565	1516926	Well, catch up to Current.
1516946	1518267	There's some good stuff that happens in the series.
1518327	1519368	I'm busy watching Stargate.
1520356	1522157	Watch my pretty scientist man.
1523638	1523878	Anyway.
1524158	1525559	Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
1525719	1526059	Uh-uh.
1526319	1526760	All right, then.
1526840	1528901	Loki, how was your week?
1528941	1529381	How was your day?
1533424	1536425	I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week because it's too hard.
1539127	1540528	Yeah, whatever.
1540908	1542889	Wait till you hear what he did today, but I'll let him tell.
1545617	1546960	I am lazy, okay?
1547180	1548944	I am extremely lazy.
1549345	1551610	Extremely, extremely lazy.
1552071	1553554	Let me make this clear.
1553734	1554937	I am extremely lazy.
1556309	1559392	and, you know, before... I have a question.
1559752	1561554	So, Loki, are you in fact lazy?
1562595	1563595	Yes, extremely lazy.
1563876	1570982	Anyways, so, before, you know, I had farmed, you know, for, you know, really expensive items for over three weeks.
1571342	1572823	Today was just not one of those days.
1573044	1575145	I felt like not earning my money at all.
1575766	1576607	So I bought it.
1577668	1579049	I bought in-game money.
1582617	1588860	So in other words, you gave somebody real life money so that they could give you in-game money.
1589060	1590681	I just want to make that clear for our listeners.
1591661	1592602	That would be correct.
1595871	1596251	You know what?
1596291	1600833	They can kiss my ass because I got that money within 15 minutes of paying it.
1600933	1601554	And you know what?
1602034	1605696	That saved me a good 10 hours of gameplay.
1605876	1606276	Think about it.
1606296	1607477	It's opportunity cost.
1607577	1610458	Any economics teacher will teach you.
1610718	1613980	You want to spend the 10 hours or pay the $20.
1614100	1616381	Okay, that's what it is.
1617898	1623640	That's especially amazing considering that it takes about 45 minutes to get a GM sometimes.
1624020	1626381	And Loki got his money in 15 minutes.
1628342	1632864	That was enough time for me to take a power nap and then go back into the game and have my money waiting for me.
1635165	1640807	You know, in Ragnarok, all I have to do is play for 15 minutes and I'll get, like, 400,000 zeny.
1641647	1643588	Well, that's because that money's worth nothing.
1644248	1645949	Well, so your money's not worth anything?
1646542	1648704	I could go buy a goat headband.
1649504	1651646	And it looks cool because I have big goat horns.
1653228	1655629	Which would be very perfect for your portal to hell.
1656650	1656830	No.
1657431	1658632	I haven't touched Ragnarok in a week.
1660256	1661397	I have my magnet wire coming.
1661818	1668506	Oh yeah, so then I have some other stuff that's coming for my so-called portal to hell.
1668546	1670007	I have my magnet wire coming.
1670027	1675454	I have an eight and a half pound spool of that shit, so I'll be able to make something with that.
1676435	1679018	And what else?
1681084	1686789	Oh yeah, I had to go to the doctor about my ingrown toenail that's nasty.
1688010	1691774	But, well, he better fix that shit because you can get blood poisoning.
1692174	1692955	Anyways, so I...
1696218	1697339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1726534	1729115	Angel, how was your week?
1729175	1729575	How was your day?
1729615	1729935	Hello, okay, um...
1756957	1760959	Let's see, just schoolwork and other crap, nothing too damn exciting.
1764061	1768024	Let's see, I played a little DDR, but not too much, which kind of sucks.
1768804	1773027	I'm watching Rob make a funny face!
1773847	1775288	Jamie's making you try her diet food.
1777529	1779590	I played a little pop music as well, that's pretty cool.
1780591	1782792	Other than that, I did nothing except for homework.
1783052	1783853	Yay, homework.
1785293	1787595	Alright, anybody else want to go next?
1787835	1788476	Hmm, maybe.
1788796	1789317	Arcadian.
1789998	1790378	Okay.
1791859	1793601	This week was mostly work.
1795423	1802629	And on Friday we finally talked about employing me, and so we just did the pre-work and now I'm not an attempt anymore.
1802689	1803190	Yay!
1804371	1804852	Yay!
1804892	1805452	Congratulations.
1806273	1810617	And so one day will be the first day of not being an attempt, which is good.
1815620	1816660	That is such a good point.
1816700	1819101	We have a bush and a dick in the White House.
1819261	1820421	That's an old joke.
1820461	1821822	I can't believe you've never heard that before.
1825582	1825883	Anyway.
1828743	1829583	Sorry, Arcadian.
1830864	1831364	That's okay.
1832664	1834265	Well, she wanted to talk, so I gave it to her.
1835065	1842367	Yeah.
1842907	1843387	Fuck MPB!
1852724	1854385	I'm sorry, I keep getting interrupted.
1854986	1855506	Was there anything else?
1855526	1858288	Too bad that Explosion didn't kill seven at the MTV Music Awards.
1860430	1860990	That would be nice.
1861790	1862431	Just kill them all.
1863760	1866502	Actually, I have something that somewhat relates to the news, what's going on.
1867122	1870265	I'm going to continue to interrupt Arcadian's little story he's trying to tell.
1870285	1873006	Not going to have much of a story, anyway.
1873086	1875848	More than 100,000 protest bush in New York City.
1876969	1880972	Those are some mean, mean feminists there.
1882296	1888164	Actually, it's interesting, because did you hear about those planes that were crashing, or the Russian planes that crashed earlier?
1888625	1899840	Apparently this is, I'm like the last one to ever hear anything funny that's going on, but apparently Tom Brokaw said on the news, he tried to pronounce one of the Russian city names, but he got it wrong.
1900160	1901641	and he said something else instead.
1901681	1902341	And here it is.
1902581	1904342	Thank you, Unknown Gamer, for passing this along to me.
1904362	1905022	This is pretty funny.
1905402	1910864	Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.
1911465	1916247	The first crash happened in Bukhaki.
1917107	1918247	He said Bukhaki.
1918387	1921449	He said that in the next intro.
1921909	1927151	Tom Brokaw said Bukhaki.
1927291	1927851	Next intro.
1927871	1929532	I say that it goes in the next intro.
1933220	1934521	Hold on, one more time, one more time.
1934721	1938564	Crash happened in Bukkake.
1943087	1945449	There was a crash that happened and it made Bukkake.
1947590	1948171	Tee hee.
1950112	1951393	We're seven years old.
1952214	1954075	Poopy, poopy, Bukkake, Bukkake.
1956656	1962180	I don't care how old you are, how mature you think you are, that is funny when Tom Brokaw says Bukkake on accident.
1962520	1969224	I'm sure he must not have, when he caught his mistake, if he even knows what the word means, I'm sure when he caught his mistake, he was probably pretty pissed.
1972206	1973407	I have to do it one more time.
1974387	1978550	The first crash happened in Bukkake.
1979771	1983273	Anyway, Arcadian, I'm sorry to keep interrupting.
1983333	1984073	How was your week?
1984173	1984974	How was your day?
1985399	2013424	Okay, uh, let's see, NovamaniMoves, uh, this weekend, like, on Friday, uh, I found a praying menace that was, uh, on the ceiling of my bathroom, and he hung out for, like, until today, and then I decided to take him outside, and then, seemed like it was too hot outside, he seemed, I put him in a shady spot, but he seemed to be, like, uh, melting or something, so I put a little bit of water on him and threw him in the bushes, and he disappeared about a week, I mean, about an hour later, so he may have been
2014096	2017377	Birdfood, or may have crawled off to find some bugs.
2018077	2018858	Or, who knows.
2019618	2020378	The Circle of Life.
2021559	2023959	And the rest of the day was just boring.
2023999	2029221	Watched a few episodes of Upright Citizens Brigade that I had on CD.
2029301	2029941	That show rocks.
2030562	2033222	Yeah.
2034023	2034883	And Play on the Computer.
2036644	2037724	And I don't know what else.
2037884	2039244	That's about everything for me.
2040605	2040945	Alright.
2041625	2043706	I'll talk about my week and my day, and then we'll get to Jonas.
2045168	2046388	My week and my day was pretty good.
2046708	2050290	Didn't do a whole lot during the week, just a lot of work, you know, the usual stuff.
2051371	2058994	Then yesterday, I actually met some friends of mine from LiveJournal who live up in Seattle, and they're also on our Final Fantasy XI link shell, so I've known these guys for a long time.
2059475	2068219	They go by Wither and Ataluta on our Final Fantasy XI link shell, and they were down here from Seattle on a total whim, where I guess they were going to go to Marine World for one of the birthdays.
2068866	2071207	And so they called me up and was like, hey, let's hang out.
2071227	2071868	So I'm like, okay.
2072248	2079492	So I went down there and I took them to San Francisco and we all went to the Metreon, which, you know, kind of a famous place in NorCal DDR history.
2079552	2083334	It was one of the first two places that really had a lot of DDR and had big tournaments.
2083354	2085455	So I took them there so they could, you know, be at the Metreon.
2085475	2090918	And there's just other cool stuff there too, like the official Sony PlayStation Store and things like that.
2091591	2093814	and I actually played a game of DDR.
2094315	2098640	Adeluda forced me to play a game of DDR up on the third floor where the movie theater is.
2098660	2099541	They have a DDR machine.
2100302	2101203	And I played a game.
2101884	2102064	Huh?
2103046	2105589	Yeah, Jamie, you and I played on that back when it was a fifth mix, I think.
2105669	2106550	But now it's an extreme...
2107313	2109414	And, um, we would have gone to Pier 39.
2109715	2112136	Now, we would have gone to Pier 39 had we had more time.
2112476	2123823	I was a little pressed for time yesterday, so I just, I only had time really to take them to the Metreon, because public transit goes right by there, the bar, and to get on, get to Pier 39, we would have had to take a bus.
2124144	2126265	It would have taken too long, but next time, I'll make them come back.
2127205	2128086	But we went to the Metreon.
2128875	2130696	and played a game there, and you know what?
2130736	2132917	DDR still gets crowds of people.
2133437	2145782	Like, we were playing Cowgirl, which is not that complicated of a song, it's just a fun one, but there were just huge crowds of people that hear the little gallop, you know, because we're trying to get extra stage, right?
2146162	2148423	So we were playing that, and it was funny.
2148723	2151484	And then he played Doubles, and he got a hell of a crowd doing that.
2151524	2152164	It was pretty funny.
2152684	2153465	Cowgirl...
2154518	2157600	I'm just surprised that DDR still gets big crowds like that.
2157620	2163683	But I guess in a city like San Francisco, big touristy spot, maybe people come there, they don't get out that often.
2163764	2164104	I don't know.
2164304	2164624	I don't know.
2164864	2169387	Well, the reason why DDR is still popular is because, one, it's the only game that has exercise involved.
2170207	2170527	Really.
2171408	2171648	Yeah.
2172629	2172989	That's true.
2173709	2180073	But then I went downstairs and I bowed down to the DDR 1.5 mix that they still have there.
2181949	2183391	I miss 1.5 mix a little bit.
2183731	2186073	Actually, I miss 5th mix and I miss 4th mix plus.
2186354	2188096	And I miss some 3rd mix Koreans too.
2188856	2192660	Because they're all either extreme or they're extreme these days.
2192861	2194662	Maybe you see a max 2 still once in a while.
2195323	2197405	Maybe you get a 4th plus if you're lucky.
2197966	2199828	But what happened to all the 5th mix?
2199868	2203512	I remember when I used to hate 5th mix, but I totally have a respect for it now.
2204201	2208723	I always loved Fifth Mix, but there's no place outside anymore.
2209043	2211084	When it first came out, I hated it.
2211124	2218087	But the reason why I hated Fifth Mix when it first came out was because I was still kind of in that new phase to DDR.
2218687	2219827	I was in that transitional phase.
2219847	2222588	When I first played DDR, USA was all I knew.
2222929	2224389	I played USA, USA, USA.
2224909	2227350	And then finally we picked up a fourth mix.
2227810	2233833	So I was really just starting to discover a bunch of those older songs, like the old erotic songs and stuff like that, which were really my...
2234253	2241695	My Thing That I Love, and then right as I was discovering those, Fifth Mix comes out, and when that came out, what was the first thing that Fifth Mix did?
2241715	2245636	It was the first mix to delete songs from older mixes, in mass.
2245716	2259300	Now, I'm not talking like onesies, twosies, like Strictly Business, So Many Men, deleting songs like that, but I'm talking Fifth Mix was the first time they cut a whole bunch of songs from second and third mix, and I was pissed, because like all the good erotic songs I like to play were gone, and all the
2259800	2265164	Cheesy stuff from 3rd Mix, like If You Can Say Goodbye and Flashdance, all that shit was gone.
2265184	2269006	I would like to point out that 4th Mix deleted stuff from 3rd Plus.
2271087	2273269	They deleted a couple of the Korean songs, right?
2273389	2274750	Yeah.
2276030	2276571	And one other.
2278452	2282134	It was one other I thought that they did that wasn't... But I'm talking about like 30, 40 songs.
2282154	2283835	5th Mix got rid of like 30, 40 old songs.
2283935	2284456	And so I kind of...
2288391	2288831	I know.
2288891	2290492	But too bad Konami won't put them in.
2290512	2292712	I mean, like Moonlight Shadow, or Moving On, or...
2316069	2317831	It's like a lot of songs in Fifth Mix are so good.
2318051	2320914	Well, the nice thing is a lot of those songs are coming out now in the US.
2320974	2324718	It's like, it's kind of weird because between Extreme and Ultramix 2, we're getting a lot of Fifth Mix songs.
2324958	2326340	Moonlight Shadow is going to be in Ultramix 2.
2326400	2327761	Ooh, interesting.
2327821	2330204	I heard about Ultramix 2 who's making the steps and stuff.
2331105	2332346	Yeah, but, you know.
2334667	2335127	Crazy stuff.
2335667	2337728	And I heard this Maximizer song.
2337748	2339408	Did you actually hear this song?
2339428	2341589	No, I just heard news about this Maximizer.
2341729	2342869	We'll talk about all that a little bit.
2343129	2346311	I'll get into the extreme news a little later because there was big extreme news this week.
2346331	2348011	I want to ask you guys some stuff about it.
2348371	2352993	But first off, where the hell was I?
2353033	2353753	Oh yeah, the Metreon.
2354373	2359175	So we left the Metreon and then I came back and I went to a Halo party last night.
2359653	2360314	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2387620	2388220	That was pretty much it.
2388240	2389821	That's all that's worth saying about my week and my day.
2390921	2391361	Moving on.
2391541	2392462	Jonas, how was your week?
2392482	2392902	How was your day?
2393922	2397243	My day was pretty, actually, this whole week's pretty good so far.
2397263	2398204	I got new shoes.
2398964	2400704	I actually can play DDR hella good with them.
2400904	2403145	Started to double lay a lot of stuff with it.
2404426	2406886	And heard some news about Tuesday's tournament in Scandia.
2408007	2409047	Not sure if you all heard about it.
2410227	2412528	Oh, yeah, you heard about the overnight one or something?
2412548	2413388	They're doing like a lock-in?
2413408	2414689	It's called Back to School Bash.
2414709	2414749	Oh.
2415876	2417439	Weren't we going to go crash this tournament?
2417640	2419023	Weren't we talking about going to crash it?
2419283	2420526	I was going to go as Dr. Dick.
2422592	2429653	I could if my foot was better, and it still hurts, but, you know, after ten days, that's, you know, up there.
2430434	2435755	I'm so out of shape, I cannot play anything.
2435775	2440116	Jesus, man, Jesus.
2440496	2441256	But anyways.
2441336	2442416	Blow out everybody's speakers.
2442496	2445297	I'm kind of worried about how the rules are going to turn out.
2445317	2446257	All he says is P.A.
2446297	2446937	and freestyle.
2447017	2447877	When is this tournament?
2448277	2449177	Tuesday at 7 o'clock.
2449657	2450178	Tuesday?
2450818	2451698	Tuesday at 7 o'clock P.M.
2453123	2454384	That's during Jamie's show.
2455364	2455784	I know.
2455864	2456664	I think I'm going to go.
2457745	2458585	I want to go win it.
2459426	2461686	The prize is a trophy.
2462147	2463147	It's a trophy?
2463327	2467929	Because I'm betting all the good players in Sacramento don't know about it, like Toadie and Moogle Hunter and all that.
2468129	2468889	They don't know about it.
2468929	2470470	They actually know about it a little bit.
2470570	2471270	God damn it.
2471330	2471911	Who told them?
2472371	2472971	Who told them?
2473251	2474492	DDRUK.com.
2474552	2474972	Fuck.
2475892	2476512	Blame them.
2476953	2481534	Why the fuck would DDRUK be talking about a shitty little tournament at Scandia?
2482255	2482575	Why?
2483337	2485418	Why would anyone want to give that tournament the time of day?
2485939	2498326	Well, because people are like... Some of my workers at Paradise Island went to Scandia and stuff, just to see... I'm gonna go and I'm gonna break Toadie and Moogle's legs, and then I'm gonna win it.
2498686	2500407	And I'm gonna win me a shiny trophy.
2500947	2502448	You could also get it for freestyle as well.
2502848	2504509	There's like two people, only two people entering.
2504669	2505190	That's right!
2505890	2506951	White people can't dance!
2507131	2511213	I'm totally... I'm gonna... Oh, I'm gonna... It's on.
2511513	2512314	It is so on.
2512334	2512394	Wow.
2512854	2513814	No way, I'm not competing.
2514535	2515975	So, you have a high chance.
2516395	2516795	Bring it.
2517175	2517576	Bring it.
2518076	2518976	Oh, you want me to compete?
2519036	2519436	Bring it.
2520457	2521517	Alright, I'll compete.
2522937	2526178	I'm going to make something up, and I'm going to beat you up.
2527359	2528559	It's already been brought in.
2529419	2531380	You came close on the Marsh Madness.
2533221	2534761	That's just because I know how to work a crowd.
2535221	2535861	That's alright.
2537322	2540163	Or you can reserve for SPGL on December.
2541590	2543090	I'm not talking about these things yet.
2543531	2543831	Okay.
2544031	2545431	We'll discuss that later on.
2545491	2554434	Well, we can say now there is a tournament that's going to be at Sunnyvale Golf Line in December, but I'm thinking about doing something special.
2554454	2555054	But I don't know yet.
2555154	2557154	It's only DDR4++, I'm assuming.
2557935	2559995	They're not using Xtreme's old 4++ for freestyle.
2560255	2560655	Oh, I know.
2561176	2562456	That's the reason why I want to do it.
2563016	2563396	Same here.
2563456	2564316	Xtreme is used.
2564977	2566097	4++, like retro.
2566617	2567457	Old is new again.
2567657	2569218	I love the 90s all over again, right?
2569478	2569618	Mm-hmm.
2571192	2573073	Hey Rob, if you're going to that thing, can I go?
2573213	2574334	Because you need a cheering section.
2575375	2576675	I hella need a cheering section.
2577196	2577596	I'm sure.
2577776	2578897	I'm sure I'll end up going.
2579497	2580898	The question is if I'm going to enter or not.
2581238	2584200	I'm thinking about doing my very first actual freestyle.
2584580	2585061	That's the thing.
2585281	2585741	I don't know yet.
2585841	2586222	I don't know yet.
2586462	2587622	You got two days, unfortunately.
2588443	2588643	No, no, no.
2588663	2589364	I'm talking about Spiggle.
2589844	2590804	Oh, oh, ooh.
2592005	2593406	I was going to say, because there you go.
2594567	2597188	Make that five months or so, I'm assuming.
2597669	2599170	I was going to say, if Rob goes, then...
2600307	2603269	Magus and I will carpool with him, maybe, if he lets us.
2603709	2605730	And we will be his cheering section, because we can.
2608331	2608692	We'll see.
2608812	2611913	I'll let you guys know if I end up going to this tournament Tuesday at Scandia.
2612053	2612574	I'll let you guys know.
2612614	2616576	I'll probably be there, since I didn't get any tickets for the WWE Event Arc Arena.
2618517	2618957	Oh, yeah.
2618997	2621699	See, there's more competitors that are going to be gone, because they'll go to that.
2622179	2622779	Yeah.
2622839	2623180	Shit.
2624180	2625421	You got that SmackDown event.
2625441	2627102	I got three days to come up with a routine.
2627182	2627482	Damn.
2627502	2627622	Damn.
2628993	2630354	I gotta find my copy of Extreme.
2631935	2633317	Okay, let's see what else.
2634738	2638161	It's also on DDRfreak.com since everyone heard about it from DDRUK.
2639502	2642164	Okay, also I wanted to say fair.
2644045	2646688	It was pretty good, except the prices are too damn expensive.
2646968	2651672	10 bucks for a ticket, 25 bucks for a wristband, or 20 if you get a Coke can.
2652192	2653413	How much for a hot dog on a stick?
2654054	2655415	Don't ask, it's like 8 bucks or so.
2655455	2656676	How much for an egg roll on a stick?
2657116	2658097	And cheesecake on a stick?
2658550	2660631	Let's just say the lowest price for the... And your mom on a stick.
2661792	2662413	That's priceless.
2664374	2665335	Alright.
2665535	2666575	Okay, okay, okay.
2666916	2671819	Yeah, most of the stuff there is like not even... The least expensive is like six bucks.
2672399	2673260	And those are the funnel cakes.
2674821	2677403	The most expensive is like 25, just for regular dinner.
2677583	2681625	Oh, 25 bucks for one of those shitty little carts serving you dinner?
2682106	2683647	Yeah, one of them is that much.
2683667	2683807	Jeez.
2685296	2687157	Most of them you can see on the other restaurants.
2687257	2688597	There's only one that you cannot get.
2689058	2690238	It's only exclusive for State Fair.
2690258	2692119	And those are the funnel cakes and the fried Twinkies.
2692519	2693339	Yeah, the fried Twinkies.
2693359	2695981	Unless you know how to make them, then you can make the fried Twinkies yourself.
2696481	2700382	But funnel cakes is exclusive to the State Fair.
2701803	2702063	Oh yeah.
2704124	2704404	Alright.
2704644	2706725	And the fact that parking is expensive as hell.
2708586	2709847	Like seven bucks for parking.
2709947	2710667	Used to be like six.
2711707	2715848	And I'm assuming that there's a DDR arcade section at the State Fair on the kids section.
2715928	2723970	Oh yeah, don't they usually have DDR at the State Fair every year and people go to dance to show off and try to get crowds, the people that love attention and stuff?
2724531	2726691	Which I'm certainly not accepted from that.
2727131	2730612	I think it's on the Eastern Gate, I'm assuming.
2730792	2732153	Because I haven't been there yet.
2732913	2734933	Since I'm going there on a Saturday yet again.
2736274	2737834	There goes my wallet.
2740055	2740395	All right.
2741345	2743506	Wait, did you say you were going on Thursday, Jonas?
2744146	2744506	Saturday.
2744966	2746266	Damn, I'm going on Thursday.
2747006	2749187	Somebody in here knows why I'm going on Thursday.
2749227	2750587	Yes, I know what's going on Thursday.
2750607	2753268	There's a concert Thursday she wants to see.
2754108	2755108	Interesting.
2757129	2759629	Alright, anything else you want to share about your week and your day, Jonas?
2760409	2760769	Not much.
2760789	2762190	Just work, school.
2765350	2767031	And that's about it so far.
2767631	2768031	Fair enough.
2768894	2772196	Alright, I opened up the Skype line if anybody has a comment so far.
2772256	2775717	If you don't know anything about the Skype line, it's time to educate yourself.
2775757	2782441	Head on over to our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on that little tab that says interact with us.
2782541	2789044	Remember, when we're in that do not disturb mode with the little red circle with the line through it, it means do not disturb.
2789424	2790284	We're not taking calls.
2790865	2791645	But we are right now.
2791685	2792826	That icon's not on right now.
2792866	2793606	We are taking calls.
2794807	2796628	We're going to go to a break if nobody wants to call.
2796748	2797488	Ooh, we're getting a call.
2798976	2800657	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2803639	2804600	I hope we can hear this person.
2804620	2805140	Can you hear us?
2806661	2807321	Yes, I can.
2807421	2807802	There you are.
2807842	2809683	Oh, turn up your volume just a little bit more.
2810924	2811604	Who be's this?
2813245	2813986	Legend of Zaku.
2814626	2817668	It's Legend of Zaku calling in, but he's very, very quiet.
2817708	2820170	If there's any way you can turn up your mic volume, go for it.
2821190	2821430	Huh?
2821731	2822571	Oh, alright.
2823872	2824432	Yes, I can.
2824752	2825173	There we go.
2825193	2825893	A little bit better.
2826153	2826694	What's on your mind?
2828435	2828615	Huh?
2829505	2830345	What's on your mind?
2831326	2833267	I don't know, uh, let me see, I just moved.
2834408	2835188	You just moved?
2838890	2842672	I, uh... I think, ah, oh, yike!
2842752	2843773	Okay, I'm up?
2844073	2845193	Yes, I can hear you better now.
2845994	2846374	Alright.
2846754	2847835	What's up?
2849696	2858901	Uh... You know, I'm trying to prepare, I need help trying to, like... No, I just need help for a freestyle routine, because I have this big tournament in Jacob Javits Center in New York City...
2860646	2862647	He needs help with a freestyle routine.
2863288	2864789	What advice can he give to somebody?
2865069	2865850	I'll ask Jonas.
2865970	2867771	I have one suggestion.
2868832	2870433	Don't use an orange bat.
2870473	2871074	You will lose.
2871794	2873095	Yes, don't use an orange bat.
2873115	2873595	You'll lose.
2873996	2882882	Jamie and I know this from experience.
2883342	2884823	We're losing the connection, Zaku.
2885124	2885904	I'm going to let you go.
2885964	2886725	Tune into the show.
2886745	2887645	We'll answer your question.
2889026	2889727	Thanks for calling.
2890543	2893266	Alright, let's finish answering Zaku's question.
2893306	2894867	How do you prepare for a freestyle?
2895188	2896789	Jonas, what do you go through?
2896829	2899392	What are the motions you go through when you're preparing for a freestyle routine?
2899572	2902355	Okay, the first thing to do is, the best is to put a step chart.
2903396	2904697	That's my recommendation.
2904737	2910443	A step chart would work because you can tell what moves you want to do, you know, like a documentary.
2911304	2911464	Yeah.
2914058	2915678	Okay, I'm losing you, Jonas.
2916018	2917279	Grab the bottom of the microphone there.
2917959	2919320	Push that cord back in a little bit.
2919760	2920340	And try again.
2920420	2920801	Sorry, bud.
2920901	2921221	Hello?
2921641	2921841	Yes.
2922181	2922501	Does it work?
2922821	2923021	Yes.
2923562	2923882	Okay.
2924922	2925222	Damn it.
2925362	2926443	Oh, okay.
2926783	2930785	The best bet is to print a step chart, like ddrmain.com.
2930805	2932486	Look for the song you want.
2932906	2937988	Print out the step chart and use that as a document, which you want to do for the song itself.
2938962	2939242	All right.
2939382	2944246	Like you can write, ooh, I could do a spin here, or a splits, or wave your hands.
2945527	2948189	Okay, actually, yeah, he's correcting us in the chat room right now.
2948229	2949550	He doesn't want to know how to set it up.
2949590	2950050	Well, fine.
2950330	2951992	He wants to know what song he should do.
2952352	2953213	What song should he do?
2953273	2957916	What songs have not been used to all hell that are freestyable songs, in your opinion, Jonas?
2958517	2959938	Depends on what song he wants to do.
2960338	2968284	Like if he wants to do, like, hachas or salsa, like, he can go, like, La Bamba, La Copa de la Vida, or...
2970120	2970781	Anything like that.
2971361	2974444	I want to see a really good routine to Gamelan Day Couple, personally.
2975085	2977047	That was actually pretty tough, but it's doable.
2977687	2986035	If you want to do something like, um, like, oldies, like, sweet style, like, Heaven This Is 57 McTodd Grey would work.
2988277	2988758	Alrighty.
2989759	2992481	Hey, God, for the love of God, no, no knee dropping!
2993963	2994343	Alright.
2994443	2995244	I saw it, I'm...
2997114	2998095	It's Raining Men.
2998576	2999797	No comment.
2999857	3001058	Heck yeah, it's Raining Men.
3001118	3001558	Heck yeah.
3002359	3004661	I'm just reading the post of Unknown Gamers.
3006302	3009505	If you want to go feminist, just go for it.
3009525	3015691	It's Raining Men, I Do, I Do, I Do, Cowgirl, any of those B4U songs.
3018473	3021396	And if you want to go old school, just play anything that's from Naoki.
3023786	3024206	That works.
3024667	3024967	All right.
3025227	3028709	And if you want to challenge the hell out of yourself, play like those Maxes.
3032291	3032592	All right.
3033292	3034993	We're going to go ahead and go to a break here.
3036574	3043679	And in this break, since we were talking about Fifth Mix, I thought maybe we could, you know, respect Fifth Mix a little bit by playing some songs from it.
3043759	3047121	So we will be right back after this, you guys.
3056121	3056527	Thanks for watching!
3105712	3109474	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3237279	3243202	Alright, for this last song in the fifth mix break, Jamie wanted to play this one especially for you guys.
3243242	3245783	This is DarkSakura's pick just for you.
3245843	3249144	I love you guys so much that I thought that you'd really want to hear this.
3249244	3249944	So, there you go.
3293487	3315522	I think I did it again I made you believe We're more than just friends Oh baby
3332008	3343363	I played with your heart, got lost in the game Oh baby, baby, oh, you think I'm in love That I'm sent from above I'm not that innocent
3362575	3380207	I'm a fool in so many ways But you lose all my senses That is just so typically me Oh baby, ooh, oops, I did it again I played with your heart Got lost in this game Oh baby, baby, oops, you think I'm in love Then I'm running from it
3402252	3403573	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

3463556	3464938	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3464978	3466300	Here we are back with episode 109.
3466660	3472107	We were talking about freestyle a little bit before the break there.
3474518	3481740	And, um... Oh yeah, if you were wondering what the hell happened in the chatroom, if you were in our chatroom, orangehoundsradio.com, click on chat.
3482340	3483941	We had what's called a net split.
3484181	3485461	And this happens from time to time.
3485661	3489743	IRC, it's a bunch of computers all linked together for the purposes of chatting.
3490083	3492784	And when you connect to our server, you're connecting to one of them.
3493244	3495905	Well, sometimes the communication line breaks.
3496085	3498565	And that means half the people go one way and half the people go the other way.
3498905	3501986	So we had a little bit of a net split there, but it looks like it's fixed.
3502386	3503267	We're okay now.
3503467	3503987	So, um...
3505616	3506997	Don't be afraid of our chat room.
3507398	3510780	There's many other reasons to be afraid of our chat room other than the net splits, that's all.
3512722	3514523	Jamie picked that one just for you guys, by the way.
3514563	3515984	The Rochelle with the oops, I did it again.
3516825	3517585	People liked it.
3517966	3519827	Yeah, I threw in a little bit of the Bukkake thing, too.
3519867	3521828	Because Tom Brokaw likes Bukkake.
3521848	3522269	Yes, he does.
3522429	3523770	You heard it here on Orange Challenge Radio.
3523830	3526592	I'm going to run this joke into the ground tonight.
3526952	3528854	I like having jokes so we can run into the ground.
3529054	3531015	Crash happened in Bukkake.
3536960	3538380	Tom Brokaw's getting old.
3539361	3541901	He's been doing news since I was five.
3542081	3543222	He's quitting, finally.
3543722	3544362	Like, this year, I think.
3544382	3544982	He needs to retire.
3545342	3546203	Him and Dan Rather.
3547183	3548183	Dan Rather's still doing the news.
3549564	3551084	You know, Phil Donahue got his clue.
3551164	3551804	He ended his show.
3553365	3553645	Way back.
3553765	3555565	But then he got a new one on another network.
3555585	3555625	No.
3555665	3556366	And then it tanked.
3556466	3556886	Yes, he did.
3556906	3558846	He was on MSNBC for about three months.
3559226	3559787	And then it tanked.
3560107	3561927	Because they got too used to his talk show.
3562908	3564348	See, once you go, you know...
3565000	3567861	Public Mass, you know, audience, you can never go back.
3568802	3569182	It's over.
3569842	3571363	That's why Ricky Lake will never act again.
3572944	3574525	Except in John Waters movies, and that's okay.
3574545	3575545	Except in John Waters movies.
3576166	3578587	There's a new John Waters movie coming out soon, I'm so excited.
3578807	3580828	It's NC-17, so it's back to his roots.
3581688	3582229	Good stuff.
3583529	3583809	Alright.
3585270	3589632	Anyway, I thought we could actually talk about some actual Bomani news that's going on this week.
3590893	3591333	Didn't we finish?
3591353	3591733	How was your week?
3591753	3592093	How was your day?
3592294	3593034	Oh, that's right, we did.
3593931	3595533	I'm like drugs, remember?
3595573	3597134	Yeah, Jamie's on drugs tonight, you guys.
3598075	3602659	Since we about doubled our listeners since the start of the show, why don't you explain to everybody what's going on, Jamie?
3602859	3603840	My nose hates me.
3604340	3608244	I've been, like, major allergy attack since, like, Friday.
3608925	3614269	So I'm on Dayquil and Tylenol allergy sinus and this Afrin stuff that you shoot up into your nose.
3615150	3617252	And then this Vic stuff that looks like a dildo.
3617392	3617773	Look at this.
3618653	3620455	I got this, one of those little...
3620993	3625715	It has the Vicks stuff in it so you inhale the fumes when you put Vicks on your nose.
3626275	3628576	But if you take the wrapper off of it, it looks like a dildo.
3628616	3631097	I put it up on the cam before, doesn't it?
3631557	3633578	That kind of looks like a tampon.
3633698	3635099	It does sort of look like a tampon, too.
3635739	3637000	Can I go put that on our webcam?
3637020	3637880	Yeah, I did it once.
3638040	3640661	Here, put it on the cam again.
3641562	3646324	Join our site at orangeloungeradio.com and you can see the webcam right on the front page.
3646384	3648805	I'm going to go show off this nasty little thing.
3650175	3660197	I got another drug, I got Benadryl now, and they have Dayquil Sinus, so I'm taking that too.
3662677	3667058	Don't put that, Rob, I had that in my, Rob is sick.
3669338	3670819	Rob put a tampon in his nose.
3676200	3677800	Ew, Rob, you didn't like that?
3680865	3682706	That wasn't really in my nose, Jesus.
3683566	3684187	Alright.
3684647	3688128	But, um, I don't know what I like, what I hate more.
3688629	3693411	Because I've been, like, sniffy-drippy all day, and my nose had this burn in it, like I had to sneeze.
3694171	3695572	I sneezed the whole way here.
3695592	3699033	I nearly ran into some truck that was carrying, like, panes of glass.
3699553	3700554	I thought I was going to die.
3701434	3703155	Um, by the way, Rob, will you put this back on the show for me?
3703175	3703415	Oh, my bad.
3703435	3703715	Thank you.
3705616	3709578	Um, so I took Benadryl right before I came in, and I've had ice cream.
3710316	3716361	So, I'm hoping that they counteract each other, but if I fall into a coma halfway through the show, blame the drugs.
3717002	3719724	I'll be just like Ozzy Osbourne, back when he was cool.
3720925	3722486	He's still cool, what are you talking about?
3723647	3724368	You know what's funny?
3724508	3735337	In my law book, because I'm taking business law, they brought up that case from the 80s where the kid listened to the Ozzy Osbourne suicide song and shot himself.
3735357	3736999	Ah-ha.
3738010	3738411	Law is funny.
3757290	3757630	Okay.
3757731	3760974	Anyway, I'm just going all the way off on tangents.
3760994	3761574	That's all right.
3761614	3762095	That's all right.
3762355	3767520	And Legend of Takuno, the one that I'm referring to was Ozzy Osbourne because I did my homework and read my book.
3767861	3769382	So they talked about an Ozzy Osbourne case.
3769903	3770884	About the song that's...
3772890	3778654	It was, uh, no, I read the goddamn book, don't argue with me, okay?
3779355	3783178	You are not taking my business law class, I am taking the business law class.
3783618	3786540	They referred to, Ozzy Osbourne's first name is John, okay?
3786961	3793926	It had him by his name in my goddamn book, and it was freaking, okay, do not argue with me because I am always right, okay?
3795607	3798950	It was an Osbourne case where it was a song about how easy it is to kill yourself.
3799550	3801452	About you can slowly drink yourself to death.
3802910	3828282	and then it was and the guy killed himself and his parents were trying to blame Ozzy Osbourne for killing himself for killing the kid but they actually it got turned over because it was had they ruled in the parents favor it would have been a violation of the constitutional right for freedom of speech by the way speaking of freedom of speech
3830103	3830443	Yes.
3830463	3830903	Yes.
3830944	3831044	Yes.
3851795	3871086	The federal government basically, well, the Ninth Court of Appeals basically turned over that the person-to-person share programs like BitTorrent, BearShare, LimeWire, those like that, are legal.
3872067	3880052	Also, they shot down the plans that they were wanting to do in the copyright laws because it would...
3881418	3889704	I think some of the commercial law under the constitution and I think it's pretty neat.
3890204	3901112	And the ironic thing is that the 9th Court of Appeals though also was the one that did the Napster case back in the day.
3902313	3908377	But yeah, I was peeking through the news and I saw that and that was really cool.
3909418	3909618	So...
3911403	3911743	Alright.
3912163	3912964	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
3912984	3913424	No, that's alright.
3913964	3915165	That affects all of us.
3916166	3916866	That affects the show.
3916886	3917847	I know you all pirate.
3918467	3924870	They're also saying that, you know, like what we did through Life 365, perfectly fine.
3925030	3925251	Yeah.
3925711	3928012	Well, what we did through Life 365 was always legal.
3928752	3929513	So, anyway.
3929533	3929713	Yep.
3930137	3934540	Anyway, I want to get into some Bomani news, some actual Bomani news that's going on in the Bomani world this week.
3934980	3942946	And one of the biggest stories actually broke on Monday, so it's almost old news to a lot of you guys right now, but I kind of want to talk about some of the repercussions behind this.
3943927	3947549	For those of you that may not have heard, get out from under your rock, and here's what's going on.
3947669	3953713	GamePro.com ran this article on Monday that talked about the upcoming DDR Extreme that we're all getting in the US.
3954134	3956615	And in this article, it included some screenshots.
3957256	3957496	Well...
3958385	3969272	Whoopsie daisy, somebody let them have a copy of the already unlocked version of the game and because they showed off the screenshots, they blew about 18 of the unlocks.
3970512	3980859	And I know for, well, I guess I shouldn't say this, I know this for a fact, but I know that one of them was kind of one of the ones that I think Konami kind of wanted to keep a surprise.
3980999	3984401	And that was You're Not Here by Heather from Silent Hill 3.
3985029	3988150	Konami kind of wanted that to be a surprise when the game actually comes out.
3988530	3988810	Whoops!
3988910	3989831	Cover got blown on that one.
3990871	4006336	As well as the cover got blown on 321 Stars, A, Absolute, B4U, the B4ZA beatmix, Trip Machine, Trip Machine Survivor, Sugaru, V, and of course you're not here, and the article went ahead and said, oh by the way, Maximizer's in the game.
4007537	4008317	What did I say?
4008678	4009578	What did I say?
4009938	4010779	What did I say?
4011239	4012280	Uh-huh, I think so.
4012740	4014801	Now you should listen to me, you fucking idiots.
4016282	4019484	Now, for those that just started listening to the show, what exactly do you mean by that?
4020244	4023346	I only called Maximizer, like, what, how many months ago?
4024426	4025326	How many months ago?
4025506	4027227	It was like at least three or four months ago?
4027787	4028948	Probably even before that?
4029268	4041552	I think it was when DDR Extreme came out for the Japanese console system, so whatever the fuck that was, probably... I don't know, but I called it a long-ass time ago, and everyone said, No!
4041612	4044953	That's so wrong because Max Period's the last one!
4045093	4045733	But, ha!
4045953	4046613	I was right!
4047534	4048234	I was right!
4050375	4051015	I like being right.
4052820	4057065	Uh, message from the chatroom, UnknownGamer says, tell Loki to shut the fuck up, he's a dork.
4059467	4060228	WE BAN YOU!
4061889	4069397	Alright, um, I'll play You're Not Here for those guys who haven't heard it, because this is an Akira Yamaoka song, it rocks, from Silent Hill 3, I will play that in this next break, but...
4070314	4071334	What do you guys think about this?
4071835	4074015	Oh, I forgot to say Sugaru Apple Mix, my bad.
4074476	4074896	Who cares?
4075036	4075316	Alright.
4075896	4082299	Oh, but then the screenshots also revealed that some of the Oni songs now have basic Trip Maniac steps, but some don't.
4082759	4083519	Like the Wild Rush?
4083859	4084119	Don't.
4084639	4087260	But I think, I want to say it was Sugaru?
4087561	4087841	Does.
4089181	4089741	What's up with that?
4090462	4091882	Yeah, the Apple Mix does.
4092763	4093963	Well, I think it was the Apple Mix.
4093983	4096584	I know one of them I was looking at had basic Maniac
4098431	4101894	And it was like, okay, so they went and did them for some, but not for others.
4103335	4115505	It might even be for you, the Before the Beat mix, and I know Hysteria2001, they have basic trick and maniac steps thanks to, what was it, the Dancing Stage games.
4116245	4119228	So, it's very possible those might be your mixed steps.
4120812	4121333	This is true.
4121593	4125376	Somebody told me that the Love at First Sight, you know how the maniac steps were in?
4126097	4129300	There were maniac steps in Dancing Stage, but they were really easy.
4129320	4130080	It was like a four-footer.
4130801	4135165	That is the exact same steps as Max 2 USA's trick steps.
4136426	4137507	Somebody told me that a while back.
4137547	4140970	I never went back to verify that, but it sounds legit.
4141770	4142151	Interesting.
4142231	4142471	Anyway.
4146124	4149205	But I don't know, any reaction to this?
4149265	4158628	Because I was kind of, with all the clue giving, you know how those folks that work at Konami, they like to give clues, and we had Sigurd here a couple weeks ago, and he was kind of telling us why they don't go to the extreme threat anymore.
4158648	4165009	But nonetheless, they give out clues, they work hard to keep this stuff a secret, and then, kaboom, it's all spoiled.
4166190	4166950	What do you guys think about that?
4168150	4172451	I think it's hilarious, trusting GamePro with anything, because that magazine sucks.
4173472	4173972	Yeah, me too.
4174758	4176580	They don't even provide free demos.
4176620	4177561	What the hell is that?
4178563	4179103	God damn it.
4179283	4185711	If you want to stay competitive at this day and age, you need to provide free demo discs so that people can steal them out of your magazines.
4190154	4194277	If you have a comment, you can call in on our Skype line if you have something you want to say.
4195998	4199880	Oh, I'm being told that the challenge songs do not have new steps.
4200020	4201661	Well, let me see where I got that from.
4204043	4206024	It was somewhere in that preview story.
4206104	4207545	It talks about the screenshots.
4207565	4208406	Let's see if I can find it.
4209907	4215070	Where one of them had... I'm going to the site, and I'm going to post the link in the chat room if I can find them.
4215811	4216211	There they are.
4217324	4219085	Sugru Apple Mix, light, standard, heavy.
4219705	4220206	Oh, right there.
4222207	4223988	And they say the screenshot is off-center.
4224248	4227870	Oh, so maybe somebody was scrolling around or something was going on there.
4228310	4229451	So maybe that's what happened there.
4230411	4230971	Not sure.
4232432	4232872	Interesting.
4233553	4239836	Well, looking at it that way, it does look like the song's a little bit off, so maybe the steps hadn't updated yet.
4239896	4240376	Who knows?
4241197	4246720	All right, well, nevertheless, it's adding fuel to the fire that there are hidden steps.
4247398	4249100	And Ultramix 2, there we go.
4264998	4267220	GamePro kind of blowing the lid on this stuff.
4268381	4271104	Do you think it could affect them getting demos from Konami in the future?
4271124	4274587	Or do you think Konami's just kind of like, eh, we were done with the extreme people anyway.
4275007	4275447	Forget it.
4276728	4277669	Let the list be spoiled.
4277709	4278450	Or what do you guys think?
4284355	4285536	It was bound to happen anyway.
4286157	4287778	Because you know that always happens.
4288219	4291982	Someone's going to leak a list or something is going to happen that's going to just totally throw off the plan.
4293740	4305144	Although, honestly, I really think that before you print any screen captures or anything, you should run it by, you know, the people who are giving you the authority to do the article.
4305424	4305644	Right.
4305664	4309065	Yeah, that's very true.
4309285	4309606	Very true.
4310966	4312026	Let's go to the Skype line.
4312287	4314967	Zaku's trying to call back, so let's see if we can hear him now.
4314987	4315688	What's up, Zaku?
4316968	4318109	I'm hearing... Hold on.
4318149	4318729	I'm hearing that...
4319815	4323377	You know, I'm hearing Starmine is going to be up for Ultramix 2, is that true?
4323397	4325037	Is there any other Beatmania 2DX songs confirmed?
4325057	4325178	Wow.
4325218	4325418	I mean...
4342113	4353262	some other beat manias actually we're going to talk about Ultramix 2 in a little bit but those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head but there are brand new ones that are in Ultramix 2 it's pretty cool okay anything else?
4354623	4370876	let me see I'm trying to think right on the light was another one thank you Jason alright alright well if you think of it if you think of it call us back later dude
4371939	4372719	All right, bye.
4374220	4376160	So, yes, Ultramix 2.
4376200	4380841	A nice little segue in Ultramix 2 because we did get some new songs announced for Ultramix 2 this week.
4381641	4382822	We had two songs announced.
4382942	4390123	Paul Oakenfold doing an Elvis remix of Rubberneckin', which was a fairly popular hit a couple months ago, earlier this year.
4390623	4392044	So it's kind of neat to see that in DDR.
4392244	4393984	And we have a Beatmania song.
4394024	4398045	From Beatmania the final, we have an Athletics song that was confirmed.
4398405	4401070	and the song is Hit and Slap and I'm going to play that for you guys right now.
4401111	4402253	It's only like a little over a minute.
4402593	4407784	So here it is, something you'll be dancing to in Ultra Mix 2 this fall, Athletics with Hit and Slap.
4433032	4433874	Thank you for watching!
4460586	4463919	B-Track, HudaWa, Muscatra, Control Your Messalance, WayUnaida
4487523	4491188	Athletics with Hit and Slap, a new song announced for Ultramix 2 this week.
4491628	4496975	Kind of some mixed reaction there in our chatroom that, boy, it's rap, and usually you don't hear a lot of that in DDR.
4497296	4501381	Well, I remember when Sigurd was here, he said that Ultramix 2 was kind of...
4502065	4502606	Echo Image with Skulk
4537561	4542588	and of course a song we were lucky enough to be able to announce on air, Zonk with Tittle Tattle.
4564617	4568682	So it's a little weird, but I kind of like it.
4568723	4570144	It's got a different little sound to it.
4570164	4572888	I think it could be fun for DDR with the right steps.
4573268	4580258	And they have promised us, the folks that made Ultramix 2, that the steps this time, different people making them, going to be different stuff.
4580931	4581752	Going to be good stuff.
4581792	4583113	So we will soon see.
4583213	4586235	This November is when they rumored that that game would be out.
4586335	4587095	So we will see.
4589317	4590558	So let's see.
4590618	4593640	Should we go to a break and play the other songs we said we'd play?
4593660	4594781	All right, why not?
4595233	4602338	We're going to play in this break Akira Yamaoka with You're Not Here, which is going to be a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme USA.
4602358	4603319	We're going to play that for you guys.
4603659	4609143	And then we're going to play Paul Oakenfold with Elvis and Rubberneckin, because that's going to be in DDR Ultra Mix 2.
4609183	4610744	So you get a little bit of both mixes.
4611224	4617668	And actually, I encourage you all to go vote in the poll on our website right now, because we're kind of taking a little poll over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4617708	4618869	Look in the upper right-hand corner.
4619410	4621011	I'm kind of curious, which...
4621867	4624628	One of these two mixes, are you planning on buying this fall?
4624708	4625548	Or are you going to buy them both?
4625568	4626848	Or are you going to buy neither one?
4627289	4630369	Go to OrangeLawnsRadio.com and look up in the upper right-hand corner.
4630449	4635511	Right now, 41% plan to buy DDR Extreme.
4635531	4637371	41% also plan to buy both mixes.
4637751	4638392	That's pretty good.
4638972	4642653	And only 6% plan to buy Ultra Mix 2 only.
4643113	4646434	So it sounds like most people that get Ultra Mix 2 are buying Extreme as well.
4646554	4647194	Kind of interesting.
4647674	4649735	But go vote in our poll.
4650155	4650935	OrangeLawnsRadio.com
4651704	4652524	All right, here we go.
4652544	4657306	We're going to go to this break, and we'll start off with Kiri Yamoka from DDR Extreme USA.
4657386	4658647	You're not here.
4658707	4662788	These, by the way, are full versions, so they're about three minutes in length, not the DDR edits.
4662848	4663268	We'll be back.
4664969	4666049	We'll be back.
4690151	4702299	Blue sky to forever, green grass blows in the wind It would be a much better sight with you, with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along
4719090	4720871	So now what should I do?
4721091	4733537	I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches now that you're gone My sublime fell through You let me give me everything you had and more You craved my happiness when you made me feel torn
4747270	4747712	and many more.
4782486	4783687	Thank you for watching.
4783887	4784588	See you next time.
4873869	4879695	And now, as promised, from Ultramix 2, Elvis Presley vs. Paul Oakenfold, Rubberneckin'.
4911764	4922589	That's all right with me Look and listen, baby My philosophy Call up and back and baby That's all right with me They don't really know Like what I see See why all I count
4966844	4967385	Thank you.
5032661	5033882	Thank you for watching.
5056058	5057098	Thank you for watching!
5089358	5094227	From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
5094287	5097473	Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!
5103223	5105205	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
5106145	5108848	Certainly a different style of music there in Ultramix 2.
5109288	5110449	I think it's pretty cool, though.
5110469	5111710	I like the direction they're going in.
5112010	5115433	I think a lot of people are kind of getting sick of all the... Now, not me, personally.
5115453	5125842	I love the trance music and the Japanese mixes and stuff, but I think some people... I think there was a call out there for some different stuff, and Ultramix 2 is certainly stepping up and answering that call, so I think it's pretty cool.
5126122	5129365	Honestly, I have to say that I was getting kind of tired of the trance myself, but
5129793	5130794	How could you get tired of trance?
5131094	5133315	But that's not to say Ultramix 2 won't have its share of trance.
5133375	5134216	I mean, it does have some trance.
5134276	5136517	I'm just getting tired of the happy stuff.
5137197	5140679	You know, like, love, love, sugar, cavity.
5141400	5142640	You know, that type of stuff.
5143341	5144101	And speed mixes.
5144201	5146923	I like the occasional speed mix, but, like, too many of them.
5149424	5152546	Hold on, Rice Princess is calling into the station, wants to say something.
5152586	5152966	What's up?
5155128	5155688	Are you there?
5158732	5160692	Alright, if you can hear us, we can't hear you.
5161573	5163133	Double check your mic and call us back.
5166393	5166653	Bummer.
5168134	5178675	Alright, also as a reminder, when you call us, when our little red circle is on, we're probably not going to see your call because when we're in Do Not Disturb mode, that means we're doing other pieces of show.
5178936	5180196	It means we're doing naughty things.
5180636	5183476	Irene lucked out and I happened to be glancing over when she was calling in there.
5184216	5185597	But it didn't work, that's alright.
5186497	5187397	We'll get back to her later.
5188216	5195298	Meanwhile, I actually wanted to mention this before the show tonight, and I actually kind of want to make doing this a regular thing.
5195538	5197898	Remember how I talked about starting up the Ultramix League?
5199698	5204099	I was actually online on DDR Ultramix before tonight's show, and it was actually kind of fun.
5205119	5208500	Yes, there are still people, believe it or not, that are playing Ultramix.
5208680	5209220	It's amazing.
5211041	5215802	And I was on there playing, and that was the first time you'd ever really seen that in action, huh, DDR Angel?
5215842	5216302	You saw that.
5216382	5217442	What'd you think of that, Angel?
5218002	5219062	The Ultramix stuff.
5219883	5223844	I know I put the voices through the TV for a little bit, too, although you can barely hear it, but what did you think of that?
5224204	5225845	I thought it was really cool.
5226005	5227045	I kind of want one now, see?
5227525	5232687	But then again, I said that last week, so it looks like I need to save up my paychecks and just go for it.
5232947	5235308	Just get everything in a big, fat bundle.
5237909	5244851	If I need to save up until Ultramix 2 comes out, I'll do that, and I'll just buy 1 and 2, the system, just everything, and play.
5245686	5247667	So you have a DDR buddy now.
5253650	5254330	Alright.
5254910	5265015	Also, what I noticed about Ultramix that I thought was kind of funny is that there's people on there that love to sing along to the songs with their Xbox headsets on so that you can hear.
5265115	5272378	And like, I was playing Count Stop Falling in Love and I heard this girl going, Kids of our love, kids of our love.
5273829	5275411	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5290071	5291531	Oh yeah, blame me It's all my fault I blame you
5323604	5326347	I invoke female privilege to just offer my opinion.
5327208	5331713	I'm laying down like this so that one side of my nose will drain into the other and I won't be all stuffed up.
5333655	5333875	Huh?
5334195	5334876	I'm not on camera.
5335036	5335457	My feet are.
5338420	5338740	All right.
5341018	5342618	Look at the webcam, see my feet!
5342698	5344219	Have you played DDRXbox at all?
5344839	5348100	Um, I haven't even unwrapped the shrink wrapping off of it.
5348360	5349560	You should, sometime.
5349920	5355242	I was gonna go download the songpacks, but I got school, I do stuff now.
5356322	5360463	Well, I only played for like 30 minutes before the show, it wasn't that much.
5360983	5367405	I would actually sign on to Xbox Live and play live on the show, but I don't know how well the voices would come out.
5368373	5370014	I don't know, should we try logging on right now?
5370094	5370814	See if anybody's on?
5371434	5372514	Sounds like a good time waster.
5375155	5376656	No, Matt doesn't want to try it.
5376736	5377136	Fine.
5379897	5381237	I thought it could be an interesting piece.
5382018	5383858	Let's wait and do it when we know it'll work.
5384738	5386239	I'm sure it'll work, it's just...
5386917	5388338	I don't think it makes for great radio.
5388358	5391440	The only problem with it is that the music drowns out the people talking.
5391840	5401806	I think it would be hilarious if we could go on there and mess with people live on air, but unfortunately the music of the songs, they totally drown out the voices if you're running it through the TV, so I don't think it's going to work.
5404988	5405308	Oh well.
5408910	5410931	This poster is disturbing and frightening.
5411952	5412272	What one?
5412292	5415694	One for Rojin Z, which I've always wanted to see that and never have.
5417665	5419305	It's a really creepy thing.
5419325	5420506	It's a creepy old man.
5421186	5425227	So anyway, my call to those of you that play on Xbox Live, please stop singing.
5426507	5429148	Or wait until Karaoke Revolution Xbox comes out.
5430068	5431068	I am so getting that.
5432809	5434989	See, now the chat room is saying do it.
5435649	5437010	They want us to try it and do it.
5439490	5440510	I should have kept my mouth shut.
5440811	5441791	Maybe after the cage match.
5442211	5444251	I want to give Loki time to set it up if we're going to do it.
5444631	5446772	Alright, we're going to do the cage match first though.
5450255	5453496	Uh, we will do... Hold on, I'm trying to find Holic.
5454277	5455077	I vote for Holic.
5455457	5459639	We have to set up our wires if we're going to get on DDR Ultramix, so... Hey, Rob.
5459679	5459879	What?
5460199	5464941	If I, like, bring Holic and then, like, add, like, an extra beat to the end, does that count as a remix so I can use Holic?
5465261	5465521	No.
5466121	5466582	Damn.
5468662	5469003	All right.
5469963	5470543	Uh, let's see.
5470603	5473664	We're going to go on to the cage match.
5473704	5475125	I've got to get the song skewed up, though.
5476550	5479112	Before we get to the cage match, let's plug our spin-off shows.
5479533	5482475	Monday night, Diversion, 7 o'clock, Bomani Remixes.
5483116	5483656	It rocks.
5483777	5484978	Listen to it or you suck.
5485158	5485718	Tuesday night.
5486579	5487800	Is Pump Up the Volume?
5489662	5495587	It's supposed to start at 7 for a pre-show, but I usually get really bored and start things around a quarter till, sometimes 6.30.
5495627	5500271	Of course, that's a specific time for all of our other time zone people.
5500291	5501493	7.30 starts the real show.
5503502	5507465	Because I now have to get up for work at 5.30 in the morning the next day.
5508126	5511008	I have been cutting it off right at 10.30, 11 o'clock.
5511969	5520075	You know, if I don't have to do anything the next day, or, you know, if I don't foresee the need for sleep, I'll just keep going, because I'll be like, oh, wait, I'm still running the show, huh?
5520856	5525980	It's supposed to be a request show, but it's really been more or less me just marathoning types of music.
5526421	5528662	The past few weeks I've been playing whole albums.
5529523	5532946	In fact, this past Tuesday I played the Silent Hill 4 US soundtrack.
5534244	5534744	Maren-chan
5562847	5563968	Thanks for watching!
5590049	5592350	So, definitely tune in for that.
5592450	5594812	Okay, do you want to do Xbox Live before or after Cage Match?
5595592	5596172	Let's do it after.
5596192	5596393	After.
5596413	5597513	Because I said we were going to do after.
5597833	5599674	We'll get some folks some time to sign on there too.
5599694	5601956	Although, we don't want to play against people we know.
5602016	5604637	We want to play against random people so we can mess with them.
5604697	5606778	So don't log on just trying to find us.
5606818	5609920	It's a good thing my name on Xbox Live isn't Orange Lounge Radio or something.
5610280	5611881	So people won't know which one's me.
5611901	5612421	So that's good.
5612441	5613722	Isn't it going to be awesome?
5613962	5614182	What?
5614943	5618665	If, uh, like, they make microphones and shit for, um...
5619707	5628472	The Xbox, you know, karaoke game, and we can plug it in where, like, you know, the normal, um, you know, headset thing would go.
5629213	5633315	Um, I might be able to wire something where our output can go into there.
5633656	5636818	You know, while they're playing, you know, that'd be fun.
5637818	5647144	Well, you know, I think you can use just a normal, um, micro, the small jack ones on your, uh, controller.
5647164	5647244	Okay.
5648004	5648544	Hmm.
5648744	5652726	Yeah, because I broke my headset one time for PSO.
5653286	5653846	Interesting.
5653866	5656127	And we just went, there was one that got like a radio shack.
5656727	5657547	Maybe we can do something.
5657567	5657808	All right.
5658108	5661689	Well, anyway, let's get to the gauge match so we can do the Xbox Live thing.
5664088	5668070	Alright, the way the cage match works, we have some new people listening tonight, so let me explain this.
5668370	5670350	We're going to play three songs for you guys.
5670490	5672351	Each host brings one song to the table.
5672791	5679914	You pick your favorite of the three songs by placing a private vote in our chat room, www.orangelondradio.com.
5679934	5682955	Click on chat and our kind regulars there will tell you how to place a vote.
5683375	5687957	Remember, you can't vote until all three songs have been played, so wait for me to tell you to vote before you vote.
5689693	5690413	Three songs.
5690933	5695515	You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because, you know, it's the winner and you heard it last week.
5695535	5696356	So you only get to hear a clip.
5696696	5707061	And last week's winner in this case was... Loki with two-time champion Nuon, which is by, supposedly it's by Outphase.
5707121	5707801	By Phase Out.
5708221	5712363	But we know that the MP3 had to have been mislabeled, so we're calling it Phase Out.
5712955	5717859	So, Phase Out is our two-week-in-a-row winner, and here it is, a clip of last week's winner.
5717899	5720542	Song number one you can vote for tonight, Phase Out with Nuon.
5777665	5778266	Thanks for watching!
5874739	5877841	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
5877881	5879862	That was Outphase with Nuon.
5879902	5883064	Song number two comes from... That's not Outphase, actually.
5883104	5883664	It's Phase Out.
5883684	5886186	We're calling it... Song number two comes to us from Jamie.
5887907	5889948	Okay, Jamie, you want me to introduce your song, then?
5890869	5892870	Jamie has brought to the table Bond.
5893210	5896452	You know, those four chicks with the violins that play classical music.
5897112	5898453	And it's called Shine.
5898833	5900314	It's the dub Chakra mix.
5900354	5903136	And the reason why she picked this one is, well, she likes...
5904502	5906303	Yeah, but it has samples from Afronova.
5907844	5909444	It has samples from Afronova in it.
5909905	5913586	And for those that said she picked this song already, she's saying it's a different mix.
5913726	5914407	And I think it is.
5915527	5916408	Oh, you picked a different one.
5916428	5916708	Alright.
5916928	5921130	Well, it has Bond and samples of Afronova, so see if you like it.
5921810	5926953	Although it's not really samples of Afronova, it's just the fact... Yeah, they're public domain samples that Afronova also used.
5926973	5932936	The one that I used before was... It started off with a really...
5934232	5935473	I'll play it on Tuesday.
5935513	5936794	I picked a different song before.
5937294	5937554	All right.
5937894	5938235	It's fine.
5938595	5938875	Here it is.
5938915	5942017	I played this one on the show before to play the samples.
5942457	5942577	Right.
5942697	5943378	I remember that.
5943458	5943898	I remember that.
5943938	5944238	All right.
5944699	5945099	Here we go.
5945219	5949441	Bond with Shine, the Dub Chakra mix with that same sample in Afronova.
5949562	5949782	All right.
5949802	5950022	Here we go.
5965275	5966078	Thanks for watching!
6195806	6199108	Alright, that was song number two.
6200909	6204650	Tonight's cage match, that was Bond with Shine, the Dub Chakra mix.
6207752	6208712	What do you guys think of that one?
6210233	6213975	I really like that song, it's just really laid back, I listen to it all the time.
6215996	6218097	It gets a 9 from me, I mean I've listened to it a whole bunch.
6218860	6224725	but I intended to use it for cage match once and never did so I just figured I may as well do it now.
6224745	6225846	I played it on my show a few times.
6227187	6229389	I just really think it's different.
6229469	6230190	It's really different.
6233713	6234994	Alright, moving on.
6235634	6235995	Jonas.
6236975	6237896	I give it a 9 out of 10.
6237936	6239057	It's pretty good, soothing.
6239197	6240759	I don't have that Afronuva part I heard.
6242920	6247064	Other than that, it's very well done with the violin and all that stuff.
6249293	6249553	All right.
6250734	6251614	A scale of 110?
6252814	6253054	Oh, no.
6253094	6253394	I'm sorry.
6253414	6253934	I missed the knife.
6254075	6255475	Sorry.
6255575	6255815	Angel?
6257636	6257956	Damn it.
6258016	6258296	Okay.
6258316	6258876	The mic's working.
6258916	6259336	There we go.
6259376	6262177	I heard myself.
6262197	6262177	9.5.
6262857	6263197	It's cool.
6263457	6263837	I like it.
6264298	6264798	It's Bond.
6265738	6266598	That's like a given.
6267679	6267999	All right.
6268479	6268739	Loki?
6272805	6274125	It's okay.
6274225	6280627	Honestly, the samples of whatever, Afronova, the tribal people do not fit in the song at all.
6281488	6284709	But, whatever, you know, it's Bond.
6285969	6287730	So I'm going to give it a lower score because it's Bond.
6287750	6289910	Because Bond doesn't do any original shit.
6290711	6292011	Anyway, so they're going to get a 7.
6292191	6297733	Okay, because I just, you know, I've heard that song and I'm just tired of them.
6298013	6299273	You know, they can stop anytime.
6301434	6301854	Uh, Bradley.
6302421	6303302	I thought it was really cool.
6303342	6304043	What was the beat?
6304503	6304984	Give it a 9.
6306365	6307746	I actually like that song a lot.
6307786	6308427	It's a song.
6308647	6311510	I'm just not sure I'm down with it for like a cage match.
6311970	6312331	I don't know.
6312991	6315013	It's bouncy, dancey as the others.
6315734	6317075	I think it would be very freestyle-able.
6317095	6317996	We were talking about that.
6318637	6319077	I give it an 8.
6319978	6321079	As a song, I give it a 9.
6321159	6322160	As a cage match pick, I give it an 8.
6322801	6323121	Alright.
6324262	6324723	My turn.
6325343	6332105	and I've picked a song by a band that's actually already in rotation on our station because they were on one of the Fantasia albums.
6332465	6333906	They're a really popular trance band.
6333926	6336066	They're on Robbins Entertainment here in the U.S.
6336146	6341808	Same label as Ian Vandal and Paul Oaken... No, he's not on that label.
6342148	6345809	Ian Vandal and DJ Sammy is another big one on that label.
6346429	6348430	I'm kind of surprised they haven't ended up in DDR yet.
6348470	6352371	The band is Lasko and this is their brand new single that just came out.
6352856	6354178	It's called Surrender.
6354599	6355540	Just came out in the U.S.
6355700	6356441	this week, actually.
6356461	6358264	It's been out in Britain a little while, but just came out in the U.S.
6358284	6358564	this week.
6358965	6361088	It's my pick, Lasko with Surrender.
6361288	6361609	Enjoy.
6396815	6402459	I said I can't trust you, I don't know Every time I'm near you, I lose control I must be out of my mind to let you in
6478677	6480498	Thank you for watching!
6554997	6557239	Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
6557279	6559661	That was Lasko with Surrender.
6559781	6560982	Let's see what everybody thought of that.
6561042	6561322	Jamie.
6562903	6566486	I'm going to say the same thing that I say every week.
6567687	6568348	Trance is old.
6569609	6570650	Trance is very boring.
6571710	6576154	You have to be in the mood for it and too much is too much of anything.
6576214	6577315	However, that was still good.
6577615	6578296	I like the song.
6579156	6583560	But I'm just so burned out on Trance right now that I can't
6584420	6587842	I actually heard this song before in one of the Dream Dance volumes, I think.
6588002	6588402	I'll give it an 8.5.
6588482	6589363	I have some repeated samples.
6611727	6617588	It kind of sounded a little repetitive, but the singing was pretty good, and it still sounds pretty good.
6618128	6618468	All right.
6619088	6619368	Angel.
6620068	6621169	Well, let's see.
6621249	6624809	You know I'm a Lascaux fangirl, so you know it's going to get a 10 from me.
6625889	6626950	At least I got one supporter.
6626990	6627270	All right.
6627290	6628350	10 from Angel.
6628410	6628730	Loki.
6630030	6632010	It gets a 10 because it's not Bond.
6634531	6634811	Ouch.
6635891	6636611	And a glare.
6636631	6638111	I see a glare coming from Jamie.
6639472	6639812	All right.
6639832	6640472	Arcadian.
6640512	6640972	Arcadian.
6642026	6642766	I don't know.
6642786	6646368	To me, it's like the quintessential trance pop song.
6646388	6649969	Like if somebody were to say, Rob, play me some trance pop, I'd play that.
6650009	6650289	I like it.
6650309	6650550	It's cute.
6650570	6652310	I give it a 9.
6662446	6662746	Alright.
6664147	6664687	Okay, here it is.
6664707	6666907	We're going to recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
6668168	6673069	Let's see if Nuon goes three weeks in a row, or if we get Bond or Lasko as the new champ tonight.
6673129	6673649	Here we go.
6673750	6674430	Here's a recap.
6674470	6677151	Song number one, Phase Out with Nuon.
6679611	6680532	I always pick that clip.
6680552	6680932	I don't like it.
6689008	6693330	Song number two tonight is Bond with Shine, the dub Chakra Mix.
6707837	6711279	And song number three tonight is Lasko with Surrender.
6724856	6728058	Alright guys, place vote now.
6728158	6735382	You may place your vote in the chat room by sending a private message to Sky in the chat room with your votes.
6735743	6736163	Alright.
6738364	6741006	As promised, we're going to try this horrible...
6741804	6742625	Experiment Out.
6742725	6750392	I don't think this is going to go over very well, but the chatroom asked we do it, so we're going to get on to Xbox Live and harass people randomly on Ultramix, alright?
6751133	6753575	So, let's see, I have to get suited up here, though.
6754156	6755357	Let me head over to get suited up.
6755877	6756638	Let me get the mic over.
6757419	6761223	Yeah, so you'll have to say bye to the chatroom for a minute, Jamie, because we're going to switch it over.
6761823	6762684	And I have to get suited up.
6762724	6763004	Hold on.
6763545	6764766	Somebody talk while I get suited up.
6771102	6773684	Ah, he's putting on the headset.
6777066	6778367	You know, I remember that thing.
6779428	6783852	I remember having an indention in the side of my head from playing Phantasy Star Online for six hours.
6785133	6786254	I'm kind of glad I quit.
6787775	6788435	Yeah, Rob...
6804255	6807938	Alright, wait, are we going to switch the cam over to Xbox, right?
6808638	6811400	Eh, it'll be fine.
6811741	6813602	Hold on, we're going to switch the cam over to Xbox real fast.
6819206	6821268	My headset broke, we have a catastrophe.
6825010	6825611	There, put it over here.
6839400	6841522	I'm getting suited up, sorry guys, I broke my headset.
6847466	6853070	Alright guys, first things first, I have to make sure that both my mics are working.
6853110	6856293	Then I have to set it up so that we can hear the voices through the TV, which hopefully we will.
6859025	6865248	So I just changed the settings so that the voices will come through the TV so hopefully you guys can hear the folks that chat with me on Xbox Live.
6865548	6869270	Now, chat listeners, don't join the game just because we're in it.
6869751	6870511	I know who you are.
6871511	6872632	So I'm going to set up a match.
6873973	6877454	And let's do a light song because I'm going to pretend to be somebody that doesn't know how to play DDR.
6877735	6879796	And then I'm going to regulate the game, okay?
6880416	6880916	So let's see.
6882697	6884758	Let's do... You want to do DXY?
6885999	6886439	Alright.
6887340	6888020	They want DXY.
6888630	6890272	It's the old DXY banner.
6890992	6891593	That's cool.
6892233	6893374	Alright, so we're going to do a match on DXY.
6893394	6894535	Okay, let's see if anybody joins.
6894575	6895876	I'm going to do three public slots.
6895896	6896677	We'll see if anybody joins.
6896697	6898158	I'm going to mute my mic for now.
6900540	6902462	Alright, so I'm waiting for people to join the match.
6902502	6903543	So we'll see what happens here.
6905364	6907246	I think you'd get more players if you were in a harder setting.
6908954	6910175	No, actually, you'd be surprised.
6910215	6911796	You get a lot of people on the light settings here.
6911816	6912897	So we're going to see if anyone joins.
6913778	6915179	Loki, any feedback from our chatroom?
6915199	6916840	Because you're a little closer to the chatroom over there.
6917881	6919602	I know you're overworked here on this show.
6924966	6933432	They're talking about... Leave it to somebody to try and ruin the goddamn... Did you see what happened there?
6934373	6936975	Yeah, somebody's trying to come in and ruin our live experiment here.
6937135	6937595	But that's okay.
6937615	6938316	I think I can block them.
6939679	6940419	I'm going to try that again.
6941580	6942340	Who do you think?
6942440	6944381	Who always wants attention on this show?
6944421	6945002	Oh, the moron?
6945742	6946022	Yes.
6946042	6948663	I'm pretty sure I can boot him.
6953526	6953926	Let's see.
6953986	6954466	Hold on here.
6956227	6957148	I'm pretty sure we can do this.
6957168	6958208	Let's try this again.
6964707	6965067	There we go.
6965227	6968908	If they join, they're muted, so we wouldn't be able to hear them, so it doesn't know good to join anymore.
6969528	6969828	All right.
6972348	6973428	God, I love Xbox Live.
6973468	6973789	All right.
6975669	6976449	Let's try this again.
6976489	6981050	Now we're sitting in there waiting for somebody to hopefully join, so... Blocked.
6981590	6981810	Ha ha.
6981830	6983590	Well, they're not blocked, we just can't hear them.
6983890	6984150	I know.
6984190	6985511	So they can do whatever they want.
6985531	6986171	So it doesn't matter.
6986271	6987231	Yeah, it doesn't matter what they say.
6987251	6987551	Stupid idiot.
6989271	6989551	All right.
6991271	6994132	I actually wonder if there's a way we can... Try booting.
6994868	6995909	There is no boot option.
6997351	6998132	You know what, chat room?
6998212	7003818	If this is all we're going to get is one loser with nothing better to do, then we're going to end this segment.
7004118	7006060	And you guys suck for suggesting we should do it.
7010805	7016891	I wonder if you can send a screaming feedback.
7019542	7020182	I'm not going to bother.
7020323	7020903	I'm not going to bother.
7021323	7024985	I'm just going to... The thing's muted, so they can't do anything anyway.
7025005	7026045	There's no good to be on.
7027005	7027786	Oh, we got somebody.
7030067	7030387	Finally.
7032228	7033108	Yes, we got a match.
7033388	7035289	Okay, now hopefully everybody says they can start.
7036269	7037270	Yes.
7037390	7039471	Alright, take your mic down.
7039611	7040171	I'll do commentary.
7040511	7040771	Alright.
7044853	7045353	Here we go.
7045613	7046233	Are you ready?
7047034	7047374	Dance!
7061874	7063254	Does anyone know how to play this game?
7063274	7064435	Don't stop, Player 3!
7070136	7070976	Oh yeah!
7071036	7071936	Player 2!
7074877	7075537	Oh yeah!
7082279	7084239	It looks like Player 1 can take this one!
7091337	7093899	Yeah, let's hear it!
7093919	7094920	Player 2-0 on fire!
7094940	7096021	Player 1 has the advantage!
7117714	7118835	Call the fire department!
7119035	7120936	We've got a five alarm dancer!
7120976	7123517	Just disturbed, guys.
7123557	7124318	Oh, God!
7124358	7125778	Quick, call the fire department!
7125818	7127059	We've got a five alarm dancer!
7127099	7127339	Oh, no!
7149610	7151271	I missed like one step at the end there.
7154413	7155073	I'm so excited.
7155133	7155593	I got three points.
7172469	7173410	Those guys were losers.
7173430	7174570	They didn't even talk at all.
7174610	7176151	What a waste of a segment that was.
7176191	7178473	I'm never letting the chatroom pick a segment for us again.
7180534	7183856	You know the only good thing we got out of that segment was getting to hear DXY.
7183876	7184636	You know what?
7184917	7185177	What?
7185597	7187778	I'd like to play the chatroom.
7187958	7189139	You want to play against chatroom listeners?
7189159	7190480	No, I would like to... Oh, I'm sorry.
7190500	7191681	Yeah, we'll switch it back over to chat.
7191701	7192181	Don't worry about that.
7194335	7195096	Loki's getting to work.
7195196	7195536	Great.
7195896	7196096	Yeah.
7196356	7197677	What a fun thing that that was.
7197978	7198558	What did we get?
7198858	7202000	We got one person with nothing better to do than to stalk this show.
7202241	7205743	And we got two people who didn't even talk when we tried to, you know, get them to say stuff.
7206303	7206724	Boring.
7208365	7213588	I think someone has a... And everybody got to see me break my combo at the end there and see what a horrible DDR player I am.
7214869	7215250	God.
7215370	7215890	Yeah.
7216651	7222835	You know, I was going to come up on the show today and apologize for, you know, bringing old drama...
7224933	7228615	You can't apologize for something that somebody else keeps perpetuating.
7228635	7229436	That's fucked up.
7230136	7231037	You need to stop that.
7231437	7233958	Here.
7234078	7235679	That message in the chat room is for Loki.
7237280	7240101	He's mumbling incoherently at the stupidity of some people.
7242322	7244143	At least I won, so I feel a little better.
7244183	7245224	At least I didn't get my ass kicked.
7245244	7248305	At least dumbass got nearly last.
7249886	7250867	Yeah, that made me feel a little better.
7250887	7251267	That's pathetic.
7251786	7251826	No.
7251846	7251886	No.
7251926	7252146	All right.
7273271	7279033	Well, I guess what we'll do is we'll go to our break, and when we come back, we'll find out the winner of tonight's cage match, and we'll do the FUs of the week.
7279073	7282495	But please don't send the FUs yet, because we'll get to those a little bit later.

7610040	7613762	Hey, can you hear me?
7614202	7621547	A long time listener, first time caller I really like that show you play on Wednesdays, what's it called?
7621567	7633874	Yeah, that's a good show, everybody should listen to that Hey, that would be a great time, I think everybody should listen to that show
7638388	7644673	And is it true you guys are going to play a remix of that song, what's it called, from Silent Hill 4?
7646974	7647595	Which one?
7647795	7648596	The Your Rain?
7648956	7651378	Yeah, aren't you going to play a Your Rain remix?
7651758	7652519	I heard about that.
7652559	7654220	That was a couple weeks ago that we did that.
7654660	7654980	What?
7655561	7656702	We did that a couple weeks ago.
7657082	7658083	Are you saying I missed it?
7658243	7659104	Yes, you missed it.
7659504	7661826	Oh, fuck!
7662186	7665108	You know what, just for you, kind sir, I'll play it again later in the show.
7665488	7666469	Oh, thank you very much.
7666549	7667630	Oh, you're welcome very much.
7668462	7669302	Thanks for calling.
7670023	7670643	All right, bye.
7673564	7675565	See, that's a good Skype call right there.
7676405	7676745	All right.
7677486	7679327	I've played it every week on my show.
7680787	7681107	Have you?
7681387	7681948	Yes, I have.
7682008	7682628	Well, then, you know.
7682888	7685249	Because I marathoned the Silent Hill 4 U.S.
7685269	7685729	soundtrack.
7686049	7687090	Oh, people should turn it in.
7688190	7689891	If people listened, they would know.
7690751	7691732	I know, I know.
7693012	7694613	No one ever requests anything on my show, either.
7697260	7699062	So Skype line's open if you want to call in.
7702485	7703025	Call us.
7703946	7708930	Pick up the phone.
7708950	7715135	1-900-HOT-POTATO I had to block some people there because certain people are still trying to get through.
7715155	7716096	Some people never learn.
7717757	7720319	Hey, I'm just glad they're listening and keeping our ratings up.
7720379	7720880	This is good.
7721320	7721841	You know what?
7722001	7722261	What's up?
7722281	7722921	I have a theory.
7723382	7724623	Okay.
7725163	7726004	I think that
7727479	7729981	There was no sperm involved in that person's creation.
7730441	7730841	Anyway.
7731262	7732623	I think that it was Jell-O.
7734424	7738588	Let's talk about who won tonight's cage match.
7738648	7741250	We have a new winner in tonight's cage match, finally.
7742071	7744573	Finally, Loki has to pick a new song, because we have a new winner.
7747896	7749377	I don't have to do shit next week.
7751419	7755142	Bond won the cage match, and better yet, we're getting another call.
7756158	7757458	Howdy, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7760459	7761499	Hey, it is Dark Knight.
7761819	7763180	Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing?
7764240	7765800	I'm alright, how about y'all?
7765820	7766921	We're pretty good, what's on your mind?
7768181	7771602	Not much, I'll tell you what, that last call should make Classic Call of the Week.
7772222	7774823	Yeah, I think we should make that Classic Call of the Week.
7775443	7775843	Yeah.
7775903	7778644	I'll just put the blunt side of it.
7778944	7781064	You don't want to do anything to try and one-up that call?
7782905	7784405	I can't come up with anything close.
7785027	7786247	Alright, alright.
7786767	7789268	Hey, what do you think about how Ultramix 2 is shaping up?
7790668	7792068	With some of those new songs announced this week.
7794449	7799530	It's pretty decent, but I'm still like, no Xbox for me, I'm not touching it.
7799610	7809231	It was so hard for a long time to have to kind of finally say, oh, I gotta cave and buy the Xbox, but I tell you what, once I got it, there was actually some decent games on it.
7809411	7812872	One or two, but DDR is one of them, so it's worth it.
7813132	7813512	It's worth it.
7814577	7820984	I'll tell you what, though, on that suggestion about having other people play against you, like somebody said, Chamberlain, why you didn't play a hard song?
7821929	7846862	because I wanted other people that don't listen to the show to come into the game and play and we would kind of mess with them a little bit like I'd say I'd never played DDR before and hopefully they would talk because usually the lamer people are the ones that play the light songs so I sort of was trying to bait some of the younger players and stuff but it didn't work we only got a couple losers that can't get over themselves that wanted to join and people that don't talk so what can you do?
7848203	7849705	Hey Dark Knight Hey Angel Hi
7870771	7872012	Hi, this is Dark Knight.
7872092	7872393	Hi.
7872613	7873233	And he's cool.
7873433	7873834	Hey, Rob.
7874094	7874314	Yes.
7874354	7875095	Rob.
7875355	7875655	Rob.
7875776	7876036	What?
7876116	7876316	What?
7876456	7876736	What?
7876817	7877037	What?
7877117	7877277	What?
7877357	7878398	We've got Dark Knight on the phone.
7878418	7879179	What are you talking to me for?
7880660	7882001	Well, I'm going to let him go now.
7882101	7883423	So, you take care, Dark Knight.
7883443	7884023	Thanks for calling.
7884684	7884984	You're welcome.
7885004	7885725	Have a good night.
7885745	7885865	Bye.
7885885	7886946	Bye-bye.
7886986	7888667	You know, Zeno in our chat room raises...
7890968	7893629	Zeno in our chatroom raises a point about the folks on Ultramix.
7894649	7898970	There's hardly anybody that wants to play the heavy stuff because a lot of them are actually on dance pads.
7899390	7901411	And it's kind of hard to play heavy stuff on dance pads.
7901451	7902891	So he says nobody plays heavy.
7902931	7904532	And from what I've seen, that's kind of true.
7904932	7906892	Zaku's calling back, so I thought we'd pick up his call.
7906912	7907532	What's up, Zaku?
7909933	7914354	I'm just wondering, what are the chances of another...
7919955	7920676	Yeah, spit it out.
7920696	7932486	I'm just wondering exactly why, you know, why does Microsoft have favoritism towards, you know, why do they have favoritism towards Konami in that sense?
7932526	7946899	Because they get downloaded songs, and while PS2 users get crapped on, because even though we already have a hard drive, there's no way in God's green earth we're actually going to be able to download songs, so we're basically screwed.
7948664	7949124	Good points.
7949184	7952770	I'm going to go ahead and let you go because our connection is a little crappy, but I'm going to talk about this point.
7952790	7953751	So tune back into the show.
7953771	7954752	We're going to talk about this, okay?
7956844	7962288	Why is it that Ultramix 2 folks get to download songs but the PS2 folks don't?
7962948	7963769	Why do you think that is?
7964789	7977718	My own thought is that I think they've been trying to take PS2 games in one direction and Ultramix in the other direction because if PS2 had everything the Xbox game had, same song list, same everything, you wouldn't buy both of them.
7978839	7979439	I would.
7981588	7985750	The few hardcore folks that would just be all about supporting Bomani, yes, they still would.
7986070	7988072	But the majority of people would not buy both games.
7988132	7995596	But if PS2 is allowed to have its iToy thing going one way, and Xbox has its live thing going one way, then, you know...
7996056	7999977	That's, to me, kind of, I think, Konami trying to shape both games in a way.
7999997	8003338	They're taking two of the strongest points of each system and making that the focal point.
8003538	8019421	I don't think it has anything to do with Microsoft sucking Konami off to get them to do that or anything, although I do know that Microsoft uses DDR Ultramix to show other developers, hey, look what you can do with a game and how you can make money, because they've been making a lot of money off those songpacks.
8019921	8020101	So...
8021317	8021717	GameCube
8050891	8054434	I mean, sucks to be a GameCube user, because you're never going to see a DDR mix, probably.
8054754	8055434	Probably not.
8055895	8065743	The only thing the GameCube has going for it as far as online play is the new PSO that's coming out for it, but apart from that... Yeah, I mean, but that has nothing to do with Konami and stuff.
8066324	8072249	Again, it's nothing to do with favoritism or... PS2 just has, of the three, the worst online.
8072509	8073270	I mean, seriously.
8073890	8075291	It's not all that strong.
8075672	8077694	I mean, I talk to people who get booted off of it all the time.
8077914	8078114	Yeah.
8079063	8081944	You know, Xbox is built to be an online system.
8082204	8082604	Yes, it is.
8083464	8086504	You know, you have to look... You know, I look at it this way.
8088265	8090665	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
8091365	8095646	And I have said this, you know, since the days where people are going, Well, the Saturn sucks.
8095866	8096826	Well, no, it doesn't.
8096966	8098086	You're just playing games that suck.
8100587	8104467	But if you take a look at the Xbox, it's built with the online capacity.
8104527	8105788	It's built with a hard drive.
8106068	8106868	Look at the PS2.
8106888	8108128	These are peripherals, you know.
8108567	8111070	These are things that were added on later.
8112692	8117777	The first model PS2, I have a Japanese PlayStation 2, it doesn't have anywhere to put a hard drive in it, I'm sorry.
8118398	8119959	It has to have an external hard drive.
8120800	8122682	It's an afterthought.
8122923	8129610	You have to look at what a system is built to do and then see, well, am I going to use this capacity that the machine has?
8131347	8144305	I do understand though the points being brought up, but it just kind of sucks that you have to pay an Xbox Live fee over and above, because on PS2 you don't usually have to pay extra fees, maybe certain games, but on Xbox, if you want to play anything online, you've got to pay that extra fee.
8145006	8145486	What's $10 a month?
8145506	8145907	It's nothing.
8148681	8151123	But it's still, I mean, it's a lot of money.
8151583	8158247	But a lot of the games that have online don't often require that you pay for the online with the game.
8158287	8160148	They're getting their back in this.
8160168	8162890	Yeah, that's sort of the trade-off is that then the games don't really charge.
8162910	8171095	The only games that I really see justifying having that extra fee, like for example, Phantasy Star Online, because they have to keep the servers up, right?
8171996	8176158	Well, it costs for maintenance there, so of course they're going to have to charge what the $9 a month that it is.
8176598	8177519	That's the thing is that
8177898	8184621	You know, you're paying that little bit a month for the Xbox Live, but for most of the other online, you're getting that for free.
8185841	8190003	And then some of the others, you're paying a very minimal amount to get it over.
8190903	8194805	But then, of course, it comes up the fact that Xbox Live doesn't support dial-up.
8194985	8198086	Well, that's just because it's so intense, all the bandwidth.
8198286	8200407	I mean, you saw while we were playing there, we have voice going over.
8200627	8201728	You can't do it dial-up.
8201808	8204049	You can do dial-up, but you have to get extra stuff, right?
8204089	8205429	How would you hook that up, Loki?
8205910	8206610	Hell if I know.
8206630	8206970	I don't know.
8207429	8208631	I know you can do it.
8208771	8212977	If you go to the Microsoft site, I think that they have a dial-up adapter.
8213018	8213839	There's a way to do it.
8214159	8218506	I think over on DDR Freak there's a thread about how to get the service packs with dial-up.
8218626	8220409	I know somebody wrote an FAQ on that.
8220429	8221891	I don't remember who or where it's at, but...
8223450	8227632	On top of that though, these days there's hardly any excuse not to have broadband.
8228132	8230754	You may still live in an area that doesn't have it.
8230894	8231514	Very possible.
8231614	8234075	Well, if you live in an area that doesn't have it, that's understandable.
8234135	8239978	But if you're thinking of expense, broadband now is sometimes cheaper than another phone line.
8241779	8242079	Very true.
8242605	8248366	Alright, I'll open up the Skype line for a little bit more here, see if anybody wants to call in, but otherwise we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
8248706	8254168	We did, by the way, boys and girls, we had another net split, so about half our chat room can't get in.
8254268	8255668	So let's take this call.
8255788	8257249	Our old buddy Jason's calling in.
8257309	8257789	What's up?
8258709	8259309	Hello, Rob.
8259529	8260049	Hi, Jason.
8260069	8260489	How you doing?
8261089	8266291	I just heard you guys start mentioning the ILF Connections to Xbox Live and thought I'd give you a ring again.
8266631	8267371	Okay, yeah, what's up?
8268264	8273429	Well, you know, as we all know now, as soon as DDR Freak comes back up... Yeah, it's down today.
8273489	8273890	What's up?
8273950	8274510	Who broke it?
8274650	8275311	Did you break it?
8275992	8283819	I talked Blue and J-Dog, and they're hashing something out, so they'll get it up, hopefully sometime tonight, if not tomorrow morning.
8284019	8284359	Alright.
8284700	8285701	I'm sorry I broke it.
8286141	8287442	I was just too much for it, you know?
8287863	8289164	She coughed on it, and it broke.
8289544	8290345	It caught my cooties.
8292887	8294829	What's up with the dial-up stuff in Xbox Live?
8295393	8301138	So when it's back up, there's two really good resources that Cutris posted in the console games forum.
8301298	8306542	One of them is dial-up users that want to connect to Xbox Live.
8306963	8323416	It's basically you have to get a connection on your computer and then have a way of running another network cable out to the Xbox, because that's the only way of plugging it in, and then do internet connection sharing so Xbox connects.
8324051	8328194	and then it just uses your PC's bandwidth to, well, to do the work.
8328534	8329555	What a pain in the ass.
8330615	8333778	It's something that I did for a while before I got my router, as a matter of fact.
8333918	8334318	Wow.
8334958	8336439	ZXP makes it really, really easy.
8336499	8339021	If you have anything else, Google.
8339882	8340742	All right, Google.
8341283	8342483	All right, well, thanks for the tip, Jason.
8342503	8344184	I'm sure some of our listeners appreciate that.
8344685	8345145	No problem.
8345385	8346366	All right, you have a good one, buddy.
8346686	8347587	Anything else you wanted to say?
8347767	8349328	Anything else about Ultramix or any of that stuff?
8349948	8353851	They'll appreciate it a lot more as soon as DDR Free comes back up and they can actually read how to do it.
8354373	8357274	Hey, was it just me or did that Ultramix segment kind of suck?
8359334	8360495	The start of it sucked.
8361175	8361715	Yeah, it did.
8361755	8362315	Nobody talked.
8362595	8363075	Yeah, well.
8363295	8364035	I tried, Jason.
8364075	8364716	I tried for you.
8365356	8366356	You're very good for doing so.
8366536	8367256	Alright, take care.
8367876	8368116	Thanks.
8370877	8371137	Why not?
8371157	8372858	We're actually getting a lot of people on Skype now.
8372878	8373418	It's kind of cool.
8373478	8375398	So, open it up one more time.
8375438	8376739	See if anybody else wants to call in.
8378139	8379359	If not, we'll go into the FUs of the week.
8379539	8381760	I'm kind of waiting for our net thing to reconnect.
8382080	8382300	So...
8383373	8385094	BlackDevilRx, what's on your mind tonight?
8412522	8417884	Not much, I was just sitting here listening to the whole Ultramix thing.
8418064	8419225	Little program we have, right?
8419845	8420986	Have you ever listened to the show before?
8422726	8425308	No, actually, this is my first time.
8425468	8426568	Yeah, it kind of sucks, huh?
8430170	8430830	No, it's alright, it's alright.
8430890	8431570	I think we suck.
8431610	8432190	Don't answer that.
8433491	8434091	What's on your mind?
8434131	8436912	What do you think about Ultramix 2 coming out?
8436932	8440474	I mean, I don't know, I just kind of see how this works.
8442839	8446201	Are we your guinea pigs for testing this program?
8447502	8447903	Sort of.
8448203	8448823	Oh, well, that's all right.
8449083	8451725	Well, what do you think about the new DDR games coming out this fall?
8451745	8452846	Are you planning on picking one of them up?
8452886	8453767	I think they're both great.
8453807	8458150	I mean, they have, you know, an awesome selections of, awesome selections, really.
8458590	8466175	What do you think about the whole fact that PS2 is not online and Xbox doesn't have iToy?
8466235	8467956	Why do you think, what's your opinion on that?
8467996	8470438	Why do you think the games are going in completely different directions?
8471772	8479556	I don't know, I mean, they're both made by different companies, as I understand, and they're, you know, PS2 has the eye toy thing.
8479876	8485819	Oh, so sort of, you're referring to those rumors that Harmonix had something to do with Xtreme, right?
8486359	8486899	Uh, yeah.
8487139	8491721	From what I understand, those were proven to be false to some extent.
8492622	8494503	I don't know the details on that, but regardless.
8494823	8496204	But we have Konami of Hawaii.
8496224	8496964	I can't really go...
8498086	8499706	There's some sort of thing that's wrong.
8499786	8502727	I'm getting some sort of double post, like some sort of echo.
8503227	8504988	Turn down your Win app because you're hearing us twice.
8505028	8505368	That's why.
8507368	8507728	It's all right.
8508228	8508709	Don't panic.
8509449	8510169	Everything will be okay.
8510469	8510869	Don't panic.
8512470	8516671	Okay, you're talking about how Ultramix is made in Hawaii and Extreme is made in Japan, right?
8516731	8517171	Kind of that?
8517211	8517411	Yeah.
8517651	8518071	Oh, okay.
8518431	8518691	All right.
8518871	8520031	So you think maybe that has to do with it?
8520692	8520852	Yeah.
8521012	8521812	That's an interesting theory.
8521832	8522072	All right.
8522092	8522972	Anything else you want to share?
8523772	8524272	No, that's it.
8524492	8524753	All right.
8524793	8525353	Have a good one, buddy.
8525913	8526153	All right.
8526213	8526393	Bye.
8526413	8526553	Bye.
8527779	8530000	I'm liking this Skype line thing now that people actually use it.
8530220	8530500	All right.
8531641	8533342	Well, let's get into the FUs of the week, shall we?
8534322	8534842	Actually, wait.
8534862	8537464	Well, there was one more person we hadn't heard from that was trying to call in.
8537924	8540865	So I'm going to see if that person can get through.
8540925	8543226	If you've already called us this segment, please don't call back.
8543366	8544927	I can't pick up because we already talked to you.
8545427	8548389	But there was somebody else trying to get through that we hadn't talked to yet.
8548409	8549890	I was going to give them a chance to get through.
8549910	8553931	Let's see if they call.
8555452	8556833	Hmm.
8556853	8557113	We'll see.
8559295	8560596	This is certainly a new thing for us, too.
8560696	8566838	I don't know of any other internet radio station that does this for their listeners, where they can talk on Skype and stuff.
8567138	8568218	Oh, yeah, there's one.
8568259	8570039	I forgot that they do that, too.
8571320	8571820	Bad Me.
8572280	8574301	Yeah, our parent station, Understation Live.
8574341	8577262	All right, for that, for my mistake, I will give them a free plug.
8577622	8579403	www.understationlive.org.
8579563	8579843	Listen.
8580143	8580703	They're awesome.
8580863	8581504	Travis and Jenna.
8581684	8581884	Yes.
8582704	8584665	They're still doing their show on, like, Saturdays, right?
8584805	8586686	Yeah, and they have spinoffs occasionally, too.
8587126	8587386	All right.
8589005	8593107	Speaking of which, we have to give a shout out to the baby, because the baby turned one this week.
8593707	8595047	Aww, their baby turned one.
8595087	8595247	Yep.
8595428	8596328	Big radio baby.
8596428	8596788	Kira.
8596808	8597908	Alright.
8598869	8603271	Well, I guess that person didn't want to call in, so we'll give them another chance later.
8603331	8605551	But for now, we're going to do the FUs of the week.
8605672	8608533	Okay, now this is the way the FUs of the week is going to work tonight.
8608593	8613335	If you are on the wrong end of the split, you can send an email with your FUs.
8613455	8614175	Here's the address.
8614195	8615235	I'm only going to give it once.
8615855	8616796	Get a pen and paper ready.
8616856	8617016	Ready?
8617036	8617156	Ready?
8618647	8629453	Rob, R-O-B, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you have FUs and you can't get them in on the chat room because of the split, send them over email.
8629833	8632214	Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Ooh, I did it twice.
8632254	8632935	I said I only do it once.
8633015	8633255	Alright.
8634315	8634615	Alright.
8635216	8636556	Let's get to tonight's FUs.
8636616	8637017	Jamie's.
8637357	8639098	Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week?
8639378	8641079	We're so full of anger.
8656949	8661652	A big F you goes to my damn nose for being full of snot.
8662713	8663734	I hate you allergies.
8663934	8664635	I hate you.
8665916	8666836	I hate pollen.
8666956	8667837	I hate the trees.
8667977	8668818	I hate the grass.
8669458	8670959	I hate the little animals.
8672000	8674221	I hate anything that's setting off my allergies right now.
8674402	8675562	Okay, I don't hate Shermie though.
8675582	8676183	She's forgiven.
8676627	8683113	Because Shermie is, of course, the official cat of Warner Sounds Radio.
8684114	8687877	Also, F you to the H2 for looking stupid.
8688697	8691520	And F you to the Hummer for being expensive, because I want one.
8694863	8704031	Another big F you goes toward it being so busy at work because it's hard to talk with my...
8705587	8710349	FU to it getting hot again.
8710569	8714291	It was nice and cool for a few days, and then the hot came back.
8714991	8716872	It was like 97 degrees today, that sucked.
8718473	8724915	Um, and FU goes toward, uh, shoot, I had another one to name.
8726256	8728537	Yeah, my air conditioning for not working.
8729337	8730438	And also to, uh,
8733115	8737116	The repair guy, I don't know if it's the repair guy or my apartment complex manager.
8737136	8745019	I mean, she's nice and everything, but... The first time the repair guy came in, he just put Freon in it, and it was cool for like three hours.
8745599	8746540	And then it got hot again.
8748260	8756563	And I called the apartment manager to have the guy come back and do it again, and I don't think he ever came, so I'm having Dan go talk to her.
8757023	8759144	Dan is 6'4", okay?
8759824	8762525	Dan is very tall and very large.
8763379	8765620	And when he asks somebody to do something, usually they will.
8767300	8767700	So, yeah.
8768000	8769041	Not that you're threatening or anything.
8769061	8771502	Not that we're threatening, no.
8772342	8778464	I hate my nose again, because, like, at least it's not dripping like it was earlier, because it was, like, all day, and I was sneezing all day.
8779104	8785606	But, like, the left side was all blocked up, and now the right side is, and I, like, want it to make up its mind just not to be blocked up.
8786146	8788387	And also, a big F you to Benadryl.
8788707	8792548	Where Benadryl works, it, like, makes me all, like, goofy.
8793462	8796663	So, I hate my sentences and everything.
8797383	8798303	So, that's it.
8799403	8802704	Alright, then, let's move on to Loki and his FUs of the week.
8805845	8809225	Okay, so, my fault, actually.
8809505	8817107	I bit on the wrong wire, the wrong magnet wire, because I could have gotten this other stuff much cheaper, and it would have been much better for what I'm doing.
8817947	8819587	And, um, so that sucks.
8820428	8821768	And then also...
8823018	8825866	I don't know, really nothing else to be mad about.
8826768	8828513	Just stupid drivers in general.
8829415	8829997	People just
8830990	8831690	Thanks for watching!
8856383	8857484	It's like these factors.
8857664	8860327	I swear, people do not need to be on cell phones while driving.
8860627	8862469	I never answer my cell phone while driving.
8863350	8865051	So, that really sucks.
8865331	8872798	And, um, other than that, really not too much else to be mad about.
8873279	8877683	Other than, um, you know, McDonald's food sucking, but I keep eating it for some reason.
8879825	8880105	That's all.
8884403	8884963	My turn.
8886725	8888766	All right.
8890127	8890628	Let's see.
8898742	8906568	My FU of the week basically goes to, now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my job, but work on Friday, I just had it.
8907289	8910431	I reached my breaking point Friday where I was like, Calgon, take me away.
8911151	8914214	And I'm not looking forward to next week incredibly much either.
8914294	8915334	But I'll get over it.
8915495	8917496	I do love my job and I love the people I work with.
8918157	8919838	It's just that there's too much drama sometimes.
8919918	8920718	I can't deal with it.
8920778	8921639	Also an FU to The Bart.
8924693	8950430	The Bay Area Rapid Transit System Because if I want to use my ATM card on BART I have to buy a $20 ticket minimum $20 When it only costs like $8 To get to San Francisco and back Bastards That's highway robbery I'll lose the damn ticket Bastards Alright, let's go to some other FUs From our folks assembled here Starting off with Explicit Uh
8952956	8954297	3 hour show buddy, keep it short.
8954557	8956437	Okay, I'll keep this one short, okay.
8956457	8961559	Alright, I would like to give an F you to the State Fair for being so damn expensive.
8962939	8972823	I mean, not only have the spot like my friends, you know, I have to be nice to my friends and all, but my wall, my bank's almost depleted just for the State Fair and shit.
8974143	8976824	F you to Shane for squashing the hell out of my stomach.
8978125	8981746	I know I ate like funnel cakes before riding on a few rides, but
8982739	8986140	Squashing me in this one ride in my stomach killed my appetite.
8987721	8991303	I have not eaten any lunch nor dinner both today and Saturday.
8992643	9001827	An F you for Scandia for not posting what the hell the rules are for this tournament Tuesday.
9002628	9003568	Like how the hell are we going to know?
9003588	9004769	It's whatever they feel like doing.
9005969	9007050	Who knows what's going to happen?
9007090	9008810	Would it screw up or would it not screw up?
9010501	9018687	And F you to the drama about, ooh, sim makers versus actual people who play DDR2 actually hired for the Ultramix game.
9020248	9020688	Oh, okay.
9020908	9025872	Yeah, like, you know, how some people say, ooh, people get hired for connections and stuff.
9027633	9030255	You know, like, everyone knows that AJ and Lil B are working at Ultramix.
9030815	9032076	Right, right, right.
9032236	9034277	Some people are starting drama towards it.
9034578	9035558	Where's this drama at?
9037500	9038040	I think it was...
9038550	9041952	I think it was in AaronInJapan.com, I'm not... Interesting.
9042873	9046615	I'm not F-U-ing Scandi, I'm just F-U-ing some of the people who did not post the rules.
9049256	9050957	Yeah, Scandi has a broken pad.
9050997	9054539	If they don't fix the pad before the tournament, then how are you going to have a fair tournament, basically?
9054699	9058662	I think, in regards to your other F-U, I think people need to withhold judgment until the game comes out.
9059466	9059726	Yes.
9060006	9068570	And I think no matter what happens, no matter who did the steps, if God himself came down from the heavens and wrote the steps to the next mix, somebody out there would say they sucked.
9068810	9070210	There is no pleasing everybody.
9070230	9071471	You're just going to have to deal with it.
9071591	9071951	I know.
9072011	9072411	Honestly.
9074092	9086317	Yeah, people just cut it out, wait till the game comes, wait till Ultramix 2 comes out, and then just from there, it goes, if it's shitty or not, or if it's good as hell or not.
9086577	9089038	From what I've heard of Ultramix 2 so far...
9090615	9091896	You guys are going to be very surprised.
9091936	9096419	Some folks that are all anti-Xbox and stuff, you're going to be hopping on the Xbox train soon enough.
9096779	9098980	Ultramix 2 is going to be very, very good.
9099000	9100261	That's all I have to say.
9100521	9102623	We'll see first when the game comes out.
9103603	9108646	I... I can't say why I'm saying it, but just, it's going to be great.
9109227	9109507	Anyway.
9111124	9114847	Let's see.
9114887	9117508	And FU2 School, some of the teachers in school.
9118749	9119310	Ah, nope.
9119810	9121591	Ah, that's going to be too long for the FUs.
9122772	9123893	So let it speak for itself.
9124153	9124493	All right.
9125174	9125474	Angel.
9126074	9131218	All right, here is my comedy for the FUs, if you want to laugh at it or not, Rob.
9132499	9136341	FU2 Ants Trying to Attack You When You're Trying to Get a Good Night's Sleep.
9136982	9137082	Ew.
9137342	9137402	Ew.
9137814	9139736	Yeah, I know, it's not good.
9139836	9142799	And then when you're trying to sleep, you have nightmares of them trying to kill you.
9143520	9143640	Ah.
9143940	9145061	I know, doesn't that suck?
9145081	9147023	Like big giant ants, or red ants, or what?
9147383	9150887	No, I mean, they're regular house ants, but it's just like, it's annoying as hell.
9151167	9151948	Alright.
9152408	9153769	Yeah, you know, black ants.
9154490	9156272	Little sweet ants, or whatever you want to call them.
9156832	9161797	And then, like, even though you spray around the house, like, not even a week later, they'll come back.
9163004	9166226	And then when you try to squish them, they start walking after you squish them.
9166246	9168127	So you have to like squish them multiple times.
9168187	9168948	It's really annoying.
9169508	9170248	So F you to that.
9170849	9178934	And then also, to add to Loki's F you, F you to stupid drivers that try to clip you when you're just, you know, minding your own business in your own lane.
9179714	9182416	Because I almost got killed going to Walmart.
9183076	9184877	Because we had to get some stuff or whatever.
9185017	9186298	But that really sucked.
9186758	9188179	So I almost died today.
9188439	9189480	Or not today, but this week.
9190261	9190761	That's not good.
9191061	9191541	No, it's not.
9192262	9192522	Hold on.
9194815	9199378	Let me add that to the female drivers of referring to what Loki said.
9199398	9203701	After you did this one lady, you threw a fucking soda can on my windshield.
9204101	9204461	What?
9205322	9206983	Yeah, I was like, ooh, he cut me off.
9207103	9209384	Ooh, let's throw a windshield on my windshield.
9209404	9211305	Let's throw a soda bottle on my windshield.
9211365	9212026	Interesting.
9212886	9213267	Yeah.
9213687	9213907	Huh.
9214884	9219213	Luckily it didn't hit any of my paint or else I would really go after that son of a bitch.
9219293	9220095	I'm gonna rant her over.
9221558	9225165	And F you too, there was some girls flicking us off in the...
9227009	9228690	and the Ferris Wheel.
9228910	9230231	What the hell did we do?
9230451	9231751	We just flipped us off out of nowhere.
9231911	9233232	I would have flipped him off back.
9233292	9235433	I would have flashed my penis.
9235673	9236714	But anyway.
9236974	9237954	Well, I mooned him, so.
9238054	9238855	Okay, that works.
9240155	9242777	Well, even though they don't deserve to taste some of that.
9243477	9246478	Anyway, let's move on and see what Arcadian has to say.
9246538	9247319	Are we done, Angel?
9248179	9248639	I think so.
9250040	9251561	If I think of my last one, it's all good.
9251581	9254942	All right, Arcadian.
9254962	9256103	Fuck you, the heat's coming back.
9257049	9260431	Fuck you to TreeSap for still getting on my car, especially because of the damn heat.
9262172	9278620	And even, and fuck you to the people, the, the, by the, like the rental place or whatever it is that rents out the place that my company works at for choosing these shitty trees that actually drop this stuff all over cars in the winter, in the summer.
9278640	9283362	You better search the damn things and find one that don't drop that shit on you.
9284788	9289549	Okay, fuck you to traffic that comes up like 8.30 a.m.
9289569	9292390	Damn it, you're supposed to be at work already!
9294090	9296451	I don't want this fucking traffic when I'm coming to work late.
9297111	9299511	But what's cool about my work, I can actually come in late.
9299651	9301552	Actually, why don't you start coming in later?
9301572	9303972	Because now that I'm an employee, I can actually be there late.
9305913	9311294	And also, fuck you to my fucked up sleep schedule and my damn body for fucking waking me up
9311803	9312904	Sometimes, like, at 5 a.m.
9312924	9319590	in the morning, get to sleep at, like, between 12 and 1, and then for some fucking reason I wake up, like, 5 or 6 a.m.
9319630	9320231	in the morning.
9321832	9322893	It was really weird.
9322913	9329279	Like, last Monday I slept for, like, 7 hours and I was, like, dead all day.
9330040	9335725	And then the next few days I wake up, like, after 4 or 5 hours of sleep and then actually awake for half the day.
9337627	9337707	And...
9338476	9343879	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9370538	9374221	I was commenting on them doing the every little thing, and Bush blew his nose today.
9375042	9380126	We have reported this on CNN, PSNBC, and the Discovery Channel.
9381247	9382988	Alright, looks like our net split is fixed.
9383048	9386691	However, if you submitted the FU over email, do not send it again.
9387072	9388253	Alright.
9388333	9393137	Flaronay also says, FU to Zim for breaking the Scandia DDR machine in Santa Rosa.
9393657	9394578	Make that Rohnert Park.
9396860	9398381	Angel's freaking out because that's where she's from.
9400427	9400847	You suck!
9401328	9404669	But, uh, you suck, but, um, I don't live there anymore, so, ha ha!
9405970	9410213	Legend of Zaku says, F you to having to wash pots in a summer camp this summer.
9410753	9412834	F you to the fact that I start school tomorrow.
9413355	9415116	Ooh, ouch, I could have a lot of people start school tomorrow.
9415136	9415496	Sorry, guys.
9416176	9424181	Um, F you to President Bush for exploiting 9-11 for another four years in office, hence picking New York City as the location for the Republican National Convention.
9424201	9428944	F you to the hip-hop being the dominating force in this year's VMAs and in mainstream music in general.
9430040	9430980	Did you get my FU?
9431040	9431460	Yes, I did.
9431700	9436422	Oh, yeah, we said... Yeah, fuck you to the video music and we'll... Oh, yes, I have to spoil those, don't I?
9436582	9436982	My bad.
9437162	9437502	Hold on.
9437522	9440263	Who fucking wants to know?
9440283	9441203	It's all stupid crap.
9441283	9446505	I know it is, but I... I want to spoil it for those people that were thinking about going to watch it.
9447345	9453066	Oh, good.
9453106	9454387	I'll get to it, you guys.
9454627	9455187	Here, let's see.
9455487	9457768	Um... Da-da-da-da-da.
9457788	9458668	Where's the winners list here?
9460670	9467636	Video of the Year was OutKast, Hey Ya, which also won the award for most overplayed song of the year.
9467756	9468997	Oh wait, no, that was me.
9469697	9473000	And Best Male Video, Usher, big surprise.
9473040	9475342	Best Female Video, Beyonce, big surprise.
9475382	9476623	Best Group Video, No Doubt.
9476663	9477003	Great.
9477323	9478144	Now you don't have to watch.
9479044	9480205	Yay, you don't have to watch.
9480305	9481366	A public service announcement.
9481386	9486330	You don't have to watch one of the 500 million trillion, six billion repeats that they play every fucking day.
9486991	9487271	Alright.
9487811	9489092	El Mullet would like to say, F you.
9489112	9489933	I have nothing original.
9490712	9498117	HellMullet would like to say F you to the Japanese DDR elitists who have no idea what they're talking about and an F you to my college classes that start tomorrow.
9499138	9503300	DarkKnight says an F you for not having a car and an F you for not thinking of another F you.
9504461	9508564	BlackDevil says F you to my iTunes radio connection when I was calling over Skype.
9508924	9510946	I heard an echo of my voice and your voice.
9511326	9514008	It was like six voices in my head and it was hard to concentrate.
9514768	9516049	Turn down the volume next time you call in.
9516932	9521776	Misty says, F me, because while I did find my karaoke revolution mic, I think it's broken.
9522176	9526920	And in a lesser F you to me for not getting off my ass and driving, I could have kicked some ass in a DDR tournament this weekend.
9528502	9533986	And VXJasonXV says, F you number one to Other Side IRC, why are you unstable at the moment?
9534567	9538990	F you number two from all of us at Orange Lounge Radio and then some, F you to Newt.
9540011	9542713	And F you number three, F you to NetSplits in general.
9544875	9545155	Alright.
9546354	9551298	Now let's take a look at the FUs that came in over email, because I promised that I would read the ones on email.
9552138	9566309	I apologize if I mispronounce this name, because it has an extra E from what I'm used to, but it looks like Renee says, FU to Japanese hentai censorship, and at myself for probably setting a record kick action to myself so fast for a first-time user.
9566749	9567750	Well, that's okay.
9568190	9568831	You live, you learn.
9569577	9571558	As long as you're being good now, that's the important point.
9572038	9575379	Uh, Zeno would like to say, F you, damn IRC network splits.
9575719	9576819	That and fractions.
9577279	9578280	Numbers of the devil.
9579200	9581401	And this weird cut on my hand that doesn't want to heal.
9583821	9595265	And lastly, uh, I don't have an alias for this guy, I only got the full name here, so we'll call him Robert B. Robert B says, a big F you to dial up for being so shitty, and another F you to me for not getting cable.
9595465	9595825	Frown.
9596886	9597326	Fractions?
9597366	9598066	The number of the devil?
9598444	9599845	but call me the devil's friend.
9600146	9603028	Weren't you a math major or something?
9603188	9603509	Yes.
9604670	9605170	I see how it is.
9605190	9607773	You're in cahoots with the devil.
9610175	9611156	Now even I'm scared.
9611216	9611556	Yikes.
9612277	9612597	All right.
9614168	9618690	I think what we'll do is we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from a break, we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.
9619090	9626753	Oh, but first, I wanted to mention some more Bomani news going on, because, you know, there was other news that happened this week, besides the Extreme Unlocks being revealed.
9627193	9635316	There was a preview movie for Dancing Stage Fever that came out, and you can actually see a link to this video right on our website at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9635336	9636437	It's about the fifth story down.
9637777	9643878	What this video showed, it was very interesting, it showed some of the song banners and stuff, but it also had karaoke lyrics.
9644439	9652421	Now, granted, it's the Europe version of DDR, not the USA version of DDR, but, hmm, typically they use very similar engines.
9653081	9657722	So, hmm, you kind of wonder, is karaoke lyrics something that's coming?
9658422	9658982	I don't know.
9659522	9662983	Especially with the Karaoke Revolution crossovers, it would make a lot of sense, but,
9663703	9669251	Despite that, if you do live in Europe and you have access to dancing stage games, then...
9670908	9674449	Hey, there you go, you get karaoke lyrics, and you get a really good song list, by the way.
9674489	9675829	You guys get an awesome song list.
9677310	9681151	And DDR Festival was confirmed by Konami.
9681231	9685552	It is coming, it does support the iToy, and it's coming November 18th.
9685892	9687273	You want to know why it's confirmed?
9687613	9693415	Because they set up a website for it, and you can see this link right there on our website, orangeloungeradio.com.
9693735	9695355	It's right there on our front page.
9696095	9696595	All righty?
9698036	9698296	All right.
9700063	9702484	Oops, it was Dancing Stage Fusion, not Fever.
9702604	9703125	I don't know why.
9703465	9704685	It says in the headline, Fever.
9704745	9705466	We've got to fix that.
9705546	9706366	It's actually Fusion.
9706967	9707447	Our bad.
9707947	9708347	Our bad.
9710708	9711009	All right.
9713590	9716651	We will be right back after this break.
9716711	9719153	Jamie wanted more 5-key, so I said sure.
9719593	9722194	Because she wanted to hear more Rugged Ash.
9723095	9723795	So why not?
9723835	9724896	We'll do some Rugged Ash.
9725116	9726216	Rugged Ash is fun to play.
9726316	9729758	And we'll do Logical Dash and The Fall.
9730489	9731690	Fall Another Hey, do you have Believe Again?
9731710	9732911	Or Beginning of Life?
9732931	9734032	Sorry, Angel Alright, so four names
9751738	9754600	Oh, I did, it was not Renee, it was Rini.
9755340	9762045	But I didn't think that was right, because that would be too obvious, and usually people's names aren't quite as obvious unless you're named Rob, like me.
9762485	9763026	It was Rini.
9763146	9764046	My bad, my bad.
9765427	9767909	You try doing a radio show and pronouncing everything right, alright?
9768369	9769530	We'll be back after this break.
9846053	9851475	Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.
9852056	9854397	The first crash happened in Bukovka.
9892928	9893989	Thanks for watching!
10026952	10028273	Thank you for watching!
10113359	10121941	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
10121981	10128102	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
10129803	10135884	We are back, and I thought since we have a little bit of show left, maybe we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.
10135944	10142346	So you can actually send a question over private message right now to Sky, and we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.
10142406	10143046	But first...
10143680	10143840	Cry, cry
10174483	10176124	Zaku's calling us again, what's up?
10179286	10179626	What's up?
10181787	10188311	Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and go because our connection is a little messed up, but I'm gonna answer that for you, okay?
10200239	10201380	Alright, keep listening.
10202100	10204482	How do you make the jump from 5 key to 7 key?
10204742	10207444	But before we answer the question, I have to do the theme music.
10215230	10218132	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10218652	10221914	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10222615	10229560	When we use the Skype line, random people call in, but I sure hope that one guy doesn't call us anymore, and I hope he got a live...
10232243	10235144	But I'm not going to wish for things that won't happen.
10235605	10235865	All right.
10236865	10239106	Anyway, let's go back to people we do like to hear from.
10239166	10241928	Zaku, how do you make the jump from 5Key to 7Key?
10244958	10245638	You just do it.
10246098	10248739	Yeah, honestly, you just have to do it.
10249159	10254561	My advice, honestly, when you play 2DX, don't play 5-key, ever.
10254901	10256341	Because you'll just be kind of ruining it.
10256661	10260323	But here's the thing, start on light 7, use beginner mode if you can.
10261263	10263884	Just whatever it does to ease you into the 7-keys.
10264164	10268145	Just because you can do a 4-star on 5-key, it doesn't mean you can do a 4-star on 7-key.
10268565	10270485	Adding those two extra buttons will do so much.
10270806	10271806	So just go back to the 1s.
10272486	10274048	And that's really the only way you can do it.
10274608	10278873	Put your turntable on the same side that you had it in five key games if you're playing from there.
10279614	10280915	If that helps you, I don't know.
10281636	10284018	Otherwise, you just have to practice.
10284839	10286120	There's no magic way to do it.
10286180	10287442	Learn how to pinky scratch.
10288531	10289091	Drill mode.
10289251	10294856	If you have 6th or 7th style, or I'm sorry, 5th or 6th style, and I think it was in 7th too, use drill mode.
10295256	10298078	It really, really helps and it teaches you a lot of the tricks.
10298118	10301521	It can be a little repetitive at first, but it really, really helps.
10301942	10304504	So do yourself a favor and try that.
10304964	10305224	Okay?
10306045	10310148	You might want to also, when I first started doing it, I had to learn to recenter my hands.
10311730	10316714	A lot of people will do 5 to 5 keys and then use 2 to the other.
10317365	10318106	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10334867	10336288	Alright, moving on.
10336428	10339810	I want to take some questions that came in from the chat room.
10341471	10344072	Including, Puppy has a question for us.
10344432	10347914	Puppy wants to know, when are we going to go out and have boba with him again?
10350576	10351576	Whenever I can cheat.
10353337	10354618	When you buy me my Humvee.
10357880	10360361	I do think a boba trip is in order, I just don't know when yet.
10360522	10360982	Sorry guys.
10362583	10363123	I don't know when yet.
10364293	10365394	I've been kind of busy lately.
10366374	10373377	We do have a three-day weekend coming up, but I promise, promise, promise a special somebody that I would go to the club with him Sunday night after the show next week.
10373618	10374718	Okay.
10375218	10375959	But maybe next time.
10376479	10376819	We'll see.
10377399	10379801	Certainly by the next time VXChase and XV visits.
10379961	10380521	That's for sure.
10382242	10383943	Zaku wants to submit another question.
10383983	10385483	Skyplane's open too if you want to call in.
10386864	10389085	What was the worst summer job you ever had?
10391506	10393247	I worked at a grocery store for a week.
10394830	10396871	It was supposed to be my first job.
10397112	10398953	I was going to work at the grocery store.
10399013	10407798	I had been offered a job at the game room during orientation at my college, but I wasn't actually a student yet, so to earn some money over the summer, I was going to work at a grocery store.
10408579	10416724	And it turned out that they were... If I was supposed to get off at like 9, I didn't get off work until midnight.
10416744	10419706	I was like, excuse me, screw this, so...
10420612	10424755	I quit, took my last paycheck, and then like two weeks later I was working on campus.
10425616	10427317	Alright, we're going to go to the Skype line.
10427717	10428658	Siggy's on the Skype line.
10428678	10429018	What's up?
10429618	10430639	Hello, Sky.
10430959	10431700	Yes, how you doing?
10432398	10435039	Are we still in the Ask Orange Slown segment yet?
10435199	10435979	You sure can.
10436559	10440901	I just wanted to share one thing real fast, though, to answer Zaku's question about the worst summer job.
10441581	10448603	I once worked at a video store, and we happened to rent pornography, and one of my friends from childhood, his dad came in to rent a porno once.
10448623	10450283	That was really awkward.
10450604	10451444	Anyway, I'm sorry.
10451504	10452564	Yes, you had a question, Siggy.
10453164	10455485	Well, here's just a simple question.
10455785	10458526	Didn't you get my instant message over the forums lately?
10460061	10461342	Oh, yes, about Poppin' Music 12.
10461763	10462323	Yes, I did.
10463224	10465466	Yeah, I was just wondering.
10465686	10467027	You want us to whore out Poppin' Music 12.
10467107	10467888	We can do that.
10468349	10468609	Yep.
10469229	10471772	All right, we'll talk Poppin' Music 12 just for you, Siggy.
10472272	10473994	Just after this.
10474534	10474794	Okay.
10474834	10475615	After this segment.
10475975	10479719	Well, we don't have much time left in the show, so we'll probably get to that and finish out the show here.
10480159	10482521	Just finish this right now.
10482761	10483122	All righty.
10483642	10485023	Thanks for the reminder.
10485544	10485784	All right.
10485884	10486304	All right, later.
10486745	10486865	Later.
10486885	10486985	Later.
10489586	10490626	Yes, I did want to get to that.
10490686	10495387	DarkLine had sent us a message over the forums.
10495427	10496628	Let me go grab that right now.
10497848	10502829	We actually have to wrap up the show, so I just want to do a few more news items, and then we'll finish up here.
10504089	10504469	Let me see.
10504509	10505390	Let me get in there.
10505690	10511371	We did briefly mention it in one of our other news articles, but Poppin' Music 12 is location testing right now.
10511431	10513151	That's really high for a Bomani game.
10513171	10515112	12 Mix or whatever, but they don't call it Mix.
10515172	10515672	It's just Poppin' 12.
10516372	10518434	It has a bunch of new licenses in it.
10518454	10521957	Well, not a bunch, but at least three that have been announced so far.
10522317	10524439	Cruel Angels Thesis is one of them.
10524679	10526841	Dude, that's like the Evangelion theme.
10526981	10527522	Exactly.
10527622	10529423	So tons of people are going to love that.
10529804	10531926	And then some new Konami originals as well.
10531966	10533247	I see the Parkettes are in there.
10533587	10537329	Jimmy Weckl has one, and D.Crew has a song.
10537669	10538990	You can head over to Bomani Style.
10539030	10540991	They actually posted about this a couple days ago.
10541372	10546314	I'd feel a little weird just copying and pasting what they wrote, so honestly, just head over to Bomani Style.
10546334	10547335	They've got all the news on it.
10548115	10552998	They also have screenshots, and it looks like they're kind of... You know how the recent pop-up musics, they've kind of had a theme?
10553338	10557321	Like, Pop-Up Music 11 was like world travel, was kind of what that was all about?
10557621	10560863	It looks like Pop-Up Music 12's theme is traditional Japan.
10561963	10562203	That's cool.
10562223	10571326	Because you notice that the mascots are wearing the kind of kimono and all the artwork looks, for lack of a better word, looks a little chinky.
10573486	10574807	That's basically what it's about.
10576447	10584670	PopMesa 12, we will definitely, when we find out more information about it, we will post it on over to our website over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10585530	10585850	All right.
10587327	10588087	What else was news?
10588348	10589008	Oh, I know.
10589429	10593933	Not necessarily a Bomani game, but you know Taiko No Tatooine, right?
10593973	10594574	You know that game.
10594794	10595755	Yep.
10595875	10599959	Well, you know it's coming to the U.S., and it's going to be called Taiko Drum Master here in the U.S.
10600420	10601121	Close enough name.
10601241	10602042	Well, guess what?
10603163	10609129	The song list has been announced for Taiko Drum Master, and there's some very interesting stuff in it.
10610357	10612898	Like to be expected, you have your classical songs.
10612938	10615600	You have your Beethoven Symphony No.
10615620	10619401	5, Carmen, William Tell Overture, Hungarian Dances No.
10619541	10619401	5.
10619561	10620382	You have all that stuff.
10621102	10628205	Then you have Namco originals, such as Soul Calibur II's Brave Sword, Braver Soul, and the Ridge Racer theme.
10628505	10629526	Cool.
10629926	10631367	But then we get the licenses.
10632167	10636929	Some very interesting license songs in Taiko Drum Master.
10637430	10638190	My Sharona...
10638996	10664408	Material Girl, Lady Marmalade, the theme from Jimmy Neutron, and the theme from Dragon Ball Z, and then get this, Toxic, and DDR Crossovers, Tub Thumping, you remember that, second mix, Tub Thumping, and that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh.
10665666	10670510	I wonder if they're going to make the drum any more stable.
10671171	10674473	If you want to see that list, it's over on our website, orangelauntredo.com.
10674493	10675574	We did post the whole list.
10675634	10677155	It's the fourth story down right now.
10677976	10679838	Very interesting.
10680478	10681779	Donkey Konga is almost out.
10681859	10683340	I think there's only a couple more weeks until that's out.
10683360	10686323	And if you go to GameStop, they have the demo set up so you can try it out.
10686483	10687043	It's interesting.
10687204	10692488	You know, I can't personally be too excited about Donkey Konga after I played it.
10693325	10696346	Because the clapping thing is aggravating, you know?
10697387	10702469	But I wonder, though, have they put out a song list for Donkey Konga yet?
10704991	10706692	Yes, it's way back in our archives.
10706712	10708853	You'd have to do a search, but there was a song list announced.
10708893	10712214	I know that the Japanese version had a bunch of J-pop in it.
10712334	10715136	It had a pretty good song selection.
10717057	10722039	I just sort of blanked out over Donkey Konga, but it's really cool that it's coming out over here, but
10723757	10725319	It's one of the ones I never thought that we'd see.
10726540	10729984	Alright, I'm going to jam through the last few questions here then we've got to wrap up the show.
10730325	10731206	Three more questions.
10731326	10732267	No more questions, please.
10732527	10734589	I'm going to get these last few ones.
10735110	10736211	Dark Knight, a quick question.
10736251	10737993	Has anyone visited Virginia before?
10738033	10741257	The reason why was because Loki had that Virginia shirt on the webcam.
10742998	10748500	As I said before in the chatroom, but no one was paying attention, my aunt and uncle live in Virginia.
10749000	10754461	And so, you know, as a staple, everyone has to bring you back the shirt that says what city they visited.
10754641	10757242	So, you know, I have this shirt.
10757642	10762624	Basically, you know, if you want to know the logic with me wearing this shirt, it was on top of the clean pile.
10763504	10764924	It was the first shirt I saw.
10765845	10766905	And that's how it goes.
10769885	10770906	Thank you for watching.
10770926	10771526	See you next time.
10786022	10786843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10802124	10831311	question from BlackDevil when I call and I want to not hear an echo of the conversation do I turn down my master volume or microphone volume don't turn down your mic volume turn down your speakers or well I shouldn't say your speakers turn down your Winamp or if you're iTunes turn it off while you call the show whatever you're using to listen to the station turn it off while you call the show because that's what causes the echo but don't yeah don't turn off your speakers because then you can't hear us through Skype and then you're talking to nothing so yeah
10832338	10834799	Shut off Winamp or iTunes or whatever you use to listen to the show.
10836399	10838620	And lastly, Legend of Zaku, one more question.
10839020	10844141	What are the chances that we Americans will get other Bomani besides DDR and Karaoke Revolution?
10849322	10850342	We did get Keyboard Mania.
10851823	10852743	To some extent.
10852803	10854263	Not necessarily on PlayStation.
10854303	10855264	But we got the Yamaha.
10856064	10856944	A little hard to get.
10856964	10858644	A lot of people don't even know about it.
10858724	10859144	It's so rare.
10859885	10859965	Um...
10862512	10862992	I don't know.
10863953	10864973	I don't want to say never.
10865654	10866434	Never say never.
10866574	10867334	Let's just put it that way.
10867394	10867995	Never say never.
10868115	10871316	You know what I want to see come out in the States is some of the Namco music games.
10872637	10875358	Namco did... I'm not talking about Taiko no Tatsujin.
10875378	10879080	I'm talking about the guitar game that Namco did and the drum one that Namco did.
10879100	10879680	Alright.
10880421	10884142	Because they did a bunch of... They're supposed to be really good music games, just we haven't seen them.
10885263	10885603	Alright.
10885623	10887764	It's all on the Namco.jp site.
10888669	10891590	Alright, we are going to wrap up the show now, guys.
10891830	10892690	It is time.
10892810	10897131	We're almost running over here, so please let us get everybody's final thought.
10897151	10898972	And we'll start off tonight's final thought with Angel.
10900232	10903393	Um... Well, no, I wanted to save it for last word.
10903413	10909015	If you want it, let me have it, but, uh... Uh... Buffalo Wings.
10910395	10911615	Alright, uh, Arcadian.
10912656	10913176	Final thought.
10913856	10914656	If we can get him a mic.
10915596	10916297	Final thought from Arcadian42.
10916437	10917777	Yay, more money soon.
10921708	10922888	Jonas, your final thought?
10928970	10930090	Tournament Tuesday.
10931170	10931710	Oh, God.
10932931	10935451	Loki, your final thought?
10938392	10941653	I am working on next week's winning song.
10943894	10944994	Bond will be the Thrundeezy.
10946991	10948653	You're just mad because Bond won't put out for you.
10949114	10949494	Alright.
10950936	10954361	My final thought is, listen to Outside the Box on Wednesday.
10954621	10958366	Listen, or I'll come to your house and beat you up.
10959347	10959647	Shut up.
10959808	10960669	Jamie, your final thought.
10961630	10963813	I hate my allergies.

11226228	11226989	Hello, there we are.
11227069	11232951	We are back with the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth, the part after the credits have faded to black.
11233945	11241028	Right now I'm trying to upload that Bukkake clip to our website so I can let you people download it.
11241708	11242528	Nice pun, Rob.
11242548	11243209	She'll have tons of fun.
11243249	11243489	What?
11244029	11244989	I said nice pun.
11246370	11247930	The ACDC back and forth.
11248331	11248831	Oh, whatever.
11249311	11249771	Yeah.
11250071	11250931	Okay, I'm not funny.
11250992	11251512	Fine.
11251532	11252112	That's all right.
11253032	11254133	You don't get paid to be funny.
11255253	11256654	You get paid to sit there and look pretty.
11256674	11258034	I live with someone who's not that funny.
11258054	11258474	No, just kidding.
11258514	11259075	I'm not going to go there.
11259095	11260415	I think he's starting to rub off on you.
11260455	11260935	Be careful.
11261936	11262516	I hope not.
11265758	11266359	Ah, God.
11266859	11269681	You all at home are very glad you did not hear what Jamie just said.
11269721	11270482	That's for damn sure.
11270502	11272143	I can repeat it.
11272163	11272403	No!
11272423	11273164	You can't repeat it?
11273864	11275546	Because none of it is true, damn it.
11276787	11279669	I don't want to hear about the person she lives with rubbing off on anyone.
11283712	11284473	That sucks.
11284693	11290197	I wish I still had that drumroll noise.
11290517	11292539	People should pay us to do this show, you know?
11293720	11295222	Yeah, and I'd get less than minimum wage.
11295442	11299949	I want to tease the... Oh, you want to tease your new remix, Loki?
11299969	11300049	Yeah.
11300449	11301231	Alright, tease it.
11301531	11301751	Wait.
11302332	11303193	Hi, puppy!
11303273	11305597	Loki wants to tease his newest remix for you all.
11305777	11306418	Fine, do it.
11376041	11377622	That was more than a tease.
11377722	11379804	You grabbed my balls and fondled them right there.
11380404	11382886	That was very interesting.
11382966	11384788	Wow, that is pretty cool.
11384828	11386169	What's that all about?
11386209	11386949	Tell us about that one.
11388090	11389551	It's just something with radical faith.
11389611	11394535	I heard this one remix that someone did and it sucked, and I thought, I'll try something like that.
11396176	11397738	I was instantly drawn to the tech.
11398958	11399339	I don't know.
11399659	11403762	Now listening to it through your speakers, I have to change a few things, but it's just the beginning of it.
11403802	11404863	The end kind of gets weird sometimes.
11406184	11408430	Let me play a clip here.
11408892	11412802	Because I can't really transition in this part yet, but it's kind of cool.
11413324	11413664	Let's see.
11441215	11442000	Anyways, that stuff.
11442402	11442623	Yeah.
11443206	11443608	Nice.
11444111	11445196	Very nice.
11452620	11456061	Two Russian planes carrying a total of more than 100 people crashed almost simultaneously today.
11474069	11478231	The first crash happened in Bukalki.
11478391	11480753	I played it ten times tonight and it's still not old.
11480813	11481273	I'm sorry.
11482033	11483154	It is still funny.
11483434	11484155	Nope, still funny.
11484415	11484675	Alright.
11485936	11486196	I don't know.
11486216	11493640	For some reason I can't get that uploaded right now, but... I'll just try it again later.
11494992	11496473	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
11517711	11521575	Flare One uploaded it, there's the URL in the chatroom Flare One was very kind to upload that to you all
11540033	11543956	I know it's on GeoShitties, but hopefully enough of you guys can get it before GeoShitties locks them out.
11545397	11546058	Good luck, you guys.
11547319	11548620	Enjoy the post-show tonight.
11548960	11549601	Have a great one.

11553444	11553785	Good night.
11563733	11564153	I forgot.
11564214	11566976	The thing has this whole little intro, so you just kind of have to sit through it.
11569800	11570087	Nice.
11579153	11579513	Ah, a city man?
11612058	11617721	You are about to embark on a musical journey, a journey made up of beats and bass lines.
11617741	11622463	Prepare yourselves, for you are about to enter the Deep Dance.
11622483	11626205	You want this, you need this, let's party here and we like this.
11626245	11628626	Yo, party over here, party over there, deep dance everywhere.
