1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That was quite interesting. So, now I guess I really am a geek.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Right.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, anyway. Uh, next?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Alright, Vandalous, how was your week, how was your day?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
My week and day were fine. Well, I went to work and I did family stuff. So, pretty standard stuff for me.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Alright. Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How was my day?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How was your week, how was your day?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How was your day?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Um.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Blah.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Just blah?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Alright.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is that all you want to share?

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay then.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Secret!

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How was your week?

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How was your day?

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
My week was boring.

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,640
But today was funny because I went to go get an iPod and I had the worst customer service

24
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,840
in the history of customer service.

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,600
When I went to pay for it, the lady at the checkout was basically demanding that I get

26
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,720
the service plan because she was saying it was a piece of crap.

27
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,680
And I swear, if she would have had a knife, she would have held it to my throat until

28
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
I got it.

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,920
And then we went to Radio Shack, and I asked if they had any accessories, like a holder

30
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,960
or something, and they started, like, saying it was a piece of crap thing, and Apple's

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760
only good for one item.

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,600
So I hope they all die.

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
The end.

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Very nice.

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Alright.

36
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Alright.

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,200
Then there was my week and my day, and my week was pretty uninteresting.

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,240
The Classic Gaming Expo I guess was my highlight.

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,380
You know, I've just been hanging out with people throughout the week.

40
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,380
That's all.

41
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,380
Nothing too exciting.

42
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,480
All right, I guess at this time we're going to go ahead and go to a break.

43
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Breaks are good.

44
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Yeah, breaks are good.

45
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,580
So we're going to go to a break and then we'll come back and we'll talk to Secret a little

46
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,880
more about Ultramix stuff.

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Sound good?

48
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Sounds good.

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
After this

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:43,880
I feel, I feel, I feel You are the only one that makes me feel this way

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:03:12,320
So, Segerd, I heard you brought a sound clip with you tonight that you wanted us all to

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
hear.

53
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,360
yes okay well you should play it I will play that for everybody

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,680
is it a hint yeah I think it might be

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,480
mama don't like tattletales

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
That was interesting. Good luck. Alright.

57
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,480
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Why?

59
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Why?

60
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Why?

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
Why?

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Why?

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Why?

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Why?

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Why?

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Why?

67
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Why?

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Why?

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Why?

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Why?

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Why?

72
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:21,000
Momma don't like tattletales.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Do you really think love can make you want to die?

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why is this a movie and you are the star?

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!

76
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,480
It's yours!

77
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,980
Why is this a movie and you are the star?

78
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:27,120
The beat, the beat, the beat

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:56,400
Orange Lounge Radio.

80
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
You put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

81
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,560
It's server made up of my head number.

82
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,760
It's server made up of my head number.

83
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,540
All right, guys.

84
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,080
During the break, you received the first of the clues tonight.

85
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
And this is the way it's going to work.

86
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,960
When we open it up, and only when we say you can guess the song,

87
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,980
send me a private message in the chat room when we say to,

88
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,980
and you'll have an opportunity to guess the song.

89
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,800
If you are the first person to get it right,

90
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,820
if you are one of our Skype users, meaning

91
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,200
If you go to our website, www.orangessontradio.com, and click on interact with us.

92
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,740
If you're right, you can be the one to announce it to everybody on the air what the song is.

93
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,460
If you don't have Skype, though, you can just tell in the chat room and then we'll relay

94
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,580
the message for you.

95
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,020
But again, only at certain times will you be able to submit a guest to me in the chat

96
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,860
room and there'll be more clues to come if that one didn't quite do it for you.

97
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,740
Mama don't like tattle beds.

98
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Alright.

99
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,740
Anyway.

100
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,740
So.

101
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,740
I probably didn't do it for a lot of people, but it's not supposed to be easy.

102
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,740
All right. So Seeker, thank you for bringing the clip. I appreciate that.

103
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Yeah, um, you're welcome.

104
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
All right, anytime.

105
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,740
I'm avoiding various cups, just trying to get the microphone over here.

106
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
That's right, there's just a lot of people here tonight and a lot of stuff here.

107
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
And porn.

108
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,740
So, how is, anything exciting going on at Konami you want to share with the rest of us?

109
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
I'll just jump right into it.

110
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:28,700
into it. There's always exciting stuff going on at Konami, whether I can share it or not.

111
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:35,120
Actually, there's an interesting thing I can talk about. Everybody who knows about the

112
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,540
game Rumble Roses, it's actually a pretty good game. Just so you know, it's not all

113
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:50,100
boobs. Okay, it is all boobs, but it's actually fun to play. The interesting thing about it

114
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,400
is that it has the mani artists doing the music

115
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,260
uh... we have a kiriyama oka

116
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,060
which you can stop right there cuz that makes it worth the purchase already

117
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,380
uh... it's got uh... you one

118
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,740
it's got death row

119
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,840
it has talka

120
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,500
it has uh... the person that is general i don't remember the name off

121
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,260
of my head

122
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,220
i'm sorry i just uh...

123
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:26,220
killed one of the cups all over her angel. How you doing? Is that water? Oh yeah, look

124
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:33,460
he says watch the cups, thanks! So, yes, what I was going to say is that yeah, it's got

125
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:41,180
an awesome cover of Yankee Rose, the song that, who is it, David Lee Roth did, that

126
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,780
they used in that old E3 trailer or whatever. That's pretty cool. Yeah, that actually is

127
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,700
a really good song um but yeah um that's the really cool thing about rumble roses um don't

128
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,580
know why they're in there but thank goodness they are because that means i'm gonna buy

129
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,580
it now all right

130
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,400
oh okay um yeah the songs for the most part there is one repeated song um you can actually

131
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,700
hear it on videos that play in game stop in eb games you'll hear look to the sky that's

132
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:20,700
in it. Also, I think that's the only repeated song. The rest of them are brand new and they

133
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,440
are very, very good. Me personally, I don't like DJ Taka. Yeah, I don't like his music.

134
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:39,160
But this song is so good. So yeah, I look forward to that.

135
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,160
Alright, so definitely Bomani fans are going to have to suffer through this TNA game.

136
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Don't suffer! It's actually fun!

137
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Alright, alright. I'll take your word for it.

138
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Rob, just because you're gay doesn't mean that everybody else is going to suffer.

139
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Alright, shut up.

140
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
You might be the only one.

141
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Ah, be quiet.

142
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Alright, so how's UltraMix 2 looking?

143
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,160
It's starting to get a little bit finalized there? Ready to roll?

144
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
UltraMix 2 is looking awesome.

145
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Very nice.

146
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:14,160
It's very, very cool. This was said earlier in the chat room, I think.

147
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:22,160
You know, we give hints out on DDR Freak, and one of our hints to my absolute favorite song on that game, Skulk,

148
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Cutress picked it up and linked everybody to an MP3. That was not quite correct.

149
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,160
It was like a remix of the song. We actually have the original version of the song in the game,

150
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:43,160
So all you trance fans and all that, you're gonna have to cry or something, because the song is not trance. It is synth-pop.

151
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,160
And we're actually gonna play the normal cut of the song. You brought it with you, thank you.

152
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Yeah, because I am now obsessive about this band. I searched the Bay Area just to get the CD.

153
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Took me quite a while, but I did find it, and I absolutely love it.

154
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Alright, cool.

155
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
And we got cookies, which...

156
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh, tell us about the cookie thing! I wanna talk about the cookie thing!

157
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
We'll do that now.

158
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:10,160
So, we have a member on the DDR Freak board that goes by the name El-Mullet, Hi El-Mullet.

159
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Yeah, I know it's a great name, isn't it?

160
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
That's a wonderful name.

161
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,160
And, you know, we're giving our clues out, and I think the clue that we gave was for, like, Night in Motion.

162
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:32,160
You know, everybody comments on when we announce a song, like, oh, yay, or wow, that's crap, or I'm too indecisive.

163
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,520
and el mole it said something I don't remember but then his reply was like

164
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,320
yeah now you guys just need to announce a moonlight shadow and I'll be happy or

165
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,480
something like that and so since you know I know the track listing and I'm

166
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,240
part of the people that are giving out hints I was like okay the next hint I'm

167
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,320
gonna give out is moonlight shadow so I did and he like promised cookies if it

168
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,920
was in the game so you know we went and said moonlight shadows in the game and I

169
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,920
PM'd him the Konami's address. And so he sent cookies.

170
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Somebody actually followed through on that, and he actually sent cookies. What kind of cookies?

171
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Chewy Chocolate Chips Ahoy.

172
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Oh, yummy.

173
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:26,920
But it was so unexpected, and me and Floatwalk were just like, you know, just kidding around about it,

174
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,460
the fact that he went through and did that was so awesome and he also wrote a

175
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:37,340
really nice letter. Oh, I want to read the letter. And it's going to be read on the radio.

176
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,600
Actually, I can't read the whole thing because it's like it's like two

177
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,660
pages. It's a long letter. Yeah. It's a love letter. It says, Secret, I love you, I

178
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,480
want to have your baby. Oh, I'm sorry. That was a different letter. That was the

179
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
letter Lanky Style was writing, I'm sorry. The part that scared me was the part

180
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,360
where, like on the second page, there's blood splattered on it. I was kind of like,

181
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,180
I need to, um, Tarai-chan, uh, not homemade, we requested Chewy Chocolate Chips Ahoy because

182
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,640
we had gone through our entire bag the first day we got it from, from the store, so we

183
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
wanted more.

184
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,480
Yeah, and to point out, by the way, if you want to interact with our chat room, head

185
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,720
on over to our website, www.orangelaunsradio.com and click on chat, and that's how you can

186
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,960
also participate in tonight's, um, clue guessing game, uh, and you'll have your first opportunity

187
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,860
to submit a guess, maybe you're doing a little research on that last sound clip, or maybe

188
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,060
There's really nothing to research at all, and we're just really fucking with you. I don't know we will soon find out

189
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,340
But if you have a guest you'll have your first chance to submit in a little bit, but first I want to talk about the letter

190
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,900
Let's do the letter. Okay. I have to find some letter reading music though. Play Moonlight Shadow, because it's symbolic or something

191
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,900
To all those involved with DDR Ultramix 2

192
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:53,540
you. As promised, here are the cookies. I am a man of my word, and I never expected

193
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,780
such a marvelous development to happen. I mean, Moonlight Shadow is my favorite license

194
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:04,900
of all time, and somehow you guys managed to obtain it. I am impressed, and I am very

195
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:11,120
thankful. I need to thank you, all of you. With your input and your new ideas, you will

196
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,120
be adding an incredible breath of fresh air to a slowly stagnating series.

197
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,600
Without the Xbox side of DDR, I'm not sure if I would be playing the game still. Sure,

198
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,160
the non-stop Anoni modes from the arcade and PS2 mixes are fun, but over the past couple

199
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,000
of years, these modes have slowly been growing old on their own. With the new innovations

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,640
the new American DDR games are receiving, the series would have become stale by now.

201
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,020
Sure, you can add song after song after song on a mix, but there's more to a mix than that.

202
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,640
And so, I offer you these cookies.

203
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,920
Not only for adding my favorite Japanese DDR song onto a US mix, but as a token of my appreciation.

204
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,840
From the game descriptions thus far, you have gone above and beyond the call of duty for

205
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,680
creating a new DDR game, and not simply a rehashed version of a Japanese game.

206
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,280
I never thought I would have become this excited over an Xbox DDR title.

207
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,080
Thank you for going in a different direction and not sticking with the traditional formula.

208
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,840
Is this one of those stories where like at the end like the paraplegic kid starts to

209
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
walk or something?

210
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
I think so.

211
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Here's the last paragraph.

212
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Okay.

213
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,080
You've earned my money, you've earned my respect, and you've earned these cookies.

214
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,840
Take care in your future endeavors and I wish all goes well for the release of the current

215
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
mix.

216
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
A fan, a player, and a grateful person.

217
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Elmo it.

218
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,280
Now see, wasn't that awesome?

219
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
That was very nice.

220
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,760
I'm sad to say that the song got cut at the last minute, so there's no more Moonlight

221
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:40,400
shadow oh we got we got we got we got we got cookies so like we can really cut

222
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,580
that song now we'll cut like three others you shouldn't have said just

223
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,480
kidding because then you got another letter without cookies or cookies with

224
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,840
laxative in them yeah you notice y'all had to go to the bathroom after that one

225
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,880
of our team members did not want to eat the cookies because he thought they were

226
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,400
poisonous and we're like so you'll die by cookie that's like a bad thing or

227
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,500
something

228
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,220
i mean it just goes to show you that

229
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,840
if you're nice

230
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,200
uh... cough

231
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,460
extreme u s board cop

232
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,780
this is directed at you

233
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,640
you might get some good stuff in return so i was going to ask you about this

234
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,400
what i was going to corny and just ask you about this while i have you here, why the hell

235
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,800
aren't you posting anything in the extreme u s thread? Give us a clear answer. Have you read

236
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,900
the u s extreme thread? Yes I have.

237
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,020
i'd like to hear from you know i know why i would be most in their body here

238
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,800
from you know

239
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,860
the extreme u s thread

240
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,300
is very

241
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,660
it to put it in a nice way is a very

242
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,000
annoying and stupid

243
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,400
uh...

244
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,380
but and elmo

245
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,340
signature

246
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,540
sums up the best

247
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,140
this is what goes on the the thread there

248
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,560
being it we want our american mixes to be more japanese

249
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,860
it's just like

250
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,820
if you want the japanese games get the japanese ones if you want the american

251
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,700
games

252
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
to be jeff

253
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,540
it will

254
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,140
they go play in the arcade if you want it at home

255
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:10,340
do something else but quit whining that your mix is not exactly like the japanese

256
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,640
one it never will be

257
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,140
and so

258
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,980
yet we have some people we don't like unfair

259
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,420
well uh...

260
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,520
and it is don't hold back now they think

261
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,560
i think they know what they're talking about

262
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,620
why so-and-so isn't in this version and why this looks like this

263
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,800
they don't know anything

264
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,760
and so we get a a good laugh out of the extreme thread

265
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,020
yeah that's about it

266
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,220
that's all that's good for now

267
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,940
well plus

268
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,260
you have the song list for extreme right? yeah i've played extreme

269
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,240
i know all the unlocks i know all the courses and the unlocks are gonna stay unlocks right?

270
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,340
the unlocks are gonna stay unlocks

271
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,500
extreme is done

272
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,380
okay pretty much i mean it comes out the end of september

273
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,520
you guys can wait

274
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,700
yeah i know it's like

275
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,220
The poor UltraMix people, they don't even know their initial song list yet.

276
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,580
And that only comes out a couple months after.

277
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,660
So we're paying attention to them because, you know, they have, I'm guessing, around

278
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,300
twenty songs announced so far.

279
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,200
It's probably even less than that.

280
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,060
And you guys have a whole forty-five, I think?

281
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,580
So this is just catching up.

282
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,060
Tonight we'll have twenty-one, hopefully somebody will get it.

283
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,060
Tonight's twenty-one, yeah.

284
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
I mean, it doesn't matter.

285
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,420
In fact, you know what guys?

286
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,420
Here's your first chance.

287
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:25,420
For the next three minutes, you can send me a private message if you have a guess on what the song is, and if you get it right, you get to tell everybody.

288
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,420
So here it is, send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your guess.

289
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,420
If you guys honestly get it off that one clue, I might have to send you cookies.

290
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:40,420
And when you say cookies, it's a metaphor for something else, right?

291
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Yeah, it's probably like me boxed up with a little bow tie.

292
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Okay, anyway.

293
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,180
Vandalus is our official timekeeper, by the way, and he'll let you guys know in the chat

294
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,860
room when your time is up, so.

295
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,860
Alright.

296
00:19:52,860 --> 00:20:01,980
Okay, so, um, so, Ultramix 2, and Xtreme, do we have a firm release date for either

297
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,980
one yet?

298
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
I don't know what you can and can't say.

299
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
No.

300
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
We don't have a firm release date.

301
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,980
We just know September-ish.

302
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
You know what?

303
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,500
Xtreme might have one, off the top of my head, I'm not sure what was said in the press release.

304
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,260
You have to go by what's said in the press release.

305
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,100
I might have a more specific date, I might not.

306
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,940
Just look forward to it towards the end of the month.

307
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:29,060
Extreme or not extreme, UltraMix, we're shooting for November sometime.

308
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,660
So you know when you pick up Halo 2, pick up UltraMix 2.

309
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,260
Just get the ones that have number 2 in them, just remember that.

310
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,420
But more specifically the one with UltraMix in the title as well.

311
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,580
It's a really great game.

312
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
That's all I really can say about it, I guess.

313
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
Alright, sounds good.

314
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,580
I'm trying to get the Echo Image song, Skulk.

315
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Okay.

316
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,580
Tell us a little bit about this song.

317
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,580
I don't know if you can talk about where it comes from or anything,

318
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,580
but I don't know what you can say or what you can't say.

319
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,580
Let me, okay.

320
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,580
Echo Image, the song Skulk, is U.S. exclusive, obviously.

321
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Not economy original.

322
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,720
It's... I won't say...

323
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,120
Let me think here. You don't have to say anything more if you don't want to.

324
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,920
When you play the game, there will be a few songs

325
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,320
that you'll notice the background images have URLs in them.

326
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,160
This will be one of them. So...

327
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,360
Yeah. Just know that it's a really good song

328
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,080
and it's probably my favorite, but as everybody can tell you, I have

329
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:43,840
really bad taste in music. Oh, no. No, seriously, like, like, oh, shut up! Kiriyama is the best

330
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:53,040
thing that's ever happened to the... I know, but I was being... joking, too. Um... I'm

331
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:00,120
confused now, great. Um, yeah, so, uh, Echo Image, Skulk, awesome, you guys have been

332
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,280
led astray by Cutriss, because the song you guys have been downloading from Amazon, it

333
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,860
It doesn't sound anything like the actual song, really.

334
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
But we are gonna play the actual song?

335
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,160
Yeah, we're gonna have the actual song up here.

336
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,280
And, actually what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna leave the microphones on, if, now it's cool

337
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
you can do this, right?

338
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,080
You're gonna tell us kinda what portions of the song.

339
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Yeah.

340
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,880
So this is the first time we've really done anything like this, you're gonna tell us kinda

341
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,200
what portions of the song are actually in the game.

342
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Yeah.

343
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Alright.

344
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,920
Just because, I don't know, back when Max 2, Max 1 USA came out, I know people were

345
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,240
like, you leave me alone so awesome, and then what did they do?

346
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,660
it took like one part of the song this is just music and so i kind of don't

347
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,300
want that happen again people you disappointed

348
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,000
well i'm i'm waiting on that i'm kinda stretching time here's a meeting for the

349
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,520
three minutes to run out here that was his keeping time and uh... let me check

350
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,800
the guesses we got three guesses so far

351
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,920
no that's not it white rob

352
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,440
that's not it and j and you know only one gals when we close the windows but

353
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,060
you should read what they they put so i can laugh oh um...

354
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,080
forgot the one that white rob guests sorry

355
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,720
uh... and j f i two four i only take the first guess only get one guess uh...

356
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,260
turn uh... he says the theme to take tracy

357
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,460
and whatever that comes from

358
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,880
nigma says

359
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,340
my guess is one something from elvis or two memories

360
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,040
uh... pointing that's not specific so no and for second thing

361
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,260
i went ok all about what number one i think that something from elvis but

362
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,940
But that's not a song name, so I have to throw that guess out, so you gotta give me song

363
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,940
name and title.

364
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,420
And we prefer on the board reasoning as well, you can't be like, cause you might be able

365
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,700
to get some stab in the dark and like, get a song right, but if you don't have reasoning,

366
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,340
then we're not gonna tell you.

367
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:56,020
And lastly, last pick here, Jazz is saying Silent Hill STFU mix.

368
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,020
Nice guess, but no.

369
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,700
Cutress is in our chat room and he's saying he's being schooled by you.

370
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,460
Oh, there's nothing but love between us, Cutress.

371
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,340
Honestly, I think the mix that we're gonna play here that

372
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,660
Seacred's got, it's not that much different. It's just that the one

373
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,340
that was on the site was a little more trance-y. But I liked it.

374
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,020
Personally, I thought it was a great track. I don't like it. I don't like that mix.

375
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,820
I can't fault him for that because he was just going off

376
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:32,080
know what he saw so you know I'm not really making fun of him right now all

377
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,060
right the other thing I'd like to mention that the whole genre synth pop

378
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,940
at least you know my basing it off of this one group it's pretty much trance

379
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,420
mixed with industrial anyways so yeah I mean it's not that it's a little happier

380
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:51,420
too yeah it's like it's like if you were to take goth music and make it happy and

381
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,760
And add trance to it. There you go

382
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,000
Yes, like so is this a new mic

383
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:07,380
Little bit of information for you to if you didn't know but all trance and techno and all things derivative are all just disco so

384
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,340
All right, you ready to play the song actually wait one thing I want to point out

385
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,180
Where did you finally find this album? I finally found it after a long time of searching at a Rasputin Records

386
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,980
in San Francisco. I had been searching the whole Bay Area. I went to all the

387
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,820
little shops I could find, and then I lucked out, and they had one copy, and

388
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,140
they held it for me. And where was it? Where was it? In the Goth section. In the

389
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:37,620
Goth section. So the music you're about to hear is Goth, according to... Technically, yes. If you

390
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,980
trust Rasputin's titling of their music, it's it's a Goth. All right. Here we go.

391
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,220
here's a song and I'm gonna leave the microphones on so studio just you know

392
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,100
the microphones are still hot you know I'll just tell you what part isn't in it

393
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,460
instead of telling you you know this is it starts okay then you tell us what

394
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:00,220
parts are in it oh okay here we go

395
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:16,540
Okay, yeah, this is obviously the intro to the song, but we have that too.

396
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:34,920
You know, this part right here actually is also in it.

397
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,660
The section of the music that sounded just like this a second ago, that's not in it.

398
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
There's a bit of a difference.

399
00:26:41,660 --> 00:27:10,060
the difference.

400
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:17,060
This part here is not in the game at all, so whenever the guy is seen by himself like this, it's not in there.

401
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,060
Which is not a big loss, even though I think the song is good.

402
00:27:47,060 --> 00:28:11,860
This music right here is still not in it

403
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:27,660
Trust me, there is music in this song that we have, so it's, I don't, it's the chat room

404
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,460
people like, they know what they're talking about too.

405
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,540
Once again, he's singing, so that means it's not the game.

406
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Yeah, pretty much we have the beginning of the song and the end of the song.

407
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,540
We mix that...

408
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,540
What mix?

409
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540
This is on UltraMix.

410
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,380
Two.

411
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:28,540
Okay, this music, we actually have. So, rejoice in it or something.

412
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:52,540
The first time I heard this, it was like 80s music, but maybe I just know it's from pop.

413
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:59,540
Okay, actually, from here on out, the rest is an UltraMix, so, cool.

414
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:28,040
So, let it keep me hanging on

415
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Understand me now

416
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,040
The frequent of the beat gets higher

417
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:45,040
So yeah, this song will definitely, um, from people I've talked to that have heard this song, they think it's probably gonna be the breakout song for this mix.

418
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Um, and this music right here is not actually in the game, I lied.

419
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Um, so just up until the point where he kinda fades out is in the game.

420
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:01,040
I'll let the last 30 seconds of the full mix play out.

421
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Yeah, now isn't this totally a goth song? Shouldn't you be wearing black nail polish and makeup?

422
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Yeah, now isn't this totally a goth song? Shouldn't you be wearing black nail polish and makeup?

423
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Alright, that's Echo Image with Skulk, with Seager doing some narrations there about what's in and not in the game.

424
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
My new favorite band! I love it!

425
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:34,040
So, you were kind of saying over there, they might not have heard it, what was kind of the reaction of the song around The Office from the testers?

426
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,040
People think it's a really great song, and it's probably going to be like the breakout song for the game.

427
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:46,040
for the game. I mean, it's from a band you've never heard of, and so now you'll know that

428
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:54,220
what? It's like, you can go find their CDs if you hunt hard enough, or actually you can

429
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:02,820
get online pretty easily, but I wouldn't be surprised if we do Ultramix 3 or something

430
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,980
or something, that we might have to pay a lot of money to get some

431
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,060
band like this now. If it really is that well-received.

432
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,100
I think it's a great song and I agree I think it's gonna be one of those songs that

433
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,060
suddenly the band is gonna get noticed by all these DDR people, they're gonna be like

434
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,580
why all these DDR people go away?

435
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,980
But I think it's a great song. It's kinda like, I kinda compared it to Dark Black

436
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,420
Forest which I sorta saw as kinda like a breakout song from Max USA. I know a lot of

437
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,140
people kinda feel

438
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,180
about it, but it was kind of a song like nobody knew who the hell that guy was

439
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,180
And then a lot of people were like, hey, but the song's pretty cool, except for that vocal part.

440
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Where are we going?

441
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,180
Now here's what they need to do.

442
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Because there's going to be, of course, a lot of these commercial artists,

443
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
some of which might not be known.

444
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,180
They need to do what they've done with DDR Extreme

445
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,180
and do their live shows, tour these people that you might not have heard of before,

446
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,180
and do these songs in a giant tour. That'd be awesome.

447
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:01,180
The kind of sad thing about it, though, since I'm now a huge fan of this band,

448
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,180
is that this song is back from, like, 2001, and I believe it's the singer has left the band.

449
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:15,180
So, actually, if you go to their website, echoimage.com, I believe, they have new tracks that they're working on up for download,

450
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,180
or they did last time I checked, to kind of show off some of their new stuff.

451
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:24,180
I haven't actually listened to their new stuff yet, but this CD's good, so I guess that's all that matters.

452
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,180
Alright, so hope you enjoyed that track. Anybody else want to comment on the song?

453
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Yeah, I think Denise Richards has a really big butt.

454
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
But it has nothing to do with the song.

455
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Shush.

456
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,580
Shame on you.

457
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,260
Anybody else want to comment on?

458
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,060
No.

459
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,060
Rice Princess, I know you go to, well, I'll get back to Rice Princess.

460
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,020
Let Dark Sakura make her comment.

461
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,140
Rice Princess, just give the mic to somebody.

462
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,300
Give it to Dark Sakura.

463
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,900
She's the host.

464
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,620
She gets to talk.

465
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,500
I'm sorry.

466
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,000
All right.

467
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,500
I'm so sorry.

468
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,660
Rice Princess, I know you go to a lot of golf clubs sometimes.

469
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,420
Is that, or at least one.

470
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,020
Is that a song you'd expect to hear there?

471
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,780
Well, you know...

472
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,460
As the night is tragic!

473
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,460
It doesn't sound like a bat, so, no, I'm kidding.

474
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,740
No, it doesn't.

475
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,900
It doesn't sound anything like I would hear at

476
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,340
a Goth club. I could definitely hear that at an industrial type club.

477
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:25,140
Something that would play like, you know, KM FDM and stuff like that could definitely go into this.

478
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,180
You got Goth served.

479
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,460
Yeah, it's just a little too techno. Maybe I'm just

480
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,660
like used to more of the stuff that was like out in the 90s.

481
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,860
Maybe the new Goth stuff is different, but

482
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,820
I don't know. I haven't really heard a lot of new

483
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,340
Gothic music, so.

484
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,440
Also, I wanted to point out while I was looking for this CD in the Goth section,

485
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,220
I found stuff like Delirium in there, which I don't think there's...

486
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,540
Delirium? No, that was the other one.

487
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,760
yeah that's right

488
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,040
you know the whole thing that's been going on with the gothic scene nowadays

489
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,840
they're all gravers

490
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,920
and if you don't know what a graver is

491
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,680
like a gothic raver

492
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,520
who is open the door dammit

493
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,060
chamber door

494
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,080
you do not touch the cable modem

495
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,240
don't even look at it

496
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,160
walk in

497
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,920
enter

498
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,700
move towards away from the cable modem

499
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,080
there you go

500
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:35,080
We got explicit. Again, for those who are just joining us tonight, Comcast's modem that we have from them has been giving us issues all week, so we're afraid that if anybody looks at it funny, we're going to disconnect, and all you guys will get dropped from the show, and we'll have to reconnect, and all that ugly stuff.

501
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Oh sure, don't introduce our guest.

502
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Oh yeah, explicit's here. Well, he's been here every week, so...

503
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
We have to...

504
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
They know who he is.

505
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Alright.

506
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Jamie, you had a comment you wanted to make earlier we weren't able to get to.

507
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Yeah, you raised your hand trying to grab the mic and you didn't get it.

508
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,080
I like the song. Okay.

509
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,080
Right on. So like on a cage match scale of one to ten?

510
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Eight.

511
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Eight?

512
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,080
I mean, it was kind of repetitive and then it changed.

513
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,080
It's like, I was sort of like falling back into the whole, okay, this is cool.

514
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,080
Oh wait, it's different now. So, that was good.

515
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,080
I like songs that sort of get me stuck on a pattern and then change suddenly.

516
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
So it's pretty cool.

517
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Right on.

518
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
I listen to it.

519
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:30,080
So, I'm trying to think if there's any other UltraMix or Extreme-related questions that we can ask Seagurd before we-

520
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
What color's the box?

521
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Stop.

522
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:41,320
Uh, what uh, actually I have questions about other Konami games.

523
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,720
I can try to answer them.

524
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,480
Can you give us any new news on Silent Hill 4 The Room, other than the fact that it's

525
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,080
coming out soon?

526
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:59,320
It's really fun, and I've beaten it many times, because I, yeah, um, no, it's coming out for

527
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,260
Xbox here. That and PC, I guess. That's the big thing about Silent Hill 4 here. And the

528
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,940
soundtrack, which we kind of talked about a couple weeks ago. It was really good. And

529
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,940
it's still really good.

530
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,420
Jamie managed to get a copy of it, right? From the store?

531
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:23,540
Yeah. It's available now. I think it's really only for pre-orders. And people who live with

532
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:30,100
GameStop employees, apparently. Those cheaters. Not supporting Silent Hill 4.

533
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:37,820
Oh, if it's pre-ordered, it's cool then. But yeah, Silent Hill 5 has recently been talked

534
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:44,220
about out on the internet. It won't happen until the next generation of consoles, which

535
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,300
is sad. And, you know, at the same time, it could be really good. Yeah, not until the

536
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:53,500
next generation consoles. They actually really haven't decided which brand they're going

537
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:59,480
going to, if they're going to Microsoft or Sony. They'll probably do both, but yeah.

538
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,200
So that's up with Silent Hill stuff, I guess. Any news you can give us on Gradius 5, other

539
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,160
than, well, I guess we all saw the Classic Gaming Xbox, right?

540
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
Yeah, it's like coming out September 6th. What else can I, you already caught up on

541
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,180
Rumble Roses, what else is coming out of Super Konami, Suicoden IV?

542
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:19,040
It was originally slated for a hopeful November release. It is now pushed back into January,

543
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,200
which makes me sad. Thank goodness my copy will be here next week, the Japanese

544
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,400
one at least, so I'll get to play some of that. Okay, we have a question. Hold on.

545
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:43,120
Yes. East 6. It's pretty cool. I've not really had a chance to play it.

546
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,480
I've watched a little bit of it. I know there are some people complaining about

547
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,960
about some issues that Konami is doing with the game, like the sprite models or something,

548
00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:01,440
how they're 3D now instead of 2D. I don't understand the complaints, but yeah, it looks

549
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,720
pretty good, really nice, graphically.

550
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,240
Did you say somebody was complaining that they changed the sprites from 2D to 3D for

551
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,000
E6, because the game was originally all in 3D?

552
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,780
what I'm saying but you know internet people can be stupid yeah it's not it's

553
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,140
not comics decision you can't blame the company that's just bringing it out or

554
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,660
you can I guess if they did the same exact thing when Suikoden 3 came out

555
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:38,160
because they went to the crappy looking blocky 3d models if they they they

556
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,700
looked it's it's okay for Suikoden 4 is like the best looking game in that

557
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:51,700
I can't believe you work for Konami and you're not corrupted and play Yu-Gi-Oh like all the other employees do.

558
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Not all the other employees, just a select few.

559
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:51,700
and sent it around the internet saying that it was a PC version of Silent Hill 1, even though there was never been a PC version of Silent Hill 1.

560
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:57,700
Has Konami ever, like, said anything about this? Have they noticed this and said, like, hey, or anything about it?

561
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Um, I have never heard of that personally, and I pretty much can say that there never was a Silent Hill PC version.

562
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,980
Once again, it's the internet full of stupid people

563
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:17,580
But yeah, if it were if there were a Silent Hill PC version, I would be one of the people to know about it. So

564
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,340
Crazy question from the chat room and I think even I could answer this one

565
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,140
But okay

566
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,180
let me let me break their hearts once to know about the Simpsons arcade game ever possibly coming out on Gameboy Advance and

567
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,820
I can answer this

568
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,820
Acclaim does all the licenses for The Simpsons, correct? Not Konami?

569
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:56,820
Yeah, this is kind of related. We got an email from some stupid person asking, yeah I know it's great, I think of them highly, asking us to bring out a Final Fantasy 7 fighting game.

570
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,820
And it was the funny...

571
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:05,820
Well, yeah, there's Eregas, but I really don't remember when we merged with Square Enix, so...

572
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,820
Squeenixnami!

573
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
Squeenixnami!

574
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Squeenami!

575
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,820
I like Squeenami, I have to say.

576
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,820
Squeenami.

577
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,820
There's some funny people that send in some great emails, and that's just one of their best ones.

578
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:32,820
I want to know if you guys are going to release a good Ridge Racer.

579
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,820
I really like the Pac-Man car.

580
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,820
Alright, we've got to get the show moving, because we've got a ton of Imani news to get to too,

581
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,820
and I think Seagrid wants to give some more clues soon.

582
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,820
Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

583
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:55,900
The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you, each host, myself, Loki,

584
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,060
and Dark Sacra.

585
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,820
We each pick one song to play for you guys, and you're going to pick your favorite of

586
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,820
the three songs.

587
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:08,140
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio in our Bomani

588
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:15,420
Music and More program, which is on the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

589
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:22,100
We have to be in our chat room to participate though, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click

590
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,100
on chat.

591
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,300
And we're going to do the first song, which won last week, and it was a track that was

592
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:36,700
by Outfaze, although we all deemed it to be fake, not really an Outfaze song, but for

593
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,700
whatever reason you guys liked it anyway, and it was Loki's pick, and the song is new

594
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,160
on and it won last week, so we only get to hear a clip of it because it was the winner.

595
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,680
So here it is, not out phase with Nuon, last week's winner.

596
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Oh

597
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:56,840
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, DJ Taka and Tack with Outfaze

598
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
and Nuon.

599
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:04,300
Next up in tonight's cage match is Jamie's pick, but first, Seagurd, didn't you bring

600
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,380
something else you wanted to play for our listeners tonight?

601
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,620
He's nodding yes, they can't hear him because he's in the kitchen, but I'll go ahead and

602
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:21,020

00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:40,380

606
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:47,380
chat room, have fun kids. Alright, back into our cage match. Song number two is from Jamie

607
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:54,140
Tonight, and what is your pick tonight, Jamie? Something from Basement Jaxx, I don't remember.

608
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,780
The song was Lucky Star, if you needed it. Oh yeah, Lucky Star from Basement Jaxx. Alright,

609
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,820
any particular reason you wanted to pick this song? Cause I like it. Alright. I was high

610
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:11,820
Alright, here it is, Basement Jaxx with Lucky Star, it's song number two in tonight's cage match. Enjoy!

611
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,820
but not obliviously

612
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,820
systematically and vigorously

613
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,820
society became so guilty

614
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,820
just quick to move on

615
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,820
nothing that helps us

616
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,820
we went up so ridiculously

617
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,820
beauty portrayed so innocently

618
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,820
us natives act immigrately

619
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,820
we were carrying on to poverty

620
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,820
little justice crammed the wall

621
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,820
i was born in a court of the prophet

622
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,820
yes i was a stan

623
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,820
just put money on trial

624
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,820
robbery started affecting me

625
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,820
kept me in the sky

626
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,820
in the old field

627
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,820
i watched state music

628
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,820
see a state

629
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,820
to the front

630
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,820
get to the house on the hill

631
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,040
I'm living straight up a reason, pecking, crying

632
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,540
I've come far in a little long way

633
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,540
I would just like to say I feel fine

634
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,540
Cause I will die for a little long day

635
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,540
The streets right here don't pay so great

636
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,140
I was letting in a little long stay

637
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,140
I would just like to say I feel great

638
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,540
So don't make me lost

639
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,540
Won't you lie back? I've been doing money for a trip

640
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,340
Let's move on, we'll begin

641
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,840
Won't you lie back, boy? And let's have a world war

642
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,340
Call and not be rude

643
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,340
Won't you lie back, radio one, two, three

644
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,840
Pay your taxes till the neighbors see

645
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,840
Won't you lie back? I'm sitting here for a school break

646
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,840
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be

647
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
Oh

648
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:52,120
Welcome back to song number two of Bassman Jaxx with Lucky Star.

649
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,840
Let's go around and see what the folks in here thought, but remember, it's up to you

650
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,440
guys in the end, so you have to be in our chat room too, I guess.

651
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,440
Uh, dark saccharine.

652
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,720
I like songs with like a lot of beat and a lot of rhythm, but like a lot of substance. It's not too high

653
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,720
I'm putting an air sounding, you know

654
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,600
That one was really good and solid to me

655
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:15,440
I mean something that if I really want to listen to substantial music I'd listen to that and so I'd give it about a

656
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,120
nine

657
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,120
Not attentive. It's not that touch of

658
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,120
but

659
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,120
It gets nice. Alrighty

660
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,720
I'll go next. Um, I thought it was kind of cool

661
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:30,820
It actually kind of reminded me just a little bit of some of the j-pop stuff you've been playing for me lately

662
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,380
I think I can see why you like that one

663
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,500
Just a little bit like it kind of sounds like a bit of that end flow a little bit

664
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,460
I'm not so sure I dig the rapping, but I like the instrumentation quite a bit. So

665
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,580
Seven and a half eight ish somewhere in there Jonas

666
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,640
explicit, sorry

667
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,140
Call me and eat some stuff.

668
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,840
Um...

669
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,640
Okay, okay, okay, no kidding.

670
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,340
Okay, daddy.

671
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,240
Okay, not everything, sorry.

672
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,340
Anyways, I'll give it an 8 out of 10.

673
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,540
Pretty good.

674
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,740
I wouldn't give it, like, a 9 out of 10,

675
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,540
because they have some flaws and stuff, but...

676
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:08,240
It's not perfect, but it's pretty good for someone to listen to.

677
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,940
All right. Angel?

678
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,540
Good instrumental. I liked it in school.

679
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:16,440
And you know what I mean by when I say instrumental, so...

680
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,440
Um, probably Solid 8.

681
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
Alright, Solid 8 from Angel.

682
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,440
Secret and Rice Princess, do you guys have a comment on this one?

683
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,440
On this song, bass and jam.

684
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,440
We're doing Cage Match? I'm eating a cookie.

685
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,440
So I give the cookie an 8.

686
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,440
Alright, I'm not even going to ask Rice Princess what smartass thing she has to say.

687
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,440
I'm just going to go to the next song, which is my song!

688
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,440
And, um, as I promised last week, I am bringing in Danny Minogue this week.

689
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,000
week, except this is not one of her songs. It's a song featuring Danny Minogue, so it's

690
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
just her vocals. And actually, the artist is Riva, who did a really good remix of I.O.

691
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,920
with Rapture. I don't know if you guys know that song, but if you know that song you heard

692
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,960
in clubs, they did that remix. It's really awesome. So this is Riva, featuring Danny

693
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Minnow with who do you love now? Enjoy!

694
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:40,960
When you toss it off your head, you're too far from perfection, perfection

695
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:55,960
We're an empty world, we're an empty world

696
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,960
And it's hard to break it, heaven

697
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,960
We love you

698
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,960
And it's hard to break it, heaven

699
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,960
We love you

700
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,960
We love you

701
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:37,960
I know you're coming just for me I try to remember what I've been through

702
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,960
Cause it goes along transfusions

703
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,960
Cause it's down to gray I see

704
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,960
How can life not seem so pretty, so pretty

705
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,960
Fighting to breathe

706
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,960
Fighting to breathe

707
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,960
Fighting to breathe

708
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,960
You're fighting to breathe

709
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,960
And it's hard to break it, haven't

710
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,960
Who do you love now?

711
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,960
And it's hard to break it, haven't

712
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:28,960
Who do you love now?

713
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:56,960
And it's hard to break it, have it And it's hard to break it, have it

714
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:37,180
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

715
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,580
Reva featuring Danny Minogue.

716
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,960
Who do you love now?

717
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,540
Let's see if it was loved now or hated now.

718
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,780
Dark Sakura.

719
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,140
It's Trancy.

720
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,820
And I like trance, but I've lately just been so burned on.

721
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,820
Trancy Trancy.

722
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,780
But it was really good.

723
00:57:53,780 --> 00:58:01,340
So, um, I'll give it a seven and a half to eight, so yeah, it was good, it was really,

724
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,340
it was really solid.

725
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,340
Alright.

726
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,340
Sounds good.

727
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,340
Uh, me voting.

728
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,340
And her voice didn't annoy me this time.

729
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,340
Me voting?

730
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,340
I think it's great.

731
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,340
I give it a nine.

732
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,340
Enough said.

733
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,340
Uh, Loki.

734
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,340
Hi, my name's Danny Monod.

735
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:16,660
I don't have an original bone in my body.

736
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,660
She's basically Kylie Monod Two.

737
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:23,760
I'm gonna take everything that she makes and make it my own, yeah!

738
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,680
One thing you should know if you were paying attention to the chatroom, they're talking

739
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,320
about how they took Kylie Minogue's leg, cut it off, and grew it in a giant nascent jar

740
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,440
with toothpicks to grow Danny.

741
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,440
Hey, that's cool, you know, if you wanted to do that to like, you know, some of the

742
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,080
other hot chicks out there.

743
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
I'd be down with that.

744
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,800
That's all we need is hot clones.

745
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,200
Screw cloning ugly people.

746
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,160
Oh yeah, I give it a seven because it was eh.

747
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,480
Uh, TDR Angel, what did you think of that one?

748
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,480
I liked it, duh.

749
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,480
I mean, we all know why, right?

750
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:03,480
I guess I'll give it an 8. No, I'm not trying to copy myself from last time, I just thought that, yeah.

751
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:11,480
Right, an 8 from Angel. Jonas? 8. 8, simply 8. Simply just sounds like the same, but still pretty good.

752
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:18,480
Is anybody in the kitchen, Seeger, Rice Princess, and Linktail have a comment on that one?

753
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,360
And they say hi, and we like the cookies all right fair enough

754
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,600
All right, we got to do the voting fast tonight. So please think about your vote and

755
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:33,020
We're going to play a quick recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight song number one last week's winner

756
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,240
Not out phase with a new on

757
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:59,560
Alright, song number two tonight, Basement Jax with Lucky Star.

758
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,560
All right, song number three, Riva featuring Danny Minogue,

759
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,560
Who Do You Love Now?

760
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,560
The way I feel, how can my love feel?

761
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:14,560
No feeling, no feeling, fighting to me.

762
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,560
All right, those are the three songs.

763
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,560
Place, vote now, and you only have a minute to vote,

764
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,560
so please place your vote now.

765
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,560
And we got to hurry up and get through this

766
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,560
because I do want to open up guessing.

767
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Not yet, do not send guesses on the song yet,

768
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,560
But I'm going to open it up as soon as Cage Match voting is over, so please hurry. Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

769
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:47,560
You know what that song sounded like, though? That Danny Minogue song? It sounded like that one, um, Atari Hikaru, uh, song, um, that was like, you know, Devil or some- Devil Inside, I don't know. What was that? One song? I don't remember the name.

770
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:52,560
Oh, the one I played a couple weeks ago, the Devil Inside song? I'd bring it up, but it's going to take too much.

771
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:56,560
It sounds just like that. It has the same beat to it.

772
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,560
Well, maybe those are just songs I, uh, really enjoy this week, I don't know.

773
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,560
Or maybe because Danny Minogue can't be original!

774
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:09,560
I don't know, I don't know what to tell you. Uh, Seagurd, I hate, I hate to tear you away from the conversation, but I had a really good question come in.

775
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:17,560
During, while the cage match was going on. Oh, I know. God, you mean you gotta come talk to Rob? God, he's gonna yell at me again.

776
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:22,560
I completely understand. Okay, what are these people interrupting my conversation in the kitchen for?

777
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,880
Alright, let's see, the question was...

778
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,040
Who is it by? So I don't know if I'm actually going to address it.

779
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,560
Cutris. Is that microphone going out?

780
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,760
I don't know, is it? Probably. I'm just hearing a lot of static.

781
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,320
Oh, it's the cords. Alright, careful guys.

782
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,840
Was DDR involved at all in Konami's Friday

783
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,240
press event? GameStop's coverage didn't have anything in it at all, even though it is

784
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:47,800
covered

785
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,160
in Karaoke Revolution Xbox, or I'm sorry, even though it did cover

786
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,320
Karaoke Revolution Xbox and Karaoke Revolution 3.

787
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,520
To my knowledge, I don't believe there's any DDR information,

788
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,680
but you have to understand that we have lives on the weekend,

789
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,920
and I didn't even know until today that there was a press event on,

790
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:11,480
what, Friday? So, like, I first heard about that stupid Suikoden 4 pushback

791
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:17,040
today, and as Rob can attest, I was kind of vocal and loud and angry about it,

792
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,040
But yeah, I don't think anything was announced.

793
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:29,040
Your best source of information will always be something you'll hear from the Vivid members on DDRFreak.

794
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,040
And Orangeless.

795
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,040
That microphone's going out, can we get some electric tape on that?

796
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,040
God dammit! Stop breaking the damn mic!

797
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,040
I'm gonna kill all you people!

798
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,040
You keep replacing mics every week because you keep swinging them around!

799
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,040
Or maybe he's spilling soda on them!

800
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,040
I am microphone...

801
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,040
If you guys are coming out completely on that microphone...

802
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,040
I'm gonna go to...

803
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,040
I'm gonna go to kind of like an emergency break here while we uh...

804
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,040
Fix the microphone, so let's go to...

805
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,040
Let's see, I'm gonna tally up the cage match votes here.

806
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,040
Let's see, stop it.

807
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
Let's go to...

808
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,040
It works fine.

809
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,040
No, see, you can hear it.

810
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:19,980
you can hear it all right let's just go to err and we'll be back

811
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:40,160
All right, we're back, and hopefully we have that microphone fixed.

812
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,160
Not sure.

813
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,160
you yelled at it and it works?

814
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,160
who's got it now?

815
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,160
why can't you people talk to her?

816
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
see? it's not working right now

817
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,160
woah! I pushed it in and it sounds like it's working now

818
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,160
see? I told you something was going on there

819
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,160
it's because it doesn't like her, it likes me

820
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,160
this microphone likes me, just see, look, it's working just fine now

821
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,160
cause I used my secret woman power on it

822
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,160
and now it works

823
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,160
alright

824
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,440
Use the power of estrogen on this microphone

825
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,880
The power of estrogen compels me I

826
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,880
Need a young priest in an old priest. All right, I need some split pea soup

827
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,420
I'm getting the last few votes for cage match titled

828
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,920
It's too late to submit a vote a lot of votes for that song coming in at the last minute

01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,880

830
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:43,520
this week's cage match once again not out phase with new on a lot of votes

844
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:56,060
talk about some other Bomani news that came up this week and let's see that

845
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:00,200
news would be about the all the Bomani games that were announced for earlier

846
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:06,020
this week such as pop and music 10 is coming out November 18th also coming out

847
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,300
November 18th 8th style 2d x8 style will be out for the home versions so this is

848
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:16,300
some big news. We get two Bimani games in one day. Also announced initially was this

849
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:23,060
new thing called DDR Festival. It was something called DDR Festival, but then Konami pulled

850
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:33,260
it off their page, but... What, Seagurd? Seagurd, come here and tell us about this.

851
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:50,260
I don't know why people are like, oh, they took it down, it's not real. It's a real game.

852
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:53,260
People are taking pre-orders for it. Shut up.

853
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,260
Is there anything you can tell us about DDR Festival?

854
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:00,260
Not really. Festival.

855
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:09,260
No, not really. I know a little bit of stuff, but nothing I can actually say.

856
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:18,260
Alright, nothing you can actually say, that's fine. Alright, anything you've heard about the pop music and the 8 style stuff?

857
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:27,260
That's all, like, Konami of Japan stuff, and, you know, it's all taken care of over there, so.

858
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:29,260
Alright.

859
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:33,260
If it comes through our offices, though, you won't hear about it till it comes out.

860
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:37,260
Because it'd be, like, a huge thing, probably.

861
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:44,260
Alright, so, what was your guys' reaction? Because I know that there's been a lot of, like, kind of question, like,

862
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:49,220
like when's 10th pop music 10 gonna be announced because I even know that Navi our

863
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,820
resident pop music horror was here a couple weeks ago and he was kind of like

864
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,860
what usually about now would be when they're announcing pop in town but they

865
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:59,500
haven't yet and then to kind of get eight style without a two-year wait

866
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:04,260
like we felt like we had last time. Konami had huge success with seven style

867
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:09,420
so obviously it made sense them to bring out eight. As for pop music if you're

868
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:13,060
worried about that going away anytime soon just look at the arcade one it's

869
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:18,060
It's like on, you know, Popping Music 387, since they came out daily, pretty much.

870
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:22,060
D.E.R. was a surprise, though, that's for sure.

871
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,060
Yeah.

872
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,060
It's Japan.

873
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,060
But, well, I guess you probably can't say if there's any truth to the iToy thing or

874
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,700
not, but I know that's a rumor that's going around.

875
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,700
That is a rumor indeed.

876
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,700
All right.

877
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,700
But you can neither confirm or deny it.

878
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,700
That's fine.

879
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,700
No.

880
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,700
All right.

881
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,900
So, what about, like, I know you said this before on the show, something about 2DX8 style

882
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:42,940
coming out was the biggest thing for you, and now here's the news, November 18th.

883
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:52,940
7th Style, I really like the soundtrack a lot, because to me that's the Kiryamoka soundtrack, you know, it's got the most Kiryamoka tunes as any soundtrack.

884
01:09:52,940 --> 01:10:01,940
Oh yeah, 5th, it's got a lot too, but every single Kiryamoka song on 7th is my favorite, which is kind of weird, 3 songs being my favorite, but whatever.

885
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:15,940
So I like 7th Style, but I hated the, you know, obviously the price tag is way too high, and the whole, like, the whole problems we had to go through just to get it, you know, going on the Japanese site and getting fake, you know, information just to get them to send it here.

886
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:28,940
So then when I heard about this coming out, I was just like, wow, awesome, because 8th Style is definitely my favorite soundtrack, period. I mean, just, I can listen to the 8th Style soundtrack from beginning to end, and there's probably only one song on there I don't like, Monkey Dance. Anyway.

887
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,940
I love Monkey Dance, you shut up.

888
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,940
Yeah, I bet you love Monkey Dance, you monkey lover.

889
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:33,940
Shut up.

890
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:38,940
But yeah, so that's awesome. I just hope it means that they'll continue to make these games for home versions, because I'd like to see 9th style.

891
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:44,940
You know, I'd love to play a 9th style and a 10th style that doesn't have a fucking lag or timing issue, you know?

892
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,940
So, hopefully they'll continue to make them.

893
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:55,940
I mean, even if they're not going to keep making DDR stuff, Japanese DDR games, then hey, 2DX is my original love anyway.

894
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:56,940
Alright.

895
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,940
Or BeatMania, whatever.

896
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:01,940
Anybody else have anything they want to say on Pop'n Music 10 or 2DX8 style?

897
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,940
Angel's coming up to say something.

898
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:05,940
Gotta make my order, you know.

899
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:09,940
I am going to be so broke between all the games in the U.S. coming out.

900
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,940
Oh God, I just want to scream. It's so horrible.

901
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,940
I mean, it's great, but at the same time my bank account is crying.

902
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,940
Angel.

903
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,940
Hey, here goes the mic again. Oh, never mind. I can't hear myself. Yay!

904
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,540
uh... yes so

905
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:27,320
i am definitely going to buy a txt and

906
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,120
public and

907
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,520
uh... hopefully the orange it's on

908
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,380
txt because yeah it's orange

909
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,780
i was trying to make a pun there but i guess it just did

910
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:42,740
and uh... ten hoping to hang out there

911
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,500
okay there

912
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,780
uh... probably ten obviously uh...

913
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,540
jenny's cuz katie's cool

914
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,580
uses

915
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:54,580
I think we're going to go to, oh, I wanted to do some more, um, song guesses real fast.

916
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:56,580
Can somebody tell Seagurd to come in real fast?

917
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,580
Tell Seagurd to come in real fast. They went outside to have a smoke or something.

918
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:06,580
Sorry, I got more guesses.

919
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,580
Alright, here we go. More guesses, Seagurd.

920
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,580
Okay.

921
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,580
Alright, voting is, er, your guest time is closed for right now.

922
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:23,860
Um, let's see. White Rob says, um, Giluami tell.

923
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:28,060
Well, well, that's not what they said.

924
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:32,660
But Jamie, I'm just saying what they said. Okay, Jamie says William tell.

925
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:36,260
No. It's not in any way. Oh, I get it. It's French. Well, I'm too,

926
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:41,700
you know, honky. Not French. Alright. That was some good reasoning, though.

927
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,140
What was the reasoning? Um, because something about,

928
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:48,820
he said something about tattletales and then something about the galloping was

929
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:50,140
supposed to symbolize the

930
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,940
William Tell overture, because Tell, I don't know. Okay. I mean, you know,

931
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:57,660
you can come up with good reasoning and I'll give you, you know, a thumbs up for that, but it's still wrong.

932
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:00,900
MJSI24 says, across the nightmare. No.

933
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:05,020
No reasoning also, so even if it was right, I wouldn't tell you.

934
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:09,980
And then we have, uh, let's see...

935
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:14,980
Cabut says, bad girls by Julia Roberts just because of that

936
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:20,220
quote we played earlier. No. No. Alright. But hey, you gave reasoning. That's good.

937
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:25,620
I guess we'll have to do another hint somewhat soon. Yeah. Alright. We're going to take a

938
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:29,540
break and we'll be back to talk about more stuff. Maybe we'll get into the FUs of the

939
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:33,420
week pretty soon. That sounds like an idea to me. We're going to get into the FUs of

940
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:38,880
the week when we come back so you can send FUs to Sky in the chat room after this break

941
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:45,880
featuring music from Poppin' Music 10 and 2DX8 style. We'll be back.

942
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:45,880
Alright, uh, we had more we wanted to play, but Seagurd, you had something you wanted to ask me about.

943
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,880
Yeah, you know that...

944
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
Wait, use my microphone.

945
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,880
You know that game show back in the day, that Let's Make a Deal?

946
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,880
Yeah, I've heard of that show.

947
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,880
Remember when they would pick the wrong curtain and that funny thing would happen?

948
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,880
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, the goat and stuff? Yeah, that was great.

949
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,880
Yes, yes, I think so too.

950
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,480
It was clue-a-riffic.

951
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:15,480
I think so too.

952
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,480
You

953
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:35,480
Are you ready to dance through the night?

954
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,480
Begging the root of my heart, it was right there

955
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,480
Should you read your magic?

956
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,480
Under the moonlight

957
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,480
Bounds of light, the bloody feet of

958
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,480
Love what's me, I don't know why

959
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,480
Do you understand this move?

960
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,480
From the hell that God is watching me?

961
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,480
Monkey dance, monkey dance

962
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,480
Like a star

963
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,480
Shake your body down

964
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,480
Move your body down, step on the monkey down

965
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:09,480
Let's get together, hold on for your baby

966
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,480
Monkey dance, monkey dance, let me share

967
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:17,480
Move your body down, step on the monkey down

968
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:23,480
Look at this building, do the razzle-doo tonight

969
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:53,240
For some reason, it's come to my attention that not everybody may have picked up what

970
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:58,100
Secret and I were talking about there before that song, so can we grab Secret again real

971
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:02,280
fast? Tell him I'm really sorry, but for some reason, some people didn't hear it, so we'll

972
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:08,420
do it one more time. Secret, I'm sorry. For some reason, people couldn't hear what you

973
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:11,340
were asking me about. I have no idea what the hell's going on, but some people missed

974
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:16,140
it, so again, we'll use my mic here. You wanted to ask me about something during this break.

975
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:20,960
It's not going to be as cool this time, but hey, you know that show, that game show, Let's

976
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:21,960
Make a Deal?

977
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,800
Yes, I still remember that show, that's the one where they dress up and shit, right?

978
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,160
Yeah, wasn't it, or do you remember that thing, you know, when they picked the wrong door

979
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,420
or curtain?

980
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,440
I do remember that with the goats and stuff.

981
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,200
Yeah, that was awesome, wasn't it?

982
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:42,480
Why, yes, I think it was, and I think it's really great that you're asking me about it.

983
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:49,480
Isn't it clue-rific or hint-tastic?

984
01:22:42,480 --> 01:23:11,480
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

985
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:19,980
We are back, and some of you guys are probably doing a little bit of research right now.

986
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:25,980
I'm very interested in some of the stuff I'm reading in the chatroom. Very interesting theories going on there.

987
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:30,980
So I can't wait to open it up to do another round of guesses, because I think maybe somebody could get it this time.

988
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:36,980
I think other people are just thinking we are completely smoking crack, which wouldn't be too far from the truth, actually.

989
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:46,980
And you know, if you read the Extreme Thread, we like to throw out stuff that doesn't make any sense, or might not be a clue.

990
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:52,980
This is actually an honest-to-goodness clue, I'll say that right now, so if you're thinking we're just blowing smoke up, nah, we're not.

991
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:58,980
If somebody gets the song tonight, so we actually get to play the song, then we will explain all the clues as well.

992
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:04,980
And you're gonna hit yourself, or not, or you'll still think we smoke crack, which is fine. You can go ahead and think that. Screw you.

993
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:09,900
screw you alright so now we're gonna get into tonight's F use of the week I

994
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:15,060
advise you though that if you send your F you via the chat room it better be good

995
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,000
or it may not be read because there's a lot of people in the shower tonight we

996
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,680
are only gonna have to be selective in reading chat room F use tonight so Jamie

997
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:28,140
though this is your baby right the F use of the week and why why do we love the

998
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:32,040
F use of the week and I can't hear you but you go that mic thing I have to have

999
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:39,040
an outlet somehow. Alright, here we go.

1000
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:56,780
My first F.U. goes towards the great amount of roadkill I saw on Madison. Lots and lots

1001
01:24:56,780 --> 01:25:03,780
and lots of roadkill. Seriously, I like passed by like, at least six dead squirrels. One

1002
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:08,880
of them looked like missing a head, it was gross. And then there was this big pile of

1003
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:15,880
blood and gore. I'm so glad the chatroom could not hear what you just said. I remember one

1004
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:25,720
time though, coming up here, I uh, I couldn't, by the way to Cutress, I can't read private

1005
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:31,640
I can't read private messages since I'm on the main cabinet, so I'm not at home.

1006
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,040
So, don't send me any private messages, please.

1007
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,040
Sorry.

1008
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,520
If you want to send me a message to get it later, just send me on Dr. Sakura SSF, but

1009
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:41,520
I'll read it when I get home.

1010
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:49,960
Anyway, a big SU to sinuses and allergies for totally just screwing with my head today.

1011
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,440
I'm on so much medication that it's not even funny.

1012
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:59,100
like my poor cat she's like mama love me and she gets in my lap and I'm like get

1013
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:04,180
out of my lap you're shedding in my nose. So I had to push her off and then a big

1014
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:08,620
epi to people who tailgate me when like people are going 15 miles under the

1015
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:12,660
speed limit in front of me and there's nobody in front of them and like I

1016
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:17,620
couldn't change lanes because I was like a block away from here it would have

1017
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:21,820
been pointless to change us and then like the guy suddenly turns I'm like you ass so I

1018
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:29,500
I was just completely pissed off and also and this is not like a true f you because I adore my fiance

1019
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:33,900
but when I don't want to be touched stop trying to hold my hand I

1020
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:41,860
Would I say and go if I'm here messing and I don't want you to hold my hand or be lovey. Don't do it

1021
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:46,020
Get get my clue. Don't do it. Give woman space, please

1022
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,060
and

1023
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:56,060
And then, I don't know, I sort of lost my thunder there for a little bit, so...

1024
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,060
I'm sorry.

1025
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,060
That's really got on my nerves, I'm sitting here, I'm trying to drink my Pepsi at breakfast,

1026
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:08,060
and like, I'm so tired and aggravated and everything, and Dan's like,

1027
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,060
I want to hold your hand.

1028
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:17,060
And also, F-you to people who called during the show, don't call the home line during the show.

1029
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,060
Unless you don't know the show exists, then you're forgiven.

1030
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,060
Okay, I guess that was a good one.

1031
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,060
Alright.

1032
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:35,060
Also, um, F you to having to install more crap on my computer when my computer space is supposed to be taken up by Stargate episodes.

1033
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,060
Okay, so bye.

1034
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,060

1060
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,380
i'd rather drink rancid water before a diet crap

1061
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:55,440

1062
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,060

1068
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,860
yeah that's why I was hold on a minute are we all stuck here right now you

1069
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:17,080
guys can't leave the big rig is across the entire road going eastbound or

1070
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,960
whatever direction that is no cars are moving everybody's turn around going

1071
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:28,840
back to Granite Bay so everybody Jamie Jamie wants the digit cam to go take

1072
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,940
pictures we're gonna go to a quick break while we figure out what the hell is

1073
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:37,820
going on in the F use to be continued in just a little bit guys sorry for the

1074
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,700
delay, but there's a little bit of chaos.

1075
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,540
Again, we are all stuck here at Orange Lawn's radio.

1076
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:45,700
We are not allowed to leave because there is a jackknife

1077
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:46,380
truck outside.

1078
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,380
We'll be back.

1079
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:29,740
Alright, we are back and if you missed what the hell's going on, basically there's been

1080
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:36,460
a giant accident on a main, we live on a very major artery that connects two towns together

1081
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:40,220
and there's been a truck that looks like it was carrying new vehicles or something on

1082
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:46,760
it that kind of is jackknife its way across the whole road. So, no cars can cross this

1083
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:50,600
road right now, which means that for a lot of the folks here at the studio, if they have

1084
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,980
rides coming in or something, they're not going to be able to get here unless they know

1085
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:57,580
to come a big back way around. So, it's going to be very interesting. So, sorry about that

1086
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:02,820
guys but that was very interesting because we thought for a moment we were stuck here

1087
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:05,660
if there was a big fire, but it doesn't look like it's flaming or there's a fire going

1088
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:14,660
But Jamie did run out there with my camera, and uh, Loki's out there too. We are gonna continue the show, uh, and doing the FUs of the week.

1089
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:21,660
So, yeah, so we still got Seagurd here in Rise Princess because you guys already saw the accident. Did you hear it?

1090
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:29,660
Well, I didn't hear it. No, I didn't even hear it. I was inside when it happened. Um, but I went out there, and they told me about it, and I was like,

1091
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:33,740
like well I'm sad for the person who's in the accident but I'm not gonna go

1092
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:38,900
right out and see it weird very weird all right let's move on with the FUs of

1093
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:50,060
the week shall we it was my turn when we left off my FU of the week goes to that

1094
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:55,280
accident going on out there and taking away from the show that was crazy yeah

1095
01:34:55,280 --> 01:35:01,080
was too crowded in here anyway though so that's a good point. Also just a big

1096
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:06,920
f-you to me falling asleep while driving yesterday. Not really though.

1097
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:14,480
Wait, Jamie's back? Hold on let me get this now that Jamie is interrupting my

1098
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,080
f-yous that's all right all right Jamie what were you saying? That was the most

1099
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:22,480
goddamn boring accent I've ever saw and it's some stupid car driver's fault. They

1100
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,700
I ran into the truck.

1101
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:30,200
Okay, now I don't... now normally, okay, you might say, okay, I don't understand how you didn't see that car.

1102
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,820
Or, I don't understand how you didn't see that truck.

1103
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:34,920
How about I don't know how you didn't see that truck

1104
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,580
carrying a bunch of boats?

1105
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,080
I mean, this thing is like a gigantic...

1106
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,800
Yeah, okay, this thing is carrying about...

1107
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,120
It's about tw... imagine a like

1108
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:50,040
twelve foot tall wall that spans about thirty feet long. How do you miss that?

1109
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,060
While driving down the road.

1110
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:57,060
I didn't think it was funny that for once, this show wasn't the only wreck.

1111
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,060
Shut up.

1112
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:02,060
FU to Brad for that comment, you're a fucktard.

1113
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,060
Alright.

1114
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:08,060
Let's go on and hear from other folks in our studio, their FUs of the Week.

1115
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,060
Starting with Lanky Stiles, since he has a microphone.

1116
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:17,060
The FU goes to the proprietors of the house I'm living in, because now I have to go find a job very quickly and a new apartment.

1117
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,060
Yay!

1118
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:29,060
And I know it's very unlikely they could be listening to this show, but it's also possible they could be. I don't fucking care what you think. So, there you go.

1119
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:34,060
Alright, very interesting. Okay, Jonas, do you have any FUs you want to give out?

1120
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:44,060
Okay, everyone probably said about the F.U., about the car wreck.

1121
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:47,060
God, drivers, drive safely.

1122
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:51,060
I don't have to keep mentioning this so many times.

1123
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:54,060
No fucking color on that.

1124
01:36:54,060 --> 01:37:01,060
Okay, F.U. to the server that I'm hosting my sims and my database on, it keeps shutting down, dammit.

1125
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:08,060
And, and people quit hacking on it and quit hitting too much bandwidth, sorry, killing my bandwidth.

1126
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:11,060
You know this is free for me, so...

1127
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:18,060
Okay, and F you to my current manager right now for not giving me a damn raise.

1128
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:26,060
Okay, I'm doing stuff that people would get paid, like, a shitload, and I'm just here getting minimum wage for now.

1129
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:31,260
And for the love of God, I'm helping you at the arcade try to get better a little bit,

1130
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:33,780
bring more business towards it.

1131
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:39,660
Another F goes to my former manager for getting two people to quit the job that I'm working

1132
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:40,660
at.

1133
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:41,660
Thanks a lot.

1134
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:47,980
You're accusing people of stuff that they didn't even do.

1135
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:54,240
You jumped into conclusions immediately saying, oh, you caused a complaint.

1136
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,340
you should not do this again

1137
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,480
i guess what you just

1138
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,660
they left

1139
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:00,800
thanks a lot

1140
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,320
okay and another f he goes to one of our

1141
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,520
former co-workers who quit

1142
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,960
immediately after some big incident that just occurred

1143
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,000
thanks a lot

1144
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,360
the little kid who's twelve years old

1145
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:16,020
can no longer move, he is paralyzed

1146
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:17,920
cause you didn't watch his ass

1147
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,820
on the rock climbing

1148
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:24,540
It's funny that kids don't know what the hell to do.

1149
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,820
Now it's gonna cost them, now we're gonna get sued.

1150
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:31,600
And if it goes out of business, where the hell are people gonna play DDR now?

1151
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,920
Just think about it. RVL's dead,

1152
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,680
Scandia's dead, Paradox On is the only place that people actually play DDR.

1153
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,600
FU to Paradise Island because I tried to go there today to check it out and the state fair is going on.

1154
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:47,520
Another FU there for the cars being so fucking expensive, the parking.

1155
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,600
Six bucks and stuff.

1156
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,800
Or seven.

1157
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:58,120
Well, CCL is somewhat okay, but I don't like the car system.

1158
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,320
Anyway, sorry to interrupt, anyway.

1159
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,280
Anything else?

1160
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,960
Uh...

1161
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:08,100
F-U for time going fast. I thought that vacation was still like one month.

1162
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:10,840
I'm now realizing that school is about to start soon.

1163
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,880
Starting tomorrow.

1164
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,080
I actually started school last week, sorry.

1165
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,720
But still, time goes too fast.

1166
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,680
I don't have any other chance.

1167
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:23,160
I've not got time for any vacation.

1168
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,320
Uh...

1169
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,720
F you for birds...

1170
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:30,240
More birds shitting in my car.

1171
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:33,040
Every time I clean my car, you all shit on it.

1172
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:33,840
I should just...

1173
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:40,080
Get a gun, shoot the fuck out of all those birds.

1174
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,200
Alright, anything else?

1175
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:45,360
we have a lot of all i have to be continued angel

1176
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,880
all right uh...

1177
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:52,080
away from the good like that

1178
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,120
uh... at you too

1179
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:55,280
the accident

1180
01:39:55,280 --> 01:40:01,280
when we get home now

1181
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,000
uh...

1182
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,800
and useful turning but if you can

1183
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:13,800
maybe I can graduate and what was I going to say? I forgot what it was. Oh well. I forgot

1184
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:17,800
what my F.U. was. Dammit. The really good ones that I needed to sit in the wall.

1185
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,800
There was no people? Ah, what the hell.

1186
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:28,800
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom F.U. is going to keep going here because I want to get another chance to guess for the clue because the accent kind of screwed us up and we're a little bit behind.

1187
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,800
So let's get to chatroom F.U. is here. I'm going to pick some good ones here.

1188
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,860
Esko says f you to the stupidest group of music fans on the earth

1189
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:41,580
See now that I work at a rock and roll merchandise place to see a whole variety of music fans from the stock stanky

1190
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:45,540
Slackers to the frat kids who all buy five feet tall Bob Marley posters

1191
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,180
But only a few really get on my nerves

1192
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:52,840
One has the exceptional ability to be racially offensive and moronic all the same time that is of course the juggalos

1193
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:59,740
ICP fans if you didn't know we recently had a guy called anybody killer who is apparently a member of their running crew to assigning in

1194
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:03,900
mall. It was like a wave of stupidity engulfed the entire mall, rich teen speaking ghetto

1195
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:07,460
and putting face paint on, attempting to blend into a culture that was originally inspired

1196
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:15,100
by the sins of their parents' greed. And they steal our shit and they're annoying, um, I

1197
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:20,340
don't even know what he's trying to say with that last bit there. Uh, moving on. John Fields

1198
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:24,380
says, F you to not having a job. F you to Divix for their weird new compression that's

1199
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:29,260
worthless. Videos that used to be 100 megs total are ending up as a gig on 5.2. Where's

1200
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:34,260
Here's my downgrade. F you again to Microsoft for releasing XP2. It sucks.

1201
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:37,260
Moving on.

1202
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:46,260
Karma Titan says, uh...

1203
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:54,260
F you to Carmel Mountain Nickel City Arcade, riving off Konami's DDR machines by using StepMania and charging people on StepMania.

1204
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:58,260
So what? It's fucking better than DDR. Get a look.

1205
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:06,560
I mean, unless they're putting shitty-ass step files in there, which I can understand that, but, you know, the step menu itself is just another fucking game.

1206
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:11,560
Just get used to it, man. At least it's not some Korean knockoff or something like that.

1207
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:16,560
At least you don't have no fucking Technomotion shit in there. Or like, you know, I can boogie.

1208
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,360
Alright, now moving on. Moo says,

1209
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:26,680
an F.U. of your own for Comcast? How could I forget? Thank you, Moo. I agree. A big F.U.

1210
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:33,780
to Comcast. Alright. Unknown Gamer says, a big ol' fuck you to people who don't pay me

1211
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:40,280
my goddamn money back. Pay me back, Mom, or it's your ass. See, I liked that one. That

1212
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:44,620
was a funny one. Alright, MJB says, my F.U. of the week goes to my friends for taking

1213
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:51,520
my PC and making me go on a Mac. Oh boo hoo. Cutress says, F you Orange Lounge for pwning

1214
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,740
me twice on my first listen on Orange Lounge Radio. Please make sure you hat trick me.

1215
01:42:55,740 --> 01:43:02,040
I want one more pwnage before the end of the night. We still love you. No, pwn him. I hate

1216
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:08,840
the fact that I'm saying pwn, but he did say PWM. I'll wait until I get to Mobile. Yeah,

1217
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:13,040
we still have an hour left. Alright. You'll have to come hang out with me at the Aladdin

1218
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:22,040
He also says F.U. to double amputees who can dance better than me.

1219
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:28,040
Misty says an F.U. to myself for hurting myself while playing DDR today, but I did end up getting quite a few new double A's.

1220
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:31,040
Better yet, F.U. to school.

1221
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:36,040
And Panda says F.U. to losing the bid on eBay for about three gigs of RAM.

1222
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,040
That's a lot.

1223
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:42,040
And, uh, that's it for the FUs of the Week.

1224
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:46,040
Oh, Angel remembered her last one. Yes.

1225
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:50,040
FU to dial up, because, um, we still have it.

1226
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:54,040
And I need to get rid of that soon, so I'm gonna fix it this week. Maybe I can get high speed. Yay.

1227
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:58,040
There we go.

1228
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:02,040
Alright, that's it for the FUs of the Week.

1229
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:06,040
Alright, um, now what we're gonna do,

1230
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:10,020
I want to talk about karaoke revolution those big announcements that came out this week however

1231
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:16,720
We're opening it up. Send me a private message if you have a song guess we've given you three clues now

1232
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,820
If you have a guess as to what the new ultra mix 2 song is

1233
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:24,720
Send it in over private message, and if you're the first one to get it right you get to announce it to everybody

1234
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:31,000
So here's your chance all right meanwhile. I want to talk about this news story that came up this week and

1235
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,820
And actually, just very recently, it was posted over on our website,

1236
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:42,460
orangelaunchradio.com, by our always really good news updater, Dark Tetsuya.

01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:43,460
He says that I get...

1238
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:44,460
What?

1239
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:53,100
You know what, I had to cut and trim some of the FUs tonight, so sorry.

1240
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:57,580
Plus, some folks got them in late, so sorry.

01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:37,180
shenanigans. Alright. Does that mean that the Bimani police are going to come out and beat ROC with a broom?

1266
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:50,380
What do you think about this Karaoke Revolution Volume 3? The franchise expanding some more, it sounds like. What do you guys think about this?

1267
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:54,740
I want my Xbox version.

1268
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:57,980
I could really sort of care less about the PS2.

1269
01:47:57,980 --> 01:48:02,700
I mean, not that I could care less about it, but now that there's gonna be an Xbox one,

1270
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:10,860
I would rather have it on Xbox than PS2, because PS2 games are overall more of a disappointment

1271
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:17,320
than the same game on the Xbox.

1272
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:19,660
I love my Xbox.

1273
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:22,700
My addict box.

1274
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:25,540
I newly acquired Thug today.

1275
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:27,500
I can't wait to play it.

1276
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:30,780
Doug. Tony Hawk Underground. Oh! Cool.

1277
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:34,060
I had that. Yeah, I'm renting it and I'm gonna copy it.

1278
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:37,940
Cause I'm a copier. I have mine now.

1279
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:41,700
My uh, HD loader. HD loader fucking rocks.

1280
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:44,900
We have the ESPN football game on it, Jen's been playing that.

1281
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:48,900
Yeah. See, Driver 3's awesome, cause you know,

1282
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:52,100
it's, I paid five bucks. If you want crap. Five bucks to get it

1283
01:48:52,100 --> 01:49:00,700
that's all that was worth all right let's see no Z no Z let's can we get

1284
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:12,940
Seager back in here for the latest clue round up here what's going on all right

1285
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:19,180
hi everybody we're gonna go through the clues okay yeah yeah all right here we

1286
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:25,180
Here we go. Here we go. Let's see. We had KarmaTitan submit a guess for Armageddon.

1287
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:27,180
No.

1288
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:33,180
No. Then we had Whiterob say secret tale from 2DX7 style because of the tattle tales thing.

1289
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,180
And the fact that each curtain behind Let's Make a Deal had a secret behind it.

1290
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:38,180
That's good reasoning, but no.

1291
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,180
That's a very good reasoning.

1292
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:41,180
I'm really shocked with that reasoning. That was great.

1293
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:46,180
Kabut says my guess on the clues is Paranoia Survivor Max because the sound clip played was really fast like the song

1294
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:51,180
and the quote talking about tattling, so that might mean paranoia and the curtain thing surprising.

1295
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:52,180
No.

1296
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:53,180
No.

1297
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:54,660
All right.

1298
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:58,180
And then we had MJS I24 say, it's a song called Last Romance.

1299
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:03,180
I typed in, let's make a deal and awesome into Google and that was the first bit.

1300
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:04,180
No.

1301
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:06,220
All right.

1302
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:07,220
I like that one.

1303
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:08,460
I'm going to suggest that, man.

1304
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,580
And then.

1305
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,580
Just for the reasoning.

1306
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:12,380
Somebody submitted the correct answer.

1307
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:13,380
Oh my goodness.

1308
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:18,300
about to call them right here on the air and they're going to announce what the

1309
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:20,420
song is to everybody so I'm hoping they're picking up because they actually

1310
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:23,180
have Skype on their system. I seriously can't believe that. So we're gonna see if

1311
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:27,020
we can get it here. I'm hoping he can pick up otherwise he's gonna do the

1312
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:35,020
chatroom thing. Let's see. I'm hoping it's going through. We're trying to get

1313
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:48,140
through there is ringing hello is this jazz hello jazz hey how are you pretty

1314
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:52,900
good good hey guess what you got the song what's up all right all right but I

1315
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:57,780
have to say two other people got it as well but you know you got it first you

1316
01:50:57,780 --> 01:51:03,180
who are the runner-ups all right quick tell us what it is it's called tittle

1317
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:08,540
by Zonk. That is correct. The new song is Tittle Tattle by Zonk. And what was the

1318
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:14,700
reasoning behind that? Because I looked it up on Google and I found that the

1319
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:19,220
losing things in Let's Make a Deal are called Zonks. Yep, that's correct. I looked up

1320
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:23,000
their website and I found that it has the song called Tittle Tattle. So I just

1321
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,140
put two, two, and together. Oh, so he just gets the song. I want to point out though

1322
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:32,300
that Apollo Chan was one of the other people that got it right. They said the

1323
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:35,600
sound file was tittle they correct yes that that little sound file that we

1324
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:40,280
played was tittle on that website and then the tattle bit and a zonk so Apollo

1325
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:43,760
Chan had that right as well and then nigma also had it right saying one

1326
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:47,880
tattle then to the tapping in the song in the name of the band so Apollo Chan

1327
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:51,620
had the 100% correct reasoning why what we were doing but jazz you still got it

1328
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:58,040
first congratulations all right how do you feel how do you feel I want to go

1329
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:01,040
Good job. You're the smart kid tonight.

1330
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,040
Yay.

1331
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:05,040
Hey, did you beat Doom 3?

1332
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:09,040
No, I'm waiting for someone to come over because I'm scared.

1333
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:14,040
Alright, thanks for calling us, Jazz, and congratulations to you.

1334
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,040
Thank you.

1335
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,040
Alright, have a good one.

1336
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:20,040
See, that was cool. I like the Skype thing. That was great.

1337
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:23,040
Alright, here it is, guys. We're going to play the song for you.

1338
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,040
Again, as announced by The Clues.

1339
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:30,600
This was Tiddle, was the name of the sound file, and of course there was the

1340
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,760
Mama don't like tattle-dads. The Tails.

1341
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,680
And then the Let's Make a Deal was a Zonk when you lost.

1342
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:41,280
So the song is Tiddle Tattle and the

1343
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:45,720
artist is Zonk. And we're gonna play it for you right now. And I gotta say,

1344
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:50,000
this is a very interesting song. It is not a typical kind of

1345
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,280
thing I would think about when I think about DDR.

1346
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,360
So

1347
01:52:56,360 --> 01:53:00,200
here it is. I'm queuing it up here. The artist is

1348
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,340
Zonk and the song is called Tittle Tattle.

1349
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:05,340
Enjoy!

1350
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:36,340
Not even a burden

1351
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:59,340
Shea, shoon and humdrum

1352
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:02,340
Tome, poem, dream

1353
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:07,260
Alpha perfection, so very hard to reach

1354
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:12,860
Harmony machine, tormenting the sensory

1355
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:18,020
Deliciously evolved, and yet nobody knows

1356
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:22,980
Analyzing, hallucinations, window licking the imagination

1357
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:25,980
Singing, singing, shadows missing

1358
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:28,980
Can't you sing in a symphony?

1359
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:40,980
Diddle daddle, chicka chicka

1360
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:43,980
Shoots in the breeze

1361
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:46,980
Puddles, clucks, cadence, sludders

1362
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:49,980
There's a synchronous symphony

1363
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:51,980
Diddle daddle, chicka chicka

1364
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:54,220
Shoots in the breeze

1365
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:57,180
Pettis, claque, cadence, lettuce

1366
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:59,660
This is a synchronous symphony

1367
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:25,660
Play from the familiar, conjure a search of jive

1368
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:30,660
Fidget in her mind, enjoy cats with no regrets

1369
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:35,660
Analyzing, hallucinations, window licking the imagination

1370
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:41,660
Big as vision, shadows dancing, dancing synchronous symphonies

1371
01:55:41,660 --> 01:56:00,820
Tickle, saddle, cheeky, shat, shoots in debris Pat-a-clack, cadence, flutter, tears of synchronous

1372
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:07,220
symphony Tickle, saddle, chain, shat, shoots in debris

1373
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:09,240
Pat-a-clack, Cadence.

1374
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:13,140
Ladder, is a synchronous symphony.

1375
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:15,420
Diddle, daddle, chate and chat.

1376
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:18,240
Shoot and de everyday.

1377
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:20,040
Diddle, clack, cadence.

1378
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:23,500
Ladder, is a synchronous symphony.

1379
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,940
Diddle, daddle, chate and chat.

1380
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:27,820
Shoot and de everyday.

1381
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:30,800
Pat-a-clack, cadence.

1382
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,800
It's a synchronous symphony

1383
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,320
earlier, that was Zonk with Tittle Tattle. What did you guys think of that? It was the

1384
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,440
first listen for all of us here. What did you think?

1385
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:10,640
I liked that song. That song was cool. It was swingy.

1386
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:14,360
That was unlike a lot of other DDR songs. I mean, you could say it's kind of like an

1387
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:18,240
athletic song, but that's really stretching it. Really, really stretching it. I think

1388
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:21,400
it's very original. I think it's a great ad for DDR.

1389
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:24,720
Lanky style. Interesting. Yeah.

1390
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:29,240
Just interesting? It just, the music production on it is just

1391
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:33,100
strange, which is good because that's kind of the way, you know, Konami originals are

1392
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:38,720
strange. Now, um, I'm sorry, I just want to add, this is not

1393
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:42,900
a long version. We just happen to only have the full cut of the song, not the

1394
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:46,740
edit. So long versions are not coming back to Ultramix 2, as far as we know.

1395
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:51,960
Um, let me put that in, in better words, they're not coming back at all.

1396
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:56,240
Alright. So if you're pining for a long version, go play Fifth Mix.

1397
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:58,540
Alright. Well, thank you for clearing that up.

1398
01:57:58,540 --> 01:58:02,220
I didn't know if you could say one way or the other, but okay, there you have it.

1399
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:06,260
Also, people that listen to that song, if you think it's kind of odd sounding and

1400
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:09,460
doesn't really fit DDR or something, Ultramix 2

1401
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:13,660
has a completely new direction than what you'd see on the PS2 releases.

1402
01:58:13,660 --> 01:58:20,100
So, yeah, it's awesome. The genres we have are really great.

1403
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:24,580
Alright, that was cool. I'm glad you decided to share that one with us.

1404
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:27,300
Yeah, I was mulling over in my head which one to do, and I was like,

1405
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,300
That's a pretty good song.

1406
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:02,340
staying in. I don't know. That's what somebody asked me. He doesn't even know what the hell

1407
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:10,340
that it means. Yeah, I have no clue what you're talking about, but for the most part, the

1408
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:15,180
long version of the song is, if you could just like cut it in half, you keep all the

1409
01:59:15,180 --> 01:59:21,380
music styles in it and all the singing, that's what you've got. Think of it as a long version

1410
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:24,820
or doubled over from what you just heard. Alright, I'm going to be brave and open up

1411
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:30,820
the skype line for feedback on that song or UltraMix 2 in general. So you can give us

1412
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:34,320
a call on the skype line if you don't know how to call us on the skype line. Head on

1413
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:38,660
over to www.orangeloungeradio.org and click on interact with us. It's a brand new section

1414
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:45,260
on our website. Thank you Jason. And it talks about how you could call the show if you want.

1415
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:50,100
So please do give us a call on the skype line if you have a comment on the song or you know

1416
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:55,180
UltraMix 2 in general. And after we field a couple calls, we're going to do Ask Orange

1417
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:59,260
Lounge in a little bit. Because we haven't done that for a few weeks now, so we definitely

1418
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:04,420
want to let you guys ask a question of any host here, or certainly Siegert. However,

1419
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:08,680
there will be a rule to tonight's Ask Orange Lounge. You may not ask Siegert anything about

1420
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:14,340
UltraMix 2 or DDR Extreme. You can ask him about his sex life, you can ask him about

1421
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:19,140
his living, but you cannot ask him anything about UltraMix 2 or Extreme. That's the rule

1422
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:24,140
If you do, don't expect any more hints on the DDR preboards.

1423
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:26,140
Exactly. No more hints. That's it.

1424
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:29,140
You might ask, hey, is it a good game? And I'll probably say yes.

1425
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:33,140
But I'm not going to tell you, you know, oh, this song isn't it and this song isn't.

1426
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:36,140
You know, you can probably use controllers with it and stuff like that.

1427
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:39,140
But, yeah, that's all you're getting.

1428
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:44,140
Then their DDR will feature arrows!

1429
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:48,140
We're not getting any calls so I guess nobody has any feedback on that.

1430
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:54,240
back on that. The Skype thing is still new also as well. A couple weeks back I

1431
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:59,700
was on here and I said that you know the new song or one of the new songs has up

1432
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:06,340
arrows. Do you know how like bad that sent the DDR Extreme US forum into like

1433
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:10,460
crazy shambles? They thought like oh it has up arrows let's look for songs that

1434
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:16,300
have up arrows and it was the funniest thing ever. I should say those ones with

1435
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:21,040
left arrows this time. See what happens. Okay, nobody's calling on the Skype line, so I guess

1436
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:25,000
we'll close it and we'll open it back up later during Ask Orange Lounge. However, again,

1437
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,620
you can ask him about Ultra- you cannot ask him about Ultra Mix 2 or Extreme. If you do,

1438
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:33,920
one of us will answer the question, who knows nothing about the game? And the reason for

1439
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:40,920
that is the three-letter word called the NDA, which means he can't talk about things that

1440
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:46,760
have not been announced yet. Alright. ABC. That's why. That's why you can ask him personal

1441
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:50,260
questions, but you can't ask him about these stuff. But you know what? Why's it gotta be

1442
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:53,200
all about Seagrid all the time? Of course, granted, I know you're gonna be really busy

1443
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:56,120
the next few months, so you're not gonna be able to come back to the show for a while.

1444
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:59,680
I really appreciate you hanging out here, though. Oh, no problem. Not only this week,

1445
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:03,120
but a couple weeks ago. Maybe you'll come back after the games are released and give

1446
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:07,640
us some more information. Yeah, I could probably do that. Definitely. So, thank you, certainly.

1447
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:09,640
I know you're going to be busy in the next couple of months, so...

1448
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:12,640
Alright, let's do a break.

1449
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:16,640
And then we'll come back and we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge since Skype people didn't want to come.

1450
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:17,640
I see how it is.

1451
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:18,640
What do you guys want to hear this break?

1452
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:19,640
Secret, what do you want to hear this break?

1453
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:20,640
I'll let you pick a song.

1454
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:21,640
Um...

1455
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:23,640
If I have it available, I hope.

1456
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:24,640
Uh, let's...

1457
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,640
Do you have any athletic songs?

1458
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:27,640
Do I have any athletic songs?

1459
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,640
Of course I do.

1460
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:30,640
How about War Game from 8 style?

1461
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:31,640
Yeah, Hit and Slap.

1462
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:32,640
I want to hear Hit and Slap.

1463
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:33,640
I don't know if I have Hit and Slap available.

1464
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:34,640
Uh, Fire Dub?

1465
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:35,640
I'll try and find it.

1466
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:39,760
Firedub, I think I have Firedub. I will try and find Firedub

1467
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:43,960
for you. Alright, Disco Dog, because Jamie wants to hear it, which is also athletics.

1468
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:47,440
So we'll just make it an athletics break. Yay! Alright, we'll be back

1469
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:51,480
with some Ask Orange Lounge. Start submitting your questions now.

1470
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:58,480
we'll be back

1471
02:04:51,480 --> 02:05:01,960
Okay, the only way I have this song is with the new music thing over it, because we added

1472
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:05,240
it back when it was still new, but just ignore the new music part.

1473
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:06,240
It's new!

1474
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:08,320
On Orange Lounge Radio.

1475
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:12,120
This song's in the newest downloadable pack for DDR UltraMix.

1476
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:14,120
This is Athletics with Firedub.

1477
02:05:42,120 --> 02:06:10,120
I don't want no ice cream, no love, girl, can't You don't want no ice cream, no love, girl, can't

1478
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:20,120
Not doing it, not doing it

1479
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:56,120
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Big Money Music and More show?

1480
02:07:56,120 --> 02:08:10,120
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place. It's unearthly. It's like being in a club except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

1481
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:16,160
We are back with Orange Lounge Radio, and what we're going to do now is we're going

1482
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:20,440
to get into the Ask Orange Lounge section of the show.

1483
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:24,940
It's been like three weeks since we've done this, so I know you guys probably have a lot

1484
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:28,880
of good questions to ask tonight, and we will open up Skype even for the questions, or feedback

1485
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:34,220
in general on the show, because we're winding down if anybody wants to use Skype.

1486
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:35,220
I think some people do.

1487
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:38,020
We got added by a couple people during the break there, so I think some people are learning

1488
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:45,020
how to use it. So that's cool. Okay, here we go guys with Ask Orange Lounge. Let's ask

1489
02:08:53,400 --> 02:09:00,240
Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1490
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:04,600
But I think this week will be interesting. Do you want to know why? Because whenever

1491
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:10,600
Where secret comes, the rest of us, don't get any attention.

1492
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:13,720
Alright.

1493
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:18,680
I remember when you were on this show a year ago, and you were just, and nobody cared.

1494
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:20,760
It's because I didn't have insider information.

1495
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,400
Yeah, you didn't work for Konami.

1496
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:26,640
You weren't, uh, I remember you were here for our Max 2 premiere, shall we?

1497
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:27,640
Yeah, I was there for that.

1498
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:29,760
We were first playing Max 2, and who would have thought that you would have gotten to

1499
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:30,960
see the next one before everyone else?

1500
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,520
It's probably because I like Forever Sunshine so much.

1501
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:36,520
Alright, let's get to the questions, shall we?

1502
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:39,520
Uh, starting off with a question from...

1503
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:42,520
Uh, let's see, oop, we got that one. Uh, I know John Fields had a question.

1504
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,520
Oh yeah, I'm sure you're going to want to answer this, Seagurd.

1505
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:46,520
Question to you.

1506
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:49,520
How much money do you make at Konami per year?

1507
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:53,520
Yeah, I make a dollar per year.

1508
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:57,520
I know, yeah, we...

1509
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:00,520
Well, you know, maybe somebody's interested in getting into the profession,

1510
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:04,020
but I believe there are contracts that you sign that say you can't disclose what you make, right?

1511
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:06,520
Yeah, well, I think that's the same way with every job, pretty much.

1512
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:09,520
Unless you're, like, trying to get somebody hired on, then you offer them, you know,

1513
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:12,520
this is how much you'll make in a year or this is how much you'll make in an hour or whatever,

1514
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:17,520
but it's, like, either an unwritten rule or a written rule that you don't discuss, you know,

1515
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:21,520
your earnings at work or of your work.

1516
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:24,520
So just keep imagining he's filthy, stinky, rich.

1517
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:28,520
Yeah, I'm rich with pornos.

1518
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,840
MJSI24, I have no idea a quick way to pronounce that name.

1519
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:38,120
How long has Seager been working at Konami, and how did he get his job?

1520
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:39,840
Hoping this does not violate the NDA.

1521
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,000
So whatever you can say that doesn't violate the NDA, although I believe you addressed

1522
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,800
this two weeks ago when you were here.

1523
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:45,800
Did I?

1524
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:46,800
What did I say?

1525
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,960
I think you said it's a job they were hiring.

1526
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,200
Yeah, it's a job they were hiring.

1527
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:55,840
They advertise on their website, I've been working there for a little while, I won't

1528
02:10:55,840 --> 02:11:02,560
exactly how long, because there's no point to, but yeah. Just look on their website.

1529
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:05,560
They always have, you know, well they don't always have openings, but if they have an

1530
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:08,440
opening they will post it, and just check it out there.

1531
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:12,060
Alright, I open up the Skype line if anybody wants to contact us there. Remember, please

1532
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:15,580
do not call when the Do Not Disturb light is on, because that means we're either on

1533
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:18,760
another call or we're doing something else during the show and we're not taking your

1534
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:24,760
call, but we do have a couple questions over here.

1535
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:28,600
Karma Titan says, I heard DDR Extreme was the last mix from the DDR series from

1536
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:32,920
DDRmaniacs.net. True or false? Actually, I'll answer this one. I'll go ahead and

1537
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:37,800
answer this question. It is absolutely, don't believe anything that you read on

1538
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:44,360
that site, right? I'm just kidding. No, I, he doesn't, do you want to try this one

1539
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:49,560
Yeah, I can do this one. Um, don't listen to internet rumors or anything like that.

1540
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:54,560
If there is going to be another one, just check Konami's site.

1541
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:59,080
Or Orange Lounge Radio. This is from a site that just announced,

1542
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:03,520
Hey, DDR Festival Mix is coming out. Um, wait a second.

1543
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:04,800
No, no, no. That would be in the DDR2.

1544
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:09,320
Konami's USA, not Japan's USA. Oh yeah, you know, because they're making

1545
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:11,680
money now, so. Oh, stop, stop.

1546
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:13,440
Alright, anyway. What are they, Nickelodeon?

1547
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:16,960
Let me answer the call we just took. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1548
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:21,800
Hi, um... Excuse me.

1549
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:24,320
Yeah, um...

1550
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,660
Are you laughing at me?

1551
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:29,900
Yes, I am. No, I'm just teasing. What's up?

1552
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:31,700
Yeah, why'd you ban me?

1553
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:33,800
Oh, oh...

1554
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:40,180
It's people that can't get over themselves. Oh...

1555
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:43,420
uh... god

1556
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:46,360
uh... i'm gonna make one comment

1557
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:51,580
and one comment only although it might be a little bit at length

1558
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:54,080
you suck

1559
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:59,740
get a real life nobody cares about your little drama so get over it

1560
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:01,540
that has been a public service announcement

1561
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:06,440
i'm sorry wait a minute i'm sorry let me turn around one more time

1562
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,680
you

1563
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:09,560
must be really

1564
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:15,320
bored, have no life, and no friends if you're obsessing over being banned a year and a half

1565
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:16,320
ago.

1566
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:17,320
Get over it!

1567
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:18,320
Go bug somebody else.

1568
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:26,480
Aren't you like a moderator on some unknown crappy Bimani site somewhere?

1569
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:30,520
Actually not quite an unknown site, but yeah.

1570
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:35,420
Okay, if you have to have something to validate yourself, why not try the internet like everybody

1571
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:36,420
else does?

1572
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:39,520
Alright, that's 60 seconds spent too much on that topic.

1573
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:47,400
to move on I'm gonna reopen our newly filtered Skype line and see if anybody

1574
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:52,220

It's alright.

1586
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:48,160
Who is this?

1587
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:49,160
Turn down the Winamp!

1588
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:50,160
Turn it down!

1589
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:51,160
I did not get the phone to be our own show.

1590
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:52,160
Turn off the Winamp and call us back.

1591
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:53,160
Damn.

1592
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:54,160
No.

1593
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,160
Alright.

1594
02:14:55,160 --> 02:15:01,760
Nigma has a question.

1595
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:13,680
I guess this is for Sigurd.

1596
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:17,680
Does Konami read their message boards?

1597
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:22,680
No, of course not. Because, you know, they're not like on DDR Freak or anything.

1598
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:25,680
No.

1599
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:28,680
Really quick. Really quickly.

1600
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:29,680
It turns off everything.

1601
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:32,680
Hold on, caller. We'll get to you in a minute.

1602
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:39,680
Yeah, they read their message boards, obviously, because, like Loki stated, duh.

1603
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:40,680
Pretty much.

1604
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:47,840
All right caller hi welcome to orange ons radio. What's up? Yeah on DDR maniacs. I also heard that

1605
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:52,080
the artist Naoki from the DDR series

1606
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:57,020
Was it I heard that everyone all the artists like

1607
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:02,700
Reven g or Omega and all that are Naoki, so I do have the same

1608
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:12,700
Well, if you'll pick up a copy of DDR Max and read that instruction manual, you can see all of Naoki's handles, and there's about 20 of them, at least.

1609
02:16:12,700 --> 02:16:15,700
Okay?

1610
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:22,700
Okay. I guess that was a nod of acceptance, I don't know. Thanks for the call!

1611
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:24,700
Alright.

1612
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:26,700
He was listening to his radio.

1613
02:16:26,700 --> 02:16:31,700
First rule in radio, never listen to your radio on the phone call.

1614
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:34,700
Well, he said it wouldn't work otherwise. I don't know.

1615
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:35,700
That's stupid.

1616
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:37,700
I don't know. We'll see.

1617
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:41,700
He probably had one of those non-duplex sound cards.

1618
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:43,700
Oh, you know what? That might do it.

1619
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:44,700
I'm an idiot.

1620
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:46,700
That might do it. I don't know.

1621
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:49,700
I don't have one and I can still talk about it twice.

1622
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:50,700
Alright.

1623
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,700
No, I'm talking about Moto.

1624
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:53,700
Nigma had another question I want to get to.

1625
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:57,700
Are any of you or people you know going to the tournament in New York in October?

1626
02:16:57,700 --> 02:17:02,140
Well, seeing as we're on the West Coast, not really likely any of us are flying up there.

1627
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:04,940
Buy us a plane ticket, we will gladly make a cameo.

1628
02:17:04,940 --> 02:17:08,060
Nobody here has any travel plans to New York in October?

1629
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:11,260
I'm going at the end of September, but there's no tournament. I might go to eight on the break, though.

1630
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:14,820
Yeah, I might be going to New York in September to blow up another building.

1631
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:18,020
Stop it! Not funny. Stop it.

1632
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:21,500
It's for my birthday!

1633
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:24,700
Come on! It worked one year.

1634
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:31,700
horrible. Alright.

1635
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:36,580
Very, very not nice. Alright, let's see, uh,

1636
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:40,380
Skyline's open for a few more seconds. Otherwise, um,

1637
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:44,340
does anybody else have a question for somebody else in the room? That's what we

1638
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:46,460
usually do when we have no other questions. We got a couple

1639
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:49,740
minutes left to show here. Does anybody in the room have a question for somebody

1640
02:17:49,740 --> 02:17:50,580
else in the room?

1641
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:56,580
I'm really sad we didn't get to do that last clue, Sigurd. We actually have one more clue we were going to do.

1642
02:17:56,580 --> 02:18:02,580
Do you want to hear- we want to still do it? Okay. Let's do that last clue we were going to do, alright?

1643
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:07,580
This was the last clue you were going to hear if you didn't get it, even though Irene's not paying attention and the clue involves her.

1644
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:14,580
But, uh, Sigurd- oh, Sigurd was actually going to, uh, let me have the fourth clue because he didn't want to say this.

1645
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:19,580
But this was the fourth clue. Irene, I just want to say that you have really nice tits.

1646
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:26,580
It's too bad they're kind of little. In fact, you might call them tittles.

1647
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:32,580
That was the fourth clue. That was so awful.

1648
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:36,580
That was the clue that Sigurd and I came up with earlier.

1649
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:38,580
I got one. Hold on, I got a fifth clue.

1650
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:45,580
Rob, you have a nice dick. Too bad it's a little little. You might call it dickle.

1651
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:50,800
oh god

1652
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:54,280
no I'm just kidding rice princess has huge boobs

1653
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:58,960
don't uh don't believe the rumors alright the rumors what

1654
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:02,680
I haven't started any rumors

1655
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:05,800
uh kabut

1656
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:09,400
that's the name is kabut instead of kaboom it's kabut

1657
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:15,800
I've said the name like twice already in the show because he sent other questions.

1658
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:21,120
Kabut wants to know, how big is your E penis?

1659
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:22,120
Anybody want to answer?

1660
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:23,920
I think Jamie should answer this one.

1661
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:29,760
Dark Sakura, how big is your E penis?

1662
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:32,480
Very large.

1663
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:36,160
How big is your E penis, Dark Sakura?

1664
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:41,680
holding up her hands holding up her hands about about four feet she's hung

1665
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:52,480
like an e-horse all right very lovely nigma has a I like this question

02:19:52,480 --> 02:19:58,000
nigma says does orange lounge have t-shirts not yet but we are definitely

1667
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,240
looking into it we want to sell t-shirts and hopefully make some money so not yet

1668
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:06,480

1670
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:19,720
week my first time on orange launch radio how come the place looks

1671
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:24,480
different didn't we have the big spiderweb on the camera last week that

1672
02:20:24,480 --> 02:20:27,720
might be one thing yeah I'm not sure I think it's just because we have

1673
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:31,560
different people here the lighting might be a little different but we I turn the

1674
02:20:31,560 --> 02:20:33,560
He turned the camera slightly to the left.

1675
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:36,560
Oh, okay. I guess that's it. He turned the camera slightly to the left.

1676
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:39,560
And, uh, there's more crap on the table.

1677
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:42,560
Oh, John Fields has a good question. I'll take this as the last question.

1678
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:44,560
Does Orange House Radio have any-

1679
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:48,560
Oh, and there's Peach Girl posters on the wall, thanks to Nellie.

1680
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:50,560
Oh, maybe that's what it is.

1681
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,560
She hung up the porno posters on the wall.

1682
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:55,560
Maybe that's what it is. I thought something's different.

1683
02:20:55,560 --> 02:21:01,860
Okay, last question from John Fields. Do we have any plans to put old episodes in MP3

1684
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:08,360
on CD for sale at some point in the future? And actually, well at the classic gaming show

1685
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:13,000
there was another radio station that has to do with retro gaming that was selling copies

1686
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,800
of their show on DVD. The only gray area with our show is that we actually play not only

1687
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:23,560
Bahmani music, but thanks to our cage match, which granted wasn't in the first 20 episodes,

1688
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:28,480
has been there for the majority of our show. The Cage Match has other real music, so we

1689
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:33,520
can't really turn around and sell that music. We could go through and edit it all out, but

1690
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:37,480
that would be kind of a pain in the ass. I don't know. So, we'll just kind of have to

1691
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:44,000
see what happens. I don't think we can feasibly do it, but I don't know. As far as distribution

1692
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,160
plans for getting the old episodes out there, we'll have to just see in the future. We'll

1693
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:53,240
see. Alright. Also, Angel is the official historian of Orange Laundry Radio and has

1694
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:57,760
them all on MP3, except I would like to point out that this week I forgot to start archiving

1695
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:03,520
until about 45 minutes into the show, so on Thursday during the new Orange Lawns Radio

1696
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:07,800
Rewind at 6, you're only going to get part of the show, and that's my bad. Sorry.

1697
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:17,800
Bad Rob, bad. No, no one is going to ask me for copies. No, they're mine. I'm not funny.

1698
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:24,280
All right, all right, um, I guess now it's time to kind of wrap up the show you guys that's it

1699
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:30,640
Thank you for asking the questions on a score lounge. It is 930 time to wrap up the show go around and get everybody's

1700
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:34,600
Final thought we're going to start off tonight's final thought from

1701
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:40,320
Hand the microphone to somebody Jimmy. Oh who has the second mic? Oh

1702
02:22:40,320 --> 02:22:42,320
One of them is being held by Ethan.

1703
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:51,320
Say something, somebody.

1704
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:53,320
Final thought.

1705
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:55,320
Final thought.

1706
02:22:56,320 --> 02:22:57,320
I have none.

1707
02:22:57,320 --> 02:23:08,440
Well, lanky style your final thought all right lanky style final thought my neck

1708
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:20,200
my back yeah so pass off to somebody else haven't give us their final thought

1709
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:32,100
all right rice princess your final thought I'm gonna miss secret oh all

1710
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:43,180
right well angel crash and everyone knows what I'm talking about not that

1711
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:51,180
it's a big deal because I think we can all go home now. Yeah, that's it.

1712
02:23:51,180 --> 02:24:01,180
Seegerd, your final thought? I hope my iPod is done charging.

1713
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:05,180
And, Loki, your final thought?

1714
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:11,180
Where's the microphone? Oh, that's my final thought. Where's the microphone?

1715
02:24:11,180 --> 02:24:17,360
And my final thought is tune in to Pump Up The Volume on Tuesday and Diversion on Monday

1716
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:22,320
and Who Knows What on Wednesday and the Orange Mountains Radio Rewind on Thursday and all

1717
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:23,660
the good stuff in between.

1718
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:27,900
The fun just doesn't end here on Orange Mountains Radio Live, that's for sure.

1719
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:29,540
Jamie your final thought?

1720
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:34,900
Tuesday is Pump Up The Volume with the pre-show starting at 7 o'clock, although it didn't

1721
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:36,180
start a little bit earlier.

1722
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:43,780
On that day I will be playing the CD of 8-Bit Warriors and also the U.S. Silent Hill 4 soundtrack

1723
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:45,580
in its entirety.

1724
02:24:45,580 --> 02:24:48,580
So make sure you're listening.

1725
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:49,580
It will be Q.

1726
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:50,740
All right.

1727
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:54,860
The final word of the show, one word to sum up the whole show.

1728
02:24:54,860 --> 02:24:59,460
I guess Rice Princess, we're going to give out Rice Princess because she didn't talk

1729
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:00,620
a whole lot this show.

1730
02:25:00,620 --> 02:25:05,380

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1737
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:46,860
Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American dream, about me, about you, about the way

1738
02:25:46,860 --> 02:25:52,560
our American hearts beat way down in the bottom of our chests, about that special feeling

1739
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:57,300
we get in the cockles of our hearts, maybe below the cockles, maybe in the sub-cockle

1740
02:25:57,300 --> 02:26:04,300
Maybe in the liver, maybe in the kidneys, maybe even in the colon, we don't know.

1741
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:12,300
I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job.

1742
02:26:12,300 --> 02:26:16,300
I'm your average white suburbanite slum.

1743
02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:20,300
I like football and porno and books about war.

1744
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:24,300
I got an average house with a nice hardwood floor.

1745
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:33,300
My wife and my job, my kids in my car, my feet on my table, and a Cuban cigar.

1746
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:41,300
But sometimes that just ain't enough to keep a man like me interested.

1747
02:26:41,300 --> 02:26:42,300
Oh, no.

1748
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:43,300
No way.

1749
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:44,300
Uh-uh.

1750
02:26:44,300 --> 02:26:49,300
No, I've gotta go out and have fun at someone else's expense.

1751
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:50,300
Oh, yeah.

1752
02:26:50,300 --> 02:26:51,300
Yeah, yeah.

1753
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:52,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1754
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:57,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I drive really slow in the ultra-fast lane

1755
02:26:57,300 --> 02:27:01,300
While people behind me are going insane

1756
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:05,300
I'm an echo, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo

1757
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:09,300
I'm an echo, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo

1758
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:14,300
I use public toilets and I piss on the seat

1759
02:27:14,300 --> 02:27:18,300
I walk around in the summertime saying, how about this heat?

1760
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:22,540
I'm an ass-o-yo-yo-yo-yo

1761
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:26,900
I'm an ass-o-y-o-yo-yo-yo

1762
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:30,780
Sometimes I part in handicapped spaces

1763
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:34,720
While handicapped people make handicapped faces

1764
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:39,140
I'm an ass-o-yo-yo-yo-yo

1765
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:43,500
I'm an ass-o-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo

1766
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:47,060
Maybe I should be singing this song

1767
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:51,060
Ranting and raving and carrying on

1768
02:27:51,060 --> 02:27:56,060
Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong

1769
02:27:59,060 --> 02:28:01,060
Nah, I'm a nesso

1770
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:05,060
I'm a nesso

1771
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:08,060
I'm a nesso

1772
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:09,060
You know what I'm gonna do?

1773
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:13,060
I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadillac Eldorado convertible

1774
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:16,060
Hot pink with a whale skin hop champ

1775
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:21,060
And all leather cow interior and big brown baby seal eyes for headlights, yeah!

1776
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:26,060
And I'm gonna drive around in that baby at 115 miles per hour gettin' one mile per gallon

1777
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:31,060
suckin' down porta-potta cheeseburgers from McDonald's and the old-fashioned non-biodegradable styrofoam containers

1778
02:28:31,060 --> 02:28:35,060
And when I'm done suckin' down those greaseball burgers I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag

1779
02:28:35,060 --> 02:28:38,060
And then I'm gonna toss the styrofoam containers right out the side

1780
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:41,060
And there ain't a goddamn thing anybody can do about it, you know why?

1781
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:43,060
Because we got the bomb, that's why

1782
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:46,060
Two words, nuclear fucking weapons, OK?

1783
02:28:46,060 --> 02:28:49,060
Russia, Germany, Romania, they can have all the democracy they want

1784
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:53,060
They can have a big democracy cakewalk right through the middle of the Inovins Square

1785
02:28:53,060 --> 02:28:56,060
And it won't make a lick of difference because we ain't got the bombs, OK?

1786
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:58,060
John Wayne's not dead, he's frozen

1787
02:28:58,060 --> 02:29:01,060
And as soon as we find a cure for cancer we're gonna thaw out that Duke

1788
02:29:01,060 --> 02:29:02,060
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off

1789
02:29:02,060 --> 02:29:04,060
You know why? Have you ever taken a cold shower?

1790
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:06,060
We multiply that by 15 million times

1791
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:08,060
That's how pissed off the Duke's gonna be

1792
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:11,060
I'm gonna get the Duke, and John Cascametti, and Lee Marvin

1793
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:16,060
Hey! Hey! Hey! You know, you really are an asshole.

1794
02:29:16,060 --> 02:29:18,060
Why don't you just shut up and sing the song, pal?

1795
02:29:18,060 --> 02:29:22,060
Come on, S-O-L-E-O-L-E-O-L-E-O

1796
02:29:22,060 --> 02:29:27,060
Come on, S-O-L-E-O-L-E-O

1797
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:31,060
A-S-S-H-O-L-E, everybody

1798
02:29:31,060 --> 02:29:35,060
A-S-S-H-O-L-E

1799
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:56,020
I'm an asshole, and I'm proud of it.

1800
02:29:56,020 --> 02:30:03,020
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

1801
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:54,300
Alright, the

1802
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:59,120
Afterbirth the part of the show when the credits have faded to black and you think it's over

1803
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:04,560
but it's really not. We have to keep it kind of short tonight though because I gotta get

1804
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:10,240
on the road. But I don't know, anybody had anything they wanted to say here in this Afterbirth?

1805
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:19,240
I'm gonna go fold my laundry. Sounds like fun. And then anything else you wanted to

1806
02:31:19,240 --> 02:31:24,640
any anything off the record in the afterbirth the show not really I figured

1807
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:31,560
as much I'm kind of tired we're all exhausted we're spent I guess I could

1808
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:35,200
open up Skype and see if anybody has anything they want to say during this

1809
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,720
afterbirth I hope you guys enjoyed the premiere and all that fun stuff tonight

1810
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:44,600
it's fun getting to do stuff like that I hope we get to do more we'll soon see I

1811
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:47,840
do hear that there is some good stuff coming up for the show but I can't I

1812
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:52,160
I can't talk about it or they might send the mob after me, so that's all I'm going to say

1813
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:53,160
for right now.

1814
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:55,520
Yep, yep.

1815
02:31:55,520 --> 02:32:00,560
I enjoy talking to myself on air, isn't it exciting?

1816
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:06,240
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1817
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:09,440
I don't know what the hell that was.

1818
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:11,560
She has a binder clip!

1819
02:32:11,560 --> 02:32:12,560
Yeah.

1820
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:13,560
No.

1821
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:18,560
No, I'm not singing the man song.

1822
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:23,560
Alright.

1823
02:32:23,560 --> 02:32:25,560
There we go, Jamie's singing it.

1824
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:27,560
Somebody was singing, was Jamie singing it in the back?

1825
02:32:27,560 --> 02:32:29,560
Man, man, man.

1826
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:32,560
No, must be the titties.

1827
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:34,560
That needs to be in Karaoke Revolution.

1828
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:36,560
Oh yeah, that needs to be in Karaoke Revolution.

1829
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:38,560
It's not going to be in Karaoke Revolution.

1830
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:40,560
Along with Murmur Twins.

1831
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:43,960
Alright, that's it. Forget it.

1832
02:32:43,960 --> 02:32:48,160
We're spent.

1833
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:51,280
Oh, I'm gonna give head to one of the Loki's joysticks.

1834
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:56,760
Oh, you should. Alright, for the post-show tonight, you get a

1835
02:32:56,760 --> 02:33:01,000
Bamani potpourri. It's a little bit of everything, commercial-free.

1836
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,080
Enjoy, have a great night, thank you for tuning in,

1837
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:08,440
and we will see you again real soon, we hope.

1838
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:10,440
Good night.

1839
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:41,440
You're a cloud. You're duh-duh-duh.

1840
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:44,440
Oooh, duh-duh-duh-duh.

1841
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:52,440
If you're leaving me now,

1842
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:55,440
then I'm gonna be with you.

1843
02:34:57,440 --> 02:34:58,440
New Music

1844
02:34:58,440 --> 02:34:59,440
It's New!

1845
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:01,440
On Orange Lounge Radio

1846
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:04,440
Orangeloungeradio.com and ddrspot.com

1847
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:10,920
of teaming up to bring you this new song from TDR Extreme USA. This is Your Rain, the Rage

1848
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:29,920
You touched my body once, it burned You still solved me, never forget, never again will be

1849
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:36,920
I cried out of my head

1850
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:42,920
And I don't know what I found

1851
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:52,920
Over and over, I feel it break me down

1852
02:35:52,920 --> 02:36:03,920
I'm waiting for a gentle wave, a gentle wave, a gentle wave

1853
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:08,920
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets just a whisper

1854
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:13,920
Busy people, going nowhere, steaming oak in the rain

1855
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:18,920
No compassion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

1856
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:27,920
Like a flower in the basement, waiting for our love again

1857
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:53,020
You're the time I give, the place I give, my love

1858
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:51,420
We will, we will be young forever We are the ones who make it right

1859
02:38:51,420 --> 02:38:54,860
We are the people of our time

1860
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:59,660
We hold our future in our hands

1861
02:39:01,660 --> 02:39:05,100
We have the love to build a home

1862
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:08,540
Together we can have it all

1863
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:13,580
With every step we're moving on and on

1864
02:39:14,940 --> 02:39:18,220
Standing up for everyone

1865
02:39:18,220 --> 02:39:21,220
And won't you come around?

1866
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:25,220
You will be forever free

1867
02:39:25,220 --> 02:39:28,220
When all is one and all is right

1868
02:39:28,220 --> 02:39:35,220
We will, we will be home forever

1869
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:45,220
We will, we will be home forever

1870
02:39:45,220 --> 02:39:49,220
Yeah, yeah

1871
02:40:15,220 --> 02:40:34,220
Don't shine, I feel your energy, I need sunshine But it's not on me now Don't shine, don't you have to wait I want sunshine, it's just everything

1872
02:40:34,220 --> 02:40:49,220
I need sunshine, I feel your energy I need sunshine, falling down on me now

1873
02:40:49,220 --> 02:40:54,220
Sunshine, don't you hide away I want sunshine, each and every day

1874
02:40:54,220 --> 02:41:00,220
Sunshine, I feel your energy I need sunshine, falling down on me now

1875
02:41:00,220 --> 02:41:08,220
Now sometimes when you hide away I want some time to do it every day

1876
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:35,220
What's going on?

1877
02:41:35,220 --> 02:41:44,220
What's going on?

1878
02:41:44,220 --> 02:41:51,220
Dude I said, hey yeah, hey yeah

1879
02:41:51,220 --> 02:41:59,220
I said hey, what's going on?

1880
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:22,540
25 years old, my life's in steel I'm trying to get up the creepy hill of old

1881
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:24,540
Our destination

1882
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:30,040
I realized we flew and I thought I'd choose

1883
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:34,540
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of men

1884
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:38,540
Or were there other dreams?

1885
02:42:40,540 --> 02:42:42,540
Into a close-up time

1886
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:44,040
But I lied my friend

1887
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:47,540
Just to get it all out was in my head

1888
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:49,540
And I, I'm pretty

1889
02:42:49,540 --> 02:42:52,540
A little peculiar

1890
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:57,540
Into a week in the morning when I step outside

1891
02:42:57,540 --> 02:43:00,540
And I take a difference and I get real high

1892
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:03,540
And I swim to the top of my line

1893
02:43:03,540 --> 02:43:06,540
What's going on?

1894
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:11,540
And I say hey, yeah, yeah

1895
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:14,540
Hey, yeah, yeah

1896
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:16,540
I say hey

1897
02:43:16,540 --> 02:43:20,540
Hey, what's going on?

1898
02:43:21,540 --> 02:43:26,540
I said hey, yeah, yeah

1899
02:43:26,540 --> 02:43:29,540
Hey, yeah, yeah

1900
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:30,540
I say hey!

1901
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:34,280
What's going on?

1902
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:39,620
Come on!

1903
02:43:39,620 --> 02:43:40,120
Nico Meow!

1904
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:40,620

1905

Meow!

1909
02:43:42,620 --> 02:43:43,120
Nico Meow!

1910
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:43,620
Meow!

1911
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:44,120
Meow!

1912
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:44,620
Meow!

1913
02:43:44,620 --> 02:43:45,120
Meow!

1914
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:46,620
Oh, Ash!

1915
02:43:46,620 --> 02:43:49,620
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

1916
02:43:49,620 --> 02:43:51,620
YEAH!

1917
02:44:19,620 --> 02:44:22,620
And bring my wagons around

1918
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:27,620
Move it out to the man in the sky of the trees

1919
02:44:27,620 --> 02:44:33,620
Move it out when nobody wants to beat anyone

1920
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:36,620
And nobody's backing me

1921
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:38,620
I wanna be with the creatures of dreams

1922
02:44:38,620 --> 02:44:41,620
I'll stand by the stars, drop the rain, but I say

1923
02:44:41,620 --> 02:44:46,620
Grab what you can, we'll hand for the wildcat tree

1924
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:18,620
We

1925
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:34,620
So many days we wasted under the sky, watching the sun go up and come back again.

1926
02:47:34,620 --> 02:47:38,620
So many nights we end with a complete start

1927
02:47:41,620 --> 02:47:44,620
Aren't you really a light that she

1928
02:47:44,620 --> 02:47:47,620
Should have in her heart?

1929
02:47:47,620 --> 02:47:50,620
With you, with you, with you

1930
02:47:50,620 --> 02:47:53,620
The universe is on its side

1931
02:47:53,620 --> 02:47:57,620
I wanna be with you, with you, with you

1932
02:47:57,620 --> 02:48:01,620
Wherever you are, with you in my heart

1933
02:48:01,620 --> 02:48:04,620
Why do we speak out loud like this?

1934
02:48:04,620 --> 02:48:08,620
I'd love to share the little more by talking

1935
02:48:08,620 --> 02:48:12,620
How can we keep repeating the same old lies?

1936
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:15,620
You and I make everything feel so new

1937
02:48:15,620 --> 02:48:18,620
Why do we speak out loud like this?

1938
02:48:18,620 --> 02:48:22,620
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

1939
02:48:22,620 --> 02:48:26,620
How do we know we'll be together?

1940
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:29,620
I wanna do it this way next

1941
02:48:31,620 --> 02:48:37,620
But I don't wanna do nothing to you

1942
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:40,620
A little moment

1943
02:48:40,620 --> 02:48:45,620
Make up in the wild

1944
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:57,620
I need you, I want you, I will love to you

1945
02:50:27,620 --> 02:50:31,620
We be the punch to be found, to be found, found, found, found

1946
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:44,120
That's right, Joey Drake joined one

1947
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:47,620
Before there were words, communication was done through feet

1948
02:50:48,620 --> 02:50:50,620
Body language is controlled by rhythm

1949
02:50:51,620 --> 02:50:53,620
Music is a universal link

1950
02:50:53,620 --> 02:50:57,620
Feel this, feel these, uh, uh

1951
02:50:57,620 --> 02:50:59,620
Think of this world without sound

1952
02:50:59,620 --> 02:51:01,620
Can't even feel a heart pound

1953
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:04,620
Wasting time, wasting lives, wasting self

1954
02:51:04,620 --> 02:51:07,620
Show me your health, show me your drum and I'll beat on it

1955
02:51:07,620 --> 02:51:09,620
Work the guitar, I'll trade

1956
02:51:09,620 --> 02:51:11,620
Show me your soul, work, lose control

1957
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:14,620
And the dude that can't be getting through this

1958
02:51:14,620 --> 02:51:16,620
Yeah, that's right, come on

1959
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:19,620
I can't hear you, what, what

1960
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:21,620
I can't feel you, what, come on

1961
02:51:21,620 --> 02:51:23,620
Throw it up!

1962
02:51:23,620 --> 02:51:25,620
Get busy!

1963
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:27,620
Get busy! That's right!

1964
02:51:27,620 --> 02:51:29,620
Here we go, y'all!

1965
02:51:29,620 --> 02:51:31,620
Make music!

1966
02:51:31,620 --> 02:51:33,620
Give me your time and I'll bend it!

1967
02:51:33,620 --> 02:51:35,620
Tell me your name and I'll say it!

1968
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:37,620
Where's the air, I'll blow it!

1969
02:51:37,620 --> 02:51:39,620
The last time would I, that's it!

1970
02:51:39,620 --> 02:51:41,620
Burn some mic, I'll rip it!

1971
02:51:41,620 --> 02:51:43,620
Show me the club, it's on!

1972
02:51:43,620 --> 02:51:45,620
Get me a line, I'll send it!

1973
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:47,620
The last time would I, and I'm back!

1974
02:51:47,620 --> 02:51:49,620
Where are you from? Where are you at?

1975
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:58,280
Just follow the beats, c'mon, just follow the beats, c'mon and bring the heat, yo

1976
02:51:58,280 --> 02:51:59,280
Where you from?

1977
02:51:59,280 --> 02:52:00,280
Where you at?

1978
02:52:00,280 --> 02:52:02,280
Where you goin'?

1979
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:37,280
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1980
02:52:37,280 --> 02:52:39,280
Do you want to be represented by Hollywood?

1981
02:52:39,280 --> 02:52:41,280
No!

1982
02:52:41,280 --> 02:52:43,280
Do we care what people think of us?

1983
02:52:43,280 --> 02:52:45,280
No!

1984
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:47,280
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1985
02:52:47,280 --> 02:52:49,280
Yes!

1986
02:52:49,280 --> 02:52:56,280

Cause when we dance together

1989
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:37,280
You're like a dream come true

1990
02:53:37,280 --> 02:53:40,280
I feel so beautiful

1991
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:42,280
Heart and sight

You'll be mine, baby, don't cry Stay with me and I will try

Feel like a woman, yes, I know You are my destiny

And you feel like it's over All the days and nights in paradise

03:02:03,500 --> 03:02:09,500
I feel like it's over All the days and nights in paradise

2014
03:02:09,500 --> 03:02:13,500
No, no, nobody's love No, nobody's love

From heaven above our eyes

2035
03:07:04,640 --> 03:07:08,640
The beauty of shining bright, bright stars in the sky

2036
03:07:38,640 --> 03:07:40,640
You never beat me, and I'm jumping across the floor

2037
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:42,640
I need you so I can't even play around with me

2038
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:44,640
Just write me down, it's going through the night, baby

Cause you're mine and my whole life

You need your break when your life ain't straight

2042
03:07:57,640 --> 03:07:58,640
You run your liver cause the pain when you're sobbing

2043

Great, you got CDF, I'm gonna pull him over, turn

They have to sing a song

2069
03:10:42,480 --> 03:10:43,480
This is a liar

2070
03:10:43,480 --> 03:10:44,480
A liar

2071
03:10:44,480 --> 03:10:45,480
Burn on fire

2072

And take it back in John

2073
03:10:48,480 --> 03:10:49,480
Kill him for pleasure

Proud of you

2078
03:10:53,480 --> 03:10:54,480
Proud of you

2079
03:10:54,480 --> 03:10:55,480
I'll leave

All day and have more rest

2081
03:10:56,480 --> 03:10:57,480
You do

2082
03:10:57,480 --> 03:10:58,480
I try and do it all my best

2083
03:10:58,480 --> 03:10:59,480
My time

2084
03:10:59,480 --> 03:11:00,480
With my friends

2085
03:11:00,480 --> 03:11:02,480
We must lift our hands

2086
03:11:02,480 --> 03:11:04,480
To win this for you

2087
03:12:04,480 --> 03:12:06,100
Duck up on the twine and

03:31:34,620 --> 03:31:39,620
So I came out strong, he was born to tell his father

2255
03:31:39,620 --> 03:31:43,620

03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:18,140
Where did you come from?

2267
03:32:18,140 --> 03:32:19,020
Where did you go?

2268
03:32:19,020 --> 03:32:21,020
I need you come from Cut-and-I-Doe

2269
03:32:22,020 --> 03:32:23,020
Oh my god!

2270
03:32:23,020 --> 03:32:24,020
You've got mail!

2271
03:32:24,020 --> 03:32:30,020
During my service in the United States of Congress, I took the initiative in creating the internet.

2272
03:32:30,020 --> 03:32:31,020
You bastards!

2273
03:32:31,020 --> 03:32:37,020
But you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you?

2274
03:32:37,020 --> 03:32:43,020
I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough whopper!

2275
03:32:43,020 --> 03:32:45,020
Please, good people, I am in haste!

2276
03:32:45,020 --> 03:32:47,020
I'm in hate

2277
03:34:45,020 --> 03:34:55,020
This is the end of the video, thank you for watching and see you in the next one.

2278
03:35:45,020 --> 03:36:06,020
Follow me to the edge of the sky

2279
03:36:06,020 --> 03:36:14,020
Follow me to the edge of the sky

2280
03:36:14,020 --> 03:36:18,020
to the edge

2281
03:36:21,020 --> 03:36:27,020
and follow me

2282
03:36:27,020 --> 03:36:32,020
into the dream

2283
03:36:37,020 --> 03:36:40,020
and dance with me

2284
03:36:40,020 --> 03:36:48,660
In the event of fire, let the night go by

2285
03:36:48,660 --> 03:36:54,420
And wake up early, fall asleep

2286
03:36:54,420 --> 03:37:04,660
And don't look down, follow me to the end

2287
03:37:04,660 --> 03:37:11,660
Follow me, to the end Follow me, to the end

2288
03:38:04,660 --> 03:38:12,660
Took me to the edge

2289
03:38:17,660 --> 03:38:26,660
Took me into the dream

2290
03:38:26,660 --> 03:38:39,660
And don't look down on me In the students of fire

2291
03:38:39,660 --> 03:38:43,660
And when the night falls on you

2292
03:38:43,660 --> 03:38:46,660
You wake up early

2293
03:38:46,660 --> 03:38:49,660
All afraid

2294
03:38:49,660 --> 03:38:53,660
And don't look down

2295
03:38:53,660 --> 03:38:56,660
Follow me

2296
03:38:56,660 --> 03:39:20,660
Follow me, take my hand, follow me, make the leap of faith, and when you're down.

2297
03:39:20,660 --> 03:39:34,660
Follow me, with my hands, hold the strings, make those knives, a passion for our dreams.

2298
03:39:34,660 --> 03:39:40,660
Hold me on the edge

2299
03:41:40,660 --> 03:41:42,660
He'll do that

2300
03:42:10,660 --> 03:42:14,660
And that's the reason why I'm here

2301
03:42:14,660 --> 03:42:17,660
I'm in New York

2302
03:42:17,660 --> 03:42:21,660
I'm in New York

2303
03:42:21,660 --> 03:42:27,660
I'm in New York

2304
03:42:27,660 --> 03:42:51,660
Tell me do you love somebody?

2305
03:42:51,660 --> 03:43:09,660
Tell me do you love somebody or need somebody

2306
03:43:09,660 --> 03:43:12,660
Just walk around and there's someone for you

2307
03:43:12,660 --> 03:43:16,660
And show you with our love you better

2308
03:43:16,660 --> 03:43:21,660
We'll be together and know that we'll be fine

2309
03:43:23,660 --> 03:43:30,660
Sometimes when you feel like the world is turning without you

2310
03:43:30,660 --> 03:43:34,660
And you believe it won't make it

2311
03:43:34,660 --> 03:43:36,660
Cause you're all alone

2312
03:43:37,660 --> 03:43:40,660
There's somebody here for you

2313
03:43:40,660 --> 03:43:42,660
Do you feel it too?

2314
03:43:42,660 --> 03:43:44,660
Tell me do you love somebody

2315
03:43:44,660 --> 03:43:49,660
Leave somebody, just look around and there's someone for you

2316
03:43:49,660 --> 03:43:54,660
They'll show you whether we all feel better, we'll be together

2317
03:43:54,660 --> 03:43:58,660
And know that the sand will be fine

2318
03:44:01,660 --> 03:44:05,660
Know that the sand will be fine

2319
03:44:08,660 --> 03:44:10,660
Know that the sand will be fine

2320
03:44:10,660 --> 03:44:17,660
All of the day when the sun shines on everyone but you

2321
03:44:17,660 --> 03:44:23,660
It's open your heart to a friend and the light comes your way

2322
03:44:23,660 --> 03:44:29,660
Remember to call my dear, there's somebody here

2323
03:44:29,660 --> 03:44:33,660
Tell me do you love somebody or need somebody

2324
03:44:33,660 --> 03:44:36,660
Just look around and there's someone for you

2325
03:44:36,660 --> 03:44:40,360
And show me you're with us, we all feel better

2326
03:44:40,360 --> 03:44:45,660
We'll be together, and no other friend will be fine

2327
03:44:48,660 --> 03:44:52,660
No other friend will be fine

2328
03:44:56,660 --> 03:45:00,660
Tell me do you love, tell me do you love somebody

2329
03:45:00,660 --> 03:45:03,660
Or need somebody, just look around her

2330
03:45:03,660 --> 03:45:08,660
I need someone for me to show me whether we all feel better

2331
03:45:08,660 --> 03:45:13,660
We'll be together and no other man will be fine

2332
03:45:17,660 --> 03:45:20,660
No other man will be fine

2333
03:45:23,660 --> 03:45:25,660
No other man will be fine

2334
03:45:26,660 --> 03:45:28,660
Go, go, daylight, go!

2335
03:45:28,660 --> 03:45:31,660
This is all the end here, monster

2336
03:46:01,660 --> 03:46:08,660
It can be sorrow, light and deception But it can keep you trading on evolution

2337
03:46:08,660 --> 03:46:14,660
Go, go, deluxe, go You're missing me but I'm still a star hero

2338
03:46:14,660 --> 03:46:20,660
Go, go, deluxe, go For the people, for the planet

2339
03:46:20,660 --> 03:46:26,660
Go, go, deluxe, go You're missing me but I'm still a star hero

2340
03:47:26,660 --> 03:47:43,660
Don't say it's like a fantasy When you know this is how it should be

2341
03:47:43,660 --> 03:47:50,660
You kiss me, I'm falling Can you hear me calling?

2342
03:47:50,660 --> 03:47:54,660
You touch me, I want to

2343
03:47:54,660 --> 03:47:58,660
Feels like I've always known you

2344
03:47:58,660 --> 03:48:01,660
I wanna die like this

2345
03:48:01,660 --> 03:48:05,660
I wanna stay forever

2346
03:48:05,660 --> 03:48:08,660
I wanna die like this

2347
03:48:08,660 --> 03:48:11,660
Just wanna be together

2348
03:48:11,660 --> 03:48:14,660
On a night like this

2349
03:48:20,660 --> 03:48:31,660
Now I'm getting closer to you for me

2350
03:48:31,660 --> 03:48:35,660
I just can't be without you

2351
03:48:35,660 --> 03:48:39,660
You can't see I'm falling

2352
03:48:39,660 --> 03:48:43,160
It's your name I'm calling

2353
03:48:43,160 --> 03:48:46,660
You touch me, I want you

2354
03:48:46,660 --> 03:48:50,160
Feels like I've always known you

2355
03:48:50,160 --> 03:48:53,160
What a life life is

2356
03:48:53,160 --> 03:48:55,660
I wanna stay forever

2357
03:48:55,660 --> 03:48:57,660
Stay forever

2358
03:48:57,660 --> 03:49:00,660

2362
03:49:13,160 --> 03:49:18,160
Now it's time to make you mine

2363
03:49:18,160 --> 03:49:24,160
Oh, I'm not my friend

2364

Oh, I'm not my friend

03:49:30,160 --> 03:49:59,160
I want to stay forever, stay forever I want to be together, on a night like this

2366
03:51:59,160 --> 03:52:24,520
You keep on walking on the other side, other side, other side

2367
03:52:24,520 --> 03:52:30,520
You keep on walking on the other side, other side, other side

2368
03:52:30,520 --> 03:52:37,520
Wherever you go, I'm coming with you Shouldn't you know, I'm bound to follow

2369
03:52:37,520 --> 03:52:45,520
Whatever you say, whatever you do I'll give you a clue, I'm gonna follow

2370
03:52:45,520 --> 03:52:52,520
And the sun will shine when the water flows

2371
03:52:52,520 --> 03:53:00,520
When the problems grow, that's where I need you

2372
03:53:00,520 --> 03:53:22,120
Why don't you let me, let me come along Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Where the waters flow

2380
03:53:50,920 --> 03:53:54,520
Where the gardens grow

2381
03:53:54,520 --> 03:53:57,920
That's where I'll meet you

2382
03:53:57,920 --> 03:54:04,720
And the sun will glow, melting all the snow

2383
03:54:04,720 --> 03:54:12,720

03:54:12,720 --> 03:54:20,720

2387
03:54:36,720 --> 03:54:40,720
Woah, woah

2388
03:54:44,720 --> 03:54:48,720
Woah

2389
03:54:48,720 --> 03:54:58,720
That's where I'll be with you

2390
03:55:28,720 --> 03:55:30,720
Oh

2391
03:56:28,720 --> 03:56:37,040
She told me, oh, get your ass, get your ass

2392
03:58:28,720 --> 03:58:31,720
Kuta, kuta, kuta, ee-oh, ee-oh

2393
03:58:52,720 --> 03:58:55,720
One day when I got the weed, I told you with the cops

2394
03:58:55,720 --> 03:58:59,160
I'd like to be a king of Gandhi, who lives in Kathmandu

2395
03:58:59,160 --> 03:59:02,760
Uncle Gandhi, he is rich, he's the tightest kind of man

2396
03:59:02,760 --> 03:59:06,360
And I know that he will help me, as much as he can

2397
03:59:06,360 --> 03:59:09,640
A king is like a man, he's what I want to be

2398
03:59:09,640 --> 03:59:13,320
After all, I've got him, but you want to ride with me

2399
03:59:13,320 --> 03:59:16,760
I don't know why it's okay that I'm on a fight

2400
03:59:16,760 --> 03:59:20,520
But every speed in Kathmandu is a fight

2401
03:59:20,520 --> 03:59:28,520
I am a sexy star, but I am a good star I play my little sexy in the good star

2402
03:59:28,520 --> 03:59:35,520
I'm a sexy sexy sexy in the good star I am a sexy girl in my age

2403
03:59:35,520 --> 03:59:53,280
I like it very much, even though I have no license

2404
03:59:53,280 --> 03:59:56,520
I always find a clutch, I can bind it up my hands

2405
03:59:56,520 --> 04:00:01,400
I can bind it up my feet, and I have no problem getting dirty

2406
04:01:31,400 --> 04:01:41,400
I am a sexy darling man

2407
04:02:01,400 --> 04:02:01,900
Hey!

2408
04:02:17,400 --> 04:02:20,400
You can feel my heart, what you feel deep inside

2409
04:02:20,400 --> 04:02:23,400
And it feels the best, baby, my, my, my, my

2410
04:02:23,400 --> 04:02:26,400
It's the sense of your soul, that you try to relieve

2411
04:02:26,400 --> 04:02:29,400
You never understand your heart, it functions

2412
04:02:29,400 --> 04:02:31,400
Feel it, feel it, baby

2413
04:02:31,400 --> 04:02:35,400
Feel the fire, it's burning deep inside me

2414
04:02:35,400 --> 04:02:37,400
Listen, listen, honey

2415
04:02:37,400 --> 04:02:40,400
Listen to, come listen to you

2416
04:02:40,400 --> 04:02:42,400
Listen to the heartbeat

2417
04:02:42,400 --> 04:02:44,400
Whoa-oh-oh

2418
04:02:44,400 --> 04:02:46,400
You better take your chance right now

2419
04:02:46,400 --> 04:02:48,400
Listen to the heartbeat

2420
04:02:48,400 --> 04:02:50,400
And let it go

2421
04:02:50,400 --> 04:02:52,400
You can follow that if you find it cool

2422
04:02:52,400 --> 04:02:54,400
Listen to the heartbeat

2423
04:02:54,400 --> 04:02:56,400
Whoa-oh-oh

2424
04:02:56,400 --> 04:02:59,400
You better take your chances right now

2425
04:02:59,400 --> 04:03:01,400
Dance to the heartbeat

2426
04:03:01,400 --> 04:03:02,900
And let it go

2427
04:03:02,900 --> 04:03:05,400
You can follow that and you'll find it cool

2428
04:03:05,400 --> 04:03:20,400
This is a heartbeat

2429
04:03:35,400 --> 04:03:39,400
Push, you'll never walk, go home

2430
04:03:39,400 --> 04:03:42,400
Get every one of them to set a set of steps

2431
04:03:42,400 --> 04:03:45,400
From the bottom of the top, the camera top

2432
04:03:45,400 --> 04:03:49,400
To the jiggy old guy, the villain's got his top

2433
04:03:49,400 --> 04:03:52,400
No matter what, I never thought that

2434
04:03:52,400 --> 04:03:56,400
Daddy didn't want a really smart guy

2435
04:03:56,400 --> 04:04:01,400
But that is something we all know

2436
04:05:01,400 --> 04:05:03,400
You

2437
04:06:01,400 --> 04:06:03,400
You

You

2443
04:07:59,400 --> 04:08:13,400
The following bit of randomness has been brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

2444
04:08:13,400 --> 04:08:14,400
Dateline, the Muppet Show.

2445
04:08:14,400 --> 04:08:18,880
It has been reported just moments ago that a large heavy object was dropped from the

2446
04:08:18,880 --> 04:08:19,880
ceiling.

2447
04:08:19,880 --> 04:08:20,880
Further developments will...

2448
04:08:20,880 --> 04:08:21,880
Hey, did you boil it down there?

2449
04:08:21,880 --> 04:08:22,880
That's the biggest thing I've ever seen, Diggleberry.

2450
04:08:22,880 --> 04:08:24,880
The best berry ever seen, Diggleberry!

2451
04:11:22,880 --> 04:11:41,560
So have sex with your ex, it will knock you off your lags, oh lags, babe, don't ask, just

It will knock you off your likes

2455
04:11:48,560 --> 04:11:51,560

2467
04:13:39,320 --> 04:13:41,280
I don't know what I'm gonna do

2468
04:13:41,280 --> 04:13:42,280
I gotta warn you

2469
04:13:42,280 --> 04:13:45,080
Relax, wrong effects with your act

2470
04:13:45,480 --> 04:13:47,280
It'll make you like to flex my mind

2471
04:13:47,280 --> 04:13:49,280
But baby, take it easy

2472
04:13:49,280 --> 04:13:51,980
Relax, wrong effects with your act

2473
04:13:51,980 --> 04:13:54,280
I'm gonna, I'll be like, I'll be like

2474
04:13:54,280 --> 04:13:56,280
Stayin' cool and shy

2475
04:13:56,280 --> 04:13:58,280
Relax, relax

2476
04:13:58,280 --> 04:14:01,280
I gotta warn you

2477
04:14:01,280 --> 04:14:05,280
Don't have sex with your ex, baby

2478
04:14:05,280 --> 04:14:08,280
Oh, oh, oh

2479
04:14:23,280 --> 04:14:25,280
Oh, baby

2480
04:14:55,280 --> 04:14:57,280
Will knock you off your legs, other legs

2481
04:14:58,280 --> 04:15:00,280
When you're cool and just relax, relax

2482
04:15:01,280 --> 04:15:03,280
I gotta warm you up

2483
04:15:04,280 --> 04:15:08,280
So don't hit that when you're next, next, next

2484
04:15:09,280 --> 04:15:12,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

2485
04:15:13,280 --> 04:15:14,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

2486
04:15:15,280 --> 04:15:17,280
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry

2487
04:15:18,280 --> 04:15:20,280
No way to go nothing to do with my time

2488
04:15:21,280 --> 04:15:23,280
I get lonely

2489
04:15:23,280 --> 04:15:29,280
So lonely, little man

2490
04:15:29,280 --> 04:15:56,640
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry

2491
04:15:56,640 --> 04:16:07,640
The weather's gonna seem to do it my time I get lonely, so lonely, living on my own

2492
04:16:07,640 --> 04:16:13,640
Sometimes I feel I'm always walking too fast And everything is gonna sound almost out on me

2493
04:16:13,640 --> 04:16:19,640
I go easy, on some places

2494
04:16:19,640 --> 04:16:26,640
Livin' on my own

2495
04:16:26,640 --> 04:16:29,640
Come on baby, he don't have it

2496
04:16:29,640 --> 04:16:30,640
He don't have it

2497
04:16:30,640 --> 04:16:32,640
I don't have the time

2498
04:16:32,640 --> 04:16:34,640
For a monkey today

2499
04:16:34,640 --> 04:16:36,640
He don't have it

2500
04:16:36,640 --> 04:16:37,640
He don't have it

2501
04:16:37,640 --> 04:16:41,640
He's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, hey

2502
04:16:41,640 --> 04:16:46,640
Hey, you can take some good times, I ain't one to blame

2503
04:17:03,640 --> 04:17:06,640
Can't you feel my body gives me the warning

2504
04:17:06,640 --> 04:17:12,640
But my head is always up and wild to the dream world

2505
04:17:12,640 --> 04:17:18,640
It's not easy to live with a mother

2506
04:17:20,640 --> 04:17:23,640
She don't have it, she don't have it

2507
04:17:23,640 --> 04:17:27,640
I don't have the time or the money to be saved

2508
04:17:27,640 --> 04:17:30,640
She don't have it, she don't have it

2509
04:17:30,640 --> 04:17:34,640
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah

2510
04:17:34,640 --> 04:17:37,640
Got to fix what's on my head

2511
04:17:37,640 --> 04:17:40,640
He don't have it, he don't have it

2512
04:17:40,640 --> 04:17:42,640
I don't care, I'm up and down

2513
04:17:42,640 --> 04:17:44,640
Oh, oh, oh, give me that

2514
04:17:44,640 --> 04:17:47,640
He don't have it, he don't have it

2515
04:17:47,640 --> 04:17:51,640
I said so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah

2516
04:18:21,640 --> 04:18:28,640
Let's go for it, right now I'm gone Let's go for it, right now I'm gone

2517
04:18:51,640 --> 04:18:53,640
You can't sit

2518
04:18:53,640 --> 04:18:56,640
All of this was the beginning

2519
04:18:56,640 --> 04:18:59,640
It was the end of the year

2520
04:18:59,640 --> 04:19:00,640
The sky is falling, eyes are falling

2521
04:19:00,640 --> 04:19:02,640
You have no chance to make a mess

2522
04:19:02,640 --> 04:19:03,640
Love is a bust, life don't love

2523
04:19:03,640 --> 04:19:04,640
The blues are a bust

2524
04:19:04,640 --> 04:19:05,640
We was on the cusp

2525
04:19:05,640 --> 04:19:06,640
Crying out for more than a year

2526
04:19:06,640 --> 04:19:07,640
And I turned around and had no fear

2527
04:19:07,640 --> 04:19:09,640
Believe me, because I'll show you the way

2528
04:19:09,640 --> 04:19:10,640
Woo, woo

2529
04:19:10,640 --> 04:19:11,640
Some people think that it's too late

2530
04:19:11,640 --> 04:19:13,640
It's so scary, let's wait and see

2531
04:19:13,640 --> 04:19:14,640
The world will shut down, all the world will win

2532
04:19:14,640 --> 04:19:16,640
People are afraid they need to get bit

2533
04:19:16,640 --> 04:19:17,640
Fire at the top, don't know where to stop

2534
04:19:17,640 --> 04:19:18,640
Let it pop, nah, stop, stop

2535
04:19:18,640 --> 04:19:20,640
Remember these words are what I said

2536
04:19:20,640 --> 04:19:21,840
It's just why we come free

2537
04:19:21,840 --> 04:19:24,340
Just feel it, feel it

2538
04:19:24,340 --> 04:19:26,340
It's amazing

2539
04:19:26,340 --> 04:19:28,840
Oh boy, I want to lose

2540
04:19:28,840 --> 04:19:30,840
Nobody gets me

2541
04:19:33,340 --> 04:19:35,840
Some just say the world is changing

2542
04:19:35,840 --> 04:19:38,840
Many people will come in

2543
04:19:38,840 --> 04:19:41,840
Many changes we are seeing

2544
04:19:41,840 --> 04:19:44,840
I just say it's the end, the end, the end

2545
04:19:44,840 --> 04:19:46,840
I'll just enjoy it

2546
04:21:46,840 --> 04:21:48,840
Oh

2547
04:22:16,840 --> 04:22:21,840
Oh oh, let's get good

2548
04:22:21,840 --> 04:22:26,840
We gonna move tonight

2549
04:22:26,840 --> 04:22:29,840
Let's move tonight

2550
04:22:29,840 --> 04:22:33,840
Share the price of life

2551
04:22:33,840 --> 04:22:37,840
Oh oh, let's get good

2552
04:22:37,840 --> 04:22:40,840
We gonna move tonight

2553
04:22:40,840 --> 04:22:45,840
Let's get good

2554
04:22:45,840 --> 04:22:51,840
All right, ooh, let's just go

2555
04:22:51,840 --> 04:22:56,840
Stand up, stand up, stand up, all right

2556
04:22:56,840 --> 04:23:00,840
Let's, let's just go, have a feel

2557
04:23:00,840 --> 04:23:04,840
All right, all right, all right

2558
04:23:04,840 --> 04:23:07,840
Let's just go, stay true

2559
04:23:07,840 --> 04:23:12,840
To the sound of our eyes, our eyes

2560
04:23:12,840 --> 04:23:42,520
Can you hear me from above Do you feel the same inside of me?

2561
04:23:42,520 --> 04:23:50,520
Flashing through the window in the air

2562
04:23:50,520 --> 04:23:59,520
Just in time, no one cares to die

2563
04:23:59,520 --> 04:24:07,520
Can you see me from above?

2564
04:24:07,520 --> 04:24:16,520
Do you share my frozen memory with the stars?

2565
04:24:16,520 --> 04:24:28,520
Leaving me alone, darling just staying all alone

2566
04:24:28,520 --> 04:24:32,520
Let us not face me

2567
04:24:32,520 --> 04:24:37,520
Please give me brand new star tonight

2568
04:24:37,520 --> 04:24:43,520
Just make it one for all

2569
04:24:43,520 --> 04:24:47,520
Let's not fake me

2570
04:24:47,520 --> 04:24:52,520
Please give me rain from yesterday

2571
04:24:52,520 --> 04:24:54,520
I don't need

2572
04:24:54,520 --> 04:24:58,520
Take my hand

2573
04:25:24,520 --> 04:25:41,520
Can you watch me fall above, knowing someone keeps coming along,

2574
04:25:41,520 --> 04:25:43,520
Woe me free

2575
04:25:45,520 --> 04:25:48,520
Never seem to come

2576
04:25:49,520 --> 04:25:51,520
Cover me

2577
04:25:52,520 --> 04:25:56,520
Spring us far away

2578
04:25:58,520 --> 04:26:02,520
Can you guide me for my vow?

2579
04:26:02,520 --> 04:26:26,520
All I need is just a little light, don't worry I won't stand for that yellow's watch, hiding all I need

2580
04:26:32,520 --> 04:26:56,520
Let us not thank me, please keep me round You look what I just began, was born

2581
04:26:56,520 --> 04:27:00,520
Let us not take me

2582
04:27:00,520 --> 04:27:04,520
Please keep me brave for what a ride

2583
04:27:04,520 --> 04:27:12,520
Might for me take my hand

2584
04:27:12,520 --> 04:27:21,520
Let it not take me

2585
04:27:42,520 --> 04:27:56,160
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

2586

Under Sedation Live with Travis, Ron, and Jessica, Saturdays, 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.

Oh

2589
04:31:33,360 --> 04:32:02,360
In the far real you've got to learn how to survive

2590
04:32:02,360 --> 04:32:07,360
Cause you never know when it's your turn to take a time

2591
04:32:07,360 --> 04:32:13,360
So you go, you stay with your eyes in the back of your head

2592
04:32:13,360 --> 04:32:19,360
And you never know if you'll be alive or be dead

2593
04:32:19,360 --> 04:32:25,360
That is why, always have it, you tell your midnight special

2594
04:32:25,360 --> 04:32:30,360
Never leave, or without it, always better with a midnight special

2595
04:32:30,360 --> 04:32:35,360
In the dark, on the street, never know who you're gonna be

2596
04:32:35,360 --> 04:32:37,360
You're gonna need no money

2597
04:32:37,360 --> 04:32:41,360
You've got to make that switch on

You told me once that you loved me You said that I was the only one

2609

You're the only one

2610

It's up and down but now I know

04:44:52,920 --> 04:44:55,920

It's a good start, yeah, everybody at me

2658
04:44:58,920 --> 04:45:01,920
Everybody wants my virgin star

2659
04:45:01,920 --> 04:45:04,920
I'll never let them know I feel

2660
04:45:04,920 --> 04:45:06,920
This is the time

2661
04:45:06,920 --> 04:45:09,920
So don't feel me like a virgin

2662
04:45:09,920 --> 04:45:11,920
If you're lookin' like a virgin

2663
04:45:11,920 --> 04:45:15,420
You just stay with me

2664
04:45:15,420 --> 04:45:18,920
Go from feeling like a virgin to me

2665
04:45:18,920 --> 04:45:23,920
I don't know, I guess you'd like to say this to me

2666
04:46:53,920 --> 04:46:55,920
Oh

2667
04:50:23,920 --> 04:50:40,560
I'm a cowgirl, bang-a-doo-bang People say that I'm a bad girl, and I enjoy

2668
04:50:40,560 --> 04:50:48,040
it all the time I'm living in a sad world, but I know what's

2669
04:50:48,040 --> 04:50:59,040
on my mind. I am free as a bird, even though you tell me that I can't fly. I ain't easy

2670
04:50:59,040 --> 04:51:08,040
to hurt, I have a perfect life and I'm telling you why. I'm a cowgirl, and I'm riding on

2671
04:51:08,040 --> 04:51:15,040
my own, bang bang bang, and I'm shooting all around. I'm a cowgirl, I can't wait to go,

2672
04:51:15,040 --> 04:51:19,040
Bang bang bang, it's so good to be back

2673
04:51:33,040 --> 04:51:40,040
I'm a cowgirl, and I'm riding on my own Bang bang bang, stayin' light on the floor

2674
04:51:40,040 --> 04:51:48,040
I'm a cowgirl and I'm happy with that Bang, bang, bang, it's so good to be back

2675
04:53:40,040 --> 04:54:08,040
Don't go wasting your emotions Lay all your love on me

2676
04:54:08,040 --> 04:54:15,040
Don't go sharing your devotion

2677
04:54:15,040 --> 04:54:21,040
Lay all your love on me

2678
04:54:21,040 --> 04:54:43,200
It was like shooting or standing up A little small talk with my bad baby

2679
04:54:43,200 --> 04:54:50,400
I was done I feel that now what you've done with me

2680
04:54:50,400 --> 04:54:54,600
I'm from a world that you'd never fall so deep in

2681
04:54:57,000 --> 04:54:58,600
I feel a lot of fear

2682
04:55:00,400 --> 04:55:02,000
When I don't have your fear

2683
04:55:04,000 --> 04:55:05,600
I'm satisfied

2684
04:55:05,600 --> 04:55:07,400
I feel my pride

2685
04:55:07,400 --> 04:55:11,600
I think it's here

2686
04:55:13,000 --> 04:55:19,400
Don't go wasting your emotions

2687
04:55:19,400 --> 04:55:26,400
Lay all your love on me

2688
04:55:40,400 --> 04:55:44,400
I've had a few little love affairs

2689
04:55:44,400 --> 04:55:49,400
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty dense

2690
04:55:51,400 --> 04:55:54,400
I used to think that was sensible

2691
04:55:55,400 --> 04:55:59,400
Expect the truth even more, it's all preventable

2692
04:56:01,400 --> 04:56:03,400
But everything is new

2693
04:56:05,400 --> 04:56:07,400
And everything is true

2694
04:56:08,400 --> 04:56:10,400
And all I try

2695
04:56:10,400 --> 04:56:16,400
In all my time, what can I do?

2696
04:56:17,400 --> 04:56:24,400
Don't go wasting your emotions

2697
04:56:24,400 --> 04:56:31,400
Lay all your love on me

2698
04:56:31,400 --> 04:56:38,400
Don't go carrying your devotion

2699
04:57:01,400 --> 04:57:09,880

That you've got

2702
04:59:04,400 --> 04:59:06,400
What that it seems

2703
04:59:06,400 --> 04:59:07,400
Just as you're leaving

2704
04:59:07,400 --> 04:59:09,400
We're hiding, hiding

2705
04:59:09,400 --> 04:59:10,400

All you were saying

But they don't know

2711
04:59:17,400 --> 04:59:18,400
How much you've done

2712
04:59:18,400 --> 04:59:20,400
And leave it there

2713
04:59:20,400 --> 04:59:21,400
From now on

2714
04:59:21,400 --> 04:59:36,520
You don't have to believe in a heart of a doubt

2715

Can you keep me like a nasty girl, you want a nasty love I know that you want it honey,

05:05:01,880 --> 05:05:02,880
Take it higher

2734
05:05:02,880 --> 05:05:04,880
Feel your body burning with desire

2735
05:05:04,880 --> 05:05:05,880
One step

2736
05:05:05,880 --> 05:05:06,880
A little closer

2737
05:05:06,880 --> 05:05:07,880
Turn around and shake it

2738
05:05:07,880 --> 05:05:10,880
I'm a kingdom like y'all so closer, a rollercoaster

2739
05:05:10,880 --> 05:05:12,880
About this time I'll be the suggestion

2740
05:05:12,880 --> 05:05:14,880
Get on my damn foot to use this wreckin' it's hot

2741
05:05:14,880 --> 05:05:16,880
And when I find it, fire

2742
05:05:16,880 --> 05:05:19,880
Realize my fire

2743
05:05:19,880 --> 05:05:22,880
You're lovin' up on me

2744
05:05:22,880 --> 05:05:23,880
Realize your

2745
05:05:23,880 --> 05:05:26,880
Realize your fire

2746
05:05:26,880 --> 05:05:30,880
For me

2747
05:05:30,880 --> 05:05:34,880
Realize my fire

2748
05:05:34,880 --> 05:05:38,880
Your love is upon the designer

2749
05:05:38,880 --> 05:05:40,880
Realizing the fire

2750
05:05:40,880 --> 05:05:44,880
From underneath

2751
05:07:14,880 --> 05:07:18,360
And I, I'm gonna let her go on me

2752
05:07:18,360 --> 05:07:20,780
I'm gonna let her know that I can't

2753
05:07:20,780 --> 05:07:25,780
Don't you leave, that's what I can't talk about

2754
05:07:50,780 --> 05:08:19,780
Kicking from a rainy Thursday on the Avenue I thought I heard you talking so slow

2755
05:08:19,780 --> 05:08:26,780
I sit on the lights, the TV and the radio

2756
05:08:26,780 --> 05:08:33,780
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

2757
05:08:33,780 --> 05:08:36,780
What is happening to it all?

2758
05:08:36,780 --> 05:08:40,780
Crazy sometimes

2759
05:08:40,780 --> 05:08:46,780
Where is the light that I recognize?

2760
05:08:46,780 --> 05:08:51,780
It's gone away, but I won't cry for yesterday

2761
05:08:51,780 --> 05:09:01,780
There's an ordinary world, somehow I have to find

2762
05:09:01,780 --> 05:09:09,780
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world

2763
05:09:09,780 --> 05:09:16,780
I will learn to survive

2764
05:09:39,780 --> 05:09:44,780
In the mist of a tropical mountain

2765
05:09:46,780 --> 05:09:49,780
Why do you cry when you're happy?

2766
05:09:49,780 --> 05:09:53,780
It's just something special

2767
05:09:53,780 --> 05:10:00,780
Why do you see why I don't keep talking in the blue sky?

2768
05:10:01,780 --> 05:10:04,780
Yeah, it's so much because

2769
05:10:04,780 --> 05:10:08,780
It's so much imagination

2770
05:10:38,780 --> 05:10:42,000
Yeah, it's so much because

2771
05:10:42,000 --> 05:10:45,580
It's our fascination

2772
05:10:45,580 --> 05:10:49,320
I have a secret to I really need

2773
05:10:49,320 --> 05:10:52,840
Can you please leave us with the fear?

2774
05:10:54,840 --> 05:10:56,840
Are you with me all the way?

2775
05:11:56,840 --> 05:11:58,840
Oh

2776
05:12:56,840 --> 05:13:03,840
Kissing blue heather, most of all to me

2777
05:13:03,840 --> 05:13:11,840
Kissing blue heather, blessed is the memory

2778
05:13:11,840 --> 05:13:16,840
Make me do it any other way

2779
05:14:46,840 --> 05:14:55,840
Oh, some with eggs on the mountaintop The most dearest monkey to ever meet

2780
05:14:55,840 --> 05:15:03,840
He knows every magic trick under the sun He's the guy that everyone can have some fun

2781
05:15:03,840 --> 05:15:12,840
Monkey magic, monkey magic Monkey magic, monkey magic

2782
05:15:42,840 --> 05:15:52,840
He knew every magic under the sun He forgot that everyone had some fun

2783
05:15:52,840 --> 05:16:09,840
Monkey magic, monkey magic

2784
05:16:22,840 --> 05:16:38,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

2785
05:16:38,840 --> 05:16:45,840
I sing about you almost every day My mind is made up by me tonight and day

2786
05:16:45,840 --> 05:16:51,840
You're my obsession but I wait in line I'll pretend until then that I'm doing fine

2787
05:16:51,840 --> 05:17:01,840
I know that my feelings show, but I guess that's the way to let you know I'm you

2788
05:17:01,840 --> 05:17:04,840
What else can I do?

2789
05:17:04,840 --> 05:17:11,840
You want my fantasy, you want my energy

2790
05:17:11,840 --> 05:17:18,840
Baby can't you see that you belong to me

2791
05:17:18,840 --> 05:17:20,840
And it ain't love

2792
05:17:33,840 --> 05:17:35,840
I was waiting for the moment in time

2793
05:17:35,840 --> 05:17:39,840
And the moment came up to make you mine

2794
05:17:39,840 --> 05:17:43,840
I gotta have you, I need you baby

2795
05:17:43,840 --> 05:17:46,840
One look in your eyes and I gotta say

2796
05:17:46,840 --> 05:17:49,840
I know that my feelings show

2797
05:17:49,840 --> 05:17:54,840
But I guess that's the way to let you know I need you

2798
05:17:56,840 --> 05:17:58,840
What else can I do?

2799
05:17:59,840 --> 05:18:02,840
You are my fantasy

2800
05:18:02,840 --> 05:18:26,840
You are my fantasy, you are my energy Baby, can't you see that you belong to me?

2801
05:18:26,840 --> 05:18:52,200
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

2802
05:19:26,840 --> 05:19:30,340
I'm an angry creep

2803
05:19:32,840 --> 05:19:38,340
There's a key over me to the bed

2804
05:19:39,340 --> 05:19:43,340
You are, I'm an angry creep

2805
05:19:46,340 --> 05:19:51,340
There's a little door behind me

2806
05:21:21,340 --> 05:21:33,740
What you doing over there, come on, let's do this for the F.

2807
05:21:33,740 --> 05:21:41,060
What you got in your hand, this man is amazing, put it away, it's gonna go bang, blow my brain,

2808
05:21:41,060 --> 05:21:42,060
ha.

2809
05:21:42,060 --> 05:21:48,060
So let's leave a little bit today, just tryin' to get a little bit of space for it to happen.

2810
05:21:48,060 --> 05:21:49,340
You know I ain't laughing, it's like a game

2811
05:21:49,340 --> 05:21:50,840
Just how long is it gonna stay sane?

2812
05:21:50,840 --> 05:21:51,840
Cut the blood!

2813
05:22:20,840 --> 05:22:46,760
All the days where we just played Back in school, just me and you

2814
05:22:46,760 --> 05:22:53,760
But I can't forget you now What am I supposed to do?

2815
05:22:53,760 --> 05:23:00,760
We can be mother friends Do you know I'm here for you?

2816
05:23:00,760 --> 05:23:07,760
Cause you're so easy to love When you smile the skies are blue

Why? You leave me alone, so tell me why?

There is no need to carry on, leave me alone if I'm not right

2856
05:30:43,520 --> 05:30:51,520
And why? You leave me alone, so many days, you're thinking of you so many nights

2857
05:30:51,520 --> 05:30:56,520

05:31:40,520 --> 05:31:45,520

Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

2866
05:35:20,420 --> 05:35:28,440
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

2867
05:35:30,160 --> 05:35:36,260
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

2868
05:36:06,260 --> 05:36:08,260
Let me go

2869
05:36:08,260 --> 05:36:23,440

05:37:36,720 --> 05:37:38,320
Let it, let it go

2878
05:38:38,320 --> 05:38:45,320
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!

2879
05:39:08,320 --> 05:39:10,320
Oh

2880
05:39:38,320 --> 05:39:43,320
I'm not sure you'll remember but, still

2881
05:39:43,320 --> 05:39:44,520
I'm in a good mood

2882
05:39:44,520 --> 05:39:46,520
Boy I just wanna know

2883
05:39:46,520 --> 05:39:53,020
Don't want to go and give everything you're worth

2884
05:39:53,020 --> 05:39:55,720
You won't be able to say something more

2885
05:39:55,720 --> 05:40:01,060
I got anything connected

2886
05:40:01,060 --> 05:40:01,980
You only know if I know

2887
05:40:01,980 --> 05:39:52,220
Heaud I

2888
05:40:02,320 --> 05:40:03,220
I can't

2889
05:40:03,220 --> 05:40:05,120
I never want to get up

2890
05:41:05,120 --> 05:41:23,460
1, 2, 3, 4,, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 21, 22,

2891
05:41:23,460 --> 05:41:28,460
If you like this video, please subscribe to my channel.

2892
05:41:58,460 --> 05:42:00,460
Ain't ready for me

2893
05:42:00,460 --> 05:42:03,460
I got a recipe I'm gonna share

2894
05:42:03,460 --> 05:42:05,460
Come after me, you'll be better

2895
05:44:03,460 --> 05:44:08,820
Caught up in the world, the world's a dark and rainy day

2896
05:44:08,820 --> 05:44:13,220
Just to save yourself, all we live to learn

2897
05:44:13,220 --> 05:44:16,020
A chemical can never be enough

2898
05:44:16,020 --> 05:44:22,660
You need the thrill of love

2899
05:44:22,660 --> 05:44:26,020
From there I feel the thrill

2900
05:44:26,020 --> 05:44:29,500
We're here to come back

2901
05:44:29,500 --> 05:44:36,260
We're here to feel the love

2902
05:44:36,260 --> 05:44:39,660
We're here to feel the pain

2903
05:44:39,660 --> 05:44:44,660
We can't come back

2904
05:45:09,660 --> 05:45:35,340
I'm chemical love and I'm free from the infection More taste to taste mess with me and I'll bomb

2905
05:45:35,340 --> 05:45:37,340
Let's just dance, don't give me room

2906
05:45:37,340 --> 05:45:39,340
I'll do within my head this time

2907
05:45:39,340 --> 05:45:41,340
When you drop to the floor

2908
05:45:41,340 --> 05:45:43,340
Just as I pump some more

2909
05:45:43,340 --> 05:45:45,340
Get the tension in your body to take a beat

2910
05:45:45,340 --> 05:45:47,340
When I fall apart, it's time to knock that it's free

2911
05:45:47,340 --> 05:45:49,340
You got to learn to bite me

2912
05:45:49,340 --> 05:45:51,340
So you should beware

2913
05:45:51,340 --> 05:45:53,340
with the flavor in the air

2914
05:47:51,340 --> 05:48:17,340
Yeah, yeah, this is my music style

2915
05:50:17,340 --> 05:50:19,840
Try for a stranger's aim

2916
05:50:19,840 --> 05:50:23,340
Tonight I need to play a brand new game

2917
05:50:23,340 --> 05:50:28,340
I know I'll find you, just look around you

2918
05:50:28,340 --> 05:50:29,840
Come on!

2919
05:50:29,840 --> 05:50:33,340
I spent tonight and all my dreams come true

2920
05:50:33,340 --> 05:50:36,340
You never give a scene just for me to know

2921
05:50:36,340 --> 05:50:41,840
You are the light in his eyes

2922
05:50:41,840 --> 05:50:45,340
While your light makes me fly

2923
05:50:45,340 --> 05:50:48,340
I'm gonna make you cry

2924
05:50:48,340 --> 05:50:55,340
I want you to stay by my side

2925
05:50:56,340 --> 05:50:59,340
Nothing's gonna stop me now tonight

2926
05:50:59,340 --> 05:51:02,340
Nothing's gonna stop me now

2927
05:51:02,340 --> 05:51:04,340
I'm crying for you

2928
05:51:04,340 --> 05:51:08,340
I'm dreaming of you

2929
05:51:09,340 --> 05:51:12,340
Nothing's gonna stop me now tonight

2930
05:51:12,340 --> 05:51:15,340
Nothing's gonna stop me now

2931
05:51:15,340 --> 05:51:18,340
I'll fly for you

2932
05:51:18,340 --> 05:51:25,340
I'm living always on you

2933
05:51:27,340 --> 05:51:30,340
Nothing, nothing

2934
05:51:30,340 --> 05:51:34,340
Don't stop me now

2935
05:51:34,340 --> 05:51:43,340
Do you believe in destiny?

2936
05:51:43,340 --> 05:51:50,340
I close my eyes and dream that you are closer to me

2937
05:51:50,340 --> 05:51:57,340
So follow me and you will see

2938
05:51:57,340 --> 05:52:08,340
Together we can touch the sky, we're flying so high, high, higher

2939
05:52:08,340 --> 05:52:23,340
Oh, do you believe?

2940
05:52:23,340 --> 05:52:32,340
Oh, do you believe?

2941
05:52:32,340 --> 05:52:38,340
I'll see you last night

2942
05:52:39,340 --> 05:52:45,340
Until the morning sky

2943
05:52:46,340 --> 05:52:51,340
The light inside my heart will last forever

2944
05:52:52,340 --> 05:52:58,340
And in my dreams I'll never let you go

2945
05:52:58,340 --> 05:53:05,340
I know you need to be with me

2946
05:53:05,340 --> 05:53:12,340
When something feels so good, it's only a fantasy

2947
05:53:12,340 --> 05:53:19,340
Every time I'm by, I wonder why

2948
05:53:19,340 --> 05:53:26,340
Will you be here with me someday? I'll fade it away

2949
05:53:26,340 --> 05:53:33,340
I feel alive tonight

2950
05:53:33,340 --> 05:53:40,340
Until one is down

2951
05:53:40,340 --> 05:53:47,340
The light inside my heart will last forever

2952
05:53:47,340 --> 05:53:53,340
And in my dreams I'll never let you go

2953
05:53:53,340 --> 05:53:57,340
Here we go

2954
05:54:23,340 --> 05:54:49,340
I'll see the light tonight I'll see the morning sky

2955
05:54:49,340 --> 05:54:55,340
The light inside my heart will last forever

2956
05:54:56,340 --> 05:55:02,340
And in my dreams I'll never let you go

2957
05:55:03,340 --> 05:55:09,340
I'm free and alive tonight

2958
05:55:10,340 --> 05:55:16,340
Until the morning sky

2959
05:55:16,340 --> 05:55:22,340
I decide my heart will last forever

2960
05:55:23,340 --> 05:55:28,340
And in my dreams I'll never let you go

2961
05:55:28,340 --> 05:55:54,960
I need you, baby I need you, baby

2962
05:56:24,960 --> 05:56:41,960
I need you baby, I need you baby

2963
05:56:54,960 --> 05:57:08,960
I need you baby, like a flower in the rain My life is like a dream, I'll be the same day

2964
05:57:08,960 --> 05:57:13,960
Take you high, girl, and you'll never see me more You know me, Rosie, you'll be screaming out for more

2965
05:57:13,960 --> 05:57:18,960
I need you baby, like a flower in the rain My life is like a dream, I'll be the same day

2966
06:00:18,960 --> 06:00:20,960
You

2967
06:00:48,960 --> 06:00:52,960
Happy day, happy day, happy day

2968
06:00:52,960 --> 06:00:58,960
Save another day, I'm maybe a night away

2969
06:00:58,960 --> 06:01:02,960
I'll be coming to you one day

2970
06:01:02,960 --> 06:01:09,960
One day, one day, one day

2971
06:01:09,960 --> 06:01:12,960
One day, one day, one day

2972
06:01:42,960 --> 06:01:44,960
on me

2973
06:06:12,960 --> 06:06:19,960
Let me know what you think in the comments below and I'll see you in the next video.

2974
06:06:42,960 --> 06:06:44,960
You

2975
06:11:42,960 --> 06:11:44,960
Oh

2976
06:12:12,960 --> 06:12:17,960
Was there anything? Every night? I did it every night

2977
06:12:17,960 --> 06:12:22,960
Oh, everyday, I was your everything

2978
06:12:22,960 --> 06:12:25,960
Every night, I did it every night

2979
06:12:25,960 --> 06:12:30,960
Oh, I was born again

2980
06:12:33,960 --> 06:12:39,960
I'm a man, I'm a man

2981
06:13:09,960 --> 06:13:12,460
I need to die, I die

2982
06:13:12,460 --> 06:13:13,960
Use my heart, I die

2983
06:13:13,960 --> 06:13:16,460
Use my mind in my head

2984
06:13:16,460 --> 06:13:18,460
Use my heart, I die

2985
06:13:18,460 --> 06:13:22,460
I think you'll remember

2986
06:13:48,460 --> 06:14:06,460
Every night, I hear your voice Baby, every day and every night

2987
06:15:48,460 --> 06:16:08,460
I see you how I feel it, my hustle's around me so please

2988
06:16:08,460 --> 06:16:14,460
Take on the dream and stop me, take on the chance of working

2989
06:16:14,460 --> 06:16:18,460
It's time to say goodbye to my face

2990
06:16:18,460 --> 06:16:23,460
I want you to know that I'm ready to be empty

2991
06:16:23,460 --> 06:16:27,460
It's my time, I need to face it

2992
06:16:27,460 --> 06:16:29,460
That's it for you

2993
06:16:29,460 --> 06:16:31,460
You don't need to love me again

2994
06:16:31,460 --> 06:16:33,460
To see I'm going to do that

2995
06:16:33,460 --> 06:16:35,460
That's it for you

2996
06:16:35,460 --> 06:16:37,460
I can't take it over

2997
06:16:37,460 --> 06:16:39,960
I won't stand in line

2998
06:16:45,460 --> 06:16:47,960
Somebody, somebody, somebody, who are you?

2999
06:16:55,460 --> 06:16:57,960
No matter what I'm feeling

3000
06:16:58,460 --> 06:17:00,960
You couldn't see that me inside

3001
06:17:01,460 --> 06:17:03,960
I don't mean that, honey

3002
06:17:03,960 --> 06:17:06,960
But you mustn't need that hype

3003
06:17:06,960 --> 06:17:10,960
I'm living in your reality

3004
06:17:12,960 --> 06:17:15,960
So I have made up my mind

3005
06:17:15,960 --> 06:17:18,960
So it's part of my good thing

3006
06:17:18,960 --> 06:17:21,960
That's it for you

3007
06:17:21,960 --> 06:17:23,960
You don't have to welcome me

3008
06:17:23,960 --> 06:17:25,960
Can't you see I'm going to love you?

3009
06:17:25,960 --> 06:17:27,960
That's it for you

3010
06:17:27,960 --> 06:17:29,960
I can't take you no more

3011
06:17:29,960 --> 06:17:31,960
I don't want you anymore

3012
06:17:31,960 --> 06:17:33,960
This is the best day for you

3013
06:17:33,960 --> 06:17:35,960
You don't have to love me

3014
06:17:35,960 --> 06:17:37,960
Can't you see I'm going to love you

3015
06:17:37,960 --> 06:17:39,960
This is the best day for you

3016
06:17:39,960 --> 06:17:41,960
I can't take it no more

3017
06:17:41,960 --> 06:17:44,960
I don't care what I do

3018
06:18:11,960 --> 06:18:12,960
Who are you?

3019
06:18:12,960 --> 06:18:13,960
Who are you?

3020
06:18:13,960 --> 06:18:14,960
Who are you?

3021
06:18:14,960 --> 06:18:17,960
I'm running out of time, where are you?

3022
06:20:44,960 --> 06:20:56,960
So I can't ignore the fact, no more your yammy when we're mad

3023
06:20:56,960 --> 06:21:03,960
You've made up my mind, now I may find emotion still with me

3024
06:21:03,960 --> 06:21:09,960
But I'm still your step, I feel like I can't stop the pain

3025
06:21:09,960 --> 06:21:14,960
I would never have to leave your name away

3026
06:21:14,960 --> 06:21:16,960
I'm meant to lose you now

3027
06:21:16,960 --> 06:21:18,960
Don't even lie

3028
06:21:18,960 --> 06:21:22,960
I can't forgive if I say

3029
06:21:22,960 --> 06:21:24,960
Now that I've let me down

3030
06:21:24,960 --> 06:21:26,960
I'm not gonna say

3031
06:21:26,960 --> 06:21:28,960
No, I'm just not gonna say

3032
06:21:28,960 --> 06:21:35,960
I can't forgive if I say

3033
06:22:35,960 --> 06:22:46,960
Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah

3034
06:22:46,960 --> 06:22:53,960
Mina hakum koto hai te hajima Mina hakum koto te rejima

3035
06:23:53,960 --> 06:23:55,960
I get a late night urge to ramble

3036
06:23:55,960 --> 06:23:57,960
I got my car all set to ramble

3037
06:23:57,960 --> 06:24:00,960
Don't really know where I'm from so

3038
06:24:01,960 --> 06:24:03,960
I put my foot down on the pedal

3039
06:24:03,960 --> 06:24:05,960
I got the pedal to the metal

3040
06:24:05,960 --> 06:24:09,960
I roll down the highway just like a fireball

3041
06:24:09,960 --> 06:24:13,960
I'm like the stairs on top of a fireball burning out of gold

3042
06:24:13,960 --> 06:24:18,960
Get those potatoes on fire over the sky like I can move
