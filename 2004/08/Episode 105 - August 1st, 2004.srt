00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,520
Bemani, and then some. Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, so you probably

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,000
shouldn't let your children listen. If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Tracked, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.

Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, that's right. The only thing you're going to be riding is me.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000

Please, there are ladies present.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,500

Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,200
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,800
You know her better as the angsty dark staphora.

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,560
Is your mic on over there, honey?

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
There you are.

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Okay.

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
I'm powered by meat and asparagus right now.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Meat and potatoes.

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Meat and asparagus.

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Yeah, meat and asparagus.

45
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Potatoes are evil.

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,640
evil! are you on a low carb diet? yes I am. low carb diets are the antichrist you know

47
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,320
why they are the antichrist? okay first of all I'm doing this to be supportive I know

48
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,560
but second of all you know how hard I have worked my ass off so don't yes I know but

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,880
they're the antichrist for me because anything that says that I can't have bread and potatoes

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,000
is the antichrist. you can still have bread and potatoes just not all the time. but I

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,680
I want potatoes all the time.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,240
Don't take my potatoes away.

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,740
Rob.

54
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,240

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,740
Rob.

56
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,240
What?

57
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,740
Rob.

58
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,240
What?

59
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,740

60
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,240

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,480
I couldn't do it.

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,640
I tried that last week with Matt, and it just didn't work.

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,200
Did you just beat you up?

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,040
I was like, you have to have a single syllable that starts

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,520
with an R for that to work.

67
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,640

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
well i was here i was here too

183
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,160
i'll get a show to go

184
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,180
i was here sunday that i flew out monday

185
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,200
and i can tell you as i went out of the mother now i went to a little place in

186
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,400
pennsylvania

187
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,660
called allentown

188
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,400
and there's really not a whole lot there

189
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,700
i guess there is like arcades and stuff but i was so consumed with my work that

190
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,340
honestly had no time to go out and look

191
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,100
for arcades because I kind of had other things to do so if I did play games it

192
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:47,860
was on my Gameboy Advance I ended up buying Sword of Mana which eh it's okay I

193
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,820
was I was a little bit disappointed because Secret of Mana is like one of

194
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,700
the best games ever and then Sword of Mana being kind of eh is a little

195
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,420
disappointing but then I also bought Mario vs. Donkey Kong which was you know

196
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,180
it's corny it's what you'd expect one thing I would like to say to Panda I

197
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,700
i don't think he had a choice

198
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,300

199
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,420

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,800
we're playing a little bit of how was your week

208
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,240
how was your day and Jamie you've got the other mic so why don't you have a

209
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,320
mouth full of beef

210
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,440
that's good, beef is good for you

211
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,200
do you like having meat in your mouth? or meat?

212
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,280
it's juicy

213
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,200
sorry I had to slow that down

214
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,640
you should suck out the flavor a little bit before you bite down on it

215
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,880
I'll just take the whole thing

216
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,120
um my week sucked, it was hot

217
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
I don't have AC in my car.

218
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Busy as hell at work.

219
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
And it's going to get busier.

220
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,120
I finally got the stupid financial aid notice from ARC,

221
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
and you know what I have to say?

222
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
I have to say that I'm actually very surprised.

223
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I was awarded my federal loans,

224
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
which means I won't have any interest on them.

225
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
So that makes me happy.

226
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Good deal.

227
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
I'm getting, I don't want to say anything.

228
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,120
I'm getting, because I'm a sophomore, I'll get $3,500.

229
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,120
And I don't mind saying so because it's like damn near what everybody gets

230
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,660
if you're a sophomore, so it doesn't matter.

231
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,860
That means I get my laptop in two weeks.

232
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,620
In two weeks, I will be sitting here with a shiny Fujitsu on my lap.

233
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,860
I want a laptop.

234
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,880
Especially after that trip, I need a laptop. They're expensive, I can't afford them.

235
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,780
Go to school.

236
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,720
I need to buy a used one.

237
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,800
I only want one that will let me on the internet. I don't need any, like,

238
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,560
I know I'm actually thinking about getting a Mac laptop. Isn't that scary?

239
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,880
could give me bad looks stop it all you

240
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,080
yeah start with the xbox tonight

241
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,840
let me tell you today

242
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,000
what kind of memory coming out of your week i was your day

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,240
and i ended up going to see on friday and could not let my friends of moving

244
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,800
back to utah

245
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,180
uh... we ended up going to see uh... the village that night

246
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:24,180
and i don't care anybody says that maybe was awesome

247
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,940
I

248
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:32,640
Like the whole premise behind it. I love the setting. I like how everybody talks in that movie

249
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,020
Everybody just talks like I just like it. I liked it

250
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,580
I'm not gonna give away anything because of course it's one of those, you know twisty movies, but I'm not gonna

251
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,340
Say anything about it. I just really like I loved the whole color theme

252
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,960
I like this the way this guy directs and the movies are slow

253
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,640
But all the pacing makes sense at the end of the movie, so I thought it was really well

254
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
done.

255
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,760
Two snaps up from Jamie?

256
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,400
It gets the artsy award from me.

257
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,920
And what did I do yesterday?

258
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:14,880
Yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl all day, and we, over the cat, her cat passed

259
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
away.

260
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,840
Yeah, I'm sad, but I hung out all day.

261
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,480
We went to this place called Bradshaw's for lunch.

262
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Sort of like Brookfield's.

263
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Oh!

264
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
I think it's like the same place.

265
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
But it's not Bradshaw's.

266
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
But it's not Bradshaw's.

267
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Interesting.

268
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
I've never...

269
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
I actually thought of Brookfield's.

270
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
They had low-carb cheesecake.

271
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Huh.

272
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,760
And it was actually pretty good texture-wise, and the crust was good.

273
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,280
It had this taste after it, so...

274
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
I'm going to say that...

275
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Great taste, less filling?

276
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
It had...

277
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,000
It was actually filling without the great taste.

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, I see.

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,880
It was okay.

280
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,440
And then I spent the whole rest of the night online.

281
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,560
And then today I got up bright and early, read my errands, got myself my comics today,

282
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:07,080
read them all, devoured them, bought a Dragon Ash CD, because I love Dragon Ash, and a bumper

283
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,880
sticker is the best one ever.

284
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,560
It says, stop whining and plot revenge.

285
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,120
Is that not me or what?

286
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,520
That's pretty you.

287
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,520
And that's me. My week.

288
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Alrighty.

289
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Sakurama.

290
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Let's go to, uh, let's go over here. Let's talk to our resident papa music whore.

291
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Resident papa music hookah.

292
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,520
What have you done? How was your day? How was your week? We haven't seen you in a while.

293
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Yeah.

294
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Jamie saw a real whore?

295
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Jamie said she saw a real whore. Like, as opposed to a fake one.

296
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Well, you know what? I know a deaf whore, so I win. I know one.

297
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Did you sleep with one, though?

298
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,520
So, I was at a 7-11 and this heroin whore came in. She had band-aids on her inner thigh.

299
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Yeah, she was a whore. She was a real whore. Of course, we were right next to the Regency Triple X Theater.

300
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Well, there you go.

301
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
There's a Triple X Theater around here.

302
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
How long have you lived in Sacramento?

303
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,520
The Triple X Theater was right across from where I used to work, and the guys in the collections department would leave during their lunch break and go over there and watch porn.

304
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Wait a minute, Logie. How many years have you lived in Sacramento?

305
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Uh, a lot.

306
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,520
And you just now learned that there is a place over on Watt that shows Triple X films all day, all night?

307
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
No, I didn't know that.

308
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,520
You know what's funny? When the whole April Fool's thing was going on DDR Freak,

309
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,520
and we had the thread there listing our address and contact information.

310
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Right.

311
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,520
My address on there was the address for the Regency Triple X Theater.

312
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,520
You know there's some news about DDR Freak forums today.

313
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,700
Are there yeah, you guys made us something awful dot-coms make fun of lists today or whatever they call it

314
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Okay, it's not my page

315
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,140
Yeah, there were no posts from you in there. So you're okay. Okay me

316
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,860
Okay, sorry

317
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,100
Sorry Garrett. Well, that's all right. Um, well last week was kind of slow

318
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,820
But I made the best of it. My parents were out on vacation and I only got 24 hours at work

319
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
so I had four days off and

320
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:16,100
And only managed to go crazy on two days, and the rest I filled with stuff.

321
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,780
And I had a pretty good time on most of the days.

322
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,380
I met someone new that I'm interested in, and then I found out the bad news

323
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,420
that I was hoping to find out sooner than later.

324
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,900
And hopefully it won't totally fuck everything up, but we'll see.

325
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,500
I just have to stop being obsessive and something.

326
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,580
And then I had my party on Friday, and that was really fun.

327
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,220
And I got really, really, really wasted.

328
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,760
I have never been drunk, really, before,

329
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,300
now that I was that drunk.

330
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,900
And I go, wow, OK, this is drunk.

331
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,740
Which Orange Lounge regulars showed up to the party?

332
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,940
There was Brad, Irene, Matt, and Anita,

333
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,100
and then Janae and James, the guy I met.

334
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,060
Oh, OK.

335
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,380
Yeah.

336
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,180
And that was it.

337
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,900
We had fun.

338
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,840
And people that didn't, I don't think Brad and Irene took off

339
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,480
like, all them pretty much left around like 3.30 or so in the morning, so that was late

340
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,220
for one of my parties, usually everyone going like, well I need to go home now, la la la.

341
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,160
So that was kind of nice to have people. But yeah, I know I was so drunk that, you know,

342
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,420
keep in mind, chatters, I'm kind of new to alcohol, so I don't know all these things.

343
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,340
I am naive. Most of our chatters can't even buy alcohol, so... Doesn't mean they can't

344
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:42,820
get it who says anything not buying not that we would condone that but of course not but

345
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:49,300
yeah no my drive my my fingers my fingers were about 25% numb and at that time i decided

346
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,860
we needed to play drunk 2dx and pop music and i'm i still managed to beat murmur twins

347
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,780
drunk and i think i'd be i think i got as high as like a 31 on pop music but then i

348
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,580
I tried a 39 right after that and I just stopped, so I don't know, I probably didn't hire.

349
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,540
It reminds me of the time I played DDR in Vegas, and I was drunk, really really drunk,

350
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,340
and I got like a huge crowd around me while I was playing though, it was cool.

351
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,900
Cool, and then, now I am, like as of yesterday, I am officially on vacation for this whole

352
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,020
week and I'm still trying to remember that I'm on vacation.

353
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,980
Wait a minute, weren't you just on vacation like two months ago?

354
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,320
Yeah.

355
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,840
You're always on vacation.

356
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,100
I only get two weeks a year.

357
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:36,800
I'm I just decided to take it now because okay yeah well I mean you know

358
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,520
my vacation we usually don't get to pick our vacation until shit I didn't get to

359
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,360
pick mine until like after March I don't think and then we have to use it before

360
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,000
November there's it's weird the way it works all right but yeah I took it I

361
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,320
took it now I'm on vacation and I hope I find something good to do this week and

362
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,240
Oh yeah, and then I got all those wonderful CDs and I spent way too much money on my newfound

363
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,800
collections that I got in the mail all week, and then yesterday my sister was a bitch when

364
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,920
my CDs came, because I had to go take Janae to work, and then I come back and I see the

365
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,360
mailman on one part of our street, but his car is pointing in the direction like he would

366
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,040
have had to pass mine, and I'm all, oh, I wonder, because I haven't checked my tracking

367
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
number.

368
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,800
I go home, check my tracking number, it says, your item arrived in Sacramento at 5.30 am

369
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,640
today. I'm like, wait a minute, that means he would have come to my house already if

370
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,520
this car's pointing that direction. So I'm all, hey Shannon, did the mailman come? She's

371
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,000
all, yeah, but I didn't have any clothes on, so I didn't go get it. And she's upstairs

372
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,440
laying in my parents' room, naked in all of my comforters and blankets that I'd left in

373
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,360
there from when I was sleeping in there in the week, because she was gone camping with

374
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,520
my parents. I'm all, you bitch. And then so I go running outside and I'm going to go hunt

375
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,600
for the mailman on my neighborhood, because I hate waiting for it another day or going

376
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,400
to the post office. And then I get in my car, and then all of a sudden he's on the other

377
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,880
side of my street. So I get back out of my car, I run across the street, and then I see

378
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
him...

379
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Chasing the mailman.

380
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,480
Chasing the mailman for some CDs.

381
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Yeah, I see him like at least three or four times a month. And it's always him. And then

382
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,520
he just... I'm listening up to him, and he's looking at me like, why is he coming towards

383
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,520
me and you know like there's any other reason he knows who the fuck I am and then I'm all

384
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,900
hey you know my sister said you know I haven't come yet I'm all is uh oh no I have okay yeah

385
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:42,280
and then he gives me my thing so yeah I got yeah I got stuff all right right on yeah I

386
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,900
think I'm sorry anything else for your week of your day um well no I just wanted to say

387
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:55,220
I don't remember what I was going to say. The Jafro Sax album, the Jafro Sax remix album

388
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:01,840
I got was fucking horrible. I bought his first album randomly because I saw it on Konami

389
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,080
style. I'm like, I don't know what Bomani Artiset is. I can't figure it out. I couldn't

390
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,800
figure it out. And I'm like, why are they promoting him? Oh, well, I'll just buy it.

391
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,180
And it ended up being a fabulous album. But he just released a remix album. And it was

392
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,260
so bad that I was trying to just listen to it while I was kind of napping, but I wasn't

393
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,700
really sleepy, I was just laying on my bed. I listened to about half the album while I

394
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,620
was on my bed, and then I went to my computer, turned it off, and continued to go back to

395
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,940
bed. Did you ever figure out what his connection to Bamani was? No, I still haven't. Sana did

396
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,940
one song with him. On this remix album, was it Hiroshi Watanabe, did a remix, and that

397
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,740
was a Bamani artist, for like 5K a long time ago. I have no idea who he is still. But yeah,

398
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,740
his music's awesome, except no one can remix it good. I guess that's enough from me.

399
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,740
Alrighty. Bug, anything you want to share? Your week and your day?

400
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,740
My day has been trying to get my damn computer to boot again. My motherboard died about a

401
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,980
month ago, and somebody gave me a spare motherboard and I had to go buy new RAM, since my old RAM

402
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,140
was not compatible with this new fangled technology.

403
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,740
Dope. Yeah, it's all DDR RAM too, so everyone...

404
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,480
So, that was my day, my week, putting stuff in the warehouse, taking stuff out of the

405
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
warehouse, putting it on trucks.

406
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
That's...

407
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Fun job.

408
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
Yeah.

409
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,200
Hey, they paid me to do it, so I got to.

410
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
There you go.

411
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
All right.

412
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
That's it?

413
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,640
I just need an ethernet drop and I'll be happy.

414
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
All right.

415
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,400
Oh, do you need to plug into our network?

416
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
At some point.

417
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
All right.

418
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,640
We'll get you into the Orange Launch Network here.

419
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Yeah, it's over there.

420
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
I'm over here.

421
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
All right.

422
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Loki!

423
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
I'm a lazy bastard.

424
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
How was your day?

425
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
How was your week?

426
00:25:40,640 --> 00:26:09,640
um, well, ah, let's see, this week I didn't do much, I played a lot of games on my main cabinet, because I have to get the money's worth out of it. So, by the way, I figure it, I will have to play until I die on this cabinet to get the money's worth. Um, anyways, so, I went down, um, what was it, yesterday, we were looking for stuff to do, so we went down to Golf Land to go play miniature golf.

427
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,920
that's when we discovered guess what now they have night was it night swims or

428
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,720
whatever night with it's basically water slides in the dark so they have

429
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,560
that there now so there's a ton of fucking people lion was like zigzagging

430
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,080
just to get into golf I'm off fuck this I'm leaving so but at least I got they'll

431
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,680
see what condition everything was and the fourth mix or extreme to cabinet not

432
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,880
working still, and you know what? Don't care. Um, Drummania seemed to be okay, and Guitar

433
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,080
Freaks was okay, I guess. And then, um, then we decided to go see the village, and the

434
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,240
village was okay. Um, but I already knew what the plot twist was about halfway through the

435
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,320
film anyways, so, whatever. And, um, so that was alright. Um, but, you know what movie's

436
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,720
gonna rock, okay, is his next movie. Okay? It's gonna be the sixth sign of the Unbreakable

437
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Village. Look for that in theaters, 2006. It's gonna rock. It's gonna combine everything

438
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,400
that was awesome about, it's gonna be a village of super-humans that can see dead aliens.

439
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:31,920
It's gonna rock. You used to be funny. What happened? You left. So anyways, it's funny

440
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,200
that you should mention a crack whore, Jamie, because I did see one earlier today. Whatever,

441
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,460
it's the same shit. I mean, I guess it's okay. Maybe she didn't have a bloody nose and she

442
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,980
she just had less track lines or whatever. But, whatever. It's still, the stupid bitch,

443
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,100
I'll get into it later, I guess, than the FUs. But anyways, some stupid bitch tried

444
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,540
to cut me off and I flipped her off and that was fun. What else? Oh, and then today I went

445
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,140
and saw Harry Kibar go to White Castle and that was awesome. I guess I would have had

446
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,420
them in stone to find it extremely funny, but it was relatively funny. And, oh, yeah,

447
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,140
and then the rest of the week was pretty much just playing porno games on MAME. Pretty much

448
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,140
I have a whole, you know, folder here, category of porno games.

449
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,140
And what is your favorite adult-oriented arcade game that you've come across?

450
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Oh, of course, this was before I even got MAME, Gals Panic. It rocks.

451
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,140
I'm awesome at Gals Panic.

452
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:33,140
Um, but then I was playing, um, I beat the, uh, stupid, uh, what is it, the poker gals or whatever.

453
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:40,140
It's stupid. It's kind of disturbing watching them masturbate with, like, a disattached hand and arm.

454
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,140
It's just like they're taking a mannequin hand and shoving up their, you know, pussy. It's kind of weird.

455
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:49,140
Oh, and that reminds me, there was this, um, movie that they, um, what was it, it's like a...

456
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
I think it's like a Dirty Shame is what it's called.

457
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,140
And somebody, the same guy, did Hairspray.

458
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,140
It's with Johnny Knoxville. It's rated NC-17.

459
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Wait, wait, wait.

460
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,140
You mean John Waters?

461
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
Uh, maybe.

462
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,140
Yeah.

463
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,140
It's about fucking time John Waters came out with a new movie. It better be good, though.

464
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,340
better be good though, because like his movies, like ever since Serial Mom, like Serial Mom

465
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,960
was the shit, and then like, what was after that, was umm...

466
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,740
no, no no, after that was, was Cecil B. DeMannet was one. I thought there was one in between

467
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,020
though, I might be, I might be losing, but like Cecil B. DeMannet was like, kinda like,

468
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:29,240
eh, is just eh. Oh, Pecker, I was in between there too, Pecker was kinda eh, and then like,

469
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,280
Cecil B. DeMannet was even more eh, so he needs to, you know, come back up, like Pink

470
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,580
flamingos too man telling you even if Divine's dead I don't care anyways it's

471
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,940
about these a bunch of perverts to go into this one town and then everyone

472
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,140
starts getting perverted and having sex with one another and stuff like that but

473
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,140
there's like one specific scene that I remember where this lady is like doing

474
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,020
like some sort of dance or hokey-pokey type thing and she's staring at this

475
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,640
like one doctor there I guess like these people are getting injured in the head

476
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,300
or something like that they turn all horny same way she ends up setting down

477
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,700
a water bottle and squatting over it and shoving it up her cooch so that was that was interesting

478
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,060
yes I'm looking at a internet internet movie database right now it is a dirty shame is

479
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,460
done by John Waters which means I will have to see it even if I fucking hate Johnny Knoxville

480
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,420
I will have to see this movie I'll watch it with you see that now did you see what it

481
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:32,140
was it was basically it's when a bunch of head injuries are causing people to become

482
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:41,660
sex addicts. So, I think that's pretty funny. So, can't wait. I like that. What was it?

483
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:47,980
Wes Johnson, fat fuck Frank. This is all I care about. Is Mink Stole in it? Because Mink

484
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,060
Stole is the greatest actress of all time. I don't care what you say. And she is in it

485
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,260
as she has been in all of John Waters other movies. Anyway, the video game nerds out there

486
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,060
have no idea what I'm talking about right now, so I'm just gonna let it go. So anyways,

487
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:07,140
I saw that, that looked pretty sweet. Other than that, not really much happening, just

488
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,940
a little bit of Final Fantasy, not that much at all, and just, you know, working on my

489
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:22,940
cabinet. That's pretty much it, yeah. Anyways, how about your week in a, or your weeks? Yeah,

490
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,780
I was gone for a couple weeks in Pennsylvania, and to be honest, really not a whole lot of

491
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,420
exciting stuff went down. I did get a chance to have one of my friends visit

492
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,980
me over the weekend because she lives out on the East Coast. She's somebody I

493
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,300
knew from college and we went out to New York City. We kind of drove around some

494
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,340
areas around there. We found ourselves on Long Island eventually and we went to

495
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,980
Fire Island which is this big gay haven out on the East Coast for those that

496
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,820
don't know. But I don't know what possessed us to go there but we were

497
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,100
just like, oh let's go to Fire Island. So we did and it was it was like a giant

498
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:18,980
The next day we went to the Crayola factories.

499
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:44,980
That was pretty much it, honestly. I mean, I haven't been playing any video games except for what I was talking about earlier on Gameboy Advance.

500
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,500
There's only so many times I can beat Metroid Zero before I'm like,

501
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,180
Jesus Christ, I need a new game. So, that was it. But then coming home was very interesting

502
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,380
because the house, like coming back into the apartment

503
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,660
at four o'clock in the morning, because bugs picked me up at the airport. After, by the way,

504
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,060
my airplane in Philadelphia sat on the runway for an hour

505
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,620
and so finally it comes back and it sits and we get to Vegas. And I was only supposed to have an

506
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,860
hour layover in Vegas. Well, now I have five minutes to get to my other plane.

507
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,940
So I ran from one end of the Vegas airport to the other end

508
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,940
and it was like being on The Amazing Race, I swear it was

509
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,740
it was interesting. But I just barely made my plane to Sacramento and

510
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,700
all was well. And then Bug picked me up at the airport here in Sacramento and then we

511
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,280
went out

512
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,540
we ended up meeting Evan for

513
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,780
a late night snack somewhere because I realized

514
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,060
yeah I realized at that point that I hadn't eaten in the past

515
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,380
day so I had to eat. So then we went there and ate and then that was it. Then I was like so

516
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,220
dead tired I was like falling asleep at dinner and I was just like I'm tired I

517
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,980
need to go so I came here and then when I open the door and I walk in I'm like

518
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:56,100
holy fucking shit when did Loki finish his cabinet because our TV is gone and

519
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,180
it's inside the cabinet and then like the whole room has been turned around

520
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,700
90 degrees or at least it feels that way and then like there's just all this

521
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,640
stuff that used to be over here like piled up in piles on the side of the

522
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,260
room but I thought it was cool and then Loki was showing his cabinet to me

523
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:18,700
yesterday and I was playing miss world nude 96 which is my favorite adult game

524
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:23,600
because when it turns from the the girl like if you do yeah well I'll have to

525
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,600
play it for you guys later but when you do badly on it like it's like kicks

526
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,080
right you remember the old school game kicks where you draw the lines right and

527
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,880
you yeah and you try to dodge the little thing that's lying around that's a miss

528
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,500
world 96 like but you're cutting out a picture of a naked lady and that's it's

529
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,800
like the game on the mega touch the adult game I don't know if you guys

530
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,320
ever play mega touch there's one like it on there too so they have this but if

531
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,480
you I don't know if you uncover certain bad parts of the picture then your bar

532
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,520
goes down and if you fall into the bad like the picture of the girl turns into

533
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,440
the picture of like the devil and like it starts playing this eurobeat song

534
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,240
that totally doesn't match it goes like everybody move your body I'm gonna play

535
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,640
it for you guys later because I think it's just that cool I'm gonna have to do

536
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,440
that after the break. I'm sorry, yes, Jamie. You want to share something with our listeners?

537
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,560
Get Jamie a mic here. Not that I'm meaning to interrupt, but Time

538
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,760
Magazine is encouraging people to download movies off the internet.

539
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,640
Like what? I'm reading this article about how a lot of

540
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,720
the horror movies from Japan are being remade for the US.

541
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,520
Like the original director for The Ring is doing Ring 2 over here.

542
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
The Grudge is a Japanese movie game.

543
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Right, Juon was the name.

544
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
But, um, saying that,

545
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
it says, why wait for remakes?

546
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
All of these movies are available online.

547
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,520
They meant through Amazon.com, or your favorite online retailer, sure, yeah.

548
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Alright, yes, Logie?

549
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,520
I heard that the new, um, Keshan movie is available on,

550
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,520
actually I have it marked on Supernova, a cam of it, though.

551
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:08,240
still cam that's subtitled in English good enough for me speaking of all this

552
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,720
Japanese culture stuff hitting the u.s. so Loki and I had the pleasure of going

553
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,360
to a small little convention quote-unquote I don't know what you got it

554
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,560
wasn't it quite a convention it was a fair like a fair with an E on it like a

555
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,880
Renaissance fair but it was a anime fair that they had at the mall and the mall

556
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,220
here in Sacramento, which consisted of four vendor booths scattered throughout the mall,

557
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,320
and then in what used to be McDonald's, they had a viewing room where they were showing

558
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,460
crappy anime all day, and I guess they were going to show live action Sailor Moon at some

559
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,600
point. Yeah, Sunrise Mall. Yeah, the McDonald's closed the Sunrise Mall about three years

560
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:53,440
ago. Not quite three years ago, a couple months ago. All right. But still, it's closed, and

561
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,020
They were showing anime in there now, and the only cool thing they were going to show

562
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,560
was today, but I'm not much of an anime geek, I mean maybe there was some good stuff in

563
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,480
there and I just don't recognize it, but they were going to show live action Sailor Moon

564
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
today.

565
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
And that would have been cool.

566
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,640
But anyway, like the vendor booths were not too thrilling, but they were like, it was

567
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,300
really cool to go to the mall and see like all the soccer moms and the brats, and then

568
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,240
like all these cosplayers.

569
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,060
Like there were like tons of people cosplaying as all these anime characters.

570
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:25,160
Not that, not that there were many good cosplayers, but there were, you know, a lot of cosplayers.

571
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:32,060
No offensive cosplayers out there, but why do the majority, not all of them, but do the

572
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:37,420
great majority of them, have to be really nasty, ugly, fat chicks? Honestly. I mean,

573
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,460
I saw some really, it's like, oh my god, when did that character put on a hundred pounds?

574
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:52,060
it's like a blob has sucked her soul. It was really nasty. I only think that stuff is bad

575
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:58,460
like when they're cosplaying like it's Mai, or Chun-Li, or somebody really, you know,

576
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:07,420
promiscuous. Then there was like that chick who was next to me, who I thought was a guy,

577
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,180
Okay, she looked like a dude, and she opens her mouth,

578
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,420
yeah, how much for this?

579
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,180
Well, oh my God, ugly, and I started pointing.

580
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:24,660
Oh, yeah, I was just disappointed

581
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,180
because usually at those kind of, even an anime expo,

582
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,940
it doesn't matter, like I'm not that into anime,

583
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,420
like I have an appreciation for some of it,

584
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,740
like, you know, the big mainstream stuff,

585
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,300
like Miyazaki and stuff, but like,

586
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,120
usually at most anime conventions you have your video game corner, right? Or you have

587
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,880
your video game vendor or something video game related. I was hoping to see that there.

588
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,460
Nope, not a damn thing. The only thing video game related I could find that was interesting

589
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,700
was the Final Fantasy XI wall scroll, but it was just the generic stock art of the same

590
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,740
thing that's on the cover of Final Fantasy XI. It's the same art I've seen over and over

591
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,660
and I have in like a million different places anyway, and I didn't want to spend $15 on

592
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:08,880
wall scroll that looked like it was just a bad Xerox copy anyway so that was our

593
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,980
experience at the convention quote unquote I think we spent a total of 20

594
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,420
minutes that and then we went to TGI Fridays and spent like two hours there

595
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,300
so it was good I actually went there to meet one of my friends from out of town

596
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,060
so that was my excuse for going but I'm actually surprised you didn't go Jamie

597
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,580
Just to check it out or you heard about it or anything because that was the one they were promoting over at a1 comics

598
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,140
Which oh, I didn't think it was at this one. Do we have the little flyer here? There's oh, I remember the flyer

599
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,400
I'm here. I think my fire away into the air. I

600
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,420
Had other things to do like

601
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
laundry

602
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
Well Saturday, right

603
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:56,620
It was Saturday and Sunday and today it's still going on right now doing things. I remember I had to be I was over at

604
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:15,620
I feel sorry for anybody that was coming from, like, according to this, you know, they've given directions from Reno or South Lake Tahoe. But again, what anime do they ever do in Reno or South Lake Tahoe? Do they ever have festivals like this up there? I highly doubt that.

605
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,580
comic shop you'll see more anime than there was at this place. Classic Gaming Expo was

606
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,620
in Vegas, but... Classic Gaming Expo's in San Jose this year and I really want to go.

607
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,100
Is it this month? It's like next weekend, isn't it? I don't know. I'm gonna check that

608
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,580
out right now. Well crap, if it's next weekend then I'm going to the Ren Faire. I don't have

609
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,860
plans to go to the Bay Area next weekend. Next weekend I'm going to the Ren Faire. Next

610
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,180
Saturday. I'm going to the Bay Area to visit people next weekend. Wait, I have to find

611
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:45,060
out now when Classic Gaming Expo is because I have to go. Classic Gaming Expo, for those

612
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,240
who don't know is supposed to be like the most tremendously awesome, neat, old school

613
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,540
thing. Oh no, it's at the end of the month. 21st and 22nd. No I'm not, because I don't

614
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,020
leave until September, motherfucker. Well, I think I can skip my introduction to Windows

615
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:05,140
class that day. Okay, I have no time to go test out of this. This is sort of an F-you,

616
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,020
but not really. Because I'm going to try to make this an easy A to establish a good GPA.

617
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,780
ooh, Jamie, SNK just joined as a sponsor of Classic Gaming Expo.

618
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,900
Ooh! SNK, we're out of business dot com.

619
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,700
We no longer support the Neo Geo, the last game is dead.

620
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,780
And, uh, Konami's gonna have an exhibit.

621
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,820
Yeah, they're gonna do

622
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,200
Castlevania, I hope.

623
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,380
Oh, right on. Oh, I have to go to this. I'm so going to this.

624
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,540
Maybe, maybe we can head to San Jose after my class.

625
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,040
Yeah.

626
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,240
I get out of my class at four.

627
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,740
We'll have to find out, like, what time everything's at, so...

628
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,640
Maybe we could broadcast from Classic Gaming Expo.

629
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,340
Yeah, maybe we should, like, email him or something,

630
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
and figure out something we can do to promote stuff,

631
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,540
even though we don't really do a whole lot of classic gaming,

632
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,440
except for, you know, uh...

633
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
I cl- I...

634
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,240
You talk about it on your spin-off show.

635
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,440
Which, by the way, there's news about some of our spin-off shows.

636
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,240
Yes.

637
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Because I'm starting school in two weeks.

638
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,840
Um, starting this Tuesday,

639
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,440
Pump of the Volume is moving back to Tuesday,

640
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Okay, so we can use the old promo again.

641
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
Right on, okay.

642
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:19,440
And I'm going to be especially stressed and drained and angsty and full of ire.

643
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,440
So you can hear me just bitch and bitch and bitch about everything and play some really awesome music.

644
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,440
I'm going to kick it off with an 80's marathon this Tuesday.

645
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,440
And quite possibly the weekend after is going to be me just playing random CDs that I happen to have lying around my computer.

646
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Okay, right on.

647
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,280
Which right now consists of Monty Python, Taku, and, uh, um, the DragonEye CD I just

648
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
bought.

649
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,480
Okay, you know, somebody in the, um, chatroom just brought up a very good point.

650
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,600
Um, somebody in the chatroom brought up a very good point that as far as us promoting

651
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,740
classic gaming, uh, we talk about BurgerTime, or at least I do, and I promote, I do a lot

652
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,880
of promotion for BurgerTime, which I believe to be the greatest 80s video game.

653
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Tappan.

654
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
What?

655
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
Tappan.

656
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
Tappan?

657
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:17,760
We have a lot of good classic gaming stuff to talk about on here.

658
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,640
And Tubin.

659
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,060
And Super Sprint.

660
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,060
And uhh.

661
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,060
Alright.

662
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,800
So we're going to look into what we can do about Classic Gaming as well.

663
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,960
Okay I think we're going to take a break and when we come back we actually have Bimani

664
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,080
stuff we want to talk about believe it or not.

665
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,240
And of course the cage match, you have to use the week, all that fun stuff very soon.

666
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,200
In the meantime, we're going to play you guys some new music from Pop and Music 11.

667
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,320
And our resident pop and music chorus here to tell us all about the songs we're going

668
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,760
to hear today.

669
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
So what did you pick out for us?

670
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,120
Okay, well, I put on, he said three songs, so I picked songs that were not hosted on

671
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
the Mani style.

672
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,600
So they're songs you may not have heard, so that's why I started with this.

673
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:08,460
The first one is, the genre is Nebuta, but the song is actually called Karasu instead

674
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
of Tori.

675
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,880
I actually got really curious when the song was reading the info on the page at the official

676
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,980
site, and it's supposed to mean crows, not birds, generically like that, because it just

677
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,660
has a kanji for bird, and most people would read it as Tori.

678
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,660
So there's that.

679
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:30,820
I also put on the remix for Yokan Ko, the Desu Rege song from 7, which I actually like

680
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,180
even though it's really minimal.

681
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:40,260
And then there's another song called, what was that, Tozancha Tachi, and it sounds kind

682
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,980
of like an anime song to me, but it's actually an original song that the guy from the Parkettes

683
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,980
made.

684
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,980
So, yeah.

685
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,980
Alright, cool deal.

686
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,660
So, this is the premiere of some Pop in 11 music here on Orange Lawn's radio, and thank

687
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,340
Thank you very much for bringing this to us.

688
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,340
You're welcome.

689
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,340
Here we go. We're going to start off with Karasu. Enjoy.

690
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:04,360
queer

691
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:10,900
queer

692
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:17,100
queer

693
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,100
Told you putty

694
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,600
ully

695
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,620
ya

696
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,680
You're welcome

697
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,740
Aaaahhhh!!!

698
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,320
After this song, we'll be having a Let Em Move marathon!

699
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,100
Noooooo!

700
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,520
Just kidding! Orange Lounge radio, crap free Vovanni Radio!

701
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,920
That's right, all crap free, except for this show, which you're tuned into here on this lovely Sunday evening.

702
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,420
As promised, I wanted to walk over to the main cabinet and play this game for you guys.

703
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:32,620
This is called Mr. World 96 Nude, and if you want to see screenshots of this game,

704
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:39,720
head on over to OrangeLawnsRadio.com, because it's playing live right now on our webcam there,

705
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:45,420
and even though it doesn't auto-refresh right now, you have to click reload every 30 seconds or so.

706
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,920
We're working on getting that fixed, at least for next week.

707
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,620
So, also, later in this program, we'll be opening up the Skype line for your comments

708
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,620
over at www.orangewonstrator.com.

709
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,720
Look for our recent news article on Skype, and it'll tell you how to set it up.

710
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,820
Also, in our live journal community, there's a recent post there.

711
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,020
So, we're going to try to get the sound, because I wanted to play the evil song for you guys,

712
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,520
but Loki's still working on sound.

713
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:10,920
Yes.

714
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,720
I'm a host.

715
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,420
Give me my phone.

716
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,420
Yes, Jamie.

717
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,420
I saw... I saw asses.

718
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,420
I see an outline of a penis that looks very lopsided.

719
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,420
I'm sorry, I'm not at home.

720
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,420
There's a really lopsided lump of an outline of a penis on the screen right now.

721
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:31,420
Let's see if you trace around the penis.

722
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:35,420
Like, see, watch. If the little character traces around the penis, then you get to see it.

723
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,420
Oh, some of the ROMs are corrupt, so some of the pictures don't work right.

724
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,420
But it's kind of a fucked up game.

725
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,420
I see more asses.

726
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,760
We're going to see if Loki can get it hooked up.

727
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,980
I'm going to start a game here,

728
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,440
and hopefully we can get the sound over, and Jamie will tell you all what's going on here.

729
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,240
Oops. Rob is playing with the dip switches.

730
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,280
Hold on here.

731
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,300
Okay, the little lion thing looks like a really stupid Pac-Man, but not.

732
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,400
How do I insert coins?

733
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,400
Up at the top, Rob.

734
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
There we go.

735
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
Wait, two-player?

736
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Dang, that sucks.

737
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,400
It's not two-player at the same time, so it kind of sucks.

738
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400
Alright.

739
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,400
Shit, I quit out.

740
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,400
Damn it, I hit the wrong button.

741
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,400
That was horrible, Rob.

742
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,200
I'm very proud of you.

743
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,600
This is wonderful radio right now.

744
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,600
Any luck on the sound?

745
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,600
I'm working on it.

746
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,600
Loki's working on it.

747
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,440
We could do a different topic and then come back to this, I guess.

748
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,880
I now need to announce that I suck at R-Type.

749
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,840
I used to be okay at R-Type. My fiance is like a god at R-Type.

750
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,840
That's like me and DDR, like I used to be really good at DDR, but I honestly have not played DDR in a month, so it just sucks now.

751
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,360
Here, I'm going to play this for the chat room.

752
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,440
So you can hear how bad I suck.

753
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:00,440
Got it? So we hear the sound now?

754
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:07,440
Oh, I'm hearing Jamie's game. Hold on, take the mic away from that for a minute.

755
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,560
This is our type. Can we hear this? Hold on, if I put the coins

756
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:17,560
in and do it. Can I hear it?

757
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:33,880
Can I hear it? No, we don't hear it. Okay, does it work if I hold the mic up here?

758
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:47,160
Okay, we'll hold the mic up there. Here we go. I'm going to try and get to the evil stuff.

759
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:54,160
I'll trace around the penis first.

760
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:01,800
Oops, I died.

761
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,560
See, I got a penis. Look.

762
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:12,560
Okay, now I'm going to try and make it go bad.

763
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,560
I'm trying very hard here to get there.

764
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,560
Go to the techno song! Don't choke up on me on air here!

765
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,560
I died. Again.

766
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,560
You have to do everything at the time you have to get rid of these without getting rid of those.

767
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,560
So don't get rid of... No, don't have to do that.

768
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:53,200
there we go almost shit I died again damn this game

769
00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:08,280
Yeah, here it goes. Here it goes. Aw, shit, it froze up! Fuck! Fuck your cabinet. Fuck

770
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,400
this. Let me do this shit. I gotta do it the right way. You gotta play this game, cause...

771
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:23,360
God dammit, what happened to all my controls? What did you guys do here?

772
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,320
Loki is going to try to get that to work. In the meantime, I'm going to tell you guys

773
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,000
about some general gaming news that's going on out there.

774
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:40,240
Alright, I don't know if you guys heard about this, but WarioWare 2 is going to be coming

775
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,520
out soon, which is kind of exciting for those of us who have video game attention deficit

776
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:51,680
disorder. WarioWare is a great game to have, because you're the only one who'll stare back.

777
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,040
They're going to be coming out with this WarioWare 2, which should be exciting. I know that they're

778
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,280
going to have one on the DS too, and I don't know if this is the DS version, I don't think

779
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,720
it is, but they are going to have that coming out. Also, it's updated on our website, www.orangetownsradio.com.

780
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:12,560
And speaking of the Nintendo DS, Square Enix has been doing, Squeenix, Squeenix as I like

781
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,520
to call him, Squeenix is doing a survey right now for what classic games should they port

782
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,260
over to the Nintendo DS.

783
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,900
And they're looking at possibly doing Final Fantasy IV through VI.

784
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:29,240
Also on the list, Chrono Trigger, Front Mission, Chocobo Dungeon, Romanching Saga, Second Detsetsu.

785
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,720

iran all the way

848
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,420
from terminal a wanted to relate all the way to the other end of terminal b in

849
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:11,280
five minutes before you have to fight for a run

850
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,840
i'm i'm i'm impressed myself

851
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,660
all right so what's up in the las vegas mamani scene

852
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,380
at the last

853
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,420
there's been

854
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,900
the orleans hotel and casino it's got

855
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,980
it's a dancer second move

856
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,260
will occur

857
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,000
bergman

858
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,880
from some clothes

859
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,180
when you're in

860
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,140
no no but it's not a good look at all

861
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,980
it's a new orleans hotel casino

862
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:35,600
and i think it's because you know they have little bits of america all over

863
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,580
vegas

864
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,140
and

865
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,220
that's far away from the stress though

866
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,660
so a lot of people don't know their planet

867
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:47,780
Well, you know, yesterday I went there.

868
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:51,900
I went there yesterday just to, you know, celebrate my twenty-five years.

869
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,460
Oh, happy birthday, by the way, from Orange Launch Radio.

870
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:01,660
I played it for the first time, and it was really hard, because, you know, it only has one judgment.

871
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:07,280
You know, which is cool. I like the DDR, it's like perfect, great, good, and uh...

872
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,320
easy to dance the second move is only a one

873
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,780
which is complicated

874
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,380
interesting what's new about easy to dance the second move is they have

875
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,780
freezes

876
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,040
like freeze sensor and then uh... freeze pad

877
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,160
the koreans love those freeze things i've seen it like in every knock off of

878
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,760
another bumani game they have in korea they have a freeze something like an

879
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,220
easy to dj

880
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,260
but easy to dj rocks it really does

881
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,480
ah i see

882
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,280
yeah and uh...

883
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,680
Circus Circus is not much fun to play, according to the Monty locals here.

884
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,520
Circus Circus is my favorite hotel to stay at though, because it's so fucking cheap.

885
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,720
Yeah.

886
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,520
I stayed there, you know, two...

887
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,000
two Christmases ago.

888
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,160
Why would you...

889
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,520
Oh, I was going to say, why would you stay in a hotel there when you lived there, but it was...

890
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,640
No, before I moved here.

891
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,400
I know, I would stay in a hotel.

892
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,560
Oh, by the way, Loki.

893
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,680
Yeah, Loki.

894
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,320
Yeah. Oh, by the way, Loki.

895
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,760
I suggest you should watch Suicide Club.

896
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,640
What now? Suicide Club. I've seen it!

897
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,600
I haven't. You've seen it already? Yeah, I haven't seen it.

898
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,840
Hahaha, yeah right.

899
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,240
They're doing Blockbuster shelves right now.

900
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,320
You know, it's a Japanese movie about 54 school girls

901
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,600
committing suicide

902
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,960
in a subway station.

903
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,500
Yeah, that's not what the movie is about though.

904
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,720
Well, yeah, it's a mystery of suicide. It's about J-Pop and the evils of it.

905
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,560
It's about the evils of...

906
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,160
Actually, there's a really awesome movie. If anyone's seen Ichi the Killer, they're

907
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:38,960
making Ichi the...

908
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,720
Oh, I've seen that! I've seen Ichi the Killer, actually.

909
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,960
They're making an anime version of Ichi the Killer that's gonna be a prequel to it, I believe.

910
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:52,960
Yeah, I've seen the live version. I haven't read the manga or watched the actual anime OVA of it.

911
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,240
There's also another movie called, I think, Three Monsters that's gonna be coming out.

912
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,600
It's basically, I don't really know what it is, but they have a scene where they cut off

913
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,480
some chick's fingers while she's playing the piano or something like that.

914
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,480
Lovely.

915
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Yeah.

916
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,800
Alright, well we're gonna go ahead and let you go, but thank you for calling in and letting

917
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,520
us know what's going on in your neck of the woods.

918
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,840
Alright, have a good one.

919
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,760
Be careful, watch that, each of the killer in moderation there.

920
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,760
Be careful there.

921
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,760
Alright.

922
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,080
Alright, Skypline's opened up, we'll take another call if somebody wants to call in.

923
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:29,080
Pick up the phone!

924
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:34,080
I hate it because I have all these...

925
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:39,080
I know I'm going to mess up the pronunciation.

926
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:44,080
I have no idea how to play it and I have all these porno games of it.

927
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:49,080
He has to match the tiles.

928
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,080
Yeah.

929
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,880
No, that's, but the mahjong is also like, it's almost like a card game.

930
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,880
Like the, the solitaire one is like that.

931
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,880
The basic thing is that you have to match the tiles a certain way.

932
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,880
Yeah.

933
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,160
And clear out the, um, the, uh, panels.

934
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,680
That mahjong is kinda hard though.

935
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,880
Yeah, it is.

936
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,480
If you, if you want, Dan's got seven DVDs of games.

937
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,440
If you want to go through them, I'll try to grab them for you.

938
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,440
Oh yeah, I saw that website.

939
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,440
I mean, he's already, no, he got them from somebody else.

940
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:25,440
There's a 9 gig, uh, that, that you can get. Ah! There's a mic in my face. Well, don't talk in this house without a microphone during the show.

941
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:34,440
Well, anyways, I was gonna say, I had a, there was a 9 gigs, um, zip that I was trying to download. That was before we fixed our cable problem.

942
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:40,440
And, um, so it wasn't downloading quite. It was telling me I had, like, you know, 4,000 hours left, and I was like, fuck this.

943
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,440
You also need to get this Sailor Moon Final Fight game.

944
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,440
Sailor Moon Final Fight. Let's see if we can find that.

945
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,440
It's kind of fun. It's cheese ball.

946
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:55,440
I also have a personal request because I noticed it wasn't on the machine, but you need to find me Ninja Gaiden, the arcade game.

947
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,440
Yeah, I need Ninja Gaiden.

948
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,440
You need Ninja Gaiden on there.

949
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
I think that's it.

950
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,440
Alright, anyway.

951
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,440
Okay, we're not getting any calls over on Skyblind, so I'm going to shut it off.

952
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,440
Yeah, screw you guys.

953
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,440
Yeah, screw you guys. We're going to shut it off for a little bit.

954
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,440
We'll come back to it later though.

955
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,960
because i want about the money is i don't think you guys got to this last

957
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,880
to ever talk about the money on the show guys talk about last week i have a

958
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,120
little bit of all yet

959
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,480
hip hip all about it all didn't we

960
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,800
because i thought that you know i swear the guy that did him a more one of his

961
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,680
biggest promoters is from sacramento because i've seen the car like three

962
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,320
times now with the pin main license plate

963
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,920
and don't get that it was the guy who runs this one really big down the site

964
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,800
does live in a car michael near me and and

965
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,020
Oh, maybe that's it then.

966
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,340
Yeah, but we haven't talked to him or anything.

967
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:49,140
Alright, so DDRXtreme, DDRSpot.com, we borrowed an article from them

968
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:54,660
talking about the full song list was released, well not the full song list, but the

969
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,220
pre-unlocked song list was announced.

970
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:01,200
And a very wide mix of stuff, so I'm going to run through this list real fast.

971
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,200

01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,360
do me i was kind of a surprise to see that one wouldn't win that

976
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,480
you know you say that they've been there's the sensors who may not

978
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,040

979
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,120
uh... theme from enter the dragon

980
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,240
that make me happy

981
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,740
uh... stupid barber

982

that makes me happy to uh... dot five nine or tango ku whatever you want to

983
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,720
call it

984
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,400
uh... bad routine

985
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:44,480
Dropout, Ecstasy, I Feel, I'm For Real, Peace Out, So In Love, Sugaru, Wild Rush, and Your

986
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,240
Rain, The Rage Mix, Kiryamoka, which some of those we've announced on the show previously.

987
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,360
And then we get into the licensed songs.

988
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,240
Some of these aren't a surprise because actually an article that Loki had posted a while back

989
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:00,280
about going into the disc and looking at the master song list did prove some of these songs

990
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,560
would end up in DDR.

991
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:06,320
I noticed I recognize the first one right away because I was hoping for this diving by four strings

992
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:12,760
Well, here's the thing. It's like they made okay the master song list. I mean you work on songs for a long time

993
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,840
They might not make it into the actual game that time

994
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,680
They might save them for the next game, but it's just like, you know

995
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,040
All the songs that they said that would be in there eventually made it in there. So

996
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:29,380
Ha tell those people that say what it wasn't in that game nemesis wasn't in TDR max

997
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:38,380
They could have an intention to put it in a mix and prepare it for the thing and never

998
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,300
not put it in the final release.

999
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:47,300
change from beta to final.

1000
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:21,140
in the middle. It's not coming through. Alright, well. Logie's gonna see if he can fix that.

1001
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:31,300
That's alright, I'll copy it over real fast here. That's alright, it happens. Let's see,

1002
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:36,580
we're gonna get a copy of it real fast here. Other licensed songs that are gonna be in

1003
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:41,620
DDR Go West by the Pet Shop Boys, I think it's kind of funny that they have Pet Shop

1004
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:46,140
Boys in DDR now. That makes me happy. Because there's a lot of Pet Shop Boy covers that

1005
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:54,340
have been in DDR before. Well there was just New York City Boy. Wasn't... New York City

1006
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:58,860
boy and uh... was there another there's others okay look you got it here we go

1007
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:03,860
a clip of diving

1008
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:10,860
play in the middle somewhere

1009
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:38,140
p0k3smot42o

1010
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:43,140
Alright. That's enough, that's enough of a clip. Alright. You guys got that one.

1011
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,140
Uh, The Kids in America by Kim Wilde. Cool!

1012
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:50,140
That's the one that goes, We're the kids in America. Yep.

1013
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:54,140
And that's, that one and Go West are going to have the music video.

1014
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:58,140
That's the song I regularly played on my 80's show.

1015
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,140
Right on, right on. I'll play it, I'll play it Tuesday.

1016
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:06,140
Alright, right on. And of course, even though it's kind of, I think at this point the song's a little bit overplayed,

1017
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:09,740
This kind of reminds me of Heaven, when Heaven was announced for Max 2.

1018
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:13,620
It was kind of one of those songs that needed to be in DDR for a long time, and then it was.

1019
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:16,780
And this is very much the same for me. Move Your Feet by Junior Senior.

1020
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:23,780
With the video, so that's going to be very cool.

1021
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,140
It was kind of neat seeing that at E3.

1022
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,700
Music by Darude, which I believe I've got a clip of it somewhere.

1023
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:42,700
And it's the race to find the clip. So far, Loki is in the lead. He seems to be looking through his list of folders. Doing a search would be easier.

1024
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:47,700
I had it at one point, but I don't know if I'd do any more. Damn.

1025
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,700
It's like the Iron Chef commentary.

1026
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:56,700
somewhat. Oh no, I have next to you, I don't have music. Damn. We'll see if we can get

1027
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:01,940
a copy. Oh, alright, Logie's got it. And Logie wins. Logie wins. Play a clip somewhere

1028
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:22,700
in the middle here of music. All right, you're blasting people's speakers. All right. Planet

1029
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:26,820
Rock, Paul Oakenfold versus Africa Bambata. We've played that before, I believe, on this

1030
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:32,660
show. The Reflex, Duran Duran, which was in Japanese Max 2. That's pretty exciting. You've

1031
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:39,660
gone too far this time. Simply Being Loved by BT. Don't Clock Me from DDR Solo Mix. I

1032
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,060
believe that's one of our... That makes me happy. That's one of our songs that's in normal

1033
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:50,180
rotation on Orange Lawn's radio, I think. Yep. Now I think it is. Yes it is. So we are

1034
01:11:50,180 --> 01:12:06,340
We're definitely happy that Don't Clock Me finally made it into a U.S. DDR.

1035
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,380
And High's Off You by For Real.

1036
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:17,000
And I have no idea why this song was, I know why this song is in USA DDR, but the rest

1037
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,420
Most of us veterans are going to cringe.

1038
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:23,640
Kick the Can by Bustoff has made its way into DDR Extreme.

1039
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,920
You know that song never pissed me off until there was that little kid at Goffland who

1040
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,920
played Kick the Can.

1041
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
You were there.

1042
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,920
I was.

1043
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,920
I was there.

1044
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,920
And then he went to another machine and played some other song repeatedly.

1045
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,920
You'll enjoy this.

1046
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,240
It was before the song was out.

1047
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:45,000
The next song that's going to be in DDR Extreme is an old boy George cover that you like,

1048
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Miracle.

1049
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Don't we have that in rotation?

1050
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I think so. I'd have to dig for it, though.

1051
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It's Max 2.

1052
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Everybody knows what Miracle sounds like at this point, don't they?

1053
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
No, we don't have that one.

1054
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Miracle was the first one.

1055
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Max 1, not Max 2.

1056
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:36,600
Alright, that's enough. It's nothing compared to the original. Alright, Never Ending Story

1057
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,320
by DJ ACDC, the one of course was in DDR 5th Mix. One of my very favorite DDR songs of

1058
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:47,400
all time. I have outwet my pants when I found out this was in because you can't do a bad

1059
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:56,400
cover of this song. You absolutely can't. I've heard.

1060
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:11,000
I'm very much looking forward to that one.

1061
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,880
Rob, I did find a bad mix of that.

1062
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,880
Really?

1063
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,800
It was a happy hardcore cover, but it was bad.

1064
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,260
Only You by Captain Jack.

1065
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:22,760
We knew Captain Jack would definitely have to come back to DDR and this is the song they're

1066
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,360
bringing him back with, Only You.

1067
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,360
That was like...

1068
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,040
the video

1069
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,640
no doubt yes it will have the video. That was like the PA song for a while. That was the PA song for a long

1070
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,680
time

1071
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,400
I remember that was like everybody could PA that on heavy

1072
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,000
uh... of course this is the one that sounds like the old 50's song like it sounds like a song

1073
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
straight out of Grease

1074
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,360
boom boom boom boom boom boom

1075
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,760
this is radio station CJ Boogie

1076
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,720
with a brand new world premiere song from Captain Jack

1077
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,600
only you

1078
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,600
Only you can make me feel so true

1079
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,600
I'll never, never be so blue

1080
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,600
I know that I love you

1081
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,360
do that one for me three now this is interesting because I didn't quite

1082
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:37,760
understand what this is all about but karaoke revolution has like covers in it

1083
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:43,200
basically what it is is we have license songs without the licenses that's what

1084
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:49,280
these are these are the same songs the hell okay these are the same songs as

1085
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,760
we're in like karaoke revolution so basically it's like you know the 80s

1086
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,580
songs but sung by some retard I see so Konami got a little creative there and

1087
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:04,660
They took their licenses from Karaoke Revolution, and they took the singers that they used on

1088
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,620
these songs, and they made DDR mixes out of them.

1089
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,620
Very interesting.

1090
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,980
What a clever move by Konami, I must say, to get some very popular songs, including

1091
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:27,920
Believe, by Cher, Bizarre Love Triangle, Ladies Night, Waiting for Tonight, and Like

1092
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,720
a virgin will that make you happy yeah will make me very happy and it's not the

1093
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:40,920
euro be one no yeah it's not the euro be one so also a whole shitload of news on

1094
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:46,400
the i-toy modes this is the funny thing about the this is the funny thing about

1095
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:52,040
DDR extreme is that it's like having DDR and then you've got like this sequel to

1096
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:56,840
i-toy play in it too there is all these new modes in there it's crazy like of

1097
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,660
Of course you know hands and feet, clean the screen, we talked about that previously.

1098
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:05,560
Coconut panic has nothing to do with DDR, you just shake these coconut trees, but by

1099
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,940
the way for those who don't know what the iToy is, that's the little camera that films

1100
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:09,940
you as you're playing.

1101
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:10,940
The thing that sucks?

1102
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:11,940
It puts you in the game.

1103
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:12,940
It's like Nick Arcade.

1104
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:16,480
It turns your house into Nick Arcade.

1105
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,260
So then you shake both coconut trees and then you catch the coconuts with your hand.

1106
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,640
And the magical ball, which is like playing Breakout with your hand.

1107
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,640
Magical ball?

1108
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,640
If it had been magical balls, it would have been funnier.

1109
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,640
That would have been awesome.

1110
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,640
Almost as funny as super monkey ball.

1111
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,640
There's going to be like a party mode that has some stuff including hyper dash,

1112
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,640
which is like that old school Konami game, like track and field.

1113
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,640
It's going to be like that, but with the eye toy.

1114
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,640
So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with that.

1115
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,640
Or no, no, I'm sorry, not eye toy.

1116
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,640
They're just going to use the left and right arrows on DDR pads.

1117
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,640
It's like bringing back the power pad.

1118
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,640
So that's going to be cool.

1119
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,640
And then basically you can hit the down button and it puts a pitfall in front of the other person

1120
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,040
the other person, they have to hit the up button to jump.

1121
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,960
That's going to be very interesting.

1122
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,560
Feeding Frenzy, which is going to, it shows animals, and then every arrow on the pad is

1123
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:08,200
like a carrot or a fish, and you have to feed the animal the appropriate food by stepping

1124
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,200
on the arrow.

1125
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,200
Isn't that weird?

1126
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,200
Sounds kind of fun.

1127
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,680
That one's kind of weird.

1128
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,680
Is what?

1129
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:22,320
And then there will be a challenge mode as well in DDR, which is going to be interesting.

1130
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,020
So there were some videos released by another website and one of them gives you a sneak

1131
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:53,180
peek at what some of the interface music is going to sound like.

1132
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:56,780
So you kind of get a preview that they've done new interface music for it too, and it's

1133
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:57,780
all happy!

1134
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,700
It's fluffy and all happy.

1135
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:03,020
But it's not as awesome as a stupid barber.

1136
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:05,580
No, nothing is as awesome as a stupid barber.

1137
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:06,900
Which I noticed wasn't on that list.

1138
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,900
Or did I?

1139
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:08,900
Yeah, it was on that list.

1140
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,900
Was it?

1141
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:10,900
Oh, I must have just missed it completely.

1142
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:11,900
Because remember I went yay.

1143
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:15,180
Here's the thing, they should have really had like a porn star giant tits doing, you

1144
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:18,820
know, the little animation thing there, because they had that one chick jumping up and down

1145
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:23,060
that was not doing anything for me.

1146
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:27,020
All right, we opened up the Skype, we opened up the Skype line again. If you have any comments

1147
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:32,340
on DDR Extreme USA, something you want to share, we'll go ahead and take your call.

1148
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:36,500
Maybe something we didn't mention that you really wanted to make sure we got out there.

1149
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,100
I know one thing that was pretty humorous was they actually ran an article on Yahoo

1150
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:44,000
News. Tell us about this, Loki, because you read about this. You actually posted the article,

1151
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,780
a link to it on our site, right?

1152
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:51,780
Okay, this guy is a professional game reviewer, and I honestly don't think he's ever played this game that he reviewed.

1153
01:19:51,780 --> 01:20:03,780
Um, because honestly, he doesn't know shit about DDR at all. He has kept saying DDR Max from the Xbox, and just like crap like that, he didn't know what the fuck he was talking about, and just comparing it with like...

1154
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:07,780
He pretty much was talking out of his ass throughout the whole interview.

1155
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:11,780
So the whole interview, the whole review of the damn thing was just completely shit.

1156
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:15,780
But, you know, at least it had pictures and pretty movies.

1157
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:20,780
Yeah, that's where that movie I just played for you guys came from. Of course you can't see movies over the radio.

1158
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:23,780
But, um, I don't know, we're gonna take a haul real fast.

1159
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,780
Hello, Orange Lounge, you are on ze air.

1160
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,780
Hey, Rob, can you hear me?

1161
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,780
Yes, we can.

1162
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,780
Hey, it is Dark Knight up at the East Coast.

1163
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,780
Hey, Dark Knight, how you doing?

1164
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:38,780
Alright, yeah, what, throw a quick comment on the song list, it's a pretty decent list though.

1165
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:43,780
Yeah, it's a very, it's surprisingly different than the arcade extreme, which is good though.

1166
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,780
It's a little yellow different.

1167
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,780
Yeah.

1168
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:49,780
Yeah, but some of these songs I'm probably going to be like feeling miserably.

1169
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,780
That's alright, it takes practice.

1170
01:20:51,780 --> 01:21:01,780
I'm looking forward, as much as I think the itoy is kind of a one trick pony, I'm looking forward to having my trick the day I get extreme and being able to play the itoy modes on there.

1171
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:03,060
on there. I think it's going to be pretty cute.

1172
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:06,820
Yeah, but that sub-para-para mode, that's kind of questionable, though.

1173
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:10,620
Yeah. Well, you know, it's different. It's the closest thing we're ever going to get

1174
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,900
to anything like it in the U.S., so we might as well deal with it.

1175
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,180
That's true. That's true.

1176
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:20,140
Anything in particular on the list that you are very excited about?

1177
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,140
Wild Rush, mostly.

1178
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,140
Wild Rush?

1179
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,340
I could play that song easily.

1180
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,060
All right. All right.

1181
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:27,060
Wild Rush is awesome.

1182
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:30,300
What about the... I know I love Wild Rush, too, but I thought maybe a licensed song,

1183
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:34,320
like you know you know it's diving I'm so excited about diving because I love

1184
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,360
four strings I love them and so I'm excited the diving's in there so some of

1185
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,820
the summer song kind of crunches crunches never-ending story because in my

1186
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:46,120
area that song has been played out on our fifth machine every time we had it

1187
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:50,400
thank God is gone now which song is that again never-ending story Oh never-ending

1188
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,360
story hey don't you knock that song I'm sorry but everybody is been on

1189
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,360
So in my play round I'm like, just give it this one.

1190
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:05,360
Alright. In our chat room they're saying it's not Para Para mode, it's more like Dance Maniacs mode.

1191
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:11,360
Whatever, whatever you want to call it. It's the only Bamani hand thing we're going to have in the US, so deal.

1192
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:16,360
It's like flag down taxi mode is more like what it is. It's not even Dance Maniacs.

1193
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:20,360
It's, I look like a fucking retard. That's what it is.

1194
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:24,760
You know what? When I played Clean the Screen, I did look like a fucking retard, but it was fun.

1195
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,560
And you know what's cool about it is that it's more of a workout than...

1196
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,060
Yeah.

1197
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,360
That was the intention, I think.

1198
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,560
Yeah, you know how a lot of people play DDR for the workout aspect of it?

1199
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:37,360
When you're moving your arms in it, too, that's like three, four times the workout.

1200
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,760
Would you rather look like a goofball or do the Riverdance?

1201
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,960
I would rather look like a goofball and then have a six-pack and have...

1202
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,760
Just don't do it when you're drunk.

1203
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,160
How does moving your arms give you an ab workout, Rob?

1204
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,160
Just shut up.

1205
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,660
Look, just don't do it when you're drunk.

1206
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:51,260
DON'T RUIN MY FANTASY!

1207
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:52,480
Bitch!

1208
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,220
You know what I want to see? I want to see pure interactivity, just like Gals Panic,

1209
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:01,220
where they actually had 1-800 numbers you could call and talk to the women once you beat that level.

1210
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:04,140
That was fucking awesome. You are being way too random.

1211
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:07,340
Anyway, anything else you want to say about Extreme Dark Knight?

1212
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:11,420
No, that's about it, man. I just hope this game will be successful as it always was, man.

1213
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,500
Just keep it going long enough for me.

1214
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,040
I think it's going to be huge. You know what I think, though?

1215
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,500
Is that this is going to get people.

1216
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:22,160
Between this and Ultramix 2, and I really think Ultramix 2 is going to surprise a lot

1217
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,160
of people.

1218
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:28,460
I think people who have been bashing the Xbox, and I admit I was in this category, and then

1219
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:33,060
finally I got swayed and I bought Ultramix and I kind of ate my words on this show that

1220
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:39,020
it really isn't that bad, but Ultramix 2, mark my words right here and right now, not

1221
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:43,300
all of you people out there that bash an Xbox, but 80% of you are going to eat your words

1222
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,540
when Ultramix 2 comes out.

1223
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:50,420
I admit, I had to eat my words at one point. You will too. I think between Ultramix 2 and

1224
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:55,420
Extreme, people are going to be rioting for a new arcade mix. Because I think it's going

1225
01:23:55,420 --> 01:24:00,620
to show that US knows their shit when it comes to putting these games together. I think there's

1226
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:04,300
so many like new things in there that people are just going to say, why can't we have a

1227
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:09,220
new arcade mix? Why, why, why? Give me time. They don't put a fucking iToy thing on the

1228
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:13,480
the arcade mix, if there was ever one to come out, because that'd be the fucking stupidest

1229
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,900
thing ever. And I could go into why that would be retarded later.

1230
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:20,540
That would give you plenty of opportunity to make fun of people.

1231
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,460
But still, just the licenses, just the new interfaces, the new stuff, there's enough.

1232
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:27,500
You could take out the itoy and you would have enough cool stuff for an arcade mix.

1233
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:31,940
I'd like to go into why that's stupid right now, okay? I played that stupid game, I Can

1234
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:37,500
Boogie, okay, which is pretty much the arcade version of itoy group. Let me just say this,

1235
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:42,600
It sucks. It's just about as good as plain itoygroove. It's just as sensitive. It didn't detect shit.

1236
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,200
I completely failed my song, even though I was hitting it just right.

1237
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:52,700
And they have really stupid music, and they're like Barbie Girl and hot stuff, and like all this, like, gay-ass shit, okay?

1238
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,600
No, thank you.

1239
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,100
Alright, guys. Thanks, man.

1240
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:01,300
Alright. Yeah, we're just, like, holding you on the line, Dark Knight. We'll let you get back to listening to the show. Thanks for calling in.

1241
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:01,800
No problem, buddy.

1242
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,000
Alright, take care.

1243
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,800
That was fun.

1244
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,600
all right uh... well then back up maybe one more person went through

1245
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,560
uh... d r stream

1246
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,140
do you get off the quiet over there i know you don't care as much about the

1247
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,480
archie do it to the expo

1248
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:20,600
and a party is able to think about all this

1249
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,400
the last summer play do you know i was when you're over at my house and we

1250
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,040
decide to see if my red octane pad

1251
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,040
well broke and i was a lot of it lady are by the way which is about three

1252
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,660
weeks ago was india i had fun with it but you know it's just

1253
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:37,260
I mean, if they're not going to make anything new in Japan, I shouldn't be that concerned

1254
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:41,140
about them making anything new here, because I don't really give a crap about licensed

1255
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:44,780
songs a lot of the time, and more about the original stuff, so...

1256
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:48,180
But the new modes and the new features don't do it for you?

1257
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:54,460
Well, okay, like, remember back in the day, that PC game called, like, Kai's Photo Goo?

1258
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:59,020
No, I have no idea what you're talking about, but okay.

1259
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:05,860
I've seen screenshots of these new itoy modes for DDR Extreme, what the fuck is this, it

1260
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:11,120
looks like some goofy piece of crap like that, and it's like, they should just say it's a

1261
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:17,300
bonus game for Extreme, it's not a part of Extreme, it's Extreme bundled with itoy bullshit.

1262
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:23,420
But see, I give Konami a little credit for giving us new itoy bullshit or new bullshit

1263
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:28,780
at all and not just, you know, especially after they took such an ass-kicking for DDR

1264
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:33,140
USA and like the horrible stuff we got on PlayStation 1, I mean, for them to come and

1265
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,140
do this and-

1266
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:38,820
It is cool, I'm just kind of, I'm with the Japanese where I don't really care about-

1267
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:41,700
It's just not your cup of tea.

1268
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,260
It lost its value.

1269
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,300
Wake you up when 2DX comes to you.

1270
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:50,580
When I want to get some exercise on again, I'll break it out and then I might buy a new,

1271
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:55,500
like I might buy Extreme USA when that's here if I feel like getting in shape or something.

1272
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,700
That's about it.

1273
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:02,260
I'm gonna put up a thing in our forums when Ultramix 2 comes out because I want to see

1274
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:07,140
how many people went out and bought an Xbox because of Ultramix 2.

1275
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:13,100
I think it's gonna be, and I don't know, I just, there's just too much hype about it

1276
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,300
and I think it's gonna live up to the hype.

1277
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,300
We'll see.

1278
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:18,300
Alright, moving on.

1279
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,540
We're gonna move on to the other Bahmani news?

1280
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,340
Uh, actually I want to save that.

1281
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,020
I think I kind of want to get into CAGEMATCH now because it's 8 o'clock already.

1282
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:30,020
We're already halfway through the show, so we gotta get some of our regular bits out of the way here.

1283
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:30,520
Alright.

1284
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,520
So, yeah, um...

1285
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,020
Are you doing more bad video game trivia that I can suck at?

1286
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,020
What, the Orange Crush stuff?

1287
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,020
No, the...

1288
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,020
No, no, that was the Vanilla Sky thing.

1289
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:42,020
Oh, okay. But...

1290
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:42,520
Darn.

1291
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,520
That's alright.

1292
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,520
That was one of my spin-offs, though.

1293
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,020
Shows you how often I come here.

1294
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:52,020
Can they hear the Tetris over there? Somebody's saying who's playing Tetris, so I wonder...

1295
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,520
Can they hear that over the air, or...?

1296
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:58,640
I don't know hopefully not we'll see all right yeah we're gonna get into the

1297
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:06,520
cage match right now oh no my bad I thought they could hear it just a

1298
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,160
reminder you have to be in the chat room if you want to participate in our cage

1299
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:13,600
match but it is the chatters that pick the winners of this stuff so let's get

1300
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:20,120
into it last week on the orange launch radio cage match oh the way cage match

1301
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:24,600
works I should explain this three songs picked by the host it used to be songs

1302
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:28,760
that would be good for music video games like DDR and 2dx and stuff but it just

1303
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:33,800
kind of turned into what's a cool song it's basically what it turned into so

1304
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:41,360
that's okay but we each song picks the host each host picks each song pick the

1305
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:48,160
host no each host pick the song and then we let you guys vote on them and then

1306
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:51,480
winner goes into rotation all week long here on orange on three do now I hear

1307
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:58,040
that while I was gone my song lost and it was taken over by Loki pick and Loki

1308
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:02,360

1309
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:07,160

1310
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:11,840
and I really like this mix though so we'll see so here it is you only get to

1311
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,600
hear a clip of it because it is last week's winner so we only play a little

1312
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,460
clip of it because we assumed you already heard it last week like a good listener would.

1313
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:24,740
So here it is, a little clip of Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.

1316
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:03,740
The

1317
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:07,740
The

1318
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:11,740
The

1319
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:15,740
The

1320
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:19,740
The

1321
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:23,740
The

1322
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:46,020
Alright, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's cage match, a very sexy remix

1323
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:53,000
of Ecstasy done by our very own Loki, 14 hours club mix, so yeah, wow, it's going to be tough

1324
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,100
to be but uh... jamie and i are certainly gonna try i think i have a

1325
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,440
song that might do it

1326
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:01,380
i think that but we will give yours a try to jamie but i gotta say looking at

1327
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,360
your pick

1328
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,460
this isn't

1329
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:06,400
this isn't what i would think you would listen to i'm very surprised by your

1330
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,240
pick

1331
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,820
return it turn on your mike

1332
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,100
internet

1333
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,860
well you know you like those metro mixes

1334
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:15,480
but the artist is somebody i would never expect

1335
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:18,600
you to like this is a sexy boy

1336
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:24,200
you need to regain regal and i think that i think that i think that i think

1337
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,680
and anything that's good

1338
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,680
and your own

1339
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,920
the metric

1340
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:28,860
because

1341
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,080
it's a metric

1342
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,880
and so this is something that you think would be good indeed you are just

1343
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,460
it's just cool why

1344
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:37,040
and didn't know

1345
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:44,040
it would be playable but i mean it

1346
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,240
We'll see what the folks here think.

1347
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:55,240

If you were a kid with me Why'd you hear it from me?

1360
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:29,240
Would you say that you'll always be me?

1361
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:36,240
Would you lie? Would you remember me?

1362
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:45,240

And I can be your hero

1381
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,240
Good voice, Metro Max, it's like a 9 from me.

1382
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,240
Alright, 9 from Jamie.

1383
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,240
Garrett.

1384
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:41,240
I hear the original version of that song all damn day at work, I don't want to hear it.

1385
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,240
Scale of 1 to 10?

1386
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,240
Bel Air Radio.

1387
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,240
I don't know. No comment.

1388
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,240
Alright, Bug.

1389
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:53,240
I was playing Cytobike. Cytobike was better.

1390
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,240
Alright, Loki.

1391
01:36:55,240 --> 01:37:04,240
Is eh, the original song is like eh, and this is just like eh within their beats in the background, like it was like a five.

1392
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:14,240
Um, I, it's definitely, I like it better than the original, I like it with the added beat, um, so it's above average to me, so I give it like a seven, so it's pretty cool.

1393
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:19,240
Um, but I've heard better Metro mixes, like I like the Daniel Bedingfield ones better, but that's alright.

1394
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:26,240
Anyway, moving on, I'm going to try this from iTunes tonight, because this is a song I actually bought on iTunes.

1395
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,240
Hopefully it works for you guys.

1396
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:33,240
Song number three in tonight's cage match is my pick, and I don't know if you guys have heard,

1397
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:36,240
but Utada Hikaru is going to be coming out with a US album.

1398
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,240
Go to utada.com.

1399
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:42,240
Yep, and she's going to be under the name Utada, just simply Utada here in the US.

1400
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:46,240
And the lead single is out now, and it's called Devil Inside.

1401
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:50,740
And I liked one of the remixes of the songs in the single, so I picked that for tonight's cage match.

1402
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:56,940
So my pick for tonight's cage match is Utada with Devil Inside, the Richard Vision radio edit.

1403
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:57,940
Enjoy, you guys.

1404
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:31,940
If everybody wants something, take a crayon

1405
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:44,940
If you don't know my plan

1406
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:51,940
If you don't know my plan

1407
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:30,940
You don't know the future, baby, baby

1408
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:38,940
You're actually missing all the action and dreams, baby

1409
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:56,940
Maybe there's something like it inside, maybe there's something like it inside for me

1410
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:59,140
There's something like it inside

1411
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,960
There's something like it inside

1412
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,960
Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1413
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,960
Utada with Devil Inside.

1414
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,960
That's her first American single.

1415
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,960
Well, unless you count Simple and Clean, but that wasn't really a single.

1416
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,960
Devil Inside, the Richard Vision radio edit.

1417
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:16,960
Let's go around and see what everybody thought.

1418
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:17,960
Jamie!

1419
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:25,960
I really, really dig her voice, but that was such a boring remix that I give it a six.

1420
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:26,960
Aww.

1421
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,960
Her voice gets a ten, the mix itself would get like a four, so she gets a six.

1422
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:38,300
Honestly thought the original was so repetitive that it wouldn't have worked in cage match. I agree the remix is kind of but

1423
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:44,320
Garrett um I never heard the original or the remix and I was kind of I was pretty fond of it

1424
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,280
I like to voice a lot in that too everything I usually hear from her

1425
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:53,280
Sounds like they want to be like Britney or something so I'm I know it's good to hear something something

1426
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,820
I've sounded slightly more original vocally so I get a seven all right seven from Garrett

1427
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:01,100
uh... but we give them a mic

1428
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:03,480
if he's not to be playing something on the main cabinet

1429
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,900
actually i was kind of thing

1430
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:06,240
okay what do you think

1431
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,700
uh... but in the last one

1432
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:12,060
i would you give us going to have

1433
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:13,380
uh... right

1434
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:15,220
i love you

1435
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:16,180
uh...

1436
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:19,740
you know i swear to god i've heard that might be another car i'd just don't

1437
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:22,060
remember what exactly it was

1438
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:24,660
so uh... right and

1439
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:26,460
and i like her

1440
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,940
i like her music

1441
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:31,580
but that was just like really crappy she should really just

1442
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:35,260
take everything she does in japan just bring it over here don't try to you know

1443
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:41,620
make it no more american by taking a shit on it you know

1444
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:44,700
so yeah i'll give it like a six

1445
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:50,900
uh... me personally it's very disco to me and disco rocks so i give it an eight

we'll see

1471
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,520

uh...

1474
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:56,080
moving on uh... i guess we'll get into the other people on the use of a nobody

1475
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,480
wanted to call and that's all just uh...

1476
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:03,920
uh... but the other thing that i can't get it to work

1477
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,800
i have to make a comment that they can't get it to work

1478
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:09,800
all right and i

1479
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,000
uh... that's right

1480
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,080
uh... so what's tell us about the uh... two d x eleven style news

1481
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,540
guarantees and meaning me

1482
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:20,760
you know so we're doing i have to say first up are you sure this is legit

1483
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,020
because i was really good at that point where it is

1484
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:25,120
and shouted very

1485
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:28,700
they're telling us what part of it you know go well wait a minute you know

1486
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:31,920
there was it didn't have that kind of air to

1487
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:36,580
d r extreme to stuff that was going around right but

1488
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,040
yet but yet

1489
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,700
it will anyways um...

1490
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:42,420
Well, actually, the strangest thing is, um,

1491
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:45,980
DJP on Damani's style, like, I haven't talked to him in a long time,

1492
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,140
and then we just,

1493
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,660
like, he just messaged me, like,

1494
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:50,320
like, one morning, he was like, oh, they,

1495
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,020
we just found out, Eleven's style, la la la.

1496
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:57,360
The only thing that makes it look fake is all the damn speculation that's going on it,

1497
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:00,300
because there hasn't, there isn't a lot of concrete information.

1498
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:01,740
There is, um,

1499
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:03,820
a fax that came out

1500
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:06,660
that they, um, it's, they said that it's the, it's the,

1501
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:12,180
They always send these faxes out to arcades, when there's a new style coming out, and test

1502
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:16,580
locations soon to give arcades information about the next upgrade kit and stuff.

1503
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:22,060
And that was what was sent to whoever, I forgot the whole chain of people it went through,

1504
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:27,440
but they said their sources from where it came from are very legit, and I believe everything

1505
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:35,260
on the fax, but people are already saying that, oh, KorsKay is doing the system music,

1506
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:39,660
oh there's gonna be an iconoclasm song in it and all this other crap and it's

1507
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:43,860
not just wishful thinking because when I did the part that got me was that they

1508
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:46,980
said that Oh No Ken was gonna have a song in it and don't get me wrong I

1509
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:50,260
think that should happen because he's a very talented that's all the

1510
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:55,900
speculation that makes me go that's so fanboy ish you know yeah well they said

1511
01:46:55,900 --> 01:47:01,300
like I said you know okay course K doing the system music okay DJ talk is in all

1512
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:07,260
the system music except, um, Slake did the theme for 8th style. Unless I'm, I'm disregarding

1513
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:07,260
old stuff.

1514
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,660
But Chorus K is kind of made more and more of a presence in 2DX, 9th, 10th.

1515
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:14,580
I would say it'd be a bigger surprise, um, I'd say it'd make more sense for a reused

1516
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:21,340
star to do, um, the system music. Because all of a sudden it went from one song in 4th,

1517
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:26,740
a remix in 9th, and then three new songs in 10th, and Chorus K still only has two songs

1518
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:37,380
in existence in 2DX or 3. So I'm like, whatever. But they showed me the facts and stuff. There's

1519
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:45,380
a link to it on Bamani style too. But I wasn't in a very Japanese-y mood to try and make

1520
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:49,280
out much of it. But one thing I did notice on there, because a lot of people are saying

1521
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:55,500
that it's going to be transplant heavy, I think that they may have misread that or I

1522
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:00,680
I just didn't read it thoroughly enough. There's a part at the bottom where it says, it mentions

1523
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:06,160
pop music, drum mania and guitar freaks, but it says collaboration in Katakana. So it may

1524
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:12,680
be more artists from other games are crossing over into this.

1525
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:17,160
Interesting. Also, speaking of artists, we just got this word in our chat room. Mel B,

1526
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:21,920
who by passes along some official news from Konami, mentions that Shotee, I don't think

1527
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:24,560
I don't think he's done anything in 2DX, but DDR, of course, is stupid barber.

1528
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:29,640
Shotee has parted ways with Konami, so we won't be singing any more songs from him,

1529
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:30,640
which is too bad.

1530
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,640
Aww, no more Shoichiro Hirata?

1531
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:32,640
Yeah, because...

1532
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,640
Aww.

1533
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,640
That's sad.

1534
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,080
There was no more Kira Shunsuker...

1535
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,080
I think that was his name.

1536
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:43,440
In Popin Music 11, once I got my damn CD, I rifled through the booklet, and he's gone

1537
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,440
too.

1538
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:45,440
Yeah.

1539
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,440
Yeah.

1540
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:56,440
Yeah, the only thing that I think is really, really weird about that fax is that it's 2Dx11 style red.

1541
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:00,440
What the hell is that? 2Dx Red.

1542
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,440
Did you see the fax?

1543
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:05,440
No, you can actually see the actual fax?

1544
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:10,440
Yeah, you can see the fax. They have pictures of EMAL cards on it too.

1545
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:15,440
I know there's going to be an upgrade for the EMAL machine or system or something.

1546
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:20,440
They said there will be over 300 songs included in the arcade, I think.

1547
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:22,440
But yeah, just go to Bimani style real quick.

1548
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,440
Alright, I'm going, I'm going. Let's see, let's check this out.

1549
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:26,440
And then it's on the last news.

1550
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,440
Thank God they don't have that god-awful music.

1551
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:32,440
Actually, I really like that song that used to play on here, but man, after hearing it for like three weeks.

1552
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,440
And then down at the bottom.

1553
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,440
Bottom, bottom.

1554
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:36,440
Bottom, bottom, bottom.

1555
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:37,440
Headlines.

1556
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,440
Alright, we're on our way.

1557
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:42,000
take a look at the facts here. Because I haven't seen this. Remember, I was gone for two weeks.

1558
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,480
I was completely out of the loop for like two weeks.

1559
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:49,400
Oh, there it is. Okay, just click on the first page. And it's a link right there.

1560
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:53,800
So when I came back home, I was like, oh, interesting.

1561
01:49:53,800 --> 01:50:01,160
Yes.

1562
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:02,160
Very interesting.

1563
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:03,160
Let's see, there's going to be more than...

1564
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,960
What? With a little screenshot and everything?

1565
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:13,640
Yeah, okay, more than 45 new songs, more than 320 songs in the fucking arcade, here's all

1566
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:20,600
those email cards, blah, blah, blah, see there's the thing right here it says, it's like, I'm

1567
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:29,440
being lazy, it's like miscellaneous spamani, series, something, music, collaboration, no,

1568
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:43,240
can't translate it, it's a scan. Collaboration. It doesn't say transplant, it says collaboration.

1569
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:52,280
It's an English word they're using. Popping music from many guitar freaks. New something,

1570
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:58,360
something participating entry user something. Garrett's going through and actually reading

1571
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:01,640
something like what japanese he knows he's reading some of the japanese facts

1572
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:05,640
is all in japanese but he's reading some of it i can type it out later and do

1573
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:08,240
of lazy translation on it too but i'm sure

1574
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:11,180
i think that i don't i don't somebody obviously are all the people who did the

1575
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:14,840
speculating and said stuff about what was listed in here i have no idea who

1576
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,600
actually did that or if they

1577
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,660
were going off their own guesses are actually translated from the they have a

1578
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:23,000
lot of japanese users on there that can do that though

1579
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,120
right here

1580
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:28,120
you know the pictures that they show a really shitty

1581
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:41,120
But maybe, like, for instance, maybe the background for, like, that one screenshot was FMV from an OnuKen song, because he does do his, you know, BMS files with, you know, full motion video.

1582
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:45,120
And so they might have recognized that, and that's where the speculation for that comes.

1583
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:46,120
Oh.

1584
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:47,120
Just a guess.

1585
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:48,120
Who knows?

1586
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:50,120
I couldn't see anything in it.

1587
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,120
All right.

1588
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,120
Well, we'll, uh...

1589
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,120
They have...

1590
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:54,120
I don't know.

1591
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,120
I mean, it's a scan of a fax.

1592
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:57,120
I mean, eh, you know?

1593
01:51:57,120 --> 01:52:02,400
I don't know. It's just the facts. Actually, yeah, the scan of the facts, but it's going

1594
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,720
to look the same either way. I want to spat out the machine where it was faxed from.

1595
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:11,840
Still, it's just that OnoKen thing. It just reeks of fanboy. It's not that I don't want

1596
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,760
to believe it's true, because I think that's awesome, but it's just so... I don't know.

1597
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,200
I think if it is true, that's very cool. The Konami did that.

1598
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,180
The Iconoclasm thing is very fanboy too. Come on.

1599
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:27,180
I don't see how you would know who's doing the theme music and whatnot yet.

1600
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:35,180
There were so many people who planted bullshit rumors when 10th Style was coming out on secret songs and stuff. It was not even funny.

1601
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:40,180
They would even talk about how the Japanese really like to just fuck with us.

1602
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:48,180
We're being called out in the chat room because it's not really 11th Style because now it's the 2DX Red.

1603
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:54,180
It's not 11th, it's 2DX Red. But you know, how long were we calling it DDR6 Mix before we found it?

1604
01:52:54,180 --> 01:52:56,180
It still has an 11 in there.

1605
01:52:56,180 --> 01:53:00,180
Yeah, there's a little 11 in there, so it's a reference to it.

1606
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:03,180
I don't think we're going to be seeing blue or yellow or any other color anytime soon.

1607
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:07,180
Somebody suggested 2DX Grape for 12th.

1608
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,180
I want a purple 2DX.

1609
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:10,180
That's what I want.

1610
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:13,180
I hope they change the interface up and stuff.

1611
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:15,180
I'm sorry, what, Jamie?

1612
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:17,180
We can't hear you.

1613
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:23,580
I was taking a nap. 2DX burning.

1614
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:24,580
Burning heat.

1615
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:25,580
Burning.

1616
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,580
Burning.

1617
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:27,580
Burnination mix.

1618
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:30,100
Like a 2DX Muru mix or something.

1619
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,100
Alright.

1620
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:32,100
That'd be cool.

1621
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:35,460
Anything else you actually had to think of on 2DX?

1622
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:38,820
When the fax came out they said that the test location was going on that day.

1623
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:39,820
They were wrong.

1624
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:43,060
They reconfirmed it and they said that it should actually be going on within this next

1625
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:46,660
week because when they send these faxes all the test locations have happened within a

1626
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:49,780
week of them sending it, usually, so that's kind of quick.

1627
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:54,340
We'll probably, well, it's just a fact, it's just for the test location.

1628
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:57,560
They do think these things kind of last a moment anyway, so this week, hopefully, we'll

1629
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:58,560
probably sing.

1630
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:04,580
Yeah, but it seems like the time between eighth's release and anything on ninth, and the ninth's

1631
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:09,220
release and anything on tenth, was longer than tenth's release and now this first bit

1632
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:12,380
of indication that there will be a continuation of the series.

1633
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:18,420
kind of snuck up after 9th in my opinion. I don't know. Shit, they hella jump on these

1634
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:23,700
things on the Drummanian Guitar Freak stuff. They just spew those things out. But they

1635
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:28,380
said that the test location should probably be going on within a week or so. They think

1636
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:34,300
that the actual arcade will be out in October. And also, I don't know if everyone didn't

1637
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:37,560
know, 8th Style CS will be released before the year is over.

1638
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:38,560
over.

1639
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,560
Good.

1640
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,560
Yeah.

1641
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:41,560
Good news.

1642
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,560
All right.

1643
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,560
Lots of fun stuff in the 2DX front then.

1644
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:44,560
Good.

1645
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:45,560
So it's not a dying series.

1646
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:46,560
No.

1647
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,560
As most people would like you to believe.

1648
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,560
Yay.

1649
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,560
All right.

1650
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:50,560
We're going to reveal...

1651
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:51,560
If that's all you got to say on 2DX.

1652
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:52,560
Yep.

1653
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:53,560
All right.

1654
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:56,280
We'll go ahead and open up the Skype line if somebody has a comment they want to say

1655
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:00,380
on 2DX11, 2DX Red, whatever you want to call it.

1656
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:02,380
Why 2DX Red?

1657
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:03,380
Why?

1658
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:04,380
This is...

1659
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:05,380
Whatever.

1660
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:06,380
I guess why Max?

1661
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:07,380
I mean, why Max?

1662
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:10,460
Why Pokemon Red? Why Pokemon Blue?

1663
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:15,260
Why do they have all their bad Engrish titles and their banners and stuff?

1664
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:19,380
Somebody in our chat room was comparing it to Dance Mania being like Dance Mania Best

1665
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:22,220
Red and Best Yellow.

1666
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:26,620
Which is interesting because 2DX isn't really related to Dance Mania, yet that kind of makes

1667
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:27,620
sense.

1668
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:28,620
I don't know.

1669
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:30,780
Interesting. Maybe it's a Japanese thing. I don't know.

1670
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:33,940
Alright, here comes a call. Let's check out what's going on.

1671
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:35,740
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge.

1672
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:37,740
Hey, what's up?

1673
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:40,740
I wanted to make a comment on my 2D exploration.

1674
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:44,740
Hey, we got a little bit of a problem with your bandwidth. You're cutting up a little bit.

1675
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:46,740
Well, I'm downloading it.

1676
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:48,740
Weird. Is your stream running?

1677
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:49,740
Oh, yeah.

1678
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:52,740
Stop the station if you have the station running.

1679
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:57,740
Ooh, he's cutting out really bad. Can he say something again?

1680
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:02,740
Okay, buddy, you're cutting out really bad. I'm sorry. See, try calling back in a little bit.

1681
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:07,540
back in a little bit. I don't know what's going on there, so sorry about that. That's

1682
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:23,900
too bad. All right. Well, we'll just try it again in a little bit. We'll keep it open.

1683
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:28,140
Moving on. Well, with the Skype line still open, if anybody's got a comment on 2DX, what

1684
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:35,900
think of all this, Loki? I don't play 2DX. All right, Siggy's going to try back. We're

1685
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:45,940
going to see if it works this time. All right, can you hear us now? Hey, what's up? Huh,

1686
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:58,060
weird. Well, what's up? You know what, you're still cutting out really, really bad. I'm

1687
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:01,820
bad I'm sorry we're gonna have to send me a message in the chat room and we'll

1688
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:06,940
address your comments sorry bud all right weird doesn't want to work we

1689
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:09,340
were talking to him earlier and it worked fine that's kind of weird maybe

1690
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:13,900
something on our end somebody downloading porn here in the house all

1691
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:17,660
right I'll ask them

1692
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:27,660
Because it's Strider, which is the most awesome game ever.

1693
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:30,660
Nobody in video games is cooler than Strider here you.

1694
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:35,660
I asked Ziggy to send me his thoughts over a private message, so we'll address those in a little bit.

1695
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:40,660
Meanwhile, let's talk about the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we? That'll be exciting.

1696
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:46,660
Tonight's cage match winner really isn't much of a surprise. Loki wins it again.

1697
01:57:46,660 --> 01:58:02,940
with ecstasy the 14 hours club mix. Congratulation to you my friend. Good job. All right. Okay

1698
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:11,980
so hey speaking of which, Loki, any sim news you got going on in the world of the simulations?

1699
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:23,980
Yeah, there's a little bit. Um, starting off with a few things. I downloaded this really cool, uh, theme earlier this week. Um, it was called Technolizer something to the effect.

1700
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:33,980
Anyways, it's just some really cool, um, uh, StepMania theme that's, I don't know, it's just, it looks a little different than the rest of them. So, that's kinda cool.

1701
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:39,600
out on StepMania, they have it under the themes forum. It's under a thread called, I found

1702
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:44,060
this really cool StepMania theme. What? Was that the theme you were showing me the other

1703
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:47,340
night? Because that was an awesome theme. Yes, that was the one I was showing you the

1704
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:53,900
other night. Anyways, so there's that one. Other than that, some developments, as far

1705
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:58,640
as sim stuff goes, there's a guy that figured out how to rip the polygon dancing characters

1706
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:03,460
out of the DDR games, so he's doing that now. So that's kind of cool. And with that, he's

1707
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:08,260
also getting all the graphics and background animations from the game, so pretty much everything

1708
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:15,220
is being able to be ripped from DDR now, so nothing really left. Aside from that, there's

1709
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:24,940
also a new contest going on, DDR OSC 3, which is another Stepfile contest. It didn't really

1710
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:31,460
get much, you know, exposure last time, but now it's on, you know, Bomaniacel's plug-in

1711
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:43,460
So, basically the entry date for that is now August 15th. Submission for files ends on the 22nd, and the first cluster of files will be released on the 29th.

1712
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:47,460
With results, of course, at the end of each week, just like, you know, Turning Mix.

1713
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:49,460
And, so those are on there.

1714
01:59:49,460 --> 02:00:05,460
And aside from all that, in case you haven't been following stuff, they actually do have support now being added in Step Mania for a bunch of different game types, including Beat Mania, Dance Maniacs, and TechnoMotion, which I thought was interesting.

1715
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:15,460
So those you can download actually and play it, and I'm sure Alpha, I think 22 now will be coming out any time now.

1716
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:18,460
So that's pretty much all that's going on right now.

1717
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:29,460
Alright, let's see, now what we're going to do, we're going to go to a break I think, and then we'll come back and we'll get into the FUs of the week.

1718
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:36,460
So if you have something angsty you want to send to us all, go to our chat room and send me a private message with your angst.

1719
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:41,460
In the meantime, we're going to hear a couple more songs from Poppin' Eleven, and I believe Garrett has another surprise for us.

1720
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:43,460
So tell us about what we're going to hear this break, Garrett.

1721
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:48,820
Well first, I picked another song for Rob, it's a remix of one of his songs that has

1722
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:51,140
a penguin-esque character in it.

1723
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:55,100
It's a remix of Requiem from Popin' Music 9.

1724
02:00:55,100 --> 02:01:01,240
And then, after that, is a CS9 song, and as you know, all the CS9 songs were on this soundtrack.

1725
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:08,700
It's Yume To Genjitsu, and it's one of the few songs on here that actually sounds to

1726
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:10,940
be rearranged slightly.

1727
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:13,680
was only like one song on here I noticed that on the whole soundtrack that

1728
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:17,240
sounded like it took a real different turn from how it sounded in the game and

1729
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:23,400
then last um a remix another remix of yokon co but this is from desk Rose

1730
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:28,760
album and it's just like a pretty much all heavy metal mix it's strangely it's

1731
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:33,680
basically game size but they added in another verse so they cut off the

1732
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:38,660
beginning verse and there's no reggae to it anymore so but it's pretty cool so

1733
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:45,660
So yeah, all right, let's check it out, starting this set off with a remix of Requiem, enjoy.

1734
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:10,660
Oh

1735
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:40,660
Get it, get it, go!

1736
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:59,100
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

1737
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:02,580
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

1738
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:07,140
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program,

1739
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:08,380
can we talk about that?

1740
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:12,940
subject will ever be taboo. Well I was thinking maybe we should move pump up

1741
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:17,080
the volume from Tuesday nights. Except of course the subject that was just under

1742
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:21,840
discussion. Okay well what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of

1743
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:27,960
the tack music we play on the station? I collect your fucking head. Just like this

1744
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:32,880
fucker here. Oh my god why did you do that to

1745
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:39,600
Loki the holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke now if any of you sons of

1746
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:45,080
bitches got anything else to say now's the fucking time

1756
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:21,640
or something that come

1757
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:23,760
make up to it

1758
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,760
Well, are we hearing it?

1759
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:30,760
You died.

1760
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:33,760
So tell us about Pump Up the Volume while you play Psycho Soldier here.

1761
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,260
Um, I play good music, and that's about it.

1762
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:37,760
Why are you moving?

1763
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,260
Because I'm going to school.

1764
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:40,260
Because you're doing your show.

1765
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:43,260
Alright, so what time on Tuesday nights can we expect to hear your show?

1766
02:09:43,260 --> 02:09:48,260
Um, I'm supposed to start my pre-show at 7 o'clock, so I usually get bored and start it early.

1767
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:50,760
And then we don't really end on time either.

1768
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:55,760
Let's go somewhere between 7 and 10. Just tune in to the station.

1769
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:59,760
Just leave it on all the time, and then maybe you'll hear Katie on Tuesday night.

1770
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:01,760
Alright, so probably the volume is moving to Tuesdays this week.

1771
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,760
And are you going to be doing the video game music trivia again?

1772
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:05,760
Eventually.

1773
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,760
Eventually, she says. Alright, we'll see.

1774
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:11,760
That means Diversion will be moving to Monday nights starting this week,

1775
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:16,760
so be sure to tune in tomorrow night for all the cool Blamani remixes and all that stuff,

1776
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:18,760
some good stuff on that show.

1777
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:23,600
Wednesday nights, we currently have nothing on schedule. Something will be happening with

1778
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:30,160
my stuff. I just have to kind of do some other things first, because I'm going to be going

1779
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:33,040
out of town again, so I kind of want to start a show before I go out of town, but we'll

1780
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:37,600
kind of see what happens. We'll see what happens. I do miss, I do miss Vanilla Sky, though.

1781
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:41,800
That was a great, that was a great show for me, so. I want to bring it back, we'll see.

1782
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:44,400
And, Loki, you ever going to do anything, weren't you going to have like a game show

1783
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:51,240
in 2004? Did that get pushed back to 2005? It got pushed back to 2000 and never. Um,

1784
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:55,000
I don't know. We'll see. I'm still writing the problems with MAME. I've got to, like,

1785
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:59,280
work on my cabinet a little bit. Like, I have to install more RAM because I'm getting lag

1786
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:02,880
on, like, some of the keys, and I have to take out Joy to Key and reset all my buttons

1787
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:16,240
and stuff. Yeah. Now I'm going to get a 512 stick. So anyways, so yeah, I just need more

1788
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:23,020
RAM and maybe up my processor a bit. We'll see. Alright, Jamie, you got to put the game

1789
02:11:23,020 --> 02:11:29,840
on pause or else you're going to miss your favorite part of the show. You're going to

1790
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:34,680
miss your favorite part of the show? What would be your favorite part of the show, Jamie?

1791
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:39,760
The FUs of the Week. That's right. I'm done with Psycho Soldier. So, uh, what do we do

1792
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:43,400
during the FUs of the Week? Why do we, why do the FUs of the Week exist on this show

1793
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,400
about gaming nerd stuff.

1794
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:48,400
Cuz, dammit gaming nerds have feelings too!

1795
02:11:48,400 --> 02:12:03,400
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is... This is fucked up!

1796
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:14,640
oh big f you goes to work for being busy busy busy busy busy and just say it was

1797
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:24,880
busy it's horrendously busy and also a big if she goes toward like well I don't

1798
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:30,080
know it's just that this week I've been too busy to be angsty about things if

1799
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:36,960
you can believe that. I'd have to say another one goes toward people who have big patience

1800
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:43,960
issues and I mean there's some things it's okay to be impatient about but not driving.

1801
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:49,120
You know, do not change lanes when you are about to hit somebody like this stupid fucker

1802
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:56,600
behind me who was right on my tail the entire time on the freeway today. I just need to

1803
02:12:56,600 --> 02:13:01,600
to get a Humvee. That's all there is to it. I need to drive a Humvee with an assault rifle.

1804
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:08,600
Right on the top. And I'll need like a gunner to drive with me. You know, let's say it turns

1805
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:10,600
and I'll use a gunner and the other person can drive.

1806
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:15,600
What was that game with the two, where you and your friend would sit in there and like

1807
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:18,600
crash and, it's like crash and dance or something? Bucky and Wild.

1808
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:23,600
Bucky and Wild. We had one of those at my arcade that I worked at. But yeah, I need

1809
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:30,600
I need something like that, or I just need like, you know, like an auto fire or something,

1810
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:31,600
you know.

1811
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:37,600
He's seeking, more on seeking missiles, that's what I need on my cars, more on seeking missiles.

1812
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:44,600
When I first got my new Jetta, the horns were thumb triggers, and I had imagined at one

1813
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:47,600
point that I would make them into actual thumb triggers.

1814
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:50,600
Putting missiles in next to the headlights, that would work pretty well.

1815
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:52,600
I'm sure it's very legal too.

1816
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:56,600
It is in South Africa, but damn we're not there.

1817
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:59,600
I just downloaded Lucky and Wild.

1818
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:06,600
You want to know what sucks, though? As much as I would love to actually get a real Humvee and, you know, remake it,

1819
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:12,600
you know, you actually cannot get a Humvee anymore because they're now ordered to be destroyed due to some contract deal.

1820
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,600
Doesn't that suck?

1821
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:15,600
That's interesting.

1822
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:18,600
Yeah, when they're used up, Humvee goes to the scrap heap.

1823
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:23,600
They probably hid Bush's medical records in one of those.

1824
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:25,600
Or the military records.

1825
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:32,600
For those who didn't hear that whole sentence, Loki said they probably hid Bush's military records in one of those.

1826
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:35,600
I think they couldn't figure out which ones so they have to destroy them all.

1827
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:37,600
By accident.

1828
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:43,600
No, it has to do with when they were put out on the market.

1829
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:53,600
There was, like, some order for them not to be resold, so they were actually, quote, given to a distributor who sold them for the military and got the money back.

1830
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:57,600
But, uh, that was all. Now they have to all be destroyed.

1831
02:14:57,600 --> 02:14:59,600
Doesn't that suck?

1832
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:03,600
I'm still going to get a Humvee one day.

1833
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:05,600
I'm gonna paint it camo.

1834
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:08,600
And put myself a big ol' gun at the top of it.

1835
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:11,600
And drive that shit around.

1836
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:14,600
I don't care if the gun works, I'm going to have one on there.

1837
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:23,600
It's going to be like in Cruise and World, where you could drive the Hummer with the gun.

1838
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:25,600
I remember that.

1839
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:30,600
It was always either that, the school bus, or the three-wheel truck that I would use.

1840
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:33,600
You talking about Cruise and World makes me think about Nintendo arcade games,

1841
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:36,600
which makes me think about how I really want to play Killer Instinct.

1842
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:38,600
It still says Ultra 64 on it, isn't that sad?

1843
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:39,600
I want to play Killer Instinct.

1844
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:40,600
Dude, I love Killer Instinct.

1845
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:42,600
Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

1846
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:44,600
F.U. to Killer Instinct for dying.

1847
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:46,600
We miss you.

1848
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:48,600
Killer Instinct.

1849
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:51,600
And F.U. goes toward Mortal Kombat Annihilation.

1850
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:53,600
Cause I finally saw it.

1851
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,600
How could a movie that sucks-

1852
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:57,600
Welcome to five years ago, oh my god.

1853
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:00,600
I knew it was gonna suck, so I just didn't bother seeing it.

1854
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:03,600
But Ross made me watch it yesterday.

1855
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:06,600
I brought over The Last Samurai, good movie.

1856
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:08,600
You know what you need to play in that main cabinet right now?

1857
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:16,080
Street Fighter 2 the movie the game. Ah no hell no I played that game that game is deep it is so

1858
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:19,160
Ass-tastic you wouldn't even believe

1859
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:25,160
The best thing about playing Street Fighter 2 the movie the game though is playing as Kami

1860
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,400
to address

1861
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:32,680
Anita you actually cannot buy them army surplus anymore because they're meant to they have to be destroyed

1862
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:35,280
Okay

1863
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:38,280
People are asking me stuff and I can't read the chat room.

1864
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:41,280
Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game, they have to see it.

1865
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:44,280
I'll relay if there's any other stuff.

1866
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:46,280
You'll have to buy your own M60.

1867
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:47,280
Okay.

1868
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:48,280
Alright.

1869
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:53,280
But another F.U. goes toward how long it's going to take for me to get done with school.

1870
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:57,280
Because I'm probably going to be done, um, probably...

1871
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:01,280
If I can do it right 2006, which is going to, um...

1872
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:05,840
I mean it's an okay thing because that means that I have more time to get in shape and

1873
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:12,560
everything but I'm still planning on going into the Air Force Reserves so once I lose

1874
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:18,560
a little bit more weight but I just didn't want to have to wait another two years instead

1875
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:21,660
of one so it's pissing me off.

1876
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:26,960
And another SU to Alabama for being so far away because I want to go home.

1877
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:31,560
There's, there's certain places that I want to visit, certain places that, certain people

1878
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:32,560
I want to see.

1879
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:33,560
And I'm broke.

1880
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:34,560
And I have no time off.

1881
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:37,560
I have two days off for the rest of the year.

1882
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:40,760
Not counting, though, the one day where I have to get to the dentist.

1883
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:44,480
That means I can't get sick, because I got sick right at the beginning of the year.

1884
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:47,600
I had all that surgery and all this other crap.

1885
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:52,840
And then also, I need more days off so that I can do other stuff next year that I want

1886
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:54,400
to do.

1887
02:17:54,400 --> 02:18:01,400
F you to me having to wait for two weeks to get my laptop, because I want it now.

1888
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:06,400
See, it's okay to be impatient about getting a laptop, because your laptops are cool.

1889
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:10,400
But I found a pretty one getting this nice tajitsu with the DVD-R,

1890
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:14,400
so I can finally burn off all the crap on my hard drive and reformat,

1891
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:17,400
because I'm going to have to start sharing it with Dan,

1892
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:23,400
because he turned his computer into a main machine, built into a pole position.

1893
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:24,900
you're going to see tonight

1894
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:26,980
longest you've taken your at least for a while

1895
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:28,140
and for a while

1896
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:29,500
i don't know i'm just

1897
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:31,740
you know what it is okay

1898
02:18:31,740 --> 02:18:33,740
you're a very old

1899
02:18:33,740 --> 02:18:34,700
set up

1900
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:39,300
that excuse for women being upset

1901
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:42,220
you know i love you

1902
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:45,720
and bumpy kick your ass

1903
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:49,380
i got to do the right thing i've ever seen that he was cute i have to say

1904
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:51,300
that if i do you in the movie

1905
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:52,620
thank you

1906
02:18:52,620 --> 02:18:55,000
oh my god though i mean

1907
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,620
well i i i think any

1908
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:59,740
street fighter to the movie the game

1909
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:03,620
yeah i love how they play little clips from the movie and everything

1910
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:09,260
you know i don't think that it was all of that bad

1911
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:10,300
and it was

1912
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:14,160
the movie was that the game is actually kind of okay to play

1913
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:18,340
i thought it was very funny

1914
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:24,100
at the chat and i think that this is an area webcam or something like that

1915
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:30,340
all right anyway anymore if you seem to me

1916
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:31,820
i have and at the end

1917
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:35,300
you um...

1918
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,420
man just

1919
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:38,700
uh... okay just

1920
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:44,700
i think at the end

1921
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:45,900
i haven't at the

1922
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:48,140
you uh... politics

1923
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:50,780
and military

1924
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:53,840
i have a big f you go to go to q r o

1925
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:56,960
because they're doing a uh... storage white

1926
02:19:56,960 --> 02:19:58,780
let me know that i had been

1927
02:19:58,780 --> 02:20:02,040
seventy eight different individual items

1928
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:05,120
among four characters on q r o

1929
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:09,860
and then i tried to freakin then so i can get rid of some of my shit

1930
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:11,380
it wouldn't let me then instead

1931
02:20:11,380 --> 02:20:14,920
it just wouldn't let said i don't know that no and i had to pay the items that

1932
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:18,920
other people are vending so this is really pissing me off. Do I have to have a vending license to

1933
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:23,920
vendor this crap? Because I can make so much zenny in that game but no. And then

1934
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:28,920
an F.U. goes toward me not being able to afford to do Final Fantasy 11 because I'm going to start playing again and also

1935
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:33,920
with my laptop I'd be able to keep typing to people while I'm playing Final Fantasy 11 but now I can't do it so it's really pissing me off and

1936
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:38,920
I'm out of breath.

1937
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:43,280
I'm having to like write this all down to follow I'm

1938
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:46,680
I am and if you do

1939
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:53,680
bad-tasting but perfectly textured low-carb cheesecake

1940
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:58,840
and any more I'm waiting and all right they're moving on low-key

1941
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:02,560
wait what nevermind moving

1942
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:06,320
land let's see who's our Mr. Yeses

1943
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:07,320
Hey Jonas, alright.

1944
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:09,320
No, just during this video part of the show too.

1945
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:12,320
Alright, uh, let's get to, uh, Loki's part.

1946
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:17,320
First off, fuck you, the crack whores that try to cut me off when the lanes are merging.

1947
02:21:17,320 --> 02:21:20,320
Okay, so I was driving to take, um, my fiancee home.

1948
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:24,320
Okay, and the lanes are merging, we've already established, you know, it's already one lane,

1949
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:27,320
and we're just, like, coming together, you know, to be in parallel.

1950
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:28,320
So what does that bitch do?

1951
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:33,320
She tries to cut around me through a double yellow on the opposite side of the street,

1952
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:35,320
like, going the wrong direction.

1953
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:39,400
through there and like passes me up to get behind this really slow guy that's

1954
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:45,360
in front of me I'm like what the hell so I flipped her off as I went by and tried

1955
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:48,760
yelling at her but you know she was ahead of me so she probably couldn't hear me over my

1956
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:53,360
music but um yeah it was she was a dumb bitch I normally don't flip people off I

1957
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:58,880
just yell but this bitch pushed me that far so fuck you to her and fuck you to

1958
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:03,360
cosplayers they're fucking ugly okay if you're a big fat whore you don't need to

1959
02:22:03,360 --> 02:22:06,380
dressing up like an anime character doesn't make you hotter doesn't make you

1960
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:11,080
any cooler it just makes you ugly and stupid looking and if you're if you're a

1961
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:16,400
hairy man please don't cosplay Yuna yes I really I hate you know seeing these

1962
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:20,520
ugly ass people cosplaying we don't need any more ugly people in the world to die

1963
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:24,280
one thing in defense I think that if you don't have the body to do like the

1964
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:28,720
scantily clad on a matrix that's one thing the last time I checked

1965
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:30,880
um... you didn't have a gut

1966
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:33,040
himself

1967
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:33,820
anyway

1968
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:35,920
and all of us in the building

1969
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:37,240
there's a lot of heat

1970
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:38,840
not part of the group

1971
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:40,680
figure out

1972
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:42,440
and uh...

1973
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:46,480
all that you know what do you know that that will anything which is retarded

1974
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:50,400
okay it was just a really were a waste of my time you know the overcharging

1975
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:50,960
stuff

1976
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:53,840
last time i checked you know i don't think people are quite anything to do

1977
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:58,240
anime but you know hey that she was there too

1978
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:00,760
and also it's just uh... plane

1979
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:03,940
but you know i can't make it because for some reason the wheels are saying the

1980
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:05,640
push through the bottom of course

1981
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:08,080
not good if i want to move this thing

1982
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:12,160
said like on a lower at pedestal right now i think i thought

1983
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:14,280
and then uh...

1984
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:16,540
but you know what they thought the mall

1985
02:23:16,540 --> 02:23:19,840
i think i could just get younger and younger

1986
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:22,840
just all these what's out there if they were never around when i was in the

1987
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:25,600
interior high that really fucked

1988
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:29,240
and that's it

1989
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:30,720
uh...

1990
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:37,720
i'm going back to my old f u song because it was better bumblebee

1991
02:23:39,940 --> 02:23:42,720
f u to uh...

1992
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:46,200
lehigh county in pennsylvania for being so god damn boring

1993
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:49,840
although you know i ask you to myself for not being more proactive about

1994
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:52,320
finding things to do

1995
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:55,340
i think next time when i go back because i'm gonna have to go back eventually

1996
02:23:55,340 --> 02:24:01,180
I'll be better prepared for it because I'm going to look up where I can go nerd out and play DDR and stuff, so I'll have a better time.

1997
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:07,340
But they did have one gay bar there, which I went to, and FU'd to the fact that there were only like 30 people in the whole place,

1998
02:24:07,340 --> 02:24:10,300
considering this is the only gay bar for like hundreds of miles around town.

1999
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:13,660
But whatever, what can you do?

2000
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:19,020
Also, I'd like to give an FU for coming home and thinking the TV was stolen,

2001
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:24,660
and then realizing that Loki had taken the TV and put it in the machine. What?

2002
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:26,480
yet he'd been liberated

2003
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:28,140
but i ask you to add

2004
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:30,860
my future friends reaction when they come in this house realize you have to

2005
02:24:30,860 --> 02:24:31,900
watch movies

2006
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:34,060
uh... in an arcade machine

2007
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:37,820
telling differently about that are figured out

2008
02:24:37,820 --> 02:24:40,780
i think it's interesting

2009
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:45,320
very interesting uh... at the ud to the fact that at your working ten to twelve

2010
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:47,700
hour days because i guess really old after a while

2011
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:51,620
and um... at the beginning on salary so you know the time for it

2012
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:53,940
uh... and that's about it

2013
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:59,180
that's really all i have to say i'm i'm always the left a few ones of the bunch

2014
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:01,660
anyway let's move on and uh... see what

2015
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:03,580

2016
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:07,000
other folks in the room here so i have to say anything i get

2017

rio kosaka

2020
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:16,340

2021
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:19,020
uh... damn okay at the end of the song

2022
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:19,980

2024
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:23,700

2029
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:33,300
and then the minute i

2030
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:35,500
she walks in the door

2031
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:37,960
she instantly starts being a bitch

2032
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:39,360

2033
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:40,460

2039
02:25:51,860 --> 02:25:56,820
she could have some of my Smirnoff shit that was at my party and leaving it in my mom's

02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:59,060
room and stuff.

FuckTower for having such great sales and making me buy even more toys.

They had a three day sale this week that was 25% off all their toys and I purchased twice

02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Remember, it's a three hour show.

2080
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Don't worry, I don't have that many F's this time.

2081
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Yeah, we gotta turn, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2082
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Back your mic up a little bit.

2083
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Is it really that loud?

2084
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Yes, yes it is.

2085
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2086
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Okay.

2087
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
F you to me for being wrong last minute this whole week.

2088
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:09,000
God, showing up to work like fifteen minutes late is not good.

2089
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Anybody heard about the Biggest Field California Tournament?

2090
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
No.

2091
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,000
What's this?

2092
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Good, because I went to hell, so I'm going to give an FU to some of the organizers for not looking up how tournaments are supposed to be run.

2093
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Because you know how tournaments are done by PA, right?

2094
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Right.

2095
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
They did it by score.

2096
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Oh dear.

2097
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:42,000
There's a lot of problems with that, and they're not taking constructive criticism from other people, which is another bad thing.

2098
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
That's not a good sign.

2099
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:48,000
They think it's all good and everything, but there are some flaws that they should listen to.

2100
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:55,000
On the other hand, FV2 sent people who tried to ruin the tournament for two hours.

2101
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I heard rumors about a two-hour delay on that tournament.

2102
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'll say FV2 really screwed up my tournament.

2103
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,960
Even though I've heard rumors it was in Zumel 469

2104
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:08,940
The winner did the same thing to my tournament

2105
02:29:08,940 --> 02:29:11,800
And if that's true, he's banned out of my tournament

2106
02:29:12,300 --> 02:29:13,860
I'm serious cuz nobody

2107
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:16,320
Should be banning a tournament for THAT long

2108
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:18,580
Screwing a tournament for 2 hours is not fun

2109
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:20,220
Especially when people have

2110
02:29:20,220 --> 02:29:21,880
To drive all the way back

2111
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:25,800
from San Francisco, California or Fresno or even SoCal

2112
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:28,220
Just to go to the tournament to late on getting—

2113
02:29:28,220 --> 02:29:30,380
Delayed for a whole while and getting pissed off because

2114
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:31,760
Blahblahblah

2115
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:33,420
WAAAHwhahwha

2116
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:35,420
Wham, my pussy hurts, wham.

2117
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:36,420
Yeah, damn pussy.

2118
02:29:36,420 --> 02:29:39,420
Here's the thing, get this right, you guys.

2119
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:41,420
If you don't like the rules of the tournament, don't go.

2120
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:42,420
It's simple as that.

2121
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:47,420
If you go to the tournament and you know the rules are fucked up, and you go, you gotta argue, you're just causing some trouble.

2122
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:51,420
Now what would you let it do?

2123
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:53,420
Would you do something like that, dumb skye? Or?

2124
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:55,420
No, but I'll prob-

2125
02:29:55,420 --> 02:30:02,420
Sacramento's so sad now at Bomani, I'm probably not even gonna ever run a tournament or even help run a tournament ever again, so we'll see.

2126
02:30:02,420 --> 02:30:06,420
I mean, I'll still run tournaments, regardless of what's going on and stuff.

2127
02:30:06,420 --> 02:30:09,420
But I would never run one by score, that's for sure.

2128
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:12,420
I know, that's one thing. Never run by score.

2129
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:14,420
Let's see...

2130
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:18,420
F you to squirrels for eating my damn food from camping.

2131
02:30:19,420 --> 02:30:20,420
I don't...

2132
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:28,420
Seeing a bunch of spit all over the damn steak that I've cooked for two hours and shit is not good.

2133
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:32,420
Therefore, even though I whipped the living shit out of those squirrels,

2134
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:35,420
I'm not sure if you all saw this whip right here.

2135
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:37,420
Did you borrow that from Aaron?

2136
02:30:37,420 --> 02:30:41,420
No, this is mine, dammit! I told you that I have my own whip.

2137
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:45,420
I should have showed Aaron this whip, I'm not sure if she's interested.

2138
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:52,420
An amputee getting bit by- bit by ass by ants during camping.

2139
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:55,420
Ouch.

2140
02:30:55,420 --> 02:30:57,420
No fucking comment on that one.

2141
02:30:57,420 --> 02:30:57,920
Alright.

2142
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:01,420
And after you for losing my toothbrush during camping.

2143
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:04,420
Not brushing your teeth for two days sucks.

2144
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:05,420
Maybe a bear stole it.

2145
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:08,420
Speaking of that, I saw a bear during camping.

2146
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:10,420
Did you see Bigfoot?

2147
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:12,420
Yes, I saw a Bigfoot. I did not get eaten.

2148
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:15,420
He was just walking around sniffing on those pussies and stuff.

2149
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:18,420
That's okay.

2150
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:23,420
Was he pussyfooting around?

2151
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:25,420
Yes, he was pussyfooting around.

2152
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:32,420
around. Um, and F you for the horse for fucking sweeping the tail that he took a shit on in

2153
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:39,900

2154
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:46,900

Blown away by an emulator, the real time is 55 minutes, taking down to 47 minutes.

2193
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:22,280
Hmm. Interesting.

2194
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:26,280

02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:29,380
Alright, VidPowess says F you to the whole www.ilovebees.com hype for Halo 2.

2206
02:35:29,380 --> 02:35:31,000

We're near the end of the camp. Okay, anyways.

2214
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:01,760
Alright.

2215
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:10,760
Okay, uh, gosh, let's see. I guess at this time we're going to go to another break.

2216
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:12,760
And then we're going to come back and...

2217
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:15,760
What do you guys want to do? Do you want to do some Ask Orange Lounge, or do we have...

2218
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:17,760
Alright, sure, why not. We'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2219
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:19,760
On the Skypline.

2220
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:21,760
Yeah, we'll do... We'll open up the Skypline, and folks...

2221
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:24,900
And we'll open up the skype lines for comments as well and some Ask Orange Lounge to close

2222
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:25,900
out the show.

2223
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:29,160
Meanwhile, I'm going to pick some songs that sound cool for the Popin' Eleven soundtrack.

2224
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:33,080
I'm going to pick some on my own, because I know I want to play the Orange Airport song.

2225
02:36:33,080 --> 02:36:35,800
I definitely want to play that, the Orange Lounge song.

2226
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:41,320
And I'm going to play that one because it's called Space Dog.

2227
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:42,320
Oh, and it's Sana.

2228
02:36:42,320 --> 02:36:43,320
Cool.

2229
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:44,320
I didn't even know that.

2230
02:36:44,320 --> 02:36:54,560
I'll play, okay then I'm going to go back to number one then get some of the short ones.

2231
02:36:54,560 --> 02:37:01,200
Let's do, wow that has a really, oh we already heard that one.

2232
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:02,200
I don't know, what do you think?

2233
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:03,200
Um, oh wait.

2234
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:04,200
Oh, Hillbilly!

2235
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:05,200
I want to hear Hillbilly.

2236
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:09,480
All right, we're going to do Hillbilly.

2237
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:12,920
Okay so these are the songs I'm going to play this break from Popin' Music 11.

2238
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:18,000
We're going to hear Orange Lounge with Orange Airline, Sauna with Space Dog, and Taisho

2239
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,040
in the hillbilly genre with PaLaLa42.

2240
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:23,260
This should be interesting.

2241
02:37:23,260 --> 02:37:26,620
Send your questions in for Ask Orange Lounge, and then we're going to wrap up the show when

2242
02:37:26,620 --> 02:37:27,620
we come back.

2243
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:28,620
Enjoy.

2244
02:37:58,620 --> 02:38:00,620
Oh

2245
02:39:28,620 --> 02:39:43,620
And the bay door, oh bay store, To land where the remover's come,

2246
02:39:43,620 --> 02:39:51,620
Can you hear me, oh bay store, The earth is shining through,

2247
02:39:51,620 --> 02:39:56,120
So fable, fable

2248
02:39:56,120 --> 02:40:00,120
You take my blood and I know

2249
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:02,620
You can hear me

2250
02:40:02,620 --> 02:40:04,620
I'm fable

2251
02:40:04,620 --> 02:40:09,620
You're far enough to fly away

2252
02:40:09,620 --> 02:40:13,620
I remember the time

2253
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:18,120
When I walked home

2254
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:26,120
He was watching to me, in the games that made me glad

2255
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:34,120
One day he told to me, I thought that you were dead

2256
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:44,120
I let him go, he was my friend, never mind your people and I

2257
02:40:44,120 --> 02:40:49,120
Hello there, hello there, hello there.

2258
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:53,120
Nothing but the only one.

2259
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:58,120
Can you hear me, hello there.

2260
02:40:58,120 --> 02:41:02,120
You're the only one in the light.

2261
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:06,120
Hello there, hello there.

2262
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:10,120
It's too easy for you to hold on tight.

2263
02:41:10,120 --> 02:41:14,620
Don't hate on me, I'm afraid it's true

2264
02:41:14,620 --> 02:41:22,620
I don't care if you love me, I care if you love me, I care if you love me

2265
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:19,200
Orange Lounge Radio,

2266
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:22,200
Bimani Music, and more.

2267
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:28,000
All right, we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio, and the last fifteen

2268
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:28,840
minutes of the show,

2269
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:32,080
this is where we usually open it up to ask Orange Lounge

2270
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:36,120
some questions. Also, the Skypline's open...

2271
02:43:36,120 --> 02:43:41,180
I'm sorry? Oh, okay. And also, the Skypline we open up at this time in case you have a

2272
02:43:41,180 --> 02:43:43,320
question you want to ask us over the Skypline,

2273
02:43:43,320 --> 02:43:46,680
or you just have a general comment on something we've talked about

2274
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:50,280
previously in the show as we kind of wind things down. But we're going to start off with some

2275
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:57,000
Ask Orange Lounge.

2276
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:00,160
Let's Ask Orange Lounge. Some stupid question.

2277
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:03,920
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2278
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:07,560
I know I have a question. One thing I want to find out.

2279
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:11,560
Why is Loki playing a game where guys are shaving other guys?

2280
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:22,560
Question number one comes from StupidBaka

2281
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:25,560
Where did you go when you were out of town?

2282
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:28,560
I went to Allentown, Pennsylvania

2283
02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:31,560
which is about an hour north of Philadelphia

2284
02:44:31,560 --> 02:44:34,560
and it's very green out there

2285
02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:38,400
and there's a restaurant called friendlies which is which is cute

2286
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:41,380
which i think is actually a chain out there i don't know i'm so

2287
02:44:41,380 --> 02:44:44,140
like there's probably east coast people listening to show going

2288
02:44:44,140 --> 02:44:48,940
nothing special last time i was on the east coast there was that roy rogers place that was utter crap

2289
02:44:48,940 --> 02:44:53,660
i went to cracker barrel and that place owns

2290
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:57,080
and i i have clove candy sticks from cracker barrel in my room

2291
02:44:57,080 --> 02:44:59,220
because they got me some as a going away present

2292
02:44:59,220 --> 02:45:01,780
thank you so much to the folks i know that of course they would never listen to the show

2293
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:03,780
But the folks out there were so good to me.

2294
02:45:03,780 --> 02:45:05,780
I mean, they made that town bearable, honestly.

2295
02:45:05,780 --> 02:45:08,780
And, uh, they bought me gifts and stuff, so that was great.

2296
02:45:08,780 --> 02:45:11,780
Uh, Stupid Baka also wants to know, and I can't believe somebody's asking this, but...

2297
02:45:11,780 --> 02:45:13,780
What is MAME?

2298
02:45:13,780 --> 02:45:15,780
What?

2299
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:17,780
It's the Multi Arcade Machine Emulator.

2300
02:45:17,780 --> 02:45:19,780
Caller, hold on a minute. I'll get to you in a minute.

2301
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:22,780
But, uh, what is MAME is the person wants to know.

2302
02:45:24,780 --> 02:45:26,780
Oh, they hung up. Oh well.

2303
02:45:26,780 --> 02:45:28,780
What is MAME?

2304
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:39,380
multi arcade machine emulator and what does it do it emulates multiple arcade

2305
02:45:39,380 --> 02:45:45,460
machines all right it's good stuff though I'm gonna call the person back to

2306
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:52,460
just

2307
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:55,460
i think he's busy now

2308
02:45:55,460 --> 02:45:58,280
but that

2309
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:00,360
alright that

2310
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:02,800
will see if he goes back

2311
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:03,780
uh...

2312
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:08,180
moving i will go to number two question

2313
02:46:08,180 --> 02:46:10,260
number two question i

2314
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:13,860
yakki wants to know or diaqui torah or maybe just or i don't know

2315
02:46:13,860 --> 02:46:14,920
here's a question

2316
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:17,360
Why is Jamie so damn angsty tonight?

2317
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:20,520
Her rants were as long as the horror of the village.

2318
02:46:20,520 --> 02:46:22,920
The village was good!

2319
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:27,640
I can't help it if the majority of people who saw that movie didn't stop to think about it,

2320
02:46:27,640 --> 02:46:28,720
but still,

2321
02:46:28,720 --> 02:46:31,320
it was a very good movie, okay?

2322
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:35,120
Alright, well moving on, why are you so angsty tonight? Is that why you're so angsty, or...?

2323
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:40,880
No, I'm angsty for other, other reasons.

2324
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:42,360
Many of them.

2325
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:46,000
many reasons many reasons it's ok to be angry once in a while

2326
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:50,420
it's this time of year is when i get really horribly angsty like that which is weird because with

2327
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:52,920
me i'm

2328
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:54,600
torah would just like to point out

2329
02:46:54,600 --> 02:46:57,240
they've actually never seen the village they were just saying that's rufflesome

2330
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:00,000
feathers well then go see it

2331
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,520
it's a good movie

2332
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:03,420
alright

2333
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:04,540
it was a

2334
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:07,720
not just a good movie it was an excellent it was a movie

2335
02:47:07,720 --> 02:47:08,840
it was a very

2336
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:11,080
smart movie okay uh... it was

2337
02:47:11,080 --> 02:47:12,320
sharks girl says

2338
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:18,760
I thought about the movie and I still thought it sucked.

2339
02:47:18,760 --> 02:47:21,520
Then you obviously didn't watch it with the right frame of mind.

2340
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:22,520
Well.

2341
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:25,000
It wasn't intended to scare.

2342
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:28,620
I think it's getting mixed reviews so it's probably just getting mixed feedback from

2343
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:30,220
everybody you know.

2344
02:47:30,220 --> 02:47:32,160
It wasn't scary, it was very good.

2345
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:34,720
It was the type of movie I was right in the mood to see.

2346
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:38,140
I don't see but now I'm kind of like I've heard so many like negative things but I've

2347
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:41,800
heard some good things but I'm kind of like now maybe I'll wait for video.

2348
02:47:41,800 --> 02:47:42,800
I don't know.

2349
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,800
Okay, Rob.

2350
02:47:43,800 --> 02:47:46,880
You are going to go see it with me and I'm going to pay for you to see it.

2351
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:48,480
Well, hey, free movie.

2352
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:49,480
All right.

2353
02:47:49,480 --> 02:47:50,480
I'll let you guys know what I thought.

2354
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:51,480
We'll see.

2355
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:52,480
We'll see.

2356
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:53,480
All right.

2357
02:47:53,480 --> 02:47:54,480
Moving on.

2358
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:55,480
Let's see.

2359
02:47:55,480 --> 02:47:58,480
I got his questions.

2360
02:47:58,480 --> 02:48:07,240
Kyle, our old buddy, Kyle Snyder, wants to know, I've decided that for the next few songs

2361
02:48:07,240 --> 02:48:11,200
I want to work on, I want to move away from techno and trance.

2362
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:18,600
Would you want me to work on some genres that involve vocals like house, two-step, and jazz?

2363
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:23,440
Or should I do some non-vocal genres like drum and bass, progressive, and big beat?

2364
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:25,880
I would love to hear some drum and bass.

2365
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:29,280
I like drum and bass too, but I would like to hear some two-step from Kyle, actually.

2366
02:48:29,280 --> 02:48:33,880
I think that would be kind of cool.

2367
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:36,000
That would be kind of neat, I think.

2368
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:37,000
We'll see.

2369
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:42,560
Alright, um, but I guess does anybody else have any feedback for Trump?

2370
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:43,560
Anybody?

2371
02:48:43,560 --> 02:48:44,560
Anybody?

2372
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:45,560
Alright.

2373
02:48:45,560 --> 02:48:46,560
Fine.

2374
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:47,560
Keep it to yourselves.

2375
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:53,080
DDRholic wants to know, do you still love me Rob?

2376
02:48:53,080 --> 02:48:56,240
The answer is yes.

2377
02:48:56,240 --> 02:49:00,240
Just like Whitney Houston, I will always love you.

2378
02:49:00,240 --> 02:49:04,760
That was my rendition of Whitney.

2379
02:49:04,760 --> 02:49:06,320
I've been moved Rob.

2380
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:10,320
I know. At least my stomach moved a little.

2381
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:14,320
Let's see...

2382
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:18,320
Somebody in the chat room wants to say, uh, what is Two Step exactly?

2383
02:49:18,320 --> 02:49:22,320
What is Two Step exactly? Play some, uh...

2384
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:26,320
I would say, like, Jack and Mark get busy, kinda.

2385
02:49:26,320 --> 02:49:30,320
You know what's the funny thing about Two Step?

2386
02:49:30,320 --> 02:49:34,320
British people claim they're the only people who can make Two Step.

2387
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:38,240
can only make trip hop because we're just supposed to be being making down

2388
02:49:38,240 --> 02:49:42,160
tempo because there's supposed to be a difference

2389
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:50,400
yeah all right skype line is still open if you want to give us a call we'll see

2390
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:55,720
if anybody wants to call oh well in the meantime we have another question vid

2391
02:49:55,720 --> 02:50:00,920
palace says speaking of maim what is your favorite classic arcade konami

2392
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:05,720
game? Mine is the Simpsons. This is a good question. Super Konami World. We're all a

2393
02:50:05,720 --> 02:50:09,840
bunch of Konami whores. Super Konami World. What's that one all about? It was a game where

2394
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:15,640
they took a bunch of other Konami games and made them into one game like these two people

2395
02:50:15,640 --> 02:50:19,760
made it into the Konami universe or something. There were two of them. They were kind of

2396
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:26,360
fun. Alright. Now that I think about it, I think they came out on like the Sonic-Con

2397
02:50:26,360 --> 02:50:34,080
too. Way back when. Uh, anybody else care to answer this one? Bud. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes,

2398
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:43,720
Jamie? Twinbee. Twinbee. Oh, okay. Bud. Stop standing on the cable. It's hazardous for

2399
02:50:43,720 --> 02:50:47,960
us both. I can't stand the symptoms because I worked at a place that had it for two years

2400
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:54,500
and that's all I would hear every day. Was Bart and Lisa screaming. Like when they do

2401
02:50:54,500 --> 02:50:56,500
that thing when they were running through it?

2402
02:50:56,500 --> 02:50:57,500
Yes.

2403
02:50:57,500 --> 02:50:58,500
Ahh!

2404
02:50:58,500 --> 02:50:59,500
Ahh!

2405
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:00,500
And that's what it sounded like.

2406
02:51:00,500 --> 02:51:01,500
Yes.

2407
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:02,500
It sounded like a screaming baby.

2408
02:51:02,500 --> 02:51:03,500
Yes, when I worked him out in mics.

2409
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:05,560
Do they have any shoot-em-ups?

2410
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:11,320
My favorite classic, and then going back to classic classic Konami arcade game, motherfucking

2411
02:51:11,320 --> 02:51:14,880
Time Pilot is my favorite classic arcade game by Konami.

2412
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:15,880
Time Pilot.

2413
02:51:15,880 --> 02:51:18,280
Gradius, what was the second one, Life Force?

2414
02:51:18,280 --> 02:51:19,280
Gradius...

2415
02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:29,040
It was Life Force on the NES in America, but it was Salamander in the arcade in Japan.

2416
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:33,760
I didn't go to the arcade in Japan, I just played it on the NES, and yeah, Life Force

2417
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:34,760
is cool.

2418
02:51:34,760 --> 02:51:35,760
Alrighty.

2419
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:36,760
No.

2420
02:51:36,760 --> 02:51:41,240
I don't care if you're the motherfucking host.

2421
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:45,280
Ooh, bugged in Dark Sakura having a fight.

2422
02:51:45,280 --> 02:51:49,120
But you're holding your hand like it's a gun.

2423
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:54,120
I'll give her my mic if you're not careful.

2424
02:51:54,120 --> 02:52:01,120
Parodius. Actually, specifically, O'Shaubary Parodius.

2425
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:06,120
Garrett, I know you're a big Konami horror. What other Konami arcade game classic ones

2426
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:07,120
are your favorite?

2427
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:10,120
I didn't really... I mean, you know, I never really got to play a lot of arcade games when

2428
02:52:10,120 --> 02:52:15,120
I was a kid. The ones I did play, I don't remember who made them. Yeah, it's kind of

2429
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:16,120
sad.

2430
02:52:16,120 --> 02:52:18,120
And somebody did say Parodius.

2431
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:24,120
They, uh, just say, like, I don't know, what else is Konami? I'm trying to think of, like,

2432
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:25,120
the old-school Konami games.

2433
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:26,120
I could only think of...

2434
02:52:26,120 --> 02:52:30,240
Uh, Track and Field. Just say Track and Field. I love Track and Field!

2435
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:33,040
I could only think of the damn Capcom fighting games.

2436
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:37,600
All right. They actually have a lot of games. Like, I think Konami was involved with Frogger

2437
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:43,000
at one point. But all I know is they didn't make Burger Time, so, sorry, guys.

2438
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:47,760
More questions from our chat room. EvilNauke2DX wants to know, he just said,

2439
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:51,680
I have a question. Oh, here it is. What is that game being played on the webcam right

2440
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:58,280
now with all the naked anime ladies? It's Gals Panic. It's simply just Gals Panic, not

2441
02:52:58,280 --> 02:53:06,080
Gals Panic 95 or anything like that? Logie says Gals Panic Super S2 is the one he's playing

2442
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:11,720
right now. And it's beating his ass. He's on a really advanced stage at this point,

2443
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:22,080
isn't he? I don't know. We'll see. Alright. I guess at this point, it's almost time to

2444
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:25,640
kind of wrap up the show, but I was hoping that somebody would call in on the Skype line,

2445
02:53:25,640 --> 02:53:36,160
but we didn't get anybody. Boo! Boo to that. Nobody has a question. I cry. I see how it

2446
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:43,440
is. All right. I'm trying to see how long the fortune cookie is tonight. I think it's

2447
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:49,880
a longer one. Yeah, it is. So we'll probably start to wrap up the show here since nobody's

2448
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:56,680
calling us on the Skype line. I guess let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2449
02:53:56,680 --> 02:54:00,200
I'm going to shut off the Skype line since nobody's using it. All right. Let's go around

2450
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:03,040
and get everybody's final thoughts. Thank you very much for those that participated

2451
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:10,040
in tonight's Ask Orange Lounge. Meanwhile, final thoughts time. Umm, Bud, final thought.

2452
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:18,080
Thank you, that was lovely. Final thought from Jonas.

2453
02:54:18,080 --> 02:54:25,080
Sucks to be late. Are you here to plug anything tonight since you were late? Do you have anything

2454
02:54:25,400 --> 02:54:30,380
you want to plug while you're here? Well, not really. That school's about to start soon

2455
02:54:30,380 --> 02:54:37,380
in a stay fair. It's coming up soon. That's practically all.

2456
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:43,300
I thought maybe you had like an attorney or a sim file or something, but I wouldn't be

2457
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:45,340
playing school. Oh, well I do have, I'm supposed to release

2458
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:48,580
that for no revenge, the one that Loki was asking for me to do.

2459
02:54:48,580 --> 02:54:50,140
Didn't somebody already do that? Yeah.

2460
02:54:50,140 --> 02:54:56,080
Pimari Warrior, I've checked the sim file itself. It's not really that great to download

2461
02:54:56,080 --> 02:55:00,980
If you're in- if it's- cuz the sympho that Pimani Williams made was a little too repetitive

2462
02:55:00,980 --> 02:55:08,640
and inconsistent pattern-wise, cuz me and MJ are supposed to make the sympho by now,

2463
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:11,520
I'm not sure if Loki- Loki, didn't you say you wanted to do the background?

2464
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:14,120
No, you can do whatever you want.

2465
02:55:14,120 --> 02:55:15,120
Okay.

2466
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:18,120
Okay, I guess I'll do it.

2467
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:19,120
Alright.

2468
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:20,120
Alright.

2469
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:23,440
Garrett, your final thought, thanks for coming tonight by the way, and bringing us pop and

2470
02:55:23,440 --> 02:55:24,440
music stuff.

2471
02:55:24,440 --> 02:55:25,440
What's your final thought?

2472
02:55:25,440 --> 02:55:37,440
LOKI I WANT ANIMAL COOKIES AND THERE'S NONE LEFT

2473
02:55:37,440 --> 02:55:51,440
CRUMS IRISH CAR BOMBS MAKE MY STOMACH SAD

2474
02:55:51,440 --> 02:55:53,440
But they were very good.

2475
02:55:53,440 --> 02:55:55,440
Jamie?

2476
02:55:55,440 --> 02:55:59,440
My final thought is I'm going to go home and have some ice cream.

2477
02:55:59,440 --> 02:56:02,440
Mmm, ice cream.

2478
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:04,440
Mmm, ice cream is good.

2479
02:56:04,440 --> 02:56:07,440
Okay, uh, final word of the show tonight.

2480
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:09,440
Let's, um, I'm going to give it to Garrett.

2481
02:56:09,440 --> 02:56:11,440
You can have the final word of tonight's show. What do you want to say?

2482
02:56:11,440 --> 02:56:14,440
That's why I said home. I don't know.

2483
02:56:14,440 --> 02:56:16,440
One word.

2484
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:26,200

2503
02:58:10,980 --> 02:58:14,580
bran, I go to the bathroom for three and a half hours. I have another bowl of oat bran,

2504
02:58:14,580 --> 02:58:19,380
I go back in the bathroom for six more hours, all I do is eat and shit, I'm gonna live forever.

2505
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:24,540
My colon is the strongest muscle in my body right now. I could pass Elvis through my colon

2506
02:58:24,540 --> 02:58:31,600
right now. And all these cereals they have, crackling oat bran and horking fiber chunks,

2507
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:35,280
you know. Cereal used to come with free prizes, now it comes with a free roll of toilet paper

2508
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:38,920
in every box. Guys get up on Sunday morning, forget about the New York Times, I'm gonna

2509
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:43,280
need the Bible, I got a big one brewing here. Dad, there's a phone call, I'm on Genesis

2510
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:48,720
god damn it. You tell them the call back after the creation. People checking their own feces

2511
02:58:48,720 --> 02:58:56,040
for fiber, you have too much free fucking time on your hands, okay? Red meat, white

2512
02:58:56,040 --> 02:59:00,240
meat, blue meat, meat, oh fucking rama, you will eat it. Because not eating meat is a

2513
02:59:00,240 --> 02:59:04,640
decision, eating meat is an instinct. Yeah, and I know what it's about. I don't want to

2514
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:10,080
to me because I love the animals. I love the animals. I love the animals too. I love my dog.

2515
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:16,160
He's so cute. He's so cute. There's the problem. We only want to save the cute animals, don't we?

2516
02:59:16,160 --> 02:59:20,000
Yeah. Why don't we just have animal auditions? Line them up one by one and interview them

2517
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:24,480
individually. What are you? I'm an otter. And what do you do? I swim around on my back and do cute

2518
02:59:24,480 --> 02:59:32,080
little human things with my hands. You're free to go. And what are you? I'm a cow. Get in the

02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:37,600

2523
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:56,320

2529
03:00:21,360 --> 03:00:28,160
Now, personally, I think Mama Cass said it best when she said,

2530
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:28,660
Ah!

2531
03:00:28,660 --> 03:00:29,160
Ah!

2532
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:29,660
Ah!

2533
03:00:29,660 --> 03:00:30,160
Ah!

2534
03:00:30,160 --> 03:00:30,660
Ah!

2535
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:31,160
Ah!

2536
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:31,660
Ah!

2537
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:38,160

Ah!

2546
03:00:44,160 --> 03:01:10,160
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2547
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:26,000
The afterbirth, the part of the show that happens after the credits fade out, and we're

2548
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:30,560
back for our final epilogue. You know it's funny when that fortune cookie was playing,

2549
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:32,920
somebody in the chat room said, this is Jamie's doing, isn't it?

2550
03:01:32,920 --> 03:01:36,240
I always pick the fortune cookie. Yeah, Jamie picks almost all of our fortune

2551
03:01:36,240 --> 03:01:39,280
cookies. I think maybe like one time I got to pick one.

2552
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:42,080
I remember when we used to think of pre-recording them.

2553
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:47,000
Yeah, we used to. But this is more fun. But that was a long one! But Dennis Leary's cool,

2554
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:47,640
so it doesn't matter.

2555
03:01:47,640 --> 03:01:48,920
I've played longer.

2556
03:01:48,920 --> 03:01:50,280
I know. I know.

2557
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:52,360
Aww, it's naked with a horse.

2558
03:01:52,360 --> 03:01:56,440
One of our Orange Lounge buddies wanted us to call them while we had a chance here over

2559
03:01:56,440 --> 03:02:01,640
the Skype line, so I'm going to go ahead and give her a call here. Hopefully it'll work.

2560
03:02:01,640 --> 03:02:04,640
Let's see if it works. I'm going to see if she answers.

2561
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:19,080
No problem with the remote sound device. Oh, that sucks. Well, I'll open up the Skype line

2562
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:24,000
for an after birth call if somebody wants to call us. We'll see. Otherwise, what are

2563
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,360
your big plans for this next week? Anything exciting?

2564
03:02:26,360 --> 03:02:32,320
Well, I'm going to try to slack off as much as possible except for gym time.

2565
03:02:32,320 --> 03:02:35,800
I need to work out this week really bad.

2566
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:39,120
I'm planning on going to the gym actually as much as I can

2567
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:42,720
during the next couple weeks because I'm gonna

2568
03:02:42,720 --> 03:02:46,520
actually when I start school I'm gonna start running

2569
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:50,200
because I'll be at ARC Monday and Wednesday so I'll just go running

2570
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:53,800
or play DDR.

2571
03:02:53,800 --> 03:02:58,080
I really should sign up for a gym because I think I'd actually maybe use a gym

2572
03:02:58,080 --> 03:02:59,800
membership if I was paying for it.

2573
03:02:59,800 --> 03:03:03,300
I signed up for my gym. You go to Family Fitness, right?

2574
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:06,300
Yep. That's the one I would probably sign up with. They're everywhere.

2575
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:10,940
Yeah, in this area, yeah. But, we'll see. The hotel I was at

2576
03:03:10,940 --> 03:03:15,080
had a gym thing at it, but I was just too lazy to go.

2577
03:03:15,080 --> 03:03:20,180
Working 10 hour days, I expect you to be worn out. But I also, I didn't bring any

2578
03:03:20,180 --> 03:03:25,380
like shirts, or you know, like white plain shirts or anything that I could have

2579
03:03:25,380 --> 03:03:28,500
You know what? I pack very light. You know what? You should get an

2580
03:03:28,500 --> 03:03:31,540
eight-pound arm weights, hand weights.

2581
03:03:31,540 --> 03:03:35,640
And just wear them around me today? Take them with you when you travel.

2582
03:03:35,640 --> 03:03:39,300
That's not a bad idea. That's what I did when I went to E3. I had my weights with me.

2583
03:03:39,300 --> 03:03:40,780
Okay.

2584
03:03:40,780 --> 03:03:42,900
I hope we get to go to E3 again next year.

2585
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:44,380
That would be blissful.

2586
03:03:44,380 --> 03:03:45,140
We'll get to go.

2587
03:03:45,140 --> 03:03:47,020
I'll be there.

2588
03:03:47,020 --> 03:03:50,340
Alright, we're getting a call. Hooray!

2589
03:03:50,340 --> 03:03:53,940
You are on Orange Lounge Radio after birth.

2590
03:03:53,940 --> 03:03:57,380
I joined a gym.

2591
03:03:57,380 --> 03:03:59,380
Why? Are they calling me fat?

2592
03:03:59,380 --> 03:04:01,380
No, I'm messing with you, man.

2593
03:04:01,380 --> 03:04:07,380
No, it's a good thing to join a gym, but at the same time, your first week you're going to be in pain.

2594
03:04:07,380 --> 03:04:09,380
I know. I've kind of worked out before.

2595
03:04:09,380 --> 03:04:10,380
Oh my God.

2596
03:04:10,380 --> 03:04:12,380
Couldn't I just play DDR?

2597
03:04:12,380 --> 03:04:16,380
Well, no, start off on the cardio, seriously. It's the easiest thing to start with.

2598
03:04:16,380 --> 03:04:24,380
And then, but the weight training, the first night I did weight training, I could not move my arms for like five days.

2599
03:04:24,380 --> 03:04:25,380
I was so sore.

2600
03:04:25,380 --> 03:04:26,380
Yeah.

2601
03:04:26,380 --> 03:04:31,380
I want to join one that has a big pool so I can swim because I think swimming is a great exercise.

2602
03:04:31,380 --> 03:04:34,380
You need to come to spin with me.

2603
03:04:34,380 --> 03:04:36,380
Didn't you say that spin kicks your ass?

2604
03:04:36,380 --> 03:04:39,380
It did the first couple times, but they let you take it easy the first time around.

2605
03:04:39,380 --> 03:04:40,380
We'll see.

2606
03:04:40,380 --> 03:04:41,380
Sure, Jamie. Yeah, they do.

2607
03:04:41,380 --> 03:04:43,380
Do you go to a gym?

2608
03:04:43,380 --> 03:04:46,380
Yeah, I do. I briefly joined one about a week ago.

2609
03:04:46,380 --> 03:04:50,380
And has it been effective? Do you have washboard abs and muscles now?

2610
03:04:50,380 --> 03:04:52,380
Too early to say.

2611
03:04:52,380 --> 03:04:54,380
Pretty soon. Soon though, right?

2612
03:04:54,380 --> 03:04:55,340
Is it you?

2613
03:04:55,340 --> 03:04:55,820
Two of us?

2614
03:04:55,820 --> 03:04:58,300
Yeah.

2615
03:04:58,300 --> 03:04:59,300
Soon enough.

2616
03:04:59,300 --> 03:05:00,000
All right.

2617
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,420
Well, I needed that, so thank you for yelling at me.

2618
03:05:02,420 --> 03:05:03,460
I needed it.

2619
03:05:03,460 --> 03:05:04,060
No problem, man.

2620
03:05:04,060 --> 03:05:04,540
Later.

2621
03:05:04,540 --> 03:05:05,100
All right, later.

2622
03:05:07,580 --> 03:05:08,080
All right.

2623
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:10,020
That's going to do it for tonight's Afterbirth.

2624
03:05:10,020 --> 03:05:12,460
Thank you guys for tuning in, supporting Orange Lawns Radio.

2625
03:05:12,460 --> 03:05:13,720
Tomorrow night, Diversion.

2626
03:05:13,720 --> 03:05:15,500
Don't forget, we're doing a little bit of a schedule switch.

2627
03:05:15,500 --> 03:05:16,660
It's going to be permanent.

2628
03:05:16,660 --> 03:05:19,000
Diversion will now be on Monday nights to accommodate

2629
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:20,200
Jamie going back to school.

2630
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:23,140
She will be doing Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night,

2631
03:05:23,140 --> 03:05:27,460
so definitely tune in. And then Wednesday nights, who knows what will happen soon.

2632
03:05:27,460 --> 03:05:30,980
People have to put up with me bitching about school now, because I'm having to take

2633
03:05:30,980 --> 03:05:34,580
my, the classes that I'm actually taking in a classroom are Business Law,

2634
03:05:34,580 --> 03:05:38,260
which is my Monday Wednesday class, which is going to suck ass.

2635
03:05:38,260 --> 03:05:42,100
And my other class is going to be Intro to Windows

2636
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:46,660
on Saturday, because I can't test out of it, because I don't have time to make it to the damn test.

2637
03:05:46,660 --> 03:05:49,860
You don't have the days off. So you're going to be stuck

2638
03:05:49,860 --> 03:05:53,060
doing it for a whole semester? Half semester.

2639
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:57,060
Which is one good thing. It's half semester. And I'm thinking about

2640
03:05:57,080 --> 03:06:01,080
telling my teacher, excuse me, I know all this shit.

2641
03:06:01,100 --> 03:06:05,100
Can't you challenge the course? Well, I can. I can test out of it.

2642
03:06:05,120 --> 03:06:09,120
Oh, same thing. But I figure it's very useful to be easy A and get me started.

2643
03:06:09,140 --> 03:06:13,140
I guess that's a true point. It's on a Saturday though, so I can, since I'll have my laptop

2644
03:06:13,160 --> 03:06:17,160
I'll just play on the internet during class. Play Ragnarok or something.

2645
03:06:17,180 --> 03:06:21,180
Seriously? Good idea.

2646
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:23,940
Yeah, I'll see what his attendance policy is, and I'll skip most of them.

2647
03:06:23,940 --> 03:06:24,940
Alright.

2648
03:06:24,940 --> 03:06:28,500
How's that for a good attitude to take going in a pool?

2649
03:06:28,500 --> 03:06:29,500
I'm going home.

2650
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:30,500
Alright.

2651
03:06:30,500 --> 03:06:31,500
Bye.

2652
03:06:31,500 --> 03:06:32,500
Bye.

2653
03:06:32,500 --> 03:06:43,780
Now, I would like to pass on my warm wishes to our listeners from the depths of my, excuse

2654
03:06:43,780 --> 03:06:45,780
me, heart.

2655
03:06:45,780 --> 03:06:49,940
Alright, um, I guess we'll go into our post-show now.

2656
03:06:49,940 --> 03:06:56,020
I'm gonna play the pop and 11 soundtrack just kind of I randomized it all so you'll just hear a big clusterfuck of everything

2657
03:06:56,020 --> 03:06:58,380
From pop music 11. That's a clusterfuck

2658
03:06:59,420 --> 03:07:02,980
But first I wanted to play this song in case

2659
03:07:03,560 --> 03:07:07,040
My friend is listening and hopefully he is and he knows who he is

2660
03:07:08,220 --> 03:07:10,220
Mr. Bandicoot if you listening

2661
03:07:10,540 --> 03:07:14,500
Here's a song that I know you wanted to hear and then after this song from my Castlevania

2662
03:07:14,500 --> 03:07:19,500
It'll go into Papa Music 11. So enjoy and thanks for listening and tuning into Orange Andrea everybody. Good night

2663
03:09:44,500 --> 03:09:48,500
The

2664
03:09:48,500 --> 03:09:52,500
The

2665
03:09:52,500 --> 03:09:56,500
The

2666
03:09:56,500 --> 03:10:00,500
The

2667
03:10:00,500 --> 03:10:04,500
The

2668
03:10:04,500 --> 03:10:08,500
The

2669
03:10:08,500 --> 03:10:12,500
The

2670
03:10:12,500 --> 03:10:19,500
.
