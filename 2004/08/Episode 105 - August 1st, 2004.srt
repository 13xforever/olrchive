30
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:21,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Low-carb diets are the antichrist.

31
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:22,775

32
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:26,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, first of all, I'm doing this to be supportive.

33

[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but... And second of all, you know how hard I've worked my ass off, so don't... Yes, I know, but they're the Antichrist for me, because anything that says that I can't have bread and potatoes is the Antichrist.

34
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:37,224
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still have bread and potatoes.

105
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:32,092
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think, yeah, they probably don't have it at other, it's a big thing they do in Reno.

[SPEAKER_11]: Old cars.

110
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,737
[SPEAKER_11]: That's such a white trash event, though.

111
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:45,238
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same weekend as Trucker Fest.

112
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:46,179

00:11:52,393 --> 00:11:53,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Muscle cars are sexy.

115
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:54,175
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

116
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:55,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Muscle cars are sexy.

00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:07,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Also known as Mommy Mobile.

00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:08,826

00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:10,046
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

124
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:11,367
[SPEAKER_11]: We are here.

125
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:14,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I was out last week, as you may have heard.

126
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,470
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

127
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:18,693
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was here two shows ago.

128
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I was here Sunday, but then I flew out Monday.

129
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:23,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can tell you guys where I went now, because I'm not there now.

130
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:28,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to a little place in Pennsylvania called Allentown, and there's really not a whole lot there.

131
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there is, like, arcades and stuff, but I was so consumed with my work that I honestly had no time to go out and look.

132
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:48,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I ended up buying Sword of Mana, which, eh, it's okay.

133
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:55,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I was a little bit disappointed, because Secret of Mana is one of the best games ever, and then Sword of Mana being kind of, eh, is a little disappointing.

134
00:12:56,456 --> 00:13:00,598
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I also bought Mario vs. Donkey Kong, which was, you know, it's corny.

135
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,399
[SPEAKER_11]: It's what you'd expect.

136
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,930
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I would like to say to Panda, I don't think he had a choice.

137
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:07,911
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

138
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:08,692
[SPEAKER_11]: With what?

139
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:10,353
[SPEAKER_08]: That you should have gone to Maryland instead.

140
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:13,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're talking about our chat room at orangewatchradio.com.

00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,540
[SPEAKER_11]: They sent me where they tell me to send me.

146
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,741
[SPEAKER_11]: They say, bitch, you're going to go here.

147
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,122
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, yeah, okay, don't fire me.

148
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:29,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I figure we will start off tonight's show as we always start off our shows.

149
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,348
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be playing a little bit of How Was Your Week?

150
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,820
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

151
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jamie, you've got the other mic, so why don't you start us off?

152
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a mouthful of beef.

153
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,342
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good.

154
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:37,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Beef is good for you.

155
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you like meat in your mouth?

156
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:41,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you like having meat in your mouth?

157
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:42,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Or meat?

158
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:44,005
[SPEAKER_08]: It's juicy.

159
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I had to slow that piece down.

160
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,569
[SPEAKER_11]: You should suck out the flavor a little bit before you bite down on it.

161
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:54,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just take the whole thing.

162
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:54,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

163
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,671
[SPEAKER_08]: My week sucked.

164
00:13:58,551 --> 00:13:59,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It was hot.

165
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have an AC in my car.

166
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Busy as hell at work.

167
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,073
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to get busier.

168
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:08,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I finally got this stupid financial aid notice from ARC.

169
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:10,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what I have to say?

170
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:16,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say that I'm actually very surprised I was awarded my federal loans, which means I won't have any interest on them.

171
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:17,775
[SPEAKER_08]: So that makes me happy.

172
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:19,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Good deal.

173
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:22,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting, I don't mind saying, I'm getting, because I'm a sophomore, I'll get $3,500.

174
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:28,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't mind saying so because it's like damn near what everybody gets if you're a sophomore, so it doesn't matter.

175
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:31,234
[SPEAKER_08]: That means I get my laptop in two weeks.

176
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:36,036
[SPEAKER_08]: In two weeks, I will be sitting here with a shiny Fujitsu on my lap.

177
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:37,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a laptop.

178
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:40,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially after that trip, I need a laptop.

179
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,019
[SPEAKER_11]: They're expensive.

180
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't afford them.

181
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:42,720
Go to school.

182
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to buy a used one.

183
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I only want one that will let me on the internet.

184
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:49,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't need any.

185
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,465
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I'm actually thinking about getting a Mac laptop.

186
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:53,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that scary?

187
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:54,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Evil.

188
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:55,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Quit giving me bad looks.

189
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:56,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it.

190
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:56,467
[SPEAKER_11]: All of you.

191
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:02,549
[SPEAKER_10]: First you start with the Xbox and now you're going to... How was my week?

192
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:03,449
[SPEAKER_07]: How was my day?

193
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:04,049
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

194
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:04,929
[SPEAKER_07]: How was my week?

195
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:05,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, how was your week?

196
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:06,549
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your day?

197
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I ended up going to see on Friday, because one of my friends is moving back to Utah.

198
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,691
[SPEAKER_08]: We ended up going to see The Village that night.

199
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:20,092
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't care what anybody says, that movie was awesome.

200
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:22,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

201
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:24,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the political aspect of it.

202
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the whole premise behind it.

203
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:29,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the setting.

204
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how everybody talks in that movie.

205
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:36,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody just talks like, I just like it.

206
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:37,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.

207
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:42,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to give away anything because, of course, it's one of those, you know, twisty movies.

208
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,220
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not going to say anything about it.

209
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I just really, I love the whole color theme.

210
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the way this guy directs.

211
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:54,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And the movies are slow, but all the pacing makes sense at the end of the movie.

212
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:55,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought it was really well done.

213
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:57,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Two snaps up from Jamie?

214
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,401
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets the Artsy Award from me.

215
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:00,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

216
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:03,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And what did I do yesterday?

217
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:13,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl all day and we over the cat.

218
00:16:14,377 --> 00:16:15,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Her cat passed away.

219
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sad.

220
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:19,609
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

221
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:44,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually filling without the great tape.

222
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:45,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I see.

223
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:46,617
[SPEAKER_08]: It was okay.

224
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,301
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I spent the whole rest of the night online.

225
00:16:52,382 --> 00:17:01,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And then today I got up bright and early, read my errands, got myself my comics today, read them all, devoured them, bought a Dragon Ash CD,

226
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:03,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, cool.

227
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I love Dragon Ash.

228
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:08,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bumper Sticker is the best one ever.

229
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:11,676
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, stop whining and plot revenge.

230
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:14,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that not me or what?

231
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:15,658
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty you.

232
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's me.

233
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,201
[SPEAKER_08]: My week.

234
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:20,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty.

235
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:21,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Suck-O-Rama

236
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?

237
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a deaf whore, so I win.

238
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I know one.

239
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you sleep with one, though?

240
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:49,119
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was at the 7-Eleven, and this heroine whore came in.

241
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,480
[SPEAKER_08]: She had band-aids on her inner thigh.

242
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:56,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she was a whore.

243
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,964
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a real whore.

244
00:17:58,184 --> 00:18:00,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we were right next to the Regency Triple X Theater.

245
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:01,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there you go.

246
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:02,126
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

247
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:06,633
[SPEAKER_11]: How long have you lived in Sacramento?

248
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,494
[SPEAKER_08]: The theater was right across from where I used to work.

249
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:13,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guys in the collections department would leave during their lunch break and go over there and watch porn.

250
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:14,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a minute, Loki.

251
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,057
[SPEAKER_11]: How many years have you lived in Sacramento?

252
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:18,738
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot.

253
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:25,241
[SPEAKER_11]: And you just now learned that there is a place over on Watt that shows XXX films all day, all night?

254
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:26,641
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't know that.

255
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:27,742
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know what's funny?

256
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:31,083
[SPEAKER_08]: When the whole April Fool's thing was going on DDR Freak?

257
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:35,704
[SPEAKER_08]: and we had the thread there listing our address and contact information.

258
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:38,626
[SPEAKER_08]: My address on there was the address for the Regency XXX Theater.

259
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,388
[SPEAKER_11]: You know there's some news about DDR Freak Forums today.

260
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:43,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there?

261
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:45,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you guys made something awful.

262
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Dot coms make fun of lists today or whatever they call it.

263
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:50,633
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay, it's not my page.

264
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there were no posts from you in there so you're okay.

265
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, me, me now.

266
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, sorry.

267
00:18:58,177 --> 00:18:59,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Garrett.

268
00:18:59,198 --> 00:18:59,738
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright.

269
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:00,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, well...

270
00:19:01,277 --> 00:19:05,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week was kind of slow, but I made the best of it.

271
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,923
[SPEAKER_09]: My parents were out on vacation, and I only got 24 hours at work, so I had four days off.

272
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:15,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And only managed to go crazy on two days, and the rest I filled with stuff.

273
00:19:16,328 --> 00:19:18,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had a pretty good time on most of the days.

274
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I met someone new that I'm interested in, and

275
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:26,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I found out the bad news that I was hoping to find out sooner than later.

276
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully it won't totally fuck everything up, but we'll see.

277
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to stop being obsessive and something.

278
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:39,494
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I had my party on Friday, and that was really fun.

279
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:42,696
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got really, really, really wasted.

280
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:48,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I have never been drunk, really, before now that I was that drunk.

281
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,841
[SPEAKER_09]: And I go, wow, okay, this is drunk.

282
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:51,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Which Orange Lounge regular showed up to the party?

283
00:19:53,125 --> 00:20:01,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there was Brad, Irene, Matt, and Anita, and then, um, Janae and James, the guy I met.

284
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:02,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay, okay.

285
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:14,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, um, and that was it, we had fun, and people that, I don't think Brad and Irene took off till like, well, all of them pretty much left around like 3.30 or so in the morning, so that was...

286
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:15,888
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

287
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:31,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, chatters, I'm kind of new to alcohol, so I don't know all these things.

288
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I am naive.

289
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:35,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of our chatters can't even buy alcohol.

290
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,802
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't mean they can't get it.

291
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Who says anything about buying?

292
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:41,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that we would condone that.

293
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:42,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course not.

294
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't drive.

295
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:55,412
[SPEAKER_09]: My fingers were about 25% numb, and at that time I decided we needed to play drunk 2DX and poppin' music, and I still managed to beat Murmur Twins drunk.

296
00:20:56,312 --> 00:21:04,135
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think I got as high as like a 31 on pop and music but then I tried a 39 right after that and I just stopped so I don't know, I probably ended up higher.

297
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:13,860
[SPEAKER_11]: It reminds me of the time I played DDR in Vegas and I was drunk, really, really drunk and I got like a huge crowd around me while I was playing though, it was cool.

298
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool, and then now I'm, like as of yesterday, I am officially on vacation for this whole week and I'm still trying to remember that I'm on vacation.

299
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:23,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a minute, weren't you just on vacation like two months ago?

300
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:24,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

301
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:24,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

302
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,740
[SPEAKER_11]: You're always on vacation.

303
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I only get two weeks a year.

304
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,182
[SPEAKER_09]: I just decided to take it now.

305
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:45,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, we usually don't get to pick our vacation until... Shit, I didn't get to pick mine until after March, I don't think.

306
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,968
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have to use it before November.

307
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:51,530
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird the way it works.

308
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,131
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I took it now, I'm on vacation.

309
00:21:54,982 --> 00:22:19,280
[SPEAKER_09]: and I hope I find something good to do this week and oh yeah and then I got all the I got all those wonderful CDs and I spent way too much money on my newfound collections that I got in the mail all week and then yesterday my sister was a bitch when my CDs came because I had to go take Janae to work and then I come back and I see the mailman like on one part of our street like but like you know his car is pointing the direction like he would have had to pass mine

310
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:22,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all, oh, I wonder, because I haven't checked my tracking number.

311
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:27,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I go home, check my tracking number, it says, your item arrived in Sacramento at 5.30 a.m.

312
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:28,126
[SPEAKER_09]: today.

313
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:33,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, wait a minute, that means he would have come to my house already if his car's pointed in that direction.

314
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,069
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm all, hey, Shannon, did the mailman come?

315
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:38,211
[SPEAKER_09]: She's all, yeah, but I didn't have any clothes on, so I didn't go get it.

316
00:22:40,092 --> 00:23:06,011
[SPEAKER_09]: and she's upstairs laying in my parents' room naked in all of my comforters and blankets that I left in there from when I was sleeping in there in the week because she was gone camping with my parents so I'm all, you bitch and then so I go running outside and I'm going to go hunt for the mailman in my neighborhood because I hate waiting for it another day or going to the mail or to the post office and then I get in my car and then all of a sudden he's on the other side of my street so I get back out of my car and run across the street

317
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:11,494
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, I see him... Chasing a mailman for some CDs.

318
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:15,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I see him like at least three or four times a month.

319
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:18,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's always him.

320
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:23,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm running up to him and he's looking at me like, why is he coming towards me?

321
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, like there's any other reason.

322
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:27,043
[SPEAKER_09]: He knows who the fuck I am.

323
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:31,809
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm all, hey, you know, my sister said, you know, can't you just say, oh, I haven't come yet.

324
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:33,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all, he's all, oh, no, I have.

325
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:34,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah.

326
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he gives him my thing.

327
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, I got, yeah, I got stuff.

328
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:40,111
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

329
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:40,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

330
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:41,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

331
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:42,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I think.

332
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:45,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything else from your week in your day?

333
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:47,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, I just wanted to say that.

334
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,473
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't remember what I was going to say.

335
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,055
[SPEAKER_09]: The Jaffro Sachs Remix Album

336
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:17,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was so bad that, okay, like, I was trying to just listen to it while I was kind of napping, but I wasn't really sleepy, I was just laying on my bed.

337
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:23,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I listened to about half the album while I was on my bed, and then I went to my computer, turned it off, and continued to go back to bed.

338
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:26,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you ever figure out what his connection to Bomani was?

339
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:27,593
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I still haven't.

340
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:29,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Sana did one song with him.

341
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:39,340
[SPEAKER_09]: On this remix album, what was it, Hiroshi Watanabe did a remix, and that was a Bomani artist for like 5K a long time ago.

342
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:41,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea who he is

343
00:25:10,513 --> 00:25:13,234
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm the lazy bastard.

344
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:13,954
[SPEAKER_17]: How was your day?

345
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,014
[SPEAKER_17]: How was your week?

346
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:50,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, well, uh, let's see, this week I didn't do much, I played a lot of games on my main cabinet, because I have to get the money's worth out of it.

347
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:58,232
[SPEAKER_10]: So, by the way, I figure it, I will have to play until I die on this cabinet to get the money's worth.

348
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:06,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, anyways, so, I went down, um, what was it, yesterday, we were looking for stuff to do, so...

349
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,740
[SPEAKER_10]: We went down to Golf Land to go play miniature golf.

350
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,021
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when we discovered, guess what?

351
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:14,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they have night... What was it?

352
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:16,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Night swims or whatever.

353
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,323
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically water slides in the dark.

354
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:21,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have that there now.

355
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:23,064
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a ton of fucking people.

356
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,844
[SPEAKER_10]: The line was like zigzagging just to get into golf.

357
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:26,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, fuck this.

358
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:27,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm leaving.

359
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:30,726
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least I got to see what condition everything was.

360
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:34,847
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fourth mixer, Extreme 2 Cabinet...

361
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Not working still, and you know what?

362
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:38,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't care.

363
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:44,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Drum Mania seemed to be okay, and Guitar Freaks was okay, I guess.

364
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:50,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we decided to go see The Village, and The Village was okay.

365
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:55,335
[SPEAKER_10]: But I already knew what the plot twist was about halfway through the film anyways, so...

366
00:26:56,597 --> 00:26:57,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

367
00:26:58,539 --> 00:26:59,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was alright.

368
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,641
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what movie is going to rock?

369
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:03,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's his next movie.

370
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,145
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be The Sixth Sign of the Unbreakable Village.

371
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:10,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Look for that in theaters.

372
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:10,067
2006.

373
00:27:10,187 --> 00:27:12,528
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to rock.

374
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to combine everything that was awesome.

375
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:18,473
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a village of super humans that can see dead aliens.

376
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:20,814
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to rock.

377
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:25,037
[SPEAKER_10]: You used to be funny.

378
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:25,718
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?

379
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:27,559
[SPEAKER_10]: You left.

380
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyways, it's funny that you should mention a crack whore, Jamie, because I did see one earlier today.

381
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, it's the same shit.

382
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:46,203
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I guess, okay, maybe she didn't have a bloody nose and she just had less track lines or whatever, but whatever.

383
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:53,685
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still the stupid bitch, I'll get into it later, I guess, in the FUs, but anyway, some stupid bitch tried to cut me off and I flipped her off and that was fun.

384
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:56,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Harry Camargo, White Castle

385
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:19,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And what is your favorite adult-oriented arcade game that you've come across?

386
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, of course, this was before I even got maimed, Gals Panic, it rocks.

387
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:25,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm awesome at Gals Panic.

388
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:32,659
[SPEAKER_10]: But then I was playing, I beat the stupid, was it that Poker Gals or whatever?

389
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,281
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stupid.

390
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of disturbing watching them masturbate with like a...

391
00:28:38,044 --> 00:28:38,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait.

392
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,046
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean John Waters?

393
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:40,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, maybe.

394
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:04,963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about fucking time John Waters came out with a new movie.

395
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:11,867
[SPEAKER_11]: It better be good, though, because, like, his movies, like, ever since Serial Mom, like, Serial Mom was the shit, and then, like, what was after that?

396
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:17,830
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, um, not, no, no, no, no, after that was, there was, Cecil B. Demented was one.

397
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:19,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought there was one in between, though.

398
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:23,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I might be, I might be losing, but, like, Cecil B. Demented was, like, kind of, like, eh.

399
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:24,794
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just eh.

400
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:25,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Pekker!

401
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:26,906
[SPEAKER_11]: I was in between there, too.

402
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:28,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Pekker was kinda, eh.

403
00:29:28,486 --> 00:29:30,567
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, like, Cecil B. DiMena was even more, eh.

404
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:32,367
[SPEAKER_11]: So he needs to, you know, come back up.

405
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, Pink Flamingos, too, man.

406
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:34,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you.

407
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:36,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if Divine's dead, I don't care.

408
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:43,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, it's about these bunch of perverts that go into this one town, and then everyone starts getting perverted and having sex with one another and stuff like that.

409
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:50,513
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's, like, one specific scene that I remember where this lady is, like, doing, like, some sort of dance or hokey-pokey type thing.

410
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:52,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's staring at this, like, um...

411
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:55,188
[SPEAKER_10]: One doctor there.

412
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:59,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess like these people are getting injured in the head or something like that and they turn all horny.

413
00:29:59,912 --> 00:30:05,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Same way as she ends up setting down a water bottle and squatting over it and shoving it up her cooch.

414
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:07,759
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was, that was interesting.

415
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm looking at an internet movie database right now.

416
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:15,705
[SPEAKER_11]: It is A Dirty Shame is done by John Waters, which means I will have to see it.

417
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:19,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if I fucking hate Johnny Knoxville, I will have to see this movie.

418
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:22,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll watch it with you.

419
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:24,795
[SPEAKER_10]: See, now, did you see what it was?

420
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:32,860
[SPEAKER_10]: It was basically, um, it's when a bunch of head injuries are causing people to become sex addicts.

421
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,102
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I thought, I think that's pretty funny.

422
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:39,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So, can't wait.

423
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:40,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

424
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:41,245
[SPEAKER_10]: What was it?

425
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Wes Johnson, Fat Fuck Frank.

426
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,829
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all I care about is Mink Stole in it.

427
00:30:47,523 --> 00:30:50,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Mink Stoll is the greatest actress of all time.

428
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:52,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care what you say.

429
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And she is in it, as she has been in all of John Waters' other movies.

430
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:59,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, the video game nerds out there have no idea what I'm talking about right now, so I'm just going to let it go.

431
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:01,537
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyways, that's all that.

432
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:02,318
[SPEAKER_10]: That looked pretty sweet.

433
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:06,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, not really much happening.

434
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:09,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little bit of Final Fantasy, not that much at all.

435
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:11,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And just working on my cabinets.

436
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,817
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much it.

437
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:21,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, how about your weeks?

438
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:29,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was gone for a couple weeks in Pennsylvania, and to be honest, really not a whole lot of exciting stuff went down.

439
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:35,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I did get a chance to have one of my friends visit me over the weekend, because she lives out on the East Coast.

440
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:39,373
[SPEAKER_11]: She's somebody I knew from college, and we went out to New York City.

441
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:41,015
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of drove around some areas around there.

442
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:49,382
[SPEAKER_11]: We found ourselves on Long Island eventually, and we went to Fire Island, which is this big gay haven out on the East Coast, for those that don't know.

443
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:54,427
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know what possessed us to go there, but we were just like, oh, let's go to Fire Island.

444
00:31:54,808 --> 00:32:02,695
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did, and it was like a giant gay slumber party slash summer camp that I really didn't feel like I was invited to.

445
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:04,277
[SPEAKER_11]: So, whatever.

446
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:06,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

447
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:07,659
[SPEAKER_11]: See you next time!

448
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:26,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I got some... Well, yeah, because when you pay... You have to pay to go on the tour.

449
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:33,471
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to pay to go on the little tour thing, and then you get little tokens that you can put in machines, and you get crayons and stuff.

450
00:32:35,032 --> 00:32:37,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get out the crayons later, and we can draw on the walls.

451
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:39,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

452
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,079
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty much it, honestly.

453
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:44,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I haven't been playing any video games except for what I was talking about earlier on Game Boy Advance.

454
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:49,804
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only so many times I can beat Metroid Zero before I'm like, Jesus Christ, I need a new game.

455
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:51,385
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that was it.

456
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:58,129
[SPEAKER_11]: But then coming home was very interesting because the house, like coming back into the apartment at 4 o'clock in the morning, because Bugs picked me up at the airport.

457
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:05,613
[SPEAKER_11]: After, by the way, my airplane in Philadelphia sat on the runway for an hour, and so finally it comes back and it sits in

458
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:08,555
[SPEAKER_11]: We get to Vegas, and I was only supposed to have an hour layover in Vegas.

459
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:10,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now I have five minutes to get to my other plane.

460
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:17,102
[SPEAKER_11]: So I ran from one end of the Vegas airport to the other end, and it was like being on The Amazing Race.

461
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:18,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear, it was interesting.

462
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:23,347
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just barely made my plane to Sacramento, and all was well.

463
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:28,191
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Bug picked me up at the airport here in Sacramento, and then we went out.

464
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:29,973
[SPEAKER_11]: We ended up meeting Evan...

465
00:33:30,693 --> 00:33:32,275
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

466
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:54,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So I came here, and then when I open the door and I walk in, I'm like, holy fucking shit, when did Loki finish his cabinet?

467
00:33:54,617 --> 00:34:01,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Because our TV's gone, and it's inside the cabinet, and then, like, the whole room has been turned around 90 degrees, or at least it feels that way.

468
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:09,441
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, like, there's just all this stuff that used to be over here, like, piled up in piles on the side of the room, but I just thought it was cool.

469
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:12,682
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Loki was showing his cabinet to me yesterday, and, uh...

470
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:13,682
[SPEAKER_11]: MrWorld96

471
00:34:44,202 --> 00:35:13,188
[SPEAKER_11]: so they have this but if you I don't know if you uncover certain bad parts of the picture then your bar goes down and if you fall into the bad like the picture of the girl turns into a picture of like the devil and like it starts playing this Eurobeat song that totally doesn't match it goes like everybody move your body I'm gonna play it for you guys later because I think it's just that cool I'm gonna have to do that after the break but um I'm sorry yes Jamie you want to share something with us get get Jamie Mike here

472
00:35:15,928 --> 00:35:20,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I'm meaning to interrupt, but Time Magazine is encouraging people to download movies off the Internet.

473
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what?

474
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:26,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reading this article about how a lot of the horror movies from Japan are being remade for the U.S.

475
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:27,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

476
00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:31,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the original director for The Ring 2, well, for The Ring is doing A Ring 2 over here.

477
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:34,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, and The Grudge is a Japanese movie.

478
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:36,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, Ju-on was the name.

479
00:35:36,706 --> 00:35:40,069
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's saying that, it says, why wait for remakes?

480
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:42,051
[SPEAKER_08]: All of these movies are available online.

481
00:35:42,071 --> 00:35:42,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

482
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:47,146
[SPEAKER_11]: They meant through Amazon.com or your favorite online retailer.

483
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:50,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Loki.

484
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:59,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that the new Kashan movie is available on... Actually, I have it marked on Supernova, a cam of it, though.

485
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,824
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, cam that's subtitled in English.

486
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:04,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Good enough for me.

487
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:16,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of all this Japanese culture stuff hitting the US, Loki and I had the pleasure of going to a small little convention, quote unquote.

488
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:17,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what you got.

489
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,764
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't quite a convention, it was a fair.

490
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:27,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a fair with an E on it, like a renaissance fair, but it was an anime fair that they had at the mall here in Sacramento, which consisted of...

491
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:30,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Four vendor booths scattered throughout the mall.

492
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:36,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And then in what used to be McDonald's, they had a viewing room where they were showing crappy anime all day.

493
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:38,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess they were going to show live-action Sailor Moon at some point.

494
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:39,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Sunrise Mall.

495
00:36:41,478 --> 00:36:43,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the McDonald's closed at Sunrise Mall about three years ago.

496
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,643
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple months ago, okay.

497
00:36:46,983 --> 00:36:49,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Not quite three years ago, a couple months ago.

498
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:50,326
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

499
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:52,408
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, it's closed.

500
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,655
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were showing anime in there now.

501
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:58,398
[SPEAKER_11]: The only cool thing they were going to show was today, but I'm not much of an anime geek.

502
00:36:58,438 --> 00:37:00,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, maybe there was some good stuff in there and I just don't recognize it.

503
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:02,701
[SPEAKER_11]: But they were going to show live action Sailor Moon today.

504
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:04,162
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would have been cool.

505
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:07,564
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, like, the vendor booths were not too thrilling.

506
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:11,887
[SPEAKER_11]: But they were, like, it was really cool to go to the mall and see, like, all the soccer moms and the brats.

507
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, like, all these cosplayers.

508
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:17,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, there were, like, tons of people cosplaying as all these anime characters.

509
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:18,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that...

510
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:24,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that there were many good cosplayers, but there were, you know, a lot of cosplayers.

511
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:35,435
[SPEAKER_10]: No offense to cosplayers out there, but why do the majority, not all of them, but do the great majority of them have the really nasty, ugly, fat chicks?

512
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:36,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly.

513
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:41,498
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I saw some really... It's like, oh my god, when did that character put on 100 pounds?

514
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:46,000
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, a blob has sucked her soul!

515
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,941
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really nasty.

516
00:37:50,163 --> 00:38:01,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I only think that stuff is bad when they're cosplaying as Mai, or Chun-Li, or somebody really, you know, promiscuous.

517
00:38:02,653 --> 00:38:06,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there was that chick who was next to me, who I thought was a guy.

518
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:09,359
[SPEAKER_10]: She looked like a dude.

519
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And she opens her mouth, yeah, how much for this?

520
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:15,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, oh my god, ugly!

521
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:17,946
[SPEAKER_10]: And I started pointing.

522
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:43,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just disappointed because usually at those kind of anime, even an anime expo, I'm not that into anime, I have an appreciation for some of it, like the big mainstream stuff like Miyazaki and stuff, but usually at most anime conventions, you have your video game corner, or you have your video game vendor, or something video game related, I was hoping to see that there.

523
00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:45,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope, not a damn thing.

524
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:49,131
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing video game related I could find that was interesting was the Final Fantasy XI wall scroll.

525
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:54,534
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was just the generic stock art of the same thing that's on the cover of Final Fantasy XI.

526
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:58,676
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same art I've seen over and over and I have it in like a million different places anyway.

527
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:05,340
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't want to spend $15 on a wall scroll that looked like it was just a bad Xerox copy anyway.

528
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:09,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that was our experience at the...

529
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:15,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually surprised you didn't go, Jamie, just to check it out or you heard about it or anything.

530
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:18,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that was the one they were promoting over at A1 Comics.

531
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:18,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, oh, I didn't.

532
00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:35,958
[SPEAKER_11]: It was this one.

533
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:37,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have the little flyer here?

534
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I remember the flyer.

535
00:39:38,482 --> 00:39:41,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I just threw my flyer away and said, eh.

536
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:43,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I had other things to do.

537
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Like laundry.

538
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:46,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

539
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:48,677
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was Saturday, right?

540
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:51,988
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Saturday and today.

541
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:53,089
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still going on right now.

542
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:53,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I was doing things.

543
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember I had to be over at Iguana Golf Course.

544
00:39:58,015 --> 00:40:00,438
[SPEAKER_11]: You were being support.

545
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:08,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel sorry for anybody that was coming from like, according to this, they give in directions from Reno or South Lake Tahoe.

546
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,734
[SPEAKER_11]: What anime do they ever do in Reno or South Lake Tahoe?

547
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:14,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they ever have festivals like this up there?

548
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,335
[SPEAKER_11]: I highly doubt that.

549
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:18,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to a comic shop, you'll see more anime than there was at this place.

550
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:23,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Classic Gaming Expo was in Vegas, but... Classic Gaming Expo is in San Jose this year and I really want to go.

551
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:24,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it next month?

552
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like next weekend, isn't it?

553
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

554
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:28,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to check that out right now.

555
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:31,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh crap, if it's next weekend, then I'm going to the Ren Faire.

556
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:32,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I already have plans to go to the Bay Area next weekend.

557
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:34,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And next weekend I'm going to the Ren Faire.

558
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Next Saturday.

559
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:36,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

560
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:39,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to the Bay Area to visit people next weekend.

561
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:42,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, I have to find out now when Classic Gaming Expo is, because I have to go.

562
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:49,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Classic Gaming Expo, for those who don't know, is supposed to be like the most tremendously awesome, neat, old school thing.

563
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:50,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, no, it's at the end of the month.

564
00:40:50,888 --> 00:40:51,569
[SPEAKER_11]: 21st and 22nd.

565
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,895
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm not, because I don't leave until September, motherfucker.

566
00:40:56,892 --> 00:41:00,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think I can skip my introduction to Windows class that day.

567
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I have no time to go test out of this.

568
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:05,737
[SPEAKER_08]: This is sort of an FU, but not really.

569
00:41:06,538 --> 00:41:09,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm going to try to make this an easy A to establish a good GPA.

570
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, Jamie, SNK just joined as a sponsor of Classic Gaming Expo.

571
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:16,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, SNK, we're out of business.com.

572
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:19,826
[SPEAKER_08]: We no longer support the Neo Geo.

573
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:20,947
[SPEAKER_08]: The last game is dead.

574
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:24,749
[SPEAKER_11]: And Konami's going to have an exhibit today.

575
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:29,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're going to do Castlevania, I hope.

576
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:30,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, right on.

577
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:31,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I have to go to this.

578
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:32,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so going to this.

579
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:38,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can head to San Jose after my class.

580
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:39,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

581
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:40,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I get out of my class at 4.

582
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:44,046
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have to find out what time everything's at.

583
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:47,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can broadcast from Classic Gaming Expo.

584
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:51,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, maybe we should email them or something and figure out something we can do to promote stuff.

585
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:54,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though we don't really do a whole lot of classic gaming, except for, you know...

586
00:41:57,454 --> 00:41:58,915
[SPEAKER_11]: You talk about it on your spin-off show.

587
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:01,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, by the way, there's news about some of our spin-off shows.

588
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:05,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, because I'm starting school in two weeks.

589
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:09,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting this Tuesday, Pump Up the Volume is moving back to Tuesday, so we can use the old promo again.

590
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:10,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on, okay.

591
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I'm, uh...

592
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:16,662
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

593
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you know, somebody in the chat room just brought up a very good point.

594
00:42:50,422 --> 00:43:02,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody in the chat room brought up a very good point that as far as us promoting classic gaming, we talk about BurgerTime, or at least I do, and I do a lot of promotion for BurgerTime, which I believe to be the greatest 80s video game.

595
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:03,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Tappin'.

596
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:04,810
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

597
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:05,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Tappin'.

598
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:06,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Tappin'?

599
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:07,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Tapper.

600
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:08,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Tapper.

601
00:43:08,872 --> 00:43:09,233
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

602
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Rupert Tapper.

603
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:12,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, the original one was like a beer game.

604
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:15,056
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of good classic gaming stuff to talk about on here.

605
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:23,023
[SPEAKER_08]: and Tubin and Supersprint and

606
00:43:24,366 --> 00:43:24,606
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

607
00:43:25,426 --> 00:43:26,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Geographic games.

608
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:28,587
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to look into what we can do about Classic Gaming Expo.

609
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:29,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I think we're going to take a break.

610
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,609
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we come back, we actually have Bimani stuff we want to talk about, believe it or not.

611
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:34,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, the cage match.

612
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:35,510
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to use the week.

613
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,650
[SPEAKER_11]: All that fun stuff very soon.

614
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:41,952
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, we're going to play you guys some new music from Pop and Music 11.

615
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:46,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And our resident pop and music whore is here to tell us all about the songs we're going to hear today.

616
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:49,334
[SPEAKER_11]: So what did you pick out for us?

617
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, I put on...

618
00:43:51,815 --> 00:43:57,417
[SPEAKER_09]: He said three songs, so I picked songs that were not hosted on the Mani style, so they're songs you may not have heard.

619
00:43:57,977 --> 00:43:59,157
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I started with this.

620
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:08,961
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one is, the genre is Nebuta, but the song is actually called Karasu instead of Tori.

621
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:16,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually got really curious when the song was reading the info on the page at the official site, and it's supposed to mean crows.

622
00:44:16,471 --> 00:44:21,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Not birds, like generically like that, because it just has a kanji for bird, and most people would read it as tori.

623
00:44:22,556 --> 00:44:23,277
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's that.

624
00:44:23,517 --> 00:44:31,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I also put on the remix for Yokan Ko, the Death's Reggae song from 7, which I actually like, even though it's really minimal.

625
00:44:32,105 --> 00:44:38,730
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's another song called, what was that, Tozancha Tachi, and...

626
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:45,174
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds kind of like an anime song to me, but it's actually an original song that the guy from the Parkettes made.

627
00:44:45,895 --> 00:44:46,335
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah.

628
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:47,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, cool deal.

629
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:54,161
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the premiere of some Poppin' 11 music here on Orange Lounge Radio, and thank you very much for bringing this to us.

630
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:54,702
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

631
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:55,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here we go.

632
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:57,904
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start off with Karasu.

633
00:44:58,485 --> 00:44:58,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

634
00:46:42,472 --> 00:46:43,294

[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah!

642
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:08,074
[SPEAKER_11]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

643
00:50:08,374 --> 00:50:10,495
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

644
00:50:10,655 --> 00:50:11,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kidding.

645
00:50:11,736 --> 00:50:12,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio.

646
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:14,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

647
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:16,117
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

648
00:50:16,197 --> 00:50:17,038
[SPEAKER_11]: All crap-free.

649
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:20,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for this show, which you're tuned into here on this lovely Sunday evening.

650
00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:25,081
[SPEAKER_11]: As promised, I wanted to walk over to the main cabinet and play this game for you guys.

651
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:28,042
[SPEAKER_11]: This is called Miss Mr. World 96 Nude.

652
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:29,823
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you want to see...

653
00:50:30,714 --> 00:50:39,682
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to see screenshots of this game, head on over to OrangeLaunchRadio.com because it's playing live right now on our webcam there.

654
00:50:39,902 --> 00:50:44,666
[SPEAKER_11]: And even though it doesn't auto refresh right now, you have to click reload every 30 seconds or so.

655
00:50:45,486 --> 00:50:47,608
[SPEAKER_11]: We're working on getting that fixed, at least for next week.

656
00:50:49,938 --> 00:50:57,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, later this program, we'll be opening up the Skype line for your comments over at www.orangesponsorator.com.

657
00:50:57,944 --> 00:51:01,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Look for our recent news article on Skype, and it'll tell you how to set it up.

658
00:51:01,846 --> 00:51:03,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, in our LiveJournal community, there's a recent post there.

659
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:10,232
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we're going to try to get the sound, because I wanted to play the evil song for you guys, but Loki's still working on sound.

660
00:51:10,573 --> 00:51:10,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes?

661
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:11,773

[SPEAKER_06]: I saw asses.

665
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:46,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I'm not a ho There's a really lopsided lump of an outline of a penis on the screen right now But see, if you trace around the penis Like, see, watch If the little character traces around the penis Then you get to see it Oh, some of the ROMs are corrupt So some of the pictures don't work right But it's kind of a fucked up game I see more asses We're gonna see if Loki can get it hooked up I'm gonna start a game here

666
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:50,546
[SPEAKER_11]: and hopefully we can get the sound over and Jamie will tell you all what's going on here.

667
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:51,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops.

668
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:53,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob is playing with the dip switches.

669
00:51:55,248 --> 00:51:55,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on here.

670
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:02,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the little line thing looks like a really stupid Pac-Man, but not.

671
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:05,471
[SPEAKER_11]: How do I insert coins?

672
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:09,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Up at the top, Rob.

673
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:09,793
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

674
00:52:13,054 --> 00:52:15,655
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not two player at the same time, so it kind of sucks.

675
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:16,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

676
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:20,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit, I quit out!

677
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:21,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Dammit, I hit the wrong button.

678
00:52:22,268 --> 00:52:23,288
[SPEAKER_06]: That was special, Rob.

679
00:52:24,189 --> 00:52:24,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very proud of you.

680
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,331
[SPEAKER_11]: This is wonderful radio right now.

681
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:28,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Any luck on the sound?

682
00:52:28,272 --> 00:52:29,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on it.

683
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:30,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki's working on it.

684
00:52:30,954 --> 00:52:33,016
[SPEAKER_11]: We could do a different topic and then come back to this, I guess.

685
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:37,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I now need to announce that I suck at R-Type.

686
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to be okay at R-Type.

687
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,863
[SPEAKER_08]: My fiance is like a god at R-Type.

688
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,041
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like me and DDR.

689
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:49,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to be really good at DDR, but I honestly have not played DDR in a month.

690
00:52:50,243 --> 00:52:53,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm going to play this for the chat room so you can hear how bad I suck.

691
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:53,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it?

692
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:54,684
[SPEAKER_11]: So we hear the sound now?

693
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:04,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you will.

694
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:05,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm hearing Jamie's game.

695
00:53:05,827 --> 00:53:07,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, take the mic away from that for a minute.

696
00:53:07,928 --> 00:53:08,408
[SPEAKER_12]: This is our type.

697
00:53:08,428 --> 00:53:08,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we hear this?

698
00:53:09,188 --> 00:53:10,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, if I put the coins in and do it.

699
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:22,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I hear it?

700
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:26,180
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we don't hear it.

701
00:53:30,742 --> 00:53:33,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm going to see... Does it work if I hold the mic up here?

702
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:39,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we'll hold the mic up there.

703
00:53:43,747 --> 00:53:44,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

704
00:53:45,668 --> 00:53:47,188
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try and get to the evil stuff.

705
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:48,549
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I'll trace around the penis first.

706
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:55,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops, I died.

707
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:04,896
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I got a penis, look.

708
00:54:05,596 --> 00:54:07,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, now I'm going to try and make it go bad.

709
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:15,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying very hard here to get there.

710
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:20,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the techno song, don't choke up on me on air here.

711
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:25,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I died.

712
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Again.

713
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,022
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

714
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:29,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, almost.

715
00:54:29,342 --> 00:54:29,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit.

716
00:54:29,522 --> 00:54:30,263
[SPEAKER_10]: I died again.

717
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:30,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn this game!

718
00:54:58,541 --> 00:54:59,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, here it goes.

719
00:54:59,361 --> 00:54:59,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it goes.

720
00:55:03,024 --> 00:55:04,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Aw, shit, it froze up!

721
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:05,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck!

722
00:55:07,047 --> 00:55:07,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck your cabinet.

723
00:55:08,107 --> 00:55:08,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck this.

724
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:10,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me do this shit.

725
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:11,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta do it the right way.

726
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:21,036
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta play this game, because... God damn it.

727
00:55:21,176 --> 00:55:22,517
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened to all my controls?

728
00:55:22,557 --> 00:55:23,398
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you guys do here?

729
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:26,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki is going to try to get that to work.

730
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:31,079
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, I'm going to want to tell you guys about some general gaming news that's going on out there.

731
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:45,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys heard about this, but WarioWare 2 is going to be coming out soon, which is kind of exciting for those of us who have video game attention deficit disorder.

732
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:50,223
[SPEAKER_11]: WarioWare is a great game to have because you're the only one who'll stare back.

733
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,742
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be coming out with this WarioWare 2, which should be exciting.

734
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:57,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that they're going to have one on the DS, too.

735
00:55:57,364 --> 00:55:58,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this is the DS version.

736
00:55:58,945 --> 00:55:59,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it is.

737
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:01,406
[SPEAKER_11]: But they are going to have that coming out.

738
00:56:02,347 --> 00:56:05,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, it's updated on our website, www.orangetownsradio.com.

739
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:10,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of the Nintendo DS, Square Enix has been doing...

740
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:14,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody moves our body Everybody moves our body Everybody moves our body

741
00:56:43,797 --> 00:56:45,477
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to make a DWI of that.

742
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:47,158
[SPEAKER_11]: That's an awesome song.

743
00:56:47,478 --> 00:56:48,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that worth it?

744
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:52,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that worth that wait of like 10 minutes of train wreck radio to hear that little sample?

745
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:52,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

746
00:56:53,479 --> 00:56:54,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, moving on.

747
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:02,220
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to vote on the Squeenix survey for what game should they port over to the Nintendo DS, head on over to our website, orangeonstrider.com.

748
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,361
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very recent story we have on the site.

749
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:09,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater, some new screenshots have been revealed.

750
00:57:10,462 --> 00:57:11,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, what did you say about that, Jamie?

751
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,561
[SPEAKER_08]: That game makes me hot.

752
00:57:44,844 --> 00:57:46,705
[SPEAKER_11]: The minimum requirements for Doom 3 were announced

753
00:58:03,956 --> 00:58:09,899
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to have a 1.5 GHz Pentium 4 chip or an AMD Athlon 1500.

754
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,681
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to have a 1.5 something to play it.

755
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:17,103
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to have at least 384 megabits of RAM, which isn't that hard.

756
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:17,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Megabytes.

757
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:18,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Megabytes.

758
00:58:18,764 --> 00:58:25,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And 2 gigs of hard drive space and of course an Nvidia GeForce 3 or an ATI 8500 graphics card.

759
00:58:25,947 --> 00:58:31,310
[SPEAKER_11]: But fear not, if you don't have a computer good enough to play it, get an Xbox because it's going to be coming out on Xbox as well.

760
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:32,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

761
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:37,635
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what's going on in the gaming world right now.

762
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:45,600
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if anybody has a comment on something we've been talking about so far this show.

763
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:52,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to hear about your favorite adult-oriented arcade game, actually, was something I'd like to hear about.

764
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,645
[SPEAKER_11]: But see, Custer's Revenge wasn't an arcade game.

765
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:00,032
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to get a mic, Jamie.

766
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:01,093
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to get mic'd up there.

767
00:59:02,354 --> 00:59:07,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, if you want to talk about something going on in gaming news, we got that opened up for you.

768
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Our chat room wants to know who that is on our webcam right now on OrangeLaunchRadio.com with the iBook.

769
00:59:14,783 --> 00:59:17,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is our wonderful Bugged is there.

770
00:59:18,206 --> 00:59:20,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that for our webcam... Oh, we got a call.

771
00:59:20,448 --> 00:59:21,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take the call.

772
00:59:22,929 --> 00:59:24,471
[SPEAKER_11]: OrangeLaunchRadio, you are on the air.

773
00:59:24,491 --> 00:59:26,132
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, Sky.

774
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:26,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Siggy here.

775
00:59:27,513 --> 00:59:27,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Siggy.

776
00:59:28,013 --> 00:59:28,494
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

777
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:30,227
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm doing fine.

778
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:34,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, what is your favorite adult-oriented arcade game ever?

779
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:40,276
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, honestly, I've never played any kind of adult-oriented video arcade game.

780
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:43,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, so you stick to just your basic pornography.

781
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,081
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, not really.

782
00:59:45,121 --> 00:59:46,002
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, sort of.

783
00:59:46,022 --> 00:59:46,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, alright, yeah.

784
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:49,278
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all right, we're all friends.

785
00:59:49,638 --> 00:59:50,938
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so what are you calling about then?

786
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:55,160
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I got some latest news in the local Las Vegas-Bimani scene.

787
00:59:55,421 --> 00:59:57,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, Las Vegas-Bimani scene news.

788
00:59:57,522 --> 00:59:59,803
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I was in Vegas for five minutes this week?

789
01:00:00,843 --> 01:00:02,224
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the McCarran Airport, huh?

790
01:00:02,464 --> 01:00:02,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

791
01:00:03,345 --> 01:00:08,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I ran all the way from Terminal A, one end of Terminal A, all the way to the other end of Terminal B in five minutes.

792
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,808
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, that's a quite far run.

793
01:00:12,289 --> 01:00:13,270
[SPEAKER_11]: I impressed myself.

794
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,051
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so what's up in the Las Vegas-Bimani scene?

795
01:00:16,727 --> 01:00:22,531
[SPEAKER_20]: As of last Thursday, the Orleans Hotel and Casino has got Easy to Dance, her second move.

796
01:00:22,991 --> 01:00:26,033
[SPEAKER_20]: And her third mix from Suncoast.

797
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:27,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Where in New Orleans?

798
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:29,175
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, just Las Vegas.

799
01:00:29,195 --> 01:00:30,395
[SPEAKER_20]: The New Orleans Hotel and Casino.

800
01:00:31,216 --> 01:00:33,537
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the New Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

801
01:00:33,557 --> 01:00:36,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, they have little bits of America all over Vegas.

802
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:41,823
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's far away from the strip, so... So a lot of people have been over there playing it?

803
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:45,605
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I don't... You know, yesterday I went there.

804
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:50,851
[SPEAKER_20]: I went there yesterday, just to, you know, celebrate my 25 years.

805
01:00:52,372 --> 01:00:54,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, happy birthday, by the way, from Orange Lounge Radio.

806
01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:55,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

807
01:00:56,455 --> 01:01:02,640
[SPEAKER_20]: I played it for the first time, and it was really hard, because, you know, it only has one judgment, you know, which is cool.

808
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:11,707
[SPEAKER_20]: I like the DDR, like, perfect, great, good, and... Agent's Dance's second move is only in one, which is, you know, which is complicated.

809
01:01:12,388 --> 01:01:12,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Huh.

810
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:14,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

811
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:20,691
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's new about Easy to Dance, the second loop, is they have freezes, like freeze sensor and then freeze pad.

812
01:01:21,051 --> 01:01:23,111
[SPEAKER_11]: The Koreans love those freeze things.

813
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:29,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen it like in every knockoff of another Bomani game they have in Korea, they have a freeze something, like in Easy to DJ.

814
01:01:30,593 --> 01:01:30,753
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh.

815
01:01:31,213 --> 01:01:32,633
[SPEAKER_11]: But Easy to DJ rocks, it really does.

816
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:33,854
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, I see.

817
01:01:34,074 --> 01:01:34,314
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.

818
01:01:34,494 --> 01:01:34,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and...

819
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:40,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Circus Circus is not much fun to play, according to the Monty Locals here.

820
01:01:40,771 --> 01:01:43,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Circus Circus is my favorite hotel to stay at, though, because it's so fucking cheap.

821
01:01:44,573 --> 01:01:44,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

822
01:01:45,753 --> 01:01:49,635
[SPEAKER_20]: I stayed there, you know, two Christmases ago.

823
01:01:50,015 --> 01:01:50,996
[SPEAKER_20]: Why would you... Before I moved here.

824
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:55,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I was going to say, why would you stay in a hotel there when you lived there, but it was... Before I moved here.

825
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:57,018
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, I would stay in a hotel.

826
01:01:57,158 --> 01:01:59,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, by the way, Loki.

827
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Loki.

828
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:01,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

829
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:05,562
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, by the way, Loki, I suggest you should watch Superstar Club.

830
01:02:06,812 --> 01:02:07,193
[SPEAKER_11]: What now?

831
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:07,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Suicide Club.

832
01:02:08,514 --> 01:02:09,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it!

833
01:02:09,716 --> 01:02:10,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't.

834
01:02:10,096 --> 01:02:10,737
[SPEAKER_10]: You've seen it already?

835
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:11,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I haven't seen it.

836
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:13,520
[SPEAKER_20]: Ha ha ha, yeah right.

837
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,883
[SPEAKER_20]: They're doing blockbuster shelves right now.

838
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:23,632
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's a Japanese movie about 54 schoolgirls committing suicide in a subway station.

839
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:25,875
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what the movie is about though.

840
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:28,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, yeah, it's a mystery of suicide.

841
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,339
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about J-pop and the evils of it.

842
01:02:33,262 --> 01:02:36,184
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the evils of... Actually, there's a really awesome movie.

843
01:02:36,264 --> 01:02:39,587
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone's seen Ichi the Killer, they're making Ichi the... Oh, I've seen that.

844
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:40,728
[SPEAKER_20]: I've seen Ichi the Killer, actually.

845
01:02:40,748 --> 01:02:43,090
[SPEAKER_10]: They're making an anime version of Ichi the Killer.

846
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,912
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be a prequel to it, I believe.

847
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:46,433
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I've seen the live version.

848
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:52,917
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't read the manga or watched the actual anime over the years.

849
01:02:53,037 --> 01:02:56,199
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also another movie called, I think, Three Monsters that's going to be coming out.

850
01:02:56,339 --> 01:03:03,523
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically, I don't really know what it is, but they have a scene where they cut off some chick's fingers while she's playing the piano or something like that.

851
01:03:03,563 --> 01:03:03,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Lovely.

852
01:03:05,004 --> 01:03:05,444
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

853
01:03:06,184 --> 01:03:10,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well we're going to go ahead and let you go, but thank you for calling in and letting us know what's going on here in the woods.

854
01:03:10,607 --> 01:03:11,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, have a good one.

855
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:13,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Be careful.

856
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:13,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Watch that.

857
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:15,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Ichi the Killer in moderation there.

858
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Be careful there.

859
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:17,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

860
01:03:21,094 --> 01:03:21,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

861
01:03:21,454 --> 01:03:22,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Skyblind's opened up.

862
01:03:22,355 --> 01:03:24,096
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take another call if somebody wants to call in.

863
01:03:25,317 --> 01:03:31,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, we'll probably... We'll probably move into some other Bomani news.

864
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:40,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate it because I have all these... I know I'm going to mess up the pronunciation.

865
01:03:40,571 --> 01:03:42,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Mahjong?

866
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:42,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Mahjong.

867
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea how to play it and I have all these porno games of it.

868
01:03:46,013 --> 01:03:47,113
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to match the tiles.

869
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:49,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that seems easy enough.

870
01:03:50,656 --> 01:03:51,157
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a 9 gig...

871
01:04:19,642 --> 01:04:19,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

872
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:22,363
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a mic in my face.

873
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't talk in this house without a microphone during the show.

874
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:32,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyways, I was going to say, there was a 9 gigs zip that I was trying to download.

875
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:34,467
[SPEAKER_10]: That was before we fixed our cable problem.

876
01:04:35,087 --> 01:04:36,888
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it wasn't downloading quite.

877
01:04:37,008 --> 01:04:39,869
[SPEAKER_10]: It was telling me I had like, you know, 4,000 hours left.

878
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:40,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, fuck this.

879
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:43,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You also need to get the Sailor Moon Final Fight game.

880
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Sailor Moon Final Fight.

881
01:04:45,051 --> 01:04:46,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if we can find that.

882
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:47,211
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of fun.

883
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:48,612
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cheese ball.

884
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:55,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have a personal request, because I noticed it wasn't on the machine, but you need to find me Ninja Gaiden, the arcade game.

885
01:04:55,664 --> 01:04:57,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I need Ninja Gaiden.

886
01:04:57,887 --> 01:04:59,229
[SPEAKER_11]: You need Ninja Gaiden on there.

887
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Soldier Sailor Moon?

888
01:05:00,552 --> 01:05:01,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it.

889
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:01,854
Okay.

890
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,063
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyway.

891
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:06,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we're not getting any calls over on Skype line, so I'm going to shut it off.

892
01:05:06,565 --> 01:05:07,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so screw you guys.

893
01:05:07,306 --> 01:05:07,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, screw you guys.

894
01:05:07,826 --> 01:05:08,927
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to shut it off for a little bit.

895
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:12,409
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll come back to it later, though, because I want to talk about some Bomani news.

896
01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:15,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you guys got to this last week, talking about Xtreme, right?

897
01:05:15,531 --> 01:05:17,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we ever talk about Bomani on the show?

898
01:05:17,332 --> 01:05:18,653
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you two guys talk about last week?

899
01:05:18,693 --> 01:05:20,314
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't listened to this show yet.

900
01:05:20,394 --> 01:05:20,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Pinball.

901
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,195
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked a lot about pinball, didn't we?

902
01:05:22,535 --> 01:05:23,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Pinball's awesome.

903
01:05:23,435 --> 01:05:30,600
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I swear the guy that did Pin Mame, or one of his biggest promoters, is from Sacramento, because I've seen the car like three times now with the Pin Mame license plate.

904
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:37,267
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy who runs this one really big download site does live in Carmichael, near me and Dan.

905
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:39,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, maybe that's it then.

906
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:41,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but we haven't talked to him or anything.

907
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:42,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

908
01:05:43,413 --> 01:05:51,938
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so DDR Extreme, DDRSpot.com, we borrowed an article from them talking about the full song list was released.

909
01:05:52,979 --> 01:05:57,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not the full song list, but the pre-unlocks song list was announced.

910
01:05:57,321 --> 01:05:59,203
[SPEAKER_11]: And a very wide mix of stuff.

911
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:00,944
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to run through this list real fast.

912
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:03,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami Originals, you're going to see in DDR Extreme.

913
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:11,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Firefly by B4U, Jeanne Jeanne, Jet World, Love Love Sugar, Mobile Moga, Paranoia Eternal, Pink Rose,

914
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Doomie.

915
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:19,054
[SPEAKER_11]: That was kind of a surprise to see that one when, you know, you say that there's the censors who may not go for that.

916
01:06:19,174 --> 01:06:20,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, screw them at Texas Fox.

917
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:22,456
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is extreme.

918
01:06:22,957 --> 01:06:23,617
[SPEAKER_11]: It's for PS2.

919
01:06:24,497 --> 01:06:25,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Theme from Enter the Dragon.

920
01:06:26,118 --> 01:06:26,859
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me happy.

921
01:06:27,419 --> 01:06:32,144
[SPEAKER_11]: A Stupid Barber, .59, Bad Routine, Dropout, Ecstasy, I Feel, I'm For Real, Peace Out, So In Love, Sugaru, Wild Rush,

922
01:06:43,977 --> 01:06:48,842
[SPEAKER_11]: and Your Rain, the Rage Mix, Kiryamoka, which some of those we've announced on the show previously.

923
01:06:49,162 --> 01:06:50,643
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we get into the licensed songs.

924
01:06:51,264 --> 01:07:01,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of these aren't a surprise because actually an article that Loki had posted a while back about going into the disc and looking at the master song list did prove some of these songs would end up in DDR.

925
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:06,398
[SPEAKER_11]: And I noticed, I recognized the first one right away because I was hoping for this, Diving by Four Strings.

926
01:07:06,758 --> 01:07:23,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing, it's like, they made, okay, the Master Song List, I mean, you work on songs for a long time, they might not make it into the actual game that time, they might save them for the next game, but it's just like, you know, all the songs that they said that would be in there, eventually made it in there, so...

927
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:29,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Hot, all those people that say, well, it wasn't in that game, Nemesis wasn't in TDR Max!

928
01:07:29,914 --> 01:07:31,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, tough, this is what happens, okay?

929
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:33,576
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, as you were saying.

930
01:07:33,776 --> 01:07:39,580
[SPEAKER_08]: They could have an intention to put it in a mix and prepare it for the thing and never not put it in the final release.

931
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Things change from beta to final.

932
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:43,582
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very true, that's very true.

933
01:07:44,463 --> 01:07:49,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually thought I had a clip of Diving, but I guess that's on a CD, I don't have an MP3 of it anywhere.

934
01:07:50,326 --> 01:07:53,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, because you ripped the Four Strings album, didn't you?

935
01:07:56,004 --> 01:07:58,945
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to see if we can... Because diving is an awesome song.

936
01:07:58,965 --> 01:08:01,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play a little clip for you guys if we can get it.

937
01:08:02,965 --> 01:08:03,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, you got it?

938
01:08:05,946 --> 01:08:08,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Play a clip through the computer.

939
01:08:08,586 --> 01:08:08,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

940
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:09,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a little clip of diving.

941
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:16,228
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not coming through.

942
01:08:16,368 --> 01:08:16,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well.

943
01:08:18,248 --> 01:08:19,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki's going to see if he can fix that.

944
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:21,469
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright.

945
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:22,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll copy it over real fast here.

946
01:08:28,268 --> 01:08:29,749
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright, it happens.

947
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:32,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, we're going to get a copy of it real fast here.

948
01:08:34,831 --> 01:08:39,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Other licensed songs that are going to be in DDR, Go West by the Pet Shop Boys.

949
01:08:39,512 --> 01:08:42,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's kind of funny that they have Pet Shop Boys in DDR now.

950
01:08:42,614 --> 01:08:43,514
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me happy.

951
01:08:43,534 --> 01:08:47,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's a lot of Pet Shop Boy covers that have been in DDR before.

952
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:49,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there was just New York City Boy.

953
01:08:51,037 --> 01:08:51,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't...

954
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,089
[SPEAKER_11]: New York City Boy, and wasn't there another?

955
01:08:56,589 --> 01:08:57,110
[SPEAKER_11]: There's others.

956
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:58,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Loki got it.

957
01:08:58,311 --> 01:08:58,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

958
01:08:58,931 --> 01:08:59,632
[SPEAKER_11]: A clip of diving.

959
01:09:01,313 --> 01:09:02,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

960
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:03,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn it down a little.

961
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:03,895
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

962
01:09:04,275 --> 01:09:05,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Play it in the middle somewhere.

963
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:08,238
Now it's too quiet.

964
01:09:08,298 --> 01:09:09,319
There we go.

965
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't these guys a previous cage match winner with this song?

966
01:09:31,304 --> 01:09:31,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

967
01:09:36,318 --> 01:09:39,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever it may take, I'll keep on trying

968
01:09:58,161 --> 01:09:59,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Move Your Feet by Junior Senior

969
01:10:22,562 --> 01:10:24,343
[SPEAKER_11]: With the video, so that's going to be very cool.

970
01:10:24,403 --> 01:10:26,043
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of neat seeing that at E3.

971
01:10:27,444 --> 01:10:31,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Music by Darude, which I believe I've got a clip of it somewhere.

972
01:10:33,426 --> 01:10:34,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the race to find the clip.

973
01:10:34,566 --> 01:10:35,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, whichever one of us can find the file faster.

974
01:10:35,946 --> 01:10:36,827
[SPEAKER_08]: So far, Loki is in the lead.

975
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,808
[SPEAKER_08]: He seems to be looking through his list of folders.

976
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:41,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing a search would be easier.

977
01:10:44,429 --> 01:10:46,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I had it at one point, but I don't know if I do anymore.

978
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:47,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn.

979
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,291
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the Iron Chef commentary.

980
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:49,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Somewhat.

981
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:53,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, I have next to you.

982
01:10:53,405 --> 01:10:54,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have music.

983
01:10:55,387 --> 01:10:55,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn.

984
01:10:56,067 --> 01:10:56,988
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see if we can get a copy.

985
01:10:57,409 --> 01:10:58,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, alright, Loki's got it.

986
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And Loki wins.

987
01:10:59,250 --> 01:10:59,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki wins.

988
01:11:01,313 --> 01:11:03,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Play a clip somewhere in the middle here of music by Daruk.

989
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:19,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you're blasting people's speakers.

990
01:11:20,268 --> 01:11:20,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

991
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:25,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Planet Rock, Paul Oakenfold vs. Afrika Bambaataa.

992
01:11:25,533 --> 01:11:27,094
[SPEAKER_11]: We've played that before, I believe, on this show.

993
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:32,198
[SPEAKER_11]: The Reflex, Duran Duran, which was in Japanese Max 2.

994
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:32,698
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty exciting.

995
01:11:32,718 --> 01:11:33,839
[SPEAKER_06]: You've gone too far this time.

996
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Simply Being Loved by BT.

997
01:11:37,202 --> 01:11:40,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't Clock Me from DDR Solo Mix.

998
01:11:40,184 --> 01:11:42,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that's one of our... That makes me happy.

999
01:11:42,186 --> 01:11:46,910
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of our songs that's in normal rotation on Orange Lounge Radio, I think.

1000
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:47,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1001
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:48,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

1002
01:11:48,673 --> 01:11:49,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is.

1003
01:11:49,815 --> 01:11:53,341
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are definitely happy that Don't Clock Me finally made it into a USDDR.

1004
01:12:05,035 --> 01:12:05,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Booty-tastic.

1005
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:08,236
[SPEAKER_11]: And Highs Off You by 4Real.

1006
01:12:09,216 --> 01:12:18,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have no idea why this song was... I know why this song is in USA DDR, but the rest of us veterans are going to cringe.

1007
01:12:19,278 --> 01:12:23,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Kick the Can by Bus Stop has made its way into a DDR extreme.

1008
01:12:23,559 --> 01:12:27,440
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that song never pissed me off until there was that little kid at Golfland.

1009
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,621
[SPEAKER_08]: You were there.

1010
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:30,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I was.

1011
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:30,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I was there.

1012
01:12:31,982 --> 01:12:35,744
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he went to another machine and played like some other song repeatedly.

1013
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:37,505
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll enjoy this.

1014
01:12:37,605 --> 01:12:38,866
[SPEAKER_08]: It was before the song was out.

1015
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:45,190
[SPEAKER_11]: The next song that's going to be in DDR Extreme is an old boy George cover that you like, Miracle.

1016
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:46,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, play.

1017
01:12:47,012 --> 01:12:48,733
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, I only have the original.

1018
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:49,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't we have that in rotation?

1019
01:12:50,714 --> 01:12:51,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

1020
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:53,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd have to dig for it though.

1021
01:12:53,876 --> 01:12:54,497
[SPEAKER_05]: It's max two.

1022
01:12:54,717 --> 01:12:54,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

1023
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:55,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I have it.

1024
01:12:55,597 --> 01:12:55,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see.

1025
01:12:56,058 --> 01:12:56,238
Ah.

1026
01:12:59,447 --> 01:13:01,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody knows what Miracle sounds like at this point, don't they?

1027
01:13:03,772 --> 01:13:04,773
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't have that one.

1028
01:13:04,793 --> 01:13:05,393
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have that one.

1029
01:13:06,134 --> 01:13:07,035
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Miracle was the first one.

1030
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:07,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it?

1031
01:13:08,376 --> 01:13:09,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was the second one.

1032
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:12,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Max 1, not Max 2.

1033
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:13,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's hear a little clip of Miracle.

1034
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:31,434
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle

1035
01:13:53,347 --> 01:13:54,071
Thanks for watching!

1036
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:06,294
Look at what you see

1037
01:14:27,065 --> 01:14:30,507
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Radio Station's CJ Boogie, with a brand new world premiere song from Captain Jack, Only You.

1038
01:15:01,966 --> 01:15:07,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, There You'll Be, which was not in the Japanese release, was not even in there, but we get it.

1039
01:15:07,707 --> 01:15:16,370
[SPEAKER_11]: There You'll Be, DJ Speedo featuring Angelica, horrible, horrible speed cover of a horrible, horrible song, but I know there's fans of it out there, so hey me.

1040
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:25,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderland by Xtreme, that'll be cool, and here's our last licensed song, YMCA by the Village People.

1041
01:15:27,762 --> 01:15:28,503
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be funny.

1042
01:15:46,974 --> 01:15:47,334
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell?

1043
01:15:47,814 --> 01:15:52,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, these are the same songs as were in, like, Karaoke Revolution.

1044
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:55,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, it's like, you know, the 80s songs, but sung by some retard.

1045
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:56,619
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.

1046
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:06,725
[SPEAKER_11]: So Konami got a little creative there, and they took their licenses from Karaoke Revolution, and they took the original, I mean, the singers that they used on these songs, and they made DDR mixes out of them.

1047
01:16:07,345 --> 01:16:08,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.

1048
01:16:08,426 --> 01:16:13,569
[SPEAKER_11]: What a clever move by Konami, I must say, to get some very popular songs, including Believe by Cher.

1049
01:16:14,589 --> 01:16:15,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

1050
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Bizarre Love Triangle.

1051
01:16:17,351 --> 01:16:18,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that's cool.

1052
01:16:18,412 --> 01:16:18,792
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

1053
01:16:18,812 --> 01:16:20,473
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not going to be the original New Order.

1054
01:16:20,753 --> 01:16:22,995
[SPEAKER_11]: It's somebody else singing it for Carrier Revolution.

1055
01:16:23,795 --> 01:16:28,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladies Night, Waiting for Tonight, and Like a Virgin.

1056
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:30,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Will that make you happy, Rob?

1057
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:32,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it will make me very happy.

1058
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not the Eurobeat one.

1059
01:16:34,322 --> 01:16:36,063
[SPEAKER_11]: No, yeah, it's not the Eurobeat one.

1060
01:16:36,943 --> 01:16:37,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Also...

1061
01:16:38,456 --> 01:16:41,818
[SPEAKER_11]: A whole shitload of news on the iToy modes.

1062
01:16:42,078 --> 01:16:48,082
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the funny thing about DDR Extreme.

1063
01:16:48,143 --> 01:16:53,506
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like having DDR, and then you've got this sequel to iToy Play in it, too.

1064
01:16:53,766 --> 01:16:55,567
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all these new modes in there.

1065
01:16:55,588 --> 01:16:56,248
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy.

1066
01:16:56,588 --> 01:16:58,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, of course, you know, hands and feet, clean the screen.

1067
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,830
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about that previously.

1068
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:02,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Coconut Panic has nothing to do with DDR.

1069
01:17:03,032 --> 01:17:04,874
[SPEAKER_11]: You just shake these coconut trees.

1070
01:17:05,294 --> 01:17:08,116
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, for those who don't know what the iToy is, that's the little camera.

1071
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:10,058
[SPEAKER_11]: The Thing That Sucks Magical Ball

1072
01:17:25,071 --> 01:17:27,132
[SPEAKER_11]: If it had been magical balls, it would have been funnier.

1073
01:17:27,152 --> 01:17:29,274
[SPEAKER_08]: That would have been awesome.

1074
01:17:29,294 --> 01:17:31,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost as funny as Super Monkey Ball.

1075
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:38,719
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be like a party mode that has some stuff, including Hyper Dash, which is like that old school Konami game, like track and field.

1076
01:17:38,999 --> 01:17:40,580
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be like that, but with the eye toy.

1077
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with that.

1078
01:17:43,782 --> 01:17:44,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Or no, no, I'm sorry, not eye toy.

1079
01:17:44,803 --> 01:17:47,024
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just going to use the left and right arrows on DDR pads.

1080
01:17:47,064 --> 01:17:48,265
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like bringing back the power pad.

1081
01:17:49,005 --> 01:17:49,725
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's going to be cool.

1082
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:54,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And then basically you can hit the down button and it puts a pitfall in front of the other person.

1083
01:17:54,168 --> 01:17:55,549
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to hit the up button to jump.

1084
01:17:56,849 --> 01:17:57,990
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be very interesting.

1085
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:05,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Feeding Frenzy, which is going to, it shows animals and then every arrow on the pad is like a carrot or a fish.

1086
01:18:05,554 --> 01:18:08,656
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have to feed the animal the appropriate food by stepping on the arrow.

1087
01:18:09,296 --> 01:18:09,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that weird?

1088
01:18:10,356 --> 01:18:10,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds kind of fun.

1089
01:18:11,097 --> 01:18:11,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds kind of weird.

1090
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:14,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Is what?

1091
01:18:16,578 --> 01:18:21,405
[SPEAKER_11]: and then there will be a challenge mode as well in DDR which is going to be interesting.

1092
01:18:22,086 --> 01:18:30,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, there were some videos released by another website and one of them gives you a sneak peek at what some of the interface music is going to sound like.

1093
01:18:53,134 --> 01:18:56,335
[SPEAKER_11]: So you kind of get a preview that they've done new interface music for it too.

1094
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:57,415
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's all happy!

1095
01:18:57,515 --> 01:18:59,395
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fluffy and all happy.

1096
01:19:00,555 --> 01:19:02,456
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not as awesome as a stupid barber.

1097
01:19:03,496 --> 01:19:05,256
[SPEAKER_11]: No, nothing is as awesome as a stupid barber.

1098
01:19:05,496 --> 01:19:07,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I noticed wasn't on that list.

1099
01:19:07,397 --> 01:19:07,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Or did I?

1100
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:08,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was on there.

1101
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:08,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it?

1102
01:19:08,797 --> 01:19:10,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I must have just missed it completely.

1103
01:19:10,097 --> 01:19:11,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember I went yay.

1104
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:16,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, they should have really had like a porn star giant tits doing, you know, the little animation thing there.

1105
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:20,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they had that one chick jumping up and down that was not doing anything for me.

1106
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:26,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we opened up the Skype line again.

1107
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:32,324
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have any comments on DDR, Extreme USA, something you want to share, we'll go ahead and take your call.

1108
01:19:32,384 --> 01:19:35,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe something we didn't mention that you really wanted to make sure we got out there.

1109
01:19:36,607 --> 01:19:40,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I know one thing that was pretty humorous was they actually ran an article on Yahoo News.

1110
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:42,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us about this, Loki, because you read about this.

1111
01:19:42,751 --> 01:19:45,173
[SPEAKER_11]: You actually posted the article, a link to it on our site, right?

1112
01:19:45,873 --> 01:19:51,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, this guy is a professional game reviewer, and I honestly don't think he's ever played this game that he reviewed.

1113
01:19:52,017 --> 01:19:55,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, because honestly, he doesn't know shit about DDR at all.

1114
01:19:55,401 --> 01:20:00,065
[SPEAKER_10]: He has kept saying DDR Max from the Xbox, and just like, crap like that.

1115
01:20:00,145 --> 01:20:07,352
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't know what the fuck he was talking about, and just comparing it with like, he pretty much was talking out of his ass throughout the whole interview.

1116
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:14,940
[SPEAKER_10]: So the whole interview, the whole review of the damn thing was just completely shit, but, you know, at least it had pictures and pretty movies.

1117
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:18,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's where that movie I just played for you guys came from.

1118
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:20,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, you can't see movies over the radio.

1119
01:20:20,772 --> 01:20:22,954
[SPEAKER_11]: But, anyway, we're going to take a call real fast.

1120
01:20:24,154 --> 01:20:26,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Orange Lounge, you are on Z-Air.

1121
01:20:27,436 --> 01:20:28,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Rob, can you hear me?

1122
01:20:28,437 --> 01:20:29,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we can.

1123
01:20:29,938 --> 01:20:31,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, this is Dark Knight off of the East Coast.

1124
01:20:31,599 --> 01:20:32,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Dark Knight, how are you doing?

1125
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:33,980
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1126
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so a quick comment on those song lists.

1127
01:20:37,222 --> 01:20:38,503
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a pretty decent list, though.

1128
01:20:38,923 --> 01:20:44,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's surprisingly different than the arcade extreme, which is good, though.

1129
01:20:44,046 --> 01:20:45,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little yellow different.

1130
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:45,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1131
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:49,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but some of these songs, I'm probably going to be, like, feeling miserably.

1132
01:20:50,223 --> 01:20:50,884
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright.

1133
01:20:50,904 --> 01:20:51,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it takes practice.

1134
01:20:52,105 --> 01:21:01,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward, as much as I think the eye toy is kind of a one-trick pony, I'm looking forward to having my trick the day I get extreme and being able to play the eye toy modes on there.

1135
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:03,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to be pretty cute.

1136
01:21:03,912 --> 01:21:06,514
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but that sub-para-para mode, that's kind of questionable, though.

1137
01:21:06,834 --> 01:21:07,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1138
01:21:07,435 --> 01:21:08,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it's different.

1139
01:21:09,116 --> 01:21:13,859
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the closest thing we're ever going to get to anything like it in the U.S., so we might as well deal with it.

1140
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:15,517
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true, that's true.

1141
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:18,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything in particular on the list that you are very excited about?

1142
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:20,799
[SPEAKER_18]: Wild Rush, mostly.

1143
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:21,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Wild Rush?

1144
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,380
[SPEAKER_18]: I could play that song easily.

1145
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:25,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright.

1146
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:27,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Wild Rush is awesome.

1147
01:21:27,021 --> 01:21:32,423
[SPEAKER_11]: What about the... I know, I love Wild Rush too, but I thought maybe a licensed song, like, you know, diving.

1148
01:21:32,503 --> 01:21:34,964
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so excited about diving, because I love four strings.

1149
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:35,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I love them.

1150
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:37,444
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm excited that diving's in there, so.

1151
01:21:38,105 --> 01:21:42,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the songs kind of cringe at Never Ending Story, because in my area...

1152
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:46,126
[SPEAKER_18]: That song has been played out on our fifth mix machine every time we had it.

1153
01:21:46,146 --> 01:21:47,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank God it's gone now.

1154
01:21:47,647 --> 01:21:48,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Which song is that again?

1155
01:21:49,048 --> 01:21:49,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Never Ending Story.

1156
01:21:50,009 --> 01:21:50,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Never Ending Story.

1157
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, don't you knock that song.

1158
01:21:52,652 --> 01:21:54,654
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, man.

1159
01:21:54,754 --> 01:21:56,336
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been on everybody's play around.

1160
01:21:56,396 --> 01:21:58,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, just skip it this once.

1161
01:21:59,376 --> 01:21:59,716
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1162
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:03,757
[SPEAKER_11]: In our chatroom, they're saying it's not Parapara mode.

1163
01:22:03,897 --> 01:22:05,498
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more like Dance Maniacs mode.

1164
01:22:05,618 --> 01:22:06,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1165
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:07,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever you want to call it.

1166
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:11,239
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the only Bomani hand thing we're going to have in the U.S., so deal.

1167
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:14,320
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Flag Down Taxi mode is more like what it is.

1168
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,540
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even Dance Maniacs.

1169
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I look like a fucking retard.

1170
01:22:19,421 --> 01:22:20,001
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

1171
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:21,021
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1172
01:22:21,081 --> 01:22:24,562
[SPEAKER_11]: When I played Clean the Screen, I did look like a fucking retard, but it was fun.

1173
01:22:24,822 --> 01:22:27,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what was cool about it is that it's more of a workout.

1174
01:22:28,183 --> 01:22:30,325
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the intention, I think.

1175
01:22:30,365 --> 01:22:33,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know how a lot of people play DDR for the workout aspect of it?

1176
01:22:33,647 --> 01:22:37,270
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're moving your arms in it, too, that's like three, four times the workout.

1177
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:39,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you rather look like a goofball or do the river dance?

1178
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:42,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I would rather look like a goofball and then have a six-pack.

1179
01:22:42,793 --> 01:22:46,176
[SPEAKER_05]: How does moving your arms give you an ab workout, Rob?

1180
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:47,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Just shut up.

1181
01:22:48,217 --> 01:22:49,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't ruin my fantasy, bitch!

1182
01:22:52,549 --> 01:23:00,983
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I want to see pure interactivity, just like Gal's Panic, where they actually had 1-800 numbers, you could call and talk to the women once you beat that level.

1183
01:23:01,223 --> 01:23:02,405
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fucking awesome.

1184
01:23:02,505 --> 01:23:04,108
[SPEAKER_11]: You are being way too random.

1185
01:23:04,168 --> 01:23:06,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, anything else you want to say about Extreme Dark Knight?

1186
01:23:07,355 --> 01:23:08,455
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's about it, man.

1187
01:23:08,475 --> 01:23:11,276
[SPEAKER_18]: I just hope this game will be successful as everyone's, man.

1188
01:23:11,396 --> 01:23:13,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Just keep it going long enough for me.

1189
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:14,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to be huge.

1190
01:23:14,836 --> 01:23:15,756
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I think, though?

1191
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:22,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that this is going to get people... Between this and Ultramix 2, and I really think Ultramix 2 is going to surprise a lot of people.

1192
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:28,079
[SPEAKER_11]: I think people who have been bashing the Xbox, and I admit, I was in this category.

1193
01:23:28,299 --> 01:23:34,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally I got swayed and I bought Ultramix and I kind of ate my words on this show that it really isn't that bad.

1194
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:35,240
[SPEAKER_11]: But Ultramix 2...

1195
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:44,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark my words right here and right now, not all of you people out there that are bashing Xbox, but 80% of you are going to eat your words when Ultramix 2 comes out.

1196
01:23:44,483 --> 01:23:47,905
[SPEAKER_11]: And I admit, I had to eat my words at one point, you will too.

1197
01:23:48,825 --> 01:23:54,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I think between Ultramix 2 and Extreme, people are going to be rioting for a new arcade mix.

1198
01:23:54,567 --> 01:24:00,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think this is going to show that US knows their shit when it comes to putting these games together.

1199
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:04,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's so many new things in there that people are just going to say, why can't we have a new arcade mix?

1200
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:05,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, why, why?

1201
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:13,896
[SPEAKER_10]: God, that they don't put a fucking Itoy thing on the arcade mix if there was ever one to come out, because that'd be the fucking stupidest thing ever.

1202
01:24:14,636 --> 01:24:16,958
[SPEAKER_10]: And I could go into why that would be retarded later.

1203
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:20,421
[SPEAKER_06]: It would give you plenty of opportunity to make fun of people.

1204
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:24,444
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, just the licenses, just the new interfaces, the new stuff, there's enough.

1205
01:24:24,484 --> 01:24:27,326
[SPEAKER_11]: You could take out the Itoy and you would have enough cool stuff for an arcade mix.

1206
01:24:27,566 --> 01:24:30,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to go into why that's stupid right now, okay?

1207
01:24:30,509 --> 01:24:35,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I played that stupid game I Can Boogie, okay, which is pretty much the arcade version of Itoy Groove.

1208
01:24:36,153 --> 01:24:38,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just say this, it sucks.

1209
01:24:38,456 --> 01:24:45,786
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just about as good as playing iToy Groove, it's just as sensitive, it didn't detect shit, I completely failed my song, even though I was hitting it just right.

1210
01:24:46,246 --> 01:24:52,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have really stupid music in there, like Barbie Girl and hot stuff, and like, all this like, gay-ass shit, okay?

1211
01:24:52,835 --> 01:24:53,796
[SPEAKER_10]: No thank you.

1212
01:24:54,628 --> 01:24:55,268
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys.

1213
01:24:55,349 --> 01:24:55,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, man.

1214
01:24:56,109 --> 01:24:56,449
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1215
01:24:56,809 --> 01:24:58,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're just, like, holding you on the line, Dark Knight.

1216
01:24:58,751 --> 01:25:00,132
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll let you get back to listening to the show.

1217
01:25:00,152 --> 01:25:00,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for calling in.

1218
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,733
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.

1219
01:25:01,753 --> 01:25:01,973
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1220
01:25:01,993 --> 01:25:02,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

1221
01:25:02,953 --> 01:25:03,454
[SPEAKER_18]: That was fun.

1222
01:25:03,814 --> 01:25:04,154
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1223
01:25:04,835 --> 01:25:05,875
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll open it back up.

1224
01:25:05,915 --> 01:25:07,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe one more person let him through.

1225
01:25:08,157 --> 01:25:08,837
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Extreme.

1226
01:25:09,578 --> 01:25:10,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Garrett, you've been awfully quiet over there.

1227
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:13,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you don't care as much about DDR as you do 2DX.

1228
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:13,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi!

1229
01:25:15,721 --> 01:25:16,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And pop music.

1230
01:25:16,482 --> 01:25:17,483
[SPEAKER_11]: But what do you think about all this?

1231
01:25:19,144 --> 01:25:19,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

1232
01:25:20,612 --> 01:25:26,677
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time I played DDR was when you were over at my house and we decided to see if my red octane pad was still broken.

1233
01:25:26,757 --> 01:25:29,759
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the last time I played DDR, by the way, which was about three weeks ago, was it?

1234
01:25:29,799 --> 01:25:30,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1235
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:41,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I had fun with it, but, you know, it's just... I mean, if they're not going to make anything new in Japan, I shouldn't be that concerned about them making anything new here because I don't really give a crap about licensed songs a lot of the time.

1236
01:25:41,929 --> 01:25:43,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm more about the original stuff.

1237
01:25:44,131 --> 01:25:47,893
[SPEAKER_11]: So... But the new modes and the new features don't do it for you?

1238
01:25:48,234 --> 01:25:49,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, like, remember...

1239
01:25:50,492 --> 01:25:54,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the day, that PC game called Kai's Photogu

1240
01:25:55,635 --> 01:25:59,638
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no idea what you're talking about, but okay.

1241
01:25:59,698 --> 01:26:04,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've seen screenshots of these new eye toy modes for DDR Extreme.

1242
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:05,442
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck is this?

1243
01:26:05,482 --> 01:26:08,084
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like some goofy piece of crap like that.

1244
01:26:08,684 --> 01:26:13,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it's like, they should just say it's a bonus game for Extreme.

1245
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,348
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a part of Extreme.

1246
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:17,290
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Extreme bundled with eye toy bullshit.

1247
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:24,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But see, I give Konami a little credit for, you know, giving us new eye toy bullshit or new bullshit at all and not just, you know...

1248
01:26:25,256 --> 01:26:26,097
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just not your cup of tea

1249
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,841
[SPEAKER_09]: It lost its value.

1250
01:26:43,121 --> 01:26:44,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Wake you up when 2DX comes out.

1251
01:26:45,202 --> 01:26:55,005
[SPEAKER_09]: When I want to get some exercise on again, I'll break it out and then I might buy a new, like I might buy Extreme USA when that's here if I feel like getting in shape or something.

1252
01:26:55,325 --> 01:26:55,926
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about it.

1253
01:26:57,786 --> 01:27:05,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to put up a thing in our forums when Ultramix 2 comes out because I want to see how many people went out and bought an Xbox because of Ultramix 2.

1254
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:10,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to be... I don't know.

1255
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:15,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I just... There's just too much hype about it, and I think it's going to live up to the hype.

1256
01:27:15,174 --> 01:27:15,554
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

1257
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:16,474
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1258
01:27:17,415 --> 01:27:17,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on.

1259
01:27:17,855 --> 01:27:21,336
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to move on to the other Bomani news?

1260
01:27:22,377 --> 01:27:23,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I want to save that.

1261
01:27:23,377 --> 01:27:26,038
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I kind of want to get into Cage Match now, because it's 8 o'clock already.

1262
01:27:26,058 --> 01:27:30,060
[SPEAKER_11]: We're already halfway through the show, so we've got to get some of our regular bits out of the way here.

1263
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:30,980
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1264
01:27:31,521 --> 01:27:34,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you doing more bad video game trivia that I can suck at?

1265
01:27:35,803 --> 01:27:36,783
[SPEAKER_11]: What, the Orange Crush stuff?

1266
01:27:37,395 --> 01:27:40,116
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the... No, no, that was a Vanilla Sky thing.

1267
01:27:41,296 --> 01:27:42,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1268
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:42,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Darn.

1269
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:43,417
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright.

1270
01:27:44,618 --> 01:27:45,398
[SPEAKER_11]: That was one of my spin-offs.

1271
01:27:45,418 --> 01:27:46,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Shows you how often I come here.

1272
01:27:49,339 --> 01:27:50,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Can they hear the Tetris over there?

1273
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody's saying, who's playing Tetris?

1274
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Can they hear that over the air?

1275
01:27:54,341 --> 01:27:54,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1276
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:55,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully not.

1277
01:27:55,661 --> 01:27:55,982
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

1278
01:27:56,882 --> 01:27:59,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, yeah, we're going to get into the cage match right now.

1279
01:28:02,757 --> 01:28:04,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my bad, I thought they could hear it.

1280
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:13,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a reminder, you have to be in the chatroom if you want to participate in our cage match, but it is the chatters that pick the winners of this stuff, so let's get into it.

1281
01:28:16,844 --> 01:28:31,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week on the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Oh, the way the Cage Match works, I should explain this Three songs picked by the hosts It used to be songs that would be good for music video games Like DDR and 2DX and stuff But it just kind of turned into What's a cool song?

1282
01:28:32,488 --> 01:28:41,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Is basically what it turned into, so that's okay But each song picks a host Each host picks, each song picks a host?

1283
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:44,431
[SPEAKER_11]: No Each host picks a song And then...

1284
01:28:45,856 --> 01:28:50,782
[SPEAKER_11]: We let you guys vote on them, and then the winner goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Ones Radio.

1285
01:28:50,822 --> 01:28:57,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I hear that while I was gone, my song lost, and it was taken over by Loki's pick.

1286
01:28:57,709 --> 01:29:00,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And Loki, what did you put in the cage match last week that ended up winning?

1287
01:29:01,113 --> 01:29:04,917
[SPEAKER_10]: of the Ecstasy 14 Hours Club Mix, the one that I made and played.

1288
01:29:04,937 --> 01:29:06,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just being lazy.

1289
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:10,061
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, and I really like this mix, though, so we'll see.

1290
01:29:10,782 --> 01:29:11,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is.

1291
01:29:11,423 --> 01:29:14,425
[SPEAKER_11]: You only get to hear a clip of it because it is last week's winner.

1292
01:29:14,826 --> 01:29:18,830
[SPEAKER_11]: So we only play a little clip of it because we assume you already heard it last week, like a good listener would.

1293
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:24,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is, a little clip of Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.

1294
01:29:24,755 --> 01:29:25,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy, guys.

1295
01:30:42,286 --> 01:30:44,887
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that was a clip of song number one in tonight's cage match.

1296
01:30:44,907 --> 01:30:48,769
[SPEAKER_11]: A very sexy remix of Ecstasy done by our very own Loki.

1297
01:30:49,169 --> 01:30:50,030
[SPEAKER_11]: 14 hours club mix.

1298
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:53,411
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, wow, it's going to be tough to beat.

1299
01:30:53,691 --> 01:30:55,372
[SPEAKER_11]: But Jamie and I are certainly going to try.

1300
01:30:55,472 --> 01:30:57,733
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I have a song that might do it.

1301
01:30:58,093 --> 01:30:59,914
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll give yours a try too, Jamie.

1302
01:31:00,194 --> 01:31:01,815
[SPEAKER_11]: But I got to say, looking at your pick...

1303
01:31:02,355 --> 01:31:05,217
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't what I would think you would listen to.

1304
01:31:05,277 --> 01:31:07,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very surprised by your pick.

1305
01:31:07,419 --> 01:31:08,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn on your mic.

1306
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,861
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Metro Mix.

1307
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I would listen to it.

1308
01:31:11,122 --> 01:31:12,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, you like those Metro Mixes.

1309
01:31:12,863 --> 01:31:16,006
[SPEAKER_11]: But the artist is somebody I would never expect you to like.

1310
01:31:16,046 --> 01:31:16,286
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1311
01:31:16,326 --> 01:31:18,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Julio Iglesias has a sexy voice.

1312
01:31:18,608 --> 01:31:19,289
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean Enrique?

1313
01:31:19,409 --> 01:31:20,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Enrique.

1314
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:21,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I used to listen to him too.

1315
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, tell us about your cage match picks for tonight.

1316
01:31:23,452 --> 01:31:29,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd take Enrique Iglesias' Hero, the Metro Mix, because it's a Metro Mix.

1317
01:31:30,143 --> 01:31:32,504
[SPEAKER_11]: And so is this something that you think would be good in DDR?

1318
01:31:32,924 --> 01:31:33,445
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just cool.

1319
01:31:33,605 --> 01:31:34,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1320
01:31:34,505 --> 01:31:35,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1321
01:31:37,127 --> 01:31:43,930
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be playable, but I mean, it's... It's just... Good voice, good music.

1322
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:44,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll see.

1323
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:46,691
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Metro mix, that's enough for me.

1324
01:31:46,891 --> 01:31:48,172
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see what the folks here think.

1325
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:51,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is, Enrique Iglesias with Hero, the Metro mix.

1326
01:31:51,254 --> 01:31:52,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie's pick for tonight.

1327
01:31:52,194 --> 01:31:52,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

1328
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:55,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you dance?

1329
01:31:57,577 --> 01:31:59,298
[SPEAKER_04]: If I asked you to dance?

1330
01:32:02,077 --> 01:32:06,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you run and never look back?

1331
01:32:09,381 --> 01:32:14,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you cry if you saw me crying?

1332
01:32:16,785 --> 01:32:20,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you save my soul tonight?

1333
01:32:20,047 --> 01:32:22,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you tremble if I touched your lips?

1334
01:32:38,032 --> 01:32:41,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Now would you die for the one you love?

1335
01:32:41,777 --> 01:32:45,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold me in your arms tonight

1336
01:32:56,492 --> 01:33:04,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be your hero, baby I can kiss away the pain I will stand by you forever You kiss me, but let me do it for me

1337
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:31,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you lie?

1338
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you remind?

1339
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:33,254
Am I in too deep?

1340
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:33,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Have I lost my mind?

1341
01:34:09,116 --> 01:34:21,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I will stand by you forever You can take my breath away I just wanna hold you I just wanna hold you Oh yeah Come into me

1342
01:34:39,742 --> 01:34:41,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Have I lost my mind?

1343
01:34:41,403 --> 01:34:45,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't care.

1344
01:34:46,265 --> 01:34:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be here tonight.

1345
01:34:48,966 --> 01:34:50,366
I can be your hero, baby.

1346
01:34:50,426 --> 01:34:52,407
I can give away the fight.

1347
01:35:07,902 --> 01:35:12,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I will stand by you forever You can take my place

[SPEAKER_02]: I can kiss away the pain And I will stand by you Forever You can take my breath away You

01:35:54,734 --> 01:35:56,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:17,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Enrique Iglesias, Hero.

1351
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:20,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around the room now, and this is the part where we tell you what we think.

1352
01:36:20,598 --> 01:36:22,519
[SPEAKER_11]: But remember, it is up to you guys.

1354
01:36:27,201 --> 01:36:27,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie.

1355
01:36:28,681 --> 01:36:29,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Good voice.

1356
01:36:29,161 --> 01:36:31,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Metro Max, make it like a nine for me.

1357
01:36:31,742 --> 01:36:32,703
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, nine from Jamie.

1358
01:36:33,643 --> 01:36:33,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Garrett.

1359
01:36:35,684 --> 01:36:38,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear the original version of that song all damn day at work.

1360
01:36:38,945 --> 01:36:39,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to hear it.

1361
01:36:41,365 --> 01:36:42,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Scale of one to ten.

1362
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Bel Air Radio.

1363
01:36:45,226 --> 01:36:45,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1364
01:36:46,527 --> 01:36:47,127
[SPEAKER_09]: No comment.

1365
01:36:47,388 --> 01:36:48,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, uh, Bugs.

1366
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:50,471
[SPEAKER_17]: I was playing Excited Bike.

1367
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:51,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Excited Bike was better.

1368
01:36:53,253 --> 01:36:54,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki.

1369
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:56,837
[SPEAKER_10]: It was eh.

1370
01:36:56,857 --> 01:37:01,401
[SPEAKER_10]: The original song was like eh, and this is just like eh with a new beat in the background.

1371
01:37:01,421 --> 01:37:03,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it was like a vibe.

1372
01:37:05,271 --> 01:37:14,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I, it's definitely, I like it better than the original, I like it with the added beat, um, so it's above average to me, so I give it like a 7, so it's pretty cool.

1373
01:37:14,755 --> 01:37:18,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but I've heard better Metro mixes, like I like the Daniel Bedingfield ones better, but that's alright.

1374
01:37:19,316 --> 01:37:20,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, uh, moving on.

1375
01:37:21,813 --> 01:37:25,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try this from iTunes tonight, because this is a song I actually bought on iTunes.

1376
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:27,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully it works for you guys.

1377
01:37:29,524 --> 01:37:36,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number three in tonight's cage match is my pick, and I don't know if you guys have heard, but Utada Hikaru is going to be coming out with a US album.

1378
01:37:36,533 --> 01:37:37,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to Utada.com

1379
01:38:07,552 --> 01:38:10,273
Everybody wants me to be your angel Everybody wants something special

1380
01:38:35,286 --> 01:38:35,987
Thank you for watching!

1381
01:38:57,245 --> 01:38:57,946
Thank you for watching!

1382
01:39:30,262 --> 01:39:30,863
Thank you for watching!

1383
01:40:15,064 --> 01:40:15,605
and many more.

1384
01:41:02,915 --> 01:41:04,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1385
01:41:04,936 --> 01:41:08,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Utada with Devil Inside.

1386
01:41:08,338 --> 01:41:09,939
[SPEAKER_11]: That's her first American single.

1387
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, unless you count Simple and Clean, but that wasn't really a single.

1388
01:41:13,561 --> 01:41:15,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Devil Inside, the Richard Vision radio edit.

1389
01:41:15,743 --> 01:41:16,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought.

1390
01:41:17,023 --> 01:41:17,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie!

1391
01:41:18,104 --> 01:41:25,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I really, really dig her voice, but that was such a boring remix that I give it a 6.

1392
01:41:26,787 --> 01:41:31,429
[SPEAKER_08]: The voice gets a 10, the mix itself would get like a 4, so she gets a 6.

1393
01:41:31,769 --> 01:41:36,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly thought the original was so repetitive that it wouldn't have worked in Cage Match.

1394
01:41:36,491 --> 01:41:39,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree, the remix is kind of... Garrett.

1395
01:41:40,332 --> 01:41:44,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I never heard the original or the remix, and I was pretty fond of it.

1396
01:41:44,354 --> 01:41:45,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked her voice a lot in that, too.

1397
01:41:45,874 --> 01:41:47,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything I usually hear from her...

1398
01:41:47,827 --> 01:41:58,070
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like they want to be like Britney or something, so it's good to hear something that sounded slightly more original vocally, so I give it a 7.

1399
01:41:58,110 --> 01:41:58,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, 7 from Garrett.

1400
01:41:59,031 --> 01:42:00,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Bugs, if we can get him a mic.

1401
01:42:01,311 --> 01:42:03,252
[SPEAKER_11]: If he's not too busy playing something on the main cabinet.

1402
01:42:03,452 --> 01:42:04,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I was kind of listening to it.

1403
01:42:04,893 --> 01:42:05,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, what did you think?

1404
01:42:05,633 --> 01:42:07,053
[SPEAKER_17]: It was better than the last one.

1405
01:42:07,693 --> 01:42:09,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, what did you give it on a scale of 1 to 10?

1406
01:42:11,229 --> 01:42:12,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, scales, yeah.

1407
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:12,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, seven.

1408
01:42:12,810 --> 01:42:13,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1409
01:42:13,431 --> 01:42:13,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Loki!

1410
01:42:15,412 --> 01:42:19,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, I swear to God I've heard that, like, beat in another song.

1411
01:42:19,315 --> 01:42:21,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't remember what exactly it was.

1412
01:42:22,036 --> 01:42:25,699
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it was like, eh, it was, eh.

1413
01:42:25,799 --> 01:42:29,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I like her, I like her music, but that was just, like, really crappy.

1414
01:42:29,741 --> 01:42:33,864
[SPEAKER_10]: She should really just take everything she's done in Japan, just bring it over here.

1415
01:42:34,144 --> 01:42:39,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't try to, you know, make it, you know, more American by taking a shit on it, you know.

1416
01:42:41,567 --> 01:42:44,949
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I'll give it like a 6.

1417
01:42:45,009 --> 01:42:48,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Me personally, it's very disco to me, and disco rocks, so I give it an 8.

1418
01:42:49,951 --> 01:42:56,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's review one more time, and then you can vote in our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1419
01:42:56,634 --> 01:43:01,276

1420
01:43:10,433 --> 01:43:22,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number two in tonight's cage match is Enrique Iglesias with Hero, the Metro Mix.

1421
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:24,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's try that again.

1422
01:43:24,536 --> 01:43:28,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number two in tonight's cage match was Enrique Iglesias with Hero, the Metro Mix.

1423
01:43:45,171 --> 01:43:51,560
[SPEAKER_11]: And song number three in tonight's cage match was Utada with Devil Inside, the Richard Vision radio edit.

1424
01:44:04,123 --> 01:44:04,643
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll do this.

1429
01:44:24,922 --> 01:44:27,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to do this two weeks ago, but nobody did it.

1430
01:44:27,263 --> 01:44:31,485
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will open up the Skype line if anybody wants to make a plea for one of those songs.

1431
01:44:31,585 --> 01:44:33,826
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody has a plea for one of those songs to win.

1432
01:44:33,906 --> 01:44:35,587
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see if anybody calls in on that.

1433
01:44:38,448 --> 01:44:40,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Any predictions for which you guys think will win?

1434
01:44:40,829 --> 01:44:40,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Eh.

1435
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:42,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Loki's will win again.

1436
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:43,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1437
01:44:43,311 --> 01:44:43,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1438
01:44:44,151 --> 01:44:44,551
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

1439
01:44:45,192 --> 01:44:45,672
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see, though.

1440
01:44:46,032 --> 01:44:46,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I vote for Holic.

1441
01:44:47,613 --> 01:44:48,593
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't vote for Holic.

1442
01:44:48,633 --> 01:44:49,794
[SPEAKER_08]: One of these two, Holic's going to win.

1443
01:44:50,802 --> 01:44:55,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, um, moving on, um, I guess we'll get into the other big Bomondi news.

1444
01:44:55,644 --> 01:44:58,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, nobody wanted to call on that, so we'll just, uh, close the Skype line.

1445
01:44:58,905 --> 01:45:00,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, uh, let's see.

1446
01:45:00,445 --> 01:45:03,746
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that someone said they're going, I can't get it to work!

1447
01:45:04,086 --> 01:45:07,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to make a comment, and I can't get it to work!

1448
01:45:08,848 --> 01:45:09,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1449
01:45:09,228 --> 01:45:09,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Or not.

1450
01:45:09,988 --> 01:45:10,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, it's alright.

1451
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:14,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so who wants to tell us about the, uh, 2DX11th style news?

1452
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:15,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Garrett's raising his hand.

1453
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:16,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Me, me, me, me, me.

1454
01:45:17,554 --> 01:45:18,455
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's the weirdest thing?

1455
01:45:18,715 --> 01:45:20,758
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to say, first off, are you sure this is legit?

1456
01:45:20,798 --> 01:45:28,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when I was reading some of this stuff, it sounded very... There's one part of it that makes me go, whoa, wait a minute.

1457
01:45:28,527 --> 01:45:34,895
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it did have that kind of air to DDR Extreme 2 stuff that was going around.

1458
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:35,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1459
01:45:36,684 --> 01:45:53,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but, yeah, well, anyways, um, well, actually, the strangest thing is, um, DJP on Damani Style, like, I haven't talked to him in a long time, and then we just, like, he just messaged me, like, like, one morning, he was like, oh, they, we just found out, Eleven Style, la la la, um...

1460
01:45:54,091 --> 01:45:59,853
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that makes it look fake is all the damn speculation that's going on it because there isn't a lot of concrete information.

1461
01:46:00,333 --> 01:46:07,616
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a fax that came out.

1462
01:46:07,976 --> 01:46:16,418
[SPEAKER_09]: They always send these faxes out to arcades when there's a new style coming out and test locations seem to give arcades information about the next upgrade kit and stuff.

1463
01:46:16,558 --> 01:46:21,080
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was what was sent to whoever, I forgot the whole chain of people,

1464
01:46:21,542 --> 01:46:39,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It went through, but they said their sources from where it came from are very legit, and I believe everything on the facts, but people are already saying that, oh, Coors K is doing the system music, oh, there's going to be an Iconoclasm song in it, and all this other crap.

1465
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:40,767
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not just wishful thinking.

1466
01:46:41,187 --> 01:46:45,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the part that got me was that they said that Ono Ken was going to have a song in it.

1467
01:46:46,071 --> 01:46:49,814
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't get me wrong, I think that should happen because he's a very talented guy.

1468
01:46:49,874 --> 01:46:50,975
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all the speculation that I have.

1469
01:46:50,995 --> 01:46:55,878
[SPEAKER_09]: But that makes me go, that's so fanboyish.

1470
01:46:55,898 --> 01:46:58,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, Chorus K doing the system music.

1471
01:47:00,281 --> 01:47:04,323
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Taka's done all the system music except Slake did the theme for 8th style.

1472
01:47:05,104 --> 01:47:07,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless I'm disregarding old stuff.

1473
01:47:07,465 --> 01:47:10,606
[SPEAKER_11]: But Kors K has kind of made more and more of a presence in 2DX, 9th, 10th.

1474
01:47:10,706 --> 01:47:17,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it would make more sense for Ryu Star to do the system music.

1475
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:24,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Because all of a sudden it went from one song in 4th, a remix in 9th, and then three new songs in 10th.

1476
01:47:24,573 --> 01:47:27,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And Kors K still only has two songs in existence.

1477
01:47:29,013 --> 01:47:37,176
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in a very Japanese-y mood to try and make out much of it, but one thing I did notice on there, because a lot of people are saying that it's going to be transplant-heavy,

1478
01:47:51,822 --> 01:47:57,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that they may have misread that, or I just didn't read it thoroughly enough.

1479
01:47:57,307 --> 01:48:05,053
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a part at the bottom where it mentions pop music, drum mania, and guitar freaks, but it says collaboration in Katakana.

1480
01:48:05,674 --> 01:48:11,819
[SPEAKER_09]: So it may be more artists from other games are crossing over into this.

1481
01:48:12,731 --> 01:48:13,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

1482
01:48:13,591 --> 01:48:16,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, speaking of artists, we just got this word in our chatroom.

1483
01:48:16,873 --> 01:48:24,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Mel B, who passes along some official news from Konami, mentions that Shoti... I don't think he's done anything in 2DX, but DDR, of course, is a stupid barber.

1484
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:30,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Shoti has left... has parted ways with Konami, so we won't be seeing any more songs from him, which is too bad.

1485
01:48:30,318 --> 01:48:31,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, no more Shoichiro Hirata?

1486
01:48:31,698 --> 01:48:33,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because... Aw.

1487
01:48:34,867 --> 01:48:39,108
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no more Akira Shunsuke in Poppin' Music 11.

1488
01:48:39,429 --> 01:48:46,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Once I got my damn CD, I rifled through the booklet and he's gone too.

1489
01:48:46,491 --> 01:48:51,732
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that I think is really, really weird about that fax is that it's Beatmania 2DX11-style red.

1490
01:48:57,663 --> 01:48:58,444
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell is that?

1491
01:48:58,644 --> 01:49:00,105
[SPEAKER_11]: 2DX Red.

1492
01:49:01,446 --> 01:49:02,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you see the fax?

1493
01:49:02,947 --> 01:49:05,508
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you can actually see the actual fax?

1494
01:49:05,549 --> 01:49:06,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can see the fax.

1495
01:49:06,889 --> 01:49:09,871
[SPEAKER_09]: They have pictures of Emall cards on it too.

1496
01:49:10,212 --> 01:49:15,315
[SPEAKER_09]: They said there's going to be an upgrade for the Emall machine or system or something.

1497
01:49:16,116 --> 01:49:19,718
[SPEAKER_09]: They said there will be over 300 songs included in the arcade, I think.

1498
01:49:20,253 --> 01:49:22,254
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, just go to Bimani Style real quick.

1499
01:49:22,294 --> 01:49:23,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I'm going, I'm going.

1500
01:49:23,454 --> 01:49:24,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, let's check this out.

1501
01:49:24,855 --> 01:49:27,636
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, it's on the last... Thank God they don't have that god-awful music.

1502
01:49:28,236 --> 01:49:33,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I really like that song they used to play on here, but man, after hearing it for like three weeks... And then, down at the bottom...

1503
01:49:34,304 --> 01:49:35,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom.

1504
01:49:35,685 --> 01:49:36,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Headlines.

1505
01:49:36,746 --> 01:49:37,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we're on our way.

1506
01:49:38,167 --> 01:49:40,429
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take a look at the facts here, because I haven't seen this.

1507
01:49:40,749 --> 01:49:41,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, I was gone for two weeks.

1508
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:43,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, where the hell did I go?

1509
01:49:43,411 --> 01:49:45,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I was completely out of the loop for like two weeks.

1510
01:49:45,172 --> 01:49:45,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there it is.

1511
01:49:45,593 --> 01:49:46,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just click on the first page.

1512
01:49:48,235 --> 01:49:49,976
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a link right there.

1513
01:49:49,996 --> 01:49:53,899
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I came back home, I was like, oh, interesting.

1514
01:49:56,341 --> 01:49:56,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

1515
01:49:57,162 --> 01:49:57,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1516
01:50:00,882 --> 01:50:02,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.

1517
01:50:02,203 --> 01:50:03,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, there's going to be more than... What?

1518
01:50:03,445 --> 01:50:04,806
[SPEAKER_11]: With a little screenshot and everything?

1519
01:50:05,007 --> 01:50:12,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, okay, more than 45 new songs, more than 320 songs in the fucking arcade.

1520
01:50:13,116 --> 01:50:14,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's all those email cards.

1521
01:50:16,499 --> 01:50:17,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah, blah, blah.

1522
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:21,044
[SPEAKER_09]: See, there's the thing right here that says... It's like... I'm being lazy.

1523
01:50:21,064 --> 01:50:22,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Miscellaneous Spamani...

1524
01:50:23,526 --> 01:50:31,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, series, something, music, collab, collaboration, no you can't translate it, it's a scan.

1525
01:50:32,288 --> 01:50:33,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, collaboration.

1526
01:50:39,150 --> 01:50:41,631
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't say transplant, it says collaboration.

1527
01:50:43,151 --> 01:50:44,532
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an English word they're using.

1528
01:50:45,632 --> 01:50:48,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, poppin' music, drum and guitar freaks.

1529
01:50:51,331 --> 01:50:57,133
[SPEAKER_09]: New something, something, participating, entry, user, something.

1530
01:50:57,174 --> 01:50:59,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Garrett's going through and actually reading what Japanese he knows.

1531
01:50:59,815 --> 01:51:01,235
[SPEAKER_11]: He's reading some of the Japanese.

1532
01:51:01,255 --> 01:51:03,617
[SPEAKER_11]: The facts is all in Japanese, but he's reading some of it.

1533
01:51:03,777 --> 01:51:07,378
[SPEAKER_09]: I can type it out later and do a lazy translation on it, too.

1534
01:51:07,478 --> 01:51:10,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody obviously already translated it.

1535
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:19,144
[SPEAKER_09]: All the people who did the speculating and said stuff about what was listed in here, I have no idea who actually did that or if they were going off their own guesses or actually translated some of it.

1536
01:51:19,365 --> 01:51:23,404
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a lot of Japanese users on there that can do that though Very interesting

1537
01:51:25,559 --> 01:51:44,729
[SPEAKER_10]: The pictures that they show are really shitty, but maybe, like, for instance, maybe the background for, like, that one screenshot was FMV from an Onukin song, because he does do his, you know, BMS files with, you know, full motion video, and so they might have recognized that, and that's where the speculation for that comes.

1538
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:46,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a guess.

1539
01:51:47,931 --> 01:51:48,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1540
01:51:48,531 --> 01:51:49,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't see anything in it.

1541
01:51:49,792 --> 01:51:50,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1542
01:51:50,713 --> 01:51:51,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll, uh,

1543
01:51:52,967 --> 01:51:56,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I mean, it's a scan of a fax, I mean, eh, you know.

1544
01:51:56,951 --> 01:51:58,913
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, it's just the fax.

1545
01:51:59,674 --> 01:52:01,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, actually, yeah, the scan of the fax, but...

1546
01:52:02,032 --> 01:52:03,552
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to look the same either way.

1547
01:52:03,572 --> 01:52:05,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to spit out the machine where it was faxed from.

1548
01:52:05,713 --> 01:52:09,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Still, it's just that Onokan thing, it just reeks of fanboy.

1549
01:52:09,934 --> 01:52:15,736
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not that I don't want to believe it's true, because I think that's awesome, but it's just so... I don't know.

1550
01:52:15,796 --> 01:52:18,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if it is true, that's very cool that Konami did that.

1551
01:52:18,376 --> 01:52:20,197
[SPEAKER_11]: The Iconoclasm thing is very fanboy, too.

1552
01:52:20,237 --> 01:52:20,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

1553
01:52:21,137 --> 01:52:21,417
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

1554
01:52:21,797 --> 01:52:23,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see how you would know what the...

1555
01:52:25,317 --> 01:52:32,636
[SPEAKER_09]: There were so many people who planted bullshit rumors when TenthStyle was coming out.

1556
01:52:39,641 --> 01:52:48,025
[SPEAKER_11]: We're being called out in the chatroom because it's not really 11th style, because now it's the 2DX Red.

1557
01:52:48,546 --> 01:52:50,186
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not 11th style, it's 2DX Red.

1558
01:52:50,467 --> 01:52:54,889
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know, how long were we calling it DDR6 mix before we found it?

1559
01:52:55,309 --> 01:52:56,349
[SPEAKER_09]: It still has an 11 in it.

1560
01:52:56,369 --> 01:52:59,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's a little 11 in there, so it's a reference to it.

1561
01:53:00,478 --> 01:53:03,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we're going to be seeing blue or yellow or any other color.

1562
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:05,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody suggested 2DX grape for 12.

1563
01:53:07,726 --> 01:53:09,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a purple 2DX.

1564
01:53:10,068 --> 01:53:10,629
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want.

1565
01:53:11,289 --> 01:53:12,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope they change the interface up and stuff.

1566
01:53:13,211 --> 01:53:15,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, what, Jamie?

1567
01:53:16,215 --> 01:53:16,775
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't hear you.

1568
01:53:19,358 --> 01:53:20,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I was taking a nap.

1569
01:53:20,659 --> 01:53:21,320
[SPEAKER_08]: 2DX burning.

1570
01:53:23,291 --> 01:53:39,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Burning Heat Burning Burning Burning Nation Mix Like a 2DX Muru Mix or something Alright That'd be cool Anything else you gotta think of on 2DX When the fax came out they said that the test location was going on that day, they were wrong

1571
01:53:39,653 --> 01:53:48,236
[SPEAKER_09]: They reconfirmed it, and they said that it should actually be going on within this next week, because when they send these faxes, all the test locations have happened within a week of them sending it, usually.

1572
01:53:48,436 --> 01:53:50,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's kind of quick.

1573
01:53:50,556 --> 01:53:52,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's just a fax.

1574
01:53:52,377 --> 01:53:53,637
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just for the test location.

1575
01:53:54,278 --> 01:53:58,299
[SPEAKER_09]: They do think these things kind of last a moment anyway, so this week, hopefully, we'll probably sing...

1576
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:12,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but it seems like the time between 8th's release and anything on 9th and then 9th's release and anything on 10th was longer than 10th's release and now this first bit of indication that there will be a continuation of the series.

1577
01:54:12,370 --> 01:54:14,432
[SPEAKER_09]: 10th's kind of snuck up after 9th in my opinion.

1578
01:54:16,553 --> 01:54:16,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1579
01:54:17,574 --> 01:54:20,216
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd hella jump on these things on the Drum Man and Guitar Freak stuff.

1580
01:54:20,276 --> 01:54:22,138
[SPEAKER_09]: They just spew those things out.

1581
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:27,663
[SPEAKER_09]: But they said that the test location should probably be going on within a week or so.

1582
01:54:28,024 --> 01:54:30,827
[SPEAKER_09]: They think that the actual arcade will be out in October.

1583
01:54:31,708 --> 01:54:37,676
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, if everyone didn't know, 8th Style CS will be released before the year is over.

1584
01:54:38,697 --> 01:54:38,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

1585
01:54:39,678 --> 01:54:40,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Good news.

1586
01:54:40,819 --> 01:54:41,199
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1587
01:54:41,519 --> 01:54:43,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of fun stuff in the 2DX front then.

1588
01:54:43,139 --> 01:54:44,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, so it's not a dying series.

1589
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:44,800
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1590
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:45,120
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1591
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:46,160
[SPEAKER_11]: As much as people would like you to believe.

1592
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:47,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

1593
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:48,100
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1594
01:54:49,161 --> 01:54:51,701
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to reveal, if that's all you've got to say on 2DX.

1595
01:54:51,741 --> 01:54:51,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1596
01:54:52,141 --> 01:54:52,381
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1597
01:54:52,841 --> 01:54:59,363
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go ahead and open up the Skype line if somebody has a comment they want to say on 2DX 11, 2DX Red, whatever you want to call it.

1598
01:55:00,323 --> 01:55:01,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Why 2DX Red?

1599
01:55:01,803 --> 01:55:02,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1600
01:55:04,304 --> 01:55:04,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1601
01:55:04,844 --> 01:55:05,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, why Max?

1602
01:55:05,804 --> 01:55:06,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, why Max?

1603
01:55:06,644 --> 01:55:07,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Why anything?

1604
01:55:07,424 --> 01:55:08,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Why Pokemon Red?

1605
01:55:08,645 --> 01:55:09,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Why Pokemon Blue?

1606
01:55:10,495 --> 01:55:15,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do they have all their bad English titles and their banners and stuff?

1607
01:55:15,378 --> 01:55:20,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody in our chatroom was comparing it to Dance Mania, being like Dance Mania Best Red and Best Yellow.

1608
01:55:22,123 --> 01:55:27,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is interesting because 2DX isn't really related to Dance Mania, yet that kind of makes sense.

1609
01:55:28,447 --> 01:55:29,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1610
01:55:29,088 --> 01:55:30,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's a Japanese thing, I don't know.

1611
01:55:31,069 --> 01:55:32,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here comes the call.

1612
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:33,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's check out what's going on.

1613
01:55:34,031 --> 01:55:35,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge.

1614
01:55:35,772 --> 01:55:36,353
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, what's up?

1615
01:55:42,285 --> 01:55:43,705
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a little bit of problem with your bandwidth.

1616
01:55:43,725 --> 01:55:44,606
[SPEAKER_11]: You're cutting up a little bit.

1617
01:55:47,066 --> 01:55:47,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Weird.

1618
01:55:48,066 --> 01:55:48,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Is your stream running?

1619
01:55:50,267 --> 01:55:52,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop the station if you have the station running.

1620
01:55:54,428 --> 01:55:55,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, he's cutting out really bad.

1621
01:55:55,509 --> 01:55:57,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Can he say something again?

1622
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:00,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, buddy, you're cutting out really bad.

1623
01:56:00,730 --> 01:56:01,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1624
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:03,411
[SPEAKER_11]: See, try calling back in a little bit.

1625
01:56:03,511 --> 01:56:04,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what's going on there.

1626
01:56:05,611 --> 01:56:06,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

1627
01:56:07,372 --> 01:56:07,872
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.

1628
01:56:12,222 --> 01:56:20,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, um, well, we'll just, uh, try it again in a little bit.

1629
01:56:20,685 --> 01:56:21,265
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll keep it open.

1630
01:56:22,306 --> 01:56:24,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, moving on.

1631
01:56:24,847 --> 01:56:30,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, with the sky blind still open, if anybody's got comment on 2DX, what do you think of all this, Loki?

1632
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:33,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't play 2DX.

1633
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:35,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Siggy's gonna try back.

1634
01:56:35,791 --> 01:56:36,751
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna see if it works this time.

1635
01:56:37,852 --> 01:56:38,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, can you hear us now?

1636
01:56:41,061 --> 01:56:45,102
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, what's up?

1637
01:56:45,642 --> 01:56:46,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh, weird.

1638
01:56:47,343 --> 01:56:47,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what's up?

1639
01:56:56,126 --> 01:56:58,406
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, you're still cutting out really, really bad.

1640
01:56:58,426 --> 01:56:58,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1641
01:56:58,946 --> 01:57:02,587
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have to... Send me a message in the chat room and we'll address your comments.

1642
01:57:02,687 --> 01:57:03,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, bud.

1643
01:57:04,028 --> 01:57:04,328
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1644
01:57:05,049 --> 01:57:06,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we playing this game?

1645
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:26,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's Strider, which is the most awesome game ever.

1646
01:57:28,281 --> 01:57:30,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody in video games is cooler than Strider, hear you.

1647
01:57:31,242 --> 01:57:35,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked Siggy to send me his thoughts over a private message, so we'll address those in a little bit.

1648
01:57:36,803 --> 01:57:39,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, let's talk about the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?

1649
01:57:39,243 --> 01:57:39,903
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be exciting.

1650
01:57:40,944 --> 01:57:45,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight's cage match winner really isn't much of a surprise.

1651
01:57:45,545 --> 01:57:46,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki wins it again.

1652
01:57:53,757 --> 01:57:55,898
[SPEAKER_11]: with Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club Mix.

1653
01:57:56,298 --> 01:57:57,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations to you, my friend.

1654
01:57:58,139 --> 01:57:58,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

1655
01:57:59,879 --> 01:58:00,219
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1656
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:10,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so, hey, speaking of which, Loki, any sim news you got going on in the world of the simulations?

1657
01:58:11,863 --> 01:58:13,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a little bit.

1658
01:58:14,865 --> 01:58:16,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting off with a few things.

1659
01:58:16,526 --> 01:58:20,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I downloaded this really cool theme earlier this week.

1660
01:58:20,468 --> 01:58:23,370
[SPEAKER_10]: It was called Technolizer something to that effect.

1661
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:32,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, it's just some really cool Stepmania theme that's, I don't know, it just looks a little different than the rest of them.

1662
01:58:32,315 --> 01:58:33,496
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of cool.

1663
01:58:33,516 --> 01:58:34,996
[SPEAKER_10]: You can check it out on Stepmania.

1664
01:58:35,036 --> 01:58:36,898
[SPEAKER_10]: They have it under the themes form.

1665
01:58:36,958 --> 01:58:41,100
[SPEAKER_10]: It's under a thread called, I found this really cool Stepmania theme.

1666
01:58:41,843 --> 01:58:42,084
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1667
01:58:42,725 --> 01:58:44,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that the theme you were showing me the other night?

1668
01:58:44,408 --> 01:58:45,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that was an awesome theme.

1669
01:58:46,132 --> 01:58:47,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that was the one I was showing you the other night.

1670
01:58:48,036 --> 01:58:49,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so there's that one.

1671
01:58:51,280 --> 01:59:01,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, some developments, as far as sim stuff goes, there's a guy that figured out how to rip the Polygon dancing characters out of the DDR games, so he's doing that now.

1672
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:02,331
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kinda cool.

1673
01:59:02,591 --> 01:59:13,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, he's also getting all the graphics and background animations from the games, so pretty much everything is being able to be ripped from DDR now, so nothing really left.

1674
01:59:14,222 --> 01:59:15,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Aside from that, there's also...

1675
01:59:17,743 --> 01:59:24,288
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1676
01:59:48,163 --> 01:59:49,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, so those are on there.

1677
01:59:50,724 --> 02:00:05,409
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, aside from all that, um, in case you haven't been following stuff, they actually do have support now being added in StepMania for a bunch of different game types, including BeatMania, DanceManiacs, and Technomotion, which I thought was interesting.

1678
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:15,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so those you can download, actually, and play it, and I'm sure Alpha, um, I think 22 now will be coming out any time now.

1679
02:00:16,223 --> 02:00:17,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty much all that's going on right now.

1680
02:00:23,325 --> 02:00:23,685
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1681
02:00:24,726 --> 02:00:25,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1682
02:00:25,326 --> 02:00:29,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Now what we're going to do, we're going to go to a break, I think, and then we'll come back and we'll get into the FUs of the week.

1683
02:00:29,607 --> 02:00:36,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have something angsty you want to send to us all, go to our chat room and send me a private message with your angst.

1684
02:00:36,569 --> 02:00:41,531
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, we're going to hear a couple more songs from Poppin' 11, and I believe Garrett has another surprise for us.

1685
02:00:41,551 --> 02:00:43,071
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell us about what we're going to hear this break, Garrett.

1686
02:00:43,786 --> 02:00:46,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first, I picked another song for Rob.

1687
02:00:47,089 --> 02:00:50,413
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a remix of one of his songs that has a Penguin-esque character in it.

1688
02:00:51,034 --> 02:00:53,997
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a remix of Requiem from Poppin' Music 9.

1689
02:00:54,978 --> 02:00:58,381
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, after that, is a CS9 song.

1690
02:00:58,641 --> 02:01:00,864
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, all the CS9 songs were on this soundtrack.

1691
02:01:01,124 --> 02:01:01,244
[SPEAKER_09]: It's...

1692
02:01:02,645 --> 02:01:03,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Yumei Tou Genjitsu

1693
02:01:20,991 --> 02:01:27,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Another remix of Yo-Kon-Ko, but this is from Death's Rose album, and it's just like a pretty much all heavy metal mix.

1694
02:01:27,377 --> 02:01:36,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It's strangely, it's basically game size, but they added in another verse, so they cut off the beginning verse, and there's no reggae to it anymore.

1695
02:01:36,886 --> 02:01:38,127
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but it's pretty cool.

1696
02:01:38,567 --> 02:01:38,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.

1697
02:01:40,669 --> 02:01:41,790
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's check it out.

1698
02:01:42,391 --> 02:01:44,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting this set off with a remix of Requiem.

1699
02:01:44,993 --> 02:01:45,574
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, enjoy.

1700
02:02:57,334 --> 02:02:57,756
Thank you.

1701
02:04:45,976 --> 02:04:46,683
DarkSakura

1702
02:05:22,657 --> 02:05:23,518
Thanks for watching!

1703
02:05:52,233 --> 02:05:52,998
and more.

1704
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:33,600
[SPEAKER_21]: and the rest.

1705
02:07:06,838 --> 02:07:08,163
Thank you for watching!

1706
02:07:52,848 --> 02:08:02,195
[SPEAKER_16]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

1707
02:08:02,934 --> 02:08:07,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

1708
02:08:07,057 --> 02:08:08,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we talk about that?

1709
02:08:08,298 --> 02:08:10,659
[SPEAKER_06]: No subject will ever be taboo.

1710
02:08:10,939 --> 02:08:14,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

1711
02:08:15,082 --> 02:08:17,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

1712
02:08:18,144 --> 02:08:23,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

1713
02:08:24,048 --> 02:08:25,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I collect your fucking head.

1714
02:08:27,293 --> 02:08:28,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Just like this fucker here.

1715
02:08:29,875 --> 02:08:33,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

1716
02:08:33,858 --> 02:08:37,220
[SPEAKER_01]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

1717
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:44,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

1718
02:08:45,826 --> 02:08:49,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

1719
02:08:55,120 --> 02:09:00,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, everybody has a say here on Orange Lounge Radio, including you guys through our chat room, orangeloungeradio.com.

1720
02:09:00,342 --> 02:09:01,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Click on chat.

1721
02:09:01,523 --> 02:09:07,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, that promo works again because Jamie is moving Pump Up the Volume to Tuesday night starting this week.

1722
02:09:08,945 --> 02:09:13,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, I know you're over there playing something on Loki's main cabinet.

1723
02:09:13,127 --> 02:09:21,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Psycho Soldier, which you can see on our webcam over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1724
02:09:21,230 --> 02:09:22,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Put the mic up to it.

1725
02:09:22,231 --> 02:09:23,091
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got DigiDice singing in it.

1726
02:09:24,851 --> 02:09:25,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we hearing it?

1727
02:09:29,773 --> 02:09:30,314
[SPEAKER_11]: You died.

1728
02:09:31,134 --> 02:09:33,475
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell us about Pump Up the Volume while you play Psycho Soldier here.

1729
02:09:34,115 --> 02:09:36,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I play good music and that's about it.

1730
02:09:36,576 --> 02:09:37,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you moving?

1731
02:09:37,757 --> 02:09:38,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm going to school.

1732
02:09:40,038 --> 02:09:43,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so what time on Tuesday nights can we expect to hear your show?

1733
02:09:43,739 --> 02:09:47,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm supposed to start my pre-show at 7 o'clock so I usually get forward and start it early.

1734
02:09:49,082 --> 02:09:50,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1735

02:10:35,624 --> 02:10:37,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I do miss Vanilla Sky, though.

1737
02:10:37,826 --> 02:10:39,367
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a great show for me.

1738
02:10:40,308 --> 02:10:40,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to bring it back.

1739
02:10:41,008 --> 02:10:41,348
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

1740
02:10:41,849 --> 02:10:43,150
[SPEAKER_11]: And Loki, you ever going to do anything?

1741
02:10:43,230 --> 02:10:45,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Weren't you going to have a game show in 2004?

1742
02:10:45,431 --> 02:10:46,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Did that get pushed back to 2005?

1743
02:10:48,593 --> 02:10:49,834
[SPEAKER_10]: It got pushed back to 2000.

1744
02:10:49,874 --> 02:10:50,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Never.

1745
02:10:51,315 --> 02:10:51,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1746
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,176
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1747
02:10:52,336 --> 02:10:54,017
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still running into problems with MAME.

1748
02:10:54,057 --> 02:10:56,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to work on my cabinet a little bit.

1749
02:10:56,319 --> 02:11:00,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to install more RAM because I'm getting lag on some of the keys.

1750
02:11:00,422 --> 02:11:03,304
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to take out Joy to Key and reset all my buttons and stuff.

1751
02:11:06,491 --> 02:11:10,194
[SPEAKER_10]: The FU's of the week

1752
02:11:35,902 --> 02:11:36,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this is bad.

1753
02:11:36,923 --> 02:11:37,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is justice.

1754
02:12:06,130 --> 02:12:13,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Big F you goes to work for being busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.

1755
02:12:13,976 --> 02:12:15,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And did I say it was busy?

1756
02:12:15,538 --> 02:12:16,818
[SPEAKER_08]: It's horrendously busy.

1757
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:21,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And also a big F you goes toward, like,

1758
02:12:23,959 --> 02:12:25,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

1759
02:12:25,341 --> 02:12:32,108
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that this week I've been too busy to be angsty about things, if you can believe that.

1760
02:12:33,049 --> 02:12:37,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have to say another one goes toward people who have big patience issues.

1761
02:12:38,735 --> 02:12:42,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's some things it's okay to be impatient about, but not driving.

1762
02:12:43,874 --> 02:12:47,355
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, do not change lanes when you are about to hit somebody.

1763
02:12:47,976 --> 02:12:53,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this stupid fucker behind me who was right on my tail the entire time on the freeway today.

1764
02:12:55,558 --> 02:12:57,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I just need to get a Humvee.

1765
02:12:57,419 --> 02:12:58,199
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all there is to it.

1766
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:01,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to drive a Humvee with an assault rifle.

1767
02:13:01,661 --> 02:13:02,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on the top.

1768
02:13:04,204 --> 02:13:06,365
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll need like a gunner to drive with me.

1769
02:13:07,386 --> 02:13:08,146
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's eight turns.

1770
02:13:08,406 --> 02:13:10,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll need a gunner, the person can drive.

1771
02:13:10,727 --> 02:13:18,271
[SPEAKER_11]: What was that game with the two, where you and your friend would sit in there and like crash and, it's like Crash and Dance or something.

1772
02:13:18,311 --> 02:13:19,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Bucky and Wild.

1773
02:13:19,251 --> 02:13:19,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Bucky and Wild.

1774
02:13:19,671 --> 02:13:21,372
[SPEAKER_08]: We had one of those at my arcade that I worked at.

1775
02:13:22,633 --> 02:13:24,534
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I need something like that.

1776
02:13:25,494 --> 02:13:27,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I just need like, you know,

1777
02:13:28,935 --> 02:13:30,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it's very legal too.

1778
02:13:30,315 --> 02:13:32,916
[SPEAKER_08]: It is in South Africa, but damn we're not there.

1779
02:13:57,304 --> 02:13:59,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I just downloaded Lucky and Wild.

1780
02:13:59,546 --> 02:14:00,807
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to know what sucks though?

1781
02:14:01,387 --> 02:14:12,556
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as I would love to actually get a real Humvee and, you know, remake it, you know, you actually cannot get a Humvee anymore because they're now ordered to be destroyed due to some contract deal.

1782
02:14:13,556 --> 02:14:14,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that suck?

1783
02:14:14,597 --> 02:14:15,518
[SPEAKER_11]: That's interesting.

1784
02:14:15,578 --> 02:14:18,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, when they're used up, Humvee goes to the scrap heap.

1785
02:14:22,043 --> 02:14:23,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Medical records in one of those.

1786
02:14:23,764 --> 02:14:24,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the military records.

1787
02:14:27,793 --> 02:14:32,694
[SPEAKER_11]: For those who didn't hear that whole sentence, Loki said they probably hid Bush's military records in one of those.

1788
02:14:33,094 --> 02:14:35,294
[SPEAKER_11]: They couldn't figure out which ones they have to destroy them all.

1789
02:14:37,735 --> 02:14:53,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it has to do with when they were put out on the market, there was like some order for them not to be resold, so they were actually, quote, given to a distributor who sold them for the military and got the money back.

1790
02:14:53,658 --> 02:14:54,658
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was all.

1791
02:14:54,778 --> 02:14:55,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they have to all be destroyed.

1792
02:14:58,251 --> 02:14:58,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that suck?

1793
02:14:58,971 --> 02:15:00,552
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

1794
02:15:00,572 --> 02:15:02,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still going to get a Humvee one day.

1795
02:15:03,613 --> 02:15:04,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to paint it camo.

1796
02:15:05,773 --> 02:15:08,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And put myself a big old gun on top of it.

1797
02:15:09,114 --> 02:15:10,135
[SPEAKER_08]: And drive that shit around.

1798
02:15:12,175 --> 02:15:14,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care if the gun works, I'm going to have one on there.

1799
02:15:15,076 --> 02:15:19,497
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be like in Cruisin' World.

1800
02:15:20,358 --> 02:15:22,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you could drive the Hummer.

1801
02:15:23,518 --> 02:15:24,059
[SPEAKER_08]: With the gun.

1802
02:15:24,439 --> 02:15:24,919
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember that.

1803
02:15:25,822 --> 02:15:31,065
[SPEAKER_08]: It was always either that, the school bus, or the three-wheeled truck that I would use.

1804
02:15:31,105 --> 02:15:36,369
[SPEAKER_11]: You talking about Cruise and World makes me think about Nintendo arcade games, which makes me think about how I really want to play Killer Instinct.

1805
02:15:36,429 --> 02:15:38,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It still says Ultra 64 on it, isn't that sad?

1806
02:15:38,370 --> 02:15:39,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play Killer Instinct.

1807
02:15:39,991 --> 02:15:40,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I love Killer Instinct.

1808
02:15:41,031 --> 02:15:42,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

1809
02:15:43,013 --> 02:15:44,534
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to Killer Instinct for dying.

1810
02:15:45,794 --> 02:15:46,475
[SPEAKER_08]: We miss you.

1811
02:15:46,715 --> 02:15:47,756
Killer Instinct.

1812
02:15:48,696 --> 02:15:53,059
[SPEAKER_08]: And F you goes toward Mortal Kombat Annihilation, because I finally saw it.

1813
02:15:54,306 --> 02:15:56,968
[SPEAKER_11]: How could a movie that sucks... Welcome to five years ago.

1814
02:15:57,789 --> 02:16:00,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew it was going to suck, so I just didn't bother seeing it.

1815
02:16:00,951 --> 02:16:03,633
[SPEAKER_08]: But Ross made me watch it yesterday.

1816
02:16:04,493 --> 02:16:05,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought over The Last Samurai.

1817
02:16:05,954 --> 02:16:06,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Good movie.

1818
02:16:06,515 --> 02:16:08,456
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what you need to play in that main cabinet right now?

1819
02:16:08,876 --> 02:16:10,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Street Fighter II, the movie, the game.

1820
02:16:11,278 --> 02:16:11,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, no.

1821
02:16:12,018 --> 02:16:12,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell no.

1822
02:16:12,759 --> 02:16:13,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I played that game.

1823
02:16:14,199 --> 02:16:17,760
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is the... It is so ass-tastic.

1824
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:18,961
[SPEAKER_11]: You wouldn't even believe.

1825
02:16:19,161 --> 02:16:20,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back to the chat room for a second.

1826
02:16:20,201 --> 02:16:20,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to reply to something.

1827
02:16:21,041 --> 02:16:25,323
[SPEAKER_11]: The best thing about playing Street Fighter II, the movie, the game, though, is playing as Cammy.

1828
02:16:25,563 --> 02:16:32,765
[SPEAKER_08]: To address Anita, you actually cannot buy them army surplus anymore because they have to be destroyed.

1829
02:16:32,785 --> 02:16:34,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1830
02:16:35,546 --> 02:16:37,507
[SPEAKER_08]: People are asking me stuff and I can't read the chat room.

1831
02:16:39,147 --> 02:16:40,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Street Fighter 2, The Movie, The Game.

1832
02:16:40,308 --> 02:16:40,889
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to see it.

1833
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:43,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll relay if there's any other stuff.

1834
02:16:44,212 --> 02:16:45,293
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have to buy your own M60.

1835
02:16:45,333 --> 02:16:47,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1836
02:16:47,776 --> 02:16:48,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1837
02:16:48,577 --> 02:16:53,162
[SPEAKER_08]: But another SU goes toward how long it's going to take for me to get done with school.

1838
02:16:53,602 --> 02:16:56,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm probably going to be done probably...

1839
02:16:58,081 --> 02:17:06,323
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can do it right, 2006, which is going to... I mean, it's an okay thing because that means that I have more time to get in shape and everything.

1840
02:17:07,144 --> 02:17:10,885
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm still planning on going into the Air Force Reserves.

1841
02:17:11,245 --> 02:17:13,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So, once I lose a little bit more weight.

1842
02:17:14,166 --> 02:17:15,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1843
02:17:15,666 --> 02:17:18,987
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just didn't want to have to wait another two years instead of one.

1844
02:17:19,687 --> 02:17:20,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pissing me off.

1845
02:17:21,548 --> 02:17:24,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And another F you to Alabama for being so far away.

1846
02:17:24,288 --> 02:17:25,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I want to go home.

1847
02:17:27,629 --> 02:17:32,230
[SPEAKER_08]: There's certain places that I want to visit, certain places, certain people I want to see.

1848
02:17:32,910 --> 02:17:33,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm broke.

1849
02:17:34,751 --> 02:17:35,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have no time off.

1850
02:17:35,711 --> 02:17:36,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two days off for the rest of the year.

1851
02:17:37,432 --> 02:17:39,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Not counting, though, the one day where I have to go to the dentist.

1852
02:17:40,632 --> 02:17:41,953
[SPEAKER_08]: That means I can't get sick.

1853
02:17:42,673 --> 02:17:44,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I got sick right at the beginning of the year.

1854
02:17:44,653 --> 02:17:46,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I had all that surgery and all this other crap.

1855
02:17:47,514 --> 02:17:53,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, I need more days off so that I can do other stuff next year that I want to do.

1856
02:17:54,256 --> 02:17:54,356
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1857
02:17:55,273 --> 02:18:00,411
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to me having to wait for two weeks to get my laptop because I want it now.

1858
02:18:01,414 --> 02:18:03,835
[SPEAKER_08]: See, it's okay to be impatient about getting a laptop.

1859
02:18:04,375 --> 02:18:05,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Because your laptops are cool.

1860
02:18:06,236 --> 02:18:09,858
[SPEAKER_08]: But I found a pretty one getting this nice Fujitsu with the DVD-R.

1861
02:18:10,878 --> 02:18:14,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can finally burn off all the crap on my hard drive and reformat.

1862
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:16,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm going to have to start sharing it with Dan.

1863
02:18:17,301 --> 02:18:19,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he turned his computer into a main machine.

1864
02:18:19,683 --> 02:18:20,943
[SPEAKER_08]: It built into a pole position.

1865
02:18:23,324 --> 02:18:24,525
[SPEAKER_11]: You're very angsty tonight.

1866
02:18:24,825 --> 02:18:26,746
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the longest you've taken your FUs for a while.

1867
02:18:27,166 --> 02:18:27,766
[SPEAKER_08]: For a while.

1868
02:18:28,207 --> 02:18:28,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1869
02:18:28,687 --> 02:18:30,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just... You know what it is, okay?

1870
02:18:31,701 --> 02:18:32,622
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on your period?

1871
02:18:33,762 --> 02:18:34,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up!

1872
02:18:34,463 --> 02:18:38,025
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just the stock excuse for women being upset.

1873
02:18:39,106 --> 02:18:39,967
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just shut up.

1874
02:18:40,007 --> 02:18:40,627
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I love you.

1875
02:18:42,228 --> 02:18:43,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'd love to kick your ass.

1876
02:18:45,791 --> 02:18:49,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, this is the worst thing I've ever seen, but he was cute, I have to say.

1877
02:18:49,453 --> 02:18:50,634
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy who played you in that movie?

1878
02:18:51,394 --> 02:18:52,075
[SPEAKER_08]: He was pretty cute.

1879
02:18:52,735 --> 02:18:58,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, though, I'm... Is this the Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game?

1880
02:18:59,778 --> 02:19:02,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I love how they play little clips from the movie and everything.

1881
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:03,140
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.

1882
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:04,300
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

1883
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:06,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that it was all that bad.

1884
02:19:08,322 --> 02:19:08,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1885
02:19:09,263 --> 02:19:13,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was, the movie was, the game was actually kind of okay to play.

1886
02:19:13,365 --> 02:19:15,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was very funny.

1887
02:19:18,387 --> 02:19:20,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope the chatroom's watching this, because this is damn hilarious.

1888
02:19:20,849 --> 02:19:25,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Webcam, moronsoundstrater.com Alright, anyway, any more FUs from Jamie?

1889
02:19:27,517 --> 02:19:27,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

1890
02:19:29,219 --> 02:19:31,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I have an F.U.

1891
02:19:31,681 --> 02:19:37,366
[SPEAKER_08]: to, um, man, just stuff, okay?

1892
02:19:37,466 --> 02:19:38,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Just stuff.

1893
02:19:38,767 --> 02:19:39,748
[SPEAKER_08]: A big F.U.

1894
02:19:43,572 --> 02:19:43,932
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1895
02:19:44,773 --> 02:19:45,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an F.U.

1896
02:19:45,794 --> 02:19:48,836
[SPEAKER_08]: to, uh, politics and politary.

1897
02:19:50,822 --> 02:19:56,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a big FU that goes to QRO because they're doing a storage wipe.

1898
02:19:56,905 --> 02:20:04,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means that I had to spread 78 different individual items among four characters on QRO.

1899
02:20:05,189 --> 02:20:08,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I tried to freakin' vend so I could get rid of some of my shit.

1900
02:20:09,111 --> 02:20:10,793
[SPEAKER_08]: and it wouldn't let me vend.

1901
02:20:10,893 --> 02:20:13,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It said, it just wouldn't let, it said, the item's eligible to vend.

1902
02:20:13,575 --> 02:20:13,755
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1903
02:20:13,875 --> 02:20:16,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had the same items that other people were vending so this is really pissing me off.

1904
02:20:16,957 --> 02:20:19,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, do I have to have a vending license to vend to this crap?

1905
02:20:19,799 --> 02:20:23,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can make so much zenny in that game but no.

1906
02:20:23,642 --> 02:20:35,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And then an FU goes toward me not being able to afford to do Final Fantasy XI because I was going to start playing again and also with my laptop I'd be able to keep typing to people while I'm playing Final Fantasy XI but now I can't do it so it's really pissing me off and I'm out of breath.

1907
02:20:35,812 --> 02:20:36,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, it's...

1908
02:20:39,252 --> 02:20:41,234
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm having to, like, write this all down to follow.

1909
02:20:43,016 --> 02:20:50,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, um, and if you do bad tasting, but perfectly textured low-carb cheesecake.

1910
02:20:54,468 --> 02:20:54,828
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

1911
02:20:54,969 --> 02:20:55,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Any more?

1912
02:20:55,649 --> 02:20:56,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting.

1913
02:20:56,951 --> 02:20:56,991
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

1914
02:20:57,231 --> 02:20:58,212
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, then moving on.

1915
02:20:58,272 --> 02:20:58,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1916
02:20:58,953 --> 02:20:59,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait.

1917
02:20:59,473 --> 02:20:59,694
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1918
02:21:00,325 --> 02:21:06,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Nevermind Let's see who our mystery guest is.

1919
02:21:06,167 --> 02:21:07,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey Jonas!

1920
02:21:07,468 --> 02:21:08,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, just during a spare part of the show too.

1921
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:10,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get to Loki's part.

1922
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:17,291
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, fuck you, the crack whore that tried to cut me off when the lanes were merging.

1923
02:21:17,331 --> 02:21:27,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I was driving to take my fiance home, okay, and the lanes were merging, we've already established, you know, it's already one lane, and we're just like coming together, you know, to be in parallel.

1924
02:21:27,557 --> 02:21:28,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So what does this dumb bitch do?

1925
02:21:28,639 --> 02:21:40,019
[SPEAKER_10]: She tries to cut around me, through a double yellow, on the opposite side of the street, like going the wrong direction, cuts through there, and like, passes me up to get behind this really slow guy that's in front of me.

1926
02:21:41,724 --> 02:21:42,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what the hell?

1927
02:21:42,906 --> 02:21:49,135
[SPEAKER_10]: So I flipped her off as I went by, and tried yelling at her, but, you know, she was ahead of me, so she probably couldn't hear me over my music.

1928
02:21:49,676 --> 02:21:51,879
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, yeah, she was a dumb bitch.

1929
02:21:51,999 --> 02:21:57,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I normally don't flip people off, I just yell, but this bitch pushed me that far, so, fuck you to her.

1930
02:21:57,847 --> 02:21:57,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1931
02:21:58,368 --> 02:22:01,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you the cosplayers that are fucking ugly, okay?

1932
02:22:01,450 --> 02:22:04,831
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a big fat whore, you don't need to be dressing up like an anime character.

1933
02:22:04,851 --> 02:22:09,553
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't make you hotter, it doesn't make you any cooler, it just makes you ugly and stupid looking.

1934
02:22:10,114 --> 02:22:13,015
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're a hairy man, please don't cosplay, Yuna.

1935
02:22:13,956 --> 02:22:18,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I really, I hate, you know, seeing these ugly ass people cosplaying.

1936
02:22:18,338 --> 02:22:20,639
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need any more ugly people in the world to die.

1937
02:22:20,799 --> 02:22:26,722
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing in defense, I think that if you don't have the body to do like the scantily clad animatrix, that's one thing.

1938
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:30,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Last time I checked, um, Yuna didn't have a gut.

1939
02:22:31,281 --> 02:22:32,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

1940
02:22:33,181 --> 02:22:35,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, and, oh, and that's another thing.

1941
02:22:35,941 --> 02:22:38,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Sailor Fatty, you're not part of the group.

1942
02:22:38,882 --> 02:22:39,402
[SPEAKER_10]: So get out.

1943
02:22:39,802 --> 02:22:40,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

1944
02:22:40,922 --> 02:22:46,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, also, you know, fuck you, the whole anime thing was just retarded, okay?

1945
02:22:46,963 --> 02:22:49,324
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just really a waste of my time.

1946
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:50,784
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the overcharging stuff.

1947
02:22:51,064 --> 02:22:55,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Last time I checked, you know, I don't think baseball cards had anything to do with anime, but, you know, hey, that shit was there, too.

1948
02:22:56,825 --> 02:22:56,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

1949
02:22:58,328 --> 02:23:07,396
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, just plain, fuck you to my cabinet because for some reason the wheels are starting to push through the bottom, which is not good if I want to move this thing.

1950
02:23:08,136 --> 02:23:11,779
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like on a little pedestal right now, so that kind of sucks.

1951
02:23:12,340 --> 02:23:16,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, fuck you to the sluts that I saw at the mall.

1952
02:23:16,623 --> 02:23:18,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear to God, they're just getting younger and younger.

1953
02:23:19,906 --> 02:23:21,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Just all these sluts out there.

1954
02:23:21,247 --> 02:23:23,509
[SPEAKER_10]: They were never around when I was in, you know, junior high.

1955
02:23:23,529 --> 02:23:24,329
[SPEAKER_10]: That really sucks.

1956
02:23:25,911 --> 02:23:27,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's it.

1957
02:23:30,808 --> 02:23:38,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going back to my old FU song because it was better than Bumblebee.

1958
02:23:40,157 --> 02:23:45,543
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to Lehigh County in Pennsylvania for being so goddamn boring.

1959
02:23:46,303 --> 02:23:51,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, you know what, FU to myself for not being more proactive about finding things to do.

1960
02:23:52,426 --> 02:24:00,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I think next time when I go back, because I'm going to have to go back eventually, I'll be better prepared for it, because I'm going to look up where I can go nerd out and play DDR and stuff, so I'll have a better time.

1961
02:24:01,633 --> 02:24:09,779
[SPEAKER_11]: But they did have one gay bar there, which I went to, and F you to the fact that there were only like 30 people in the whole place, considering this is the only gay bar for like hundreds of miles around town.

1962
02:24:10,579 --> 02:24:11,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever, what can you do?

1963
02:24:13,821 --> 02:24:17,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I'd like to give an F you for coming home and thinking the TV was stolen.

1964
02:24:19,105 --> 02:24:23,528
[SPEAKER_11]: And then realizing that Loki had taken the TV and put it in the machine.

1965
02:24:23,588 --> 02:24:23,888
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1966
02:24:24,729 --> 02:24:26,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the TV had been liberated.

1967
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:33,114
[SPEAKER_11]: But F you to my future friends' reaction when they come in this house and realize you're going to have to watch movies in an arcade machine.

1968
02:24:34,135 --> 02:24:36,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Until we can get something better figured out.

1969
02:24:37,917 --> 02:24:38,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's interesting.

1970
02:24:40,825 --> 02:24:41,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.

1971
02:24:42,667 --> 02:24:47,291
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to the fact that... FU to working 10 to 12 hour days, because that gets really old after a while.

1972
02:24:47,952 --> 02:24:50,694
[SPEAKER_11]: And FU to being on salary so I don't get overtime for it.

1973
02:24:52,276 --> 02:24:52,916
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's about it.

1974
02:24:53,957 --> 02:24:54,938
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really all I have to say.

1975
02:24:55,339 --> 02:24:57,461
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm always the less angsty one of the bunch.

1976
02:24:58,430 --> 02:24:58,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1977
02:24:59,231 --> 02:25:05,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, let's move on and see what our folks in the other folks in the room here have to say angsty tonight.

1978
02:25:05,995 --> 02:25:06,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Garrett!

1979
02:25:07,996 --> 02:25:11,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, by the way, some FU music tonight brought to us by Ryu Kosaka.

1980
02:25:12,519 --> 02:25:14,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, I got an FU song.

1981
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:15,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was... No, you get this.

1982
02:25:15,461 --> 02:25:16,062
[SPEAKER_09]: You get candy.

1983
02:25:16,442 --> 02:25:16,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, damn.

1984
02:25:16,942 --> 02:25:17,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1985
02:25:17,483 --> 02:25:20,765
[SPEAKER_09]: FU this song, even though I like candy.

1986
02:25:22,386 --> 02:25:23,186
[SPEAKER_09]: But I got tired of it.

1987
02:25:23,667 --> 02:25:24,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Played it out too many times.

1988
02:25:24,687 --> 02:25:25,088
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR.

1989
02:25:25,368 --> 02:25:25,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1990
02:25:26,168 --> 02:25:29,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you starts off with my sister for being the bitch that she is.

1991
02:25:29,729 --> 02:25:31,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen her in two weeks.

1992
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:38,593
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the minute she walks in the door, she instantly starts being a bitch about everything.

1993
02:25:39,933 --> 02:25:43,054
[SPEAKER_09]: But fuck her for making me chase the mailman.

1994
02:25:45,575 --> 02:25:59,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck her for lying to me and saying that mom knew she was drinking and that she could have some of my Smirnoff shit that was at my party and leaving it in my mom's room and stuff.

1995
02:26:00,745 --> 02:26:01,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1996
02:26:01,986 --> 02:26:02,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1997
02:26:03,187 --> 02:26:04,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I didn't get in trouble for it.

1998
02:26:04,148 --> 02:26:04,508
[SPEAKER_09]: She did.

1999
02:26:06,919 --> 02:26:11,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Tower for having such great sales and making me buy even more toys.

2000
02:26:11,961 --> 02:26:20,244
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a three day sale this week that was 25% off all their toys and I purchased twice online.

2001
02:26:21,525 --> 02:26:22,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Really big.

2002
02:26:24,166 --> 02:26:31,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck me for having a crush right now that makes me feel like I'm 16 and the world is going to revolve around it.

2003
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:36,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's fucking ridiculous and I hope I'm just having male PMS or something.

2004
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:44,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck me for being on vacation right now and not knowing what I'm going to do on vacation.

2005
02:26:44,346 --> 02:26:47,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting kind of tired of that right now.

2006
02:26:53,523 --> 02:26:58,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck my anal retentiveness and me not being happy with my room and stuff.

2007
02:26:58,646 --> 02:27:00,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't really have any more angstiness.

2008
02:27:03,148 --> 02:27:04,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

2009
02:27:04,769 --> 02:27:06,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Bug, do you have any FUs?

2010
02:27:07,971 --> 02:27:08,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming.

2011
02:27:08,751 --> 02:27:09,692
[SPEAKER_11]: A microphone's coming to you, Bug.

2012
02:27:10,666 --> 02:27:13,048
[SPEAKER_17]: mainly just a big ol' FU to my computer for not working.

2013
02:27:14,550 --> 02:27:15,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Not the Mac, of course.

2014
02:27:17,212 --> 02:27:18,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Next ever break.

2015
02:27:18,273 --> 02:27:18,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice, nice.

2016
02:27:19,535 --> 02:27:19,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that it?

2017
02:27:20,656 --> 02:27:25,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, well, no, yeah, because everything else I fixed this week, like the car and...

2018
02:27:27,277 --> 02:27:27,497
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2019
02:27:27,517 --> 02:27:29,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Picking somebody up at the airport at 2 a.m.

2020
02:27:29,118 --> 02:27:29,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

2021
02:27:30,058 --> 02:27:30,698
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2022
02:27:30,838 --> 02:27:31,238
[SPEAKER_11]: F you, buddy.

2023
02:27:31,598 --> 02:27:31,938
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2024
02:27:33,178 --> 02:27:36,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to Jonas, who showed up during the original angst there.

2025
02:27:36,579 --> 02:27:37,319
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

2026
02:27:37,419 --> 02:27:40,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Also known as Explicit with the triple X. Yeah.

2027
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:41,360
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2028
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:41,700
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

2029
02:27:42,580 --> 02:27:43,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Not much.

2030
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:44,921
[SPEAKER_19]: Should I just put my F yous right now?

2031
02:27:45,101 --> 02:27:45,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2032
02:27:45,521 --> 02:27:45,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Get them out.

2033
02:27:46,521 --> 02:27:47,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2034
02:27:47,101 --> 02:27:48,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, it's a three-hour show.

2035
02:27:48,341 --> 02:27:49,162
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't worry.

2036
02:27:49,242 --> 02:27:51,142
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have that many F yous this time.

2037
02:27:52,728 --> 02:27:55,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we gotta turn, you gotta back your mic up a little bit.

2038
02:27:56,052 --> 02:27:57,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, is it really that loud?

2039
02:27:57,694 --> 02:27:58,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes it is.

2040
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:00,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay.

2041
02:28:01,582 --> 02:28:04,084
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to me for being long last minute this whole week.

2042
02:28:04,985 --> 02:28:08,428
[SPEAKER_19]: God, showing up to work like 15 minutes late is not good.

2043
02:28:10,730 --> 02:28:14,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, and since I've, anybody heard about the Biggest Field California Tournament?

2044
02:28:15,754 --> 02:28:15,994
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

2045
02:28:16,815 --> 02:28:17,255
[SPEAKER_19]: What's this?

2046
02:28:17,395 --> 02:28:26,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Good, because I went to hell, so I'm going to give an F you to some of the organizers for not taking, looking up how tournaments are supposed to be run.

2047
02:28:27,964 --> 02:28:31,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you know how tournaments are done by PA, right?

2048
02:28:31,268 --> 02:28:32,049
[SPEAKER_19]: They did it by score.

2049
02:28:34,409 --> 02:28:34,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh dear.

2050
02:28:35,290 --> 02:28:42,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, there's a lot of problems with that, and they're not taking constructive criticism from other people, which is another bad thing.

2051
02:28:42,294 --> 02:28:43,115
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not a good sign.

2052
02:28:43,475 --> 02:28:47,398
[SPEAKER_19]: They think it's all good and everything, but there are some flaws that they should listen to.

2053
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:55,183
[SPEAKER_19]: On the other hand, F you to certain people who try to ruin a tournament for two hours.

2054
02:28:55,483 --> 02:28:58,145
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard rumors about a two-hour delay on that tournament.

2055
02:28:59,106 --> 02:29:03,269
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I'll say F you to whoever screwed up my tournament.

2056
02:29:04,249 --> 02:29:11,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Even though I heard rumors that he was in Zuma at 4-6-9, the one who did the same thing to my tournament, if that's true, he's banned out of my tournament.

2057
02:29:12,436 --> 02:29:16,119
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm serious, because nobody should be banning a tournament for that long.

2058
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:18,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Screwing a tournament for two hours is not fun.

2059
02:29:18,922 --> 02:29:25,488
[SPEAKER_19]: Especially when people have to drive all the way back from San Francisco, California, or Fresno, or even SoCal.

2060
02:29:26,772 --> 02:29:31,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to go to the tournament, then later on getting delayed for a whole lot and getting pissed off because of all the blah, blah, blah.

2061
02:29:31,976 --> 02:29:33,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Wah, wah, wah.

2062
02:29:33,717 --> 02:29:34,938
[SPEAKER_19]: Wah, my pussy hurts.

2063
02:29:34,998 --> 02:29:35,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Wah.

2064
02:29:35,719 --> 02:29:36,579
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, damn pussy.

2065
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:37,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's the thing.

2066
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:39,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Get this right, you guys.

2067
02:29:39,522 --> 02:29:41,623
[SPEAKER_19]: If you don't like the rules of the tournament, don't go.

2068
02:29:41,723 --> 02:29:42,624
[SPEAKER_19]: It's simple as that.

2069
02:29:42,704 --> 02:29:46,367
[SPEAKER_19]: If you go to the tournament and you know the rules are fucked up, and you go, you're going to argue.

2070
02:29:46,587 --> 02:29:47,708
[SPEAKER_19]: You're just causing some trouble.

2071
02:29:50,089 --> 02:29:51,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, what would you rather do?

2072
02:29:51,771 --> 02:29:53,232
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you do something like that, Dumb Sky?

2073
02:29:53,252 --> 02:29:53,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

2074
02:29:54,432 --> 02:30:02,419
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but I'll probably... Sacramento's so sad now at Bomani, I'm probably not even going to ever run a tournament or even help run a tournament ever again, so we'll see.

2075
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:06,463
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'll still run tournaments, regardless of what's going on and stuff.

2076
02:30:07,244 --> 02:30:09,306
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would never run one by score, that's for sure.

2077
02:30:09,546 --> 02:30:10,447
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, that's one thing.

2078
02:30:10,687 --> 02:30:11,748
[SPEAKER_19]: Never run by score.

2079
02:30:13,930 --> 02:30:14,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

2080
02:30:15,071 --> 02:30:18,394
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to squirrels for eating my damn food from camping.

2081
02:30:19,876 --> 02:30:20,116
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't...

2082
02:30:21,092 --> 02:30:28,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing a bunch of spit all over the damn steak that I've cooked for two hours and shit is not good.

2083
02:30:29,117 --> 02:30:34,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Therefore, even though I whipped the living shit out of those squirrels, I'm not sure if you all saw this whip right here.

2084
02:30:34,980 --> 02:30:37,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you borrow that from Erin?

2085
02:30:38,082 --> 02:30:39,322
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this is mine, dammit.

2086
02:30:39,362 --> 02:30:41,484
[SPEAKER_19]: I told you that I have my own whip.

2087
02:30:42,064 --> 02:30:43,505
[SPEAKER_19]: You should have showed Erin this whip.

2088
02:30:43,545 --> 02:30:44,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if she's interested.

2089
02:30:47,737 --> 02:30:51,761
[SPEAKER_19]: And F you for getting bit by...bent the ass by ants during camping.

2090
02:30:55,664 --> 02:30:57,205
[SPEAKER_19]: No fucking comment on that one.

2091
02:30:57,325 --> 02:31:01,469
[SPEAKER_19]: And F you for losing my toothbrush during camping.

2092
02:31:02,430 --> 02:31:04,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Not brushing your teeth for two days sucks.

2093
02:31:04,411 --> 02:31:08,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Speaking of that, I saw a bear during camping.

2094
02:31:09,352 --> 02:31:10,032
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you see Bigfoot?

2095
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:11,553
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I saw Bigfoot.

2096
02:31:11,573 --> 02:31:12,233
[SPEAKER_19]: I did not get eaten.

2097
02:31:12,253 --> 02:31:18,035
[SPEAKER_19]: He was just walking around sniffing on those pussies and stuff.

2098
02:31:18,115 --> 02:31:18,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2099
02:31:18,615 --> 02:31:21,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Was he pussyfooting around?

2100
02:31:21,936 --> 02:31:23,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, he was pussyfooting around.

2101
02:31:26,998 --> 02:31:35,329
[SPEAKER_19]: and Effie for the horse for fucking sweeping the tail that he took a shit on in the back of my shirt.

2102
02:31:35,349 --> 02:31:36,370
[SPEAKER_19]: That was gross.

2103
02:31:38,032 --> 02:31:40,115
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't wag your tail with all that shit in your...

2104
02:31:42,117 --> 02:31:43,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'm cutting you off, buddy.

2105
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:45,900
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Garrett.

2106
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:46,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2107
02:31:46,980 --> 02:31:48,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one last major F you.

2108
02:31:48,501 --> 02:31:52,564
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to my dog for having to fucking dog sit it while my parents were gone.

2109
02:31:52,624 --> 02:31:56,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to wake up to that fucking garbage disposal vomiting peach pits one morning.

2110
02:31:58,888 --> 02:31:59,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anything else?

2111
02:31:59,989 --> 02:32:01,209
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, that's all for now.

2112
02:32:01,349 --> 02:32:01,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright.

2113
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:03,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Told you it was going to be a three hour show, but...

2114
02:32:04,523 --> 02:32:07,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's move on to chatroom FUs.

2115
02:32:08,064 --> 02:32:10,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Brought to us, the music is Dive Into the Night.

2116
02:32:10,685 --> 02:32:11,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Camera nudity.

2117
02:32:11,725 --> 02:32:12,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Camera nudity.

2118
02:32:12,566 --> 02:32:12,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Camera nudity.

2119
02:32:13,566 --> 02:32:14,346
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the nudity?

2120
02:32:14,707 --> 02:32:16,007
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the nudity on camera now?

2121
02:32:18,728 --> 02:32:19,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

2122
02:32:19,928 --> 02:32:20,789
[SPEAKER_11]: What game is that?

2123
02:32:21,789 --> 02:32:23,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that Gals Panic on the camera?

2124
02:32:26,210 --> 02:32:28,151
[SPEAKER_11]: The cam's over at orangelonradio.com.

2125
02:32:31,632 --> 02:32:32,873
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys are crazy.

2126
02:32:36,949 --> 02:32:38,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like, it's supposed to be, like, the Zonk stage.

2127
02:32:40,051 --> 02:32:41,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, moving on.

2128
02:32:41,772 --> 02:32:45,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, let's go and, uh, let's see what our chatroom FUs have to say.

2129
02:32:46,295 --> 02:32:55,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Dark Knight says, uh, FU to Rain, Rain, Rain, nothing but rain all week long, another being a broke-ass person yet again, and a final FU to not having no car.

2130
02:32:56,282 --> 02:32:56,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2131
02:32:57,062 --> 02:32:59,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Dork wants to say an FU to myself.

2132
02:33:00,064 --> 02:33:00,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

2133
02:33:00,985 --> 02:33:01,465
[SPEAKER_11]: How sad.

2134
02:33:01,485 --> 02:33:05,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Yaki Tora, I hope I pronounced that right.

2135
02:33:05,388 --> 02:33:06,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Yaki, actually, it's probably Yaki.

2136
02:33:08,170 --> 02:33:09,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm white, okay.

2137
02:33:09,512 --> 02:33:14,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Just says, I want to send my FUs to the Kroger company because they love to fuck up people's paycheck.

2138
02:33:15,738 --> 02:33:15,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Ouch.

2139
02:33:18,781 --> 02:33:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a grocery store change.

2140
02:33:19,922 --> 02:33:20,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, that's right, it is.

2141
02:33:22,168 --> 02:33:22,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they're Ralphs.

2142
02:33:22,788 --> 02:33:23,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they're Ralphs on here.

2143
02:33:23,548 --> 02:33:24,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2144
02:33:24,168 --> 02:33:29,089
[SPEAKER_11]: StupidBaka says, wants to know if we do the FUs over PM or Skype.

2145
02:33:29,389 --> 02:33:33,010
[SPEAKER_11]: PM, we don't let people do them over Skype or else they'd go on as long as Jonas does.

2146
02:33:33,490 --> 02:33:33,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2147
02:33:37,591 --> 02:33:41,272
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkLionXPI says, only one FU tonight.

2148
02:33:41,432 --> 02:33:47,053
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to the little blonde girl who broke my concentration while playing Paranoia Survivor on DDR Gameworks yesterday.

2149
02:33:47,413 --> 02:33:49,456
[SPEAKER_11]: She moved in front of me like not knowing I was there.

2150
02:33:49,756 --> 02:33:53,441
[SPEAKER_11]: People like those piss me off the most and I just wanna hurt them physically so bad!

2151
02:33:54,738 --> 02:33:58,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Panda says, F you to my hair for wanting to style itself every morning.

2152
02:34:00,082 --> 02:34:03,725
[SPEAKER_11]: And John Fields says, F you to getting food poisoning.

2153
02:34:04,106 --> 02:34:05,907
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to no one calling me back for a job.

2154
02:34:05,927 --> 02:34:09,670
[SPEAKER_11]: F you fake gamers who ruin competitive games for everyone else.

2155
02:34:10,030 --> 02:34:14,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Metroid died today because of one of these runs.

2156
02:34:14,714 --> 02:34:19,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Blown away by an emulator, the real time of 55 minutes taking down to 47 minutes.

2157
02:34:21,340 --> 02:34:21,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

2158
02:34:23,743 --> 02:34:31,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, DDRholic says, F you to Jason for taking off for some unknown period of time and not even talking to me about it.

2159
02:34:32,646 --> 02:34:34,787
[SPEAKER_11]: F you for taking things that I say to the extreme.

2160
02:34:37,728 --> 02:34:37,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

2161
02:34:40,529 --> 02:34:42,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see the message not to repost.

2162
02:34:44,770 --> 02:34:45,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got someone in trouble.

2163
02:34:47,271 --> 02:34:49,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I think she was only, like, kind of, like, joking with those.

2164
02:34:51,877 --> 02:34:56,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't send me FUs unless you mean it, because honestly, since the way I get the FUs, I can't.

2165
02:34:56,943 --> 02:35:00,328
[SPEAKER_11]: If you tell me don't read this or something, then I don't see it.

2166
02:35:00,388 --> 02:35:02,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So sorry, guys.

2167
02:35:02,150 --> 02:35:04,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Sharkskrull says, FU to the village.

2168
02:35:04,833 --> 02:35:06,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't ruin it for everyone, but it sucked.

2169
02:35:06,636 --> 02:35:08,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I want that two hours of my life back.

2170
02:35:08,178 --> 02:35:09,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that movie was awesome!

2171
02:35:19,909 --> 02:35:21,971
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the best news you've seen in a long time.

2172
02:35:22,672 --> 02:35:28,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, VidPOWER says, F you to the whole www.ilovebees.com hype for Halo 2.

2173
02:35:29,438 --> 02:35:30,659
[SPEAKER_11]: It's boggling my mind.

2174
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:32,881
[SPEAKER_11]: What is ilovebees.com?

2175
02:35:38,046 --> 02:35:39,187
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't hear you, bug.

2176
02:35:40,468 --> 02:35:41,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't hear Loki either, amazing.

2177
02:35:48,064 --> 02:35:50,006
[SPEAKER_10]: It's alternate reality gaming, I think.

2178
02:35:51,028 --> 02:35:51,728
[SPEAKER_10]: That site.

2179
02:35:52,489 --> 02:35:53,090
[SPEAKER_10]: That sucks.

2180
02:35:54,772 --> 02:35:55,633
[SPEAKER_10]: More nudity on the cam.

2181
02:35:55,813 --> 02:35:56,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, anyways.

2182
02:36:00,378 --> 02:36:00,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2183
02:36:05,783 --> 02:36:17,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, uh, gosh, let's see, I guess at this time we're going to go to another break, and then we're going to come back and, what do you guys want to do, you want to do some Ask Orange Lounge, or do we have, alright, sure, why not, we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2184
02:36:18,427 --> 02:36:19,167
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Skype line.

2185
02:36:19,567 --> 02:36:25,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll do, we'll open up the Skype line if folks, and we'll open up the Skype lines for comments as well, and some Ask Orange Lounge to close out the show.

2186
02:36:25,729 --> 02:36:30,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, I'm going to pick some songs that sound cool for the Poppin' 11 soundtrack, I'm going to pick some on my own.

2187
02:36:30,731 --> 02:36:33,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know I want to play the Orange Airport song.

2188
02:36:33,093 --> 02:36:33,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely want to play that.

2189
02:36:34,034 --> 02:36:35,014
[SPEAKER_11]: The Orange Lounge song.

2190
02:36:35,675 --> 02:36:41,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to play that one because it's called Space Dog.

2191
02:36:41,719 --> 02:36:42,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and it's Sana.

2192
02:36:42,360 --> 02:36:42,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

2193
02:36:42,620 --> 02:36:43,601
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even know that.

2194
02:36:44,141 --> 02:36:54,009
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll play... Okay, then I'm going to go back to number one and get some of the shorter ones.

2195
02:36:54,429 --> 02:36:58,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do... Wow, that has a really... Oh, we already heard that one.

2196
02:36:59,153 --> 02:36:59,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

2197
02:37:01,232 --> 02:37:01,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, what do you think?

2198
02:37:03,994 --> 02:37:05,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Hillbilly, I want to hear Hillbilly.

2199
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:08,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we're going to do Hillbilly.

2200
02:37:09,317 --> 02:37:12,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so these are the songs I'm going to play this break from Poppin' Music 11.

2201
02:37:12,259 --> 02:37:19,925
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to hear Orange Lounge with Orange Airline, Sauna with Space Dog, and Taisho in the Hillbilly genre with Pa La La 42.

2202
02:37:20,325 --> 02:37:21,826
[SPEAKER_11]: This should be interesting.

2203
02:37:23,127 --> 02:37:27,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Send your questions in for Ask Orange Lounge, and then we're going to wrap up the show when we come back.

2204
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:27,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

2205
02:37:34,262 --> 02:37:35,412
Thank you for watching!

2206
02:39:21,387 --> 02:39:24,169
Hello, Pedro, I'm a play-store, to run a story over stars.

2207
02:39:56,514 --> 02:39:57,876
Thank you for watching!

2208
02:40:29,734 --> 02:40:31,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

2209
02:40:58,952 --> 02:41:00,693
and the rest of the cast.

2210
02:41:53,066 --> 02:42:01,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Kodou ga kurui datu Nobichiru Candy Corral Aimai na kotoba metato Kimi ga Rhythm

2211
02:42:17,605 --> 02:42:30,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Pararara, so kanda mo itsumo karanmamori de Kauzen na koi wo kizumo tomerare demo Pararara, ima wa nanimo dekinai kedo Yume no tsuzuki nara pra pra pra pra

2212
02:42:52,891 --> 02:42:53,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2213
02:43:18,192 --> 02:43:22,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.

2214
02:43:37,591 --> 02:43:38,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Ask Orange Lounge

2215
02:43:57,065 --> 02:44:00,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2216
02:44:00,507 --> 02:44:03,810
[SPEAKER_11]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2217
02:44:04,530 --> 02:44:05,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I have a question.

2218
02:44:06,111 --> 02:44:07,452
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I want to find out.

2219
02:44:08,093 --> 02:44:11,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is Loki playing a game where guys are shaving other guys?

2220
02:44:18,140 --> 02:44:22,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Question number one comes from StupidBaka.

2221
02:44:23,144 --> 02:44:24,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Where did you go when you were out of town?

2222
02:44:25,968 --> 02:44:31,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to Allentown, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour north of Philadelphia.

2223
02:44:32,350 --> 02:44:34,290
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's very green out there.

2224
02:44:34,530 --> 02:44:37,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a restaurant called Friendly's, which was cute.

2225
02:44:38,371 --> 02:44:39,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I think is actually a chain out there.

2226
02:44:39,892 --> 02:44:40,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2227
02:44:40,272 --> 02:44:44,633
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so... Like, there's probably East Coast people listening to this show going, nothing special.

2228
02:44:44,653 --> 02:44:48,834
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time I was on the East Coast, there was that Roy Rogers place that was utter crap.

2229
02:44:48,954 --> 02:44:52,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to Cracker Barrel, and that place... Cracker Barrel owns...

2230
02:44:53,672 --> 02:44:58,595
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have clove candy sticks from Cracker Barrel in my room, because they got me some as a going away present.

2231
02:44:59,195 --> 02:45:03,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much to the folks, I know that of course they would never listen to the show, but the folks out there were so good to me.

2232
02:45:03,758 --> 02:45:09,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they made that town bearable, honestly, and they bought me gifts and stuff, so that was great.

2233
02:45:09,101 --> 02:45:13,444
[SPEAKER_11]: StupidBanca also wants to know, and I can't believe somebody's asking this, but what is MAME?

2234
02:45:14,564 --> 02:45:14,845
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2235
02:45:16,285 --> 02:45:18,186
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a multi-arcade machine emulator.

2236
02:45:18,227 --> 02:45:22,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Caller, hold on a minute, I'll get to you in a minute, but what is MAME, is the person wants to know.

2237
02:45:25,037 --> 02:45:25,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they hung up.

2238
02:45:26,158 --> 02:45:26,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh well.

2239
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,500
[SPEAKER_11]: What is MAME?

2240
02:45:28,741 --> 02:45:31,483
[SPEAKER_08]: The Multi Arcade Machine Emulator.

2241
02:45:34,286 --> 02:45:34,986
[SPEAKER_11]: And what does it do?

2242
02:45:36,588 --> 02:45:39,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It emulates multiple arcade machines.

2243
02:45:41,793 --> 02:45:41,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2244
02:45:42,333 --> 02:45:43,094
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good stuff though.

2245
02:45:44,155 --> 02:45:46,057
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call the person back that just called us.

2246
02:45:53,965 --> 02:45:55,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw, it says he's busy now.

2247
02:45:55,386 --> 02:45:56,026
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?

2248
02:45:58,328 --> 02:45:58,708
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2249
02:46:00,329 --> 02:46:01,189
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see if he calls back.

2250
02:46:03,811 --> 02:46:05,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on, we'll go to number two question.

2251
02:46:08,213 --> 02:46:09,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two question.

2252
02:46:10,254 --> 02:46:13,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Yaki wants to know, or Yaki Tora, or maybe it's just Tora, I don't know.

2253
02:46:13,856 --> 02:46:14,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a question.

2254
02:46:14,917 --> 02:46:16,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is Jamie so damn angsty tonight?

2255
02:46:17,358 --> 02:46:19,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Her rants were as long as the horror of the village.

2256
02:46:20,834 --> 02:46:22,075
[SPEAKER_08]: The Village was good!

2257
02:46:23,417 --> 02:46:30,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't help it if the majority of people who saw that movie didn't stop to think about it, but still, it was a very good movie, okay?

2258
02:46:31,446 --> 02:46:33,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well moving on, why are you so angsty?

2259
02:46:33,549 --> 02:46:34,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that why you're so angsty?

2260
02:46:35,211 --> 02:46:37,894
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm angsty for other, other reasons.

2261
02:46:40,911 --> 02:46:41,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of them.

2262
02:46:41,291 --> 02:46:41,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Personal reasons.

2263
02:46:42,372 --> 02:46:43,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Many reasons.

2264
02:46:43,273 --> 02:46:44,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Many reasons.

2265
02:46:44,574 --> 02:46:45,895
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay to be angry once in a while.

2266
02:46:45,915 --> 02:46:49,358
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this time of year is when I get really horribly angsty like that.

2267
02:46:49,418 --> 02:46:56,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is weird because with me, I'm... Tora would just like to point out they've actually never seen The Village.

2268
02:46:56,143 --> 02:46:57,524
[SPEAKER_11]: They were just saying that to ruffle some feathers.

2269
02:46:57,785 --> 02:46:58,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Well then go see it.

2270
02:47:00,086 --> 02:47:01,227
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good movie.

2271
02:47:02,609 --> 02:47:03,049
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2272
02:47:03,429 --> 02:47:05,330
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not just a good movie.

2273
02:47:05,370 --> 02:47:06,370
[SPEAKER_08]: It was an excellent movie.

2274
02:47:06,450 --> 02:47:07,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a movie.

2275
02:47:07,751 --> 02:47:10,711
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a very smart movie, okay?

2276
02:47:11,092 --> 02:47:15,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Shark Scroll says, I thought about the movie, and I still thought it sucked.

2277
02:47:18,634 --> 02:47:20,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you obviously didn't watch it with the right frame of mind.

2278
02:47:21,575 --> 02:47:21,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Well.

2279
02:47:22,655 --> 02:47:24,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't intended to scare.

2280
02:47:25,076 --> 02:47:29,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's getting mixed reviews, so it's probably just getting mixed feedback from everybody, you know?

2281
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:31,120
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't scary.

2282
02:47:31,160 --> 02:47:32,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very good.

2283
02:47:32,101 --> 02:47:34,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the type of movie I was right in the mood to see.

2284
02:47:34,781 --> 02:47:41,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see, but now I'm kind of like, I've heard so many negative things, but I've heard some good things, but I'm kind of like, now maybe I'll wait for video.

2285
02:47:41,823 --> 02:47:42,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2286
02:47:42,924 --> 02:47:46,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Rob, you are going to go see it with me, and I'm going to pay for you to see it.

2287
02:47:47,332 --> 02:47:48,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hey, free movie!

2288
02:47:48,933 --> 02:47:50,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I'll let you guys know what I thought.

2289
02:47:50,473 --> 02:47:51,654
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2290
02:47:52,834 --> 02:47:54,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

2291
02:47:57,436 --> 02:47:57,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

2292
02:47:59,937 --> 02:48:00,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I got his questions.

2293
02:48:01,577 --> 02:48:02,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Kyle!

2294
02:48:02,518 --> 02:48:10,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Our old buddy Kyle Snyder wants to know, I've decided that for the next few songs I want to work on, I want to move away from techno and trance.

2295
02:48:11,081 --> 02:48:16,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you want me to work on some genres that involve vocals, like house, two-step, and jazz?

2296
02:48:16,905 --> 02:48:22,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Or should I do some non-vocal genres, like drum and bass, progressive, and big beat?

2297
02:48:23,469 --> 02:48:24,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to hear some drum and bass.

2298
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:26,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I like drum and bass, too.

2299
02:48:27,031 --> 02:48:29,313
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would like to hear some two-step from Kyle, actually.

2300
02:48:29,333 --> 02:48:30,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be kind of cool.

2301
02:48:33,735 --> 02:48:34,816
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be kind of neat, I think.

2302
02:48:35,917 --> 02:48:36,237
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2303
02:48:38,405 --> 02:48:38,685
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2304
02:48:39,465 --> 02:48:41,246
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess, does anybody else have any feedback?

2305
02:48:42,846 --> 02:48:43,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody?

2306
02:48:43,246 --> 02:48:43,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody?

2307
02:48:44,106 --> 02:48:44,326
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2308
02:48:44,567 --> 02:48:44,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

2309
02:48:45,627 --> 02:48:46,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it to yourselves.

2310
02:48:48,127 --> 02:48:51,368
[SPEAKER_11]: DDRholic wants to know, do you still love me, Rob?

2311
02:48:51,388 --> 02:48:53,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And the answer is yes.

2312
02:48:56,149 --> 02:48:59,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like Whitney Houston, I will always love you.

2313
02:49:01,551 --> 02:49:03,891
[SPEAKER_11]: That was my rendition of Whitney.

2314
02:49:04,872 --> 02:49:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been moved, Rob.

2315
02:49:06,392 --> 02:49:06,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

2316
02:49:07,270 --> 02:49:08,551
[SPEAKER_06]: At least my stomach moved a little.

2317
02:49:11,934 --> 02:49:12,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

2318
02:49:14,276 --> 02:49:17,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody in the chatroom wants to say, what is Two-Step exactly?

2319
02:49:18,860 --> 02:49:19,940
[SPEAKER_11]: What is Two-Step exactly?

2320
02:49:20,261 --> 02:49:23,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Play some... I would say like Jack and Mark Get Busy.

2321
02:49:23,263 --> 02:49:24,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Distant Sounds.

2322
02:49:25,598 --> 02:49:27,160
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's the funny thing about two-step?

2323
02:49:29,362 --> 02:49:32,526
[SPEAKER_09]: British people claim they're the only people who can make two-step.

2324
02:49:33,367 --> 02:49:40,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like they can only make trip-hop, because we're just supposed to be making down-tempo, because there's supposed to be a difference.

2325
02:49:44,399 --> 02:49:44,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2326
02:49:46,482 --> 02:49:49,283
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Skype line is still open if you want to give us a call.

2327
02:49:50,083 --> 02:49:52,484
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see if anybody wants to call.

2328
02:49:53,484 --> 02:49:55,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but in the meantime, we have another question.

2329
02:49:55,585 --> 02:50:01,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Vid Palace says, Speaking of MAME, what is your favorite classic arcade Konami game?

2330
02:50:01,926 --> 02:50:03,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Mine is The Simpsons.

2331
02:50:03,247 --> 02:50:04,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, this is a good question.

2332
02:50:04,287 --> 02:50:05,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Konami World.

2333
02:50:05,447 --> 02:50:06,608
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all a bunch of Konami whores.

2334
02:50:06,628 --> 02:50:07,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Konami World.

2335
02:50:07,528 --> 02:50:08,368
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that one all about?

2336
02:50:08,868 --> 02:50:11,309
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a game where they took a bunch of...

2337
02:50:12,985 --> 02:50:17,848
[SPEAKER_08]: other Konami games made them into one game like these two people made it into the Konami universe or something.

2338
02:50:18,408 --> 02:50:19,168
[SPEAKER_07]: There were two of them.

2339
02:50:19,308 --> 02:50:20,109
[SPEAKER_07]: They were kind of fun.

2340
02:50:22,050 --> 02:50:27,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I think about it, I think they came out on the Famicom too, way back when.

2341
02:50:29,934 --> 02:50:31,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else care to answer this one?

2342
02:50:32,015 --> 02:50:32,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Bugged.

2343
02:50:32,695 --> 02:50:33,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2344
02:50:33,675 --> 02:50:34,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Jamie?

2345
02:50:34,376 --> 02:50:34,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Twinbee.

2346
02:50:35,216 --> 02:50:35,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Twinbee.

2347
02:50:36,217 --> 02:50:36,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

2348
02:50:37,437 --> 02:50:37,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Bugged.

2349
02:50:39,558 --> 02:50:40,759
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop standing on the cable.

2350
02:50:43,123 --> 02:51:04,022
[SPEAKER_17]: it's hazardous for us both I can't stand the symptoms because I worked at a place that had it for two years and that's all I would hear every day was Bart and Lisa screaming like when they do that thing when they're running through it and that's when it sounded like a screaming baby yes, when I worked at Mountain Mike's do they have any shoot-em-ups?

2351
02:51:05,543 --> 02:51:09,507
[SPEAKER_11]: my favorite classic, and I'm going back to classic, classic Konami arcade game

2352
02:51:10,689 --> 02:51:14,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Motherfuckin' Time Pilot is my favorite classic arcade game by Konami.

2353
02:51:14,710 --> 02:51:15,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Time Pilot.

2354
02:51:15,810 --> 02:51:17,331
[SPEAKER_17]: Gradius, uh, what was the second one?

2355
02:51:17,351 --> 02:51:17,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Life Force?

2356
02:51:18,171 --> 02:51:27,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Gradius... It was Life Force on the NES in America, but it was Salamander in Arcade Japan.

2357
02:51:29,074 --> 02:51:30,374
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't go to the Arcade in Japan.

2358
02:51:31,315 --> 02:51:32,835
[SPEAKER_17]: I just played it on the NES.

2359
02:51:33,195 --> 02:51:34,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Life Force is cool.

2360
02:51:35,236 --> 02:51:35,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Alrighty.

2361
02:51:36,956 --> 02:51:37,136
No.

2362
02:51:38,717 --> 02:51:39,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care if you're the motherfuckin' host.

2363
02:51:41,678 --> 02:51:43,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, Bugged and DarkSakura are having a fight.

2364
02:51:46,101 --> 02:51:47,642
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're holding your hand like it's a gun.

2365
02:51:51,124 --> 02:51:52,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give her my mic if you're not careful.

2366
02:51:55,747 --> 02:51:56,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Parodius.

2367
02:51:57,528 --> 02:51:59,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, specifically, Oshaberry Parodius.

2368
02:52:02,031 --> 02:52:03,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Garrett, I know you're a big Konami whore.

2369
02:52:03,592 --> 02:52:06,334
[SPEAKER_11]: What other Konami arcade game classic ones are your favorites?

2370
02:52:07,270 --> 02:52:10,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I never really got to play a lot of arcade games when I was a kid.

2371
02:52:10,591 --> 02:52:12,392
[SPEAKER_09]: The ones I did play, I don't remember who made them.

2372
02:52:13,712 --> 02:52:14,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's kind of sad.

2373
02:52:15,893 --> 02:52:17,333
[SPEAKER_17]: And somebody did say Pervious.

2374
02:52:17,674 --> 02:52:23,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Just say, just say like, I don't know, what else was Konami?

2375
02:52:23,235 --> 02:52:24,996
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to think of the old school Konami games.

2376
02:52:25,016 --> 02:52:28,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I can only think of... Track and Field, just say Track and Field.

2377
02:52:28,717 --> 02:52:30,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I love Track and Field!

2378
02:52:30,278 --> 02:52:32,078
[SPEAKER_11]: I can only think of the damn Capcom fighting games.

2379
02:52:33,099 --> 02:52:33,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2380
02:52:34,380 --> 02:52:35,541
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually have a lot of games.

2381
02:52:35,681 --> 02:52:38,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I think Konami was involved with Frogger at one point.

2382
02:52:39,043 --> 02:52:42,785
[SPEAKER_11]: But all I know is they didn't make BurgerTime, so, sorry guys.

2383
02:52:42,885 --> 02:52:44,225
[SPEAKER_11]: More questions from our chatroom.

2384
02:52:44,546 --> 02:52:48,548
[SPEAKER_11]: EvilNauki2DX wants to know, he just said, I have a question.

2385
02:52:48,608 --> 02:52:48,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, here it is.

2386
02:52:49,468 --> 02:52:53,651
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that game being played on the webcam right now with all the naked anime ladies?

2387
02:52:54,651 --> 02:52:55,492
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Gal's Panic.

2388
02:52:55,552 --> 02:52:57,793
[SPEAKER_11]: It's simply just Gal's Panic.

2389
02:52:58,173 --> 02:52:59,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Not Gal's Panic 95 or anything like that?

2390
02:52:59,774 --> 02:52:59,814
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2391
02:53:02,964 --> 02:53:06,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki says, Galspanic Super S2 is the one he's playing right now.

2392
02:53:07,147 --> 02:53:08,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh... And it's beating his ass.

2393
02:53:10,049 --> 02:53:12,011
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on a really advanced stage at this point, isn't he?

2394
02:53:13,492 --> 02:53:13,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2395
02:53:14,172 --> 02:53:14,493
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2396
02:53:15,253 --> 02:53:15,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2397
02:53:17,475 --> 02:53:27,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... I guess, uh, at this point, it's almost time to kind of wrap up the show, but I was hoping that somebody would call in on the Skype line, but we didn't get anybody!

2398
02:53:28,623 --> 02:53:29,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Boo!

2399
02:53:29,544 --> 02:53:30,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Boo to that.

2400
02:53:30,404 --> 02:53:31,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody has a question.

2401
02:53:32,995 --> 02:53:35,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I cry.

2402
02:53:35,499 --> 02:53:36,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I see how it is.

2403
02:53:37,762 --> 02:53:39,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2404
02:53:41,047 --> 02:53:43,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to see how long the fortune cookie is tonight.

2405
02:53:43,150 --> 02:53:44,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a longer one.

2406
02:53:44,613 --> 02:53:45,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is.

2407
02:53:46,355 --> 02:53:48,759
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll probably start to wrap up the show here.

2408
02:53:49,468 --> 02:53:51,089
[SPEAKER_11]: since nobody's calling us on the Skype line.

2409
02:53:54,772 --> 02:53:56,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2410
02:53:56,693 --> 02:53:58,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to shut off the Skype line since nobody's using it.

2411
02:53:59,114 --> 02:54:01,256
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2412
02:54:01,296 --> 02:54:04,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for those that participated in tonight's Ask Orange Lounge.

2413
02:54:04,598 --> 02:54:06,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, final thoughts time.

2414
02:54:09,021 --> 02:54:10,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Bugged, final thought.

2415
02:54:12,904 --> 02:54:15,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, that was lovely.

2416
02:54:15,205 --> 02:54:16,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Final thought from Jonas.

2417
02:54:17,267 --> 02:54:17,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Jonas.

2418
02:54:20,987 --> 02:54:21,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks to be late.

2419
02:54:22,430 --> 02:54:24,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you here to plug anything tonight since you were late?

2420
02:54:24,994 --> 02:54:26,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

2421
02:54:28,159 --> 02:54:29,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, not really.

2422
02:54:29,301 --> 02:54:32,647
[SPEAKER_19]: School's about to start soon and a state fair is coming up soon.

2423
02:54:35,046 --> 02:54:35,727
[SPEAKER_19]: That's practically all.

2424
02:54:35,767 --> 02:54:36,567
[SPEAKER_19]: That's practically all.

2425
02:54:36,587 --> 02:54:37,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2426
02:54:38,929 --> 02:54:43,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I thought maybe you had like a, a tourney or a sim file or something, but I- Oh!

2427
02:54:43,492 --> 02:54:49,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I do have- I'm supposed to release Alpha Nova Vengeance, the one that Loki was asking for me to download.

2428
02:54:49,037 --> 02:54:50,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Did somebody already do that?

2429
02:54:50,918 --> 02:54:51,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2430
02:54:51,118 --> 02:55:00,065
[SPEAKER_19]: I checked the sim file itself, it's not really that great to download, if you're in- if it's- because the sim file that I made was a little too repetitive.

2431
02:55:01,061 --> 02:55:03,202
[SPEAKER_19]: and Inconsistent pattern-wise.

2432
02:55:04,062 --> 02:55:04,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2433
02:55:04,602 --> 02:55:07,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Because me and MJ are supposed to make the sim file by now.

2434
02:55:08,704 --> 02:55:11,525
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if Loki... Loki, didn't you say you wanted to do the background?

2435
02:55:11,545 --> 02:55:14,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Nah, you can do whatever.

2436
02:55:14,726 --> 02:55:14,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2437
02:55:14,866 --> 02:55:15,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I guess I'll do it.

2438
02:55:18,147 --> 02:55:18,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2439
02:55:18,847 --> 02:55:19,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2440
02:55:20,568 --> 02:55:21,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Garrett, your final thought.

2441
02:55:21,528 --> 02:55:23,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for coming tonight, by the way, and bringing us poppin' music stuff.

2442
02:55:24,089 --> 02:55:24,649
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your final thought?

2443
02:55:26,009 --> 02:55:26,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm...

2444
02:55:30,390 --> 02:55:31,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Very well said.

2445
02:55:32,251 --> 02:55:33,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your final thought.

2446
02:55:35,352 --> 02:55:37,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I want animal cookies and there's none left.

2447
02:55:37,612 --> 02:55:39,873
[SPEAKER_11]: There's crumbs.

2448
02:55:41,774 --> 02:55:47,656
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is Irish car bombs make my stomach sad, but they were very good.

2449
02:55:47,696 --> 02:55:47,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie.

2450
02:55:47,876 --> 02:55:47,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie.

2451
02:55:56,064 --> 02:55:59,105
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I'm going to go home and have some ice cream.

2452
02:56:01,005 --> 02:56:02,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Mmm, ice cream.

2453
02:56:03,206 --> 02:56:04,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Mmm, ice cream is good.

2454
02:56:05,106 --> 02:56:07,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, final word of the show tonight.

2455
02:56:07,767 --> 02:56:09,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to give it to Garrett.

2456
02:56:09,568 --> 02:56:10,708
[SPEAKER_11]: You can have the final word of tonight's show.

2457
02:56:10,728 --> 02:56:11,288
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want to say?

2458
02:56:12,548 --> 02:56:13,569
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I said home.

2459
02:56:13,629 --> 02:56:14,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2460
02:56:16,029 --> 02:56:16,349
[SPEAKER_11]: One word.

2461
02:56:20,911 --> 02:56:21,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Ligament.

2462
02:56:21,491 --> 02:56:21,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2463
02:56:22,856 --> 02:56:25,797
[SPEAKER_16]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2464
02:56:26,358 --> 02:56:29,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:56:47,384 --> 02:56:48,264
[SPEAKER_14]: I love to smoke.

2468
02:56:48,965 --> 02:56:50,825
[SPEAKER_14]: I love to smoke and I love to eat red meat.

2469
02:56:50,865 --> 02:56:52,606
[SPEAKER_14]: I love to eat raw fucking red meat.

2470
02:56:52,826 --> 02:56:56,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing I like better than sucking down a hot steaming cheeseburger and a butt at the same time.

2471
02:56:56,728 --> 02:56:57,268
[SPEAKER_14]: I love to smoke.

2472
02:56:57,308 --> 02:57:00,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I love to eat red meat and only eat red meat that comes from cows who smoke, okay?

2473
02:57:01,369 --> 02:57:04,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Special cows they grow in Virginia with voice boxes in their necks.

2474
02:57:07,151 --> 02:57:08,212
[SPEAKER_14]: I tried eating vegetarian.

2475
02:57:08,232 --> 02:57:09,632
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like a wimp going into a restaurant.

2476
02:57:09,652 --> 02:57:10,433
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you want to eat, sir?

2477
02:57:10,693 --> 02:57:11,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Broccoli?

2478
02:57:12,276 --> 02:57:13,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Broccoli's the side dish, folks.

2479
02:57:13,697 --> 02:57:15,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Always was, always will be, okay?

2480
02:57:15,798 --> 02:57:17,619
[SPEAKER_14]: When they ask me what I want to say, what do you think I want?

2481
02:57:17,659 --> 02:57:18,139
[SPEAKER_14]: This is America.

2482
02:57:18,179 --> 02:57:19,560
[SPEAKER_14]: I want a bowl of raw red meat right now.

2483
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:20,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Forget about that.

2484
02:57:20,580 --> 02:57:22,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring me a live cow over to the table.

2485
02:57:22,942 --> 02:57:26,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll carve off what I want and ride the rest.

2486
02:57:26,504 --> 02:57:30,526
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to open my own place.

2487
02:57:31,126 --> 02:57:32,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Open my own restaurant and get away from you people.

2488
02:57:32,707 --> 02:57:36,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to open my own restaurant with two smoking sections, ultra and regular, okay?

2489
02:57:37,668 --> 02:57:55,116
[SPEAKER_14]: and we're not going to have any tables or any chairs or any napkins, none of that pussy shit, just a big wide open black space and all we're going to serve is raw meat right on the bone and only men are going to eat their naked men sitting around a big giant campfire and no men's room either, you have to piss, you mark your territory like a wolf and if some guy has a heart attack from eating too much meat, fuck him, we throw him in the fire more meat for the other meat eaters, yeah!

2490
02:57:57,877 --> 02:57:58,858
[SPEAKER_14]: because you've got to have goals

2491
02:58:01,161 --> 02:58:03,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Because everybody in this room knows everybody who's quitting me.

2492
02:58:03,522 --> 02:58:04,763
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have that friend who's quitting you.

2493
02:58:04,783 --> 02:58:05,183
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

2494
02:58:05,203 --> 02:58:05,923
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy's quitting everything.

2495
02:58:05,943 --> 02:58:06,424
[SPEAKER_14]: I quit smoking.

2496
02:58:06,444 --> 02:58:06,984
[SPEAKER_14]: I quit drugs.

2497
02:58:07,264 --> 02:58:07,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I quit drinking.

2498
02:58:07,824 --> 02:58:09,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I quit meeting out here.

2499
02:58:09,745 --> 02:58:11,226
[SPEAKER_14]: I get up in the morning with a nice big bowl of oat bran.

2500
02:58:11,266 --> 02:58:12,527
[SPEAKER_14]: I go to the bathroom for three and a half hours.

2501
02:58:13,567 --> 02:58:14,588
[SPEAKER_14]: I have another bowl of oat bran.

2502
02:58:14,608 --> 02:58:16,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I go back in the bathroom for six more hours.

2503
02:58:16,369 --> 02:58:17,729
[SPEAKER_14]: All I do is eat and shit.

2504
02:58:18,069 --> 02:58:19,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to live forever.

2505
02:58:19,370 --> 02:58:22,452
[SPEAKER_14]: My colon is the strongest muscle in my body right now.

2506
02:58:22,892 --> 02:58:25,073
[SPEAKER_14]: I could pass Elvis through my colon right now.

2507
02:58:27,259 --> 02:58:51,577
[SPEAKER_14]: And all these cereals they have, crackling oat bran and horking fiber chunks, you know Cereal used to come with free prizes, now it comes with a free roll of toilet paper in every box Guys get up on Sunday morning, forget about the New York Times, I'm gonna need the Bible, I got a big one brewing here Dad, there's a phone call, I'm on Genesis, goddammit You tell them to call back after the creation People checking their own feces for fiber, you have too much free fucking time on your hands, okay?

2508
02:58:55,467 --> 02:58:58,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Red meat, white meat, blue meat, meat, oh fucking Ranma, you will eat it!

2509
02:58:59,108 --> 02:59:01,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Because not eating meat is a decision, eating meat is an instinct!

2510
02:59:02,629 --> 02:59:03,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I know what it's about!

2511
02:59:04,169 --> 02:59:06,410
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to eat the meat because I love the animals!

2512
02:59:07,850 --> 02:59:08,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the animals!

2513
02:59:08,731 --> 02:59:09,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I love the animals too!

2514
02:59:09,611 --> 02:59:10,771
[SPEAKER_14]: I love my dog, he's so cute!

2515
02:59:10,991 --> 02:59:11,931
[SPEAKER_14]: My lovely little dog!

2516
02:59:12,652 --> 02:59:13,312
[SPEAKER_14]: He's so cute!

2517
02:59:13,332 --> 02:59:14,012
[SPEAKER_14]: There's the problem.

2518
02:59:14,232 --> 02:59:16,273
[SPEAKER_14]: We only want to save the cute animals, don't we?

2519
02:59:16,313 --> 02:59:16,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2520
02:59:16,813 --> 02:59:20,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't we just have animal auditions, line them up one by one, and interview them individually.

2521
02:59:20,734 --> 02:59:21,094
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you?

2522
02:59:21,274 --> 02:59:21,714
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm an otter.

2523
02:59:22,739 --> 02:59:23,199
[SPEAKER_14]: And what do you do?

2524
02:59:23,219 --> 02:59:31,063
[SPEAKER_14]: I swim around my back and do cute little human things with my hand You're free to go And what are you?

2525
02:59:31,183 --> 02:59:33,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a cow, get in the fucking truck, okay pal?

2526
02:59:33,965 --> 02:59:46,151
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm an animal, you're a baseball glove, get out of that truck I'm an animal, I have rights here, here's your fucking cousin, get out of the truck pal We kill the cows to make jackets out of them and then we kill each other for the jackets we made out of the cows

2527
02:59:47,702 --> 02:59:51,785
[SPEAKER_14]: You will eat the meat, folks, because this country was founded on two things, meat and war.

2528
02:59:51,825 --> 02:59:53,486
[SPEAKER_14]: You eat enough fucking meat, you want to kill somebody.

2529
02:59:53,506 --> 02:59:54,306
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the way it works.

2530
02:59:54,827 --> 02:59:57,288
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the ultimate American dream for me during that Persian Gulf War.

2531
02:59:57,308 --> 03:00:03,693
[SPEAKER_14]: I was sitting in my living room naked with a can of Budweiser and a three-inch steak watching the war live on TV.

2532
03:00:04,113 --> 03:00:07,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a six-foot erection with a giant cheeseburger on the end of it.

2533
03:00:08,055 --> 03:00:12,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I ate so much meat during the war, by the time it was over, three weeks later, I was like, no, no, no, we need to keep fighting.

2534
03:00:12,919 --> 03:00:14,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Make a couple of stops on our way home from the Persian Gulf.

2535
03:00:15,518 --> 03:00:16,899
[SPEAKER_14]: First stop, Vietnam.

2536
03:00:16,919 --> 03:00:18,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Surprise the fuck out of those people, huh?

2537
03:00:19,561 --> 03:00:20,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you make a movie?

2538
03:00:20,541 --> 03:00:21,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Not this time, pal.

2539
03:00:24,544 --> 03:00:43,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Personally, I think Mama Cass said it best when she said... All the leaves are... Monday...

2540
03:00:51,566 --> 03:00:55,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2541
03:01:14,585 --> 03:01:16,093
Thank you for watching!

2542
03:01:19,986 --> 03:01:22,308
[SPEAKER_11]: The Afterbirth The Afterbirth The Afterbirth

2543
03:01:48,976 --> 03:01:49,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.

2544
03:01:50,797 --> 03:01:52,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw, it's naked with a horse.

2545
03:01:52,478 --> 03:01:58,982
[SPEAKER_11]: One of our Orange Lounge buddies wanted us to call them while we had a chance here over the Skype line, so I'm going to go ahead and give her a call here.

2546
03:01:59,043 --> 03:01:59,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully it'll work.

2547
03:02:01,524 --> 03:02:02,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if it works.

2548
03:02:02,285 --> 03:02:04,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to see if she answers.

2549
03:02:10,430 --> 03:02:11,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Please answer.

2550
03:02:13,532 --> 03:02:13,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Dope.

2551
03:02:14,472 --> 03:02:15,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Problem with remote sound device.

2552
03:02:15,913 --> 03:02:16,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that sucks.

2553
03:02:17,745 --> 03:02:21,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'll open up the Skype line for an afterbirth call if somebody wants to call us.

2554
03:02:21,246 --> 03:02:21,666
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2555
03:02:22,106 --> 03:02:25,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, what are your big plans for this next week?

2556
03:02:25,447 --> 03:02:26,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything exciting?

2557
03:02:26,928 --> 03:02:32,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm going to try to slack off as much as possible except for gym time.

2558
03:02:34,190 --> 03:02:35,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to work out this week really bad.

2559
03:02:36,190 --> 03:02:42,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm planning on going to the gym actually as much as I can during the next couple weeks.

2560
03:02:43,432 --> 03:02:45,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, when I start school, I'm going to start running.

2561
03:02:46,767 --> 03:02:50,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be at ARC Monday and Wednesday, so I'll just go running.

2562
03:02:50,929 --> 03:02:51,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Or play DDR.

2563
03:02:55,112 --> 03:02:59,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I really should sign up for a gym, because I think I'd actually maybe use a gym membership if I was paying for it.

2564
03:02:59,814 --> 03:03:00,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Sign up for my gym.

2565
03:03:01,175 --> 03:03:03,316
[SPEAKER_11]: You go to Family Fitness, right?

2566
03:03:03,356 --> 03:03:03,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2567
03:03:03,997 --> 03:03:05,217
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one I would probably sign up with.

2568
03:03:05,237 --> 03:03:06,198
[SPEAKER_20]: They're everywhere.

2569
03:03:06,938 --> 03:03:07,899
[SPEAKER_11]: In this area, yeah.

2570
03:03:09,320 --> 03:03:09,720
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2571
03:03:09,800 --> 03:03:14,903
[SPEAKER_11]: The hotel I was at had a gym thing at it, but I was just too lazy to go.

2572
03:03:16,257 --> 03:03:16,757
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

2573
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:36,401
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not a bad idea.

2574
03:03:36,421 --> 03:03:38,222
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I did when I went to E3.

2575
03:03:38,402 --> 03:03:39,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I have my weights with me.

2576
03:03:39,483 --> 03:03:39,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2577
03:03:40,944 --> 03:03:42,525
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope we get to go to E3 again next year.

2578
03:03:42,545 --> 03:03:43,666
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be blissful.

2579
03:03:44,387 --> 03:03:44,887
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to go.

2580
03:03:45,928 --> 03:03:46,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be there.

2581
03:03:47,209 --> 03:03:48,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we're getting a call.

2582
03:03:48,510 --> 03:03:49,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray.

2583
03:03:50,932 --> 03:03:52,914
[SPEAKER_11]: You are on Orange Lounge Radio after birth.

2584
03:03:54,233 --> 03:03:55,434
[SPEAKER_18]: I joined a gym.

2585
03:03:57,536 --> 03:03:57,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

2586
03:03:57,856 --> 03:03:59,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you calling me fat?

2587
03:04:00,098 --> 03:04:01,359
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm messing with you, man.

2588
03:04:01,719 --> 03:04:07,364
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's a good thing to join a gym, but at the same time, your first week you're going to be in pain.

2589
03:04:08,004 --> 03:04:08,505
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

2590
03:04:08,625 --> 03:04:09,926
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kind of worked out before.

2591
03:04:10,246 --> 03:04:12,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't I just play DDR?

2592
03:04:12,568 --> 03:04:14,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, start off on the cardio, seriously.

2593
03:04:14,550 --> 03:04:15,871
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the easiest thing to start with.

2594
03:04:16,951 --> 03:04:19,794
[SPEAKER_08]: But the weight training, the first night I did weight training,

2595
03:04:21,152 --> 03:04:24,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I could not move my arms for like five days.

2596
03:04:24,876 --> 03:04:27,178
[SPEAKER_11]: I was so sore.

2597
03:04:27,259 --> 03:04:29,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to join one that has a big pool so I could swim.

2598
03:04:29,661 --> 03:04:31,223
[SPEAKER_11]: The one by my house has a pool.

2599
03:04:31,963 --> 03:04:33,085
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to come to spin with me.

2600
03:04:34,326 --> 03:04:35,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't you say that spin kicks your ass?

2601
03:04:36,248 --> 03:04:39,191
[SPEAKER_08]: It did the first couple times, but they let you take it easy the first time around.

2602
03:04:39,371 --> 03:04:39,852
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2603
03:04:39,972 --> 03:04:41,634
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a Jamie Yeti dude.

2604
03:04:41,774 --> 03:04:42,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you go to a gym?

2605
03:04:43,519 --> 03:04:44,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I do.

2606
03:04:44,219 --> 03:04:46,080
[SPEAKER_18]: I've recently joined one like about a week ago.

2607
03:04:46,220 --> 03:04:47,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And has it been effective?

2608
03:04:47,201 --> 03:04:49,162
[SPEAKER_11]: You got washboard abs and muscles now?

2609
03:04:50,262 --> 03:04:51,223
[SPEAKER_18]: Too early to say.

2610
03:04:52,183 --> 03:04:52,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty soon.

2611
03:04:52,804 --> 03:04:53,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Soon though, right?

2612
03:04:58,427 --> 03:04:58,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Soon enough.

2613
03:04:59,467 --> 03:04:59,867
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2614
03:05:00,127 --> 03:05:02,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I needed that, so thank you for yelling at me.

2615
03:05:02,509 --> 03:05:02,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I needed it.

2616
03:05:03,549 --> 03:05:04,149
[SPEAKER_18]: No problem, man.

2617
03:05:04,169 --> 03:05:04,390
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

2618
03:05:04,510 --> 03:05:04,770
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2619
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:04,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

2620
03:05:07,868 --> 03:05:10,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Afterbirth.

2621
03:05:10,130 --> 03:05:11,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys for tuning in and supporting Orange Laws Radio.

2622
03:05:12,531 --> 03:05:13,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Tomorrow night, Diversion.

2623
03:05:13,792 --> 03:05:15,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget, we're doing a little bit of a schedule switch.

2624
03:05:15,593 --> 03:05:16,313
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be permanent.

2625
03:05:16,774 --> 03:05:20,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Diversion will now be on Monday nights to accommodate Jamie going back to school.

2626
03:05:20,336 --> 03:05:22,857
[SPEAKER_11]: She will be doing Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night.

2627
03:05:23,298 --> 03:05:24,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So definitely tune in.

2628
03:05:24,638 --> 03:05:27,380
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Wednesday nights, who knows what will happen soon.

2629
03:05:27,460 --> 03:05:34,364
[SPEAKER_08]: People have to put up with me bitching about school now because I'm having to take... The classes that I'm actually taking in a classroom are Business Law.

2630
03:05:35,505 --> 03:05:51,731
[SPEAKER_08]: which is my Monday and Wednesday class which is going to suck ass and my other class is going to be Intro to Windows on Saturday because I can't test out of it because I don't have time to make it to the damn test because I don't have the days off you're going to be stuck doing it for a whole semester

2631
03:05:52,349 --> 03:05:52,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Half semester.

2632
03:05:53,750 --> 03:05:55,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is one good thing, it's half semester.

2633
03:05:56,012 --> 03:06:01,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm thinking about telling my teacher, excuse me, I know all this shit.

2634
03:06:01,296 --> 03:06:02,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't you challenge the course?

2635
03:06:02,957 --> 03:06:05,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can, I can test out of it.

2636
03:06:06,160 --> 03:06:09,462
[SPEAKER_08]: But I figured at the very least it would be easy A and get me started.

2637
03:06:09,502 --> 03:06:10,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's a true point.

2638
03:06:10,663 --> 03:06:14,806
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on a Saturday though, so I can, since I'll have my laptop, I'll just play on the internet during class.

2639
03:06:14,986 --> 03:06:15,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Play Ragnarok or something.

2640
03:06:17,028 --> 03:06:17,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously?

2641
03:06:17,588 --> 03:06:18,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Good idea, good idea.

2642
03:06:21,344 --> 03:06:23,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see what his attendance policy is and I'll skip most of them.

2643
03:06:23,987 --> 03:06:24,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2644
03:06:25,528 --> 03:06:27,670
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that for a good attitude to take going into school?

2645
03:06:28,631 --> 03:06:29,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going home.

2646
03:06:30,913 --> 03:06:31,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2647
03:06:31,253 --> 03:06:31,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2648
03:06:31,793 --> 03:06:32,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2649
03:06:33,435 --> 03:06:44,224
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I would like to pass on my warm wishes to our listeners from the depths of my, excuse me, heart.

2650
03:06:46,815 --> 03:06:47,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Clusterfuck

2651
03:06:59,830 --> 03:07:07,233
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, I wanted to play this song in case my friend is listening and hopefully he is and he knows who he is.

2652
03:07:08,514 --> 03:07:12,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Bandicoot, if you're listening, here's a song that I know you wanted to hear.

2653
03:07:12,475 --> 03:07:16,097
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after this song from Castlevania, it'll go into Poppin' Music 11.

2654
03:07:16,137 --> 03:07:16,677
[SPEAKER_11]: So enjoy.

2655
03:07:17,157 --> 03:07:18,918
[SPEAKER_11]: And thanks for listening and tuning in to Orange Laundry.

2656
03:07:18,938 --> 03:07:19,518
